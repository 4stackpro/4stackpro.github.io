<p>I think they are simply there to inform you that the program has not been frozen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Microsoft: Updating &hellip; 100%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me: 🤔</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is nothing worse than progress bars that LIE. The worst offender I have ever seen is when the Windows file explorer shows a green progress bar in the address bar when connecting to network drives. I swear to God it is actually programmed to approach the other end asymptotically. So if your drive never connects, it will just get ever and ever closer to being &ldquo;done&rdquo; without ever reaching the other end until a time-out like 10 minutes later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh. So that&rsquo;s why the progress bar usually gets stuck half way through&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How bout make em so that when the bar reaches the end IT ACTUALLY DPES SOMTHING AND DOESN&rsquo;T SIT THERE FOR ANOTHER HALF HOUR&hellip;that makes me insane</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought progress bars keep us insane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who else kept watching the video&rsquo;s progress bar?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I once wrote a &ldquo;Tetris progress bar.&rdquo; The task was so slow that I gave the operator a chance to have a game of Tetris that paused once the task was finished. Oh, how I miss the days of being salaried.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Where does the IT team drink?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>-At the Progress Bar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Microsoft Office installers have always had the worst implementation of the progress bars that I have ever seen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wow, such small thing could have such impact.That was interesting for me to hear about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>progress bars are 100% inaccurate 100% of the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there wasn&rsquo;t a progress bar, it would be a perpetual question of &ldquo;Did it crash?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am a software developer.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li>
<p>When I was asked to make a progress bar equivalent, I asked what value am I tracking?  How do I know how far to fill the bar?  No  one could answer me, but they still wanted a &lsquo;progress bar&rsquo;.  I balked.  A progress bar should show progress, and they didn&rsquo;t have anything for me to track.  No.  Sorry.  That&rsquo;s a stupid idea.  They finally said, Okay, how about a spinner.  Just something to convince the user that the program hasn&rsquo;t completely locked up.  I grudgingly agreed, and ended up using a web program to gin up a GIF animation.  It still seemed so stupid to me, but fine, at least I&rsquo;m not indicating actual progress, just machine state.  The animated GIF was just fine for that.  As the machine slowed down, the GIF would slow down.  As the machine sped up, so would the GIF.

<li>
<p>Me: I&rsquo;m going to sleep early tonight</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me at 2:32am: * watching a video about how progress bars keep me sane *</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Microsoft is the worst with their &ldquo;progress bars&rdquo; that get to the end and then start over.  There is no indication that you are nearing completion, just a graphic that runs over and over, killing time while the computer does whatever.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I died at the end</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re finished.&quot;!? Oh, yeah!? More like: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve finished!&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll be finished when I say I&rsquo;m finished, Skynet!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As if I hadn&rsquo;t spent enough time watching progress bars, I now find myself watching videos about progress bars. Go figure!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I listen to meditation music and watch progress bars. That makes me calm down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I watched red dead redemption install for 4 hours</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Too much?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interesting topic but these FX sounds are&hellip;. distracting. 😒</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Out of the first 6 small things, this is by far the best video.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>i rather have a accurate progress bar or better yet instead of a bar&hellip; a estimated time left is way better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This said so much about my natural life. I have an imaginary progress bar in my head and If I find myself not progressing I automatically freak out and start doubting my capabilities. 😓</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3:47 i never get back</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I thought it was about &ldquo;it&rsquo;s okay, what matters the most is your life makes progress, even if it&rsquo;s slow&rdquo;. But apparently the video just said the function of progress bar 🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he was the cutest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Too much?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was addicted to that AOL blue bar every time I logged on. Couldn&rsquo;t wait to see the new &ldquo;graphics&rdquo; that were updating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Too much&rdquo; lol.

<p>I love almost everything TED does man</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was told by a Sony audio equipment rep., they had to put a green light on the front of their pre - amps. Customers couldn&rsquo;t stand not knowing if the unit was on or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While watching Ted videos the ongoing duration bar tells me that I am constantly learning something. Even if it&rsquo;s the explanation of some sort of minuscule things that we usually don&rsquo;t think about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>*insane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watching this while watching a loading bar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>talk about Microsoft Windows update progress bar 😐😐</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This video made me feel as if i was watching the progress bar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no, wasn&rsquo;t too much. It was an amazing quote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did I really watch this to the end.  Could have got away with watching a progress bar instead</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Could have uploaded these one a day instead of all in one go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I always use the progress bar to find time to go do something else. Let&rsquo;s not overthink it, it&rsquo;s just a download</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I did not &ldquo;skip&rdquo; that last ad, but I know &ldquo;whatever&rdquo; is now in the progress, its a youtube-understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Super interesting stuff!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That&rsquo;s why the same way it&rsquo;s satisfactory to see the progression, it&rsquo;s very frustrating to see when it reaches 101%. It&rsquo;s all about expectation alignment and trust!</p>

<p>For some reason, I found myself mesmerized by his face the whole time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;d prefer a progress bar that&rsquo;s giving me accurate information over one that&rsquo;s &ldquo;telling me an interesting story&rdquo; all day!</p>

<p>Great series TED!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The study is old! Now that we’ve grown up with it, we know not to trust it. It’s not exciting or hopeful, it’s flipping frustrating</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love watching progress bars on games that I play. They&rsquo;re not accurate but they keep me occupied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>too much 😂</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My life is a lie. Thanks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very useful!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Very helpful , thank you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I REALLY miss defragmenting hard drives. All those little boxes flooding by as they change colors and making my data safe and speedy. Definitely therapeutic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>99.9% done keeps me anything BUT sane I can tell you that</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ummm&hellip; The progress bar not being accurate drives me insane sometimes.. Especially after it has repeated 500x.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Especially Steam download progress bars</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That was great</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The youtube permanent progress bar is worthless. I want to know the TIME. Give me a permanent TIME count.</p>

<p>Mark Ruffalo&rsquo;s brother from another mother?, lol</p>
</li>

<p>That was GREAT. It was seriously, both the most useless(I mean, there are so many other problems in the world and this is just a computer progress bar we&rsquo;re looking at) and the most interesting vid in days. I mean, a progress bar. We see it all the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On a deeper level, we are all Born with a virtual Progress bar that has no numbers, could fill up anytime then its all over :)</p>
</li>

<p>Nice editing

<p>I feel lied to. I feel betrayed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How impatient and pathetic are we for us to have to program progress bars?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest with you when the progress bar has the little writing on top like &ldquo;initializing x_heibe&hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;downloading useful.txt&hellip;&rdquo; and it sometimes goes super fast, and you cant even read the text, thats the most satisfying thing. Normal progress bars just leave me curious about what my computer is doing, and eventually leaves me to be frustrated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safari&rsquo;s progress bar is pretty accurate, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea of a progress bar not being an accurate representation of progress made or time remaining but instead being repurposed as some kind of tool for psychological manipulation or entertainment is infuriating. &hellip; But it also explains a lot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a sort of apprehension</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I tried downloading rainbow 6 siege without a progress bar I would go insane, loading GTA V makes me go insane because there is not a progress bar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The progress bar is there to say &ldquo;The computer hasn&rsquo;t frozen or crashed. You should still wait for it rather than force-quitting the application.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So , is there a progress bar for our ages ?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That God. Cause I did not finish this video. Let me check the progress bar, yupppp. Identified</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safari always likes to freeze until I refresh the page and loads 100 times better than waiting for a frozen page to load</p>

<li>
<p>In many cases the progress bar doesn’t mean much.. so often on PC (especially) and sometimes Mac systems, the progress bar will take its longest when it hits 100%!! I usually ignore them and go for a coffee!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the progress bar has done anything for me in life, it&rsquo;s made me hate the 99%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They should show a little story instead - like a little person running to a destination or the like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interesting&hellip;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>awesome video!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nice</p>

<p>It is frustrating to see it slow down halfway through. Don’t make it go a third of the speed it was going at the beginning. Make it go at 70% of the initial speed.

<p>This is the reason why I use &ldquo;rsync &ndash;info=progress2&rdquo; instead of plain &ldquo;cp&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s really frustating to copy GBs of files and not knowing whether it&rsquo;s near ending or not</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blow your nose bro.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well duh. Where is the surprise in that? With computers being as unreliable as they are at times, I want to know that the software is actually doing something other than just sitting there. And of course that is reassuring. Because if the program freezes, then the progress bar freezes. The psychological benefit of this gizmo comes from it practical use .</p>

<p>I always felt that the way people feel about progress bars or loading symbols was linked to the human need to quantify progression. When we do something or wait for something with no discernable change we become uneasy. When there is something that tells us that there is a change and that there is a definite goal to this change that will be reached (either by letting time pass or by doing certain things) humans can focus better on the task. Think of it as a game. Say you have two of the exact same RPG. In the first RPG (let&rsquo;s call it RPGA) you have the conventional quantification of status and skills, in the second game (this one called RPGB) all that quantification happens still, but you give the players no indication aside from when they achieve a goal or attain a skill (no experience bars, no mana gauges, no hp bar, no status numbers to quantify their strengths and weaknesses but they still have them). If you were to play the traditional game, you are able to focus on raising certain things quite easily. When you do an action the game indicates through numbers that there is a discernable effect from your actions (i.e. gaining exp, raising skill exp, progress towards a quest). Now in game RPGB, you don&rsquo;t have any indicators. You get the exp still, but you don&rsquo;t know how much. You can raise all those skills in the same manner but you don&rsquo;t know how long you&rsquo;ll have to keep going to get it to level up. The person playing would no longer have confidence that what they are doing is making a difference in a direction that they want things to progress towards, or even if there is any progress at all. How long do I have to do something to raise this now? This difference in knowledge changes the experience completely. When you are presented with data that indicates that what you are doing effects something, even if that means just waiting for a set amount of time to get something done, you are confident that there is change happening. When you don&rsquo;t have any indication that something is happening, even if you know it should be, you feel concerned that maybe it&rsquo;s not doing what it should be doing.</p>

<p>Was there a need for this content? Of course, if right, it keeps us sane and makes us free to do other things. What was &ldquo;SO SURPRISING&rdquo; about that &ldquo;discovery&rdquo;? Your viewers aren&rsquo;t dumb, Ted. Plus, the audacity to say, &ldquo;Too much?&rdquo; at the end of the video cracked me up and made me finish his sentence. NONSENSE. Too much nonsense.</p>

<p>ios 6 imessage progress bar gave me cANCER</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To me it&rsquo;s just an indicator that my computer is doing something. If the bar doesn&rsquo;t pop up then I know it didn&rsquo;t initiate the command. I don&rsquo;t dealt care how long it takes I just don&rsquo;t want to be sitting around forever wondering if the task had been done.</p>

<p>How&rsquo;s about if tech gave users a non-skewed version of reality, and then let us worry about the psychological state resultant of it.</p>

<p>I would love to see progress bars offer a mini-game to pass the time if you have nothing else to do while waiting. A game of snake? A Mario Bros siderunner? A quick round of Tetris?  Some quick puzzles from brilliant.org or elsewhere? A progress bar with an entertaining or educational purpose would be as revolutionary as using captchas to transcribe old books.</p>

<p>sorry but I think your wrong I have been using pc&rsquo;s for 3 decades and its more to show that your pc is just actually doing something and not froze and you need to restart because as long as its moving your not waiting in vein</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Too much.</p>

<p>Best would be to put a timer on it, or put some Random Facts there that keep people interested like</p>
