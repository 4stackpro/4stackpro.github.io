<h3 id="hawaiis-coronavirus-cases-climb-by-23-to-410-with-16-new-hospitalizations">Hawaii’s coronavirus cases climb by 23 to 410, with 16 new hospitalizations</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/web1_CTY-disaster-tent-4.jpg" alt="img">
Hawaii Department of Health officials said today that the state’s tally of coronavirus cases has risen to 410, up 23 from Monday.</p>
<p>Of all the confirmed cases in Hawaii since the start of the outbreak, 42 have required hospitalizations, with 16 new cases reported today, health officials said.</p>
<p>The state’s coronavirus death toll stands at five, unchanged from Monday. The five deaths are three men and two women.</p>
<p>Today’s statewide total includes 312 cases on Oahu, 48 in Maui County, 23 on Hawaii island, and 18 in Kauai County, according to health officials.</p>
<p>The statewide total also includes two Hawaii residents diagnosed outside of the state.</p>
<p>Seven cases in the statewide total are pending identification of county, down two from Monday.</p>
<p>In all, state officials today reported 20 new cases on Oahu, four in Maui County, one new cases on Kauai, and no new cases on the Big Island. Health officials say that the sum of changes by county is “larger than the number of statewide newly reported cases because of previously reported pending cases being reclassified to county totals as more information is collected.”</p>
<p>A total 113 patients have recovered since the start of the outbreak, with health officials reporting 24 new recoveries today. By county, Honolulu has seen 83 patients recover, Maui has had 14 recoveries, the Big Island has had nine, and Kauai has seen seven, as of noon today, the Health Department says.</p>
<p>Of the 42 hospitalizations in the state, 36 have been on Oahu, five on Maui and one on Kauai.</p>
<p>The state’s Joint COVID-19 Information Center said in a statement that of today’s 23 new cases, all are adults, with three travel-related and the rest unknown. The center said there has been a decrease of travel-associated cases, but Health Department investigators are looking at community-associated cases, primarily on Oahu and Maui.</p>
<p>“This is why the continued practice of physical distancing is so critical in flattening the curve of infection in the state,” officials said.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 Information Center said that of the 14,981 coronavirus tests so far conducted by state and clinical laboratories in the islands, a total 408, or 2.7%, have been positive. (That number does not include the two Hawaii residents living outside the state who are also counted in Hawaii’s total of 410 cases.)</p>
<p>On Monday, health officials announced 16 new cases statewide, which had been the smallest increase in 10 days for Hawaii, but state Health Director Bruce Anderson warned that the “worst is yet to come.”

<h3 id="hawaii-mayor-florida-man-flouting-quarantine-was-covidiot">Hawaii mayor: Florida man flouting quarantine was &lsquo;Covidiot&rsquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/WireAP_7ba40399ac204b3cbf513e0f67c66030_16x9_992.jpg" alt="img">
Hawaii mayor: Florida man flouting quarantine was &lsquo;Covidiot&rsquo; A mayor in Hawaii is calling a Florida man accused of trying to flout Hawaii’s traveler quarantine a covidiot</p>
<p>HONOLULU &ndash; A mayor in Hawaii is calling a Florida man accused of trying to flout Hawaii’s traveler quarantine a “covidiot.”</p>
<p>Kauai Mayor Derek Kawakami isn’t taking credit for coining the word borne from the COVID-19 pandemic, but said he &ldquo;may be the first elected official to bust it out in public.”</p>
<p>Bobby Edwards, of Boynton Beach, was arrested last week after police said he landed on the island without proof of having accommodations set up. A statewide order requires people arriving in the islands to quarantine for 14 days.</p>
<p>Edwards “was exhibiting belligerent behavior toward airport personnel and toward officers during his arrest,” police said.</p>
<p>Police added that Edwards, 31, &ldquo;was also showing significant signs of intoxication and was not being cooperative.”</p>
<p>Earlier last week, another Florida man, Dwight Anthony Tucker of Tampa, was stopped in the tourist town of Hanalei a day after he arrived on Kauai, police said.</p>
<p>He was arrested after authorities said he disregarded Gov. David Ige&rsquo;s statewide order requiring all visitors arriving on or after March 26 to self-quarantine at their place of accommodation.</p>
<p>Also last week, Kauai police arrested Devin Martin of Olympia, Washington, and accused him of violating the quarantine order.</p>
<p>“He did not have reservations for proper accommodations and he allegedly refused to find suitable lodging,” police said.</p>
<p>None of the three men could be immediately reached for comment Tuesday.</p>
<p>The arrests send a message Kauai is fighting to protect its residents, Kawakami said.</p>
<p>He has also instituted a 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew for residents and visitors, implemented a day pass system for visitors to ease congestion for those exercising at beaches and directed police, with help from the National Guard, to conduct island checkpoints.</p>
<p>“I guess there’s varying degrees of how much of a covidiot you can be,” Kawakami said. “Those three rank pretty high. I would say they rank pretty high to try to run away from a state that has a high number of people that are ill to come to Hawaii where we’ve been working hard. Everybody’s sacrificing.”</p>
<p>As of Tuesday afternoon, there were 410 confirmed coronavirus cases statewide, including 18 on Kauai. There have been five deaths statewide.</p>
<p>The three men have been returned to the mainland U.S. with help from the Kauai Visitors Bureau.</p>
<p>The expense makes Kawakami upset, but he said they had to get out of Hawaii.</p>
<p>“But, you know, when you factor in the risk that they pose to our community, not having a place to quarantine, not having any accommodation, quite frankly, possibly being another homeless individual that we would be asked to take care of,” he said. “You know, it hurts.”</p>
<p>Kawakami plans to send them invoices for the travel costs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard that some visitors have been coming here and taking advantage of the COVID-19 situation with cheap flights,&rdquo; said Jessica Lani Rich, president of the Visitor Aloha Society of Hawaii.</p>
<p>On Monday, with funding from the Hawaii Tourism Authority, she sent three homeless men back to Los Angeles after they arrived in Honolulu with nowhere to stay.</p>
<p>Officials warned that those wanting to come to Hawaii with no accommodations may not make it out of the airport.</p>
<p>Even before the state&rsquo;s traveler quarantine and statewide stay-at-home order was imposed that allows for essential activities such as grocery shopping and outdoor exercise, Kawakami said he needed “to make Kauai as unappealing as possible very quickly&rdquo; and even at the expense of a tourism-dependent economy.</p>
<p>“We didn’t have to grapple with it. There wasn’t even a second thought,” he said. “Health and safety &hellip; are paramount. There is nothing more important than protecting our people and we’re willing to fight for it.”</p>
<p>———</p>
<p>This version corrects the hometown of one of those arrested to Boynton Beach, not Boynton.
