On Instagram, Queen legend Freddie Mercury’s fan page has shared a really rare photo of him in which he was posing with his little-known musical partner, Spanish operatic soprano Montserrat Caballe.</p>
<p>In the caption area, the page celebrated the birthday of Spanish musician Caballe, who passed away on October 6, 2018. Here’s what the page wrote about Caballe and Mercury:</p>
<p>“Happy birthday to Montserrat Caballé. She would’ve been 87 years old today 🖤”</p>
<p>They added:</p>
<p>“Without warning, he sat down at the piano at the former Hotel Ritz in Barcelona and began to improvise Exercises in Free Love, singing in falsetto what would be her part if she accepted. It was the beginning of 1987 and the first time Queen frontman Freddie Mercury met Spanish soprano Montserrat Caballé.</p>
<p>This meeting would lead to a legendary musical partnership that would bring the best of the classical and contemporary music world together in the iconic anthem Barcelona, written ahead of the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games.⁣”</p>
<p>Also, the page wrote:</p>
<p>“Caballé liked that Freddie, contrary to appearances, sold his voice instead of his image. When he sat down at the piano to improvise, I realized that a true musician was before me,” she said. He made such a good impression that she agreed to meet him again at his house in London to record a demo.”</p>
<p>See the Instagram post and photos below.</p>
<p>In 1987, Freddie and Montserrat have collaborated for a special music that was written for the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games. You can watch their duet below.

<h3 id="mans-lockdown-recreation-of-freddie-mercurys-live-aid-performance-goes-viral">Man’s lockdown ‘recreation’ of Freddie Mercury’s Live Aid performance goes viral</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-86108078.jpg" alt="img">
With the ongoing coronavirus lockdown depriving music fans of live shows, one man has taken it upon himself to ‘recreate’ Freddie Mercury‘s legendary Live Aid performance.</p>
<p>Standing on his roof and using a broomstick for a microphone, the unnamed man lip-synced to the now-iconic ‘day-oh’ sequence from Queen’s 1985 show at Live Aid.</p>
<p>Footage was first uploaded to a YouTube Channel under the name Felicity Griffiths, with more then appearing on Twitter. Take a look below.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Day 2746439270 and this is what my husband has resorted to&rsquo; 😂🔊 pic.twitter.com/iO04P2C4ml — LADBible (@ladbible) April 11, 2020</p>
<p>It’s not the only Queen-inspired coronavirus performance. Musician Adrian Grimes’ reimagining of the band’s 1975 hit ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ has garnered over 3.5 million views since it was uploaded on March 21. It includes new lyrics, such as “Mama, I just killed a man / I didn’t stay inside in bed / I walked past him, now he’s dead.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the band’s Brian May has stated that he believes humanity will “learn some great lessons” from the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>“It’s a very hard time for everyone,” he said. “This is a tragedy. But there are things to be grateful for. There’s a lot of people who are in terrible times, and we’re gonna lose a lot of people. It might be me, since I’m an elderly and vulnerable person. But, you know, it’s not all bad — there are good things to look forward to, and this is only for now.”</p>

<p>He added: “When we come out of this, I think there will be some great lessons we have learned. I hope we remember the lessons that we’ve learned — that we can work from home, the cars can stop, the planes can stop, the air can get clear. I mean, suddenly we can all breathe again. That’s gonna save countless lives. There’s no animals being knocked down on the roads anymore, and our wildlife rescue is experiencing a tremendous difference.”

<h3 id="queen-producer-reveals-a-well-kept-secret-that-makes-freddie-mercury-a-genius--metalhead-zone">Queen Producer Reveals A Well-Kept Secret That Makes Freddie Mercury A Genius – Metalhead Zone</h3>
<p><img src="https://metalheadzone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/freddie-mercury-night-photo.jpg" alt="img">
One of the biggest fan pages of Queen legend Freddie Mercury, Freddie Mercury Fanclub, has shared some super-rare photos on the official Instagram account and returned back us to 1985.</p>
<p>As you can see in the photos, Freddie was working with famous producer Reinhold Mack for a special project that also features Led Zeppelin singer, Robert Plant, and The Rolling Stones co-founder, Mick Jagger.</p>
<p>In the caption area of the post, the page has revealed a rare interview line of Reinhold Mack in which he was talking about Freddie Mercury and describing his feelings about working with Freddie. He also mentioned the well-kept secret songwriting method of Fred.</p>
<p>Here’s what Mack told:</p>
<p>“Freddie was music. He was a genius. You think of an idea and he would do something even better. He could always top what he had done himself in various ways. You would think, Jesus, how could you even come up with that stuff? He was a brilliant piano player and he actually plays a really good guitar, too, even though he claimed he couldn’t.</p>
<p>He usually came up with really good ideas in a matter of 15 or 30 minutes. He was always good at finding something, even if it was not the complete song. Sometimes he would devise the main hook really quickly. Then he developed it and I edited the stuff together. If we had the backbone of a song, we were happy.”</p>
<p>Reinhold Mack also revealed the song-writing method of Freddie and said:</p>
<p>“The way the guy wrote was to take a little notepad from, say, the Hilton Hotel and he might just write something like ‘A, F, C’, and then the next line would be the following chord and there would be ten of those pages and he would say, ‘Ah, there’s the song. It looks good and I can already hear it. I would tell him that I could sort of understand the chord structure, but wanted to hear the melody. Then he would come up with something remarkable on top of it.”</p>
<p>The admin of the Instagram page added:</p>
<p>“FYI: Reinhold Mack is the celebrated German music producer who worked with Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, AND with Queen for years producing albums like The Game, Hot Space, and The Works. He also produced Freddie’s solo music Mr Bad Guy and during Freddie’s Munich years Mack and his family were like Freddie’s own family as he spent a lot if time with them. Freddie was also the godfather of Mack’s youngest son “Freddie Mack”.</p>
<p>P.S. I don’t wanna add anything else to what Mack has said here about Freddie’s genius &amp; songwriting process. “He was music” says it all.</p>
<p>I have posted about Freddie Mack’s memories of his godfather and I have lots of other stories from Mack himself that I’ll share with you later.</p>
