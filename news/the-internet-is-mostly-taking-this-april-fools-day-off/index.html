Today, though, the brands are mostly quiet. Like so many of our other creature comforts, from sports to concerts, they’ve taken the year off amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>It’s probably for the best.</p>
<p>“It would just be seen as just so tone-deaf with people dying, and we&rsquo;re not even at the peak yet,” said Donna Hoffman, a marketing professor at George Washington University.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>During the past decade or so, on this day “brands have really tried to see how clever they could be, how funny they could be,” Hoffman said. And it works well enough. “I think there is a little bit of a bump for brands that do these clever things, and they get written about.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Many large brands, including Google, the king of April Fools’, opted out of this year’s shenanigans. Last April 1, T-Mobile announced it would (re-)introduce the world to phone booths, but this year it launched a #GiveThanksNotPranks campaign on social media, pledging to donate a buck for every “gratitude story posted on Twitter” with that hashtag (up to $200,000).</p>
<p>The Australian arm of Virgin, another frequent participant, announced it was also taking the day off. “We know that you are used to being fooled by us on April Fools’ Day, but we think that 2020 has pranked us enough already,” the company’s product and consumer general manager Sarah Adam said in an Instagram video — and included plans to donate toilet paper rolls from more than 100 of its grounded aircraft to those in need.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Still, some organizations carried on. Animal rights advocacy group In Defense of Animals announced that Snoop Dogg had changed his name to Snoop Frogg (the real Snoop has a long history of name-changing) to promote its (real) campaign Too Cruel for School, which urges schools to use SynFrog, a realistic, synthetic frog, for dissection in science classes, instead of real amphibians.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“We wanted to put a smile on people’s face, but we do have a really serious issue and message to share with people here,” said the organization’s campaigns director, Matthew Hamity, who added that one reason IDA went through with the campaign was the suspected connection between covid-19 and the illegal trafficking of pangolins and bats, which has raised concerns among some animal advocates.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>One prank backfired majestically in the most predictable of ways. Kim Jaejoong of K-pop group JYJ announced to his million-plus fans that he tested positive for the virus, which first garnered an outpouring of support — then swells of outrage. He later claimed the gag was to raise awareness.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“That was a very sick joke,” tweeted one fan. “How disrespectful,” tweeted another.</p>
<p>Typically, April Fools’ is one among many spring festivals that celebrate “the ability to be social again” after our winter indoor hibernation, said Simon Bronner, a folklorist and dean of the College of General Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, “and one of the ways to be social is through humor.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Those festivals often tout the creation of new life. Advertisers are “tapping in or linking up people to this sense of, ‘It’s spring, so therefore you should be getting something new,’&rdquo; Bronner said. “In consumer theory, when do people replace what they have when there’s this sense of permanence to their objects? Spring is a big time to do that.”

<h3 id="april-fools-day-pranks-are-not-funny-right-now-dont-do-them">April Fools&rsquo; Day pranks are not funny right now. Don&rsquo;t do them.</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200331165442-april-fools-file-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
So let&rsquo;s take this opportunity to clarify something: April Fools&rsquo; Day pranks are not funny right now. Don&rsquo;t do them.</p>
<p>Many people have been pretty clear that April Fools&rsquo; Day is all but canceled this year, seeing that pretty much every day for the past few weeks has felt like a terrible prank.</p>
<p>Even Google, which traditionally shares April Fools&rsquo; Day pranks and jokes across its platforms, is abstaining from such tomfoolery this year, according to a Business Insider report</p>
<p>And if you still think something like a coronavirus prank may be a big laugh, keep in mind a few things that could happen: You could get arrested. You could endanger other people&rsquo;s lives. And, at the very least, your friends and family will know just how unfunny you really are.</p>
<p>Thinking of pretending you have coronavirus? In the US, a man who allegedly coughed in the direction of a grocery clerk and said he had the virus was charged with making a terrorist threat in the third degree, according to the New Jersey Attorney General&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>Looking to cause a scene? A Missouri man who filmed himself licking items on a Walmart shelf while saying &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s afraid of the coronavirus&rdquo; was charged with making a terrorist threat in the second degree, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.</p>
<p>Another woman in Pennsylvania is facing criminal charges after intentionally coughing on grocery store produce, CNN reported last week. The store had to throw out $35,000 worth of food as a caution.</p>
<p>Even local officials in different countries have asked citizens not to pull any coronavirus pranks this year.</p>
<p>In Thailand, the Attorney General&rsquo;s office warned people against spreading fake news, the country&rsquo;s English-language newspaper Nation Thailand reported</p>
<p>And in India, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh announced on Twitter that legal action would be taken against people pulling coronavirus stunts on WhatsApp and other social media platforms.</p>
<p>Your messy attempt at a prank may not earn you a criminal record, but consider what will actually happen if you hop onto Facebook and say, &ldquo;Hey ma, I&rsquo;ve got coronavirus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only will your loved ones worry about you, you&rsquo;ll send anyone who&rsquo;s had contact with you in the last two weeks into apoplexy. You may even get health officials poking around asking questions, or end up taxing already-suffocating medical resources with your foolery.</p>
<p>Be sure to tell the exhausted health care worker who has to deal with you that it was &ldquo;just a joke.&rdquo; They&rsquo;ll find it hilarious.</p>
<p>April Fools&rsquo; Day pranks have always been a dicey endeavor, but they&rsquo;re going to be even more difficult to pull off if you can&rsquo;t even get close to someone. No, that&rsquo;s not a challenge.</p>
<p>Social distancing bubbles are sacred now. We&rsquo;re literally being tasked with keeping each other healthy. Is that enough to sacrifice for whatever scheme you&rsquo;ve cooked up in your self-isolated sopor?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a better April Fools&rsquo; Day prank this year: Stay very far away from people, wash your hands, and don&rsquo;t pluck at the few fragile little threads holding together our collective sanity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be a hit.

<h3 id="ill-timed-april-fools-day-coronavirus-prank-riles-nypd">Ill-timed April Fools’ Day coronavirus prank riles NYPD</h3>
<p><img src="https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/nypd.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="img">
An April fool’s prank promising 12-hour shifts in the face of coronavirus made its rounds among the NYPD’s rank-and-file Wednesday — but many cops said the coronavirus crisis is just no laughing matter.</p>
<p>“This is such a serious pandemic and to make a joke when people are getting seriously ill and officers are on edge is wrong,” said Sgt. Joe Imperatrice, the founder of Blue Lives Matter NYC.</p>
<p>“This isn’t a time to be joking around.”</p>
<p>The trick was sent around as a citywide “Finest Message” telling cops starting April 8 all officers, sergeants, detective and lieutenants would move to 12-hour shifts.</p>
<p>The order appeared real — except for the last few words of the penultimate paragraph that read: “chart schedule effect on April mutherf—in fool’s day.”</p>
<p>“Cops have nothing better to do than to scare other cops,” one police source grumbled.</p>
<p>Another quipped, “The NYPD is the best at spreading rumors.”</p>
<p>It was unclear where the message originated.</p>
<p>The department has said it could move to 12-hour tours if enough cops fall ill, but has yet to make that change official.</p>
<p>The prank message was time-stamped just over an hour after Police Commissioner Dermot Shea told CNN the department wasn’t at that point yet.</p>
<p>“There’s more behind the 12-hour tours. People are worried about getting sick, daycare,” Imperatrice said.</p>
<p>“You don’t joke about that. Something like that where it looks really real,” he said, adding that some wouldn’t spot the prank.</p>
<p>The NYPD did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
