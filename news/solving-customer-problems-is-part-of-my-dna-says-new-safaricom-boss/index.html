<p>Mr Peter Ndegwa reports to work at the helm of Safaricom today, becoming the first Kenyan to run East Africa’s most profitable company.</p>
<p>The 51-year-old takes over at a time when the economy is starting to feel the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak, which will affect all sectors and may impact his first year in office.</p>
<p>He takes over a company that makes more than Sh60 billion in profits a year, with revenues of over Sh250 billion at a time when its key profit segments are reaching maturity and plateau stages.</p>
<p>In an exclusive interview with the Nation on Tuesday, Mr Ndegwa said the best leaders are known in times of crisis. He added that he is keen to steer Safaricom through this period and help chart its future given the decline in the traditional sources of revenues such as voice.</p>
<p>INTEGRITY</p>
<p>“It is time to serve my country. There are two things that I value most — humility and integrity. Integrity is about doing what you say and humility is knowing that there is always something more you can do,” he said.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>He spoke about his strategy, what he plans to do differently as well as what excites him about the new job. He also addressed pricing issues and how Safaricom will navigate the Covid-19 disruption.</p>
<p>“I like getting things done. The best strategy is about solving the problems faced by our customers and this is part of my DNA. I also like things simple,” he said.</p>
<p>He does not expect to find it easy given the role that Safaricom plays in the lives of Kenyans. He takes over when the National Treasury has classified M-Pesa as a national security threat and when the noises of nationalisation as well as splitting are getting louder by the day.</p>
<p>Mr Ndegwa, an economist and accountant by profession, has just returned from climbing Mt Kilimanjaro as he prepares to take over from Michael Joseph, who was put in charge as a caretaker following the death of Bob Collymore last year.</p>
<p>Mr Ndegwa is married to Jemimah Ndegwa and they have a 10-year-old son.</p>
<p>He said Kenyans should expect him to help Safaricom define its next phase of growth, noting that there are still great opportunities in data, M-Pesa and geographical expansion to Ethiopia.</p>
<p>He further said the Covid-19 outbreak will change the way Kenyans interact with one another for a long time and this will create opportunities in agriculture, health and education. “Learning from home has created opportunities in education through e-learning. We are also looking at how innovation can help us deliver services in healthcare and agriculture,” he said.</p>
<p>He, however, said he cannot promise anything on pricing at this time until he gets in and gets a brief on what factors play in the process.</p>
<p>PRESSURE</p>
<p>Safaricom has come under increasing pressure from consumers to make price cuts on its services, among them M-Pesa, data and Fuliza, given the economies of scale it enjoys.</p>
<p>“We shall listen to our customers. No business survives without providing services that their customers can afford,” he said but added that the company has been investing heavily in infrastructure and this is a key determinant in pricing of its services.</p>
<p>By June, the company plans to have 4G network in all parts of the country. He also said the company will look at the possibilities of segmenting its products to better serve the needs of various customers.</p>
<p>“Safaricom is more than just a telecommunications company. Voice is saturated but that is what is happening everywhere in the world. The best companies renew themselves,” he said.</p>
<p>He said everything about his upbringing and life prepared him well for the current assignment, having grown up from humble beginnings and fought his way to the top through hard work.</p>
<p>Mr Ndegwa has a Master of Business Administration degree from the London Business School, where he specialised in finance and strategy.</p>
<p>He also attended the advanced Management Programme at the University of IESE Spain and Strathmore University. He is a certified public accountant and a member of ICPAK.</p>
<p>He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics from the University of Nairobi and is an alumnus of Starehe Boys Centre.</p>
<p>Mr Ndegwa draws his inspiration from his primary schoolteachers, the legendary Dr Geoffrey Griffin — the late founder of Starehe Boys Centre — and his parents, especially his mother.</p>
<p>The new Safaricom boss describes himself as a seasoned business and commercial leader with an outstanding track record for transforming organisations and teams, and delivering superior performance.</p>
<p>COMMERCIAL ACUMEN</p>
<p>He says on his Curriculum Vitae that he has exceptional strategic orchestration skills, ability to shape the future and an astute commercial acumen. He is also highly driven, courageous, resilient and has strong people skills, the CV adds.</p>
<p>Mr Ndegwa has an impressive career spanning more than 25 years, starting as a consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in the audit firm’s financial services section, before moving to consumer goods with Diageo.</p>
<p>In the past 15 years, he has operated at executive committee and board levels of large publicly listed businesses across Africa as chief executive, senior executive director and board member.</p>
<p>Mr Ndegwa started his career as a graduate trainee at PwC in Nairobi in June 1992. He worked at the firm till June 1996, where he rose through the ranks to an audit assistant, before being promoted to a senior assistant manager.</p>
<p>July 1996 marked the beginning of his global career. PwC put him on its talent development programme that saw him move to London as an audit manager. He was part of PwC’s financial services team in the UK till June 1999. His key clients mainly comprised top 10 global banks, insurance companies and asset managers.</p>
<p>In July 1999, he transitioned from the accountancy practice to the consulting and corporate finance unit after completing his MBA.</p>
<p>Here, he advised on a variety of corporate assignments, providing strategic value advice, shareholder value development, and financial services sector expertise and project management.</p>
<p>His clients ranged from leading European and American banks to insurance businesses. He did this till March 2002.</p>
<p>RELOCATION</p>
<p>In April 2002, he relocated to East Africa after a successful six years with PwC in the London office. Back in Nairobi, he was named the PwC associate director.</p>
<p>He worked on a number of corporate advisory assignments, mostly in the financial services sector, providing advice on strategic transactions, due diligence, valuation, financial planning and modelling as well as project leadership and management.</p>
<p>He left PwC and joined the East Africa Breweries Limited (EABL) as a director of strategy from January 2004 to December 2005. It was in this role that he crafted EABL’s five-year vision and strategy.</p>
<p>Part of the strategy was how to enter the ‘affordable beer market’. This is what led to the introduction of the Senator brand, which was to become the fastest and the most successful innovation in Diageo Africa.</p>
<p>He then became a sales director at EABL from January 2006 to June 2008. Mr Ndegwa led a 150-man commercial team, restructuring the sales function to improve customer service and execution.</p>
<p>He also created a customer marketing team that became the engine of commercial planning and execution, besides restructuring the distributor base at EABL.</p>
<p>From sales director, Mr Ndegwa was promoted to become the Group Finance Director and chief finance officer (CFO) at the Ruaraka-based brewer. This elevated him to the de facto second in command at EABL after the group chief executive.</p>
<p>He held this position between July 2008 and October 2011. In this role, he had responsibility for finance, procurement and information systems.</p>
<p>COMPETITION</p>
<p>As CFO, Mr Ndegwa oversaw the finance and strategy function of the brewer across six countries in East Africa. At that time, his job also included managing SABMiller, an equity and brand partner.</p>
<p>He says he operated as CFO in a dynamic three to four-year period managing a significant commercial agenda. EABL grew its regional business and expanded its spirits business.</p>
<p>In 2010, he led a significant business development agenda, including acquisition of a controlling stake in Tanzania’s Serengeti Breweries Limited and the unwinding of the complex shareholding structure with SABMiller, a direct competitor in Kenya and Tanzania. The transaction size was between Sh7 billion and Sh25 billion.</p>
<p>This opened both markets for direct competition between them.</p>
<p>He then moved to Accra, Ghana, to be the managing director and CEO of Guinness Ghana Breweries between November 2011 and June 2015. Here, he was given the full P &amp; L mandate and he was also managing a 20 per cent equity partnership with Heineken.</p>
<p>Guinness Ghana is a listed business (Diageo held 54 per cent at the time) and had a leadership position in beer and soft drinks. But its position was under threat in a highly competitive market.</p>
<p>After three years in Ghana, he moved to be the CEO of Guinness Nigeria Plc, another Diageo company.</p>
<p>Here, he was accountable for the business with 1,300 employees and the third largest Guinness market globally.</p>
<p>MARKET DYNAMICS</p>
<p>As a CEO, in both roles, he inherited two businesses that were &lsquo;crown jewels&rsquo; in Diageo Africa, but faced significant strategic and operational challenges and their competitive position and business model was under threat from disruptive category and competitive dynamics.</p>
<p>He had a turnaround and transform mandate. He said he managed this transformation by reframing the vision, strategy and the operational priorities of the businesses.</p>
<p>Mr Ndegwa noted that he brought the Guinness franchise back into strong top-line and share growth both in Nigeria and Ghana as some of his achievements.</p>
<p>He also broadened the portfolio through innovation and delivered a Sh1 billion productivity savings over a three-year period in Nigeria, with a simplified and more agile organisation.</p>
<p>During this period, he also led the beer industry group in Nigeria and Ghana that lobbied for a major tax policy win in Ghana and avoided a large excise duty increase in Nigeria. He achieved the turnaround targets and returned to top-line growth in two years.</p>
<p>Guinness Nigeria is a high-profile listed business on the Nigerian Stock Exchange, with iconic and established household brands, a majority controlled by Diageo (58 per cent).</p>
<p>The beer market dynamics were being disrupted by the actions of a major competitor who created a new low-priced beer subcategory challenging Guinness Nigeria’s previous premium price positioning, resulting in market share decline.

<h3 id="baptism-by-fire-for-new-safaricom-boss--the-standard">Baptism by fire for new Safaricom boss : The Standard</h3>

Baptism by fire for new Safaricom boss, Peter Ndegwa</p>
<p>It goes with the territory. So, big job, giant challenges: Safaricom CEO Peter Ndegwa.</p>
<p>When Peter Ndegwa takes office tomorrow as the new Safaricom chief executive officer, his every move will be closely scrutinised.His words and deeds, however small or off-the-cuff, will instantly spread and be amplified. Occasionally, his sentiments will be misinterpreted. For Mr Ndegwa, taking over the most profitable company in East and Central Africa will be as exciting as it will be challenging. This is especially so because he will be succeeding two larger-than-life CEOs – Michael Joseph and Bob Collymore – and he must stamp his own imprint to walk out of their shadows. Few other jobs are as daunting, and Ndegwa’s entry is unlikely to be marked by pomp and circumstance. It is a baptism by fire. The coronavirus disease, Covid-19, is knocking down businesses. Investors, locally and globally, are losing trillions of shillings in paper wealth as the world economy plunges into a recession.As at the close of last week, shareholders of Safaricom, which is listed at the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE), lost Sh244.5 billion in paper wealth in three months.</p>
<p>STEALING FROM THE SICK: Why hospitals are healthy wards for criminals - The Nairobian Read Now »</p>
<p>The pandemic brought to an end a share rally at what had been the NSE’s best-performing counter. And as the pandemic continues to ravage the business world with a lot of companies closing shop and sending workers home, Safaricom might take solace in the fact that people will still need to talk to each other. Kenyans will still be calling and texting and browsing, ensuring that Safaricom services remain in high demand. But as the pandemic continues to wipe money from people’s pockets, Kenyans might be forced to choose between buying airtime and food. But what will prove to be more intricate to his new assignment is the fact that President Uhuru Kenyatta has partnered with Google and Telkom Kenya to unveil an initiative that will see learners, those working from home and regions previously unreached by faster Internet receive high-speed connectivity through the Google Loon project. Safaricom has increasingly placed its bets on this data front for growth. It is not yet clear how the project will pan out, but should it take off, it might eat into Safaricom’s plans for its data business. Voice and text were the first to plateau, before the telco turned to mobile money transfer services with M-Pesa. But that, too, looks like it has hit reached its elastic limit, with the firm now looking to data to maintain its growth trajectory. Ndegwa will be expected to pull off a miracle, and put into practise his MBA notes on crisis management. Further, as the first Kenyan at the helm of the telco, Ndegwa’s failure might just be seen as the country’s failure. Equally, his success will be the country’s success and a symbolic victory for corporate chiefs aspiring to lead regional giants. His two predecessors, Mr Joseph and Collymore, were foreigners. The former is South African, while the latter was a Guyanese-born Briton. The government has been keen to see a Kenyan take the corner office at Safaricom. After Collymore’s death, Kenya aggressively pushed for one of its own. “My wish is that a Kenyan gets the position, but we don’t control the business. We have appointed directors to run the business. It doesn’t mean that what the government wants is what it gets,” ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru said last year. But the government must have reached a middle ground with Safaricom, settling on a local with vast international exposure. Ndegwa was picked from Diageo, the UK alcoholic beverages giant, where he was the managing director for continental Europe, overseeing the brewer’s operations in 50 countries in Western and Eastern Europe, Russia, the Middle East and North Africa. The University of Nairobi economics graduate, who also holds an MBA from the London Business School, previously worked with East African Breweries Ltd (EABL) and is credited with being a key member of the team that came up with the popular low-end beer, Senator Keg, one of the brewer’s best-performing brands. The other big assignments that will top Ndegwa’s docket when he assumes office will be Safaricom’s expansion to Ethiopia and putting to rest the much talked about dominance claim that has been a thorny issue to manage. These could be among the things that are playing over and over on Ndegwa’s mind as he tries to figure out where to start in steering Safaricom through its next phase of growth, particularly in the face of a pandemic.While both Joseph and Collymore disliked the mention of ‘big shoes’ in reference to the CEO’s office, it will be a difficult conversation to avoid for Ndegwa. Critics will be looking to compare him against his two predecessors who have driven Safaricom to its current status as the most valuable company in the region. For this reason, the personal choices of the new CEO will be subject to scrutiny. Analysts note that the other issues he will have to grapple with include the headaches of losing key talent, a slowdown in innovation and a dip business as Kenya fights to survive the economic impact of coronavirus. The telecommunications company, which made Sh63 billion in the last financial year ending March 31, 2019, announced Ndegwa’s appointment in October last year. He takes over from Joseph, who stepped in on an interim capacity after Collymore’s death in July. The two former CEOs have set a high bar, and many see limited options for growth for a company that has spared little expense to stay ahead of the curve and diversify its services beyond the traditional bread-and-butter call business. Joseph took what was then a department within Telkom Kenya and in less than a decade transformed it to a regional giant. Other than a telecommunications firm, the firm played a key role in enhancing financial inclusion through M-Pesa, which it launched in 2007. By the time Joseph was handing over the firm to Collymore in November 2010, the company had just reported Sh15 billion in net profit for the year to March 2010, while revenues stood at Sh83 billion. Collymore faced his share of criticism and doubt as to whether he could grow and drive Safaricom beyond what Joseph had done. With time, however, he proved the naysayers wrong, growing the firm’s profitability to Sh63 billion in 2019. Over the decade Collymore steered Safaricom, revenues grew several times over to Sh240 billion recorded last year. He notably also strengthened institutions, which guaranteed the firm could function even when the man at the corner office was away. In his last year at Safaricom, Collymore was out of the office for extended periods of time as he sought treatment for acute myeloid leukemia abroad. As Ndegwa takes over, not only does he have the unfortunate task of matching his successors, and if possible outperforming their past achievements, he will also be under the constant scrutiny of the self-styled corporate dictator Joseph, who sits on the board that he will be reporting to regularly. The fruit that is perhaps the lowest hanging would be taking Safaricom outside Kenya. The firm is now eyeing entry into Ethiopia, where the government plans to open up the telecommunications market, which has Ethio Telecoms as the only operator. Whether through partnerships, partial acquisition of the current operator, or a greenfield operation, where Safaricom sets up and grows its own subsidiary from the ground up, it would be a major boost for the firm to tap into a share of the more than 100 million Ethiopians that are largely underserved.Safaricom has in the recent past said it has been in talks with Vodacom, its parent company, as well as two international banks to evaluate the mechanisms of getting into Ethiopia, including possibly bidding for some of the licences that will be up for grabs. Ethiopia has been planning to auction two telecommunications licences, and is looking to sell a 49 per cent stake in Ethio Telecom. “Ethiopia is just opening up its telecoms market, and Safaricom shareholders can reasonably expect gains from the massively underserved Ethiopian telecoms market, which boasts nearly double Kenya’s population and an economy that has recently surpassed Kenya’s in sheer size,” said Peter Wanyonyi, a telecoms analyst. Ndegwa also needs to ensure that he does not lose key people in his first year in office. Silha Rasugu of EFG Hermes noted that among the issues the new CEO must stay on top of is retaining talent, especially during the transition period. The other hurdle before Ndegwa are the unpredictable indirect taxes levied on mobile services and the industry in general. In many instances, the industry has been under the scrutiny of different regulators. Different issues attract different regulators, but the Communications Authority of Kenya and the Competition Authority of Kenya have recently come out strongly in a bid to oversee the firm’s operations, as well as how it relates with its customers.A recurring issue that has dogged Safaricom is talk of its dominance, and with it comes calls to increase regulatory oversight and even suggestions that it be split. A study by Analysys Mason commissioned by CA found Safaricom dominant in certain segments of the sector and recommended a raft of measures aimed at levelling the field, including separating the mobile money business from the telco. The firm has, however, fought the proposals, noting that it is tantamount to punishing success and would also punish its clientele as well as stifle innovation, discourage investment and reward competitors who failed to invest in their networks over time. According to Mr Rasugu, Ndegwa will have to be innovative in growing the numbers for Safaricom in a market that is nearly saturated, given Kenya’s mobile telecoms sector has “mobile penetration rates at 112 per cent”. “Competition for market share is expected to be more intense,” he added. Rasugu, however, said the fact that Ndegwa is Kenyan could work in his favour, considering reports that the government has been pushing for a local to be at the helm of the company. Other factors working for him include his having sold alcoholic beverages, and particularly the popular Senator Keg, which shares many similarities with Safaricom’s products, albeit the information age has made some of the telco’s product essentials, unlike beer that is seen as a luxury product. “He is a Kenyan CEO and the government being the largest shareholder, he should receive some support in form of goodwill from the legislature,” reckoned Rasugu. While Safaricom is still the market leader across the different industry segments that it operates in, it has been losing market share in terms of the total number of mobile subscribers.</p>

Leading national dailies on Tuesday, March 31, report that cases of coronavirus in the country are likely to shoot up to 10,000 by the end of April if more caution is not exercised by citizens.</p>
<p>The newspapers also lead with reports of special committees that have been formed to tackle the coronavirus menace after it emerged infections were no longer being imported but passed on locally.</p>

<p>Daily Nation reports that out of the 518 ICU beds available in the country, 87% of them (about 450) are occupied. Data shows that there are only 70 free ICU beds.</p>
<p>This shows that the country may be pushed off the cliff in case of a full-blown coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>Currently, the country has 50 cases but health officials have warned the number may spike to 10,000 by end of April 2020.</p>
<p>When it comes to ventilators, the country has 259 functional units and 140 of them are in use. This means 119 are available for use.</p>
<p>The government, however, indicated it was importing more even as global shortage continues to bite.</p>

<p>A police officer who was caught on camera assaulting an NTV cameraman has been summoned to Nairobi based Vigilance House (police headquarters) where his bosses will take action against him.</p>
<p>The officer identified as Onesmus Oyugi is likely to be dismissed from service, redeployed or demoted.</p>
<p>Oyugi assaulted cameraman Peter Wainaina who was covering kick-off of the 7pm to 5am curfew on Friday, March 27.</p>
<p>The night was punctuated by savage beating of civilians who did not manage to be indoors by the 7pm.</p>
<p>The Law Society of Kenya has since sued the state over the curfew and wants the kick-off time to be extended to 10pm.</p>
<p>The court, however, declined to suspend the curfew but asked police boss Hillary Mutyambai to publish guidelines.</p>
