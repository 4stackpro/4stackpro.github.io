<p>Los Angeles: “Modern Family” star Julie Bowen feels the industry isn’t very kind to women over 40, and that’s why it is important to step back a bit and explore the world behind the camera.</p>
<p>After wrapping up her act as Claire Dunphy on the hit “Modern Family”, the actress says she wants to produce shows including one on female friendship.</p>
<p>Asked what’s on her agenda after the show, Bowen said: “I am going to produce, do some directing. I am a real, I am a saver. I like a bargain, I don’t shop. I am a big saver because I don’t like that feeling of desperation waiting for the phone to ring like ‘somebody hire me’. I don’t like that. I am going to try and produce a comedy for ABC, about female friendship. And then I am going to try and produce some other stuff that I am not allowed to talk about. It’s a bit hush-hush.”</p>
<p>“Oh, and I am tired of being a mom. I mean I love it but do I want that to be my identity in the world? I would like to reclaim this situation for something other than mom-ing for a little while. I could just seal this up and never act again but I love acting,” she added.</p>
<p>Bowen continued: “Also I like these shorter formats that they have now, where you can be on a show for six episodes or do an anthology series. And yes, would surely do more behind the camera. I mean this is not a very kind business to women over 40 and I think that sometimes you do have to step away for a second and especially after doing eleven years of Claire. I love Claire but I can’t only be Claire.”</p>
<p>Created by Steven Levitan and Chistopher Lloyd, the show navigates the life of members of Pritchett family and won hearts for showing a diverse picture of an American family with themes around a gay couple, adoption, dating, young pregnancy and ethnicity running at its core. It is aired in India on Star World.</p>
<p>Talking about the legacy of the show, Bowen said: “There is so much! When we started there was no gay couple on television – a stable married gay couple on network television who had a child and that represented something so vastly different. It seems so normal now and I love that that’s been normalised and how we have almost forgotten how a big deal it was.”</p>
<p>“This is the show that people sit down and turn on for comfort and laugh. My kids and I sit down and watch so many amazing shows like ‘The Office’, ‘Friends’ or ‘Seinfeld’, and we are so lost in these. And that’s what I want is for people to go – ‘oh this feels like home’.”

<h3 id="what-modern-familys-sarah-hyland-says-about-working-with-julie-bowen-and-sofia-vergara">What ‘Modern Family’s’ Sarah Hyland Says About Working with Julie Bowen and Sofia Vergara</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Sarah-Hyland-of-22Modern-Family22-1.jpg" alt="img">
ABC’s hit show Modern Family aired its series finale last night, with viewers having to say goodbye to the multi-generational group of quirky characters. Sarah Hyland, who portrayed Haley Dunphy since the sitcom’s premiere, was just 18 years old when she began her role on the now infamous show.</p>
<p>The young actress recently shared and her thoughts on her journey through the series and the actresses she worked with who made an impact on her life.</p>

<p>Hyland heads west</p>
<p>Born and raised in New York, Hyland had gotten some acting gigs before her breakthrough role came along. Despite her mother’s protests, the actress decided to head to Los Angeles at an early age.</p>
<p>“I booked Modern Family in February 2009 after the show I was on, Lipstick Jungle, had gotten canceled,” Hyland told Glamour. “A few months prior, I’d decided to move to L.A., but my mom said, ‘No, you’re not. You don’t even have a driver’s license.’ I was determined, though.”</p>
<p>The sitcom star knew that there were more opportunities for her on the West Coast, prompting her to make the move and become a resident.</p>
<p>“I was always told that the reason I didn’t book roles in L.A. every pilot season was because I wasn’t a local hire,” she explained. “So in the span of a couple months, I learned how to drive, got my driver’s license, and moved to California.”</p>
<p>Mama Bowen</p>
<p>Playing the part of a self-centered teenager who enters college, the business world, then gets married and has twins, Hyland had her work cut out for her in portraying her character’s evolvement. With Julie Bowen playing her mother Claire and Sofia Vergara portraying her grandfather’s wife, the young actress shared her gratitude for the significant roles they played in her real life.</p>
<p>“The show is a male-dominant cast, really, so the female relationships have meant so much to me,” Hyland said. “It’s been amazing to have Julie Bowen and Sofia Vergara to look up to as role models because they’re so funny, smart, talented, and kind.”</p>
<p>Though Bowen played Hyland’s on-screen mom, the Modern Family star revealed that the actress’s maternal demeanor would continue even when the cameras stopped rolling.</p>
<p>“Julie has been like a mother to me over the past 11 years. She is one of the strongest, smartest, most opinionated women I’ve ever met,” Hyland gushed. “But she is smart about being opinionated. There’s a time and a place for things, and I’m still learning how to master that because I have no filter. She’s taught me how to keep, at times, my mouth shut.”</p>
<p>Hyland clearly admires Bowen for her tenacity and intellect. “Watching her in interviews, in work settings—really just in life—her brain is the most fascinating thing to me,” she said.</p>
<p>Beauty tips from Vergara and a shout out to ‘sis’</p>
<p>Hyland also got close with Vergara over the years, where she praised her co-star for giving her some vital glamour tips.</p>
<p>“Sofia taught me how to overdraw my lips with liner. It works! You get a good nude lip liner… and Chapstick over it,” she shared. “It looks so natural.”</p>
<p>Portraying her on-screen sister Alex Dunphy, Ariel Winter also grew up on the show.</p>
<p>“It’s also been amazing to see Ariel Winter turn into a beautiful, strong, opinionated, smart woman as well,” Hyland raved of her ‘sister.’ “Ariel has taught me a lot of lingo and what the hip new thing is to say, so I rely on her to keep me young. Now that I don’t see her every week, I’m turning into my mother. It’s already happened.”</p>
<p>Though Modern Family has ended filming, fans can still get their fix thanks to streaming services and syndication.

<h3 id="actress-julie-bowen-on-teaching-her-kids-to-sneeze-embracing-aging-and-saying-farewell-to-her-modern-family">Actress Julie Bowen on Teaching Her Kids to Sneeze, Embracing Aging and Saying Farewell to Her Modern Family</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.parade.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/julie-bowen-modern-family-ftr.jpg" alt="img">
After 11 seasons of playing Claire Dunphy on Modern Family, you can understand why fans ask actress Julie Bowen if she’s just like the TV mom she plays. “I’m like, ‘Well, I look kind of like her and we talk the same, but we’re also different. For instance, she can day drink and I cannot.’ Wine makes me sleepy. I wish I had her skills!” Bowen says.</p>
<p>Truth be told, there are similarities. The 50-year-old Emmy winner is a mom to Oliver, 12, and 10-year-old twins, John and Gustav, and she’s the first to admit that sometimes, real life seems like a comedy: “The number of times I’ve had to teach my children how to sneeze…it’s unbelievable. Every sneeze is like the first time they’ve sneezed.”</p>
<p>Bowen is not a germaphobe, but she’s keen on common-sense ways to stay well. That includes getting the flu vaccine (she’s a spokesperson for Xofluza, a single-dose influenza treatment) and not tempting fate: “There’s a door to stage 5 where we shoot Modern Family, and I’m not going to touch that doorknob because it gets about 3,000 hands a day,” she says.</p>
<p>In addition to helping her family and others make it through flu season unscathed, the actress is wrapping her head around the end of a Modern Family era. The show’s final episode is April 8, and although Bowen isn’t quite ready to move out of the Dunphy house for good, she’s thankful to have been a part of the award-winning project. Spry Living caught up with Bowen to discuss closing a major acting chapter and what her wellness routine looks like at 50.</p>
<p>What are you thankful to Claire for teaching you?</p>
<p>Claire taught me how to parent. She had older children when we started, and mine were babies. I was fed the wisdom of the writer’s room and got to learn with these fake children at work. I’ve gotten to watch them grow up, and they have turned out so beautifully if I do say so myself! It’s given me a lot of confidence as a parent. You’re not supposed to be their best friend when they’re little—I got that from Claire. But then I get to look down the pipeline and go, “Hey, Claire gets to hang out with her kids and actually enjoy them. Maybe I will too someday when I don’t have to be the limits-and-boundaries person.”</p>

<p>What will you miss about Modern Family?</p>
<p>Oh my God, everything. The friendship, the easy camaraderie, the fact that I have a job. People are like, “You’re not very social.” But I laugh with my friends at work all day. I don’t need to go to a party on the weekends because I have this crazy job that is a party.</p>
<p>Do you have any diet guidelines you live by?</p>
<p>I eat really clean and have pretty simple rules: I try not to eat white food, like white rice, pasta and white bread. There aren’t really any white foods that are good for you when you think about it. Marshmallows? Powdered sugar? Nope. I also like to see the ingredients. If it’s complicated to the point that I don’t know what’s in it, I’m not interested in eating it.</p>
<p>What would you tell your younger self?</p>
<p>I turned 50 in early March, and the clichés about aging are so true. Sometimes, I wish I could put my current brain in my 20-year-old body and say, “Do not worry about all this crap. Do not worry about money or meeting the right person.” I don’t know if it’s exhaustion or wisdom, but the end product is an intelligence that comes from being older. I’m not as quick to get upset about things. I’m still an emotional person, and I’m happy about that—I’ve made money off of it! But I don’t feel like it has to drive me every day.</p>
<p>Do you practice any yoga or self-care to get in a certain mindset?</p>
<p>I’ve never admitted this publicly, but I started meditating last year. I’m afraid to talk about it because I feel like I caught some lightning in a bottle. I just decided I was going to count my breaths one day. I thought, “Well, I’ll count to 100 breaths. I’m not going to think about whether or not I’m doing it right.” I thought it would probably take like seven minutes. I did it and looked at my watch, and it was 24 minutes later! I can’t deny that something happened. That drove me to research it, and after reading about what meditation does to your brain, I was like, “I’m in!”</p>
<p>Is there anything you worry about when it comes to getting older?</p>
<p>I find it disconcerting that 60-year-olds look like 30-year-olds. They do look great! And yes, 50 percent of me wants to do exactly that, but the other 50 percent of me wants to do absolutely nothing and just melt like a proper old lady. As long as I can create work for myself, either as an actor or director or producer, I don’t have to fight the clock as far as not being 25 years old.</p>
<p>What do your sleeping and bedtime routines look like?</p>
<p>I’m not a good sleeper, and I know you’re not supposed to sleep with your iPad, but I do. And I have a really bizarre online shopping habit. At 3 a.m., I’ll read the news, look at some shopping website and fill my cart. But I won’t buy anything. Then, like, two nights later, if I’m back on that website and still like the stuff, I’ll consider it. I love a bargain. Nordstrom Rack is my jam, and I also like Poshmark.</p>
<p>Will you take anything as a keepsake from the Modern Family set?</p>
<p>There are some really ugly things in the Dunphy house that I’ve made fun of for years that are so Dunphy. There’s a calendar in the kitchen that hasn’t turned the page since season one, and I know every item on it. I’m not going to take the Dunphy couch though—I think it has a wooden board inside to keep it up at this point because it’s so saggy. There’s a hallway that we very seldom shoot in, but we’re often standing in it just before we enter the kitchen on set. And there are two drawings of birds. I’ve spent countless hours staring at those birds, so I think that’s something I would take. It reminds me of this little corner of the set where I’ve spent so much time.</p>

<p>What does your daily routine or look consist of?</p>
<p>My sisters and cousins call me “Derelicte” [from Zoolander] when I have to dress myself. I get up in the morning, and I’m always dressed for a run. I don’t know when that run is going to happen. It might not happen until 6 o’clock at night. I don’t do cute workout clothes because I’m all about comfort, and so they’re stuck with what they call “the homeless athlete” for the rest of the day. I’ll be wearing a parka that I stole from set because I burned it on one of the space heaters (I’ve put duct tape over the hole), running tights and sneakers.</p>
<p>With so many boys In the house, do you manage any time alone?</p>
<p>I live in a house with so much testosterone. As a joke, I will sometimes be like, “Doesn’t anyone want a manicure?” “Does anyone want to have a spa day and do Korean sheet masks together?” They all say no. The reality is I’ve never been a super girly girl, and so the boy energy sort of works for me, but it’s exhausting. There are times when I just go, “I can’t watch this show where everyone is being blown up or I can’t listen to this music. Enough!” But I find if I turn the TV off and start reading, they all come and snuggle around. But I’m finally starting to carve out some “me time” as a mom of three. I found out that legally your kids are allowed to be in the house alone for up to an hour. I was like, “You mean I can go for a run with the alarm on and lock the door, and I’m not going to get arrested?” I tell them, “No cooking, no fighting,” and I go. That changed everything. And because they’re older now, I’m not on deathwatch anymore. I can go and lay down and read. I set my alarm for when it’s time to get up and make dinner. Those little windows are great. There aren’t many, but they’re great.</p>

<p>You’re a Xofluza spokesperson. Why did you decide to partner with them?</p>
<p>The flu is tough, and vaccination is not 100 percent. But it’s great to know that there are ways to treat it. I didn’t realize there were options until Genentech came to me with the Xofluza partnership. My sister is an infectious disease doctor. I vet everything medical through her, and she (in the very nerdy way that only an infectious disease doctor can get excited) clapped her hands and said, “do it!” It’s a single-dose treatment, and I am all about efficiency. I have three children and a full-time job. I do not have a lot of time for complicated chemistry.</p>
<p>I am also a really grumpy sick person. I’m a cave dweller. I close myself in the room. I don’t want to see people. I don’t want to talk to people. I don’t have to get waited on hand and foot, but I am not pleasant to be around either—I’m the first to admit it. That’s the number one reason right there to get a flu shot: you don’t want to be around a grumpy person!</p>
<p>Are you a big germaphobe?</p>
<p>In general, I’m not. But there is a door to Stage 5 at Fox where we shoot Modern Family, and I’m not going to touch that doorknob because it gets about 3,000 hands a day. I’m not Superman. I’m not tempting fate. But otherwise, I use common sense precautions. I don’t wrap my children in Saran Wrap, but there are some delightful hand sanitizers that don’t smell like death. There’s one I have that smells like lavender.</p>
<p>Do you feel like you’re getting sick often, or are you pretty good at taking care of yourself?</p>
<p>I’ve always felt sort of impervious to pain and illness and injury. But it’s weird as you get older. I’ve just gone running, and it hurts. And now I’m finding that this whole concept of self-care is for real. You can’t do things in your late 40s that you could do in your late 20s, like just push through a run when it hurts. Cause if you do, it’s going to hurt for like a month. I definitely have had to incorporate taking care of myself into my fitness regime, which I always thought was kind of silly. I ride a bike a lot. I mix in running, swimming, all kinds of things because just one thing and the body gets mad.</p>
<p>Do you ever deal with insecurity?</p>
<p>My stomach from the twins is a hot mess, and I battle all the time with this. I’ve had doctors tell me that I have a hernia and split muscles from carrying twins, and it medically needs to be corrected. But I’m like, “if I do it, will I regret it?” I wouldn’t debate it if it was painful or if I had to fix it because I couldn’t go running or something. It just doesn’t look delightful. I definitely don’t wear bikinis. But there’s also part of me that wants to fight fixing it because it feels like I’m giving in. That’s where I am. I’m on the fence. Ask me in six months!</p>
