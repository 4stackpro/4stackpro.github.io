<p>MUMBAI, India (AP) — Popular Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his Mumbai residence on Sunday, police and Indian media reports said.</p>
<p>Initial reports citing police said the 34-year-old actor was found hanging in his apartment in suburban Bandra.</p>
<p>Mumbai police spokesperson Pranaya Ashok confirmed the death and said details were being investigated.</p>
<p>Rajput, who started as a TV actor, made his Bollywood debut in 2013 with director Abhishek Kapoor in “Kai Po Che,&rdquo; based on the book by Chetan Bhagat.</p>
<p>Social media was flooded with condolences for the actor, with many reacting to the news with disbelief.</p>
<p>“Sushant Singh Rajput&hellip;a bright young actor gone too soon,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted. “He excelled on TV and in films. His rise in the world of entertainment inspired many and he leaves behind several memorable performances. Shocked by his passing away. My thoughts are with his family and fans. Om Shanti.”</p>
<p>Bollywood star Akshay Kumar wrote on Twitter, “Honestly this news has left me shocked and speechless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“I can’t believe this at all&hellip; it’s shocking&hellip; a beautiful actor and a good friend&hellip; it’s disheartening,” actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui tweeted.</p>
<p>Rajput played former Indian cricket team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the 2016 film “M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story.” Among his other movies are “Kedarnath, Sonchiriya” (Golden Bird) and “Raabta” (Connection).</p>
<p>He was last seen in the 2019 Netflix film “Drive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mumbai, India’s financial hub and home to Bollywood, has been grappling with the coronavirus pandemic, which has brought the business of entertainment to a complete halt in the country.

<p><img src="https://img.republicworld.com/republic-prod/stories/promolarge/xxhdpi/u9nttng8lp3drcmq_1592144444.jpeg?tr=f-jpeg" alt="img">
Harbhajan Singh has come forward and revealed that Australian skipper Ricky Ponting acted like an umpire himself during that infamous Sydney Test match in January 2008 where the &lsquo;Monkeygate&rsquo; incident had taken place. Kumble was the Test captain back then.</p>
<p>It so happened that star off-spinner Harbhajan Singh and all-rounder Andrew Symonds were involved in a heated exchange during that contest and when Bhajji had used a cuss word in Hindi, the Australians misunderstood him and thought that he had racially abused Symonds by calling him a &lsquo;Monkey&rsquo;.</p>

<p>&lsquo;When I talk about the 2008 Test&hellip;': Harbhajan Singh</p>
<p>While interacting with the cricketer-turned-commentator/analyst Aakash Chopra on his official YouTube channel, Harbhajan went on to say when he talks about the 2008 Test against Australia in Sydney, he reckons in that match, Ricky Ponting was the umpire himself, he was claiming catches and then was pronouncing the verdict. He then mentioned that Australians say what happens on the ground should stay on the ground, but the incident that happened between himself and Andrew Symonds went beyond the ground.</p>
<p>Apart from the &lsquo;Monkeygate&rsquo; scandal, the Test match was also known for some horrendous umpiring where all the decisions had gone against India and in favour of the hosts which eventually cost the Anil Kumble-led side the match. Nonetheless, a spirited Indian team settled scores when they beat Ponting &amp; Co. in the following Test match at Perth.</p>

<h3 id="sushant-singh-rajput-on-metoo-allegations-felt-bad-misunderstood">&ldquo;Sushant Singh Rajput on #MeToo allegations: Felt bad, misunderstood&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/201901/suh-647x363.jpeg?41QuVifDFvuv7lWaAlDgg4ktPt0dAnL5" alt="img">
Sushant Singh Rajput opens up about the #MeToo movement and how he was wrongly accused, and that he felt bad and misunderstood. He had been accused of misbehaving with Kizzie aur Manny co-star Sanjana Sanghi.</p>
<p>The #MeToo movement erupted in 2018 and its effects were spread across India. Several powerful men from different fields were called out for inappropriate sexual misconduct and harassment. Many women shared their horrifying stories on social media. Popular celebrities like Nana Patekar, Sajid Khan, Rajat Kapoor and Subhash Ghai were accused of sexual misconduct.</p>
<p>Earlier in August, rumours started doing the rounds that Sushant Singh Rajput was making his Kizzie Aur Manny co-star Sanjana Sanghi uncomfortable. The issue emerged again in October, during the #MeToo movement. Sushant was accused of sexual harassment. To prove his innocence, Sushant shared screenshots of conversations with Sanjana. Before temporarily deactivating his Twitter account, he had written,</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last thing worth doing is to defend yourself of the fiction created by an agenda. People using this much required campaign for their personal agenda is too much to ignore. So here is the text conversation with Sanjana till the time I shot for the film. I let you decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shared screenshots of his conversation with Sanjana on Instagram as well. &ldquo;I feel sad to reveal personal information but it seems that there is no other way to state what actually happened, in the midst of this curated, well timed and agenda driver smear campaign. From the first day of the shoot till the last day, this is what happened on the sets with Sanjana. Misconduct ? Not at al. Agenda ? You decide,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>Sanjana later confirmed that there was no truth to the accusatory reports.</p>
<p>Speaking about this to a portal, Sushant said, &ldquo;It was paradoxical because it [the #MeToo movement] was something that I stand for. I happened to be one of the intentional and strategic casualties. Many paid campaigners were used to give it a burst. I felt bad and misunderstood. The more it gets written about, the more it damages my reputation, which I have worked hard to build. The movement is a good thing. It is all about changing mindsets.</p>
<p>The director of the film Mukesh Chhabra, who himself was accused of inappropriate behaviour, said that no such incident took place between Sushant and Sanjana.

<p>Updated: Oct 23, 2018 17:53 IST</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput’s Kizie Aur Manny co-star, Sanjana Sanghi, has reacted to the ongoing controversy surrounding the film. Sanjana took to Twitter on Tuesday and dismissed the ‘baseless and unfounded stories’ that have been doing the rounds online regarding the on-set harassment she faced at the hands of Sushant.</p>
<p>“I’d like to clarify that no such incident took place with me. Let’s put an end to these conjectures,” she wrote, explaining that the delay in her response was because she was abroad.</p>
<p>A few days ago, it was reported (not for the first time) that Sushant had made Sanjana feel uncomfortable on set with his ‘overfriendly’ nature. Sushant responded by denying any misconduct, and shared screenshots of the text conversations they’d had during the course of filming the movie, an official remake of Hollywood hit The Fault in Our Stars.</p>
<p>“The last thing worth doing is to defend yourself of the fiction created by an agenda. People using this much required campaign for their personal agenda is too much to ignore. So here is the text conversation with Sanjana till the time I shot for the film. I let you decide,” he wrote in a tweet shared on Thursday night. He later deleted the tweet. “I feel sad to reveal personal information but it seems that there is no other way to state what was, in the midst of this curated and well timed smear campaign. From the first till the last day of the shoot, this is what happened on the Set with Sanjana,” he continued.</p>

<p>An August report in DNA quoted a source as saying, “Sushant was trying to be ‘extra-friendly’ towards newbie Sanjana Sanghi. On one occasion, she seemed to have got uncomfortable and apparently brought it to the notice of her parents, who reportedly told her to return to the set only if she felt she should. One hears that as of now, shooting has come to a standstill.”</p>
<p>In addition to this, the film’s director, Mukesh Chhabra, has been accused by multiple women of sexual harassment. Fox Star Studios have suspended him pending investigation. “As a responsible organization, Star India takes any allegation of sexual harassment of women at workplace very seriously hence Fox Star Studios has suspended the services of Mukesh Chhabra, director of our film, Kizie Aur Manny, which is under production, till the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) of M/s Mukesh Chhabra Casting Company concludes its inquiry into the allegations against him,” their statement read.</p>

A couple of months ago, there were reports that Sushant Singh Rajput had made his Kizie Aur Manny co-star Sanjana Sanghi uncomfortable, with his &ldquo;over-friendliness&rdquo; and flirtatious banter. Director Mukesh Chhabra had rubbished the reports at the time, and said nothing of the sort had happened.</p>
<p>Recently, the reports started doing the rounds again, that Sushant would try to flirt with Sanjana on the film sets. According to the report, when she complained to Chhabra, he brushed it off.</p>
<p>Going with the #MeToo flow, Twitter users began to accuse Sushant of sexual harassment. An upset Sushant tweeted before going off Twitter,</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last thing worth doing is to defend yourself of the fiction created by an agenda. People using this much required campaign for their personal agenda is too much to ignore. So here is the text conversation with Sanjana till the time I shot for the film. I let you decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shared screenshots of his conversation with Sanjana on Instagram as well. &ldquo;I feel sad to reveal personal information but it seems that there is no other way to state what actually happened, in the midst of this curated, well timed and agenda driver smear campaign. From the first day of the shoot till the last day, this is what happened on the sets with Sanjana. Misconduct ? Not at al. Agenda ? You decide,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>In one chat, Sushant wrote, &ldquo;Hey just wanted to tell you that despite of everything that&rsquo;s so not conducive for actors on set, what you&rsquo;re doing is nothing short of f***ing epic. Good going girl.&rdquo; Sanjana responded to the message with a text that read, &ldquo;A whole lot of non conducive conditions, yes. Thank you so much Immanuel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In one message Sanjana had written, &ldquo;Performing with you today was a treat. Those words will always stick with you, thank you so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mukesh Chhabra tweeted in Sushant&rsquo;s defence and said, &ldquo;I totally stand by @itsSSR - no such incident happened on the sets and let&rsquo;s not have a Twitter trial and make an innocent person suffer for somebody else&rsquo;s ulterior motives I had clarified this on twitter long back and I still maintain it.&rdquo;</p>
