Image caption The gurdwara in Gravesend would normally be decorated for Vaisakhi</p>
<p>Celebrations to mark one of the most important dates in the Sikh calendar have been cancelled or postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Vaisakhi, which this year falls on Monday, commemorates the creation of the Khalsa, a collective body of initiated Sikhs.</p>
<p>In past years, thousands have gathered in the towns and cities that are home to England&rsquo;s largest Sikh communities.</p>
<p>But now gurdwaras have found ways to take Vaisakhi into people&rsquo;s homes.</p>
<p>Two of the biggest events that would have been held later this month were in London&rsquo;s Trafalgar Square, where more than 30,000 have gathered in past years, and Birmingham&rsquo;s Handsworth Park, where up to 100,000 people were expected.</p>
<p>Celebrations in Leicester, Southall and Gravesend have also been brought to a halt.</p>
<p>In London, cultural advisor to the mayor, Manraj Singh Othi, said while Vaisakhi had brought together Londoners, Sikhs and non-Sikhs alike, public safety came first.</p>
<p>Those feelings were echoed by the Council of Sikh Gurdwaras in Birmingham - and in Southall, west London, gurdwara general secretary Navraj Singh added: &ldquo;No event in the Sikh calendar should endanger lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Image caption Vaisakhi commemorates the creation of the Khalsa, a collective body of initiated Sikhs</p>
<p>At any other time, celebrations would have included colourful street processions, or nagar kirtans, and free food, or langar, as well as cultural activities including arts, crafts, entertainment and martial arts.</p>
<p>But this year, religious worship has moved online and the Sikh practice of offering food was set to be taken out to the community, as people self-isolated and stayed at home.</p>
<p>In Leicester, that initiative has been backed by the Leicestershire Police Sikh Association, which has been helping to cook and deliver meals, distributing between 300 and 400 meals to people each day.</p>
<p>Image caption Offering free food, or langar, is a tradition in the Sikh faith</p>
<p>Meanwhile virtual worship included prayers direct from the Golden Temple in Amritsar streamed by Sikh2Inspire, meditation and talks by Basics of Sikhi, and a digital mass prayer on Monday, organised by Digi Sangat.</p>
<p>But there have still been mixed feelings.</p>
<p>In Hayes, also in west London, volunteer Sundeep Kaur Gosal said she missed the vulnerable people she would usually help with her &ldquo;mind and heart&rdquo;, while Nari Sohal, from Slough, who volunteers for the charity Swat, said: &ldquo;Life feels like it&rsquo;s at a standstill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, as reports emerged that ethnic minority communities were being hit hardest by covid-19, Harjinder Panesar, chairwoman of Harrow Sikhs, said she was relieved events had been cancelled, adding: &ldquo;We can return next year when we have a vaccination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sukhjeevan Singh, from the Sikh Council UK, said special food production guidance compiled by the Sikh Doctors Association had been issued to gurdwaras during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Before the covid-19 crisis, gurdwaras already had &ldquo;langar-managers&rdquo; who had food hygiene training, allergen awareness, and food handling and hygiene policies in place, he added.</p>
<p>He said gurdwaras serving langar registered their facilities with their local authorities in a similar way to restaurants.</p>
<p>Image caption Street processions have been cancelled this year</p>
<p>In Gravesend, Kent, the gurdwara had expected about 10,000 people to celebrate Vaisakhi.</p>
<p>Newly-elected president Manpreet Singh Dhaliwal said, along with the virtual prayers and food deliveries, the gurdwara had been taking langar to NHS workers in several hospitals nearby.</p>
<p>Gravesend priest Giani Amerjit Singh said it was to say &ldquo;thank you to all these people working on the frontline&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Hardev Singh Sohal, from Liverpool&rsquo;s United Sikh Association and Guru Nanak Gurdwara, said: &ldquo;We believe the whole human race is one. We are all equal. Our religion believes in service and humanity. We help everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said all gurdwaras in Liverpool remained closed and this year he would be spending Vaisakhi at home with his daughter.</p>

<p>Updated: Apr 13, 2020 07:20 IST</p>
<p>Festivals are being celebrated in a different manner this year due to the ongoing pandemic. It’s not possible to step out and continue with the regular celebrations for different festivals. But there’s still one way to do it and that’s online. Keeping in mind the spring and harvest season, Snapchat has introduced dedicated lenses for these festivals.</p>
<p>Snapchat’s new festive lenses will be available for users based on the region where the festival is taking place. Users can find these lenses by scrolling through the different lenses at the bottom on the Snapchat app. Depending on which region the festival is celebrated, Snapchat will feature an AR lens. Users can try out these lenses and share them along with their festive greetings.</p>
<p>Snapchat has listed out the different festivals taking place in India starting today which is Vaisakhi celebrated in North and West India. Then there’s Pana Sankranti which is celebrated in Odisha. The next day on April 14 it’s Puthandu which marks the first day of the traditional Tamil calendar. People in Kerala will be celebrating Vishu which is a Hindu festival.</p>
<p>Celebrations towards the East will take place in Assam where people will celebrate Rongali Bihu on April 14. This festival spans for seven days with each day having a different significance. Then there’s Pahela Baishakh which will take place in West Bengal and Tripura.</p>
<p>These Snapchat lenses carry the festival greeting like “Happy Rongali Bihu” and “Happy Vaisakhi”. The lenses also have filter effects along with the greeting message.

<h3 id="prime-minister-scott-morrison-sends-greetings-on-vaisakhi">Prime Minister Scott Morrison sends greetings on Vaisakhi</h3>
<p><img src="https://sl.sbs.com.au/public/image/file/620c502b-f6bd-4ed5-bea1-b99cf89d5d07/crop/16x9" alt="img">
Vaisakhi is the most important Sikh festival that is usually celebrated on April 13 or 14 every year.</p>
<p>It commemorates the formation of the Khalsa (the pure), by the tenth Sikh master, Guru Gobind Singh in the year 1699.</p>
<p>It also marks the Sikh new year and is a spring harvest festival celebrated in Punjab and many other parts of northern India.</p>
<p>AAP</p>
<p>In his statement, PM Scott Morrison sent his best wishes to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish the Australian Sikh community the best for the year ahead, and thank you for all you give to Australia - the special place we call home,” he said in the statement.</p>
<p>He also praised the Sikh community for their &ldquo;support&rdquo; and the &ldquo;values&rdquo; it upholds.</p>
<p>“At a time like this, we all depend on the values of care and concern, generosity and respect that I know the Sikh community upholds. Such values also give me great confidence that our nation will get through this,” he added.</p>
<p>Supplied</p>
<p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison issued the following statement on the occasion of Vaisakhi:</p>
<p>Baisakhi is usually a time for the Sikh community to rejoice in its most cherished traditions: a time of renewal, refreshment and of joy and devotion.</p>
<p>But recent months have presented significant challenges for our nation - in the form of drought, bushfires, and now a global health crisis.</p>
<p>These things have challenged us and different ways, and call on our strength, unity and resilience.</p>
<p>Coronavirus is a once in one hundred year event. It requires us all to look out for each other and support each other, so that we can get through this together.</p>
<p>All of us have a role to play in keeping our communities safe: employers, nurses, doctors, teachers, scientists, friends, family and neighbours. I know that we will all do our bit.</p>
<p>At a time like this, we all depend on the values of care and concern, generosity and respect that I know the Sikh community upholds. Such values also give me great confidence that our nation will get through this.</p>
<p>Life has changed. It will continue to change as we go through these many months ahead.</p>
<p>We are an incredible country - and working together with an incredible sense of purpose, unity and co-operation.</p>
<p>We have a long way to go, but we can draw strength from the common sense, endurance, resilience, and simple human kindness of the Australian community.</p>
<p>We will get through this. On the other side, we will bounce back strongly because of the work we are all doing and the values we hold dear.</p>
<p>So I wish the Australian Sikh community the best for the year ahead, and thank you for all you give to Australia - the special place we call home.</p>
<p>According to the latest census, Sikhism has nearly 126,000 followers in Australia, making it now the fifth largest religion of the country, after Christianity, Islam, Buddhism and Hinduism.</p>
<p>The number of Sikhs in Australia has almost doubled in the last five years from 72,296 counted in the last Census.</p>
<p>Supplied</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the celebrations to mark one of the most important dates in the Sikh calendar stand cancelled or postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>In the past, thousands have gathered in the towns and cities that are home to Australia&rsquo;s largest Sikh communities.</p>
<p>Many gurudwaras (Sikh temples) have moved online to broadcast rituals and other events as people self-isolate and stay at home.</p>
<p>Coronavirus symptoms can range from mild illness to pneumonia, according to the Federal Government&rsquo;s website. Symptoms can include a fever, coughing, sore throat, fatigue and shortness of breath.</p>
<p>If you develop symptoms within 14 days of returning from overseas, you should call to seek medical attention.</p>
<p>If you don’t have symptoms but you have been in contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case, you should also call to seek medical attention.</p>
<p>If you believe you may need to get tested, call your doctor, don’t visit. Or contact the national Coronavirus Health Information Hotline on 1800 020 080.</p>
<p>If you are struggling to breathe or experiencing a medical emergency, call 000.</p>
