<p>News 12 NBC 26</p>
<p>AUGUSTA, Ga. (WRDW/WAGT) - It&rsquo;s an order many have been waiting for: a shelter-in-place. But, the public will have to wait until tomorrow to know exactly what it means.</p>
<p>Gov. Kemp announced the decision this afternoon and will release full details on Thursday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it look like?&rdquo; Doug Duncan, Chairman of Columbia County Government, said. As soon as we get a copy of the order, we&rsquo;ll step in place, take our time to understand exactly what it says. But, we&rsquo;ll implement it very quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Multiple states have already implemented stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders, which have led to all non-essential businesses to close. Essential stores such as grocery stores, gas stations and pharmacies will remain open for the public to shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grocery stores are going to stay open. Don&rsquo;t rush out. Don&rsquo;t buy $500 worth of groceries thinking there won&rsquo;t be food on the shelves,&rdquo; Duncan said.</p>
<p>A shelter-in-place order does not mean people can&rsquo;t leave their homes. People can still shop, order takeout from restaurants, or even go outside to exercise.</p>
<p>But officials have suggested seeing friends and family isn&rsquo;t allowed, unless it&rsquo;s absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay calm. Do your part. Don&rsquo;t hoard, and everything is going to be fine,&rdquo; Duncan said.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s two weeks of shelter that will hopefully help flatten the curve.</p>
<p>Gov. Kemp is expected to sign and publish the order tomorrow. The order will have more details, so the public can get prepared before it goes into effect Friday.

<p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106466833-158558510640620200330_state_restrictions12pm.png?v=1585585120" alt="img">
Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said Wednesday that he will be implementing a &ldquo;shelter-in-place&rdquo; order for the entire state. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, also issued statewide orders Wednesday mandating all residents stay at home during the coronavirus outbreak. Georgia, Florida and Pennsylvania join the majority of states — including the hardest-hit, New York, New Jersey, California and Washington — in implementing restrictions on people&rsquo;s movements in an attempt to keep the virus from spreading further. The U.S. has the most COVID-19 cases of any country, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, with more than 190,000 confirmed cases of the virus and at least 4,100 deaths. More restrictions are expected to be implemented this week. Here are the states that announced restrictions Wednesday. This list will be updated throughout the day:</p>

<p>Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said Wednesday that he will sign a statewide shelter-in-place order on Thursday. The order will go into effect Friday and extend through April 13. Kemp said that the recent CDC announcement that people can become infected with the coronavirus and spread it while asymptomatic earlier than what was previously thought influenced his decision to enact a shelter-in-place order. He also said that Georgia needs more time to prepare its hospital capacity for a surge of patients. &ldquo;All of us know that this fight is won at the community level,&rdquo; Kemp said at a press briefing Wednesday. Kemp said that those who do follow state and local directives regarding the coronavirus will face stiff penalties. He also announced that schools will remain closed until the end of the academic year. Georgia currently has 4,638 cases of the coronavirus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf issued a statewide stay-at-home order Wednesday that will last until at least April 30. Previously, only select counties in Pennsylvania were under stay-at-home orders from the governor. The new order goes into effect Wednesday at 8:00 pm. &ldquo;We appreciate the shared sacrifice of all 12.8 million Pennsylvanians; we are in this together,&rdquo; Wolf said in a statement. Residents can leave their homes for essential reasons such as getting food or medicine, or caring for a sick relative. Pennsylvania currently has 4,994 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.</p>

<p>April 1, 2020</p>
<p>THOMASVILLE, Ga. (WCTV) &ndash; Georgia Governor Brian Kemp announced he will sign an Executive Order on Thursday that will implement a state-wide shelter-in-place. More details will be released on Thursday before it begins on Friday, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m making sure I have all the necessities, like laundry detergent,&rdquo; said Peggy Benton, who lives in Cairo. &ldquo;I felt like they should have already done it, but at least this way, people will take it seriously,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Benton was shopping in Thomasville Wednesday night, where many people said they were preparing for whatever the order could state.</p>
<p>Water, toilet paper, if I can find any, and Tylenol,&rdquo; listed D.J. Folsom.</p>
<p>Folsom said he lives in Tallahassee, but commutes to Georgia for work. He was trying to pick up last-minute items he could not find near home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a really good idea,&rdquo; said Thomasville resident Clay Myers. &ldquo;A lot of people are making unnecessary trips to the store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to guidelines posted by the CDC guidelines, a shelter-in-place means you need to get inside with supplies and pets, find a safe spot, then stay put.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s not yet known what those guidelines will be in the Governor&rsquo;s order, he stated during an Atlanta news conference that they will be streamlined throughout the state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are taking action to protect our hospitals, help our medical providers and prepare for the patient surge we know is coming,&rdquo; he said Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Valdosta resident Peedy Wee says he does not agree with the order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s going overboard with, &lsquo;you gotta stay in the house,'&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>However, the majority of people said they did support the idea, including at least one local business owner who has been impacted by statewide mandates already.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that all of us are going through a hard time, but we need to remember that as a community, it&rsquo;s going to take sacrifice,&rdquo; said Tara Reed.</p>
<p>The Thomasville Police Department said they are waiting to hear what the details will be before commenting on how they will enforce it.</p>
<p>A Thomasville City Commissioner said the Governo&rsquo;s announcements were not a total surprise given the influx of cases seen at Archbold Medical Center alone.
