Bobby Davro is one of four famous faces taking on the Chaser in this afternoon&rsquo;s The Chase Celebrity Special. Alongside Katherine Ryan, George Shelley and Faye Brookes, Bobby will be putting his knowledge to the test in the hopes of winning some money for charity.</p>
<p>The Chase sees hopefuls go head to head against one of the six professional quizzers - or chasers as they are better known - in an attempt to bank money for their team.</p>
<p>With a series of question on any topic imaginable, the contestants must try and pick the right answer to stay ahead of the chaser.</p>
<p>If the chaser catches them, they are out of the game and the money won&rsquo;t be added to the prize pot.</p>
<p>In the final round, contestants work together to answer as many questions as possible, hoping to beat the number of questions answered by the chaser.</p>

<h3 id="faye-brookes-boyfriend-is-faye-brookes-dating-anyone">Faye Brookes boyfriend: Is Faye Brookes dating anyone?</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/79/750x445/1273652.jpg" alt="img">
Former Coronation Street actress Faye Brookes will be battling it out against one of the UK’s top quiz brains this evening at 5pm in a celebrity special of The Chase, hosted by another former Corrie star Bradley Walsh. The 32-year-old actress will star alongside comedian Katherine Ryan, singer George Shelley and comedian Bobby Davro.</p>
<p>Who is Faye Brookes dating?</p>
<p>Faye Brookes first went public with her current boyfriend Joe Davis, a personal trainer from Manchester, in December.</p>
<p>Joe is a personal trainer at the Manchester branch of Barry’s Bootcamp - an all body intensive workout craze that claims to be able to burn 2000 calories in a single one-hour session.</p>
<p>After she was pictured with him shortly after her split with ex-fiancee Gareth Gates, she took to Twitter to deny they were an item, saying she was a member of the gym and he was just a friend.

<p>A host of top sports stars have chipped in to help down-on-his-luck snooker legend Willie Thorne in his fight against leukaemia.</p>
<p>Pals of Willie, 66, are aiming to raise £26,000 to help fund a carer and other medical costs.</p>
<p>Ryder Cup golfers including Ian Poulter, Paul McGinley, Francesco Molinari and Danny Willett have already putt their money where their mouth is.</p>
<p>Longtime snooker buddy John Virgo – like Willie a revered player turned pundit – has contributed to the fund too.</p>
<p>And another golf star, Mark Roe, is helping to run the appeal on the gofundme site.</p>

<p>Willie, who has fought gambling addiction and at one point owed £1million, is having chemotherapy in Spain, where he now lives.</p>
<p>He also has severe gout in his left knee, so cannot walk.</p>
<p>His carer Julie O’Neill, who launched the fundraising appeal, said: “Willie’s life is no secret. He is on his own and he makes his money through appearances and commentating which has, for ­obvious reasons, had to stop.</p>
<p>“He isn’t entitled to any relief over here so he is in a very ­vulnerable situation where money is nearly depleted.</p>
<p>(Image: Jon Fuller-Rowell/Sunday Mirror)</p>
<p>“What happens when he can no longer pay? It’s not only money that this man needs. Yes, he needs to be able to pay the carer and the rent, bills, food etc.</p>
<p>“But as a long-term plan he needs a smaller, more ­affordable rental property to reduce his overall outgoings.</p>
<p>“He may need lifts to hospital for chemo, someone to translate so he can understand what ­professionals tell him, or just a warm meal in his belly. Surely he can’t be left with nothing?”</p>

<p>Willie, who was made bankrupt in 2015, moved to Villamartin on the Costa Blanca two years ago to help arrange celebrity golf events.</p>
<p>They involved celebrities Paul Gascoigne and comedian Bobby Davro – a snooker fan.</p>
<p>Willie, who hails from Leicester, split from his wife Jill, 60, last year.</p>
<p>The former Miss Great Britain finally walked out on their ­marriage after his money problems took a toll.</p>
<p>(Image: Phil Harris/Daily Mirror)</p>
<p>(Image: Getty)</p>
<p>A friend said Willie’s family back in the UK were “seriously worried” and offering what ­support they could.</p>
<p>So far the appeal has raised over £6,600.</p>
<p>Carer Julie thanked Mark Roe for his input and added: “Mark would like to express a ­massive thank-you to all of his friends and fans of Willie who have so far supported him in this crucial time.</p>

<p>“All funds will be ­managed ­independently and all of Willie’s ­essential life needs will be paid and controlled by fund organisers.</p>
<p>“Please everyone, help give Big Willie the comfort he needs to fight on.”
