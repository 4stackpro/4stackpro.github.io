<p>I’m playing Jiminy Cricket in Guillermo del Toro’s version of Pinocchio. That I had started working on before I left for New York, so some of that is recorded. And of course it’s stop-frame animation, so it’s going to take them a great long time to make that film. But my first part, which is recording his dialogue, is sort of done. There may or may not be a song that needs to be recorded. I’m not sure I’m at liberty to discuss that.

“I think it was a film made by and for a generation that hadn’t had films made for it,” Mr. Henry said in an interview with the journal Cineaste in 2001. “We were just trying to make a film about something we understood. By we, I mean Mike Nichols; Larry Turman, the producer; and me.”</p>
<p>Calder Willingham, who wrote an early version of the script, also received screenplay credit, but it was Mr. Henry’s that was the basis of the film, though the two shared an Academy Award nomination for best adapted screenplay.</p>
<p>“When Nichols asked me to read the book, they’d already thrown away four scripts,” Mr. Henry recalled. “Nichols, Turman and I all thought we were Benjamin. That’s how the book affected us. Nichols and Turman saw the behavior and events in the film as reflecting what they felt at Benjamin’s age. So did I.”</p>
<p>Heir of Stockbrokers</p>
<p>Buck Henry was born Henry Zuckerman in New York City on Dec. 9, 1930, to Paul and Ruth (Taylor) Zuckerman. His father was a stockbroker and an Army Air Corps pilot; his mother was a Ziegfeld Follies performer and an actress in silent films. He was named for his grandfather, also a stockbroker, acquiring his nickname, Buck, in the process. (In the 2009 archive interview, he said he did not legally change his name to Buck Henry until the 1970s.)</p>
<p>Mr. Henry attended private schools in New York and attended Dartmouth, where he joined the theater crowd in campus productions. He recalled in an interview with Dartmouth Alumni Magazine in 2013 that three drama professors were the only ones “I really cared about.”</p>
<p>After graduating, he was drafted and spent the Korean War years touring Army bases in Germany with an acting company, performing in a musical revue he wrote and directed. When he returned, he lived mostly in New York City, auditioning for acting jobs and sending off writing samples, to little avail.

Colin Hanks was raised by one of the nicest actors in Hollywood, but the actor is taking time to praise another star he calls a &ldquo;true gent&rdquo; – Luke Perry.</p>
<p>Colin Hanks was raised by one of the nicest actors in Hollywood, but the actor is taking time to praise another star he calls a &ldquo;true gent&rdquo; – Luke Perry. The &ldquo;90210&rdquo; and &ldquo;Riverdale&rdquo; star died on Monday after suffering a &ldquo;massive stroke&rdquo; a week before. Several stars remembered Perry on social media, including Tom Hanks&rsquo; son.</p>
<p>Colin Hanks took to Instagram to post a photo of Perry and a long caption about the only time he met the actor. &ldquo;My wife and I are on a plane back from Mexico. Couple of rows ahead of us, these two brothers, young kids, are beating the hell out of each other,&rdquo; Hanks&rsquo; story began. &ldquo;Their poor parents are powerless to stop the crying, yelling and screaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a parent you understand. Sometimes there&rsquo;s nothing you can do,&rdquo; the actor wrote. &ldquo;It was like this for close to two hours. Then about 10 minutes before landing it starts to get real bad. Out of nowhere, a man comes from first class.&rdquo; Hanks described the man as wearing a hat, beard, and sunglasses. He was blowing up a balloon,&rdquo; Hanks wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kids calm down in milliseconds. Plane damn near bursts into applause,&rdquo; Hanks said of the stranger&rsquo;s act of kindness. &ldquo;15 minutes longer and it probably would have started WWIII, but we landed before that could happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hanks said when he and his wife got off the plane and were waiting at customs, he finally realized who the man was. &ldquo;Finally get a good look at the guy and I say to my wife &lsquo;Holy s**t. I think that balloon man/hero is Luke Perry.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>The story about Perry&rsquo;s kindness does not end there. &ldquo;As luck would have it we end up standing next to each other,&rdquo; the actor&rsquo;s post read. &ldquo;Out of the blue he turns to me and says some kind words about Fargo, which kinda blew my mind.&rdquo; (Hanks starred as Gus Grimly in the &ldquo;Fargo&rdquo; TV series.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I start singing his praises about how long I&rsquo;ve admired him and also about the move with the balloon,&rdquo; Hanks recalled. &ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a pro move! You can&rsquo;t teach that!&rsquo; I say. He tells me he always flies with a couple of balloons for that very reason, to give to screaming kids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; Hanks wrote. &ldquo;But [I] have no reason to believe it wasn&rsquo;t. Guy seemed like a true gent.&rdquo;

<p>Colin Hanks didn’t show up until the last 15 minutes of Fargo’s first episode, and in that brief appearance he was introduced as a scared cop who let Billy Bob Thornton’s poorly groomed hit man make off into the night. Last week’s episode revealed that Duluth deputy Gus Grimly (tied with Lorne Malvo for best name) is also a single dad who has to back up animal control on occasion and isn’t above taking a peek at his neighbor undressing across the street. It all seems very sad, but Hanks says his character is no pushover. Vulture spoke to the actor during FX’s press tour back in January about what to expect from gloomy Gus and how he got involved with Key and Peele’s “Thug English Actor” sketch — with a Method Mad interruption in between.</p>
<p>I’ve watched “Thug English Actor” so many times. I refuse to delete the episode from my DVR. How did it come together?</p>
<p>I did a live reading of Clue where I met Jordan, and I did The Thrilling Adventure Hour with Keegan, and they both were like, “You gotta come on the show,” and I said, “I will totally come on the show. Please.” And then they actually came through. It was the most fun I’ve had. Those guys are so insanely talented. I never miss an episode. It ended up being one of the coolest things on the résumé.</p>
<p>What was that day like?</p>
<p>Jordan was actually sick, which was incredible. He was deathly ill and emitting very little energy between takes, but then he’d just come on.</p>
<p>Was anything improvised?</p>
<p>I remember that I improvised a lot of the stuff where I’m saying just how bad an actor Jordan’s character is. “He’s really bad. I don’t believe him.” At one point I think I asked Keegan’s British actor character if he had allergies to gluten. There was all sorts of stuff. You could easily turn any one of those sketches into 20 minute opuses of nothing but improv. I instantly wished I could do it every single day.</p>
<p>They have recurring sketches. They could bring your director character back.</p>
<p>Consider this the missive I’m sending out in the world. Anytime.</p>
<p>How did you feel about doing Fargo: The TV Show?</p>
<p>Once I found out exactly what it was we were doing — and this was before I even got the job — I thought, Well, that’s the coolest thing I’ve ever heard. Someone already tried redoing the movie and it didn’t work out so well. We’ve got all-new characters, all-new stories, and in later episodes you’ll see that the show interconnects with the movie in a lot of cool ways. Anyone who is a fan of the film will dig the references we make, but anyone who is just coming fresh is going to be really, hopefully, entertained. We’re doing things really differently for TV, too. I’m only in one scene in the pilot. As a viewer I find that really refreshing.</p>
<p>How so?</p>
<p>It’s not forced storytelling. It’s not we have X amount of story that we have to tell in 42 minutes. It breathes. It takes its time. It’s not a crammed-down-your-throat scenario. As someone who watches a lot of TV, I appreciate when storytellers take their time. I’ve been trying to think of ways to describe the show to my friends, and I think it’s like how Marvel expands its universe. They’ve got that TV show [Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.], and they throw references to the comics. We’re expanding the Fargo universe, just without capes and superpowers. We’ve got parkas and — [Method Man interrupts to give Colin a hug. To Method Man:] Good to see you, brother. I got Denver–San Francisco. [Back to me:] Okay, when he said, “I loved you on Key and Peele,” that’s when I was like, Fuck, yes. Awesome.</p>
<p>Key and Peele is for everyone.</p>
<p>It’s for the children, much like Wu-Tang. It’s for the children. God, when Method Man says hello to you, everything goes right out the door. Sorry.</p>
<p>We’re first introduced to Gus by watching him let Lorne Malvo go. When you signed on, did you know what was coming next?</p>
<p>Yeah, and the thing for me that was most appealing is that Gus makes this decision in the pilot and spends the rest of his time trying to atone for that mistake. He knows that he did the wrong thing, and he’s actively trying to fix it. It’s not one of these passive characters who sits there and goes, “Oh, I don’t know what to do.” So many characters I read are blissfully unaware or they don’t try to actively do anything about their situations. They just whine. This guy admits it.</p>
<p>When I first watched, I thought Gus and Molly (Allison Tolman) were sort of two halves of Marge.</p>
<p>I will tell you that Gus has to come clean at some point, and their paths will cross.</p>
<p>When’s the last time you watched the movie?</p>
<p>I hadn’t seen it since the first time I saw it. I rewatched it one night in Calgary. The Asian guy who tries to get things going with Marge, I had completely forgotten about that and it had me in stitches.</p>
<p>How’s filming in Calgary been?</p>
<p>The whole thing is a first for me. It was the first time I’d ever heard of a show canceling a day because it was 40 [degrees] below. The equipment didn’t work. The cables literally shattered due to cold. That exterior scene with Billy Bob was brutal. But you learn how to sandwich the toes with toe warmers. You apply heating pads to your long underwear. I haven’t had to bust out the electric vest yet, but it’s coming. Also, watching a game of Canadian football with Bob Odenkirk and Billy Bob is a fun day, so all in all, I’m having a good time.

<h3 id="colin-hanks-hopes-to-finally-break-mr-nice-guy-mold-with-fargo">&ldquo;Colin Hanks hopes to finally break Mr. Nice Guy mold with ‘Fargo’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e7cbfc5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+142/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffb%2F0b%2F593133b1da9106d00e1953323466%2Fla-1884020-ca-0610-colin-hanks-1-gem-jpg-20140616" alt="img">
Colin Hanks has a knack for playing good guys — which has not always been a good thing.</p>
<p>Hanks made his mark in 2002’s teen film “Orange County.” Since then, his boyish looks, lanky frame and amiable personality have been his calling card and have led to memorable roles in the sci-fi drama “Roswell,” HBO’s “Band of Brothers” and the short-lived Fox buddy cop comedy “The Good Guys.”</p>
<p>But in the age of the antihero, those same good-natured qualities may have worked against landing more complex parts. To burnish his darker side, Hanks even took a showy turn a few years ago as a serial killer on “Dexter.” But he always seemed too decent to break bad.</p>
<p>“That’s the stereotype of me,” said the 36-year-old actor, who is the son of actor Tom Hanks. “That’s the pigeonhole I’m in, and I’m constantly trying to break out of that.”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>His latest role in FX’s critically acclaimed 10-episode dramedy “Fargo,” which wraps up its season Tuesday, may help him do just that. As with the movie, which served as its inspiration, the TV series is flavored with darkly comic moments, offbeat characters and gut-wrenching moments of explosive violence.</p>
<p>In the series, Hanks plays a familiar morally upright, sympathetic and occasionally hapless police officer named Gus Grimly. But it quickly becomes a more complicated portrayal when his character meets up with the evil Lorne Malvo (Billy Bob Thornton). Hanks’ single parent character backs down — a decision that might have saved his life and kept his daughter from becoming an orphan, but also one that costs the lives of many more residents of the quirky community.</p>
<p>“A lot of Gus was frustrating to me,” Hanks said during a recent sit-down at his publicist’s office in Beverly Hills. “He’s got a lot of the nice guy stuff that I’ve been trying to buck. But the way it was written and directed, it’s the best version of this type of guy.”</p>
<p>His performance in the original adaptation of the 1996 Oscar-winning film from Joel and Ethan Coen is generating some of the most favorable reviews of his career. The praise has caught him a bit off-guard.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“The reception we’ve gotten has been rather overwhelming,” said Hanks. “I’m not necessarily used to being in something that has grabbed attention like this. Usually, it’s a little bit after the fact.”</p>
<p>“Fargo” creator Noah Hawley had high praise for Hanks: “Colin was born to play this role — it really shows what he is capable of. He’s got that impossible-to-quantify likability, but he’s never been put through his paces like this.”</p>
<p>Hanks is part of a high-powered ensemble that includes Oscar winner Thornton, Martin Freeman, Keith Carradine, Bob Odenkirk and Oliver Platt. And it’s his character’s romantic relationship with the smart and persistent Molly Solverson (Allison Tolman) that serves as the loving, beating heart of the drama.</p>
<p>However, Hanks’ Grimly doesn’t appear in the series until about 10 minutes before the end of the first episode. In that moment, he pulls over Malvo on a routine traffic stop.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>But when Malvo calmly threatens the life of Grimly and his teen daughter, the scared officer lets him drive away. The tense exchange is one of the highlights of the pilot, and it defines Grimly’s character in just a few minutes.</p>
<p>“That scene is about what Gus is doing and not doing,” Hanks said. “It’s a very relatable scenario — he’s frightened for himself and his daughter, he wants to protect her, so the best thing to do is nothing. But although technically he did the right thing, the rest of the series revolves around him living with that guilt. In the eyes of everyone else, he did the wrong thing.”</p>
<p>The only character who doesn’t judge him is Molly, a grossly underrated police officer in her own right. Hanks said he and Tolman “just really hit it off. I was just blown away by how effortless she makes everything seem. She was very comfortable, and that put me at ease. “</p>
<p>Bonding with Tolman and the rest of the cast helped Hanks tolerate the often brutally cold weather conditions (the series was filmed during winter in Calgary, Canada).</p>

<p>“When they’re wrapping the camera in an electric blanket, that’s not a good sign. But the cold is a character,” said Hanks. “It’s what people remember from the film, along with the accents and the wood chipper.”</p>
<p>Hanks said he doesn’t have any immediate projects but is hopeful that “Fargo” will open up new and more diverse roles: “The kinds of things I want to do may become a little more possible now.”</p>

Fargo type TV Show network FX genre Drama</p>
<p>Crime</p>
<p>Anthology</p>
<p>Colin Hanks was really hoping his FX drama Fargo would receive an Emmy nomination. It ended up getting 18, including a nod for the 36-year-old, who was recognized for his performance as conflicted cop Gus Grimly in the best supporting actor in a miniseries category. That one was a bit of a surprise, he admits.</p>
<p>ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Congrats! How did you find out about the nomination? Were you even awake?</p>
<p>COLIN HANKS: No, no, I was asleep. I had woken up around 5:20 and sort of said, “Oh, okay, no phone calls. Well, I’m gonna go back to sleep,” ’cause in my mind they would just announce all of [the nominations] at once at 5:15. [Laughs] So I was like, “Oh, didn’t happen. Too bad,” and sort of went back to sleep, totally content. And then around 30 minutes later or so the phone rang and I just went, “Well, no one would be calling around this time unless it did actually happen.” I answered the phone and all I heard was screaming. And it was good screams. So it’s been a very surprising but very good morning.</p>
<p>Who were the screams coming from?</p>
<p>My publicist and my manager. My team of all-stars.</p>
<p>Who was the first person you then told about the good news?</p>
<p>Well really, I mean at that time on the West Coast, there’s really no one to tell. Obviously my wife was with me; as soon as the phone rang she woke up. But actually the first person I talked to, I called Allison [Tolman]. ‘Cause she’s in Chicago and I knew that she would be awake by that point, just based on time difference alone. And I had a nice, funny conversation with her about how surreal this all is and how happy I am for her and how proud I am of her. This whole experience has been so great, and Allison is so awesome. I called her and wanted to tell her how much I love her and how happy I am. Then all the other news has trickled in, I talked with Noah [Hawley, creator] and he filled me in on just how many nominations the show got, which is fantastic and incredible. And I’m really glad that a lot of people on the show are being recognized for it, ’cause it was a lot of hard work up there in minus-35 degree temperatures in Calgary, Alberta.</p>
<p>How are you celebrating today in California?</p>
<p>I celebrated in the morning by playing Princesses and Castles with my two daughters. And now I’m just sort of sitting here going, “Aw jeez, this is a lot of texts and emails I better return.” But no, it’s all a good… look, this is all an awesome surprise. I really wasn’t expecting this for myself. I was hoping for it for the show, so this is all really pretty cool.</p>
<p>Did you feel you were working on a production that was Emmy-worthy while shooting?</p>
<p>No, no. I knew that we were working on something good. But you never know if people are gonna like what you’re doing. I think everybody had the same gut reaction when they first heard about a Fargo show, which is: Why? Why would you do that? You’re never gonna top that. We never tried to top it, we just tried to get as close to the bar as we could. You know the bar was set incredibly high. But once I read Noah’s script and it was so good, I knew that I wanted to be a part of it. And as we were making it, I knew it was good, I really liked it, I thought it was fabulous, I thought everybody’s performances were great. But you never know if people are actually going to get it. And people gravitated to it in a way I was really… I don’t want to say surprised by, ’cause again I knew it was good, it was just surprising how many people were in agreement in how much they loved it. And the fact that the show got as many nominations as it did is a great indicator that yes, when you’re doing something good, you know, that rises above everything else.</p>
<p>Me personally, I’m shocked just because the nature of Gus and the kind of character he was… he’s not an emotive character, he’s a very inverted guy with a bunch of weight on his shoulders. So everything I was doing, everything Gus was doing, was really inward and subtle, and I didn’t necessarily think that that was going to be showy enough for something like this. But the fact that people were drawn to Gus and Gus’s relationship to Molly, obviously, that people really rooted for them, I’m very happy about it and this nomination is kind of just crazy. It’s a really nice feeling, ’cause it’s the kind of performance and the kind of acting and the kind of material that I’ve been wanting to work with for a long time. And so to not only have gotten the chance to do it, that’s a win, and then everything else is just icing on the cake.</p>
<p>Speaking of Gus, I don’t know that everyone viewed him as the kind of guy who could save the day. Did you ever view him as a hero?</p>
<p>No, not at all. I don’t see him as a hero at all. I think in the “Who’s gonna win, Gus or Malvo?” I think Malvo wins ’cause Malvo forces Gus to do something he does not want to do. And what Gus goes through there at the end is gonna haunt him for the rest of his life. And he’s happy—he finds the love of his life and things get better for him, for sure. And he’s able to rest knowing that that chapter of his life is done. But it still is gonna haunt him. So I never saw him as Gus being the hero at all. The fact that people were able to pick that up—and a lot of people were just like, “Oh, what a hero”—but the fact that some people were able to pick that up and say, “Aw, jeez—Gus had his moment, but God, it’s pretty bittersweet”—again, it’s reaffirmation that even the little subtle things sometimes get lost on television shows, but sometimes people are still able to pick those things up.</p>
<p>Why did he and Molly resonate so much with fans and Emmy voters?</p>
<p>Part of it I would imagine is just the sort of relationship that Allison and I have. Obviously we get along, so any scenes between us were always so effortless that you sort of, you’d hope that it would translate a little. But I think a huge part of it has to do with Noah and the way that he wrote it—he doesn’t have those scenes where they’re professing everything to each other. You just know that these two people kind of like each other and they’re stumbling around trying to get to that stage. And so to have people root for them in that way and want to see it, and then have the bold move of flashing forward a year, and then just seeing them together in the seemingly domestic bliss that they’re in, I think that had a greater impact than any scene you could have of Gus professing his love to her and then them kissing with music swelling. It was always much more about the notes that are not being played in those scenes, you know? So I think that’s really it. People have seen the schmaltzy stuff, but they haven’t seen the people who are trying to make that connection and rooting for those people to make that connection. I think that’s really what’s the key.</p>
<p>Were those kind of moments and that kind of writing part of the reason why this movie-to-TV adaptation worked so well while others fail?</p>
<p>It wasn’t trying to be the movie. I think the great decision was let’s make something that can exist in the same universe as the film but is not a carbon copy. We can borrow from the film—we can borrow tone, we can borrow [the] look, we borrowed stuff not just from Fargo but the whole canon of Coen brothers films. But at the same time, it’s like, look—we’re not gonna top it, we don’t want to just do the film, let’s do something different. And I think the fact that we did that and have different characters, different story, but it still had that same feel, it still had that same tint as Fargo, I think was good. And also, I think when you make subtle nods to the film—you know, people call them Easter eggs on DVDs and stuff like that —people pick up on that stuff. It makes them more excited about the show. And so when you have little things like that, that’s really great. Like a White Russian drink special in a bar, that’s cool, but then there’s also… it’s funny, ’cause it does sort of symbolize a flag, but the ice scraper, you know, we planted that as “here’s the true connection.” And it’s really the only connection that the show has to the film, that this lives in the same universe. And again, it goes back to that same gut reaction. Everybody said: Why? And the truth is, well, because it’s such a rich universe. And there’s so many different ways to tell other stories in that universe. But we told our own, which I think is the most important.

<h3 id="colin-hanks-fargo-like-marvel-films">&ldquo;Colin Hanks: &lsquo;Fargo like Marvel films&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/digitalspyuk.cdnds.net/14/18/ustv-fargo-episode-3-a-muddy-road.jpg?crop=1xw:0.7492507492507493xh;center,top&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">
Colin Hanks has compared the television adaptation of Fargo to the blockbuster Marvel film series.</p>
<p>The actor - who plays Officer Gus Grimly in Fargo - revealed that he found the television version of the Coen brothers&rsquo; 1996 movie to be instantly appealing.</p>
<p>Martin Freeman on reinventing Fargo: &lsquo;I never thought about the film&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once I found out exactly what it was we were doing - and this was before I even got the job - I thought, &lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s the coolest thing I&rsquo;ve ever heard&rsquo;,&rdquo; Hanks told Vulture. &ldquo;Someone already tried redoing the movie and it didn&rsquo;t work out so well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He continued: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got all-new characters, all-new stories, and in later episodes you&rsquo;ll see that the show interconnects with the movie in a lot of cool ways. Anyone who is a fan of the film will dig the references we make, but anyone who is just coming fresh is going to be really, hopefully, entertained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing things really differently for TV, too. I&rsquo;m only in one scene in the pilot. As a viewer I find that really refreshing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went on to liken the relationship between the movie and its television spinoff to the Marvel films and the Agents of SHIELD series.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not forced storytelling. It&rsquo;s not we have X amount of story that we have to tell in 42 minutes. It breathes,&rdquo; Hanks said. &ldquo;It takes its time. It&rsquo;s not a crammed-down-your-throat scenario.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The actor continued: &ldquo;As someone who watches a lot of TV, I appreciate when storytellers take their time. I&rsquo;ve been trying to think of ways to describe the show to my friends, and I think it&rsquo;s like how Marvel expands its universe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got that TV show [Agents of SHIELD], and they throw references to the comics. We&rsquo;re expanding the Fargo universe, just without capes and superpowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ensemble cast of Fargo also includes Billy Bob Thornton, Martin Freeman, Bob Odenkirk and Kate Walsh.</p>
<p>FX airs the series on Tuesdays at 10pm ET in the US. Channel 4 screens Fargo in the UK.</p>
