<p>At 11 seasons, Modern Family is ending its tenure on ABC as a proud sitcom tween: The series finale aired on Wednesday, allowing us to check in one last time with our honorary Pritchett and Dunphy and Delgado family members and make sure they’ll be alright when the credits roll. (Also in the esteemed 11 Comedy Club? None other than Frasier, Murphy Brown, Cheers, and Married…With Children. Quick! Someone check on Ed O’Neill’s royalty checks.) And, just as with a certain perfect Canadian sitcom earlier this week, the finale gave us just enough warm fuzzies for these California yuppies to make for a fitting and realistic send-off. Here’s where our trio of modern families end their stories — all 13 members deep. “It’s hard,” Jay says at the end, “because not everyone gets to have what we have.” It’s true!</p>
<p>The Dunphys</p>
<p>With Claire beginning her new job as CEO of a storage and container company, Phil continues his career as a realtor. However, now as empty-nesters for the first time in 25 years, the couple plan to embark on an RV trip across the country — fulfilling a dream they never got to accomplish prior to having children. Alex’s new, low paying research job has her move to Geneva, Switzerland (with a foxy British scientist as her new beau), while Luke announces he’s been accepted to and is going to attend the University of Oregon. Haley, who works at a Goop-esque company in a senior role, and her husband Dylan, along with their infant twins Poppy and George, move into the apartment previously occupied by Mitch and Cam.</p>
<p>The Pritchetts</p>
<p>Despite being rejected for the position months prior, Cam is ultimately offered his dream job as head football coach at the University of North Central Missouri — thus making him the first openly gay coach at a university program in the country. (The reason? The coach UNCM hired “did a press conference where he used some colorful language to address a female reporter and blamed some things on the Jews.” ) At first, the news blindsides Mitchell, as they recently moved into a fabulous new home with their teenage daughter, Lily, and their new adopted son, Rexford. However, Mitchell realizes that this is “my chance to be there” for Cam and welcomes the move to flyover country. He also believes that with his attorney background, obtaining a judge position is a likely next career step.</p>
<p>The Delgados</p>
<p>With Jay in retirement mode, he decides to dedicate his free time to mastering the Spanish language for his wife, Gloria — and also surprises her by agreeing to join her for a summer in Colombia, her native country. With Manny set to embark on a year-long boating adventure around the world with his father, Gloria dives further into her newfound successful career in real estate, where she works full-time with Phil at his firm. Their son, Joe, continues to be a cute pain in the ass. “Life is full of change. Some big, some small. I learned a long time ago you could fight it or you could try to make the best of it,” Jay narrates as the finale’s closing remarks. “And that’s all a lot easier if you’ve got people who love you helping you face whatever life throws at you. At least that’s what helps me sleep at night.”

<h3 id="sarah-hyland-says-she-couldnt-relate-to-her-modern-family-character-ahead-of-series-finale">Sarah Hyland says she couldn&rsquo;t relate to her Modern Family character&hellip; ahead of series finale</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/09/04/26982218-0-image-a-118_1586402271537.jpg" alt="img">
Hours before the Modern Family series finale, Sarah Hyland admitted that the only thing she actually shared in common with her once-ditzy &lsquo;hot girl&rsquo; character Haley Dunphy was being &lsquo;not good at cooking.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t relate to her a lot. I don&rsquo;t know how she goes about life because I&rsquo;m more like [Haley&rsquo;s mother] Claire,&rsquo; the New York-born, LA-raised 29-year-old admitted in a Glamour essay on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Perhaps Sarah could relate to Claire Dunphy&rsquo;s wildchild youth since both of their characters wound up married with children, and she still considers Julie Bowen a &lsquo;role model.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t relate to her a lot&rsquo;: Hours before the Modern Family series finale, Sarah Hyland (L) admitted that the only thing she actually shared in common with her once-ditzy &lsquo;hot girl&rsquo; character Haley Dunphy was being &lsquo;not good at cooking&rsquo;</p>
<p>The New York-born, LA-raised 29-year-old admitted in a Glamour essay on Wednesday: I don&rsquo;t know how she goes about life because I&rsquo;m more like [Haley&rsquo;s mother] Claire&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Julie has been like a mother to me over the past 11 years. She is one of the strongest, smartest, most opinionated women I&rsquo;ve ever met,&rsquo; Hyland wrote.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But she is smart about being opinionated. There&rsquo;s a time and a place for things, and I&rsquo;m still learning how to master that because I have no filter. She&rsquo;s taught me how to keep, at times, my mouth shut. Watching her in interviews, in work settings - really just in life - her brain is the most fascinating thing to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The four-time SAG Award winner was likely doing damage control after lamenting to Cosmopolitan on Thursday that Haley should&rsquo;ve become &lsquo;a badass stylist or brand mogul or anything like that&rsquo; rather than the mother of twins.</p>
<p>Sarah looks forward to producing projects and starring in dramatic period pieces, but for now she&rsquo;s focusing on her immunocompromised health in the age of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Bitter over end: The four-time SAG Award winner was likely doing damage control after lamenting to Cosmopolitan on Thursday that Haley should&rsquo;ve become &lsquo;a badass stylist or brand mogul or anything like that&rsquo; rather than the mother of twins</p>
<p>&lsquo;Right now my life is about staying safe and staying home&rsquo;: Sarah looks forward to producing projects and starring in dramatic period pieces, but for now she&rsquo;s focusing on her immunocompromised health in the age of COVID-19</p>
<p>&lsquo;Right now my life is about staying safe, staying home, staying healthy, staying creative, and learning new things,&rsquo; Hyland - who&rsquo;s undergone over 16 surgeries, including two kidney transplants - wrote in Glamour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll relearn French. I took five years of that language and still had trouble when we went to Paris this year for the show. I&rsquo;m also looking forward to learning how to ride a bike - but, of course, if I want to stay healthy and not get hurt, maybe I wait until this pandemic is over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>According to Deadline, the 5ft2in brunette earned over $100K an episode for the privilege of playing a Dunphy and the two-hour series finale of ABC&rsquo;s mockumentary sitcom concludes Wednesday night.</p>
<p>When Sarah reunited with her young castmates on Wednesday&rsquo;s episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live, they all agreed they&rsquo;d miss Ed O&rsquo;Neill the most since they&rsquo;ll &lsquo;probably never see him again&rsquo; because he doesn&rsquo;t leave Hawaii.</p>

<h3 id="modern-family-finale-recap-mitch--cam-make-a-life-changing-decision--alex-moves-overseas">‘Modern Family’ Finale Recap: Mitch &amp; Cam Make A Life-Changing Decision &amp; Alex Moves Overseas</h3>
<p><img src="https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/mordern-family-series-finale-recap-abc-ftr.jpg" alt="img">
‘Modern Family’ aired its final episode on April 8. All of the characters faced new adventures in the series finale as they made life-changing moves across the country and the world.</p>
<p>Mitch and Cam’s baby boy has arrived and his name is Rexford. He’s named after their street. Just as Mitch and Cam move into their new house, Cam learns that he’s gotten the football coaching job in Missouri. This really weighs on Cam. He really wants to take this job but doesn’t want to disappoint Mitch. He tells Claire that he’s going to turn down the job and not even tell Mitch. But you know Cam — he just can’t keep his feelings contained. When he reveals the news, Mitch says he’s all-in. This is his chance to support Cam’s dream. Cam and Mitch are moving to Missouri!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Phil and Claire tell their kids that one of them has to move out. Haley, Alex, and Luke don’t want to leave. Suddenly, everything changes for the Dunphy kids. Alex’s research team is being transferred to Switzerland. A romantic relationship begins to brew between Arvin and Alex. They’re even exchanging “saucy texts!”</p>
<p>Dylan and Haley also announce they’re moving out. They think it’s time for their little family to get their own place. Luke comes in and also reveals big news. He’s been accepted to the University of Oregon! Phil and Claire started out with all the kids in the house and now they’re all moving out.</p>
<p>As for Gloria, it’s time for her to go out in the world and take it by storm. Jay says he’s going to hold down the fort now. He’s also learning Spanish for Gloria so he’s prepared when they go to Colombia. Manny is heading out on his own year-long adventure.</p>
<p>Cam and Mitch stop by Phil and Claire’s to say their final goodbyes before they head out. There are a lot of emotions in the room. When Jay says that “both my sons are leaving,” everyone pretty much loses it. Mitch and Cam’s flight is delayed a number of times so they all get a little more time together. As the Dunphy kids pack up their things, Phil and Claire decide to take an RV trip across the country.</p>
<p>When it’s time to say their final final goodbyes, the tears just start falling. None of them know when they’ll all be together again. It’s so hard to say goodbye because “not everybody gets to have what we have,” as Jay says.
