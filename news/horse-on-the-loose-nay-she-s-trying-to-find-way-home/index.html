It was a sight to behold, as a muscular white horse trotted next to cars at a traffic junction along Eng Neo Avenue.</p>
<p>But this mare was not horsing around, and was in fact trying to find her way back to the stables, her owner, Mr Ronnie Lim, 58, told The Straits Times after the sighting was captured on video by a member of the public.</p>
<p>The 15-second video, which was posted on Facebook yesterday, had at least 7,000 shares and more than 1,200 comments within three hours of being put up.</p>
<p>Mr Lim, who is the owner of Paisano Polo Academy in Turf Club Road, said the 11-year-old mare, named Cocorita, was found within 20 minutes following her escape at 4pm yesterday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horses tend to find their way back and we&rsquo;re happy she&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Mr Lim.</p>
<p>She was found grazing on a grass patch along Eng Neo Avenue. &ldquo;She probably got distracted and had a bite. She was calm and we put a collar on her and walked her back to the stables,&rdquo; he said, adding that Cocorita was a children&rsquo;s riding horse and was usually mild mannered.</p>
<p>He said a handler had taken Cocorita to the paddock and was about to close the gate when a loud screech from some vehicles on the road nearby caused her to take fright and run.</p>
<p>Responding to queries, Dr Alwyn Tan, deputy director of the Animal and Veterinary Service under the National Parks Board, said they were investigating and working with the academy to prevent such an incident from recurring. The mare was found to be in good health.</p>
<p>The academy has about 15 horses, and Mr Lim said this is the first time such a thing has happened. &ldquo;While I usually get flustered, I&rsquo;ve realised that this incident has brought some smiles and laughter amid all the gloom and doom right now.&rdquo;

<h3 id="coronavirus-racing-stops-for-a-month-at-turf-club">Coronavirus: Racing stops for a month at Turf Club</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/articles/2020/04/05/ST_20200405_SPTHOR_5576878.jpg?itok=rK1RzmVJ" alt="img">
For the first time in more than four decades, the Sport of Kings has been halted for a prolonged period in Singapore.</p>
<p>The Singapore Turf Club (STC) said yesterday that it will be suspending all local race meetings until May 4 in line with the Ministry of Health&rsquo;s latest advisory on Covid-19.</p>
<p>The Government announced stricter measures on Friday to stem the spike in local coronavirus cases. The new measures include the shutting down of most workplaces - except for those providing essential services - and schools as part of a month-long &ldquo;circuit breaker&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The last time horse racing was stopped for a period of time was in 1977 - for two months from mid-September, owing to an equine flu outbreak. Singapore and Malaysia then raced as one entity under the Malayan Racing Association.</p>
<p>The STC said: &ldquo;Indeed, we are operating in unprecedented times with impact reaching far into our economy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is part of our continuing efforts to further minimise the spread of Covid-19 and ensure the club remains free of the coronavirus for the safety and well-being of our many staff and stakeholders, including horse owners, trainers, jockeys and many others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will continue to adapt our precautionary measures as the situation evolves and carefully evaluate and minimise impact on our business operations and stakeholders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The STC and Singapore Pools, which also announced yesterday it will not be offering betting and wagering until further notice after MOH&rsquo;s newest move, are governed by the Tote Board.</p>
<p>According to the statutory board&rsquo;s latest annual report, turnover for horse racing was $1.058 billion for the 2018-19 financial year, a drop from the $1.134 billion collected in the previous year.</p>
<p>The STC said it is not in a unique position, as many racing clubs around the world have adopted similar or even more rigorous measures.</p>
<p>Racing has also stopped in Europe, New Zealand, South Africa and Macau, among other places .</p>
<p>MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME Hopefully, the club can make up for the lost meetings by having a few more races per day when racing resumes&hellip; WILLIAM CHIA , horse owner, calling for the STC to have more races when the situation improves.</p>
<p>There are about 1,100 thoroughbreds at the STC and owners pay about $3,500 monthly for basic training fee per horse.</p>
<p>The STC offers an incentive scheme in the form of a credit rebate of $1,350 per horse if it finishes second to fifth-last and $450 for fourth-last to second-last. This is used to offset the monthly training bill which helps lower the cost of keeping horses in Singapore.</p>
<p>The prize money for races ranges from $20,000 to $1.5 million. It is divided among owners, trainers and jockeys according to their placings.</p>
<p>William Chia, the director of Legion Bloodstock Syndicate which races five horses at Kranji, said he supports the Government&rsquo;s latest measures but the owners&rsquo; main concern is training bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We race in the hope our horses can earn stake money to cover our initial investments and training fees,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So, hopefully, the club can make up for the lost meetings by having a few more races per day when racing resumes and also recover some lost race days during the year-end break.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are lean times ahead for jockeys like Australian John Powell. He said: &ldquo;We earn our money from race riding and prize money, so we&rsquo;ll kind of struggle a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Association of Racehorse Trainers (Singapore) president Michael Clements said: &ldquo;Obviously, it&rsquo;s quite a big hit for us not being able to race. But, at the same time, everyone in the country has been affected in one way or another, so we really have to support the Government&rsquo;s initiatives to try and get on top of this thing once and for all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For us, we have to look after the welfare of the horses, maintain their condition and fitness. Training has to be consistent and not stop-start, stop-start.&rdquo;
