Senator Jane Hume has confirmed the Australian Taxation Office will be responsible for verifying early release super requests.</p>
<p>Hume, the assistant minister for superannuation, financial services and financial technology, told the AFR Wealth Summit the ATO will take on the challenge of verifying requests for early release super (ERS) payments and called on the funds to cooperate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right now, the government&rsquo;s ask of the $3 trillion super industry is that it responds to those verified requests from the ATO and releases funds to its members in a timely manner,&rdquo; Hume said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that sounds unreasonable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do most Australians, who have met the news that they can access their own savings for this unforeseen crisis with relief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hostplus responded positively to the decision saying it will streamline the approval process and make it easier for funds and members to navigate.</p>
<p>Hostplus chief executive David Elia said the ERS scheme was well intentioned and would assist members who had lost jobs and found themselves in financial difficulties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We support the federal government&rsquo;s policy to allow members to access up to $20,000 from their superannuation accounts over the course of this year to assist them through the current crisis,&rdquo; Elia said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hostplus stands ready to do our part during these challenging times for working Australians to make sure they have access to funds to meet daily costs for themselves and their families.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elia added that the fund has ample liquidity available to support members undergoing financial hardship.</p>
<p>However, he did warn members to think carefully about the potential future impacts of accessing their super early.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We recommend that members carefully consider the long-term impact on their superannuation savings before seeking to withdraw cash from their super accounts,&rdquo; Elia said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Withdrawing $20,000 from a superannuation account now will substantially reduce members&rsquo; final balance on retirement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hume warned funds about not complying with the ATO requests, saying they stand to be exposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those funds whose members are congregated in sectors hardest hit by virus, particularly smaller funds, unless they have risk-managed their investments for a crisis, may find this period very uncomfortable,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, I want to say today, that discomfort is no excuse to not release members&rsquo; money - their own money - in a time of need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hume said any fund who refuses a member access to their money after an ATO determination is &ldquo;essentially admitting&rdquo; that their investment governance was cavalier or their systems inadequate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine a bigger signal to members, to the media and to regulators,&rdquo; Hume said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when everyone is making sacrifices, patience is short for those who can&rsquo;t pull their weight.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="ato-issues-updated-tax-super-law-advice">ATO issues updated tax, super law advice</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-761131/6907f91062396b558c126e98c2e4c15aab96f40a-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1024" alt="img">
New rules are now in place allowing early access to superannuation as thousands of Australians lose their jobs and livelihoods due to the economic impact of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The Australian Taxation Office has updated its website with a ‘one-stop shop’ for advice on COVID-19 stimulus measures, after the passage of the federal government’s economic support package through parliament this week.</p>
<p>Individuals affected by COVID-19 will be allowed to access up to $10,000 of their superannuation in 2019/20 and a further $10,000 in 2020/21.</p>
<p>“Individuals will not need to pay tax on amounts released and the money they withdraw will not affect Centrelink or Veterans’ Affairs payments,” the ATO confirmed in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Apply online</p>
<p>From mid-April, eligible persons will be able to apply online through the myGov website to access their superannuation before July 1, 2020.</p>
<p>They will also be able to access up to a further $10,000 between July 1, 2020, and September 24, 2020.</p>
<p>More on 7NEWS.com.au</p>
<p>ATO Commissioner Chris Jordan acknowledged many people are being financially impacted by the challenging economic conditions created by the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>“Each of the measures have different timings, eligibility, and processes. Some will be applied automatically and others will require an application, so I recommend heading to ato.gov.au/coronavirus to understand what is possible,” he said.</p>

<h3 id="smsf-landlords-ato-guidance-on-temporary-covid-19-rent-reduction">SMSF landlords: ATO guidance on temporary COVID-19 rent reduction</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-facebook.png" alt="img">
Last week, we wrote an article about the compliance hurdles faced by an SMSF if they wanted to provide rent relief to tenants – click here to read the previous alert.</p>
<p>The ATO has since announced some guidance for SMSF landlords – click here for the ATO’s guidance.</p>
<p>ATO’s position</p>
<p>The ATO have confirmed that SMSFs can provide ‘a temporary rent reduction’ to tenants, including a tenant:</p>
<p>who is a related party or related trust</p>
<p>where a member, relative or a member or related party/trust has an underlying economic interest in the tenant.</p>
<p>Although this would normally trigger a range of SIS Act compliance breaches, the ATO has indicated that it will not take compliance action for either the 2020 or 2021 financial years.</p>
<p>As a result, an SMSF can provide a temporary rent reduction immediately without fear of the ATO taking adverse action.</p>
<p>Are there any requirements to access the ATO’s concession?</p>
<p>The concession provided by the ATO is extremely broad, partly because its guidance statement is very brief and as the full extent of this crisis is still unknown. The only requirement of the ATO’s concession is that the rent reduction must be temporary.</p>
<p>There are no other limitations on how an SMSF provides rent reduction. In particular, an SMSF can determine:</p>
<p>the amount of rent reduction provided</p>
<p>how long to provide the rent reduction for (although the ATO are currently only applying their no compliance approach for the 2020 and 2021 financial years).</p>
<p>Given the current business challenges, the ATO’s position is that there is no need for the rent reduction provided to be justified by market evidence (the SMSF can determine the reduction in its absolute discretion).</p>
<p>The ATO’s concession does not apply to any other lease incentives or relief – just a ‘temporary rent reduction’.</p>
<p>What should SMSFs do?</p>
<p>Although the rent reduction concession provided by the ATO is extremely broad, it is important that it is not abused (otherwise the ATO may not be so generous next time).</p>
<p>SMSF landlords should provide rent reduction to tenants who are suffering the effects of the COVID-19 crisis. This rent reduction should be reasonable and measured to the COVID-19 impact suffered by the tenant. Best practice is that it is consistent with the approach taken by arm’s length landlords.</p>
<p>The rent reduction agreed to by the SMSF should be properly documented, as this is an amendment to the lease terms.</p>
<p>It is likely that SMSF auditors will be required to report any rent reductions, although the exact parameters of what will be reported in relation any rent reductions are still being determined.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the ATO for providing such a useful concession to help SMSFs and their tenants deal with the COVID-19 crisis.
