<p>Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, June 17) – San Miguel Corporation chairman and chief executive officer Eduardo “Danding” Cojuangco Jr. died on Tuesday night due to a lingering illness, a week after celebrating his 85th birthday, the company confirmed.</p>
<p>​SMC informed the Philippine Stock Exchange about Cojuangco&rsquo;s passing on Wednesday morning. He served as the company&rsquo;s chairman since July 7, 1998.</p>
<p>Cojuangco had a strong presence and influence in Philippine business. Aside from SMC, he was also the chairman of several publicly listed companies, among them Ginebra San Miguel Inc.; San Miguel Food and Beverage, Inc.; Petron Corporation; ECJ &amp; Sons Agricultural Enterprises, Inc., and Northern Cement Corporation.</p>
<p>He was the 15th richest man in the Philippines and was ranked 2,048th in the world according to Forbes, with a net worth of $1.1 billion (about ₱55 billion).</p>
<p>In politics, Cojuangco first served as the governor of Tarlac, the provincial base of the family, from 1967 to 1969.</p>
<p>He further rose to national prominence during martial law, having been appointed as an adviser to then President Ferdinand Marcos. ​He was linked to the coco levy fund scam and was among the people tagged as allegedly behind the assassination of Senator Benigno &ldquo;Ninoy&rdquo; Aquino, Jr. at the tarmac in 1983 – an accusation even Aquino&rsquo;s youngest daughter Kris has denied.</p>
<p>Cojuangco became the chairman of San Miguel in 1984, but was removed from his position following the fall of the Marcos regime in 1986 and the rise of his estranged cousin Corazon Aquino as the country&rsquo;s president.​Cojuangco lived in exile in the United States after Marcos was ousted, only returning to Manila years later in the middle of Aquino&rsquo;s coup-laden term.</p>
<p>Cojuangco attempted to make a political comeback in 1992 when he ran for president under the Nationalist People’s Coalition, a political party he founded. He placed third in the presidential race, trailing behind eventual winner Fidel Ramos and runner-up Miriam Defensor-Santiago.</p>
<p>Malacañang officials have extended their condolences to the Cojuangco family through a series of statements. Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque cited the late tycoon&rsquo;s &ldquo;immense contribution to the socioeconomic development of the Philippines&rdquo; through SMC&rsquo;s diversified operations in the food, beverage, energy, power, fuel, and infrastructure sectors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Cojuangco’s SMC has been a reliable partner of the government in mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 by providing support and assistance to frontliners and vulnerable sectors,&rdquo; Roque added, citing generous donations from the conglomerate which reached over ₱13 billion.</p>
<p>Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles also grieved Cojuangco&rsquo;s passing: &ldquo;Ninong Danding was a larger than life figure whose colorful life shaped the course of our history. His wisdom and business acumen will be sorely missed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other key public figures offered their respects to the late Cojuangco, including allies from his political party.</p>
<p>Contribution to sports</p>
<p>Apart from his life in politics, Cojuangco became an ardent promoter of sports in the country during martial law.</p>
<p>He was appointed by Marcos as project director for basketball, earning the title as the first godfather of Philippine basketball.</p>
<p>As owner of Northern Cement Corporation, Cojuangco used the company to form the Northern Cement basketball team that served as the training pool for the national men’s basketball team from 1980 to 1986.</p>
<p>Among the Filipino basketball legends produced by the Northern Cement basketball program by Cojuangco are Ricardo Brown, Allan Caidic, Samboy Lim, Hector Calma, and Jerry Codinera.</p>
<p>Up before his death, Cojuangco remained active in sports as he owns three teams in the Philippine Basketball Association which are the San Miguel Beermen, Magnolia Pambansang Manok, and Barangay Ginebra San Miguel.</p>
<p>​The PBA also honored the late businessman and sports patron, remembering him for his &ldquo;countless contribution&rdquo; to the league and to Philippine sports.</p>
<p>Cojuangco was also the main benefactor of the De La Salle University men’s basketball team, which won two UAAP championships under his watch in the last decade. Former DLSU Green Archers coach Aldin Ayo also tweeted a tribute.</p>
<p>Cojuangco left behind his wife Gretchen, along with his children Tina, Lisa, Charlie and Mark. Charlie is an incumbent congressman representing Tarlac&rsquo;s 1st district, while Mark was former representative of Pangasinan&rsquo;s 5th district.

Servillano led a colourful life in the revolutionary years, credited with major victories as well as marked by storied downfalls. His first foray into the world of politics was as the military governor of Tarlac province, where the Spaniards surrendered to the Filipino forces on 3 june 1898. At the Malolos Convention, he was promoted to brigadier general and appointed deputy to the Congress by General Emilio Aguinaldo, president of the first Philippine Republic. When he retired in the town of Murcia in Tarlac province, General Servillano was incessantly lured to enter politics, but each time he declined. Politics would be reserved for his next in line.</p>
<p>The Aquinos trace their illustrious line to their patriarch, Servillano “Mianong” Aquino, born on 20 April 1874 in Angeles, Pampanga, to Braulio Aquino and Petrona Águilar de Hipólito. The family transferred to Concepción, Tarlac, where the father became its gobernadorcillo from 1885 to 1887.</p>
<p>In her book The Rulemakers, the journalist Sheila Coronel says that political families, not ideological parties, are “the most enduring feature of Philippine legislatures, beginning with the Malolos Congress,” in fact, they are able to project themselves from a regional power base onto the national stage. To prove her point, she cites the Cojuangco and Aquino clans as examples. Both originally of Capampangan and Tagalog stock who share the same bailiwick of Tarlac province, these two families have “produced a disproportionate number of legislators dating back to 1898.” Some have intermarried, but their family branches, at varying points in Philippine history, have coincided or collided with each other’s social agenda, business interests and political visions.</p>
<p>This feature story was originally titled as Family Matters, and was published in the May 2010 issue of Tatler Philippines</p>
<p>No other chronicle of the Filipino family better encapsulates the struggles of the Philippine nation than the complex saga of the Aquino and the Cojuangco clans</p>
<p>Benigno Snr, popularly called “Igno”, took the political road offered to his father Servillano. A graduate of law at the University of Santo Tomás, he married María Urquico, daughter of prominent Tarlac rice traders, in May 1916, happily becoming a gentleman farmer at the 1,200-hectare Hacienda Tinang, perhaps urged on by his wife. At the age of 25, however, he made his first foray into local politics, winning as the representative of the Second District of Tarlac and starting the political dynasty of the Aquinos. 1928 was a year of both sorrow and joy. In March Benigno’s wife died of cancer, and three months later, at the age of 34, he was elected senator representing the Third District comprising Tarlac, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, and Bulacan. Two years later, Benigno, one of the youngest members of the Senate, married his third cousin Aurora Aquino, 16 years his junior. The senator became increasingly identified with Senate President Manuel Quezon, who made him, in quick succession, the majority floor leader, acting Senate president in Quezon’s absence and member of the council of state, the liaison between the governor-general and the legislature. The mantle of leadership would be passed either to him or to Manuel Roxas Snr. The last big political battle between Osmeña and Quezon was fought over the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Bill, with Roxas and Osmeña advocating its passage and Quezon strongly opposing it. Benigno was recruited by Quezon to stop it. On 14 November 1932 he sailed for the US, with great reluctance, as his wife was heavy with their second child. In his farewell speech delivered in Spanish, he said, “I hope to fulfil the desire of my father [Servillano], who fought for freedom in the days of the Revolution. And I feel happy that, when my child is born, it will be while his father is fighting for the independence of the Philippines, for his freedom and for other children’s freedom.”</p>
<p>The revolutionary hero, General Servillano Aquino, who twice escaped execution, is considered the patriarch of the Aquino clan Don Benigno was sure that his child would be a boy. So portentous was the event that it was Governor-General Theodore Roosevelt Jnr himself who cabled the senator on the birth of his son on 27 November 1932. That boy was his junior, Benigno Servillano, nicknamed Ninoy. In Washington, DC, Senator Benigno had a change of heart and became convinced that the H-H-C bill would be the best measure obtainable from the US Congress that would help realise Philippine independence, eventually siding with the Osmeña-Roxas mission. THE RICH COJUANGCOS Although the Aquinos dominated the Capampangan-speaking southern part of Tarlac, another fast-rising family in Ilokano-speaking northern Tarlac would come to the fore at the turn of the 20th century. The Cojuangcos trace their roots to a Chinese immigrant father and his son José Cojuangco I from Xiamen who settled in Binondo in 1861. José, popularly known as Ingkong José, married Antera Estrella, a local mestiza from Malolos, who bore him three children: Ysidra, Melecio, and Trinidad. The family engaged in rice trading and money lending. They relocated to the town of Paniqui, Tarlac, during the Revolution and continued to prosper in spite of the upheavals of the war. The family placed its political hopes on the sole heir apparent, Melecio, who won a seat as an assemblyman in the first National Assembly of 1907. However, he died of a heart attack two years later on a train bound from Manila to Tarlac, while cradled in the arms of his oldest son José. His four children—José Snr (Pepe), Juan (Itoy), Antonio, and Eduardo Snr—were raised by their mother Tecla Chichioco de Aquino and Ysidra, a spinster aunt. Doña Ysidra was deferred to as the family matriarch who, because of her acumen in the rice trade, became phenomenally wealthy. At one time she was estimated to have owned 12,000 hectares, becoming the unofficial banker of farmers and businessmen in the whole Central Luzon area.</p>
<p>Eduardo &ldquo;Endeng&rdquo; Cojuangco Snr Melecio Cojuangco, the first politician in the family</p>
<p>Don Pepe inherited his father’s mantle, becoming the three-term representative of Tarlac’s First District in early 1934. It was Senate President Quezon who persuaded Doña Ysidra to draft a young family member against Don Benigno Aquino Snr, thus starting the first in a series of electoral contests between the Aquino and Cojuangco families. Like his aunt, Don Pepe was also blessed with the Midas touch. He did not only become the Croesus of the legislature, as dubbed by the Philippine Free Press in 1934, his pioneering ventures in banking and agri-industry paid off. The four brothers, together with their mother and aunt, founded the Paniqui Sugar Mills in 1928, with Don Pepe becoming its first manager. With his three brothers and the Rufino and Jacinto families, Don Pepe co-founded in 1938 the first all-Filipino owned commercial bank, the Philippine Bank of Commerce. In 1940 the Aquino and Cojuangco families reached an agreement for the first time to field a common candidate for governor of Tarlac: Don Pepe’s youngest brother, Eduardo Snr (Endeng) who, although elected, chose not to serve out his term when the Japanese invaded the country. THE RISE OF NINOY</p>
<p>The young Ninoy Aquino World War II brought countless tribulations to the branches of the Cojuangco family. When both Eduardo and Don Pepe refused to serve under the Japanese administration, the family’s bank and sugar mill were placed under Japanese control. It was not only a twist of fate that their chief technician, Zempei Suemura, a Japanese immigrant, was able to save the plant from destruction. Fate would not also be so kind to the Benigno Aquino Snr family. Initially reluctant to serve, Don Benigno started entertaining Japanese overtures, believing that Filipinos should “try to advance the ideals [of independence] despite the evil situation.” Wooed by the Japanese occupiers, Don Benigno would capitulate to serving in the puppet administration. Thus, the issue of enemy collaboration hung heavily over the family. Yet with Manuel Roxas Snr triumphantly elected as the Third Republic’s President, it seemed that the Filipino people had put the issue of wartime collaboration behind them. Don Benigno returned to Concepción, to see whether the 1947 elections would vindicate his family as a political power. But a huge tidal wave had changed the electorate. The war years led to the rise of a peasnt guerrilla army (Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon) called the Huks. They were the rising force of the masses arrayed against the ruling class. The old Nacionalista Party was considered pro-Huk and anti-American and the Liberals were regarded as the vanguard of the landed against peasant insurgency. Don Benigno once again went on the campaign trail, but his gubernatorial candidacy would lose, handing him his first electoral defeat. Dejected, Don Benigno died shortly after of a heart attack on 20 December 1947, with his young son Ninoy at his side. Four days later his case of treason was dismissed, a national Christmas gift for a fallen and disgraced leader. The 15-year-old son was ostracised. His adored father was called a collaborationist. Year later he recalled, “Nobody wanted to talk to me in school. Those were my first traumatic experiences. I had seen the heights and now I was nobody.” After university in 1949 he was accepted as a junior reporter at The Manila Times. Starting as a cub reporter at 16, Ninoy was given choice assignments. When the Korean War broke out, he became the youngest war correspondent covering the Philippine battalion. He was barely 18 when he was awarded the Philippine Legion of Honour for his work as a journalist in the prosecution of the Korean War. At the ceremony he was accompanied by Defence Secretary Ramon Magsaysay and congratulated by President Elpidio Quirino, who told him, “You bear a great name. Be sure to keep it great.” The young teenager had recuperated the Aquino name from shame. Ninoy would quickly blaze a trail in Philippine history, becoming the special assistant to Present-elect Ramon Magsaysay, helping secure the surrender of the Huk supremo Luis Taruc, besting the efforts of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.</p>
<p>The wedding photo of Ninoy Aquino to Corazon Cojuangco changed the course of Philippine history</p>
<p>On 11 October 1954 Ninoy married Corazón “Cory” Cojuangco, daughter of the powerful politician and landowner José Cojuangco Snr and Demetria “Metring” Sumulong, the daughter of the staunch Quezon oppositionist Senator Juan Sumulong. Cory had just come back home from her American studies. Ninoy was still in the Times and newly returned from his Korean adventures. The marriage united three politically and socially important families: the José Cojuangcos, the Aquinos of Tarlac, and the Sumulongs of Rizal. That intersection would change the course of Philippine history, cause the downfall of the strongest man to ever rule the country and precipitate the startling and unlikely rise to power of a reluctant widow. THE SALAD DAYS OF THE 1950S Returning to Tarlac in 1955, Ninoy at the age of 22, was elected the youngest mayor of Concepción, but would be disqualified after seven months for being underage at the time of elections. In 1958 an important event intervened and Ninoy changed his career to agriculturist and farm manager when Compañia General de Tabacos de Filipinas (Tabacalera), the Spanish conglomerate, divested its huge trouble-hidden Hacienda Luisita in Concepción. Aided by the government of President Carlos García, the new owners, headed by Doña Ysidra and Ninoy’s father-in-law Don Pepe, were lauded for transferring the mighty Spanish property to Filipino hands. Don Pepe’s eldest nephews were invited to buy shares with Eduardo Jnr (Danding) declining and Monching accepting. Don Pepe’s eldest surviving brother Don Juan did not take part in the purchase.</p>
<p>Wedding photo of Margarita &ldquo;Tingting&rdquo; de los Reyes and Peping Cojuangco</p>
<p>Under Ninoy’s management, Hacienda Luisita became one of the most modern and technologically advanced plantations. His sterling track record in farm management and labour and peasant relations was rewarded in 1959 when he was elected the youngest Tarlac vice-governor. Switching to the Liberal Party of the incumbent President Diosdado Macapagal, he was elected the youngest governor of Tarlac province in 1963. Ninoy’s political future seemed preordained. He was young, charismatic, intelligent, loquacious and backed by wealth of his in-laws. The late 1950s would signal an era of seemingly limitless possibilities for the young generation of Aquinos and Cojuangcos. Danding married Gretchen Oppen of the prominent Negros family in December 1956, settling in recently urbanised New Manila, with their glamorous cousins and neighbors Ninoy and Cory. According to the writer Nelson Navarro, the two couples “would form a constant foursome to go to the movies, dine out and share leisure activities common to couples just starting their families and careers.” Gretchen recalled those salad days, explaining that “Ninoy or Danding would call each other after work. Just like that. We would usually go to the movies in Avenida Rizal and then have midnight snacks at Bulakeña or Max’s. It was with Ninoy and Cory that we first saw the Banaue Rice Terraces.” The turbulent 1960s would bring all the halcyon days to a crashing end.</p>

<p>DANDING AND PEPING The extended Cojuangco family was torn apart by the competing ambitions of its branches. In January 1963 Danding and his cousin Monching agreed to vote their uncle Don Juan as the new president of the family-owned Philippine Bank of Commerce, replacing their uncle Don Pepe, long considered the patriarch of the enterprise and credited having pulled the bank out of the ashes of World War II. Devastated, Don Pepe sold his shares to Don Juan and founded another bank, the First United Bank. He also diversified into other established businesses, such as Mantrade, a key distributor of motor vehicles, and Pantranco, the transportation company. The festering disagreements between the Cojuangco branches came to a head in a 1965 Congressional match, pitting first cousins against each other in Tarlac’s First District. The writer Amante F Paredes heralded the impending political skirmish as one with significant local and national implications. He predicted that the fight of Rep José “Peping” Cojuangco Jnr, son of Don Pepe, and Danding, son of Don Eduardo Snr, was not only about “their political leadership and business supremacy which goes beyond the boundaries of Tarlac. Pitching in to lend colour and drama are the wives of the two candidates, both national beauties and socialites in Manila’s higher circles.” Margarita (Tingting) de los Reyes Cojuangco, Peping’s wife, and Gretchen, Danding’s wife, took leave of Manila’s four hundred to campaign among the barrio folk.</p>

<p>The outcome of that 1965 campaign influenced the course of Philippine history. Danding lost to his cousin Peping but came back stronger by allying himself with Senator Ferdinand Marcos, who victoriously challenged the incumbent President Diosdado Macapagal in the 1964 presidential elections. In 1967 with Danding’s help in Tarlac, Ninoy was elected the youngest ever senator at the age of 34. His election campaign took on a very different track. Selling his Concepción farm to tenants, he actively sought the support of peasants, even recruiting Bernabe Buscayno, aka Commander Dante, to campaign for him, reasoning that “the Huks are a necessary evil: they bring about social change.” Ninoy’s modus vivendi with radical elements haunted him later because military intelligence characterised him as a “Huk coddler”.

<h3 id="danding-cojuangco-i-made-the-right-decisions">&ldquo;Danding Cojuangco: I made the right decisions&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/files/2015/05/t0517menriquez-danding_feat2_1.jpg" alt="img">
Without a college degree, businessman Eduardo “Danding” M. Cojuangco Jr. sees himself as technically the least qualified person for any position in any of his companies.</p>
<p>“Had I taken up, say, accounting, I’d have been aware of all the pitfalls of entrepreneurship and been too scared to venture into anything,” he said.</p>
<p>Yet, in this one lifetime, according to Tarlac historian (and his friend) Ver Buan, Cojuangco has served as director in some 50 companies. Since 1983, he has been chair of food and infrastructure conglomerate San Miguel Corp., and is the newly elected chair of Petron Corp., the country’s largest oil-refining company.</p>
<p>Over lunch at Fortune, his favorite Chinese restaurant in Tarlac City, Cojuangco charmed guests at his table with his candor.</p>
<p>“I’ve led a full life—full of controversies,” he said, chuckling. (He would later whisper a request to this writer, to please make no references to his personal life.)</p>
<p>Since his kidney transplant in December 2013, Cojuangco has taken to wearing a mask in crowded places. “I could pick up an infection very easily, on account of the anti-rejection pills,” he explained.</p>
<p>He is on a strict diet and has lost considerable weight. “They are controlling my diabetes very well. I’ve always been a bad boy when it comes to sweets,” he confessed. Still, he seemed to enjoy the sumptuous lunch.</p>
<p>The enigmatic tycoon turns 80 in June, but he would rather mark what he feels are more important milestones—the Eduardo Cojuangco Foundation’s (ECF) 30th anniversary and the launch of Project Hope. The latter aims to teach technical, vocational and entrepreneurial skills to Tarlac’s out-of-school youth and unemployed young adults, and to provide them with job opportunities.</p>
<p>Cojuangco recalled that his 75th birth anniversary coincided with ECF’s 25th and the takeoff of Project Free, a program that gave scholarships to 2,000 public school teachers. The beneficiaries enrolled in masters’ or doctorate programs at the Tarlac State University under the guidance of De La Salle University (DLSU) and finished with DLSU diplomas.</p>
<p>Believer in education</p>
<p>“I’m a believer in education as the best way to alleviate poverty. Even if you build classrooms, if the teachers are not capable of imparting knowledge effectively to the students, you don’t gain much more than aesthetics,” said Cojuangco.</p>
<p>La Salle is his alma mater. When school officials told him about its Department of Education’s (DepEd) Alternative Learning System, a nonformal curriculum for the underprivileged, the philanthropist saw beyond the written goals. “I thought it was a good program, taking out-of-school youth into the flow of the academe. And then what? Would that improve their lives? Not much, I think, if they have nothing to do after that,” he said.</p>
<p>He pointed out that the average monthly salary of a fresh college graduate would range from P10,000 to P20,000 while a backhoe operator’s started at P40,000. “We should change our attitude toward vocational education. We need people with these skills. If you send them abroad, jobs with good salaries will be waiting for them. In the United States, the ‘dirtier’ the job, the higher the salary.”</p>
<p>ECF has sought partnership with several institutions for Project Hope. According to managing director Joaquin Henson, ECF, along with the provincial government and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (Tesda), will provide 12 learning centers for technical and vocational training.</p>
<p>The DepEd will identify the first 1,000 beneficiaries from 511 barangays in Tarlac. La Salle Green Hills will handle values formation training for the teachers.</p>
<p>When the participants graduate, Tesda, the Department of Labor and Employment and the local government will locate jobs to match their skills.</p>
<p>From the initial 1,000 students, ECF estimates it will have trained a total of 5,000 in five years.</p>
<p>At the lunch gathering, Cojuangco delivered an impassioned speech entirely in Tagalog, saying that hopefully no youth will ever be out of school because he is a Tarlaqueño. He then offered 200 slots for chemical engineers in Petron.</p>
<p>Project Hope partners gathered to sign the memorandum of agreement. But before they did, President Benigno Aquino III, Cojuangco’s nephew, walked in to greet him from another function room to celebrate the turnover of a building donated by the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. to Tarlac National High School.</p>
<p>No politics here</p>
<p>In the past, Cojuangco’s acts of kindness were often perceived as constituting political patronage. He repeatedly stressed that Project Hope is devoid of any such agenda.</p>
<p>“I don’t want this program to be associated with politics,” he said. “I’m doing this as payback for all the loyalty and help that the people of this province have extended to me.”</p>
<p>In Tarlac, Cojuangco is respected and fondly called “Boss.” Among the prominent members of his clan, he noted, he had spent the most time in Tarlac.</p>
<p>Cojuangco was born June 10, 1935, in Paniqui to a landed family. He remembers growing up in an idyllic setting, Barangay Apulid, and walking from barrio to barrio with farm workers’ children who were his playmates.</p>
<p>His father, Eduardo Sr., was a kind landlord. As Tarlac governor in 1941, Eduardo Sr. refused to ally himself with the Japanese, avoiding the invaders by frequently changing residences.</p>
<p>Because he had to move in and out of schools, the young Danding couldn’t get a solid education.</p>
<p>When he was a high school freshman in Ateneo, he couldn’t read properly, much less cope in other subjects. The constant embarrassment and feeling of inadequacy made him sick every morning.</p>
<p>Upon the advice of a priest, Danding was given a tutor. He passed the entrance exams in De La Salle High School and was in the honors list for the first two grading periods.</p>
<p>But, like most boys, he promptly fell into a barkada and coasted along with the lowest passing marks.</p>
<p>Still, to this day, Cojuangco acknowledges La Salle for giving him what he considers a well-rounded education.</p>
<p>Eduardo Sr. died of kidney failure in 1952 at age 49. Danding, barely 17, studied briefly at the University of the Philippines Los Baños, then enrolled in a two-year program in field crops and agriculture at the California Polytechnic University in San Luis Obispo.</p>
<p>Upon his return, Cojuangco took over his father’s business, the debt-ridden International Hardwood, which produced plywood and toilet paper. “As the eldest, I tried to preserve what my father had started. After a few years I told my mother that we had no more debts, but that she should consider selling the company. In the end, we would be blamed for floods, for cutting down the trees,” he recalled.</p>
<p>Better a governor</p>
<p>With a bank loan, he established Northern Cement Corp. in Pangasinan, of which he is still chair. Tarlac historian Buan writes that Cojuangco’s other businesses involved manufacturing, food and beverage, agriculture, edible oil processing, private banking, storage, and international commerce.</p>
<p>“Whatever I have now, I did not inherit; I worked for all of it,” said Cojuangco.</p>
<p>In the mid-’60s, then Senate President Ferdinand Marcos urged Cojuangco to join his Nacionalista Party in the 1965 elections. He ran for congressman against estranged cousin Jose “Peping” Cojuangco Jr. but lost.</p>
<p>Eventually, Cojuangco was elected Tarlac governor and served from 1967 to 1969. From 1969 to 1972, he finally served as congressman. “It’s easier to be a congressman. Madaldal ka lang sa Kongreso, magdala ka lang ng pork barrel, ayos na. Bilang gubernador, kailangan magpakita ka, hindi lang diskurso. (You just gab in Congress, then bring out the pork barrel and you’re made. As governor, you have to show concrete achievements, not discourses.) I’d rather be governor.”</p>
<p>Today, Cojuangco continues the work of development in the private sector and through his philanthropy. “In all my companies, I try to be a governor. I hope that’s a good analogy.”</p>
<p>Asked how he thought he came to head several companies despite not having a diploma, he replied, “One at a time. I made the right decisions in acquiring these companies that no one thought could be acquired.”</p>
<p>Though he acknowledges that it’s a cliché, he is prone to saying he is successful because “somebody up there likes me. I am blessed. I have shortcomings, but I’ve always tried to be a good Christian.”</p>
<p>Famed for his decisiveness and risk-taking, Cojuangco always considered failure a part of success. “You lose some, you win some,” he said. “You have to take both.”</p>

<p><img src="https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/files/2019/09/119678507_S.jpg" alt="img">
COPENHAGEN, Denmark — One of Norway’s wealthiest men was arrested Tuesday in connection with his wife’s 2018 disappearance and held on suspicion of murder or complicity to murder in a case that police had earlier thought was a kidnapping.</p>
<p>Tom Hagen, a media-shy real estate investor and owner of an electric company, was arrested on his way to work, chief police investigator Tommy Broeske said.</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>The case had made headlines in the Scandinavian country, where police first reported that Anne-Elizabeth Falkevik Hagen had been abducted. Police had been told of her disappearance on October 31, 2018, but didn’t publicly speak about it until January 9, 2019, after which hundreds of tips poured in.</p>
<p>“The case is characterized by a clearly planned deception,” Broeske told a news conference Tuesday in Oslo. “As other hypotheses have been weakened, suspicions against Tom Hagen have gradually been strengthened.”</p>
<p>Prosecutor Aase Kjustad Eriksson said authorities would seek Wednesday to have Hagen held for four weeks in pre-trial custody and that more arrests were possible.</p>
<p>Police declined to elaborate on a motive due to the ongoing investigation.</p>
<p>The 69-year-old childhood sweetheart that Hagen had married at age 19 disappeared from the couple’s home in Loerenskog, east of Oslo, authorities said.</p>
<p>A ransom for her release was demanded, police said in January 2019 but declined to give the amount.</p>
<p>Norwegian newspaper VG said it was for 9 million euros ($850,980) to be paid in a cryptocurrency popular among cyber-criminals.</p>
<p>Police eventually released security videos of men walking back and forth outside Hagen’s workplace.</p>
<p>Officers and police dogs were also seen scouring the grounds around the couple’s home and divers went into a nearby pond as police led a large investigation at home and abroad.</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>In June 2019, police changed their main hypothesis because of the absence of any signs that the missing woman was still alive or any recent contacts with the alleged kidnappers. They believe Falkevik Hagen, who has never been found, had been killed and said they “cannot exclude a staged kidnapping to hide it.”</p>
<p>Tom Hagen, the second-oldest in a farming family of 12 children, struck it rich in the real estate business he started in 1978. His fortune is estimated to be worth nearly 1.7 billion kroner ($161 million).</p>

Death in the House; Rainbow Coalition and BOT; bases to cities Share it! Share Tweet</p>
<p>PEACE-MAKER</p>
<p>By FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE JOSE C. DE VENECIA, JR.</p>
<p>A few days ago, with wife Gina, we joined the Albano family of Isabela, friends and colleagues in paying our last tributes to an old friend, Congressman Rodolfo Albano Jr., who passed away last week. He was 85.</p>
<p>Rudy Albano, a veteran legislator, served as congressman for some 30 years, succeeding his distinguished father Rodolfo Sr., one of the pioneering leaders in the Cagayan Valley. Rudy and we both first became congressmen in 1969, during the 7th Congress, and served until 1972 when martial law was declared. We were then in our early 30s.</p>
<p>Some of our colleagues in the pre-martial law House of Representatives were the veteran Cornelio Villareal of Capiz, Jose B. Laurel Jr. of Batangas, Nicanor Yniguez of Leyte, and Ramon Mitra, Jr. of Palawan, who all became speakers of the House; Jose Zulueta of Iloilo, Neptali Gonzales of Rizal, who both became Senate president; Roque Ablan of Ilocos Norte, Floro Crisologo of Ilocos Sur, and parliamentary expert Raul Daza and industrialist Danding Cojuangco of Samar and Tarlac, respectively, who are now in their mid-80’s and are still fit and healthy.</p>
<p>When we formed the historic Rainbow Coalition in the House in 1992, at the start of the Fidel Ramos presidency, Rudy Albano was our indefatigable assistant majority leader and became majority leader during our second term as speaker of the House from 1995 to 1998, and helped enable us to be elected speaker five times. “Manong” Rudy’s commitment to public service is being continued by his distinguished sons, Rep. Antonio Albano and Gov. Rodolfo Albano III.</p>
<p>In the historical, political, and economic context, the House of Representatives in 1992 was still in the midst of a difficult transition. Thereafter followed the positive successful terms of Speakers Manuel Villar, Arnulfo Fuentebella, Prospero Nograles, Feliciano Belmonte, Jr., Pantaleon Alvarez, and Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who earlier was president of the republic.</p>
<p>We also had to initiate reforms on multiple fronts. Many problems claimed high priority — zero economic growth, widespread unemployment and underemployment, prolonged brownouts, a frightening three-pronged insurgency threat from the Communist CPP-NPA, the Islamic secession-threatening Muslim National Liberation Front (MNLF) in Mindanao, and the pressing right-wing military RAM-YOU-SFP mutiny.</p>
<p>Our historic Rainbow Coalition passed 228 reform laws in legislative-executive partnership that led to a modest economic miracle for the Philippines in the mid-1990s. Observers wrote that so significant was the reform package that GNP growth reached above 6 percent by 1997, up from one-half of one percent when the Rainbow Coalition began.</p>
<p>Among the landmark, game-changing initiatives that the Rainbow Coalition passed was the creation of the Executive-Legislative Development Advisory Council (LEDAC), which set the stage for the sustained executive-legislative cooperation, Special Economic Zones, and the new Central Bank.</p>
<p>In between, we created the International Conference of Asian Political Parties (ICAPP), now representing 352 ruling, opposition, and independent political parties in Asia, and co-founded the Tehran-based Asian Parliamentary Assembly (APA), composed of 40 parliaments in Asia, and the Asian Peace and Reconciliation Council (APRC), based in Bangkok.</p>
<p>They are active parliamentary or political organizations, while APRC, is composed of former heads of government, leaders of parliament, and foreign policy specialists, led by former Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Surakiart Sathirathai of Thailand.</p>
<p>We also passed the landmark B-O-T (Build-Operate-Transfer) Law, which became a model for many other developing countries and the formula for “Public-Private Partnerships.” In the Philippines, the law has made possible private investments and public-private partnerships in infrastructure projects valued in excess of $30 billion as early as the mid-1990’s.</p>
<p>We authored and initiated as well the game-changing Military Bases Conversion Law, which turned the former American military bases on Luzon island — the biggest of them being Clark Air Field and Subic Naval Base, including Baguio’s Camp John Hay, La Union’s Camp Wallace and Poro Point, Bataan’s Mariveles Free Trade Zone, and Cebu’s Mactan — into thriving export zones, free ports, or industrial parks.</p>
<p>The wide-ranging law also converted the Filipino military camps Fort Bonifacio into the now booming satellite city in Metro Manila and the Resorts World in the old Nichols Air Base, also in Metro Manila, helping contribute to the modest Philippine economic miracle and encouraged other Asian cities to create similar special economic zones (SEZs) and major industrial parks.</p>
<p>In a very real sense, the Philippine bases conversions into cities or metropolitan centers in the 1950’s and beyond, as in Clark, Subic, Sangley in Cavite, and Mactan in Cebu, were adopted by other large Asian, Middle Eastern, and African townships which converted into cities from their more rural origins as migration and industries enlarged and diversified and as the US and European military bases largely disengaged and withdrew back to their American and European homelands with the lessening in the US-Russian tensions and in the Cold War.</p>
