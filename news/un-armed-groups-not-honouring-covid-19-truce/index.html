Amed groups in Yemen, Syria, and Libya have not fully adhered to a United Nations call to lay down their guns during the novel coronavirus pandemic, the world body’s chief Antonio Guterres said on Friday.</p>
<p>Speaking with reporters via a video link, Guterres said that his call for a global ceasefire had been well received around the world by Pope Francis and many others as part of efforts to tackle COVID-19 and the economic chaos it has unleashed.</p>
<p>But he noted that violence has “spiked” in Yemen and “escalated” in Libya, while Syria has witnessed ongoing tensions, even as the country has recorded some local COVID-19 cases that could prove too much for the country’s battered health system.</p>
<p>In many of the most critical situations, we have seen no let-up in fighting — and some conflicts have even intensified. We need robust diplomatic efforts to meet these challenges. To silence the guns, we must raise the voices for peace,</p>
<p>said Guterres, the UN secretary-general and a former Prime Minister of Portugal.</p>
<p>The world body has deployed peace envoys to try and broker an end to conflicts in countries including Syria, Yemen, and Libya, while also providing humanitarian assistance to stop millions of civilians perishing from famine and disease.</p>

<p>Guterres warned that health systems in war-torn countries have been battered by years of fighting and the small number of health professionals who have stuck it out were often targeted by airstrikes and ground attacks.</p>
<p>“There is a chance for peace, but we are far from there,” said Guterres.

Oil Prices Surge After Trump Hints at Saudi-Russian Truce</p>
<p>Here is today’s Foreign Policy brief: Trump teases an oil price agreement, the U.S. employment report is due today, and global coronavirus cases exceed 1 million.</p>

<p>Oil Prices Surge After Trump Teases Price Agreement</p>
<p>Oil prices posted record daily increases yesterday after U.S. President Donald Trump teased the possibility of a truce in the Saudi-Russian price war and a dramatic cut in oil production. Trump said production could decrease by as much as 15 million barrels per day, prompting Brent Crude prices to surge 47 percent before settling back down to about 30 dollars per barrel.</p>
<p>Foreign Policy’s Keith Johnson helps put the move in context, “There is no actual agreement to trim production among the three biggest oil producers—the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia—let alone the other members of OPEC or other countries, like Mexico or Brazil. And it’s also unclear what Trump was even referring to in terms of production cuts—whether total barrels of oil or barrels per day or who might be making the cuts or why.”</p>
<p>Dmitry Peskov, a Russian government spokesman, said no such deal is currently on the table, however, Saudi Arabia immediately called for a meeting between the OPEC plus members “and other countries” to seek a deal.</p>
<p>The United States has traditionally not been a part of these kinds of meetings, but its new status as the world’s largest oil producer, coupled with its particularly expensive method of extracting oil, means that things could be about to change. Ryan Sitton, a regulator of the Texas oil industry, said he has talked with Russia Energy Minister Alexander Novak about the possibility of a 10 million barrel per day cut. President Trump meets with oil industry executives today, with U.S. strategy likely to top the agenda.</p>
<p>With the world under lockdown, isn’t a production cut already a necessity? In the short-term, no. Both Russia and Saudi Arabia have enough in cash reserves to ride out any price drop, especially in Russia’s case. Smaller producers do not have that luxury, and so are more likely to go along with any deal. One immediate problem that cratering demand is causing the oil industry is physical storage capacity: If stores are overloaded and can’t be shifted, oil fields may have to cease production entirely—and it can be difficult to start back up again. Cutting production helps solve that issue. “It’s a lot more important to slow the flow of oil into storage to prevent the price from catastrophically collapsing,” Kevin Book, managing director at research firm ClearView Energy Partners, told FP.</p>
<p>How much is the United States likely to influence the talks? The extent of U.S. involvement will be become clearer following Trump’s meeting with oil executives, however, signals of U.S. strategy are beginning to emerge. U.S. Special Representative for Venezuela Elliott Abrams made use of U.S. leverage over Russian oil producer Rosneft by signaling that he would consider dropping sanctions against the company. “If Rosneft Trading has nothing to do with Venezuela, then the sanctions that are based on its conduct in Venezuela or with respect to Venezuela should be lifted … I don’t know if that’s true yet,” he said.</p>
<p>What We’re Following Today</p>
<p>U.S. employment statistics. At 8:30 a.m. in Washington, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics will produce its monthly update on the U.S. employment situation. However, since its methods of calculation rely largely on data from before the worst coronavirus-related shocks, more accurate numbers are not likely until early May.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the United States shattered its previous weekly record number of jobless claims, as 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment. That figure is likely higher, as many state labor departments were not able to keep up with demand. According to a new poll by the Associated Press, about half of all working Americans reported a drop in household income as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Commander of coronavirus-stricken aircraft carrier dismissed. The U.S. Navy is to remove the commander of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt after a letter he wrote, outlining deteriorating conditions on the vessel, was leaked to the media. Over 100 sailors onboard have tested positive for the coronavirus, and the ship has docked at a naval base in Guam in order to cope with the outbreak. Speaking to Reuters, anonymous officials said the commander, Captain Brett Crozier, was being relieved because it is believed he was the source of the media leak.</p>
<p>U.S. aircraft carriers are likely to be shifted around in response to the pandemic, and FP’s Jack Detsch reports that the United States will remove an aircraft carrier previously slated to stay in the Persian Gulf. It’s not yet clear where the carrier will now go, but it’s expected to deploy to the Pacific.</p>
<p>Coronavirus cases top one million. As U.S. cases continue to rack up, the number of reported coronavirus cases worldwide has passed the 1 million mark—doubling in the past week. In New York, where over 92,000 cases have been reported, Governor Andrew Cuomo said the state only had enough ventilators stocked to last the next six days.</p>
<p>EU apologizes to Italy. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has apologized to Italy for the bloc’s coronavirus response, as dormant tensions resurface between Europe’s north and south. In a letter in the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, Von der Leyen said the European Union would set aside 100 billion euros to assist the worst hit countries and that “Today Europe is rallying to Italy’s side.” The letter did not mention the so-called coronabonds that Italy has requested, and northern countries like the Netherlands and Germany have balked at. Earlier this week, FP’s Keith Johnson reported on why an agreement on a financial solution to the coronavirus crisis is so hard to find.</p>
<p>North Macedonia joins NATO. In a joint statement, NATO’s foreign ministers welcomed North Macedonia as NATO’s 30th alliance member. North Macedonia removed a major stumbling block to its accession earlier in the process by changing its name from Macedonia and thereby ending a dispute with fellow member Greece.</p>
<p>Keep an Eye On</p>
<p>UN calls for Yemen peace talks. The United Nations has renewed a call for talks between warring groups in the protracted war in Yemen, Reuters reports. The UN has proposed convening the Yemeni government, the Saudi-led coalition, and the Houthis in a bid to establish a ceasefire between the sides. The Saudi coalition bombed the Houthi-held Yemeni capital Sanaa earlier this week in retaliation for an attempted missile strike on Riyadh by Houthi forces.</p>
<p>ECJ rules in refugee case. Hungary has again fallen foul of the European Union after the European Court of Justice ruled that they, along with the Czech Republic and Poland, “failed to fulfill their obligations under European Union law” in not meeting refugee quotas established during the 2015 migrant crisis. The Czech Republic took in 12 refugees, while Hungary and Poland took in none, citing threats to public safety. The three countries are now likely to face fines from the EU.</p>
<p>Afghan prisoner swaps begin. In the first step of confidence-building measures ahead of potential peace talks, the process of prisoner exchanges is beginning between the Afghan government and Taliban. To start, 100 Taliban militant prisoners and 20 imprisoned Afghan forces will be released, according to statements by both sides. The Taliban has demanded that 5,000 of its prisoners be released before peace talks can begin.</p>
<p>FP Conference Call—Please join Foreign Policy for a lively discussion on the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic today at 11 a.m. EST. FP Managing Editor Ravi Agrawal will be in conversation with Raghuram Rajan, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund and former governor of India’s central bank, and Adam Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Join the livestream here.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>The residents of Chicureo, north of the Chilean capital Santiago, probably wish an invasion of wild mountain goats was their only problem. With Santiago under lockdown, mountain lions have now begun venturing deeper into the city, with one found exploring a Chicureo apartment complex late Wednesday night. Chilean authorities say they have already captured two lions in the past ten days. Marcelo Giagnoni, the regional director of Chile’s Agriculture and Livestock Service, said drought in the Andes foothills surrounding Santiago likely drew the animals closer to the city. Chicureo’s mountain lion has been transferred to the Santiago zoo, where it will be examined before being released.</p>
<p>That’s it for today.</p>

<h3 id="we-need-a-coronavirus-truce">We Need a Coronavirus Truce</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/dropzone/2018/06/cp-og-logo.png" alt="img">
by</p>
<p>During World War I, soldiers all along the Western front held a series of informal truces in December 1914 to commemorate Christmas.</p>
<p>It was early in the war, and opposition had not yet hardened into implacable enmity. The military command, caught by surprise, could not impose complete battlefield discipline. An estimated 100,000 British and German soldiers participated. They exchanged smokes, sang together, and even, on at least one occasion that has since been widely mythologized, played a game of soccer.</p>
<p>Imagine how different the world would look today if that truce had held, if it had turned into a lasting ceasefire, if Europe had not burned itself to the ground in a fit of nationalist pique. There might not have been a global flu epidemic spread by soldiers in 1918. The Nazis might not have seized power and precipitated the Holocaust. World War II might never have happened and nuclear weapons never used.</p>
<p>At the very least, nearly 20 million people would not have perished in that first world war.</p>
<p>We are now in the early stages of another world war, call it World War III, this time against the common enemy of pandemic. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres last week called on all countries to observe a global ceasefire to focus all resources on beating back the coronavirus. “The fury of the virus illustrates the folly of war,” he concluded.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, eight countries that have been suffering under economic sanctions — China, Cuba, Iran, Nicaragua, North Korea, Russia, Syria, and Venezuela — have appealed for an end to the economic sanctions that are hampering their efforts to battle the disease.</p>
<p>And a number of civil organizations are pressing for the release of political prisoners, jailed journalists, and as many nonviolent offenders as possible to reduce the crowding that makes prisons a potential killing ground for the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, there has been pushback to the idea of even temporarily ending these three expressions of state power: military conflict, war by economic means, and mass incarceration. But this pandemic, for all of its ongoing horrors, can serve as a jolt of smelling salts. International cooperation needs to take priority right now, and countries must stop their wars against one another and against their own populations.</p>
<p>Bombs, sanctions, and prisons are not effective tools in the fight against the coronavirus. Indeed, by aiding and abetting the enemy, they will only make the war worse.</p>
<p>Silencing the Guns?</p>
<p>There has been much talk of repurposing the U.S. military to fight the coronavirus. Two Army field hospitals have been sent to New York and Seattle. Some soldiers have already been deployed, the National Guard has been activated in three states, and the Pentagon has been authorized to call up former soldiers to help in the fight. But the military is, to use an apt simile, like a large battleship that is not easily turned. The Pentagon hasn’t even allowed immigrant doctors in its ranks to help against the pandemic.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Pentagon continues to pursue its prime directive: planning war and killing people. On March 12, the United States conducted air strikes against Iran-backed militias in Iraq, in response to attacks that killed two U.S. service personnel. It was billed as a “proportional” response. Yet the Pentagon has been pushing a far more ambitious plan to go to war against Iranian proxies and, ultimately, Iran itself.</p>
<p>“Some top officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Robert C. O’Brien, the national security adviser, have been pushing for aggressive new action against Iran and its proxy forces — and see an opportunity to try to destroy Iranian-backed militia groups in Iraq as leaders in Iran are distracted by the pandemic crisis in their country,” write Mark Mazzetti and Eric Schmitt in The New York Times.</p>
<p>In nearby Afghanistan, the United States and the Taliban signed a peace deal at the end of February. But any end to the war in Afghanistan will require a truce among the factions within the country, indeed within the government itself. After a disputed presidential election that once again pitted President Ashraf Ghani against chief rival Abdullah Abdullah, even the threat of reduced U.S. aid didn’t persuade the two sides to unify.</p>
<p>The fighting continues on the ground, with air strikes against the Taliban most recently on March 24as well a series of Taliban attacks in the last week against Afghan soldiers and policemen. In the leadup to the signing of the peace agreement, the United States conducted the second highest number of air attacks for the month of February since 2009. And last year, Afghanistan sustained the most U.S. aerial attacks since 2006.</p>
<p>Wars grind on in other parts of the world, pandemic be damned. All sides declared a truce in Syria in early March, but Turkey exchanged attacks with “radical groups” in Idlib province on March 19. This week, Israeli war planes targeted a Syrian military base near Homs. And the Islamic State has indicated that it sees the coronavirus as an opportunity to step up attacks — like a recent massacre at a Sikh temple in Kabul — because the last thing the “crusaders” want is “to send additional soldiers to regions where there is a chance for a spread of the disease.” However, COVID-19 will most harm Syrian refugees, particularly the recent wave of nearly a million people who fled Idlib and Aleppo in December.</p>
<p>In Libya, both sides of the civil war agreed to a humanitarian truce that evaporated after only a day and now the fighting there has even intensified. Whoever wins Tripoli will take over a capital with an already ravaged infrastructure and a collapsed economy. The Pyrrhic victor will then have to address a mounting health emergency with ever diminishing resources.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Yemen, which is on track to becoming the poorest country in the world because of its five-year-long war, the combatants agreed to a truce last week. As in Libya, it hasn’t lasted long. The Houthis have since launched some easily intercepted ballistic missiles at Saudi Arabia, which retaliated by once again bombing Sana’a, the capital of Yemen.</p>
<p>Conflicts throughout Africa — in Cameroon, Chad, Nigeria, Mozambique, Mali — also continue despite pleas for a truce. Neither has al-Shabaab stopped its suicide bombings nor the United States ceased its drone attacks in Somalia.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the world, there’s no pandemic pause for a series of equally deadly cold wars.</p>
<p>Weaponizing Sanctions</p>
<p>For years, the United States has tried to shut down North Korea’s economic relations with the outside world as a way to force the government to negotiate away its nuclear weapons program. North Korea devised a variety of methods to get around U.S. and UN sanctions, including illicit transfers of oil from foreign ships to North Korean vessels in the middle of the ocean.</p>
<p>But the most lucrative source of goods and revenues continued to be China, which has been responsible for upwards of 95 percent of North Korea’s trade. Washington has intermittently put pressure on Beijing to shut down this trade to pressure Pyongyang to return to the negotiating table. It hasn’t worked.</p>
<p>Then the coronavirus hit. By the end of January, North Korea had shut its borders with China to minimize the risk of infection. It even issued a directive to guard posts to put a stop to flourishing smuggling operations. What sanctions couldn’t accomplish in years, the virus managed to achieve in weeks.</p>
<p>Despite these precautionary measures, the coronavirus has no doubt reached North Korea. There have been reports of probable coronavirus-related deaths in the North Korean military. Thousands of people have been quarantined. Even as the North Korean government insists that the country remains pandemic-free, it has quietly appealed to other governments for assistance in addressing the disease.</p>
<p>The United States has so far held firm. Even though sanctions are holding up the delivery of critical humanitarian aid, Washington has refused to reconsider sanctions. Secretary of State Pompeo continues to talk as if a pandemic isn’t raging outside: “The G-7 and all nations must remain united in calling on North Korea to return to negotiations and stay committed to applying diplomatic and economic pressure over its illegal nuclear and ballistic missile programs.”</p>
<p>Pompeo has been even more ruthless toward Iran, an early pandemic hotspot. Tehran initially fumbled its response to a disease, which was quickly spreading through the populace as well as the political and religious leadership. As Human Rights Watch has meticulously detailed, U.S. economic sanctions have only made a bad situation worse.</p>
<p>Yes, the U.S. government formally permits humanitarian aid to the country. But its sanctions regime — which includes the threat of secondary sanctions against entities that engage Tehran — ensures that banks and companies steer clear of Iran. Pompeo’s take: “Things are much worse for the Iranian people, and we’re convinced that will lead the Iranian people to rise up and change the behavior of the regime.”</p>
<p>That’s also pretty much the U.S. strategy toward Venezuela, which is in an even more vulnerable position. Though it only has a little more than 130 confirmed cases, COVID-19 will likely ravage the weakened country. “Only a quarter of Venezuela’s doctors have access to a reliable supply of water and two-thirds are without soap, gloves or masks,” reports The Guardian. “There are 73 intensive care beds in the whole country.”</p>
<p>This week, the Trump administration conditioned any reduction in sanctions on a political deal that requires President Nicolas Maduro to step down in favor of a transitional council that includes the political opposition. The current government has rejected this regime-change option.</p>
<p>These maximum pressure tactics toward North Korea, Iran, Venezuela, and others recently led Washington Post columnist Jackson Diehl, who is no softy on foreign affairs, to conclude that Pompeo’s “pandemic performance will ensure his place among the worst ever” secretaries of state.</p>
<p>Emptying the Prisons</p>
<p>Egypt freed 15 prominent oppositionists on March 21. A few days earlier, Bahrain let go nearly 1,500 detainees, but no prominent human rights activists or political oppositionists. Iran has released85,000 prisoners, but only temporarily. Turkey is planning to release 90,000 prisoners, but none of them political.</p>
<p>Prisons are the perfect breeding ground for the coronavirus: poor sanitary conditions, overcrowding, minimal medical facilities. Many countries, including the United States, are looking into ways of reducing the population behind bars.</p>
<p>The Committee to Protect Journalists is mobilizing support to pressure governments to release the 250 journalists who are currently in prison worldwide. UN High Commissioner on Human Rights Michelle Bachelet has urged countries to reduce the numbers of people in detention, with a special emphasis on political prisoners. “Now, more than ever, governments should release every person detained without sufficient legal basis, including political prisoners and others detained simply for expressing critical or dissenting views,” she said last week.</p>
<p>Those behind bars are frequently the victims of various government campaigns: against a free press, against political dissent, against drugs. But when a major war threatens the homeland, prisoners are sometimes drafted into military service. That happened during the French colonial period and by different sides in World War II.</p>
<p>In World War III, we need everyone on our side. If countries don’t significantly empty out their prisons during this COVID-19 crisis, the inmates as well as the guards will likely be drafted by the enemy. This foe only gets stronger as our petty conflicts continue and the stiffest sanctions remain in place.</p>
<p>It’s time for a truce on all fronts — or else we will surely lose the larger war.
