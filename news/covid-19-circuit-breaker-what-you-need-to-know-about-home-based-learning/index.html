SPED teachers will also continue to provide students and their parents with HBL support for the customised curriculum and maintain regular contact.</p>
<p>Throughout the HBL, teachers and other school personal will continue to work from home or from school to support students. School staff will also keep in contact with them and their parents.</p>
<p>The Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) platform will continue to be accessible to students during this period. Students who require digital devices or internet access will be assisted.</p>
<p>Schools will continue to provide instructions and support for student sto access a range of both online and hardcopy HBL materials.</p>
<p>MOE and MSF will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation to assess if these measures need to be prolonged.</p>
<p>Private education institutions should move to HBL as well, or suspend classes.</p>
<p>In addition, all preschools, MOE Kinderartens and student care centres, including special student care centres, will suspend their general services during this period.</p>
<p>As part of heightened safe distancing measures during the COVID-19 circuit breaker , all primary, secondary, Pre-University and IHL students, including students from Special Education (SPED) schools will shift to full Home-Based learning.</p>
<p>We are implementing a national circuit breaker policy and schools are an important part of it. It will help us move towards a position where we can enhance safe distancing, cut down on social interactions significantly and reduce transmissions.</p>
<p>For those with are unable to secure alternative childcare arrangements during this time</p>
<p>Parents are strongly encouraged to keep their children at home during this period.</p>
<p>Those working in essential services such as healthcare who are unable to secure alternative care arrangements, such as those working in essential services, may approach their children’s schools for assistance.</p>
<p>Similarly, preschools will only serve a limited group of parents who are unable to find alternative care arrangments.</p>
<p>Examinations during this time</p>
<p>Cancelled: All school-based mid-year examinations;</p>
<p>Proceed as planned, with additional precautionary measures: National examinations, including the mid-year-GCE O- and A-Level Mother Tongue examinations, Year-End examinations and PSLE.</p>
<p>====</p>
<p>Qn: Can students still come back to school premises during this time?</p>
<p>Students are therefore strongly advised to stay at home and avoid going out unnecessarily, unless they have been identified for the limited service arrangements or to use the school computers for HBL, which allow them to be in school during the HBL days. Schools and IHLs will be in touch with their students on the necessary arrangements.</p>
<p>Qn: Is the SLS equipped to accommodate all students under full HBL?</p>
<p>During the national one-day Home-Based Learning (HBL), while most students and teachers were able to access Student Learning Space (SLS) for their lessons, some experienced intermittent availability of the system on the morning of the first day for primary schools, especially between 8.00am and 9.50am. MOE resolved the issue through a series of technical measures to better manage the increased user numbers. There was a smoother experience on the second and third days of HBL for the secondary schools and JC/CI.</p>
<p>MOE has also advised schools on practices that they can adopt to ensure a smooth experience for all SLS users, such as encouraging students to adhere to their allocated log in times to the SLS system to complete their online assignments. MOE will also ensure that the system remains accessible to users throughout the full HL period.</p>
<p>In addition to SLS, schools employ different online tools and resources for lessons, or assign learning through offline modes, such as issuing assignments to students using textbooks and workbooks.</p>
<p>Qn: I have three children and do not have enough devices at home for their Home-Based Learning (HBL). What should I do?</p>
<p>HBL involves both online and offline approaches to learning. Therefore, not all HBL will require the use of devices and your children can take turns to use the device.</p>
<p>If the HBL plan issued by the school requires the use of a computer/device and your child is not equipped with one, do approach your child&rsquo;s school for assistance.</p>
<p>All schools are equipped with sufficient devices to loan out to students for online HBL. Schools can also assist if the child does not have access to the internet at home.</p>
<p>Qn: If we have to go through a prolonged period of Home-Based Learning (HBL), what will happen to exams?</p>
<p>For school-based examinations, schools will review and adjust their plans to ensure continuity of teaching, learning and assessment through HBL.</p>
<p>For national examinations, MOE recognises these are major milestones and will ensure that these examinations will proceed as far as possible so that graduating students are not disadvantaged. MOE/SEAB will take various measures to lessen the impact of prolonged HBL on students. For example, if curriculum time cannot be fully recovered, MOE will consider removing certain topics from the examinations (both for school-based and for national examinations) and the mark scheme will take this into account. When awarding grades, MOE will also take into consideration the exceptional circumstances to ensure that no students are disadvantaged. As of now, national examinations will proceed with no adjustments necessary.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: To help Singapore residents through their efforts to stay home in a bid to curb the spread of COVID-19, a series of media and digital-related initiatives was announced on Wednesday (Apr 8).</p>
<p>These include providing more content for viewers on free-to-air channels, as well as on Singtel and StarHub&rsquo;s pay-TV platforms.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) said it will also support telcos in making investments to upgrade their networks. In addition, it will help low-income students who require digital access for home-based learning.</p>
<p>These initiatives come as Singapore kicked off a month-long &ldquo;circuit breaker&rdquo; period on Tuesday. Most workplaces are closed, schools have moved to full home-based learning and dining in at food and beverage outlets are not allowed.</p>
<p>A new law also came into force on Wednesday, banning social gatherings of any size in both private and public spaces, including private parties or gatherings with families or friends not living together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The initiatives will ensure that everyone, especially vulnerable segments including seniors and school-going children from low-income households, can go online for daily tasks and social activities,&rdquo; said IMDA in a media release.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>&ldquo;IMDA will help to ensure that all who need to can stay connected from the safety of their homes, whether for telecommuting, home-based learning, accessing information and entertainment, or staying in touch with family and friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Minister for Communications and Information S Iswaran said: &ldquo;We thought it is timely to put this out so that as people embark on the circuit breaker period, they are well-equipped to deal with some of the challenges in the changing lifestyle patterns that they have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ENSURING A STRONG, ROBUST INTERNET EXPERIENCE</p>
<p>IMDA said Singapore&rsquo;s telecommunication infrastructure remains robust and stable with a healthy network buffer, even as Internet usage has increased since the start of the COVID-19 situation.</p>
<p>This stability is due to sustained investments over the years, said IMDA.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the authority said it will support the three telcos – Singtel, StarHub and M1 – in making &ldquo;immediate investments&rdquo; to upgrade their networks and &ldquo;further bolster Singapore&rsquo;s nationwide network capacity&rdquo;.</p>
<p>“Our network capacity has comfortably (been) able to accommodate all the changing patterns in broadband usage,” Mr Iswaran told reporters during a virtual press conference on Wednesday, noting that data showed at least a “30 per cent” buffer in network capacity here.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, authorities are working with the telcos to see how further enhancements to the network capacity can be done “as soon as possible”.</p>
<p>He said: “We think that the significant enhancements can be achieved in probably the next 2 weeks or so.”</p>
<p>The upgrades are expected to support consistent network experiences at residential areas, in response to the shift in network usage from commercial and office spaces to residential areas. Capacity at potential high traffic sites will also be progressively boosted, said IMDA.</p>
<p>One example is the foreign worker dormitories, said Mr Iswaran, noting that this is an area that needs “additional effort” now that workers will be staying indoors and will want access to content or connect with their families back home.</p>
<p>A “significant proportion” of the dormitories have wifi available and for those that do not have these in place, IMDA is working with the telcos and dorm operators to put in the relevant infrastructure.</p>
<p>“We think that this is something that can be accomplished over the next 1 to 2 weeks,” he said.</p>
<p>“IMDA (will) work with telcos and dormitory operators to adapt the solution for the needs of these dormitories, depending on the prevailing conditions in the dormitories.”</p>
<p>MORE TV CHOICES</p>
<p>The authority is also working with Mediacorp, pay TV operators Singtel and StarHub, as well as other content providers to make available more news, educational and entertainment programmes across free-to-air and over-the-top platforms - across a range of languages.</p>
<p>Mediacorp, for instance, will extend the time belts for Suria and Vasantham channels with immediate effect, said IMDA. During this period, both channels will begin transmission from 9am daily.</p>
<p>Singtel will increase its total number of free preview channels to 30 starting from Thursday. Non-subscribers can also download its CAST streaming services to access the free preview channels. StarHub will increase its free preview channels to 32, starting Wednesday, for its customers.</p>
<p>Both operators will offer a wide range of content spanning all four national languages, ranging from premium content such as BBC Earth and Discovery to children&rsquo;s content like Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon, and Asian content like cHK, Hub Sensasi, JiaLe, Oh!K, TVB Jade and Zee Thirai.</p>
<p>HELPING LOW-INCOME STUDENTS GET DIGITAL ACCESS</p>
<p>IMDA also said it would provide more help to those who need digital access, including low-income students who require it for home-based learning.</p>
<p>Enhancements have been made to the NEU PC Plus (NPP) programme, which supports such students with a subsidised computer and free fibre broadband.</p>
<p>Since the circuit breaker measures were announced last Friday, IMDA said it has seen a more than five-time surge in the number of enquiries for the programme via email and calls through its contact centre.</p>
<p>The programme has helped about 4,000 to 5,000 low-income households a year since it was launched in 1999.</p>
<p>“We expect to support more children with the increased need for digital access with the heightened safe distancing measures,” an IMDA spokeperson told CNA.</p>
<p>The authority said it will speed up the provision of the NPP programme by working with the industry and community self-help groups to streamline the application process.</p>
<p>It will also ensure more support for students under the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme. Students will be fully supported through the iNSPIRE Fund, with no co-payment required for the computer. Existing requirements for community service will be waived for this period, said IMDA.</p>
<p>It would also include the option of a subsidised second computer for families with three or more school-going children.</p>
<p>This is because it has seen “strong demand” from lower-income families, especially those with more than one school-going child.</p>
<p>“For households with more children, the public can write in to appeal and IMDA will exercise some flexibility during the appeal process,” the spokesperson said in response to queries.</p>
<p>Finally, IMDA said it is working with the industry to donate cash or IT products in-kind to low-income households. Companies that have stepped forward to help include CrimsonLogic, HP Inc, Netlink NBN Trust, SGTech, Standard Chartered Bank and Tata Consultancy Services.</p>
<p>Firms that are interested to contribute may contact the Community Chest at <a href="mailto:ncss_comchest@ncss.gov.sg">ncss_comchest@ncss.gov.sg</a> or call the hotline at 1800 210 2600.</p>
<p>IMDA said it will continue to monitor developments on telecommunications and digital use in Singapore and take further action if needed.</p>
<p>In the meantime, citizens who need help with matters such as the places to buy handsets or laptops, or how to buy and learn online, can visit IMDA&rsquo;s Stay Healthy, Go Digital website for step-by-step guides and other resources.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-heightened-safe-distancing-measures-for-workplaces-during-the-circuit-breaker-period">What are the heightened safe distancing measures for workplaces during the circuit breaker period</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.gov.sg/-/media/gov/ncov/workplace_emp.jpg" alt="img">
[Updated as of 3 Apr] With the announcement of the COVID-19 Circuit Breaker, there are now heightened safe-distancing measures in place to reduce movement. Included in these measures is the suspension of activities at most workplace premises. The suspension will be in effect from 7 April 2020 until 4 May 2020, but this may be extended if necessary. Essential Services and their related supply chains are exempted from the suspension. Essential services include those involved in the provision of food and essential health items to the public. Food suppliers (including food manufacturing, food processing, and food caterers), food retail (including supermarkets, convenience stores, wet markets), and food &amp; beverages outlets (including restaurants, hawker centres, coffeeshops and food courts), and pharmacies will remain open. However, F&amp;B outlets can only offer take-away and deliveries only; no dining in is allowed. For the full list of essential services, click here. These businesses are required to submit details of their plans to operate with enhanced safe distancing measures in place at <a href="https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg">https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg</a> by end of 13 Apr</p>
<p>We have decided that instead of tightening incrementally over the next few weeks, we should make a decisive move now, to pre-empt escalating infections. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong</p>
<p>All other business, social, or other activities that cannot be conducted through working from home shall be suspended. Non-essential entities that are able to continue to operate their businesses (in limited or full capacity) with their employees working from home should continue to do so. MOM officers will begin enforcement operations from 7 April to ensure that only businesses who are exempted from the suspension are operating from their workplace premises. For entities providing essential services All activities that can take place through telecommuting must be done from home. For workplaces that need to be open, employers must implement safe distancing measures to reduce physical interactions by: • Reducing the need for and duration of physical interactions; • Staggering working hours; • Postponing all group events ; and • Implementing shift work and/or split team arrangements</p>
<p>For employers with affected workers: For employees who cannot work from home or at their workplace premises, employers should work out with them clear salary and leave arrangements.</p>
<p>One thing we can be sure of is that we will get through this together. We will stand with workers as well as businesses. Minister for Manpower, Josephine Teo
