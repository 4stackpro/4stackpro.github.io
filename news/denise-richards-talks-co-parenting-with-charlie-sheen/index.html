<p>Denise Richards has some daddy issues.</p>
<p>The 49-year-old actress — who shares two teenage daughters with ex-husband Charlie Sheen — revealed that she’s concerned Sheen’s infamous past could have an impact on their girls.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot that the kids don’t know about their dad, and I want to keep it that way,” Richards said during a confessional on Wednesday’s episode of “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.”</p>
<p>Richards said she works to keep kids Sam, 16, and Lola, 14, from learning certain information about their father for fear they might develop “issues.”</p>
<p>“Even though he’s Charlie Sheen, that is still, to them, their dad,” she continued, alluding to his very public history with drugs, partying and women. “I never talk badly about him and I want him to be part of their lives because I met a lot of the women that Charlie entertained and a lot of them had father-daughter issues. And I do not want that to be our girls.”</p>
<p>The fired “Two and a Half Men” star, 54, and Richards were married from 2002 to 2006. In addition to Sam and Lola, Richards adopted daughter Eloise Joni in 2011.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sheen also shares daughter Cassandra Estevez, 35, with ex Paula Profit and twins Bob and Max, 11, with ex-wife Brooke Mueller.</p>
<p>Also during Wednesday’s episode, Richards discussed with husband Aaron Phypers, 47, that after she attempted to take Sheen to court over allegedly owing $450,000 in late child support, the “Anger Management” star publicly called her a “coward.”</p>
<p>“Now I have a hearing set for November. But I do not want to go through all of that. I just don’t,” she explained. “It’s not just a one-time thing where you just show up to court. It’s like an ongoing thing where you can have depositions, declarations from different people. And that’s something, you know, the girls are going to be able to hear.”

<h3 id="jon-cryer-reflects-on-working-with-his-two-and-a-half-men-co-star-charlie-sheen">Jon Cryer reflects on working with his Two and a Half Men co-star Charlie Sheen</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/21/02/27441970-0-image-a-8_1587432269003.jpg" alt="img">
Jon Cryer has nothing but good things to say about his Two and a Half Men co-star Charlie Sheen despite working through his &lsquo;Internet s***storm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cryer, 55, was a guest on Entertainment Weekly&rsquo;s Couch Surfing show, where he opens up about past roles throughout his career.</p>
<p>Two and a Half Men ran for 12 seasons on CBS between 2003 and 2015, though the show made headlines in 2011 for Sheen&rsquo;s bizarre behavior that ultimately got him fired from the show, and replaced with Ashton Kutcher.</p>
<p>S<em><strong>storm: Jon Cryer has nothing but good things to say about his Two and a Half Men co-star Charlie Sheen despite working through his &lsquo;Internet s</strong></em>storm&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bizarre: Two and a Half Men ran for 12 seasons on CBS between 2003 and 2015, though the show made headlines in 2011 for Sheen&rsquo;s bizarre behavior that ultimately got him fired from the show, and replaced with Ashton Kutcher</p>
<p>&lsquo;Charlie and I just hit it off. We had a great first few years on that show,&rsquo; Cryer began, while adding that he was surprised by the show&rsquo;s success.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was incredibly smooth, we had a lovely time, it was working really well,&rsquo; Cryer said, adding that when they started the show Sheen was sober.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was very proud of his sobriety, but then after his marriage to Denise Richards collapsed, I think he started using again,&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>Surprised: &lsquo;Charlie and I just hit it off. We had a great first few years on that show,&rsquo; Cryer began, while adding that he was surprised by the show&rsquo;s success</p>
<p>&lsquo;At first he could handle it, and he was still incredibly professional — and still lovely, by the way, to everybody on set — but you could just see that stuff was wearing on him,&rsquo; Cryer added.</p>
<p>It got to the point where production was ultimately put on hiatus so Sheen could undergo a rehab program, his third rehab stint in a year.</p>
<p>After Sheen made a number of derogatory remarks aimed at the show&rsquo;s network, CBS, the show&rsquo;s creator, Chuck Lorre, and Cryer himself, who he called a &lsquo;turncoat&rsquo; and a traitor&rsquo; for not coming to his defense publicly, Sheen&rsquo;s contract was terminated and his character Charlie Harper was killed off.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t handle: &lsquo;At first he could handle it, and he was still incredibly professional — and still lovely, by the way, to everybody on set — but you could just see that stuff was wearing on him,&rsquo; Cryer added</p>
<p>When asked what it was like to be there in the middle of all that as it was happening, Cryer described it as, &lsquo;one of the first internet s***storms.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s all that, plus there’s the fact that all of our jobs are tied into this guy, and we’re all his friends. It was very, very strange and aspects of it that I absolutely hated, but you know, I’m thankful for the years that were great,” he added.</p>
<p>After Sheen&rsquo;s Harper was written off, he was replaced by Ashton Kutcher, whose character Walden Schmidt, an internet millionaire who bought the home and moved in with Cryer&rsquo;s Alan Harper and Jake T. Jones&rsquo; Jake Harper.</p>
<p>In the middle: When asked what it was like to be there in the middle of all that as it was happening, Cryer described it as, &lsquo;one of the first internet s***storms&rsquo;</p>
<p>The show ran for four more seasons after Sheen&rsquo;s departure, ending after a 12-season run in 2015.</p>
<p>After Two and a Half Men went off the air, Cryer had guest-starring stints on NCIS, Robot Chicken, Will &amp; Grace and he starred in the movie Big Time Adolescence.</p>
<p>He can currently be seen as the villainous Lex Luthor on The CW&rsquo;s Supergirl.</p>
<p>Departure: The show ran for four more seasons after Sheen&rsquo;s departure, ending after a 12-season run in 2015
