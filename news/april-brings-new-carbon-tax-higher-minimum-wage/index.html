New Brunswickers are now paying less to fill up their vehicle’s fuel tank thanks to the new provincial carbon tax.</p>
<p>A new carbon-emitting product tax of 6.63 cents per litre for gasoline and 8.05 cents per litre for diesel took effect Wednesday.</p>
<p>The province also lowered the provincial fuel tax by 4.63 cents for gasoline and 6.05 cents for diesel, leading to a net carbon price of two cents per litre.</p>
<p>The maximum price for regular self-serve is down 2.8 cents to 74.9 cents per litre, while diesel has dropped by 3.9 cents to 97.2 cents per litre.</p>
<p>Furnace oil fell by just over six cents while propane is down by 3.5 cents per litre.</p>
<p>The New Brunswick carbon tax replaces the federal fuel charge which had been in effect since April 2019.</p>
<p>Minimum Wage</p>
<p>New Brunswickers who are earning minimum wage are now making a bit more money.</p>
<p>The minimum wage in the province increases by 20-cents Wednesday to $11.70 per hour.</p>
<p>The increase is indexed to New Brunswick’s consumer price index, which grew by 1.7 per cent in 2019.

<h3 id="the-political-promise-of-carbon-taxes">The Political Promise of Carbon Taxes</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.wired.com/photos/5e7e9c5e056547000ac5e858/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Magazine-Carbon-Tax-508947532.jpg" alt="img">
For decades, the idea of a carbon tax has been stuck in the waiting room of American politics: Familiar to everyone who comes and goes, it has sat there long enough to grow cobwebs from its ears. For the vast majority of Republicans, the idea is anathema, and for Democrats it&rsquo;s one among several policies that compete for the love of lawmakers and climate wonks.</p>
<p>But politics, like the climate, is volatile these days. In the past couple of years, some Republicans have broken ranks with their party to support a tax on carbon emissions—perhaps because the climate is becoming more salient with voters, perhaps as a foil to the more radical Green New Deal, or perhaps to, you know, do something to stop global warming. Given that tiny bump in bipartisan momentum, it&rsquo;s worth revisiting the case for a carbon tax.</p>

<p>If you want to discourage bad behaviors, economists say, make them expensive. The strategy works for cigarettes, soda, gasoline. And it works for carbon emissions too. Adding a charge to the carbon content of fossil fuels is widely seen as one of the more powerful tools a country can use to shrink its emissions.</p>
<p>It works like this: A government charges a fee per ton of greenhouse gases emitted. The fee is small at first, rising gradually to give companies a chance to adapt. Individual households don&rsquo;t get taxed directly, but they could take a hit when the big emitters raise their rates in response.</p>
<p>“The beauty of a carbon tax is that everything we want consumers to do gets incentivized to be done,” says MIT economist Christopher Knittel. Residents pay more attention to their thermostats. Utilities might invest more in solar or wind farms. Manufacturers could start offering more energy-saving products, such as more efficient cars and heating and air-conditioning systems.</p>
<p>Several countries have implemented some form of carbon pricing—just not the most-offending nations. After Sweden instituted a tax in 1991, its transportation emissions fell an average of 6 percent a year, according to one study. (A separate tax on transport fuels shrank the country&rsquo;s carbon footprint further.) In British Columbia, a carbon tax reduced emissions by up to 15 percent. Last year, after the province&rsquo;s experiment proved successful, Canada expanded carbon pricing nationwide. Researchers at MIT calculated that if the US placed a $50-per-ton tax on carbon and increased the tax 5 percent per year, emissions would drop 63 percent by 2050. If every country adopted a carbon tax with a similar effect, the world might be able to slash its emissions in half by the middle of this century.</p>
<p>A US tax credit for carbon storage passed in 2018 could spur retrofits of power plants that would in turn capture 54 million tons of carbon per year by 2030. That&rsquo;s the equivalent of taking some 10 million cars off the streets.</p>
<p>The idea that has lately taken off among certain conservatives is one that cuts the sourness of a carbon tax with some sweeteners. US representative Francis Rooney, a Florida Republican, has cosponsored legislation that would impose a fee on metric tons of carbon emitted and then distribute the spoils back to US residents as a monthly “carbon dividend.” (You could think of it as a form of basic income, the concept that helped make Andrew Yang one of the biggest gang leaders in America over the past year.) In one proposal, crafted by the bipartisan Climate Leadership Council, a family of four might expect to get $2,000 back in the first year. Plans put forward by Rooney and the Climate Leadership Council also propose to eliminate or suspend federal regulations on carbon emissions—which perhaps helps explain why the CLC has the support of oil giants, car manufacturers, and utility companies.</p>
<p>Ultimately, a carbon tax needs to be global to reach its full potential. After all, heavy-emitting industries can flee to nations that have no carbon pricing. Placing a carbon tariff on goods imported from such places can incentivize dirtier countries to clean up their acts. The European Union is now considering such a measure. Revenue from that kind of tariff could again help fund a dividend, to shield people from rising costs.</p>
<p>All good ideas, but none too likely to pass during the current US administration, which has pushed tax cuts and denied the severity of climate change. Campaigns to implement one in Washington state have failed twice. There are other options. Mark Jaccard, an economist who helped design British Columbia&rsquo;s carbon tax, argues that a country can tighten regulations instead, choosing to phase out coal plants, for example, or implement a low-carbon fuel standard. Regulations “may be way better politically, like way better, and only slightly less efficient economically,” Jaccard says. The key to saving the world? It&rsquo;s all politics.</p>

<h3 id="april-1-in-canada-federal-carbon-tax-jumps-50-and-mps-salaries-grow-21">April 1 in Canada: Federal carbon tax jumps 50% and MPs&rsquo; salaries grow 2.1%</h3>
<p><img src="https://nationalpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/gas_pump.jpg" alt="img">
OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer are among the MPs who are promising to donate an automatic increase in their salaries to charity, as the COVID-19 pandemic ravages the economy and puts thousands of Canadians out of work.</p>
<p>The raise goes into effect today, as does the latest increase in the federal carbon tax.</p>
<p>Trudeau has been under pressure to cancel both.</p>
<p>However, he has ruled out scrapping the planned increase in the carbon tax and there’s nothing he can do about the salary hike without recalling Parliament, which has been adjourned until at least April 20 as part of the nation-wide bid to curb the spread of the deadly virus.</p>
<p>Under legislation passed in 2005 to de-politicize parliamentarians’ pay, salaries paid to MPs and senators increase automatically on April 1 each year, based on the average increase negotiated by major bargaining units in the private sector.</p>
<p>This year, MPs are entitled to a 2.1 per cent hike, which will increase their base salaries by just over $3,750 to $182,656.</p>
<p>By law, senators are paid $25,000 less than MPs. Hence, they’ll each pull in a base salary of $157,656 this year, a 2.4 per cent hike.</p>
<p>The prime minister, leader of the Opposition, the Speakers in both chambers and others with additional duties receive extra, legislated amounts beyond their base salaries.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the 2008 economic meltdown, the previous Conservative government froze parliamentarians’ salaries for three years.</p>
<p>Asked Monday about a similar salary freeze now, Trudeau said: “I haven’t heard the Parliament of Canada having those discussions, but I’m sure they will reflect on it now that you’ve asked the question.”</p>
<p>A freeze would require legislation approved by Parliament, which has been adjourned since mid-March except for a brief day-long sitting last week to pass a bill freeing up billions in emergency aid to help Canadians weather the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>It will likely stay adjourned long beyond the originally scheduled return date of April 20, although another emergency sitting could eventually be required, at which point MPs could also consider a pay freeze.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the salary hike is in effect. So, MPs from all parties are vowing to turn over their pay boost to charities and non-profit organizations working to cushion the impact of the national health emergency.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the prime minister said Trudeau will give his pay boost to non-profit organizations in his Montreal riding.</p>
<p>Similarly, a spokeswoman for Scheer said the Regina-based Opposition leader intends to give his pay increase to “a local charity who is working hard to support Canadians affected by COVID-19.”</p>
<p>Denise Siele added that it’s up to the government to introduce legislation to freeze parliamentary salaries “should they so choose.”</p>
<p>NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh “makes donations to organizations and local causes throughout the year and, with the salary raise for MPs, he will increase his donations,” said his spokeswoman, Melanie Richer, adding that the same applies to New Democrat MPs.</p>
<p>Various Conservative MPs have issued statements over the past week promising to donate their imminent pay boosts to charities.</p>
<p>Given the current crisis, Alberta MP Blaine Calkins called the pay hike “not only untimely but, frankly, it’s in poor taste.”</p>
<p>Conservatives have also been demanding that Trudeau cancel the planned increase in the federal carbon tax which kicks in today, raising the carbon price on fuel purchases to $30 per tonne from $20. That will mean drivers will pay roughly an extra two cents a litre at the gas pump.</p>
<p>The tax applies in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Nunavut and Yukon, none of which have imposed their own price on carbon that meets the federal standard.</p>
<p>In a statement Tuesday, Edmonton Conservative MP Tim Uppal called on the Trudeau Liberals to scrap all planned tax increases during the pandemic, including the carbon tax.</p>
<p>“Too many Canadians are already worried about how they will pay their rent this month or put food on their tables. The last thing they need is a 50 per cent increase to the Liberal carbon tax, which will only increase the cost of gas, groceries and home heating,” Uppal said.</p>
<p>However, Trudeau noted that the federal government is also paying rebates that are intended to give Canadians more money than they pay in the carbon tax.</p>
<p>“The price on pollution has been designed as to put more money in household pockets, more money in the pockets of the middle class while we do the things that are necessary to fight pollution and protect our planet,” he said Monday.</p>
<p>Trudeau added that the need to combat climate change “remains even at a time of immediate crisis and pandemic.”</p>
<p>Michael Berstein, executive director of Clean Prosperity, suggested in a statement that the federal government should refine the rebate program during the crisis.</p>
<p>Among other things, he said families should receive</p>
<p>the initially forecasted rebate amounts even if revenues from the tax decline. As well, he suggested that the rebates be sent as immediate direct payments to households, rather than as tax credits.</p>
