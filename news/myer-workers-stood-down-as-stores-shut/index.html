Staff at Myer stores in Geelong and Werribee will be stood down as the retail giant shuts all of it&rsquo;s stores for a month amid the Coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The retail giant will close all stores around the country from the close of business on Sunday for an initial four week period however all online business will continue to operate.</p>
<p>In a statement posted to the Australian Stock Exchange, Myer said it will stand down about 10,000 staff as a result.</p>
<p>Myer is found at Westfield in Geelong and at Pacific Werribee Shopping Centre.</p>
<p>Staff will not be paid, however full and part time staff will have greater flexibility to access annual leave and long service entitlements.</p>
<p>The statement said a small group of &ldquo;business-critical roles&rdquo; will be maintained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The health and wellbeing of customers, team members, their families and the broader communities in which we operate remains Myer&rsquo;s absolute priority,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are, therefore, fully supportive of the various measures undertaken by both governments, and their respective agencies, to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through social isolation and distancing measures, including staying at home, wherever possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The decision is another blow for workers across Geelong and Werribee who may be out of work until the virus can be controlled.</p>
<p>It comes following news Kathmandu and Ripcurl will also close.</p>

<h3 id="popular-department-store-myer-will-close-all-of-its-stores-due-to-the-coronavirus-pandemic">Popular department store Myer will close ALL of its stores due to the coronavirus pandemic</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/27/10/26480224-0-image-a-55_1585305426887.jpg" alt="img">
Myer will close all of its department stores in Australia and stand down 10,000 staff members for at least a month as it battles through the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Bosses said the department giant - which has been an Australian institution for 120 years - would close its doors on Sunday, but would still run online.</p>
<p>It is the latest victim of the coronavirus retail fallout, which is leaving tens of thousands of Australians unemployed as stores shut their doors.</p>
<p>Around 10,000 members of staff will be sent home without pay, Myer bosses confirmed.</p>
<p>In a statement, they said the decision was made to protect the health of staff, customers and the &lsquo;broader community&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The closure will be for an initial period of four weeks, leading up to April 27, but may go on longer.</p>
<p>All Myer stores across Australia will be closed for at least a month due to the coronavirus pandemic</p>
<p>Dozens of people are seen queuing - very close together - outside a Centrelink in Melbourne on March 24, with many people having lost their jobs</p>
<p>WHAT&rsquo;S GONE WRONG AT MYER? Even before the coronavirus outbreak, the iconic Australian department store had been struggling with plunging profits for almost a decade. In the midst of the so-called department store wars Myer and its main rival David Jones sought to differentiate themselves in the battle for customer&rsquo;s hard-earned dollars. In 2015, David Jones decided to concentrate on the higher end market, focusing on leading international and Australian designer brands, while Myer sought to capture the more mid-range market. This, new Myer CEO John King said, is where the store began to lose its direction. Myers shelves began to be stocked with brand after brand of similar mid-range labels while the customer experience of visiting the store was neglected.</p>
<p>The embattled department store has suffered plunging profits for almost a decade, long before coronavirus hit.</p>
<p>Its latest financial results posted on March 5 reflect this, showing total sales down 3.8 per cent to $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As team members will not be working they will not be paid during this period of imposed closure,&rsquo; the statement read.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Full time and part time members have greater flexibility to access their annual leave and long service entitlements in addition to government assistance measures.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It said it was &lsquo;fully supportive&rsquo; of the government&rsquo;s social distancing measures, including people staying at home as much as possible.</p>
<p>Global health experts said that people staying home and keeping isolated is the best way to curb the spread of the virus, which has infected more than 3,000 Australians.</p>
<p>It comes soon after Australia&rsquo;s biggest hairdressing chain, Just Cuts, announced it would also close its doors.</p>
<p>Australia&rsquo;s borders were last week closed to foreigners, with only returning locals able to come into the country by plane (pictured are returned travellers arriving at Sydney Airport on Friday)</p>
<p>There have been 14 deaths from coronavirus in Australia, with 3,573 cases recorded nationwide</p>
<p>Signalling huge changes to Australian life, Bunnings will operate limited hours, and all restaurants - including the likes of McDonald&rsquo;s - are only operating as a takeaway.</p>
<p>But the measures will hit the economy hard, leaving many desperate for work as staff are laid off on mass.</p>
<p>Westpac, Australia&rsquo;s second biggest bank, fears the national jobless rate will more than double by June, from 5.1 per cent to 11.1 per cent.</p>
<p>This would see 814,000 people lose their jobs, as unemployment soared to the highest level since December 1992.</p>
<p>Westpac is also forecasting an economic contraction in the March, June and September quarters, which would mark the first technical recession in 29 years.</p>
<p>This downturn would be even more severe than the global financial crisis of a decade ago.</p>
<p>General Pants is closing all stores until at least April 22 due to the coronavirus fallout</p>
<p>Smiggle is also owned by Solomon Lew&rsquo;s Premier Investments which announced the shut down</p>
<p>General Pants, Smiggle, and Peter Alexander have also temporarily closed due to the coronavirus fallout.</p>
<p>CORONAVIRUS CASES IN AUSTRALIA: 3,637 New South Wales: 1,617 Victoria: 685 Queensland: 625 South Australia: 287 Western Australia: 278 Australian Capital Territory: 71 Tasmania: 59 Northern Territory: 14 TOTAL CASES: 3,637 DEAD: 14</p>
<p>The brands are owned by tycoon Solomon Lew&rsquo;s Premier Investments, which announced a shutdown of Australian stores from Thursday.</p>
<p>Around 9,000 of the company&rsquo;s staff around the world will be stood down without pay until at least April 22.</p>
<p>The group&rsquo;s bosses will be working from home without pay.</p>
<p>Announcing its own closure on Friday night, bosses at Just Cuts said they could &lsquo;no longer wait for the National Cabinet to do the right thing&rsquo; and close salons, with both staff and clients at increasing risk from coronavirus.</p>
<p>The Australian government has come under increasing pressure to force a further shutdown of the country to help stop the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>Just Cuts CEO Denis McFadden said the current COVID-19 restrictions were &lsquo;impossible to maintain&rsquo; and that there was a &lsquo;physical risk and mental toll on hairdressers and clients&rsquo;.</p>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s stores across Australia (pictured in Melbourne on March 23) have banned customers from dining in and are doing takeaway food only</p>
<p>Kathmandu stores across Australia (pictured) are also closing thanks to the coronavirus pandemic</p>
<p>In a damning statement, he accused the government of leaving the public at risk of infection and said they were &lsquo;putting people&rsquo;s lives on the line&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He said he had pleaded with the Australian government to add hairdressing to its list of non-essential services, but the calls &lsquo;fell on deaf ears&rsquo;.</p>
<p>None of its 190 salons, or 2,500 employees, will carry on working.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We had hoped that common sense would finally kick in and the State, Federal and Territory Governments would act on the medical advice that safe distancing is critical,&rsquo; Mr McFadden said on Friday night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;National Cabinet has today failed to act on our pleas to add hairdressing to the list of non-essential services.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is despite calls from medical experts including the Australian Medical Association for more and stronger self-distancing measures.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Accent Group, which owns Athlete&rsquo;s Foot, Platypus (pictured) and Hype, has announced it is closing 522 stores and standing down around 5,000 staff</p>
<p>Around 8,000 workers for Woolworths pubs and pokies joint venture have been stood down on March 24.</p>
<p>ALH group, jointly owned by Woolworths and the Mathieson family, operates more than 300 licensed venues across Australia but was forced to shut these down after the government ordered all &lsquo;non-essential&rsquo; businesses close due to coronavirus.</p>
<p>Thousands have since been left without a job but the supermarket giant said that within a day nearly 3,000 would be redeployed.</p>
<p>RAG Group, which owns Tarocash, YD and Connor, closed 500 stores and stood down 3,000 workers on Friday.</p>
<p>The same happened at Accent Group - which owns Athlete&rsquo;s Foot, Platypus and Hype - which announced the closure of 522 stores and the standing down of around 5,000 staff.</p>
<p>It also closed stores from Friday for at least four weeks.</p>
<p>Myer (pictured) is standing down 10,000 members of staff as it shuts 190 department stores because of the coronavirus pandemic</p>
<p>Bunnings (pictured) has changed its opening hours and put in buying restrictions on some essential products</p>
<p>It comes as Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a host of new restrictions on Friday, with all arrivals in Australia from overseas now being put into quarantine.</p>
<p>From 11.50pm on Saturday, all travellers arriving in the country will be escorted off flights by defence force personnel and whisked away to new quarantine hotels.</p>
<p>Several are being set up across state capitals.</p>
<p>Mr Morrison announced the measures on Friday, more than a week after the Ruby Princess debacle that saw 3,000 cruise ship passengers disembark in Sydney without a single health check.</p>
<p>Since then, 162 of the ship&rsquo;s passengers have been confirmed to have COVID-19.</p>
<p>The new arrivals will now spend two weeks mandatory self-isolation under the close watch of border force officials, before getting the all clear to return home.</p>
<p>The first arrivals - 288 passengers from the Norwegian Jewel cruise ship - continue to reside inside the Swissotel in Sydney&rsquo;s CBD, after being quietly ferried in the hotel&rsquo;s back door at 4am on Thursday.</p>
<p>This traveller was taking no risks as they arrived at Sydney Airport early on Friday morning, wearing a protective suit, mask and goggles (pictured)

<h3 id="calls-for-govt-aid-as-myer-shuts-doors">Calls for govt aid as Myer shuts doors</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.9news.com.au/assets/img/9news-image-background.96245abf.jpg" alt="img">
Myer&rsquo;s temporary closure shows how urgently the federal government needs to step in and deliver a rescue package for businesses struggling to cope with the coronavirus pandemic, a retail union says.</p>
<p>Myer announced on Friday it would temporarily close all stores for at least four weeks from Sunday, and stand down 10,000 staff without pay.</p>
<p>The SDA, the union for retail, fast food and warehouse workers, said the government had failed to step up.</p>
<p>Some 30,000 retail workers had already been stood down in the past week, the union said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Myer&rsquo;s decision makes the situation even more serious and urgent - this is a brand that has not only been a major employer, but a symbol of Australian retail success, for more than a century,&rdquo; SDA national secretary Gerard Dwyer said in a statement on Friday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many more major and minor brands - retailers big and small - (will) take unilateral action because the government has left them no choice and the prime minister fails to extend to them what the community expects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Friday that details of the plan to effectively cocoon businesses will be announced in the next few days as part of a third stimulus package, which will also include commercial and residential rental assistance.</p>
<p>Mr Morrison said there were some businesses that would have to close their doors and the government wanted them to effectively go into hibernation for six months.</p>
<p>While its stores are shut, Myer will continue to operate all online business, and full and part time staff are being given greater flexibility to access annual leave and long service entitlements.</p>
<p>Myer chief executive John King said the outcome is &ldquo;one of the toughest decisions this company has faced in its 120 years of operation&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The SDA, along with the Australian Retailers Association, reiterated a call for a multibillion dollar rescue package for the industry.</p>
<p>They are calling for wage subsidies, rent and debt relief and underwriting of credit.</p>
<p>However the government has repeatedly baulked at the idea of wage subsidies for workers.
