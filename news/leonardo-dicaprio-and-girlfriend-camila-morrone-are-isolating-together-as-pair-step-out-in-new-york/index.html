<p>Leonardo DiCaprio is isolating with his 22-year-old girlfriend Camila Morrone .</p>
<p>The two were spotted on a stroll around New York&rsquo;s East Village on Wednesday, where the actor, 45, covered up in a black hoodie and baseball cap while his girlfriend wore a leather trench coat and beanie.</p>
<p>DiCaprio is notoriously private about his relationships and he and Morrone keep a largely low profile - declining to pose on the red carpet together or discuss their relationship in detail - though the actress did defend their 23-year age gap last year in an interview with The Los Angeles Times.</p>
<p>“There’s so many relationships in Hollywood - and in the history of the world - where people have large age gaps. I just think anyone should be able to date who they want to date” she said.</p>
<p>The actress has more new additions to her household during the coronavirus isolation period: two husky puppies called Jack and Jill, who she is fostering.</p>
<p>“Fostering a puppy during this quarantine time has been the single best decision,” she wrote on Instagram. “For all my friends showing interest in doing this, DO IT. You won’t regret it,” she continued, adding, “These sweet creatures need you so badly.”</p>
<p>She also revealed she had been using her isolation time to learn the guitar.</p>
<p>Morrone - who is the stepdaughter of Al Pacino - is set to star in an adaptation of the bestselling book, Daisy Jones &amp; The Six.

<h3 id="why-leonardo-dicaprio-has-no-movies-coming-out-in-2020">Why Leonardo DiCaprio has no movies coming out in 2020</h3>
<p><img src="https://img3.looper.com/img/gallery/why-leonardo-dicaprio-has-no-movies-coming-out-in-2020/intro-1583954748.jpg" alt="img">
If you&rsquo;re a major DiCaprio fan, you shouldn&rsquo;t stress about him taking some time off; the actor has some seriously exciting projects in the pipeline.</p>
<p>As of this writing, DiCaprio is filming Killers of the Flower Moon, a film directed by frequent collaborator Martin Scorsese about the true story of members of the Osage tribe and their mysterious murders. Currently scheduled for a 2021 release, the film co-stars Robert DeNiro, and is sure to be another mega hit from DiCaprio and Scorsese both.</p>
<p>After Killers of the Flower Moon, DiCaprio&rsquo;s next project (which is currently in pre-production) is The Black Hand, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Stephan Talty that tells the story of a police officer seeking retribution against some of New York City&rsquo;s most violent gangs. (Given his starring role in The Departed, this subject matter certainly isn&rsquo;t out of DiCaprio&rsquo;s wheelhouse.) Following The Black Hand, DiCaprio will return to a project that&rsquo;s been stalled for quite some time: The Devil in the White City, an adaptation of Erik Larsen&rsquo;s nonfiction book which follows the notorious serial killer H.H. Holmes and his crime spree during the 1893 World&rsquo;s Fair in Chicago. After trying to make The Devil in the White City into a film, DiCaprio and Scorsese have teamed up with Hulu to bring it to the small screen.</p>
<p>Finally, DiCaprio will team up with Scorsese once again for Roosevelt, a biopic centered on Theodore Roosevelt. DiCaprio will star as the formidable 26th President of the United States. Not much is known about this project just yet, but there&rsquo;s no doubt that Scorsese and DiCaprio will produce something pretty spectacular.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is streaming now, in case you haven&rsquo;t caught DiCaprio&rsquo;s thrillingly fun performance as Rick Dalton.

Actor Leonardo DiCaprio and girlfriend Camila Morrone are reportedly self-quarantining together amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to Us Weekly.</p>
<p>A source told the outlet that the couple is keeping a low profile at DiCaprio&rsquo;s Los Angeles home but supposedly &ldquo;enjoying time together off the grid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DiCaprio and Morrone are a notoriously private couple but did make a rare joint appearance at the Academy Awards earlier this year.</p>
<p>Leonardo DiCaprio and his girlfriend, Camila Morrone, are staying close during the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>According to Us Weekly, the couple is self-quarantining at the Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood actor&rsquo;s Los Angeles home. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re always together, but like maintaining privacy,&rdquo; a source told the outlet. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re really great for one another and have been enjoying this time together off the grid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>DiCaprio, 45, and Morrone, 22, keep a notoriously low profile when it comes to their relationship, but the two did make a rare public appearance earlier this year at the 92nd annual Academy Awards. Their relationship—and 23-year age gap—has come under criticism (and jokes) in recent years, but Morrone has only spoken highly of DiCaprio as a partner and shrugs off any kind of judgment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s so many relationships in Hollywood⁠—and in the history of the world⁠—where people have large age gaps,&rdquo; Morrone previously told the Los Angeles Times. &ldquo;I just think anyone should be able to date who they want to date.&rdquo;
