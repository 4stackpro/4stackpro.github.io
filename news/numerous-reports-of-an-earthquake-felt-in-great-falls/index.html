GREAT FALLS — We have been receiving numerous reports from people in and around Great Falls who say that they felt an earthquake.</p>
<p>The quake registered as a magnitude 6.5, and was centered about 44 miles west of Challis, Idaho, at a depth of about 6.1 miles.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Geological Survey, three aftershocks were felt after the initial earthquake. The first was a 3.6 magnitude, the second a 4.6 magnitude, and the third a 3.4 magnitude, according to TV station KIVI in Boise. There have not been any reports of serious injuries or damage at this point.</p>
<p>Reports started coming in to MTN News at about 5:55 p.m. on Tuesday:</p>
<p>Sarah Reynolds Johnson: &ldquo;Just had an earthquake - felt it pretty hard here in Missoula, friends in Butte, Great Falls, and Bigfork felt it too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tina Gac Grismer: &ldquo;Did Great Falls feel the a earthquake? Definitely did in Ulm&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brennen Hankins: &ldquo;Felt that one on Central and 18th. Woke me up from a nap, and even my brother felt it. No damage, though!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lindsey Kadner: &ldquo;I was standing in my kitchen heard dishes rattling thought I was losing my mind&hellip;. went down to check on my daughter in the basement and she goes mom I heard this noise and felt this thing&hellip; oh that was an earthquake buddy and that explains why the dishes were shaking!

<p>Leah Rockett: &ldquo;I definitely felt it in Black Eagle and my dogs went nuts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve Glenn: &ldquo;Felt it in Sweetgrass, I thought it was just the train.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="yep-idaho-gets-earthquakes-heres-what-to-do-when-it-hits">Yep, Idaho gets earthquakes. Here’s what to do when it hits</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.idahostatesman.com/latest-news/rw5eka/picture241672141/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/earthquake-drill-desk.jpg" alt="img">
Did you rush outside or shelter in a doorway during the magnitude-6.5 earthquake that hit Idaho on Tuesday? Next time, experts say, you should probably stay put.</p>
<p>What might have been the second-strongest earthquake in Idaho history sent people from Coeur d’Alene to Boise to Pocatello rushing for cover. Although the epicenter was in the mountains northwest of Stanley, Treasure Valley residents experienced 20-30 seconds of shaking that started at about 5:53 p.m. Over the next two hours, the United States Geological Survey reported more than five aftershocks, with magnitudes ranging from 4.6 to 3.3.</p>
<p>Many Idahoans took to social media after the shaking stopped, sharing how they sheltered in doorways or rushed family members out of their homes. But a FEMA spokeswoman told the Idaho Statesman that making a run for it is one of the last things you should do in an earthquake — and it can be extremely dangerous during higher-magnitude earthquakes.</p>
<p>Doorways aren’t that safe, either.</p>
<p>Local news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal</p>
<p>“Science by and large has kind of turned away from that concept,” said Savannah Brehmer, spokeswoman for FEMA’s region 10, which includes Idaho, Washington, Oregon and Alaska. “Dropping, covering and holding on seems to be the best method for staying safe and minimizing potential injuries.”</p>
<p>Duck and cover, don’t run</p>
<p>One of the biggest hazards of trying to flee a building during an earthquake, Brehmer said, is being hit by debris or crumbling pieces of unstable infrastructure. Runners also could fall during prolonged shaking or aftershocks, putting them at greater risk.</p>
<p>Instead, Brehmer said, it’s best to drop to the floor immediately and look for something to shelter underneath — a sturdy table or desk — and try to protect the back of your head, neck and vital organs.</p>
<p>If there’s nothing to duck underneath, experts at ShakeOut recommend going to the ground against an interior wall, away from windows. You shouldn’t run even if you’re outside, but instead drop, cover your head and do your best to brace yourself.</p>
<p>Only after the shaking has stopped should you try to exit a building or move around outside, Brehmer said. She said developing the habit of dropping and covering immediately is an important reflex to develop.</p>
<p>“That’s what’s going to keep your most precious organs safe from potential injury,” Brehmer said.</p>
<p>How to prepare for the next earthquake in Idaho</p>
<p>History shows this isn’t Idaho’s first big earthquake — and it certainly won’t be the last.</p>
<p>“Earthquakes are a potential hazard for the Idaho area, although they’re maybe not on the forefront of people’s minds as it would be in California,” Brehmer said.</p>
<p>Many of Idaho’s past earthquakes originated in the mountains, as this one did, but research from Boise State University’s Hazard and Climate Resilience Institute shows faults near the Treasure Valley could cause earthquakes, too. The Squaw Creek, Jake’s Creek and Big Flat faults located about 25 miles north of the Treasure Valley could produce magnitude-6.5-to-7.5 quakes, according to USGS scenarios.</p>
<p>Despite recent technological advances, earthquakes still remain largely unpredictable. The best way to be ready for the next one — or just more aftershocks — is to mitigate potential hazards where you live and work.</p>
<p>Brehmer recommended removing loose objects from precarious areas that could fall on someone, especially above sleeping areas. Securing loose items and anchoring heavy bookshelves to a wall can go a long way, she said.</p>
<p>“We don’t know when they are going to happen,” Brehmer said.</p>
