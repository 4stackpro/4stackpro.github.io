<p>Self-isolation has posed a problem to divorced couples with children, but some celebrities have shown modern problems require modern solutions.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of stars such as Wayne Brady and (reportedly) Travis Scott, former A-list couple Demi Moore and Bruce Willis have revealed they’re not only self-isolating together - they’re coordinating outfits and helping their kids pass the time in quarantine too.</p>
<p>Their daughter, Tallulah Willis, posted a “chaotic neutral” family portrait of Bruce, Demi, Tallulah’s boyfriend Dillon Buss, Scout LaRue and their dog all wearing matching green and white pyjamas by Leveret.</p>
<p>Looking a million miles away from his Die Hard character, Willis beamed for the camera as he put his arm around Moore - who he was married to for twelve years and split from in 2000.</p>
<p>She flashed a big thumbs up to the camera, wearing sunglasses and smiling too.</p>
<p>In an additional photo posted by Buss, it turns out even more people got in on the pyjama theme.</p>
<p>Scout’s boyfriend, Jake Miller, could also be seen holding onto a large fork and spoon in an Instagram story. Three additional dogs were also seen in matching outfits, plus an unidentified man.</p>
<p>It also appeared that the family&rsquo;s pyjamas weren&rsquo;t just for a &ldquo;chaotic&rdquo; photoshoot, as Buss shared a video of Scout LaRue Willis running around in a wooded outdoor area with one of the family&rsquo;s dogs.</p>
<p>Tallulah also revealed that her father also helped her shave her head. Given that Willis has been bald for many years, he was seen expertly shaving her locks - with Tallulah posting a hilarious close up screenshot of a forgotten tuft of lilac hair.</p>
<p>Her sister, Rumer, also helped with the endeavour. In a video shared to Rumer&rsquo;s Instagram stories, Willis was seen supervising as Rumer also helped shave Tallulah&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Rumer then helped take photos of her sister, who posed topless and debuted her new hairstyle on Instagram.</p>
<p>Though Demi and Bruce’s eldest daughter, Rumer, was not pictured with them, she has been featured in other photos Demi has posted of their “quarantine crew”, sharing that they’ve been working on musical covers and photo projects.</p>
<p>While Bruce and Demi didn’t post the pyjama shots to their own social media, it’s no secret that the pair remain good friends and co-parents.</p>
<p>Demi was included in Comedy Central’s Roast of Bruce Willis where she made a few hilariously pointed comments about her ex-husband saying, “Even though I went over everything yesterday, I knew he’d forget.”</p>
<p>Calling him a “great father”, she continued, “We had some great times together. We shared a life - I had three beautiful amazing children. Four if you count Bruce. And then there was [sic] the dogs and [her ex] Ashton [Kutcher], so it was like six.”</p>
<p>Following their split in 2000, Demi went on to date and marry Ashton Kutcher.</p>
<p>The pair were married in 2005 after two years of dating and later separated in 2011, before finalising their divorce in 2013.</p>
<p>Bruce is married to model Emma Heming, who he married in 2009 and has two children with.
