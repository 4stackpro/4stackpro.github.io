<p>TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — As news broke that a vicious melee had broken out between Indian and Chinese troops along the Sino-Indian border in the Ladakh area on Tuesday (June 16), an illustration showing a Hindu god battling a Chinese dragon surfaced on social media.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, a fierce brawl broke out between Indian and Chinese troops on a disputed stretch of border in the Ladakh region, with the Indian side suffering 20 dead and the PLA allegedly reporting 43 dead and wounded. As nationalism on both sides of the border reached a fever pitch that day, an illustration showing Rama, the seventh avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu, drawing a bow and preparing to shoot a huge arrow into a Chinese dragon beside the words &ldquo;We Conquer. We kill.&rdquo; was posted on the Hong Kong social media site LIHKG.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Twitter user HoSaiLei soon shared it and wrote &ldquo;An Indian friend has already finished this exquisite Sino-Indian war poster.&rdquo; Within 21 hours, the post had gained 861 likes, 300 retweets, and 34 comments.</p>
<p>Many Indian netizens thanked HoSaiLei for sharing the image, and he responded to one user by saying, &ldquo;Likewise!! Please know this, we support you!&rdquo; Below the image, some Hongkongers jokingly posted screenshots of the character Dhalsim from the video game &ldquo;Street Fighter&rdquo; defeating the Chinese character Chun-Li.</p>

<h3 id="kerala-govt-makes-coronavirus-negative-certificate-mandatory-for-flights">&ldquo;Kerala govt makes coronavirus-negative certificate mandatory for flights&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal%2F2020-05%2F8b218e20-7ea9-42ee-84fd-0cd4c70ef123%2FWhatsApp_Image_2020_05_10_at_11_26_41.jpeg?w=1200&amp;auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;ogImage=true" alt="img">
Thiruvananthapuram: The Pinarayi Vijayan government has alienated lakhs of non-resident Keralites (NRK) and their families back home by ordering all returnees to necessarily produce a COVID-19 negative certificate to board flights to Kerala.</p>
<p>No other state in India has asked for such a condition, which has reinforced the fears of overseas Malayalees that they are not welcome to return. The embassy websites, carrying an announcement to this effect, clarifies that the step has been taken on the request of the Kerala government.</p>
<p>Earlier, the requirement of negative certificate was applicable only for chartered flights carrying the stranded workers, desperate to get back as they have been without job or the means to support themselves for months together.</p>
<p>This has led to widespread protests from the overseas Keralites that they are being discriminated against, as there is no such requirement for the Vande Bharat flights.</p>
<p>However, instead of removing the anomaly in favour of the affected people, the Kerala government has opted to make the requirement across the board, bringing the regular Vande Bharat flights under the requirement. Now, nobody can come in without a certificate.</p>
<p>The expatriate Malayalee community has been shocked at the indifference of the state government, which apparently is worried that a bigger influx would spoil its record of handling the pandemic with relatively greater success.</p>
<p>They point out that most of the stranded people cannot afford a test because they don’t have any money, apart from the fact that for a large number of people getting a test done would mean travelling thousands of kilometres by road as their stations do not have the facilities.</p>
<p>Even if there are hospitals capable of doing the tests, most people do not have access to these as the government hospitals only test people with clear COVID-19 symptoms. Also, the priority of government hospitals is to treat their own citizens, as a result of which the expatriates often do not get a chance. Many countries do not even hold PCR tests. Private hospitals are far beyond the reach of most people.</p>
<p>The Kerala government’s stand is that if people are allowed to board the flight without the negative certificate, there is a risk of asymptomatic passengers taking the flight, which would expose the all passengers and the crew of the flight to the disease. The government has, therefore, asked the Centre to organise special flights to bring COVID-19 patients alone.</p>
<p>Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has written to the Prime Minister, requesting his help in organising tests in foreign countries through the embassies and diplomatic missions. He has not received a reply yet, but his government has gone ahead with the advisory not to let anyone without a COVID-19-negative certificate board any flight.</p>
<p>The opposition parties have latched on to the opportunity to launch a no-holds barred agitation against the Pinarayi government for its approach towards non-resident Keralites. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala has announced a day’s hunger strike on June 19 in front of the state secretariat to protest against the government decision.

<h3 id="no-room-for-dissent-sanjay-jha-dropped-as-aicc-spokesperson-with-immediate-effect">&ldquo;No room for dissent? Sanjay Jha dropped as AICC Spokesperson with ‘immediate effect’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal%2F2020-06%2F5db7fd27-c72a-4e6c-94af-d097abde632e%2Fsanjay_jha_3.jpg?w=1200&amp;auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;ogImage=true" alt="img">
Jha recently penned an open letter questioning the Congress’ ‘political obsolescence’ if it continues to conduct itself in the same manner &ndash; something that he called &ldquo;baffling&rdquo; in an open letter to The Times of India. The party has, in recent years suffered two Lok Sabha poll defeats and has lost (or faced a reversal of government) in various states.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to call a spade a spade here and a shovel: there has been no serious effort to get the party up and running with any sense of urgency,&rdquo; he writes. As Jha put it in a recent tweet, the need of the hour was &ldquo;an organisational renewal&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course there is scattered good work being done, but that will not make us robust, dynamic and successful,&rdquo; he had written.</p>
<p>Note that Jha&rsquo;s comments do not seem to be along the lines of a prospective deserter. As he told HW News, he had spoken out “because I care for the Congress party, it’s because I am ideologically a Congressman&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A Mumbai Mirror article written by journalist Rasheed Kidwai opines that Jha is not alone, adding that party insiders suspect that he has the support of individuals such as Shashi Tharoor, Manish Tiwari, Sachin Pilot, Milind Deora and Sandeep Dixit. Others who might be supportive of Jha&rsquo;s efforts include Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Deepinder Hooda.</p>
<p>Kidwai incidentally has written a book called &ldquo;Sonia, A Biography&rdquo; as well as a book based on the Party headquarters called &ldquo;24, Akbar Road&rdquo;.

Shahjahanpur (UP): The body of a 60-year-old man remained unattended for almost three hours on a roadside here, as people suspected that he had died due to COVID-19, an official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The deceased, identified as Liaqat, was a hairdresser in Mumbai and had recently returned to Tilhar in Shahjahanpur, he said.</p>
<p>Liaqat was going to meet his niece on Tuesday, but started experiencing difficulty in breathing and died on the way, the official said.</p>
<p>The people feared they might get infected with the coronavirus on going near Liaqat and his body remained unattended for almost three hours, the official said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Tuesday evening, we got information that the body of a person is lying unattended. A ticket from Mumbai was found from his possession. This created doubts that the person is a COVID-19 suspect. After this, senior officials were informed,&rdquo; said Qamruzama, the in-charge of Tilhar primary health centre.</p>
<p>He said the body was buried on Tuesday night, as per the COVID-19 guidelines, and the graveyard was sanitised.

<h3 id="nasrallah-threatens-us-protesters-amid-economic-turmoil---explainer">&ldquo;Nasrallah threatens US, protesters amid economic turmoil - Explainer&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/t_JD_ArticleMainImageFaceDetect/399056" alt="img">
The long speech was reprinted at Iran’s Fars News and was tweeted online in translation by expert David Daoud. The speech was wide ranging and touched on several key topics. He began by memorializing a Palestinian Islamic Jihad leader named Ramadan Shallah who died on June 7. Islamic Jihad is supported by Iran and Hezbollah. It has been the source of attacks on Israel over the past years and Israel has targeted its members. Nasrallah said Palestinians are under threat of Israeli annexation and must unify. He spoke about unifying the Islamic “ummah” in the face of Israel and that Shi’ites and Sunnis should work together. Iran and Turkish leaders have also said this in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Hezbollah wants to try to unite Shi’ites and Sunnis under its banner to fight the US and others. This was clear from the speech. Nasrallah fears sectarianism or a return to civil strife. Hezbollah, it must be remembered, emerged during the civil war in Lebanon and emerged stronger after it. Hezbollah took credit for Israel’s withdrawal in 2005 and then murdered the Prime Minister of Lebanon Rafic Hariri in 2005. In 2008 it clashed with protesters in Beirut and took over Beirut in a show of force. Since then it has held the presidency hostage, maneuvered its people into the presidency and Prime Minister’s office and sent forces to fight in Syria and to Iraq. Hezbollah now wants to be the arbiter of Lebanon’s future and it knows that sectarian strife can undermine that.</p>
<p>Nasrallah then moved on to complaining about protests in Lebanon. Hezbollah has only a handful of seats in parliament but flexes its military muscle in Lebanon to have a stranglehold over the government and the Health Ministry. Nasrallah wants its Prime Minister choice Hassan Diab to stay in office. He has been there since January.</p>
<p>Hezbollah appears fearful over recent US pressure and even talk of trying to enforce UN Resolutions and taking away Hezbollah’s massive arsenal. Hezbollah has more weapons than many small countries, including 150,000 rockets. It has armored vehicles, bunkers, tunnels, small arms, missiles, anti-tank missiles, anti-ship missiles, drones, mines, rifles, RPGs and basically everything an army needs to fight a modern war. Thousands of its cadres got training by fighting in Syria since 2012. Hezbollah claims it needs this arsenal to “defend” against Israel, when in fact it threatens to conquer Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Nasrallah said that his “resistance” movement in Lebanon and his allies in “Palestine” and throughout the region “had come up with a plan, an idea and a strategy to counter the enemy.” He did not reveal the secret plan. Nasrallah believes the US launched a conspiracy in June against Hezbollah and that he is actively countering the conspiracy. In this assertion he portrays protesters and others as spreading “sedition” in the country and that Hezbollah will stand against this. He urged Lebanon to try to reach out during the financial crisis and to work with other countries. He noted that the US had sanctioned Hezbollah and said “we have no problem being punished, but why punish the people.” This was an argument against sanctions on Syria and those that affect Lebanon.</p>
<p>Nasrallah urged pragmatism and not rumors or just “talk.” For instance he said there are proposals to bring support from Venezeula for the economy. Iran recently sent several tankers with gasoline to Caracas but Nasrallah said trade with Lebanon was not likely. His main concern was the Americans.</p>
<p>“I do not intend to reveal it at the moment, but we have an important and dangerous equation that I will no talk about, and if the Americans continue their efforts to keep the Lebanese people hungry we will do so.” This cryptic threat ended with vows to “kill” whoever tries to take Hezbollah’s weapons. “We will kill you.”</p>
<p>Nasrallah appears to want to shift Lebanon to working not only with its Iranian allies, but also potentially China. He said if the Chinese are ready to help, why is Lebanon waiting for the US. He said the US doesn’t care about Lebanon “or whether we live or die.” He said the US is abandoning allies and leaving the region, noting the US drawdown of forces in Germany. “Look at how the Americnas treat their allies around the world, they humiliate and insult them.” He then drew a comparison to the US leaving Vietnam and abandoning South Vietnam. He may have been thinking of how the US had abandoned Kurdish fighters in Syria in October 2019. Nasrallah’s point was that the US was not reliable, it would not stand by Lebanon during the financial crisis and that it was time to shift Lebanon entirely to a post-American world order. This is a world order it has been wanting to create for a long time, but Nasrallah’s speech appeared intended not for his supporters, who already dislike America, but potential new supporters. He was saying in essence: We have been right all along, see?</p>
<p>Hezbollah is focused on keeping the Syrian regime afloat and keeping the Iranian-backed “axis of resistance” strong. He said that if anything thinks they will starve Lebanon they will be surprised. “We won’t submit to them or the Israelis.”</p>
<p>Hezbollah’s Iranian ally meanwhile on Wednesday was busy bashing the UN and Saudi Arabia. It appears that Nasrallah is today the main beacon of hope for Iran, a gateway to the sea and a potential bridge to the Palestinians and other Sunni groups. Iran hopes that Hezbollah might be able to turn the tide of the financial crises in Lebanon and Syria. Iran already tried to rely on Hezbollah in Iraq, using a key Hezbollah conduit to help shore up work with Shi’ite militias there. Nasrallah’s speech was clear: A crisis is emerging and an equation has developed, if the US pushed too much more, things could escalate.</p>
<p>Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah gave a speech on Tuesday threatening to kill anyone who tries to take away Hezbollah’s weapons. “To anyone who gives us the option of dying with our weapons or of starvation, I say that the weapons will remain in our hands and we will not go hungry, we will kill you. We will kill you.” The harsh rhetoric exceeded the usual boasting by Hezbollah and was a direct threat to the US and internal Lebanese protesters that any pressure on Hezbollah will be met with violence. Hezbollah is angry that US sanctions on Syria are harming the economy in Lebanon and that there are voices who think Hezbollah should stop maintaining itself as an armed force within Lebanon.

<p>“It is impossible to carry out democratic elections, try cases at court, design and enforce laws, or indeed manage any of the other quiet business of government when agencies beyond the state also have access to violence. For just this reason, people and parties who wish to undermine democracy and the rule of law create and fund violent organizations that involve themselves in politics.” - Timothy Snyder, On Tyranny, #6 “&hellip;we make a great mistake if we imagine that the Soviet NKVD or the Nazi SS acted without support. Without the assistance of regular police forces, and sometimes regular soldiers, they could not have killed on such a large scale.” - Timothy Snyder, #7</p>
<p>“The past&hellip;had not merely been altered, it had been actually destroyed. For how could you establish even the most obvious fact when there existed no record outside your own memory? - George Orwell, 1984</p>
<p>“Of course it was a great ego trip to have it in the (New York) Times, but it’s been a year since anyone edited my stuff, and I had that same cold-water-to-the-face feeling: god-dammit, why do they always rip out the best stuff?” - Molly Ivins</p>
<p>“It surely was true that the press was not always lovable, and in not loving it (Franklin) Roosevelt was at one with the vast majority of politicians through all of Washington’s history. But for the American people there always remained the question: if their politicians behaved as poorly as many of them did with the press keeping some kind of eye on them, what would they be doing with nobody watching?” - David Brinkley, Washington Goes to War</p>
<p>“We are not here to kill people, we are here to restore calm and order.” – Platoon Sergeant, 82nd Airborne, April 5, 1968 (24 hrs after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.) – Edward Lotterman, Bismarck Tribune, 6/14/20</p>
<p>“New York Governor Andrew Cuomo&hellip;signed sweeping police reform bills into law, notably banning chokeholds and repealing a hotly contested state law known as 50-A, which kept officers’ disciplinary records confidential. The repeal of 50-A means police disciplinary records can be made public – including complaints against officers that have not been substantiated, - The legislation also gives the state attorney general power as a special prosecutor in cases of police-involved deaths and bans false, race-based 911 calls. Another bill requires state police troopers to wear body cameras. “Cuomo also issued an executive order Friday requiring local governments and police departments to develop a plan to modernize police strategies and programs. The governor said each plan must address specific topics&hellip;use of force, crowd management, de-escalation tactics and bias training with input from the community. Local governments must pass their plans into law by April 1, 2021 in order to be eligible for state funding. Cuomo said, ‘We’re not going to be, as a state government, subsidizing improper police tactics.’” - CBS, June 12, 2020</p>
<p>“When the people change, the palace cannot hold.” - Naomi Alderman</p>
<p>With the New York Times ownership deciding that it’s no longer “fit (for their editorial board) to print” racist ravings of a southern Senator like Tom Cotton (R-AR) as equivalent to reflections of U.S. Generals, Admirals, Civil Servants, Congressmen and Justice officials that it is their duty, and that of every police officer, to be guardians of every American citizen, regardless of color, not warriors against them; it is clear that a new day is dawning in the United States. However, it would be a mistake to credit Times leadership with courage of day-to-day journalists who risk their jobs and lives in exposing falsehoods and tyrannies. The big NYT honchos still suck up to (U.S. Attorney General) Bill Barr, either from admiration, fear, or lack of moral compass.</p>
<p>Media moguls can sniff the direction of the wind just as well as politicians. The New York Times, after years of suppressing the better angels of their reporters and rank and file editorialists, has finally been served notice that the vast numbers of white people of all ages in the streets, as demonstrators, supporting oppressed folks of color, are not going to just aid their elected officials in defunding militarized aspects of public safety. As voters, on November 3, 2020, they are going to aid the Democrats in defunding racism and the Republican Party.</p>
<p>From Times management’s point of view, Tom Cotton is much worse than a racist. He’s a losing racist. He, and fellow Republican cowards in the Senate, have, in fact, long been little more than seething droplets of past and present hatreds and fears, wrapped up in wads of money. But that was enough to intimidate the New York Times, and other “masters of the media,” until now.</p>
<p>The Times turnabout is almost as astounding on behalf of “movers and shakers” in this country as NASCAR’s decision to ban the Confederate Flag from their races on behalf of the rest of us, “the moved and the shaken.” Compared to these two events, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell’s apology for tolerance of President Trump’s racist rejection of Colin Kaepernick’s devout kneeling gesture in honor of “Black Lives Matter,” is thin soup. He can be believed only if Kaepernick gets a tryout with NFL teams that really need a backup quarterback, like the Minnesota Vikings or the other five that are looking him over, and Goodell takes a knee with coaches and players at every NFL game throughout the upcoming season, whenever it occurs.</p>
<p>Most interesting of all, however, is the exposure of Attorney General William Barr’s treason to the legal profession, his failure to represent his client, the American people, instead of the cowardly sociopath who occupies the White House. I would not know such things, of course, beyond their availability in my local paper and media, were it not for conversations with my growing KGB renegade menagerie assembled in Mandan, ND.</p>
<p>High Plains Reader: I understand, Mr. Swamp Fox, that you have overheard more mutterings from “Benito” Bill Barr, Trump’s Badass Barracuda Barrister (B-6th power), in consultation with his alligator allies in the White House Swamp.</p>
<p>Mr. Swamp Fox: Yes. And I have brought along my friend Jim Crow XV, who has been listening in on the Senate Republican Caucus. Somewhere between the original Jim Crow among Democrats in the South in the 19th and 20th Centuries, and the Republican Jim Crows all over the country in the 20th and 21st Centuries, after Civil Rights Acts of the 1960s, our 15th Generation Jim Crow broke away from serving racism and genocide like the rest of us.</p>
<p>Jim Crow XV: Majority Leader “Rich” Mitch McConnell makes similar laments as Barr, that their “divide and conquer” game has been exposed by a combination of Trump’s stupidity and cupidity, and the revelation of a confederacy of white policemen, masquerading as labor unions, determined to snuff out the lives of Americans they deem guilty of “breathing while black.”</p>
<p>Mr. Swamp Fox and I heard them complain that inconvenient truths were escaping Orwellian “Memory Holes” faster than they could cover them up. Even worse, Trump’s (Supreme Court) Justice, Neil Gorsuch, was favoring statutory over situational law.</p>
<p>Rich Mitch: You did such a great job of sabotaging the Mueller Report, Bill, but can’t you unleash your alligators on the press and the public as before? I now have to take (Senator) Mitt Romney (R-UT) seriously! And John Bolton is going to blow us up with his book. He knew he couldn’t swing enough votes in the Senate to dump Trump. I had those wimps by the short hairs.</p>
<p>B-6th power: You know yourself Mitch, that Trump is the problem. You should have convicted him when you had the chance. Now I have to mop up after him and Stephen Miller. I envy (VP) Dick Cheney. He peddled racist and fascist merchandise under President George W. Bush, and Wall Street got rich, after ruining the middle class and making things for poor people and folks of color that much worse. President Barack Obama and the Democrats cleaned up the mess Republicans made, and violent crime went way down after 9/11, but, thanks to the Tea Party, white cops who still wanted to kill blacks had happy hunting grounds in rural areas as well as the cities. The New York Times and the Washington Post just sat back while Trump peddled his Birther poison, leaving it to Msnbc’s Lawrence O’Donnell to put his job on the line by exposing it. Now I have to sit Trump’s sorry ass down and get him to sign an anti-police-criminality order with some teeth in it, so he can veto your watered down version of a House Bill with a full set of shark’s choppers.</p>
<p>Rich Mitch: It seemed like a good idea at the time to let Trump be President. Look at all those tax breaks and right wing judges we got. Who ever thought that a critical mass of white people of all ages would figure out that we were targeting them as much as we and they were targeting people of color? Trump has just been too obvious, with his incompetence, as well as his racism.</p>
<p>Alligator #1: Hey! Don’t blame us. We didn’t create Mother Nature’s Covid-19 or your indifference to human suffering other than your own. We just eat flesh, like you eat souls.</p>
<p>B-6th power: Nah. It’s those damn I-phones. How the hell do we cover up things now?</p>
<p>Alligator #2: You can’t, if people are no longer afraid of the brutal truths about murderous lies, as well as murderous cops, that video cameras reveal. Undaunted citizens, and a Congress more responsive to their demands, mean that your manipulations are the beginning of the end of Trump’s Republican Party, and you know it. You already threw Trump under the bus by indicating that he actually did hide out in the White House bunker during the height of the demonstrations. Wasn’t that a bit too transparent?</p>
<p>B-6th power: I blamed Secret Service and the demonstrators so he could avoid responsibility.</p>
<p>Rich Mitch: Trump and his dwindling base may be dumb enough to believe it. Nobody else does. And even though President “Bonespurs” behaved himself at West Point this weekend, every rank in the U.S. Military, from Private to General, hates his misuse of their loyal service. In addition, your scam to spring (Convicted former National Security Chief) Mike Flynn from his treasonous conduct with Russia and Turkey is coming undone, and Trump is going to have to pardon him, if you can’t get other judges in D.C. to intervene.</p>
<p>B-6th power: And you will be so busy trying to save your ass in Kentucky, you won’t have time to spare for your melting Senate Majority in the other States. Even voter suppression might not be enough in battleground States. Ordinary judges of election still have to face their neighbors.</p>
<p>Jim Crow XV: That’s quite a conversation, isn’t it! Even ordinary Municipal, State, and Federal Judges, no matter how conservative or right wing, still have to face their peers in communities and Bar Associations around the country. Local reputations matter as much now as they always have, and as black lives should have mattered all along.</p>
<p>HPR: Does that mean that Trump, Barr, and Rich Mitch are screwed no matter what they do?</p>
<p>Chicago Dog: Probably, but only if Democrats, liberals, independents, recovering Republicans, voters under 30 (for a change) massively do what has never been done on a national scale: register themselves; register others; make sure absentee ballot applications get to everyone who wants one; make sure those applications are in the mail; and challenge, with their host of lawyers, each and every local, state, and federal attempt by Republicans to suppress voting.</p>
<p>Jim Crow XV: Covid or not, people should vote in 2020 as if their lives depended on it, because they do, and always have. The Trump-Barr-Rich Mitch “axis-of-evil” just makes it more obvious. The killing of yet another unarmed black man, Rayshard Brooks, in Atlanta by undisciplined white policemen took place one day after New York State issued a blueprint for police reform in all 50 States, but 5 and 7 months before it can reign in the White House.</p>
<p>Ms. Recovering Republican Lap Dog: President Cry Baby labels a 75yr old white guy, put into intensive care by Buffalo, NY’s “finest” Storm Troop re-enactors, as an “antifa agitator,” and then expects a medal for his costly “photo-op” at West Point, and postponing his race baiting rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, by one day. I’m sure Barr really enjoys pimping for Trump by now.</p>
<p>Mr. Swamp Fox: You can be sure that B-6th power still has some tricks up his sleeve to avoid accountability, but there are signs from the Department of Justice (DOJ) that he is running out of options, legal or illegal, and running out of patience with his moron Boss.</p>
<p>Jim Crow XV: I managed to snatch some scribbling on toilet paper from a DOJ bathroom, that indicates B-6th power’s real thoughts while at stool. I cleaned them up a bit, titled, and resigned them for your reading pleasure:</p>
<p>Barracuda Bill’s Lament</p>
<p>“If Donald dimwit thinks I’m just a hack;</p>
<p>A gun for hire, that he can throw away.</p>
<p>He’ll surely rue the coming, awful day</p>
<p>That stupid Stephen runs him off the</p>
<p>track.</p>
<p>He had it made. I rigged the Senate’s</p>
<p>voice To maximize their cowardice for</p>
<p>Mitch; And now I have to lift him from</p>
<p>each ditch He digs to worsen each and</p>
