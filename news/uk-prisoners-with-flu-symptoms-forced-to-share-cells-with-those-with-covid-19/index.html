UK prisoners with flu symptoms forced to share cells with those with Covid-19</p>
<p>Prisoners who have symptoms of Covid-19 are being placed in the same cells as those who have tested positive for the virus, the Guardian has learned.</p>
<p>The strategy, known as cohorting, has prompted fears that inmates with conventional flu symptoms risk contracting the more serious coronavirus.</p>
<p>Quick guide UK lockdown: what are the coronavirus restrictions? Show Hide What do the restrictions involve? People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes: Shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible</p>
<p>One form of exercise a day – for example a run, walk, or cycle – alone or with members of your household</p>
<p>Any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person</p>
<p>Travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will: Close all shops selling non-essential goods, including clothing and electronic stores and other premises including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship</p>
<p>Stop all gatherings of more than two people in public – excluding people you live with</p>
<p>Stop all social events, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies, but excluding funerals Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.</p>
<p>Last Thursday and Friday, 12 inmates at Wandsworth prison in south-west London tested positive for the disease and were moved to a designated isolation wing.</p>
<p>A further 40 inmates, who presented with coughs and respiratory problems, are now resident on the same landings. All the prisoners in “isolation” are sharing cells. Meals are brought to them and some report not being allowed out for showers.</p>
<p>The measures form part of guidance issued to prisons last week by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). “If facing multiple cases of those displaying symptoms, ‘cohorting’, or the gathering of potentially infected cases into a designated area, may be necessary,” it reads.</p>
<p>A source at HMP Wandsworth told the Guardian that there were no plans for further testing at the jail, and prisoners who display symptoms are instead being placed on the isolation wing. The source said 52 prisoners were now classified as “infected”. Separately, they reported that D wing at the prison has had no hot water supply for a week.</p>
<p>The revelation came as the Guardian learned that the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, was looking at releasing pregnant prisoners, amid growing concern about the vulnerability of inmates to the spread of coronavirus. It is understood that the government is not considering a larger-scale release of low-risk prisoners.</p>
<p>An 84-year-old man became the first British prisoner to die after contracting coronavirus last week. As of Sunday night, 2 prisoners had died from Covid-19, while 55 had tested positive. Thirteen prison staff had tested positive across seven prisons, while four Prisoner Escort and Custody Services staff had tested positive.</p>
<p>The Prisoners Advice Service ( PAS) on Monday published a template for prisoners and their families to refer to in the event that they contracted coronavirus and needed to ask for release on compassionate grounds, under the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Current restrictions on legal aid means prisoners are unlikely to get free legal representation for such applications.</p>
<p>Lubia Begum-Rob, the director of PAS, said placing prisoners who tested positive for coronavirus alongside those with only symptoms breached prison service guidelines, which state: “Any prisoner or detainee with a new, continuous cough or a high temperature should be placed in protective isolation for seven days.”</p>
<p>She said: “Cohorting prisoners, because of multiple cases of inmates displaying symptoms, can only work in containing the virus if each prisoner is kept in his or her own cell.</p>
<p>“Such prisoners should not be sharing a cell with another displaying symptoms, given that one prisoner may have the common flu and the other may have Covid-19.”</p>

<p>A report, published in 2018, found 15% of the prison population had respiratory issues. In 2019, inspectors found that 10 out of 35 prisons inspected failed to meet minimum standards of cleanliness and infection control compliance.</p>
<p>Last month a report from the National Audit Office revealed a chronic state of disrepair across the prison estate, from leaking roofs and failed heating systems to broken cell windows and rat infestations.</p>
<p>Concerns have been raised about the safety of older prisoners at risk from Covid-19. There are about 1,700 prisoners over 70, with many in their 80s and a growing number over 90.</p>
<p>Last week, the MoJ announced that all prison visits in England and Wales were cancelled until further notice. All prisoners are confined to their cells apart from cleaners, kitchen staff and other key prisoner workers. All inmates who normally work are being paid regardless.</p>
<p>The MoJ said inmates who could not access the telephones on the wings had access to secure phone handsets, in order to contact relatives and friends on pre-authorised contact numbers.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the MoJ confirmed cohorting measures were in place in prisons to “protect the rest of the prison population”. He added that decisions on testing for Covid-19 on prisoners were taken by Public Health England.</p>
<p>The MoJ said: “Our utmost priority is to protect life during the coronavirus outbreak. We have flexible plans in place to keep all staff and prisoners as safe as possible, and are issuing secure phone handsets to help offenders keep in touch with their loved ones.”

<h3 id="mass-court-weighs-petition-to-release-prisoners-amid-pandemic">Mass. Court Weighs Petition to Release Prisoners Amid Pandemic</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.nbcboston.com/2019/09/Prison-Generic-3.jpg?fit=722%2C406" alt="img">
The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court will hear arguments Tuesday on a petition that seeks to reduce the prison population in the state in a bid prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The petition seeks to lower the number of prisoners through, among other measures, the release of &ldquo;incarcerated individuals who are vulnerable to COVID-19, near the end of their sentence, or who do not pose a threat to the public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It also asks that those eligible for parole, including medical parole, are released; and that trial courts take the pandemic into account when they analyze the need for pretrial detention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correctional facilities, where physical distancing and vigilant hygiene are impossible, can be petri dishes for the rapid spread of infectious disease,&rdquo; the petition said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outbreaks in our prisons will, of course, imperil the lives of incarcerated people, but they will also endanger correctional officers and medical staff, their families, and their communities as staff cycle through the facilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The petition was filed by lawyers from the Committee for Public Counsel Services, the Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the American Civil Liberties Union.</p>
<p>Seven of the state’s district attorneys, however, have filed a brief opposing the emergency petition, saying inmates should be considered for release on a case-by-case basis in hearings before judges.</p>
<p>Critics say the move could put others in danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In many cases we are talking about releasing an abusive man back into a home where he has raped or abused a woman or a child,&rdquo; Wendy Murphy, a victims&rsquo; rights attorney, said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very concerned about the well-being of the thousands of victims whose rights would be violated by the mass release of thousands of individuals from our jails and prisons,&rdquo; said Bristol County District Attorney Thomas Quinn, in a statement. &ldquo;This would jeopardize both their physical and mental well-being, especially in cases of domestic violence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are approximately 16,500 incarcerated people in Massachusetts, according to the petition.</p>
<p>Several facilities in Massachusetts are overcrowded, according to the Quarterly Report on the Status of Prison Capacity. In 2019, the Bristol Dartmouth facility was operating at 278% capacity and the Suffolk Nashua Street facility was operating at 122% capacity.</p>
<p>Suffolk District Attorney Rachel Rollins said earlier this month that she is working on a plan to release inmates who are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19.

<h3 id="innocent-prisoners-are-going-to-die-of-the-coronavirus">Innocent Prisoners Are Going to Die of the Coronavirus</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/1LKb6esl8KGcDPh8l-V9ROqjRcs=/0x359:4888x2905/960x500/media/img/mt/2020/03/GettyImages_470098972_toned/original.jpg" alt="img">
“We have a testing infrastructure in place and are following the COVID-19 CDC guidelines,” says Maria Finn, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. “We are confident that any inmate who meets the criteria will be tested.”</p>
<p>Patricia Cummings, who heads the Conviction Integrity Unit in the Philadelphia DA’s Office, is skeptical. “It’s your worst nightmare,” she says. Convicting an innocent man is tragic enough. Much worse would be if, after the state admits the mistake, the inmate were to die while the judicial system ambled to a conclusion. But the current situation is worse yet: Nothing was done to treat this potentially contagious prisoner, even though signs abounded that a viral “bomb” was about to explode, Cummings says. “It seemed like such a conscious indifference to not only Walter Ogrod’s well-being, but everybody in that prison.”</p>
<p>The prison’s decision to forego testing was either lucky or correct. Ogrod has returned to his cell and is recovering. But to Cummings, an equally frightening nightmare could now be unfolding. “How many people did he infect, if in fact he [did] have COVID-19?” she asks. “And are we going to have a widespread pandemic in the prison system?”</p>
<p>Across the country, innocence lawyers are filing emergency petitions to get their clients released from prison before the virus can kill them. In the space of 24 hours, I heard from attorneys representing some two dozen clients in much the same legal position as Ogrod: A trial judge or appellate court had found credible proof of their innocence, their convictions were overturned, and the state was told to release them or give them a new trial. But now they are trapped in prison as their hearings are delayed, prosecutors appeal to higher courts, reviews are stalled, or the decisions sit on the desks of judges who could make the final determination. Attorneys say that hundreds more wrongly convicted people have cases lingering in various stages of litigation; those hearings will go to the back of the line, behind new criminal cases, once courts reopen.</p>
<p>Lawrence Glickman: The conservative case against safety</p>
<p>The coronavirus reveals characteristics of the judicial system that will prove lethal. The virus is lightning fast, while the judicial system is glacially slow. The virus is nimble and opportunistic; the system is ponderous, inflexible in its rules, slow to reverse its mistakes, and quick to attach large punishments to small crimes. Experts say that America will now see the price of mass incarceration, and that it will be catastrophically high, both for people in prisons and for the communities around them.</p>
<p>“Prisons are almost perfectly designed to promote the transmission of communicable disease,” says Homer Venters, the former chief medical officer at New York City’s Rikers Island. Forget about social distancing: Prisoners eat together, use the same showers, work or watch television side by side, and often sleep in the same dorm room with dozens of other inmates. Forget about hygiene: Prisons are “incredibly filthy, unsanitary places,” Venters says, where there’s often no soap, much less the freedom for hand-washing. But what makes prisoners especially vulnerable to this virus is the years of medical neglect. That’s particularly true of those claiming their innocence, who generally spend 10, 20, 30, or 40 years behind bars before they’re vindicated. But Josiah “Jody” Rich, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University, told me that the same applies to most inmates.
