news, local-news,</p>
<p>In 1916, Private Harold (Guy) Walker Keid was stationed in Egypt&rsquo;s Tel El Kebir when he decided to write a letter to his good friend Elsie Muir in Brisbane, telling her about his time at Gallipoli. &ldquo;Show this letter round to all whom you think are interested,&rdquo; he told her. Little did Mr Keid or Miss Muir imagine his words would surface more than a century later, for a new generation of keenly interested readers. The original is now in the State Library of Queensland with a copy held by Guy Keid&rsquo;s grandson, Barry Saltmarsh of Burnie. Private Keid was a stretcher bearer with the 3rd Australian Field Ambulance. He had signed up in 1914 when he was a 19-year-old science student at the Central Technical College in Brisbane. There he met Elsie Muir, a fellow student, and they became firm friends. After the war, he moved to Hobart with his wife Clare, where he was the chief geologist at the Mines Department. He died in 1969 in his 90s, having lost four of his five brothers in World War 1. Below are edited excerpts from Mr Keid&rsquo;s letter. My Dear Elsie, In this letter I intend to try and give you an account of the life on Gallipoli. We landed in Turkey on 25th April. Preparations were carried out in Lemnos island. For about seven weeks we were in Mudros harbor practicing landing from boats. Pictures of men landing at Gallipoli as appeared in the daily papers were photographs of our practice at Lemnos. A few days before we left Lemnos for Gallipoli we were put aboard the Torpedo boat and from there practiced our landing. On the morning of the afternoon of 24th April our troop ship left Mudros harbor accompanied by about 20 other troopers &amp; about 10 Torpedo boats. About 10 PM we transhipped on to HMS Ribble which took us to within about 200 yards of the shore at Gallipoli. It was now about 4.30 AM. We were put into life boats &amp; towed by a naval pinnace to within 50 yards of the shore. From here we had to row to shore. We rowed until the water was only chest deep &amp; then jumped over board &amp; waded ashore carrying all our equipment with us. Before we left the Ribble, Abdul was aware of our presence &amp; we could hear the bullets hitting the side of the boat long before our turn came to get off. IN OTHER NEWS It needed a bit of courage to leave a nice comfortable place of safety to go out into a place where men were packed as close as sheep and bullets ducking over our heads. When we jumped overboard we had to stop &amp; take out all our stretchers and medical equipment so that we would be of some use when we did get ashore. We had to traverse a stretch of about 30 yards of beach before we reached any cover. Then news came down to us that a colonel had been badly wounded. A squad of which I was one, set out in search of him.Our squad arrived only to find that we were too late. He was dead. We therefore set out to look for more patients. In a very short time we found a man. A few feet away lay his broken rifle &amp; bayonet. His cartridge pouch lay a few feet out of his reach. We examined him &amp; found him to be one of the enemy. We rendered first aid &amp; put him in a place of safety. After this for the first four days we remember nothing more except carrying wounded. Blood everywhere &amp; groans &amp; shrieks of agony accompanied by the whiz of bullets &amp; the bursting of shells was all we remembered. Then the fighting was a bit calmer. Early in May we received our baptism of Howitzer fire. It has a deep buzzing sound like 20 swarms of bees. We only got six shells thrown at us but I can tell you we were unnerved. Everything was quiet again until 19th May when Abdul made his famous attempt to drive us into the sea. He left about 3000 dead between our lines. On 25th May the armistice was held to allow each side to bury their dead. Some of the bodies had been lying out in the sun for about 3 weeks so you can guess they were pretty ripe. After the Armistice things were quiet again until 6th August when our men made an attack. There were a good few casualties - about 30 of men shifted about 300 stretcher cases in 12 hrs. Throughout November nothing happened but on 14th Dec our corps was taken off the Peninsula. Our feelings when we heard that we were going to be withdrawn cannot be explained. It seemed hard to leave the place after so much work had been done &amp; so much blood spilt. Our life on the Peninsula, taking it generally was not too bad. At times food etc was scarce but we always had enough to live on. Our greatest want was water. It depends on what sort of a fellow a man is, whether he will enjoy himself on Active Service. If he wants to find fault with things then he can easily do it. But if he believes in give &amp; take he will have a good time. I ask you to remember me to all whom we both know.

On this solemn day, when Australians pause to reflect on the service and sacrifice of so many in the armed forces, it seems appropriate to grapple with one of the enduring myths around that most-storied of Anzac battles: Gallipoli.</p>

<p>Far too many still don’t get Gallipoli and stubbornly insist the 1915 effort to knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war by taking the Dardanelle Straits was a colossal waste. The Australian War Memorial itself has deemed the operation a “failure” that had “no influence on the course of the war,” and a writer in these pages recently opined the only good thing that happened at Gallipoli was the “evacuation”. Not long ago, New Zealand’s Governor-General said New Zealanders had “nothing to gain” from the fight there, and a Radio New Zealand program last year declared it a “horrific disaster.”</p>
<p>But those views are tragically misleading, leaving errant national narratives in place with harmful consequences. Gallipoli may not have succeeded in the classic sense, but it was certainly successful in a very important way.</p>
<p>The campaign’s ultimate objective was to knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war with one swift strike. Of course, that didn’t happen. But then again, real war isn’t as easy as Luke Skywalker blowing up the Death Star.

Anzac Day Bega, Anzac Wallaga Lake, Andy Bond, Andy Bond Wallaga lake, Gallipoli</p>
<p>One year after the tragedy of Gallipoli, the war effort was progressing but low on new recruits, and troops from Australia and New Zealand were recognised with the inaugural Anzac Day. The day was marked mostly by injured soldiers, who continued to return home to their families, and the Bega War Service Committee had a new recruitment sergeant on board whose job it was to get as many young men to sign up as possible. Private Farrow had fought in Europe and returned, and according to news reports in April 1916, &ldquo;the authorities had absolutely refused to allow him to return to the front&rdquo;, adding &ldquo;he was anxious to do what he could to help recruiting&rdquo; for the war. A letter was received from the Returned Soldier&rsquo;s Association discussing the first Anzac Day, and Farrow said promoters were looking to raise money to build a memorial hall in Sydney, and help support &ldquo;crippled and blind&rdquo; soldiers. At that time, new recruits for the war were sent to a camp at Kiama before heading to the frontline. One of those recruits was British War Medal and Victory Medal recipient Andy Bond, who enlisted at the age of 33, joining the 33rd Australian Infantry Battalion on the Western Front and spending a grueling nine months fighting trench warfare in France. The son of Alick Bond and Helen de Mestre, his grandfather was horse trainer Etienne Livingston de Mestre, who famously won the first two Melbourne Cups. Through his mother, Bond must have known his family links to France. His brother Jack had fought in the Boer War in South Africa and had unsuccessfully attempted to enlist alongside Andy and another brother, William. Andy was the only of the three brothers to experience overseas combat during the war. Bond&rsquo;s links to France go back to his great-grandfather, Etienne&rsquo;s father and one time director of the Bank of New South Wales, the French-born businessman Prosper de Mestre. The 33rd was an all-volunteer battalion within the 1st Australian Imperial Force, formed in early 1916 as part of an expansion of the armed forces after Gallipoli. After five months of training for the frontline, the battalion made its way to Armentieres, and joined their first battle at Messines in 1917 where they were given the most dangerous position on the battlefield and managed to hold their line against German forces despite constant shelling. Bond returned home after Germany launched an offensive on the Western Front, and Bond&rsquo;s battalion desperately tried to hold the line at Amiens before counter-attacking at Hangard Wood and turning back German forces as they attacked Villers-Bretonneux in April, 1918. Heavy casualties and falling recruitment saw the battalion merge with the 36th later that month. The connection between the town of Villers-Bretonneux and the Cobargo area was solidified this week following a donation to residents devastated by the recent bushfire emergency. One thousand residents of the town held a solidarity march to the Australian National Memorial and Sir John Monash Centre, where a school choir sang a song especially written for the bushfire appeal called &lsquo;Australia, Stop Burning&rsquo;. Across the course of the war Bond&rsquo;s battalion lost 451 soldiers, and more than 2000 were injured. Two members received the Victoria Cross. &ldquo;The manager of Wallaga Lake station informs us that Pte. Andy Bond, writing to his mother, says he has had a good experience in trench fighting in France, but has had the bad luck to be wounded and also gassed,&rdquo; wrote the Cobargo Chronicle in 1916. &ldquo;He was at time of writing doing well in hospital in Norwich, and desired to be remembered to friends.&rdquo; Bond was welcomed home with a celebration, which involved being cheered by a crowd for &ldquo;several minutes&rdquo;, at Tilba Tilba two years later, after being gassed and injured badly twice in battle. &ldquo;Welcome to our hero&rdquo;, said one banner on the Temperance hall wall, which was laced with flags and flowers. &ldquo;Pte. Bond, who was loudly cheered as he came forward to respond, said he was very pleased to be back. He thanked them for the reception they bad given him. It was not so bad over there. He had nothing to fight for, but thought he ought to fight for Australia,&rdquo; the newspaper said. &ldquo;A couple of carloads came from Cobargo and Bermagui, amongst whom were Mr. Kennelly and Mr. McIntyre. As Andy walked up the hall to the stage he was received with ringing cheers and clapping of hands which lasted several minutes.&rdquo; Bond died many years later, in November, 1943, and is buried at Berry Cemetery. His name is etched on the Tilba Tilba honour roll. Over 400 Australians enlisted in the First World War, with at least 165 of those recruits from the South Coast of NSW.</p>
