In 1981, big screen legend Natalie Wood went missing from the yacht she shared with her husband, Robert Wagner—only to be found approximately six hours later, floating facedown in the Pacific Ocean. In 2000, Sam Kashner revisited the tragedy for Vanity Fair, detailing the ambiguities that have prompted decades of speculation about whether Wood’s drowning was really an accident. The next year Suzanne Finstad released Natasha, the definitive biography of Wood, which shed even more light on the night Wood died. In 2011, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department officially reopened its investigation into Wood’s death.</p>
<p>Now, nearly 20 years later, Finstad is rereleasing her book as Natalie Wood: The Complete Biography, an even more comprehensive volume that includes new details Finstad has learned about Wood’s death since her book’s first edition—details that, according to the author, show even more conclusively that Wood didn’t drown by chance. Below, the author reveals her most explosive findings—and explains why now, more than ever, she believes Wagner played a role in the fall that killed Natalie Wood.</p>
<p>As I was writing the last chapters of Natasha (the title of the first edition of this book), 20 years after Natalie Wood’s death, I felt a sense of urgency to get the pages into print. For more than four years, I had been the keeper of Natalie Wood’s deepest, darkest secrets—her crippling fears, harrowing superstitions, terrible incidents from her past that few knew of. Natalie never disclosed her history of trauma, except through her fragile vulnerability and in her tender, old- soul eyes.</p>
<p>As I plumbed her past, Natalie’s demons and their origins revealed themselves to me as if released from a genie’s lamp. Family violence. An alcoholic father. A pathological attachment to her Svengali stage mother. Psychological abuse as a child star. Paranoias. Phobias. A bedroom of storybook dolls she believed were alive and spoke to her. Pimped at 15 to Frank Sinatra. Forced to return an engagement ring to her high school sweetheart, who tried to kill himself afterward. Exploited into a sexual liaison as a teenager with 42-year-old director Nicholas Ray to prove that she could play a “bad” girl in Rebel Without a Cause.</p>
<p>The secret that was buried deepest in Natalie’s closet of skeletons was the shocking end of her fairy tale first marriage to bobby socks idol Robert Wagner, known to his friends as R.J. To protect Wagner’s image, Natalie publicly took the fall for their sudden divorce in 1961. She never refuted fan-magazine gossip that her marriage to Wagner imploded over an alleged affair she had with her costar Warren Beatty while filming Splendor in the Grass. In time, the gossip, patently false, was reported as fact.</p>
<p>Only a trusted few knew Natalie’s account. I was told by three of Natalie’s close friends, by her mother’s best friend, and her sister, Lana, that Natalie came upon R.J. in their Beverly Hills mansion in flagrante with a man. Lana recalled Natalie’s arriving in hysterics at their parents’ house, her hand bleeding, and shutting herself in her old bedroom. Natalie woke up in a hospital, dazed and in shock, after taking an overdose of sleeping pills and going into a coma.</p>
<p>That was as much as I wrote. But there is more to that story too.</p>
<p>The fallout from a lifetime of psychological damage and abuse led Natalie to multiple suicide attempts, daily psychoanalysis, and a fear of being alone at night so primal and deep-seated that she regressed to her child self. Her greatest fear, I discovered, derived from a prophecy told to her superstitious Russian mother by a Gypsy—namely, that she would die in dark water.

<h3 id="natalie-woods-death-at-sea-and-a-sexual-betrayal-of-robert-wagner">Natalie Wood’s Death At Sea And A Sexual Betrayal Of Robert Wagner</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.maritimeherald.com/wp-content/uploads/Natalie-Woods-Death-At-Sea-And-A-Sexual-Betrayal-Of-Robert-Wagner-1.jpg" alt="img">
Post sponsored by the Texas Jobs site That are easy to get and people are desperate to get them</p>
<p>A new biography of the actress exposed the complicated relationship between one of the best-known marriages in Hollywood.</p>
<p>In the case of Natalie Wood, it is almost impossible to make use of the recurring phrase used to dismiss the deceased, because “rest in peace”, they do not seem adequate words for her life or for her still mysterious ending. Almost 40 years after her body was found in the sea after having fallen overboard the boat he was spending the weekend of Thanksgiving in 1981, the unknowns continue about what happened on that boat with her husband, Robert Wagner, actor Christopher Walken, and the ship’s captain, Dennis Davern, were also present. The actress, who became internationally famous for playing Mary in the movie West Side Story, which premiered in 1961 when Wood was 23 years old, still does not find that rest because the causes of his death are reviewed over and over again without being fully clarified whether it was an accident or a murder.</p>
<p>The latest revelation about her life and her relationship with her husband, also actor Robert Wagner, comes from the hand of a biography, Natalie Wood: The Complete Biography , written by Suzanne Finstad and published by Broadway Books. As recounted in the book, Natalie was 22, had not yet released West Side Story, and was not a famous actress but a young woman in love who had made her dream of marrying Robert Wagner a reality, when she discovered a fact that marked her forever. He was an established actor, eight years older than her, who had been one of his childhood idols. The couple embodied one of those golden Hollywood dreams that come true and lived in a large white mansion in Beverly Hills with a Greek palace air.</p>
<p>One night Natalie Wood woke up in her double bed, she realized that her husband was not next to her and, terrified to be alone in the dark – a recurring nightmare since she was a baby -, she got up to look for him. He found him red-handed maintaining a relationship with another person: David Cavendish, the actor’s English butler. According to the author of the book, Wagner’s sexual treasonIt was the reason that their first marriage came to an end – they were married twice, from 1957 to 1962 and from 1972 until the death of the actress – and became the “dark cloud” that hung over the couple when they married for the second time and also about the actress’ mysterious death in 1981. Finstad suggests that if Wood, who was 43 when she died, had not been devastated by Wagner’s disloyalty two decades earlier, she would not have tried to make him jealous with his friend. , the actor Christopher Walken, and the night of her death would not have ended with the fight that the marriage had on the boat they were on and with all their drunk passengers. Circumstance that caused that, when the actress supposedly fell into the sea, no one was in a position to save her.</p>
<p>It was precisely another exhaustive biography of Natalie Wood published by the same author in 2001 that revealed new evidence that suggested that the actress’s death was not accidental , as determined two weeks after her death, and that caused her to Los Angeles police reopened the investigation of the case in 2011. In 2012, the city coroner changed the official cause of death: from “accidental drowning” to “drowning and other undetermined factors”. And although Wagner, now 90, always denied any involvement in the events, in 2018 the police named him “person of interest” in the case and Wood’s death was requalified as “suspicious.” Now, both the actress’s sister, Lana Wood, a former Bond girl, and the skipper of the yacht from which Wood fell, Dennis Davern, point to Wagner as the author of his death.</p>
<p>But in addition to these facts, the new biography reveals part of the content of Natalie Wood’s never published memoirs, in which she not only clarifies the true reason for the end of her first marriage to Robert Wagner but also exposes even darker circumstances that she has to do with the mother of the actress and how she used a very young Natalie. Some portrayed the young Wood as manipulative, self-centered, insecure and precocious from the sexual point of view, but her biographer points out her parents as guilty. She portrays her father as a violent and alcoholic man and the mother as a tremendously ambitious woman who threw her daughter into the arms of men much older than her to help her prosper in her career.. This is how she claims that she had an affair with Frank Sinatra when he was 38 and she was only 15, and that a year later she was forced to have sex with director Nicholas Ray, 43, to demonstrate that she could play a “bad girl ”In Rebel Without a Cause.</p>
<p>Around the same time, Wood told her friends that she was raped by a famous movie star, whom Finstad does not name, after he had invited her to the Chateau Marmont hotel in Hollywood to offer her a role. Natalie buried her secret, but the ghosts reemerged with the end of her fairy tale with Wagner, a union that began with a first date that the Warner Bros. studio arranged when she turned 18. They married despite rumors that he was gay or bisexual. A latent rumor though in the actor’s memoirs, published in 2008, he claims to have had sex with a long list of iconic movie names , from Joan Crawford to Elizabeth Taylor, Anita Ekberg, Joan Collins or Barbara Stanwyck.</p>
<p>Natalie Wood knew the rumors about her partner’s bisexuality but was so in love that she just said to her friends, “Everyone is jealous of us.” At the time, these revelations would have destroyed the career of a leading man like Richard Wagner, so the decision to have a butler who accompanied them on successive house transfers was strange for many and convenient for the actor. Meanwhile, Wood was fulfilling his illusion of conquering the myth with whom he fantasized since when he was 11 years old he placed a poster with his photography on the head of his bed and had no ears for anything else. Of course, the biography shows that on several occasions the actress tried to do without the uncomfortable butler and on the same occasions Wagner found good reasons not to.</p>
<p>The rest is history, although it remains to close what really happened on the Splendor yacht from which Wood fell dressed in flannel pajamas without anyone presumably finding out, but after an explosive marital fight of which the friend and the pattern that accompanied the couple. The body of the actress appeared on the island of Catalina, in southern California, in November 1981, where she arrived dragged by the sea.</p>

<h3 id="natalie-woods-anguish-after-catching-husband-robert-wagner-romping-with-their-butler">Natalie Wood&rsquo;s anguish after catching husband Robert Wagner &lsquo;romping&rsquo; with their butler</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article21739130.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Natalie-Wood-And-Robert-Wagner.jpg" alt="img">
Natalie Wood appeared to have it all back in 1961 - she was 22 years old, married to one of Hollywood&rsquo;s most handsome actors and was on the cusp of superstardom herself.</p>
<p>The actress was married to her childhood crush - Robert Wagner - and was just months away from the release of her films West Side Story and Splendour In The Grass with Warren Beatty.</p>
<p>However, her marriage was dealt a crushing blow that the couple struggled to recover from.</p>
<p>According to a new biography of Wood by Suzanne Finstad, the actress went to pieces after allegedly catching her husband in a clinch with their English live-in butler.</p>
<p>In the book, it&rsquo;s suggested that Wood woke up in the middle of the night at their Beverly Hills home and found her husband missing.</p>
<p>She went looking for him and found him &ldquo;in flagrante&rdquo; with David Cavendish - an employee who lived with them at their home.</p>
<p>(Image: Getty Images)</p>
<p>Author Finstad told the Daily Mail she heard about the incident from three of Wood&rsquo;s close pals, a friend of her mother and by her sister Lana.</p>
<p>They said the actress found Wagner &ldquo;intertwined&rdquo; with his butler.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s said to have become hysterical, smashed a glass and fled - bleeding and in her nightgown - to a neighbour&rsquo;s house where she called her mother.</p>
<p>Her sister Lana, who was 15 at the time, recalled Wood arriving at the family home still bleeding and sobbing, telling them her marriage was over.</p>
<p>(Image: Getty Images)</p>
<p>Lana, who grew up to be an actress and star as a Bond girl in Diamonds Are Forever, claimed her sister shut herself in a bedroom and accidentally overdosed on sleeping pills, with her parents rushing her to hospital to have her stomach pumped.</p>
<p>In the book, it&rsquo;s reported that Wood hid away for a week, losing 10lb from stress with friends claiming she never got over it.</p>
<p>(Image: Getty Images)</p>
<p>The couple separated in June 1961 and divorced a year later.</p>
<p>In the book, Finstad suggests Wood was happy to be blamed for breaking up the marriage because she wanted to protect Wagner as rumours about his sexuality could have destroyed his Hollywood career at the time.</p>
<p>Wagner, now 90, has always strenuously denied any rumours suggesting is gay or bisexual.</p>
<p>She went on to marry film producer Richard Gregson in 1969 but they divorced in 1972.</p>
<p>However, her relationship with Wagner was not over - they got back together later that year and remarried that summer, just months after her divorce from Gregson was finalisaed. They welcomed a daughter, Courtney Wagner, on March 9, 1974.</p>
<p>Wood died aged 43 during a weekend boat trip off the coast of California with her husband Wagner and their friend, fellow actor Christopher Walken.</p>
<p>Her drowning has long been shrouded in mystery with swirling rumours that Wagner may have somehow been involved in her death.</p>
<p>He was named a person of interest in 2018, but has always denied any involvement.
