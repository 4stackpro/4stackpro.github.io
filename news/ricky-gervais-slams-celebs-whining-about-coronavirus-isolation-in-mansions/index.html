<p>Comedian Ricky Gervais lashed out in a new interview at mega-rich celebrities whining about isolation in their multimillion-dollar mansions — while hospital workers and others are risking everything during the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>The British funnyman was furious after seeing a series of celebrity meltdowns, which have included Ellen DeGeneres comparing her sprawling mansion to being stuck in jail, and the likes of Kelly Ripa and singer Sam Smith both breaking down in tears.</p>
<p>“After this is over, I never want to hear people moaning about the welfare state again, I never want to hear people moaning about nurses again. Or porters,” the 58-year-old comedian told the Sun.</p>
<p>“These people are doing 14-hour shifts and not complaining. Wearing masks, and being left with sores, after risking their own health and their families’ health selflessly.</p>
<p>“But then I see someone complaining about being in a mansion with a swimming pool. And, you know, honestly, I just don’t want to hear it,” he insisted.</p>
<p>Gervais — who has a well-documented history of attacking self-centered stars — soon tried to laugh off his comments.</p>
<p>“I didn’t go out much anyway, and there’s always too much booze in the house,” he told the UK paper after his tirade, joking that he was “looking at the watch” ready for the “6 p.m. watershed” to start drinking.</p>
<p>Gervais now knows all about the privileges of wealth, being worth an estimated $125 million and talking to the Sun from his $13 million home, the paper said.</p>
<p>But he says he will never forget the lessons he learned growing up in working-class Reading, where life “was a struggle.”</p>
<p>“And it was — I was the fourth child of an immigrant laborer,” he said of dad Larry, who got up every day at 5:30 a.m. and worked until he was 70.</p>
<p>“I had no money growing up, I didn’t have any until I was 40. But I still had everything,” he told the Sun.</p>
<p>“My mum, she gardened, she grew, she cooked, she sewed, she knitted, she decorated, she did everything she could. And she gave me everything I wanted except money.”</p>
<p>Watching mom Eva taught him that “men worked hard, but women worked miracles,” he said.</p>
<p>“Because when my dad finished his work, that was his own time. But my mum didn’t stop working, women didn’t stop working. Carers didn’t stop working, all the women in my family were carers in some respect.”</p>
<p>The lack of cash also taught him that “all the best things were free — friends, nature, learning and health care,” he said.</p>
<p>“And that’s why I gladly pay my taxes. And that’s why I clap the NHS,” he said of the UK’s free National Health Service.</p>
<p>It also taught him the real value of things in his life — and how he does not need to flash his cash.</p>
<p>“People ask me why I dress like a tramp. And I say, ‘My clothes are clean and comfortable. Who am I trying to impress?’” he said, adding that he doesn’t collect cars “because I can’t drive.”</p>
<p>“Nothing gives me more of a buzz than to help an animal,” said the pet lover, who regularly pushes animal rights charities.</p>
<p>“I’m not a hippie or Communist, I think money’s for the safety of your family and friends, and you can’t take it with you.”</p>
<p>Gervais spoke to the UK paper to promote the second series of “After Life,” his dark show about a man who loses the will to live after his wife dies of cancer.</p>
<p>His current fame allowed him to refuse to compromise on the dark material, which he admits would never make regular TV “in a million years.”</p>
<p>“I’ve always been that way and it turned out OK. There are others who probably didn’t compromise and are now sleeping in cars,” he said.</p>
<p>It’s an attitude that has colored most of his career.</p>
<p>“I think sometimes I get labeled ‘controversial comedian.’ Well, what they mean is ‘honest comedian,'” he said.</p>
<p>“Every stand-up I’ve done, every series I have done, there have been 10 different people complaining. Well, thousands of people. Everyone thinks their complaint is the worst thing,” he said.</p>
<p>Instead, “everything is up for grabs” in his material, he says proudly, even jokes about AIDS and the Holocaust.</p>
<p>“I have always said there’s never a subject that you shouldn’t talk about or joke about. It just depends what the joke is,” he said.</p>
<p>“And people get offended when they mistake the subject of the joke with the actual target.”

<h3 id="after-life-season-2-review-ricky-gervais-most-moving-work-to-date">After Life season 2 review: Ricky Gervais&rsquo; most moving work to date</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/logo-nme@64w.png" alt="img">
Those who bristle at Ricky Gervais’ curse-laden brand of comedy might well turn off After Life season two in the first 10 minutes, when no less than three C-bombs have been dropped by an elderly woman.</p>
<p>The acid-tongued OAP is being interviewed on her 100th birthday by Tony – Gervais’ grief-stricken small town reporter – and she has given up on living a long time ago. It’s a bleak, darkly funny sentiment shared between subject and journalist, the latter having lost his wife and their idyllic marriage to cancer in the recent past.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The first season of After Life dealt with Tony’s grief in stark, uncompromising detail, from his frank and open contemplations of suicide to quieter, more tender moments of growth and a genuine desire to be a better person. The series was still awash with Gervais’ signature gut-punch insults and an abundance of swearing – a school bully is labelled a “tubby little ginger c***” early in the show – but its vulnerable underbelly and earnest sentiment hit big with fans, and made After Life the second most-watched title on Netflix in 2019.</p>
<p>For round two, Gervais doesn’t stray far from this crowd-pleasing formula, ensuring that the glacial pace of Tambury (the show’s single setting) keeps ticking along while Tony battles to get from one day to the next, the memory of Lisa (Kerry Godliman) still heavy on his mind. Rather than expanding the world of the show, he draws his central band of misfits further into it, to varying levels of success. A budding relationship between sex worker Daphne (Roisin Conaty) and Pat the postman (Joe Wilkinson) is a charming development, but Paul Kaye’s toxic psychiatrist serves as little more than a potty-mouthed pantomime villain, who holds no real relevance to the story.</p>
<p>A consistent delight and Tony’s most reliable source of support, Penelope Wilton is again a series highlight as widower Anne, matching Gervais’ sometimes disarmingly emotional performance as a solid, solemn presence. It’s in their shared scenes that we see the full capability of Gervais as a sophisticated non-comedic writer. There are holes to be picked in After Life, but there’s no denying Gervais’ understanding of grief and its ability to whittle a person’s quality of life down to a booze-soaked, self-loathing stump.</p>
<p>It’s an extraordinary feat to capture an audience this big with a show that doesn’t promise any notion of a happy ending. Maybe there’s some level of catharsis in watching a man with seemingly nothing left to lose stomping around doing what he likes. More understandable perhaps is that After Life is the best example of Gervais’ ability to find beauty in the banal without glossing over life’s more depressing moments. His body of work post-The Office has always attempted this to some degree, but After Life seems to bottle exactly what Gervais set out to do. It’s some of his most moving work to date, and if you can stomach the occasional C-bomb, his most rewarding.</p>
<p>‘After Life’ season two arrives on Netflix on April 24
