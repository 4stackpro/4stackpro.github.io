<p>With his antagonistic tone toward minorities and his overt appeals to xenophobia, Trump proved that theory wrong—for one election. The combination of soaring intensity among white working-class conservatives and diminished turnout among black voters in big cities was just enough to nudge the GOP nominee across the finish line by a combined 77,744 votes in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, the entirety of his margin in the Electoral College. That blueprint remains untouched. The president’s hopes for reelection rest on overwhelming support from whites and a lack of mobilization among minorities. It happened once; it could happen again.</p>
<p>Yet even if it does, the problems diagnosed in the GOP “autopsy” of 2013, namely the party’s failure to connect with minority voters, remain. In fact, they multiply by the day. Arizona and Texas and Georgia keep getting a little less white and a little more competitive. College-educated voters are abandoning the GOP at a record clip. Suburban women, alienated by views of sexism and xenophobia in Trump’s party, are mobilized in ways never before seen. And now, on top of all that, Republicans have to defuse another demographic time bomb: An unprecedented number of white voters are gaining awareness of racial injustice not merely as a cultural or economic issue but as a political one.</p>
<p>“Do white Americans feel the same pressure that black and brown families do? Do white families fear their kids will be pulled over for no reason other than the color of their skin? No. So, they’ll never relate in exactly the same way,” said Karl Rove, the GOP savant who directed George W. Bush’s winning campaigns. “But I do think they relate a lot more than they did 10 or 20 years ago. And I do think that changes the party, to some degree, moving forward.</p>
<p>“There will always be some hard asses on the Republican side,” Rove added. “But the days of ‘lock ‘em up and throw away the key’ are long gone. It’s just no longer sufficient.”</p>
<p>“Tonight I turned on the news and am heartbroken,” Nikki Haley tweeted on May 30, five days after Floyd’s killing and four days into the intensifying demonstrations. “It’s important to understand that the death of George Floyd was personal and painful for many. In order to heal, it needs to be personal and painful for everyone.”</p>
<p>The sentiment was not at first glance controversial. Here was a popular Republican, arguing, in the biblical tradition of loving one’s neighbor as thyself, that real progress depends on the unafflicted feeling afflicted. It was a benign cry for empathy and understanding.</p>
<p>But that’s not what everybody heard.</p>
<p>“Wait a second,” frowned Fox News host Tucker Carlson, after reading Haley’s tweet aloud on his June 1 prime-time show. “You may be wondering: How am I ‘personally responsible’ for the behavior of a Minneapolis police officer? I’ve never even been to Minneapolis, you may think to yourself. And why is some politician telling me I&rsquo;m required to be upset about it?”</p>
<p>Carlson shook his head. “Those are all good questions. Nikki Haley did not answer those questions. Explaining is not her strong suit; that would require thinking. What Nikki Haley does best is moral blackmail.”</p>
<p>This was not Carlson merely settling some personal vendetta with Haley. The Fox News fire-breather also savaged other “so-called conservative leaders” during that same monologue, denouncing Vice President Mike Pence and former presidential candidate Carly Fiorina, among others, for their public remarks over the weekend. Their crime? Acknowledging the continuing scourge of racism in America.</p>

<p>The clip of Carlson rebuking Haley rocketed around the GOP universe. By Tuesday morning, it was the subject of obsession inside the smaller galaxy of those Republicans preparing for a run at the presidency in 2024. For some, it was reassuring, a sign that Fox News wouldn’t get wobbly even if some elements of the right did; for others, it was a shot across the bow, a clear warning that even the most casual questioning of conservative law-and-order dogma would be punished.</p>
<p>This represented a rare break from the crisis-of-the-moment politics. For once, this was not about the president; it was an opportunity to peer into the future, to imagine the contours of the post-Trump GOP. Win or lose, the race to take over the Republican Party will begin in earnest on November 4. Anyone hoping to do more than supplant Trump as the party’s leader—anyone hoping to win the White House—will have to thread the narrowest of needles, creating a broader, more diverse coalition without alienating the core remnant of white MAGA loyalists.</p>
<p>Which is what made Carlson’s commentary so striking. If he was willing to thump Haley over her call for racial solidarity, how would he and other right-wing influencers respond to a Republican presidential candidate who acknowledged institutional injustices? Who called for structural reforms to policing? Addressed the concept of white privilege? Apologized for the “original sin” of slavery that many whites insist was long ago atoned for?</p>
<p>Some of those Republicans have no intention of finding out.</p>
<p>“Too often, I think, when there’s an officer-involved death, the media and political players can be too quick to leap to conclusions … and immediately blame the police officer and immediately vilify law enforcement,” Texas Senator Ted Cruz told me last week. Floyd’s case, he argued, was unique because of the clear-cut video: “Everyone agrees what happened to George Floyd was horrific and wrong. Because of that, thousands exercised their First Amendment rights to speak out and protest not just the injustice visited upon George Floyd but also to call for”—Cruz paused six seconds—“improved protections of everyone’s rights.”</p>
<p>The pause, the language—everyone’s rights—was indicative of Cruz’s wariness. Despite being a Hispanic man who represents a majority-minority state, the senator has built his reputation as a tough-talking Texan, someone who wraps himself in the flag and rarely gives a rhetorical inch. Sure enough, he added a minute later, “For many elected Democrats, the words ‘institutional racism’ are simply code words for demonizing law enforcement, for blaming every cop and thinking that they’re all racists.” He then proceeded to recall how Republicans had freed the slaves and argue that his party has nothing to apologize for.</p>
<p>This is one view, one strategic position, maybe even one pole within the GOP moving forward. Somewhere near the other pole is Will Hurd.</p>
<p>Rep. Will Hurd. | Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images</p>
<p>Hurd is also from Texas; he is also a nonwhite Republican. But the similarities end there. Unlike Cruz, who has relied heavily on white voters and subscribes to a base-dependent theory of politics, Hurd has won three terms in a fiercely competitive majority-minority district by rising above partisan and cultural ruptures. As the son of a black man who had to endure redlining and brutal harassment in South Texas—and as a former intelligence officer with deep ties to law enforcement—Hurd has the credibility to speak candidly about both worlds. It’s a unique capacity the retiring congressman will draw upon—if, as expected, he runs for president in 2024.</p>
<p>“Everybody wants to be ‘tough on crime.’ Everybody wants to talk about ‘law and order.’ But what does that even mean?” Hurd said. “What ‘law and order’ needs to mean is you’re pissed that a black dude got killed in police custody and you’re pissed that people are shooting at black cops. These are not mutually exclusive emotions. It cannot be an either-or conversation anymore.”</p>
<p>Hurd added, “The whole reason I’m a Republican is because I believe in empowering people, not empowering the government. So, why wouldn’t we want to make sure that people have equal opportunity—and that the government isn’t interfering with that opportunity?”</p>
<p>There is indeed a continuum within the post-Trump Republican Party, at least rhetorically, with the likes of Cotton and Cruz at one end, Haley and Hurd at the other, and countless other contenders from Florida Senator Marco Rubio to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan drifting somewhere in between. We have some rough approximation of who believes what and how candidly they will articulate it. What we don’t know is how many more police killings of black men will occur between now and 2024—and how many it will take to provoke a real debate inside the Republican Party.</p>
<p>“A lot of the terms can be fraught and scary and confusing, and people want to import particular political prognoses—systemic or institutional or whatever,” said Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse, another potential 2024 contender. “I mean, obviously there&rsquo;s lots of structural stuff that’s deep in America’s centurieslong original sin. It’s real, and it’s not gone. So, I’m glad that more people in my party, and my end of the ideological spectrum, are taking this stuff a lot more seriously.”</p>
<p>The rate at which the Republican Party takes seriously the notion of widespread racial injustice likely depends on how long Donald Trump occupies the White House. And that, in turn, depends on whether black voters are galvanized by Joe Biden—author of the crime bill and his share of racial gaffes—in a way they weren’t by Hillary Clinton four years ago.</p>
<p>Then again, it’s not clear that 2020 will be decided by which party does more to energize its base. Rather, it might be a question of which party does less to alienate the middle. On 16th Street, just two blocks north of the White House, a mural was painted Friday to read: “BLACK LIVES MATTER.” By Saturday, in response to a new rallying cry on the progressive left, there was an additional message: “DEFUND THE POLICE.”</p>

<p>Right on cue, at 9:09 a.m. Sunday, the president of the United States tweeted: “Sleepy Joe Biden and the Radical Left Democrats want to ‘DEFUND THE POLICE.’ I want great and well paid LAW ENFORCEMENT. I want LAW &amp; ORDER!”

<p><img src="https://static.politico.com/95/83/74bf321e4a28acbf4fc68679cd5e/200521-trump-tailgate-ap-773.jpg" alt="img">
But there is no consistency to these efforts. Indeed, even as Trump stuck predominantly to the script on Thursday, portraying himself as the fireman who had ventured into a state smoldering with rage and anxiety, the scent of kerosene followed close behind. Just 24 hours before he arrived in Michigan, the president launched a dangerous disinformation campaign, accusing the secretary of state of going “rogue” by illegally sending absentee ballots to every Michigan voter. He threatened to block funding to Michigan—a state beleaguered by multiple converging disasters, including one that was unfolding just as the tweet was sent—“if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path!”</p>
<p>To be clear, none of this is accurate. Voters were sent applications to vote absentee, a practice consistent with a newly adopted Michigan law (a law that exists in other states, red and blue alike). The Michigan GOP has itself sent out applications. There is nothing sordid or illegitimate going on; both parties here understand the rules of the game and are attempting to master them before November.</p>
<p>But Trump is playing his own game. Ever in need of a foil—be it Barack Obama’s birth certificate, John McCain, Megyn Kelly, Low Energy Jeb, Lyin’ Ted, Little Marco, Crooked Hillary, the Deep State, Never Trumpers, Sleepy Joe, Obamagate, or combinations thereof—the president has set his sights on the institution of the ballot box. The benefit is twofold: Trump can simultaneously incite the distress of his base to juice enthusiasm come November while establishing a built-in justification should he lose.</p>
<p>The effects are already manifest. In conversation after conversation with voters here Thursday, Trump supporters repeatedly—and completely unsolicited—say Democrats are attempting to steal the election from the president.</p>
<p>“I lived in Chicago for six years. We know how Mayor Daley stuffed the ballot box for JFK against Nixon.” says Keith Brudder, a 72-year-old landscape contractor from the nearby town of Willis. “That’s what the Democrats in charge here want to do, with this mail-in voting. There’s just no way to have accountability for those ballots like you do when people come to the voting booth.”</p>
<p>“In Wayne County alone, more than a million people who weren’t registered to vote in 2018 got to vote anyway, and that’s how Whitmer and these Democrats got elected,” says Matthew Shepard, a retired career military man who drove his hulking, orange paramilitary-style truck 90 minutes south from Shiawassee County to cheer on the president. (He offered no documentation for those statistics.) “That’s the only way Trump loses this election—this mail voting scam.”

<p>DRIVING THE DAY</p>
<p>GOOD SATURDAY morning. AT 11:23 P.M. Friday night, President DONALD TRUMP announced he would delay his Tulsa, Okla., rally, which was scheduled on Juneteenth.</p>
<p>&ndash; THE PRESIDENT: “We had previously scheduled our #MAGA Rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, for June 19th – a big deal. Unfortunately, however, this would fall on the Juneteenth Holiday. Many of my African American friends and supporters have reached out to suggest that we consider changing the date out of respect for this Holiday, and in observance of this important occasion and all that it represents. I have therefore decided to move our rally to Saturday, June 20th, in order to honor their requests. We have already had ticket requests in excess of 200,000 people. I look forward to seeing everyone in Oklahoma!”`</p>
<p>THE PRESIDENT left Bedminster this morning at 9:21 a.m. for West Point’s graduation. He will speak around 10:25 a.m. He is planning to leave West Point for Bedminster around 12:50 p.m., and will be back by 1:25 p.m.</p>
<p>AT 5:30 p.m., he will host a “roundtable with supporters.” WSJ’S CATHERINE LUCEY, today’s pooler: “Later today the president will hold a fundraiser at his Bedminster golf club. That will be closed press. An RNC official says approximately 15 attendees are expected, and the event is set to raise $3 million for ‘Trump Victory, a joint fundraising committee benefiting the Trump campaign, RNC, and 22 state parties.’”</p>
<p>CNN’S DJ JUDD posted a panoramic view of The Plain, where the graduation will take place. The photo &hellip; Trump exiting Marine One, via CBS&rsquo;s Mark Knoller</p>

<p>“But he didn’t dwell on public health concerns. The coronavirus, ‘or whatever you want to call it,’ as he told the crowd, is now just another throw-away line in Trump’s political patter, meant to jab a foreign adversary and energize his base. Nearly six weeks after Trump stopped daily televised briefings at the White House that drew sharp criticism for his false claims and dangerous advice &ndash; such as injecting household disinfectant to kill the virus &ndash; he has a new tactic: ignoring the threat.”</p>

Congress goes back and forth too.” TRUMP: “It could be local level. And in some cases it will be local level. But I think we can certainly make recommendations and they can be very strong recommendations.”</p>
<p>AP’S BILL BARROW and JULIE PACE: “Biden&rsquo;s VP list narrows: Warren, Harris, Susan Rice, others”: “Democrats with knowledge of the process said Biden’s search committee has narrowed the choices to as few as six serious contenders after initial interviews. Those still in contention include Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California, as well as Susan Rice, who served as President Barack Obama’s national security adviser. …</p>
<p>“The campaign’s short list includes several black women, including Harris and Rice. Advisers have also looked closely at Florida Rep. Val Demings and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, both of whom are black, and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Latina.”</p>
<p>&ndash; NYT’S JONATHAN MARTIN and ALEX BURNS: “Among that group are two contenders who have recently grown in prominence, Representative Val Demings of Florida and Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta. One well-known candidate, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, has lost her perch as a front-runner. And some lower-profile candidates, like Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, are advancing steadily in the search process.</p>
<p>“Ms. Harris and Ms. Warren have been interviewed at length by Mr. Biden’s team, as has Ms. Baldwin, who was the first openly gay candidate ever elected to the Senate.</p>
<p>“Two women with distinctive national-defense credentials have also been interviewed and asked for documents: Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, an Iraq war combat veteran who is Asian-American, and Susan Rice, the former national security adviser to President Barack Obama and the first black woman to serve as ambassador to the United Nations.”</p>

<p>AMY MCGRATH IN TROUBLE? … JAMES ARKIN and BURGESS EVERETT: “Insurgent threatens to derail McGrath-McConnell showdown in Kentucky”: “Amy McGrath is a national Democratic icon for her bid to take out Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate leader and reviled figure on the left, raising tens of millions of dollars to fuel her campaign.</p>
<p>“But McConnell isn&rsquo;t the opponent McGrath, a former fight pilot, is sweating most right now. Instead, it&rsquo;s her rival in the June 23 Democratic primary: Charles Booker, a state lawmaker who was virtually ignored for months but now has all the momentum in the closing days of the election. …</p>
<p>“‘I don&rsquo;t really know what position Amy McGrath takes because she goes back and forth on everything depending on what consultants seem to say,’ Booker said in an interview. ‘I know that Kentuckians can smell BS from miles away.’ ‘I’m not, as Mr. Booker claims, &lsquo;a pro-Trump Democrat.&rsquo; I’m pro-Kentucky and pro-America,’ McGrath said, refuting her top opponent in a POLITICO interview after months of keeping her fire trained on McConnell. …</p>
<p>“McConnell is reveling in a suddenly competitive primary back home. After all, six years ago it was he who faced a credible intraparty challenge from Matt Bevin, the now-former governor. ‘It’s been an interesting primary all of a sudden. And honestly, I don’t know what to make of it,’ McConnell said in a brief interview.”</p>
<p>&ndash; THE NYT endorsed JAMAAL BOWMAN over REP. ELIOT ENGEL: “Mr. Bowman says he wants to see the United States adopt a kind of Marshall Plan for climate change, jobs, housing and education. ‘We need political imagination,’ he said. In a district that needs new energy, Mr. Bowman will bring it.</p>
<p>IN MEMORIAM &ndash; “William S. Sessions, FBI director who battled agency’s old guard, dies at 90,” by WaPo’s Paul Valentine: “William S. Sessions, the scrupulously straight-arrow director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 1987 to 1993 who faced down the agency’s old-boy network to start bringing in more black, Hispanic and female agents, only to be fired for petty financial misconduct, died June 12 at his son’s home in San Antonio. …</p>
<p>“Mr. Sessions bitterly fought a Justice Department report that accused him of abusing the perks of his job … He refused to resign and ultimately was dismissed by President Bill Clinton in July 1993. … [T]he austere, teetotaling Sessions made his mark as a strict but principled federal prosecutor and then judge in West Texas before President Ronald Reagan tapped him for the FBI post.”</p>

POLITICO Playbook: Democrats grapple with ‘Defund the Police’ Presented by</p>
<p>Many elected Democrats will get asked over the next few days and weeks whether they support defunding the police. It will prove to be a tricky question for some. | Stephen Maturen/Getty Images</p>
<p>DRIVING THE DAY</p>
<p>GEORGE FLOYD’S DEATH has rapidly shifted the political conversation on the left to considering just how far municipalities and governments might go to reshape, reimagine, reform and reconstruct police departments.</p>
<p>THE MINNEAPOLIS CITY COUNCIL on Sunday said it had a veto-proof majority to dismantle its police department. In Albany, the New York state House and Senate are expected to repeal the “50-a law” that allowed departments to shield police disciplinary records from public view. ON 16TH STREET NW, activists restylized the “Black Lives Matter” mural to include the phrase “Defund the Police.”</p>
<p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP is going to wake up this morning to the N.Y. POST carrying this headline: “After nearly 300 officers are wounded keeping the peace … BLAS BETRAYS … Mayor vows to cut NYPD budget”</p>
<p>DISBANDING IS DIFFERENT than defunding, which is different than reshaping and reforming. And some cities, such as Camden, N.J., have seen success through radically overhauling their police departments. In other words, there is a lot of room for nuance here.</p>
<p>SO FAR, prominent Democrats have dodged when asked about defunding. D.C. Mayor MURIEL BOWSER said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday that she hadn’t had the opportunity to review the mural painted in the middle of downtown Washington, so she couldn’t say anything about it. Last week, Speaker NANCY PELOSI declined to weigh in on the movement, citing the imminent release of a Democratic leadership-sponsored police reform bill.</p>
<p>THAT BILL will be released in the Capitol at a news conference at 10:30 a.m. The legislation doesn’t include a provision to drain funding from police departments. But it would overhaul the statutes that govern law enforcement.</p>
<p>MOST ELECTED DEMOCRATS will get asked over the next few days and weeks whether they support defunding the police. It will prove to be a tricky question for some: either get crosswise with middle-of-the-road voters, who probably &ndash; just a gut feeling! &ndash; won’t support taking away money from police, or get on the wrong side of the base.</p>
<p>EITHER WAY, REPUBLICANS, who are fighting to keep their Senate majority and win back the House, will hang the defund movement around Democrats’ necks. Part of their strategy is to paint all elected Dems as extreme. “House Democrats have gone so extreme with their ‘abolish culture’ that they’re one step away from wanting to outlaw fire departments,” said CHRIS PACK, a spokesman for the NRCC. “This is insanity and not what Democrats ran on two years ago.”</p>
<p>TIM ALBERTA: “Is This the Last Stand of the ‘Law and Order’ Republicans?”: “It’s a loaded phrase, one that politicians in both parties have invoked for decades — with great success — to project a certain virility to the electorate. It has recently taken on even harsher connotations in the context of Trump’s Twitter usage (10 times in just the last week) and the accompanying sentiments (threats of unleashing ‘vicious dogs’ on rioters, and promises of, ‘when the looting starts, the shooting starts.’)</p>
<p>“But it has long carried a cautionary subtext: Don’t dare challenge the integrity of a justice system predicated on punishing wrongdoers, the harsher the better. Over time, this has meant fewer rehabilitative doors opened and more retributive cells slammed shut. It has meant refusing to acknowledge that anything is fundamentally amiss with the system itself; that disparities and discrimination are not the same thing, that isolated incidents of police misconduct are just that, no matter their regularity or similarities.”</p>

<p>TOP TALKER … NYT … BEN SMITH’S MEDIA EQUATION COLUMN: “Inside the Revolts Erupting in America’s Big Newsrooms”: “Now, as America is wrestling with the surging of a moment that began in August 2014, its biggest newsrooms are trying to find common ground between a tradition that aims to persuade the widest possible audience that its reporting is neutral and journalists who believe that fairness on issues from race to Donald Trump requires clear moral calls. …</p>
<p>“The conflict exploded in recent days into public protests at The New York Times, ending in the resignation of its top Opinion editor on Sunday; The Philadelphia Inquirer, whose executive editor resigned on Saturday over the headline ‘Buildings Matter, Too’ and the ensuing anger from his staff; and The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. And it has been the subject of quiet agony at The Washington Post, which [Wes] Lowery left earlier this year, months after the executive editor, Martin Baron, threatened to fire him for expressing his views on Twitter about race, journalism and other subjects.” NYT … NYT release on major staff changes</p>

<p>SOME GOOD NEWS &ndash; “With recovery of last case, New Zealand has eradicated virus,” by AP’s Nick Perry in Wellington: “New Zealand appears to have completely eradicated the coronavirus — at least for now — after health officials said Monday the last known infected person had recovered.</p>
<p>“The announcement was greeted with joy around the country and means the nation of 5 million people will be among the first to welcome throngs of fans back into sports stadiums, embrace crowded concerts and remove seating restrictions from flights. …</p>
<p>“More cases are likely to be imported as people enter the country. For now, the border remains shut to all but citizens and residents, with some limited exceptions. Everybody who does enter has to go into quarantine. Ardern announced that the Cabinet had agreed to remove almost all remaining virus restrictions from midnight, with the exception of the border strictures.”</p>
<p>BURGESS EVERETT and ANDREW DESIDERIO: “The Senate&rsquo;s record-breaking gridlock under Trump”: “President Donald Trump is facing more delays to his nominees than any previous president. And if Joe Biden beats him, the former vice president might get it even worse.</p>
<p>“The Senate’s confirmation process is nearly broken, and the numbers show it’s a race to the bottom. George W. Bush faced the most procedural hurdles and filibusters to his nominees until Barack Obama was elected and faced historic blockades. Then Trump came along and became the record holder in just part of a term, according to a POLITICO analysis of Senate votes.</p>
<p>“It’s the latest glaring sign of Senate dysfunction, showing just how difficult it has become to staff up an administration. And it’s hard to imagine that Republicans will go easy on Biden if he wins, even as both parties decry the trend.” POLITICO</p>
<p>ACCOUNTABILITY? NAH … BETSY WOODRUFF SWAN and ANDREW DESIDERIO: “Top aide: Senate chairman drops effort to secure Pompeo testimony”: “In a conference call with aides for Republican [Senate Foreign Affairs] committee members on Friday morning, the staff director for the chairman, Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho), said he was dropping his monthslong push for Pompeo to appear before senators for a hearing on the State Department’s budget.</p>

Val Demings.</p>
<p>“Both have been tapped by the Biden campaign to act as leading surrogates amid the unrest and have seen their national media exposure intensify. The national demand for Bottoms has been so high in the wake of national protests, she’s adding staff to handle the crush of interest.</p>
<p>“Bottoms is being vetted as a Biden running mate, two sources with knowledge of the discussions confirm to POLITICO. Demings, a former Orlando police chief, has previously confirmed she’s being vetted.” POLITICO</p>

<p>DOES ANYONE THINK THIS BOOK WILL SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY? … WAPO: “John Bolton plans to publish a tell-all about his time in the White House in late June,” by Josh Dawsey and Tom Hamburger: “The White House has not formally signed off on the tome, and officials in the Trump administration have delayed the book for months due to a classification review process led by the National Security Council. … Bolton is planning to publish even if the White House does not give publication approval, people familiar with his thinking say, and believes he has removed all classified material.”</p>

<p>“It has also put renewed focus on the assortment of online state voter registration systems, which were among the chief targets of Russian hackers in 2016. Their security is central to ensuring that, come November, voters actually receive their mail-in ballots or can gain access to online voting.” NYT</p>

<p>ACROSS THE POND &ndash; “Thousands protest racism in Brussels as U.S. movement sweeps Europe,” by Barbara Moens: “Thousands gathered in Brussels on Sunday for a Black Lives Matter protest that was largely peaceful but ended with some protesters looting and clashing with police, resulting in at least 150 arrests.</p>
<p>“The protest was the latest in a string of demonstrations across Europe inspired by the U.S. movement against racism and police violence. According to the Brussels police, up to 10,000 people were present at Brussels&rsquo; Place Poelaert, outside the city’s Palace of Justice court. The demonstration was not officially permitted, but was ‘tolerated’ by the city of Brussels, a spokesperson for the mayor said beforehand. Prime Minister Sophie Wilmès last week expressed concerns about the demonstration because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>“The vast majority of participants were wearing masks covering their mouths, but because of the massive turnout, social distancing was nearly impossible. Organizers had predicted beforehand that the turnout would be half as much as it was.” POLITICO</p>

<p>JOSH GERSTEIN: “Feds press criminal case against Flynn partner”: “The Justice Department is pressing forward with its criminal case against a former business partner of Michael Flynn, despite Attorney General William Barr’s controversial decision to seek to abandon the prosecution of the former national security adviser to President Donald Trump. Prosecutors seeking to revive the convictions of Flynn’s former colleague, Bijan Rafiekian, filed a brief with a federal appeals court Sunday.</p>
<p>“The filing makes several mentions of Flynn’s integral role in the work that led to the two foreign-agent-related felony charges against Rafiekian and maintains the government’s position that Flynn was a co-conspirator in his business partner’s crimes — a curious stance as the government seeks to drop the criminal case it brought against Flynn more than two years ago.” POLITICO</p>
<p>SPORTS BACKSTORY &ndash; “Apologies, Protests and Rebellion: Inside the NFL’s 72-Hour Awakening,” by WSJ’s Andrew Deaton: “Roger Goodell needed to say something. The topic that once threatened the NFL’s multibillion-dollar empire—player protests against police brutality during the national anthem—was back. And the commissioner needed to stop the league from tearing itself apart again in the wake of the killing of George Floyd.</p>
<p>“Over 72 supercharged hours late last week, superstar players sniped at each other publicly and put unprecedented pressure on the league to fight racism and endorse their ability to protest against it. &hellip;</p>
<p>“By Friday afternoon, Goodell was scrambling to respond. He held an emotional town hall meeting with employees and then issued his own blockbuster: a mea culpa video in which he said ‘we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier’ and endorsed players’ right to protest peacefully.” WSJ</p>
<p>&ndash; @realDonaldTrump, 11:54 p.m. on Sunday: “Could it be even remotely possible that in Roger Goodell’s rather interesting statement of peace and reconciliation, he was intimating that it would now be O.K. for the players to KNEEL, or not to stand, for the National Anthem, thereby disrespecting our Country &amp; our Flag?”</p>

Sustainability amid social unrest</p>
<p>THE BIG IDEA</p>
<p>Many large companies were quick to support nationwide protests over systemic racism and George Floyd’s death. | M. Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO</p>
<p>WHEN WILL CORPORATE AMERICA LOOK LIKE AMERICA? Big companies were quick to decry systemic racism and support protests following the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota. The sheer volume of statements and financial pledges is evidence that businesses cannot ignore racial inequality as their executives tout commitments to corporate responsibility. The lack of diversity that is striking in boardrooms and C-suites shows corporate America has its work cut out.</p>
<p>Take the Business Roundtable, a group of CEOs pushing companies to redefine their purpose around sustainability goals, including diversity and inclusion. On Friday, the group tapped seven of its board members to form a committee on “racial equality and justice solutions,” but critics pointed out that there are no specific benchmarks or funding. The committee is led by two black and five white executives from Eaton, Vista Equity Partners, AT&amp;T, Marriott International, General Motors, JPMorgan Chase and Johnson &amp; Johnson. Most of these companies have no more than two people of color on their boards.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“I would call it window dressing. We’re not seeing real change on the ground,” says CB Bhattacharya, a professor at University of Pittsburgh’s Katz Graduate School of Business and author of a book on sustainable business practices. “There’s no intent, year after year, to publish achievements against goals so people can judge the Roundtable for what it is.”</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Business Roundtable said the group is &ldquo;committed to taking thoughtful action on issues of racial injustice,&rdquo; which includes &ldquo;CEOs listening to their employees, customers and members of the communities they operate in, with the goal of strengthening unity and justice.&rdquo; The spokeswoman also noted that 19 of the group&rsquo;s more than 180 CEOs are people of color, while another 19 are women (just one of whom is nonwhite).</p>
<p>Linda Akutagawa, chair of the Alliance for Board Diversity, which reports on the demographics of corporate boards, says she is not surprised by “the irony and the reality” that the majority of the Roundtable’s racial equality committee is white. “In some ways, this is a conversation among their peers,” and “when white men start putting their capital behind something, that’s when you start to see things happen,” she adds.</p>
<p>Senior executives need to make it a priority to recruit and promote employees of various races and ethnicities, and to treat those employees as more than tokens, Akutagawa says. “How many are really saying, ’I&rsquo;m bringing you along with me?’”</p>
<p>Akutagawa also notes that between 2016 and 2018, Latina women lost board seats on Fortune 100 companies after growing in the preceding years, while black women gained seats. “As I think about it, that may be a reflection of the musical chairs game that is played within boards.”</p>
<p>WHERE ARE THE REGULATORS? Companies aren&rsquo;t required to publicly report the demographics of their C-suites and boards, so most simply don&rsquo;t. Activist shareholders have pushed for more transparency with little luck, and few legislative efforts have succeeded. One exception is in Illinois, where Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, in August signed a bill that requires public and foreign companies in the state to report on the gender, race and ethnicity of their boards.</p>
<p>In Congress, House Financial Services Chair Maxine Waters — also a Democrat and the first woman and the first African American to hold the committee gavel — has been leading a push for businesses to report. She&rsquo;s long used her office to name and shame companies, and in 2019 established a subcommittee on diversity and inclusion.</p>
<p>After the coronavirus outbreak, Waters pushed for provisions in the CARES Act designed to minimize the pandemic&rsquo;s impact on women- and minority-owned businesses. One provision would have required companies to publicly report their board diversity and their spending with diverse asset managers. The language didn&rsquo;t make the final bill.</p>
<p>DATA DIVE</p>
<p>People of Asian or Indian descent were the best-represented members of a minority group among CEOs of Fortune 500 or S&amp;P 500 companies, although they represent a smaller share of the U.S. population than black or Hispanic people.</p>

<p>IDEAS LAB</p>
<p>THE ESG CRAZE LACKS DIVERSITY DATA — Sustainability-minded investors are focused on the promises companies make to hire more diverse employees or reduce emissions, but they often have little data about the results of those pledges. George Serafeim, a Harvard Business School professor who studies sustainable investing, is trying to change that.</p>
<p>Through the Impact-Weighted Account Project, Serafeim and his team are trying to put a dollar value on how companies perform on their environmental, social and governance goals, which can be included in their annual financial reports. The goal is to create a new accounting methodology that allows investors to compare the benefits to broader society, not just individual companies’ financial returns. Serafeim hopes ratings agencies and data providers will integrate the methods his team is developing in their own ESG products.</p>
<p>When it comes to measuring diversity and inclusion, Serafeim says there are many data gaps, particularly on the opportunities companies offer minorities. That means ESG investors are analyzing a company’s intentions, and “we know intentions don’t always translate into outcomes,” he says. This is because the SEC does not require companies to report diversity and inclusion information. Individual investors can request it, however, or make demands.</p>
<p>Last year, for instance, the New York City Comptroller, who oversees city pension funds holding $153 billion in assets, launched an initiative pressuring companies to consider women and people of color in their searches for board members and CEOs. So far, 13 have adopted the policy, including Hilton Worldwide and Expedia. Warren Buffet opposed the proposal at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting this month, but said he supports the overall goal.</p>
<p>But Serafeim says the SEC should just require companies to report the information so it is uniform across industries. “We need regulators to step in and propose minimum standards that include diversity and inclusion. This would be a huge win-win; society will benefit from that,” he says, citing research showing that diverse teams are more innovative and often make better business decisions.</p>
<p>THE LONG GAME FORUM</p>
<p>POLITICO and The Long Game strive to elevate diverse voices. Our forum of sustainability experts isn’t inclusive enough. Please tell us who is doing important work in the business sector, at the state and local level, or in the nonprofit world so our reporting can reflect broader perspectives.</p>
<p>This week we asked the forum what, if anything, their organizations are doing to promote racial diversity in their ranks, and whether the protests will prompt any changes? (Responses were edited for length and clarity.)</p>
<p>“We made several commitments that go above and beyond our other long-standing programs … tripling the number of full-time people devoted to accelerating Diversity &amp; Inclusion; doubling our financial investments in D&amp;I initiatives and [Employee Resource Groups]; expanding existing inclusion training globally to address bias and microaggressions; and contributing $1 million via the S&amp;P Global Foundation to nonprofit organizations that support equity and racial justice,” says Doug Peterson, president and CEO of S&amp;P Global. “The first task I set for myself, and one that I hope will resonate with our colleagues trying to better understand how they can help, is to listen. We should not rush to fill an uncomfortable void with a statement. Instead we should first take the time to listen and then take action.”</p>
<p>“We have a comprehensive Inclusion and Diversity strategy , with very specific metrics and goals within our 2030 sustainability goals (throughout the organization, from primary workers to the Board),” says Frank O&rsquo;Brien-Bernini, chief sustainability officer at Owens Corning. “We will accelerate changes already underway, but more because of what happened to George Floyd, and what keeps happening to people of color, than because of the protests.”</p>
<p>“We are enhancing the amount of pulse surveying we do across the organization to ensure we are listening to and hearing colleagues,” says Michael D&rsquo;Ambrose, chief human resources officer at ADM. “What we learn from these engagements will set a course for what we must do next.”</p>
<p>“The FedEx Services ‘College Connections’ internship program collaborates with the diversity and inclusion team to ensure the pipeline of students coming into FedEx is as diverse as possible,” says Mitch Jackson, staff vice president of environmental affairs and chief sustainability officer at FedEx. He said the company holds recruiting events at 16 historically black colleges and institutions with many Hispanic students.</p>
<p>“We’ve challenged our Diversity and Inclusion Council, as well as our associates, to put forth suggestions we can put into action to ensure our associates, especially our associates of color, feel safe, valued and equal,” says Kathryn Danko, chief diversity officer at Perdue Farms.</p>
<p>PUBLIC OPINION — Morning Consult recently asked how various responses to the recent protests would change the public&rsquo;s view of a company. The poll found people were broadly supportive of moves like additional racial sensitivity training or support for social justice, but responses were divided along racial lines when it came to whether companies should embrace either protesters or the police.</p>
<p>Advocacy</p>
<p>DIVESTMENT’S NEW TARGET — Divestment campaigns have proven a popular tool among activists in recent years, whether that meant asking a university to withdraw investments in fossil fuels or persuading a bank to stop financing private prisons.</p>
<p>Now, that energy is being applied to city budgets amid a growing movement to “defund” police departments. Like the divestment fights that preceded it, the “defund” movement is zeroing in on where big institutions put their budgets. “The kind of activism and tactics that folks took to corporate boards … is what happens every year in cities around the country,” says Kumar Rao, director of justice transformation at the Center for Popular Democracy.</p>
<p>The movement is already showing some signs of success, such as a proposal in Minneapolis to “dismantle” the city’s police department and build a new public safety apparatus. However, some policymakers are hesitant to embrace such moves; House Democrats’ new police reform bill does not address defunding departments, for example, although it includes several other major overhauls. Joe Biden is backing away from the idea; the presumptive nominee’s campaign said Monday that it endorses reform but Biden “does not believe that police should be defunded.”</p>
<p>Companies that work with police also may face new pressure from activists. For example, Trek Bikes is being asked to stop selling to departments after its logo has been seen in numerous videos of confrontations with demonstrators.</p>

<p>GREEN GROUPS ASSESS THEIR ROLE IN RACIAL UNREST — The historically white environmental movement has tried to broaden its core mission in recent years by focusing more on how climate change disproportionately affects low-income communities and people of color. That expansion is being tested as protests erupt across the nation over police brutality and racial inequality, POLITICO’s Zack Colman, Gavin Bade and Ben Lefebvre report .</p>
<p>“I think there’s been a deafening amount of silence from the traditional environment organizations,” says Tamara Toles O’Laughlin, North America director for the climate-focused group 350.org. “The amount of solidarity that has been shown to date is not enough.”</p>
<p>Many of the largest green groups, including the Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council and Environmental Defense Fund have issued statements supporting the protests. But EDF President Fred Krupp acknowledges that for too long, the movement hasn’t spoken out against the challenges nonwhite communities face, and the EDF will provide “support and solutions” for environmental justice and equity. A spokesperson told The Long Game that the group is evaluating its approach now.</p>
<p>Green groups have had few people of color in leadership roles — a flaw that leaves them hamstrung when racial tensions flare, notes Melissa Martínez, the National Parks Conservation Association’s resource protection manager. She said her association is sorting through how to use its power to “move toward an actively anti-racist movement.”</p>

<h3 id="the-mitt-romney-martyr-myth">&ldquo;The Mitt Romney martyr myth&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z4AdSwklStkuzBaHlVEl0s7DSjY=/0x399:5568x3314/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20025132/1197125660.jpg.jpg" alt="img">
Mitt Romney, the only Republican senator to vote to convict President Trump during his impeachment trial, once again defied his party this Sunday — marching in a Black Lives Matter demonstration and telling reporters that he was doing so to “end brutality.”</p>
<p>His actions displayed the moral decency and leadership that have rarely been seen from Republican officials in the Trump era. Romney’s actions caused one prominent political writer to advance an argument that many conservatives have embraced in the Trump era — that Democratic attacks on Romney during the 2012 presidential campaign are to blame for the GOP’s radicalization and the emergence of Trump.</p>
<p>“It was the left’s (and the media’s) treatment of Romney that numbed the electorate to real, valid concerns about ‘character’ four years later,” writes Tim Alberta, Politico’s chief political correspondent. “The mistreatment of this man, the demonization of him on a personal level by opponents in both parties, will be studied for decades to come.”</p>
<p>On this view, Democrats smeared the kind and decent Romney so brutally — attacking him as a heartless “vulture capitalist” who hated minorities — that Republicans became inured to this kind of argument and convinced there was no advantage to playing nice anymore. Call it the “look what you made me do” theory of How We Got Trump.</p>
<p>“All those stereotypes Democrats fabricated to assail Mitt Romney helped inoculate Trump against similar charges,” Noah Rothman writes in Commentary. “In this sense, the Obamans themselves helped clear the way for Trump.”</p>
<p>The evidence for these claims is vanishingly thin.</p>
<p>About as many Republican voters supported the notion of a Trump presidential run in April 2011 as in the fall of 2015, suggesting that Trump’s very public embrace of birtherism in the early Obama years was hardly a turnoff even before Romney. Republican politicians and conservative elites were generally hostile to Trump early in his primary run; it wasn’t anger over Romney’s treatment that forced them to embrace their new leader, but the will of the party’s voters.</p>
<p>There’s also no reason more broadly to believe that mean campaigns lead to radicalization in this fashion. If they did, then Republican attacks on Barack Obama as a Kenyan socialist Muslim and Hillary Clinton as a felon who did Benghazi would have led Democratic voters to embrace someone like Michael Avenatti, the outspoken anti-Trump lawyer. Instead, they picked Joe Biden.</p>
<p>The “look what you made me do” theory is an effort by the conservative elite to declare themselves innocent: to look out at an America governed by a man who has ignored a pandemic and stoked police violence against peaceful protesters and say, “Republicans are not responsible for this.”</p>
<p>Why the Romney martyr myth matters</p>
<p>It’s certainly the case that Democrats launched aggressive, sometimes over-the-top attacks on Romney. As examples, conservatives cite a Democratic Super PAC ad unfairly blaming him for a woman’s death and then-Vice President Biden telling a racially mixed audience that Romney’s economic policies would “put y’all back in chains.”</p>
<p>But a brief look at campaigns past will tell you that the attacks on Romney were not especially egregious. Political opponents lie about each other, often in despicable ways, but they do it frequently.</p>
<p>Republican members of Congress all but openly accused the Clintons of killing White House attorney Vince Foster. George W. Bush strategist Karl Rove was reportedly responsible for a rumor, spread during the 2000 South Carolina primary, that John McCain had fathered an illegitimate black child. In 2004, a Republican-aligned group called “Swift Boat Veterans for Truth” systematically distorted John Kerry’s record of military service; their lies were so egregious that the term “swift boating” is now synonymous with launching scurrilous campaign attacks. In 2008, vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin accused Barack Obama of “palling around with terrorists who would target their own country.”</p>
<p>In other words, the 2012 Obama campaign’s attacks on Romney were hardly outside the norm.</p>
<p>The more important story of the Romney campaign for understanding Trump is not the way Democrats talked about Romney, but the way Romney talked about himself during that time — when he campaigned not as a moderate but as a “severely conservative” Republican.</p>
<p>This was the campaign where Romney labeled 47 percent of Americans moochers who would vote for Democrats no matter what because they “believe that they are victims” who are “entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it.” This was the campaign where he embraced hardline immigration views, vowing a crackdown on unauthorized immigration that would make migrants’ lives so awful that they would eventually “self-deport.” This was the campaign when he cozied up to birtherism, “joking” that “no one’s ever asked to see my birth certificate” — and the campaign during which he accepted Donald Trump’s endorsement.</p>
<p>Romney wasn’t exactly a bulwark standing in the way of the party’s lurch to the far right. If anything, he helped encourage it.</p>
<p>This is the problem with the “look what you made me do” narrative. It serves to bifurcate Republican history into the pre-Trump and post-Trump eras, as if what happened in 2016 was some kind of anomaly. It serves to indemnify the GOP and conservatism from the Trumpist takeover, when in reality Trump is the logical conclusion of what Republican politicians have been doing for decades.</p>
<p>There’s a familiar story, rigorously documented by political scientists and discussed in Alberta’s book American Carnage, about how the Republican Party became the party of racial resentment. In short, the GOP took advantage of the Democratic embrace of civil rights under Lyndon Johnson to become the party of resentful whites — beginning with what Richard Nixon called “the Southern strategy,” continuing through Ronald Reagan’s attacks on “welfare queens” and George H.W. Bush’s infamous Willie Horton ad, and serving as fuel for the entire Tea Party movement and anti-Obama backlash.</p>
<p>Over time, whites with high levels of prejudice and racial resentment sorted themselves into the GOP, creating a critical mass of voters open to an even more racially aggressive style of politics. Trump is the bill for this particular devil’s bargain coming due: a Republican primary electorate that preferred Trump’s overt racism to the more coded racial appeals of Republicans past.</p>
<p>The GOP elite used racial resentment as part of a winning electoral strategy — setting the stage for a Trumpist takeover of their party.</p>
<p>“Instrumentalized racism did not originate within the right nor within conservatism,” my colleague Jane Coaston writes. “The right decided to embrace it, and has clutched it all the more tightly in response to concerns from political and cultural rivals and allies alike while excusing it as how ‘forgotten Americans talk’ or what ‘real Americans’ really think.”</p>
<p>The real purpose of the Romney martyr myth is to obscure this reality, to whitewash Republican elites’ responsibility for Trump’s political rise and the mess Americans find ourselves in. It both excuses them and justifies them in continuing to wage war on Democrats, their real enemy, rather than recognize that their own movement has set the stage for the crisis. The liberals must always be wrong, the conservatives must always be innocent.</p>
<p>It’s much easier for them to be anti-Democrat — that is, anti-anti-Trump — than to try to look harder at what they themselves have done wrong. “Personal responsibility” is apparently great when you’re talking about black people, but it goes out the window when it comes to conservatives.</p>
