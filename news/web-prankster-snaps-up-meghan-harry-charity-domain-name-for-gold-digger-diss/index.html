<h3 id="meghan-and-harry-suffer-awkward-blunder-as-archewell-website-link-redirects-to-kanyes-gold-digger">Meghan and Harry suffer awkward blunder as Archewell website link redirects to Kanye&rsquo;s Gold Digger</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/08/20/26969614-0-image-a-11_1586373983968.jpg" alt="img">
Meghan and Harry have been mocked online after failing to register a website for their new Archewell charitable foundation which has instead been snapped up by cyber-squatters.</p>
<p>Fans who type in <a href="http://www.archewellfoundation.com">www.archewellfoundation.com</a> are unwittingly diverted to a YouTube video of Kanye West&rsquo;s 2005 Gold Digger hit featuring Jamie Foxx.</p>
<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced they are launching a new charitable foundation named Archewell earlier this week but apparently failed to register the likely domain name.</p>
<p>A number of eagle-eyed social media users spotted the embarrassing blunder, with one writing on Twitter: &lsquo;Uh oh. As of 7 April, if you enter in archewellfoundation.com in your browser, it actually links to Kanye West&rsquo;s - Gold Digger video on YouTube.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A possible URL for Meghan Markle and Prince Harry&rsquo;s new Archewell charitable foundation website is redirecting fans to a YouTube video of Kanye West&rsquo;s Gold Digger</p>
<p>It has been revealed that typing in <a href="http://www.archewellfoundation.com">www.archewellfoundation.com</a> will automatically direct you to a YouTube video of Kanye&rsquo;s hit Gold Digger</p>
<p>Another tweeted: &lsquo;So. Meghan and Harry leave the UK to raise their son in privacy. They move to LA. No we aren&rsquo;t going to launch a foundation. 2 wks later they announce The Archewell Foundation.</p>
<p>Kanye, pictured at the Vanity Fair Oscars Party in February, was the victim of a similar prank in 2015 when loser.com was programmed to link to his Wikipedia page</p>
<p>&lsquo;If u type archewellfoundation.com YouTube plays Golddigger by Kanye West. Hilarious. 10/10.&rsquo;</p>
<p>FEMAIL has contacted Buckingham Palace for comment.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Kanye himself was the target of a similar prank himself in 2015, when an internet troll made loser.com redirect to the rapper&rsquo;s Wikipedia entry.</p>
<p>Prince Harry and Meghan have said they &lsquo;look forward&rsquo; to getting started with the Archewell foundation, which will replace their Sussex Royal brand.</p>
<p>The pair also have plans to include their own charity as well as a website, as part of their new venture.</p>
<p>Harry and Meghan revealed the Greek word in the project Arche – meaning source of action – was the inspiration behind the name of their son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor.</p>
<p>Further details about the organisation have been delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The couple said an announcement will be made &lsquo;when the time is right&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Yesterday Harry and Meghan were criticised for the timing of their announcement, which unfortunately coincided with Prime Minister Boris Johnson being moved into intensive care with coronavirus.</p>
<p>Royal biographer Phil Dampier said it was &lsquo;appalling timing&rsquo;, adding: &lsquo;If I were Harry and Meghan I would have laid low until this situation (coronavirus) was over.</p>
<p>&lsquo;People everywhere are really concerned with dealing with this and it does not look good, however good the cause is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A number of eagle-eyed social media users spotted the embarrassing blunder, with one writing on Twitter: &lsquo;Uh oh. As of 7 April, if you enter in archewellfoundation.com in your browser, it actually links to Kanye West&rsquo;s - Gold Digger video on YouTube&rsquo;</p>
<p>It also attracted criticism from members of the public, with Kathie Gyngell, the editor of The Conservative Woman, writing on Twitter: &lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t they have waited? Deeply inappropriate time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The foundation was coincidentally revealed just hours after fans took to Twitter to launch the hashtag &lsquo;ArchieDay&rsquo; to celebrate the first birthday of the couple&rsquo;s son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, with a global campaign to raise money for &lsquo;vulnerable children impacted by coronavirus&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Their plans came a day after the Queen addressed the UK regarding the coronavirus pandemic on Sunday night.</p>
<p>The Telegraph has previously reported that paperwork regarding their new brand was filed in the United States last month and the couple are considering how to create their own charity and volunteering services.</p>
<p>Plans also include a wide-ranging website and sharing &lsquo;education and training materials&rsquo; via films, podcasts and books, according to the newspaper.</p>
<p>In response to the Telegraph, the duke and duchess said they were focusing their efforts on the coronavirus pandemic but felt &lsquo;compelled&rsquo; to reveal details of the venture.</p>
<p>The foundation was coincidentally revealed just hours after fans took to Twitter to launch the hashtag &lsquo;ArchieDay&rsquo; to celebrate the first birthday of the couple&rsquo;s son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, with a global campaign to raise money for &lsquo;vulnerable children impacted by coronavirus&rsquo;. Pictured: the Sussexes in South Africa last year</p>
<p>&lsquo;Like you, our focus is on supporting efforts to tackle the global Covid-19 pandemic but faced with this information coming to light, we felt compelled to share the story of how this came to be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Before SussexRoyal, came the idea of Arche – the Greek word meaning source of action.</p>
<p>Prince Harry and Meghan’s ambitious plans for the Archewell trademark and what it covers Prince Harry and Meghan filed paperwork with the United States Patent and Trademark Office last month, according to the Telegraph. The paperwork, filed last month, is to trademark Archewell. Included in the trademark are prerecorded video cassettes, CDs, DVDs, MP3s and streaming materials as well as calendars, photographs, posters and art prints. According to The Telegraph, the couple have come up with proposals for a vast and ambitious array of projects under the name. These include a wide-ranging website and sharing &lsquo;education and training materials&rsquo; via films, podcasts and books.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We connected to this concept for the charitable organisation we hoped to build one day, and it became the inspiration for our son&rsquo;s name. To do something of meaning, to do something that matters.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Archewell is a name that combines an ancient word for strength and action, and another that evokes the deep resources we each must draw upon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We look forward to launching Archewell when the time is right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The couple moved to Los Angeles with baby Archie to start their new life after they were forced to choose between financial independence or remaining as working members of the royal family.</p>
<p>But it has since been revealed that Meghan has not seen her mother Doria Ragland since the family moved, as they have been in isolation at their new home.</p>
<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are continuing to isolate themselves at a secluded mansion in a private gated community with baby Archie after moving from Vancouver Island, Canada, earlier this month.</p>
<p>They have so far been unable to visit Meghan&rsquo;s 63-year-old mother as a result of the coronavirus epidemic.</p>
<p>A source told the Sun on Sunday: &lsquo;Meghan is absolutely heartbroken - after all, one of the main reasons she decided to live in LA was to be near her mum.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because of her age, Doria obviously has to be careful and Meghan and Harry are sticking rigidly to all formal guidelines when it comes to coronavirus.</p>
<p>Their announcement comes just one day after the Queen addressed the UK regarding the coronavirus pandemic. The couple were made to change their Sussex Royal brand after the Queen (above) and senior officials were said to have ordered them to drop the use of the word &lsquo;royal&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They&rsquo;ve been WhatsApping and FaceTiming almost daily but obviously it&rsquo;s not the same.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The source went on to say that Meghan, 38, will now be using much of her free time to focus on her philanthropic causes after she and Harry, 35, officially stepped down as senior working royals earlier this week.</p>
<p>It is thought that the couple are continuing to look for their forever home in the affluent area of Malibu.</p>
<p>The couple had previously been made to change their Sussex Royal brand after the Queen and senior officials were said to have ordered them to drop the use of the word &lsquo;royal&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Last week, they bowed out of the royal family with a final post on their official Sussex Royal Instagram account, which will now remain inactive along with their website.</p>
<p>The couple have delayed announcing a new Instagram handle and brand, with a spokeswoman saying they wanted the focus to remain on the global response to the coronavirus pandemic.

<h3 id="ellen-and-portia-how-we-saved-our-marriage">Ellen and Portia: How we saved our marriage</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.newidea.com.au/media/86354/1h.jpg" alt="img">
After years of constant rumours Ellen DeGeneres and wife Portia di Rossi’s marriage is on the rocks due to Ellen’s hectic work schedule, it turns out the couple are working things out. Getty</p>
<p>“So Ellen’s been making a concerted effort to be more attentive to Portia and she may re-evaluate her future on TV. Ever since they hashed things out, they’ve been so much happier,” the source added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another source told Globe: “This time last year, they were fighting like the banshees. There’s hope for them yet!”</p>
<p>Rumour has it, problems started when the couple agreed for Ellen to scale back on her work and to move to Portia’s native country, but when Ellen signed on for another season of her talk show, Portia wasn’t too happy.</p>
<p>Ellen and Portia are rumoured to have finally agreed to make things work, after 12 years of marriage. Getty</p>
<p>“They let things slide at various stages, which really pushed them to the brink on a few occasions,” the insider claimed.</p>
<p>“But now they’ve made a firm decision to just let go of the bad vibes. No more jealousy and bickering and instead, more date nights and weekend retreats, just the two of them,” they added.</p>
<p>Ellen and Portia’s relationship update comes after Ellen was slammed on social media, for comparing her coronavirus quarantine to jail.</p>
<p>Rumour has it, problems started when the couple agreed for Ellen to scale back on her work and to move to Portia’s native country. Getty</p>
<p>“One thing that I’ve learned from being in quarantine is that … this is like being in jail, is what it is,” Ellen told viewers on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, which was being filmed from the living room of her $43 million mansion in Montecito, California.</p>
<p>As a result, fans were seemingly furious with her comments, with many taking to Twitter to vent their frustrations, resulting in Ellen receiving an onslaught of backlash.</p>
<p>“What a great look for Ellen as thousands of people sit in actual jail cells just hoping for the best without soap and basic protections,” one Twitter user wrote.
