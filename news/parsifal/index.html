<p>In his 1998 book On Hunting, Roger Scruton defended the unspeakable in pursuit of the uneatable. In his last, now posthumously published book, the philosopher who died in January stands up for the unbearable responsible for the insufferable. The unbearable? The megalomaniac, narcissistic, antisemitic monster Richard Wagner. And the insufferable? The life-hating curse on the senses that was his last opera.</p>
<p>So at least argued Nietzsche, who damned Wagner’s Parsifal with the histrionics only a former devotee can muster. “Parsifal,” he snarled in the essay “Nietzsche Contra Wagner”, “is a work of perfidy, of vindictiveness, of a secret attempt to poison the presuppositions of life – a bad work.”</p>
<p>Parsifal, which received its premiere at Bayreuth in 1882, unfolds in an unsavoury twilight milieu of death, curdling blood and toxic sex. The castle of Montsalvat is home to a community of grimly celibate knights who guard the Holy Grail, a chalice holding the blood of Christ collected after the crucifixion, along with the Holy Lance with which he was pierced. Their depressive leader, Amfortas, has an agonising and suppurating thigh wound that won’t heal – just like Henry VIII’s, if not as smelly. His ailing father Titurel, selfishly, declines to die, but hangs on so he can savour the sight of Christ’s blood that is ritually unveiled before the faithful.</p>
<p>Amfortas’s wound was caused when a self-castrated magician called Klingsor seized the Holy Lance and stabbed him with it. Klingsor earlier gelded himself so as not to fall prey to the sexual desire that would distract him from his project of seizing the grail for his drearily power-crazed purposes. He controls a bevy of flower maidens whom he weaponises to lure knights from their vows of chastity. He has also ensnared the opera’s most interesting character, Kundry, a self-loathing seductress with a shameful past (she laughed at Christ’s crucifixion), whom he deploys to destroy his foes with sex.</p>

<p>Into this crypto-Christian bedlam, strolls our eponymous hero, a Siegfried-like simpleton, making his entrance slaughtering a swan for kicks. It is this bird-murdering oaf on whose hopes the future of this community of knights depends.</p>
<p>And yet from this unpromising cast and dramatic material, Scruton convincingly suggests that Parsifal is not so much an infection corrupting its listeners as an antidote to our ills – even in the 21st century. He regarded Parsifal as an allegory of the Gospel story of Christ, with the twist that we can redeem ourselves and in so doing, effectively, become mini-Christs.</p>
<p>This third and final of Scruton’s analyses of Wagner’s operas – the first two were Death-Devoted Heart on Tristan und Isolde, and The Ring of Truth, his superb analysis on the Ring cycle – shows Scruton’s obsession with a composer whose loathsome views were typified by the fact that he tried to get Hermann Levi, a Jew, to convert to Christianity before conducting Parsifal’s premiere. It took Wagner’s patron “Mad” King Ludwig to broker a deal whereby Levi conducted without getting baptised first.</p>
<p>His lifelong obsession with so dubious a character as Wagner may seem symptomatic of Scruton’s own poisonous conservatism</p>
<p>His lifelong obsession with Wagner may well seem symptomatic of Scruton’s own poisonous brand of elegiac conservatism. That said, this short book is a bracing corrective to Nietzsche’s account of the opera. In doing so, Scruton recycles some of his favourite themes, namely the difference between the sacred and the profane, sexual pollution and the redemption desperately needed by our spiritually degenerate society. Scruton writes: “In our polluted passions, seeking pleasure and excitement rather than respect and love, we scorn the Redeemer’s suffering and surrender to the basest form of control.”</p>
<p>But we can revivify the sacred conception of how we ought to live. For Scruton, Wagner “rightly insists” that “a person can be godly without the belief in God”. At the heart of Wagner’s opera, this book suggests, is the idea that our real task as humans is to take on the burden of another’s suffering without any expectation of reward. Amfortas, Klingsor, Kundry and the rest are too mired in their own woes and machinations to do so. Parsifal, sibling to the blond beast Siegfried from Wagner’s Ring tetralogy, is what we need, not just to redeem ourselves but to redeem the Redeemer whose self-sacrifice the grail knights have forgotten. He is the “innocent outsider, perhaps free from specific religious beliefs but with a heart open to the Redeemer’s message”.</p>
<p>The most freighted scene comes in the second act, in which Kundry attempts to seduce this innocent outsider. Sex, for Scruton, has long been the fraught nexus of the erotic and the sacred, an existential zone wherein if you’re doing it right you exalt the other, but if wrong, embark on mutually assured pollution. Apart from drawing him into some pretty dismal views on homosexuality, and a reactionary perspective on the sanctity of marriage, this leads Scruton into a worry about how sex is used as power when it should be sacred communion.</p>
<p>When Kundry kisses Parsifal in Klingsor’s magic garden, she uses sex both to corrupt him and, paradoxically, to win redemption through wooing a chaste man who will resist her, thus lifting the curse. Of all kisses in the operatic canon, this must be the most semiotically dense, sexually weird, not to mention hopeless.</p>
<p>No wonder some critics have seen Kundry as serving not just Klingsor but Wagner’s hidden sexist agenda. The opera’s only substantial female character is conceived of as existential succubus, evil magician’s sex missile, and self-divided ruin of a human being.</p>
<p>Matters get even stranger in act three in which Parsifal, after years of wandering, returns to Montsalvat on Good Friday, now a fully fledged grail knight. He is the personification of compassionate godliness, to which we should aspire. Kundry washes his feet and he baptises her. Then he turns his attention to Amfortas, whose still terrible pains pique his compassion. He touches the wound with the Holy Lance and, miraculously, it heals. The community is revived and revitalised by this act. The Grail is brought out and opened. The knights kneel down, Kundry dies peacefully. In some productions of the opera, a dove is lowered on a string to hover above Parsifal’s head as the music swells to a conclusion.</p>
<p>What are we to make of this? Scruton writes: “Through compassion the Redeemer made a gift of himself and we, by following that example … renew the world, which flowers like the meadows on Good Friday.” It’s a plausible interpretation of what Wagner attempted, but not one that would have induced Nietzsche to return to the Wagnerian fold. Disenchanted with Wagner, he fell for Bizet’s Carmen since the Frenchman’s music was everything the German’s was not – light, loveable, healthy.</p>
<p>Yet if you listen to the opera, as I did while writing this review, you can find in it something other than the Christian message Scruton excavates or the life-rejecting toxicity Nietzsche revolted against. Debussy called its music “incomparable and bewildering, splendid and strong”. Not so much a curse on the senses, then, as an enchantment of them.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.rhinegold.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/parsifal-operaactual-palermo.jpeg" alt="img">
ROGER SCRUTON’S FINAL WORD ON PARSIFAL</p>
<p>Book Review:</p>
<p>Wagner’s Parsifal: The Music of Redemption</p>
<p>by Roger Scruton</p>
<p>208 pages, Allen Lane</p>
<p>As one might expect from the philosopher Sir Roger Scruton (who sadly died on January 12, 2020, shortly after completing this book), the range of reference here is vast. Luminaries such as Kant and T S Eliot, whom Scruton had praised elsewhere, are perhaps inevitable guides. But this is Scruton’s own examination of ‘The Music of Redemption’, as the book’s subtitle calls it: ‘Wagner’s answer to a question that concerns us all … how to live in right relation with others, even if there is no God to help us’. The true meaning of Parsifal, he posits, is that we may be ‘redeemed from our faults’ via an unnamed ‘Redeemer’.</p>
<p>Compassion, says Scruton, is the ‘sole but sufficient answer to our suffering and the key to the meaning of our world’; his purpose in this book is to clarify that philosophy, first by tracing the Parsifal’s ‘ancient and respectable’ lineage from Eschenbach’s 13th-century narrative romance Parzifal; later, Joseph Campbell’s indispensable work on comparative myth and religion (and Frazer’s Golden Bough), Schopenhauer, Lucy Beckett and Ulrike Kienzle.</p>
<p>The structure of the book is such that the first four chapters may be read by those with only a ‘passing acquaintance’ to music notation. ‘The Quest’ introduces the story, putting it into its literary and religious perspective, as well as discussing its place in liberal individualism from Locke to John Rawls. We see Parsifal himself in liminal state (wishing to belong to the World but unsure of how) and trace the Grail legend. In ‘Wagner’s Treatment of the Story’, Scruton further examines the Grail history, including etymology and a long exegesis of the story – a summary not to be skimmed, as it is far more than this. Littered with insight, Scruton’s prose is magnificent (Amfortas’ motif ‘wobbles on its augmented triad as if every note were a jolt of pain’). Via a detailed deconstruction of the Prophesy (‘Durch Mitleid wissend …’), Scruton succinctly demonstrates how motifs shift meaning. He sees the three acts as three tableaux of a triptych, ‘…a holistic experience that is the life of religion in its entirety’.</p>
<p>With the third chapter, ‘Confronting the Enigma,’ Scruton examines staged attempts to wrestle with Parsifal, and includes a swipe at Regietheater: ‘staging, costumes, setting and even plot are rewritten according to the clever ideas of the producer, whose ego stands between the audience and the drama’. Both Stefan Herheim and Dmitri Tcherniakov come under this heading. Spanning all of this is the music itself: ‘The musical material fragments and re-forms in response to diverse emotions and then brings them together in an all-comprehending resolution that has been earned dramatically and musically.’</p>
<p>The fourth chapter, ‘Sin, Love and Redemption’, sees Parsifal’s compassion as a form of knowledge; redemption as compassion and an active confrontation with suffering. Very much with his Kantian goggles on, Scruton moves through a discussion of agape (as the highest form of love, outside of which Kundry lives) through Kierkegaard to Schopenhauer. Finally, Chapters 5 and 6, ‘The Music’ and ‘The Principal Leitmotifs’. ‘The Music’ refers to Wagner’s techniques: the importance of enharmonics to move from one consonance to another; themes weaving in and out of textures indicative of the dynamic between chronos and kairos (clock time and, simplified, ‘quality’ of time, or a supratemporal understanding of events). To this, and following Derrick Everett’s terminology, the opening ‘Grundthema’ stands ‘at the front of the work like the ceremonial entrance to a temple’. Scruton memorably refers to scenes washed in consonance ‘erasing any sense of tonal grammar’ and of a ‘super-saturated consonance’.</p>
<p>Scruton’s consideration of other commentators is never less than fascinating: Heinrich Schenker (‘not unlike the fascination exerted by Ptolomaic cosmology over medieval astronomers’); Carl Dahlhaus (long-term) versus Alfred Lorenz (short-term). But perhaps the final chapter’s Leitmotif list and commentary, taking into account von Wolzogen, Kufferath and Derrick Everett (<a href="http://www.monsalvat.no">www.monsalvat.no</a>) is the most immediately useful part of the musical section, succinct, open in references, and clear in layout.</p>
<p>In his weaving of philosophy and musicology into an explication of redemption via the vehicle of compassion, this is an unparalleled, sadly posthumously published offering. It is at once required reading and a launch pad for an infinitude of musings. It is also, it should be clearly stated, magisterial.

<h3 id="de-omstreden-laatste-opera-van-wagner">&ldquo;De omstreden laatste opera van Wagner&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.nrc.nl/y4Mf70cDpjdEq-75JOLfI_8NBmc=/1200x627/smart/filters:no_upscale()/s3/static.nrc.nl/bvhw/files/2020/06/data58942744-fd9bf2.jpg" alt="img">
Ook onder de bewonderaars van Richard Wagner is zijn laatste werk Parsifal soms nog steeds omstreden. Is Wagners afscheidswerk een kleine, maar toch onmiskenbare stap terug na de mirakels van Der Ring des Nibelungen, Tristan und Isolde en Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg? Of is Parsifal juist de culminatie en het hoogtepunt van Wagners kunst?</p>
<p>Dat blijft misschien een kwestie van smaak. De bekende Britse conservatieve filosoof Roger Scruton (1944-2020) behoorde evident tot het tweede kamp. Kort voor zijn overlijden in januari voltooide hij zijn beknopte, maar diepgravende beschouwing Wagner’s Parsifal. The Music of Redemption. Eerder schreef Scruton Death Devoted Heart (2004), over Tristan und Isolde, en The Ring of Truth (2016), over Der Ring des Nibelungen.</p>
<p>In Parsifal grijpt Wagner terug op middeleeuwse legenden en sagen. Het werk draait om een gemeenschap van graalridders die waken over twee relieken van het christendom: de speer waarmee Jezus aan het kruis is verwond en de schaal, die de heiland gebruikte bij het laatste avondmaal en waarin later zijn bloed is opgevangen aan het kruis.</p>
<p>Seksualiteit</p>
<p>De hoeders van de graal en de speer zijn vanwege hun zondigheid in de greep gekomen van een diepe spirituele malaise. Alleen de ‘heilige dwaas’ Parsifal kan die opheffen. Daarvoor moet Parsifal eerst de verleidingen van het vlees weerstaan tijdens zijn confrontatie met de gespleten tovenares Kundry en de bevallige bloemenmeisjes, die hem willen verleiden in de tuin van de demonische magiër Klingsor. Parsifal doorstaat de beproevingen, wordt ‘door medelijden wetend’ en herstelt het heilige ritueel van de graal.</p>
<p>Scruton neemt de religieuze dimensie van Parsifal volstrekt serieus. Scrutons analyse draait om ‘het heilige’ in Parsifal en de ‘enorme inspanning’ die nodig is om ‘het heilige tot stand te brengen.’ Hij leunt sterk op de antropologische theorieën over spirituele ‘zuiverheid’ en ‘besmetting’ in de menselijke cultuur van Mary Douglas en de beroemde analyse van de zondebok van René Girard. Het belang van rituelen, thuis zijn in een gemeenschap, de ontwikkeling van een spiritueel-ethische verhouding tot seksualiteit zijn thema’s, die ook uit Scrutons andere werk bekend zijn. Daarmee weet hij een aantal essentiële elementen van Parsifal te benoemen. Maar Scrutons preoccupaties zijn niet per se gelijk aan die van Wagner. Zo speelt de filosofie van Arthur Schopenhauer, die Wagner en daarmee Parsifal diep heeft gevormd, slechts een ondergeschikte rol bij hem. Begrijpelijk, want Schopenhauer was een atheïst, al was hij naar eigen zeggen ‘een atheïst met religieuze sympathieën.’</p>
<p>Onthechting</p>
<p>Schopenhauer, de grote pessimist, beschouwde het leven als een diep tragische aangelegenheid. Al het levende staat in het teken van de wil tot leven en overleven. Daarmee zijn permanente strijd, egoïsme en bloedvergieten onvermijdelijk. De enige manier om – tijdelijk – te ontsnappen is onthechting door middel van contemplatie van diezelfde wil.</p>
<p>Ook het inzicht dat alles – plant, mens en dier – onderdeel is van dezelfde levenswil biedt een tijdelijke ontsnappingsmogelijkheid aan het blinde najagen van de wil. Schopenhauer hechtte daarom grote waarde aan medelijden.</p>
<p>De strijd van allen tegen allen is slechts de verschijningsvorm van wat in werkelijkheid één ondeelbaar geheel vormt; een mystieke eenheid. Twee religies hadden bij Schopenhauer daarom een streepje voor, al geloofde hij niet in God: het christendom en het boeddhisme, omdat die religies zo sterk de nadruk leggen op lijden, onthechting, medelijden en solidariteit.</p>
<p>Dat zijn inzichten die Parsifal diep beïnvloedden. Wagner verklaarde zonder omhaal van woorden dat hij ‘niet geloofde in God, wel in het goddelijke.’ Hij had een grote fascinatie voor de figuur van Jezus, als het hoogste symbool van zelfopoffering en mededogen. Maar of Wagner ook heeft geloofd dat Jezus echt bestond?</p>
<p>Doe-het-zelver</p>
<p>Als hij niet geloofde in een persoonlijke God en niet in een Schepper, kan hij moeilijk hebben geloofd dat Jezus de zoon van God was.</p>
<p>Wie zich sterk verbonden voelt met de tradities en dogma’s van het christelijk geloof kan in Parsifal daarom alleen een hoogst problematisch werk zien. Wagner hield er een zeer persoonlijke vorm van religiositeit op na, afkomstig uit de meest uiteenlopende westerse en oosterse bronnen. Als spirituele doe-het-zelver was hij daarmee bij uitstek ‘modern’, hoezeer hij verder ook tekeer ging tegen het platte materialisme, de uitbuiting van mens en natuur en de commercie van de moderne wereld.</p>
<p>Scruton is te serieus en integer om te willen verhullen dat Wagner er een vanuit conservatief perspectief hoogst eigenaardige vorm van religie op nahield: een christendom zonder schepper, zonder hiernamaals, zonder wederopstanding. De heilsgeschiedenis van Parsifal speelt zich volledig af op aarde. Maar Scruton lijkt er niet erg mee te zitten. Dat roept dan weer de vraag op hoe serieus en letterlijk Scruton zijn eigen geloof nam; hij keerde op latere leeftijd terug in de boezem van de Anglicaanse kerk, die hij vooral koesterde vanwege zijn nationale, typisch Britse eigenschappen.</p>
<p>Drankmisbruik</p>
<p>De expliciet progressieve kant van Wagners wereldbeschouwing valt bij Scruton van tafel. In 1849 had Wagner zij aan zij gestaan met de grote anarchist Bakoenin op de barricaden van Dresden. De revolutie mislukte. Wagner ontdekte Schopenhauer. Toch bleef hij zich ook in zijn latere jaren koesteren in wat hij zijn ‘natuurlijke anarchie’ noemde. Wagner was tot het einde een vurige maatschappijhervormer. Daarbij vestigde hij zijn hoop op verenigingen van vegetariërs, strijders tegen vivisectie en ander dierenleed, de bonden tegen drankmisbruik en de sociaal-democraten. Sporen van Wagners anti-militairisme, vegetarisme en pacifisme zijn in Parsifal niet moeilijk terug te vinden.</p>
<p>Voor Wagner kon de christelijke boodschap alleen voor de hele mensheid gelden. Hij verwierp in zijn laatste levensfase alle goden die zich beperkten tot een specifieke groep, natie of stam. Zulke goden zouden immers de strijd van de blinde wil van allen tegen allen maar verder aanwakkeren. Dat gold voor antisemiet Wagner natuurlijk voor de God van het Joodse volk in het Oude Testament. Maar de boodschap van universele naastenliefde van Christus overtrof voor hem ook die van de heidense Goden, die hij zo monumentaal had geëerd in Der Ring des Nibelungen. Wagners afscheidswerk was gericht aan de hele mensheid. Daar kan weinig twijfel over bestaan.</p>

<h3 id="parsifal-streaming---palerme---critique">&ldquo;Parsifal (streaming) - Palerme - Critique&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.forumopera.com/sites/default/files/b_catherine-hunold-kundry-c-rosellina-garbo-2020-_grg8054-1_1.gif" alt="img">
A l&rsquo;occasion de la rediffusion en streaming de Parsifal à Palerme (visible jusqu&rsquo;au 9 juillet 2020), nous vous proposons de relire ci-après le compte rendu de la représentation du 2 février 2020.</p>
<p>On oublie souvent que Wagner a terminé la composition de Parsifal à Palerme (précisément au Grand Hôtel et des Palmes), la plume dans une main, un verre d’Aperol Spritz dans une autre. Pour l’occasion, le Teatro Massimo, qui monte l’œuvre pour la troisième fois seulement (après 1914, en italien, et 1955), expose même dans un foyer le modeste harmonium qui servit de support de travail au maître de Bayreuth.</p>
<p>Soixante-cinq ans sans Parsifal : la responsabilité est grande pour le Teatro Massimo. Pour beaucoup de spectateurs, ce sera leur premier et dernier ; pas le droit à l’à-peu-près. Pari réussi, au moins musicalement.</p>
<p>L’orchestre palermitain n’est pourtant pas dans son environnement naturel. Si l’intonation est plus d’une fois mise à l’épreuve, et qu’il n’est pas question d’espérer ici les trésors de complexité et de textures attendus ailleurs, ce qu’Omer Meir Wellber en tire est néanmoins remarquable. La phalange distille un lyrisme naturel, assez premier degré, qui enjambe l’imbrication savante des Leitmotive pour toucher l’émotion directe. Le nouveau directeur musical de la maison ne tire pas ici de grand arc de part en part (d’où un prélude un peu décousu) mais privilégie l’action, l&rsquo;instantanéité théâtrale, culminant dans un mémorable enchantement du Vendredi Saint.</p>
<p>La distribution est d’envergure et aligne les forts tempéraments scéniques. Pour sa prise de rôle, Catherine Hunold habite déjà Kundry comme après un long compagnonnage. La tessiture impossible ? Elle l’a : graves sonnants et assez effrayants, aigus jamais criés. La présence ? Elle l’a aussi, peut-être davantage aimante que furibarde, mais posant chaque pas, chaque regard, avec poids, avec sens. Pareil engagement chez les chevaliers du Graal. Gurnemanz ahurissant de John Relyea, dont la voix infinie n’accuse aucun signe de fatigue, peut-être car il privilégie les accents du texte au flot vocal – qui suit pourtant, souverain. L’Amfortas de Tómas Tómasson impressionne également, alter Christus à moitié nu baladant sa noire exaltation d’un bout à l’autre du spectacle. Les deux profitent de l’acoustique superlative du Teatro Massimo : malgré l’absence de décors, les voix graves (surtout) se faufilent derrière l’oreille de chacun des spectateurs avec une netteté bluffante. Klingsor un rien débraillé – vestimentairement et vocalement – mais parfaitement patibulaire de Thomas Gazheli. Arrivé quelques jours à peine avant la première pour remplacer Daniel Kirch, Julian Hubbard est encore un Parsifal un peu frais. Jeune voix claire, non dénuée de vaillance, elle séduit dans l&rsquo;acte I mais se cogne aux obstacles encore infranchissables du II – à commencer par le passage de la fosse. Le III le voit se resaissir et l’on entend par moments les promesses d’un futur grand.</p>
<p>Graham Vick sait faire une chose : c’est diriger. Il y a dans ce Parsifal des mouvements, des regards, des gestes qui suffiraient à nous rendre heureux. Parmi d’autres, au III, la concordance de la musique et des regards lorsque Parsifal reconnaît Kundry nous fait revivre en un instant tout le duo du II. Bien joué.</p>
<p>Pour le reste, le metteur en scène anglais caricature le pire du post-modernisme eurotrash, sans la moindre idée si ce n’est de dire que « vraiment, la religion, c’est nul ». Envoyés par quelque puissance occidentale (Titurel est une sorte de Donald Trump) mettre le bazar au Moyen-Orient, les chevaliers du Graal (en treillis bien sûr) s’ennuient et se perdent dans un culte sectaire qui n’a de chrétien que le décorum – leur prêtre Amfortas se traîne pitoyablement, couronné d’épines comme le Christ aux outrages. Kundry est en niqab. Klingsor et sa bande ont dû s’échapper de la base militaire pour pouvoir s’amuser plus tranquillement – Kundry n’est plus en niqab. Au III, le bataillon a succombé à un stress post-traumatique généralisé et s’enferme dans un culte de plus en plus mortifère : il suffit que le premier innocent venu – Parsifal – leur ouvre les yeux sur l’absurdité de leur croyance (et la non-existence de leur Graal) pour que le monde chante et que les enfants fassent de nouveau la ronde de l’amitié des peuples. Il n’y a plus de niqab. Le beau était manifestement en option : l’urgence, nous rappelle Graham Vick dans sa courte note de programme, c’est le combat contre le racisme, l’intolérance religieuse et la masculinité toxique. OK boomer.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Below-Deck-Sailing-Yacht-24.jpg" alt="img">
Although Below Deck yachts are usually not in glistening shape before the first charter, most are in decent enough condition that the crew has ample time to pull it together before charter.</p>

<p>However, Parsifal III featured on Below Deck Sailing Yacht was in disarray when the crew arrived. Deckhand Ciara Duggan, first mate Paget Berry and Captain Glenn Shephard were already working on the sailing yacht — a first for the series. But as one crew member after another arrived on the boat, comments about the boat being far from charter ready started to flow.</p>
<p>Chief stew Jenna MacGillivray seemed especially concerned as the interior team tried to locate linens while the deck team scrambled to prepare the yacht’s exterior. New crew members made it seem as though Duggan, Shephard, and Berry dropped the ball. Chef Adam Glick envisioned that the yacht looked like it was Berry and Duggan’s apartment.</p>
<p>However, what viewers didn’t know was that the boat was coming off another season with a significantly smaller crew. Plus, the crew were seasick during their voyage to Greece.</p>
<p>Duggan ran multiple departments</p>
<p>Duggan told Showbiz Cheat Sheet the original crew was not simply being lackadaisical. “I knew we were going to be doing the show,” she says. “I didn’t know if I was going to be on the show until very, very close to the time of filming, because you’re not really told until last minute.”</p>
<p>“And so I knew that we were potentially going to be doing the show and I was working as the crew chef and the sole stew,” she explains. “It’s a big boat. So there’s only so much I can do between cooking two meals a day for the crew, doing weekend food, keeping the galley clean. Trying to do stuff with the interior while we have work going on.”</p>

<p>She adds, “I did the best I could with what I had. Between that and having to stow everything. I mean, the reason that there were linens stuffed in cabinets is because that’s what you use to keep breakable things from falling out of cabinets. I mean, we stuffed towels everywhere.”</p>
<p>Everyone was also seasick on their way to Greece too</p>
<p>In addition to juggling multiple jobs and trying to keep breakable items from being smashed during sails, Duggan said the crew got pretty seasick when they sailed the yacht to Greece.</p>
<p>RELATED: ‘Below Deck Med’: Kasey Cohen Says She Received Backlash for Being Seasick</p>
<p>“We ended up with really, really bad weather on our way to Greece,” she explains. “Pretty much everybody was seasick the whole time and it was just miserable.”</p>
<p>Below Deck Mediterranean viewers know the Med can be a bumpy ride. Third stew Kasey Cohen told Showbiz Cheat Sheet she was seasick during her season, despite being a trained yachtie.</p>
<p>Plus, she was the only one managing the interior</p>
<p>“So it’s like, yes the boat was a mess,” she says. “But normally you don’t have the full interior crew join the day before charter. You have a few weeks for the entire team to get everything ready. So I was kind of at a disadvantage from the very beginning if that makes sense.”</p>
<p>RELATED: ‘Below Deck Sailing Yacht’: What Are Some Common Superstitions in Boating?</p>
<p>She adds that when Parsifal III had additional crew members, they were all on deck. She handled the interior completely by herself. “And then when we had extra crew on, they were deck crew helping with the exterior for the more technical sailing things and for safety.”</p>
<p>Find out if Duggan shares more about the sailing yacht during the Below Deck Sailing Yacht reunion at 8/7c Monday on Bravo.

Pressemitteilung BoxID: 802025 (Die Staatstheater Stuttgart)</p>
<p>Online-Streamings im Juni und Juli gehen mit Wagners Parsifal weiter</p>
<p>Oper trotz Corona: Die Staatsoper Stuttgart setzt ihr digitales On-Demand-Programm mit Unterstützung der LBBW bis Ende der Saison fort. Es folgen bis 31. Juli noch acht weitere Streams.</p>
<p>Im Rahmen des kostenlosen Digitalprogramms im Rahmen von „Oper trotz Corona“ präsentiert die Staatsoper Stuttgart noch bis Ende Juli 2020 jede Woche eine Oper als Stream auf ihrer Website. Jeden Freitag ab 17 Uhr steht für jeweils eine Woche lang eine neue Opernproduktion als Video-on-demand zur Verfügung – kostenlos und in voller Länge.</p>
<p>Damit geht mit Juli ein Digitalprojekt zu Ende, das bisher rund 50.000 Zuschauer*innen in aller Welt erreicht hat. Intendant Viktor Schoner: „Stillstand gibt es am Theater nicht, und so waren und sind wir vom ersten Tag des Shutdowns an im Netz aktiv – obwohl das Haus fürs Publikum geschlossen war. Auch wenn mittlerweile der Spielbetrieb in kleinerem Rahmen wieder begonnen hat, führen wir das Digitalprojekt bis zum Saisonende mit Unterstützung unseres Digitalpartners, der Landesbank Baden-Württemberg, weiter; für alle, die die ‚große Oper‘ vermissen und all diejenigen, die aus gesundheitlichen Gründen nicht zu unserer Vielzahl von Projekten im ganzen Stadtraum kommen können.“</p>
<p>Ab dem heutigen Freitag, 5. Juni, steht eine Aufzeichnung von Richard Wagners Parsifal in der viel diskutierten Inszenierung von Calixto Bieito auf dem Programm. Mit dieser Aufzeichnung aus dem Jahr 2018 wird diese Inszenierung überhaupt zum ersten Mal einem größeren Publikum außerhalb des Stuttgarter Opernhauses zugänglich gemacht. Es dirigiert Sylvain Cambreling.</p>
<p>Direkt im Anschluss ab Freitag, 12. Juni, folgt das Making-of dieser Produktion: Der Filmemacher Vadim Jendreyko hat in Die Singende Stadt 2009/10 die Neuinszenierung von Parsifal für seinen Dokumentarfilm mit der Kamera begleitet. Der Film zeigt alle Höhen und Tiefen einer Neuproduktion vom Konzeptionsgespräch bis zur Premiere und gewährt einen intimen Einblick in die künstlerische Arbeit an der Staatsoper Stuttgart.</p>
<p>Verdis Rigoletto in der Inszenierung von Jossi Wieler und Sergio Morabito ist ab 19. Juni zu sehen. Neben der eigentlichen Bühnenaufführung gibt diese Aufnahme aber auch einen faszinierenden Einblick in die Welt hinter der Bühne: Zur Aufführung als solcher bietet der SWR-Mitschnitt von Verdis Oper auch interessante Live-Backstage-Einblicke.</p>
<p>Eine weitere Regiearbeit von Jossi Wieler und Sergio Morabito folgt am 26. Juni: Vinzenzo Bellinis I Puritani ist eine der schönsten und gleichzeitig einflussreichsten Opern des Belcanto-Genres. In diesem Mitschnitt aus dem Jahr 2018 dirigiert Manlio Benzi.</p>
<p>Die vier Teile von Richard Wagners Ring des Nibelungen, inszeniert von vier Regieteams: Aufsehenerregend waren die vier unterschiedlichen Lesarten von Wagners monumentalem Musikdrama in den Jahren 1999/2000. Ab 3. Juli sind Joachim Schlömers, Christof Nels, Jossi Wielers und Sergio Morabitos sowie Peter Konwitschnys Inszenierungen von Das Rheingold, Die Walküre, Siegfried und Götterdämmerung in wöchentlichem Wechsel erneut zu sehen. Am Pult des Staatsorchesters Stuttgart: Lothar Zagrosek.</p>
