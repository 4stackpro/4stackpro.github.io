This week, Apple TV+ will release the first episode of its Defending Jacob miniseries. The series — which stars Chris Evans and Michelle Dockery — is based on William Landay&rsquo;s 2012 novel of the same name. So you might be wondering: How does the Defending Jacob book end? The show&rsquo;s producers say you can read the book without spoiling the miniseries for yourself.</p>
<p>Defending Jacob centers on Andy Barber (Evans), a Massachusetts ADA tasked with investigating the murder of his teenage son Jacob&rsquo;s (Jaeden Martell) classmate. When forensic evidence links Jacob to the other boy&rsquo;s death, he becomes the prime suspect, and his father is forced off of the case. Landay&rsquo;s novel blends Andy&rsquo;s narration from the murder investigation with transcripts from a later grand jury hearing, leaving the reader to wonder what, exactly, transpired in the year between.</p>
<p>Jacob is exonerated when a local man leaves behind a suicide note detailing his involvement in the other boy&rsquo;s murder. Although Andy believes that the so-called killer&rsquo;s suicide was actually a plot to prevent Jacob from going to prison, he and his wife Laurie (Dockery) plan a family vacation to Jamaica to help put the case behind them.</p>
<p>While in the Caribbean, Jacob befriends a girl named Hope, who later goes missing. When Hope&rsquo;s body is recovered, weeks later, with evidence of foul play, Laurie becomes convinced that her son has committed his second murder. She intentionally wrecks her car, killing Jacob and critically injuring herself. As is revealed in the novel&rsquo;s final moments, Andy has been asked to testify at a grand jury hearing to determine whether his wife murdered their son.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re worried that reading the spoilers above will ruin the enjoyment of watching the Apple TV+ adaptation, don&rsquo;t be. Mark Bomback, the writer and executive producer of the Defending Jacob miniseries, told Deadline in January that reading Landay&rsquo;s novel or a summary of it &ldquo;would not tell you the ultimate plot of the series.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not to say that the miniseries will deviate widely from the source material, but that — as Defending Jacob director and executive producer Morton Tyldum put it — &ldquo;there will be big surprises&rdquo; for fans of the book when the series airs.</p>
<p>Defending Jacob premieres Friday, Apr. 24 on Apple TV+.

<h3 id="defending-jacob-chris-evans-leads-a-strong-cast-in-suspenseful-but-slow-paced-miniseries">‘Defending Jacob’: Chris Evans leads a strong cast in suspenseful, but slow-paced, miniseries</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/0Qvr7KfeF1QTf192EKyvbnfOLvI=/1280x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-advancelocal.s3.amazonaws.com/public/6VIVOK46QJDCVDTVXG4PL2M6CE.jpg" alt="img">
Though it was filmed before the coronavirus outbreak relegated us all to our couches and boosted subscriptions to streaming services, “Defending Jacob” has elements that feel unexpectedly relatable to our social distancing moment. In the before times, the selling point for the new Apple TV Plus limited series was star Chris Evans, best known for playing Captain America in endless Marvel-inspired movies, and for his sweater-sporting scoundrel in “Knives Out.” It didn’t hurt that his costar is Michelle Dockery, otherwise known as Lady Mary in the much-loved “Downton Abbey” TV series and movie.</p>
<p>But watching “Defending Jacob,” which begins streaming Friday, April 24 on Apple TV Plus, now may remind us of being holed up with family members. Beyond that, it may make more morbidly inclined viewers think, “it’s not great feeling isolated from society, but at least we’re not wondering if our teen has killed somebody.”</p>
<p>Indeed, that question is the narrative engine that drives “Defending Jacob,” though the engine too often seems stuck in low gear. The story, adapted from a novel by William Landay, centers on a family that’s trying to deal with their 14-year-old son being accused of killing a classmate.</p>
<p>Evans plays Andy Barber, an assistant district attorney who’s used to prosecuting accused criminals, not giving them the benefit of the doubt. Dockery plays his wife, Laurie, who works at a nonprofit dedicated to helping at-risk young people. Jaeden Martell plays their son, Jacob, who in many ways seems like an ordinary teenager, until he’s accused of stabbing a classmate to death.</p>
<p>While “Defending Jacob” is well-made, and boasts fine performances, it’s also the latest in a trend of dramas that focus on upper-middle class white people whose supposedly ideal families turn out to be not what they seem. Maybe it’s the “Big Little Lies” influence, but we’ve recently seen plenty of stories that reveal how those seemingly placid “Ordinary People”-style lives hide a hornet’s nest of scary secrets.</p>
<p>For example, in HBO’s “The Outsider,” from a Stephen King novel, we saw apparent family man Terry Maitland (Jason Bateman) stand accused of murder. The recently concluded Season 3 of “The Sinner,” on USA, saw Matt Bomer play what appears to be a settled husband and father who succumbs to homicidal impulses. In Hulu’s “Little Fires Everywhere,” Reese Witherspoon builds on her “Big Little Lies” role as she plays a woman who fixates on having a “perfect” family, even as those around her are hurting. And in the upcoming HBO series, “The Undoing,” Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant play a New York City couple whose comfortably affluent family life turns upside down when terrible revelations come to light.</p>

<p>In “Defending Jacob,” the family is again living what, for many, looks like the American Dream. But it doesn’t take long for buried truths to emerge, along with nagging suspicions. When their son is accused of murdering a classmate, the cozy world that Andy and Laurie have built in their suburban community of Newton, Massachusetts, falls apart.</p>
<p>The eight-part limited series does a good job of making us feel the parents’ uncertainty about whether Jacob is innocent or guilty. But that suspense is made to carry too much of the load for the relaxed pace of the show, which takes its own sweet time drawing us in.</p>
<p>Created and written by Mark Bomback, and directed by Morten Tyldum (“The Imitation Game”), “Defending Jacob” suffers not only from a too-measured narrative rhythm, but a decision to emphasize a color palette that makes everything gray, bluish-gray or black. It doesn’t help that the lighting is so low that court proceedings seem to be happening during a power blackout. This is serious, we get it, but could we maybe ramp up the lights a bit, so we can see what’s going on?</p>
<p>That said, “Defending Jacob” benefits from strong work by Evans, Dockery, Cherry Jones, J.K.Simmons, and the gifted young Martell, all of whom are able to keep us guessing about what they know, and what they’re going to do about it.</p>
<p>And in an odd, unplanned, but timely element, seeing the family try to shelter in place following the tabloid-style publicity surrounding Jacob being accused recalls our widespread attempt to feel normal, even as a morose layer covers so many of us during the pandemic. For a few moments, sad as the situations in “Defending Jacob” are, we can remember what it was like to shake hands with someone, or sit at a sidewalk table outside a café.</p>
<p>The first three episodes of “Defending Jacob“ will premiere on Friday, April 24 on Apple TV+ and, after that, new episodes will premiere weekly every Friday.</p>
