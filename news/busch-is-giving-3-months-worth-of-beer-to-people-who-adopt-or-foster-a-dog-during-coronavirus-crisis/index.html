(CNN) Nothing beats the company of man&rsquo;s best friend as you self-isolate during the coronavirus outbreak . But an ice-cold beer, free at that, comes in at a close second.</p>
<p>Now you can have both because Busch Beer is offering a three months&rsquo; supply of its beer to 500 people who adopt or foster a dog from Midwest Animal Rescue in Minnesota.</p>
<p>Everyone could use a companion for the couch right now. So if you foster (or adopt) a dog from Midwest Animal Rescue, we&rsquo;ll give you 3 months&rsquo; worth of Busch to enjoy by their side. Go to https://t.co/S58CM3Z6OM to learn more. RT to spread the word. https://t.co/2Afl5fhh9T pic.twitter.com/WebTTioZ2M</p>
<p>To help this effort, Busch Beer has teamed up with Midwest Animal Rescue to launch the &ldquo;Foster a Dog, Get Busch&rdquo; offer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During these uncertain and lonelier times, people need an escape: cue the cute puppy memes and photos,&rdquo; a spokesperson for Busch told People magazine in a statement. &ldquo;But as much as we need those cute puppy pics to help get us through social distancing, it&rsquo;s actually them who need us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Social distancing is better with a furry friend by your side and a cold beer in your hand,&rdquo; the spokesperson added.</p>
<p>To enter, you must adopt or foster a dog through Midwest Animal Rescue. After completing the adoption or foster process, you will receive a confirmation email from the animal shelter, which you should then send to Busch through Facebook, Twitter or Instagram by April 25.</p>
<p>If you are one of the first 500 people to enter, you will receive a $100 pre-paid debit card, which you can then use to buy your three months&rsquo; worth of beer.</p>
<p>So whether it&rsquo;s for the dog or for the free beer, this is an offer that&rsquo;s truly a win-win for everybody.

<h3 id="coronavirus-dogs-from-virus-homes-should-be-on-a-lead">Coronavirus: Dogs from virus homes &lsquo;should be on a lead&rsquo;</h3>

<p>Dogs from households which are self-isolating should be kept on the lead in public, according to new Scottish government guidelines.</p>
<p>It is urging all animal owners to plan how they would care for them if they had to self-isolate.</p>
<p>The government said there was currently no evidence that livestock or pets can be infected with coronavirus.</p>
<p>However, dogs from self-isolating households should not be let off the lead while in public.</p>
<p>People exercising their pets should also follow social-distancing measures, it said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take time to plan&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rural Affairs Minister Mairi Gougeon MSP said: &ldquo;Guidance should be followed by all animal owners to help prevent the spread of this virus. We will continue to review these guidelines regularly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your household is self-isolating, take time to plan how you will exercise your pet, ensuring that you avoid all contact with other members of the public.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are too unwell to care for your pet and do not have anyone nearby who can help, please phone the Scottish SPCA animal helpline for further advice and support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As everyone must observe social distancing rules, all animal owners should take time to consider suitable areas to walk or exercise their pets, avoiding contact with other people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Livestock owners who are concerned about how to care for their animals can contact the Royal Scottish Agricultural Benevolent Institution (RSABI) for help and advice.&rdquo;

<h3 id="second-dog-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-as-owners-warned-not-to-abandon-pets">Second dog tests positive for coronavirus as owners warned not to abandon pets</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/images/MW-IC682_dogzer_ZG_20200320061556.jpg" alt="img">
The Hong Kong government has urged people not to abandon their pets and to stop kissing them after a second dog tested positive for coronavirus, but stressed that the animal had not shown any symptoms of the disease.</p>
<p>A German shepherd living in the Pok Fu Lam area on Hong Kong Island was sent for quarantine along with another mixed-breed dog from the same residence on Thursday after their owner was confirmed as being infected, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said in a statement.</p>
<p>Though the shepherd tested positive for the virus, no such result was obtained from the mixed-breed dog, and “neither dog has shown any signs of disease,” the AFCD said, adding it will continue to monitor both dogs and conduct repeated tests on the animals.</p>
<p>The new case comes after an elderly 17-year-old Pomeranian, which had tested “weak positive” during repeated tests for the virus, died two days after it was released from quarantine disease-free. The AFCD said the dog’s owner wasn’t willing to allow an autopsy to determine the cause of death.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong animal-welfare authority stressed that there is currently no evidence that pets can be a source of the virus or that they can get sick from it. “Under no circumstances should [owners] abandon their pets,” it said.</p>
<p>The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) said that infectious disease experts and multiple international and domestic human and animal health organizations, all agree there is no evidence at this point to indicate that pets become ill with Covid-19 or that they spread it to other animals, including people.</p>
<p>These include the Paris-based World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the U.S.’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which have also both stated that there is no evidence that companion animals such as cats and dogs can spread the virus. “Therefore, there is no justification in taking measures against companion animals which may compromise their welfare,” the OIE said.</p>
<p>However the AVMA said that “out of an abundance of caution, it is recommended that those ill with Covid-19 “limit contact” with animals until more information is known about the virus. The AFCD also reminded pet owners to use good hygiene practices and urged them to avoid kissing their pets.</p>
<p>Some animal-welfare experts have suggested the Pomeranian’s death could have been caused by the stress of being quarantined and separated from its owner, while others have noted its age. “The dog likely died from causes other than Covid-19 as it had never displayed any clinical signs of illness,” The College for Veterinary Medicine at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign said in a post on its website.</p>
<p>Vet diagnostic company IDEXX IDXX, +0.59% said thousands of dogs and cats have been tested for Covid-19, and so far, none have tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>“Our pets can be a source of comfort for us, and not another source of concern, during this evolving Covid-19 environment,” said Dr. Jim Blacka, a veterinarian with IDEXX’s Companion Animal Commercial Business. “Data from IDEXX shows no cases to date of the novel coronavirus in thousands of dog and cat samples tested, which is good news for pets and the people who care for them,” he added.</p>
<p>The AFCD said it “strongly advises” that mammalian pet animals including dogs and cats from households with persons infected with Covid-19 or those who have had close contacted with others infected with the virus, should be quarantined in government facilities.
