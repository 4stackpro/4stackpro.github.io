John Prine, who has died aged 73 due to complications of Covid-19, was a highly influential American singer-songwriter. Musically, his style veered between folk and country, with a dash of country-rock and rockabilly thrown in, but lyrically he was far harder to define.</p>
<p>He wrote about the problems of everyday life, about loneliness, the elderly, victims of war and those abandoned by the American dream, but did so with a blend of poignancy, anger and sudden bursts of humour. So he would sing about an injured soldier leaving Vietnam with a morphine addiction “with a purple heart and a monkey on his back”, about Christmas in prison, and then, about an advice columnist: “Dear Abby, Dear Abby … My fountain pen leaks, my wife hollers at me and my kids are all freaks.”</p>

<p>Bonnie Raitt, who covered one of his best known songs, Angel from Montgomery, compared him to Mark Twain for his combination of tenderness, wisdom and “homespun sense of humour”, while Bob Dylan, who admired his “beautiful songs”, commented that “Prine’s stuff is pure Proustian existentialism. Midwestern mindtrips to the nth degree.”</p>
<p>In a career that lasted more than 50 years, Prine saw his songs covered by an extraordinary array of different artists including Raitt, Johnny Cash, Carly Simon, Bette Midler, the Everly Brothers, Joan Baez and many more. There were lengthy periods when he failed to produce new material – partly because of his battles with cancer – but his later albums were as original as his early work and helped him to win a new young audience towards the end of his career.</p>

<p>When he played at Rough Trade East, off Brick Lane, London, in July 2018, the crowd was so large that it was impossible to get near the stage, and there was as much applause for new songs like Knockin’ on Your Screen Door, from his recently released The Tree of Forgiveness (his best-ever selling album in the US) as for early classics like Hello in There or Speed of the Sound of Loneliness.</p>
<p>Born in Maywood, Illinois, just outside Chicago, John was the son of Verna Hamm and Bill Prine. His father was a factory worker who had moved to Illinois from the coal-mining town of Paradise, Kentucky. The family spent the summer back in Paradise, and here, along with his elder brother Dave, John listened to bluegrass music and studied the guitar styles of country music hero Doc Watson. But he had no immediate thoughts about becoming a musician. In Maywood he worked as a postman, before being drafted into the army in January 1966. He was lucky – instead of being sent to Vietnam he was sent to a base in Germany as a mechanical engineer.</p>
<p>Back in Maywood he continued to work for the postal service, but started to write songs. He had heard Dylan’s 1969 country album Nashville Skyline, which included Cash, and – as he told Rolling Stone in 2017 – “I thought ‘man, there’s something there’ where their two paths crossed. My stuff belongs right in the middle.”</p>
<p>He began singing at Chicago folk clubs, where he came to the notice of the country star Kris Kristofferson. He was so impressed that he invited Prine to play at the Bitter End club in New York, where the audience included Jerry Wexler, president of Atlantic Records. Wexler offered him a recording contract.</p>
<p>Prine’s first album, simply entitled John Prine, was released in 1971. It was not a commercial success, but included a batch of songs that would come to be regarded as classics and would be extensively covered by other artists. These included Angel from Montgomery, Hello in There (a story of loneliness and ageing), Sam Stone (his angry story of a Vietnam veteran turned addict) and Paradise, a bitter-sweet song about the destruction of his father’s old home town where “the coal company came with the world’s largest shovel, and they tortured the timber and stripped all the land”.</p>
<p>Prine was not yet a star but he kept writing memorable songs. Diamonds in the Rough (1972) included Clocks and Spoons, later covered by Jason Isbell and Amanda Shires, while Sweet Revenge (1973) included Christmas in Prison and the witty Dear Abby.</p>
<p>In 1975 he startled his folk-scene followers by recording the album Common Sense with the producer Steve Cropper, house guitarist for the Stax label, and making use of electric guitars, saxophones, trumpets and backing vocals. The more stark and thoughtful Bruised Orange (1978) was better received, and included the inventive Sabu Visits the Twin Cities Alone, the story of an Indian actor on a promotional tour of the Midwest. Prine continued his musical experiments with Pink Cadillac (1979) which included rockabilly influences and production work from Sam Phillips, famed for his work with Elvis Presley.</p>

<p>In the 1980s he returned to country-folk with a set of albums, among them German Afternoons (1986), which included The Speed of the Sound of Loneliness, a regular fixture in his live shows. There was a five-year gap before Prine released his next studio album, The Missing Years, which won him his first Grammy. Helped by a celebrity band that included Bruce Springsteen, Raitt, Tom Petty and Phil Everly on backing vocals, he proved was still in bravely inventive form with songs that included Jesus the Missing Years, which speculates wittily on what Christ might have done during the years unaccounted for in the Bible.</p>
<p>Prine had become known as something of a Nashville hellraiser, but his life changed after he married Fiona Whelan in 1993, five years after they met at a party in Dublin. He became a father for the first time at the age of 48, and Fiona, his third wife, became co-manager of Oh Boy Records, his independent record label.</p>

<p>His flourishing career received a major setback in 1997 when he was diagnosed with neck cancer. Surgery and radiation treatment the following year led to a change in his voice – it became deeper – but he continued writing and performing. In 1999 he released In Spite of Ourselves, an album of country duets (most of them weepies) in which he was joined by female country stars including Iris DeMent and Emmylou Harris, and in 2005 he released Fair and Square, a set of new songs that won him another Grammy.</p>
<p>Playing in London that year, he proved that he was still an original and entertaining singer, despite his now more gruff and gravelly voice, as he introduced new songs from the album that included Some Humans Ain’t Human, which switched from humour to an attack on George W Bush for the Iraq war.</p>

<p>Prine did not record another album of new self-composed songs for 13 years, and in that period he released two albums of cover versions (including a second set of duets with female country stars) and suffered further health problems. In 2013 he was operated on for lung cancer, and though a part of one lung had been removed he continued performing. His early album sleeves had shown him as a cheerful-looking figure sporting an array of different moustaches, but for the cover of his massively-successful 2018 comeback set The Tree of Forgiveness he showed how his appearance had changed because of the surgery.</p>
<p>The album included songs about lost love and mortality, as well as the witty and angry Lonesome Friends of Science, that somehow combined his thoughts on the largest cast iron statue in the world, the demotion of Pluto from planet to a star, and his own lifestyle. It proved that his writing was still as individual as ever. The album was a Top 5 hit in the US.</p>
<p>Prine won four Grammy awards, including a lifetime achievement award in 2020.</p>
<p>He is survived by Fiona, and their sons, Jack, Tommy and Jody.</p>

<h3 id="celebrated-singer-songwriter-john-prine-has-died-at-73">Celebrated singer-songwriter John Prine has died at 73</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.graytvinc.com/images/AP_19167114323585.jpg" alt="img">
John Prine, the ingenious singer-songwriter who explored the heartbreaks, indignities and absurdities of everyday life in “Angel from Montgomery,” “Sam Stone,” “Hello in There” and scores of other indelible tunes, died Tuesday at the age of 73.</p>
<p>His family announced his death from complications from the coronavirus; he died at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>
<p>His wife Fiona said last month that she had tested positive for COVID-19 and she has since recovered, but her husband was hospitalized on March 26 with coronavirus symptoms. He was put on a ventilator and remained in the intensive care unit for several days.</p>
<p>Winner of a lifetime achievement Grammy earlier this year, Prine was a virtuoso of the soul, if not the body. He sang his conversational lyrics in a voice roughened by a hard-luck life, particularly after throat cancer left him with a disfigured jaw.</p>
<p>He joked that he fumbled so often on the guitar, taught to him as a teenager by his older brother, that people thought he was inventing a new style. But his open-heartedness, eye for detail and sharp and surreal humor brought him the highest admiration from critics, from such peers as Bob Dylan and Kris Kristofferson, and from such younger stars as Jason Isbell and Kacey Musgraves, who even named a song after him.</p>
<p>In 2017, Rolling Stone proclaimed him &ldquo;The Mark Twain of American songwriting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prine began playing as a young Army veteran who invented songs to fight boredom while delivering the U.S. mail in Maywood, Illinois. He and his friend, folk singer Steve Goodman, were still polishing their skills at the Old Town School of Folk Music when Kristofferson, a rising star at the time, heard them sing one night in Chicago, and invited them to share his stage in New York City. The late film critic Roger Ebert, then with the Chicago Sun-Times, also saw one of his shows and declared him an &ldquo;extraordinary new composer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly noticed by America&rsquo;s most popular folk, rock and country singers, Prine signed with Atlantic Records and released his first album in 1971.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was really into writing about characters, givin&rsquo; &lsquo;em names,&rdquo; Prine said, reminiscing about his long career in a January 2016 public television interview that was posted on his website.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just sit and look around you. You don&rsquo;t have to make up stuff. If you just try to take down the bare description of what&rsquo;s going on, and not try to over-describe something, then it leaves space for the reader or the listener to fill in their experience with it, and they become part of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was among the many promoted as a &ldquo;New Dylan&rdquo; and among the few to survive it and find his own way. Few songwriters could equal his wordplay, his empathy or his imagination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I try to look through someone else&rsquo;s eyes,&rdquo; he told Ebert in 1970. His characters were common people and confirmed eccentrics, facing the frustrations and pleasures anyone could relate to. &ldquo;Sam Stone&rdquo; traces the decline of a drug-addicted Vietnam veteran through the eyes of his little girl. &ldquo;Donald and Lydia&rdquo; tells of a tryst between a shy Army private and small-town girl, both vainly searching for &ldquo;love hidden deep in your heart:&rdquo;</p>
<p>They made love in the mountains, they made love in the streams</p>
<p>they made love in the valleys, they made love in their dreams.</p>
<p>But when they were finished, there was nothing to say,</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause mostly they made love from ten miles away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He writes beautiful songs,&rdquo; Dylan once told MTV producer Bill Flanagan. &ldquo;I remember when Kris Kristofferson first brought him on the scene. All that stuff about Sam Stone the soldier-junkie-daddy, and Donald and Lydia, where people make love from ten miles away &ndash; nobody but Prine could write like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prine&rsquo;s mischief shined in songs like &ldquo;Illegal Smile,&rdquo; which he swore wasn&rsquo;t about marijuana; &ldquo;Spanish Pipedream,&rdquo; about a topless waitress with &ldquo;something up her sleeve;&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dear Abby,&rdquo; in which Prine imagines the advice columnist getting fed up with whiners and hypochondriacs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no complaint,&rdquo; his Abby writes back:</p>
<p>You are what you are and you ain&rsquo;t what you ain&rsquo;t</p>
<p>so listen up Buster, and listen up good</p>
<p>stop wishin&rsquo; for bad luck and knocking on wood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prine was never a major commercial success, but performed for more than four decades, often selling his records at club appearances where he mentored rising country and bluegrass musicians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt like I was going door to door meeting the people and cleaning their carpets and selling them a record,&rdquo; he joked in a 1995 Associated Press interview.</p>
<p>Many others adopted his songs. Bonnie Raitt made a signature tune out of &ldquo;Angel from Montgomery,&rdquo; about the stifled dreams of a lonely housewife, and performed it at the 2020 Grammys ceremony. Bette Midler recorded &ldquo;Hello in There,&rdquo; Prine&rsquo;s poignant take on old age. Prine wrote &ldquo;Unwed Fathers&rdquo; for Tammy Wynette, and &ldquo;Love Is on a Roll&rdquo; for Don Williams.</p>
<p>Others who covered Prine&rsquo;s music included Joan Baez, Johnny Cash, John Denver, the Everly Brothers, Carly Simon, George Strait, Miranda Lambert, Norah Jones and Old Crow Medicine Show.</p>
<p>Prine himself regarded Dylan and Cash as key influences, bridges between folk and country whose duet on Dylan&rsquo;s country rock album &ldquo;Nashville Skyline&rdquo; made Prine feel there was a place for him in contemporary music. Though mostly raised in Maywood, he spent summers in Paradise, Kentucky, and felt so great an affinity to his family&rsquo;s roots there he would call himself &ldquo;pure Kentuckian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prine was married three times, and appreciated a relationship that lasted. In 1999, he and Iris DeMent shared vocals on the classic title track of his album &ldquo;In Spite of Ourselves,&rdquo; a ribald tribute to an old married couple.</p>
<p>In spite of ourselves we&rsquo;ll end up a-sittin&rsquo; on a rainbow</p>
<p>Against all odds, honey we&rsquo;re the big door-prize</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna spite our noses right off of our faces</p>
<p>There won&rsquo;t be nothin&rsquo; but big ol&rsquo; hearts dancin&rsquo; in our eyes</p>
<p>Prine preferred songs about feelings to topical music, but he did respond at times to the day&rsquo;s headlines. Prine&rsquo;s parents had moved to suburban Chicago from Paradise, a coal town ravaged by strip mining that inspired one of his most cutting protest songs, &ldquo;Paradise.&rdquo; It appeared on his first album, along with &ldquo;Your Flag Decal Won&rsquo;t Get You Into Heaven Anymore,&rdquo; which criticized what he saw as false patriotism surrounding the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>Many years later, as President George W. Bush sent soldiers to war, Prine had a song for that, too. In &ldquo;Some Humans Ain&rsquo;t Human,&rdquo; he wrote: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re feeling your freedom, and the world&rsquo;s off your back, some cowboy from Texas, starts his own war in Iraq.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prine&rsquo;s off-hand charisma made him a natural for movies. He appeared in the John Mellencamp film &ldquo;Falling From Grace,&rdquo; and in Billy Bob Thornton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Daddy and Them.&rdquo; His other Grammy Awards include Best Contemporary Folk Recording for his 1991 album &ldquo;The Missing Years,&rdquo; with guest vocalists including Raitt, Tom Petty, Bruce Springsteen and Phil Everly. He won Best Traditional Folk Album in 2004 for &ldquo;Beautiful Dreamer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prine didn&rsquo;t let illness stop him from performing or recording. In 2013, long after surviving throat cancer, he was diagnosed with an unrelated and operable form of lung cancer, but he bounced back from that, too, often sharing the stage with DeMent and other younger artists. On the playful talking blues &ldquo;When I Get to Heaven,&rdquo; from the 2018 album &ldquo;The Tree of Forgiveness,&rdquo; he vowed to have the last laugh for all eternity.</p>
<p>When I get to heaven, I&rsquo;m gonna shake God&rsquo;s hand</p>
<p>Thank him for more blessings than one man can stand</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;m gonna get a guitar and start a rock-n-roll band</p>
<p>Check into a swell hotel; ain&rsquo;t the afterlife grand?</p>
<p>He is survived by his wife, Fiona, two sons Jack and Tommy, his stepson Jody and three grandchildren.</p>
