Epic Games released a new event this month, with the Fortnite Deadpool skin and Challenges so far proving very popular with fans. But it looks like things aren’t over yet and a new stage in the Deadpool Challenge will happen during Week 8. From what has been shared online so far by leakers, a new variant of the Deadpool skin will be released very soon by Epic Games on PS4, Xbox, PC, Switch and Mobile.</p>
<p>HOW TO GET THE NEW DEADPOOL SKIN</p>
<p>According to the latest news from Fortnite leakers, a new version of the Fortnite Deadpool skin will become available to unlock during Week 8.</p>
<p>And that means the new Deadpool variant could be made available in the coming days, possibly on April 10.</p>
<p>We don’t have a set release date or time for when the next Challenges will go live, but it appears there will be two new ones launched by Epic Games next week.</p>
<p>These will make it possible to unlock an unmasked version of Wade Wilson, which will be available to Battle Pass owners.</p>
<p>Since Chapter 2 Season 2 launched, we’ve known that Deadpool would be the secret skin available closer to the end of the season.</p>
<p>But we didn’t know that there would be extra versions of the Deadpool skin, which has now been revealed.

Locals in Edlington have spotted the distinctive anti-hero patrolling the streets during the coronavirus lockdown.</p>
<p>But there’s nothing to fear.</p>
<p>For big hearted Dean Ashbridge has been donning the famed red and black costume of the Marvel Comics favourite to raise spirits among villagers and local children during the COVID-19 shutdown.</p>

<p>Comic and super hero fan Dean, 45, who lives in the village said: “The idea was given to me by somebody who saw me out in my mask.</p>
<p>“I have been building my suit to go to the local comic con which was cancelled due to the virus so I thought why waste it?</p>
<p>“I went out in just the mask initially just to maybe raise a smile.”</p>
<p>But then Dean, of Victoria Road, decided to step up his dressing up – by donning the characters full costume, complete with weapons.</p>

<p>He said: “The response has been absolutely overwhelming.</p>
<p>“I went out the first night to see the reaction and then people started asking me to visit their street, so next I&rsquo;m planning routes so I can cover the village which I have done once and now started again.”</p>
<p>Dean is using his tours as his permitted daily exercise – and ensures he’s following rules on social distancing.</p>
<p>He said: “I&rsquo;ve been delivering drawings to children with birthdays and such as well as some personal video messages for parents separated from parents due to quarantine</p>
<p>&ldquo;I use Deadpool just because he&rsquo;s just a little bit different to your average superhero and it appeals to my humour and personality.</p>
<p>The character first appeared in 1991 in comics and was depicted as a supervillain, but later evolved into his more recognizable antiheroic persona.

<p>Popular Battle Royale game Fortnite is currently enjoying a resurgence of sorts as gamers, hemmed in by social distancing and pandemic busting lockdowns, head online to relieve their boredom.</p>
<p>Fortnite&rsquo;s model of business is such that there is often new content to enjoy, to keep players coming back for more time and again.</p>
<p>In the past, we&rsquo;ve had crossovers with blockbuster movies like Star Wars and the recent Birds of Prey, and now another R-rated superhero franchise is coming to the game.</p>

<p>Post-modern antihero Deadpool has been making appearances in the game ever since the latest season kicked off on 20 February.</p>
<p>He himself is slated to make an appearance in the game soon, in the form of a brand new skin alongside loot, and a slew of special challenges.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s everything you need to know about it.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the Deadpool crossover event?</p>
<p>Ever since the beginning of Fortnite&rsquo;s current season, players have been able to access a brand new HQ as part of the game.</p>
<p>And also since the beginning of the season, that HQ has been littered with Deadpool Easter Eggs.</p>
<p>One of the game&rsquo;s recent challenges had players searching the HQ for &lsquo;Pool&rsquo;s chimichangas, his fast-food of choice.</p>
<p>In the last few days, players have been able to explore Deadpool&rsquo;s hideout, which is full of funny details - he&rsquo;s hoarding toilet paper for instance - and clues as to when the character will be available in the game.</p>
<p>When will the Deadpool skin be available in Fortnite?</p>
<p>One of those clues was a calendar featuring an image of the hero himself (of course).</p>
<p>The calendar was pretty definitive as to when Deadpool&rsquo;s skin might appear in Fortnite, with 3 April circled in bright red marker pen.</p>
<p>What will the challenges be?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s expected that alongside an opportunity to grab the Deadpool skin for yourself and run rampage across the Fortnite map, there&rsquo;ll be a number of new challenges for players to partake in.</p>
<p>So far, weekly challenges have tasked players with searching the HQ and hideout for items associated with the character, such as his trusty katana swords or&hellip; a toilet plunger?</p>
<p>The week 7 challenges go live at 2pm BST, and ask that you find Deadpool&rsquo;s two pistols.</p>
<p>You can do this by searching in the Battle Pass screen in either Deadpool&rsquo;s headquarters or the Agents tab; the guns should be found easily.</p>
<p>How do I unlock the Deadpool skin?</p>
<p>To get your hands on the Deadpool skin on 3 April, you&rsquo;ll need to complete each set of weekly challenges.</p>
<p>Previous weekly challenges related to the skin have been to left click on the computer in Deadpool&rsquo;s hideout to see the challenges, jump from the Battle Bus without thanking the driver, find his milk carton, look for his chimichangas, find a a toilet plunger, destroy a toilet, look for his katanas, and damage an opponent&rsquo;s structure.
