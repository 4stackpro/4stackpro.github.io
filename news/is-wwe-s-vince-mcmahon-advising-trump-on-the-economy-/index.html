<p>In mid-April 2020, controversy consumed the Trump administration over the goal of “reopening the economy,” meaning restarting commerce and businesses forced to shut down during the ongoing COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic.</p>
<p>In efforts to achieve this, U.S. President Donald Trump convened what he dubbed the “Great American Economic Revival Industry Groups,” a consortium of leaders from various industries, such as transportation, retail, banking, and hospitality. The names of those leaders were made available via an April 14, 2020 announcement from the White House.</p>
<p>Included on that long list was Vince McMahon, CEO Of World Wrestling Entertainment, better known as WWE.</p>
<p>A headline from the British tabloid Metro circulating on Facebook (“Donald Trump names WWE’s Vince McMahon as adviser to restart US economy”) highlighted McMahon’s involvement, prompting inquiries as to whether it was really true — and it was.</p>
<p>McMahon was among a total of 16 sports executives representing golf, football, basketball, Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), and NASCAR racing, on the White House’s list.</p>
<p>McMahon has a history with the president that includes being tackled and having his head shaved by Trump during WrestleMania’s “Battle of the Billionaires” in 2011.</p>
<p>Although McMahon was truly included in Trump’s advisory group announcement, his was far from the only name mentioned and he did not appear to have been given any special role compared to the other business leaders listed. So it appears as though his name may have been singled out in headlines for sensational effect.

<h3 id="vince-mcmahon-is-advising-donald-trump-on-the-economy-while-the-xfl-files-for-bankruptcy">Vince McMahon is advising Donald Trump on the economy while the XFL files for bankruptcy</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dnFvk-DKFOk4YgurWYyWLI9O51M=/155x239:2867x1659/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19900681/188033008.jpg.jpg" alt="img">
President Donald Trump has asked the most prominent owners in American sports to join him in an advisory group to discuss reopening the country during the coronavirus pandemic. Among those owners is WWE’s Vince McMahon, who runs one of the few remaining operations that has not postponed their programming. McMahon’s wrestling shows are still taking place live without fans.</p>
<p>McMahon and Trump are far from casual acquaintances. They both took part in WWE WrestleMania 23 in 2007 as part of an infamous hair vs. hair match. Trump was the victor there, shaving McMahon’s head in WWE’s biggest annual event. Trump later appointed Linda McMahon, former WWE CFO and Vince’s wife, to his cabinet, until 2019. She now runs the pro-Trump SuperPAC, America F1rst Action.</p>
<p>This might not be the first time you’ve seen McMahon’s name in the news this week. His recently rebooted XFL folded as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. What seemed like a promising start to his football league ultimately became a flop, just like his first attempt at an NFL competitor back in the early 2000s. The XFL first announced it would postpone its inaugural season, but later announced the league would shut down. It would eventually declare bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Recently, the state of Florida has deemed WWE an essential business, which allows McMahon to continue running his weekly wrestling programs live, though without an audience. WWE reportedly taped shows, including WrestleMania, up until May in case the government shut them down. That would have allowed the wrestlers to go back home and self quarantine.</p>
<p>Instead, Linda McMahon and her Trump SuperPAC promised to spend $18.5 million in Tampa and Orlando. The next day, Vince McMahon announced WWE would no longer tape shows in advance and would continue doing live shows. Wrestlers are reportedly unhappy with the situation, according to Fightful.</p>
<p>The reason behind continuing this may be due to television contracts, per Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer. McMahon’s deals with both USA and Fox allow for a limited number of taped episodes, which WWE may have already reached. Airing more taped shows would violate the respective agreements and give room for the networks to modify or cancel the television deals. As of now, McMahon is still willing to put his performers at risk in order to keep his current contracts.</p>
<p>WWE won’t have a full staff, as some of their top performers have opted not to compete during the coronavirus pandemic. Most notably, Roman Reigns was dropped from the WrestleMania WWE Universal Championship match against Goldberg. Reigns battled chronic myeloid leukemia in 2018 and was in remission in 2019. Wrestling live during this pandemic would only put him at higher risk.</p>
<p>All of this comes during a week where Vice aired their newest episode of the documentary series Dark Side of the Ring that focused on the murder of Nancy Argentino in 1983, allegedly by pro wrestler Jimmy “Superfly” Snuka. McMahon allegedly joined Snuka during a follow up with detectives. After the meeting, the case was not pursued for decades. It’s rumored McMahon had a role in that.</p>
<p>”I remember Vince McMahon being what Vince McMahon has always been — very effusive. He was very protective, a showman,” said Robert Steinberg, the assistant D.A. at the time. “He was the mouthpiece, trying to direct the conversation.”</p>
<p>Snuka was later charged with third-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter in 2015. The charges were dismissed because the judge found Snuka incompetent to stand trial.</p>
<p>WWE also released multiple wrestlers and producers on Wednesday.

The last five days have not been kind to WWE CEO Vince McMahon. On Friday, McMahon had to pull the plug on the XFL, with the football reboot going belly-up after being shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>On Monday, WWE returned to live production in its Orlando facility despite having an employee test positive for COVID-19. Both McMahon and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis were left open to criticism and backlash after having the WWE declared an “essential business.”</p>

<p>On Wednesday, TMZ reported the WWE is slashing salaries and payroll.</p>
<p>The cuts include furloughs, which take effect immediately. But the WWE notes the headcount reduction is only temporary.</p>
<p>In addition, the WWE is “reducing executive and board member compensation, decreasing operating expenses and cutting talent expenses, third party staffing and consulting.”</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, the WWE announced the release of five wrestlers.</p>
<p>BREAKING: WWE has come to terms on the release of Drake Maverick (James Curtin), Curt Hawkins (Brian Myers), Karl Anderson (Chad Allegra), EC3 (Michael Hutter) and Lio Rush (Lionel Green). We wish them all the best in their future endeavors. https://t.co/cX449nNSLU — WWE (@WWE) April 15, 2020</p>
<p>According to TMZ, the WWE believes these cuts will save the company $4 million per month and “assures its stockholders it has enough resources to continue operating &ndash; with approximately $500 million in cash and credit.”</p>
<p>McMahon is far from the only person suffering during the pandemic. Johns Hopkins University report there have been more than 600,000 cases of the coronavirus in the U.S.</p>
