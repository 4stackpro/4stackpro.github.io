It is terrifying to remember Ellis Park disaster - Nomvethe</p>
<p>Forty-three people perished in what remains the biggest tragedy in South African sport</p>
<p>Former striker Siyabonga Nomvethe has described the 2001 Ellis Park Stadium disaster as “a heart-breaking memory” as he paid tribute to the supporters who lost their lives in the darkest day of South African football.</p>
<p>More than 60,000 fans were crammed into Ellis Park for the Soweto derby between Kaizer Chiefs and , leading to a stampede which claimed 43 lives on April 11, 2001.</p>
<p>Nomvethe, then playing for Chiefs, was on the pitch when disaster struck.</p>
<p>“It is a heartbreaking memory. It is one disaster that I will never forget. No one would have expected something like that to happen,” Nomvethe told the Kaizer Chiefs official website.</p>
<p>“I still can’t believe this happened in our lifetime; it is terrifying to remember that night. This unfortunate disaster was a demonstration of how much South Africans support their football and more specifically the Soweto Derby.”</p>
<p>Nomvete recalls the ill-fated day which saw fans outside the stadium forcing entry into an already-overcrowded Ellis Park.</p>
<p>“I could hear the turmoil from the stands after Pirates equalised. That is when I could notice that something unusual was happening from the stands. There was more than the usual noise from the crowd. It was the first time I saw the supporters jumping over the stands in an attempt to watch us from the touchline,” Nomvethe said.</p>
<p>“That’s when we also realised that there was a problem. We realised the seriousness of the case when we were informed in the dressing room that a stampede happened, and people died in the process.</p>
<p>“To date, I can still see the agony in the eyes of everyone in the dressing room, that was when the message was delivered that a regrettable situation had occurred in the stadium.</p>
<p>“I had never seen so many people in and around the stadium – it was packed. We couldn’t drive out of the stadium. It was a mission to leave the stadium, and that is when we started understanding that the situation was really bad.</p>
<p>“Days that followed were not life as usual. Going back to training was tough. As youngsters, we relied on senior players like Doctor Khumalo for consolation.</p>
<p>“But it took a while for us to come to terms with what happened. I can say that this is one date that I will never forget.</p>
<p>“It is one hard lesson. This disaster has ensured that the security be intensified at the games. I wish the supporters will look back at this disaster and cooperate with these safety measures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ellis Park tragedy came after the same Soweto giants were involved in the 1991 Oppenheimer Stadium disaster where 42 people died in what is the second-worst sporting disaster in .

<h3 id="kaizer-chiefs-vs-orlando-pirates-the-party-that-brings-south-africa-together">Kaizer Chiefs vs Orlando Pirates: The Party That Brings South Africa Together</h3>
<p><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1200,h_630,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/5e8ef1ba8b1b39cdeb000001.jpeg" alt="img">
The Soweto Derby is part of 90min&rsquo;s 50 Biggest Derbies in the World Series</p>
<p>Not only do Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates have two of the coolest club names in world football, but they also have a hab​it of putting on some stellar showings when they come face to face in the Soweto derby.</p>
<p>The 2010 World Cup brought South African football to a global stage and gave the world a good idea of what to expect from clubs in the country. The football isn&rsquo;t always the greatest, but the atmosphere more than makes up for it. You can&rsquo;t take your eyes off it for one second.</p>
<p>Now, once you&rsquo;ve stopped singing some of British band Kaiser Chiefs&rsquo; best bangers, it&rsquo;s time to turn your attention to one of the most enthralling derbies around.</p>
<p>Pirates are the older of the two sides, having been kicking around since 1937. In the 1960s, they had a famous player called Kaizer Motaung, who took his skills over to North America to briefly turn out for Atlanta Chiefs.</p>
<p>He soon returned to South Africa and hoped to join back up with Pirates, but he found that the club wasn&rsquo;t the same anymore. The club&rsquo;s hierarchy were at each other&rsquo;s throats and several of Motaung&rsquo;s teammates were kicked off the team, and Motaung wasn&rsquo;t having it.</p>
<p>He split up to form his own side, mixing his own influence with his memories of Atlanta to form Kaizer Chiefs in 1970, and that&rsquo;s where the rivalry began.</p>
<p>“There was this kind of reluctance from the Pirates fans to accept that Kaizer was gone. And so Chiefs became a very bitter rival,&rdquo; Pirates chairman Irvin Khoza told ​New Frame .</p>
<p>&ldquo;The supporters can be too possessive and given what Kaizer had done for Pirates his departure to form another club was not easily accepted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first meeting between the two sides came in 1970 in third-place play-off of the Rogue Beer Cup. At stake was pride and a prize of $100, and it was Pirates who came out on top in an enthralling 6-4 victory.</p>
<p>Understandably, a score like that caught the eye of the South African audience, and their next clash in 1971 did exactly the same. Pirates took a 3-0 lead but threw it away to lost 4-3, and the country were sold.</p>
<p>These were two sides with a genuine rivalry who had a habit of putting on some of the best football on the continent. The stage was set.</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s important to note that this rivalry often used to be pretty ugly. There was a case of a brother stabbing and killing his own family member over the result of one of the games, while the two worst sporting disasters in South African history occurred during a Soweto derby.</p>
<p>The Ellis Park Stadium disaster saw 43 lives lost in a stampede as an extra 30,000 fans tried to force their way into the stadium to watch the game in 2001, and 42 were killed in similar circumstances at the Oppenheimer Stadium in 1991.</p>
<p>&quot; During that time of the violence in KwaZulu-Natal, we felt we could not just fold our hands and watch people killing each other. So we organised the Vodacom Challenge (a four-team competition launched in 1999 that saw the two sides face other teams from Africa) and took it there,” Khoza said.</p>
<p>Time to remember Oppenheimer Stadium in Orkney</p>
<p>“It is imperative to remember our fallen heroes and not forget that they died for the love of the beautiful game,” says Chairman Kaizer Motaung about the Orkney disaster. https://t.co/z90MAAdjOK#KaizerChiefs50 pic.twitter.com/StCyS8Obm2 — Kaizer Chiefs (@KaizerChiefs) January 13, 2020</p>
<p>That tournament brought people from all over Africa together over their love of football, and the South African fans had their eyes opened to how they should act. The violence was stopped. Fans were no longer attacking each other, but instead they were celebrating the magic of football.</p>
<p>Anyone who saw the 2010 World Cup will have seen South Africa&rsquo;s infectious approach to football. There&rsquo;s colour, costumes, music and a whole lot of vuvuzelas - it&rsquo;s basically one big, goofy party.</p>
<p>Pirates fans bring watermelons, bread and other food into the stadiums as a symbol of how the Chiefs will be &lsquo;eaten up&rsquo;. There was even an entire cooked pig&rsquo;s head. Others hold cabbages for luck and try and charm the vegetable using witchcraft.</p>
<p>Some dress as preachers and read from the Bible when their team misses an easy shot. Others wear bras and skirts to try and symbolise how Pirates are the &lsquo;mother&rsquo; of their rivals. It&rsquo;s mental.</p>
<p>“Of course we are competitors and for 90 minutes it is a war between the two clubs,&rdquo; Khoza added. &ldquo;We are the market leaders and there is tension naturally. But we are cooperating. We work together for the good of the game. We have a vibrant and dynamic league because we are able to be sober away from the madness of the 90 minutes.</p>
<p>“The rivalry is still there and you see it in every match we play. But remember that football is some kind of hospital which helps ease people’s pains. We build a feel-good factor for people in this country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure there is the hurt when a team loses because the bragging rights go to the others. But it was good for us to dilute the tension and the rivalry because now people no longer really fight over the match. The derby has become a place to be seen at, a fashion statement of sorts.”</p>

The Soweto Derby is one of the biggest rivalries not just in Africa, but the entire world. The Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates, two clubs from the Soweto township located in Johannesburg, South Africa, battle each other every year before sold out raucous crowds at some of South Africa’s largest stadiums. However, sometimes that fierce passion both fanbases exhibit for their teams in the largest rivalry on the continent has turned into tragedy.</p>
<p>Tragedy had struck this rivalry once before, in 1991 when a stampede before a friendly match in Orkney between the two teams claimed 42 lives. No one believed that a tragedy of that nature would occur again. Unfortunately, tragedy would strike again.</p>
<p>Ellis Park Stadium is one of the most famous stadiums in the world. It served for many years as South Africa’s national stadium for both soccer and rugby. Some of the greatest moments in South Africa’s sporting history occurred there. On April 11, 2001, it was the site of the greatest tragedy in South African sports history.</p>
<p>The scene was set for the Soweto Derby, and Ellis Park Stadium was the site of the fierce rivalry. The capacity for the stadium was around 60,000, but the stands were more than full. Due to fraudulent tickets and poor security, estimates were that the crowd was actually between 90,000 and 120,000 fans. With 30,000-60,000 fans with no seat, the concourses were packed as the match began, with fans spilling into press boxes and any other open space inside Ellis Park.</p>
<p>After Orlando Pirates equalized with a goal, a surge of fans pushed towards the field. Security was poorly trained, and in an effort to stem the crowd, they fired tear gas into the stands. That triggered a massive stampede, but there was nowhere for the people to go. Security couldn’t control the flow of people in the stands, and fans were crushed.</p>
<p>The match was abandoned, and the dying were laid on the field while rescue authorities tried to assist everyone and clear the stadium. In the end, they couldn’t save any of them. 43 people died that day at Ellis Park and 158 were injured, the deadliest sporting accident in the nation’s history. The youngest victim was only 11 years old. The tragedy prompted an inquiry into what happened, and poor crowd control coupled with security letting in tens of thousands of people without tickets led to the stampede.</p>
<p>Years later, the Soweto Derby is still the biggest rivalry in Africa. The rivalry continues this Saturday at FNB Stadium in Johannesburg. However, the dark day that was April 11, 2001 will forever be remembered between the two fanbases and all of South Africa. And while there have been a couple incidents since then of overcrowding, both teams are working hard to make sure that the Soweto Derby is remembered for the moments on the field and not for the tragedy that occurred off of it.</p>
