About 108 million U.S. adults — or some 45 percent of the adult population — are living with high blood pressure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Also known as hypertension, it is considered to be a reading of 130/80 or higher. The numbers represent the pressure that blood is exerting against your artery walls as your heart pumps it throughout your body. The first (or top) number indicates the pressure when your heart is beating, called systolic, and the second (or bottom) number indicates the pressure exerted while your heart is at rest, between beats, called diastolic. According to American Heart Association guidelines, normal blood pressure is 120/80 or less. Although some people develop hypertension because of an underlying health condition or medication, most often no precise cause exists, and it develops gradually over time. Stress and anxiety can cause spikes into hypertension range. But when the stress resolves, blood pressure returns to normal. Blood pressure regularly rises and falls throughout the day. It threatens health when it stays elevated. To treat hypertension, medication and lifestyle changes — healthier eating, regular physical activity, losing weight if needed and limiting alcohol consumption — are recommended. But the CDC says that half of those who should be taking medication to control seriously high blood pressure (140/90 or higher) are not doing so.

<h3 id="hypertension-is-most-common-pre-existing-condition-in-louisianas-coronavirus-fatalities-state-says">Hypertension is most common pre-existing condition in Louisiana&rsquo;s coronavirus fatalities, state says</h3>
<p><img src="https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/72/8728a7de-78ce-11ea-af0a-a383632d715d/5e8c77b8589a8.image.jpg?resize=945%2C630" alt="img">
Hypertension is the most common pre-existing condition among Louisiana residents who have died because of the new coronavirus, according to new data from state health officials.</p>
<p>The information, released Monday from the state Department of Health, shows that most people in Louisiana who have died from COVID-19 had underlying conditions.</p>
<p>As of Monday, 512 people have died in Louisiana from the new coronavirus. The most common pre-existing conditions in those patients were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hypertension (66.4%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diabetes (43.5%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chronic kidney disease (25.1%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obesity (24.7%)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Louisiana Department of Health started releasing data on pre-existing conditions two weeks after the state&rsquo;s first confirmed coronavirus death on March 14. In the early data, only 5% of victims had no pre-existing health condition.</p>
<p>The data Monday did not show how many victims didn&rsquo;t have underlying conditions, but it does indicate that some Louisiana residents who died from COVID-19 could have had more than one health concern. Among the other common issues found in patients were asthma, cancer, cardiac disease, congestive heart failure, neurological and pulmonary.</p>
<p>The most common underlying condition, hypertension, was not included the first time health officials released pre-existing health data March 27. At the time, diabetes was cited as the most common underlying condition at 40%.</p>
<p>+7 Coronavirus disparity in Louisiana: About 70% of the victims are black, but why? Roughly 70% of the people who have died from coronavirus in Louisiana are black, a striking disparity for a state where African-Americans make…</p>
<p>Health officials have stressed from the beginning that the virus is more fatal for the elderly and those with existing health problems.</p>
<p>When looking at cities most impacted by the coronavirus &ndash; New York City, Seattle and New Orleans &ndash; the Crescent City has higher percentages of its population that are diagnosed with high blood pressure, diabetes, COPD and chronic kidney disease, according to the Data Center.</p>
<p>Monday&rsquo;s update also showed that roughly 70% of the people who have died from coronavirus in Louisiana are black. Read more about what experts are saying.</p>

<h3 id="health-the-perfect-storm-for-hypertension--red-deer-advocate">Health: The perfect storm for hypertension – Red Deer Advocate</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.reddeeradvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/21191132_web1_200317-RDA-Gifford-Jones-brush-tongue_1.jpg" alt="img">
It’s a devastating time. A pandemic and economic disaster rolled into one that’s killing thousands and bringing society to a standstill. So how can we keep our blood pressure from shooting through the roof during this perfect storm? Keeping our heads cool may help to prevent a stroke, heart attack, even kidney disease and blindness.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization says that 1.3 billion people worldwide have hypertension or high blood pressure, including about one in three North Americans. But extensive research shows that hypertension, a silent killer, can be prevented and lowered.</p>
<p>In 1997 researchers published the results of a clinical trial called DASH (dietary approaches to stop hypertension). They concluded that a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, and reduced in total fat and saturated fat, reduced blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and coronary heart disease by six to 21 per cent.</p>
<p>Aim for foods that are rich in potassium and magnesium. For example, potassium in bananas, oranges, and leafy greens offsets the blood-raising effects of sodium by helping kidneys remove water from the body as urine. And magnesium in dark leafy greens and whole grains helps blood vessels to relax, decreasing blood pressure.</p>
<p>The most important message is to keep processed foods to a minimum. Why? Because they’re often loaded with salt that deters the lowering of blood pressure. Besides, packaged foods are high in sugar too, contributing to obesity. This column has informed readers for years that gaining excessive weight is to be avoided.</p>
<p>Remember the Gifford-Jones Law that says one problem leads to another and another. In this case obesity leads to Type 2 diabetes, then hardening of the arteries, hypertension, heart attack, and stroke. So, don’t let stressful time become an excuse for not stepping on the scale. Or failing to exercise.</p>
<p>So how much will your pressure drop from moderate exercise? This varies from person to person. The systolic pressure (the top number) will increase during exercise. Then drop back to normal and may fall 5 to 7 points for several hours. The drop in diastolic pressure (the bottom number) is usually smaller and more variable.</p>
<p>A report in the British Journal of Sports Medicine in 2018 concluded that exercise programs may reduce blood pressure in patients with hypertension as much as first-line medication. Studies also show that shorter and more frequent exercise can be as helpful as longer workouts.</p>
<p>What about building up muscles with weight lifting? Doctors used to warn patients with hypertension against it. But now the American College of Sports Medicine and the American Heart Association recommend that a combination of both is an effective way to decrease hypertension.</p>
<p>Readers may wonder what exercise is best. The choices in the current environment are limited. You may like a brisk walk with friends or a gym routine. But right now, the only wise choice is to exercise at home, being careful to avoid accidents. So several days each week, set aside time to work on your fitness. You’ll feel good if you do.</p>
<p>It’s always prudent to ask your doctor before starting a new exercise routine. For instance, some drugs that treat hypertension, such as beta blockers, make it difficult for the heart rate to increase to the desired levels.</p>
<p>It’s been aptly said that, “When the going gets tough, the tough get going.” Our current perfect storm will not pass quickly. Now is the time to buckle-down. Keep blood pressure from increasing by eating right and exercising well. We know ships get barnacles when tied up too long. So do humans!</p>
