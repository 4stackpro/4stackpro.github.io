Ramadan or ramzan is celebrated as the holy month when Muslims observe fasting from dawn to dusk and perform Namaz five times everyday. They consume their meal before dawn and after sunset. The essence of fasting throughout the day is to practice self restraint. It is also regarded as a period of introspection, community prayer (salat) and reading of the holy Quran.</p>

<p>According to the Holy Quran, Ramzan is one of the five pillars of Islam apart from a declaration of faith, daily prayer, charity and going for Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. Devotees end their fast by consuming dates before the grand Iftaar meal. During this month, Muslims dedicate themselves to self sacrifice such as avoiding alcohol, foods and physical needs. They seek forgiveness from Allah for their sins. This year Ramzan will begin from April 24. After the holy month of Ramadan ends, Eid-ul-Fitr takes place. This year Eid-ul-Fitr is likely to take place on May 23 or May 24, depending on the position of the Moon. This year due to coronavirus pandemic, people have been asked to maintain social distancing and celebrate the holy month with their families.</p>
<p>In order to make this occasion special for your friends, here are some wishes, images, quotes, messages, Shayari, Facebook and WhatsApp status that you can share:</p>
<p>Ramadan Kareem! May Allah give you prosperity and success. May Allah give you a healthy life and bless you with wealth and happiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fasting is a shield, it will protect you from the hell fire and prevent you from sins.&quot;- Prophet Mohammed</p>
<p>This Ramadan, May Allah bless you with Health and Happiness. Ramadan Mubarak</p>
<p>May the great Allah shower your path with light and knowledge. May this month be an enlightening celebration for all of us. Ramadan Kareem</p>
<p>May this Ramadan be as bright as ever. May this Ramadan bring joy, health and wealth to all of you.</p>
<p>May this Ramadan bring health, wealth and happiness in your life. Ramadan Mubarak</p>
<p>Dear Friend, Ramadan Kareem. I wish you all happiness and prosperity. May all your prayers be answered soon

<p><img src="https://www.arabnews.com/sites/default/files/2020/04/24/2076161-241776414.jpg" alt="img">
DUBAI: As the world celebrates the first day of Ramadan, A-list celebrities are taking to social media to wish their followers a happy month.</p>
<p>Models Shanina Shaik, Imaan Hammam and Halima Aden all posted messages through their Instagram accounts in honor of the special day.</p>
<p>Model Shanina Shaik shared her Ramadan wishes on her Instagram stories. (Instagram)</p>
<p>Iraqi beauty mogul Huda Kattan is also taking part in an Instagram initiative called #MonthOfGood, for which she nominated Aden, to motivate people to provide food for families in need.</p>
<p>“One of the main things that me and my family are dedicating our time to this #MonthOfGood is providing food for families who need it,” Kattan wrote on to her 2.1 million Instagram followers.</p>
<p>“This is something that our family focuses on every Ramadan, and it’s really eye-opening. We sometimes take some of the most basic things in life, like food, for granted.”</p>
<p>On behalf of his family, Mohamed Hadid — father of the US-Palestinian supermodels Gigi, Bella and Anwar Hadid — wrote on Instagram: “Peaceful Ramadan Kareem from the Hadid Family.”</p>
<p>He followed with another post showing his country of origin, captioned: “Ramadan Kareem from the 1000s of years Palestinian Olive tree in the courtyard of Jerusalem.”

<p>The new guidelines include conditions for visits and exercise during Ramadan.</p>
<p>In a joint circular today, MoHaP and NCEMA detailed the following guidelines: First, on allowing first and second degree relatives to visit while avoiding inviting those susceptible to infection, including the elderly and people with chronic diseases.</p>
<p>Second, the number of people present in a place at any one time may not exceed 5 individuals.</p>
<p>Third, the elderly, sick, and those with chronic health conditions are not allowed to leave home in order to ensure their safety.</p>
<p>Fourth, gatherings are not allowed in public or private places.</p>
<p>Fifth, tents and Ramadan majalis, both at home and in public places, are banned.</p>
<p>Sixth, it is prohibited to distribute food to individuals except in a collective manner under the supervision of charities and relevant government agencies.</p>
<p>Seventh, concerning exercising, the Ministry and the Authority recommend the following: - Exercise should take place near one’s home (walking, running, and cycling) for up to two hours, with a maximum of three people at any one time, taking into consideration the relevant preventative measures, including maintaining a distance of two metres between each other and wearing masks.</p>
<p>Eighth, food should not be exchanged between residents of different homes.</p>
<p>Ninth, in the event that food is received from relatives or friends in the vicinity of one’s home, the appropriate handling of food in disposable sealed bowls must be ensured.</p>
<p>Tenth, congregational prayers, including Taraweeh, are permissible at home, provided that the worshippers are members of the same family residing in the same place.</p>
<p>Eleventh, for domestic helpers: - Domestic helpers are prohibited from meeting anyone outside the home. They also cannot receive food from an unknown source. They should be provided with the necessary protective equipment should they need to interact with people from outside. They must also be advised on the necessary precautions to follow in the event of receiving any parcels or goods from delivery services.</p>
<p>In all cases, compliance with the relevant precautionary procedures should be ensured, including constant hand washing with soap and water for no less than 20 seconds, and avoiding hand-to-face contact in order to prevent infection.
