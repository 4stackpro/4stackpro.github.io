Warren, who has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration’s halting response to the pandemic for months, has not previously revealed that her family was waging its own personal battle against the virus. She confirmed his death in a statement provided to the Globe and said the cause was the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Donald Reed Herring, the oldest brother of Senator Elizabeth Warren, died on Tuesday night in Norman, Okla., about three weeks after testing positive for the coronavirus.</p>
<p>“I’m grateful to the nurses and other front-line staff who took care of my brother, but it is hard to know that there was no family to hold his hand or to say ‘I love you’ one more time. And now there’s no funeral for those of us who loved him to hold each other close,” Warren said. “I will miss my brother.”</p>
<p>Herring was born in 1933 and attended the University of Oklahoma, but did not graduate, before enlisting in the Air Force, where he flew B-47 and B-52 bombers. He flew 288 combat missions in Vietnam, eventually becoming a B-52 squadron pilot and a squadron aircraft commander. He earned numerous decorations before retiring in 1973 as a lieutenant colonel and starting an auto-detailing business. In her statement, Warren described Herring as a natural leader with a quick, crooked smile.</p>

<p>Known as Don Reed, Herring was the oldest of Warren’s three brothers, and he leaves the other two, John Herring and David Herring. The trio became a silent fixture of their sister’s presidential campaign, because she spoke often of them as a link to her upbringing in a more conservative world, highlighting their military service and the fact that two of them — Don Reed and David — were Republicans who agreed with her on some fundamentals. They never spoke to the press, but all three appeared in video footage used by her campaign.</p>

<p>Don Reed Herring lived with his wife, Judith Anne Hart, in Newcastle, Okla., before his death, in a small house amid wide fields. According to information provided by his family, he had been diagnosed with cancer years ago and undergone treatment, and was hospitalized for pneumonia in February. He then moved to a rehabilitation center to recover. The family did not identify the center.</p>
<p>The coronavirus has posed a particular risk to people at inpatient care facilities. Other patients in the facility where Herring was staying had active cases, according to what the family was told, and he was tested for the virus in early April. He received a positive result the next day, but did not show symptoms of the virus for another 11 days.</p>

<p>Herring was moved to intensive care at Norman Regional Hospital on April 15 and died six days later. He was not on a ventilator.</p>
<p>The coronavirus has separated people around the country from loved ones fighting the illness, and that was no different for Warren’s family. Herring’s wife was unable to visit him in recent weeks. Warren spoke with him daily before he was transferred to the hospital, but that became more difficult to do as he grew sicker. She last spoke with him on Sunday, when he seemed to be doing better.</p>
<p>In addition to his siblings and his wife, Herring leaves his two sons, John and Jeffrey. His first wife, Nancy McKelvain, died in 1982 of leukemia after the two were married for about 27 years.</p>

<p>Herring was 16 years older than Warren, and she was a toddler when he joined the military at the age of 19.</p>
<p>“My first memory of Don Reed was when he left for the service and then of his wedding,” she wrote in her autobiography. “He was adventurous and dashing, and his very existence was like a distant light.”</p>

Thursday COVID-19 Updates: Elizabeth Warren&rsquo;s Brother Dies of Coronavirus, Mitch McConnell Gives “One of the Saddest, Really Dumb Comments of All Time&rdquo;</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s top necromancer ALEX WONG / GETTY NEWS</p>
<p>Some housekeeping: I put the day in these headlines as a reminder to myself. I keep thinking it&rsquo;s Friday today. Isn&rsquo;t it Friday? It&rsquo;s Thursday.</p>
<p>Few Americans trust Trump&rsquo;s info on COVID-19, according to a new AP-NORC poll. Here&rsquo;s what they found:</p>
<p>Just 28% of Americans say they’re regularly getting information from Trump about the coronavirus and only 23% say they have high levels of trust in what the president is telling the public. Another 21% trust him a moderate amount. Confidence in Trump is higher among his supporters, though only about half of Republicans say they have a lot of trust in Trump’s information on the pandemic—and 22% say they have little or no trust in what he says about the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Sen. Mitch McConnell suggested cash-short states could go bankrupt instead of receiving more federal aid: The comments drew strong rebukes from a number of governors. Gov. Cuomo of New York referred to McConnell&rsquo;s comments as “one of the saddest, really dumb comments of all time.”</p>
<p>Andrew Cuomo absolutely DESTROYS Mitch McConnell for his &ldquo;stopping Blue States bailouts&rdquo; comment:</p>
<p>“Sen. McConnell, who&rsquo;s getting bailed out here? It&rsquo;s your state that is living on the money that we generate”#MitchMcConnellpic.twitter.com/gWf4hSZpMu — Matt 👀 (@Anxious_Matt) April 23, 2020</p>
<p>Our gov is on The View today talking about our coronavirus response. I haven&rsquo;t watched the episode yet but I love Joy&rsquo;s &ldquo;I Love New York&rdquo; sweater. Also, Jay keeps using his &ldquo;dial&rdquo; metaphor.</p>
<p>Washington Gov. @JayInslee says states planning to reopen as soon as this week “should not be happening,” calling it “a disappointing decision… for a lot of their citizens.”</p>

<p>Last week, Washington received over 82,000 initial claims for unemployment insurance: Nationally, 4.4 million people sought unemployment last week.</p>
<p>Washington&rsquo;s most recent update from its Department of Health lists 692 deaths and 12,494 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Washington state.</p>
<p>Facebook says it&rsquo;s removing Facebook events that violate stay-home orders: Media Matters found that they haven&rsquo;t removed many of them.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Warren announced that her brother died of COVID-19 complications Tuesday night: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m grateful to the nurses and frontline staff who took care of him, but it&rsquo;s hard to know that there was no family to hold his hand or to say &lsquo;I love you&rsquo; one more time, and no funeral for those of us who loved him to hold each other close,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll miss you dearly my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My oldest brother, Don Reed, died from coronavirus on Tuesday evening. He joined the Air Force at 19 and spent his career in the military, including five and a half years off and on in combat in Vietnam. He was charming and funny, a natural leader. https://t.co/b8m0xKzAmM — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) April 23, 2020</p>
<p>Ugh: Conspiracy theories are already racing around social media accusing Waters and Warren of lying about their relatives being sick and dying of coronavirus.</p>

<p>Dr. Rick Bright will be filing a whistleblower complaint with the Department of Health and Human Services’ inspector general, his lawyers announced Thursday. Bright claimed yesterday that he was “involuntarily transferred” from his Health and Human Services position after bringing up concerns about hydroxychloroquine.</p>
<p>The House is expected to pass the next $484 billion coronavirus aid package very soon. Here&rsquo;s what it covers:</p>
<p>The bill will provide an immediate $321 billion infusion for the Paycheck Protection Program, the small business rescue fund that ran out of money last week. The $484 billion package also provides another $60 billion in economic disaster loans for small businesses, $75 billion in emergency relief for hospitals and $25 billion to ramp up coronavirus testing.</p>
<p>SDOT is opening 6 more miles of its &ldquo;Stay Healthy Streets&rdquo; this Friday: &ldquo;We’re aiming to convert approximately 15 miles to Stay Healthy Streets in the coming weeks,&rdquo; SDOT wrote on their blog today. &ldquo;We will continue to evaluate the effort and work with community and stakeholders on recommendations for improvement. Additional closures will be subject to change based on new orders, construction, and availability of our crews and signs.&rdquo; Here&rsquo;s where the new Stay Healthy Streets will be located:</p>

<p>8:30 pm: San Francisco begins closing off some streets to encourage social distancing</p>
<p>San Francisco began closing off some residential streets to daytime traffic this week. The closure is part of its &ldquo;Slow Streets&rdquo; initiative, announced on Monday by Mayor London Breed. The closures are meant to give pedestrians and bikers a way to get around, without violating physical distancing orders, and without having to crowd onto sidewalks or dodge traffic. The selected thoroughfares in San Francisco are only open to pedestrians, bikers, vehicles making deliveries to local residents or businesses, and emergency responders during the day. The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency shared images on social media of people maintaining a good physical distance from each other while strolling down Golden Gate Avenue in the city&rsquo;s Tenderloin neighborhood. Neighboring Oakland implemented a similar initiative with fitness in mind earlier this month. —Lora Kolodny</p>
<p>8 pm: Dubai opens restaurants and cafes, resumes public transportation</p>
<p>Dubai on Thursday allowed cafes and restaurants to resume business, and shopping malls to be opened partially from 12 p.m until 10 p.m, but with a maximum capacity of 30%, Dubai&rsquo;s media office announced in a statement. The statement added that it would also allow resuming public transportation services including subways starting April 26. —Reuters</p>
<p>7:40 pm: United Airlines will require flight attendants to wear masks. The labor union wants passengers to wear them, too</p>
<p>United Airlines says effective Friday flight attendants will have to wear masks or other face coverings while on duty, a measure aimed at stopping the spread of the coronavirus. The airline will provide flight attendants with surgical masks but they are also allowed to wear their own cloth masks. &ldquo;We understand that many aspects of the flight attendant&rsquo;s duties, both on and off the aircraft, can make practicing social distancing challenging, which is why this new initiative is so important,&rdquo; United said. While few travelers are currently flying because of the virus and stay-at-home orders airlines are rethinking precautions to stop the virus from spreading. The Association of Flight Attendants, which represents some 50,000 cabin crew members including those at United and asked for the measure at United, wants to go further. The union asked federal authorities to require that travelers as well as crews be required to wear masks to reduce the risk of spreading the disease. &ldquo;As some of the most frequent travelers, flight attendants feel a deep responsibility to ensure that our workplace risks of acquiring and spreading communicable diseases are minimized as much as possible,&rdquo; AFA&rsquo;s president, Sara Nelson, wrote in a letter to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.&rdquo; —Leslie Josephs</p>
<p>7:30 pm: Trump &lsquo;not at all happy&rsquo; with Georgia Governor Brian Kemp&rsquo;s plan to re-open businesses</p>
<p>Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp listens to a question from the press during a tour of a massive temporary hospital at the Georgia World Congress Center on Thursday, April 16, 2020, in Atlanta. Ron Harris | AP</p>
<p>President Trump said at a press conference that he was &ldquo;not at all happy&rdquo; with Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, who plans to re-open certain businesses in the state starting Friday, April 24, even though the Covid-19 outbreak is still a public health threat there. On Monday, Governor Kemp said the state would allow spas, tattoo parlors, salons, barbershops, bowling alleys, and soon movie theaters and restaurants to open up again in Georgia, as long as they implement physical distancing and other measures to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. The President said, of Kemp and his plans, on Thursday: &ldquo;I want the states to open much more than he does!&rdquo; But he added, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like to see spas opening, frankly. I wasn&rsquo;t happy with Brian Kemp. I wasn&rsquo;t at all happy.&rdquo; The President emphasized that he was leaving it up to governors to make decisions for their own states. Referring to small businesses, he said: &ldquo;I want them to open as soon as possible. And I want the state to open. But I wasn&rsquo;t happy with Brian Kemp.&rdquo; —Lora Kolodny</p>
<p>7:17 pm: Bill Gates explains what we need to do to stop the coronavirus pandemic and reopen the economy</p>
<p>Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates outlined what the world needs to do to stop the Covid-19 pandemic and reopen the economy in a blog post Thursday. Gates said the world must advance its treatments, vaccines, testing and contact tracing. It also needs to examine its policies for opening up global economies, he said. He compared the pandemic to a war. There were five areas he outlines as needing attention: Treatment: Gates acknowledged that many treatments may fail, but said he&rsquo;s optimistic some will be successful in reducing the coronavirus burden. Vaccines: &ldquo;Short of a miracle treatment,&rdquo; the only way for people to return to some sense of normal is through a vaccine, Gates said. Testing: Gates said the United States needs to prioritize and speed up Covid-19 testing to have results in one day. Contact tracing: Gates said that people who have been in close contact with someone who tested positive should be prioritized for testing and self-isolate. Opening up: Gates believes that most developed countries will enter the second phase of the pandemic in the next two months. That&rsquo;s where the world is semi-normal, though people still practice social distancing. &ldquo;During World War II, an amazing amount of innovation, including radar, reliable torpedoes, and code-breaking, helped end the war faster,&rdquo; Gates said. &ldquo;This will be the same with the pandemic.&rdquo; Gates has been vocal on the Covid-19 pandemic and has described its spread as a &ldquo;nightmare scenario.&rdquo; —Jessica Bursztynsky</p>
<p>6:58 pm: Updated map of global cases, which now total 2,708,590</p>
<p>6:53 pm: Trump says he may extend coronavirus social distancing guidelines to early summer</p>
<p>President Donald Trump said that his administration may extend its national social distancing guidelines until early in the summer or later. &ldquo;We may, and we may go beyond that,&rdquo; Trump said at a White House press briefing when asked if the federal guidelines would need to be extended at least until the start of summer. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have to see where it is,&rdquo; Trump said. &ldquo;I think people are going to know just out of common sense. At some point, we won&rsquo;t have to do that.

<p>6:41 pm: Pence says 16 states have released plans to lift coronavirus restrictions</p>
<p>Sixteen states have released &ldquo;formal reopening plans&rdquo; to lift coronavirus restrictions, Vice President Mike Pence said. &ldquo;At the present moment, 16 states have released formal reopening plans,&rdquo; Pence said at a news briefing. &ldquo;States are beginning to make those plans and we&rsquo;re encouraged to see so many states embracing the phased approach to reopening their economies that&rsquo;s contemplated in our guidelines for opening up America again.&rdquo; Missouri, Pennsylvania, Oregon and Idaho have all released plans to lift restrictions meant to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Pence said. The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC&rsquo;s request for the complete list of states. The administration is now also calling on states to resume elective surgeries, which were largely suspended as health systems sought to boost capacity for an expected surge of Covid-19 patients, Pence announced. He said several states have already unveiled plans to do so, including Arizona and Indiana. —Will Feuer</p>

<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration just green-lit a clinical trial at Columbia University to determine whether the plasma collected from Covid-19 survivors can effectively protect health care workers on the frontlines and alleviate symptoms in those who are severely ill. The study is funded by $2.5 million from Amazon. Using convalescent plasma &ndash; a component of blood &ndash; as a treatment is a decades-old idea, and has been used to treat other diseases like influenza and measles. When a patient recovers from a disease, they produce antibodies to fight the presence of the antigen that caused the disease, and those proteins will remain in the blood for a few months. The hope is that plasma from recovered coronavirus patients can be transfused into severely ill patients, helping them recover more quickly. It could also help health care workers develop some immunity. It&rsquo;s not an alternative to a vaccine, but researchers believe that the approach has potential. —Christina Farr</p>

<p>6 pm: UAW opposes restarting auto production in early-May</p>
<p>The United Auto Workers believes restarting U.S. auto production in early-May is &ldquo;too soon and too risky&rdquo; for its members, according to a statement released Thursday by UAW President Rory Gamble. &ldquo;At this point in time, the UAW does not believe the scientific data is conclusive that it is safe to have our members back in the workplace,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We have not done enough testing to really understand the threat our members face.&rdquo; Fiat Chrysler, as well as other automakers earlier this month, announced plans to resume production on May 4. General Motors and Ford Motor have not announced a timeframe to restart production, which is costing them billions in idled production. Most U.S. auto plants, including those for the Detroit automakers, ceased production in mid-March due to Covid-19. The Detroit automakers employ about 150,000 UAW members. Gamble&rsquo;s statement comes a day after discussions took place between Gamble and GM and Chairman CEO Mary Barra, Ford CEO and President Jim Hackett and Fiat Chrysler CEO Mike Manley about reopening plants. Gamble said the union is &ldquo;happy with the auto companies&rsquo; response and cooperation on working through the health and safety protocols we will need in the workplace when it is appropriate to restart.&rdquo; Automakers such as Tesla, Toyota Motor and Honda Motor, after several delays, have announced plans or are expected to restart production in early-May. —Mike Wayland</p>

<p>The House had the votes to pass a $484 billion package to bolster small businesses and hospitals ravaged by the coronavirus crisis and expand testing desperately needed to start the return to normal life. Donning face coverings and voting in alphabetical sets to cut the risk of infection, representatives were set to approve the bill easily. The House vote will send the proposal to President Donald Trump, who is set to sign it into law in the coming hours. Before the chamber cleared the plan to try to rescue a crumbling U.S. economy, it also approved a Democratic-majority select subcommittee to oversee the Trump administration&rsquo;s use of a $500 billion pool of aid for corporations, states and municipalities. Between votes, House staff swept through the chamber to clean and disinfect it. —Jacob Pramuk</p>
<p>5:30 pm: Google to cut marketing budgets by as much as half, directors warned of hiring freezes</p>
<p>Google is slashing its marketing budgets by as much as half for the second half of the year, according to internal materials viewed by CNBC. One email about the cuts went out to marketing employees this week, noting the budget cuts and a new hiring freeze for full-time and contract employees. &ldquo;There are budget cuts and hiring freezes happening across marketing and across Google,&rdquo; said one message from a global director sent to employees Wednesday. &ldquo;We, along with the rest of marketing, have been asked to cut our budget by about half for H2.&rdquo; A company spokesperon confirmed that some areas&rsquo; budgets are being cut by as much as half, but added that others may not be since it is still in the process of &ldquo;recalibrating.&rdquo; —Jennifer Elias</p>
<p>5:15 pm: Tech companies pull back on hiring, flashing another grim warning sign for the U.S. economy</p>
<p>Tech companies have pulled back sharply on hiring, adding to the cascade of negative economic shocks caused by the coronavirus outbreak. It&rsquo;s been roughly one month since the country&rsquo;s first stay-at-home order came down in the San Francisco Bay Area. In the weeks since then, shutdowns to control the pandemic&rsquo;s spread have unleashed havoc on industries ranging from retail to travel and tourism. The pace and scale of the economic damage have been striking. An additional 4.4 million Americans filed for jobless claims last week, bringing the total to 26 million over the past five weeks. And some economists are predicting the U.S. unemployment rate could soon eclipse 30% — up from a 50-year low of 3.5% in February. On the other side of the ledger, hiring trends are painting an equally distressing picture. And, despite the shift to remote work and the surge in demand for certain online services, tech is not immune to the pullback. —J.R. Reed</p>

<p>4:20 pm: WHO reports five-fold increase in cyber attacks, nearly 450 hacked emails</p>
<p>Nearly 450 emails and passwords linked to World Health Organization officials and others working on the coronavirus response were leaked online this week, the organization said in a statement. WHO said scammers have been impersonating officials in emails targeted toward the general public in order to obtain donations. The organization is now migrating affected systems to a more secure authentication system, the organization said. The leaked credentials did not put any WHO systems at risk because the data was not recent, the organization said. However, WHO said the attack did impact an older system used by current and retired staff as well as partners. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the organization has seen a dramatic increase in the number of cyber attacks directed at its staff, and email scams targeting the public at large. There have been five times the number of cyber attacks directed at the organization now than reported during the same period last year. &ldquo;It is deeply disappointing that as we and partners work to save lives from the virus, we are under attack in this way as well as on social media. This has to stop,&rdquo; WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote on Twitter. —Noah Higgins-Dunn</p>

<p>4:04 pm: 25% of US pork production hit by coronavirus closures, union says</p>
<p>Meatpacking plants responsible for 10% of beef production and 25% of pork production been affected by closures, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. As the coronavirus spreads among meatpacking workers who often work in close proximity, concerns are growing about potential meat shortages — and the nation&rsquo;s overall food supply. &ldquo;When they have to start closing these plants down or they have to spread the lines out for social distancing or slow them down in some ways, which we&rsquo;re calling for as it relates to these line speed waivers, it will in fact create some shortages in the stores,&rdquo; UFCW President Marc Perrone said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any doubt about it.&rdquo; The union, which represents 80% of beef and pork production workers, said that 13 packing and food processing workers have died after contracting Covid-19 and 5,000 have tested positive or been exposed. —Amelia Lucas</p>

<p>California reported 115 deaths due to Covid-19 over the past 24 hours, marking the &ldquo;deadliest day&rdquo; so far in the state&rsquo;s fight to contain the coronavirus, Gov. Gavin Newsom said. &ldquo;Yesterday was the deadliest day for this virus in this state. 115 human beings lost their lives, families torn apart,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s also a reminder we&rsquo;re not out of the woods yet.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s an 8.5% increase compared to deaths from the day before, Newsom said, adding that there was a 5.6% increase in the number of people who tested positive. The number of hospitalizations and people in intensive care due to Covid-19 both dropped, he said. Separately, Newsom signed an executive order that prevents debt collectors from garnishing CARES Act stimulus checks. The order is effective immediately and is also retroactive. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a debt collector and you did garnish those contributions, those checks, you gotta give them back,&rdquo; Newsom said at a press briefing Thursday. Newsom said that checks can be garnished if an individual owes child, spousal or victim support. —Will Feuer, Hannah Miller</p>

<p>Toyota Motor Corp said it expects to gradually resume North American production starting May 4 and will impose significant new safety procedures after it halted operations in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. The largest Japanese automaker said it expects production will be slow next month. The company added it is not yet clear when the industry will be allowed to resume operations in Mexico. Toyota will add temperature checks for all plant employees, personal protective gear, use &ldquo;touchless&rdquo; entrances and exits and will even bar non-emergency use of elevators. &ldquo;There is no going back to normal for the foreseeable future,&rdquo; said Toyota Motor North America chief administrative officer Chris Reynolds, who said he expects production will ramp up later in May &ldquo;to meet consumer demand.&rdquo; —Reuters</p>

<p>European Leaders agreed to revamp its long-term budget and set up a massive recovery fund to tackle the impact of the coronavirus and help rebuild the 27-nation bloc&rsquo;s ravaged economies. &ldquo;There is only one instrument that can deliver this magnitude of task behind the recovery and that is the European budget clearly linked to the recovery fund,&rdquo; European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. However, deep differences remain over the best way to achieve those goals, as hard-hit countries like Spain and Italy are urgently in need of funds. They lack confidence that relatively wealthier northern EU partners who have suffered less from the disease are willing to take swift, sweeping measures backed by real economic firepower. —Associated Press</p>

<p>3:00 pm: JPMorgan tells small business customers to apply with other banks on fear that funds will run out</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase is warning some customers that even if fresh funds for the federal small business relief program are approved, the money won&rsquo;t last and they might be better off applying elsewhere. JPMorgan on late Wednesday emailed thousands of customers who have applied to the Paycheck Protection Program to say that while Congress is headed towards replenishing the effort, the bank is concerned &ldquo;that funds could run out again quickly,&rdquo; according to a copy obtained by CNBC. The bank, which has been inundated with requests for more than $40 billion in loans since April 3, has placed customers in one of four categories indicating the progress of applications. Those furthest back in line are in Stage 1, and they received the starkest language: &ldquo;Your application is still in Stage 1, with an extremely large volume of applications ahead yours,&rdquo; the bank said. &ldquo;We wanted to give you this information, so that you can decide if you would like to try applying with another lender.&rdquo; —Hugh Son</p>

<p>Stocks were taken for a wild ride that showed just how important finding a treatment for the coronavirus is for Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slashed a 400-point gain and nearly went negative after The Financial Times said — citing documents accidentally published by the World Health Organization — that Gilead Sciences&rsquo; drug remdesivir did not improve patients&rsquo; condition or reduce the coronavirus pathogen in their bloodstream. Those findings, according to the report, came from a clinical trial in China. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite cut their gains on the report, while Gilead was briefly halted for volatility. —Fred Imbert, Thomas Franck</p>

<p>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo tore into Sen. Mitch McConnell over the Senate Republican leader&rsquo;s support for letting states declare bankruptcy as they grapple with the coronavirus pandemic. &ldquo;This is one of the really dumb ideas of all time,&rdquo; Cuomo, a Democrat, said during a press conference in Albany. &ldquo;You will see a collapse of this national economy&rdquo; if states such as New York and California declare bankruptcy, Cuomo said. &ldquo;So just don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; On Wednesday, McConnell, of Kentucky, told radio host Hugh Hewitt that he supports allowing states to declare bankruptcy rather than getting federal money to cover budget shortfalls as tax revenue dives. —Kevin Breuninger, Jacob Pramuk</p>
<p>1:35 pm: Gilead says draft of coronavirus treatment results contains &lsquo;inappropriate characterization&rsquo; and are &lsquo;inconclusive&rsquo;</p>
<p>Gilead Sciences said that a draft document showing disappointing results from a closely watched clinical trial of the company&rsquo;s treatment for the coronavirus contained &ldquo;inappropriate characterizations&rdquo; and that the study&rsquo;s findings were &ldquo;inconclusive.&rdquo; Shares of the biotech firm fell 4% in intraday trading after the Financial Times reported that antiviral Remdesivir did not improve Covid-19 patients&rsquo; condition or reduce the virus&rsquo; presence in the bloodstream in a phase 3 clinical trial, citing a draft document that was accidentally published by the World Health Organization. &ldquo;We regret that the WHO prematurely posted information regarding the study, which has since been removed. The investigators in this study did not provide permission for publication of results,&rdquo; a Gilead spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC. &ldquo;Furthermore, we believe the post included inappropriate characterizations of the study. Importantly, because this study was terminated early due to low enrollment, it was underpowered to enable statistically meaningful conclusions,&rdquo; according to Gilead. &ldquo;As such, the study results are inconclusive, though trends in the data suggest a potential benefit for remdesivir, particularly among patients treated early in disease.&rdquo; —Berkeley Lovelace Jr.</p>
<p>1:28 pm: Housing demand may have started to bounce back from coronavirus impact</p>
<p>Sales of both newly built and existing homes tanked in March, as potential buyers hunkered down and potential sellers pulled their homes from the market, both watching their economy in free fall from the coronavirus. Now, suddenly, buyer demand at least may be climbing back. Pending home sales — a measure of signed contracts, not closings — are about 32% lower annually now, according to research by Zillow. But the week-over-week change in pending sales turned positive in the week ending April 15. Pending sales were up 6.2% week over week as of the seven days ending April 19. Zillow also noted that web traffic on for-sale listings and requests to connect with real estate agents have grown in recent weeks as well. While web traffic to Zillow listings in some markets is still way down from a year ago, the national total jumped 13% annually for the week ending April 13. In 30 of the 35 largest metro areas, web traffic to for-sale listings was higher annually during the second week of April. Traffic was still lower in Pittsburgh, Detroit, Philadelphia, Boston and New York City. —Diana Olick</p>

<p>Britain&rsquo;s health minister Matt Hancock promised to expand coronavirus testing to all those considered key workers after the government faced criticism for failing to roll out mass checks. Previously only healthcare employees and those working in nursing homes have been able to get tests. The government classifies as key workers people working in jobs such as teachers, government employees and delivery drivers. &ldquo;We can make it easier and faster and simpler for an essential worker in England who needs a test to get a test,&rdquo; Hancock told reporters. &ldquo;This all applies to essential worker households too.

<p>12:29 pm: 44 states are already paying the extra $600 in additional unemployment benefits</p>
<p>While the number of Americans without jobs keeps rising, more states are stepping in to provide expanded unemployment benefits. About 4.4 million new workers applied for unemployment during the week ending April 18, bringing the total number of out-of-work Americans to 26.5 million over the past five weeks, the Labor Department reported. &ldquo;With the nation unable to mount the public health response needed to re-open businesses, unemployment benefits are carrying the weight and serving as the last line of defense for millions of struggling families,&rdquo; says Andrew Stettner, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation and a leading unemployment expert. But there is some good news. As of April 22, 44 states have started making $600 weekly payments from the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation program that was put in place as part of the $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package Congress passed in late March, a Department of Labor spokesperson tells CNBC Make It. —Megan Leonhardt</p>

The state randomly tested 3,000 people at grocery stores and shopping locations across 19 counties in 40 localities, Cuomo said. &ldquo;What we found so far is that the state-wide number is 13.9% tested positive for having the antibodies. What does that mean? It means these were people who were infected and who developed the antibodies to fight the infection,&rdquo; he said. —Noah Higgins-Dunn</p>

Herring had been hospitalized for pneumonia in February and was later moved to a rehabilitation center, where other coronavirus cases were present, according to the Globe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m grateful to the nurses and frontline staff who took care of him,&rdquo; Warren, D-Mass., said on Twitter later Thursday morning. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s hard to know that there was no family to hold his hand or to say &lsquo;I love you&rsquo; one more time—and no funeral for those of us who loved him to hold each other close.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll miss you dearly my brother,&rdquo; Warren said. —Kevin Breuninger</p>
<p>11:24 am: House antitrust chairman says most mergers should be banned during the pandemic</p>
<p>House Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline said most mergers should be banned while the coronavirus pandemic devastates businesses across industries. The Rhode Island Democrat is seeking to include the merger ban in the next stimulus deal, according to his prepared remarks for an event Thursday with the Open Markets Institute, a group that advocates for strong enforcement of antitrust laws. Under Cicilline&rsquo;s proposal, only mergers of businesses that have declared bankruptcy or are about to fail should be allowed during the national emergency. Ciclline&rsquo;s subcommittee is currently investigating Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google parent company Alphabet as part of a review of digital markets. He originally planned to wrap up the investigation and publish a report by early April, but has acknowledged the pandemic has shifted that timeline. Cicilline previously told CNBC the report would lead to regulatory proposals to make sure the digital marketplace is operating fairly. —Lauren Feiner</p>

<p>Delta and United have reported their first quarterly losses in more than five years. Their competitors are also expected to release dismal results in the coming weeks. The next few months look even more painful for the sector as the coronavirus pandemic saps air travel demand during what is normally the most lucrative time of year. Air travel has dropped by more than 95% as the Covid-19 pandemic spread around the U.S. Now, states hard-hit by the pandemic like New York are extending stay-at-home advisories for the next several weeks and canceling events through June in New York City, a sign that business isn&rsquo;t even close to returning to normal yet. Bleak economic data and a rising unemployment rate are raising doubts about when travelers will return. &ldquo;People are fearing for their homes, not their holidays,&rdquo; said Rob Morris, global head of consultancy at Ascend by Cirium, a U.K.-based aviation consulting firm. —Leslie Josephs</p>
<p>11:17 am: Coronavirus could cause malaria deaths to double in sub-Saharan Africa, WHO says</p>
<p>Malaria deaths could double in sub-Saharan Africa this year compared to 2018 because of the coronavirus, according to a statement from the World Health Organization (WHO). The Covid-19 pandemic has caused severe disruptions in delivering insecticide-treated nets and reduced access to antimalarial medicines, according to a new modeling analysis from WHO. WHO said countries should move quickly in delivering malaria prevention and treatment tools, and maintain essential malaria control services in a safe manner. Sub-Saharan Africa represents only a small proportion of total global cases of Covid-19, though cases are increasing every week, according to WHO. The health organization said countries in the region have &ldquo;a critical window of opportunity&rdquo; that should be used to minimize disruptions in malaria prevention. The region accounted for approximately 93% of all malaria cases and 94% of deaths in 2018, according to WHO&rsquo;s &ldquo;World malaria report 2019.&rdquo; —Hannah Miller</p>
<p>11:14 am: NYC&rsquo;s top health official says city&rsquo;s confirmed cases are &lsquo;tip of the iceberg&rsquo;</p>
<p>Confirmed coronavirus cases in New York City are just &ldquo;the tip of the iceberg,&rdquo; New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot said Thursday, adding that &ldquo;close to a million&rdquo; residents have probably been exposed to Covid-19. More than 147,000 people in New York City have so far tested positive for Covid-19, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. &ldquo;That really I think is the tip of iceberg for a number of different reasons,&rdquo; Barbot said at a news briefing. &ldquo;New Yorkers have been heeding to our advice that if they have mild symptoms, at this point in time, when you&rsquo;ve got community-wide transmission, having a test result isn&rsquo;t going to change what we&rsquo;re going to tell you to do.&rdquo; —Will Feuer, Jasmine Kim</p>
<p>11:08 am: US issues new guidance for small business loans to make it harder for public companies to get funds</p>

<p>The Small Business Administration issued new guidance that makes it &ldquo;unlikely&rdquo; that big publicly traded companies will be able to access the next round of funding for the U.S government&rsquo;s small business relief program. The update comes after a public furor that large companies tapped the facility, known as the Paycheck Protection Program, for hundreds of millions of dollars in loans while thousands of small businesses have yet to receive funding. Companies applying for the coronavirus relief funds must certify that the loans are necessary and that they cannot tap other sources of funding, the SBA said. By definition, public companies have access to the capital markets. For instance, Shake Shack said it returned the $10 million it got through the PPP after it sold $150 million in new shares. &ldquo;Borrowers still must certify in good faith that their PPP loan request is necessary,&rdquo; the SBA said. &ldquo;It is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith, and such a company should be prepared to demonstrate to SBA, upon request, the basis for its certification.&rdquo; —Hugh Son</p>
<p>10:31 am: House set to pass $484 billion bill to boost small business, hospitals, and testing</p>
<p>The House plans to pass a $484 billion coronavirus relief bill to replenish a small business aid program, fund hospitals, and expand testing. The measure&rsquo;s expected approval in the afternoon will send it to President Donald Trump&rsquo;s desk for his signature. The Senate cleared the legislation on Tuesday in a unanimous vote. Congress will pile more money into an unprecedented rescue of the economy and health care system that will approach $3 trillion in total with the plan&rsquo;s passage. The cash injection into the small business loan program, designed to keep employees on payroll during the pandemic, will follow a government report Thursday showing more than 26 million people filed unemployment insurance claims over the latest five-week period.

<p>10:20 am: US new home sales fall sharply in March</p>
<p>Sales of new U.S. single-family homes dropped by the most in more than 6.5 years in March and further declines are likely as the novel coronavirus outbreak batters the economy and throws millions of Americans out of work. The Commerce Department said on Thursday new home sales fell 15.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 627,000 units last month. The percentage decline was the largest since July 2013. February&rsquo;s sales pace was revised down to 741,000 units from the previously reported 765,000 units. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast new home sales, which account for about 10% of housing market sales, plunging 15% to a pace of 645,000 units in March. —Reuters</p>
<p>9:48 am: Vet telehealth surges as first US pets test positive</p>
<p>Telehealth platform Medici saw overall veterinarian registration for telemedicine spike by 48% in March, and pet telehealth consultations rose by 170% month over month, after the FDA relaxed guidance on virtual visits for animals in late March. Medici</p>
<p>As human telehealth visits are forecast to surge past 1 billion this year, the veterinary industry is following suit, at least for now, in order to reduce the spread of coronavirus. On March 24 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced it would temporarily suspend a requirement for veterinarians to examine animals in person before beginning telemedicine in order to &ldquo;limit human-to-human interaction and potential spread of Covid-19.&rdquo; The decision came at a good time: On Wednesday the first cases of positive coronavirus tests in U.S. domestic pets, in two New York area cats, were confirmed, along with four more tigers and three lions at the Bronx Zoo. On April 6 the first tiger to test positive for the virus, at that same zoo, tested positive. The measure, along with an April 30 extension of federal social distancing guidelines, has resulted in a widespread migration to virtual animal care. —Sully Barrett</p>

<p>9:28 am: Leon Cooperman says the crisis will change capitalism forever and taxes have to go up</p>
<p>Leon Cooperman Scott Mlyn | CNBC</p>
<p>Billionaire investor Leon Cooperman said on CNBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Squawk Box&rdquo; that the coronavirus crisis will &ldquo;likely&rdquo; change capitalism forever and that taxes will need to be raised soon. &ldquo;When the government is called upon to protect you on the downside, they have every right to regulate you on the upside,&rdquo; Cooperman said. &ldquo;So capitalism is changed.&rdquo; The chairman and CEO of Omega Family Office said the country is shifting to the left and that taxes will have to go up regardless of who wins the presidential election in November. &ldquo;Quickly if Biden wins, slowly if Trump wins, but taxes have to go up. So things like carried interest, capital gains taxes, the ability to roll over real estate sales tax-free, all that stuff is going to have to be eliminated. For the good, by the way,&rdquo; Cooperman said. —Jesse Pound</p>

<p>Gap said its existing cash and the cash it expects to bring in might not be enough to sufficiently fund its operations, as its stores remain temporarily shut because of the coronavirus pandemic. The apparel company said in a securities filing that it must take further actions to find liquidity over the next 12 months, such as additional job cuts and new debt financing. It added that beginning this month, it stopped paying rent on its temporarily shuttered stores, which amounts to roughly $115 million in monthly expenses in North America. —Lauren Thomas</p>

<p>7:54 am: Target sees &lsquo;Cyber Monday&rsquo;-sized online sales boom</p>
<p>Target has seen a sharp increase in online sales, as shoppers try to limit time inside stores or avoid the trips altogether during the coronavirus pandemic, CEO Brian Cornell said. Since its fiscal first quarter began Feb. 2, Target&rsquo;s same-store sales have risen more than 7%. The gain, which compares with an increase of 1.5% in the fiscal fourth quarter, is the result of a doubling of its online sales, partially offset by declines inside its nearly 1,900 brick-and-mortar stores. In an interview with &ldquo;Squawk Box,&rdquo; Cornell said Target is trying to figure out if customers&rsquo; new shopping patterns are here to stay. &ldquo;We are spending a lot of time trying to understand how the pandemic is going to change the future of how American consumers shop, how they live, how they work, the things that they value,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s been really hard to predict week by week.&rdquo; —Melissa Repko</p>
<p>7:49 am: Another 4.3 million workers expected to have filed unemployment claims</p>
<p>The Labor Department will release the number of jobless claims filed in the week ended April 18 at 8:30 a.m. ET. Another 4.3 million workers are expected to have filed state unemployment claims last week, according to Dow Jones. That would bring the total number seeking benefits to over 26 million since states started shutting down in the second half of March to stop the spread of the coronavirus. The number of jobs lost rose to 22.025 million over the prior four weeks, erasing nearly all of the 22.442 million jobs recovered since the Great Recession. —Patti Domm</p>

<p>6:59 am: Tyson Foods shutters two major pork plants, tightening US meat supply</p>
<p>Tyson Foods is shuttering two pork processing plants, including its largest in the United States, after employees tested positive for Covid-19, further tightening meat supplies after other major slaughterhouse shutdowns. The closures are limiting the amount of meat the U.S. can produce during the outbreak and adding stress on farmers who are losing markets for their pigs. Lockdowns that aim to stop the spread of the virus have also prevented farmers around the globe from delivering food products to consumers. Millions of laborers cannot get to fields for harvesting and planting, and there are too few truckers to keep goods moving. Tyson Foods, the largest U.S. meat supplier, said it will indefinitely suspend operations at its largest pork plant in Waterloo, Iowa, after operating at reduced capacity. —Reuters</p>
