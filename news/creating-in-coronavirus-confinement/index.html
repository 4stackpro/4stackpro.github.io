Stringy lines of brown and splashy blobs of burgundy embellished psychedelically with bright colors depicting faces, figures and shapes might look like a doodle or stain to some, but for artist Kim Klabe, it&rsquo;s a precise and thoughtful process.</p>
<p>Observers of Klabe’s designs will inevitably ask if she was “drinking while creating,” or was it an accidental spill she thought looked artistic. To both she answers an emphatic “No!”</p>
<p>“I look at this as work – very, very enjoyable work. If I was sloshed, my work would be sloppy. I like to have focus so my creativity isn&rsquo;t dulled,” Klabe said. “The wine and beer pours are crazy-looking, and that all comes out of my imagination naturally.” Even though the paintings have a psychedelic look, they are not influenced by drugs either, she said.</p>
<p>“I began working in wine and beer pours in August of 2017,” Klabe said. After working in oils and watercolors for over 30 years, painting had become stifling, and boredom had set in. She had no intention of doing anything with these initial pours, other than for entertainment and blowing off steam.</p>
<p>The first three pours were titled &ldquo;No Collusion,&rdquo; &ldquo;Dossier&rdquo; and &ldquo;State of the Union,&rdquo; which she completed while watching the State of the Union address in 2017.</p>
<p>“I posted them on Facebook just for fun, and they sold right away,” she said. The simple and creative pours were not only enjoyable to Klabe, but other people enjoyed and related to them as well. “That sealed the deal for me,” she said. “I put my oils away and replaced the easel with a drawing table.”</p>
<p>Klabe has always been an artist; when she was a college student at University of Delaware, her desire to attend art school was crystal clear. She transferred to Antonelli Institute of Art and Photography in York, Pa., and finished her degree. Earning a major in art and minor in English from UD in 2005, she has worked professionally as an artist since. Most recently, she was education director for the Rehoboth Art League.</p>
<p>Beginning with a heavy watercolor paper, Klabe chooses a dark beer, such as Guinness or Milk Stout, or a red wine. The shades of the wine pours will change depending on the type of grape. “Cabernet is different from pinot noir, for example. Some wines dry grayish, some are deep purple, some are more red; they are all unique,” Klabe said.</p>
<p>After the pour, Klabe lets the liquid dry, then takes a look at the stain to see what shapes appear. “Sometimes I have no direction for the final outcome, and discover as I go along. All you can do when you are pouring is hope,” Klabe said.</p>
<p>The shapes of the pour are then defined with markers and colored pencil. Klabe leaves some parts of the stain untouched, while other areas are covered fully or partially, but the integrity of the pour remains.</p>
<p>The wine and beer pours are each one of a kind. Klabe wants the actual wine or beer on the paper. “The paper I use is very textured, and the effect that is created with the marker and pencil would be hard to capture in a reprint,” she said. All originals are sprayed with archival spray varnish, which protects the work from fading or smudging.</p>
<p>Klabe says it&rsquo;s hard to pick a favorite. “I fall a little bit in love with most of them. One favorite is ‘Tell Me About Yourself,’ part of a series called Barflies. It’s the guy you meet in a bar who you strike up a casual conversation with. You ask, ‘Tell me about yourself,’ and you get far more than you bargained for. An hour later, he&rsquo;s still talking, and you have found out more than you needed to know!” she said.</p>
<p>More than 100 works are archived on her website; nearly 50 are available for purchase, and she makes up to seven each week. The quarantine hasn’t affected creativity for Klabe. She works full time but still makes time for the beer and wine pours during evenings and on weekends. However, what looked like a full summer of shows is quickly becoming a quiet summer.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be very hard for artists and organizations who raise money with art shows and festivals, which is very sad. In lean times people conserve money, which is understandable, and art takes a back seat,” she said.</p>
<p>Due to the shutdown, many shows are cancelled or online, and the typical way Klabe is able to interact with artists and enthusiasts is gone. To satisfy her desire to talk about her art, she began making videos to talk about specific pours, mistakes, and risks, and she even shows a pour taking shape in time lapse.</p>
<p>Klabe is using the COVID-19 lockdown to feed her creative process. With her current works, “Covid and Caduceus,” a doctor being crowded out by the virus; “Tired Mother Earth” healing due to less human activity; “Social Distancing,” and “Cover Your Mouth,” the artist is capturing history with wine, beer, pencils and pens.</p>
<p>Klabe embraces the change of the art scene. “Thank goodness for art when you are stuck in the house, because you always have something to do when you have ideas and supplies,” she said.</p>
<p>“There is another side to this. We will all get there together and appreciate things even more than we did before,” she said.</p>
<p>Videos and Klabe’s art can be found at KimKlabe.com or on YouTube at Kim Klabe Wine and Beer Pours. Follow Kim Klabe Wine and Beer Pours on Facebook. Purchases from the website can be shipped or picked up, and there are accessible price points for everyone.

<p><img src="https://www.majorcadailybulletin.com/sfAttachPlugin/34231.jpg" alt="img">
Thoughts now turning to restarting activity. 25-04-2020</p>
<p>Shares:</p>
<p>The Council of Minorca is working on a special plan for the lifting of confinement. On Friday, the president of the Council, Susana Mora, explained that a group of experts will decide what can be activated once the state of alarm ends. She highlighted &ldquo;being able to do sport&rdquo; as part of a de-escalation plan that takes account of the situation in Minorca, although &ldquo;we are aware that the Spanish government will decide&rdquo;.</p>
<p>She called for caution regarding the opening of the airport and ports, stressing that any rise in coronavirus cases &ldquo;would be very hard for the Minorcan economy&rdquo;. &ldquo;We cannot open facilities while the situation is not under control elsewhere. We will not jeopardise the health of residents and visitors and nor will we harm the image of the island as a safe destination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mora added that a package of financial measures to mitigate the effects of the crisis will be unveiled next week and that the 2020 budget is being restructured in order to &ldquo;reach as many people as possible&rdquo;.

<h3 id="spain-will-scale-back-confinement-at-different-speeds-say-experts">Spain will scale back confinement at different speeds, say experts</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/haNbwPh1YNjdS-7eftLZ1UUF-rE=/1000x0/filters:focal(539x209:549x219)/arc-anglerfish-eu-central-1-prod-prisa.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BF76PKNELQVF2G3O26ORVJIQNM.jpg" alt="img">
On May 10, barring any further extensions to the state of alarm, Spain will start transitioning back to what many hope will be something similar to the life they had before the Covid-19 pandemic. But experts note that the deescalation will not take place at the same speed everywhere across the country.</p>
<p>“There are regions and provinces and islands where the risk of transmission is zero or close to it,” said Fernando Simón, head of Spain’s Health Emergency Coordination Center, on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Despite having some of the world’s strictest confinement measures – children will only be allowed out for an hour a day starting on Sunday – Spain has been one of the world’s hardest-hit countries, with an official death count of 22,157 victims and over 213,024 infections as of Thursday, although the real figure could be significantly higher. Authorities placed the country in lockdown on March 14, but new research suggests that the coronavirus was already circulating in Spain by mid-February.</p>
<p>On April 8, the Health Ministry announced that it would conduct a serological survey that would reveal the incidence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Spain, in line with similar studies already conducted or underway in other countries. But the survey, which should have been a key tool in designing Spain’s deescalation process, has been constantly delayed. According to the latest official statements, testing is due to start on Monday at the earliest and will last for eight weeks.</p>
<p>Difference by regions</p>
<p>While the health official Fernando Simón did not mention any specific regions at his Tuesday briefing, Health Ministry data released on Wednesday showed that registered coronavirus cases grew by less than 1% in the Canary Islands, Murcia and La Rioja, as well as in the exclave cities of Ceuta and Melilla on the northern coast of Africa.</p>
<p>“It’s within reach. If the evolution of the pandemic does not take a turn for the worse, in three weeks we’ll be able to go outside, regardless of the conditions that may be established,” said José Martínez Olmos, who teaches at the Andalusian Public Health School and served as a health official for the Spanish government between 2005 and 2011.</p>
<p>Health experts insist that easing confinement measures is a decision that depends on a reduction of transmission rates, on the healthcare system’s ability to cope with cases, and on the capacity to track infected people and their contacts.</p>
<p>But not all parts of Spain score the same in these categories. “The criteria [for easing the current measures] must be similar, but not everywhere at the same time,” said Simón.</p>
<p>“There will be initial elements in common, and others that might be managed at the regional and even the local level,” said Joan Ramon Villalbí, of the Spanish Society for Public Health and Health Management (Sespas). “There will be a series of small steps that might be faster or slower depending on the place.”</p>
<p>It is possible that at some point, and in some places, we may have to reintroduce temporary restrictive measures Andrea Burón, Spanish Epidemiology Society</p>
<p>“If in one region or for a specific group, the risk of transmission and contagion is lower, it would be not only logical but desirable to ease restrictions earlier, to prevent the damage that they are causing,” said Andrea Burón, spokesperson for the Spanish Epidemiology Society (SEE), alluding to the mental, social and economic impact of the coronavirus lockdown.</p>
<p>Burón also warns that decisions are being made without any real certainty about their impact, and that “it is possible that at some point and in some places we may have to reintroduce temporary restrictive measures if we observe a new spike in cases. It’s part of the process.”</p>
<p>It is also unclear how much power local and regional governments have to make these decisions.</p>
<p>“The normal thing would be for regional and local authorities to want to ease the central government’s restrictions, rather than to increase them,” said José Ramón Repullo, who teaches health planning and economy at the Carlos III Health Institute.</p>
<p>“If there are differences between the regions, you still cannot prohibit people from traveling from one to another,” said Martínez Olmos. “It would be difficult to create border controls between regions or provinces,” adds Repullo. “But then again these are unusual times.”</p>
