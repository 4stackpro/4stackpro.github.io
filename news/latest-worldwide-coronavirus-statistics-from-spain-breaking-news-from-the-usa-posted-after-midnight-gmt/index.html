<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d32YpppasutdE4lBk91cuBR4eWu-a-Sb4SrncTNAPGv-qxPR1pAO9CtrhcGUAGrlfSJtDQgOfH_T_M94ehUcCcMkalOO35oI0fU=s1000" alt="img">
Late-night briefings, press releases and tip-offs at all hours of the evening have, over the past few weeks, become the new norm.</p>
<p>Twelve, 14-hour and even longer days are not unusual for reporters and editors.</p>
<p>Gone are the times when you can walk away from your desk after work knowing that your shift is done. There are no more shifts.</p>
<p>In crisis times, people crave news. Sometimes that means getting out of bed at 11.30pm because you’ve just received a breakdown of the provincial results or you’re waiting patiently for a ministerial — or even presidential — briefing to start, hours after it was scheduled.</p>
<p>DispatchLIVE has surged ahead in terms of online traffic to our website and various social channels, nationally and locally.</p>
<p>There’s no real secret as to how or why. It’s quite simple. We just don’t stop. Extraordinary times require extraordinary effort.</p>
<p>And our team has stood up and embraced the challenge to ensure that we can give our readers our very best when they need it most.</p>
<p>Long hours, sleep deprivation and losing out on precious family time aren’t the only challenges.</p>
<p>Our work demands that we deliver news as fast as possible, but still maintain the same level of quality and accuracy our readers are accustomed to. That can be challenging.</p>
<p>Covid-19 cases updates are provided by the national department of health or sometimes the president. But provincial breakdowns are supplied by departments in the provincial government.
