Where to Stream: Coffee &amp; Kareem Powered by Reelgood</p>
<p>Coffee &amp; Kareem is a new r-rated comedy on Netflix today that will not be winning any Oscars, but might earn a few laughs from audiences looking for something fun to watch this weekend. After all, nothing says “fun” like a movie title that’s a pun. (Get it? Like coffee and cream?)</p>
<p>You likely already know star Ed Helms from The Office and star Taraji P. Henson from Empire, but new to the scene is Terrence Little Gardenhigh, the young actor who plays Kareem. In the movie, Kareem is a foul-mouthed 12-year-old boy who can’t stand the fact that his mom (Henson) is dating a dorky white cop named Coffee (Helms). He decides to intervene. In doing so, he and Coffee accidentally uncover a criminal plot that goes all over town, including to the apparently corrupt police department.</p>
<p>Coffee &amp; Kareem is pretty much exactly what you might expect from a straight-to-Netflix raunchy comedy. It’s definitely no Superbad, but I have no doubt it will find its audience. That’s in no small part thanks to Gardenhigh, who is genuinely funny in the movie, despite the fact that his character is pretty much the worst kid alive. If you’re a newly converted fan, here is a little more about Terrence Little Gardenhigh.</p>
<p>Who is Terrence Little Gardenhigh?</p>
<p>Like his character, Gardenhigh is 12 years old (soon to be 13), but that’s about where the similarities end. An interview with Screenrant and a behind-the-scenes video from the set of the Nickelodeon show Henry Danger reveal Gardenhigh to be a perfectly polite, friendly, and of course, hilarious kid, in contrast to the rude, foul-mouthed Kareem. Gardenhigh was born in in North Carolina; raised in Olympia, WA; and has been acting since he was eight years old, starting in commercials for the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America.</p>
<p>What else has Terrence Little Gardenhigh been in?</p>
<p>Already, 2020 has been a breakout year for Gardenhigh. In addition to Coffee &amp; Kareem, Gardenhigh also joined the main cast of Henry Danger on Nickelodeon as Miles, and will soon star in the spin-off series, Danger Force. That’s it so far, but this is clearly just the beginning for Gardenhigh. We’re certain we’ll be seeing him again very soon.</p>

<h3 id="coffee--kareem-is-a-decaf-comedy-with-artificial-sweetening-says-chris-knight">Coffee &amp; Kareem is a decaf comedy with artificial sweetening, says Chris Knight</h3>
<p><img src="https://nationalpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/cak_unit_08931rcopy.jpg" alt="img">
Is it better to ask of a director: “Where did he go?” Or: “What happened to him?” Put another way: Would you rather be Todd Field, missing in action since delivering the thrice Academy Award nominated Little Children in 2006, or Kevin Smith, whose last five films have averaged 42.6% at Rottentomatoes?</p>
<p>Canadian Michael Dowse is in danger of falling into Kevin Smith territory with Coffee &amp; Kareem. Along with last summer’s Stuber, this is his second comedy in nine months to feature a mismatched cop/civilian pairing, intense levels of swearing and violence, dirty cops, a visit to a strip club and a weird Canadian connection. In Stuber, it was Kumail Nanjiani’s Montreal bagel shop T-shirt and fondness for Coffee Crisps. This time it’s a French-Canadian gang headed up by Quebec actor Serge Houde.</p>
<p>One more unfortunate connection: Neither movie is very funny.</p>
<p>Coffee &amp; Kareem stars Ed Helms as James Coffee, an inept Detroit police officer who’s busted down to traffic duty after letting a suspect escape from his car and then drive off in it.</p>
<p>What I wouldn’t give for him to request two bullets to each knee, known in the trade as a double-double.</p>
<p>James is dating Vanessa (Taraji P. Henson), presumably because he likes his women like his coffee; strong. Vanessa has a 12-year-old son named Kareem, played by Terrence Little Gardenhigh. The kid hates the idea that his mom is dating anyone, but having a white cop as a potential stepdad is beyond the pale.</p>
<p>So he does what any self-respecting fifth-grader would do – visits a local gangster to arrange for a hit on Coffee. (What I wouldn’t give for him to request two bullets to each knee, known in the trade as a double-double.)</p>
<p>Alas, Kareem witnesses another cop getting shot, and soon all three protagonists are on the run from a variety of bad guys. This is one of those movies where people empty the whole gun at whatever/whomever they’re shooting, and somehow wind up with more bullets moments later. It’s also a film in which a snippet of dialogue – “There’s a line, and that is so far past it!” – inadvertently functions as a rebuke to the screenplay, written by feature first-timer Shane Mack.</p>
<p>Dowse’s own first feature was the 2002 hoser comedy Fubar, which featured the immortal tagline “Just give’r” and spawned a 2017 TV series. He followed that with 2004’s It’s All Gone Pete Tong – a wicked comedy with a soundtrack to match – and as recently as 2013 made the rom-com The F Word (a.k.a. What If) with Daniel Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan.</p>
<p>And speaking of people’s better work, Coffee &amp; Kareem also features Betty Gilpin as Coffee’s nemesis, Officer Linda Watts. (That’s Watts with two teas.) A revelation in the recent thriller The Hunt, and a decent supporting performer in the aforementioned Stuber, here she’s relegated to rolling her eyes and acting unhinged.</p>
<p>But it’s never too late for filmmaking talents to turn it around. Gilpin has a role in the upcoming science-fiction action flick The Tomorrow War, and maybe Dowse just needs to get back to his roots.</p>
<p>Coffee &amp; Kareem is set in Detroit but was filmed in Vancouver, so that’s a start. Twitter places Dowse in Montreal at the moment, and with the border closed he’s ours. I suggest that as soon as the film industry cranks into motion again we give him work befitting his proven abilities. It’s the least his country can do.</p>
<p>Coffee &amp; Kareem is available on Netflix on April 3.</p>
<p>1 star out of 5
