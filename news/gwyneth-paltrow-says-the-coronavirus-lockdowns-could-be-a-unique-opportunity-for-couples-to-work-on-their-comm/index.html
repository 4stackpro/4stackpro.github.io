Gwyneth Paltrow said couples quarantining together have a &ldquo;unique opportunity&rdquo; to talk about communication issues in their relationship during a YouTube video titled &ldquo;How Do You Find Intimacy in Uncertain Times?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The founder of wellness brand Goop joined her husband Brad Falchuk and Michaela Boehm, intimacy and sexuality expert, for a conversation on how couples can cope with the stress of quarantine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a unique opportunity to stop and think about the ways in which we communicate or don&rsquo;t communicate,&rdquo; Paltrow said.</p>
<p>Boehm said while talking about communication is the best case scenario, couples should not make drastic relationship decisions like whether to break up or escalate their relationship during quarantine.</p>

<p>Gwyneth Paltrow — known for her controversial health and wellness tips channeled through her wellness brand, Goop — took to YouTube to give relationship and intimacy advice to her followers to use with their partners during the coronavirus lockdowns, now affecting more than half of the US.</p>
<p>Paltrow and her husband, Brad Falchuk, joined Michaela Boehm, an intimacy and sexuality expert, on their YouTube channel for a candid conversation on what couples can do to support each other and keep their relationship strong during quarantine.</p>
<p>During the video, titled &ldquo;How Do You Find Intimacy in Uncertain Times?&quot;, Paltrow and Falchuk admitted that, while their relationship is strong, quarantining 24/7 with two teenagers and each other has resulted in some &ldquo;tension.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re really following the strict guidelines so she&rsquo;s not able to see people that she wants to see, so it gets fractious in moments,&rdquo; Paltrow said. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s definitely tension within the household and we have the added dynamic of step-parent, and I think there is quite a lot of stress that just comes from trying to re-calibrate to this new normal and this level of proximity</p>
<p>Boundary-setting and conflict are problems many couples are having to navigate during quarantine, as people are spending more time around each other than ever before. While the forced indefinite quality time can cause additional stress, Paltrow said it could also be a space to improve communication between partners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a unique opportunity to stop and think about the ways in which we communicate or don&rsquo;t communicate,&rdquo; Paltrow said.</p>
<p>Boehm said, because of social distancing, many couples that would otherwise be too busy with work or social obligations to sit down with each other are now having the space to spend quality time with their partner and evaluate their relationship dynamic up close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes it&rsquo;s not possible when people are constantly on the go and most of your communication happens via text or quick phone calls,&rdquo; Boehm said. &ldquo;Now suddenly you have the time and the space to sit with your partner and look at your partner and say &lsquo;How are you doing?'&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just because a quarantine can be a time to improve communication doesn&rsquo;t mean you should make drastic relationship decisions</p>
<p>While the additional time together can be a good space for couples to work on communication, Boehm said this doesn&rsquo;t mean partners should bring up intense relationship problems during quarantine.</p>
<p>Because the pandemic is a &ldquo;crisis situation,&rdquo; Boehm said the important thing is for people to stay &ldquo;as ok as they can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would suggest that at all possible for anybody I work with, that they put any kind of relationship drama, discussions, things that need to be worked on on the back burner and simply focus on the best possible communication and understanding relationship that can be had,&rdquo; Boehm said.</p>
<p>Unless absolutely necessary, bringing up underlying issues in your relationship right now could actually be detrimental to the mental health of both you and your partner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the time to break up, not the time to have the really heavy-duty conversations, certainly not the time to work on the things that are weakest because that&rsquo;s just pouring gasoline on the fire,&rdquo; Boehm said.</p>
<p>Creating a feeling of mutual understanding can help keep your relationship strong during stressful times</p>
<p>Little things can go a long way in ensuring your partner feels cared about during the quarantine without making large decisions about the structure of your relationship during a crisis.</p>
<p>Boehm said asking questions to your partner in the beginning of the day can be a great way to jump start communication and make them feel cared for in the longrun.</p>
<p>Some good questions to start with are:</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>How are you feeling?</p>
<p>How does you body feel</p>
<p>Is there something that you&rsquo;d like to talk about?</p>
<p>What can you and I do today to make this a good day?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Making sure there&rsquo;s a feeling of mutual understanding and collaboration because that&rsquo;s the key,&rdquo; Boehm said. &ldquo;The only way that&rsquo;s going to improve the relationship is when it feels like two people are collaborating and two people are caring for each other.&rdquo;</p>

She bizarrely kept six feet of distance between herself and her own husband while out for a walk last week.</p>
<p>But there was no such social distancing practiced on Tuesday, when Gwyneth Paltrow went for a stroll with her 13-year-old son Moses Martin.</p>
<p>The 47-year-old actress and one of the two children she shares with ex husband Chris Martin wore matching black T-shirts for the outing.</p>

<p>Paltrow completed her casual look with sweatpants and white trainers.</p>
<p>Her wavy blond tresses were worn loose and the Academy Award winning actress shielded her eyes with white framed sunglasses.</p>
<p>Her son, meanwhile carried his skateboard under his arm as he chatted with his mom during the walk.</p>

<p>The outing comes after Gwyneth was pictured keeping quite a distance between herself and current husband Brad Falchuk during a walk.</p>
<p>The Contagion actress confirmed this was a deliberate choice in her caption, which began, &lsquo;@bradfalchuk and I were grateful to learn our local farmers market was open this morning; we walked there (keeping lots of distance) and donned masks and gloves once we got nearer to the market, only taking them off when we were almost home and there were no other pedestrians in close proximity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The couple live together, having finally moved under the same roof in August 2019, almost a year after they were married.

Gwyneth Paltrow is embracing social distancing.</p>
<p>The Goop founder, 47, enjoyed a virtual cocktail hour with her childhood friends on Saturday, as part of a larger effort to reduce the spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p>Gwyneth posted a photo from her digital hang out onto her Instagram account, which showed her catching up with five friends from the comfort and safety of her home.</p>
<p>Getting a safe buzz! Gwyneth Paltrow enjoyed a virtual cocktail hour with her childhood friends on Saturday, as part of a larger effort to reduce the spread of coronavirus</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cocktail hour with the middle school gang,&rsquo; she captioned the snap.</p>
<p>As the world adjusts their daily life in accordance with the virus, Gwyneth has been doing the same.</p>
<p>It has not been without some trial and error, however - the actress was slammed for posting a &lsquo;tone-deaf&rsquo; selfie onto the Goop Instagram account on March 13, in which she invited people to &lsquo;tap to shop&rsquo; a $875 designer outfit she was modeling.</p>
<p>The backlash came thick and fast in the comments section, and the post was deleted around four hours later.</p>
<p>Safety first: Last week, Gwyneth went to the farmers&rsquo; market with her husband Brad Falchuk, armed with a face mask and pair of gloves</p>
<p>Last week, Gwyneth went to the farmers&rsquo; market with her husband Brad Falchuk, armed with a face mask and pair of gloves.</p>
<p>The actress shared a photo of herself carrying her fresh vegetables, as she described her efforts to remain safe at the ordinarily busy market.</p>
<p>&lsquo;@bradfalchuk and I were grateful to learn our local farmers market was open this morning; we walked there (keeping lots of distance) and donned masks and gloves once we got nearer to the market, only taking them off when we were almost home and there were no other pedestrians in close proximity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Backlash: The actress was slammed for posting a &lsquo;tone-deaf&rsquo; selfie onto her Instagram account on March 13, in which she invited people to &lsquo;tap to shop&rsquo; a $875 designer outfit she was modeling</p>
<p>She also urged others to take the new social distancing measures in place seriously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must take this seriously and shelter in place. It&rsquo;s time for nesting, reading, cleaning out closets, doing something you&rsquo;ve always wanted to do (write a book, learn an instrument or a language or learn to code online, draw or paint) going through photos, cooking, and reconnecting on a deeper level with the people you love.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I find hope in the generosity, love, protection and care I see and feel through out our country everyday and my heart goes out to everyone directly affected or simply in fear. We will get through and I bet you our humanity will shine like never before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The actress additionally posted a video &lsquo;love letter&rsquo; to Italy, which has been badly hit by the virus.</p>
<p>Italy holds a special place in Gwyneth&rsquo;s heart, being both the place where she became engaged to Brad and where her father passed away.
