<p>Join us for the virtual Anzac Day Dawn Service from 6am on Saturday at nzherald.co.nz or on Newstalk ZB.</p>
<p>Kiwis might not be able to commemorate Anzac Day the traditional way this year but we&rsquo;re hoping you can help line the streets with poppies by putting our special Anzac poster in your window.</p>
<p>The war against Covid-19 has seen ANZAC Day services around the country cancelled for the first time in NZ history, but that won’t stop New Zealanders showing their respect to those who lost their lives in a very different type of battle. Video / Auckland War Memorial Museum / Dean Purcell / Chris Tarpey / Michael Craig</p>
<p>For the first time in history Anzac Day dawn ceremonies will not be taking place this April 25, due to Covid-19 restrictions.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>As a means to pay respects, Kiwis are being urged to &ldquo;never forget&rdquo; from inside their bubbles by placing images of poppies in their windows, including a special edition poster from the Herald artist and cartoonist Rod Emmerson, published in today&rsquo;s Herald.</p>
<p>New Zealanders are also being asked to unite at 6am on Saturday at their letterboxes, front doors and even their living rooms. Veterans are encouraged to wear their medals on Anzac Day just as they would for official public gatherings on Anzac Day.</p>
<p>Emmerson said the inspiration for his image came from an Anzac Day illustration four years ago, where he depicted a soldier walking into battlefield along with the Māori whakataukī (proverb): &ldquo;Whatungarongaro te tangata toitū te whenua&rdquo;, or &ldquo;The people fade from view but the land remains&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That image has been one of my favourites, so I wanted to use that as a basis and provide depth, do something spiritual and meaningful, rather than just a poppy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emmerson, originally from Australia, said it was an &ldquo;important role&rdquo; to provide illustrations for Anzac Day, which he&rsquo;d been doing for about 30 years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is about conveying the empathy we all have for those who gave their lives so we can sleep at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On a personal level, it was also recognising the sacrifices of his father, uncles and grandfathers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As each new generation comes they need to be reminded what war really is about, the massive loss of life, and the sacrifices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Returned and Services&rsquo; Association president BJ Clark said the RSA greatly appreciated the support for &ldquo;virtual services&rdquo; this Anzac Day.</p>
<p>The virtual campaign #StandAtDawn encourages households to gather at their door or gate at 6am, and has the slogan: &ldquo;Apart, but together as one&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be disappointing not going to the service, but I am looking forward to walking to my gate on Saturday morning, and seeing people in my neighbourhood out with candles or torches, and poppies on their fences or in their windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The national Poppy Day appeal was postponed this year for the first time since 1992, which Clark said could have &ldquo;huge financial consequences&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The RSA usually collected between $1.5-2 million, but were expecting much less this year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We rely on those funds to support our veterans, young and old, and their families,&rdquo; Clark said.</p>
<p>In light of this shortfall, the country&rsquo;s largest philanthropic entity, Perpetual Guardian, has stepped up and started a Givealittle page, and is contributing $25,000 from its own members and another $1500 from the company itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The work the RSA does is incredibly important, so we are very happy to be involved with this,&rdquo; said Liz Gibbs, head of philanthropy at Perpetual Guardian.

<h3 id="project-poppy-box-offers-a-way-for-ecec-services-to-acknowledge-anzac-day">Project Poppy Box offers a way for ECEC services to acknowledge ANZAC Day</h3>
<p><img src="https://sector.imgix.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/irene-ortiz-3JcFnHLSMP8-unsplash.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress" alt="img">
Each year on 25 April, Australians gather to acknowledge the sacrifices made by men and women who have served, or who are currently serving, their country during war, conflict and peacekeeping operations.</p>
<p>Early childhood education and care (ECEC) services are playing an increasingly important role in these acknowledgements, supporting children and families to understand the significance of the day, and participating in ceremonies to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>This year, for the first time since the Second World War, ANZAC Day will look very different for Australians as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with dawn services around the country cancelled.</p>
<p>Despite the restrictions and cancellations, many education and care services are striving to find a way to acknowledge this special day in a way which includes children and families in their services, as well as those who are choosing to self isolate.</p>
<p>Enter Project Poppy Box, the brainchild of Loddon Shire Council, located in Victoria.</p>
<p>Using the well-known poppy symbol, chosen to represent the sacrifice of war, the Council has suggested that services, families, and others in the community place a cut-out poppy on their mailbox.</p>
<p>In place of attending a Dawn Service, a number of councils and community groups have suggested that Australian’s pay their respects on balconies, front gates and driveways at 6am on Anzac Day for #StandTo, in place of attending a dawn service.</p>
<p>Musicians are encouraged to learn and play the ‘Last Post’ at home to stand united in music and ‘in spirit’ in the Music for Mateship campaign.</p>
<p>The Australian War Memorial will hold a revised Anzac Day service with wreaths laid by representatives of the Commonwealth as well as current and former veterans. The national commemoration will be televised on the ABC.</p>
<p>More information on the Project Poppy Box campaign may be found here.

<h3 id="anzac-day-poppy-for-waimate-war-hero-painted-on-towns-huge-silos">Anzac Day poppy for Waimate war hero painted on town&rsquo;s huge silos</h3>
<p><img src="https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/2/0/6/2/a/5/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.205xg0.png/1587614097629.jpg" alt="img">
Waimate artist Bill Scott has created a life-size poppy for his war hero mural to wear during Anzac Day commemorations.</p>
<p>A giant poppy was attached to the muralled-silos in Waimate on Thursday morning as a way to mark Anzac Day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have made a poppy for the mural of Eric Batchelor to recognise Anzac Day,&rdquo; Waimate artist Bill Scott, who painted the murals that adorn the silos, said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it would be a great way, particularly given the circumstances, to recognise Anzac Day and show that it is still relevant today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waimate war hero Batchelor was the most decorated soldier in New Zealand at the time of his death in 2010.</p>
<p>Bejon Haswell/Stuff The larger than life size poppy will remain in place for Anzac Day week.</p>
<p>In 2018, Batchelor was immortalised in the mural alongside Chief Te Huruhuru, Michael Studholme, former Prime Minister Norman Kirk and, later, New Zealand&rsquo;s first registered female doctor, Margaret Cruickshank.</p>
<p>Scott said the idea for the poppy addition came to him during lockdown and has not taken very long to manufacture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s to the scale of the mural so in literal terms it is 700-800 millimetres in diameter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because there are no Anzac Day assemblies of course, this will be something people can enjoy from a distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Waimate Transport, which owns the silos, provided the machinery to lift the poppy into place and hang it &ldquo;safe and secure&rdquo;, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As people would normally wear a poppy to recognise this time of year, this is something that will be there for the week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hopefully it will become an annual tribute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And while one tribute is erected, another has been put on hold.</p>
<p>Waihao Forks Hotel owners Sandy and Shane Doolan had plans to unveil a sculpture of soldier Ted d&rsquo;Auvergne this Anzac Day.</p>
<p>Bejon Haswell/Stuff Artist Bill Scott said he hopes it will be something for people to see from afar, a tribute when assemblies are not allowed.</p>
<p>D&rsquo;Auvergne bought a bottle of beer from the pub before heading off to World War II, telling the publican he would open it when he returned, which he never did. The bottle remains on display at the pub in tribute.</p>
<p>Together with the Waimate District Charitable Foundation, the Doolan&rsquo;s started fundraising in 2018 for a life-size brass sculpture of d&rsquo;Auvergne by former Oamaru-based artist Don Paterson in the style of The Bushman sculpture in Waimate&rsquo;s main street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sculptor has finished the statue but we haven&rsquo;t finished the platform,&rdquo; Sandy Doolan told Stuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were halfway through when it locked down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said they had not yet rearranged when the statue would be unveiled, it is all &ldquo;sort of wait and see at the moment&rdquo;.
