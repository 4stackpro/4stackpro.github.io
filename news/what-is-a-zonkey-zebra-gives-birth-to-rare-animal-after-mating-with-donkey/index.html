It’s a zonkey! That was the birth announcement made in an April 8 press release by the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, a charity animal rescue and rehabilitation organization in Kenya.</p>
<p>But what is a zonkey and how did it come to be?</p>
<p>According to the press release, the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust/Kenya Wildlife Service Tsavo Mobile Veterinary Unit received a call from a KWS Community Warden last May. A stray zebra had moved out of the Tsavo East National Park and had for many weeks made herself at home with a local woman’s cattle herd.</p>
<p>The story was aired on local media, so for the zebra’s safety, the SWT/KWS team was asked to help transfer her to a protected area. Keeping in mind that the zebra had become fairly accustomed to community life, the team chose the Kenze Anti-Poaching Team’s base in Chyulu National Park, where she was seen frequently over the coming months at the water hole and salt lick.</p>
<p>Fast forward to earlier this year, when workers at Chyulu National Park caught just a glimpse of a zebra with a tiny foal by her side. Several weeks later they were able to get a good look at the pair, revealing a “whole new surprising twist.”</p>
<p>“While zebra foals are born with white and brown stripes that eventually turn black, this little one’s body was suspiciously light on stripes and overwhelmingly tawny in color. At first, we thought that it had just been wallowing in the mud bath, but then the truth dawned on us: Our wayward zebra had given birth to a zonkey!” the press release said.</p>
<p>“A zonkey is a highly unusual hybrid between a zebra and donkey.”</p>
<p>Because the gestation period of a zebra is twelve months, connecting the dots was quite easy. “During her time living within the community last year, she had obviously become acquainted with an amorous donkey,” states the press release.</p>
<p>With the sturdy body of its donkey sire and the striped legs of its zebra mother, the zonkey is an eye-catching creature, but because a zonkey is a mule, once it reaches maturity it will be unable to successfully breed. Otherwise it should lead a normal life.</p>
<p>The announcement states “that mum and baby are thriving.&rdquo; Their new home is in an area not plagued by heavy predation, and due to the lush conditions, with water and grass plentiful &ldquo;it is a good place to call home.”</p>
<p>A statement by the rescue group said, “Working with wildlife, one learns to expect the unexpected. Even the most seemingly straightforward story can eventually reveal its true stripes and end up surprising us all.”</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200411142751-01-zonkey-sheldrick-wildlife-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) If you thought baby donkeys were cute, wait until you get a load of this zonkey!</p>
<p>A zebra at the Chyulu Hills National Park in Kenya was recently found with a peculiar-looking foal by her side. It had stripes, but they weren&rsquo;t dark and barely covered her body.</p>
<p>When caregivers at the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, an animal rescue and rehabilitation organization, examined the foal up close, they were excited to discover it wasn&rsquo;t a zebra after all &ndash; but a zonkey, a zebra-donkey hybrid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Working with wildlife, one learns to expect the unexpected,&rdquo; the rescue group said in a news release on Wednesday. &ldquo;Even the most seemingly straightforward story can eventually reveal its true stripes and end up surprising us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The zebra and her baby zonkey.</p>
<p>The mama zebra, which doesn&rsquo;t have a name, was a stray who ventured out of Kenya&rsquo;s Tsavo East National Park and into a community where she &ldquo;made herself at home&rdquo; amongst a local cattle herd, according to the rescue group.</p>

<p>It’s a… zonkey!</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a zebra at the Chyulu Hills National Park in Kenya was spotted with a strange-looking foal by her side that had a brown body and stripes up and down its legs.</p>
<p>Caregivers initially thought the youngster was dirty from “wallowing in a mud bath.” However, after closer examination, they quickly realized that the baby was actually an “unusual hybrid between a zebra and donkey.”</p>
<p>They explained that prior to living at the Chyulu Hills National Park, the mother zebra had been found settling into a community bordering the Tsavo East National Park and had made herself an “honorary member of a local woman’s cattle herd.” There, she must have mated with a donkey.</p>
<p>“The gestation period of a zebra is twelve months, so it’s not difficult to connect the dots. During her time living within the community last year, she had obviously become acquainted with an amorous donkey,” the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, one of Africa’s oldest conservation organizations, wrote in a statement on their website last week. “The zonkey combines the sturdy body of its donkey sire and the striped legs of its zebra mother, which makes for a striking creature.”</p>

<p>Caregivers said they were “happy to report that mum and baby are thriving.”</p>
<p>“Their home is in an area that isn’t plagued by heavy predation and thanks to the lush conditions, water and, plentiful grass, it is a good place to call home,” they added.</p>
<p>Officials explained that they plan to take care of the pair until the animals are discovered by a zeal, or a herd of wild zebras, as the species are highly social and typically live in groups.</p>
<p>“Until that day comes, they seem quite content to spend their days grazing side-by-side, a sight that makes us all stop and marvel at the wonders of nature,” officials wrote.</p>
<p>According to the trust, the foal is expected to live a normal life. However, since it is a mule, it will be unable to successfully breed once it reaches maturity.</p>
<p>“Working with wildlife, one learns to expect the unexpected,” officials with the trust wrote. “Even the most seemingly straightforward story can eventually reveal its true stripes and end up surprising us all.”
