Ruto: Jubilee wrangles work of conmen, not President Uhuru</p>
<p>Deputy President William Ruto has accused conmen and political rejects of engineering the illegal and fraudulent party organ membership changes that have sparked internal squabbles in the ruling Jubilee party.“This is the works of political rejects, conmen, fraudsters whose party allegiance is already elsewhere. They should give us a break and leave the Jubilee Party alone,” he tweeted on Sunday. Ruto (pictured) was, however, quick to defend President Uhuru Kenyatta, saying he had nothing to do with the illegalities and the wrangles. &ldquo;The President and party leader of the Jubilee Party did not and cannot be party to any fraudulent and illegal changes to officials of our party,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>In a Gazette Notice dated April 6, the Registrar of Political Parties announced Jubilee’s intention to change members of the National Management Committee (NMC), who would be replaced by; Lucy Prof Marete Marangu, Jane Nampaso, Nyawira Macharia James Waweru and Walter Nyambati The Tangatanga wing of Jubilee led by Ruto treat the changes as an internal coup and have protested openly with the DP, Senate Majority Kikpchumba Murkomen among others protesting the move. Murkomen wrote a protest letter to the Registrar of Political Parties Anne Nderitu and has threatened to report the matter to DCI.</p>

<p>“I have performed my patriotic duty as Jubilee member and a member of Jubilee’s National Executive Committee, NGC and NDC to avert fraudulent changes on the party’s national management committee (NMC). I have written a letter to the registrar and will soon report this matter to DCI,” the Elgeyo Marakwet Senator said. Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria, another Ruto ally dismissed the changes, saying they were not sanctioned by relevant party organs and as such were illegal.</p>

<p>“Any changes involving the party in any way must be sanctioned by relevant party organs through a formal meeting and resolutions passed,” he said. Jubilee Secretary General Raphael Tuju has, however, defended the changes saying they were necessary after some members of NMC got state appointments. “The changes were effected after a number of officials landed jobs in government. The letter to make the changes was written on March 23 and noise around the reply by the registrar is unwarranted,” he said. Jubilee former vice-chair David Murathe has told Ruto to face President Uhuru, saying Tuju is only acting on the Head of State’s orders. “Tuju was merely acting on orders by President Uhuru as he had no powers to institute such changes independently. Let Ruto stop his social media rants and face the President himself,” he said.</p>

<p>“Tuju cannot make changes in the party without making reference to the party leader. These fellows are wasting time,” said Murathe.</p>

<h3 id="ruto-explains-why-he-is-not-seen-with-uhuru-regularly">Ruto explains why he is not seen with Uhuru regularly</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/ureport-uploads/FILE-1586424428.jpg" alt="img">
SUMMARY “We consult regularly…almost daily with the President and all the other ministers involved in the management of this pandemic. “The operations of government are a preserve of the people in government…we took a decision that this being a national pandemic, all of us are going to read from one script,” he said.</p>
<p>Deputy President William Ruto on Thursday cleared the air on why he has not been in the company of President Uhuru Kenyatta in the past few weeks.</p>
<p>Each time the President has addressed the nation, DP Ruto has been conspicuously absent, raising eyebrows.</p>
<p>While addressing the nation from his Karen residence, the DP stated that he has been in constant communication with the Head of State and all the ministers involved in fighting COVID-19.</p>
<p>He added that the Cabinet has adopted teleconferencing and video conferencing as part of maintaining social distancing.</p>
<p>“We consult regularly…almost daily with the President and all the other ministers involved in the management of this pandemic.</p>
<p>“The operations of government are a preserve of the people in government…we took a decision that this being a national pandemic, all of us are going to read from one script,” he said.</p>
<p>Adding: We are making teleconferencing and video conferencing a big portion of government communication to facilitate social distancing and to avoid physical meetings.”</p>
<p>While emphasizing the seriousness of the pandemic, the DP also posed a question to the journalists:</p>
<p>“You may want to ask yourself why the President and his deputy cannot travel in the same equipment [sic] at any one time and in a situation like this, the answer to that question may help you understand why we are like this at the moment,” he remarked.</p>

<p>The DP urged Kenyans to continue practicing the measures issued by the government saying they are simple but very effective.</p>

<h3 id="coronavirus-is-teaching-us-to-look-at-our-politics-differently">Coronavirus is teaching us to look at our politics differently</h3>

<p>If there is one lesson for Kenya to take home from the Covid-19 pandemic, it is that we can exist without Uhuru Kenyatta, William Ruto and Raila Odinga. The President, the Deputy President and the Opposition chief have been rendered irrelevant and redundant.</p>
<p>We have learnt in the age of coronavirus that our survival is not dependent on the heft, clout and money of any of the characters who have been busy herding us into groups and factions as they plot their political shenanigans. Kenyatta, Ruto and Raila, the Building Bridges Initiative and related 2022 election jostling have absolutely no space in the attention of those who suddenly have much more urgent priorities — like simply staying alive.</p>
<p>Right now, we are preoccupied with religiously washing our hands and generally avoiding situations that may expose us to the infernal bug. We are suffering the economic disruptions wrought by the coronavirus, gripped by anxiety over how we will survive if the pay cheque is halted or the business goes belly-up.</p>
<p>The enforced isolation of the dusk-to-dawn curfew, ban on public gatherings; shuttered bars, restaurants and churches; and even family separations are all taking their emotional toll. We are accepting the reality that if coronavirus follows the trends seen elsewhere, we could die by the thousands.</p>
<p>But we also have to be prepared for life after corona. For every thousand who lose their lives, there will be tens of thousands more who will survive to pick up the pieces and rebuild shattered lives. Those lucky enough to survive must go out there to rebuild a nation no longer held hostage by selfish, conniving politicians.</p>
<p>Coronavirus will have taught us that survival depended not on fealty to ethnic kingpins in the political realm, but to individual observance of clean hands. Yes, we can only wash our own hands, and with that step out into the new world singing our own song.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Throughout the crisis, the persons we looked up to for leadership were not the political heavyweights who ordinarily direct the national agenda, but the bureaucrats and technocrats providing the information and guidance vital to surviving coronavirus.</p>
<p>Every day, we are glued to TV and radio news broadcasts not to be assaulted by the latest political noises from Uhuru, Ruto or Raila; but for the daily coronavirus briefings from Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe and his staffers. We got plenty of useful information from the Acting Director-General of Health Patrick Amoth, a fellow who, in ordinary circumstances, would be toiling away unnoticed in the background doing the humdrum things that career public servants do.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, we got to learn that this government has some Cabinet administrative secretaries who are not just failed politicians and other unemployables who must be given a public appointment to remain relevant. In Dr Mercy Mwangangi, we have seen a CAS who actually works and evidently knows her job.</p>
<p>A few other Cabinet secretaries and other officials have also come to the fore, notably Dr Fred Matiang&rsquo;i on the Interior and Coordination of National Government docket, and the Inspector-General of Police Hillary Mutyambai. Both are critical to the security implications of coronavirus containment measures.</p>
<p>Although Mr Kagwe, who is already attracting international attention, and Dr Matiang&rsquo;i are being noticed because of providing leadership in their respective ministerial dockets, the political scenario cannot be ignored altogether.</p>
<p>Mr Kagwe is a politician, a former senator and Cabinet minister brought back in from the cold in January after having lost out at the 2017 elections. His performance since on the coronavirus hot zone has not only earned him rave reviews but seen him described as &lsquo;presidential&rsquo; and a contender to succeed President Kenyatta as Central Kenya leader.</p>
<p>Dr Matiang&rsquo;i, President Kenyatta&rsquo;s &lsquo;Mr Fix It&rsquo;, has been regarded as de facto Prime Minister since appointment last year to chair a committee of the full Cabinet on critical cross-cutting issues. He denies harbouring political ambitions but has emerged as an increasingly key player in 2022 presidential succession politics.</p>
<p>If they don&rsquo;t already know it, both men will learn soon enough that the knives are always out for those on upward political trajectory. They would be well-advised to focus on delivery and not get carried away by the illusion of power. This will be especially important if the post-corona dispensation values performance over naked politics.
