The Covid-19 cluster at Christchurch&rsquo;s Rosewood Rest Home has been the deadliest in NZ.</p>
<p>Ten people from a Christchurch rest home have now died from coronavirus, making it by far the deadliest cluster in the country.</p>
<p>Director of public health Dr Caroline McElnay confirmed the death of a man in his 60s at Rosewood Rest Home and Hospital on Friday.</p>
<p>She said the man had underlying health conditions and was initially considered a probable case given his clinical history.</p>
<p>The man is the second person in the hospital-level wing of the rest home to die from Covid-19. The eight other deaths occurred in the group of 20 dementia patients who were transferred from Rosewood to Burwood Hospital.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>When the first Covid-19 cases were discovered at the rest home, there were 64 residents in total, meaning close to one-in-six have so-far died. The latest death brings the national Covid-19 death toll to 17.</p>
<p>A Rosewood spokesperson said staff and residents were saddened by the passing of one of their own. &ldquo;He has been part of our Rosewood family for almost two years. As a smaller facility, our staff really get to know our residents and feel that they are family,&rdquo; they said.</p>
<p>Including those who have died, there are now 51 confirmed and probable Covid-19 cases associated with the Rosewood cluster. This includes six Canterbury District Health Board (CDHB) staff.</p>
<p>Stuff previously reported three DHB staff, two working at Burwood and one involved in the transfer of the dementia patients from Rosewood, had tested positive for Covid-19. As a result, 41 other CDHB staff members deemed close contacts had gone into isolation.</p>
<p>Canterbury medical officer of health Dr Cheryl Brunton said the additional three staff who had contracted Covid-19 had all been in isolation, but she did not say if that was because they were close contacts of the other three staff. One was based at Burwood, and two were CDHB staff who had been working at Rosewood.</p>
<p>JOHN KIRK-ANDERSON/STUFF Ten people from Rosewood Rest Home in Christchurch have died of Covid-19.</p>
<p>As well as the CDHB staff, 20 Rosewood staff were either confirmed or probable cases, and six other people in contact with staff were confirmed or probable.</p>
<p>There are nine confirmed and four probable cases among the Rosewood residents now at Burwood, and three confirmed and three probable cases among residents in the hospital-level care wing at Rosewood. The figures include the eight deaths at Burwood and two deaths at Rosewood.</p>
<p>There are six aged residential care facilities around the country with Covid-19 cases. Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield has commissioned reviews into the facilities.</p>
<p>The CDHB will review all systems and processes at Rosewood and at George Manning, another Christchurch aged care facility with a cluster of coronavirus cases.</p>
<p>The total number of confirmed and probable cases in New Zealand rose to 1456 on Friday (including 174 in the Canterbury DHB area).</p>
<p>There are eight people in hospital with Covid-19, one of whom is in intensive care.

<h3 id="coronavirus-rest-home-staff-fear-for-another-rosewood-catastrophe">Coronavirus: Rest home staff fear for another Rosewood catastrophe</h3>
<p><img src="https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/2/0/2/e/s/k/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.206jlz.png/1587673868463.jpg" alt="img">
The district health board took control at Rosewood after staff visited on April 5.</p>
<p>This story was originally published on Newsroom.co.nz and is republished with permission.</p>
<p>Frontline staff say it&rsquo;s just luck there hasn&rsquo;t been another catastrophe like at Rosewood rest home. David Williams reports</p>
<p>For Sue*, to care is to fear, right now.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s close to the residents in her central North Island rest home, a locally owned business with less than 30 rooms. The residents are like members of her extended family – extremely vulnerable ones.</p>
<p>But at the moment the caregiver&rsquo;s smile is forced, so they can&rsquo;t tell she&rsquo;s scared.</p>
<p>Like thousands of frontline healthcare workers she&rsquo;s paralysed by a series of weighty questions. What if Covid-19 gets in there? What can be done to stop it spreading if it does? What if she&rsquo;s the one who brings the virus in?</p>
<p>The answers to those questions could mean the difference between life or death, as has been seen at Christchurch&rsquo;s Rosewood rest home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we wash our hands, and, yes, we wear gloves and aprons,&rdquo; Sue says. &ldquo;But there is still a huge risk that we&rsquo;re going from one person to another, and one place to another, and, worst case scenario, that&rsquo;s a catastrophe waiting to happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>JOHN KIRK-ANDERSON/STUFF Some residents were moved from Rosewood Rest Home and Hospital to Burwood Hospital in Christchurch.</p>
<p>Covid-19 is an added burden Sue and her colleagues don&rsquo;t need. For many, the pressure of care work has pushed them to breaking point. Many are leaving, not for other rest homes but out of the industry altogether, because they feel unsafe and unappreciated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re stressed, we&rsquo;re anxious, we&rsquo;re burnt out, we&rsquo;ve got staff ringing in sick, we have got trouble covering shifts because staff are sick, and then they need to have a stand-down period.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite Covid-19 deaths in rest homes, and clusters of infections at six facilities, reassuring messages emanate from Wellington and the aged care industry.</p>
<p>New admissions to residential care homes are now being isolated for 14 days, the public is told. Stockpiled protective equipment (PPE) is being distributed by Ministry of Health to district health boards, and, there was plenty to go around, apparently.</p>
<p>Newsroom spoke to Sue and three of her colleagues in different parts of the country to check their experiences.</p>
<p>They admit there have been improvements at their rest homes. Procedures have been tightened, management are more often on the floor, and cleaning has been stepped up. Lounge furniture has been moved apart.</p>
<p>JOHN KIRK-ANDERSON/STUFF The Rosewood Rest Home and Hospital in Christchurch is home to one of the Covid-19 clusters.</p>
<p>But the quartet of workers spoken to by Newsroom say isolation is impossible in some facilities, especially those with dementia units, and some facilities don&rsquo;t even have a formal way of telling staff if a resident or colleague has been tested for Covid-19.</p>
<p>Access to PPE is patchy, they say. On that point, Aged Care Association chief executive Simon Wallace told Parliament&rsquo;s Epidemic Response Committee on Wednesday: &ldquo;Even now, nearly two months on, there are still some issues in our members being able to access the PPE that they need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Auditor-General is reviewing the Ministry of Health&rsquo;s PPE management.</p>
<p>Quinn* works at a rest home, owned by a big chain, with more than 30 beds in the Southern district health board (DHB) region. She says newly arrived dementia patients aren&rsquo;t being isolated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s crazy,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s sitting together, there&rsquo;s no separation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Wallace mentioned the 14-day isolation policy to the Epidemic Response Committee on Wednesday, but none of the MPs asked about its efficacy.)</p>
<p>Pat* also works in a rest home in the Southern DHB area, owned by a big national company. She says it would be near impossible to isolate new arrivals with dementia. &ldquo;We have so many wanderers, you couldn&rsquo;t keep them in their room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PPE at Pat&rsquo;s facility is under strict control. &ldquo;You almost get the feeling they&rsquo;re more interested in preparing for maintaining it when it&rsquo;s here than they are in preventing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anxiety is infectious. Now, Pat says, some care workers are being pressured by their families to leave – &ldquo;because of how poorly they feel we&rsquo;re being protected&rdquo;.</p>
<p>JOSEPH JOHNSON/STUFF Christchurch&rsquo;s Burwood, where Rosewood Rest Home were moved.</p>
<p>Central North Island worker Ruth* says staff at her facility, owned by a big chain, are being bullied if they ask for PPE gear beyond what&rsquo;s being issued. Staff haven&rsquo;t been trained how to use PPE, she says – &ldquo;not even how to dispose of it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Her colleagues are saying &ldquo;I feel in danger&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m terrified&rdquo;. But they&rsquo;re not leaving because of loyalty to their residents.</p>
<p>A positive case in her facility would be &ldquo;absolutely disastrous&rdquo;, Ruth says. &ldquo;We would be in the same situation as Rosewood and the other facilities that have been affected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The argument&rsquo;s been made that the aged care sector&rsquo;s doing a fine job, given only half a dozen out of more than 650 facilities have clusters.</p>
<p>But these frontline workers say that&rsquo;s mainly down to luck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ones that it&rsquo;s about good management are the minority,&rdquo; Sam Jones, a national director of union E tū, says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re deeply concerned for the safety of the residents and the workers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The level of care these residents are needing is insane. You&rsquo;re absolutely rushed off your feet.&rdquo; – &ldquo;Pat&rdquo;</p>
<p>Caregiving is intense, skilled work. It&rsquo;s physically demanding and mentally draining.</p>
<p>With the elderly being admitted to rest homes later in life, now, their needs are more complex.</p>
<p>Many residents aren&rsquo;t mobile. They can&rsquo;t walk anymore so slings are used to move them around. That increases the time and effort required for their daily &ldquo;cares&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to just stand someone up and walk them over to the toilet,&rdquo; Pat says. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s a lot harder if you&rsquo;ve got to put a sling on them, and then hook them up to the sling, lift them up, put them on the sling, and then transfer them back as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some residents are deemed two-assist – it takes two caregivers to do their cares. That takes two people off the floor, in an industry where the staff-to-resident ratio is a huge concern.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the mental side. While caregivers explain their tasks to residents, they&rsquo;re often challenged. That might mean spending five minutes to convince a resident to hand over their dentures, Pat says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The level of care these residents are needing is insane. You&rsquo;re absolutely rushed off your feet. A lot of it takes a mental toll on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Compounding the intensity are staffing issues.</p>
<p>Quinn says: &ldquo;Sometimes the roster&rsquo;s got huge gaps in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they&rsquo;re short-staffed, caregivers might have to pick up twice as many people. And these might be staff who have worked five days already that week, but are pressured to pull extra shifts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they wonder why there&rsquo;s mistakes sometimes?&rdquo; Quinn says. &ldquo;I wish we had a bigger workforce. Sometimes it&rsquo;s far too tight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To protect residents, some facilities are telling staff to go home if they turn up sick. Quinn says if they are forced to go home &ldquo;for any little thing&rdquo; then &ldquo;we are screwed, pretty much&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who doesn&rsquo;t come to work if they&rsquo;ve got a sore throat or a headache, and just battle their way through the day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>(That&rsquo;s where regular Covid-19 testing of workers might help.)</p>
<p>This is where the economic frailties of rest homes, and their poorly paid workers, are exposed. If staff unable to work don&rsquo;t have sick leave, and it&rsquo;s not Covid-19 related, they might not get paid. Or if they do, it might be 80 per cent of their wage. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be really, really tough on those staff,&rdquo; Quinn says.</p>
<p>Ruth says at her facility, short-staffing means caregivers with no qualification are often placed in the dementia wing.</p>
<p>Quinn, Pat and Ruth say they&rsquo;d not recommend their rest home to a friend looking for work. Sue says she might have done before, but not now, under Covid-19 conditions. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s just so many things to worry about. There&rsquo;s such a big workload. It&rsquo;s just crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>E tū and NZNO, the union representing nurses, have argued for years that minimum staffing levels – such as one on-duty staffer and one on-call for up to 29 residents – are unsafe. A joint report they put out last year, In Safe Hands, says stretched staff are having to choose who gets help – so-called care rationing that is compromising safety.</p>
<p>Staffing standards are out-of-date, voluntary, and don&rsquo;t work, the report said. And that was before Covid-19.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just about this moment,&rdquo; E tū&rsquo;s Jones says. &ldquo;This moment just highlights how bad it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Industry response</p>
<p>Newsroom asked three big care providers – Metlifecare, Bupa and Ryman – to respond, and state how they&rsquo;re protecting residents and staff. The first two responded, while Ryman left the response to the Aged Care Association.</p>
<p>Wallace couldn&rsquo;t be reached for comment yesterday, but has previously noted many rest homes acted quickly by banning visitors before the national lockdown. The association is now calling for mandatory Covid-19 testing of new arrivals to rest homes, something only some DHBs are doing.</p>
<p>Bupa&rsquo;s media and external communications manager Robert Walker says it&rsquo;s maintaining strict infection prevention and control measures. &ldquo;These include restricting visitor access, enforcing the 14-day isolation policy, good hand hygiene and physical distancing where practicable. We continue to follow the Ministry of Health guidelines and advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not aware of any issues at any Bupa sites, but encourage all of our people to speak up if they have any concerns. Our absolute priority is the health, safety and wellbeing of our residents and our people who care for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Speaking out doesn&rsquo;t always happen, of course, especially by migrant workers whose visas are tied to certain facilities.)</p>
<p>Staffing, pay rates</p>
<p>Metlifecare&rsquo;s chief executive Glen Sowry says the NZX-listed company developed a Covid-19 plan for its 11 care homes. Its homes aren&rsquo;t under-staffed, he says, because it proactively recruited more registered nurses, caregivers and home support workers and increased the pay of frontline staff in care homes during alert level 4.</p>
<p>(Bupa has also temporarily bumped up pay rates, by $2 an hour. E tū&rsquo;s Jones was curious some employers magically found extra money to increase pay &ldquo;when they&rsquo;ve continually said that they don&rsquo;t have money to afford it&rdquo;.)</p>
<p>Metlifecare care home staff have been instructed not to come to work if they&rsquo;re sick, Sowry says, and to remain off work until they&rsquo;ve had no symptoms for 48 hours. It has adequate PPE, he says, and is &ldquo;strictly enforcing&rdquo; the 14-day isolation policy for new residents.</p>
<p>Care home staff who are over 70, or have underlying health conditions, have been given the option of standing down on full pay, undertaking home-based roles, or continuing to work, Sowry says. &ldquo;If there were an outbreak, at-risk staff would immediately be stood down on full pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat, Quinn, and Ruth confirm their off-work colleagues are on 80 per cent of their wage – a substantial drop for those on minimum wage – while others are forced to eat into their leave.</p>
<p>Jones, of E tū, says residential aged care providers are, almost across the board, refusing to pay staff 100 per cent of their pay on special leave if they&rsquo;re stood down, sick, or staying away from their rest home because of the risks to them or residents. &ldquo;The worker should know that they&rsquo;re not going to be financially disadvantaged by doing the right thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Broken model needs fixed</p>
<p>Unions aren&rsquo;t the only ones saying the sector&rsquo;s broken. For years, the Aged Care Association has argued Government payments are inadequate.</p>
<p>Residential aged care is a strange blend of private and public, community care mixed with private gain. DHBs pay about $1.1 billion a year to rest homes, run by private companies, through contracted bed rates.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Health Minister David Clark announced the Government will provide up to $26 million of Covid-19 related costs to the aged care sector. But, like E tū, rest home owners and operators will be hoping the Government&rsquo;s focus on their costs isn&rsquo;t just about this moment.</p>
<p>Residential care facilities are under pressure and scrutiny.</p>
<p>Nine of the country&rsquo;s 16 deaths from Covid-19 have come from one rest home, Christchurch&rsquo;s Rosewood, which is now associated with 50 confirmed or probable cases.</p>
<p>Director general of health Ashley Bloomfield ordered a review of the six residential care facilities with confirmed cases, and DHBs are auditing rest homes for infection control procedures and processes. Chief Ombudsman Peter Boshier has also ordered urgent inspections of secure dementia units.</p>
<p>E tū&rsquo;s Jones says people nearing the end of their life should be safe, well-supported, and looked after. &ldquo;Rest homes really shouldn&rsquo;t be about business, they should be about respecting those vulnerable people in our society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Part of that picture, he says, is income protection for the workers who are putting themselves at risk to keep rest homes going during the pandemic. He hopes to raise the issue at a meeting with DHBs and the Ministry this coming Tuesday.</p>
<p>The aged care industry has been painting a picture of measures being taken putting a veritable shield over society&rsquo;s most vulnerable. However, according to its frontline workers, in some cases at least, for a variety of reasons, including insufficient funding, it is failing to do so.</p>
<p>The industry is so fragmented that it&rsquo;s applying best practice inconsistently, not just between organisations but within them. Two of the rest home workers spoken to by Newsroom say they hope the official reviews and audits reveal deficiencies at their facilities so they can be fixed.</p>
<p>North Island worker Sue says rest homes might be meeting the official staff-to-resident ratio guidelines, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean the elderly are getting the care they need, or deserve. More staff are needed to make rest homes safe, she says – and that means more money from the Ministry and DHBs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t working before, it&rsquo;s definitely a struggle now.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="eighth-rosewood-rest-home-resident-dies-from-covid-19-six-new-cases">Eighth Rosewood rest home resident dies from Covid-19, six new cases</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/media/22957851/jacinda-ardern-ashley-bloomfield.jpg?width=635&amp;height=395&amp;mode=crop" alt="img">
There is one new death and six new cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand, according to Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield.</p>
<p>The new death takes our total toll to 14. She was a woman in her 80s from the Rosewood rest home cluster in Christchurch where seven others have died.</p>
<p>Bloomfield said every person New Zealand loses to Covid-19 is a tragedy.</p>
<p>He is giving his daily press conference, along with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who has given an update on alert level 3, which comes into effect at 11.59 on Monday.</p>
<p>The total number of cases is now 1451. So far, 1036 have recovered. There are 11 people in hospital.</p>
<p>Ardern said three of the six cases today were connected to overseas travelers.</p>
<p>Those returning to New Zealand will continue having to be quarantined when they return.</p>
<p>There are 2403 people who have returned home that are in quarantine - in hotels.</p>
<p>Moving to level 3</p>
<p>Ardern encouraged people to &ldquo;support local businesses&rdquo; when NZ goes into level 3 and do research around if their favorite takeaway providers delivery, or contactless pickup.</p>
<p>Bloomfield said a new order means some businesses will be able to work over the coming days to prepare for level 3, if they can do so safely.</p>
<p>Ardern said she expected 400,000 people to return to work next week. &ldquo;Safety is paramount&rdquo; in moving to level 3.</p>
<p>She said work the Auckland City Rail link will continue in level 3 - more than 200 workers will get back to work.</p>
<p>That will ramp up to 400 over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>She said getting transport infrastructure projects back on track is a focus for the Government.</p>
<p>State Highway maintenance will also resume under level 3, she said.</p>
<p>There will be an announcement around hunting rules under level 3 tomorrow.</p>
<p>Breaches</p>
<p>Ardern provided a reminder to people that although the country is going into level 3 on Monday, New Zealand is still in level 4 this long ANZAC weekend.</p>
<p>Police told her that 99.99 per cent of people are obeying the rules but there had been 4128 breaches, 430 prosecutions and 115 youth referrals.</p>
<p>She urged Kiwis to stay home this weekend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we are looking forward to things we can do under level 3, we most not risk the gains that we have made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each and every one of these people breaching the rules risks undoing the work of others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over the long Easter weekend, Police were out in force stopping people who were outside their bubbles.</p>
<p>It is expected to be a similar situation this weekend.</p>
<p>Asked about iwi checkpoints across New Zealand, she said police have been working closely with iwis.</p>
<p>She said they have been &ldquo;operating within the law&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Police know the intention is to look after each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said she has had not reports of people being bullied at any checkpoints.</p>
<p>Ardern thanked all cleaners around the country.</p>
<p>She said they have been essential in preventing the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p>Small businesses</p>
<p>During the Epidemic Response Committee sitting yesterday, National Deborah Russell downplayed the economic impact of Covid-19 on businesses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are seeing businesses struggling after only a few weeks in a pretty bad situation, which must speak to the strength of those small businesses going into this lockdown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said she was worried that people had started a small business without understanding &ldquo;how to survive a setback&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Arden said today she disagreed with the comments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are seeing businesses struggling after only a few weeks in a pretty bad situation, which must speak to the strength of those small businesses going into this lockdown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said she was worried that people had started a small business without understanding &ldquo;how to survive a setback&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Random testing</p>
<p>There are still 16 clusters of Covid-19 around the country.</p>
<p>Yesterday there were 5289 tests - a record high. There have been more than 94,000 tests.</p>
<p>Bloomfield said there is wider testing across New Zealand, with a specific focus on Maori and Pasifika.</p>
<p>There will be more testing of selective groups across the country, he said. That means more random testing.</p>
<p>Vaccines</p>
<p>Ardern disagreed with assertions that the Government has not been good enough when it comes to the rollout of flue vaccinations.</p>
<p>She said older New Zealander have been prioritised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We moved early, we got more vaccines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ardern said she is not trivialising the opinions of frontline workers, who have had concerns with the rollout of flu vaccines.</p>
<p>Bloomfield said Pharmac has moved to secure 400,000 flu vaccines ahead of Covid-19.</p>
<p>He said the Ministry of Health has done more work than usual when it comes to the flu vaccines.</p>
<p>He said Kiwis can &ldquo;rest assured&rdquo; that the Government is already working actively on how the Government will distribute a Covid-19 vaccine once it becomes available.</p>
<p>Asked if GPs need more funding, Ardern said the Government has already provided money for those in this sector.</p>
<p>She added GPs are eligible for the wage subsidy.</p>
<p>Asked for her reaction to reports that front line health staff have been bullied for asking for more PPE equipment, Ardern said it was not acceptable.</p>
<p>She said the Government wants front line workers to have access to as much PPE equipment as they need.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not have an issue with the stock of PPE.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every time an issue was raised, the Government followed up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please keep giving us those examples so we can flush them out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a health system where workers should speak freely about concerns they have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Airline staff</p>
<p>Bloomfield said there are stringent guidelines in place for airline staff still flying internationally that are keeping air trade still going.</p>
<p>The guidelines would limit the chance of Covid-19 coming back into the country.</p>
<p>Canadian shooting</p>
<p>Arden said she reached out to Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to express New Zealand&rsquo;s sympathies after a mass shooting on Sunday.</p>
<p>A 51-year-old man went on a shooting rampage across the northern part of the Canadian province of Nova Scotia Sunday, killing 17 people, including a policewoman. Officials said the suspected shooter was also dead.</p>
<p>The man was identified as Gabriel Wortman and authorities said he disguised himself as a police officer in uniform at one point and mocked up a car to make it seem like a Royal Canadian Mounted Police cruiser.</p>
<p>He was arrested by the RCMP in a service station in Enfield, Nova Scotia, northwest of downtown Halifax. Police later announced that he had died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is one of the most senseless acts of violence in our province&rsquo;s history,&rdquo; said Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil.
