<p>The Maharashtra Cyber department on Sunday night issued an advisory cautioning people against sharing pictures of deceased actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s body, warning of legal action.</p>
<p>Disturbing pictures of Rajput’s mortal remains surfaced on WhatsApp mere hours after his demise. Within a short while, they made their way onto WhatsApp groups and other platforms like Twitter.</p>
<p>Several social media users expressed shock and outrage at those sharing the pictures just to gain visibility online.</p>
<p>Late on Sunday, the Cyber department tweeted, “A disturbing trend has been observed on Social Media platforms by Maharashtra Cyber that pictures of deceased actor Shri. Sushant Singh Rajput are being circulated, which are disturbing and in bad taste. It is emphasised that circulation of such pictures is against legal guidelines and court directions, and are liable to invite legal action. Maharashtra Cyber exhorts and directs all netizens to refrain from circulating the aforesaid pictures. The pictures already circulated should be deleted henceforth. (sic)”</p>
<p>Officials said with a medium like WhatsApp, tracing the original source of the pictures would be next to impossible. They said all social media platforms are being watched so action can be taken against anyone found sharing the pictures.

Actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his Mumbai home.</p>
<p>Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his home in Mumbai, police said today, confirming his suicide. He was 34.</p>
<p>The popular actor was recently seen in the film &ldquo;Chhichhore&rdquo; - which dealt with the extreme pressure of college and competitive exams. His last appearance was in the Netflix film &ldquo;Drive&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput had put up a moving post just last week when his former manager Disha Salian was found dead. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s such devastating news,&rdquo; the actor had written on Instagram.</p>
<p>His last post on Instagram was dedicated to his mother, whose death in 2002 left him devastated. &ldquo;Blurred past evaporating from teardrops, unending dreams carving an arc of smile And a fleeting life, negotiating between the two,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>Rajput, who became a household name with his hit television series &ldquo;Pavitra Rishta&rdquo;, debuted in films in 2013 with the critically acclaimed &ldquo;Kai Po Che!&rdquo; based on Chetan Bhagat&rsquo;s bestselling book &ldquo;The Three Mistakes of My Life&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The movie catapulted Rajput into the big league and he went on to do several films. He also played MS Dhoni in the former skipper&rsquo;s biopic, for which he was nominated for film awards.</p>
<p>He played the eponymous role of Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! in the 2015 thriller. He had a supporting role in Aamir Khan&rsquo;s 2014 hit PK. In 2018, Rajput starred in Kedarnath opposite debutante Sara Ali Khan.</p>
<p>Rajput was born in Patna. He studied engineering and was a National Olympiad Winner in Physics.</p>
<p>He said in interviews that after his involvement in theatre and dance, he rarely had time for studies. He eventually dropped out of engineering just a year short of his degree to pursue an acting career.</p>
<p>A shell-shocked film industry posted tributes on Twitter. &ldquo;Honestly this news has left me shocked and speechless&hellip;I remember watching #SushantSinghRajput in Chhichhore and telling my friend Sajid, its producer how much I&rsquo;d enjoyed the film and wish I&rsquo;d been a part of it. Such a talented actor&hellip;may God give strength to his family,&rdquo; Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No No No!!!!! Horrible heartbreaking news of the passing of #SushantSinghRajput ! Shocking &amp; sad beyond words!!! Goodbye Sushant.. you were such a wonderful performer and had such a long long way to go! Don&rsquo;t know what you were going through but I&rsquo;m sorry for your suffering! Red heart (sic),&rdquo; Swara Bhaskar posted, condoling his death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The news of Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s death is truly sad. What a tragic loss Deepest condolences to his family &amp; loved ones. May his soul find eternal peace,&rdquo; actor Ajay Devgn wrote.</p>
<p>Abhishek Bachchan tweeted: &ldquo;This is just so shocking. A wonderful talent. RIP Sushant&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Last month, death of seasoned actors - Rishi Kapoor and Irrfan Khan - left the country in grief and shock.</p>

It is sad shocking unbelievable but true. Sushant Singh Rajput is no more. The young actor who was just 34 ended his life by hanging himself in his bedroom. It seems he hung himself with his bedsheet. The news has sent shockwaves across the industry. The sad part is that the actor is not getting the dignity he deserved in death. Some pictures of his dead body from his bedroom are being circulated on social media. People have slammed the pictures as insensitive on social media. They have urged them to have some decency for the sake of his family. Sushant Singh Rajput was one of the few actors who made a successful transition from TV to films.

<p>Sushant Singh Rajput, an absolutely brilliant student from the Delhi Institute of Technology felt that he was more drawn towards the performing arts. He quit his studies in his third year and came to Mumbai. After reigning the world of TV, he made a foray in the world of Bollywood with Kai Po Che! in 2013. People marvelled at his acting. It is sad that he decided to leave it all behind in what might be a few moments of extreme weakness.

Sushant Singh Rajput Death: डेड बॉडी की तस्वीरें पोस्ट करने वाले लोगों पर भड़के स्टार्स, कहा- यह मनोरंजन नहीं</p>
<p>नई दिल्ली, जेएनएन। बॉलीवुड एक्टर सुशांत सिंह राजपूत ने रविवार को फांसी लगाकर आत्म हत्या कर ली है। सुशांत सिंह के निधन के बाद से सोशल मीडिया पर काफी लोग उनके प्रति दुख प्रकट कर रहे हैं और उनकी फिल्मों, पुरानी तस्वीरों और वीडियो के जरिए उन्हें याद कर रहे हैं। बॉलीवुड सेलेब्स, राजनीतिक, खेल से जुड़ी हस्तियों से लेकर आम जनता तक उन्हें याद कर रहे हैं। हालांकि, इसी बीच सोशल मीडिया पर उनके शव की तस्वीरें भी वायरल हो रही हैं और यूजर्स लगातार उनकी डेड बॉडी की तस्वीरें शेयर कर रहे हैं।</p>
<p>ऐसा कर रहे लोगों पर बॉलीवुड स्टार्स और कई अन्य यूजर्स ने गुस्सा व्यक्त किया है। सेलेब्स ने डेड बॉडी की तस्वीरें अपलोड कर रहे लोगों को खरी-खोटी सुनाई है और यूजर्स से अपील की है कि वो उन तस्वीरों को डिलीट कर दें। इतना ही ट्विटर पर एक #DELETE भी ट्रेंड कर रहा था, जिसमें लोग उन फोटो को डिलीट करने की अपील कर रहे हैं। इसी क्रम में फराह खान ने ट्वीट कर लिखा है- &lsquo;सुशांत सिंह राजपूत की यंग एज में मौत हो गई। उनके शव की तस्वीर वायरल करना बंद करें। यह एक दुर्घटना है मनोरंजन नहीं है। क्या हम इस दुनिया में रहते हैं ?&rsquo;</p>

<p>वहीं, एक्ट्रेस मीरा चोपड़ा ने भी डेड बॉडी की तस्वीरें शेयर करने पर गुस्सा जताया है। मीरा चोपड़ा ने ट्वीट कर लिखा है, &lsquo;कृपया सुशांत सिंह राजपूत के शव की तस्वीर वायरल करना बंद करें। यह काफी गंभीर है। बहुत से मीडिया हैंडल उनके शव की तस्वीर का इस्तेमाल कर रहे हैं। कृपया उन्हें डिलीट कर दें&rsquo;।</p>
<p>Plz stop putting the images of the dead body. Its highly insensitive. Lot of media handles doing it. Plz plz delete them. 🙏🙏🙏 — meera chopra (@MeerraChopra) June 14, 2020</p>
<p>स्टार्स के अलावा कई यूजर्स भी शव की तस्वीरें शेयर करने को गलत बता रहे हैं। बता दें कि सोशल मीडिया पर सुशांत सिंह की कुछ तस्वीरें वायरल हो रही हैं और दावा किया जा रहा है कि वो उनके फांसी लगाने के बाद की है। इन तस्वीरों में सुशांत ने काले रंग की टीशर्ट पहन रखी है।</p>

<p>भारतीय टीम के पूर्व कप्तान महेंद्र सिंह धोनी पर बनी फिल्म एमएस धोनी के अलावा छिछोरे, काय पो छे जैसी अन्य फिल्मों में बेहतरीन किरदार निभाने वाले अभिनेता सुशांत सिंह राजपूत की आत्महत्या से फिल्म जगत से लेकर उनके चाहने वाले प्रशंसकों को गहरा आघात लगा है। समझ नहीं पा रहे हैं कि अपनी जिंदगी में इतना पॉजिटिव रहने वाला इंसान इतनी जल्दी कैसे हार मान सकता है। और इस तरह का आत्महत्या का कदम कैसे उठा सकता है।</p>
<p>अभिनेता सुशांत सिंह को नजदीक से जानने वाले वाराणसी के सुंदरपुर निवासी हर्ष राय को जैसे ही मालूम चला तो अवाक रह गए। मुंबई के टीवी सीरियल में काम करने वाले कलाकार हर्ष राय ने बताया कि अभी साल भर पहले ही सुशांत सिंह से एक शूटिंग के दौरान नेक्शन स्टूडियो में मुलाकात हुई थी। उस समय ढेरों बातें हुईं थी, सुशांत कहते थे कि सफलता एक दिन में नहीं मिलती, उसके लिए कठोर परिश्रम, त्याग और लगन की जरूरत होती है।</p>
<p>इसके बाद सुशांत सिंह से व्हाट्सअप और सोशल मीडिया पर भी बातचीत का सिलसिला जारी रहता था। अपनी लाइफ में वह बहुत सकारात्मक रहते थे और अपने काम से बेइंतहा मोहब्बत करते थे। मुंबई के कुछ और अन्य साथी कलाकारों से बात हुई तो सभी ने सुशांत के इस कदम से हैरानी जताई।</p>
<p>पता चला कि तीन-चार महीने से डिप्रेशन की दवा खा रहे थे। ट्विटर और इंस्टाग्राम पर भी इधर कई दिनों से एक्टिव नहीं थे। दिसंबर 2019 को लास्ट ट्विटर अपडेट था और इंस्टाग्राम पर 2 जून को अपनी मां के साथ पोस्ट शेयर की थी।</p>
<p>कोरोना काल के दौरान फिल्म जगत से जुड़े कई चर्चित कलाकारों का निधन हुआ। पिछले माह ही इरफान खान, ऋषि कपूर, संगीतकार वाजिद खान का निधन हुआ। एक के बाद एक कलाकारों के जाने से प्रशंसकों में शोक है।
