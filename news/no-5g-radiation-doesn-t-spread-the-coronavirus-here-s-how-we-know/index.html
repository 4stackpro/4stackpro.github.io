A conspiracy theory claiming 5G can spread the coronavirus is making the rounds on social media. The myth supposedly gained traction when a Belgian doctor linked the &ldquo;dangers&rdquo; of 5G technology to the virus during an interview in January.</p>
<p>Closer to home, Facebook group Stop5G Australia (with more than 31,700 members) has various posts linking the disease&rsquo;s spread to 5G technology.</p>
<p>Peddling such misinformation is not only wrong, it&rsquo;s destructive.</p>
<p>The Guardian reported that since Thursday at least 20 mobile phone masts across the UK have been torched or otherwise vandalised. Mobile network representative MobileUK published an open letter stating:</p>
<p>We have experienced cases of vandals setting fire to mobile masts, disrupting critical infrastructure and spreading false information suggesting a connection between 5G and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The Stop5G Australia Facebook group. (Facebook)</p>
<p>Celebrities - stick to what you know</p>
<p>Many outlets and people have rushed to debunk this myth, including federal minister for communications, cyber safety and the arts Paul Fletcher. But myriad groups and public figures continue to perpetuate it.</p>
<p>Actor Woody Harrelson and singer Keri Hilson have both shared content with fans suggesting a link between 5G and COVID-19.</p>
<p>This tweet by someone with 4M followers is straight from the most dangerous depths of tin foil hat land.</p>
<p>☑️ COVID-19 is a virus spread by person-to-person contact, not radio waves.</p>
<p>☑️ FCC, FDA, EPA &amp; others all clear on the false claim that 5G is unsafe:https://t.co/uuF3fs2bDc pic.twitter.com/1hXyV4lE6c — Brendan Carr (@BrendanCarrFCC) March 16, 2020</p>
<p>Stop5G Australia members have claimed the Ruby Princess cruiseliner&rsquo;s link to 600 reported infections and 11 deaths is because cruises are &ldquo;radiation saturated&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>Posts from the Stop5G Australia Facebook group.</p>
<p>While cruise passengers can access roaming wifi services on board, these are not 5G services. Maritime cruises have yet to implement 5G technology.</p>
<p>One petition is calling on the Australia government to stop 5G&rsquo;s rollout because the technology can supposedly &ldquo;negatively affect your immune system&rdquo; (a claim for which there is exactly zero evidence). It has received more than 27,000 signatures.</p>
<p>How 5G radio signals (radiation) work</p>
<p>The difference between 5G and previous generations of mobile services (4G, 3G) is that the latter uses lower radio frequencies (in the 6 gigahertz range), whereas 5G uses frequencies in the 30–300 gigahertz range.</p>
<p>Frequencies along the electromagnetic spectrum. (Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency/AUS GOV)</p>
<p>In the 30-300 gigahertz range, there&rsquo;s not enough energy to break chemical bonds or remove electrons when in contact with human tissue. Thus, this range is referred to as &ldquo;non-ionising&rdquo; electromagnetic radiation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s approved by the federal government&rsquo;s Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency as not having the negative health effects of more intense radiation.</p>
<p>Radiation can come into contact with the skin, for example, when we put a 5G mobile to our ear to make a call. This is when we&rsquo;re most exposed to non-ionising radiation. But this exposure is well below the recommended safety level.</p>
<p>5G radiation can&rsquo;t penetrate skin, or allow a virus to penetrate skin. There is no evidence 5G radio frequencies cause or exacerbate the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Also, the protein shell of the virus is incapable of hijacking 5G radio signals. This is because radiation and viruses exist in different forms that do not interact. One is a biological phenomenon and the other exists on the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>
<p>5G radio waves are called millimetre waves, because their wavelength is measured in millimetres. Because these waves are short, 5G cell towers need to be relatively close together - about 250 metres apart. They are organised as a collection of small cells (a cell is an area covered by radio signals).</p>
<p>For 5G to cover a larger geographic area, more base stations are needed in comparison to 4G. This increase in the number of base stations, and their proximity to humans, is one factor that may stir unfounded fears about 5G&rsquo;s potential health impacts.</p>
<p>Your phone may be dangerous, but its radiation isn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>COVID-19 spreads through small droplets released from the nose or mouth of an infected person when they cough, spit, sneeze, talk or exhale. Transmission occurs when the droplets come into contact with the nose, eyes or mouth of a healthy person.</p>
<p>So if an infectious person speaks through a phone held near their mouth, enough infectious droplets may land on its surface to make it capable of spreading the virus. This is why it&rsquo;s not advisable to share mobiles during a pandemic. You should also regularly disinfect your mobile.</p>
<p>A #coronavirus conspiracy theory in the U.K. spurred a rash of 5G telecom tower arson fires in Belfast, Liverpool, Birmingham https://t.co/VtShMhcAV5 pic.twitter.com/eoPYjaOgib — QuickTake by Bloomberg (@QuickTake) April 7, 2020</p>
<p>Why are we having this discussion?</p>
<p>To many of us, it&rsquo;s obvious a human virus can&rsquo;t spread via radio signals, and such a conspiracy may be linked to a wider distrust of the government in general.</p>
<p>Addressing this myth is critical as property is now being damaged, and individuals attacked. Physical and verbal threats to broadband engineers can be added to a long list of assaults on health workers.</p>
<p>At a time when millions are relying on fast internet to work and study from home, vital telecommunications infrastructure is at risk of being destroyed. Conspiracy theories have motivated arson attacks on 5G towers in Belfast, Liverpool and Birmingham.</p>
<p>Youtube has announced it will devote resources to removing content linking 5G technology to COVID-19.</p>
<p>The announcement came after fingers were pointed at one video, published on March 18 (and viewed more than 668,000 times), in which an American doctor claims incorrectly that Africa is less affected by COVID-19 because it&rsquo;s not a 5G region. The video remained online at the time of publishing this article.</p>

5G explained: How the phone network works — and why we know it&rsquo;s not dangerous, despite coronavirus conspiracies</p>
<p>There is no scientific evidence suggesting 5G harms humans</p>
<p>By Rhiannon Williams Tuesday, 7th April 2020, 5:43 pm Updated Tuesday, 7th April 2020, 5:44 pm</p>
<p>As misinformation spreads across the internet, it&rsquo;s important to be aware of what 5G is and what it is and isn&rsquo;t capable of.</p>
<p>Conspiracy theorists have been setting phone masts in Birmingham, Belfast and Merseyside on fire as unfounded fears over the technology run rampant, distracting emergency services from helping vulnerable people and damaging crucial communications networks during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>What is 5G and how does it work?</p>
<p>Smartphones, telecoms infrastructure, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth all use radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RM EMFs) to communicate with other devices. The way these RF EMFs are used are known as wireless standards, with 5G the fifth major iteration.</p>
<p>5G has been designed to provide significantly faster download speeds than 4G, 3G and its other predecessor networks, alongside a more reliable connection and lower latency (the delay experienced before data transfer begins). Like its predecessors, it uses radio signals over a range of frequency bands to transmit and receive voice and data by communicating with base stations - stationary radio transmitters with antennas mounted on masts or buildings.</p>
<p>5G differs from the previous wireless standards because some of its technologies use higher EMF frequencies and require additional antennas to utilise them.</p>
<p>How do we know 5G is safe?</p>
<p>The radio waves transmitted by base stations are a form of non-ionising electromagnetic radiation falling at the lower end of the naturally-occurring electromagnetic spectrum, which is measured in frequency and wavelength.</p>
<p>Non-ionising radiation includes infra-red, ultraviolet and visible light, FM radio and Wi-Fi signals, and is too weak to break chemical bonds - thus cannot cause DNA or tissue damage. Ionising radiation, conversely, includes gamma and X-rays and can cause cancer and other health issues.</p>
<p>5G&rsquo;s wavelength does not generate enough energy to damage cells and cause tumours or cancer, unlike ultraviolet radiation from the sun, making sunlight a higher risk to your health than 5G.</p>

<p>Additionally, 5G spectrum has actually been used in the UK by the Ministry of Defence, satellite services, Freeview TV and wireless microphones for many years - just not by mobile operators.</p>
<p>The active 5G networks in the country from O2, Three, Vodafone and EE use frequencies primarily between 3.4 gigahertz (a unit of electromagnetic waves frequency measurement) and 3.6GHz. To put that into context, a TV transmission uses frequencies of up to 806 MHz (megahertz), while Wi-Fi is between 2 GHz and 5 GHz. 4G, 3G and 2G services operate on radio spectrum between 800MHz and 2.6GHz.</p>
<p>Public Health England has advised UK network operators to comply with guidelines from the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), a non-profit based in Germany which publishes scientific-based advice on the adverse effects of non-ionising radiation backed by both the World Health Organisation (WHO) and International Telecommunication Union (ITU).</p>
<p>The ICNIRP updated its international guidelines for the protection of humans exposed to RF EMF in March to include updated 5G guidance, with chairman Dr Eric van Rongen stating &ldquo;the most important thing for people to remember is that 5G technologies will not be able to cause harm when these new guidelines are adhered to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the ICNIRP&rsquo;s previous guidelines, which were published in 1998, would have been adequate to provide protection for 5G technologies, the new guidelines ensure it will not be able to cause harm &ldquo;regardless of our current expectations,&rdquo; the body said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The guidelines have been developed after a thorough review of all relevant scientific literature, scientific workshops and an extensive public consultation process. They provide protection against all scientifically substantiated adverse health effects due to [EMF] exposure in the 100 kHz to 300 GHz range,&rdquo; Dr van Rongen added.

<h3 id="people-are-saying-coronavirus-is-a-cover-up-for-5g---heres-why-its-not--euronews-answers">People are saying coronavirus is a cover up for 5G - here&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s not | Euronews answers</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/61/04/24/1000x563_cmsv2_068023cd-917d-503d-992b-658aef98285d-4610424.jpg" alt="img">
An increasing number of conversations on and offline have claimed to find insidious links between the roll out of 5G networks and coronavirus.</p>
<p>Claims suggesting that COVID-19 serves as a cover up for health hazards of 5G, or that the technology itself suppresses the immune system are just two of a number of theories in circulation that experts say are &ldquo;baseless&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But celebrities have also joined the conversation, with US actor Woody Harrelson sharing a post on Instagram that linked 5G to the pandemic, and TV personality Jason Gardiner suggesting the World Health Organisation had warned against the mobile network due to the illness.</p>
<p>In the UK, the situation further intensified after reports that at least one phone mast was suspected to have been deliberately set on fire.</p>
<p>Woody Harrelson shared a post to Instagram making a link between 5G and the virus 2019 Invision Richard Shotwell</p>
<p>Network provider EE told Euronews in an email that its engineers were currently assessing the cause of a blaze at a mast in Birmingham that had caused &ldquo;significant damage&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The company said: &ldquo;If it transpires that it was arson, which looks likely at this time, then we will work to help West Midlands Police identify a culprit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To deliberately take away mobile connectivity at a time when people need more than ever to stay connected to each other is a reckless, harmful and dangerous thing to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will try to restore full coverage as quickly as possible, but the damage caused by the fire is significant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>West Midlands Police are yet to confirm the cause.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Burn all the 5G masts down&rsquo;</p>
<p>A video that allegedly showed the fire was shared in a local Facebook group, in which one user replied: &ldquo;Good!! All these need to get burnt down!! Coronavirus is just a cover up&hellip; its 5G killing everyone. Its too powerful. These all need to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another user said: &ldquo;Get them all taken off or burn them. Save lives - simple reason if police ask what made you do it. Simple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lives are precious and these material things are destroying life. Shame on government knowing what is going on in the world but keeping quiet and blaming rats and bats in China.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So - with this furore, is there actually any truth to the claims? And if so, should we be concerned?</p>
<p>What is 5G?</p>
<p>5G is a wireless mobile network that was deployed in 2019 to help improve telecommunications and mobile connectivity.</p>
<p>It works at a higher wave frequency than its predecessors in order to allow for this upgrade in usage.</p>
<p>What are the claims relating to 5G being harmful to health?</p>
<p>Prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, there were already discussions about the effects 5G could have on a person&rsquo;s health, due to these higher frequencies and the type of radiation it emits.</p>
<p>But since the outbreak, the 5G conversation seems to have found itself linked to the disease with people claiming it could exacerbate the spread through its frequencies, or by suppressing the immune system.</p>
<p>Others have claimed the virus is, in fact, being used to cover up dangerous effects of the mobile network.</p>
<p>So - is 5G linked to coronavirus?</p>
<p>The short answer is no.</p>
<p>In fact, the UK government has gone further to say there is &ldquo;absolutely no credible link&rdquo; between the two.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mobile UK, a trade union for British mobile providers, also commented on the &ldquo;baseless&rdquo; claims that it said were &ldquo;not grounded in accepted scientific theory&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More worryingly,&rdquo; it added: &ldquo;Some people are also abusing our key workers and making threats to damage infrastructure under the pretence of claims about 5G.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not acceptable and only impacts on our ability as an industry to maintain the resilience and operational capacity of the networks to support mass home working and critical connectivity to the emergency services, vulnerable consumers and hospitals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>READ MORE:</p>
<p>Yusuf Sambo, a researcher at the University of Glasgow who is testing 5G in Scotland, told AFP that while he could acknowledge other health fears, they had nothing to do with viruses.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;Yes, there are fears about the health implications of 5G but they have to do with cancer and not viral infections.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is 5G linked to any health hazards at all?</p>
<p>Electromagnetic waves emit electromagnetic radiation, which at high frequencies are believed to pose a risk of causing cancer.</p>
<p>However, low frequencies - such as 5G frequencies - produce a non-ionising form of radiation that is not thought to be able to penetrate and damage cells.</p>
<p>5G frequencies may be higher than that of 4G and other earlier networks, but they are still far lower than the limits stipulated in international guidelines.</p>
<p>The World Health Organisation, which has a detailed guide on the mobile network, said &ldquo;no adverse health effect has been causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies&rdquo;, even after &ldquo;much research&rdquo; was carried out.</p>
<p>It noted that only a few studies had been carried out on the frequencies used by 5G, but &ldquo;provided that the overall exposure remains below international guidelines, no consequences for public health are anticipated.&rdquo;
