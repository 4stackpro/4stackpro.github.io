Jerry Bishop, the veteran radio personality who was the off-camera announcer for the courtroom television show “Judge Judy,” died Tuesday after a brief illness. He was 84.</p>
<p>Bishop’s death was confirmed by his granddaughter Allison Rosenbloom, who said he suffered from heart complications and kidney failure.</p>
<p>Bishop, a resident of Bel-Air, had a career as a radio personality in Los Angeles for three decades. He got his start in radio at Hartford, Conn., station WDRC and moved to the West Coast in 1963, landing at KCBQ in San Diego. Two years later he moved to Los Angeles to join KLAC.</p>
<p>Bishop joined KFI in 1969, when it was the top “middle of the road” format station in the Los Angeles market. During his five-year stint there, he co-hosted “Sports Phone,” a call-in program that preceded the station’s broadcasts of the Los Angeles Dodgers games. He later moved to KIIS, where he partnered with Tom Murphy to host the “Tom and Jerry Show” in 1979.</p>

<p>Bishop launched a successful voice-over career in the mid-1970s, serving as announcer for the syndicated game show “Cross-Wits” and the NBC variety series “Dick Clark’s Live Wednesday.” He was heard on commercials for several national brands and did on-air promos for ABC, NBC and the Disney Channel.</p>
<p>Bishop signed on to “Judge Judy” when it first launched 24 years ago and remained a familiar fixture during its run as the most-watched show in daytime. Rosenbloom said he recorded his final voice-over session for the program several weeks ago before he entered the hospital.</p>
<p>“Everybody loved him,” Judge Judy Sheindlin said in a statement. “He had a golden heart and generous spirit. I adored him and will miss him.”</p>

<p>Bishop was born Gerald Blume on Oct. 19, 1935, in Hartford. He earned a degree in broadcast journalism at Emerson College before he embarked on his radio career. He married Velma Joan Leventhal in 1956. She died in 2007.</p>
<p>Along with Allison Rosenbloom, Bishop is survived by his three daughters, Karen Rosenbloom, Michelle Carriker and Stephanie Blume, grandchildren Brandon Rosenbloom and Zachary Carriker, and a brother, Daniel Blume.

<h3 id="watch-exclusive-clip-from-new-duncanville-with-judge-judy">Watch: Exclusive Clip From New ‘Duncanville’ with Judge Judy</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.animationmagazine.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Duncanville.jpg" alt="img">
Duncanville</p>
<p>We have an exclusive clip from this Sundays’ (April 26) episode of FOX-TV’s popular freshman show Duncanville. The episode, which is called “Judge Annie” finds Jack (Ty Burrell) and Annie (Amy Poehler) taking their kids to a secret spot that they used to go when they were kids. Guest voice is provided by none other than Judy Sheindlin (Judge Judy)!</p>
<p>Here is the official synopsis: “When their local swimming pool is overcrowded due to a heatwave, Annie and Jack share their old swimming spot with the kids. Everything is awesome, until a rich resident buys the land, drains the swimming hole and takes the kids to court for trespassing. Then, Annie’s court confrontation with the rich resident leads to her getting her own public access court show in the all-new “Judge Annie” episode of Duncanville airing Sunday, April 26 (8:30-9:00 PM ET/PT) on FOX.</p>
<p>Duncanville is co-created and exec produced by Mike Scully and Julie Scully (The Simpsons, Parks and Recreation) and Amy Poehler (Parks and Recreation, SNL), and is also exec produced by Dave Becky. The series is animated by Bento Box Entertainment (Bob’s Burgers). FOX recently ordered a second season of the show to air during the 2021-2022 season. Duncanville follows a spectacularly average 15-year-old boy with a rich fantasy life, and the people in his world.</p>
<p>In the series, Duncan (voiced by Poehler) can see adulthood on the horizon: money, freedom, cars, girls … but the reality is more like: always being broke, driving with your mom sitting shotgun and babysitting your little sister. He’s not exceptional, but he has a wild imagination in which he’s never anything less than amazing. Poehler also voices Duncan’s mother, Annie, and Emmy Award winner Ty Burrell voices Duncan’s father, Jack. The series also features the voices of Emmy Award nominee Riki Lindhome, Betsy Sodaro, Yassir Lester and Zach Cherry, as well as guest voices Rashida Jones, Wiz Khalifa and Joy Osmanski.</p>
<p>Season-to-date, Duncanville averages 2.3 million multiplatform viewers and is FOX’s most-streamed new comedy this season, while its premiere is FOX’s most-streamed animated debut on record (seven-day average). You can read our interview with Mike and Julie Scully here
