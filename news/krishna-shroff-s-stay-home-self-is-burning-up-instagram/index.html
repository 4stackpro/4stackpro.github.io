<p>Highlights Krishna Shroff shared a pic of her toned physique</p>
<p>She captioned it with the black heart emoji</p>
<p>Tiger Shroff dropped a comment</p>
<p>Krishna Shroff, who recently shared her &ldquo;fat&rdquo; to fit story in an Instagram conversation, shared yet another photo of herself in intimates and simply captioned it with a black heart emoji. In the Instagram photo, Krishna can be seen clicking a mirror selfie, while the light streaming from the window focuses on her toned mid-riff. Krishna&rsquo;s brother, actor Tiger Shroff turned out to be among those, who were in awe of Krishna Shroff&rsquo;s fit physique. He posted the speak-no-evil monkey emoji to express how amazed he is. Needless to say that Krishna&rsquo;s post is burning up Instagram and how! &ldquo;Curves and muscles, how a woman should be,&rdquo; read a comment while another added: &ldquo;This girl is fire.&rdquo; Another user wrote: &ldquo;Your fitness is inspirational,&rdquo; while another one added: &ldquo;Fire, girl. Most people don&rsquo;t look better in quarantine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a recent interactive session on Instagram, Krishna Shroff was asked by a fan the secret to her fitness, when she said: &ldquo;Being a fat kid for 15 years of my life is definitely motivation enough to keep at it now that I have made it this far.&rdquo; She also shared a throwback photo from when she was in school. Dressed in baggy clothes, she looks pretty unrecognisable in the photo.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Krishna has been posting more glimpses of what&rsquo;s keeping her busy in lockdown.</p>
<p>Krishna&rsquo;s feed is filled with videos of her work-out sessions and also features her boyfriend, basketball player Eban Hyams.</p>
<p>Krishna Shroff, who is a bona-fide fitness enthusiast, co-owns an MMA training centre named MMA Matrix along with Tiger Shroff. Krishna has clarified in interviews that she has no interest in taking up acting as a career.

<p>Krishna Shroff, sister of actor Tiger Shroff, may have deleted her recent working out and vacation pictures with boyfriend Eban Hyams but all is well between the two. The couple is spending time in each other’s company during lockdown and have spoken about their relationship in a recent interview.</p>
<p>In an interview with Spotboye, Krishna shared how she was instantly attracted to him the moment she met him. “He is very attractive, really my type,” adding, “Over time it became much stronger because I started getting to know him. We shared so much of the same interests. We are so comfortable with each other and have so much in common.”</p>
<p>Eban also agreed to Krishna and said, “The personalities that we have are so similar. Sometimes, she reminds me of my mother and I want to be like my father. The qualities she has are the ones you look for. That’s what made our bond so much stronger.”</p>
<p>Krishna Shroff and Eban Hyams during their Mizoram vacation (left) and on their return at the Mumbai airport in March amid coronavirus crisis (right).</p>
<p>On being enquired about who proposed whom, Krishna revealed it was Eban who confessed his feelings first. She said, “I didn’t have to really think about it, it came very easily.”</p>
<p>Also read: Ranveer Singh on the lookout for the fan who turned him into Tiger King’s Joe Exotic. See pic</p>
<p>Krishna also spilled the beans about how her family reacted to their relationship. She revealed that her mother Ayesha Shroff was going through her posts on Instagram and said about Eban’s picture with her, “He is cute.” While Tiger had been regularly seeing them hanging out together at the gym, Jackie Shroff found about the two of them only when the media started posting about them.</p>
<p>Jackie is currently away from the family at his farmhouse between Mumbai-Pune highway as he couldn’t return home when a nationwide lockdown was announced. Meanwhile, Tiger, Krishna and Ayesha are in Mumbai.</p>
