What if someone tells you that you have a hundred days to live? Would you curse your fate and cry about it, or pledge to live out your last days full of thrill, one adventure at a time.</p>
<p>Hotstar Special series Hundred takes us to the life of Netra Patil, (Rinku Rajguru) an honest, selfless civil servant, who is also a Bollywood buff and dreams of going to Switzerland one day. In stark contrast to the dream world that she often gets lost in, is her reality, where Netra lives with her father, grandfather and younger brother, in a chawl in Mumbai.</p>
<p>Being the sole breadwinner of the house and putting her family before herself, Netra is compared to a ‘Kadi Patta’ (Curry Tree) by her maternal uncle, who urges her to start living for herself. When she is told that she has a brain tumour and she has just a hundred days to live, Netra decides to change her life around and do the things she always wanted to.</p>
<p>Then there is ACP Saumya (Lara Dutta). She lives on her own terms, unapologetically. Even if it means using people close to her for her own benefit. Despite her strong position and personality, she is subjected to constant sexism at work. Her boss, DCP Anshuman (Parmeet Sethi) prefers to have her attend flash mobs or Women’s Day special functions instead of allowing her to chase a lead on an important case.</p>
<p>When the two women team up to fulfil their personal objectives, an entertaining ride ensues.</p>
<p>The first episode of Hundred establishes all the main characters and the plot. The series then moves at a comfortable pace throughout. The climax though appears to be a bit abrupt. You can easily watch the show in a single sitting. There are eight episodes in total, and each one of them ends on a cliffhanger, making you want to hit the ‘Next Episode’ button instantaneously.</p>
<p>The story has various twists. While some fit, others appear to be a bit forced. The romance angle between Maddy (Karan Wahi) and Saumya, for instance, wasn’t really needed.</p>
<p>There is action and humour too, but it is limited. We would have loved ACP Saumya fire more bullets or Netra beat up more goons. And, we wish the series had more jokes.</p>
<p>WATCH THE TRAILER OF HUNDRED:</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the biggest strength of Hundred lies in its characters. Almost every major character has its own aspirations to fulfil. Be it Netra wanting to live life to the fullest, Saumya striving hard to be recognised for her work, Parvin (Sudhanshu Pandey) looking for media attention through a powerful case or Maddy trying to enter the world of showbiz, every character is well defined, well written, and well performed.</p>
<p>Lara Dutta makes an impressive web-series debut with the show. She not only plays a fierce and headstrong ACP officer, but also a wife and a daughter. The actress lets her eyes do the talking in various scenes and delivers every dialogue with finesse.</p>
<p>Sairat fame Rinku Rajguru makes a ‘Zingaat’ entry into the digital space. With her intense expressions, appropriate body language and flawless portrayal of the carefree Netra, Rinku steals the show in various segments.</p>
<p>Karan Wahi emerges as the surprise package. The actor plays a struggling rapper in the film and aces that Haryanvi dialect. He is an absolute delight to watch and makes us cry when he cries, and smile when he does.</p>
<p>Other supporting actors including Sudhanshu Pandey, Parmeet Sethi, Makarand Deshpande and Arun Nalawade have done full justice to their parts.</p>
<p>Hundred is infused with fitting background music which turns from cheerful to intense in the blink of an eye. The costume and make-up designers have also done a fine job, adding glamour only where it is required.</p>
<p>In all, despite a few hiccups, the show is an entertaining ride and deserves to be on your watch-list this weekend.</p>
<p>PS: Watch out for the numerous Bollywood references and the wonderful portrayal of Aamchi Mumbai.</p>
