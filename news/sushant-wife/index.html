<p>Singh Sushant and his wife Suhani Singh stopped living together in 2016.</p>
<p>In 2018, Sushant flew from Vancouver to Mumbai and back.</p>
<p>The flights were charged to the credit card of his estranged wife.</p>
<p>The woman claimed that her credit card was used by Sushant without her permission.</p>
<p>Sushant, for his part, suggested that the woman used her credit card to create “trouble” for him.</p>
<p>The estranged couple’s dispute was decided by a B.C. Civil Resolution Tribunal, which found the man’s argument not credible.</p>
<p>“I find it unlikely that Ms. Singh would book expensive flights to her own credit card in Mr. Singh’s name, only to make ‘trouble’ for him,” tribunal member Julie K. Gibson noted.</p>
<p>In her reasons for decision, Gibson stated that it is “unlikely for someone to incur several thousand dollars in personal credit card debt to make a point”.</p>
<p>Gibson noted that she considered the man’s submission that, because he no longer lived with Singh, he did not have access to her credit card.</p>
<p>“Because access to a physical credit card is not required for online purchases, I find that Mr. Singh could have made the bookings with only Ms. Singh’s credit card details,” according to Gibson.</p>
<p>Gibson found that Singh charged $2,798.31 to the woman’s credit card.</p>
<p>The woman had already received a $818.91 refund, but Singh must pay her the difference of $1,979.40.</p>
<p>Gibson ordered the man to pay back $1,979.40, plus $80.79 in interest and $125 in tribunal fees, for a total of $2,185.19.

<h3 id="dawood-ibrahim-wife-mehjabeen-admitted-to-army-hospital-in-karachi-after-testing-positive-for-coronavirus-report">&ldquo;Dawood Ibrahim, wife Mehjabeen admitted to Army hospital in Karachi after testing positive for coronavirus: Report&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.jagranimages.com/images/2020/jun/dwaood1591357412805.jpg" alt="img">
New Delhi | Jagran News Desk: Underworld don Dawood Ibrahim and his wife Mehjabeen Shaikh have reportedly tested positive for the highly contagious coronavirus and have been admitted at the Army hospital in Karachi, CNN News 18 quoted top government sources as saying.</p>
<p>According to the CNN News 18 report, Dawood&rsquo;s personal staff and guards have been quarantined.</p>
<p>So far, Pakistan has reported 89,249 coronavirus cases in the country and 1,838 deaths. According to Pakistan&rsquo;s Ministry of National Health Service said that 68 patients died in the last 24 hours, taking the death toll to 1,838, whereas another 31,198 people have recovered.</p>
<p>Dawood Ibrahim, who is believed to be living in Pakistan&rsquo;s Karachi, is the main accused of the 1993 Bombay blasts that claimed the lives of more than 300 people and injured over 1,300. The D-Company boss also carries a reward of USD 25 million on his head for the 1993 Bombay blasts.</p>
<p>Pakistan, however, has denied that Dawood Ibrahim is not in its country.</p>
<p>After the bombings, he reportedly fled to Pakistan and currently stays in Karachi. He was designated as a global terrorist by India and the United States of America in 2003.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another report suggests that Dawood Ibrahim has joined hands with Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and is planning to carry out another attack similar to the 26/11 Mumbai terror strike. The report claims that the two are planning to send weapons to Gujarat and Maharashtra via sea route and looking at the coronavirus crisis as an opportunity to target Indian cities.</p>
<p>According to the US, Dawood maintains close links with terror outfit al-Qaeda. As a result, the US declared him a &ldquo;global terrorist&rdquo; and pursued the matter before the United Nations in an attempt to freeze his assets across the world and crack down on his operations.</p>
<p>Dawood&rsquo;s aide Moti faces extradition to the US on charges of money laundering, extortion and conspiracy to import unlawful substances such as heroine.</p>
<p>Moti was arrested by Scotland Yard officers from a London hotel in August 2018 in connection with a US grand jury indictment following an extensive FBI investigation.</p>

Gulabo Sitabo actor Nalneesh Neel reveals he has learnt a lot from Amitabh Bachchan during the film’s shoot. “It was a great moment working with Amitabh sir. He has great energy on the set. We worked together before in an advertisement shoot, and now this film. I feel fortunate because people only dream of working with him,” Nalneesh said. “We went for a reading session at his residence in Mumbai and it was an amazing experience. I got to learn a lot of things from him and his dedication towards work. He makes his co-stars comfortable. He is a very supportive person and helped me a lot to improvise,” added the actor. Gulabo Sitabo: 7 Times We Loved When Amitabh Bachchan Relished in Being Unapologetically Grey in His Movies.</p>
<p>In the Shoojit Sircar directorial, Nalneesh Neel plays the caretaker of Fatima Mahal, the mansion owned by Fatima Begum, who is the wife of Mirza, Amitabh Bachchan’s protagonist. Nalneesh’s character has no dialogues because he is mute in the story. “I, my wife and our son are very close to Mirza Shaikh (Amitabh Bachchan) and Fatima Begum (Farrukh Jafar) and take care of them. Amitabh sir and I had some funny moments together while filming in Lucknow,” recalled the actor. Amitabh Bachchan Watches Gulabo Sitabo With Entire Family at Home, Says ‘An Experience That Has Happened for First Time’</p>
<p>“I had very few conversations with him and spoke mostly during our rehearsals. His behaviour on the set was humble and kind. We used to have a gala time on the set to make the mood light. He used to make everyone laugh,” Nalneesh added. However, despite getting an opportunity to work with Amitabh Bachchan twice, Nalneesh has a major regret — not being able to click a photograph with him.</p>
<p>“When I did the ad shoot, I couldn’t take a picture with him. Even during this film, I couldn’t click a picture with him. On the last day of the shoot, I felt very shy to ask him for a photo. At one point of time, I gathered some courage to approach him and he replied, ‘haan bolo’. I told him that my mother wants to talk to you. Then he spoke to my entire family via video call and praised my work,” revealed the actor. Directed by Shoojit Sircar, “Gulabo Sitabo” also stars Ayushmann Khurrana, Vijay Raaz, Brijendra Kala, Srishti Shrivastava and Farrukh Jafar. The movie premiered on Amazon Prime Video on Friday.</p>
