Tomorrowland set to be at high risk of cancelation</p>
<p>By Barbara Potrc 263</p>
<p>The Coronavirus pandemic has really taken its toll on the music industry, with numerous events already getting cancelled, now the whole summer festival season is at risk, including one of the biggest electronic dance music festivals in Europe, Tomorrowland. The festival which is set to take place in Boom, Belgium, the last two weekends in July annually attracts more than 400.000 visitors from all around the world, which in times like this really doesn’t seem like a good idea. With no certain finish line in sight for the virus, we can only hope that things slowly start getting back to normal.</p>
<p>The mayors of Boom and Rumst aren’t too fond of the idea of the festival moving forward with their 2020 edition. The cancelation of the event isn’t in their hands, but they can share their opinion and give advice to the National Security Council of Belgium. For a local newspaper they said:</p>
<p>“As it stands now, we don’t think it would be wise to continue the 2020 edition, since we are in a federal phase, it is the National Security Council that has to make this decision, but we can send our advice to the Security Council and we will do that soon. Based on what we know now, it doesn’t look like an international recreational event in July could be a healthy consideration. It is time to clarify this.”</p>
<p>However Tomorrowland organisers are still hoping for a miracle, as they continue with the preparations for the event. They are currently in close consultation with the local authorities and waiting for the instructions of the national government. Debby Wilmsen, Tomorrowland’s press agent says:</p>
<p>“It goes without saying that the well-being, health and safety of our visitors, crew, neighbours and everyone else involved is in first place.”</p>
<p>On Friday afternoon the city councils and event organisers sat together to discuss the possible scenarios. One of the rumoured outcomes would be postponement of Tomorrowland until later in the year, when the whole situation with Coronavirus would calm down. But since there are hundreds of suppliers, freelancers, creative companies, artists and agencies involved for a successful execution of the festival, it is hard to say if everyone would be available for the new date.</p>
<p>Last but not least there is also the financial loss that needs to be considered. For the municipalities of Boom and Rumst the cancelation of Tomorrowland would mean approximately 2 million euros of loss. The mayors say that they are aware of possible outcomes and that they will start looking into different strategies, once they will know for sure what the fate of this year’s edition of the festival will be.</p>
<p>For now everything remains as it is, make sure to follow Tomorrowland on their social media and check their website where they will be posting updates regarding the possible cancelation of the event.

Tomorrowland Prvi Travnja to take place in 2021 in Croatia</p>
<p>By Phil Thüne 1.17k</p>
<p>With the recent cancellation of their 2nd festival, Tomorrowland Winter in Alpe d’Huez, France, the organizers is looking to expand their summer festivals further. It has come to our knowledge that Tomorrowland is currently in the early stages of planning another festival on a small island Lastovo in Croatia which is to be announced very soon.</p>
<p>In recent years, the surrounding countries of the Adriatic Sea have become more popular in the electronic music industry. In 2013, Ultra hosted their very first edition of Ultra Europe in Split, Croatia, and its surrounding Islands, Anjunadeep explorations is taking place in Dhermï, Albania and Zrce is hosting a large number of events throughout the summer as well.</p>
<p>It seems that Tomorrowland wants a piece of the Mediterranean cake as well and is planning to stage an additional festival to Belgium and winter supposedly to be named ‘Tomorrowland Prvi Travnja‘ on the island of Lastovo, very close to Split where Ultra is staging their yearly Ultra Europe celebrations. The first edition of ‘Tomorrowland Prvi Travnja’ is set to take place during the first week of April, from Thursday to Saturday and will have a capacity of 100.000 attendees.</p>
<p>The details surfaced through a new subdomain that they registered, prvitravnja.tomorrowland.com, which is currently only revealing some details through the source code of the webpage that can be found here. We can’t wait until the full announcement.</p>
<p>If the link doesn’t work, mark in your calendar, April 1st, 2021. See you there!

Tomorrowland presents livestream event: United Through Music</p>
<p>By Ellie Mullins 323</p>
<p>In these challenging times, events and artists are doing everything in their power to lift the spirits of their fans. With exclusive sets, live streams and watch parties it seems like the music industry is more united than ever right now. Festivals such as Beyond Wonderland have been hosting live events, and now iconic festival Tomorrowland is getting in on the action.</p>
<p>On Tuesday 31 March, from 15:00 CEST, Tomorrowland will be hosting an online stream titled Tomorrowland Presents: United Through Music. Roping in four massive artists (Lost Frequencies, Afrojack, Dimitri Vegas &amp; Like Mike and Vintage Culture), the stream will start with Lost Frequencies and end at 18:00 CEST with Vintage Culture, featuring a full day of exclusive sets bound to blow listeners away. Their goal is to give people hope and make them look towards a bright future, whilst also giving them high class entertainment the best way they know how to. With each artist on the stream lineup curating a unique set that you can only hear on the streams, Adam K – one of the fantastic hosts of One World Radio – will be interacting with the DJs and the People of Tomorrow that will tune in, setting this up to be one of the best virtual events of the year so far.</p>
<p>Speaking out about United Through Music, Dimitri Vegas stated that he is happy to “give people across the world a magical experience at home, interacting and supporting each other as one large global community”. This is certainly something not to be missed, and you can catch the stream on their Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, website and One World Radio tomorrow.</p>
<p>Check out the full timetable below, and get ready to witness a spectacle like no other!
