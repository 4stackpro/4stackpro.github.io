ROME – On the same day that she had a private meeting with Pope Francis, Rome Mayor Virginia Raggi on Facebook endorsed a campaign to help the poor during the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak launched by the Rome office of Catholic charitable organization Caritas Internationalis.</p>
<p>“With the coronavirus emergency Caritas Rome has found itself giving up an important sum on which it relied to help thousands of homeless, migrants and families in difficulty,” she said in her March 28 post, noting that the sum of money in question is amount collected from all the coins thrown daily into the city’s famed Trevi Fountain by tourists.</p>
<p>In 2005 the the City of Rome decided to donate the funds collected from the Trevi Fountain to Caritas given their charitable work with the city’s poor.</p>
<p>“With the city empty and without the many visitors we are used to, even that sum has failed,” Raggi said, noting that last year the coins collected amounted to a whopping total of 1,400,000 euros ($1,550,000.)</p>
<p>“This is one of the many collateral effects of the emergency,” Raggi said, urging donors to support the Caritas “I Want To, But I Can’t” fundraiser, which is raising money to allow Caritas to convert overnight shelters into a 24-hour service offering the poor and needy meals, while also running a food distribution service.</p>
<p>Polish Cardinal Konrad Krajewski, the Papal Almoner responsible for distributing charity on behalf of the pope, recently spoke of the great need the homeless find themselves in, since the soup kitchens and restaurants where they usually go for meals and handouts are all closed.</p>

<p>In her post, Raggi thanked Director of Caritas Rome Father Benoni Ambarus, “who, like so many in the city, continues to commit himself with dedication to those most in need. Together, as a community, we will do it.”</p>
<p>Pope Francis met with Raggi March 28 for a private meeting at the Vatican. Though no formal communique was issued about the encounter, it is likely the Caritas campaign was mentioned.</p>
<p>A day prior, Raggi had praised Pope Francis’s virtually unprecedented livestreamed prayer service March 27 for the end of the COVID-19 coronavirus, during which Pope Francis said the coronavirus outbreak is a time when “We have realized that we are on the same boat, all of us fragile and disoriented, but at the same time important and needed, all of us called to row together, each of us in need of comforting the other.”</p>
<p>RELATED: Amid ‘thick darkness’ of coronavirus, Pope says it’s time to choose what really matters</p>
<p>He also gave the traditional Urbi et Orbi blessing, “to the city and to the world,” which is typically only given at Christmas and Easter, and which offers those who receive it a plenary indulgence, meaning the full pardon of the temporal consequences of sin.</p>
<p>In a Tweet sent after the encounter, Raggi said: “The words of Pope Francis are a balm for all of us in this moment of suffering. Rome unites to his prayer. Let us row together in this storm because no one is saved alone.”</p>
<p>On Monday Pope Francis met also with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte for a private audience at the Vatican.</p>
<p>Both Francis and the Italian bishops have urged citizens to adhere to the Italian government’s tight restrictions during the coronavirus lockdown.</p>

<p>VATICAN CITY – The Vatican said on Saturday that tests carried out in the building where Pope Francis lives after one resident tested positive for coronavirus showed that the pontiff and his closest aides do not have the disease.</p>
<p>It was the first pronouncement about the 83-year-old pope and his coronavirus status since the current crisis began in Italy, where more than 10,000 people have died.</p>
<p>Tests were done on 170 people in the Vatican and six showed positive, including one of the several dozen permanent residents of the Santa Marta guesthouse on the Vatican grounds, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement.</p>
<p>“I can confirm that neither the Holy Father nor his closest aides are among these,” he said.</p>
<p>The person who tested positive works in the Secretariat of State and is in a Rome hospital.</p>
<p>Tests showed one other person who had been in contact with the priest also came up positive but that person did not live in the papal residence.</p>
<p>The modern residence, which has 130 rooms and suites and a staff of about 30 people, is home to dozens of priests who work in key Vatican departments.</p>
<p>Bruni said the entire residence, which is run like a hotel but has not been accepting temporary guests for the past few weeks, was sanitized.</p>
<p>Francis appears to be in generally good health but part of one of his lungs was removed following an illness when he was a young man.</p>
<p>One source who enters the residence regularly said precautions have been taken such as encouraging social distancing and making hand sanitizers available.</p>
<p>Since March 6, the Vatican has issued at least five notices or decrees that mirror steps taken in Italy, the hardest hit country in Europe, with more than 10,000 deaths as of Saturday.</p>
<p>They include recommendations to communicate by phone even with people in the same office, alternating shifts and encouraging as much work from home as possible.</p>
<p>Francis has canceled public appearances and is conducting his general audiences via television and the internet. But he still receives about five Vatican officials a day, according to his official calendar.

<h3 id="cardinal-close-to-pope-francis-tests-positive-for-coronavirus">Cardinal close to Pope Francis tests positive for coronavirus</h3>
<p><img src="https://localtvwiti.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/gettyimages-1142458825.jpg?quality=85&amp;strip=all" alt="img">
VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis’ vicar for Rome has tested positive for the coronavirus in the first case of a cardinal close to the pope known to be infected.</p>
<p>Cardinal Angelo De Donatis had been in touch with Francis in recent weeks — apparently not in person, however — over the cardinal’s initial decision to close all Rome churches in line with an Italian government shutdown decree.</p>
<p>De Donatis reversed himself after Francis intervened, and allowed diocesan churches to remain open for individuals to pray.</p>
<p>The pope is technically bishop of Rome, but he delegates the day-to-day running of the diocese to his vicar, De Donatis, 66. The Rome church said De Donatis was in good condition at Rome’s Gemelli hospital and was receiving antiviral treatment.</p>
<p>The Holy See has said six people have tested positive for the virus in the Vatican, none of them the pope or his closest advisers.
