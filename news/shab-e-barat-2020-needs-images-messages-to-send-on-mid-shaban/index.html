<p><img src="http://admin.dailyaddaa.com/upload/image-full/637218782890000000.jpg" alt="img">
Shab-e-Barat 2020: All You Need To Know About &ldquo;This Night Of Devotion&rdquo;</p>
<p>NEW DELHI: This year, Shab-e-Barat 2020 is expected to be on the night of Wednesday, April 8, 2020. However, the exact date is subject to sighting of the moon of Shaban, 1441.</p>
<p>Shab-e-Barat is an important night in the Islamic calendar and it is celebrated in the mid of Shaban. This is the reason why it is called Nisf Shaban. This glorious night starts at sunset on the 14th of Shaban and ends at dawn on the 15th of Shaban.</p>
<p>Different countries have different ways of celebrating this day and each have a different name for it. Nisf Shaban is known as Shab e Barat or Shabe Barat in South Asia, especially in Sub-continent, Lailatul Barat in Arabic, Nisfu Syaban in Indonesia and Malaysia and Berat Kandili in Turkey. Shab e Barat is a night which many Muslims revere as the night of forgiveness, praying the whole night asking Allah to bestow them with His blessings.</p>
<p>The traditions of Shab-e-Barat:</p>
<p>Muslims believe that on the night of Shab e-Barat, God writes the destinies of all men for the coming year by taking into account the deeds committed by them in the past.</p>
<p>Muslim devotees will offer special prayers, recite from the Holy Qur&rsquo;an and perform other religious rituals throughout the night of Shab e-Barat, hoping to receive divine blessings for the wellbeing of mankind.</p>
<p>On Shab-e-Barat night, most Muslims attempt to stay awake in prayer as much as possible. This is why the public holiday takes place on the day after the night of Shab-e-Barat.</p>

<p>For some Muslims, it is also part of Shab-e-Barat traditions to visit the graves of their loved ones and pray for the peace of their souls. In Bangladesh, many people will fast on the day following Shab e-Barat night and some people will give out food and sweets to their neighbours and the poor.</p>
<p>Conclusion of this day:</p>
<p>So, you may spend this night by doing good deeds such as asking Duas for yourself and for all the Muslims around the world, recitation of Al-Quran and any other act to get Allah’s attention and blessings as these deeds are Sunnah of Prophet according to the Hadiths mentioned above. But note one thing that any act of worship during this night is not obligatory.</p>

<p>New Delhi: The Delhi Police on Sunday appealed to the Muslim community in the national capital to not venture out of their houses on the forthcoming occasion of Shab-e-Barat in view of the coronavirus lockdown in the country.</p>
<p>The tweet shared by the Delhi Police urged the people of the Muslim community to support the department in the fight against COVID-19 and added that “Lockdown is in force even on the sacred night of Shab-e-Barat on April 8 and 9, 2020.” Shab-e-Barat, which in Islamic faith means the Night of Forgiveness or the Day of Atonement, is considered to be an occasion when the Almighty forgives sinners if they pray. Observed on the night between the 14 and 15th day of the eighth month of the Islamic calendar, the occasion is marked by Muslims congregating in mosques and visiting graves of their departed loved ones.</p>
<p>The roads around mosques and cemeteries see large crowds on the day with extra police deployment to ensure law and order. However, this year the festival has fallen when the nationwide lockdown is in place.</p>
<p>The police have largely been successful in keeping the people restricted to their houses to prevent the spread of coronavirus. No exceptions were made even for Ram Navami, an auspicious festival of the Hindu community which fell on April 2, with no rallies or congregations allowed on the occasion.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on March 24 imposed a 21-day nationwide lockdown to defeat the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
