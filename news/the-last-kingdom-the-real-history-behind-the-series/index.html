When is The Last Kingdom set and what it is about?</p>
<p>It is the story of the struggle between Saxons and Danes in 9th-century England, when England was not one nation but a series of independent kingdoms variously overrun or ravaged by Danes. The era of Lindisfarne and raiders from the sea is long past – by this point in history, the Vikings in Britain are settlers, lords and kings .</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>This tale plays out from the perspective of Uhtred of Bebbanburg, a man born a Saxon and raised a Dane, grappling with his persistently split loyalties between his oaths (of which he makes many), his conflicting cultural identities, and his quest for retribution.</p>
<p>What starts out as a tale of straightforward revenge – reclaiming his ancestral home in Northumbria from his usurping uncle and avenging the murder of his adoptive Viking father – rapidly extends into a history-adjacent Vikings versus Anglo-Saxons epic, as Uhtred finds himself in the Kingdom of Wessex, where Alfred the Great has dreams of expelling the northmen from all the realms of ‘England’ and creating a single nation, something that wouldn’t be achieved until the reign of his grandson .</p>
<p>The show is based on the Saxon Stories novels of Bernard Cornwell (now renamed as the The Last Kingdom series owing to the show’s success), of which there are currently 12 in print, with the concluding 13th instalment – War Lord – due to be published in October 2020.</p>

<p>What is the plot of The Last Kingdom season four?</p>
<p>Season four of The Last Kingdom is widely expected to cover books seven and eight of Bernard Cornwell’s saga, The Pagan Lord and The Empty Throne. Alfred the Great is dead, as is his ever-conniving nephew Aethelwold; Alfred’s son Edward the Elder sits on the throne of Wessex; his daughter Aethelflaed is wed to the ruler of Mercia; and the Danes, led by Haesten and Cnut ( not Cnut the Great – he won’t be born for another hundred years ), sense opportunity. Uhtred, meanwhile, realises now might be the time to challenge his uncle Aelfric for his birthright, the lordship of Bebbanburg in Northumbria.</p>
<p>Once season four is complete, there are still three more books in Cornwell’s series to adapt – if the The Last Kingdom is renewed for future seasons.</p>
<p>THE LAST KINGDOM SEASON 4 REVIEWS (LIST UPDATED DAILY):</p>
<p>What happened in The Last Kingdom season one? And what’s the real history?</p>
<p>The Last Kingdom begins in 866, the year that Vikings first seized control of York . Uhtred is a child and heir to Bebbanburg (Bamburgh) in Northumbria. When the Vikings arrive, his father, Lord Uhtred, rides out to give battle and is predictably slain; the boy Uhtred is captured.</p>
<p>Uhtred’s uncle Aelfric hopes to ransom the boy back and quietly murder him so that he can claim the lordship of Bebbanburg for himself unimpeded, but that plan is scuppered when Danish jarl Ragnar the Fearless takes a liking to the lad and ultimately takes him back to Denmark along with a Saxon girl, Brida.</p>
<p>Fast forward several years: Uhtred is now a young man, fully immersed in Norse culture and religion. His apparent happiness comes crashing down when Ragnar the Fearless is murdered, burned alive in his hall by shipmaster Kjartan and his son Sven the One-Eyed, in retribution for Ragnar taking Sven’s eye many years before. Kjartan spreads rumours that Saxon-born Uhtred is the miscreant behind the deed, forcing Uhtred to flee back across the North Sea to the lands he left as a boy.</p>
<p>It’s on returning to Northumbria that Uhtred meets Guthrum and Ubba, one of the fabled sons of legendary Viking hero Ragnar Lothbrok , whom he watches murder King Edmund of the East Angles. The real Edmund “was tied to a tree, beaten and then murdered with a volley of arrows,” writes ecclesiastical historian Emma J Wells – which is pretty much what happens here, except it plays out in a church.</p>
<p>Guthrum and Ubba don’t believe his innocence, so Uhtred flees to Winchester, capital of Wessex, the titular ‘last kingdom’ to fall prey to the Danes. Aethelred I rules, but by the middle of the season he has been mortally wounded, and on his deathbed passes the crown to his brother, Alfred – overlooking Aethelwold, his own son, portrayed as a drunkard who believes the crown should have been his by default.</p>
<p>“[Alfred] can never have expected to be king, as the youngest of five brothers, but all of them died young,” writes Michael Wood. “He was 21, pious and brave, but in poor health, with a crippling hereditary illness, perhaps Crohn’s Disease.”</p>
<p>Young Ragnar, son of Ragnar the Fearless, returns from Ireland – one of the many shores aside from England that the Vikings sailed to – to confirm for himself that Uhtred didn’t kill their father. When he leaves to seek revenge on Kjartan, Brida departs with him.</p>
<p>Uhtred proves instrumental at the battle of Cynwit in Devon in 878 – one of the four most important ‘lost battles’ of the Viking age, writes Thomas Williams, who describes it as “one of the great military reversals of the early Middle Ages”, prior to which he kills Ubba in single combat. Uhtred’s part in the battle is glossed over (a common theme in The Last Kingdom) and victory is ascribed to Odda the Elder, ealdorman of Devon, as it is in real history.</p>
<p>Uhtred and Alfred clash frequently through the rest of the series over loyalty and religion, but where Alfred is forced to admit Uhtred’s usefulness is when the would-be Lord of Bebbanburg helps Alfred escape into the Somerset Marshes – where he famously burns the cakes – in the wake of the Danish invasion of Wessex in 878, and then at the battle of Edington in which the Saxons inflict a crushing defeat on the Northmen.</p>
<p>Listen to renowned historical novelist Bernard Cornwell talk about his books that inspired The Last Kingdom, and about his writing career more broadly:</p>
<p>What happens in The Last Kingdom season two?</p>
<p>Uhtred heads north – not to Bebbanburg, but to rescue Guthred, a Christian Dane prophesised to become the king of Cumberland. The mission is a success, but once king Guthred is convinced to betray Uhtred and sells him into slavery. Alfred sends Young Ragnar (son of Ragnar the Fearless and Uhtred’s adoptive brother, taken hostage by Wessex at the end of season one) to rescue him. Reunited, Ragnar and Uhtred besiege Kjartan and Sven the One-Eyed in Durham, finally avenging Ragnar the Fearless.</p>
<p>This season also develops the character of Aethelflaed – not yet the ‘Lady of the Mercians’, but a young woman and, as a daughter of a king, one ready to be married off in alliance – “As a wife, Æthelflæd’s story is all too familiar in terms of royal dynastic marriages,” writes Dr Janina Ramirez. She is wed, in history and on The Last Kingdom, to Aethelred of Mercia. “Theirs was an entirely political union, designed to strengthen the two kingdoms against Danish and Norwegian incursions in the north,” says Ramirez.</p>
<p>On the show, the Mercian Aethelred reveals himself to be a poor husband, possessive and abusive. He takes Aethelflaed to war against Danish brothers Siegfried and Erik (both fictional antagonists) and their underling Haesten (who did exist), where she is captured and held for ransom, setting up the season’s climatic battle at Benfleet in 893 and Odda the Elder’s suicide in lieu of certain execution for treason.</p>
<p>What happened in The Last Kingdom season three?</p>
<p>Season three opens by introducing two new antagonists, the warrior Bloodhair and his seer, Skade – who has a vision of Bloodhair killing Alfred in battle. But Alfred really is dying, through ill health; Edward the Aetheling is a young man not yet ready to rule; Aetholwold is sowing discord as he sees a route to finally becoming king.</p>
<p>Relations between Uhtred and Alfred reach crisis point when Uhtred accidentally kills a priest after Aethelwold’s meddling; in response, Alfred tries to make Uhtred swear an oath to serve Edward. Uhtred, realising that swearing an oath to Edward would mean a life of servitude, flatly refuses, then takes Alfred hostage to effect his escape.</p>
<p>Season three places Aethelwold centre stage playing politics. He also leaves Wessex, stopping first at Mercia, where he sows the seeds of betrayal for Aethelflaed, and the at Bloodhair’s camp, where he argues that the Danes should form a single ‘great army’ to crush Wessex.</p>
<p>“West Saxon chroniclers were scathing about Æthelwold’s alliance with Vikings, but as a tactic of war it wasn’t unusual,” writes early medieval historian Professor Ryan Lavelle, who is also The Last Kingdom’s historical consultant. “There is good reason to suspect that Alfred too allied himself with Viking mercenaries when circumstances required.”</p>
<p>Uhtred makes his way north to Durham and to his brother Ragnar the Younger, where he briefly plots with Bloodhair, Haesten and Ragnar’s cousin Cnut to form a great army to invade the Saxon kingdoms, but abandons them to rescue Aethelflaed – now hiding in a nunnery, because Aethelred is plotting to have her killed.</p>
<p>Later, Aethelwold murders Ragnar in his bed – preventing him from reaching his sword and denying him entry to Valhalla. Haesten is revealed to be a spy for Alfred and alerts the king to the Danish threat.</p>
<p>Alfred finally succumbs to his illness – but not before he reconciles with Uhtred and sees Edward married. Uhtred publicly affirms his support for Edward as the presumptive king, and they ride to meet Aethelwold and the Danes near Bedford – defeating them with the help of Mercia and Kent. At the battle’s climax, Uhtred catches up with Aethelwold (having learned that he was the one responsible for Young Ragnar’s death) and stabs him through the heart.</p>
<p>This final act of Aethelwold’s machinations plays out markedly different to real events. Though in the show it is dealt with in the immediate aftermath of Alfred’s death in 899, the actual battle took place at unidentified location suspected to be Holme in East Anglia in 902, after a three-year insurrection in which Aethelwold had moderate success. Even the circumstances of the battle are reversed, with the Danes ambushing Edward’s army – they won the battle, but Aethelwold died in the fighting, making it somewhat pyrrhic.</p>
<p>“Æthelwold’s insurrection is little known today, a mere footnote in Anglo-Saxon history,” says Lavelle. “It also hints that, had Æthelwold enjoyed a little more fortune in the fallout from Alfred’s death, and had one obscure battle in 902 had an alternative outcome, the future of England could have been very different indeed.”</p>
<p>How will The Last Kingdom end?</p>
<p>If the show continues and follows the thread of Bernard Cornwell’s novels, then we might already know the answer. Cornwell told HistoryExtra in 2018 that The Last Kingdom series is going to end with a real historical event: the battle of Brunanburh in 937 . The battle marked the beginning of England, so obviously had to be included in the series.</p>
<p>The Last Kingdom season four airs on Netflix from Sunday 26 April.</p>

One of the best things about The Last Kingdom is its fast-paced story, which is constantly shaking up the status quo with major deaths and shocking developments.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>However, that can also make it easy to lose track of what’s been going on, especially given the long wait between seasons being released.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we’ve compressed the first three seasons of The Last Kingdom into one handy refresher, meaning you can be totally caught up before binge watching the new episodes on Netflix.</p>

<p>The Last Kingdom season 1</p>
<p>We are introduced to Uhtred as a boy and the heir of Bebbanburg, an area of land held by his father Lord Uhtred (Matthew Macfadyen). When Vikings attack, Lord Uhtred leads his men to face them and his son secretly follows in a naive attempt to help. The boy witnesses his father’s brutal death on the battlefield and is kidnapped by the Danes along with a young Saxon girl named Brida.</p>
<p>Though intended as slaves, the Dane leader Earl Ragnar (Peter Gantzler) becomes fond of them both – especially after Uhtred saves his daughter from being assaulted in the woods by Sven, who loses an eye as punishment.</p>
<p>Young Uhtred’s power hungry uncle Aelfric (Joseph Millson) pledges allegiance to the Danes and meets with Ragnar to discuss a ransom, but intends to kill the boy at the earliest opportunity to secure his hold on Bebbanburg. Fortunately, Ragnar decides to buy Uhtred for himself and the boy is raised as a Viking, adopting the Norse religion and customs.</p>
<p>The story picks up many years later, with Uhtred (Alexander Dreymon) and Brida (Emily Cox) as adults still living happily with the Danes. All is well, until a warrior named Kjartan (Alexandre Willaume) murders Uhtred’s adoptive family as revenge for partially blinding his son, Sven, many years prior.</p>
<p>Kjartan spreads false word that Uhtred committed the murders, forcing him to flee with Brida to the Saxon kingdom of Wessex, ruled by the devoutly Christian King Alfred (David Dawson). Wessex has its own problems, facing attacks from the Danes and internal scheming from nobleman Aethelwold (Harry McEntire) who believes himself to be the rightful king.</p>
<p>Brida dislikes the Saxons and leaves, joining up with Earl Ragnar’s son, Ragnar The Younger (who sees through the lies spread by Kjartan).</p>
<p>Though initially distrustful of Uhtred, Alfred rewards him with land and a wife after he leads Wessex in several military victories. But when he furiously interrupts Alfred’s prayers to complain about a nobleman, Uhtred incurs a humiliating punishment that sours their relationship, while his pious wife also begins to despise his “heathen” ways.</p>
<p>Seeking liberation from Alfred, Uhtred goes plundering for treasure to clear his marriage debt with the church, discovering Pagan Queen Iseult who he quickly falls for. Upon his return to Wessex, Alfred orders him to be executed but Danes attack before this is possible, forcing everyone to flee (including the king himself).</p>
<p>Alfred and his wife, Aelswith (Eliza Butterworth), hide in the marshland with their sick newborn son and their most trusted advisers. Uhtred and Iseult join them and perform a Pagan ritual that cures the baby’s illness, effectively winning back the king’s trust in the process.</p>
<p>Alfred sends messengers across the land to tell of an impending battle for Wessex, which will only be winnable if every Saxon army joins forces against the Danes. They are victorious but it comes at a heavy price: Iseult is beheaded by a cruel viking warrior, leaving Uhtred heartbroken. After fighting for the Danes, Brida and Young Ragnar are imprisoned in Wessex as Alfred’s hostages, while Uhtred heads north a free man.</p>
<p>The Last Kingdom season 2</p>
<p>Abbot Eadred (David Schofield) experiences a holy vision that tells him Guthred, the rightful king of Cumbraland, is currently enslaved by Kjartan and Sven. King Alfred of Wessex agrees to help free him, partly to extend his own influence further north, sending Father Beocca (Ian Hart) to negotiate a ransom.</p>
<p>Uhtred encounters the priest on his journey and agrees to help free Guthred (Thure Lindhardt), as they would have a common enemy in Kjartan. Rather than pay a ransom, a daring rescue is staged and Guthred does indeed become king in the north, with Uhtred as his close adviser and a potential match for his sister, Gisela (Peri Baumeister).</p>
<p>However, Eadred feels that Uhtred’s popularity is a threat to Guthred’s rule, so he convinces the new king to make a pact with Aelfric of Bebbanburg, who will offer men in return for his nephew’s head. But Guthred does not wish to kill Uhtred, so instead he sells him into brutal slavery on the open seas.</p>
<p>Word reaches King Alfred of this terrible injustice and he sends his Dane hostage, Ragnar the Younger, to track Uhtred down. After months of abuse, the slave ship docks and Ragnar discovers a frail Uhtred who is close to death. Once freed, they spend days camping while Uhtred slowly regains his health, before heading to a nearby nunnery where Gisela had exiled herself to avoid being forced into marriage by her brother.</p>
<p>But by the time they they find her, Abbot Eadred is already there and claims to have married Gisela to Uhtred’s treacherous uncle Aelfric (who isn’t present). In a burst of rage, Uhtred kills the spiteful Eadred before an audience of priests and nuns, reuniting with Gisela who joins him on his journey back to Wessex.</p>
<p>Alfred finds out about the murder of Eadred and gives Uhtred an ultimatum: swear an oath of service or Ragnar will be held responsible and put to death. Uhtred swears loyalty to Wessex in exchange for Ragnar and Brida’s freedom, who are frustrated he won’t join the Danes with them, but unaware of the sacrifice he has made for their lives.</p>
<p>King Alfred of Wessex arranges for his daughter, Princess Aethelflaed, to marry Lord Aethelred of Mercia, in a bid to permanently ally the two kingdoms – but the relationship is abusive, something she keeps secret to maintain political and military union.</p>
<p>Alfred then sends Uhtred on a mission to kill viking brothers Erik and Sigefrid as they are a threat to Cumbraland, but he shows mercy and instead banishes them back to Denmark after raiding their camp. In doing so, weak King Guthred becomes indebted to Uhtred and lends him soldiers to attack Dunholm, the stronghold maintained by the men who killed his adoptive family: Kjartan and Sven.</p>
<p>Both are killed in a successful siege which also reveals that Thyra, Uhtred’s adoptive sister who was thought dead, had in fact been held prisoner all these years and subject to horrific abuse. Ragnar and Brida, who had helped Uhtred to liberate Dunholm, remain there with their army of Danes.</p>
<p>Uhtred returns to Wessex with traumatised Thyra, who he leaves in the trustworthy hands of Father Beocca, a priest he has known and liked since childhood. Uhtred and Gisela get married, living in relative peace for three years, in which time they are given the Wessex estate of Cookham and have two children together.</p>
<p>Father Beocca rehabilitates Thyra and the two of them fall in love, also deciding to marry (with Uhtred’s blessing, of course).</p>
<p>The peace is interrupted when Erik and Sigefrid return with a great army and capture London, prompting Alfred to send men led by Aethelred of Mercia – who insists on taking his wife with him. They advance to London but find the city is completely deserted, initially believing the Danes to have fled, when actually they have circled back to the Saxon camp and kidnapped Princess Aethelflaed.</p>
<p>It is revealed that Erik and Sigefrid purposefully abandoned London in favour of a much larger prize: a huge ransom for King Alfred’s daughter that would rob Wessex of its wealth and allow the Danes to fund a huge army against the Saxons. Alfred thinks with his heart rather than his head and agrees to pay the outrageous sum, frustrating loyal nobleman Odda (Simon Kunz) who sees the devastation this would cause in the long term. Odda goes against Alfred’s wishes, arranging an army to fight the vikings that begins marching north towards Erik and Sigefrid.</p>
<p>Unbeknown to everyone, Aethelflaed and Erik have fallen in love and plan to escape together, calling on Uhtred to help them do it. He reluctantly agrees, working with Erik to break Aethelflaed out of prison, but when Sigefried discovers them he kills his brother and sends men after the princess.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Odda’s army arrives to fight off the Danes, with Aethelflaed killing Sigefried herself. The battle is a huge success for the Saxons, but Odda faces execution regardless as he went against the king, so instead he commits suicide in prison.</p>
<p>The Last Kingdom season 3</p>
<p>A viking warrior who goes by the name Bloodhair (Ola Rapace) is preparing to march against Alfred, guided by a sadistic and seductive seer called Skade (Thea Sofie Loch Næss) who claims to have seen a vision of his victory on the battlefield.</p>
<p>In Wessex, Alfred’s health has begun to deteriorate so he is preparing his teenage son Edward to take on the throne – much to the disgust of Aethelwold who still has his eyes on the crown. Uhtred and Gisela are expecting their third child, but he is forced to leave her late in the pregnancy to fight Bloodhair’s men, who are raiding small villages around Wessex. While on this mission, Uhtred discovers Skade torturing some priests in a nearby church and takes her hostage, for which she places a curse on him.</p>
<p>Bloodhair comes to retrieve her and there is a battle from which the viking flees, losing the respect and adoration of Skade, who starts to align herself with Uhtred. They return to Wessex and it is revealed that Gisela has died in childbirth, which Uhtred believes is a sign of Skade’s curse manifesting itself – but she refuses to lift it unless he joins forces with her.</p>
<p>Gisela has been given a Christian burial despite the fact she never followed that religion, so Uhtred digs up her body and buries it in the viking way so she may be at peace according to their beliefs.</p>
<p>Realising that King Alfred’s days are numbered, Aethelwold is sowing disunity across Wessex in the hopes that he will be able to take the throne, bribing a priest into goading Uhtred in front of the king.</p>
<p>King Alfred and Aelswith have seen what Uhtred did at the graveyard and consider it desecration. They call on him to answer for his actions, at which point the paid-off priest appears and says horrible things about the late Gisela. Uhtred gives the him a slap but unintentionally kills him due to the priest being physically frail and has to fight his way home after Alfred orders him to be arrested.</p>
<p>Eventually, he returns to the king willingly, who tells Uhtred that he must pledge an oath to Prince Edward in order to be pardoned for the priest’s death. Such an oath would mean a lifetime of service to Wessex which Uhtred is not prepared to devote himself to, instead holding a knife to the king’s throat in a daring escape attempt. Uhtred and his most loyal men manage to flee Wessex with Skade in tow, but he suffers a wound on his arm where one of Alfred’s soldiers cut him with a spear.</p>
<p>Notably, Aethelwold has achieved his goal of turning Alfred’s most feared warrior against him and continues scheming, suggesting to Aethelred of Mercia that he should kill Princess Aethelflaed. He then heads north to Bloodhair, who has allied with Sigefrid’s former ally Haesten (Jeppe Beck Laursen), to suggest gathering a grand Dane army in Dunholm.</p>
<p>Uhtred grows weak due to his injury and begins hallucinating, so he also heads for Dunholm where he has friends in his adoptive brother Ragnar and childhood friend Brida. They imprison Skade and nurse Uhtred back to health, before telling him of the plan to unite the Dane armies and wage war against King Alfred. Uhtred’s loyal men don’t wish to be involved in such a plan as they have loved ones in Wessex who would be put in danger, while Ragnar’s cousin Cnut (Magnus Bruun) dislikes Uhtred and labels him a “Dane slayer”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Wessex, King Alfred is having trouble turning his son into a suitable heir, having discovered that he has secretly had children with a peasant woman and married her.</p>
<p>Aethelflaed finds out that her husband plans to have her killed and flees to a nunnery before he has the chance, where she sends word to Uhtred that she is (once again) in need of his help. Uhtred has an affection for Aethelflaed but in choosing to help her, he turns his back on Ragnar and Brida when they need him the most, destroying his relationship with the Danes once and for all. He leaves with his men and Skade, heading for the nunnery where Aethelflaed has taken refuge.</p>
<p>Haesten is revealed to be an informant for Alfred who tells the king of Aethelwold’s betrayal, but secretly harbours a grudge against Princess Aethelflaed for killing Sigefrid. He tracks her down to the nunnery where Uhtred and his men are hiding her inside. After a bloody stand-off, an agreement is reached: Uhtred gives Skade to Haesten in exchange for Aethelflaed’s safety in the short-term.</p>
<p>Over at the Dane camp, Cnut tells Aethelwold that Ragnar despises him and plans to kill him soon, so the Saxon creeps into his tent late at night and stabs him to death while he sleeps. According to the viking beliefs, this means that Ragnar will not go to Valhalla (heaven) as he did not die in battle, which is a devastating realisation for Brida.</p>
<p>Brida tracks down Uhtred to inform him of his brother’s death and tells him it wouldn’t have happened had he not abandoned them for the Saxons. He believes that Ragnar’s death is another consequence of Skade’s curse and decides he must retrieve her from Haesten in order to break it himself.</p>
<p>Although Uhtred is an outlaw in Wessex for threatening the king, he is granted sanctuary in Mercia from Princess Aethelflaed, where he is able to speak to Alfred and Edward. Uhtred attempts to persuade the king to send his men on a siege of Beamfleot, the place where Haesten is keeping Skade, by highlighting the tactical advantage this would give the Saxons. The king flatly refuses.</p>
<p>However, Edward is more open to Uhtred’s proposals. He has been taking his position in the monarchy more seriously after the king stripped him of his “illegitimate” wife and children, accepting that he has a duty that cannot be passed up. He arranges for Wessex soldiers to meet Uhtred at Beamfleot and the battle is a victory for the Saxons, but not for Uhtred; although Haesten’s men are defeated, the man himself escapes with Skade and heads to Ragnar, Bloodhair and Cnut’s combined Dane forces in the north.</p>
<p>Although Alfred is initially angry at his son for going behind his back, he soon realises that this is the kind of initiative that will be needed if he is to succeed as king.</p>
<p>Uhtred leaves his men in Mercia and goes with Brida to find a way for Ragnar’s soul to cross from purgatory to heaven. They talk to a seer who informs them that they must kill the person who killed Ragnar, using a blade coated in his blood or someone of his bloodline. In a similarly grim ritual, Brida tells Uhtred that in order to lift Skade’s curse, he must kill her in a way that requires no loss of blood.</p>
<p>The Danes have grown tired of Aethelwold and demand that he go back to Wessex to ready men for the fight against Alfred, despite knowing he could very well be put to death for treason upon arrival. Sure enough, he is brought before the king, but Alfred feels partly responsible for Aethelwold’s betrayal and chooses to remove one of his eyes rather than execute him. It’s nasty.</p>
<p>The Danish camp continues to be weakened from within, as Haesten kills Bloodhair in a battle deciding who gets to be with Skade. This is a very pointless death in the grand scheme of things because Uhtred manages to take Skade back shortly after, thanks to a covert operation that cleverly utilised a select few of his most trusted men.</p>
<p>They go to rest in Cookham, where Uhtred’s men are concerned that he has fallen for Skade, a seductress known for using men for personal gain before killing them. That initially appears to be the case, as the two go off for a secluded bath in a nearby river. Lulling her into a false sense of security with his affection, Uhtred then drowns Skade in the river and in doing so shatters the curse she put on him.</p>
<p>Uhtred sneaks into Wessex with his men to ask his adoptive sister Thyra for some of her blood, so that he may use it when he finds Ragnar’s murderer – thus, sending their brother’s soul to Valhalla. She accepts and he stores the blood in a pouch that he carries with him. Father Beocca finds out that Uhtred is in Wessex and smuggles him into the palace for a meeting with Alfred, who is in very poor health and has little time left.</p>
<p>They have a moving conversation in private where they can finally open up to each other, acknowledging their failings but also the mutual respect they have. Alfred’s last action as king is writing a letter pardoning Uhtred for his crimes and making him a free man. He passes away from his illness that same night, putting Wessex in an extremely vulnerable position.</p>
<p>Aelswith attempts to smoothly transition the crown to Edward, but Aethelwold protests and attempts to turn the people against him. He is ultimately unsuccessful, but seemingly persuades a Saxon nobleman to pledge his army to the Danes, something he proudly reports to Haesten and Cnut.</p>
<p>Another consequence of Alfred’s death has been a rise in xenophobia against the minority of Danes who have settled in Wessex. Thyra is one of them and she is followed home by a man while everyone is at Alfred’s funeral, who breaks in and sets fire to the place while she is hiding under the floor. She manages to kill her attacker but is not able to escape the flames, tragically perishing in the blaze.</p>
<p>The Danes get word of Alfred’s death and begin marching towards Wessex, but not before Brida finds out it was Aethelwold who killed Ragnar, sending a messenger to inform Uhtred. King Edward gathers his army to face the viking warriors and there is a great battle in a nearby forest that silences the critics to his reign (at least in the short term). The nobleman that Aethelwold believed to have turned to the Danes arrives late to the battle and fights for the Saxons instead, prompting him to flee – but Uhtred follows.</p>
<p>Away from the battle, a terrified Aethelwold admits to Uhtred that he killed Ragnar, but promises he will travel far away and never return in exchange for his life. Uhtred stabs him through the pouch carrying his sister’s blood, freeing Ragnar’s soul to pass on into Valhalla, which is symbolised by rays of sunlight shining through the trees. Brida witnesses this and embraces Uhtred, before wandering back to the Danes where her allegiances still lie…</p>

<h3 id="how-is-the-last-kingdom-different-to-the-books-the-biggest-changes-from-page-to-screen">How is The Last Kingdom different to the books? The biggest changes from page to screen</h3>

Uhtred of Bebbanburg is finally back on screens as The Last Kingdom returns for season four on Netflix.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The action-packed drama is based on a series of novels by historical fiction writer Bernard Cornwell, first published as The Saxon Stories back in 2004.</p>
<p>Like many adaptations, The Last Kingdom varies significantly from the source material that inspired it, altering Uhtred’s path to revenge and the reclamation of his rightful land.</p>
<p>Here are the biggest differences between the books and the Netflix series…</p>

<p>The Last Kingdom season 1 changes from books</p>
<p>Season one of The Last Kingdom stands out as the most faithful adaptation of Cornwell’s Saxon Stories, translating his first two books to the small screen without making any major changes to the plot – but one particular difference stands out as notable.</p>
<p>After raiding Briton territory and violating the peace, Uhtred is sentenced to fight to the death by King Alfred. In the television series, he goes up against none other than Leofric, one of Alfred’s top soldiers and a man Uhtred had befriended. It’s a surprising moment in the season but doesn’t quite add up in terms of character motivation, which is probably because it never happened in the books.</p>
<p>Instead, it is Steapa, another of the king’s loyal swordsman, who agrees to fight Uhtred to the death. It’s not difficult to see why this was changed in the series, as Steapa doesn’t get a huge amount of screen time in season one, so putting Uhtred up against a more familiar face like Leofric naturally raises the dramatic stakes.</p>
<p>The Last Kingdom season 2 changes from books</p>
<p>In season two, The Last Kingdom becomes a bit more relaxed about straying away from events that occur in Cornwell’s novels, drawing inspiration from his third and fourth entries, titled The Lords of the North and Sword Song respectively.</p>
<p>For one thing, the television show completely cuts out the antagonistic Ivar Ivarsson, a Dane who has gained control of Eoferwic at the start of The Lords of the North. In a simplifying measure, the Netflix series replaces him with viking brothers Sigefrid and Erik who don’t appear until the fourth book. Ivar isn’t a very significant character so this change doesn’t have major consequences in the long-term. Arguably, it strengthens season two by allowing more screen time for Sigefrid and Erik, who are central to the story in the latter half.</p>
<p>Their relevance comes into focus when they capture London, prompting Alfred to send men to liberate the city. But the events that follow play out very differently in the series than they do in the books. Cornwell’s novel sees Uhtred lead a successful attack on London, winning back the city and placing it in Aethelred’s power.</p>
<p>In stark contrast, the battle plays out disastrously for the Saxons in The Last Kingdom. The show sees Aethelred put in charge of Alfred’s men, leading them to London only to find the city deserted. Initially believing the vikings to have fled, they soon realise that they have been tricked; Erik and Sigefrid’s men have abandoned the city to raid Aethelred’s unguarded camp and kidnap his wife, princess Aethelflaed.</p>
<p>In the book, Aethelflaed still gets kidnapped but at a later skirmish, so this change was likely made to save time and jump forward to the doomed romance that blossoms between herself and Erik.</p>
<p>In the Netflix series, Aethelflaed kills Sigefrid during the final battle of season two. However, in the books it is former monk Osferth who does this, which is hard to imagine given his timid demeanour in the television show.</p>
<p>One of the most memorable deaths in season two of The Last Kingdom is Abbott Eadred, a spiteful priest who Uhtred kills when he attempts to stop him from marrying Gisela. In the book, Eadred has a smaller role, appearing at the beginning to report his vision of King Guthred, but having less to do with later plot developments. Instead, Uhtred kills a monk named Brother Jænberht, who fulfils the villainous Eadred role. Again, this change was likely made to streamline the story and give the series less characters to juggle.</p>
<p>The Last Kingdom season 3 changes from books</p>
<p>The third season saw The Last Kingdom move entirely from the BBC to a Netflix Original production, just in time for two particularly brutal characters to make their debut.</p>
<p>In the fifth novel, Bloodhair and Skade are introduced as lovers but soon separated when the latter is taken hostage by Uhtred. In both the book and the TV show, there is a confrontation outside a fort where Bloodhair attempts to get her back by threatening Saxon prisoners.</p>
<p>In the Netflix series, this attempt is completely unsuccessful and Skade remains imprisoned, but in the books she is promptly freed and reunited with Bloodhair – only to be taken captive again later on. This alteration was likely another time-saving measure, as Skade ultimately ends up back with Uhtred anyway, although their relationship is markedly different in the book.</p>
<p>While Uhtred is reluctant to become intimately involved with Skade in The Last Kingdom, largely due to the fact he is mourning his late wife, they do become lovers in the book. During their relationship, they sail to Frisia where they plunder and kill Skade’s husband, but grow distant afterwards due to disagreements over his underwhelming treasure.</p>
<p>Upon their return to England, Skade encounters Haesten and the two of them fall in love. This is another area where the Netflix series differs, depicting Skade as completely disinterested in Haesten and his advances.</p>
<p>Skade meets a nasty end in The Last Kingdom, as Uhtred drowns her in a river to break the curse she has put on him. In the book, it is actually Bloodhair himself who kills Skade, angry that she abandoned him for other warriors. He then asks Uhtred to kill him, having been seriously injured earlier in the story with no hope of recovery.</p>
<p>Outside of Uhtred and Skade’s toxic dynamic, there are some other differences to be found. Sadly, Gisela dies in childbirth just as she does in the series, but in the book her baby also passes away whereas in the series he is a healthy son to Uhtred.</p>
<p>Lord Aethelred wants a divorce from Aethelflaed in both the books and the series, giving his right-hand man Aldhelm the command to sleep with her so that he can brand her an adulterer. In the book, Aldhelm attempts to do so unsuccessfully, resulting in his death by Uhtred’s hand. In The Last Kingdom, he cannot go through with the plan as he develops genuine affection for Aethelflaed, so Aethelred stabs him for his disobedience.</p>
