<p>2020 is the year of the Rat, the animal that symbolizes wealth and good beginnings. The celebrations for the Chinese New Year (Chun Jie) began on January 25 and entail an array of propitious traditions. Houses are adorned with red decorations and lanterns. New Year’s Eve dinner brings the family together and auspicious food, such as fish and dumplings, is served. Loud and bright fireworks are lit to banish the evil spirits and money in red envelopes are given to children to wish them good health and luck for the new year ahead.</p>
<p>This year, the Palace Museum of the Forbidden City in Beijing presents Celebrating the Spring Festival in the Forbidden City. The exhibition presents artifacts such as the imperial calligraphies of the auspicious character fu (福), spirit tablets (shenzhu) to pray to the ancestors, displays of the imperial feast as described in the imperial culinary archives, and the objects needed for the Opening Brush Ceremony during which the Emperor wrote messages to invoke blessings for the new year. The splendidly made Heavenly and Longevity lanterns used to decorate the doors and porticos of the Forbidden City are also on display. Although the original lanterns stopped being used in 1822 because of the austerity imposed by Emperor Daoguang (r. 1820-1850) and were consequently lost, the ones on display are historically accurate copies.

<h3 id="angelina-jolie-demonstrates-the-power-of-a-pink-lip-in-paris">&ldquo;Angelina Jolie Demonstrates the Power of a Pink Lip in Paris&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5d24b913bb70390009d8f3b0/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-angelina.jpg" alt="img">
Present tense pink is neither gentle or demure—rather, according to makeup artist Lucia Pica, “It’s got a bit of an attitude to it [&hellip;] It’s like a little rebellion.&rdquo; And the ideal icon to illustrate this shift toward subversion? Angelina Jolie, naturally. The multi-hyphenate stepped out in Paris today with her brunette hair center-parted, blown straight save for a few soft, organic bends, her pout adorned in a soft wash of peachy-pink.</p>
<p>Coupled with a set of exaggerated sunnies, gilded accents playing off of her gold hoops, Jolie&rsquo;s pink lip acted as a conduit for her unique brand of beauty: sophisticated and elegant, but with a well-earned edge, a feel exuded by both her well-kept, luminous skin and curated collection of tattoos. Though rubicund palettes remain a beacon of this particular summer, it seems that thoughtful swipes of pink have the potential to make an equally pretty—and dynamic—aesthetic statement.

<p><img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/01/15/17/Blackadder.jpg" alt="img">
Only two weeks after Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, announced that he&rsquo;d discovered books (which, he told his thunderstruck acolytes, &ldquo;allow you to fully explore a topic&hellip; in a deeper way than most media today&rdquo; – you don&rsquo;t say), and a new campaign started in the US for &ldquo;slow reading&rdquo;, in which adherents visit a café together, silence their mobile phones and read together quietly for a whole hour, now academics at Wayne State University in Michigan have discovered that lots of &ldquo;Dead Words&rdquo; exist. Words that define things still relevant to modern life, sound pretty good but have fallen out of usage.</p>
<p>They have recommended that students investigate their &ldquo;glorious variety&rdquo; – and have offered a Top 10 of favourite &ldquo;lost words&rdquo; to be resurrected in 2015: caterwaul, concinnity, knavery, mélange, rapscallion, opsimath, obambulate, philistine, flapdoodle and subtopia.</p>
<p>One&rsquo;s first response is to say, whaddya mean &ldquo;dead&rdquo;? When did &ldquo;mélange&rdquo; die out? (It turns up all the time in Masterchef, though perhaps not the US version, being jerst a leedle too Frornch. And &ldquo;philistine&rdquo;? Don&rsquo;t we still throw that at anyone who fails to share our taste in art-house movies or Monteverdi?</p>
<p>Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines</p>
<p>One&rsquo;s second response is to say, well if you like them apples, how about these? The dictionary is full of characterful words that just need some regular airing to bring them back into popular discourse. One cannot contemplate the forthcoming election debates without thinking of &ldquo;bloviate&rdquo;, a word coined by Warren G Harding, the US president, to mean &ldquo;to speak for as long as the occasion warrants while saying precisely nothing&rdquo;. Any appearance by Russell Brand these days prompts one to accuse him of &ldquo;sesquipedalian&rdquo; talk – verbiage that&rsquo;s many-syllabled and comes from Horace&rsquo;s sesquipedalis, meaning a word &ldquo;one-and-a-half feet long&rdquo;. Brand was more fun when he was merely full of &ldquo;rodomontade&rdquo;, meaning boastful talk – it derives from the braggart Rodomonte, a character in the Orlando epics.</p>
<p>When gazing at Ms Kim Kardashian&rsquo;s naked rear, as we were encouraged to do last autumn, the marvellous word &ldquo;steatopygous&rdquo; springs to mind, meaning &ldquo;having excessive development of fat on the buttocks&rdquo;. Whether this makes the lady actually &ldquo;callipygous&rdquo; (&ldquo;having beautiful buttocks&rdquo;) we leave to the fashion world and her husband.</p>
<p>I cannot see a keyring, crammed with keys, hanging from the belt of some bloke&rsquo;s jeans without sighing for the loss of the most beautiful word in the dictionary – &ldquo;chatelaine&rdquo;, meaning the big circle of keys attached to a woman&rsquo;s belt (and symbolising that she runs the house, or chateau).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since anyone suggested that errant public figures have disgraced their family ancestors and descendants. So it would be nice to see the return of &ldquo;escutcheon&rdquo;, meaning a family shield with armorial bearings, and the phrase &ldquo;a blot on the escutcheon&rdquo; meaning a stain of the family&rsquo;s reputation. It&rsquo;s one of those Victorian words that just sound good, like &ldquo;tatterdemalion&rdquo;, meaning a ragamuffin, and &ldquo;dundreary&rdquo;, meaning long sideburns without a beard, as worn by Bradley Wiggins, and &ldquo;rubicund&rdquo; meaning red in the face or complexion but, more generally, well-disposed in a Dickensian way. &ldquo;Vituperate&rdquo; is a nice way of describing how you abuse (with perhaps a few &ldquo;maledictions&rdquo; or curses) your opponent, especially if he sits opposite you in the House of Commons and is, therefore, your &ldquo;pone&rdquo; (opponent).</p>
<p>The word I would most like to welcome back, however, is &ldquo;shibboleth&rdquo;, meaning a password or a test word of opinion (such as &ldquo;mansion tax&rdquo; or &ldquo;NHS cuts&rdquo;) which identifies one&rsquo;s adherence to a party or nationality. It derives from the Book of Judges in the Bible, and the war between Gileadites and the Ephraimites. If the former found a soldier wandering in their territory and suspected he was one of the latter, they would ask him to say the Hebrew word for an ear of corn. If he said &ldquo;shibboleth&rdquo;, he was okay; if he couldn&rsquo;t manage it and said &ldquo;scibboleth&rdquo; they&rsquo;d kill him. Using the word might remind politicians that some words in the past, like some principles, were a matter of life and death.

<h3 id="riddle-of-blaze-at-cork-city-theatre">&ldquo;Riddle of blaze at Cork city theatre&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.echolive.ie/portalsuite/image/b4d4794c-080d-4ae2-99a9-51beaf2c4a42/copy-article-theatre-royal-fire(2).jpg/mainMediaSize=600x0_type=image_publish=true__image.jpg" alt="img">
Riddle of blaze at Cork city theatre</p>
<p>The night in December, 1955, when Cork Opera House burned down, is etched forever in the memory of many older citizens. Less well known is the fact its predecessor, the Theatre Royal, also burned down 180 years ago this month. And, PAT POLAND reveals, &hellip;</p>
<p>HE was the foremost pop star of his day — if he were around now, he would have top billing at Live at the Marquee.</p>
<p>So when the Hungarian composer and virtuoso pianist, Franz Liszt, arrived in Cork for a series of concerts in 1840, he would have expected to perform at the city’s premier entertainment centre, the Theatre Royal on George’s Street (now Oliver Plunkett Street).</p>
<p>His recitals, however, had to take place in the Clarence Hall of the nearby Imperial Hotel, for the theatre had burned down in a spectacular fire that April.</p>
<p>Opening its doors to the public in July, 1760, the Theatre Royal was the second venue of that name in Cork: the previous one stood at the corner of George’s Street and Playhouse Lane (now Prince’s Street).</p>
<p>The new theatre was erected between Morgan’s Lane (now Morgan Street) and Five-Alley Lane (now Pembroke Street) on the footprint occupied today by the General Post Office. Its address was 29, George’s Street.</p>
<p>Samuel Hobbs, carpenter/architect with Cork Corporation (and the designer of Clarke’s Bridge, still fully functioning) was responsible for the theatre’s handsome colonnaded façade.</p>
<p>Hailed as one of Cork’s finest buildings, its dimensions made it the largest theatre in Ireland outside of Dublin. Every famous artiste who performed in Ireland played the Theatre Royal and the city ‘taxi rank’ was located there.</p>
<p>Protected from the weather by the colonnade, the so-called ‘Chairmen’ waited patiently with their sedan chairs for their ‘fares’. They would carry you — literally — to any point in the city; 4d (four pence) for the ‘flat’ of the city, and 6d (six pence) to the suburbs.</p>
<p>In 1827, the theatre was closed for a time for refurbishment, and the Cork Constitution gives us a brief insight into what it may have looked like on the night of its burning a few years later:</p>
<p>“This theatre is now one of the neatest and most compact in Ireland, and little inferior to many of note in the Metropolis of the Sister Kingdom. All the boxes are newly molded in gold, and tastefully festooned with pink satin. The seats are newly covered, and backed most comfortably. The seats in the pit are also covered with green cloth, which, together with the light appearance of the house, and the brilliancy of the gas, has a very pretty effect indeed.”</p>
<hr>
<p>RIVAL: The site of Frank Seymour’s Theatre Royal Victoria in Cook Street, now Woodwards Auctioneers</p>
<p>Theatres were notoriously susceptible to fire. With little or no effective fire separation between stage and auditorium, many had a common roof extending over both areas.</p>
<p>Lighting was by gas, but supplementary lighting in the form of hanging lamps, sconces and candles was also used. Limelight, used to create brilliant effects on stage, was created by heating pure lime by means of the constant application of gas-fired burners. The swirling skirts or billowing dresses of the actresses on stage were only inches away.</p>
<p>Very little supervision was exercised by the authorities, who were far more concerned with an actress showing a naughty glimpse of leg than with public safety.</p>
<p>Galleries were built with no alternative means of escape. Dark, tortuous passages and steep, obstructed narrow stairs, down which the public in their hundreds were expected to flee in an emergency, were the norm.</p>
<p>Architects of the day saw nothing wrong with incorporating low roofs and small exit doors in their plans. Firefighting appliances, other than water buckets (which more often than not were full of rubbish) were usually non-existent.</p>
<p>Some nights before the fire at the Theatre Royal in Cork, a curious thing happened. The theatre had closed for the night and it appeared everyone had gone home, but two women were left on the premises, quietly working away in a remote corner. One thought she got a peculiar smell, and on investigation, found a bottle with a candle lighting in it, hidden near some flammable material. She called her friend, and when they went to snuff it out, the bottle exploded, scattering burning liquid all around. With great presence of mind, they fortunately managed to quench the incipient blaze.</p>
<p>Then, on the Friday night before the blaze, a policeman on his beat near the theatre ‘perceived a most disagreeable smell’ which he took to be something burning. Not being able to find anything amiss, he had a word with the night watchman to ‘look out against fire’.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the early hours of Palm Sunday, April 12, 1840, the Theatre Royal was totally destroyed in a fire after the last performance before Easter.</p>
<p>The curtains had been drawn around midnight following a ‘benefit for Mr and Mrs Wood’, a noted singing duo. The fire was discovered just after 2am when flames were observed bursting through the roof. As news spread across the city, the church bells began ringing the traditional ‘reverse peal’ (known as ‘ringing the bells backwards’) to alert the various firefighting agencies.</p>
<p>In the absence of a public fire service, these comprised private fire brigades maintained by a number of insurance companies and the (mostly decrepit) parish pumps kept up by the Church of Ireland.</p>
<p>All the insurance ‘fire stations’ were located within striking distance of the burning theatre. The Royal Exchange ‘engine house’ at 5, South Mall; the Atlas, at the top of Cook Street at its junction with South Mall; the West of England, on Charlotte Quay (now, Fr Mathew Quay), while the fire engine of the Scottish Union was housed at 50, George’s Street (the old location of Liam Ruiséal’s bookshop). A parish pump from St Paul’s church in Paul Street also attended.</p>
<p>In the entire city, there were just 39 fire hydrants (or ‘fire plugs’, as they were known) owned by a private outfit, the Cork Pipe Water Company. The nearest was right opposite the theatre; others were on Patrick Street and South Mall. (Not until 1858 was the city equipped with a network of fire hydrants provided by Cork Corporation. Cast-iron plaques that identified their location — with the letters ‘FC’ standing for ‘Fire Cock’ — still adorn many walls today).</p>
<p>The Cork Constitution of April 14, 1840, takes up the story: “The engines arrived about half-past two, and the roof of the theatre on the first discharge of water fell in. The flames ascended with a power, a brilliancy, and a variety (the latter arising from the colours employed in the painting and decorations) which, had it been unattended with danger, would have rendered the spectacle magnificent. For miles around, the city was, we may say, illuminated, and the property destroyed is considerable.</p>
<p>“As nothing could be done to save it, the efforts of the engines were directed to the protection of surrounding buildings. The West of England engine took up its station opposite Austen’s Tavern, and to the vigour with which it was worked the preservation of the Tavern is attributable. The same service was rendered to the Savings Bank and Dublin Coach Office by the Atlas, the Royal Exchange and the Scottish Union engines.</p>
<p>HUSTLE AND BUSTLE: The Theatre Royal in 1877, after it was remodelled following the 1840 blaze</p>
<p>“After the first quarter of an hour, the supply of water was abundant, and to this, and the stillness of the night we owe it, under Providence, that we have not to announce one of the most extensive and calamitous fires with which the city was ever visited.”</p>
<p>Some of the first responders thought they were dealing with two separate buildings, so great was the gap between the blazes. This gave rise to the suspicion that fires had been started at two quite distinct points in the building.</p>
<p>Others said, from their vantage point, they observed only one major fire billowing up through the roof from the bowels of the theatre.</p>
<p>In any event, by 5am the building was a heap of smouldering ruins, along with the wardrobes, orchestral instruments, a valuable collection of old music, and three pianos, two of them of considerable value.</p>
<p>To the consternation of the lessee, a Mr Paumier, it was discovered that no insurance on the building or its contents had been taken out by its owner, John McDonnell.</p>
<p>Frank Seymour, owner of the rival Theatre Royal Victoria in nearby Cook Street (today occupied by Joseph Woodward and Sons, Auctioneers) was among the last to leave the premises that night, but he had a perfectly good excuse for being there.</p>
<p>During the time that Paumier had leased the Theatre Royal, Seymour had agreed to close his own theatre in return for a regular income and to be employed as a sort of general factotum by Paumier. However, they had a row over the arrangement, and Seymour sued Paumier for breach of contract — allegations that he subsequently withdrew. It was no secret, however, that bad blood remained between them.</p>
<p>The newspapers reported that Seymour had now offered the use of his premises ‘in the most liberal manner’ to the company of the Theatre Royal. But many in Cork were suspicious of Seymour’s new-found philanthropy.</p>
<hr>
<p>Frank Seymour was a native of Cork who, in his younger days, kept a shop. He was described as having a ‘rubicund visage, portly figure, and a deep, rolling voice’. Always professing an interest in the theatre, over time he gradually drifted onto the stage in a whole-time capacity.</p>
<p>He became well-known for his eccentricities, one acquaintance describing him in the following terms: “He could combine 20 occupations without being clever in one. He was actor, fiddler, painter, machinist, and tailor, besides check-taker and bill poster on occasions. But he prided himself more especially on his talents as an actor. This harmless eccentricity rendered him very dear to the Cork theatre-goers, who mercifully regarded his strong faith in his dramatic abilities as a mental weakness. He was the most impecunious fellow to be found anywhere; always in debt and constitutionally disinclined to pay anybody.”</p>
<p>One too-trusting Italian diva who performed to full houses received her fee in the form of a bundle of ‘banknotes’, well-wrapped, from Seymour, just as she was about to depart by coach for Dublin. The ‘innocent abroad’ did not open her wages until halfway to the capital, to discover that the ‘cash’ was nothing more than old theatre posters cut down to size!</p>
<p>To those Seymour met on the street who politely enquired after his health, the answer was, invariably: “High in spirits but low in purse.”</p>
<p>A critic recalled: “As an actor he had no real ability whatever. On the stage he was a mere parrot. He did his best, poor soul, and he meant well, even if he achieved very little. He often repeated his lines in a play apparently without the least grasp of their real meaning.”</p>
<p>A spectator who saw him perform in Belfast said he was “a queer character and a most unreliable man, who attempted all manner of parts and played them all badly”. Theatre scholar W. J. Alexander regarded him as “an adventurer of the shadiest type, as unscrupulous as he was illiterate”.</p>
<p>As well as acting, Seymour managed theatres in Ireland and Scotland, one fellow thespian recalling that his nickname was “‘Schemer’ Seymour for his extraordinarily sharp practice played upon the various stars who had visited his theatre”.</p>
<p>In time, he rose to owning his own place in Glasgow, which burned down in 1829. That all but ruined him, and he never fully recovered.</p>
<p>Returning to Cork, in 1832, he secured a position as manager of the Theatre Royal. Six years later he was able to scrape enough money together to open his own venue at 26, Cook Street, which he named the Theatre Royal Victoria.</p>
<p>And now, with the main opposition a heap of smouldering ruins, people had no option but to turn to Frank Seymour for their entertainment&hellip;</p>
<hr>
<p>Facing financial ruin, John McDonnell took a malicious injuries claim against the city for his loss in the sum of £4,000. If successful, the sum would have been levied on the city rate.</p>
<p>On May 16, 1840, his submission was heard by representatives of the ratepayers at the City Presentment Sessions. McDonnell testified he was early at the scene of the fire. At that point, he said, the auditorium was still intact, but fires were raging round the lobby and stage areas — at opposite ends of the building.</p>
<p>Witnesses were called, some of whom generally corroborated McDonnell’s evidence.</p>
<p>Conspiratorially, the Cork Standard revealed: “We have just heard that some most extraordinary facts have transpired with respect to the cause of the fire, but as the whole matter is at the moment the subject of a strict inquiry, we forbear, for prudential reasons, further alluding to it.”</p>
<p>Although Seymour’s name was never mentioned in court in connection with the fire, the dogs in the street knew to whom McDonnell’s lawyers were alluding when claiming the fire was maliciously set.</p>
<p>Hardly had the last ashes been doused when the rumour mill among Cork’s chattering classes moved into top gear, and all the fingers of suspicion fell on one suspect only: Seymour.</p>
<p>But hearsay, of the ‘Dúirt bean liom go ndúirt bean léi’ variety, is not, and was not then, admissible as evidence in a court of law, and McDonnell’s claim failed. Unfazed, he reopened his case before a judge and jury at the City Court in August, with the same result.</p>
<hr>
<p>For some 13 years after, Seymour’s theatre was Cork’s main venue for the performing arts. A visit by Thackeray left the famous novelist singularly unimpressed. At the time, a military brass band was playing with gusto, and Thackeray, who thought the place small and unremarkable, fled, unable to stand the cacophony of sound. The last performance in the Theatre Royal Victoria took place in 1859 after which it became Lambkin’s Tobacco Factory.</p>
<p>For a while, Pablo Fanque operated his Circus Royal on the site of the burned-out theatre, and in 1853 local builder and entrepreneur, Dick Burke, opened his new Theatre Royal there, “remodelled from designs under the superintendence of Sir John Benson”, the City Architect.</p>
<p>In 1875, the building was sold to the Royal Mail, whose General Post Office already stood around the corner in Pembroke Street. Elements of the old theatre’s façade were incorporated into the newly-enlarged GPO, which opened in 1877 and can still be admired to this day.</p>
<p>Although, it must be acknowledged, Frank Seymour came through the whole episode with honour intact, for a generation of Corkonians ‘Schemer Seymour’ had a lot to answer for&hellip;

Sir Magnus Holmes, cousin to the more famous Sherlock, is asked to investigate the appearance of an otherworldly knight carrying a legendary sword in the cellar of a Victorian London pub.</p>
<p>“We was ’oping for t’other ’Olmes to take an interest,” said the publican. He wiped his fingers again on his striped apron as if this might somehow remove the strong aroma of beer that emanated not just from his hands, but his entire being. “Meaning no hoffence, your ’onour.”</p>
<p>He might mean no offence, but there was considerable doubt evident in his gaze, and some suspicion. This was centred on the recently regrown, rather wispy Van Dyke moustache and beard on the sprig of gentility in front of him, as if the facial hair might in fact be a disguise of some sort. A very bad one.</p>
<p>“Everyone wants Sherlock,” replied Sir Magnus Holmes with a heartfelt sigh. “However, I am here at his behest.”</p>
<p>“Beg yer pardon?” asked Jolyon.</p>
<p>“Sherlock sent me in answer to your note,” explained Sir Magnus, with an air of resignation. Nearly all his conversations, whether involving anything of importance or not, began with his cousinly connection to the very famous Sherlock.</p>
<p>Jolyon brightened a little at this, as Magnus continued.</p>
<p>“He considers this more of a matter for my particular talents, as it were. I do have my own expertise in certain areas. Allow me to introduce you to my keeper, Almost Doctor Susan Shrike. Mister Jolyon, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Julius Jolyon,” answered the publican automatically. “Er, your keeper, sir?”</p>
<p>“Sir Magnus will have his little jokes,” said the raven-haired young woman who did indeed carry a doctor’s Gladstone bag as if it were her constant companion, her attitude toward it making it seem not out of place with her otherwise modish, though sombre, ensemble of a deep blue velvet coat over a long dress, lace-cuffed and -collared. This was topped with a soft cap in a lighter shade of blue, adorned with a diamond brooch of some antiquity. “He meant to say medical consultant.”</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” said Jolyon. “Wery pleased to meet you, miss . . . er . . . halmost doctor.”</p>
<p>“What exactly is the trouble?” asked Sir Magnus. “Sherlock wasn’t very forthcoming, nor Doctor Watson.”</p>
<p>Susan Shrike sniffed at the mention of Doctor Watson, indicating her opinion of the man’s medical skills. He was very much of the old school and quite out of date as far as she was concerned. Susan hadn’t quite graduated yet from the London School of Medicine for Women, which was why Magnus liked to call her “almost doctor”, but she soon would be one of the very first officially recognised female doctors in Great Britain. Though this was only formal recognition of her skills and experience. Susan had been practicing medicine, of one kind or another, since she was fourteen.</p>
<p>“Best I show you, but the cellar’s . . . wery dirty,” said Jolyon doubtfully as he looked Sir Magnus up and down. The baronet was nattily attired, sporting a dove grey top hat, a frock coat of a similar shade, and a darker waistcoat with an unusually heavy gold watch chain. His collar was highly starched, his shirt white as the proverbial driven snow, his tie inimitable, and his immaculately pressed trousers seemed to almost merge with his shoes of brilliant patent leather.</p>
<p>He carried a cane with an ivory-and-gold handle, and all in all looked like someone who had never once crossed the threshold of a dirty cellar and never would.</p>
<p>“Nothing I like better!” exclaimed Sir Magnus. “Old holes in the ground are something of a specialty of mine.”</p>
<p>This was true, after a fashion. Sir Magnus’s primary area of knowledge was arcane practices, many of them necessarily conducted out of the sight of ordinary folk, and so very often underground. From necessity he had become more conversant than he would have liked with caves, hypogea, catacombs, Mithraeums, vaults, crypts, cellars, tunnels and all the other subterranean lairs and dwellings of those whose delvings were sorcerous as well as earthly. He was also quite knowledgeable about sacred groves and the like.</p>
<p>“Your inn, I believe, was built in 1539, as is proclaimed by the date in the stonework above the stables?”</p>
<p>“Rebuilt, sir,” said Jolyon proudly. “The hinitial hestablishment was one of them beer monks’ places, put up in the first William’s time, and as my grand-dad ’ad ’ad it they weren’t the first ’ere, oh no, there’s been beer ’ere since druid days, and Romans and all, some say.”</p>
<p>“Cistercians, I fancy,” muttered Sir Magnus to Susan, correctly divining the question forming on her lips concerning “beer monks”.</p>
<p>“If you’ve no hobjection, sir, it’s this way,” said Jolyon. “Would you care to take a gin and water in the parlour, the private parlour, miss . . . doctor—”</p>
<p>“I would not,” said Susan. “Where would Sir Magnus be if he needed my medical advice in the cellar if I’m in the parlour? I am not afraid of dirt. Or blood, for that matter.”</p>
<p>“Blood! There ent no blood!”</p>
<p>“Is your cellar well lit, Mister Jolyon?” asked Susan.</p>
<p>“Bright enough to see blood, if there was some!” protested Jolyon.</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s not what I meant,” said Susan. “Only Sir Magnus has sensitive eyes and does not see well in the dark. A storm lantern or similar will be necessary.”</p>
<p>“I am . . . that is my eyes . . . are almost completely better!” protested Sir Magnus, but he subsided as Susan arched her left eyebrow a fraction. He could see extremely well in the dark, as a matter of fact, but darkness of the kind that would be found in a cellar after, say, a single candle was extinguished, might trigger an unpleasant change in Sir Magnus, though he was mostly better.</p>
<p>Some months before, also while assisting a cousin, in this case Mycroft Holmes, Sir Magnus had been involved in a fracas with a particularly powerful sorcerer, a famous Hanoverian magical philosopher known as Krongeitz. He had originally come to England with George I, attempted to meddle with matters of state, been found out, tried to flee to join the Pretender, and got caught. He had then been immured in a bronze casket by Conyers Darcy, bearer of the white staff as Comptroller of the Household and thus, far less publically, Walpole’s secret Master of Magic.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the records noting who was in the casket had been misplaced. Decades later the casket itself was moved from the deep cellars of the Tower of London and it had eventually ended up for sale at a church fete in Kent. The buyer, a curious curate, had opened the casket. Krongeitz had emerged alive and apparently none the worse for his long confinement, apart from a raging desire to wreak his revenge upon King George. Or, as it turned out, George’s descendent, Queen Victoria.</p>
<p>It had taken all the genius of Mycroft, some detective work from Sherlock, and the arcane talents of Sir Magnus and several others to defeat Krongeitz. He was once again in the casket, but it had been a very close-run thing, and Sir Magnus had copped a very powerful curse, which, despite various ameliorative spells and treatments continued to lurk within him.</p>
<p>The curse was triggered by darkness and certain other stimuli, so it was important to keep Sir Magnus well illuminated. An unpleasant change in the baronet would result in the irreversible change commonly known as “death” to everyone in the vicinity, in this case not just Mister Jolyon’s inn, but the entirety of Clerkenwell, and perhaps even farther afield.</p>
<p>“There’s two candles under glass to light ’im,” said Jolyon. “And I generally carries down a lamp.”</p>
<p>“Him?” asked Sir Magnus.</p>
<p>“Best y’see yourself,” replied the publican, leading them behind the bar to a storeroom, well stocked with bottles, kegs and barrels, with a door at the far end propped half-open. Beyond the door lay rough-hewn stone steps heading down into the twilit depths, accented by the flicker of candlelight.</p>
<p>Susan reached into the surprisingly voluminous pocket of her coat, and checked her purse revolver was positioned for swift removal and use. She had a larger British Bulldog revolver in her medical bag, but often the few seconds gained by using the little .32 were more important than the Bulldog’s .450 bite. Should gunfire prove to be ineffectual, Sir Magnus had a silvered blade within his cane. Should that not be sufficient, Sir Magnus was currently a weapon himself, after a fashion, albeit a double-edged sword . . .</p>
<p>Jolyon paused at the top of the steps to take down a lantern, which he lit with a match struck against his heel, the puff of sulphur-tainted smoke it sent up making Sir Magnus wrinkle his nose. After trimming the wick, the innkeeper settled the glass and held the lantern high as he started downwards.</p>
<p>“Watch yer step,” he warned, tapping with his boot to indicate that the middle of each stone step was deeply worn from use over centuries, creating slippery hollows, so it was safer to tread on the sides.</p>
<p>The cellar was much larger than anyone might have expected, far larger than the inn above. Even Jolyon’s lamp illuminated only a small portion of what seemed to be a limitless cavern, supported here and there by pillars of stone and brick and beams of ancient oak, evidence of several different ages of excavation and expansion. There were many barrels and kegs, and racks of wine holding cobwebbed and dusty bottles.</p>
<p>Some thirty feet away, in a straight line from the steps, there was a simple candle lantern set on a crate. In its small pool of light, Sir Magnus saw a man sitting on the stone floor, cradling a sword.</p>
<p>Not merely a man. A knight. Rusted mail hung off him, under a surcoat so rent and torn it was little more than rags over the metal. His battered shield, split in several places, lay at his side. His dented helmet was upended by his feet, which were wrapped in straps of leather, reinforcing the remnants of boots that had been marched on too far and for too long.</p>
<p>The knight’s hair was long and filthy, as were his moustache and beard, and was of no discernable colour, save that of dirt. His face was obscured by more dirt. He did not look up, his attention fixed on the goblet he held in his hand, a battered thing also, of brass or bronze, held at such an angle that wine slopped from it over his fingers, which were as dirty as his face. An empty bottle lay nearby, companionably nestled against a plate of gnawed chop bones.</p>
<p>Only the sword was bright and clean. A great sword, made to be wielded in two hands, its cross-guard dark iron above the brighter metal of the blade. It towered above the sitting man, the point wedged in a gap between flagstones, the flat of the blade resting on his chest and shoulder, the hilt high above his head, the bronze-wired grip and heavy bronze pommel gleaming.</p>
<p>There was writing on the blade, gold runes brighter even than the steel.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t stink,” whispered Susan to Magnus. “He should reek.”</p>
<p>“He’s not entirely present,” Magnus whispered back. “In this world, I mean.”</p>
<p>“Why is the sword so bright and clean when he is not?”</p>
<p>“Ah, there you have it,” whispered Magnus infuriatingly. “It is all about the sword.”</p>
<p>He raised his voice to speak to the publican.</p>
<p>“How long has he been here? Has he spoken?”</p>
<p>The knight did not move, or show any sign of hearing Magnus.</p>
<p>“My Norbert wuz first to spy ’im,” replied Jolyon. “When I sent ’im down for the ’48 claret. Day afore yesterdee. Just as ’e is now, sitting with that there blade. Norbert arsks ’im what ’e’s up to, but ’e don’t talk until Norbert gets up close and then ’e says foreign for ‘wine’—which Norbert knows on account of his Navy times in the Mediterabeum—and ’e ’ands over a coin or two.”</p>
<p>“He’s been here two days, like this?” asked Magnus. “But you only sent word to ask for Sherlock’s assistance this morning?”</p>
<p>“The coins wuz gold . . .”</p>
<p>“I see,” said Sir Magnus. “Could you show me one of these coins, please?”</p>
<p>“I ’spose I might ’ave one on me person,” said Jolyon reluctantly. He rummaged under his apron, hands moving in an apparent attempt to misdirect the onlookers as to where he actually kept his cash. After several more mysterious movements, he withdrew a small gold coin and slowly handed it over to Magnus.</p>
<p>“Hmmm. A Byzantine ἱστάμενον, which is to say, a histamenon,” remarked the baronet, holding it up close to his left eye. “Of Isaac I Komnenos. Here, take it and touch it against one of the iron hoops of that barrel.”</p>
<p>“Wot? Like this—”</p>
<p>The gold coin turned into sand as it touched the cold iron, trickling through the publican’s fingers. He gasped in surprise and, very quickly, sorrow.</p>
<p>“But! It wuz . . . it wuz gold!”</p>
<p>“Some would call it fairy gold, Jolyon,” said Magnus. “How close do you have to get before he responds?”</p>
<p>“Close,” replied Jolyon, faintly stunned. He was rummaging about under his apron again. “I ’spose the gold would stay good along as it doesn’t touch no iron?”</p>
<p>“Only until the new moon,” said Magnus. “Best not try and use it, Jolyon.”</p>
<p>“But ’e’s ’ad a dozen bottles of my best Burgundy,” protested Jolyon, his mind apparently more ready to grasp the concept of “fairy gold” than it was his own monetary loss. “And prime wittles as well. Best Yorkshire ’am, sausage, Mother Jolyon’s pork pie . . .”</p>
<p>“Why did you . . . eventually . . . ask for Sherlock’s assistance?” asked Susan. She delicately did not dwell on the fact that the prospect of more gold had clearly delayed any earlier attempt. But why had fear or suspicion eventually overcome the greed?</p>
<p>“Well, at first I took ’im for a heccentric gentleman,” replied Jolyon shiftily. “A payin’ one . . . but then there was the water . . .”</p>
<p>“Water?” asked Magnus.</p>
<p>“I come down this morning and ’e’s sitting in a river! Water a-gushin’ and rushin’ all around ’im, coming from nowhere, going nowhere! Now that ent natural, is it?”</p>
<p>“No, it isn’t,” said Magnus. “I think I know what it is happening here, but I’d better have a few words with the chap myself. Susan, there is a slight chance that the . . . um . . . mythic envelope around this chap might trigger the Krongeitz . . . er . . . effect, so if you would prepare yourself?”</p>
<p>Susan nodded, set down her bag and undid the straps. Jolyon looked properly mystified, as was to be hoped.</p>
<p>Almost Doctor Susan Shrike’s primary responsibility as Magnus’s keeper was to be alert for the effects of the curse that the sorcerer Krongeitz had placed upon the baronet. This very powerful malediction that had resisted all attempts at removal, even by Magister Dadd, current leader of the coterie of official British sorcerers. The curse was fading, but until it was entirely dissipated, Magnus had to spend his nights locked up in the most private and secure wing of the Bethlem Royal Hospital for the Insane, and either Susan or more rarely one of Dadd’s other associates accompanied him everywhere in daylight hours.</p>
<p>This was a form of torture for Magnus, who was deeply in love with Susan, but he would not declare himself until he was free of the curse. Susan was also in love with Magnus, but would not admit it, since she was his keeper.</p>
<p>In the meantime Susan was both witness to the more humiliating effects of the curse on Magnus and was also at great risk in her role as his keeper and safeguard, both things Magnus wished she were not subjected to. All this, combined with typical British reticence to discuss their relationship and its problems, led them to behave in such a repressed way to each other that everyone else around them knew immediately they were in love.</p>
<p>“Be careful, Sir Magnus,” said Susan.</p>
<p>Magnus stepped up close to the knight, who instantly reared up, lifting the sword. Curiously he did not hold it as a weapon, but grasped it under the hilt and brandished it as a cross.</p>
<p>“I have sanctuary here!” he growled. “I will not return to the Lady!”</p>
<p>He spoke a form of Latin, interspersed with some Welsh words, as Magnus had expected. He replied in his more classical Latin, knowing he would be understood.</p>
<p>“I’m not from the Lady,” soothed Magnus. “Nor do I seek to take you from sanctuary.”</p>
<p>The knight did not lower the sword. Magnus could smell him very strongly now, the stench of days or weeks without washing mixed with old blood and fear. Interestingly, apart from the few feet around the knight, the rest of the cellar had vanished into impenetrable darkness. Magnus was grateful the candle lantern was close by, light sufficient to hold back the curse that sought to rise within his blood and bone. He could feel it trying to manifest, an evil within that desired to join the darkness without.</p>
<p>“That sword,” said Magnus. “It is the king’s?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said the knight dully. “It is the king’s.”</p>
<p>“I think the king asked you to take it somewhere in particular,” suggested Magnus gently.</p>
<p>“Aye,” said the knight. He glanced at Magnus, but kept peering off nervously to one side and then the other, as if he couldn’t make out what he saw there. “But he was wounded, nigh unto death. His mind was wandering, he was tempted by devils . . . I am a good Christian, I could not do as he asked!”</p>
<p>“I see,” said Magnus, his voice still soft, without threat. “You are Sir Bedivere, then?”</p>
<p>The knight shook his head. “My name is Bedwyr ap Pedrod.”</p>
<p>Magnus nodded. They were essentially one and the same, albeit differently named in various strands of the legend.</p>
<p>“I will not give up the sword to anyone save the bishop,” said Bedwyr firmly. “But he does not come . . .” He stared to the sides, eyes hooded, mouth working, dismayed words held back, until he could hold them back no more. “This is not the chapel!”</p>
<p>“No . . .”</p>
<p>The knight clapped a hand against his eyes and peered between his fingers. “Chapel . . . tavern . . . the very ground shifts and changes . . . I will not relinquish this sacred trust, no matter how long the Lady keeps me in this prison hole!”</p>
<p>Magnus looked around again. It was entirely possible Bedwyr did see himself in a prison hole. It was a kind of hole, in fact, though not one dug in earth, but a pinched-off pocket of unreality that should not exist.</p>
<p>“Have you tried to leave?”</p>
<p>Bedwyr looked near him, his half-crazed eyes trying to focus.</p>
<p>“How can I pass solid rock? Or reach the clean air so high above? Unless I take your ladder—”</p>
<p>He lunged at Magnus, but the baronet was already skipping backwards, out of the darkness, back into the storm lantern’s brighter light, where Susan and Jolyon looked on. Bedwyr subsided back into his crouch, oblivious to the greater world.</p>
<p>Magnus noted Susan’s searching gaze. He nodded to indicate he was unaffected by his curse. So far, at least.</p>
<p>“Well,” he said to Jolyon. “I think this can be sorted out. Tell me, have you any guests in the rooms upstairs at present? Any unusual guests, in particular?”</p>
<p>Jolyon’s rubicund forehead wrinkled.</p>
<p>“No guests at all just now, sir,” he said. “We only ’ave the three rooms, our main business being beer, as it were, and a little wine, and Mother Jolyon’s cooking, none finer for ordinary fare.”</p>
<p>“They must be close,” mused Magnus. “Any interesting characters become neighbours recently? Or, in fact, any new neighbours?”</p>
<p>Jolyon scratched his head, wiped his hands on his apron and scratched his head again.</p>
<p>“None I can think on,” he said. “None . . . none new.”</p>
<p>“Odd,” said Magnus. “Proximity is necessary . . . have you engaged any new servants? Any new customers hanging about?”</p>
<p>“No,” replied Jolyon.</p>
<p>“You said no new neighbours,” said Susan, who had caught how the publican had phrased his answer. “What about former neighbours who’ve returned after time away?”</p>
<p>“There’s old Mrs Davies!” said Jolyon. “You mean her? She ain’t new, but she has come back—”</p>
<p>“Where has this Mrs Davies returned to?”</p>
<p>“Next ’ouse along,” replied Jolyon, indicating an easterly direction with this thumb. “David Davies’s grand-dam she is, ’im as ’as the rag and bones shop, only ’e calls it a marine hemporium. He lives above, with his rib and I ’spose ’alf a dozen little ones, no it would be seven with Liccy as wuz born last month . . .”</p>
<p>“Where did Mrs Davies come back from?” asked Magnus. “And how long was she away?”</p>
<p>“She come back from wherever it wuz she went,” answered Jolyon with a shrug. “Nigh on twelve year ago she went off and just last Thursdee come back, as if she’d never left, and David ’aving to move the elder three chillum from the second-best room upstairs as was always ’ers. ’E never could gainsay ’is grand-dam, but then who could?”</p>
<p>“A commanding woman?” asked Magnus.</p>
<p>“The original matriarky,” confirmed Jolyon with a shudder. “I wuz that frightened of ’er as a boy. She leads ’er face, see, like the olden days. Frightful white, it is.”</p>
<p>Magnus and Susan exchanged a look. Certain kinds of sorcery and its associated alchemical practices led to gravely pockmarked skin, which practitioners covered up with a mask or heavy face paint. Indeed, as Jolyon said, in the old days often with the white lead paste favoured by great ladies.</p>
<p>“But what’s Mrs Davies got to do with this feller?” asked the publican.</p>
<p>“Oh, hard to say, hard to say, but her arriving at the same time may be of significance,” said Magnus. “We’ll have a chat with her, bye and bye.”</p>
<p>“And what about ’im?” asked Jolyon.</p>
<p>“Oh, he’ll be gone by nightfall,” said Magnus confidently. “As if he was never here. But let us ascend into daylight; we need not stay here any longer. Lay on, MacJolyon!”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>“Go ahead,” said Susan gently, taking Magnus’s arm to hold him back for a few seconds.</p>
<p>“What exactly is going on?” she whispered close to his ear as the landlord huffed his way up the steps, being careful to tread on the sides and avoid the bowed middle.</p>
<p>“That’s Sir Bedivere back there,” Magnus whispered back. “With Excalibur. Which he has not returned to the Lady of the Lake. He’s a good Christian and is waiting to give it to a bishop.”</p>
<p>“Bedivere? Excalibur? But how is that poss—”</p>
<p>“Perhaps I should say he is a sort of echo of Sir Bedivere,” said Sir Magnus. “A shadow cast by the primary legend, twisted aside from its proper course . . . lesser in all ways, but still somewhat potent. The sword too. I mean it is not the Excalibur, but even a second-hand mythic resonance holds power.”</p>
<p>“But you said he’s not really here! I presume the sword likewise—”</p>
<p>“It is present enough for the adept who summoned or created this little mythic bubble to fetch it forth,” said Magnus. “Come on, let’s catch up with our chrysophilist landlord.”</p>
<p>Jolyon had already left the storeroom and gone into the public bar, where faint sunshine forced its way through the smoke-begrimed windows. A single patron—a working man of indeterminate age—lay slumped over one of the six rough-hewn tables. He’d been there when they came in, albeit not snoring quite so loudly as he was now.</p>
<p>“Which would be the point, as it were,” continued Magnus. “It is very difficult to get hold of magic swords by other means these days, even lesser ones. It’s almost certainly wanted for some particular killing. I hope not another plot against Her Majesty, or the Prime Minister . . . damnation . . . I fear Mrs Davies has anticipated us.”</p>
<p>The bell above the door jangled as a white-faced, red-bonneted old lady in a black bombazine dress with an enormous bustle thrust her way inside, holding a large wicker basket ahead of her like a shield. She shut the door, muttering something under her breath.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>This last word and a momentary grip on Susan’s elbow arrested her motion towards her pocket, and the revolver therein.</p>
<p>“She’s an adept, it’ll only ricochet into her foes. She may not know us; we can bluff our way out—”</p>
<p>Even as he spoke, Mrs Davies saw him, stopped in the doorway and hissed like a train venting steam. Quick as a snake she reached into her basket, snatched a bottle and threw it at the baronet’s head.</p>
<p>Magnus jumped one way, Susan the other. The bottle hit the wall behind them and smashed, the green ichor it contained exploding into a web-like pattern of concentric circles and anchoring lines. The whole thing shivered, and the plasterwork behind it began to smoke and disappear.</p>
<p>“Blue pill!” snapped Magnus.</p>
<p>Susan was already on her knees, opening her bag, fingers expertly thrusting into the right pocket, gripping one of the large blue pills. She practiced exactly this for hours every week, knowing full well that when it was needed she would have to be swift and very accurate. She was swift, and the accuracy was demonstrated as she flung the pill unerringly into Magnus’s open mouth.</p>
<p>Even as he crunched down on the pill, Susan had the necklace of shimmering blue stones out and around her neck. There was only one such necklace in England, perhaps in all of Europe. It would only protect her, but all other mortals present would be in extreme peril from whatever Magnus was going to become.</p>
<p>Fear rose in her, but her greater fear was for Magnus. The blue pill activated the curse. Every time he took one, the curse’s hold on Magnus was strengthened and there was always the chance that with the encouragement of the blue pill, the curse would grow so entrenched it could never be removed. Then there would be only one recourse.</p>
<p>The yellow pill, to end the curse forever. And Magnus with it.. And Susan too, in all the ways that mattered.</p>
<p>All this flashed through her mind in an instant, but she did not, could not, dwell on it.</p>
<p>“Run, Mister Jolyon! Get everyone out!” she shouted. It wasn’t only what Magnus was becoming that scared her. The web of ichor now hung in a dark void where the old plasterwork had disappeared entirely, making a doorway into otherness. Something horrible, so horrible it could not be looked upon directly, was climbing up it, its wet multi-jointed legs scrabbling for purchase as if it were lifting itself up from some deep, differently oriented well at right angles to the wall.</p>
<p>Magnus screamed in agony and his clothes burst from him in all directions. Susan dropped to the floor as buttons flew overhead like bullets. Jolyon fell, struck by something, perhaps a patent leather shoe. He had not acted upon Susan’s warning; he’d just stood there with his mouth agape, eyes staring.</p>
<p>“Krongeitz!” swore Mrs Davies. She recognized what was happening and started to back out the door, scrabbling for something in her basket. But she was too slow. Magnus had become a cloud, an angry, roiling cloud of intense sapphire gas that rushed forward as if driven by an unseen, unfelt hurricane. The cloud fell upon the sorcerer in a fury, enveloped her, and there was a terrible shriek and the snap! snap! snap! of breaking bones. It dropped her a second later, a crumpled remnant, smashed flat like a worker crushed in a giant press.</p>
<p>Susan reached into her bag for the reversal powder, but the blue cloud was both swifter than she expected and smarter too, which was very unusual. Typically a Krongeitz transformee was a creature as stupid as it was lethal. This one wasn’t. The cloud moved so fast she barely saw it cross the room. It swept down and lifted her bag away, though it did not and could not touch Susan while she wore the necklace. She tried to snatch the bag back, but the cloud creature deposited it high in the beams of the sixteenth-century ceiling, beyond her reach.</p>
<p>The other creature chose that moment to launch itself out of its web, scuttling on its many limbs towards Susan, who leaped up on the closest table and drew her pocket revolver, emptying it at the thing even as she averted her eyes, unable to look directly at the abomination.</p>
<p>The bullets had little or no effect. Susan jumped to the next table, over the body of Jolyon.</p>
<p>The thing pursued her, but stopped at the innkeeper and lowered its bloated, blurry abdomen upon him. A moment later Jolyon’s arms and legs began to jerk and muffled cries began, which were mercifully cut short.</p>
<p>Susan choked and coughed as bile rose in her throat, but she kept moving. For a moment she hoped the blue cloud would attack the otherworldly entity that had come from the web, but Magnus did not. The curse made him into a monster tasked to kill people, and the web creature was as inhuman as you could get. Instead the cloud flew into the kitchen.</p>
<p>Someone in there—probably Mother Jolyon—screamed, but Susan ignored that. She ran for the storeroom, raced down the steps (remembering to tread on the sides) and rushed up to the knight, who jumped up and once brandished the sword as if it was a cross.</p>
<p>“I’m Saint . . . Saint Susan!” screamed Susan. The necklace of blue stones shone so brightly her head was surrounded by a nimbus of unearthly light, a veritable halo. “Give me the sword!”</p>
<p>Bedwyr handed over the sword with a sigh of great contentment and immediately vanished. Susan gripped the almost-Excalibur with both hands, surprised by its lack of weight, for it was not as heavy as she expected. Turning on her heel, she saw the thing from the web had finished with Jolyon and come after her.</p>
<p>It was fast, too fast. For a terrible fraction of a second Susan thought it would be on her before she could raise the sword.</p>
<p>But it went down the middle of the steps, and even with its many legs, it slid on the bowed and shiny stone and fell over itself, its terrible charge almost a pratfall, if anyone could bear to look at it long enough to laugh.</p>
<p>Susan brought the sword down once, twice, three times. She shuddered and choked and tried not to breathe in the hideous stench as sprays of ichor, pieces of wiry chitin and gobbets of horrid flesh flew from every sword stroke.</p>
<p>Interestingly, once the creature was dismembered and thoroughly dead, Susan had no difficulty looking at its component parts. But she did not pause for longer examination. She laid the ersatz Excalibur down with a whispered “thank you,” took the brooch from her cap, opened it with her fingernail, removed the emergency screw of paper that held the reversal powder and ran up the stairs.</p>
<p>Though she wished no ill will on Mother Jolyon or the staff of the inn, it was too late to hope for anything save that killing them had delayed the transformed Magnus long enough that he was still in the building. If he got outside, into the streets of London . . . if he remained in that shape until nightfall . . .</p>
<p>The blue cloud emerged from the kitchen as Susan came out of the storeroom. Again it moved more swiftly than she had anticipated, crossing the room in a split second to reach the door. But even as it gripped the handle and pulled upon it, Susan ran and threw the powder.</p>
<p>The cloud darted aside, fast as ever, and Susan gasped as she thought it had evaded every last grain of the antidote. But the cloud shivered and stopped in place. It shrank in on itself and with a pathetic popping noise, suddenly became Magnus again.</p>
<p>Naked and sobbing, he dropped down on all fours and vomited.</p>
<p>The single, drunken patron had been killed by the cloud and like Mrs Davies was now only a pile of compressed bones and skin, but his many-times patched overcoat was still over the back of the chair. Susan took it and draped it over Magnus’s shoulders. She had to tread around the remains of Jolyon to do so. His corpse was like something fished from the river after several weeks, all jelly and slime.</p>
<p>“You used the almost-Excalibur on the creature Mrs Davies summoned?” asked Magnus, wiping his mouth, though he did not get up. He glanced around, his eyes hooded, noting the crushed and flattened bodies. Then he looked over at the door to the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Susan. She followed his glance and added, “You did go in there. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“What was I?”</p>
<p>“Nothing I’ve seen before. A cloud. A thing of vapour, or gas. It was clever. Unusually so.”</p>
<p>Susan pointed to her bag in the roof beams.</p>
<p>Magnus nodded wearily.</p>
<p>“I’ll write it up in the book,” said Susan.</p>
<p>Magnus nodded again, even more wearily.</p>
<p>“Are you fit to move?” asked Susan. “We probably only have a few minutes. Someone will come in, and I don’t suppose Mycroft will want to be explaining you to the authorities for the second time this month.”</p>
<p>Magnus rose to his feet, pulled the overcoat around himself and buttoned it up. Susan got a chair, put it on the table, stood on it and retrieved her bag. While she did so, Magnus went to the front door, shot the top and bottom bolts, then walked over to the kitchen door and looked within. His shoulders sagged and he turned away.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t you,” said Susan. “Mrs Davies would have killed everyone anyway. Anyone who saw her with the sword.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” said Magnus. “We shall have to look into her family, you know. She was probably a descendent of Huw Llwyd, the so-called ‘Welsh Wizard’, and there might be others of the blood who have taken her path. We should leave the front door locked, go out through the kitchen. Did the sword vanish after you used it?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Susan. “Should it have? Bedwyr disappeared.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’d better make sure,” replied Magnus. “Splash as much brandy and gin about as you can up here—we need to burn the place. I don’t like the look of Jolyon’s corpse. There’s something moving about inside it. Eggs, I imagine.”</p>
<p>Susan was sick then, despite herself, despite everything she’d seen and done, both as a medical student and as one of Dadd’s keepers. But she vomited efficiently, wiped her mouth and went to work, grabbing bottles from the bar, pulling corks with her teeth and liberally sprinkling alcohol everywhere. She poured an entire small keg of the inn’s best brandy over the corpse of Jolyon.</p>
<p>Magnus came back up with a long package wrapped in sacking under one arm and the candle lantern held high. Susan looked at the package and raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“I don’t know why it persists,” said Magnus. He was pale and moved slowly, as if his feet were weighed down. “It is only a mythic echo; it shouldn’t be here. Such things are summoned for a single use. But it remains . . . and we can’t leave it behind. Come on.”</p>
<p>At the doorway to the kitchen, he threw the lantern. Glass shattered, candle grease spewed out, there was a sudden whoosh of sapphire blue flames as the alcohol caught. The fire spread instantly, following trails of gin and brandy back towards the many bottles and barrels in and around the bar. Smoke billowed up, not quite quickly enough to cloak the horrid writhing as whatever was within Jolyon’s corpse reacted to the fire.</p>
<p>In the lane behind the inn, Magnus suddenly stopped. Susan, who had paused to shut the kitchen door behind her, almost ran into his back.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I’ve just realised,” said Magnus.</p>
<p>“What?” asked Susan. She looked up at the sky. Though there were probably two hours till sunset, she was very keen to get both herself and Magnus back to Bethlem. She took his arm and urged him on to the next lane, from which they could cut back through to Rawstone Street, where Carstairs was waiting with the hansom cab. The sooner they were out of sight the better. Particularly the barefoot, wild-eyed Magnus, who was quite evidently naked under the greatcoat, since it lacked its three lower buttons and couldn’t be entirely done up.</p>
<p>“Mrs Davies had greater powers than I suspected. She managed to conjure more than the echoes of Bedivere and the sword.”</p>
<p>“What!”</p>
<p>“The water flowing through the knight’s pocket reality. Think of the legend, the usual story.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I see,” said Susan. She looked around as they emerged from the lane, almost in a panic. But there was only the usual London horde thronging in the street, and Carstairs had spotted them and was whistling up his horse and forcing the cab into an imaginary gap in the foot traffic. “You mean there will be a Lady somewhere here . . . a mythic creature . . . will she be hostile? We have to tell Dadd!”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think she’ll be hostile,” said Magnus thoughtfully. “Provided we complete the legend as it should be.”</p>
<p>“Right,” said Susan, calming herself. “That makes sense.”</p>
<p>She stared down a newsboy who was looking at Magnus and his burden with unusual interest, and led the baronet over to the cab. Carstairs reached down from his seat to flip open the door, his expression changing not a jot at the transformation of Magnus from the elegant gentleman of an hour before to a semi-naked tramp with traces of vomit around his mouth making his wispy beard even more horrible than before.</p>
<p>Susan got straight in with a sigh of relief, but Magnus paused on the step to give directions.</p>
<p>“Hyde Park, Carstairs! We have something we need to throw in the Serpentine.”</p>
<p>“The Thames is closer,” said Susan as Magnus passed her the sacking-clad Excalibur. He climbed in and shut the door.</p>
<p>“Yes,” replied Magnus. “But I don’t think a river would do. It really has to be a lake.”</p>
<p>He knocked on the ceiling, and they heard Carstairs whistle. The cab began to rumble and sway as it moved away. Susan put her bag up next to her on the seat, and rummaged inside, replacing the screw of paper in her brooch, making a production of it so her face was turned away while Magnus wiped his face and put on the simple, spare underclothes, trousers and shirt that were kept for him in the cab. He didn’t bother with stockings or shoes, since soon enough he would be chained up in his cell again.</p>
<p>They drove on in silence, surrounded by all the noises of the modern city, until Magnus cleared his throat and spoke, his voice harsh and sudden.</p>
<p>“Where do you keep the yellow pill, Susan?”</p>
<p>Susan started and looked out the window, eyes blinking away sudden tears.</p>
<p>“I do know about it,” said Magnus apologetically. “Both Mycroft and Sherlock told me. Mycroft knew, of course, and Sherlock deduced its existence—its purpose, if not its colour. They thought I should be told, though evidently Dadd does not.”</p>
<p>Susan tapped a button, outwardly of jet, upon her sleeve.</p>
<p>“Here,” she said. “But it is truly a last resort, Magnus. You are so much better! I’m sure in a few months—”</p>
<p>“But when the curse is dissipated, who shall be fed blue pills to fight against the enemies of England?” asked Magnus. He touched the wrapped Excalibur upon his lap. “Magic swords being somewhat out of fashion.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” whispered Susan, taking his hands. “Magnus, I do not know. But it will not be you. No more blue pills soon, and never the yellow. Never that.”</p>
<p>“Unless it proves necessary,” said Magnus bleakly. “Perhaps I might even choose to take it myself.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Susan, very sternly. “Stop talking nonsense. Tell me. Will we actually see the Lady of the Lake?”</p>
<p>Magnus smiled, a smile that did not banish the sadness in his eyes.</p>
<p>“We might see her arm,” he said. “That’ll scare the swimmers . . .”</p>

<h3 id="new-york-today-a-little-history-of-christmas">&ldquo;New York Today: A Little History of Christmas&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/18/nyregion/18NYTODAY/18NYTODAY-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
Updated at 10:15 a.m.</p>
<p>Good morning on this breezy Friday.</p>
<p>New York can’t quite take credit for Christmas, but apparently, several seemingly timeless holiday traditions were invented here.</p>
<p>In large part, we can thank New York’s own Washington Irving.</p>
<p>Upset that there were few real, unifying holidays in early America, Irving decided to give his compatriots a little push, with help from both English and Dutch traditions.</p>
<p>In his 1809 “A History of New York” (a comic recounting of the Dutch era), he declared the European gift-giver St. Nicholas to be the state’s patron saint, claiming that his image appeared on the masthead of the first Dutch ship to arrive in New York.</p>
<p>Clement Clarke Moore, whose family owned the neighborhood of Chelsea, took up the cause, too.</p>
<p>He claimed to have written a poem for his daughters, “An Account of a Visit from St. Nicholas,” in which he described the saint as “a right jolly old elf,” based on “a portly rubicund Dutchman,” in the neighborhood, with some other elements borrowed from Irving’s St. Nicholas.

<h3 id="the-semiotics-of-rose-gold">&ldquo;The Semiotics of “Rose Gold”&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59097074019dfc3494ea20fd/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Mead-RoseGold.jpg" alt="img">
The announcement, last week, that, with its new generation of iPhones, Apple would be offering a model that was “rose gold” in color made the news that it was meant to: “The internet has lost its damn mind about the new pink iPhone,” Buzzfeed’s headline read. The phone, with its rubicund sheen, was instantly coveted. “I don’t care at all about whatever they are talking about. gimmie the pink phone,” Roxane Gay, the feminist author, tweeted. In other quarters, the color was met with a sense of mystification. Christina Warren, writing at Mashable, wondered whether Apple had opted for the appellation of “rose gold” as a way to avoid using the overtly girly “P” word. “I’m just going to say it: it’s pink,” she wrote.</p>
<p>When employed by jewelers, rather than by extremely savvy marketers of digital devices, the term “rose gold” refers to an alloy of gold to which copper has been added. In appearance, rose gold is warm and flush—what yellow gold would look like if it suddenly suffered an embarrassment. The phone may be new, but rose gold has been around for a while. (Apple itself used rose gold earlier this year, for one of its new watches.) Eighteenth-century jewelers used it in quatre-couleur gold, which consisted of greenish, whitish, and pinkish iterations of the element from which decorative inlays were fashioned.</p>
<p>Since then, the popularity of rose gold has waxed and waned. Most recently, fine jewelers, including Piaget and Van Cleef &amp; Arpels, have revived it. Rose gold “is more discreet than yellow or white gold, brings warmth to the creation and marries well with colored stones,” Claire Choisne, the designer for the French jewelry house Boucheron, told Suzy Menkes, of the International Herald Tribune, in an article, from 2012, which noted the color’s increasing popularity.</p>
<p>Flattering to most skin tones—a youthful-seeming blush is highlighted, or perhaps induced, by rose gold—the shade has spread to fashion, accessories, and beauty. This follows an earlier enthusiasm for other metallics: silver, gold, bronze. Diane von Furstenberg offers a rose-gold, crocodile-embossed clutch bag. Alexander Wang has made a rose-gold satchel. For two thousand dollars, you can get a floor-length, fishtail version of Herve Leger’s iconic bandage dress in rose gold, or for twenty-five thousand dollars, from Tiffany, a rose-gold “bone” cuff designed by Elsa Peretti. Birkenstock makes a rose-gold version of its classic Arizona sandal. You can get rose-gold-tinted sunglasses from Michael Kors, rose-gold-colored lip gloss from Wet n Wild, and, if you carefully follow a D.I.Y. tutorial on YouTube, rose-gold colored hair. If you’re getting married, you can have not only a rose-gold wedding ring, but also rose-gold-colored place settings, with napkins, candlesticks, and vases fabricated in the color formerly known as salmon.</p>
<p>Valuable, rare, durable, and impervious to tarnish, gold has always lent itself easily to metaphor. The Ancient Greeks conceived of a primordial prosperity as a golden age. The golden ratio is a mathematical formula of pleasing harmony. We give the name of the Golden Rule to a fundamental ethical precept—treat others as you would have others treat you—common to many systems of belief. Gold has also been the marker and the preserve of the wealthy: throughout history, sumptuary laws have expressly regulated the wearing of gold jewelry and the use of gold thread. Apple first started selling gold-colored iPhones two years ago, in what the company has acknowledged was an attempt—so far successful—to appeal to the burgeoning Chinese market, where gold is a particularly meaningful signifier.</p>
<p>Rose gold, however, has quite a different symbolic valence. Deliberately adulterated, it is gold that has an inclination to be something else. Rose gold is perverse. Unlike yellow gold—but like its cooler cousin, white gold, which is an alloy with nickel or manganese that has also risen and declined in popularity throughout the years—rose gold is subject to the vagaries of fashion. The desire it stimulates is inherently temporary. In rose gold, a substance of enduring value is transformed into a consumer item with the half-life of all things modish. Rose gold is decadent. It is gold for people who already have enough gold gold.</p>
<p>This was true during the last golden age of rose gold, which fell around the beginning of the twentieth century, in Imperial Russia. Carl Fabergé, jeweler to the Czars, put rose gold to spectacular use in many of his most ornate decorative eggs, including the celebrated “Moscow Kremlin” egg—a gold-and-white enamel egg set into a replica of the fifteenth-century Spasskaya Tower, overlooking Red Square. Commissioned by Nicholas II as a gift for his wife, the Empress Alexandra, the egg cost 11,800 rubles—Fabergé’s most expensive commission among many costly ones.</p>
<p>The “Moscow Kremlin” egg commemorated the royal couple’s return to the city, which they had avoided in the aftermath of a riot during the Czar’s coronation, in 1896, when more than a thousand Muscovites were trampled to death. By the time the egg was installed at the Alexander Palace, in 1906, there were stirrings of revolt in the country. Less than a dozen years later, the imperial family would be toppled in the Russian Revolution. The egg was handled with greater care, and it is now on display at the Kremlin Armory Museum.</p>
<p>Rose gold is not always the inevitable elemental precursor to populist revolution. But the burnished, blushing prevalence of the metal can certainly be understood to have cautionary indications for our current moment. It’s a time marked by overheated, precarious global economies; injudicious, unsustainable disparities of wealth; and a metastatic consumer culture, in which a technology company can make fifty billion dollars in a fiscal quarter, largely on the strength of persuading people who already have a phone—that company’s phone—that they need to buy a slightly different version. As Apple knows better than anyone, we live in a rose-gilded age.
