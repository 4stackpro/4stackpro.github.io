隨著網際網路打開虛擬通路的任督二脈後，店家省去了實體店面的大量人力與資金成本，從過去流行的奇摩拍賣，到架設購物平台，現在更夯的是透過社群進行銷售。今年度程澈科技攜手鼎新ERP，結合BUY+1社群整單系統與A1雲端進銷存系統，獨家整合兩種不同功能的服務，實現社群銷售同步後端ERP系統的可能，不僅讓經營社群銷售的店家更方便管理訂單與庫存，也為ERP系統之既有客戶開啟社群經營的大門。</p>
<p>BUY+1社群整單系統結合鼎新A1雲端進銷存系統，實現社群銷售同步後端ERP的可能。程澈科技／提供 facebook 這項業界創新的合作結盟，來自真實市場的需求與反饋。程澈科技的BUY+1系統是協助店家進行臉書或LINE銷售的後台整單利器，5年來陪伴大小店家走過品牌草創到穩健經營的歷程，隨著BUY+1客戶的規模越加龐大，開始有了ERP進銷存的需求；而鼎新A1的客戶也紛紛詢問，若是透過社群銷售，是否仍得藉由人員手動統計訂單或輸入進銷存？雙方客戶都有社群訂單與ERP進銷存的需求，加上皆是SaaS系統，兩者一拍即合，迅速有了合作共識。</p>
<p>推薦</p>
<p>程澈科技執行長古偉君提到：「這是兩套不同的產品，進銷存本身並沒有社群訂單管理的概念，而社群訂單管理系統並沒有庫存的功能，因此在流程的整合上需要更多時間討論。」一方面須考量兩系統資料欄位的差異，另一方面則須顧慮使用者操作上的便利性，在雙方反覆討論與操作流程後，終於將兩套系統順利完成串接。</p>
<p>以流程的角度出發，店家須先註冊鼎新ERP與BUY+1系統，接著到鼎新ERP後台新增商品與庫存，再進入BUY+1系統，將鼎新ERP的商品資料匯入BUY+1，即可發布銷售貼文到FB社團、LINE@與LINE群組，客人留言+1之後，BUY+1會將留言整合並轉化成訂單，即自動回送到鼎新ERP訂單管理系統，便完成社群下單串接進銷存系統的流程，大幅提高社群銷售之經營效率，省下一半以上的人力，成功為產業帶來助益。</p>
<p>流程上鼎新A1系統處理商品新增以及訂單操作，BUY+1負責臉書的串接以及訂單的轉換。程澈科技／提供 facebook 促成這樁異業結盟除了須雙方的技術支援外，彼此既有客戶群的共通性質也是成功合作的關鍵，BUY+1與鼎新A1之客群以中小型企業居多，且都擁有願意嘗試新技術的特質，此項跨領域的合作，也為雙方客群注入新思維，並帶領企業跳脫舊框架。</p>
<p>古偉君提到，BUY+1的客群本身就熟悉社群操作，而他們理解企業規模越大時，BUY+1與鼎新A1結合的系統，能以高CP值解決他們的貨品管理痛點，在既有的社群整單系統之外，亦同時擁有負擔得起的進銷存系統，即可無後顧之憂地繼續發展更多實體店面或跨平台銷售；而對於鼎新A1客群，包括實體店面或生產工廠來說，讓他們了解除了既有通路外，臉書或LINE銷售也能創造營業額的正成長，便開始探索社群經營的可能性。</p>
<p>除了實體通路外，BUY+1與鼎新A1系統的整合服務，使臉書或LINE銷售更有效率地創造營業額成長。程澈科技／提供 facebook 商品項目與數量龐大的產業，舉凡服飾、雜貨等民生用品等B2C模式之中小型企業，都是兩個系統整合下的準客群，古偉君指出，此次的異業結盟保守估計將有上千家企業受益，他也提到，未來程澈科技仍會以「讓客戶在更多地方賣東西」為目標，持續往提高客戶營業額的方向邁進，在協助創造客戶營收的過程中，也重新看見自己的價值。</p>

<h3 id="goldilocks-and-the-6-or-7-sap-erp-systems">Goldilocks and the 6 (or 7) SAP ERP Systems</h3>
<p><img src="https://diginomica.com/sites/default/files/images/2013-07/SAP-walldorf-e1511706566785.jpg" alt="img">
SAP is credited with inventing ERP in the late 70’s and early 80’s. Roll forward 30 years and it seems they like ERP so much they now have six different ERP product offerings. Some of them sound like the same product but as you will find they all offer slightly different things and are tuned to specific niches within the ERP market.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the six offerings are:</p>
<p>SAP S/4HANA in 4 flavours SAP S/4HANA On Premise SAP S.4HANA Private Cloud SAP S/4HANA Cloud extended edition (was called Single Tenant Edition) SAP S/4HANA Cloud essentials edition (was called Multi Tenant Edition)</p>
<p>SAP Business ByDesign</p>
<p>SAP Business One</p>
<p>This number increases to seven if you already purchased the previous version of on premise ERP from SAP (aka SAP Business Suite / SAP ERP / mySAP.com / R/3) as you can keep running that until 2030.</p>
<p>Why so many ERP choices?</p>
<p>Why does the company that invented ERP need so many ERP systems? It&rsquo;s a good question and one that needs to be answered with a bit of history and a bit of tea leaf reading.</p>
<p>It is important to select the one ERP that is right for you as you should enjoy faster implementation times, a lower cost of ownership and better business outcomes. Select poorly and the opposite could be true - extended implementations, high cost of ownership and impaired business outcomes. So as you make your way into SAP ERP or consider a transition from classic SAP Business Suite to your chosen flavor, make sure you select wisely as ERP is for life not just for Christmas.</p>
<p>The naming conventions didn’t get this way by design. SAP has evolved to this position and I believe that understanding this evolution is key to making the right decision when selecting a new ERP system or evolving your current SAP Business Suite ERP system.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows how the various offering have evolved from the early days of the mainframe based SAP R/2 to the present day line up. For completeness, SAP had a product called R/1 which I haven’t shown.</p>
<p>SAP ERP naming history (via the author)</p>
<p>Three things to note</p>
<p>The first thing to note is that most of the offerings have been developed by SAP in house, whereas many other ERP vendors have acquired many ERPs. The only acquired product is SAP Business One which was bought from the Israeli company TopManage FinancialSystems in 2002 when SAP wanted to get into the Small Medium Enterprise (SME) market and had nothing in-house to offer at that point.</p>
<p>The second is that the current S/4HANA “family” has evolved from the mainframe R/2 product which is important to know when you are considering the functional depth and technical complexity of the various offerings. One way to view the IP inside S/4HANA is to consider that at the core, SAP&rsquo;s ERP has been maturing for 40 plus years.</p>
<p>Third, only one product was built from the ground up as a Software as a Service (SaaS) offering and that&rsquo;s SAP Business By Design. All of the others are either on-premise offerings or on-premise software that has been adapted for one or more cloud delivery.</p>
<p>Which leads me to the Goldilocks title of this blog and the dilemma that I see customers face when trying to select a product from this portfolio.</p>
<p>Some are too big</p>
<p>Some are too small</p>
<p>Some are too complex</p>
<p>Some are not complex enough</p>
<p>Some are not cloudy enough</p>
<p>Some are too cloudy</p>
<p>And of course one may just be right.</p>
<p>Trying to find the right one (or ones for large enterprise) is a headache many CIOs can’t face so they are putting off the decision and continuing to run SAP Business Suite if they are existing SAP customers.</p>
<p>SAP just made this easier for CIOs by extending support to 2030 for SAP Business Suite. This is creating a headache for SAP as they want everyone to move to the new ERP line up so they can show growth and deliver to shareholders expectations. Quite how that plays today is another matter but you can confidently expect that at least 30% of those who are on the road to S/4 but not yet made a decision just kicked that apricular can down the road.</p>
<p>What should CIOs do?</p>
<p>While staying where you are might be the right decision you could miss opportunities to make your organization more competitive and/or provide your existing ERP services at a reduced cost — or both.</p>
<p>Despite current uncertainty, I believe that all CIOs should be making the &lsquo;What&rsquo;s next for ERP&rsquo; decision a key one for 2020, so that they can plan the eventual transition in a timely way and also make informed decisions about investments in their pre-transition landscape.</p>
<p>Making the right selection involves many moving parts. Below I provide my 20,000 foot view on which one could be right for you. Each is listed in order of the functional coverage, technical flexibility and implementation complexity they represent, based on my long experience with SAP systems.</p>
<p>Product Best Fit Cloud / On Premise SAP S/4HANA On Premise This offering has the broadest range in terms of scope and technical flexibility — you can write your own code, deploy to hardware you own and configure the solution to your exact requirements. Basically if you currently run SAP Business Suite On Premise then On Premise S/4HANA will feel reassuringly similar. If you want you can convert your existing SAP Business Suite to this version. On Premise software that can be deployed to Cloud providers with many providing out of the box hardware images for this purpose. SAP S/4HANA Private Cloud The same software as the On Premise version above but run by SAP on SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud (HEC). This takes away some of the technical decisions but still provides access to all of the rich functionality and flexible modification options. Various options are available for Application Management Services (AMS) - from monitoring/patching/upgrades to full application management. If you want you can convert your existing SAP Business Suite to this version. On Premise software deployed to SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud with SAP Application Management Services SAP S/4HANA Cloud extended edition Same software as the On Premise version but you have to start with a clean system and SAP encourage you to configure this using Best Practice scope items using the Activate methodology. As these Best Practices don’t cover all of the On Premise functional scope where you find gaps you can dip into the On Premise capabilities and you can write modifications in the system (like you would with the On Premise version). You get a packaged Application Management Services (AMS) bundle that covers an upgrade twice per year. On Premise software that is managed by SAP and the customer to create “Cloud-like” experience SAP S/4HANA Cloud essentials edition Cut from the same code base as the On Premise version but delivered as Software as a Service. You have to implement using Best Practice Scope Items and you can’t modify the code base (although you can still add programmatic logic and data objects/fields to the system). Any major additional functionality would be created side-by-side using APIs to call / or be called from/to S/4HANA. SAP provide SAP Cloud Platform for this extension purpose — but you can use others. This offers faster and more predictable implementation times but for those used to either on premise SAP ERP or SAP S/4HANA the scope in terms of functionality, industries and countries is more limited. Software as a Service which has evolved from an On Premise code base SAP Business By Design This product was developed by SAP in the 2000’s and I believe was supposed to be the replacement for SAP Business Suite but SAP struggled with adoption in larger enterprises so it was repositioned for the SME market once S/4HANA was born. Built for cloud it offers a fully integrated ERP scope that goes beyond that offered by S/4HANA — covering HR/CRM for example. It is configured using built-in scoping selection tool and you can’t modify the code base. Some larger organizations have this as their 2nd tier ERP system for smaller countries as SAP provide pre-package integration to S/4HANA. Software as a Service built from the ground up by SAP SAP Business One This is the only acquired product from SAP but that was nearly 20 years ago so we can now call this an SAP product. Available On Premise or Hosted (cloud) it offers a good breadth of ERP features and has a happy user base. Perhaps offers a solution for the second or third tier of a large enterprise ERP strategy. On Premise software that is offered as a managed service in the cloud</p>
<p>None of this comes without problem for the entire SAP ecosystem.</p>
<p>For SAP this is a massive code base (and associated technical debt) to manage / evolve where it is really really hard to create a consistent marketing and sales message. Could this be simplified? Architecturally, you&rsquo;re looking at a 10 year project that doesn&rsquo;t have a high expectation of success.</p>
<p>For SAP customers / SAP prospective customers this is a baffling array of different options with ta high risk of making the wrong call, especially if you don&rsquo;t have a firm grasp of the nuances involved.</p>
<p>For SAP partners, keeping up with and holding all the skills required to correctly advise clients and do a great job of implementing is nigh on impossible. Thinking about S/4HANA for example, we know of instances where third party developers are waiting to get a better deal from SAP and/or better line of sight into customer uptake before refactoring functionality built for ECC.</p>
<p>While I think choice is a great thing, trying to explain the above to anyone who hasn’t been in the SAP world for 20 years get kind of awkward — come on SAP, please step back from this and make it easier for customers to understand what you have — you never know it might improve sales !!

<h3 id="northscope-erp-adds-banking-transactions-to-its-suite-of-features-for-food-manufacturers">Northscope ERP Adds Banking Transactions to Its Suite of Features for Food Manufacturers</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gLngL4O0iNE2g8ZR8V.vzg--~B/aD0xNjt3PTE2O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/prnewswire.com/41266d73cf77e3f8e47c0475cbe0ca30" alt="img">
REDMOND, Wash., March 31, 2020 /PRNewswire/ &ndash; Throughout the first quarter of 2020, NorthScope ERP upgraded its financial features for its food manufacturing users. While its entire list of new features from Q1 expands beyond financial, the biggest upgrades were to NorthScope&rsquo;s banking functionality, including checkbook transactions, reconciliations and foreign currency support.</p>
<p>The new checkbook transactions include adjustments, deposits and transfers. Respectively, these transactions allow NorthScope users to record miscellaneous increases or decreases in the checkbook balance, such as bank interest, to record deposits to the checkbook, and to move funds from one checkbook to another. Similarly, the newly added checkbook reconciliation allows users to add, edit and/or delete reconciliations based on the transactions that have cleared the bank. Finally, the new support for foreign currencies allows users to calculate transactions in foreign currencies to and from their home currency using exchange rate tables.</p>
<p>Of the new banking features, NorthScope Development Manager Jacob Swanson said, &ldquo;Adding banking functionality to NorthScope was a large investment in time and resources. However, adding features to make our users&rsquo; lives easier is well worth the effort. You no longer have to manage bank balances in an outside program and can do it all within NorthScope where you do everything else anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to NorthScope&rsquo;s support for banking becoming more robust in Q1, the entirety of its ERP solution for Food Manufacturers also includes other General Ledger, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, Inventory Management, Brokerage, Rebates &amp; Promotions, Sales Management, Fisherman Accounting and Grower Accounting features.</p>
<p>About NorthScope: NorthScope is ERP software for food manufacturers created by the Northlake Partners (NLP) to specifically support the Alaska Seafood, Fruit and Vegetable, Aquaculture, and Primary Food Processing industries. Since 2008, NLP has been providing ERP software and step-by-step guidance for food manufacturers, giving them the tools to build the business they&rsquo;ve always wanted.</p>
