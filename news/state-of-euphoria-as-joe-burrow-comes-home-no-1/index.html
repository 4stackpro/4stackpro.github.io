They were supposed to be in Las Vegas Thursday night, but it felt like they should have been right there since this will always be remembered as the draft of the Area Code T-Shirt. Joe Burrow wore a simple white one with the southeastern Ohio digits of 740 enclosed in an outline of the state of Ohio. Jimmy Burrow could sense this was more than a big night, but a historic one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did mean more,&rdquo; Jimmy Burrow said about this draft. &ldquo;For the NFL to stick with this, it&rsquo;s a credit to them. It&rsquo;s a big moment for a lot of different people. It&rsquo;s an outlet for sports fans across the nation to get their mind off it. We&rsquo;ll never forgot how hard the times are, but we&rsquo;ll remember how everybody embraces pro football.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His son&rsquo;s feelings for his hometown were made quite clear when he picked up his Heisman Trophy last December. The city&rsquo;s mayor, Steve Patterson, recalled the part of his speech that meant everything to Athens County took just 32 seconds to say. Grown men and women living in the 740 area code called each other to weep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming from southeast Ohio it&rsquo;s a very impoverished area and the poverty rate is almost two times the national average,&rdquo; Burrow said that night in New York. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s so many people there that don&rsquo;t have a lot and I&rsquo;m up here for all those kids in Athens and Athens County that go home to not a lot of food on the table, hungry after school. You guys can be up here, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those words spawned Facebook donations of half a million dollars to the local food pantry and you have to feel like Burrow is going to be talking about more plans like that judging by what he said Thursday night as the Heisman looked over his shoulder while explaining how the shirt came to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was mine,&rdquo; Joe Burrow said of the idea. &quot; I signed with Nike and they made some great custom stuff for me, and this was something I kind of wanted to represent, and we have some more things in the works the next couple weeks as far as foundations go that I&rsquo;m very excited about to help my hometown.&rdquo;

<h3 id="joe-burrows-diamond-nfl-draft-necklace-was-a-gift-from-baton-rouge-rapper-boosie-badazz">Joe Burrow&rsquo;s diamond NFL Draft necklace was &lsquo;a gift&rsquo; from Baton Rouge rapper Boosie Badazz</h3>
<p><img src="https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/f8/1f808cd8-85d4-11ea-b7ce-fbf15ef0901f/5ea250d00ec19.image.jpg?resize=679%2C378" alt="img">
It nearly went unnoticed, but Joe Burrow was representing both Athens County, Ohio and Baton Rouge with his 2020 NFL Draft outfit on Thursday.</p>
<p>The homage to Athens County, his hometown, was front and center thanks to the &ldquo;740&rdquo; area code t-shirt he wore from Nike. His nod to Baton Rouge, however, was a little more subtle — a diamond-encrusted No. 9 chain necklace sitting on his chest just above the outline of the state of Ohio on his shirt.</p>
<p>The number not only represented his jersey number at LSU, but also has ties to a prolific figure in Baton Rouge: rapper Boosie Badazz.</p>
<p>The necklace was gifted to the Cincinnati Bengals&rsquo; new quarterback from Boosie, Burrow said in a post-draft media call. When asked when he accepted it, Burrow grinned before assuring media that it happened &ldquo;after the last game,&rdquo; referencing the Tigers&rsquo; national championship win over Clemson at New Orleans&rsquo; Mercedes-Benz Superdome in January.</p>

<p>Boosie previously posted a picture of the necklace he gifted Burrow on his Instagram account with the hashtag &ldquo;#champions&rdquo; on Feb. 1.</p>

<p>Boosie has been a loyal fan to Tigers, and Burrow specifically, throughout their national championship season, often posting videos online celebrating wins and hyping Burrow up before, during and after games. Boosie even posted a screenshot of a video call he had with Burrow following the championship win, as well as a signed LSU jersey he received from him.</p>
<p>Burrow has reciprocated the love on several occasions as well. After the Tigers beat Alabama for the first time since 2011 in November, a video went viral of him dancing to Boosie&rsquo;s &ldquo;Loose as a Goose&rdquo; in the locker room. His Heisman Trophy hype reel was also soundtracked by Boosie&rsquo;s &ldquo;Set It Off.&rdquo;

<h3 id="tiger-king-bengals-select-joe-burrow-with-no-1-pick-in-virtual-nfl-draft">Tiger king: Bengals select Joe Burrow with No 1 pick in &lsquo;virtual&rsquo; NFL draft</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0455a5212d9ce83745e5a0698af45b1db99065d6/0_0_1526_915/master/1526.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=d0dee4eb2ac9687f17e76defe7ae0164" alt="img">
For all the uniqueness of this NFL draft, including the angst over a potential communications fiasco, things looked and sounded pretty normal Thursday night.</p>
<p>Quarterbacks were in demand. Ohio State and the Southeastern Conference dominated. The Patriots traded out of the first round. And commissioner Roger Goodell even got booed, if only digitally.</p>
<p>NFL draft 2020: Cincinnati Bengals take Joe Burrow with No 1 pick in virtual event – live! Read more</p>
<p>“I do believe this draft is going to be the most memorable we have ever had,” said Goodell, noting that it is accompanied by a ‘Draft-A-Thon’ to benefit six organizations on the front lines battling the coronavirus pandemic, which is what forced the NFL to cancel all in-person draft events.</p>
<p>The first round wasn’t all that remarkable for the picks. Beginning with Joe Burrow of national champion LSU, three quarterbacks went in the top six. Hardly unusual.</p>
<p>For months, the Heisman Trophy winner from LSU was linked with the Bengals. Cincinnati began the draft by sending his name to Goodell in the basement of his home.</p>
<p>This digital/remote/virtual draft – take your choice – was up and running. With no apparent glitches.</p>
<p>Of course, there were no fireworks on the Las Vegas strip. No bear hug between Goodell and Burrow; the commissioner said he would miss those, even if his body wouldn’t. This most basic selection show had team personnel making picks from their homes and players sitting on their own couches while learning their future employers.</p>
<p>The NFL canceled all draft activities in Las Vegas when the national shutdown of large gatherings began. The league had gone full-bore into free agency last month and, now, seven rounds of the draft through Saturday.</p>

<p>“I just believe that our job is to continue on and operate within whatever guidelines are necessary to keep our personnel safe, whether it’s players or coaches or their executives or league personnel,” Goodell said. “We need to make sure that we’re doing things safely and put public safety No 1, but we also need to carry on. We need to move toward the future. We need to make sure that we’re prepared when we come out of this to be in a position to start our season on time and play our season. That’s our role.”</p>
<p>Normalcy, at least among the picks, was the order of the evening, though.</p>
<p>First came Burrow: In his spectacular senior season, he threw for 60 – yes, 60 – touchdowns with only six interceptions. The Tigers beat six top 10 teams on their way to the national title.</p>
<p>“To jump up to No 1 overall is crazy to me,” Burrow said.</p>
<p>Joe Burrow: from back-up quarterback to likely NFL No 1 overall pick Read more</p>
<p>He joins a team that went 2-14 last season and desperately needs a jolt of energy.</p>
<p>“If you go in thinking, ‘Oh, this is the year we’re going to make the playoffs, this year we’re going to win a playoff game,’ it gets too daunting,” Burrow said. “You’ve got to focus on the process.”</p>
<p>Bengals coach Zac Taylor was confident Burrow could turn the franchise around.</p>
<p>“We will never pick at No 1 again,” Taylor said. “We don’t want to pick in the top 10 again. We’re looking at this as the only time you’re going to get this caliber player to add him to the program, so obviously this is a big deal.”</p>
<p>The second overall selection, Ohio State All-America edge rusher Chase Young, also was predictable. Washington fielded several offers for that spot, but many scouts and personnel executives felt Young was the best player in this crop.</p>
<p>At 6ft 5in, 264 lbs, Young led the nation with 16 and a half sacks and forced fumbles with six last season. The All-American won the prestigious Bednarik and Nagurski awards in 2019, leading the Buckeyes to the Big Ten title.</p>
<p>He joins a Washington team that went 3-13 and allowed 435 points.</p>
<p>If not for the NFL’s obsession with finding the latest, greatest quarterback prospect, Young might have been the top overall selection. That QB infatuation led Miami to Tua Tagovailoa and the Los Angeles Chargers to Justin Herbert – no surprises there. But Green Bay took a chance at No 26 by taking Utah State QB Jordan Love.</p>
<p>Alabama’s Tagovailoa went fifth, followed in the next spot by Oregon’s Herbert. They were preceded by Ohio State’s Jeff Okudah, the highest-rated cornerback, to Detroit, and Georgia tackle Andrew Thomas to the Giants.</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tua Tagovailoa during the draft. Photograph: AP</p>
<p>Tagovailoa’s health issues didn’t turn off the Dolphins.</p>
<p>The Alabama quarterback went to a team that was accused going into last season of “Tanking for Tua.” Tagovailoa comes off major hip surgery, which made his landing spot one of the first round’s biggest uncertainties.</p>
<p>“For me and my family, whoever decided to take a chance on us, that’s where I belonged,” Tagovailoa said. “My biggest thing is I’m trying to prove this was the right decision.”</p>
<p>One change he’ll need to make in Miami: No 13 is not available. The Dolphins retired it for Hall of Famer Dan Marino.</p>
<p>“I understand No 13 is retired, and it should be,” Tagovailoa said. “Whatever number I’m given by the organization, if it’s 78 or 99, I’ll wear it.”</p>
<p>Blessed with a quick release, excellent mid-range accuracy and nimble feet, Tagovailoa threw 76 touchdown passes in 24 starts the past two seasons. He helped the Crimson to the 2017 national title.</p>
<p>Herbert had a strong postseason, including a terrific Senior Bowl week that raised his stock. At 6ft 6in, 236lbs, he has the size the pros like, and he’s a good athlete. But he also is not as accurate passing as he’ll need to be.</p>
<p>Los Angeles had a burning hole at quarterback after letting go of longtime starter Philip Rivers. Plus, the Chargers plan to move into a new stadium and could use someone to help sell tickets.</p>
<p>It took until the 13th spot before a trade was made: Tompa, oops, Tampa Bay moving up one spot to get tackle Tristan Wirfs of Iowa to help protect new/old QB Tom Brady. The Buccaneers got that pick from NFC champion San Francisco.</p>
<p>Wide receiver is the deepest position in this draft, but it took until the 12th selection for one to go. Alabama’s Henry Ruggs III, perhaps the fastest man in this group (4.27 in the 40), was the first-ever draftee by the Las Vegas Raiders. Coach Jon Gruden loves speed, and he got a burner who scored 24 touchdowns among 98 career receptions.</p>
<p>New England, which will go into a season without Brady for the first time since 1999, sent its 23rd overall spot to the Chargers, adding a second- and third-rounder. The Chargers were eager to bolster their defense with Oklahoma linebacker Kenneth Murray.</p>
<p>The Packers, despite needs at receiver, offensive line and linebacker, traded up from No 30 to 26th and selected for the future with Love. Aaron Rodgers, of course, sat for a few years in Green Bay behind Brett Favre. Love might do the same behind A-Rod.
