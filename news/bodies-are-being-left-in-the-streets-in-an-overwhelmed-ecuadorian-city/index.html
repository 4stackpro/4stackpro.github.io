(CNN) The streets of Ecuador&rsquo;s western city of Guayaquil are deserted, with few residents in sight &ndash; and a few dead, as bodies are being left in the streets of this overwhelmed place.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic is overloading the public services in the country&rsquo;s most populous city to a point of collapse. Hospitals have no beds left to accept sick patients, and morgues, cemeteries and funeral homes are straining. With no place left to put them, some residents say they have no choice but placing them outside.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear how many of the deceased are dying because of Covid-19. Many families say their loved ones had symptoms of the virus, while others only know the ill were unable to be treated at Guayaquil&rsquo;s overwhelmed hospitals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have been waiting for five days,&rdquo; Fernando Espana said in a video obtained by Reuters on March 30, as he complained about the struggles to have authorities come pick up his family member.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are tired of calling 911 and the only thing they tell us is to wait, they are working to solve this,&rdquo; he continues as he moves the camera through a window to show a black plastic-wrapped shape inside the home, with two fans blowing on it.</p>
<p>A coffin containing the body of a person who is supposed to have died from Covid-19 lays wrapped in plastic and covered with cardboard, outside a block of family apartments in Guayaquil on April 2.</p>
<p>The smell is too much to take. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the odor from the body that one can no longer handle,&rdquo; Espana&rsquo;s neighbor, Glenda Larrea Vera says in the same video, from across the street and behind a mask. &ldquo;And we also have neighbors that are elderly. I have my mother who is 80 who is also having respiratory problems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Video surveillance from last week obtained by CNN shows a motorcyclist abandon a body in the street. Hours later, a group of people, dressed in special hazmat suits are seen picking up the deceased, then driving off in a vehicle.</p>
<p>In another video obtained by CNN, a group of people remove a body from a car. Covered in face masks, they wrap the body in a what appears to be a black tarp when a police vehicle approaches minutes later. A conversation takes place and the group puts the body back into the car. Police tell CNN they could not offer details about the video.</p>
<p>National figures show that Ecuador&rsquo;s authorities have collected more than 300 bodies from private homes in the city &ndash; which has 2.99 million residents, according to the CIA Factbook &ndash; between March 23-30.</p>
<p>The city is on the Guayas River and is the nation&rsquo;s major port. Brittanica.com calls it the country&rsquo;s most economically important city.</p>
<p>Jorge Wated, head of a joint military task force created to deal with Ecuador&rsquo;s coronavirus crisis, in a televised interview on Wednesday said that his task force had gone from &ldquo;taking away 30 deceased per day to 150&rdquo; over the past three days. Wated added that this was &ldquo;independent of the hard work reactivated by the private funeral homes and graveyards in the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Men with protective suits load a coffin into a car in front of a Guayaquil hospital.</p>
<p>Guayaquil&rsquo;s mayor Cynthia Viteri has desperately begged for help from the national government in a video posted to her Twitter account last week. &ldquo;What is happening in the country&rsquo;s public health system? They are not taking away the dead from houses, they&rsquo;re leaving them on the sidewalks, they&rsquo;re falling in front of hospitals. No one wants to pick them up,&rdquo; she said, adding later, &ldquo;we need to know the causes of why people are dying in their homes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happens with our sick too?&rdquo; she adds. &ldquo;The families roam throughout the city knocking on doors so they can be taken care of or that a public hospital receives them where there are no more beds and they close the door and leave them outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With hospitals beyond capacity, some people are dying as they wait for medical care. One Guayaquil woman died in a wheelchair at a hospital while waiting to be seen in an emergency room. According to a hospital source who asked not to be identified, there were no beds available and her body was left out for almost four hours before it was taken away. The cause of death has not been determined.</p>
<p>As of Friday, Ecuador&rsquo;s National Service of Risk and Emergency Management Department reports 3,368 confirmed coronavirus cases and 145 fatalities nationwide, of which 102 are registered deaths in Guayas province, where Guayaquil is located. But some citizens are concerned that confirmed positive cases of infection are higher than what is being reported by the Ecuadorian government, and they are demanding action, something happening in other countries too as delays and lack of testing cause frustrations.</p>
<p>Relatives wait outside of a hospital for information on family members infected with Covid-19 in Guayaquil on April 1.</p>
<p>President Lenin Moreno during an address to the nation Thursday called for transparency at all levels of government regarding the numbers caused by the crisis. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to tell the truth,&rdquo; Moreno said, adding that in &ldquo;both the number of cases and deaths, the records fall short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wated, the task force chief, has said that experts expect between 2,500 and 3,500 deaths in the coming months in Guayas alone.</p>
<p>Several containers have arrived in Guayaquil to serve as temporary morgues to accommodate the influx of bodies, and authorities say they plan to create space for &ldquo;dignified burials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But for now, some of the living in Guayaquil remain trapped in a nightmare, with no way to mourn their loved ones, not even through a proper burial.

CLOSE</p>

<p>There are people who lead lives that don&rsquo;t follow the usual paths. It would, therefore, probably make sense that those people would have unusual experiences during a pandemic.</p>
<p>Jasmine Poole is one of those people. You may have seen her on stage at a Northern Kentucky bar performing as Wonky Tonk with all the Americana charm of Dolly Parton, if Dolly Parton was also really into experimental punk music.</p>
<p>So Poole isn&rsquo;t working from her home office or binging on &ldquo;Tiger King.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s riding out the novel coronavirus at a Tantric yoga school in Quito, Ecuador. By choice, but also because there&rsquo;s no way for her to get home.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all stretching and quiet meditation. This isn&rsquo;t a retreat you would see in the movies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been here since Jan. 13 at the equator,&rdquo; Poole told the Enquirer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s this strange yoga school, that&rsquo;s not a yoga school at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean it is, but it&rsquo;s this thing where you&rsquo;re just like facing shadows and everyone&rsquo;s screaming and you&rsquo;re crying every night. And everyone&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;Trust the process.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what it was like before a plague began circling the globe.</p>

<p>Why Ecuador?</p>
<p>Poole started exploring yoga last year as a possible solution to her longstanding struggles with depression and anxiety.</p>
<p>She wanted to avoid pharmaceuticals, medical debt and treatment programs that tend to be geared toward addiction.</p>
<p>As a person who goes all-in, she decided to attend a yoga school and get a certification – something that could be used later in &ldquo;entrepreneurial&rdquo; ways, as well, she said.</p>
<p>But where? A trip to Thailand didn&rsquo;t happen after she woke from a dream in which a person was screaming &ldquo;Not Thailand!&rdquo; at her.</p>
<p>Then, she was hiking in California while taking a break from driving Mark Cohn around and selling merchandise during his tour. You know, Mark Cohn, the voice behind the song &ldquo;Walking in Memphis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This lady had a bag where Ecuador was glowing,&rdquo; Poole said. &ldquo;I just Googled it. I just was like &lsquo;yoga, shamanism, Ecuador.&rsquo; This place showed up, and I didn&rsquo;t read about it. I just paid them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She is aware of just how odd this sounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best way to go. I just go with feelings. You get too much mind into it and gets all wacky,&rdquo; she said laughing. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s kind of how I ended up in that depression world anyhow, not trusting how I felt but more what made sense. And it never made sense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letting the universe decide</p>
<p>On Jan. 13, she arrived at Durga&rsquo;s Tiger School for Tantra Yoga perched on top of a mountain outside Quito, Ecuador.</p>
<p>Ecuador sits on the west coast of South American. About 16.2 million people live there, almost the same population as Ohio and Kentucky, but Ecuador has a bit more land than the two states combined.</p>
<p>The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the country was announced Feb. 29. On Monday, about a month later, the World Health Organization reported 1,835 confirmed cases in Ecuador and 48 deaths. Numbers on par with Ohio alone.</p>

<p>President Lenín Moreno started imposing measures to stop the spread of the virus on March 11. Those measures have escalated over the last three weeks and now there is a nightly curfew, domestic and international travel is restricted, non-essential business is banned.</p>
<p>Poole said in the Quito region, only one person can leave each household to buy food. That applies to the school, as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t leave,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been here inside this compound for a very, very long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What started as a class of about 40 students has dwindled to 14, she said.</p>
<p>Starting about three weeks ago, she said every day they woke up and someone else had taken a plane home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just kind of sat waiting to just let the universe decide,&rdquo; she joked.</p>
<p>But the planes have stopped flying. Earlier this week, Poole got an email saying her April 12 flight home was canceled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it comes to my decision I really am on this journey. I love people at home, but I&rsquo;ve never belonged, which is why I came to the equator to find my people, to find myself,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m totally fine with it. I&rsquo;m actually quite excited about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poole has degrees in political science and electronic media broadcast from Northern Kentucky University. Before that, she graduated from Highlands High School in Fort Thomas.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Just make it up as you go&rsquo;</p>
<p>Poole is now helping the school set an online program that students from around the world can attend. This is in exchange for room and board for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Not only is she stuck in Ecuador, but she is also stuck at the compound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in this school run by some Germans and we&rsquo;re a bunch of foreigners,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;For our safety, we don&rsquo;t go out because, at this point, it&rsquo;s understood that the foreigners are the ones that brought it to Ecuador.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she said the school is like a bubble. Those who have stayed really want to be there to continue the work they were doing.</p>
<p>She said now the remaining students are becoming a part of what brought them to Ecuador while also forming an experimental community to ride out the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What better place than to get quarantined in a time like this than at the equator in a shamanic tantric yoga school,&rdquo; Poole said. &ldquo;We sit around in a circle and we hum and imagine that we are creating force fields of protection around the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her life outside the school is completely on hold. She was supposed to fly home on Easter and start a tour in Wyoming on the April 15. Her new record was scheduled to come out on the 24th along with a series of Wonky Tonk beers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of like what the world is going through right now. Not knowing when the end is going to come, in terms of the quarantine,&rdquo; Poole said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like sitting in the unknown, having to deal with yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she said she is living her dream, music, side hustles, getting some of money from the online artist-support platform Patreon and going to yoga school.</p>
<p>Luckily, she&rsquo;s been renting out her house back home for some additional income so she can continue to morph Wonky Tonk into what she would like it to be: &ldquo;a meld of rock and roll and consciousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every moment and every plan that I&rsquo;ve made this year has fallen apart,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I get the picture. Just make it up as you go.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="ecuadors-covid-19-outbreak-is-one-of-south-americas-biggest">Ecuador&rsquo;s COVID-19 Outbreak Is One Of South America&rsquo;s Biggest</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.npr.org/include/images/facebook-default-wide.jpg?s=1400" alt="img">
Ecuador&rsquo;s COVID-19 Outbreak Is One Of South America&rsquo;s Biggest</p>
<p>Exchange students brought the coronavirus back to Ecuador — overwhelming hospitals with patients. With funeral parlors working limited lockdown hours, bodies lie in the streets.</p>
<p>RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:</p>
<p>Bodies are piling up on the streets in Ecuador. The country has a relatively small population, but one of the biggest outbreaks of COVID-19 in South America. There are more than 3,000 confirmed cases. And as John Otis reports, the epicenter is the port city of Guayaquil.</p>
<p>JOHN OTIS, BYLINE: About half of Ecuador&rsquo;s coronavirus cases have been registered in Guayaquil, overwhelming the city&rsquo;s hospitals. In addition, a nationwide curfew has hindered the work of ambulance drivers and undertakers. So the bodies of people who have succumbed to COVID-19 and other illnesses often lie for days, wrapped in bed sheets and watched over by relatives. That&rsquo;s what happened to Victor Morande, a 38-year-old Guayaquil resident who died in his home of respiratory failure. In a local TV interview, the victim&rsquo;s cousin, Keyla Reyes, was distraught.</p>
<p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
<p>KEYLA REYES: (Non-English language spoken).</p>
<p>OTIS: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been dead for four days,&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been calling the police, but no one comes.&rdquo; Because the stench of the decomposing body filled her house, Reyes had moved it to the sidewalk.</p>
<p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
<p>UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Non-English language spoken).</p>
<p>OTIS: This Guayaquil man tells a similar story about his dead brother, whose body lay in the driveway of his home.</p>
<p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
<p>UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Non-English language spoken).</p>
<p>OTIS: In a video posted on social media, he says he was told there were no ambulances available in all of Guayaquil. Even Guayaquil&rsquo;s mayor, Cynthia Viteri, seemed shocked.</p>
<p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
<p>CYNTHIA VITERI: (Non-English language spoken).</p>
<p>OTIS: She asks in a Facebook video, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s happening to the public health system in this country?&rdquo; One problem, says Guayaquil political analyst Martha Roldos, is that government epidemiologists have scaled back their work amid budget cuts. In addition, the city sends many exchange students to Italy and Spain, two of the countries hardest hit by the coronavirus.</p>
<p>MARTHA ROLDOS: A lot of people was returning to Ecuador to spend vacations with their families. So there was a lot of people coming from Italy and Spain.</p>
<p>OTIS: In a speech on Thursday, President Lenin Moreno warned that as many as 3,500 people could die of coronavirus in and around Guayaquil.</p>
<p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
