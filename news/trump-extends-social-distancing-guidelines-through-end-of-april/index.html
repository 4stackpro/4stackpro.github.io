Mr. Edwards and several other governors largely steered clear of responding to those criticisms by Mr. Trump. Instead, several of them stressed that they were working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other federal agencies even as they pleaded for more help getting ventilators, surgical masks and other medical equipment they need.</p>
<p>“You know, I don’t have energy to respond to every slight,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Democrat of Michigan, said on “State of the Union.” “What I’m trying to do is work well with the federal government. And I will tell you this. There are people from the White House on down who are working 24/7, just like we are at the states. We’re all stressed, because we have people that are dying right now.”</p>
<p>Still, on Sunday, Mr. Trump repeated a complaint that Democratic governors had insulted him and said he would delegate calls with those officials to other people in the White House.</p>
<p>“I don’t have to call because I’m probably better off not,” Mr. Trump said, describing Mr. Inslee as “a nasty person” and raising his failed candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination. “I don’t like the governor of Washington, so you know who calls? I get Mike Pence to call. I get the head of FEMA to call. I get the admiral to call.”</p>
<p>“Because when they disrespect me, they’re disrespecting our government,” he said.</p>
<p>And Mr. Trump once again targeted officials in New York for scorn, appearing to suggest that New York hospitals are hoarding — or doing something else improper — with protective gear like their surgical masks. He said that he did not believe they really need the increases in protective equipment they claim are necessary to protect doctors and nurses treating coronavirus patients.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump said he was told that demand for masks at a New York hospital jumped from 10,000 to 20,000 per week before the virus arrived to nearly 300,000 a week now.</p>
<p>“Something’s going on. And you ought to look into it as reporters. Where are the masks going — are they going out the back door?” Mr. Trump said. “Somebody should probably look into that because I just don’t see from a practical standpoint how that’s possible to go from that to that, and we have that happening in numerous places.”

<h3 id="us-coronavirus-cases-top-139000-as-trump-extends-social-distancing-guidelines-until-april-30">US coronavirus cases top 139,000 as Trump extends social distancing guidelines until April 30</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200329010716-new-york-travel-advisory-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) The United States will extend its set of social distancing guidelines until April 30, President Trump said in a coronavirus news briefing at the White House on Sunday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will be extending our guidelines to April 30 to slow the spread,&rdquo; the President said. &ldquo;On Tuesday, we will be finalizing these plans and providing a summary of our findings, supporting data and strategy to the American people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As of Sunday evening there are more than 139,000 cases of coronavirus in the United States. At least 2,425 people have died.</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s administration issued guidelines on social distancing on March 16 aimed at containing the coronavirus outbreak</p>
<p>The guidance, which initially had a 15-day time frame, urged Americans to avoid groups of more than 10 and advised that older people stay home.</p>
<p>Trump hopes the country will be on its way to recovery by June 1, he said Sunday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of great things will be happening,&rdquo; the President said.</p>
<p>Travel advisory issued for tri-state area</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued the travel advisory Saturday, urging residents of the three states to &ldquo;refrain from nonessential domestic travel for 14 days effective immediately.&rdquo; The states would have &ldquo;full discretion&rdquo; on implementing the advisory, which exempts employees in critical fields.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump had contemplated issuing an enforceable quarantine for parts of those states, then later said it will not be necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact of the matter is, people really aren&rsquo;t traveling a whole lot,&rdquo; New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said when asked about the advisory on ABC&rsquo;s &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; Sunday . &ldquo;A travel warning, we&rsquo;re fine with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Murphy added that his state is &ldquo;all in on flattening the curve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The CDC advisory came as some state officials began implementing their own restrictions on visitors from outside their states.</p>
<p>Florida is implementing its own strategies to slow the spread of the virus by setting up checkpoints for motorists entering the state, Gov. Ron DeSantis said Saturday.</p>
<p>According to a news release from the Florida Department of Transportation, travelers will be required to fill out a form with their travel history and contact information. Motorists coming from &ldquo;areas with substantial community spread&rdquo; including New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Louisiana will be required to isolate themselves for 14 days, the news release said.</p>
<p>Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas expanded an executive order requiring people traveling to his state from certain places to be quarantined for 14 days.</p>
<p>The previous order mandated a quarantine for people flying into Texas from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and New Orleans. The expanded version, announced Sunday, includes anyone driving into Texas from Louisiana, and anyone flying from the cities of Miami, Detroit, Chicago and Atlanta. It also includes Washington state and California.</p>
<p>Patients wait for coronavirus testing outside Elmhurst Hospital Center in New York on Friday.</p>
<p>US has the most cases worldwide</p>
<p>Sunday, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a key member of the White House coronavirus task force, said on CNN&rsquo;s &ldquo;State of the Union&rdquo; that, based on modeling, 100,000 or more could die from the coronavirus in the United States.</p>
<p>Fauci reiterated that comment in that evening&rsquo;s White House briefing, telling reporters, &ldquo;What we&rsquo;re trying to do is not to let that happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The United States surpassed China and Italy this week, becoming the country with the most confirmed cases worldwide. And the growing number of cases has also revealed new demographics facing severe illness.</p>
<p>Cases of young adults developing severe illnesses have been more widely reported, but children were thought to be avoiding the harshest effects.</p>
<p>On Saturday, state officials reported the death of an infant under age 1 who tested positive for coronavirus and is believed to be the youngest person to die of the virus in the United States.</p>
<p>An investigation is underway to determine the cause of death, the Illinois Department of Public Health said.</p>

<p>Police and nurses are falling ill</p>
<p>Those charged with treating patients and maintaining order are feeling the effects of the pandemic as well.</p>
<p>A nurse for Jackson Health System in Miami, Araceli Buendia Ilagan, has died due to complications from the coronavirus, according to a Jackson Health spokeswoman. One colleague said the nurse, who worked in the intensive care unit, was &ldquo;vital and irreplaceable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ilagan&rsquo;s death also has her colleagues worried about their own health and safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now everyone that works with her in the unit is scared that they may be carrying the virus as well,&rdquo; a nurse who worked closely with Ilagan told CNN.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 12 nurses at the University of Illinois Hospital have tested positive for coronavirus, the state&rsquo;s nursing association said.</p>
<p>ln New York City, 730 uniformed NYPD officers and 96 civilian employees are infected with the coronavirus, according to a law enforcement official. Twenty-nine of them are hospitalized and one is in critical condition, the official said.</p>
<p>At least 4,662 officers &ndash; about 12% of the department &ndash; are out sick, either with the coronavirus or other ailments, the official said.</p>
<p>In a rare step, the NYPD is advising officers and employees with underlying conditions to seek permission from their commanding officers to work from home, the official said. Pregnant staff are being advised to do the same.</p>
<p>NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea anticipates close to 900 NYPD employees will test positive for Covid-19 by Monday morning, he said in a news conference Sunday.</p>
<p>Cases are rising as first responders have dealt with a huge influx of emergency calls. FDNY Commissioner Daniel Nigro said Sunday the previous five days were the busiest in the department&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>New York City&rsquo;s police department lost its first detective to Covid-19, marking the third death of an NYPD employee to the disease.</p>
<p>Gov. Cuomo paid homage to the detective, Cedric Dixon , in a news conference Sunday, along with Kious Kelly , an assistant nurse manager at New York City&rsquo;s Mt. Sinai Hospital who also lost his life.</p>
<p>Cuomo described what they and all first responders do as an &ldquo;act of love and courage,&rdquo; driven by their &ldquo;passion and belief in helping others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even have the words to express my admiration for them,&rdquo; the governor said.</p>
<p>A push for medical supplies grows</p>
<p>Medical staff nationwide have struggled to maintain an adequate supply of personal protective equipment, hospital beds and ventilators.</p>
<p>Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said a New Orleans convention center would be converted into an emergency hospital with a 1,000-bed capacity for coronavirus patients. The facility &ldquo;will be open no later than a week from today,&rdquo; the governor said Sunday.</p>
<p>The shortage of personal protective equipment drove a group of New York nurses to protest outside the Jacobi Medical Center on Saturday, demanding the supplies they need to do their jobs safely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we get sick, our patients will get sick. This is for our entire community,&rdquo; said Kelley Cabrera, a registered nurse. &ldquo;If you look at what we are wearing in comparison to other countries, it&rsquo;s unacceptable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The medical center said that although the staff has adequate supplies, there is a nationwide shortage and conservation measures are in place.</p>
<p>Trump approved four more emergency hospitals in New York. The facilities in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and the Bronx will provide 4,000 beds.</p>
<p>Another 1,000 beds will be available this week in a temporary overflow hospital at Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, and an additional 1,000 beds will be on the USNS Comfort set to arrive in New York on Monday, Cuomo said.</p>

<p>But officials believe the state will need 140,000 beds when it reaches the apex of the pandemic in 14 to 21 days, Cuomo said.</p>
<p>The administration will also facilitate the production or acquisition of &ldquo;100,000 additional units&rdquo; of ventilators over a 100-day period, Trump said.</p>
<p>Large corporations are also stepping up to feed the supply gap. New Balance announced Friday on Twitter that its US factories will work on developing, manufacturing and delivering facial masks to hospitals. The same day, Delta Air Lines announced it will fly medical professionals for free to areas significantly impacted by coronavirus.</p>
<p>And on Sunday, Trump announced that health insurers Humana and Cigna would be waiving co-pays, co-insurance and deductibles on coronavirus costs.

<h3 id="social-distancing-is-a-privilege">Social Distancing Is a Privilege</h3>
<p><img src="https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/india-migrant-workers-coronavirus-1208365785.jpg" alt="img">
Social Distancing Is a Privilege</p>
<p>On March 24, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a complete nationwide lockdown for 21 days—one of the strongest national measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The decision marked a sharp turn. Just a week ago, the world’s second-most populous country was being seen as a mysterious anomaly that had remained relatively unscathed from the deadly pandemic. But then the math caught up. As the lockdown began, the number of confirmed cases in the country was beginning to grow exponentially, rising to 933 by March 28.</p>
<p>While New Delhi has taken decisive action, there are fears it has come too late and that too many of the country’s poor and homeless will be left exposed. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, a pandemic as long ago as March 11. Back then, India refused to label it a health emergency, and large parts of the country continued about business as usual. Even now, the entire country has tested fewer than 30,000 people, representing one of the lowest testing rates in the world.</p>
<p>Ramanan Laxminarayan, a leading public health expert and the director of the U.S.-based Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics, and Policy, projects that despite the lockdown, the peak of the pandemic will likely hit India by late April or early May and that around a million people will need hospital beds and critical care at that point. This is where disaster could strike. India has just 0.5 hospital beds per 1,000 people (Italy has more than six times as many) and spends just 3.7 percent of its GDP on health (the United States spends 17 percent of its GDP on health care). Meanwhile New Delhi has allotted large sums of money to build the world’s tallest statues in an obnoxious display of nationalism.</p>
<p>Last year, Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, put aside $91 million for the construction of a statue of the Hindu deity Ram even as hundreds of people in his state had died of encephalitis in the last few years, with key emergency facilities lacking necessary oxygen cylinders. Adityanath’s stated aim was to build a statue taller than the 597-foot one of the freedom fighter Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, inaugurated by Modi in 2018, which cost $400 million.</p>
<p>It is not just a long-standing misallocation of funds that is the problem. Even when Modi announced his lockdown on March 24—with no mention of how people would get their daily supplies—his words sparked panic. People rushed to the streets in large numbers before Modi could finish his speech. Pharmacies were swarmed with nervous faces; social distancing was quickly forgotten. At supermarkets, anxious families stocked up on essential commodities. Milk and eggs disappeared from the shelves. But while the privileged—a tiny minority in India—were stocking their refrigerators with weeks of supplies, the country’s daily wage workers and laborers were flocking to their hometowns, often barefoot, some with their infants tied to their backs and young children crying in tow as police beat them mercilessly for flouting curfew rules.“If I do not go out for a week, my children and my wife will die.”</p>
<p>In Mumbai, the country’s financial capital, some 300 migrant workers crammed themselves in food container trucks so they could reach home away from the scrutiny of baton-wielding police. The heart-wrenching images of young men, with sweaty, bare bodies making their way out of the claustrophobic containers, made headlines on the country’s TV channels.</p>
<p>In neighboring Dharavi, Asia’s largest slum with a population of 1 million in an area of less than a square mile, workers laughed when I asked them if they had been practicing social distancing. As I stood outside a hovel, trying to keep some distance from people the day after Modi’s lockdown order was announced, even talking about social distancing felt obscene near a room of eight people crammed together with barely any space to breathe.</p>
<p>Ghanshyam Lal, a migrant laborer who works in a Mumbai tannery, has been feeding a family of eight on his daily wage of $3 a day. He told me he didn’t care about the virus as much as he did about putting food on the table. And he worried about his wife, Asha, who was on dialysis at a government hospital and may now be booted out to make way for wealthier patients who had tested positive for the coronavirus. “How easy it is for the prime minister to say do not step out of your houses,” he said. “If I do not go out for a week, my children and my wife will die.”</p>
<p>Lal’s fears are not exaggerated. In a city with a population of 20 million, the government hospitals have only 400 ventilators and a thousand beds for intensive care.</p>
<p>At Mumbai’s Kasturba Gandhi Hospital, which is taking the bulk of patients who have tested positive for the coronavirus, doctors told me that their neighbors have distanced themselves from the doctors’ families. “We are saving lives. We are breaking down in the bathrooms while we are being treated like untouchables outside of the hospital premises,” said one young doctor who wished to stay anonymous.</p>
<p>On Sunday, March 22, wealthy Indians came out on their balconies clapping and banging utensils to mark a national day of curfew. “Modi, Modi,” they chanted. But it was a misplaced celebration of nationalism. It also highlighted a fundamental divide in the country. On the one hand, there is the country’s upper-middle class, the elite that has stocked hand sanitizer, mango puree, and ground coffee and is posting patriotic selfies on social media. But a much larger underclass, the country’s poor and struggling, is battling poverty, has no access to soap, water, or toilets, and is living in packed clusters in slums. These same people are extremely vulnerable to the virus; for them, social distancing is a curious privilege.</p>
<p>The unpreparedness of India’s health care and social system to deal with the pandemic is aggravated by an indifferent law enforcement that deploys brutal force against its people. On March 25, as the lockdown began, a 32-year-old man was beaten to death by police in West Bengal when he stepped out to buy milk for his family. And when police are not brutalizing the poor, they are being indifferent to the migrant laborers who are walking miles from one state to the other, trying to reach their families on empty stomachs and with no public transport. Their cries are falling on deaf ears. Rahul Musahar, an 11-year-old boy who used to work with his father collecting scrap every day, was shifted to a government hospital in Bhojpur district in Bihar this week. Musahar had not eaten food in three days. His mother, who is pregnant with her second child, tried desperately to feed herself and her son. Because of the lockdown, Musahar’s father, who would earn just enough money to survive a day, could not arrange for a meal. Musahar died on return from the hospital, not killed by the virus but by hunger—which could potentially kill many in India if the government does not take immediate measures.While the world was stocking up on masks and gloves, India was busy dousing communal fire stoked by its own government.</p>
<p>Could India have been better prepared? Last month, while much of the world—including next-door neighbor China—was raising the alarm about the fast-spreading coronavirus, India was making global headlines for a bloody carnage in the country’s capital in which 54 people were killed and hundreds injured. And all of it was spawned by hate speech by top-ranking ministers in Modi’s cabinet. The city’s police watched on. While the world was stocking up on masks and gloves, India was busy dousing communal fire stoked by its own government.</p>
<p>Thousands of families displaced in New Delhi’s violence—with their kin in hospitals and their livelihoods destroyed—were living in temporary relief camps in the capital. Then, as the country suddenly woke up to the threat of COVID-19, the camps were abruptly razed to the ground. The victims were left with no help.</p>
<p>A country that is already grappling with its worst unemployment rate in decades and a rising and divisive nationalism now must deal with a pandemic that will strike a major blow to its economy—especially for its so-called informal workers who have no health care, benefits, or safety nets to fall back on. WHO has said India has a major role to play in containing the pandemic—after all, it is home to one-sixth of the world’s population. And while New Delhi’s decision to lock down has been belated, it has the potential to minimize damage: With all forms of public transport canceled, included domestic and international airlines, travel and co-mingling will be sharply reduced. But a bold stroke like this needs to be accompanied with a healing hand for the economically and socially disadvantaged. The next few weeks will be crucial for all of India but especially for its poor.
