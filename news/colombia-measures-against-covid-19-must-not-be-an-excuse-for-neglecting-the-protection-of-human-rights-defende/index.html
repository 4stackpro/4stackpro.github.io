The Colombian state must not use measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as a pretext to weaken or withdraw protection for human rights defenders and social leaders, Amnesty International said today.</p>
<p>“Colombia is one of the world’s most lethal countries for human rights defenders and social leaders and, in the context of COVID-19, they now face even greater risks. Due to the restrictions imposed to contain the pandemic, state protection measures have been weakened, they can no longer keep moving from one location to another for their safety, and their attackers know that public security forces are focusing on issues related to the pandemic,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.</p>
<p>Colombia is one of the world’s most lethal countries for human rights defenders and social leaders and, in the context of COVID-19, they now face even greater risks Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International</p>
<p>“The Colombian authorities cannot let human rights defenders suffer attacks and threats. The state must maintain its protection schemes and must generate collective protection strategies for communities at risk, while implementing preventive measures to contain COVID-19.”</p>
<p>Amnesty International has received information that the protective measures offered by the National Protection Unit to at least two defenders have been reduced in recent days. In one case, due to a reduction on the number of his bodyguards, the defender has been forced into hiding for fear of being attacked by armed groups who have threatened him because of his human rights work. Another defender no longer benefits from nightly patrols, which could expose him to attacks.</p>
<p>On 24 March, Amnesty International issued a series of recommendations to states in the Americas to ensure that their responses to COVID-19 are in line with their international human rights obligations. UN experts have also told states that measures taken in the context of the pandemic should not result in the silencing of human rights defenders.</p>
<p>In the past week, at least six social leaders and human rights defenders had been killed in Colombia. On 19 March, Ivo Humberto Bracamonte Quiroz, a councillor from Puerto Santander and director of the online news program NPS, was killed while exercising in Puerto Santander’s Beltranía neighbourhood.</p>
<p>On the same day, three armed men killed Marco Rivadeneira, a leader of Putumayo’s campesino (peasant farmer) communities and member of the Mesa Nacional de Garantías, after dragging him of a campesino meeting in Puerto Asís’s Nueva Granada neighborhood.</p>
<p>Angel Ovidio Quintero Gonzalez, a social leader and president of the council in San Francisco in the department of Antioquia, was also killed that day. The San Francisco mayor reported that Quintero was the victim of a shooting and, although he managed to escape from it, his body was found in a river hours later.</p>

The state must maintain its protection schemes and must generate collective protection strategies for communities at risk, while implementing preventive measures to contain COVID-19 Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International</p>
<p>On 24 March, the Regional Indigenous Organization of Valle del Cauca (ORIVAC) reported that two Embera indigenous leaders, Omar and Ernesto Guasiruma, were killed in a rural area of the municipality of Bolivar while complying with the government quarantine at their home. ORIVAC also reported that two members of the same family were injured in the attack.</p>
<p>Carlota Isabel Salinas Péres, a leader of the NGO Organización Femenina Popular, was also killed on 24 March in the municipality of San Pablo in the department of Bolivar. At around 8pm, armed men arrived at her home in the Guarigua neighbourhood and shot her dead. Her partner is still missing today.</p>

<h3 id="juan-sebastian-cabal-launches-campaign-to-combat-covid-19-in-colombia">Juan Sebastian Cabal Launches Campaign To Combat COVID-19 In Colombia</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.atptour.com/en/news/www.atptour.com/-/media/images/news/2020/03/27/18/16/cabal-2020-covid-19.jpeg" alt="img">
While the pandemic caused by COVID-19 continues to wreak havoc around the world, some of the biggest stars on the ATP Tour have thrown themselves into providing aid during this difficult situation.</p>
<p>Juan Sebastian Cabal, No. 2 in the FedEx ATP Doubles Rankings, launched an initiative with his brother to help the most vulnerable people in his hometown of Cali, Colombia. Cabal is promoting a campaign on social media to raise funds for buying food in local markets and delivering it to families in need, especially those who normally work on the street. The goal is to make it possible for everyone to stay home and adopt the necessary protective measures against COVID-19.</p>
<p>“While our doctors, nurses, security, supermarket and pharmacy staff are fighting for us, we cannot stand by and watch,” Cabal wrote in a post on his Instagram account. In our city, 70 per cent of the population relies on the informal economy and we know that part of the success in the fight against COVID-19 is social isolation. In order to guarantee that our people who work in this way can comply, we must guarantee food for them and their families during the days of quarantine.</p>
<p>“We invite you to support us and contribute to this cause. With the help of community leaders, we are identifying the city’s vulnerable families.”</p>
<p>Cabal is promoting and coordinating the initiative from his home. Donations can be made through two bank accounts that the Colombian has set up. His longtime doubles partner and fellow Colombian, Robert Farah, also shared the campaign on his own social media accounts.</p>
<p>There are 491 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Colombia as of 27 March, while the global figure has reached 577,624.

<h3 id="hotels-and-fairgrounds-to-receive-covid-19-patients-as-colombia-cases-reach-608">Hotels and fairgrounds to receive COVID-19 patients as Colombia cases reach 608</h3>
<p><img src="https://thecitypaperbogota.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/armada.jpg" alt="img">
Confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Colombia are released daily by the Ministry of Health based on the data gathered from the National Institute of Health (INS). Since the first patient with symptoms of coronavirus was reported in Bogotá by the INS on March 5, the numbers nationwide have grown to 608, with six deaths and 8 persons recovered.</p>
<p>A bulletin dated March 26 in which COVID-19 cases stood at 491, a mere 21 cases higher than the 470 confirmed the previous day, raising fears that the testing method in the country was flawed, and samples sent to Bogotá were not presenting an accurate picture of the extent of the outbreak.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the INS released a statement attributing the lower numbers to a technical failure in the testing machine but given that the country where the machine was manufactured – Germany – has closed its borders, getting a replacement was not feasible. The machine is capable of processing 100 samples in over an hour.</p>
<p>Over the next 48 hours, technicians repaired the machine to confirm 608 patients infected, with Bogotá reporting the highest concentration of the disease with 264 cases.</p>
<p>As the country braces for an onslaught of patients requiring medical assistance and intensive care units, hotels, fairgrounds and military bases are being adapted as makeshift hospitals. In Bogotá, the main hall of Corferias exhibition grounds is being transformed into a ward for 2,200 patients with “low complexity” symptoms.</p>
<p>The landmark Tequendama Hotel will also serve as a temporary “semi-medical” facility for COVID-19 diagnosed persons. In Cartagena, the Naval Hospital has set up field tents to attends infected persons in the port city.
