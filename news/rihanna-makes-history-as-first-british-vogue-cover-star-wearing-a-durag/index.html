Now that Rihanna is an honourary Londoner, she should probably grace the cover of British Vogue every month (in my opinion, at least).</p>
<p>This month, the Grammy-winning artist stars on the cover of the iconic fashion magazine wearing a durag — a first in British Vogue&rsquo;s 104-year history.</p>
<p>Contributing editor Funmi Fetto explains in a Vogue article the significance of Rihanna wearing the cloth, which was used in the time of slavery as a method to &ldquo;suppress black women’s beauty and distinguish their lowly, inferior status as labourers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today, the durag, an iteration of the head cloth birthed in oppression, is a celebration of black culture,&rdquo; writes Fetto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tainted fabric has been reclaimed as a symbol of black beauty, a signifier of style worn on the streets, the catwalk, the red carpet… And now, in a powerful mic-drop moment, the durag is making its first appearance on the May 2020 cover of British Vogue, worn by Rihanna,&rdquo; she adds.</p>

<p>As well as its cultural significance, the durag has a functional value. Hair stylist Charlotte Mensah told Fetto the stretchable cloth &ldquo;serves as a tool to keep waves in check. Men with low cuts brush their hair in a forward motion and the durag is put on to compress the hair, creating a wave pattern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Vogue interview, Rihanna talked about her &ldquo;imminent&rdquo; new album, how she parties in London, and what she plans to do in 10 years&rsquo; time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I’d rather go to Brixton,&rdquo; Rihanna said in reference to London partying. &ldquo;But if I do that now, and I try to get some Jamaican food, it’s going to be an event, you know? So if I want a night off, I go hang with the people I would never hang with. And I just, I’m just in my bubble. Which I really enjoy about London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And what about that new album of hers? &ldquo;I can’t say when I’m going to drop . . . but I am very aggressively working on music,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don’t want all my albums to feel like themes. There are no rules, there’s no format, there’s nothing. There’s just good music and if I feel it, I’m putting it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Image: STEVEN KLEIN</p>
<p>As for where she&rsquo;ll be in 10 years, Rihanna says she&rsquo;ll have three or four kids by then.</p>
<p>Asked if she&rsquo;ll have them on her own if she hasn&rsquo;t met the right person, she said yes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell yeah, I feel like society makes me want to feel like &lsquo;Oh you got it wrong …,'&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They diminish you as a mother, [if] there’s not a dad in your kid’s lives. But the only thing that matters is happiness, that’s the only healthy relationship between a parent and a child. That’s the only thing that can raise a child truly, is love.&rdquo;</p>

Rihanna makes history in the May 2020 issue of British Vogue, becoming the first person to ever wear a durag on the cover of the prestigious fashion publication.</p>
<p>The Barbadian singer, songwriter, actress, and businesswoman poses in the durag for a high-fashion shoot captured by critically-acclaimed photographer Steven Klein.</p>
<p>Inside the magazine, Rihanna speaks to British broadcaster Afua Hirsch about her experience of living in London and the global struggle with racism.</p>
<p>Rebel: Rihanna makes history in May 2020 issue of British Vogue , becoming the first person to ever wear a durag on the cover of the prestigious fashion publication</p>
<p>The star has called the UK capital home for the past three years, revealing she loves the anonymity she feels among flash London crowds who are &lsquo;too bougie to give a s**t about me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Living in London though has given the globe-trotting star a different perspective on the struggle against racism and injustice which she insists is &lsquo;everywhere&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think police brutality is probably extremely severe in America,&rsquo; she explains, &lsquo;but racism is alive everywhere. Everywhere&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s the same [in the UK]. It&rsquo;s either blatant, which is becoming more and more of a norm, or it&rsquo;s underlying, where people don&rsquo;t even know they&rsquo;re being obvious about it. You know, it&rsquo;s just a subconscious layer that&rsquo;s embedded from their entire core.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cover star: The Barbadian singer, songwriter, actress, and businesswoman poses in the durag for a high-fashion shoot captured by critically-acclaimed photographer Steven Klein</p>
<p>Rihanna explained that growing up in Barbados with her mother Monica, who was an immigrant from Guyana, the former British colony in South America, shaped her early experiences of racism.</p>
<p>Explaining that Guyanese immigrants were unpopular in Barbados when she was growing up, the star said &lsquo;that&rsquo;s why I really relate and empathise with Mexican people or Latino people, who are discriminated against in America.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know what it feels like to have the immigration come into your home in the middle of the night and drag people out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not my mother, my mother was legal,&rsquo; she clarified &lsquo;but let&rsquo;s just say I know what that fight looks like. I&rsquo;ve witnessed it. I&rsquo;ve been in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>London girl: Inside the magazine, Rihanna speaks to British broadcaster Afua Hirsch about her experience of living in the UK and the global racism she has witnessed</p>
<p>Rihanna has channelled her experiences both into music and lately her fashion and cosmetic lines, launching the sell-out brand Fenty Beauty in 2017.</p>
<p>Vogue explains that it was also the singer who came up with concept of wearing a durag on the cover, texting Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful in the early hours with her idea.</p>
<p>Enninful wrote in his editor&rsquo;s letter for the issue:&lsquo;Did I ever think that I would see a durag on the cover of Vogue? No reader, I did not&hellip;Yet here we have the most aspirational and beautiful durag. How exciting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It takes a person of extraordinary charisma to pull off such a moment.&rsquo;</p>
