<p>Remembered across the world as Arsenal&rsquo;s number 7, just like the club he would grow to love, the story of one of the Gunners&rsquo; favourite sons began in south-east London.</p>
<p>19 years after his passing, despite the club taking great leaps in terms of its reach, David Rocastle remains rooted in Arsenal&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was just a south London boy from Brockley,&rdquo; says his younger sister Karen, &ldquo;Rather than mourning his death, we celebrate his life because the fans are keeping his memory alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every year since his passing there has always been a big remembrance for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There’s an American lady that comes over with a massive banner that’s been signed by Thierry Henry and others. She’ll walk around the Emirates with this banner and there are others who sing his chants and they still remember him. That makes it easier for us every year on his anniversary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like many footballers, Rocastle&rsquo;s obsession with anything round and was evident from very early on. Despite being a talented cricketer and being involved in athletics at school, football was the sport that captured the imagination most.</p>
<p>As a result, similar to today&rsquo;s players who have restricted to volleying rolls of toilet paper across their front rooms, a young Rocastle found the urge to contain his imagination to be a task too difficult to fulfil.</p>
<p>Thankfully for him, however, rather than being stuck inside, the possibility of playing proper football presented itself fairly quickly. Local side Vista offered him his first taste of organised football before impressing in school where the dream started to slowly materialise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he was able to kick something he would be kicking something,&rdquo; Karen adds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We lived in a three bedroom flat on the top floor in Turnham and in our house, like any other black household, had a cabinet with a plastic fruit bowl. Him and our brother used to just kick around a plastic piece of fruit, breaking my mum’s cabinet in the process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So from primary school, he already had a love for football.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having found his calling very early, Rocastle was already ahead of the curve. Breaking into the Arsenal first team at just 18-years-old, routinely bamboozling defenders with his silky feet as well as getting the mental edge on his opponents - as famously recalled during Anfield 89 - he continued to prove this once he turned professional.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for David and his family alike, what helped him become so mature so quickly was the early passing of his father. An event which saw the family respond in tremendous form in the aftermath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I look at my mum with the biggest amount of respect. She was a single mother that raised us with love. She raised five children and we’ve all turned out fine,&rdquo; says Karen, &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A month after my dad died, my mum had a knock on the door from social services. They wanted to put us into care because there were five of us but she wouldn’t let it happen. She told her to ‘Get away from my front door and leave me and my children alone to mourn in peace.’&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Losing dad made him grow up faster. After he passed, David went and lived with our grandma and cousins. Our mum had to bribe him with a fish tank to come home. They lived on Lee High Road - 15-20 minutes give or take on the bus from Brockley.</p>
<p>With support from the community around them, the Rocastle&rsquo;s managed to get steady once more. Whether it was David, Karen and their siblings going out to play outside, David excelling at school so much that his mother still has his reports or him being driven to football matches because his mother couldn&rsquo;t, they got back on track.</p>
<p>Having grown through that experience setbacks that came after could be pushed aside - no matter how disappointing - and he could go on to pursue exactly what he wanted - a career in football.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His first trial was at Millwall and he was gutted when he didn’t get in, especially because it was a local team,&rdquo; his sister Karen says. &ldquo;It was strange that he was scouted [by Arsenal] and went there but I do remember when the scout came to my mum to talk about the trials. When they said that they were going to sign him, it was just because he wanted to play football to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because our mum couldn’t take him, his coach would go up with him which he was grateful for. Back then, it was good that there was that support network to help him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we didn’t have help from the club I’m not sure what would have happened. But my mum would never have stopped him from doing what he wanted to do because with our dad dying early, David was the dad of the family to us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even though he was just a couple of years older than us, he was quite a mature person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although he quickly became a household name once among the first team at Highbury, Rocastle never forgot where it all began.</p>
<p>From stories of himself and Ian Wright playing for fun at Honor Oak Park, the crucial conversation they had on the bridge which leads down to Crofton Park, taking the train up to north London from Forest Hill Station and telling Kate Huey MP [Arsenal&rsquo;s then-Educational Advisor] he was signed as a professional by Arsenal in the Rocky &amp; Wrighty documentary, his footprints were all over south-east London.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[The community] definitely was very important [to David],&rdquo; Karen recalls, &ldquo;Even though he was progressing at Arsenal, he was still part of the community and never forgot where he came from which is the most important thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The strength of our community, from the teachers to the coaches, if it wasn’t for that, he may not have made it.</p>
<p>Having had the ability to stay in London and commute up to Arsenal, his departure brought a massive shift. Just a season after Wright&rsquo;s arrival at the club, he was sold. After 10 years of wearing the famous red and white, not being able to do so any longer affected Rocastle to the point that when heading north to Leeds and Manchester United before coming back down to Chelsea, he never bought a house.</p>
<p>Instead, he chose to rent and would often travel back down to London when he had the chance because he felt he&rsquo;d soon come back home.</p>
<p>Despite struggling to find the love he felt for Arsenal at other clubs, with his career winding down in the late 90s, Rocastle found that spark once more. Signing for Sabah, now in his early 30s with a young family of his own, the Arsenal icon moved out to Malaysia where if given the choice, his sister believes he would have opted to stay - the rise in the price of food being a factor even back then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was good for him and his family,&rdquo; Karen explains, &ldquo;We didn’t visit him but he said that he loved it over there. He had the best life ever with the weather and the freedom his children had going to school out there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember him coming home once and he really fancied fish and chips. We went to the fish and chips shop down in Forest Hill and when he heard the price he said ‘I could buy a whole meal for me and my family back in Malaysia for that’. He couldn’t believe the price of food after being in Malaysia for 18 months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he hadn’t had passed, he would’ve spent most of his time out there after retiring. He loved their way of life and how the Malaysian people accepted him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, it wasn&rsquo;t just in Malaysia where David Rocastle was accepted, however. From Highbury, to the Emirates, Rocastle Road and unthinkable corners of the globe, his name will forever be respected which is something his sister Karen feels he fully understood all the time but especially when on the pitch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think with us being an average family, it gave him more drive to do well,&rdquo; she concludes, &ldquo;He did well in everything. His school reports were always great, our mum still has his last school report. Everything he did, he did with such drive and passion because he wanted to be the best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His payback in football is the fans. You can see that he loved how the fans loved him. When he scored, his smile was like a bright beam so that was payback for him.

<p>There is very little cause for Hull City supporters to recall the 1997-98 season with any affection. A final standing of 90th in the Football League was as bad as it has ever been in a history spanning over a century, while an introduction to David Lloyd as the club’s owner proved to be equally dispiriting.</p>
<p>A campaign that yielded only 11 league wins brought some of the club’s darkest days but within a 10-week period came some cherished rays of light.</p>
<p>David Rocastle was City’s short-lived hero during the final months of 1997. An elegant midfielder and two-time title winner with Arsenal, he fleetingly lit up a team managed by his former England team-mate Mark Hateley.</p>
<p>Just 11 appearances came during an unlikely loan from Chelsea but the impression Rocastle made was a lasting one.</p>
<p>“He was just a fantastic human being,” said Mark Greaves, a team-mate of Rocastle’s at Boothfery Park. Paul Fewings, another from the City team, concurs. “People say you should never meet your heroes but he was first class,” he said.</p>
<p>“He was gifted in a way that none of us were,” added Adam Lowthorpe, another awestruck local boy at the time. “He had these wow moments that no-one else could dream of doing.”</p>
<p>City, in truth, had no right to sign a player of Rocastle’s calibre. For all that his best days were behind him in a career derailed by injuries, the midfielder had been one of English football’s brightest talents.</p>
<p>Twice he had helped George Graham’s Arsenal to lift the Division One title and twice he had earned inclusion in the PFA’s Team of the Year. Fourteen England caps had also been won by the time he was sold to Leeds United for £2m in 1992, before further moves followed to Manchester City and Chelsea.</p>
<p>Not until he was loaned to Norwich City in 1996-97 had Rocastle played anywhere but England’s top-flight.</p>
<p>City, meanwhile, had drifted through mediocrity and on into obscurity. The high-profile appointment of Hateley had been designed to alter that but loaning Rocastle was a move none had seen coming.</p>
<p>“There was rumours going round the dressing room that a big player was coming in because Mark Hateley had a lot of connections at a higher level,” explained Greaves. “And Rocky had superstar status.”</p>
<p>“I remember him coming into the dressing room and I don’t think many people spoke to him initially,” added Fewings. “I think we were probably in awe of him a little bit.</p>
<p>“Maybe we thought he’d come in as a big-time Charlie but there was none of that at all. He was very humble.</p>
<p>“My peg was next to his in the changing room and at the time cycling shorts were all the rage.</p>
<p>“I’d left mine in an away dressing room somewhere so he gave me a pair. ‘Look, you can have these if you want.’ I wore them for a few days and he dropped into the conversation they’d belonged to Gianluca Vialli.”</p>
<p>If Rocastle is still fondly remembered by his team-mates at City 22 years on, it owes as much to his character as it does his undoubted talent. Without airs or graces, the Londoner was immediately popular.</p>
<p>“He was clearly better than anyone else but that was never reflected in the way he behaved,” said Lowthorpe, then a wide-eyed 22-year-old. “He had as much time for me as he did the senior pros. That’s who he was.”</p>
<p>Greaves, though, can still remember Rocastle’s first training session for the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>“We used to do a circle when it was two in the middle and everyone else on the outside,” he said. Whoever was in the middle had to try and get the ball back from the other players.</p>
<p>“I was in the middle because I’d given the ball away as normal. It was all one-touch but Rocky has put his foot on the ball, rolled his studs over it, rolled it over back and then nutmegged me. It was ridiculous. He had incredible ability.”</p>
<p>First impressions were made to count on Greaves and also City supporters. City had won only one of their opening 10 league games in a dismal start to the season under Hateley but Rocastle’s debut inspired a 3-0 win over Scarborough. The midfielder marked his introduction with a goal for good measure, bursting through from deep and finishing smartly.</p>
<p>“The first game against Scarborough he just ran the show,” said Greaves. “It was too easy for him. It was probably something we’d not seen before. He had an aura about him. The crowd absolutely adored him.”</p>
<p>“For any fan at that time, what they were witnessing had been pretty bleak,” added Lowthorpe. “The chance to see someone like David for their team was probably a huge highlight. That’s why his time here was so memorable.”</p>
<p>Lowthorpe has his own reasons to remember Rocastle fondly after replacing the midfielder in a 3-0 win over Doncaster at Boothferry Park.</p>
<p>“He’d been struggling with an injury so Mark Hateley says to me that I’m coming on,” explains Lowthorpe. “The ball goes out for a goal kick to them, David Rocastle comes off and I come on.</p>
<p>“Literally, as soon as the keeper kicks the ball the ref blows the whistle for full-time. The lads obviously think it’s hilarious and I’m getting stick from them but I thought nothing more of it.</p>
<p>“I got to training on the Monday morning and David comes up to me and says ‘Adam, have you got a minute?’ He just wanted to say how sorry he was about Saturday. ‘I didn’t mean to disrespect you, if I’d have known how long was left I’d have just stayed on.’</p>
<p>“I hadn’t given it a second thought and there he was saying how much it had bothered him all weekend. He was an ex-England international and I’m a scruffy kid, the fact he felt the need to apologise tells you everything about what his values were as a person.”</p>
<p>Rocastle was not the miracle worker that City had needed but he made a telling difference to a struggling side. Four of his 10 league starts helped to bring wins, including the only away victory of the season at Cambridge United. Rocastle brought a sense of calm and no end of advice.</p>
<p>“He was just a class act,” said Fewings. “He wasn’t a shrinking violet in any way if you weren’t playing as you should do but he’d always look to encourage you as well.</p>
<p>“The culture at that time was all about shouting and bawling. I didn’t really respond to that very well but Rocky would massively settle me down on the pitch. He was a real calming influence.</p>
<p>“My mum used to keep all the newspaper cuttings and there was one where Rocky had something nice about me. I walked around feeling 10 feet tall after that.”</p>
<p>Injuries, though, were taking their toll on Rocastle. Training sessions were missed to manage his work-load, while every game would end with the midfielder packing ice around his knee.</p>
<p>“At times it was clear he’d almost been playing on one leg,” said Greaves. “His knee would swell right up. It was almost like another half a knee. He must’ve been in a lot of pain. I know he didn’t play many games for us, 10 or 11, but he was someone who still had a massive impact.”</p>
<p>Rocastle’s final appearance for City – a 2-1 defeat at home to Chester on Boxing Day of 1997 – also proved to be his last in English football. The end of that season saw him released by Chelsea, paving the way for him to join Malaysian team Sabah on a free transfer.</p>
<p>Rocastle was finally forced to admit defeat in his battles against injury when retiring in December 1999 before tragedy struck two years later. A month after announcing he was suffering from non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma, an aggressive form of cancer, he passed away at the age of 33. This Tuesday marks the 19th anniversary of his death.</p>
<p>“It was so sad but if his kids ever need to know what their Dad was about they only have to put a few videos on,” said Greaves. “He’ll never be forgotten.”</p>

<p>Here are your Arsenal headlines for the morning of Tuesday, March 31.</p>
<p>Remembering Rocky</p>
<p>It is the 19th anniversary of the death of Arsenal legend David “Rocky” Rocastle and his sister Karen has been speaking to football.london about the legacy of the Gunners winger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was just a south London boy from Brockley,&rdquo; Karen said. &ldquo;Rather than mourning his death, we celebrate his life because the fans are keeping his memory alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every year since his passing there has always been a big remembrance for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There’s an American lady that comes over with a massive banner that’s been signed by Thierry Henry and others. She’ll walk around the Emirates with this banner and there are others who sing his chants and they still remember him. That makes it easier for us every year on his anniversary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wolves shut down Raul Jimenez interest</p>
<p>Raul Jimenez will not be available for any price this summer despite interest from Arsenal and Manchester United in the Wolves forward.</p>
<p>According to the Daily Star , Wolves’ billionaire Chinese owners have issued a “hands off” warning to any clubs interested in the 28-year-old, including Real Madrid.</p>
<p>The Mexican, who has scored 22 goals in 45 games this season, is under contract for another three years and the Midlands club have no intention of cashing in on him yet.</p>
<p>Nicholas urges Arsenal to pay Aubameyang whatever he wants</p>
<p>Former Arsenal star Charlie Nicholas says the Gunners should simply pay Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang whatever he wants in order to keep him, even if it means letting Mesut Ozil go in order to afford the Gabon international’s wages.</p>
<p>“While I do believe that Arsenal need to fund a rebuild, my preference would be to offer Aubameyang what he wants,” the former Scottish forward said on The Debate on Sky Sports.</p>
<p>“Is it possible Ozil could move on? Could this then help fund wages for Aubameyang and others?</p>
<p>“If they can get Ozil off the wage bill without getting anything for him, it will not be too much of a detriment.</p>
<p>“They must give Aubameyang exactly what he wants. There simply aren’t many other players like him at that level.”
