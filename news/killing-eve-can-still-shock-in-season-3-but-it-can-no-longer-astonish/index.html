<p>This piece contains spoilers about episode one of Killing Eve season three.</p>
<p>The first episode of Killing Eve’s third season ends on an extremely jarring note, even for a series with an established reputation for rampant murder.</p>
<p>While Eve, who survived having been shot at the end of season two, tries to track down her former colleague Kenny at his new workplace — this season, he leaves MI6 for the exciting and highly stable world of online journalism — his body can be seen outside the window of the building, spiraling from the roof toward the ground. Eve rushes outside and confirms the worst: Kenny, the son of Eve’s former boss, Carolyn, is dead, either because he jumped (seems unlikely?) or was thrown off the roof by some unseen assailant.</p>
<p>There is really only one way to react to this news: Oh my God, they killed Kenny! But seriously, though: Oh my God, they killed Kenny. Major characters usually don’t die in the first episodes of new seasons. The fact that Killing Eve has pulled that lever so quickly and bluntly (and, spoiler, not for the last time), is a sign of how far the show has moved from the elegant sneakiness it achieved in season one.</p>
<p>To be fair, Killing Eve has always loved a good shock. Its very first episode opened with Villanelle (Jodie Comer, whose entire audacious performance is one surprise after another) suddenly and intentionally flipping over a young girl’s bowl of ice cream, followed by a scene in which Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh, portraying a woman’s lack of control with total command) screams repeatedly in her sleep. Unsettling the audience has always been in Killing Eve’s DNA. But so was an ever-present, mordant sense of humor, a slow-burn, see-saw seduction between its two leads, and a commitment to infusing the spy genre with feminine perfume. All of those qualities are what distinguished it from other shows, in the genre and in general.</p>
<p>And those qualities sprang from series creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who also acted as lead wrier in season one. Though she’s still an executive producer, Waller-Bridge has passed that baton to a different woman each season. Last season it was her friend, actress (Call the Midwife, The Crown), writer, and now director (Promising Young Woman) Emerald Fennell. In season three, it’s Suzanne Heathcote, a British playwright who previously worked on Fear the Walking Dead. It’s wonderful that different women are getting this opportunity and being encouraged to pursue their own visions. But inevitably, it leads to a show that, season to season, lacks consistency and has lost the idiosyncrasy that originally defined it.</p>
<p>While season two eventually took off in some wild directions — I found it hard to believe that Villanelle actually wanted to be in some semblance of a real relationship with Eve — tonal connections to season one remained. The humorous asides echoed those in season one. The tango between Eve and Villanelle continued, first from a distance, then close up when Eve clandestinely hired Villanelle to whack her and, later, to go undercover and assist MI6. The violence, while more brutal and heavy-handed, still had a subversive bent rooted in femininity and/or feminine wiles. For example: Villanelle killed a man by complimenting his tie, then gripping on to it while a set of elevator doors closed, transporting him to a death by strangulation. To let Eve know she was responsible for the murder, Villanelle sent Eve a tube of lipstick called “Love in an Elevator.” Naturally, there was a razor blade embedded in it. This was all very Killing Eve.</p>
<p>In season three, Villanelle remains sly and unhinged, but her murders are less inventive. The flashback that opens episode one shows a young Dasha, Villanelle’s former and once again handler, turning a kiss with a gymnastics peer into a bite, and then an efficient beating that leaves the guy dead, if not from the beating than certainly from suffocation due to the mound of chalk she dumps on him. This season, Villanelle’s killings are a lot like that: less calculated and more improvised based on the tools at hand. Later in episode one, in an echo of the flashback, Villanelle kills the proprietress of a shop in Girona by coaxing her up a ladder then pulling it away and dumping a ton of flour on her. In future episodes (I have seen five in advance) Villanelle uses whatever she’s got at her disposal — guns, piano tuners — to get her assassination jobs done. The cleverness in her crimes has been sapped and refilled with, mostly, hardness and pure rage. That may be an intentional choice, a way to illustrate how lost and desperate Villanelle has become. But it also makes Killing Eve much less interesting.</p>
<p>It also works at cross-purposes with a simultaneous effort to find the humanity in Villanelle. We are led to believe in season three that she’s become extra angry in part because she’s heartbroken by Eve’s absence. Future episodes also build upon seeds planted in the premiere regarding Villanelle’s desire to reconnect with her family. Some viewers may be intrigued by a Villanelle origin story, but the mystery around her, the completely inexplicable nature of her psychopathy, is what always intrigued me and, certainly, what intrigued Eve, especially in season one. While Comer remains fascinating to watch — the way she carries herself with simultaneous intimidation and utter irritation while dressed in a clown suit in episode two is a gift — Villanelle as a character has been flattened by the contradictory storytelling.</p>
<p>So too has the magnetism between Villanelle and Eve, the beating black heart at the center of this series. Once these two felt a charge from just the whisper of each other’s presence. When an incognito Villanelle passed by Eve, Eve could feel her in the air even even when she couldn’t see her. That dynamic gave the show a queer sexual energy and raised provocative questions about whether Eve was genuinely attracted to Villanelle or merely attracted to danger. To the show’s credit in season one, it didn’t answer those questions. By the end of season two, though, Killing Eve asked us to believe that Eve had snapped out of her fog of ardor and realized that her feelings for Villanelle, whatever they were based in, would never lead anywhere. Her rejection of Villanelle, and Villanelle’s unsuccessful, as it turns out, attempt to kill Eve created a cul-de-sac that the series is having a hard time getting out of in season three.</p>
<p>Villanelle is still making her presence known to Eve. She leaves her gifts and, at least once, confronts her in a more direct manner. But now, understandably, Eve is afraid of her. What used to be a game of cat and mouse in which the two took turns playing feline and rodent is now, at least in the initial episodes of the season, a situation in which Eve is the mouse who fears that she’s being chased. It also doesn’t help matters that Oh and Comer get very little screen time together. That will likely change in the second half of this season — at least that’s my guess — but that may be too late to salvage this volume in the Killing Eve saga.</p>
<p>It’s unfair to ask Fennell or Heathcote or Laura Neal, the Sex Education writer who has been tapped to lead season four, to repeat what Phoebe Waller-Bridge did in season one. There’s nobody quite like Waller-Bridge, and that’s precisely what makes her such a fantastic storyteller. But Killing Eve should still feel like something distinctive and imaginative, even when the imagination behind it springs from a different showrunner. In season three, it feels like a sense of imagination has been replaced with one of shock, the equivalent of how one feels upon seeing a body suddenly fall from the sky. Killing Eve still knows how to startle us, and for some that may be plenty. But I wish it could still astonish.

<p><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xwprLPS5h32RatztA8GGSL-1200-80.jpg" alt="img">
It&rsquo;s back! Phoebe Waller-Bridge&rsquo;s Killing Eve returns for a third season and its stars Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer are still in the midst of their endless cat-and-mouse game. Ready to jump right back in? Here&rsquo;s how to watch Killing Eve online and stream season 3 no matter where you are in the world.</p>
<p>Killing Eve season 3 cheat sheet Killing Eve premiered in 2018 on the BBC and has already been renewed for a fourth season - so fans can rest assured that 2020 isn&rsquo;t the last they&rsquo;ll see of Eve and Villanelle&hellip;or could it be? Those keen to jump ahead in the plot can always look to the Villanelle novel series, by author Luke Jennings, which serves as the basis for Killing Eve as adapted and produced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s safe to say that Killing Eve was a critical hit when it was first released, one that was praised for the way to cleverly moulded classic elements of suspense with quirky dark humour - the latter being one of Waller-Bridge&rsquo;s specialities.</p>
<p>Prime example, when you see that the new episode of a BAFTA-winning TV show is called &lsquo;Slowly Slowly Catchy Monkey&rsquo; - who else could it really be?</p>
<p>Killing Eve season 3 reviews have been more mixed, but anyone who has gotten this far into the show will no doubt want to see what it&rsquo;s like for themselves - and given the current circumstances in many countries around the world, what&rsquo;s to stop you?</p>
<p>In the US, it can still comfortably rival most of the best Hulu shows around - so follow our guide as we explain all the easiest ways to watch Killing Eve season 3 and stream the show online from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Nerves of steel? Here&rsquo;s how to watch Contagion online</p>
<p>Watch Killing Eve online from outside your country</p>
<p>The coronavirus may have put old paradigms like holidays and work trips to bed temporarily, but the fact is international travel will one day resume in full - and you may even be stuck outside your country of origin, for whatever reason. If and when that&rsquo;s the case, you could be forgiven for wanting a taste of home comforts, especially now.</p>
<p>If that means streaming the services you normally would, geo-blocking can prove to be a major obstacle - but fortunately there&rsquo;s an easy solution. Using a little handy trick, you can get around these pesky digital borders using a VPN. This will allow you to gain access to Killing Eve as it happens by changing your IP to your nation of residence. But which VPN is best for you?</p>
<p>After extensive testing, our personal favourite is ExpressVPN, which lets you change your IP address on pretty much whatever device you have, be it laptop, mobile, Roku, Amazon Fire TV Stick, Apple TV, games console, etc, so that it thinks it is in a different location. We consider ExpressVPN to be the best because it&rsquo;s so easy and straightforward. It also has very fast connections and watertight security. You can try it with a 30-day money back guarantee, or go for a much better value annual plan where there&rsquo;s a massive 49% off and an extra 3 months free. Once you have it, go ahead and open the VPN app, hit &lsquo;choose location&rsquo; to virtually transport yourself home - it&rsquo;s super easy to do. Once you&rsquo;ve changed to an appropriate region, you just need to go to your home broadcaster and then you&rsquo;re ready to watch all the Killing Eve action.</p>
<p>How to watch Killing Eve season 3 online for free in the UK</p>
<p>The BBC is doubling-down on its digital credentials with Killing Eve season 3, airing the hit spy thriller on iPlayer before dropping it on terrestrial TV. This means that in the UK you&rsquo;ll be able to watch the first episode of Killing Eve season 3 online via the Beeb&rsquo;s streaming service on Monday, April 13 - it should be uploaded by around 6am BST, we&rsquo;re told, and subsequent episodes are expected to get the same release date and time. It also means that a large number of people can watch Killing Eve for free - as all you need to stream iPlayer is a valid UK TV license. For more analogue types, Killing Eve season 3, episode 1 will be aired on BBC One at 9pm on Sunday, April 19.</p>

<p>How to watch Killing Eve season 3 online in the US</p>
<p>The US has it even better than UK when it comes to watching Killing Eve season 3 online. That&rsquo;s because the Beeb has given first dibs to its BBC America off-shoot - where the Killing Eve season 3, episode 1 release date is slated for 9pm ET / 8pm CT on Sunday, April 12. The only catch is you can also watch it on AMC at the same time. The good news is that many cable packages offer these channels as part of their bundles - consult your local provider for details. But for cord-cutting types, the best option may be Hulu, which offers both! The popular over-the-top streaming service offers packages starting from just $5.99 a month - and they include BBC America and AMC. Better still, you can take advantage of a FREE Hulu trial period to see if it&rsquo;s right for you. And remember, if you&rsquo;ve mismatched a holiday or just so happen to be out of the US when you want to watch it - you can always use a VPN.</p>
<p>How to watch Killing Eve online in Australia</p>
<p>Aussies have it pretty sweet when it comes to where to watch Killing Eve - ABC&rsquo;s iview streaming service promises the season premiere will be live for streaming on Monday, April 13 at 12pm local time. And as ever, anyone who normally resides Down Under but finds themselves out of the country during this particularly difficult time can use a VPN to reconnect to the services and platforms they would normally use at home.</p>
<p>How to watch Killing Eve online: free streaming guide for seasons 1 and 2</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re new to Killing Eve, then there are worse things to do during a global pandemic than watch the first two seasons of the hit show.</p>
<p>Anyone in the UK or the US has it good, as the BBC show is available on a number of convenient streaming services.</p>
<p>In the US, simply check out a FREE Hulu trial and you&rsquo;ll get the first two seasons of Killing Eve. But do note that you&rsquo;ll need its higher-end Hulu + Live TV package, which normally costs $54.99 a month but gives you on-demand and live access to loads of shows including Killing Eve - get a free Hulu + Live TV trial here.</p>
<p>Although BBC America does also offer its own option for a free season 2 Killing Eve stream - as does AMC to the best of our knowledge.</p>
<p>In the UK, it&rsquo;s all gratis provided you hold a valid TV license in the country - in which case just tune into BBC iPlayer and watch Killing Eve seasons 1 and 2 for free online.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in Australia, you can watch Killing Eve season 1 on Stan - but beyond that you&rsquo;re looking at paying to buy the show via a platform like iTunes.

<h3 id="killing-eve-season-3-review-once-great-series-feels-like-a-copy-of-its-former-self">Killing Eve Season 3 Review: Once-Great Series Feels Like a Copy of Its Former Self</h3>
<p><img src="https://tvguide1.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2020/04/07/3c1e21a4-8d07-464f-b3a3-f3e98deb6d5b/thumbnail/1300x867/06a8bce36d0cb6a9e45e31254ef6705c/200407-killing-eve.jpg" alt="img">
The second season of BBC America&rsquo;s Killing Eve briefly experimented with a thoughtful exploration of its two central characters and the magnetic relationship between them, but it ultimately failed to do more than spin its wheels with plots fabricated to force them onto the same team. By the time Villanelle (Jodie Comer) shot Eve (Sandra Oh) in the back at the Roman ruins in the Season 2 finale — a funhouse mirror of the Season 1 finale in which Eve stabbed Villanelle — it was more than clear that Killing Eve&rsquo;s sparkle that had enraptured the world wasn&rsquo;t just fading, it had all but gone out.</p>
<p>Villanelle tricking Eve into killing Raymond when she had a gun on her body the entire time and could have easily dispatched him revealed a sharp flicker of the terrifying woman within, the madness that initially drew us to her and has regularly made her a delight to watch, but her reaction to Eve walking away from her after realizing the truth of the matter didn&rsquo;t so much emit a gasp as it released a half-hearted shrug. The writing felt strained as the series labored its way through a second season that initially showed promise but eventually came to be held together with a few electrifying moments. So as Season 3 approaches, we wonder: Is it even worth watching? Can the show we all loved be salvaged?</p>

<p>In Season 3, Eve is recovering from her gunshot wound in England, eating and drinking her feelings, and working in the kitchen of an Asian restaurant because it requires little movement or actual thought. She&rsquo;s alive but no longer living. At first it feels like we&rsquo;re in for at least a couple episodes of this wheel-spinning, but as early as the second hour, the murder of someone close to her made to look like a suicide has Eve back in the orbit of MI6 and Carolyn (Fiona Shaw). The show moves quickly at the outset of the season, but the problem is that it doesn&rsquo;t feel as if it&rsquo;s going anywhere interesting.</p>

<p>While Eve and Carolyn and a pair of journalists investigate the murder and its possible connections to the Twelve, Villanelle, believing Eve is dead, has seemingly moved on in other parts of Europe. Of course, we all know that once she finds out the truth, the game they used to play will once again be back on. But for now, everyone&rsquo;s favorite stylish sociopath is once again working with the Twelve, and as one of her conditions for returning to do their shady business, she has requested to become a keeper, a management position that also involves training new assassin recruits.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for us, none of this is particularly interesting. An international assassin killing people in classically beautiful destinations is intriguing and enthralling television, especially when that person is Villanelle; creating one feels like watching an HR management training video about what not to do. To be fair, it&rsquo;s not like the show isn&rsquo;t aware of this; the second episode is literally titled &ldquo;Management Sucks.&rdquo; But even as the show is acknowledging the detriments of so-called promotions, not even seeing Villanelle dress up as a clown for a job with a new recruit has the same spark it probably would have two seasons ago. It feels a little too much like the show is trying too hard to recreate the flashiness of its past even while acknowledging the ludicrous nature of the moment.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s obviously not a spoiler to say Eve and Villanelle eventually come face-to-face once more, or that both women remain conflicted with regards to their emotions and feelings for each other. The show isn&rsquo;t treading new ground, and it won&rsquo;t until someone, it doesn&rsquo;t matter who, makes a move that isn&rsquo;t stabbing or shooting the other and then running away. And that is at the heart of all of Killing Eve&rsquo;s problems.</p>

<p>The first season of Killing Eve felt swift and effortless. Under Phoebe Waller-Bridge&rsquo;s leadership, Eve and Villanelle sparked, and their game of cat-and-mouse propelled the show through a truly thrilling freshman season even if it sometimes felt like someone wrote &ldquo;Hannibal but with women&rdquo; on a whiteboard. Every move they made felt dangerous, and the moments they were together thrummed with a current of electricity. It was always going to be difficult to maintain this aspect of the show — there are still glimpses of it here and there but it&rsquo;s not like it used to be — but the fact the series is cycling through head writers with each passing season makes it increasingly so.</p>
<p>Emerald Fennell bravely took over for Waller-Bridge in Season 2, and now Suzanne Heathcote has stepped in as lead writer and executive producer for Season 3. As each new writer is left to pick up the pieces left by the person who came before, they valiantly try to recapture the magic of Season 1, but the shine only continues to wear off as the characters never seem to move forward in any meaningful way and the narrative doubles down on its least interesting storylines, mainly the shadowy organization known as the Twelve. To quote the great Michael Keaton in Multiplicity, you know sometimes you make a copy of a copy, it&rsquo;s not quite as sharp as, well, the original? That&rsquo;s what Killing Eve now feels like: a copy of its former self. The edges are now duller, the lines less distinct. If there was ever a show that would have benefited from being a limited series, it is Killing Eve.</p>
<p>TV Guide Rating: 2.5/5</p>
<p>Season 3 of Killing Eve premieres Sunday, April 12 at 9/8c on BBC America.</p>
<p>Correction: An earlier version of this story listed Suzanne Heathcote as showrunner. Her title is lead writer and executive producer.
