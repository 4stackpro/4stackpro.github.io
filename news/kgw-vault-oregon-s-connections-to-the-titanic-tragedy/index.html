PORTLAND, Ore. — The RMS Titanic sank to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean 108 years ago this week in perhaps the most famous disaster of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Oregon’s connections to the tragedy aren’t as well known.</p>
<p>Though the ship’s destination was New York, Titanic fever was alive on the other side of the country in Portland.</p>
<p>Before its maiden voyage in April 1912, The Oregonian ran ads for the Titanic. They touted summer trips from New York on “the largest steamers in the world,” which included the RMS Olympic, a White Star Line sister ship to the Titanic.</p>
<p>The size of the ship was a big talker. The Oregonian printed a diagram showing the 882-foot long Titanic stretching across the heart of Portland’s business district.</p>
<p>Four passengers from Oregon bought tickets for the ship’s maiden voyage, and a dozen other passengers were heading to the Beaver state, according to records from Encyclopedia Titanica. Many of them were immigrants from Europe riding in third class.</p>
<p>A SOUVENIR OF ICE</p>
<p>Frank and Anna Warren, first class passengers from Oregon</p>
<p>Encyclopedia Titanica</p>
<p>The most well-known Oregonians on board the Titanic were Frank and Anna Warren, a couple in their 60s in first class.</p>
<p>Frank founded the Warren Packing Co., a fish canning business. He had a salmon fishery in the Columbia River Gorge in a spot that would later become the town of Warrendale, named after him.</p>
<p>Anna was a native of Oregon City and a former teacher at St. Helen’s Hall in Portland, which later became Oregon Episcopal School.</p>
<p>The Oregonian ran a blurb on April 14, 1912, about the couple returning home on the Titanic after vacationing in Europe and Egypt for their 40th anniversary.</p>
<p>Late that same night, disaster hit. The Titanic struck an iceberg and started to sink in the north Atlantic.</p>
<p>Anna told the Oregonian that she heard a grinding noise from their room. Her husband went to see what happened and came back holding a big piece of ice. He said it was given to him as a “souvenir.”</p>
<p>After a lot of assurances from the crew that everything was alright, they eventually made their way out to the deck with other passengers.</p>
<p>Anna was led to a lifeboat. She thought Frank was right behind her, but instead, he was helping other women climb inside. That was the last time she saw him.</p>
<p>She survived and returned to Oregon. His body was never found.</p>
<p>TRAGEDY FOR IMMIGRANT FAMILIES</p>
<p>Svend Jensen, Carla Jensen and Niels Jensen, a family of Danish immigrants in third class traveling to Portland. Only Carla survived the sinking.</p>
<p>Encyclopedia Titanica</p>
<p>Many other Oregon-bound passengers also died, mostly those in the third class. In fact, only about a quarter of passengers in steerage survived.</p>
<p>Every member of a Finish family trying to get to Oregon died, including a toddler.</p>
<p>Helena Rosblom was traveling with her 18-year-old son Viktor and two-year-old daughter Salli to join her husband in Seaside, Oregon. They all perished when the ship went down.</p>
<p>A family of Danish immigrants traveling to Portland had a similar fate.</p>
<p>Niels Jensen, a carpenter who had previously lived in Portland, boarded the Titanic with his nephew, niece and her fiancé. Nineteen-year-old Carla Jensen got on one of the last lifeboats. She was the only member of her family to survive.</p>
<p>After being rescued, Carla traveled back to Denmark and reportedly never left the country again. She died in 1980 and asked to be buried in the nightgown she wore on the Titanic the night it sunk.</p>
<p>‘IT WAS TERRIBLE AND IS TERRIBLE’</p>
<p>Marion Wright and her husband Arthur. Marion was a second class passenger traveling to Cottage Grove, Oregon, to get married.</p>
<p>Encyclopedia Titanica/Gavin Bell</p>
<p>Second class passenger Marion Wright was another Oregon-bound survivor. She was traveling alone to get married to a fruit farmer in Cottage Grove.</p>
<p>She met her fiancé Arthur Woolcott in England before he went to America for work in 1907. The two kept in touch and decided to get married in Oregon, so she bought a ticket on the Titanic.</p>
<p>Like the Warrens, Marion was initially told there was no danger after the ship hit the iceberg. As the situation got more dire, another passenger named Alfred Pain helped her find a lifeboat. He died in the sinking.</p>
<p>Marion claimed she was able to hear the band play “Nearer My God to Thee” as the ship went down.</p>
<p>After being rescued, she wrote a letter to her father while onboard the RMS Carpathia. Of the sinking, she wrote, “It was terrible and is terrible and I don’t think I’ll ever forget it.”</p>
<p>After arriving in New York, Marion made her way to Oregon and met up with Arthur. They were married for 53 years and are buried in a cemetery in Cottage Grove.</p>
<p>LOCAL NEWS COVERAGE</p>
<p>Oregon newspapers from 1912 report on Titanic sinking Morning Oregonian, April 15, 1912 Morning Oregonian, April 17, 1912 The Daily Capital Journal, April 16, 1912 East Oregonian, April 16, 1912 Oregon City Morning Enterprise, April 17, 1912 Morning Oregonian, April 27, 1912 Interview with Anna Warren, Morning Oregonian, April 27, 1912 Ad for the Titanic, Morning Oregonian, April 13, 1912</p>
<p>The Oregonian got word overnight that the ship was sinking. The newspaper’s morning edition on April 15, 1912, included the front-page headline “Steamer Titanic Hits an Iceberg.” The story included details about the ship calling for help and reports about how large the icebergs are in the north Atlantic.</p>
<p>The next day, the Oregonian ran pages and pages full of stories about the sinking, with one headline declaring “Titanic Loss Greatest of All Disasters.”</p>
<p>The Daily Capital Journal, which was based in Salem, ran a massive boldface headline saying “Nearly 1,500 Go Down to Death with Titanic” on April 16. The same day, the East Oregonian declared “United States and England Staggered by Worst Marine Disaster in History of World.”</p>
<p>Oregon newspapers spent days and weeks reporting on the disaster. On April 17, the Oregon City Morning Enterprise ran a story about Anna Warren’s rescue, with the headline “Portland Woman Among the Saved.”</p>
<p>On April 27, the Oregonian published an interview with Warren about her experience, in which she talked about her husband being handed a piece of ice and initially believing he was safe aboard her lifeboat.</p>
<p>A total of 1,496 people died when the Titanic went down, out of more than 2,200 people on board. The last survivor died in 2009.</p>

<h3 id="titanic-remembrance-day">Titanic Remembrance Day</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WPMT/images/32f2a341-254a-4cbb-a79a-c54227237702/32f2a341-254a-4cbb-a79a-c54227237702_1140x641.jpg" alt="img">
The RMS Titanic sank on this day 108 years ago.</p>
<p>Today is &ldquo;National Titanic Remembrance Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a day dedicated to honoring the memory of all those who died when the ocean liner sank in the icy waters of the north Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>Titanic, which was branded as being unsinkable, was carrying over 3,000 passengers and crew members on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York when it hit an iceberg at 11:40pm on April 14th, 1912. The mighty vessel sank 2 hours and 40 minutes later on April 15th.</p>
<p>More than 1,500 people perished in the sinking of Titanic. The disastrous amount of lives lost has been blamed on a litany of reasons, including poor communication and an insufficient number of lifeboats.</p>
<p>For more than 70 years, the wreck of the Titanic laid undisturbed on the ocean floor until it was discovered by oceanographer, Robert Ballard in 1985.

<h3 id="forgotten-victims-of-the-titanic-one-writer-has-traced-her-own-relativers-story-of-survival">Forgotten victims of the Titanic: One writer has traced her own relativer&rsquo;s story of survival</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/15/23/27243512-0-image-a-6_1586989970490.jpg" alt="img">
As she ran through the sodden streets of Southampton, Emily Bessant hauled her two-year-old son, Albert, up on her hip and begged her other children — Charles, 15, Gladys, 12, Florence, six, and Leonard, four — to keep up.</p>
<p>The streets were thronged with women, aprons still on, baking left unfinished, children screaming in their wake.</p>
<p>They had only one refrain in their head: &lsquo;Let his name be on the survivors&rsquo; list &hellip; let his name be there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Heartbroken: Families were left devastated when the &lsquo;unsinkable&rsquo; Titanic sunk</p>
<p>When Emily reached the White Star Line office at the docks, she could no longer move for people.</p>
<p>There were hundreds waiting, shuffling forward, among them boys carrying placards from the local paper with pictures of the wretched ship involved in the world&rsquo;s greatest sea tragedy.</p>
<p>This was April 1912 and the &lsquo;unsinkable&rsquo; Titanic had sunk days earlier on its maiden journey. Emily&rsquo;s husband, William, a stoker who had kept the ship&rsquo;s boilers burning, had been at sea before on the ship the Oceanic.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d come back then. He would come back now, surely. The congregation at the head office began to call out: &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the list? Are there any survivors?&rsquo;</p>
<p>All Emily could do was wait her turn to reach the front. Emily Bessant, then 38, was my greatgrandmother.</p>
<p>In the grainy black-and-white photographs I&rsquo;ve seen of her, she appears stern-faced: a cold, unemotional woman.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if she wept that day. I&rsquo;m an eternal optimist and, if that runs in my family, I imagine her more likely hoping against hope that William would, indeed, come home.</p>
<p>Sadly, he never did. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard the Titanic, more than 1,500 died.</p>
<p>The not knowing must have been agonising. And a couple of weeks after the tragedy, Emily received a letter stating that William, 40, had been &lsquo;lost at sea&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The demise of the world&rsquo;s most opulent ship is well known — so, too, are the hubristic claims that it could never sink.</p>
<p>So far, films and books have focused on the people who lost their lives.</p>
<p>From the much-feted aristocrats who gave up their lifeboat places to women and children to those far poorer, for whom there wasn&rsquo;t room anyway.</p>
<p>One of my earliest memories is of my father watching the film A Night To Remember, and saying: &lsquo;Your great-grandfather died on that ship.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As a child, I was haunted by how terrifying it must have been to drown in the dark. It was only when I had children of my own that I realised there was another, as yet untold, story: that of the widows and offspring left behind.</p>
<p>They were the forgotten victims of the Titanic disaster. And their unrecognised bravery is the subject of my new book, The Titanic And The City Of Widows It Left Behind.</p>
<p>At a time when we face our own extraordinary peacetime struggle, there is, perhaps, much to be learned from the quiet, dogged stoicism of women.</p>
<p>The many years between us can make it harder to appreciate that they would have felt grief and distress as keenly as we do today.</p>
<p>Through research and speaking to William&rsquo;s surviving relatives — a cousin and my own sister, along with William&rsquo;s granddaughter, my aunt who&rsquo;s in her 80s — as well as many other Titanic descendants, I became determined to fill in the gaps.</p>
<p>Before the tragedy, Emily and William, who had been married for 20 years, lived with their five children in a two-up, two-down terrace in Henry Road, Freemantle, a suburb of Southampton.</p>
<p>By 1912, William was an old hand on steam ships. Initially, there wasn&rsquo;t room for him aboard Titanic: the ship already had its crew for the boiler rooms, workers from Belfast where the ship had been built.</p>
<p>However, the ship suffered a fire in one of its boiler rooms before she even left Belfast, causing some crew to give up their positions.</p>
<p>Despite this bad omen, William jumped at the chance of a job at the 11th hour.</p>
<p>With a wife and five children to feed, he was under constant pressure to seek work.</p>
<p>Emily&rsquo;s role, meanwhile, was to keep house, look after the children and feed everyone, on a meagre, sometimes non-existent, budget.</p>
<p>Hollywood version: Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet starred in the James Cameron movie Titanic</p>
<p>Families were tightly packed, cheek-by-jowl, in terrace houses.</p>
<p>Laundry hung in the streets, women scrubbed their front doorsteps while their children played outside.</p>
<p>The Titanic, by contrast, was unimaginably opulent with a grand neoclassical staircase hewn from English oak, Turkish baths, a swimming pool, gym and lounge modelled on the Palace of Versailles.</p>
<p>The price of a first-class ticket started at £30, around £2,820 today.</p>
<p>But even a third-class passage cost £7 — £659 today.</p>
<p>My father, who died in 2005, told me his mother had said Emily and her five children were among a crowd of thousands at Southampton docks to wave Titanic off on her voyage to New York on April 10, 1912.</p>
<p>William would already have been at work, deep in the bowels of the ship, stoking the furnaces to power the mighty vessel as she set sail.</p>
<p>On April 14, as Titanic sailed through the North Atlantic Ocean, seven iceberg warnings were received via wireless from nearby ships.</p>
<p>Titanic was sailing into dangerous waters, but nothing was done to change course.</p>
<p>Devastated: Emily Bessant with three of their children who lost her husband William on the famous ship</p>
<p>That evening, the ship&rsquo;s notables dined on rich food and chatted late into the night.</p>
<p>Perhaps they felt strange vibrations beneath them; they had merely been told that the captain planned to reach New York early to dazzle the world once more.</p>
<p>By 11.40pm, the lookout, Frederick Fleet, was staring out from the crow&rsquo;s nest and into the freezing darkness.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have a pair of binoculars. But he suddenly saw something terrible. Iceberg. He rang the bell and called the bridge: &lsquo;Iceberg! Right ahead!&rsquo; In Southampton, meanwhile, Emily was getting her five children up for the day.</p>
<p>Her eldest son, Charlie, went off to his job as an errand boy and Emily served up breakfast.</p>
<p>Gladys, Florence and Leonard set off for school, while two-year-old Albert played on the floor.</p>
<p>In our world of instant news, social media and live-streams of worldwide events, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine that, while Titanic languished at the bottom of the North Atlantic, reports of the tragedy were still unconfirmed in Southampton.</p>
<p>Then, on Monday, April 15, people began to talk, to relay confusing messages from house to house and street to street.</p>
<p>The Titanic had hit an iceberg&hellip; TheTitanic sank&hellip;Everyone aboard saved&hellip;Many dead&hellip; Emily and the other wives made daily trips to see the lists revealing those who had died and survived.</p>
<p>By April 18, several days after news had reached the city of the disaster, she knew William was missing at sea. Instead of slumping into griefstruck lethargy, she started taking in neighbours&rsquo; washing to earn money to feed her children.</p>
<p>The Southampton streets seemed to ooze grief and despair, with woeful children — my grandmother, Florence among them — returning from school to their fatherless homes.</p>
<p>A resident recalled: &lsquo;A great hush A s she ran through the sodden streets of Southampton, Emily Bessant hauled her two-year-old son, Albert, up on her hip and begged her other children — Charles, 15, Gladys, 12, Florence, six, and Leonard, four — to keep up.</p>
<p>The streets were thronged with women, aprons still on, baking left unfinished, children screaming in their wake. They had only one refrain in their head: &lsquo;Let his name be on the survivors&rsquo; list &hellip; let his name be there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Doomed: William Bessant was described as &lsquo;lost at sea&rsquo; in a letter to his loved ones</p>
<p>When Emily reached the White Star Line office at the docks, she could no longer move for people.</p>
<p>There were hundreds waiting, shuffling forward, among them boys carrying placards from the local paper with pictures of the wretched ship involved in the world&rsquo;s greatest sea tragedy.</p>
<p>This was April 1912 and the &lsquo;unsinkable&rsquo; Titanic had sunk days earlier on its maiden journey. Emily&rsquo;s husband, William, a stoker who had kept the ship&rsquo;s boilers burning, had been at sea before on the ship the Oceanic.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d come back then. He would come back now, surely.</p>
<p>The congregation at the head office began to call out: &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the list? Are there any survivors?&rsquo; All Emily could do was wait her turn to reach the front.</p>
<p>Emily Bessant, then 38, was my greatgrandmother. In the grainy black-and-white photographs I&rsquo;ve seen of her, she appears stern-faced: a cold, unemotional woman. I don&rsquo;t know if she wept that day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an eternal optimist and, if that runs in my family, I imagine her more likely hoping against hope that William would, indeed, come home.</p>
<p>Sadly, he never did. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard the Titanic, more than 1,500 died. The not knowing must have been agonising.</p>
<p>And a couple of weeks after the tragedy, Emily received a letter stating that William, 40, had been &lsquo;lost at sea&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The demise of the world&rsquo;s most opulent ship is well known — so, too, are the hubristic claims that it could never sink.</p>
<p>So far, films and books have focused on the people who lost their lives. From the much-feted aristocrats who gave up their lifeboat places to women and children to those far poorer, for whom there wasn&rsquo;t room anyway.</p>
<p>One of my earliest memories is of my father watching the film A Night To Remember, and saying: &lsquo;Your great-grandfather died on that ship.&rsquo; As a child, I was haunted by how terrifying it must have been to drown in the dark.</p>
<p>It was only when I had children of my own that I realised there was another, as yet untold, story: that of the widows and offspring left behind.</p>
<p>They were the forgotten victims of the Titanic disaster.</p>
<p>And their unrecognised bravery is the subject of my new book, The Titanic And The City Of Widows It Left Behind.</p>
<p>At a time when we face our own extraordinary peacetime struggle, there is, perhaps, much to be learned from the quiet, dogged stoicism of women.</p>
<p>The many years between us can make it harder to appreciate that they would have felt grief and distress as keenly as we do today.</p>
<p>Through research and speaking to William&rsquo;s surviving relatives — a cousin and my own sister, along with William&rsquo;s granddaughter, my aunt who&rsquo;s in her 80s — as well as many other Titanic descendants, I became determined to fill in the gaps.</p>
<p>Before the tragedy, Emily and William, who had been married for 20 years, lived with their five children in a two-up, two-down terrace in Henry Road, Freemantle, a suburb of Southampton.</p>
<p>By 1912, William was an old hand on steam ships. Initially, there wasn&rsquo;t room for him aboard Titanic: the ship already had its crew for the boiler rooms, workers from Belfast where the ship had been built.</p>
<p>However, the ship suffered a fire in one of its boiler rooms before she even left Belfast, causing some crew to give up their positions.</p>
<p>Despite this bad omen, William jumped at the chance of a job at the 11th hour. With a wife and five children to feed, he was under constant pressure to seek work.</p>
<p>Emily&rsquo;s role, meanwhile, was to keep house, look after the children and feed everyone, on a meagre, sometimes non-existent, budget.</p>
<p>Families were tightly packed, cheek-by-jowl, in terrace houses. Laundry hung in the streets, women scrubbed their front doorsteps while their children played outside.</p>
<p>The Titanic, by contrast, was unimaginably opulent with a grand neoclassical staircase hewn from English oak, Turkish baths, a swimming pool, gym and lounge modelled on the Palace of Versailles.</p>
<p>The price of a first-class ticket started at £30, around £2,820 today. But even a third-class passage cost £7 — £659 today. My father, who died in 2005, told me his mother had said Emily and her five children were among a crowd of thousands at Southampton docks to wave Titanic off on her voyage to New York on April 10, 1912.</p>
<p>William would already have been at work, deep in the bowels of the ship, stoking the furnaces to power the mighty vessel as she set sail. On April 14, as Titanic sailed through the North Atlantic Ocean, seven iceberg warnings were received via wireless from nearby ships.</p>
<p>Titanic was sailing into dangerous waters, but nothing was done to change course. That evening, the ship&rsquo;s notables dined on rich food and chatted late into the night.</p>
<p>Perhaps they felt strange vibrations beneath them; they had merely been told that the captain planned to reach New York early to dazzle the world once more.</p>
<p>By 11.40pm, the lookout, Frederick Fleet, was staring out from the crow&rsquo;s nest and into the freezing darkness.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have a pair of binoculars. But he suddenly saw something terrible. Iceberg.</p>
<p>He rang the bell and called the bridge: &lsquo;Iceberg! Right ahead!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In Southampton, meanwhile, Emily was getting her five children up for the day. Her eldest son, Charlie, went off to his job as an errand boy and Emily served up breakfast. Gladys, Florence and Leonard set off for school, while two-year-old Albert played on the floor.</p>
<p>In our world of instant news, social media and live-streams of worldwide events, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine that, while Titanic languished at the bottom of the North Atlantic, reports of the tragedy were still unconfirmed in Southampton.</p>
<p>Then, on Monday, April 15, people began to talk, to relay confusing messages from house to house and street to street.</p>
<p>The Titanic had hit an iceberg&hellip; TheTitanic sank&hellip;Everyone aboard saved&hellip;Many dead&hellip; Emily and the other wives made daily trips to see the lists revealing those who had died and survived.</p>
<p>By April 18, several days after news had reached the city of the disaster, she knew William was missing at sea. Instead of slumping into griefstruck lethargy, she started taking in neighbours&rsquo; washing to earn money to feed her children.</p>
<p>The Southampton streets seemed to ooze grief and despair, with woeful children — my grandmother, Florence among them returning from school to their fatherless homes.</p>
<p>A resident recalled: &lsquo;A great hush descended on the town because I don&rsquo;t think there was a single street in Southampton that hadn&rsquo;t lost someone on that ship.&rsquo;</p>
<p>An international fundraising operation began. Theatres promised to donate percentages of their takings to the Relief Fund.</p>
<p>Local companies offered to help. Newspapers reported that the Fund must have started to relieve the distress of the bereaved.</p>
<p>But I wonder how true that was. Southampton mayor, Councillor Henry Bowyer, was in talks to set up a relief fund for the &lsquo;distressed dependants&rsquo; of the Titanic crew, but it wasn&rsquo;t achieved overnight.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on April 29, of the 165 rescued members of the crew, 85 arrived at Southampton railway station.</p>
<p>The local paper reported &lsquo;affecting scenes&rsquo;: one unnamed stoker explained how the chief engineer had ordered the stokers to put the fires out on the Titanic,presumably to prevent an explosion, and that the men had continued to do this until &lsquo;the water was up to their waists&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Then their superiors told them to board the lifeboats.</p>
<p>The reason so many stokers had been saved was because only one watch was on duty when Titanic hit the iceberg.</p>
<p>My great-grandfather had been in &lsquo;the next watch&rsquo;, preparing to go to work. Emily read every local and national news report about the disaster.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine how she must have felt reading that interview with William&rsquo;s colleague, a man who did the same exhausting job for the same pay, but had been lucky enough to survive.</p>
<p>Both my father and my aunt told me that weeks after the tragedy, a rich man had knocked on Emily&rsquo;s door, offering to send her eldest daughter, Gladys, to private school in thanks for William helping him survive the tragedy.</p>
<p>Had William died because he had helped another passenger to a lifeboat? Gladys refused the offer.</p>
<p>There is no record of any school fees being paid, or even who the rich gentleman was. But the story was, and still is, a source of family pride.</p>
<p>In newspaper articles from the time, women were often reported saying proudly that her man had &lsquo;done his duty&rsquo; and had died bravely as a hero.</p>
<p>Believing your loved one had not simply died because he was the lowest member of crew and statistically had no chance of making it, but had perished because he had saved others in doing his duty, meant that a feeling of pride could replace grief.</p>
<p>While the news was full of men&rsquo;s heroism, it was largely forgotten that three female crew members also lost their lives. Of 23 female stewardesses, a matron and cashiers, Lucy Violet Snape, Catherine Jane Wallis and Catherine Walsh, didn&rsquo;t make it home.</p>
<p>Were these women, then, heroines, like their male colleagues? Or were they, in fact, victims because women and children should have been rescued first?</p>
<p>Early feminists argued that the loss of the Titanic and men&rsquo;s heroic acts saving the &lsquo;weaker sex&rsquo; set the movement back years.</p>
<p>When the Relief Fund was eventually set up in spring 1913, the bereaved women became Titanic Widows — they had to live up to their mythical status of grieving, pure, God-fearing wives, grateful for the public&rsquo;s sympathy.</p>
<p>A &lsquo;lady visitor&rsquo; was employed to check up on them, to see they weren&rsquo;t wasting money on alcohol or falling into disrepute.</p>
<p>Emily Bessant is mentioned in passing in the Titanic Relief Fund minute books.</p>
<p>She received sixpence a week — about £60 today — for her and her five children.</p>
<p>It was written that her allowance should continue, providing a report on her was &lsquo;satisfactory&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Since she continued to receive her award, her lifestyle seems to have been deemed acceptable.</p>
<p>She never remarried — at which point the allowance would have stopped — nor did she have any other relationship or fall pregnant again.</p>
<p>Emily seems to have quietly, almost invisibly, carried on.</p>
<p>She gradually stopped taking in laundry and went on to run a sweet shop and even purchased a charabanc, which her eldest son, Charles, drove, taking paying customers on outings.</p>
<p>I do wonder whether she ever allowed herself some quiet time at night to reflect on her feelings and how her life had turned out.</p>
<p>As my aunt Doreen told me of Florence&rsquo;s recollections of Emily: &lsquo;My mother didn&rsquo;t talk about her crying. She just got on with it — she had to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All these years later, I can&rsquo;t help but feel a quiet pride at how my great-grandmother calmly carried on for the sake of her children.</p>
<p>In my view, her bravery — and that of the many other bereaved wives and their offspring — is just as laudable as that of those who went down with the doomed ship.</p>
