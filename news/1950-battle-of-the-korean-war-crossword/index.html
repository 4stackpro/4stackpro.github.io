<p>SEOUL, South Korea — Gunshots fired from North Korea struck a guard post in South Korea on Sunday inside the Demilitarized Zone separating the two countries, and South Korean soldiers fired back, the South’s military said.</p>
<p>There were no casualties reported on the South Korean side, the country’s military said in a brief statement.</p>
<p>The tense, 155-mile border is the most militarized in the world. The South said it was contacting the North through a military hotline to prevent the situation from escalating. It remained unclear why the North fired the shots.</p>
<p>In an interview on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the gunshots were likely “accidental.”

ON DESPERATE GROUND: The Epic Story of Chosin Reservoir — the Greatest Battle of the Korean War, by Hampton Sides. (Anchor, 402 pp., $17.) This account of the 1950 battle in which 20,000 Marines were trapped and vastly outnumbered in subzero temperatures in the mountains of North Korea — yet fought successfully all the way to the sea — recreates what many consider an all-time great military operation.</p>
<p>THE PAPER WASP, by Lauren Acampora. (Grove, 288 pp., $16.) In this debut novel, two women’s friendship takes a dark turn when one becomes a movie star and the other follows her to Hollywood. “Take ‘The Talented Mr. Ripley,’ cross it with ‘Suspiria,’ add a dash of ‘La La Land’ and mix it all at midnight and this arty psychological stalker novel is what might result,” Vanessa Friedman wrote here.</p>
<p>THE AGE OF SURVEILLANCE CAPITALISM: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power, by Shoshana Zuboff. (Public Affairs, 691 pp., $22.99.) Zuboff, a Harvard Business School professor emerita, argues that “surveillance capitalism,” in which secretive tech companies collect and leverage our personal data and experiences, is a dangerous development. Our reviewer, Jacob Silverman, called it “intensively researched” and “engagingly written.”</p>
<p>LONG LIVE THE TRIBE OF FATHERLESS GIRLS: A Memoir, by T Kira Madden. (Bloomsbury, 309 pp., $18.) The title of this debut refers to three passionate high school friends, bonded by early loss, who navigate biracial and queer identity, addiction and family reconfigurations. Our reviewer, Tessa Fontaine, wrote that the book is “both devastating and funny.”

Sometimes the revenge killings were fueled not just by political ideology, but also by prewar family feuds. Villagers often wiped out entire families so that there would be no one left to retaliate.</p>
<p>After the war ended, those murdered by the Communist invaders and leftist vigilantes were treated like martyrs in South Korea.</p>
<p>But military dictators who ruled South Korea after the war banned any public discussion of the atrocities committed by the South Korean police and right-wing vigilantes. The police put the victims’ families under surveillance and kept secret files on them into the 1980s. The families themselves hid their backgrounds, fearful of the stigma of being labeled the “reds’ offspring.”</p>
<p>Today, many victims remain buried where they were executed and dumped nearly seven decades ago.</p>
<p>“There is still a leftist-rightist tension at the bottom of our society, with the red stigma not yet removed and many people deeply uncomfortable with any attempt to excavate the past,” Mr. Park said. “One way of healing the wounds that still divide our society is to recover the remains and return them to their families.”</p>
<p>Mr. Park, a Seoul native, was a history major and aspiring journalist at Yonsei University in Seoul when he fell in love with archaeology while interning in a museum. But he had little inkling that he would become involved with Korean War remains when he returned home in 1989 with a doctorate in human osteology from the University of California at Berkeley and began teaching at Chungbuk National University.

Blinking Owl Distillery produces just 1,000 bottles a week of its vodka, gin and other spirits handcrafted from organic grains out of its repurposed corrugated metal hut in a Santa Ana industrial district.</p>
<p>So, after government orders forced the microdistillery to close March 17 and owners Robin and Brian Christenson furloughed four bartenders from its tasting room, they were thrilled to get a call from Orange County. Would the distillery be interested in producing some critically needed hand sanitizer?</p>
<p>“It’s an entirely different business and regulations, but a couple of weeks ago when we saw that the Purell shortage was going on, we thought about it and were like, ‘Wait a minute, we make high-proof alcohol. We could do this,’” said Robin, whose husband, Brian, has taken to calling their product “craft small-batch hand sanitizer.”</p>
<p>The couple expect they can sell some 4,000 gallons a week for first responders and buyers such as hospitals, which have ordered it by the drum. They plan on lowering costs by making it from corn, and if sales keep the lights on and their single distiller employed, that’s good enough for them. It’s also good enough for the federal government, which has been trying by hook or by crook to increase supplies.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The federal Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau has issued emergency regulations allowing distillers to begin immediate production, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued its own relaxed guidelines for companies not licensed or registered as drug manufacturers to produce sanitizer.</p>
<p>Blinking Owl isn’t the only distillery that has moved into sanitizer. Spirits giant Pernod Ricard was lauded by President Trump for cranking out big volumes of the virus killer, while companies in different industries are switching to producing other critically needed supplies as the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, exceeded 100,000 and deaths topped 1,700 in the United States on Friday evening.</p>

<p>Los Angeles apparel companies are making masks, as is Hanesbrands Inc., a large North Carolina manufacturer of underwear. It will start making FDA-approved nonsurgical masks as part of a consortium that could produce as many as 6 million per week, while companies such as Apple and Facebook are donating to healthcare workers millions of reserve masks they have stockpiled.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>General Motors is working with Ventec Life Systems to radically increase its production of ventilators, with the two companies announcing Friday — amid a public tussle with Trump, who wants them delivered faster and cheaper — that the automaker will build the devices at GM’s Kokomo, Ind., manufacturing facility and ship them as soon as next month. GM said it will also be making FDA-cleared Level 1 surgical masks at its Warren, Mich., plant.</p>
<p>Ford and Toyota also have said they‘re working with medical device makers to produce ventilators and other equipment, while Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has tweeted that he’s working with Medtronic to build ventilators and will reopen a New York factory to assist in production.</p>
<p>Call it war mobilization.</p>
<p>The unprecedented $2-trillion stimulus package Trump signed Friday is roughly twice the size of what was adopted in response to the 2007-08 financial crisis amid a record surge this week of 3.3 million unemployment claims.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Trump has cast himself as a wartime president, saying, “In a true sense we’re at war and we’re fighting an invisible enemy.”</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) frames it this way: “A fight has arrived on our shores.”</p>
<p>The response so far doesn’t approach the Chinese government’s construction of two hospitals in a little over a week to treat COVID-19 patients, let alone the U.S. response during World War II, when Detroit automakers were ordered to stop passenger car production and put all their resources into tanks, military trucks, jeeps and other war materiel.</p>
<p>But with California Gov. Gavin Newsom projecting the state may be short 17,000 hospital beds and New York officials fearing the city and state may be overwhelmed with cases, there have been calls even from Republicans for a stronger federal response through the utilization of a Korean War-era act to order companies to ramp up production of critical supplies — something Trump finally did Friday with a single company, GM.</p>

<p>“If I had the power, I would do it in New York state because the situation is that critical” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said during a March 22 briefing .</p>

<p>The Defense Production Act, modeled after the broad war powers President Franklin D. Roosevelt was handed during World War II, gives the government authority to purchase and distribute critically needed supplies before other buyers, and even order companies to produce goods on an emergency basis.</p>
<p>Trump signed an executive order March 18 giving Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar authority to put the act to use against the virus outbreak. But it was not until Friday that he told Azar to order GM to “accept, perform, and prioritize Federal contracts for ventilators,” contending that “GM was wasting time” and the action would save lives.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Friday’s order came despite pushback from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the president’s own misgivings. Last Sunday, Trump said, “We’re not a country based on nationalizing our business,” though the government doesn’t have the authority to take ownership of a company under the act, even if it can direct operations.</p>
<p>The 1950 law was signed by President Truman after the outbreak of hostilities on the Korean peninsula and was intended to rapidly build up the military. It had other provisions, including wage and price controls, that have since been rescinded, but others have remained in place or even been strengthened.</p>
<p>For example, the U.S. has invoked a provision of the act to rebuild its rare-earth metals industry, which is now controlled by China but is critical to the manufacture of cellphones, missiles and wind turbines. Another provision allows national security reviews of private businesses and transactions such as the popular social media platform TikTok, which is being probed for its ties to China .</p>
<p>Though the law stems from the Korean conflict, it is the Second World War that perhaps more closely mirrors the global battle that has broken out against the coronavirus, which has spread to every continent except Antarctica and chased billions of people out of their workplaces and into their homes.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>In response to the Nazi aggression in Europe and the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, the U.S. created an alphabet soup of federal agencies that rivaled the New Deal. Among them were the War Production Board, the Office of War Mobilization, the Office of Price Administration and the War Food Administration.</p>
<p>Yet the government nearly fumbled the ball at first, trying to lure the private sector into building a war machine using financial tools such as tax incentives and accelerated write-offs of capital investments, said Alexander Field, an economics professor at the Leavey School of Business at Santa Clara University.</p>
<p>“It was not ‘snap our fingers, we are going to build 100,000 aircraft,’” said Field, who is now writing an economic history of the period and sees parallels to today’s struggle against the coronavirus. “Many manufacturers did not want to use their own funds to build specialized facilities and acquire special-purpose machine tools to manufacture goods that they knew would have a limited shelf life. We bumbled a lot in World War II, and with a really determined effort we could have screwed it up and lost the war.”</p>
<p>Mark Wilson, a history professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, said the government ultimately realized that the fastest way to get the war materiel it needed was to simply finance the construction of new factories and then have private corporations with expertise run them — so-called GOCO (government-owned, contractor-operated) plants — or to simply guarantee the government would purchase the products the private sector produced.</p>

<p>“If you wait for the private companies and the bankers to calculate whether this is going to make sense for them economically, you can just create artificial delays,” said Wilson, who wrote a 2016 book, “Destructive Creation,” arguing that plants newly built by the government to produce ships, aircraft, tanks and other key materiel played a bigger role in the war effort than conversions of existing plants did.</p>
<p>“They did it remarkably quickly in a matter of months, but it was not something you could turn on in a matter of days,” he said, adding that the pace could likely be increased by modern technology such as computer-aided design and modular construction (which the Chinese used to build their two hospitals).</p>
<p>Today we need gear and supplies such as hospitals and beds, ventilators and masks, test kits and cleaning agents. And even if the production is vast, it would probably amount to a fraction of the $3 trillion or more in today’s dollars spent during World War II by industry and government on manufacturing and equipment, according to one estimate.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Still, World War II can provide a road map, Wilson said, with the government guaranteeing the purchase of medical equipment, and encouraging and overseeing the licensing and sharing of proprietary designs, which was how General Motors and Ford were able to build aircraft engines designed by Pratt &amp; Whitney in the 1940s.</p>
<p>Indeed, today, the big automakers are working with various medical device makers to ramp up ventilator production, while Hanesbrands said it plans to share its mask design with other apparel makers.</p>
<p>Wilson added that “great calamities” such as the Depression and World War II turned out to stretch for years, and authorities should not make the mistake of worrying about overproduction or waste and “not needing it in the end.” Field noted that whatever equipment healthcare providers do not need after the outbreak subsides could be stockpiled by the government for a strategic reserve.</p>
<p>The giant war mobilization effort also had the effect of driving down the unemployment rate, which averaged 9.9% in 1941 but fell to less than 2% as the conflict ground on — a consideration today as millions are being laid off due to the virus outbreak.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Americans also can take heart in how fast the government and manufacturers were able to respond when the U.S. faced a manufacturing crisis in 1942 after Japan invaded Singapore. That cut off 90% of the country’s supply of natural rubber, forcing the U.S. to establish a synthetic rubber industry at breakneck speed.</p>
<p>“We had no domestic sources of natural rubber. That was a real potential catastrophe. It was close,” Field said, noting the government’s Defense Plant Corp. ultimately spent about $800 million to build 51 factories that were not privatized until 1955.</p>
<p>Jerry McGinn, a former Defense Department official who oversaw implementation of the Defense Production Act from 2015 to 2018, said that building facilities under the act requires the government and companies to share the capital investment and companies to document their expenses and pricing so profits are “fair and reasonable.”</p>
<p>After the contract is over, the government turns over ownership to the company for a nominal fee but retains perpetual rights to production when needed.</p>

<p>The current bureaucratic process, involving requests for proposals and other steps, to get rare-earth metals plants built will probably take about 18 months before dirt is even turned. However, McGinn said, the timeline could be sped up to deal with the coronavirus.</p>
<p>“This being the Manhattan Project, you can accelerate dramatically by perhaps half, but it is just not going to happen in a week,” said McGinn, who is now executive director of the Center for Government Contracting at George Mason University’s business school.</p>
<p>Another faster way for the government to contract for what it needs, he said, is for officials to simply “throw money” at an industry, such as by designing and producing goods through pilot projects. “There are lots of different ways that the government can engage with industry to meet a need; some of these are really rapid,” he said.</p>

<p>In his public spat with GM CEO Mary Barra, Trump tweeted Friday that the company “said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, ‘very quickly’. Now they are saying it will only be 6000, in late April, and they want top dollar. Always a mess with Mary B. Invoke ‘P,’” later clarifying P stood for the Defense Production Act.</p>
<p>In their own joint statement Friday, GM and Ventec said that they were working “around the clock” and that retooling of the GM Kokomo facility was already underway to produce more than 10,000 per month, multiple times more than Ventec can make on its own. The statement said the companies had developed a global supply base for the more than 700 individual parts that are required.</p>
<p>Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business, said the auto industry’s initiative highlights how the automakers and their suppliers can “manufacture in large quantities once they get ramped up, once they get the right tools in place to make the actual parts that are needed.”</p>
<p>But he said people often forget in our high-tech society that software can’t fix every problem, something to consider even as GM is working with a ventilator maker using proven, existing designs.</p>

<p>“You have to extrude metal, you have to bend metal, you have to weld metal because there is no such thing as a software ventilator,” he said, adding that it might take at least 30 days to retool factories to get them ready to make the parts.

<h3 id="how-to-actually-use-the-defense-production-act">&ldquo;How to Actually Use the Defense Production Act&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/sOJs8olcPWRtDBeMlY57QXFRkFM=/0x43:2000x1085/960x500/media/img/mt/2020/04/0420_Martin_DPA/original.jpg" alt="img">
Trump began late last month by criticizing GM for “wasting time” and issuing a memorandum directing the secretary of health and human services to require GM to prioritize the government’s requests for ventilators under the statute. According to GM, however, the memorandum had no effect on its already-announced plans to make ventilators at one of its Indiana plants, and the administration has provided no details to the contrary. Last Friday, Trump issued another memorandum empowering the HHS secretary to procure N95 masks from 3M Company, but the administration’s biggest move has been to block the company from fulfilling overseas contracts, prompting 3M to issue a press release warning that international retaliation would result in a net loss of masks available in the United States.</p>
<p>One key takeaway from this ongoing saga is that there is no magic in the DPA’s mere invocation. The question is not whether the administration is invoking the statute, but precisely what that invocation makes possible and whether it serves the country’s complex supply needs. The DPA is a multipart law—not a big stick that forces results from otherwise uncooperative manufacturers, but a set of assorted authorities that enable the executive branch to take on the central-strategist role that no other entity has the information, resources, or mandate to execute.</p>
<p>This might not be obvious when the DPA is viewed through the lens of recent prior use. The New York Times recently highlighted the Trump administration’s reliance on the statute hundreds of thousands of times to prioritize Department of Defense procurements. Indeed, since the law’s passage in 1950, it has been invoked by every administration to prioritize federal contracts or to shore up vulnerabilities in domestic production that threaten the defense industrial base—to secure the supply of titanium sponge, for example, as Trump did by executive order on February 27. These are textbook DPA scenarios, in which the timely delivery of supplies is crucial for military operations, or low return on investment prevents the domestic private sector from developing and maintaining the infrastructure to reliably supply the country with a key industrial resource.</p>
<p>A pandemic that pushes domestic and global production capacity to its limits is an extraordinary circumstance, one that calls for rapid, outside-the-box deployment of all components of the statute, including those that are rarely or narrowly used. Most of these authorities—in particular, the ones outlined in Titles III and VII—were conspicuously missing from Trump’s initial March 13 executive order authorizing the HHS secretary to prioritize and allocate certain resources in the civilian market. As commentators quickly and correctly noted, the order did not actually trigger any concrete federal action; it only declared that health and medical resources needed to respond to the spread of COVID-19 meet the criteria of the DPA. But the order was limited in other major respects as well.

June 25, 1950 The San Diego Union</p>
<p>The San Diego Union-Tribune will mark its 150th anniversary in 2018 by presenting a significant front page from the archives each day throughout the year.</p>
<p>Sunday, June 25, 1950</p>
<p>In 1950, troops from Communist-ruled North Korea opened a surprise invasion of South Korea, resulting in United Nations intervention with U.S.-led troops.</p>
<p>After World War II, the Allies had partitioned Korea along the 38th Parallel. Communists controlled the north, Americans the south. Two independent governments were in place by 1948.</p>
<p>The Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, in 1953.</p>
<p>Here are the first few paragraphs of the story:</p>
<p>NORTHERN, SOUTHERN KOREANS AT WAR!</p>
<p>U.S.-Sponsored State Invaded By Red Forces</p>
<p>Communist Radio Announces Formal Declaration of Hostilities</p>
<p>BULLETIN</p>
<p>SEOUL, (Sunday) June 25 (AP)—Communist troops from North Korea invaded South Korea at dawn today on a wide front, but U.S. military advisers said the invasion was virtually stopped by this afternoon. Heavy artillery fire was continuing, however, as the North Koreans attacked at least 11 points. Tanks supported the attacks on some fronts.</p>
<p>BULLETIN</p>
<p>SEOUL, June 25 (Sunday) (INS)—Communist North Korea today declared war on the South Korean Republic 6 hours after 60,000 Korean troops poured into the republic over a 200-mile front. Four thousand dead were counted within the first few hours of the fighting, a South Korean spokesman said.</p>
<p>SEOUL, Korea, June 25 (Sunday) (UP)—Forces of Communist North Korea launched a series of attacks into the American-sponsored South Korea Republic today and the northern Pyongyang radio said that war had been declared, effective at 11 a.m.</p>
<p>The Moscow-supported North Korean forces attacked in heavy rain after mortar and artillery bombardments which started at 4 a.m., reports to Korean army headquarters said.</p>
<p>Soon after noon, the Communist Pyongyang radio said the North Korean government had declared war on this southern republic. The text of the declaration was in Korean.</p>
<p>TOWN NEAR SEOUL CAPITULATES</p>
<p>A report received at 9:30 a.m. indicated the North Korean forces had taken the town of Kaesong, 40 miles northwest of Seoul. Kaesong is headquarters of the First Division of the South Korean army.</p>
<p>There was no immediate indication of the purpose or extent of the attacks, although reports received here said they were general in the frontier area. The frontier line is the 38th parallel of latitude.</p>
<p>There have been frequent guerrilla-scale clashes between forces of Russian-sponsored North Korea and the South Korean forces—but none, apparently, as large as those reported today.</p>
