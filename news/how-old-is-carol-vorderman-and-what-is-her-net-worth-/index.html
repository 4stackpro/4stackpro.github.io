<p>Carol was born in Bedford on 24 December 1960, which makes her 59-years-old.</p>
<p>After growing up in Prestatyn, North Wales, Carol went to Cambridge University where she studied engineering.</p>
<p>In 1982, her mum applied for Countdown on her behalf after seeing an ad in the paper for a woman with maths skills.</p>

<p>Is Carol Vorderman married?</p>
<p>Carol wed Navy officer Christopher Mather in 1985, but the marriage only lasted a year,</p>
<p>She later went on to marry management consultant Patrick King in 1990 and the pair had two children, Katie, 29, and Cameron, 23, before splitting in 2000.</p>
<p>She is now thought to be single after breaking up with long term partner and pilot Graham Duff in 2016.</p>

<p>Speaking to Closer last year, Carol explained she loves being single, as she said: “Now I know what makes me happy. I love being single.</p>

<p>Has Carol Vorderman had plastic surgery?</p>
<p>Carol has previously denied going under the knife, but did admit to having botox.</p>
<p>One Twitter follower quizzed her about plastic surgery following an appearance on Lorraine, writing: “Settle an argument for me please Carol&hellip; girls in my office saying you can’t look that good without surgery, my argument is you work out a lot and they’re just well JEL.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The star then replied: “Lol… I go hiking two or three times a week… but I do have botox&hellip; and facials…”</p>
<p>Hitting back at claims she has had surgery on her figure, Carol also previously credited her curves to ‘an old pair of leggings’, when she was papped waiting for a taxi last year.</p>
<p>Addressing her 3,393K following, she wrote on Twitter: “Caught ordering an uber today after a meeting&hellip;..an old ⁦@KarenMillen⁩ top and old jeggings from ⁦@marksandspencer⁩&hellip;. but it&rsquo;s the same old Vorders.”</p>
<p>She also previously told Mail Online: “I promise I haven’t had bottom implants. It’s the same old bottom. In my family, loads of us have it: the Vorderman A**e.</p>
<p>“My daughter Katie has it. My nephew has it. We’re all sticky-out-bottom people.”</p>

<h3 id="celebrity-bake-off-carol-vorderman-beats-kelly-brook-in-bubble-bath-battle">&lsquo;Celebrity Bake Off&rsquo;: Carol Vorderman beats Kelly Brook in bubble bath battle</h3>

Carol Vorderman won the battle of the bubble baths on &lsquo;The Great Stand Up To Cancer Bake Off &lsquo;. (Mark Bourdillon/Channel 4)</p>
<p>Carol Vorderman defeated Kelly Brook in the battle of the bubble baths on The Great Stand Up To Cancer Bake Off.</p>
<p>The 40-year-old model and the 59-year-old former Countdown presenter were the latest stars to compete in the Channel 4 celebrity baking show, alongside reality TV judge Rob Rinder and stand-up comedian Mo Gilligan.</p>
<p>Brook and Vorderman both chose to bake cakes in the shape of themselves in a bubble bath for their ‘Guilty Pleasure’ inspired Showstopper Challenge.</p>
<p>The two former winners of Rear of the Year had viewers bubbling over with excitement as they described themselves soaking naked in the bath.</p>
<p>Brook attempted to bake a sponge infused with pink champagne - but it ended up too soggy. So Vorderman championed with her strawberry and chocolate cake, covered with white fondant icing which she poured fresh fizz into for judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith to drink from a straw.</p>

<p>After being awarded the Star Baker apron, Vorderman gasped: “No way. I am genuinely shocked. I’m chuffed. Seeing as nobody expected me to bake a cake again.”</p>
<p>Brook laughed: “Let’s be honest no one was ever going to beat Carol. She can fly a plane for goodness sake.”</p>
<p>Kelly Brook&rsquo;s champagne sponge fell flat with judge Paul Hollywood on &lsquo;The Great Stand Up To Cancer Bake Off&rsquo;. (Mark Bourdillon/Channel 4) More</p>
<p>Hollywood said: “Carol was always going to be Star Baker. But Kelly was a close second.”</p>
<p>Brook left Hollywood and host Noel Fielding blushing as she created the image of her ideal bubble bath scenario.</p>
<p>She said: “My guilty pleasure is to spend a day out in my garden. Then I decide to strip off and have a lovely bubble bath with pink champagne. I have dirty knees because I’ve been out there all day on my hands and knees.”</p>
<p>Criminal barrister and reality TV star Rinder, 41, revealed his guilty pleasure was to read trashy romantic fiction.</p>
<p>He cheekily told Hollywood, 54,: “You have a Jackie Collins male lead-esque quality to you I think.”</p>
<p>Judge Leith told Rinder of his cake: “The theme is trashy novels and it looks like trash.”</p>
<p>Carol Vorderman, Rob Rinder, Kelly Brook and Mo Gilligan were the final celebrities to take part in 2020&rsquo;s &lsquo;The Great Stand Up To Cancer Bake Off&rsquo;. (Mark Bourdillon/Channel 4) More</p>
<p>But she went on: “That is a beautiful tasting cake. You are a natural cake baker, but hopeless decorator.”</p>
<p>Comedian Gilligan attempted to make trainer-shaped cake – admitting he can buy up to eight pairs of trainers a month. It was flavoured with peanut butter and raspberry jam.</p>

<p>Hollywood said: “It does look like a train as supposed to a trainer&hellip; It looks hideous but tastes amazing.”</p>
<p>Rob Rinder confessed his love of trashy novels on &lsquo;The Great Stand Up To Cancer Bake Off&rsquo;. (Mark Bourdillon/Channel 4) More</p>
<p>For the initial rounds the celebrities baked biscuits - with Brook winning praise for egg muffin breakfast biscuits. They also attempted to make cream-filled ice buns in the Technical Challenge. Vorderman was placed first, while Brook came third for making her buns round instead of long.</p>
<p>The celebrity spin-off of the hit baking show in aid of Stand Up To Cancer this year saw stars including Jaws star Richard Dreyfuss, documentary maker Louis Theroux, EastEnders actress Patsy Palmer and singer James Blunt among those taking part.

Carol Vorderman shares the inappropriate thing she did at her wedding The former Countdown star surprised listeners of her BBC Radio Wales show</p>
<p>Carol Vorderman spoke out about her wedding to first husband Christopher Mather on her BBC Radio Wales show this weekend, and apparently she got changed mid-way through the day into something a lot less bride-like.</p>
<p>SEE: 30 of the most beautiful celebrity wedding dresses of 2019</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I did at my first wedding reception,&rdquo; the former Countdown star told her co-host Owain Wyn Evans. &ldquo;I was wearing a dress, right, you know the days when you had the white dress for the day, for the big thing itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carol the year she got married in 1985</p>
<p>Owain replied: &ldquo;Then you got changed, didn’t you? For the night time, because you had a disco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went into the 321 costume department – remember 321 with Ted… You know 321 Dusty Bin?,&rdquo; she told Owain with reference to late comedian Ted Rogers&rsquo; former gameshow. &ldquo;And I found a frock to wear at night time – it was like something they now wear in Strictly Come Dancing. It was entirely mesh with sequins in the right places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She added: &ldquo;So I had this thing that was probably not appropriate for a bride and I got on the stage and sang It&rsquo;s Raining Men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, classic, classic Carol,&rdquo; Owain replied.</p>
<p>Carol married Royal Navy officer Christopher Mather in 1985, but split one year later. Four years after her divorce, she went on to tie the knot with management consultant Patrick King, who she had her two children Katie and Cameron with, but also went her separate ways from in 2000.</p>

<p>The wedding chat on her radio show followed her announcement to donate her private plane to help transport personal protective equipment such as masks to NHS staff during the coronavirus pandemic. She shared her decision on Twitter with the caption: &ldquo;My Mildred and I (my aeroplane N242CV) have had some adventures BUT I want to tell you that right now she is being used by the amazing people at @BAESystemsAir to ferry PPE to where it&rsquo;s needed by our #NHS around the country… #GoMildred #NHSThankYou.&rdquo;</p>
