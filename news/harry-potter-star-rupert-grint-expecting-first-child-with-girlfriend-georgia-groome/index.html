<p>In 2018, Rupert opened up about his wishes to start a family with Georgia and joked about naming his son after his popular Harry Potter character.</p>
<p>He told The Guardian: &ldquo;Turning 30 felt strange. It just doesn’t feel like I’m there yet and I don’t know what the future holds. I’m just going to go with the flow, keep playing interesting characters and see what happens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I’d like to settle down and have kids soon. If I had a son, would I call him Ron? It’s quite a good name, but probably not. And Grint’s a tough name to pair a one-syllable first name with.&rdquo;

<p>He and his longtime girlfriend, Georgia Groome, are expecting their first child</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some absolutely wicked news: Rupert Grint is going to be a dad!</p>
<p>Giphy</p>
<p>On Friday (April 10), Us Weekly confirmed that the former Harry Potter star and his longtime girlfriend, Georgia Groome, are expecting their first child together. A publicist for the pair told the outlet, &ldquo;Rupert Grint and Georgia Groome are excited to announce they are expecting a baby and would please ask for privacy at this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speculation about the couple&rsquo;s baby news began earlier this week, when Groome was photographed in London with a growing baby bump. She and Grint, a notably private couple, previously sparked wedding rumors after they were spotted wearing matching rings last year.</p>
<p>Grint, 31, and Groome, 28, have been dating since 2011. The British actress is best known for playing Georgia Nicholson in the 2008 flick Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging, while Grint is forever beloved for his role as Ron Weasley in the Harry Potter franchise. In more recent years, the actor has beefed up his TV résumé by starring in shows like Servant, Sick Note, and Snatch.</p>
<p>In 2018, Grint opened up about starting a family in an interview with The Guardian. He said, &ldquo;I’d like to settle down and have kids soon. If I had a son, would I call him Ron? It’s quite a good name, but probably not. And Grint’s a tough name to pair a one-syllable first name with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Congratulations to the happy couple on their magical baby news!

Ron Weasley is going to be a dad.</p>
<p>“Harry Potter” star Rupert Grint’s girlfriend Georgia Groome is pregnant with the couple’s first child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rupert Grint and Georgia Groome are excited to announce they are expecting a baby and would please ask for privacy at this time,&rdquo; the actor’s rep confirmed to USA Today.</p>
<p>The expectant parents were spotted walking around London on Thursday with Groome’s baby bump on display, according to the Daily Mail.</p>
<p>While the 31-year-old has been dating the English actress since 2011, the pair have kept a relatively low-profile. Last year, rumors surfaced that they had tied the knot after Groome was spotted wearing a gold band on her left hand. Neither ever confirmed nor denied the marriage reports.</p>
<p>Grint has previously expressed his desire to be a father and even revealed the one name he won’t be giving to his offspring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to settle down and have kids soon,&rdquo; he told The Guardian in 2018. &ldquo;If I had a son, would I call him Ron? It&rsquo;s quite a good name, but probably not. And Grint&rsquo;s a tough name to pair a one-syllable first name with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Grint is widely known for his role of Ron in the “Harry Potter” franchise, Groome rose to fame starring in the 2008 movie &ldquo;Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grint currently stars on the Apple TV+ series “Servant.”</p>
