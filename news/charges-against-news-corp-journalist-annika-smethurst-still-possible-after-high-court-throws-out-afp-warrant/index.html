Charges against News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst still possible after High Court throws out AFP warrant</p>
<p>Updated</p>
<p>A News Corp journalist at the centre of an Australian Federal Police raid on her house which was found to have been invalid by the High Court says the win is a &ldquo;small victory&rdquo; but not the end of the legal battle.</p>
<p>The warrant used by Australian Federal Police officers to search the home of journalist Annika Smethurst last year was thrown out by the High Court on Wednesday, but police will be allowed to keep the materials they seized in the raid.</p>
<p>Key points: The court found the warrant used to search Ms Smethurst&rsquo;s home was not correctly issued</p>
<p>The saga sparked concerns over press freedom, but the court did not rule on that issue</p>
<p>Ms Smethurst&rsquo;s reports examined plans to expand spying powers</p>
<p>The court unanimously ruled the warrant was invalid but was split on whether police should be forced to hand back what they took.</p>
<p>Ms Smethurst&rsquo;s home was raided after the Sunday Telegraph published a story she wrote on plans to expand the powers of the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD).</p>
<p>The story included images of a document created by the ASD marked &ldquo;secret&rdquo; and &ldquo;top secret&rdquo;, leading the AFP to argue Ms Smethurst and the Sunday Telegraph had broken the law by publishing them.</p>
<p>More than a year after the story went to print, the AFP obtained a search warrant for a range of general items belonging to Ms Smethurst and an order she provide her phone password.</p>
<p>The raid sparked a national debate about press freedom, which intensified when AFP officers searched the ABC&rsquo;s Sydney headquarters over a different story the same week.</p>
<p>The High Court unanimously found the warrant was invalid because it failed to specify the offence being investigated.</p>
<p>The court did not consider any other arguments on whether the raid had any impact on the implied freedom of political communication.</p>
<p>The court ordered the AFP pay the costs of Ms Smethurst and her employer News Corp.</p>
<p>Prosecution against Ms Smethurst not ruled out</p>
<p>Speaking after the decision, Ms Smethurst said the High Court&rsquo;s decision provided some relief but was one step on a long path ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wrote this story nearly two years ago … and we&rsquo;ve had an ongoing investigation, an ongoing legal fight, and really although it has been a small victory for me this is far from over,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really something that&rsquo;s been an ongoing stress for myself and for my loved ones and also a huge fight for the media industry and something we have to continue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although we&rsquo;re a step closer today to resolving this, it really hasn&rsquo;t brought any closure for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms Smethurst said she had never intended to become the &ldquo;poster girl&rdquo; for press freedom but was glad her case had ignited discussion.</p>
<p>She said even though her stories were later confirmed when Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton conceded there was a plan to expand the agency to target child sex offenders, it did not change the looming threat of charges against her in the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just because the story is correct it doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that prosecution has not been ruled out for myself or the two journalists at the ABC,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until we have widespread reform there really is no assurance that we can have that we won&rsquo;t be prosecuted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Data from phone quarantined, AFP Commissioner says</p>
<p>AFP Commissioner Reece Kershaw said he respected and accepted the High Court&rsquo;s judgement, and additional measures had been put in place since last year to ensure warrants were properly drafted.</p>
<p>Commissioner Kershaw said it was still unclear whether police could use data obtained from Ms Smethurst&rsquo;s phone during the search as evidence in future cases, including any brought against Ms Smethurst, related to the classified leak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we&rsquo;ll do carefully and correctly is take legal advice, both probably from our in-house legal advice on what we do with that particular material,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this moment, [the data] is quarantined. Investigators are not able to look at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms Smethurst said she was &ldquo;disappointed&rdquo; the High Court did not make an order that the data be destroyed or handed back.</p>
<p>The Commissioner was also quizzed about when there would be a resolution in the ongoing investigation into both Ms Smethurst and the ABC journalists at the centre of the Sydney headquarters raid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of us want to see this resolved as expediently as possible,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wanted to finish it earlier, noting we had to be respectful of both the court processes in the Federal Court and the High Court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said he believed the oversight board considering both investigations would have a decision within &ldquo;weeks&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Case a &lsquo;sorry mess&rsquo;: News Corp</p>
<p>News Corp executive chairman Michael Miller said the case highlighted the need for news organisations to be allowed to challenge warrants against journalists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Federal Police must obey the law, and their raid on Annika Smethurst&rsquo;s home was illegal,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Federal Government must allow media organisations to contest warrants against journalists to avoid debacles like this one occurring again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for the Federal Government to bring this sorry mess to a prompt end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to end Annika&rsquo;s ordeal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lawyers for Ms Smethurst and News Corp argued the court should issue an injunction requiring the AFP to hand back the seized materials or destroy any copies.</p>
<p>While the court was unanimous in quashing the warrant, it was divided over what should happen to the material seized.</p>
<p>The data taken from Ms Smethurst&rsquo;s phone was identified through specific word searches for items including mentions of the ASD and story pitches.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth had asked the High Court to find it should be allowed to keep the material, even if it was obtained illegally.</p>
<p>While three judges said they thought the material should not be kept by police, the majority of the court declined to make an order, meaning police could keep the material for any future possible prosecution related to the case.</p>
<p>The journalists&rsquo; union, the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, issued a statement welcoming the decision, but raised concerns about the court allowing police to keep the documents.</p>
<p>If the case was ever to come to trial, lawyers could argue the data was not able to be used as evidence because the warrant had been thrown out by the highest legal authority in the land.</p>
<p>But no trial is on the horizon, and Attorney-General Christian Porter has said any decision on prosecuting journalists will need to be signed off by him.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the AFP said it was considering the decision and would &ldquo;act in accordance with the ruling&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id="australias-highest-court-rules-against-police-in-raid-on-journalists-home">Australia&rsquo;s Highest Court Rules Against Police in Raid on Journalist&rsquo;s Home</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/ap-images/2020/04/b50fdc92d75f67b8fa6a18e64fedaec6.jpg" alt="img">
Australia&rsquo;s High Court has ruled that a search warrant giving police permission to raid a journalist&rsquo;s home last year was invalid.</p>
<p>Federal police seized data from the phone and computer of News Corp reporter Annika Smethurst when they entered her home in Canberra last June.</p>
<p>The data was seized to help authorities identify the confidential sources behind her April 2018 story alleging the government wanted to expand the intelligence community&rsquo;s capabilities to spy on Australian citizens.</p>
<p>The seven-member High Court agreed unanimously in its ruling Wednesday that the warrant did not state the exact offense Smethurst allegedly committed, rendering it invalid. But the court did not determine whether police must return the data it seized from Smethurst.</p>
<p>FILE - The High Court of Australia in Canberra, Australia, Oct. 15, 2014.</p>
<p>In a statement, Australian Federal Police said it would act in accordance with the High Court.</p>
<p>After the ruling, Michael Miller, executive chair of News Corp. Australasia, said news outlets should be allowed to contest warrants before they are executed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The High Court ruling sends an indisputable message, that the Federal Police must obey the law and that their raid on Annika Smethurst&rsquo;s home was illegal,&rdquo; Miller said in a statement.</p>
<p>The day after the raid on Smethurst&rsquo;s home, federal police executed search warrants on the Sydney-based headquarters of public broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corporation looking for the sources behind the network&rsquo;s report of alleged war crimes committed by Australian troops in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The raids sparked anger by civil liberties groups and media organizations over the issue of freedom of the press.</p>
<p>The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists said after the June raids that the action &ldquo;directly threaten Australia&rsquo;s standing as a country that respects press freedom,&rdquo; and that reporters should be given &ldquo;the legal protections they need to do their job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Journalist groups and rights advocates welcomed parts of the Wednesday court ruling but noted that the decision was based on a technicality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The raid was an attack on the public&rsquo;s right to know what our governments do in our name,&rdquo; said Marcus Strom, federal president of the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, which represents journalists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The warrant has been quashed on a technicality, but the powers that enabled the raid remain,&rdquo; he added in a statement.</p>
<p>Peter Greste, an Australian journalist who has become a press freedom advocate after being imprisoned in Egypt, said in a tweet that the High Court had given &ldquo;a technical ruling that said the [federal police] messed up writing the search warrant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The court did not address press freedom issues. The judgment underscores once again the need for robust protection for press freedom in Australian law,&rdquo; Greste&rsquo;s tweet said.</p>
<p>Some information in the report is from Reuters and AP.

<h3 id="high-court-to-rule-on-warrant-afp-used-to-raid-journalist-annika-smethursts-canberra-home">High Court to rule on warrant AFP used to raid journalist Annika Smethurst&rsquo;s Canberra home</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/11180208-16x9-700x394.jpg" alt="img">
High Court to rule on warrant AFP used to raid journalist Annika Smethurst&rsquo;s Canberra home</p>
<p>Posted</p>
<p>It was a scoop that led all the way to the High Court.</p>
<p>Key points: The AFP raided News Corp political journalist Annika Smethurst&rsquo;s Canberra home in June 2019</p>
<p>Lawyers have challenged the validity of the warrant used by police</p>
<p>The raids on Ms Smethurst and on the ABC, over a separate series of stories, prompted a broader debate about press freedom</p>
<p>This morning, News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst will find out if the High Court is prepared to throw out the warrant used to search her home in June last year.</p>
<p>In April 2018, Ms Smethurst published stories suggesting the Department of Home Affairs and the Department of Defence were discussing a plan to expand the powers of the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) to secretly access data in Australia as well as overseas.</p>
<p>The Federal Government said the story misrepresented discussions, but later the Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton conceded there was a plan to expand the agency, to target child sex offenders.</p>
<p>Two of the stories included images of a document created by ASD, marked &lsquo;secret&rsquo; and &lsquo;top secret&rsquo;.</p>
<p>More than a year later, Australian Federal Police (AFP) officers knocked on Ms Smethurst&rsquo;s door with a search warrant, alleging that she and the Sunday Telegraph had breached the &lsquo;Official Secrets&rsquo; law in the Crimes Act.</p>
<p>Ms Smethurst has never been charged with any offence, and the warrant only includes a general list of items, with an order she provide her phone password.</p>
<p>The key question before the High Court was whether the warrant was valid.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Ms Smethurst identified several flaws, including that it did not specify the crime, and the law it was issued under was invalid because it breached the implied constitutional right to freedom of political communication.</p>
<p>But lawyers for the Federal Government told the court it was enough to identify the kind of offending, and a warrant did not have to specify a charge.</p>
<p>Another key flashpoint was whether, if the warrant was invalid, the material collected by the police should be destroyed or handed back.</p>
<p>Court documents reveal some data was copied from Ms Smethurst&rsquo;s phone, but nothing else was taken from her home.</p>
<p>The Federal Government has asked to be allowed to keep the material in case of any future prosecutions, even if it was illegally obtained, something that was strenuously resisted by Ms Smethurst&rsquo;s lawyers.</p>
<p>Raids prompted broader political debate over national security</p>
<p>The AFP raid on Ms Smethurst&rsquo;s home in June 2019, and another raid on the ABC&rsquo;s Sydney headquarters the following day, prompted a broader debate over press freedom.</p>
<p>Media companies put aside their usual fierce competition, joining forces to lobby the Federal Government for greater protections for journalists and whistleblowers.</p>
<p>The Right To Know Coalition, as it has been called, has argued too much ground has been ceded in favour of national security, undermining the media&rsquo;s freedom to hold the Government and its agencies to account.</p>
<p>Two parliamentary inquiries were established — the Federal Government asking Parliament&rsquo;s powerful intelligence and security committee to investigate the matter, along with a separate Senate probe launched by the Greens.</p>
<p>During the debate, and as the AFP investigations continued, Attorney-General Christian Porter announced police and Commonwealth prosecutors would need his permission to charge and take journalists to court.</p>
<p>Rather than easing concerns about journalists being pursued, lawyers raised fears it would put even more pressure on the media to keep the Government onside with its reporting.</p>
<p>The AFP has denied suggestions the raids were designed to intimidate journalists and whistleblowers, but has admitted the matter could have been handled better.</p>
<p>The ABC unsuccessfully challenged the AFP search warrant over documents which led to its stories, known as the Afghan Files, in the Federal Court earlier this year.</p>
<p>The ABC said it would not challenge the ruling, as it did not believe litigating its way to &ldquo;reforming fundamentally bad laws&rdquo; was the best approach, urging politicians to do that work instead.</p>
