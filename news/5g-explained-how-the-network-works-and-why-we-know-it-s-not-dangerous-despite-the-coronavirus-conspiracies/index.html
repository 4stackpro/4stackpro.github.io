5G explained: How the network works — and why we know it&rsquo;s not dangerous, despite the coronavirus conspiracies</p>
<p>There is no scientific evidence suggesting 5G harms humans</p>
<p>By Rhiannon Williams Tuesday, 7th April 2020, 8:40 am Updated Tuesday, 7th April 2020, 8:41 am</p>
<p>Despite conspiracy theories, there is no scientific evidence to suggest 5G is harmful in its current form (Photo: Getty)</p>
<p>As misinformation spreads across the internet, it&rsquo;s important to be aware of what 5G is and what it is and isn&rsquo;t capable of.</p>
<p>Conspiracy theorists have been setting phone masts in Birmingham, Belfast and Merseyside on fire as unfounded fears over the technology run rampant, distracting emergency services from helping vulnerable people and damaging crucial communications networks during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>What is 5G and how does it work?</p>
<p>Smartphones, telecoms infrastructure, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth all use radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RM EMFs) to communicate with other devices. The way these RF EMFs are used are known as wireless standards, with 5G the fifth major iteration.</p>
<p>5G has been designed to provide significantly faster download speeds than 4G, 3G and its other predecessor networks, alongside a more reliable connection and lower latency (the delay experienced before data transfer begins). Like its predecessors, it uses radio signals over a range of frequency bands to transmit and receive voice and data by communicating with base stations - stationary radio transmitters with antennas mounted on masts or buildings.</p>
<p>5G differs from the previous wireless standards because some of its technologies use higher EMF frequencies and require additional antennas to utilise them.</p>
<p>How do we know 5G is safe?</p>
<p>The radio waves transmitted by base stations are a form of non-ionising electromagnetic radiation falling at the lower end of the naturally-occurring electromagnetic spectrum, which is measured in frequency and wavelength.</p>
<p>Non-ionising radiation includes infra-red, ultraviolet and visible light, FM radio and Wi-Fi signals, and is too weak to break chemical bonds - thus cannot cause DNA or tissue damage. Ionising radiation, conversely, includes gamma and X-rays and can cause cancer and other health issues.</p>
<p>5G&rsquo;s wavelength does not generate enough energy to damage cells and cause tumours or cancer, unlike ultraviolet radiation from the sun, making sunlight a higher risk to your health than 5G.</p>

<p>Additionally, 5G spectrum has actually been used in the UK by the Ministry of Defence, satellite services, Freeview TV and wireless microphones for many years - just not by mobile operators.</p>
<p>The active 5G networks in the country from O2, Three, Vodafone and EE use frequencies primarily between 3.4 gigahertz (a unit of electromagnetic waves frequency measurement) and 3.6GHz. To put that into context, a TV transmission uses frequencies of up to 806 MHz (megahertz), while Wi-Fi is between 2 GHz and 5 GHz. 4G, 3G and 2G services operate on radio spectrum between 800MHz and 2.6GHz.</p>
<p>Public Health England has advised UK network operators to comply with guidelines from the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), a non-profit based in Germany which publishes scientific-based advice on the adverse effects of non-ionising radiation backed by both the World Health Organisation (WHO) and International Telecommunication Union (ITU).</p>
<p>The ICNIRP updated its international guidelines for the protection of humans exposed to RF EMF in March to include updated 5G guidance, with chairman Dr Eric van Rongen stating &ldquo;the most important thing for people to remember is that 5G technologies will not be able to cause harm when these new guidelines are adhered to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the ICNIRP&rsquo;s previous guidelines, which were published in 1998, would have been adequate to provide protection for 5G technologies, the new guidelines ensure it will not be able to cause harm &ldquo;regardless of our current expectations,&rdquo; the body said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The guidelines have been developed after a thorough review of all relevant scientific literature, scientific workshops and an extensive public consultation process. They provide protection against all scientifically substantiated adverse health effects due to [EMF] exposure in the 100 kHz to 300 GHz range,&rdquo; Dr van Rongen added.

<h3 id="british-5g-towers-are-being-set-on-fire-because-of-coronavirus-conspiracy-theories">British 5G towers are being set on fire because of coronavirus conspiracy theories</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aJBCMiVd87470uFnomoQvB6EzRU=/0x333:5600x3265/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19870959/1176353209.jpg.jpg" alt="img">
5G phone masts are being set alight in the UK, after online conspiracy theories have misleadingly linked the cell towers to the coronavirus pandemic. The BBC reports that at least three 5G towers were set alight within the last week, and police and fire services were called to extinguish the flames.</p>
<p>A Vodafone UK spokesperson confirmed to The Verge that four cell towers were targeted in the past 24 hours. Police have now launched investigations into how the 5G towers caught fire. At least one tower in Birmingham, operated by EE, doesn’t even provide 5G services but was still set on fire.</p>
<p>“Our engineers are assessing the cause of the fire at one of our towers in Birmingham. If it transpires that it was arson, which looks likely at this time, then we will work to help West Midlands police identify a culprit,” says an EE spokesperson. “This site served thousands of people in the Birmingham area, providing vital 2G, 3G and 4G connectivity as it has done for many years. We will try to restore full coverage as quickly as possible, but the damage caused by the fire is significant.”</p>
<p>Rumors and conspiracy theories over a link between the roll out of 5G and the spread of coronavirus have been spread primarily through social media networks. A variety of groups exist on Facebook and Nextdoor, where thousands of members repeat false and misleading claims that 5G is supposedly harmful.</p>
<p>One theory claims that the novel coronavirus originated in Wuhan because the Chinese city had recently been rolling out 5G. It’s now supposedly spread to other cities that are also using 5G. These false conspiracy theories neglect to mention that a highly contagious virus would naturally spread more in densely populated cities with access to 5G, and that the coronavirus pandemic has hit counties like Iran and Japan where 5G isn’t in use yet.</p>
<p>There is no scientific evidence that links the coronavirus pandemic to 5G, nor any immediate negative health effects to 5G. Full Fact, an independent fact checking charity in the UK, has explored the claims after a British tabloid newspaper highlighted them recently. 5G uses a higher frequency of radio waves than 4G or 3G, but regulators in the UK have recorded 5G electromagnetic radiation levels well below international guidelines.</p>
<p>This is the consequence of those bonkers Facebook conspiracy theories about 5G. Key workers getting harassed on the street. pic.twitter.com/5z35r6sabp — Charlie Haynes (@charliehtweets) April 2, 2020</p>
<p>This hasn’t stopped these wild conspiracy theories from spreading, though. Some people are even harassing workers laying fiber optic cables for 5G installations, claiming that when 5G is turned on it’s going to “kill everyone.”</p>
<p>UK operators now believe the attacks are undermining the nation’s security. “I’m saddened today to report that vandals have carried out a series of arson attacks on mobile phone masts during this time of national crisis,” says Vodafone UK CEO Nick Jeffery. “This is now a matter of national security. Police and counter terrorism authorities are investigating.”</p>
<p>The apparent arson attacks have clearly caused significant damage that will affect services in Birmingham, just as emergency services at the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) is relying on mobile networks. “I’m absolutely outraged and disgusted that people would be taking action against the infrastructure we need to tackle this emergency,” said NHS director Stephen Powis at a daily UK coronavirus briefing.</p>
<p>The UK government’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) branded the conspiracy theories “crackpot,” noting that it received reports of criminal damage to phone masts and abuse of telecoms engineers. DCMS is calling on social media networks to control the spread of misinformation. “We must also see social media companies acting responsibly and taking much swifter action to stop nonsense spreading on their platforms which encourages such acts.”</p>
<p>Mobile networks are classified as critical national infrastructure in the UK, but one Facebook group was specifically set up to encourage people to burn 5G towers. Peter Clarke, a mobile networks infrastructure expert in the UK, reported the group to Facebook but the company initially failed to remove it. After an increase in attention, the group has since been removed, but many others are still available with false information and thousands of people encouraging others to burn 5G towers down.</p>
<p>5G causes coronavirus because it’s sucking the oxygen out of your lungs, according to a video being spread on Facebook. I want to but the fact people believe this bullshit is genuinely scary pic.twitter.com/kY3g5MJtu9 — Tom Warren (@tomwarren) March 3, 2020</p>
<p>UK regulator Ofcom also warned Uckfield FM, a community radio station, this week for featuring someone with “potentially harmful statements about the coronavirus.” A guest, identified as a “registered nurse,” appeared in a 20-minute segment in February, claiming that 5G is sucking the oxygen out of people’s lungs. The segment also spread the falsehood that 5G and coronavirus are linked. Clips of the radio show have been widely shared on Facebook ever since.</p>
<p>Like many conspiracy theories and disinformation campaigns, Russia may well be at the heart of the 5G health scares. While a large number of Facebook groups have been fueling these theories recently, a New York Times report from last year warned that Russian disinformation campaigns were actively exploiting 5G health fears. RT America, a Russian government-funded TV network, aired a report more than a year ago in which an RT reporter claimed 5G “might kill you.”</p>
<p>These are the types of nonsensical warnings we’re now starting to see on Facebook, and they’re clearly convincing enough to lead some to damage vital national infrastructure. All of this is occurring just as the UK and many countries across the world are battling the coronavirus pandemic. While medical professionals are busy fighting a highly contagious virus, telecoms workers and social media networks are having to fight an equally destructive viral spread of stupidity online.</p>
<p>Update, April 5th 1:30PM ET: Added statements from EE, Vodafone, and the UK’s DCMS.

<h3 id="people-are-saying-coronavirus-is-a-cover-up-for-5g---heres-why-its-not--euronews-answers">People are saying coronavirus is a cover up for 5G - here&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s not | Euronews answers</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/61/04/24/1000x563_cmsv2_068023cd-917d-503d-992b-658aef98285d-4610424.jpg" alt="img">
An increasing number of conversations on and offline have claimed to find insidious links between the roll out of 5G networks and coronavirus.</p>
<p>Claims suggesting that COVID-19 serves as a cover up for health hazards of 5G, or that the technology itself suppresses the immune system are just two of a number of theories in circulation that experts say are &ldquo;baseless&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But celebrities have also joined the conversation, with US actor Woody Harrelson sharing a post on Instagram that linked 5G to the pandemic, and TV personality Jason Gardiner suggesting the World Health Organisation had warned against the mobile network due to the illness.</p>
<p>In the UK, the situation further intensified after reports that at least one phone mast was suspected to have been deliberately set on fire.</p>
<p>Woody Harrelson shared a post to Instagram making a link between 5G and the virus 2019 Invision Richard Shotwell</p>
<p>Network provider EE told Euronews in an email that its engineers were currently assessing the cause of a blaze at a mast in Birmingham that had caused &ldquo;significant damage&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The company said: &ldquo;If it transpires that it was arson, which looks likely at this time, then we will work to help West Midlands Police identify a culprit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To deliberately take away mobile connectivity at a time when people need more than ever to stay connected to each other is a reckless, harmful and dangerous thing to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will try to restore full coverage as quickly as possible, but the damage caused by the fire is significant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>West Midlands Police are yet to confirm the cause.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Burn all the 5G masts down&rsquo;</p>
<p>A video that allegedly showed the fire was shared in a local Facebook group, in which one user replied: &ldquo;Good!! All these need to get burnt down!! Coronavirus is just a cover up&hellip; its 5G killing everyone. Its too powerful. These all need to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another user said: &ldquo;Get them all taken off or burn them. Save lives - simple reason if police ask what made you do it. Simple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lives are precious and these material things are destroying life. Shame on government knowing what is going on in the world but keeping quiet and blaming rats and bats in China.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So - with this furore, is there actually any truth to the claims? And if so, should we be concerned?</p>
<p>What is 5G?</p>
<p>5G is a wireless mobile network that was deployed in 2019 to help improve telecommunications and mobile connectivity.</p>
<p>It works at a higher wave frequency than its predecessors in order to allow for this upgrade in usage.</p>
<p>What are the claims relating to 5G being harmful to health?</p>
<p>Prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, there were already discussions about the effects 5G could have on a person&rsquo;s health, due to these higher frequencies and the type of radiation it emits.</p>
<p>But since the outbreak, the 5G conversation seems to have found itself linked to the disease with people claiming it could exacerbate the spread through its frequencies, or by suppressing the immune system.</p>
<p>Others have claimed the virus is, in fact, being used to cover up dangerous effects of the mobile network.</p>
<p>So - is 5G linked to coronavirus?</p>
<p>The short answer is no.</p>
<p>In fact, the UK government has gone further to say there is &ldquo;absolutely no credible link&rdquo; between the two.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mobile UK, a trade union for British mobile providers, also commented on the &ldquo;baseless&rdquo; claims that it said were &ldquo;not grounded in accepted scientific theory&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More worryingly,&rdquo; it added: &ldquo;Some people are also abusing our key workers and making threats to damage infrastructure under the pretence of claims about 5G.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not acceptable and only impacts on our ability as an industry to maintain the resilience and operational capacity of the networks to support mass home working and critical connectivity to the emergency services, vulnerable consumers and hospitals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yusuf Sambo, a researcher at the University of Glasgow who is testing 5G in Scotland, told AFP that while he could acknowledge other health fears, they had nothing to do with viruses.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;Yes, there are fears about the health implications of 5G but they have to do with cancer and not viral infections.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is 5G linked to any health hazards at all?</p>
<p>Electromagnetic waves emit electromagnetic radiation, which at high frequencies are believed to pose a risk of causing cancer.</p>
<p>However, low frequencies - such as 5G frequencies - produce a non-ionising form of radiation that is not thought to be able to penetrate and damage cells.</p>
<p>5G frequencies may be higher than that of 4G and other earlier networks, but they are still far lower than the limits stipulated in international guidelines.</p>
<p>The World Health Organisation, which has a detailed guide on the mobile network, said &ldquo;no adverse health effect has been causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies&rdquo;, even after &ldquo;much research&rdquo; was carried out.</p>
<p>It noted that only a few studies had been carried out on the frequencies used by 5G, but &ldquo;provided that the overall exposure remains below international guidelines, no consequences for public health are anticipated.&rdquo;
