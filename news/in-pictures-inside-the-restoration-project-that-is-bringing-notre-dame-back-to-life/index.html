On April 15, 2019, flames engulfed Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, destroying its roof, toppling its spire and leaving millions of people across the globe devastated.</p>
<p>Donations quickly flooded in to help restore the world&rsquo;s most famous gothic landmark, work that has now had to be halted due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The restoration is being managed by construction experts Pierrenoel, alongside specialist scaffold and rigging companies. Pierrenoel&rsquo;s president, Didier Durand, spoke to Euronews about how the project was progressing prior to the lockdown.</p>
<p>Durand described Notre-Dame as &ldquo;both the most beautiful and the most observed building site in the world today.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still in danger</p>
<p>One of the main consequences of the fire was the loss in structural stability in the cathedral due to the collapse of its roof, Durand said. The limestone absorbed water used in extinguishing the fire, while some of the stonework has been damaged by the flames.</p>
<p>Much work has had to be done to ensure that other parts of the building do not collapse, including removing the statues that were taken down from the north, south and west gables.</p>
<p>Chimeras and balustrades which were at risk of falling onto the vaulted ceiling were removed from the south and west corners of the south tower where the stonework was badly damaged by the fire.</p>
<p>Climbers had to assess the damage to some of Notre Dames gargoyles, chimeras and sculptures by scaling the building.</p>

<p>No further damage to the cathedral walls</p>
<p>To avoid having to drill holes in the medieval walls of the building, granite footings and brick piles were installed so that parts of the cathedral could be restored.</p>
<p>Chief architect Philippe Villeneuve has stressed that the building&rsquo;s eighth-century walls - which have survived many renovations and modifications over the years - should not suffer any damage during the project.</p>
<p>The robots have helped technicians clean the rubble inside Notre-Dame due to the risk of further collapse.</p>
<p>All the remaining debris - mainly wood, metal, stone and gravel - was carefully checked and marked by experts before it was removed from site, Durand explained</p>
<p>The analysis of the debris is twofold: to help understand what started the fire - believed to be a faulty electrical circuit - and to understand how the cathedral was built eight centuries ago.</p>

<p>The biggest challenge to come</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the biggest challenges so far is to resolve the problem of the scaffolding that had been installed to restore the building&rsquo;s spire, and was damaged during the blaze,&rdquo; Durand said.</p>
<p>So far, teams have managed to reinforce the scaffolding, a necessary step in the process of dismantling it.</p>
<p>In the next few months, when work will resume, the scaffolding will be cut, tube by tube, and lowered to the ground.</p>

<p>The riggers will then collect the tubes - 250,000 of them - while being suspended from large beams.</p>
<p>In parallel to the scaffolding removal, other teams will work at night to remove the debris from the top of the cathedrals vaulted ceiling. This includes charred remains of the wooden frame and lead from the roof which melted during the fire.</p>

<p>All the remaining stone vaults will have to be reinforced, because 15% of them collapsed when the spire fell. An investigation has been carried out by the chief architect with the help of specialists to identify parts of the vaults which need to be consolidated from above. When this work is complete workers will be able to safely go into the building to start the restoration on the internal stonework.</p>

<p>Scientists looking for clues</p>
<p>All of the remains removed from the top of the cathedral&rsquo;s vaulted ceiling as well as others from different parts of the building are sorted in the large tents at the foot of Notre-Dame.</p>
<p>“The Laboratory of Historical Monuments specialists are present to identify, analyse and catalogue all of the items so that they can be put back in the correct location,&rdquo; Durand explained.</p>
<p>The fire in April 2019 released hundreds of tons of lead into the air, contaminating the site and surrounding area.</p>
<p>As a result, the work of many specialists on site had to be occasionally postponed due to the concerns about lead concentration, and measures have been taken to protect everyone on the construction site, including special masks and suits and onsite showers.</p>

<p>Tests will be carried out to define the best plan to clean and restore as much as possible in the interior of Notre-Dame, much of it in laboratories outside the cathedral.</p>

<p>Reopening postponed?</p>
<p>Soon after the fire, a public body was created by French president Emmanuel Macron and headed by retired military general Jean-Louis Georgelin, appointed to oversee the restoration project.</p>
<p>Georgelin said the plan was to open the cathedral on the 15 April, 2024, with a service, but the five year time-frame for restoration seems ambitious to some experts.</p>
<p>Considering the coronavirus outbreak, meeting that deadline may turn into a battle against time.

<p><img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/images/2020/4/11/image-20200411104226783.jpg" alt="img">
A Good Friday service has been held in Paris&rsquo;s Notre Dame Cathedral, nearly a year after it was devastated by a fire.</p>
<p>With the French capital under lockdown, only a handful of people took part in the ceremony, wearing hard hats and protective clothing because rebuilding on the cathedral is not yet complete and the interior is not entirely safe.</p>
<p>Al Jazeera&rsquo;s Natacha Butler reports from Angouleme, France.

<h3 id="lone-bell-chime-marks-notre-dame-fire-anniversary">Lone bell chime marks Notre-Dame fire anniversary</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/04/14/2020_04_14_92676_1586838022._large.jpg" alt="img">
A lone bell rang out from what remains of the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris on Wednesday, in the sole commemoration to mark a year since a massive blaze nearly destroyed one of the world&rsquo;s most revered monuments.</p>
<p>Reconstruction of the mediaeval cathedral has been halted, with France under lockdown over the deadly coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>The bell dubbed &ldquo;Emmanuel&rdquo; in the cathedral&rsquo;s south tower rang out at 8:00 pm, the hour French people have become accustomed to gather at their windows and on balconies to applaud health workers on the frontlines of the battle against the virus that has killed over 17,000 people in France.</p>
<p>President Emmanuel Macron vowed Wednesday to do everything possible to ensure the 13th-century masterpiece is restored to its former glory within five years &ndash; a timeframe already judged optimistic by many, and now further imperiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will reconstruct the Notre-Dame in five years, I promised. We will do everything to meet this deadline. Yes, construction is at a halt for the moment due to the health crisis, but it will resume as soon as possible,&rdquo; he said in a video message.</p>
<p>The ferocious blaze, watched in horror by millions of television viewers worldwide, has not been forgotten even if &ldquo;our days, our thoughts, our lives are usurped&rdquo; by the coronavirus outbreak, Macron said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the restoration of Notre-Dame is important to us all, it is clearly also because it is a symbol of the resilience of our people, of their ability to overcome trials, and to recover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toxic lead, mangled scaffolding</p>
<p>The 13-tonne bell is the cathedral&rsquo;s oldest, installed in 1686 at the behest of King Louis XIV, according to the Notre-Dame website.</p>
<p>Its chime has punctuated most major events in France since then, and in a solemn gesture was the only commemoration scheduled for Wednesday.</p>
<p>Firefighters battled through the night on April 15, 2019 to save the cathedral from the blaze which ravaged its roof and dramatically toppled the steeple.</p>
<p>Macron had promised a herculean effort to have the UNESCO heritage site restored in time for the Paris Olympics of 2024.</p>
<p>But even before the coronavirus pandemic struck, work had been delayed by decontamination efforts. More than 300 tons of lead from the roof melted in the blaze, covering the site in toxic particles.</p>
<p>The fragile structure remains at risk, and massive wooden beams are propping up the arches and gables.</p>
<p>Workers have not even removed the tangled web of metal scaffolding that fused together in the inferno, which had erupted during renovation work on the roof.</p>
<p>This needs to happen before they can install a more durable temporary roof to protect the church&rsquo;s priceless artworks from rain.</p>
<p>Prosecutors suspect faulty electrical wiring or a poorly extinguished cigarette caused the blaze.</p>
<p>Glass spire?</p>
<p>Officials still have to decide a crucial question: Rebuild the cathedral exactly as it was, using traditional techniques and materials, or incorporate a modern touch?</p>
<p>Macron has said he is in favor of a &ldquo;contemporary&rdquo; touch for the spire.</p>
<p>But the project&rsquo;s chief architect Philippe Villeneuve has refused to countenance any glass spire, rooftop garden or other modernistic proposals and opinion polls suggest most French people agree with him.</p>
<p>More than 900 million euros (nearly $1 billion) have been given or pledged by some 340,000 companies and individuals worldwide to restore the cathedral.
