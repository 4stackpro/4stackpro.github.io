WrestleMania 36 tried a new format for viewers this year, but people still tuned in to watch The Undertaker take on AJ Styles in a Boneyard match on April 4.</p>
<p>As one of the night’s most anticipated face-offs, it didn’t disappoint, and fans were enthralled to see the legendary Deadman toss Styles off a metal farmhouse roof, bury him, and roll out with flames in the backdrop.</p>
<p>That’s the undying, supernatural magic of The Undertaker. But who is the man behind the mythical WWE figure? Mark William Calaway took on the persona decades ago. Here’s a look at his background and net worth.</p>

<p>Before he was The Undertaker, Mark Calaway played basketball</p>
<p>That’s not so farfetched, is it? At 6’9”, Calaway played the sport in his native Texas as a high school student and in college. He attended Angelina College on a basketball scholarship before transferring to Texas Wesleyan University.</p>
<p>His talents on the court caught the attention of scouts and Calaway was offered the opportunity to play professionally in Europe, but he turned it down and chose to drop out of school his junior year. He decided to pursue wrestling instead, and enrolled in wrestling school, per The Bleacher Report.</p>
<p>How Calaway became The Undertaker</p>
<p>Calaway wrestled under a few different monikers before settling on The Undertaker and turning into one of wrestling’s biggest stars. Early in his career, he was Master of Pain, Mean Mark Callous, and Punisher.</p>
<p>He started wrestling in the late ‘80s, working with WCW and as part of a duo, but by 1990, he signed on with Vince McMahon and the then-WWF.</p>
<p>That’s when Calaway transitioned into The Undertaker, the brooding agent of death and deliverer of tombstone piledrivers that fans have come to know and love.</p>
<p>In an interview with Steve Austin, he said at the time, he didn’t know what The Undertaker was, but McMahon gave him the character and created the gimmick.</p>
<p>Calaway shared there was a part of him that liked dark stuff, so he figured out how to put it all together. He’s built a lasting legacy in wrestling that’s endured for more than 30 years – false retirements included. In 2020, The Undertaker is still a draw for WWE.</p>
<p>The Undertaker does real estate too</p>
<p>It’s never a bad thing to have your eggs in more than one basket, and Calaway dabbles in commercial real estate on the side. He partnered up with friend Scott Everhart to form Calahart Crossroads, an LLC with property in Colorado.</p>
<p>In 2006, the pair constructed the Calahart Building in Loveland and rent/sell retail space there and around the area.</p>
<p>Calaway accumulated wealth through wrestling, supports charities</p>
<p>He’s a family man, a philanthropist, and wrestling superstar, but The Undertaker is game to give back.</p>
<p>While married to Sarah Calaway, he and his former wife started the Zeus Compton Calaway Save the Animals Fund, which helped provide treatments to animals through Texas A&amp;M University’s veterinary program. It was named after their dog, Zeus.</p>
<p>He’s now married to retired wrestler Michelle McCool, and they often pair up to participate in fundraising efforts for groups such as America’s Mighty Warriors and SPUR Compassion.</p>
<p>Per Sportskeeda, The Undertaker makes an annual salary of $2.5 million with the WWE, and also takes a cut of PPV earnings.</p>
<p>In addition to wrestling and real estate, Calaway earns money through speaking engagements and endorsements. According to Celebrity Net Worth, The Undertaker’s estimated net worth is $17 million.

THE UNDERTAKER sent AJ Styles straight to hell as he claimed a crazy WrestleMania victory in what could be his final ever match at the Showcase of the Immortals.</p>
<p>But it was unlike anything the WWE Universe had ever seen before as the Dead Man prevailed in scenes that would be more akin to a horror movie.</p>

<p>The main event of Mania night one took us to the BoneYard and began in a cemetery with no announcers to call the action.</p>
<p>Undertaker’s music hit and a hearse rolled through the gates as two hooded figures pulled out a coffin from the back - and out pops Styles.</p>
<p>All of a sudden the roar of a motorbike was heard in the distance, and as it continued to grow louder, the American Badass was soon on the scene.</p>
<p>The trash-talking began as the brawl got underway - complete with an eerie soundtrack playing in the background.</p>
<p>Taker pummelled AJ on top of the hearse but he was soon bleeding as the veteran sent his fist through the window after missing the Phenomenal One.</p>
<p>Undeterred, Taker, 55, threw his foe into an already dug grave, but as he went to grab a shovel, AJ’s OC colleagues Anderson and Gallows showed up to rescue him.</p>
<p>The lights in a shed behind them soon lit up as a crew of hooded figures circled the Phenom, but the outnumbered icon replied with “If we’re gonna do this, let’s do this” before battering his way through them all.</p>
<p>Taker then attacked Anderson and Gallows, but as he grabbed a shovel for a weapon, Styles smashed him in the back and sent him through a wooden structure to leave the Dead Man gasping for breath.</p>
<p>The taunts then began, but Undertaker returned it with a one-finger salute, earning a shot with the spade in the back of the head as he fell into the grave.</p>

<p>5 Taker set fire to a tin shed roof before hitting AJ with a tombstone then chokeslamming him off it</p>
<p>Styles mounted a digger to bury the Dead Man, but before he could embark on that task, a light came up behind him as Taker appeared and began a fresh assault.</p>
<p>AJ tried to scramble to safety by climbing up onto a roof as Taker followed with choral music in the background, punching all three OC members and delivering tombstones to Gallows and Anderson.</p>
<p>Then AJ was sent crashing back down to earth with a bang as Undertaker chokeslammed off the roof.</p>
<p>Taker then began explaining to Styles why this was happening as AJ attempted to apologise - but the American Badass was having none of it as he kicked his foe into the hole.</p>
<p>The Phenom then climbed into the digger and poured dirt all over Styles to win the match, picking up his bandana and mounting his motorbike as the sound of Metallica filled viewers&rsquo; ears as he drove off.</p>

<h3 id="wwe-wrestlemania-36-undertaker-title-change-becky-lynch-highlight-day-1">WWE WrestleMania 36: Undertaker, title change, Becky Lynch highlight Day 1</h3>
<p><img src="https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/wm36_hm_27789.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="img">
Now that was badass.</p>
<p>The Undertaker – using a twist on his American Badass persona – put on a horror-movie-meets-old-western boneyard match with AJ Styles that was the highlight of a supremely entertaining Day 1 of WrestleMania 36 on Saturday night. The Undertaker showed up to a graveyard in a top and pants reminiscent of his traditional character, but wore a bandana and rode in on a motorcycle to “Now That We’re Dead” by Metallica after Styles showed up in a hearse.</p>
<p>What followed was unlike anything we’ve seen in WWE, which rose to the creative occasion for most of the night after conducting WrestleMania without fans because of the coronavirus pandemic. There was blood, fire, druids brought in by Karl Anderson and Luke Gallows, the Undertaker teleporting out of a grave to behind Styles in a flash of light and ultimately The Phenomenal One being buried alive.</p>
<p>The cinematic quality of it made it feel special and created tension. The Undertaker came across the best he has in a long time. He was the John Wayne gunslinger, down to his last breath, rallying to defeat the story’s villain – choke-slamming Styles off the top of a barn. The Undertaker then brought the story full circle by telling Styles – who was at his obnoxious best – “What’s my wife’s name? You remember it now?”</p>
<p>We won’t forget this match, which will go in The Undertaker’s canon of memorable ones, and it will be remembered as the day the character officially moved into the industry’s reality era. Hopefully this isn’t the last time we see Styles-Undertaker.</p>
<p>The Undertaker is still the man and so is Becky Lynch. Could the return of the “Baddest Women on The Planet” be far behind?</p>
<p>Lynch retained her Raw women’s championship – which she won from Ronda Rousey at WrestleMania 35. She countered Shayna Baszler’s Kirifuda Clutch submission finisher into a pin, allowing her to escape with a win at WWE’s Performance Center. Given the monster-like build Baszler got coming into this match, the logical explanation for Lynch keeping the belt is Rousey could be ready to return to try to reclaim her championship. The Man has pretty much beaten everyone else in the division, but still hasn’t faced the former UFC women’s bantamweight champion in a singles match.</p>
<p>The contest itself was the flat-out physical fight we all hoped for. The two opened with a flurry of blows, went counter for counter for a while and then started targeting body parts. It was one of Baszler’s better showings as Lynch sold well for her and the two had plenty of chemistry.</p>
<p>Baszler certainly didn’t look weak in defeat, but the loss does hurt any mystique WWE built up around her – somewhat wasting four months of building her. NXT already has a ladder match set up to determine a No. 1 contender for its women’s title. Baszler likely will force her way into the title picture if she stays with the black-and-gold brand, but her future is unclear for now.</p>
<p>WrestleMania 36 did include a huge title change as last-minute sub Braun Strowman kicked out of four spears, avoided a Jackhammer and delivered three power slams before pinning Goldberg in 2:12 to win his first Universal championship. Though Strowman becoming a world champion is long overdue, this is a weird way to have it happen. He took the place of Roman Reigns – who pulled out of WrestleMania because of coronavirus health concerns – and now he’s champion.</p>
<p>Strowman winning is certainly not far-fetched given his “Monster Among Men” moniker, but quick matches like this – the only thing the 53-year-old Goldberg can have – just makes the decision to have him beat “The Fiend” Bray Wyatt for the Universal title at Super ShowDown seem that much more wrong. Reigns and Strowman, who have had a good match with before, seem to be on a collision course.</p>
<p>Unlike the Universal title match, the tag team – er, triple-threat singles – ladder match was a show stealer and had one of WWE’s most unique and fitting finishes in a long time. The Miz had reportedly showed up to one of the tapings not feeling well, so this match became John Morrison vs. Jimmy Uso vs. Kofi Kingston representing their tag teams. They made good use of their athleticism and creativity.</p>
<p>It ended with all three of them pulling down the hanger with the SmackDown tag team championship belts, but Morrison – who looked great in his first WrestleMania since 2011 – ultimately fell onto a horizontal ladder with the straps themselves for the win. The finish allows Morrison and Miz to retain and gives the New Day and The Usos a legitimate reason for a rematch when all six participants can partake. Really well done.</p>
<p>Seth Rollins was going to let Owens get his WrestleMania “win” after he was disqualified for using the ring bell. Owens wasn’t having it, asking Rollins to make it a no-disqualification match, and he eventually got his WrestleMania moment. He delivered a diving elbow to Rollins on the announce table from the top of the WrestleMania sign behind the barricade. It was the “Oh my God” moment of the night. The Stunner finished it off.</p>
<p>One title that didn’t change hands was the Intercontinental championship. Sami Zayn – with help from Shinsuke Nakamura and Cesaro – escaped with the belt. Bryan toyed with Zayn for most of the match, admonishing him for calling Drew Gulak “a joke.”</p>
<p>The major theme coming in was Bryan having holes in his game, and his cockiness and loyalty got the best him in a match that was more about good story than great wrestling. Good for Zayn that his title reign was not ended before it even started. Him gloating about this only will add to the heat he already has.</p>
<p>We are sure to hear a lot of Zayn in the future, but we got very little of host Rob Gronkowski, who did the open and then a segment that could carry over into Day 2. The former New England Patriots tight end nearly won the 24/7 championship, but was pulled off by friend Mojo Rawley, who scored the pin. There is a good chance Gronk puts gold around his waist on Sunday.</p>
<p>Other Matches</p>
<p>Cesaro over Drew Gulak (Kickoff show)</p>
<p>Cesaro won the short match with an airplane spin, barely using his injured right arm. Building up Gulak should have been more important than trying to build doubt about Bryan’s fortunes later in the night. Wish these two got more time.</p>
<p>Elias over King Corbin</p>
<p>At least WWE has Corbin losing matches now. This one started well with Elias returning the favor by injuring Corbin’s shoulder, but kind of plodded along after. Ultimately, The King got distracted complaining about a near fall and was rolled up by Elias for the win.</p>
<p>Nikki Cross and Alexa Bliss over Asuka and Kairi Sane to win the women’s tag team championship.</p>
<p>Bliss and Cross’ chemistry outside the ring translated into it in a hard-hitting, fluid and energy-filled match to open Day 1. Sane and Asuka threw everything they had at their opponents and both teams were vocal to make up for the lack of fans. It feels like the Kabuki Warriors’ reign fell flat after their feud with Lynch and Charlotte Flair. The division, what little there is of it, is in good hands in Cross and Bliss.</p>
<p>Biggest Winner: Braun Strowman</p>
<p>Biggest Loser: Kabuki Warriors</p>
<p>Best Match: The Undertaker vs. AJ Styles (Boneyard match)</p>
<p>Predictions: 6-3</p>
