BLUE skies and warm sunshine have eased the sting of self-isolation for many - but from today, the mercury is set to drop, forecasters say.</p>
<p>While the nation got used to life in lockdown, the country enjoyed beaming sunshine and warm temperatures.</p>
<p>2 The weather will drop as low as -2c in some areas on Wednesday</p>
<p>2 There was beautiful sunshine towards the end of March - but we&rsquo;re not likely to see it again for a little while Credit: PA:Press Association</p>
<p>Last Wednesday, temperatures hit 19.4C in north Wales - around 8C above average for this time of year.</p>
<p>But the sunny spell was chased away by cold winds over the weekend - and the first few days of April are likely to feel significantly colder.</p>
<p>It will be a few degrees cooler than normal as we head into a month known for its showers and sunshine.</p>
<p>SNOW COULD FALL</p>
<p>Met Office meteorologist Luke Miall said last night: &ldquo;We will see spells of sunshine, cloudier skies at times and a few showers may affect eastern England, eastern Scotland and maybe northern Scotland as well, but the vast majority will be dry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tomorrow, April 1, temperatures will hit a maximum of 12C.</p>
<p>From Thursday, windier weather is expected across northern England and Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;ll be heavy showers in Scotland and even some snow on higher ground.</p>
<p>LAST WEEK WAS A RECORD-BREAKER</p>
<p>Mr Miall said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a chilly feel most of the week, really.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No uncommon temperatures but definitely feeling cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll mainly be feeling cold because of how warm it was last week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Towards the end of the week, temperatures will peak at 10C in the south and 6C to 8C in the north.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s around 2C cooler than normal, he said.</p>
<p>The coolest temperatures of around -2C will be reached tonight and tomorrow night, forecasters say.</p>
<p>The bright calm weather seen last week was due to a patch of record-breaking high pressure across the UK.</p>
<p>Mr Miall said: &ldquo;It gave us plenty of clear blue skies, lots of sunshine and fine weather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The winds were coming around from the east and the south-east, which is a warmer direction than this week, where they are coming down from the north.&rdquo;</p>
