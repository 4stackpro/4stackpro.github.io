News Ban alcohol? Cool, SA’s already searching for homemade booze recipes</p>
<p>Alcohol has been a topic of much discussion in the past month, especially because of the prohibition that was put in place by the government to ban the sale of alcohol for the lockdown period.</p>
<p>Google’s search data reflect these unprecedented moments, capturing high volumes of search data with the word “alcohol” in them, with many people looking up ways to make homemade alcohol.</p>
<p>“Searches on Google SA for ‘alcohol ban South Africa’ spiked 500% in the past week,” the search engine giant said on Wednesday, adding that “how to get alcohol” and “homemade alcohol” were also very popular among South Africans.</p>
<p>The provinces that showed the highest levels of interest in “homemade alcohol” were Free State, North West, Mpumalanga and Limpopo. However, it was noted that Northern Cape showed “very low levels of search interest” for any of the alcohol-related terms.</p>
<p>On March 15, President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed the nation and declared a national state of disaster because of the Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>READ: Cele to citizens: &lsquo;Your behaviour will determine whether lockdown is extended&rsquo;</p>
<p>On that day, the term “homemade alcohol” already started to climb up the search rankings. By the next day it was easily one of the most-searched terms relative to other search terms on the day.</p>
<p>Ramaphosa, at the time, had not made mention of alcohol but South Africans clearly pre-empted the prohibition.</p>
<p>On March 18, Ramaphosa advised the nation to reduce its alcohol consumption and said that announcements regarding “taverns, nightclubs and all that” would be made shortly. This sparked another spike in alcohol-related searches, this time for “alcohol ban South Africa” and the more pressing issue of “how to get alcohol”.</p>
<p>Since then those terms have been dominant on Google’s search engine.</p>
<p>After City Press published Police Minister Bheki Cele’s comments that he wished the alcohol ban could last even after lockdown, South Africans again let their fingers do the talking by searching for ways to make homemade alcohol.</p>
<p>Some other related terms that resulted in a rise in search usage included: Homemade beer recipes South Africa; can homemade pineapple beer make you drink; homemade gin; homemade alcoholic pineapple beer; and how to make alcohol at home fast.</p>

<h3 id="sa-crime-rate-drops-minister-says-thanks-to-virus-lockdown-booze-ban--nehanda-radio">SA crime rate drops, minister says thanks to virus lockdown booze ban – Nehanda Radio</h3>

SA crime rate drops, minister says thanks to virus lockdown booze ban</p>
<p>South African Police Minister Bheki Cele sports a dark hat and pinstriped suit, a style that escapes no one in its echo of Eliot Ness, the famed enforcer of Prohibition in 1920s America.</p>
<p>The media-savvy police boss has been boasting of a dramatic fall in crime since South Africa imposed a 21-day coronavirus lockdown, along with a ban on the sale of booze.</p>
<p>In the first nine days of nationwide confinement, the tally of murders plummeted to 94 from 326 over the same period last year.</p>
<p>Reported rape cases fell to 101 from 699, while cases of grievous bodily harm declined eight-fold to 456 from 2,673.</p>
<p>Cele made no secret of his conclusion for the big fall: enforced sobriety.</p>
<p>“We attribute this to the non-availability of alcohol,” he declared last weekend.</p>
<p>– Short-term benefit? –</p>
<p>The pandemic appears indeed to have provided a respite for a country with one of the highest crime rates in the world.</p>
<p>Rival gang members in Cape Town’s notorious Cape Flats have even temporarily halted their turf wars to deliver food supplies to struggling households during the lockdown.</p>
<p>But experts sound a word of caution: the dip, they say, is unlikely to last and alcohol is a complex factor in the equation.</p>
<p>A research consultant at the Pretoria-based Institute of Security Studies, Johan Burger, said more visible policing and fewer people on the streets have inevitably led to a reduction of some crimes, especially in public spaces.</p>
<p>But those with access to alcohol and living in small cramped homes typical of South Africa could find themselves in a dangerous cocktail that could almost guarantee confrontation, Burger said.</p>
<p>Conversely, those who suddenly cannot get alcohol experience frustration — “and we know frustration is the phase before aggressive behaviour,” Burger said.</p>
<p>Shaun Shelly, founder of an awareness programme called SA Drug Policy Week, said the alcohol ban was “purely a moral position” and there was insufficient evidence to prove it had the dampening effects on crime as claimed by Cele.</p>
<p>A sudden cut in supply of alcohol causes physical and mental problems, the South African National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence warns.</p>
<p>– Alcohol consumption –</p>
<p>Wine, beer and homemade alcohol made from maize, also called corn, are readily knocked back in South Africa.</p>
<p>The country ranks 30th in the world in terms of per capita alcohol consumption, according to 2010 figures by the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
<p>But Cele has made no secret of his dream of a South Africa where booze is banned permanently.</p>
<p>“My first prize would be that we shut down alcohol,” he said provocatively.</p>
<p>“I wish (the) alcohol ban could be extended beyond lockdown.”</p>
<p>For good measure, he has added tobacco to his blacklisted lockdown commodities, saying they are non-essential and dangerous for health.</p>
<p>His zeal has unsurprisingly caused him to come under fire.</p>
<p>Andrew Whitfield, the shadow police minister for South Africa’s main opposition Democratic Alliance party, lashed Cele for his visionary talk.</p>
<p>“I think the minister is overreaching and that the power has gone to (his) head,” he said, warning against a drift towards an “authoritarian regime”.</p>
<p>– ‘We get bored’ –</p>
<p>The response to Cele on social media has been caustic.</p>
<p>“Bheki Cele should go 21 days without a hat. Then he can lecture us about going 21 days without smoking,” tweeted Roman Cabanac.</p>
<p>Some ironically pointed out that if Cele styled himself on the “incorruptible” Eliot Ness, he himself was fired from his post as police chief in 2012 on suspicion of graft.</p>
<p>The behaviour of a 31-year-old resident of Soweto, on the outskirts of Johannesburg, showed the contorted response of many South Africans to a boozeless lockdown.</p>
<p>“Yes, Cele is right — crime has reduced in the neighbourhood,” he told AFP… shortly after meeting with an illegal trader to score a black market 12-pack of beer.</p>
<p>The father of one, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he felt justified in breaking the rules.</p>
<p>“We get bored, you can’t wake up and not do anything every day.” AFP

<h3 id="do-homemade-face-mask-protect-you-from-the-virus">Do homemade face mask protect you from the virus?</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.graytvinc.com/images/sewing+a+mask.JPG" alt="img">
You&rsquo;re not alone if you&rsquo;ve crafted a homemade mask to go to the store, work, or gas station these days. While you might not feel like your homemade mask does much good, experts in Missouri said they&rsquo;re better than nothing.</p>
<p>The actual infectious COVID-19 particle is smaller than anything you can visibly see with your eyes—the infectious particle measures in nanometers, which is one-billionth of a meter. Ozarks Technical Community College, Bio Clinical Science Instructor, Dick Wells said, while that is extremely small, any mask even a makeshift one would act as a protective barrier.</p>
<p>Although they aren&rsquo;t perfect, cloth masks and alternatives can help cut down on some larger infectious respiratory droplets from a sneeze or cough. However, cloth masks can potentially allow more through than those valuable N95 masks due to the holes in the fabric, despite that wells stressed that the masks are still beneficial.</p>
<p>Wells explained that masks limit how much of the virus reaches your lungs. That cuts down on the odds of getting sick. He said anything that you can do to keep the infectious dose away is critical.</p>
<p>While a homemade mask will work as a barrier, Wells assured that you shouldn&rsquo;t worry about finding a 100-percent particle proof mask. He said masks have to allow somethings through, or else we couldn&rsquo;t breathe while wearing them.</p>
<p>The best fabrics for a homemade mask is 100% cotton or pillowcase. You can also create a face mask using bandannas, dish towels, or other home fabrics as opposed to polyester.</p>
<p>Wells said washing your hands is just as essential to help and reduce the spread of the coronavirus. If you&rsquo;re unable to wash your hands, he noted that hand sanitizer would help. The alcohol content and affects infectious COVID-19 particles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The virus takes and steals the host membrane which is made of phospholipids and protein, and the alcohol can break that down and destroy the virus,&rdquo; explained Wells.</p>
<p>While a homemade mask will work, Wells assured that you don&rsquo;t worry about finding a 100% particle-proof mask. He said masks have to allow somethings through, or else we couldn&rsquo;t breathe while wearing them.</p>
