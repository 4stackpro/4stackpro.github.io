Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:</p>
<p>UK prime minister in intensive care</p>
<p>Boris Johnson was moved to an intensive care unit after his condition worsened, Downing Street confirmed. A spokeswoman said the move was a precaution in case the prime minister needs ventilation.</p>
<p>Johnson was admitted to hospital on Sunday, with officials saying the symptoms of coronavirus from which he has been suffering were persisting.</p>
<p>Known global cases pass 1.3 million</p>
<p>According to Johns Hopkins University, 1,337,749 people around the world are known to have been infected, while at least 73,917 have died. The scale of the outbreak is likely to be greater as some countries are suspected of underreporting their figures. The researchers say 275,883 people have recovered.</p>
<p>UK foreign secretary to stand in for PM</p>
<p>Dominic Raab will deputise for Johnson while the latter is in hospital. In a televised interview, the foreign secretary said the UK government’s coronavirus fight would continue and ministers would focus on implementing the prime minister’s plan.</p>
<p>World leaders wish Johnson well</p>
<p>The French president Emmanuel Macron said he hoped the UK prime minister made a speedy recovery, while the US president Donald Trump said he was praying for Johnson. Canada’s prime minister Justin Trudeau and the Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar were among those to send their best wishes.</p>
<p>Westminster unites behind prime minister</p>
<p>Prominent figures from across the UK’s political landscape offered their support to Johnson as his condition deteriorated.</p>
<p>French death toll increases by 10%</p>
<p>The death toll in French hospitals increased by 10% in a day to a cumulative total of 6,494, the country’s health minister Olivier Véran said. He added that, including partial data about the number of people who have died in nursing homes, the total death toll from the disease rose to 8,911 from 8,078 on Sunday, also a rise of 10%.</p>
<p>US death toll nears 9,000</p>
<p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said 8,910 people had died as a result of the pandemic and the country had 330,891 reported cases.</p>
<p>Denmark prepares to relax lockdown measures</p>
<p>The country will reopen daycare centres and schools for children in first to fifth grade starting 15 April, if the numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths remain stable, its prime minister said.</p>
<p>Other restrictions will remain in place until at least 10 May and the ban on big gatherings will stay until August.</p>
<p>Italy’s death toll accelerates again</p>
<p>The country had recorded the fewest deaths in any day for two weeks but Monday’s figures showed the numbers accelerating again, with a further 636 new deaths; 111 more than the number registered on Sunday. That brought the toll in Italy to 16,523.</p>
<p>The number of current new infections increased by 1,941 – a rise of 2% since Sunday and the lowest day-to-day rise registered since 30 March.</p>
<p>Hopes rise in Greece</p>
<p>The latest figures released by health authorities in Greece offered a glimmer of hope. The prominent infectious diseases expert, Sotirios Tsiodras, said data suggested the country was “flattening the curve”.

<h3 id="lockdown-has-cut-britains-vibrations-seismologists-find">Lockdown has cut Britain&rsquo;s vibrations, seismologists find</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e47797f82894655bab31ee9c742d5a9b0b8e3d70/0_2252_6500_3900/master/6500..jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=040a20ef43de501ca1e05e1dd938274b" alt="img">
There’s a kind of hush all over the world as the reduction in human activity stops the Earth buzzing so much</p>
<p>The dramatic quietening of towns and cities in lockdown Britain has changed the way the Earth moves beneath our feet, scientists say.</p>
<p>Seismologists at the British Geological Survey have found that their sensors are twitching less now that human activity has been curtailed, leading to a drop in the anthropogenic din that vibrates through the planet.</p>
<p>The fall in the human hum that rings around the world means that, in theory at least, the scientists should be able to detect smaller earthquakes in the UK, and more distant tremors in Europe and in countries further afield than their equipment usually allows.</p>

<p>“Seismometers measure ground vibrations and the vibrations we want to record are from earthquakes. But because they are so sensitive they pick up other sources too, including human activity, so road traffic, people walking past and nearby factories,” said Brian Baptie, a seismologist at BGS in Edinburgh. “All these things generate vibrations and those propagate through the Earth.”</p>
<p>Human-induced vibrations, known in the trade as “cultural noise”, spread through the planet differently to tremors from earthquakes and tend to die away a few miles from their origins. But seismometers placed near urban centres still pick up plenty of noise that makes it harder for scientists to analyse the more valuable seismic data.</p>
<p>The UK’s network of sensitive instruments picked up markedly fewer vibrations last week as the coronavirus lockdown took hold, the researchers found. “We had a look at the data from some of our seismic stations around the UK and we do see an effect,” said Baptie. At some sensors, cultural noise is running at five decibels lower than normal, about a quarter down on usual readings. Similar falls have been spotted by Belgian seismologists based in Brussels.</p>

<p>The BGS operates a national network of about 80 seismometers from Shetland to Jersey that provide a constant ear to the ground. The data are pored over by BGS scientists and fed into a global network that is used to monitor earthquakes anywhere on the planet. In contrast to low-frequency tremors, cultural noise vibrations are high-frequency waves, around one to 100Hz, that tend to travel through the surface layers of the Earth.</p>
<p>“In theory, this reduction in noise means we should be able to detect more earthquakes in the UK, in Europe and all around the world,” said Baptie. If so, it would shed light on the frequency of different magnitude earthquakes and, in the case of more distant tremors, how the seismic waves are affected by the Earth’s structure and the characteristics of the shifting faults that unleash them.</p>
<p>Researchers at the BGS now hope to check all their seismometers for the fall in human noise with the aim of producing a map that will reveal which areas of Britain have seen the most stark declines in the human hum. The hunt for smaller earthquakes may take longer than the lockdown holds, however. “We aren’t in a particularly active region,” said Baptie. “So we may not get anything in the short term.”

<h3 id="the-strange-lead-up-to-boris-johnsons-admission-to-hospital">The strange lead-up to Boris Johnson&rsquo;s admission to hospital</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0ff72c5cff2f7e689dda488b658bcff97a28ec4/0_357_5349_3209/master/5349..jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=8f301b1944154642233bee8183143b66" alt="img">
The first indication that Boris Johnson was sicker with coronavirus than either he or his aides were letting on came on Thursday morning. The suggestion made by a source was specific: a bed was being prepared at St Thomas’ hospital for the prime minister, whose condition had worsened during his seven-day period of isolation in Downing Street.</p>
<p>It did not take long for rumours to spread. A Conservative backbencher had heard a similar story, this time suggesting Johnson may have even already been admitted to the hospital across the Thames from Westminster, and passed the tip to the Guardian at about the same time. Together it was more than enough to prompt an urgent inquiry to No 10.</p>
<p>In reply, Johnson’s aides were emphatic. His condition had not deteriorated, he still had only “mild symptoms”, he hoped to be at work from Friday when his coronavirus isolation period was up - and he had not been admitted to St Thomas’ hospital for treatment. When on Monday evening it emerged that contrary to reassurances about him getting on with his red box, he was being admitted to intensive care, the denials were coming under increasing scrutiny.</p>
<p>Johnson, 55, had spent the week since testing positive for coronavirus holed up in the flat above No 11 Downing Street, while his pregnant fiancee Carrie Symonds - who has herself been unwell - was becoming increasingly concerned about his health.</p>
<p>The prime minister hoped to keep his period of isolation to a minimum, trying to govern the country via video conference calls and email, all the while still coughing and with his overall condition failing to improve.</p>
<p>Play Video 1:48 Boris Johnson says he still has &lsquo;minor symptoms&rsquo; of the coronavirus – video</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the mood in Downing Street was darkening during a difficult week in which it was becoming clear that the government was struggling to hit a target of 10,000 coronavirus tests a day, even prompting the unwell prime minister on Wednesday to promise that he would take personal charge of the issue.</p>
<p>Key advisers such as Dominic Cummings, his chief aide, were not at No 10 because they too were ill and isolating, while criticism was being levelled at the health secretary, Matt Hancock, himself only back at work on Thursday after developing symptoms.</p>
<p>“Other ministers feel he’s been getting the government in trouble by over-promising on testing, and not interrogating his civil servants enough,” according to one well-connected Tory aide, who is close to key figures at No 10.</p>
<p>There was also criticism of the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, the leading figure in Downing Street in Johnson’s and Cummings’s absence. “Sedwill seems to be amassing power, even though you have to be questioning how effective the civil service has been in tackling coronavirus so far. And all the while, was he looking out properly for the prime minister?” the aide added, although it is hard to know if even the country’s most senior official could have persuaded Johnson to recuperate earlier.</p>
<p>On Thursday lunchtime, having denied the first round of rumours about St Thomas’, Downing Street floated the idea that Johnson might not be back at work on Friday as planned if his temperature remained high.</p>
<p>A cough was not mentioned, but his official spokesman told a daily briefing with journalists that he would only go back to work the next day if his temperature came down.</p>
<p>That evening at 8pm, despite his isolation, the prime minister appeared at the door of No 10 to applaud the work of NHS workers. Despite the appearance, the health rumours did not go away: St Thomas’ was on standby because Johnson’s condition had worsened, the first source insisted - only for Downing Street, when pressed, to deny that he was about to be admitted that night.</p>
<p>On Friday lunchtime, the situation began to unravel. An unkempt, gravelly-voiced and clearly unwell Johnson released a video in which he said, somewhat implausibly, “I’m feeling better,” before conceding he could not fully return to work. “Alas, I still have one of the symptoms, a minor symptom, I still have a temperature,” he insisted.</p>
<p>On Saturday he spoke to newly elected Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to invite him “to a briefing next week” on the crisis, but on Sunday his health apparently took a turn. At about 7.30pm that evening, Johnson was rushed by car to the hospital.</p>
<p>About 90 minutes later, Downing Street went public, saying Johnson had been “admitted to hospital for tests” on the advice of his doctor and, in a change of language, acknowledged the prime minister was suffering from “persistent” rather than mild symptoms.</p>
<p>Shortly before 8.30pm on Monday, further news came: the prime minister had been admitted to intensive care at St Thomas’ 90 minutes earlier.</p>
<p>Several sources say Johnson has required oxygen to help with his breathing following his admission to hospital - an assertion that was not denied by Downing Street - although his official spokesman said that Russian reports that he was on a ventilator were “disinformation”. Those who know Symonds, 32, say she is worried: “She’s ringing up friends, telling them how anxious she is.”</p>
<p>At the daily press briefing on Monday evening, nearly 24 hours after Johnson’s admission to hospital, little extra detail was offered.</p>
<p>Play Video 0:45 Raab says Johnson &lsquo;remains in charge&rsquo; from hospital – video</p>
<p>Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, who has now taken over temporarily with Johnson incapacitated, would only repeat that the prime minister “had a comfortable night” and was “in good spirits”.</p>
<p>Some Conservative MPs are worried that Downing Street’s evasiveness on the seriousness of the prime minister’s condition will undermine trust in what they say going forward.
