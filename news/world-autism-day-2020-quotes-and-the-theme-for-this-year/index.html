April 2 is World Autism Day each year (Picture: World Autism Awareness Day )</p>
<p>It’s World Autism Day today, which marks the 13th year the day has been celebrated around the globe.</p>
<p>World Autism Day seeks to raise awareness for the condition as well as awareness for research, treatment, and visibility for those who have it and their loved ones.</p>
<p>To mark the day – the theme of which this year is The Transition into Adulthood – we’ve put together a selection of quotes that celebrate autism and make us think a little bit harder about how we see those who are different.</p>
<p>Quotes to mark World Autism Day</p>
<p>‘My husband was diagnosed with what used to be called Asperger’s. He has autism spectrum disorder. He’s on the spectrum. And there were some signs early on. Once he was diagnosed, it dawned on me how funny it was, because all of the characteristics that make it clear that he’s on the spectrum are all of the reasons that I fell madly in love with him.’ – Amy Schumer, comedian and actor</p>

<p>‘Autism can’t define me. I define autism.’ – Kerry Magro, author</p>
<p>Amy Schumer (Picture: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</p>
<p>‘I wouldn’t be where I am today if I were neurotypical because I would have been interested in social things. Having a little autism helped me achieve my goals and not miss what most people thought I was missing out on.’ – Evan Delaney Rodgers, politician</p>
<p>‘I am different, not less.’ – Dr. Temple Grandin, professor and inventor</p>
<p>‘It seems that for success in science and art, a dash of autism is essential.’ — Hans Asperger, pediatrician</p>

What is ‘normal’? In this fortnightly column, Srinidhi Raghavan explores the understanding of bodies-minds and navigating spaces as disabled, chronically ill and sick people. Read more from the series here.</p>
<hr>
<p>As 2 April draws close, I find myself watching how the media covers autism. The date is observed as World Autism Day, with initiatives such as “Light It Up Blue” meant to raise awareness. Yet, world over, autistic people have challenged the normative idea of “lighting it up blue” with its harmful connotations, and sought a shift from ‘awareness’ to ‘acceptance’, celebrating April as #AutismAcceptanceMonth.</p>
<p>Autistics have reminded us repeatedly that they prefer identity-first language — i.e. they prefer to be called ‘Autistic people’ (identity first) over ‘person with autism’ (people first). This debate over how to address disabled people has been ongoing within the community and outside, with allies and governments, forever. However, non-disabled people all over the world shy away from using the word disabled, or autistic, deaf etc. They are far more comfortable with soft versions of the same word — focussing on the difference. Their behaviour, however, doesn’t reflect any acceptance of this difference.</p>
<p>Priyangee, a lawyer, defines autism as a spectrum. “Not everyone who is on the spectrum experiences autism in the same way. Therefore, do not assume that our ability to live life is limited in all ways. Do not use our diagnosis to make us feel small,” she says. This sentiment resonated with two other individuals I spoke with as well. For Rakshita, a teacher supporting students with special needs in an inclusive school in Hyderabad, accepting autism meant “giving up your way of thinking and being and willing to constantly unlearn and relearn”. A disaster risk professional, @TheBoyWhoGrewUpAsAnAspie was specifically advised not to talk about his diagnosis on Facebook and Instagram. “People don’t understand these things, is what I keep getting told,” he says.</p>
<p>Feeling the need for an outlet, @TheBoyWhoGrewUpAsAnAspie began writing a blog anonymously and found the process therapeutic. One of his concerns was that the moment someone says they are autistic, the non-disabled and neurotypical (those who are neither on the spectrum nor have any other developmental disability) think of it as disease. The focus is on “curing” the autistic person. “To be honest, this is the way I was born. I am just a different cup of tea, you know? Just because my brain is not wired like yours doesn’t mean I need to be ‘fixed’. There is a jumble of wires in my brain and I am learning to navigate these connections. It may be different from yours, but this doesn’t mean you isolate me,” he notes.</p>
<p>Priyangee also attests to how the diagnosis shifts people’s perceptions of you. She says, “One of the reasons I am glad I didn’t have an early diagnosis is, I know society would have limited the opportunities I could avail — not because I lack in ability, which I clearly don’t, but because they’d think I lack the ability to navigate through the neurotypical world.”</p>
<p>While receiving a diagnosis offers a certain happiness, a sense of finding home, it also results in a lot of discrimination and boxing. People associate the diagnosis with limitations more than with possibilities. For many of us in the disabled, autistic, illness community, being diagnosed means finding community, finding language.</p>
<p>“I was really happy when I got diagnosed,” says @TheBoyWhoGrewUpAsAnAspie. “I still smile thinking of that moment. I had a lot of anger issues back then and I was constantly thinking why am I suffering while others around me are enjoying [life]. The diagnosis helped me shift from seeing it as a problem to learning to manage it. Till my diagnosis, I didn’t know how to adopt [coping] strategies. Then, I learnt to manage it.”</p>
<p>The many myths attached to autistics include they “have no empathy”, “are uncontrollable”, “throw tantrums” etc. In this piece on being an ally to autistic people, therapist Prathama Raghavan quotes a young man as saying: “It’s not as if you (non-autistic folk) can empathise with the autistic experience, so maybe it is not a question of empathy?” A particular myth that came up in my conversations bears attending to: the use of terms like “high functioning” and “low functioning”. Amethyst explains this in her video, ‘Ask An Autistic — What about functioning labels?’ The label was created to rate how much an autistic person could do, and to assist in managing their tasks.</p>
<p>However, many autistic people have felt that even within the individual, a spectrum of functioning exists. “There is no such thing as ‘high functioning autism’,” says Priyangee. “If we seem high functioning in one area, it often comes at the cost of ‘functioning’ in other area. My high functioning at work comes at the cost of being messy at home. I cannot manage both, physically and mentally.”</p>
<p>One of the reasons it is believed to be so, Lydia XZ Brown says in a post on functioning labels, is because “most people equate ‘autistic’ with unintelligent, incapable of doing anything, relegated to special education, unable to complete post-secondary education, anti-social, incapable of choosing to have or not have sexual or romantic relationships, and eternally infantile. These ideas arise because of the ableism that is so pervasive in our society”.</p>
<p>This in many ways reinforces what I addressed in my previous column about being able to pass, or the arduous process of “faking well”. The idea of who is disabled is such a narrow line that I am not sure any of us can walk on it without falling right off.</p>
<p>How then do we behave around autistic people? Rakshita puts it simply: “Listen to autistics. Let them communicate however they want. Speech is not a superior way of communication. And autistic communication is not deficient. But most importantly, don’t try to change us. Change your perception, even if it is validated by a majority.” Or, as she writes in these verses —</p>
<p>Just as I welcome you</p>
<p>Take courage to let me in, too</p>
<p>Let’s intertwine, let’s dance,</p>
<p>Let’s flutter, let’s stutter,</p>
<p>Let’s hum to our different rhythms</p>
<p>Let’s find our own harmony</p>
<p>Listen…</p>
<p>Let’s make being together our mission.</p>

<h3 id="world-autism-awareness-day-2020-what-is-autism-spectrum-disorder-and-how-common-is-it">World Autism Awareness Day 2020: What is autism spectrum disorder and how common is it?</h3>

World Autism Awareness Week takes place this year from Monday 30 March to Sunday 5 April, while World Autism Awareness Day is being held on Thursday 2 April.</p>
<p>Last year, actor and comedian Amy Schumer revealed that her husband, Chris Fischer, had been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).</p>
<p>In her Netflix special titled Amy Schumer: Growing, the 37-year-old comedian talks openly about her personal life, including her marriage and her husband’s health.</p>
<p>Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines</p>
<p>“I knew from the beginning that my husband’s brain was a little different than mine,” Schumer says in the hour-long stand-up show. “I have to start this over because I really want to get this right because I love him very much.</p>
<p>”My husband was diagnosed with what used to be called Asperger’s. He has an autism spectrum disorder. He’s on the spectrum.”</p>
<p>The I Feel Pretty actor said there were early signs of the condition when she first started dating Fischer, who she married in 2018.</p>
<p>“Once he was diagnosed, it dawned on me how funny it was, because all of the characteristics that make it clear that he’s on the spectrum are all of the reasons that I fell madly in love with him. That’s the truth,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>“He says whatever is on his mind. He keeps it so real. He doesn’t care about social norms or what you expect him to say or do,“ she added.</p>
<p>So what is autism spectrum disorder and how common is it? Here’s everything you need to know:</p>
<p>What is autism spectrum disorder?</p>
<p>Autism is a lifelong developmental disability that affects how people perceive the world and interact with others, the National Autistic Society (NAS) states.</p>
<p>A person with autism experiences their surroundings differently to others, which can impact their communication skills and their ability to relate to others.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, autism is a spectrum condition meaning that while all autistic people share certain characteristics, they can experience the condition in different ways.</p>
<p>How common is it?</p>
<p>There are around 700,000 autistic people in the UK – that’s more than one in 100 people, according to the NAS.</p>
<p>People from all nationalities and cultural, religious and social backgrounds can have autism, although it appears to affect more men than women.</p>
<p>There are a number of theories as to why more men and boys than women and girls receive an autism diagnosis, including genetic differences and the idea that that women and girls are better at masking or camouflaging their difficulties. You can read more about gender and autism here.</p>
<p>What are the symptoms?</p>
<p>Two people will not experience ASD in the same way as it has a variety of effects. However, there are some uniting factors.</p>
<p>In particular, understanding and relating to other people, and taking part in everyday life can be more difficult.</p>
<p>The NAS states that people with autism may feel as though others “don’t understand them” and often have difficulty “recognising or understanding others’ feelings and intentions”.</p>
<p>As a result, people with autism can appear to be insensitive, seek out time alone and behave in a way thought to be socially inappropriate, the NHS states.</p>
<p>People with autism also tend to engage in repetitive behaviour and routines. For example, they “may want to always travel the same way to and from school or work, or eat exactly the same food for breakfast”.</p>
<p>Many people with autism spectrum disorder also experience over or under-sensitivity to sounds, touch, tastes, smells, light, colours, temperatures or pain.</p>
<p>Autism also affects a person’s cognitive abilities, with around 70 per cent of children having a non-verbal IQ of 70 or below, with 100 considered the average.</p>
<p>However, Asperger Syndrome, which is a form of autism, is linked with average or above average levels of intelligence.</p>
<p>How can people with autism spectrum disorder be supported?</p>
<p>Autism is a life-long condition and many people see it is an important part of their identity.</p>
<p>However, there are a number of strategies and behavioural programmes that help to enable learning and development which people with autism may find helpful.</p>
<p>If your child has autism, it’s also good idea to find out as much as you can about autism.</p>
<p>The NHS recommends a number of interventions that can help your child’s development, including:</p>
<p>communication skills – such as using pictures, sign language or both to help communicate as speech and language skills can be significantly delayed</p>
<p>social interaction skills – play-based strategies, comic strips and some computer-based interventions can help</p>
<p>imaginative play skills – such as encouraging pretend play</p>
<p>learning skills – such as pre-learning skills to help concentration, reading, writing and maths</p>
<p>Detailed advice and support programmes are also available for parents of children recently diagnosed with autism.</p>
<p>For example, the EarlyBird programme provided by the NAS is a free three-month course for parents of an autistic child under the age of five.</p>
<p>You can also find local and national services for families on the NAS’s Autism Services Directory.</p>
<p>Adults with autism can join the NAS’s online community to connect with other autistic adults or call the Autism Helpline on 0808 800 4104.</p>
<p>If you think you or a loved one has autism, contact your GP.
