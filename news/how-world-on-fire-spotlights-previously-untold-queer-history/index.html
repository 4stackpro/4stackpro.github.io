Albert is clearly the gender mirror to Connie’s (Yrsa Daley-Ward) story, but also her opposite in terms of military status and how they define their nationalities. This is important because, as a professional musician, war would likely end Albert’s career. Connie has a strong Manchester accent while Albert has a faint trace of a non-Parisian accent. His adamance in defining his nationality as French indicates he likely immigrated from a former colony. Before the war, many people from the colonies moved to Paris for improved educational and employment opportunities. In an era where various nationalist movements legally or socially stripped citizenship from naturalized citizens, Albert is defying these trends in his own way.</p>
<p>Webster and Albert’s budding romance in Episodes 2 and 3 takes a common period romance trope and redefines it. Just as Caroline Penvenen on Poldark uses a medical appointment excuse to flirt with Dr. Dwight Enys, Albert visits Webster at the hospital after an injury, however World on Fire breaks from other period dramas by normalizing queer expressions of affection. The camera doesn’t shy away from Webster and Albert in bed together or kissing. Although Albert and Webster have to distance themselves on a park bench, the show treats their relationship with just as much sympathy as Kasia (Zofia Wichłacz) and Harry (Jonah-Hauer King)’s short-lived marriage. The audience gets the sense Webster is falling in love for the first time and Albert is showing him how to undo all of the years of repressed desire.</p>
<p>Few previous period dramas depict the experiences of gay men during World War II. In an interview for the BBC, screenwriter Peter Bowker said: “We are hopefully now at a time where we can tell a story about two gay men living during the Second World War that is not sublimated into Brief Encounter.” Although Home Fires combines military and civilian queer experiences, thee queer characters featured are British women. Cabaret and Bent have theater and film adaptations that present the German gay experience in which Nazi party suppression was implemented several years before the war. Bowker’s careful research into the era proves that, just because these stories were not featured before, they have always been there, waiting to be told.</p>
<p>Albert’s story is also an opportunity to explore black identity outside of American or British history. The French also have a very long history with colonialism and slavery, but differences in government structure, culture, and religion altered the course of French colonialism. Black characters in period dramas are frequently framed through a distinctly American or British cultural lens. Although some may question Albert’s career choice as a trope, Paris between the wars was a refuge for entertainers such as Josephine Baker whose careers were stunted by legal segregation.</p>
<p>Episode 4 brings one aspect of the war directly to Webster and Albert. The hospital is already showing signs of Nazi influence. Although the Americans are officially neutral at this point in the war, Webster is making the professional choice to align himself with the anti-Nazi armies. The rules say he must turn away Jewish patients, but he ignores them. He still treats a pregnant Jewish woman and he supports a Jewish nurse who decides to stay and fight.
