KEY WEST, Fla. — The vacation the passengers had imagined, a luxurious two-week voyage along the coast of South America to the southernmost tip of the hemisphere, turned into something else entirely.</p>
<p>Four passengers on board died, victims of the coronavirus. Many others began showing flulike symptoms, with nine passengers still in the ship hospital. The rest of the passengers from around the world who booked $3,500 passage on Holland America’s Zaandam are stuck in limbo, waiting to find out on Thursday whether the port in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., will allow them to end their horrific, nearly four-week voyage.</p>
<p>“Being locked in our cubicle room is definitely having a toll on us,” said Robert Rorison, a passenger from Surrey, British Columbia, who is in a 15 foot by 18 foot cabin with no balcony.</p>
<p>Image Robert Rorison described his experience on the Zaandam via text messages.</p>
<p>But with cruise ships widely blamed for spreading an illness the likes of which has not been experienced in a century, Florida officials weighed the potential consequences. As more ships come to port with sick passengers and crew who require hospitalization, local authorities were concerned that accommodating hundreds of patients from outside their cities could strain resources just when hospitals are already experiencing crushing volumes of emergency room patients.

<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/02/opinion/02leonhardt-newsletter/02leonhardt-newsletter-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.</p>
<p>Much of red America is finally going on lockdown.</p>
<p>After resisting the pleas of public health experts for days, the governors of Florida, Georgia and Mississippi — all states won by President Trump in 2016 — announced yesterday that they will be ordering their residents to stay home, effective Friday.</p>
<p>The turnabout from Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, was especially stark. DeSantis had previously allowed spring break vacationers to socialize on Florida&rsquo;s beaches, where they likely spread the virus. Florida, of course, also has one of the nation’s largest populations of people over 65, who are especially threatened by the virus.</p>
<p>The new lockdowns are welcome, because they will help slow the virus. But they’re also coming much later than they should have. A big reason that the virus has recently been spreading more rapidly in the United States than in Europe or Asia is the slow response from many American political leaders.

<h3 id="nonessential-businesses-in-florida-told-to-close-friday">Nonessential businesses in Florida told to close Friday</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.news4jax.com/resizer/Bm2cYOX_uZ2ZsnYd-rRdUp6HGRU=/1600x900/smart/filters:format(jpeg):strip_exif(true):strip_icc(true):no_upscale(true):quality(65)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-gmg.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QNLWBHDC2RD6PFHBMPTXSOT6EM.jpg" alt="img">
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – Businesses and residents are preparing for a long month with much of Florida closing its doors.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Gov. Ron DeSantis issued a stay-at-home order, which will go into effect at 12:01 a.m. Friday. It will stay in effect until May 1. The order closes all non-essential businesses around the state and urges residents to stay home in an effort to fight the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Many businesses in the Jacksonville area, including Linen &amp; Rust Home Furnishings in Orange Park, will be closing their doors because of the safer-at-home order.</p>
<p>“We kind of knew that it was coming,” said Will Comer, owner of the furniture store. “It wasn’t a huge surprise. Just a matter of when, not if.”</p>
<p>The next door laundromat is still permitted to keep its doors open, as it’s considered an essential business. Inside was Carmen Jenkins, who works for a doctor’s office.</p>
<p>“I’m just worried about the safety of myself and everybody else,” she said.</p>

<p>Not everything will close, and News4Jax has put together an article explaining what qualifies as an essential business.</p>
<p>Clay County Emergency Management Director John Ward said law enforcement is ready to go around and ensure non-essential businesses close up. He is concerned about the order and how long it lasts, in part for emergency responders who now have an added responsibility to enforce it.</p>
<p>“My fear is the longevity of this,” Ward said. “In eight to 10 weeks what is this going to look like on our staff members, what are we going to look like in community exposure?”</p>
<p>The executive order includes exceptions for people who are obtaining or providing “essential services” or who are involved in “essential activities.” It also does not specifically identify consequences people will face if they violate the stay-at-home order.</p>
<p>Barber shops &amp; hair salons are non-essential</p>
<p>Mo, the owner of Blazing Cutz Barber Shop, will have to temporarily close his doors due to the order.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be kind of hard for me to pay my bills, for my kids to go to school, especially now that they’re doing the online classes,&rdquo; he said. “I understand what the city is doing. I can’t cry and kick because the government is saying we have to close down. We have to close down.”</p>
<p>Imad and Christina Herfy own I &amp; C cleaners in Miramar. Their business is considered essential, so they can stay open, but they’ve seen production and revenue drop 50- 70%.</p>
<p>They said there are 5- 600 dry cleaning orders that need to be picked up and paid for.</p>
<p>“It’s sad, but I understand why they’re not coming in because they feel, okay, I’m not working. I’m not going to the office. I don’t need to dress up, Christina Herfy said.</p>
<p>The couple worries about their employees.</p>
<p>“I can’t keep them off work because they cannot afford it to be off work,” Imad Herfy said.</p>
<p>Mo said he hopes that his barbershop will be back open soon.
