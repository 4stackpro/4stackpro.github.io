When it first looked as if RTÉ would be sending its weighing-scale-armed Operation Transformation crew into people’s lives at this of all times, it sounded like an act of brutish sadism. Because the last thing anyone needs right now is to be weighed. Things are bad enough.</p>
<p>Mercifully, then, there wasn’t a sign of a scales in Operation Transformation – Keeping Well Apart (RTÉ One, Wednesday, 9.35 pm). This special version of the show is much more about checking the health of the head rather than the body.</p>
<p>That’s not to say our current physical condition was overlooked – fitness expert Karl Henry set two ad-break challenges where he ordered us up off our couches to jog on the spot and then do the Jumping Jack for the entire duration of the break. (It’s funny how one minute, 52 and a half seconds can feel like a week and a quarter).</p>
<p>Most of the show, though, involved checking in on families around the country to see how they were coping with lockdown, with GP Dr Sumi Dunne and clinical psychologist Dr Eddie Murphy offering them advice.</p>
<p>They were all having their challenges, not least the couples with children to keep occupied. As Sara Ryan in Cappamore, Co Limerick, who’s trying to work from home, said to her husband Dave, with whom she has three and four-year-old sons: “Go 2km with them – and stay there!”</p>
<p>But it was 61-year-old Ann Brophy, who lives alone in a third-floor apartment in Dublin, who was struggling more than most. Because of a number of health conditions, Ann has been cocooning for the past few weeks, so cannot venture further than her balcony. And the loneliness of the experience was getting in on her. “That sense of freedom is gone,” she said. “Suddenly you realise the only person you can really depend on is yourself.”</p>
<p>She passes her time watching people in the park below “living a life, with their families, their kids, their friends, and you’re up here and there’s nothing”. She feels like James Stewart in Rear Window, “only I don’t have a murder to solve”.</p>
<p>The arrival of Operation Transformation in her life was, then, a blessing rather an intrusion, the camera man on the crane outside her balcony the closest human company she’s had in weeks.</p>
<p>“What do you miss most,” presenter Kathryn Thomas asked her. “People,” said Ann.</p>
<p>She mightn’t miss Karl, though, when this is all over. After looking at her Fitbit stats, which is as offensive as reading someone’s diary or rummaging through their knickers’ drawer, he set her some exercise challenges when she thought she was doing just grand bringing in the shopping from her doorstep. “That is what I call an aerobics class,” she said.</p>
<p>And on top of that challenge, she had to join the others on Zoom through the week when a music teacher tried to teach them all how to sing.</p>
<p>“If it’s a competition to make people put their tellies on mute, I think I’ll win it,” said Dave.</p>
<p>But come the end of the show, the Operation Transformation choir assembled on Zoom to sing Kodaline’s All I Want. If there wasn’t something in your eye, then you’ve a heart of stone.</p>
<p>“This will pass,” Dr Eddie promised them, “you will have a life outside again.”</p>
<p>That’s all they want.

<h3 id="meet-the-families-taking-part-in-operation-transformation--keeping-well-apart">Meet the families taking part in Operation Transformation — Keeping Well Apart</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.waterfordlive.ie/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_16089750.jpg--meet_the_families_taking_part_in_operation_transformation___keeping_well_apart.jpg" alt="img">
In this special series of Operation Transformation, which starts this Wednesday night, April 15 on RTÉ One, the team of experts will focus, instead of weight loss, on connecting the community and reducing social isolation in this strange time.</p>
<p>There were hundreds of applications to take part. Over the course of the next few weeks, these families will allow us into their lives so that we can support them and through them support others during the Covid-19 restrictions.</p>
<p>The Gavins - Castlebar, Co. Mayo. Life on hold</p>
<p>Mary has moved back from Dubai, where her husband is in social isolatio. Her four daughters - Niamh (29), Deirdre (28), Ailis (24) and Roisin (20) - have all moved back to Castlebar to be with their mam.</p>
<p>They don’t know when they will get back to their regular lives. They are a very outgoing family, who are stuck with each other and are finding things tough in isolation. Who isn’t?</p>
<p>Roisin is studying first year Law in UCC, and while exams have turned into essays there is a lack of clarity about so many things.</p>
<p>Deirdre lives and works in Dublin and works in project management. She has left her fiance in Dublin. Deirdre was in the middle of planning her wedding and all things have been put on hold.</p>
<p>They are struggling to find creative things to do as a family while stuck in isolation. They don’t know what exercises to do inside and are sick of running outside. The family are struggling with routine at the moment. Essentially, the Gavins’ life, like that of so many of us, is on hold. We will see how they cope and hopefully we can assist.</p>
<p>The Ryan/Mongey family, Dublin. In Leaving Cert limbo</p>
<p>Emma is a dental hygienist, and Ray is a freelance visual effects artist – he has always worked from home. Lucy, 18, finds herself stuck, like thousands of others, in Leaving Cert Limbo, and there is Eve, 5, and Alice, 2. They have been in self-isolation since the schools closed.</p>
<p>As a family they are nervous about catching Covid-19. Emma is availing of social welfare for the first time in her adult life since her dental practice closed down. The family share anxieties like many others that they are going to get Covid-19. While they are ordering their shopping online, delivery slots have run out so they are doing click and collect and Ray goes for the shopping. They only leave the house for their walk together.</p>
<p>For Ray who has always worked from home, his routine has somewhat been disrupted as everyone is home at the same time! He’d normally be at his desk from 8am, but now it&rsquo;s getting closer to 10am every morning. Emma is experiencing sleep disturbance and wakes up in the middle of the night worrying about food and whether she will have enough to feed the family.</p>
<p>Lucy, at 18, is bored. Before all of this she was told to stay off social media, that she was having too much screen time. Now it’s the only way she can communicate with her friends.</p>
<p>Staying in is difficult – but she knows her mum would ‘kill’ her if she went out so staying in is the only option. With her Leaving Cert due to start in June, she just wants the decisions made. She and her classmates are discussing it all of the time – she just wants it to happen and if it’s not going to happen, for them to be told.</p>
<p>Ann Brophy, Dublin. Cocooning</p>
<p>Ann, 61, has asthma and COPD, and has been in self isolation for nearly three weeks. Ann is gregarious, and chatty. She speaks from the heart and is not afraid to be open and honest. Ann was married for 28 years, and she divorced 12 years ago. She is one of 11 siblings – they grew up in Ringsend, Dublin.</p>
<p>She has worked as assistant manager of Newbridge House and Farm for five years; she loves her job. She loves the people she works with and the groups, families and individuals who visit the house in Donabate every day.</p>
<p>Up until three weeks ago, she was never at home. She left first thing in the morning and came back in the evening time. Going for coffee is Ann’s thing – either on her own for some great people watching or with a friend for a gossip.</p>
<p>Now that Ann is cocooning her world has changed completely. At 61 she thinks she might need to re-invent herself – but how is she going to do this sitting at home on her own, not able to go outside? This is not who Ann is – she is worried her career is gone and how, at 61, will she start a new career? She is a person who has always been in control of her life, where she can go, what she can do, now that has been taken away from her?</p>
<p>Lots of questions have emerged for Ann, just like for the rest of us. This is a time of uncertainty where there are more questions than answers.</p>
<p>The Ryans, Cappamore, Co Limerick. Young family challenges</p>
<p>Sarah (33) and Dave (32) have young children, Cooper (4) and Charlie (3). Previously, Dave has experienced depression and Sarah has experienced anxiety post-natally.</p>
<p>Sarah works as a learning and development supervisor and David is an inventory controller. With young children they are trying to balance, work and family life.</p>
<p>When the pandemic hit Sarah was only just back to work after maternity leave. The family were beginning to readjust to their new routine and then everything changed.</p>
<p>Trying to work from home has been incredibly stressful for Sarah and David as they juggle video conference calls and minding two small children. Charlie is teething and his naps are all over the place while Cooper is craving her attention. They have no childcare now as the kids aren’t going to creche and they don’t want Sarah’s parents to mind the kids and be at risk. They are concerned about the future and how they can manage. This stress creates a lot of tension.</p>
<p>The Ryans are great talkers and very honest about their situation. They feel their routine is all out of whack, they need support and guidance on how to get through their quarantine and keep their minds and bodies healthy.</p>
<p>Operation Transformation - Staying Well Apart starts this Wednesday evening, April 15, at 9.35pm on RTÉ One.</p>

<p>Operation Transformation returned to our screens on Wednesday night - but not as we usually know it.</p>
<p>The show, hosted by Kathryn Thomas, is normally focused on weight loss and improving the health and fitness levels of the leaders, but now it has a twist.</p>
<p>Operation Transformation: Keeping Well Apart debuted tonight and it focuses on how different family dynamics are coping with self-isolation and the lockdown restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Kathryn and the team of experts - Karl Henry, Dr Sumi Dunne, Aoife Hearne and Dr Eddie Murphy - are here to help offering practical advice and tips that we can all take on board to improve our mental and physical wellbeing during these challenging times.</p>
<p>First we were introduced to The Ryans from Limerick, who are facing challenges with their young family. Sarah and Dave are parents to Cooper (4) and Charlie (3) and are currently struggling with trying to work from home and readjust to their new routine with two young kids. They spoke honestly about how their routine is completely out of synch and are looking for help on how to keep their minds and bodies healthy.</p>
<p>Ann Brophy from Dublin is 61 years old and cocooning due to the fact she has asthma and COPD. She has been in self isolation for nearly three weeks, and being a very chatty woman she is feeling the effects of loneliness.</p>
<p>Up until three weeks ago Ann never spent time at home and was very sociable, but all of a sudden everything has changed for her. She is looking for advice on how she can cope with the harsh reality of cocooning - she explained that she has always been in control of her life, and now that has been taken from her.</p>
<p>The Gavins from Mayo are an outgoing family who are finding being indoors tough, especially after having to put their lives on hold. Mary has moved back from Dubai, where her husband is in isolation. Her four daughters, Niamh, Deirdre, Ailis and Roisin all moved back to Castlebar to be together.</p>
<p>Roisin studies Law in UCC and is stressed over the fact her exams have turned into essays. Deirdre lives in Dublin with her fiance but came back to Mayo. She was in the middle of planning her wedding but that has now been put on hold. The family are struggling to come up with things they can do together while stuck in isolation and are hoping to get some assistance on how they can be more creative.</p>
<p>The Ryan/Mongey family from Dublin have a Leaving Cert student in the house - and she is not finding it easy.</p>
<p>Parents Emma and Ray are working from home while daughter Lucy is feeling the stress of the upcoming Leaving Cert. Also in the house are five-year-old Eve and two-year-old Alice, and they have all been in self-isolation since schools closed last month.</p>
<p>Lucy is bored at home and is spending a lot of time on social media to communicate with her friends. And on top of that, she is feeling on edge over when she will be able to sit her exams. The family are looking for advice on how to stay focused on their &lsquo;new normal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The show went down well with RTE viewers who took to Twitter to share their thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lockdown version of @OpTranRTE is hitting the right notes so far imo,&rdquo; wrote one viewer.</p>
<p>Another impressed viewer wrote: &ldquo;When I heard about #OTKWA initially I had some major reservations, but decided to reserve judgement until it actually aired. I think it’s been pitched perfectly &amp; reflects what we’re all going through!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These stories resonate with so many people&hellip; well done,&rdquo; a third added.</p>
<p>While a fourth remarked: &ldquo;Well done to the team on #OTKWA. A great service from the National broadcaster and nice to see different people’s perspectives on the lockdown here in Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well done to everyone #OTKWA that was a really great show which I think will really resonate with lots of people right now. Compassionate, supportive and non judgmental. Looking forward to next episode already,&rdquo; a fifth said.</p>
<p>Operation Transformation: Keeping Well Apart continues next Wednesday at 9.35pm on RTE One.
