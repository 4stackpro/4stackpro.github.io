<p>Since coronavirus hit the UK, there have been dozens of changes to how we shop.</p>
<p>From the initial panic-buying which saw limits introduced, to social distancing in queues and in store - something we once did without a second thought has now become full of rules and regulations to protect both supermarket staff and shoppers.</p>
<p>One thing which has changed multiple times is supermarket opening hours.</p>
<p>Initially many UK chains reduced their opening hours to allow their staff to restock the shelves safely.</p>
<p>Now some restrictions have been lifted, and so our sister title Essex Live has put together this handy guide on opening hours which we&rsquo;ve updated with the latest information.</p>
<p>Aldi</p>
<p>Aldi opening hours have now been extended until 10pm Monday to Saturday, and normal Sunday hours are still in place.</p>
<p>They recommend that the quietest shopping hours are between 7pm and 10pm, whilst mornings remain very busy.</p>
<p>NHS workers and the police and fire service have priority access all day every day with valid ID.</p>
<p>Asda</p>
<p>Asda supermarkets will now open between 8am and 10pm Monday - Saturday, and normal Sunday opening hours will continue.</p>
<p>NHS, care home workers and carers are all able to priority shop between 8am and 9am Monday, Wednesday and Fridays.</p>
<p>Stores will also be open an hour earlier on Sundays for browsing for health workers.</p>

<p>Co-Op</p>
<p>Most Co-op stores are now open between 7am and 8pm Monday to Saturday.</p>
<p>Co-op petrol stations also remain open until 11pm.</p>
<p>Lidl</p>
<p>(Image: Manchester Evening News)</p>
<p>Most Lidl stores are now open between 8am and 10pm on weekdays and Saturdays.</p>
<p>On Sundays, they are open between 11am and 5pm.</p>
<p>Marks and Spencer</p>
<p>Opening times at M&amp;S varied depending on the store, so you are best to check with your local.</p>
<p>Vulnerable and elderly customers get priority during the first hour of shopping on Monday and Thursday.</p>
<p>The same applies for NHS and emergency service workers on Tuesday and Friday.</p>
<p>Morrisons</p>
<p>Morrisons stores will now be open Monday to Saturday between 7am and 10pm.</p>
<p>On Sundays, the stores will open at 9.30am and close at 4pm.</p>
<p>NHS workers have exclusive opening hours between 6am and 7am every day apart from Sunday where it is 9am to 9.30am.</p>
<p>Sainsbury&rsquo;s</p>
<p>(Image: AFP/Getty Images)</p>
<p>On Friday, Sainsbury&rsquo;s announced major changes to its shopping hours and rules with new regulations around online deliveries as well.</p>
<p>In line with other major chains, Sainsbury&rsquo;s cut its hours shorter when the UK went into lockdown - pulling 24-hour shopping at all its large stores and harmonising opening hours to 8pm closures.</p>
<p>But from Monday the vast majority of supermarkets will be open from 8am to 10pm - much later than has been the case for the last month.</p>
<p>Convenience stores will also extend their opening hours to 10pm or 11pm.</p>
<p>Tesco</p>
<p>Most large stores open between 6am and 7am until 10pm.</p>
<p>Tesco Express stores will open as normal but will also close at 10pm.</p>
<p>Special hours for the elderly and vulnerable are available at all superstores on Monday, Wednesday and Friday between 9am and 10am.</p>
<p>NHS workers also have the priority hour on Tuesdays and Thursdays, as well as a browsing hour every Sunday.</p>

It will be an ANZAC Day like no other, with coronavirus social distancing restrictions meaning that Australians cannot attend traditional church services and marches to remember our war heroes.</p>

<p>Says a Coles spokesperson: “We work closely with government health authorities on the best measures to keep customers and our team members safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their continued advice is that social distancing remains an important measure to reduce the rate of transmission in the community.</p>
<p>‘We are grateful to state governments that have provided exemptions for trading on public holidays, which will assist in maintaining social distancing as customers have more options on when they do their shopping this weekend.”Coles has also launched a fundraising campaign in the lead up to ANZAC Day to enable Bravery Trust to support Aussie service men and women who have an injury or illness as a result of their service.</p>
<p>Until stores close on Sunday 26 April, Coles will donate 50 cents from every pack of Coles Bakery branded cookies or biscuits sold at Coles to the Bravery Trust. Customers are also welcome to make their own donations in-store at the checkout.</p>
<p>ALDI</p>
<p>An ALDI spokesperson tells New Idea Food that customers should check their local store’s trading hours on their website, as they vary from state to state.</p>
<p>‘This ANZAC Day, Saturday 25 April, selected ALDI stores will be closed or trading with amended opening hours. For stores that will be closed this ANZAC Day, Special Buys will be available on Sunday 26 April,’ says the spokesperson.</p>
<p>‘We always encourage customers to visit the ALDI website closer to the day for information about their local store’s trading hours.’</p>

<p>There are no special opening times for the elderly or vulnerable but there is a volunteer shopping card so people can buy goods for those who can&rsquo;t leave the house.</p>
<p>NHS and care workers can go to larger stores between 8am and 9am Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and 9am-10am for browsing on Sundays.</p>
<p>The number of shoppers in the store at a time is still being managed and there is a no-touch rule, with the store stating &lsquo;only pick up what you intend to buy&rsquo;.</p>

<p>When is Waitrose open, what are its store opening hours and shopping rules?</p>
