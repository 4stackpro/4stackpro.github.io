Mr. Guaidó said the temporary government “must be broad and include all the political and social sectors necessary to confront this grave emergency that is coming to us.” However, he maintained that it could not include Mr. Maduro or those of his supporters who, like the embattled president, were charged with drug trafficking last week by the United States.</p>
<p>With a power-sharing government, Mr. Guaidó said in a statement, international organizations may consider loaning Venezuela at least $1.2 billion to counter the pandemic, which he said could force people to “choose between dying from the virus or from hunger.”</p>
<p>In his speech on Monday night, Mr. Maduro appeared to threaten “all the plotters” to his rule with a brief reference to “Operation Knock-Knock” — raids by government security forces, beginning in 2017, that yanked political opponents from their houses at night. Several of Mr. Guaidó’s top officials, opposition lawmakers and a journalist have been detained in the past two weeks in the latest wave of the roundups.</p>
<p>The United States’ plan is based on proposals that were discussed last year between the sitting government and the opposition before negotiations broke down over whether Mr. Maduro would leave power. At the time, Mr. Maduro’s negotiators had also insisted that the United States lift sanctions against the government that have sought to cut off its oil exports and estrange it from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Mr. Abrams said some sanctions against specific people in Mr. Maduro’s administration could be lifted as their roles in a power-sharing government shifted. But he said the most bruising financial penalties — including those that freeze the sitting administration’s assets and properties — would remain until Mr. Maduro steps down and the temporary government is empowered.

<h3 id="new-spat-opens-venezuela-president-accuses-portuguese-cruiseship-of-act-of-terrorism-and-piracy">New spat opens Venezuela: President accuses Portuguese cruiseship of act of ‘terrorism and piracy’</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.portugalresident.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/RCGS-Resolute.jpg" alt="img">
Nicolás Maduro, president of Venezuela, has accused a Portuguese cruiseship of an act of terrorism and piracy.</p>
<p>This new diplomatic rift follows the sinking of a Venezuelan coast guard boat on Monday.</p>
<p>According to reports from the Venezuelan ministry of defence, the 184-metre long RCGS Resolute crashed into the patrol boat with 44 men onboard just north of La Tortuga islands. The impact came within Venezuelan territorial waters, and the Resolute then ‘fled’ – something the ministry has dubbed ‘cowardly and criminal’.</p>
<p>Speaking from the presidential palace in Caracas in the context of a Council of State to debate solutions to the Covid-19 pandemic, president Maduro elaborated on the debacle, describing it as if a “giant boxer of 100 kgs” had grabbed “a boxer boy” and hit him.</p>
<p>It was a clear “act of terrorism and piracy”, stressed the president, suggesting that if the naval boat “had been a tourist boat, (the Resolute) would not have had this attitude of wanting to attack”.</p>
<p>Portuguese diplomatic channels have sought to calm the storm by saying there are ‘conflicting reports’ on this story – particularly when it comes to the issue of where the collision actually took place.</p>
<p>Was it in Venezuelan territorial waters, as Venezuela is saying, or in international waters (which is presumably what the captain of the Resolute is claiming).</p>
<p>For now, the Resolute is ‘well out of the way’ in the port of Willemstad on the Dutch-controlled Caribbean island of Curaçao.</p>
<p>Maduro is insisting on a ‘thorough investigation’ while the crew of the Resolute is keeping quiet.</p>
<p>Meantime, some further light on the situation has been shed by a fleet tracking website by the name of Fleetmon.</p>
<p>Under a post headlined: “Cruise ship sunk Venezuelan Navy ship and fled, probably right decision”, the site explains: “Venezuela is notorious for seizing absolutely innocent merchant ships and crews and treating them like criminals”.</p>
<p>Even if the captain of the Resolute ends up being ‘found guilty in Curação or anywhere else’ he will have saved the people he was responsible for “from a very bad possible outcome”, concludes the post.</p>

<h3 id="homicides-in-venezuela-lets-go-over-the-figures-again">Homicides in Venezuela let&rsquo;s go over the figures again</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn-prod.opendemocracy.net/media/images/PA-30866355.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.jpg" alt="img">
It is important to first emphasize that since the 1960s there has been a consensus within all of Western criminology that the official figures are not reliable. Firstly, because not all the incidents defined as crimes are known to the institutions of the penal system (the so-called hidden figure). Secondly, because the institutions that construct the data are more aware of their own bureaucratic processes and categories than of the real phenomena, and furthermore they do not always consider the variables that are of interest for the analysis. Finally, because these data are not accessible to researchers nor are, they subject to verification or contrast.</p>
<p>It is important to note that when talking about crimes in general, this does not tell us anything. Crime can be anything that the legislator, who in this country it is no longer clear about who they are, can think of.</p>
<p>When official figures for crimes are presented, they are most useful to indicate the confidence that people have in the institutions of the penal system and whether they report crimes to the polices. Therefore, in a context of deep mistrust towards these institutions, it seems predictable that they will report fewer crimes. This does not necessarily mean that crimes have decreased; one interpretation is that people have stopped trusting these institutions.</p>
<p>It is hoped that this is less relevant in the case of homicides, not only because of the seriousness of the crime but because there is also a body and the formal process of a death certificate, which in principal should always be provided. Even in these cases it’s not so simple.</p>
<p>In this regard, there are four key aspects that must be taken into account to understand the debate on Venezuela&rsquo;s homicide figures:</p>
<ol>
<li>The different bureaucratic categories through which homicide can be defined</li>
</ol>
<p>Traditionally, the Scientific Criminal Investigation Body (CICPC) has been the main source of information on the number of homicides in the country. This institution for the construction of data on these crimes works through three main categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Homicides are cases defined by the Criminal Code in which a person intentionally kills another person;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resistance to authority: Formally, this is a group of offences established in the Criminal Code, which cover various cases ranging from threatening a public official or his or her relatives, disrupting meetings of public bodies, to obstructing an official in the performance of his or her duties. In no standard scenario is death considered as a result of these. However, it is under this generic definition that the CICPC, administratively and discretionally, also groups together cases of deaths at the hands of the State security forces (clashes, extrajudicial executions or executions), regardless of the legality or justification of the latter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investigation of death: this category would include deaths from apparently violent external causes, in which there is no initial certainty that they are homicides, and may include a series of different assumptions such as suicides, traffic or firearm accidents, deaths by drowning, etc.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With these categories, the authorities can use their discretion to make up for or reduce the number of homicides. Especially in cases of deaths at the hands of the police, bureaucratically called &ldquo;resistance to authority&rdquo;. In 2018 they accounted for a third of all homicides in the country.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Deaths at the hands of security forces (so-called resistance to authority)</li>
</ol>
<p>During the last decade, the lethality of the state security forces has increased considerably, especially from 2013 onwards, with big jumps in 2015, 2016 and 2018.
