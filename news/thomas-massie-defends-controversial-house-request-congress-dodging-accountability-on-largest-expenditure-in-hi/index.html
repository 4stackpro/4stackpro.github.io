<p>Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, on Saturday defended his actions in calling for congressional accountability in the final vote on the $2.2 trillion coronavirus aid bill.</p>
<p>Massie said Saturday on &ldquo;Cavuto Live&rdquo; that both sides of the aisle tried to &ldquo;dodge&rdquo; their responsibilities by summarily passing the aid package on a voice vote rather than putting their votes on record.</p>
<p>The lawmaker said that when he found out there was going to be a quick voice vote on the bill, he hopped in his car and drove to Washington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not constitutional to do any legislative business without at least half of the members of Congress present. And I also thought, if we&rsquo;re going to pass the biggest spending bill in the history of mankind, that people should go on record for this,&rdquo; he told host Neil Cavuto.</p>
<p>GOP LEADER MCCARTHY SLAMS MASSIE FOR ROLL-CALL DEMAND</p>
<p>Massie stressed that he was not trying to delay the bill, as politicians on both sides have claimed, but instead was trying to make them &ldquo;come to work.&rdquo; He said he is still stunned that the leadership refused his motion to take a recorded vote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This tells you what this is all about &ndash; they&rsquo;re all trying to dodge accountability,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Massie also spoke about how President Trump was outraged at his actions &ndash; with the commander-in-chief voicing rare agreement with former Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who called Massie an &ldquo;a&ndash;hole&rdquo; on Twitter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was not convinced [at my reasoning],&rdquo; Massie said of Trump. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he understood the parliamentary process I was undertaking and the fact that it would not delay the vote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Massie said he hopes to patch things up with the president because he supports many of his policies. While Trump has suggested that Massie be &ldquo;thrown out of the Republican Party,&rdquo; the congressman called it an honor to be dubbed a &ldquo;dangerous nuisance&rdquo; by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.</p>
<p>The Libertarian-leaning Massie previously tweeted a series of stark criticisms of the aid bill, pointing out that there is so much pork in the bill, dividing the $2 trillion sum by the American population would result in more than $13,000 being available to every citizen versus the paltry $1,200 stimulus check many will receive.</p>
<p>On Friday, Massie told Harrisburg, Pa., radio host Ken Matthews &ndash; substituting for Rush Limbaugh on his nationally syndicated program &ndash; that his goal was to prevent Congress from &ldquo;kill[ing] our republic in an empty room by unanimous consent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He told Matthews that he hopes his actions will make Pelosi think twice about trying to jam through another massive spending bill in the future &ldquo;loaded with goodies&rdquo; &ndash; because he will be there to demand a quorum.</p>
<p>In closing his interview with Cavuto on Saturday, the 49-year-old lawmaker said he feels like he&rsquo;s been &ldquo;run over by 400 sets of tires.&rdquo;

<h3 id="gerth-kentucky-politicians-like-massie-and-paul-embarrass-us-even-in-coronavirus-crisis">Gerth: Kentucky politicians like Massie and Paul embarrass us even in coronavirus crisis</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/03/27/PLOU/20b25b95-920c-4f9c-a222-4b02471db537-AP20087638160512.jpg?crop=2800,1575,x0,y0&amp;width=1600&amp;height=800&amp;fit=bounds" alt="img">
CLOSE The House approved a sweeping $2.2 trillion rescue package Friday after leaders from both parties banded together to outmaneuver Rep. Thomas Massie, a maverick GOP lawmaker who infuriated many colleagues by trying to force a roll call vote. (March 27) AP Domestic</p>
<p>At a time when we&rsquo;re all worried about the coronavirus and its impact on our health and our economy, we in Kentucky also have the added burden of embarrassment.</p>
<p>First, we had one of our U.S. senators — Rand Paul — try to infect the entire U.S. Senate with the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Then we had Paul&rsquo;s Mini Me — U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie — force hundreds of members of the U.S. House of Representatives to return to Washington, putting them and their staffs at risk of the virus, in a vain effort to block the $2 trillion coronavirus relief measure.</p>
<p>Thankfully, U.S. Rep. Anthony Brown, who was acting as house speaker pro tem, shut him down, declared the measure passed and adjourned the House.</p>
<p>Now members of the House can go home and shelter in place — or #healthyathome, sorry Andy — like the rest of the country and not pass the virus around the House Chamber like a joint at a frat house. Thank God.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to even understand why Massie would do such a thing.</p>
<p>Read this: Meet Rep. Thomas Massie, the Kentuckian who united Donald Trump and John Kerry</p>
<p>&lsquo;Frankly, he should resign.':: Massie&rsquo;s coronavirus comments receive backlash from opponents</p>
<p>Even if he disagreed with the bill, which he does, it was clear that the measure was going to pass. It had the support of Democrats as well as Republicans who aren&rsquo;t completely bonkers. Like Massie.</p>
<p>The smart and the humane thing to do was to register his objection, but announce that he would not do the unthinkable act of forcing a roll call vote.</p>
<p>But smart and humane are rarely used to describe Massie.</p>
<p>Sure, he has a couple of degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Some might call him an &ldquo;educated fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The average age in the House of Representatives is 58.1 years, and more than 200 members are over the age of 60, which puts them in a high risk group for the coronavirus. Rep. Don Young, of Alaska, is 85 years old. Rep. Hal Rogers, of Kentucky, is 82.</p>
<p>Sen. Rand Paul: Why I didn’t quarantine after getting tested for COVID-19</p>
<p>These are the people Massie wanted to bring back to Washington to vote on a bill he knew would pass no matter what. And to what end?</p>
<p>The boneheaded move made him an enemy in President Donald Trump, who tweeted that Massie should be tossed out of the GOP and called him a &ldquo;third rate Grandstander&rdquo; and a &ldquo;disaster for America.&rdquo; May have been the first time Trump&rsquo;s been right in the past three years.</p>
<p>Former Secretary of State John Kerry tweeted that Massie is a &ldquo;Masshole&rdquo; and that he &ldquo;must be quarantined to prevent the spread of his massive stupidity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hard to disagree.</p>
<p>The bigger question is, why in the world do we keep doing this to ourselves here in Kentucky? Why do we keep electing people who embarrass us over and over?</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s Paul who has time and again voted against the state&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a guy who rails against deficit spending but who supported a massive tax cut that benefited the wealthy but exploded the national debt. He whines during committee meetings about incandescent light bulbs and toilets.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s Massie, who has repeatedly embarrassed the state with his constant opposition to EVERYTHING. He&rsquo;s the guy who thought he would try to score points when Kerry was testifying during a committee meeting by forcing Kerry to admit that he had a college degree in political science.</p>
<p>Earlier: Kentucky congressman Thomas Massie confident he wasn&rsquo;t exposed to coronavirus at CPAC</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is just not a serious conversation,&rdquo; Kerry said, dismissing him.</p>
<p>He has sided with people who have hoarded much-needed things like masks and hand sanitizers during this crisis and then resold them at obscene markups.</p>
<p>On Friday, when he sought a roll call vote, he got zero support. Former U.S. Rep. Mike Ward said he called the House parliamentarian after the House adjourned and was told that not a single member backed his call.</p>
<p>Not a single one.</p>
<p>By the end of Friday, we can expect more than 100,000 people will have tested positive for the coronavirus. More than 1,500 have died.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d think that during a national crisis such as this, our leaders would at least try not to embarrass us.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d be wrong.</p>
