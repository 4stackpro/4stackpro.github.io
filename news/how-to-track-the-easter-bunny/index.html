Who doesn&rsquo;t love the Easter Bunny? Each spring, the generous rabbit ventures from his workshop to deliver candy, toys, and eggs to boys and girls around the world. But because that&rsquo;s such an extraordinary feat, many kids wonder how the bunny gets it done, and in what order he makes his rounds.</p>
<p>Enter: the Easter Bunny Tracker, a simple way to follow the Easter Bunny on his journey. No matter what you have planned for Easter Eve, tracking the Easter Bunny is a simple way to extend the magic of this whimsical spring holiday. Plus, it&rsquo;s the easiest way to get kids excited for what&rsquo;s to come on Easter morning (read: an overflowing Easter basket filled with all their favorite treats).</p>
<p>In order to track the Easter Bunny, all you need to do is visit the Easter Bunny Tracker website. The website sometimes gets overloaded with traffic, in which case you can click over to the tracker&rsquo;s back-up site. The tracker starts at 5 a.m. ET on Easter Eve, or Saturday, April 11, and follows the bunny&rsquo;s hourly movement. It also shows how many deliveries the bunny makes, the last place he visited, his speed, and how many carrots he&rsquo;s eaten.</p>
<p>Because the Easter Bunny Tracker gathers so much data, the website also has tons of interesting insights on the Easter Bunny&rsquo;s typical route. According to legend, the Easter Bunny lives on Easter Island, although no one knows exactly where his workshop is located. Historically, his first stop is Christmas Island. American Samoa is often his last stop.</p>
<p>Is the Easter Bunny definitely coming this year?</p>
<p>Little ones should have no fear that the Easter Bunny will come this year. The Easter Bunny Tracker found that the Easter Bunny will still deliver baskets and eggs. And like all of us, the bunny is taking extra precautions like washing his hands regularly and covering his mouth when he coughs or sneezes. That&rsquo;s all to say, the bunny is doing everything he can to ensure this Easter is just as magical as ever!

<p><img src="https://media.graytvinc.com/images/Easter+Tracker.PNG" alt="img">
Want to make Easter even more fun for your kids? Let them track the Easter Bunny’s movements before the holiday, just like they track Santa at Christmas. Easter may be a little different this year, but this activity will help keep the little ones entertained.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works: Starting at 4am on “Easter Eve” – aka Saturday, April 11th – have the kids log on to Easter Bunny Tracker. It will show his hourly movements as he makes his way around the world to deliver treats to kids.</p>
<p>The tracker shows how many baskets the Easter Bunny has delivered, how many carrots he’s eaten, the last stop he visited, and how fast he’s going. It updates in real time and gives his precise location using a sophisticated system involving radar, satellites, spotters in the field and other high-tech gear. The kids will love watching the Easter Bunny get closer and closer to their house, and if you’re lucky, it’ll help you convince them to go to bed on time, too.

Easter egg hunts are always a fun activity to partake in with your kids come Easter morning, but you bring even more fun to the holiday by tracking the Easter bunny&rsquo;s movement in the days leading up to Easter. After all, Santa Trackers have long been a favorite during Christmastime. So why wouldn&rsquo;t the Easter Bunny have his own tracker?</p>
<p>Although many understand the religious connotations behind Easter, there is much mystery behind the Easter Bunny himself. Legend has it the Easter Bunny leaves his workshop on Easter Island the morning of Easter Eve so he can start bringing cheer to kids all around the globe.</p>
<p>The kids will love logging on the next morning while digging into their Easter sweets to see exactly when the bunny paid them a visit the night before. GMVozd Getty Images</p>
<p>Starting at 5 a.m. EST on “Easter Eve,” or April 11, you and your family join the kids and] log on to Easter Bunny Tracker to track his hourly movement. The kids will love watching the Easter Bunny get closer and closer to their own house to have their own baskets filled. The tracker also shows how many deliveries the bunny makes, how many carrots he has eaten, the last stop he visited and his speed!</p>
<p>The Easter Bunny tracker is sure to give you major cool points with the kids, since the tracker updates in real time. Just make sure both you and the kids are in bed by 10 p.m. come Easter Eve since that is when the Easter Bunny visits the local area. The tracker is also accessible via app in case you are away from a computer, which means the kids can take it on the go with them while preparing for upcoming Easter festivities.
