<p>Congress leader heard saying ‘China will break Ladakh into 1000 pieces’</p>
<p>In the viral audio shared by Times Now, the Congress Councillor Zakir Hussain during his private conversation with a friend speaks about the 15 June India-China face-off in the Galwan valley. In the audio, he is openly heard lauding the Chinese forces and berating the Indian Army. He glorifies the Chinese Army saying that China would break Ladakh into 1000 pieces.</p>

<p>TIMES NOW’s Sohil Sehran &amp; Pradeep Dutta with details. pic.twitter.com/dJzjaTww38 — TIMES NOW (@TimesNow) June 19, 2020</p>
<p>In his conversation with his friend the Congress councillor furthers that “Modi kept shouting surgical strikes and China “captured” the Indian territory”. Spreading misinformation, Zakir Hussain tells his friend that China has captured 135 km of India territory. The Congress councillor shockingly claims that 222 Indian Army personnel had died adding that the Chinese side did not suffer any casualties. Hoping that China takes away Leh so that Modi loses politically, the Congress leader also makes a mockery of the martyrdom on Indian soldiers and lauds Chinese forces for killing them.</p>
<p>When the ‘friend’ asks about the safety and well being of the Congress councillor, he says that he will be alright and he just wants China to take half of Leh and Ladakh UT will be broken into a thousand pieces.</p>
<p>Congress calls comments made by their leader Zakir Hussain “private-talk”</p>
<p>Times Now has reported that after the alleged audio went viral and an FIR has been filed against the Kargil councillor, the Congress party distanced himself from the comment made by its legislator, calling it “private talk”.</p>
<p>BJP demanded sedition charges be slapped against the Congress leader Zakir Hussain</p>
<p>Meanwhile, BJP has launched a massive protest against the Congress party in Leh on Friday in view of the controversial remarks made by LAHDC Kargil Councillor Zakir Hussain pertaining to the India-China faceoff. Ladakh MP Jamgyang Tsering Namgyal, who led the protests, stated that the people were very angry about the remarks made by Hussain, an elected Congress Councillor. Maintaining that treachery with the country cannot be tolerated, he demanded sedition charges be slapped against the Congress leader.</p>
<p>Ladakh MP Jamgyang Tsering Namgyal asked why Congress was not taking any action against the councillor who openly glorifies China and berates the India Army.</p>

<p>Congress RS MP had also spread misinformation earlier</p>
<p>The Congress continued to insult the Indian Army with party leader and Rajya Sabha MP Husain Dalwai also parroting same lies as his party’s former chief Rahul Gandhi. He claimed that Modi government had sent the Indian Army soldiers without arms, which resulted in the death of soldiers during the clash between PLA and Indian troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) on Monday.</p>
<p>Speaking to the media, the former RS members Husain Dalwai also claimed that it was only the Indian troops that were killed during the Monday clash in the Galwan valley at Ladakh and went on to say that no Chinese troops were killed during the clash.</p>
<p>Echoing same lies as Rahul Gandhi, Dalwai went on to make false assertion by stating that the Modi government sent these troops without any arms. He added that the troops could have fought against the PLA but did not get any chance as they had only sticks.

Secular outlook has always been our culture; it has been engrafted into our Constitution and it is the constitutional duty of every Indian to protect that culture, whenever there is an attempt to trifle with it. The Apex Court of the country has ruled in Bommai case that secularism is the basic feature of our Constitution which cannot be permitted to be destroyed for narrow, power-grabbing purposes. India is a land where several major religions have taken birth and have enriched the cultural heritage of the country. It is a country which has received other faiths and has allowed peoples of different faiths to settle in whichever part of the country they may have chosen. India has been a country where saints and sufis have lived and explained the profundity of spiritual life without allowing it to interfere with politics. It is a nation where peoples of all faiths have lived together in harmony unless their unity has been disturbed by elements seeking narrow political gains

<h3 id="cpim-leaders-phone-call-with-kalamassery-si-puts-party-on-the-defensive">&ldquo;CPI(M) leader’s phone call with Kalamassery SI puts party on the defensive&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/8gwpho/article29338727.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/cusatjpg" alt="img">
An audio clip of a telephone squabble between Kalamassery sub-inspector Amruth Rangan and CPI(M) Kalamassery area committee secretary V.A. Zakir Hussain over the former’s alleged mistreatment of Students Federation of India (SFI) district president Amal Jose has put the party on the back foot, with the clip going viral in social media on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The five-minute-long clip has Mr. Hussain accusing the officer of having no positive image among the public and political workers.</p>
<p>He takes exception to the officer’s alleged misbehaviour with the SFI leader during a skirmish between two sections of students on the Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat) campus on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Mr. Rangan denied the accusations and argued that he had only removed the SFI leader from the scene and dropped him at the student amenity centre to defuse the tension.</p>
<p>At one point, Mr. Hussain is heard asking the officer to understand the politics in Kalamassery to which Mr. Rangan said the political colour of the place hardly matters to him.</p>
<p>Mr. Hussain later told The Hindu that he had not threatened the officer with transfer but had been very polite with him. “He leaked the audio clip of the conversation, which is inappropriate for a police officer to do. He might be recording all his telephone conversations, including those with his senior officers,” said Mr. Hussain, who was reinstated by the party as its Kalamassery area secretary recently after an internal inquiry gave him a clean chit over an allegation that he had threatened a local businessman.</p>
<p>CPI(M) district secretary C.N. Mohanan said the party would petition the Chief Minister, who holds the Home portfolio, against the police officer. “While we have nothing against anyone’s political affiliation, a police officer shouldn’t act based on that,” Mr. Mohanan said, accusing the officer of being a worker of a students’ outfit antithetical to SFI while in college.</p>
<p>A confrontation between SFI activists and participants of an Onam procession taken out by the inmates of Sahara hostel led to the tension. A participant had sustained a head injury in the fracas.</p>
<p>Mr. Hussain said that the Onam procession was scheduled to match the timing of the victory procession of SFI following their win in the Cusat union election and that the SFI activists were pelted with stones by the other side.</p>
<p>The police, however, said that the Onam procession was taken out only after the SFI’s procession got over and that the confrontation happened when the hostellers were returning. “We are not sure who caused the provocation. There is a running feud between SFI and the hostellers since the former lost the election for the hostel administration earlier this year,” police sources said.</p>
<p>The police have registered a case against five SFI activists under IPC Section 324 (Voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) in connection with the alleged assault.

<h3 id="calling-all-secular-muslims">&ldquo;Calling all secular Muslims&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2020/4/26/w600X390/Eid1_EPS.jpg" alt="img">
Ravi Shankar By</p>
<p>Politics is the art of meeting great expectations by creating and protecting institutions. The Constitution was drawn up to meet the expectations of newborn India. Politics also betrays institutions; the Preamble, which defined the country as a ‘sovereign democratic republic’, was amended during the Emergency to “sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic”.</p>
<p>‘Sovereign’ and ‘democratic’ are running on all cylinders. ‘Socialist’ is out of oxygen. The contentious part is ‘Secular’, first disapproved by Nehru and added by his daughter later. Nationalists insist that India belongs to Hindus and secularism is execrable Leftist twaddle, meant to entrench ideological supremacy. India is 80 percent Hindu and 13.4 per cent Muslim. Since Hindus are the big brothers, liberals plead it’s woke to be secular. Why don’t they expect Muslims to be secular, too?</p>
<p>The liberal argument that the majority ghettoised Muslims is taradiddle because Hindutva, with its Senas and trolls, is a recent phenomenon. The 19th century Islamic reformer Sir Syed Ahmed Khan had accused the British of maligning Muslims as the real force behind the 1857 Mutiny. For decades, the Congress party had positioned itself as the Muhammad Ali of Indian Muslims. It had distinguished leaders like Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Badruddin Tyabji, Dr Zakir Husain, Jinnah et al. Suraiya Tyabji, who designed the Indian national flag, was Muslim.</p>
<p>With such eminent figures in their pantheon, why do Indian Muslims lack a universally acceptable contemporary face to intellect-shame wrestlers and filmy barnacles riding the saffron gravy train? Indian secularists are predominantly Hindu. The current Indian Muslim leadership is identified with the Owaisis, Deobandis and Tablighis instead of Azad or Tyabji. The Jamaat’s contagious conduct has painted Islam an unkind shade of green. Paradoxically, the Muslim voices against Hindutva come from the pro-Modi Arab world, which provides jobs to millions of Hindus.</p>
<p>The reason of Indian Muslim leadership’s credibility gap is intellectual poverty, excessive scriptural dependence, poor education and Hinduphobia. Theologists dictate personal laws. Deeply paranoid about science, the mullahs drive away doctors and inoculation staff with stones and curses. Muslims rue that the vicious chorus of Hindutva drowns their voices; yet there is no Muslim Ramachandra Guha, Arundhati Roy or Rajmohan Gandhi to make their case. It’s not enough to take refuge in the “We are all Indians” argument and expect the minority politics genie to get back into the bottle—the conversation was Constitutionally polarised decades ago.</p>
<p>Perhaps, the Mohammedan needs a 21st century Sir Syed, whose reformist emphasis was on Mu tazila—a rationalist and liberal interpretation of the Quran, making it relatable to science and modernism. The Indian Muslim can take the place he deserves only by being a secular Indian willing to engage the nationalist conversation by taking a cosmopolitan position. This means looking outwards when someone else is looking in.</p>

<h3 id="hydroxycholroquine-diplomacy-international-politics-and-covid-19">&ldquo;Hydroxycholroquine Diplomacy: International Politics and COVID-19&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/India-US-flag-09892948uqr98734038.jpg?fit=1194%2C672&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
On the 5th of April 2020, the United States President Donald Trump requested for the release of US order of Hydroxycholroquine which is considered as a possible relief drug for fight against COVID-19. On the very next day of request the release of excess drug was approved by the Indian government. One of the observations that one could make from such dealing is that it was not a usual diplomatic exchange between two countries. It was an exchange of special nature wherein personal rapport between the leaders of both countries has yielded a positive outcome while the fight against Covid-19 pandemic is still continuing in a collective manner globally. Due to proactive diplomatic decision making of the government India has offered a helping hand to United States which would create a mark for the country in the global diplomacy and politics. Such diplomatic exchange is a big achievement for the country which has adopted the Hindu philosophy of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam“.</p>
<p>While on the face it might appear that United States must have put some conditions for accepting such delivery but in this situation India was in a position to put conditions while making the delivery of relief drug. This exchange might also appear unilateral at first glance but if one observes some patterns in the Indian pharmaceutical industry then it would not be wrong to say that some dealings indeed took place which is beneficial for country’s economy and exports. Some of the major pharmaceutical exporting companies got United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) approval which would benefit these companies in selling their drugs in the US pharmaceutical market, earlier these drugs were not allowed by USFDA to be sold in the US markets. Interestingly, one of the major pharmaceutical exporter and manufacturer named as Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. got USFDA approval on 9th of April 2020 as per its press release. The approved drug which was allowed by US authority is “fluoxitine” which is used for the treatment of major depressive disorders. It is a widely consumed across United States as a prescription drug and it is one the most popular drug for treatment of depressive disorder.</p>
<p>Read: Hydroxychloroquine helps Covid-19 patients, but here is the list who should not use it</p>
<p>The timing of such press release is important because possibly such approval had come during the release of hydroxychloroquine relief drug from India. Similarly, on the same date i.e. on 9th of April other major pharmaceutical companies like Cipla got final approval from USFDA for marketing its generic version of “Proventil Inhalation Aerosol” which is commonly used for treating respiratory diseases. Granules India Ltd. which is also a major manufacturer of pharmaceutical formulations got approval from US Food &amp; Drug Administration (USFDA) of Colchicine Tablets used for the treatment of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) on the same day i.e. 9thApril. Another pharmaceutical company which was not allowed to market their drug in the US is IPCA Labs. It is a major manufacturer of hydroxychloroquine which did not have USFDA approval before the export ban was lifted by the government for making the delivery of the drug.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as per a recent report the USFDA has cleared four Indian manufacturing plants in past 10 days. This development has come amid supply-chain disruptions due to Covid-19 induced drug shortages. On 13th April, Lupin one of the largest generic drug supplier in the US and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories received their inspection report where they were allowed to manufacture and market their formulation in the US market. Another Bangalore based Strides Pharmaceutical Company received manufacturing clearance after an inspection in March. Such positive developments for the Indian pharmaceutical industry are beneficial for the country’s economy and exports and it again reinforces the belief that some diplomatic dealings were on the table while India lifted the export ban on hydroxychloroquine, which is considered a drug that can help Covid-19 patients.</p>
<p>The appreciation made by the US president Donald Trump via twitter after successful receipt of the drug projects India as a global leader in combating this pandemic situation. It highlights that the diplomatic prowess of Prime Minister Modi has yielded positive results for the country and its economy. Similarly, the humanitarian help rendered by the country to Israel and Brazil has earned appreciation and applauds across globe and it has projected India as a key player during the time of crisis. Amusingly, the Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro invoked Ramayana reference when he appreciated the Prime Minister while drawing Lord Hanuman metaphor of procuring life saving drug by acting on time with dedicated efforts. The government is also planning to supply the relief drug to neighboring countries like Nepal, Sri Lanka, Mauritius and Bangladesh in the near future which would help in building country’s towering image in the South Asian region. The extraordinary complexity of the Corona virus outbreak is urgent for nations across the world to quench the spread of the disease and rising mortality rates. Within this initiative, the Indian pharmaceutical industry will certainly play a key role, not only because of its traditionally growing medicinal and research abilities, but also because of its current promising strides within seeking a viable long term virus vaccine.</p>
<p>As per a recent report, the Serum Institute of India (SII) in collaboration with American-based Company Codagenix has announced the production of a possible Coronavirus vaccination, which could be viable and hopefully market-ready by 2022. While this is one of a small number of companies working on a feasible virus vaccine, there are high expectations from the SII, considering its years of experience in the field: the company is the world’s largest producer of vaccines, and is a prominent producer of many widely used and successful vaccines worldwide, including for polio, tetanus, diphtheria, and measles among several others. To sum up the entire discussion it could be clearly observed that the supply of hydroxychloroquine drug would be a step towards projecting the country as a global leader during the time of crisis and the joint efforts for developing vaccine by both countries (US and India) would project robust global partnership between India &amp; US for the fight against Covid-19 pandemic.

<h3 id="is-lack-of-leadership-why-indian-muslims-are-falling-behind">&ldquo;Is Lack of Leadership why Indian Muslims are Falling Behind?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.newsclick.in/sites/default/files/2020-05/indian%20muslim_0.jpg" alt="img">
Representational Image.</p>
<p>Indian Muslims face a double whammy of acute repression at the hands of the state and lack of leaders who can effectively present their point of view. The community feels boxed in and fearful of the future because new forms of subjugation—mob lynching, vilification by media, denigration in the garb of fighting a pandemic, multiple let-downs even in the law courts—are being normalised.</p>
<p>To be fair, things were never rosy for Indian Muslims, particularly after the demolition of the Babri masjid. But of late they have had to confront even the possibility of disenfranchisement through the CAA-NPR-NRC triad. Naturally, the circumstances have given fresh momentum to the talk about Muslim leadership. But is a new crop of Muslim leaders what the community desires and needs? And who could be such a leader?</p>
<p>After Independence, religious leaders and Islamist organisations flourished among Indian Muslims. This happened largely because the middle and upper strata of the community migrated to a newly-formed Pakistan, while the mostly uneducated and poor Muslims stayed behind. It is no surprise that religiosity thrived among them, as it does in any vulnerable section. However, this caused havoc within the community, as the religious leadership had no understanding of how to manoeuvre the community towards prosperity and development.</p>
<p>The ascendency of religious leadership made the lack of socio-political leadership even more sharply evident to Muslims. Ali Nadeem Rezavi, who teaches history at Aligarh Muslim University, tells me, “There is no Muslim leadership in India today, never has been, nor is it needed if we consider India a democracy. We never talk of a ‘Hindu’ leadership, then why a separate one for the Muslims?”</p>
<p>Yet, unfortunately, religious personalities have donned the mantle of “leadership” on behalf of the Muslims—a phenomenon encouraged by communalists in the majority community, says Rezavi, for it proves their point that the Muslims are aloof from the national mainstream. “The ulema have tried to further their own interests, to the detriment of the larger community.” Like any other clergy, those of the Muslims tend to thrive off the ignorance of the laity.</p>
<p>Asad Zaidi, a writer and the founder of Three Essays Collective, a publishing house, says that no inherent inability prevents Muslims from conceiving of a leadership, but there is an “iron-clad consensus across the political and social spectrum”, that they should not have one. Hence if Muslims attempt organising over socio-economic or political issues, it is dubbed as “dangerous and communally explosive”.</p>
<p>The trigger of Partition and the consequent formation of Pakistan is usually blamed for this, but majoritarianism, Zaidi points out, is an older evil than 1947. “Denying ethnic, political or religious minorities space has always been normalised in the subcontinent,” he says. This majoritarian sentiment, he says, “can equally reasonably be seen as having caused the Partition.” He feels that the anti-Muslim consolidation among diverse Hindu populations and other communities, such as the Jains, is key to understand the problem.</p>
<p>The burden of this complex and long history is such that the only “permitted” form of organisation among Indian Muslims is religious or quasi-religious. The leading lights of such organisations are treated by the media and mainstream political outfits as representatives of Muslims on all issues. “It does not help to say that this class of Muslim organisations failed the Muslims—it was designed to fail,” Zaidi says.</p>
<p>Yet Zaidi does not believe that Muslim leadership is fully in the hands of its clergy and therefore responsible for its lagging behind. He believes that the clergy are inherently incapable of leadership, for they lack its core essentials—a mass base, political understanding and even rudimentary acceptance of democratic processes. Nor do most Muslims look up to the clergy for leadership. For all these reasons, it cannot be held responsible for what ails the community. What he means is that the marginalisation of Indian Muslims is not a consequence of their “backwardness” but the other way around—they are neglected and therefore remain backward. “Not just government ‘negligence’, Muslims are victims of targeted structural injustice and violence,” he says.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, the story of Muslim leadership has gone from Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, the first education minister, to Bukkal Nawab, a Uttar Pradesh politician known mostly for his controversial statements, who left the Samajwadi Party in 2017 and joined the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. Besides, if political leaders do speak out on behalf of Muslims today, they quickly lose their voice in the face of majoritarian assaults. “The point,” says Zaidi, “is that unlike the Dalits and the backward classes, Muslims have not been allowed to politically articulate their socio-economic, political, even human rights.”</p>
<p>The result—or cause—of Muslim suffering is also their utter lack of effort towards building institutions within the community. There is not a single meaningful civil liberty organisation for the 200 million-strong Muslims of the country. For this reason, the police finds it easy to target Muslim youth without fearing the consequences. People arrested on flimsy grounds—such as the ones being picked up, without any proof, for allegedly orchestrating the February violence in Delhi—end up getting little, if any, substantive support from the community. This lack of sources where one can seek recourse coupled with state-led oppressions negatively impacts the community in the long run.</p>
<p>Mohammad Sajjad, professor of modern Indian history at AMU, says, “Efforts have been made [to set up civil rights organisations] but they are inadequate in quantum, reach and expanse,” he says. “If analysed minutely, they were not prioritised because the community was unable to understand why civil rights bodies are needed,” he says.</p>
<p>Mohammad Reyaz, who teaches journalism at Kolkata’s Aliah University does not believe that the clergy has held back the community. “No leadership should be above criticism, but the religious leadership do much more for the community through charity and other related works than the so-called liberal Muslim leaders who appear disconnected from the masses,” he says. He, too, holds successive governments responsible for the community’s present conditions. “There is government apathy and yes, after Partition, no true leadership could emerge among Muslims. The anti-CAA protests had given hope of some new leaders, but the ruling dispensation appears hell-bent on crushing them,” says Reyaz.</p>
<p>During the struggle for Independence, the tallest leader of subcontinental Muslims was Maulana Azad, a former president of the Indian National Congress and a renowned scholar who batted for a unified India all his life and antagonised many in the process, particularly the zealots who demanded a separate Muslim state.</p>
<p>There was also Maulana Hussain Ahmad Madani, who had admirers across the political and religious spectrum. A Deobandi alim or scholar and also freedom fighter, he fashioned the idea of composite nationalism or “muttahida qaumiyat” for Muslims in the subcontinent. Madani was incarcerated in Malta for three years, along with Maulana Mahmud Hasan, the man behind the Reshmi Rumal Tehrik.</p>
<p>Zakir Husain, the third President of India and founder of Jamia Millia Islamia is another such figure, a nationalist to the core who epitomised everything Gandhian. After he died in May 1969, the last of the last truly national leaders of Muslims was lost. Therefter, the community felt politically and socially orphaned, a feeling that has grown over time. There have been Muslim leaders thereafter, but mostly regional “faces”—or religious figures—and none attained the stature of this trio.</p>
<p>The desire among Indian Muslim, especially those well-educated, is that “the Nadvis, Jamaatis, Bukharis, Firangi mahalis and Jawwads can lead the prayers but they must stop talking politics. Each of them is propertied and rolling in money while the people they are supposed to be leading are literally starving. Their sons and daughters are getting a modern education, while the community they claim to represent is illiterate and steeped in ignorance,” says Rezavi.</p>
<p>So what would someone’s idea of a leadership for the Muslims of today be like? As Rezavi says, “They need a forward-looking secular leadership which can understand the social, economic and political interests and aspirations of the masses.”</p>

<h3 id="open-letter-to-mahua-moitra-for-her-litany-of-lies-promoting-sycophancy">&ldquo;Open Letter to Mahua Moitra for her litany of lies promoting sycophancy&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Mohua-moitra-TMC-MP-1130942.jpg?fit=1000%2C567&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
Respected Mahua Moitra Madam,</p>
<p>The role of opposition in a democracy can be quoted very aptly through the words of Walter Lippmann which goes as the following, “In a democracy, the opposition is not only tolerated as constitutional but must be maintained because it is indispensable.” Being a learned member of the parliament of the largest democracy in the world, I am sure you are very well aware of it. But your recent comments on the non-residential Bengalis as published in Anandabazar Patrika are very unfortunate, to say the least. Expats supporting the party are often deployed to defend the shortcomings. Whereas those raising questions against the Bengal government are being projected as uprooted (rather than non-residential) Bengalis. This derisive attitude is very unbecoming of your stature and against the spirit of democracy.</p>
<p>In your recent writing, you have put forward a lot of data from across the globe. I would like to remind you of some data from our own state of West Bengal. Our population is 7.54% to that of India. If the national percentage of COVID19 testing is to be followed, West Bengal should have carried out 43,720 tests whereas only 9880 tests have been conducted which is 442% less (at the time of publication of original Bengali article in Bangladesh on April 28th). Can you kindly explain why the numbers of COVID19 tests being carried out in central research centres were reduced? What steps were undertaken by the government to increase the number of daily tests? In the recent past, CM Mamata Banerjee had said that her government is considering the possibility of a partial relief of lockdown. But how could the situation become so dire within such a small span of time? Did the government not have enough information at hand? When the lockdown started, the Bengal government seemed to have set up isolation centres almost in a war footing. But as soon as the videos depicting mismanagement of these isolation wards went viral, the use of mobile was banned. Thanks to social media, news of closedown of Hospital units and midnight funeral of possible COVID19 victims (often without informing the kin) has come forward. Do the people of Bengal have no right to raise these questions?</p>
<p>As you have compared Gujarati and Bengali ex-pats in your writing, it is necessary to bring forth some hard facts. Gujaratis go across the country primarily for business and travel across the globe for business or job. Whereas Bengalis cannot set up a business within their own state. Syndicate, non-payment, high handedness is constant impediments that vitiate the environment. Scores of industrious Bengalis have gone bankrupt due to these troubles, what has the government done to improve the situation?</p>
<p>Read- West Bengal Doctors Forum writes to Mamata Banerjee asking that Coronavirus data should be genuine, transparent and verifiable</p>
<p>Also, the job prospect looks equally dire within the state. As soon as Mamata Banerjee came to power, she stopped SEZ and took a stand against FDI. The land is not being allotted; even the port construction on the Bay of Bengal has been stopped. There are no four-lane state highways; the land is not being allotted for national highways. Jiagunj-Azimgunj bridge construction has not finished in 10 years due to legal problem with only 1 Katha of land!! Metro rail was not allowed to invest 50% (like in other states) nor is the land being allotted, airport expansion was halted. The land was not provided for Kolkata Delhi freight corridor. No significant investments have come in even after 4 industrial summits. Neither industrialization has taken place, nor is there focus on infrastructure development. The last hope people had was government service. Now with the rampant corruption, that has also become a distant not so feasible dream for most. RICE, MICE coaching centres are on the decline as pupils are quickly losing faith in the exam.</p>
<p>The first IIT, IIM, IISWBM, ISI in India were set up in West Bengal, not Gujarat. Centre government constructed Teesta, Farakka, DVC in Bengal, whereas Gujarat paid for Sardar Sarovar Dam out of their own pockets. Gujarat did not have centre funding for industrial hubs like Durgapur, Haldia, Kharagpur, Saltlake, Kalyani etc, we did. But today, Gujarat is successful because their successive governments have worked for the state. Whereas Bengal, after suffering three decades of communism was already a sick state, Mamata Banerjee government has fared hardly any better.</p>
<p>Read- Doctors write letter flagging mismanagement of Coronavirus crisis in West Bengal, TMC MP Mahua Moitra says ‘you don’t even pay taxes’</p>
<p>We are researchers living abroad and we would love to return to our state and work for her development. But sadly, the present environment in West Bengal promotes sycophancy than talent. The pay scale of doctors in Bengal is equivalent to that of nurses at AIIMS. The humungous failures of the state government are beyond comprehension.</p>
<p>It is true that the total number of COVID cases is higher in Gujarat, but at least they are being transparent with their numbers, unlike Bengal. The present regime in Bengal is trying hard to suppress the numbers thinking of electoral politics rather than the health of the people of Bengal. It is only expected that concerned citizens will ask questions when a state government eyes for electoral politics at the time of a global pandemic.</p>
<p>Lastly, we may be ex-pats, but a lot of us are Indian citizens and we have a democratic right to ask questions to the government of the day. At least we are not demanding an UN-monitored referendum like our CM did in case of an internal matter like CAA.</p>
