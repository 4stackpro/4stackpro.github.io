SINGAPORE: Several measures will be put in place as households gear up to collect reusable masks from Sunday (Apr 5) as part of efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore.</p>
<p>On Friday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the Government will no longer discourage people from wearing face masks and will be distributing reusable masks to all households. As the COVID-19 situation evolves, there is now evidence that an asymptomatic person can still pass on the virus to others.</p>

<p>To minimise the rush and queue at collection centres for the masks, there will be several measures taken, Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing outlined in a Facebook post on Saturday.</p>
<p>Collection times will be spaced out by blocks and precincts to minimise queues, he said. There will also be priority queues for seniors and for those who may need assistance.</p>

<p>There will be as many collection counters as possible too, depending on the number of local volunteers.</p>
<p>“We would very much welcome residents to volunteer at their local RC/CC to help lighten the load,” Mr Chan said.</p>
<p>To simplify the collection process and minimise the time needed for each transaction, Mr Chan said residents can help by collating their family identification cards and collecting as a family instead of turning up individually.</p>
<p>Domestic helpers will also receive the masks, he said. “We should take care of them, as they take care of our families.”</p>
<p>In his post, Mr Chan also acknowledged that posting reusable masks to households was previously considered, but was not implemented for various reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, he said posting to every household will lead to a “huge wastage” as not everyone may want or need the masks.</p>
<p>“In the recent surgical mask collection exercise, more than 30 per cent of the households did not collect them or think that they needed the masks.</p>
<p>“That would mean wasting more than a million precious masks,” he explained.</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;To pack the masks according to the number of people staying in each household will require much time and manpower effort</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if we send an individually packed mask to each individual, that will again take much more effort and time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew on past experiences as well, saying there will be many disputes and uncertainties if individuals in particular households actually received their items.</p>
<p>The reusable masks will be given out from Apr 5 until Apr 12.</p>
<p>Residents will be able to collect their masks at their respective Community Centres and Resident&rsquo;s Committee Centres between 3pm and 9pm on weekdays, and between 10am and 9pm on weekends and public holidays.</p>

<h3 id="when-should-i-wear-a-mask">When should I wear a mask?</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.gov.sg/-/media/gov/covid-19/reusable-mask.jpg" alt="img">
Our situation is now changing. There is increased local transmission in Singapore, and a possibility of some undetected cases in the community. There is also some evidence that infected people showing no symptoms may infect others. This is why the WHO is reviewing its guidelines on mask usage.</p>
<p>The Government’s recommendation on the use of masks has been based on scientific advice and guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO), and that is for individuals to wear surgical masks only when sick, in order to protect others. This was also when Singapore did not have community spread of the virus. Singapore’s changing situation</p>
<p>WHO recommendation of wearing surgical masks only when sick</p>
<p>Prime Minister Lee, in his address to nation on 3 Apr on COVID-19 situation</p>
<p>Therefore, we will no longer discourage people from wearing masks . Wearing a mask may help to protect others, in case you have the virus but don’t know it. This is so that you keep your droplets to yourself - when you sneeze or speak or cough. It can also protect yourself a little better, especially if you are elderly, or vulnerable because of pre-existing health conditions.</p>
<p>Updated guidance from MOH</p>
<p>Given these changed circumstances, MOH’s updated guidance is for the general public to</p>
<p>Stay home</p>
<p>Avoid interactions with anyone other than immediate family members living in same household</p>
<p>Wear a mask if you are out and in close contact with others</p>
<p>For those who need to go out, and are unable to avoid close contact with others, then wearing a mask could provide some protection.</p>
<p>Wearing a reusable mask can be considered for this purpose:</p>
<p>Reusable masks complement safe distancing measures and provide some basic protection</p>
<p>The mask helps protect others from you, in case you are infected but unaware</p>
<p>Prioritising surgical masks for healthcare workers</p>
<p>Because there is currently a global shortage of surgical masks, Singapore needs to conserve these masks for those who need them most: our healthcare workers, and those who are sick.</p>
<p>Reusable mask distribution</p>
<p>The Government will distribute reusable masks to all residents with registered home addresses.</p>
<p>The reusable mask collection exercise will commence from Sunday 5 April 10am till the following Sunday 12 April 9pm. CCs and RCs will open from 10am - 9pm on weekends and 3pm - 9pm on weekdays.</p>
<p>Do check your community noticeboards, maskgowhere.sg or call 1800-SG-MASKS (1800-74-62757) for details on when and where to collect your masks. Bring along your NRIC, Birth Cert or any other identification documents with a barcode for verification.</p>
<p>Please wash and dry the reusable masks properly after use.</p>
<p>Priority will be given to seniors aged 60 and above. All residents in Singapore with a household address will be able to collect one reusable mask per resident. Family or household members can collect on the behalf of other household members, by bringing along their identification.

<h3 id="coronavirus-wearing-of-face-masks-will-no-longer-be-discouraged">Coronavirus: Wearing of face masks will no longer be discouraged</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/articles/2020/04/04/st_20200404_twmask04_55758562.jpg?itok=smGwcFUU" alt="img">
As recent studies suggest that some people can be infected but not show any symptoms, the Government will no longer discourage people who are well from wearing masks.</p>
<p>The move also comes in the wake of the review by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United States&rsquo; Centres for Disease Control and Prevention of their stance on the issue of face masks, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said yesterday, as he announced that the Government will distribute reusable masks to all households from tomorrow.</p>
<p>Explaining the new approach to the wearing of masks, PM Lee said: &ldquo;We now think there are some cases out there in the community going undetected, though probably still not that many.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We also now have evidence that an infected person can show no symptoms, and yet still pass on the virus to others&hellip; Therefore, we will no longer discourage people from wearing masks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wearing of a mask may also help to protect others, in case a person has the virus but does not know it, he added.</p>
<p>Hence, the Government will distribute reusable masks to all households, with surgical masks still being conserved for people who really need them, like healthcare workers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But remember, mask or no mask, you still need to wash your hands and keep a safe distance away from other people,&rdquo; PM Lee added.</p>
<p>On Singapore&rsquo;s previous policy to encourage only those who are unwell to wear masks, PM Lee said it was based on scientific advice and guidelines from the WHO.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We also did not have community spread in Singapore then, so it was very unlikely for you to run into anyone with Covid-19 on the street, much less be infected by them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health said in a statement that it will distribute reusable masks to all residents with registered home addresses.</p>
<p>The distribution will take place progressively from tomorrow to April 12, and collection points will be set up at designated community clubs/centres and residents&rsquo; committee centres.</p>
<p>Residents will be informed of the collection details via notice boards at their lift lobbies and precincts.</p>

<p>At a news conference following PM Lee&rsquo;s address, Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing said every Singapore resident will get a reusable mask.</p>
<p>He said the masks should be washed and dried properly after use, adding that volunteers will help to provide guidelines on usage to those collecting the masks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of us should try to stay at home,&rdquo; Mr Chan added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we need to go out to buy essentials or to work, and will be in contact with others, we may use the reusable masks to minimise the risks to ourselves and each other.&rdquo;
