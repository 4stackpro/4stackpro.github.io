Barcelona: Pep Guardiola, the Manchester City coach, has been hit by the devastating news that his mother Dolors has died after being diagnosed with coronavirus, the English Premier League champions said on Monday.</p>
<p>“The Manchester City family are devastated to report the death today of Pep’s mother Dolors Sala Carrio in Manresa, Barcelona after contracting coronavirus. She was 82-years-old,” City said in a post on their official Twitter account.</p>
<p>“Everyone associated with the club sends their most heartfelt sympathy at this most distressing time to Pep, his family and all their friends.” Guardiola, who has also coached Barcelona and Bayern Munich and spent most of his playing career with Barca, donated one million euros last month to fight against the virus, contributing to a campaign launched by the Angel Soler Daniel Foundation and Medical College of Barcelona.

<p>Ian Holloway says he would be looking to get rid of disgraced Manchester City star Kyle Walker if he was Pep Guardiola after the right-back broke coronavirus lockdown rules to host a sex party last Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Sun revealed on Sunday that Walker and his friend flouted the UK government’s strict measures by inviting two escorts to his flat. Just hours earlier, the 29-year-old had urged his Twitter followers to stay indoors amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>Walker has since apologised and is set to be fined two weeks’ wages by City. To add to this, the defender’s international future is in serious doubt, with England head coach Gareth Southgate said to be furious with his behaviour.</p>

<p>Not long after Walker’s apology, it emerged that Guardiola had lost his mother, Dolors Sala Carrio, to the virus and messages of support flooded in for the City manager from around the footballing world.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Former Crystal Palace and QPR boss Holloway, now in charge at Grimsby, has urged Guardiola to come down hard on Walker after the full-back’s ‘brainless’ actions.</p>
<p>‘First off I’d like to send my love and best wishes to Pep as he’s lost his mum,’ Holloway told talkSPORT.</p>
<p>‘The reality of that and then you have one of your players… it’s almost brainless.</p>
<p>‘What on earth are you doing having a party like that? It’s bang out of order.</p>
<p>‘I’d be looking to get him out of the club. It’s not right and it’s so irresponsible.’</p>
<p>Asked whether it should be the end of Walker’s England career, Holloway added: ‘Totally. It beggars belief.</p>
<p>‘Where’s the discipline? Where’s the actual discipline?’</p>

<p>A few days prior to his mother’s death, Guardiola pleaded with supporters to remain indoors and follow the government’s guidelines as City launched a ‘Cityzens At Home’ website for their fanbase during the lockdown.</p>

<p>‘We miss football. We miss the life that we had a few days ago but now is the time to listen, to follow our scientists, doctors and nurses,’ the Spaniard said.</p>
<p>‘You are my football family and we are going to do everything possible to make you feel better.</p>
<p>‘We’ll come back from this stronger, better, kinder… and a little bit fatter. Stay inside, stay safe.’</p>
