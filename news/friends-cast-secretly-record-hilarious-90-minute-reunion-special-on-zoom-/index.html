Friends cast &lsquo;secretly record hilarious 90-minute reunion special on Zoom&rsquo;</p>
<p>The cast have allegedly filmed a &ldquo;mock rehearsal&rdquo; online. Picture: Getty / Instagram</p>
<p>Filming for the original reunion show was meant to start in March, but production was put on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The cast of Friends have secretly recorded a 90-minute reunion special on Zoom, according to reports.</p>
<p>Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer have allegedly taken part in a &ldquo;mock rehearsal&rdquo; over video call as they remain in lockdown – and it&rsquo;s all been taped.</p>
<p>Filming for the original episode was meant to begin back in March, but production was put on hold due to coronavirus concerns leaving fans disappointed.</p>
<p>However, sources claim the six Hollywood stars have privately teamed up behind the scenes to bring to life an online extravaganza that could be released before the planned reunion show drops.</p>

<p>A telly insider told The Sun on Sunday: &ldquo;As soon as filming was cancelled, everyone started panicking as it took so long to get their schedules to align, there was a deep fear it may take a year or even longer to get them all back together again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Courtney immediately set up a Zoom meeting for them and they all logged on to discuss ideas - brain-storming and bringing in the producers for a session which they called a mock rehearsal and chatted for almost two hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The source continued: &ldquo;They’ve been having daily meetings and Jen [Aniston] - who has the busiest schedule of the six - has assured them she’ll do whatever she can to ensure they don’t have to wait months to get the reunion filmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their Zoom sessions have been brilliant fun, and there’s some hilarious material on there which they hope can be aired as either a series of teasers, or even a stand-alone special.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reunion special was initially dreamt up to celebrate the sitcom&rsquo;s 25th anniversary and help launch the upcoming streaming service HBO Max.</p>
<p>The latest update on the much-anticipated episode comes almost two months after it was revealed the Hollywood favourites were getting back into character for one last time.</p>
<p>Monica, Ross, Rachel, Joey, Chandler and Phoebe were set to reunite for what&rsquo;s sure to be a hilarious one-off show – sixteen years after the final scene aired on TV.

<h3 id="friends-a-weird-phoebe-and-joey-storyline-almost-happened">‘Friends’: A Weird Phoebe and Joey Storyline Almost Happened</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/favicon.ico?x62514" alt="img">
Friends could not have been pulled from Netflix at a worse time. The series was removed from the streaming platform in January 2020, shortly before much of the United States began abiding by stay at home orders amid Coronavirus fears. While the series will once again be available for streaming in May, it can’t come soon enough for many fans. Did you know, however, that the series almost looked a lot different? In fact, if Matt LeBlanc had his way, Joey Tribianni would have had a long-term hookup partner in Pheobe Buffay.</p>
<p>Matt LeBlanc suggested a storyline about Joey and Phoebe hooking up was tossed around</p>
<p>LeBlanc once thought Friends was missing a vital romance. He told several publications that he, along with Lisa Kudrow, had pitched the idea of revealing a secret friends with benefits situation between Joey and Phoebe. LeBlanc noted that the two wouldn’t have had an official romance, but rather, a series of hookups when they weren’t seeing other people.</p>
<p>So, how would it have worked? LeBlanc suggested that the idea was to throw viewers a curveball by revealing that Joey and Phoebe had been hooking up for the entirety of the series. His idea, apparently, was to refilm key scenes from the series but spinning it so fans would realize that the two were actually secretly hooking up the entire time.</p>
<p>LeBlanc didn’t go into how that would have worked in the context of their other romantic endeavors, but it likely could have been worked around. While Ross’ relationships often took center stage, as did Rachel’s, Pheobe and Joey’s love lives often didn’t include many long-term partners.</p>
<p>Ultimately writers abandoned the concept</p>
<p>While LeBlanc and Kudrow were keen on making the story arc happen, writers were less into the idea. LeBlanc recalled how he and Kudrow pitched the idea to writers, who dismissed the notion that the duo could have been hooking up for the duration of the series. It’s hard to say why the idea was scrapped. LeBlanc noted that they pitched the idea towards the end of the show, meaning two couples had already been established. Perhaps, the writers thought a third couple would have been too much.</p>
<p>By that point, Ross and Rachel’s love affair was well established, as was Chandler and Monica’s relationship. Chandler and Monica begin hooking up while visiting London for Ross’ doomed second wedding. Their hookup was supposed to end there, but they continued it once they got back stateside, only they didn’t want anyone to know. Much hilarity ensued as each member of the friend group finding out about the illicit romance. Ross Geller, of course, was the last to find out.</p>
<p>Would adding an additional romance have worked?</p>
<p>While writers may not have liked LeBlanc’s idea for a romance, fans do note that the characters had a special bond, and it’s possible a romantic relationship could have worked. One Reddit fan noted that Joey and Phoebe often discussed their special bond, but the series seemed to gloss over it, perhaps to make fans question their perception of the friendship.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the evidence. Joey and Phoebe once noted that they would meet weekly for lunch, without the rest of the group. Pheobe was also into the idea of a potential relationship, once noting that they would eventually end up together. Sure, it didn’t happen, but the groundwork was there for writers to move in that direction. So, why didn’t they? Bustle notes that a third romance would have been too much, but there is more to it than that. It seems that a sexual relationship between the two, even if it wasn’t romantic, would have really ruined the absolute best parts of their dynamic.

<h3 id="friends-theres-a-funny-story-behind-why-phoebe-had-an-identical-twin-sister--its-because-of-lisa-kudrows-waitress-role-on-mad-about-you">‘Friends’: There’s a Funny Story Behind Why Phoebe Had an Identical Twin Sister — It’s Because of Lisa Kudrow’s Waitress Role on ‘Mad About You’</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Lisa-Kudrow-1.jpg" alt="img">
With the exception of Ross and Monica, the focus on Friends was never family members — it was all about friendships among twenty-somethings living and loving in Manhattan. But because each of the six castmates must have come from somewhere, their on-screen siblings and parents showed up sometimes.</p>
<p>Phoebe Buffay had one of the most unique sibling situations with her identical twin sister Ursula. It turns out NBC worked Ursula into the storyline for a very specific reason and it all had to do with Kudrow’s other job on Mad About You.</p>

<p>Lisa Kudrow played Ursula Buffay on ‘Mad About You’</p>
<p>Originally, the unnamed waitress role in Mad About You wasn’t meant to be a recurring part. But Kudrow was determined to break into acting for real and brought her impressive improv and comedic skills to the part, prompting producer Danny Jacobson to expand the role.</p>
<p>As Kudrow explained to Biography, “By the end of the week, Danny Jacobson said, ‘You’re really funny’ and ‘Would you be okay if we wrote you into five more episodes?’”</p>
<p>She continued: “It was like, I don’t have to get a day job! I thought I would have to find some job somewhere in an office because I stopped working for my father.”</p>

<p>Her ‘Mad About You’ role helped snag Kudrow a ‘Friends’ audition</p>
<p>Kudrow’s Mad About You performance helped secure her an audition for the new comedy Friends. But there was only one problem — since both shows were on NBC and aired back to back, producers had to come up with a way to explain why they were seeing the same person with different names.</p>
<p>Plus, Kudrow loved being on Mad About You and didn’t want to give up the role for Friends, which no one knew would eventually become one of the most beloved comedies of all time.</p>
<p>David Crane helped create the connection between ‘Friends’ and ‘Mad About You’</p>

<p>Friends co-creator David Crane did some brainstorming with his husband Jeffrey Klarik, who happened to be a writer on Mad About You. The two came up with the idea to give Phoebe an identical twin sister, Ursula, to explain the two characters with different names.</p>
<p>“We had to go to [Mad About You creators] Danny Jacobson and Paul Reiser to get their permission, and amazingly because of that relationship… they were incredibly generous and let us do it, which is nuts,” Crane explained during an interview with Entertainment Weekly. “I wouldn’t let anybody do that with a character on our show!”</p>
<p>Kudrow didn’t love filming scenes with Ursula</p>

<p>Even though Ursula was written into Friends to help Kudrow, she allegedly didn’t enjoy filming scenes with her double, who was played by her sister. “Lisa really did not have a good time doing them,” Friends executive producer Kevin Bright told EW. “She did not like acting with a double, and in a way, she might have made it more difficult for herself because her double was her actual sister [Helena].”</p>
<p>He continued: “I think feeling the [stress] she put her sister into by being the double was more in her head at the time, so those scenes were a little bit tricky to shoot. But it ended up being a lot of fun when you put it together.”</p>
<p>But as Biography pointed out, her efforts were ultimately worth the aggravation. Kudrow was the first actor on Friends to win an Emmy Award in 1998. Maybe it had something to do with the Phoebe/Ursula connection.
