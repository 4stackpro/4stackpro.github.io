The Easter bank holiday weekend is usually a time for celebrations with friends and loved ones.</p>
<p>However, amid the lockdown this year, hundreds of businesses have been shut and millions of employees have been working from home.</p>
<p>But fear not, the bank holiday weekend is one of the few events in the calendar that has not been cancelled.</p>
<p>Here’s when Good Friday falls in 2020, and why it is celebrated:</p>
<p>When is Good Friday?</p>
<p>Good Friday has been an official bank holiday since 1871, but was often informally observed as a public holiday before that date.</p>
<p>This year, Good Friday falls on April 10, which is followed by Easter Monday on April 13. This is a bank holiday in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, but not in Scotland.</p>
<p>For the rest of the UK, Good Friday and Easter Monday combined give most workers a much loved, four-day long weekend.</p>
<p>Will Good Friday still be a bank holiday this year?</p>
<p>Staff shortages across vital sectors of the UK economy has led to some speculation that Good Friday may not be observed as a bank holiday this year.</p>
<p>But, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), which is in charge of the government’s policy on bank holidays, said Good Friday would be observed as usual.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for BEIS said: “Conventional rules around bank holidays remain in place.</p>
<p>“If workers who would not usually have to work on bank holidays are required to, then employers must still ensure that they receive their statutory holiday entitlement for the year.”</p>
<p>Will I have to work on Good Friday?</p>
<p>During the current economic crisis, many employees may be asked to work on Good Friday this year.</p>
<p>Officially, people do not have a statutory right to time off on bank holidays, and many workers in the NHS and other sectors often have to work them, due to staff shortages.</p>
<p>Most employers usually grant their employees time off on bank holidays, which then count towards their statutory holiday entitlement.</p>
<p>If asked to work on a bank holiday as part of their contract, employees are often paid more for doing so.</p>
<p>But, according to UK law, if a worker who usually does not have to work on bank holidays is asked to, their employer must give them another day of holiday in lieu to make sure the worker gets their full statutory holiday entitlement.</p>
<p>Why do people celebrate Good Friday?</p>
<p>Good Friday is a Christian holiday that commemorates the belief in the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, before his resurrection three days later.</p>
<p>Different sects of Christianity mark the occasion in different ways.</p>
<p>In the Roman Catholic Church, it is traditionally observed by congregations who take part in the Three Hours’ Agony, or Three Hours’ Devotion, a solemn service that begins at noon and ends at 3pm, the time at which many Christians believe Jesus died.</p>
<p>In the Lutheran Church, Good Friday is the most important liturgical day of the year, and members of the church often fast and abstain from work in observance of it.</p>
<p>In Eastern Orthodox traditions, Good Friday falls on a different date, due to disagreements with the Roman Church over the exact date of Easter itself.</p>
<p>On Good Friday, Eastern Orthodox clerics wear black vestments instead of their traditionally highly embroidered ones, and all drapings in churches are changed to black.

<p>Here are the key dates for your diary for 2020 which should make things a little easier.</p>
<p>When is Easter 2020?</p>
<p>Unlike Halloween, New Year or Christmas, Easter doesn’t have a set date on which it falls every year.</p>
<p>It can fall any time between 22 March and 22 April.</p>

<p>In 2020, Easter Sunday will be on 12 April, which will make Good Friday 10 April and the Easter Monday bank holiday 13 April.</p>
<p>Why does the date of Easter change?</p>
<p>Easter Sunday is decided based on a complicated set of calculations regarding observations of the moon.</p>
<p>The exact date on which Easter should be celebrated is something churches have debated for centuries, with various methods of calculation used by different sects.</p>
<p>To this day, churches in the east date Easter differently than those in the west, although sometimes the dates will coincide. In 2020, eastern churches will celebrate Easter on Sunday 19 April.</p>
<p>2025 will be the next year in which both hemispheres celebrate Easter at the same time.</p>
<p>How is the date chosen?</p>
<p>The decision on when Easter should fall each year was made in 325 AD by the first major church council, the Council of Nicaea.</p>
<p>The Bible dates Easter to around the time of the Jewish festival of Passover, which usually begins on the night of the first full moon after the Spring Equinox (one of the two moments in the year at which time the sun is directly above the equator).</p>
<p>However, during “leap months” – the extra month added during leap years according to the Jewish calendar to make up for the fact that the solar year is actually slightly longer than 12 months – Passover begins on the second full moon after the equinox rather than the first.</p>
<p>While 2020 is a leap year according to the Gregorian calendar, it&rsquo;s not a leap year according to the Jewish calendar, so Passover will begin on the first full moon – Wednesday 8 April.</p>
<p>Easter takes place around the time The Bible records it as having occurred, so it&rsquo;s celebrated on the first Sunday after the first full moon on or after the Spring Equinox.</p>
<p>However, things become a little more complicated once you take into consideration the fact that moon observations vary depending on which time zone they are conducted from. In an attempt to standardise things, churches in the west use the ecclesiastical full moon instead.</p>
<p>The ecclesiastical calendar breaks 19 normal calendar years down into 235 months made up of 30 or 29 days. It places the full moon at the 14th day of each month and terms the first full moon after the Equinox the “paschal full moon.”</p>
<p>Easter is the first Sunday to fall after this full moon, meaning that if the paschal full moon falls on a Sunday, Easter will be the following week.

<h3 id="pope-francis-approves-new-mass-in-time-of-pandemic-and-good-friday-coronavirus-intention">Pope Francis approves new ‘Mass in Time of Pandemic’ and Good Friday coronavirus intention</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.americamagazine.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_image_750_x_503_/public/main_image/20200401T0935-298-CNS-POPE-MASS-MEDIA.jpg.png?itok=gGasQYnZ" alt="img">
Pope Francis has approved two new liturgical texts to be used during the coronavirus pandemic: The first is a special “Mass in Time of Pandemic,” and the second is a special intention to be used during this year’s Good Friday liturgy.</p>
<p>The Congregation for Divine Worship has sent the texts to the world’s bishops and has published them on its website.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Cardinal Robert Sarah, prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship, wrote in the decree accompanying the texts for the Mass, dated March 30: “In these days, during which the whole world has been gravely stricken by the Covid-19 virus, many requests have come to this dicastery to be able to celebrate a specific Mass to implore God to bring an end to this pandemic.”</p>
<p>The texts, which were also issued in Latin, can be used for any Mass during the pandemic except for: solemnities; Sundays in Advent, Lent and the Easter season; the Easter octave; All Souls’ Day; Ash Wednesday; and Holy Week. The decrees are effective immediately, so the Mass could be celebrated using this text as early as today.</p>

<p>“In these days, during which the whole world has been gravely stricken by the Covid-19 virus, many requests have come to be able to celebrate a specific Mass to implore God to bring an end to this pandemic.”</p>
<p>The news was first reported on a blog hosted by the New Liturgical Movement then confirmed by Vatican correspondent Gerard O&rsquo;Connell.</p>
<p>Cardinal Sarah wrote in a second decree that a special intention can ordinarily be added to the Good Friday intentions “in a situation of grave public need.”</p>
<p>“The Celebration of the Passion of the Lord on Good Friday this year has a particular significance because of the terrible pandemic that has stricken the whole world,” the cardinal wrote. “Indeed, on the day on which we celebrate the redeeming passion and death of Jesus Christ on the Cross, who like a slain lamb has taken upon himself the suffering and sin of the world, the church raises her voice in prayer to God the Father Almighty for all humanity, and in particular for those who suffer most, while she awaits in faith the joy of the resurrection of her Spouse.”</p>
<p>The Good Friday intention prays “for all those who suffer the consequences of this pandemic” and asks God to “look with compassion on the sorrowful condition of your children who suffer because of this pandemic; relieve the pain of the sick; give strength to those who care for them; welcome into your peace those who have died; and, throughout this time of tribulation, grant that we may all find comfort in your merciful love.”</p>
<p>The text for the Mass in Time of Pandemic likewise prays for those affected: “Look with compassion on the afflicted, grant eternal rest to the dead, comfort to mourners, healing to the sick, peace to the dying, strength to health care workers, wisdom to our leaders and the courage to reach out to all in love, so that together we may give glory to your holy name.”</p>
