When is Passover 2020? Dates for the Jewish &lsquo;Pesach&rsquo; festival, what the Seder meal involves and meaning behind it</p>
<p>Passover is one the key festivals of the Jewish calendar, but many people&rsquo;s celebrations will be affected by the coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p>Passover commemorates God liberating Jews from slavery in ancient Egypt and Moses leading them to their freedom as a nation.</p>
<p>The festival&rsquo;s name comes from the belief that God &ldquo;passed over&rdquo; the Jewish homes when killing the Egyptian firstborns in the story of Exodus.</p>

<p>When is Passover?</p>
<p>In 2020, the festival of Passover starts on Wednesday 8 April and ends on Thursday 16 April.</p>
<p>It always lasts eight days from the 15th day of Nisan, the first month of the ecclesiastical year and the seventh month of the civil year in the Hebrew calendar.</p>
<p>This year Passover lasts from Wednesday 8 to Thursday 16 April (Photo: Getty)</p>
<p>Just like Easter in Christianity, the date of Passover changes from year to year in the more commonly-used Gregorian, solar calendar.</p>
<p>What’s the history behind Passover?</p>
<p>According to the Exodus the children of Israel had been slaves in Egypt for 210 years, and God promised that he would release them from slavery.</p>
<p>This would only come after the Egyptian Pharaoh had refused their release and God had released 10 plagues on Egypt to demonstrate his power.</p>
<p>Following the 10 plagues, the Pharaoh ordered Moses to immediately take his people out of Egypt.</p>
<p>The Israelites packed and left immediately without enough time for their bread rise – for this reason, unleavened matzah bread is eaten at Passover instead of risen or grain products.</p>

<p>Regretting his decision, the Pharaoh ordered his army to chase the Jews to the Red Sea, where they were trapped.</p>
<p>However, they were saved by a miracle. God told Moses to stretch his staff over the sea causing the waters to part and allowing the Jews to cross on dry land.</p>
<p>Just as the pursuing Egyptians entered the deep sea in pursuit, the waters closed and they all drowned.</p>
<p>The freed Israelites sang songs of praise to God in gratitude and then they started their journey in the desert.</p>
<p>What does the Seder involve?</p>
<p>The Torah commands people to observe Passover for seven days, which many worshippers in Israel follow, as well as Reform Jews and other progressive groups. However, more conservative and Orthodox Jews celebrate it for eight days.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the first night of Passover typically includes a ritual meal called the Seder – Hebrew for &ldquo;order&rdquo;, reflecting how the feast is served in an order set out in the Passover Haggadah, a Jewish instructional text.</p>
<p>During the gathering, worshippers recall the liberation of the Israelites in the Exodus, while also sharing a series of six symbolic dishes.</p>
<p>These include the bitter Maror herbs, which symbolise the harsh struggle of the Jews in slavery, and the roasted lamb or goat of the Zeroa, reflecting the Passover sacrifices traditionally offered at the Temple in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s Seder plans have been severely affected by the coronavirus outbreak, with measures put in place in the UK and across the globe to prevent people leaving their homes or gathering in large numbers.

YERUSHALAYIM -</p>
<p>Monday, April 6, 2020 at 5:41 pm |</p>

<p>Israel will go to a general lockdown for Pesach from 4 p.m. Tuesday until 7 a.m. Friday, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu told the nation.</p>
<p>Not only will intercity travel be banned, but people will be prohibited from leaving their homes on Wednesday night, Leil Haseder. The Cabinet was expected to vote approval of the measures later on Monday night.</p>
<p>While he said the country was moving in the right direction in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic, the prime minister cautioned that the next few days will determine Israel’s fate, “rise or recede, life or death.”</p>
<p>Netanyahu advised against relaxing social distancing, saying, “Pesach will not be Purim,” referring to the large gatherings on Purim that are believed to have spread the virus in the intervening days. At the time, there was no official restriction in place.</p>
<p>Holding out hope of an easing of restrictions, he said, “There is a realistic chance that if the trends continue, we’ll begin to gradually exit from the lockdown after Pesach. It depends on you.”</p>
<p>The number of coronavirus cases as of Monday night stood at 8,904, the Health Ministry said, up from 8,437 the night before. The death toll has reached 57, as eight more people succumbed to the COVID-19 in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>A total of 140 patients are in serious condition, including 107 on ventilators.
