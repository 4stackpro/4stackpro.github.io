<p>The Maharashtra Cyber department on Sunday night issued an advisory cautioning people against sharing pictures of deceased actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s body, warning of legal action.</p>
<p>Disturbing pictures of Rajput’s mortal remains surfaced on WhatsApp mere hours after his demise. Within a short while, they made their way onto WhatsApp groups and other platforms like Twitter.</p>
<p>Several social media users expressed shock and outrage at those sharing the pictures just to gain visibility online.</p>
<p>Late on Sunday, the Cyber department tweeted, “A disturbing trend has been observed on Social Media platforms by Maharashtra Cyber that pictures of deceased actor Shri. Sushant Singh Rajput are being circulated, which are disturbing and in bad taste. It is emphasised that circulation of such pictures is against legal guidelines and court directions, and are liable to invite legal action. Maharashtra Cyber exhorts and directs all netizens to refrain from circulating the aforesaid pictures. The pictures already circulated should be deleted henceforth. (sic)”</p>
<p>Officials said with a medium like WhatsApp, tracing the original source of the pictures would be next to impossible. They said all social media platforms are being watched so action can be taken against anyone found sharing the pictures.

Actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his Mumbai home.</p>
<p>Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his home in Mumbai, police said today, confirming his suicide. He was 34.</p>
<p>The popular actor was recently seen in the film &ldquo;Chhichhore&rdquo; - which dealt with the extreme pressure of college and competitive exams. His last appearance was in the Netflix film &ldquo;Drive&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput had put up a moving post just last week when his former manager Disha Salian was found dead. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s such devastating news,&rdquo; the actor had written on Instagram.</p>
<p>His last post on Instagram was dedicated to his mother, whose death in 2002 left him devastated. &ldquo;Blurred past evaporating from teardrops, unending dreams carving an arc of smile And a fleeting life, negotiating between the two,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>Rajput, who became a household name with his hit television series &ldquo;Pavitra Rishta&rdquo;, debuted in films in 2013 with the critically acclaimed &ldquo;Kai Po Che!&rdquo; based on Chetan Bhagat&rsquo;s bestselling book &ldquo;The Three Mistakes of My Life&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The movie catapulted Rajput into the big league and he went on to do several films. He also played MS Dhoni in the former skipper&rsquo;s biopic, for which he was nominated for film awards.</p>
<p>He played the eponymous role of Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! in the 2015 thriller. He had a supporting role in Aamir Khan&rsquo;s 2014 hit PK. In 2018, Rajput starred in Kedarnath opposite debutante Sara Ali Khan.</p>
<p>Rajput was born in Patna. He studied engineering and was a National Olympiad Winner in Physics.</p>
<p>He said in interviews that after his involvement in theatre and dance, he rarely had time for studies. He eventually dropped out of engineering just a year short of his degree to pursue an acting career.</p>
<p>A shell-shocked film industry posted tributes on Twitter. &ldquo;Honestly this news has left me shocked and speechless&hellip;I remember watching #SushantSinghRajput in Chhichhore and telling my friend Sajid, its producer how much I&rsquo;d enjoyed the film and wish I&rsquo;d been a part of it. Such a talented actor&hellip;may God give strength to his family,&rdquo; Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No No No!!!!! Horrible heartbreaking news of the passing of #SushantSinghRajput ! Shocking &amp; sad beyond words!!! Goodbye Sushant.. you were such a wonderful performer and had such a long long way to go! Don&rsquo;t know what you were going through but I&rsquo;m sorry for your suffering! Red heart (sic),&rdquo; Swara Bhaskar posted, condoling his death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The news of Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s death is truly sad. What a tragic loss Deepest condolences to his family &amp; loved ones. May his soul find eternal peace,&rdquo; actor Ajay Devgn wrote.</p>
<p>Abhishek Bachchan tweeted: &ldquo;This is just so shocking. A wonderful talent. RIP Sushant&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Last month, death of seasoned actors - Rishi Kapoor and Irrfan Khan - left the country in grief and shock.</p>

Sushant Singh Rajput Death: डेड बॉडी की तस्वीरें पोस्ट करने वाले लोगों पर भड़के स्टार्स, कहा- यह मनोरंजन नहीं</p>
<p>नई दिल्ली, जेएनएन। बॉलीवुड एक्टर सुशांत सिंह राजपूत ने रविवार को फांसी लगाकर आत्म हत्या कर ली है। सुशांत सिंह के निधन के बाद से सोशल मीडिया पर काफी लोग उनके प्रति दुख प्रकट कर रहे हैं और उनकी फिल्मों, पुरानी तस्वीरों और वीडियो के जरिए उन्हें याद कर रहे हैं। बॉलीवुड सेलेब्स, राजनीतिक, खेल से जुड़ी हस्तियों से लेकर आम जनता तक उन्हें याद कर रहे हैं। हालांकि, इसी बीच सोशल मीडिया पर उनके शव की तस्वीरें भी वायरल हो रही हैं और यूजर्स लगातार उनकी डेड बॉडी की तस्वीरें शेयर कर रहे हैं।</p>
<p>ऐसा कर रहे लोगों पर बॉलीवुड स्टार्स और कई अन्य यूजर्स ने गुस्सा व्यक्त किया है। सेलेब्स ने डेड बॉडी की तस्वीरें अपलोड कर रहे लोगों को खरी-खोटी सुनाई है और यूजर्स से अपील की है कि वो उन तस्वीरों को डिलीट कर दें। इतना ही ट्विटर पर एक #DELETE भी ट्रेंड कर रहा था, जिसमें लोग उन फोटो को डिलीट करने की अपील कर रहे हैं। इसी क्रम में फराह खान ने ट्वीट कर लिखा है- &lsquo;सुशांत सिंह राजपूत की यंग एज में मौत हो गई। उनके शव की तस्वीर वायरल करना बंद करें। यह एक दुर्घटना है मनोरंजन नहीं है। क्या हम इस दुनिया में रहते हैं ?&rsquo;</p>
<p>My friend #SushantSinghRajput has died tragically at a very young age!! STOP Circulating pictures of his death! This is a tragedy NOT entertainment!! Is this the world we live in now??! — Farah Khan (@TheFarahKhan) June 14, 2020</p>
<p>वहीं, एक्ट्रेस मीरा चोपड़ा ने भी डेड बॉडी की तस्वीरें शेयर करने पर गुस्सा जताया है। मीरा चोपड़ा ने ट्वीट कर लिखा है, &lsquo;कृपया सुशांत सिंह राजपूत के शव की तस्वीर वायरल करना बंद करें। यह काफी गंभीर है। बहुत से मीडिया हैंडल उनके शव की तस्वीर का इस्तेमाल कर रहे हैं। कृपया उन्हें डिलीट कर दें&rsquo;।</p>
<p>Plz stop putting the images of the dead body. Its highly insensitive. Lot of media handles doing it. Plz plz delete them. 🙏🙏🙏 — meera chopra (@MeerraChopra) June 14, 2020</p>
<p>स्टार्स के अलावा कई यूजर्स भी शव की तस्वीरें शेयर करने को गलत बता रहे हैं। बता दें कि सोशल मीडिया पर सुशांत सिंह की कुछ तस्वीरें वायरल हो रही हैं और दावा किया जा रहा है कि वो उनके फांसी लगाने के बाद की है। इन तस्वीरों में सुशांत ने काले रंग की टीशर्ट पहन रखी है।</p>

<p><img src="https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/715_-/2020/06/sushmita-1592184964.jpg" alt="img">
The country was left in shock after the news of actor Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s suicide started doing rounds. The 34-year-old Bollywood actor was found hanging at his Bandra residence on June 14. When there was no response after repeated knocks, his domestic help called the neighbours after which police arrived shortly and broke into his room where he was found hanging around 12.30 pm. It came to light that he was suffering from depression and was even getting treatment from Hinduja hospital for the last six months. After the untimely death of the stay, various celebrities were left in shock and had only one question as to why he took the drastic step. One amongst those was actress Sushmita Sen who took to her social media to share a long post and spoke about how it is important to stay positive in life because a person is only responsible for his own happiness. She even spoke about how insecurities can grow in the life of a celebrity with name and sometimes, bank balance.</p>
<p>Sushmita shared a photo that read, &lsquo;protect your peace.&rsquo; Alongside she wrote the long post reading, &ldquo;Look good, show good&hellip;be good..ALL THE TIME!! Projection becomes one’s life, both on &amp; off screen. Insecurities grow with name &amp; sometimes, bank balance. All these may be known triggers in an actors life&hellip;but it’s actually true about a lot of us from all different walks of life&hellip;only differing in magnitude &amp; visibility!! Young people with so much life &amp; promise ahead of them, some with great depth &amp; will power&hellip;can choose to take their own life is deeply disturbing. How do we say, we know people &amp; still not see it coming? Have we become experts at hiding our pain or does no one have the time to really SEE it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further, she said, &ldquo;How lonely &amp; hopeless can prolonged silence make you? Do we alienate a life by judging it constantly? In the race of the projection of “look good, show good, be good” have we lost the most important ability to FEEL GOOD? Life has its share of pressures for EVERYONE&hellip;no one is excused that, no matter what your standing!! Life is a graph with its ups &amp; downs for EVERYONE, even if we can’t always see it. Yet, FIGHT FOR LIFE WE MUST&hellip;it’s the only vehicle that will help lead us from bad times to GOOD ONES again!!! “WHEN YOU’RE TIRED&hellip; LEARN TO REST, NOT QUIT.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She also wrote about how building a life takes a lot of faith and courage while taking one&rsquo;s life just needs a moment of madness. She said, &ldquo;We can’t change the world, but we can choose self preservation over the noise, chaos, demands, insensitive scrutinisation &amp; conditioned insecurities&hellip;.by befriending ourselves, being around people who really LISTEN, having faith in God’s unique plan JUST FOR YOU!!! Be unafraid to ask for help &amp; know that you are NOT ALONE. Building a life demands a lot of faith, courage, resilience &amp; hard work&hellip;whereas taking your life just needs a MOMENT of madness&hellip;choose to distract yourself from THAT moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the professional front, Sushmita will be making her &lsquo;incredible&rsquo; comeback through her upcoming web series &lsquo;Aarya&rsquo; in which she will be seen playing the role of a mother who is willing to go to any length to protect her children. The show also features Namit Das, Sikandar Kher, Jayant Kripalani, Sohaila Kapoor, Sugandha Garg, Maya Sareen, Vishwajeet Pradhan and Manish Chaudhary. It is directed by Ram Madhwani, is scheduled to hit Disney+ Hotstar VIP on the 19th of June 2020.</p>
