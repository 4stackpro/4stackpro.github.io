等了兩年，美劇《Westworld》（西部世界）第三季終於上映，是ＨＢＯ一部史詩級製作，被觀眾封為神劇。此劇由Jonathan Nolan和他妻子共同創作及監製，劇情鋪排精密，大玩時間綫及設有大量轉折位，真是少一點腦汁都看不明白！故事設定在未來有一個名為「西部世界」的西部主題樂園，園裏有着如人類一模一樣的機械人，能讓遊客盡情釋放自身對情慾、暴力等等的慾望。</p>
<p>「西部世界」裏的機械人稱為「接待員」（Host），它們不論是外觀、談吐、行為等都與常人無異，每天根據程式預設的劇本和故事「生活」，在園裏接待遊客（Guest）。劇情由第一季主角們的覺醒過程、擺脫控制和改變命運，到第二季的革命、對人類報復和逃離樂園都非常精采。</p>
<p>劇中的「接待員」亦是人類的寫照，啟發思考及探討哲學問題，例如人類對自我意識的認知、人類是否真的擁有自由意志，而不是像Host一樣，過着宿命論般的劇本和故事生活，我們怎樣證實自己不是活在一個如「西部世界」的模擬世界等。</p>
<p>第三季有神劇《Breaking Bad》的Aaron Paul加盟，加上故事伸展到人類世界，勢必令此劇再提升一個層次。</p>

<h3 id="westworld-star-evan-rachel-wood-on-the-digital-war-at-the-heart-of-season-3">‘Westworld’ Star Evan Rachel Wood on the ‘Digital War’ at the Heart of Season 3</h3>
<p><img src="https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/westworld-1.jpg?w=700&amp;h=393&amp;crop=1" alt="img">
Netflix, but everywhere, and evil: That’s the chilling idea at the center of the third season of “Westworld.”</p>
<p>As star Evan Rachel Wood explained during a live interview on the “Variety After-Show” — streamed via Variety‘s Instagram account after the third episode of “Westworld” aired on HBO — her sentient robot character Dolores now knows what she’s up against as she’s continued her bold exploration of the real world outside of the park: A massive artificial intelligence called Rehoboam that controls just about everything.</p>
<p>“When you sign onto Netflix, it’s says, ‘Oh, you watched this show, you’ll probably like this show and this show,’ and then you start watching those shows,” Wood said. “But then after a while, you go, well, do I really like these shows, or am I just watching them because the algorithm told me that I would like them? Imagine that, but it runs the entire world.”</p>
<p>In Episode 3, “The Absence of Field,” Dolores explains the machinations of Rehoboam to Jacob (Aaron Paul), a human construction worker who rescued an injured Dolores at the end of Episode 1. Dolores explains to Jacob that Rehoboam has already mapped out his entire life including his (apparently) eventual suicide, so it blocked his efforts to rise to a higher station.</p>
<p>“Imagine this digital trail that we all leave: Emails, phone calls, everything you like, everything you dislike, everything you retweet, everything you search on Google, the people that you speak to — imagine if all that was compiled,” Wood said. “Imagine if they just took all of that data and they just put it into a big machine, and could determine what your next move was going to be, or what choices you were probably going to make, and in the future they were able to do that to the point where they could determine how you were going to die and how you were going to live your life. The system could then determine who they want to invest in, and who they don’t want to invest in.”</p>
<p>Wood said that working on “Westworld” “has really opened my eyes to so much” to the ways current technology could unfold in a direction similar to the cruel dystopia depicted on the show.</p>
<p>“We’re sort of already living in that kind of world, this is just a deeper look into what happens when all the data collecting goes unchecked and it becomes this digital war that we’re already in,” Wood said.</p>
<p>With so much of the show now confronting questions more directly connected to the real world, Wood said she was sad to leave the Wild West setting of the first two seasons of the show.</p>
<p>“I miss the dirt,” she said. “I miss the horses.”</p>
<p>But when one fan on Instagram asked during the Q&amp;A portion of the “After-Show” if Season of 3 of “Westworld” would visit any more new areas of the park, Wood couldn’t help but offer one of the show’s trademark cryptic teases.</p>
<p>“I mean,” she said with a smile, “we don’t know that we aren’t seeing one right now.”

<h3 id="watching-westworld-season-3-while-quarantined">Watching Westworld Season 3 While Quarantined</h3>
<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/westworld-episode-three-1585237175.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">
I know a lot of people are turned off by Westworld&rsquo;s big swings and occasional misses, but I&rsquo;ve never really been one of them. As a fan of pretty much everything peripherally science fiction-related, I appreciate Westworld&rsquo;s cerebral approach to a show that could have simply been a sexy killer robots story. Yes, it&rsquo;s structurally and theoretically confusing, and yes, it&rsquo;s Very Serious—but it&rsquo;s nice to see a TV show taking big budget risks the way Westworld does. Plus, when it does get things right, the series delves into existential questions of human consciousness, identity, and our singularity with technology more effectively than any other TV show. Prestige science fiction shows like Westworld and FX&rsquo;s Devs are willing to go places that most networks (and movie studios) are afraid to go. Television needs more of it.</p>
<p>Heading into Season Three, I was ready and willing to give Westworld another round after the mind-bending, time-twisting, body-hopping Season Two finale. I&rsquo;d done my homework. I was mentally prepared to put in the effort for another high-budget chapter in a sci-fi series that can often be deeply rewarding.</p>
<p>But, to no fault of Westworld&rsquo;s (or HBO&rsquo;s or creators Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy&rsquo;s), I simply can&rsquo;t do it right now. I do not have the mental fortitude for Westworld&rsquo;s bullshit at this time.</p>
<p>Of course, I gave it a chance. The first episode was surprisingly fun. There was a crime app, Aaron Paul, near-future super-spy Dolores, and an evil corporate artificial intelligence that could be dictating the actions of humanity as a whole. Episode Two brought us back into the Delos parks with Bernard reprogramming human-revealed-to-be-robot Ashley Stubbs, and Maeve waking up in a WWII-era park only to realize that her consciousness (brain orb?) is actually being housed in a simulated loop located in the real world at some tech millionaire&rsquo;s personal data-farm.</p>
<p>Yet, with all that&rsquo;s going on in the world right now, I&rsquo;ve left these episodes feeling deflated, and drained. I do not feel intellectually stimulated, and certainly not entertained. It&rsquo;s become hard to meet Westworld half way—to put in the work of following along and investing the mental energy when our minds are consumed with other anxieties. As Americans began to brace for the onslaught of Coronavirus on March 15, Westworld&rsquo;s Season Three premiered to disappointing ratings. As Variety reported:</p>
<p>The season 3 premiere drew 901,000 total viewers to the live broadcast on HBO, which represents a 57% dip from last season’s premiere (which drew 2.1 million) and the show’s lowest viewership tally to date. Overall, the episode scored 1.7 million viewers across HBO’s platforms when taking into account digital viewers. That means its viewership was split almost 50-50 between live and streaming, a much more even balance than previous seasons which skewed far more towards live. For comparison, the last episode of “Westworld,” which aired way back in June 2018, scored 1.6 million total viewers.</p>
<p>Although industry publications like Deadline and Variety predicted that Americans would be watching more television while stuck in self-isolation, that hasn&rsquo;t helped the Westworld numbers reported so far. It certainly appears that, with little else to do but watch TV, people have not been choosing Westworld at the same rate they did in previous seasons. Of course, there are other factors at play here—it&rsquo;s entirely possible that Westworld&rsquo;s polarizing second season and the nearly two-year break turned viewers off, too.</p>
<p>Westworld feels like watching a techno apocalypse take place in slow motion.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also true that Westworld is just too much right now, at least for me. It&rsquo;s interesting to see how viewing habits have changed as millions of Americans social distance. Many of us here at Esquire have gravitated to classics that give us the comfort of a bygone era. Others have escaped into the absurdity of Tiger King. Live broadcast TV has seen a bump in its game shows and the brain candy that is The Voice.</p>
<p>Instead of watching Westworld, I&rsquo;ve been binging old episodes of Chopped and indulging in the simple pleasures of island life on the new &ldquo;Animal Crossing&rdquo;—both different forms of comforting entertainment.</p>
<p>But I also haven&rsquo;t turned away from science fiction entirely. I&rsquo;ve been reading Ted Chiang&rsquo;s Exhalation, which is a collection of sci-fi short stories that delve into time travel, simulated realities, alien worlds, and the nature of our reality. In a lot of ways, it examines a number of the same themes that Westworld does. It has made me wonder why I find one so engaging and escapist and the other such a chore.</p>
<p>Amazon Exhalation: Stories Ted Chiang amazon.com $25.95 $18.29 (30% off) Buy</p>
<p>Part of it is the tone. Many of Chiang&rsquo;s stories are hopeful, sweet, and position technology as something that needs to be examined. Not as good or evil but as a tool in our evolution as humans that needs to be fully understood. Humans are not the villains in his stories, and neither is technology. The antagonist is our struggle to fully comprehend the ways in which it can challenge our understanding of the universe.</p>
<p>Westworld on the other hand exists in a near-future technological dystopia. It&rsquo;s set in a world where humans have already failed—they&rsquo;ve mistreated technology to the point where it&rsquo;s rebelling against them. The faults of humans have already doomed them. Westworld feels like watching a techno apocalypse take place in slow motion. The weirdest part is consuming this type of content when the bulk of our human communication is computer-mediated. Aside from my partner, the only other human faces I see are on a screen. It&rsquo;s hard to watch a show in which technology, or our misuse of it, is the enemy, when it&rsquo;s the only thing currently connecting me to other flesh and blood humans.</p>
<p>Once this passes, and we&rsquo;re going outside again, interacting with real humans again, and when my computer or phone is my link to the world only most of the time instead of all of the time—maybe then I&rsquo;ll be able to enjoy a world in which the devices surrounding us can also kill us.
