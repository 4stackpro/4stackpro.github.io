Steve Carrel joined John Krasinski on his new series (via YouTube)</p>
<p>The American version of The Office celebrated its 15th anniversary and John Kransinski, who played Jim, celebrated by having a video call with Steve Carrell, who played the iconic boss Michael Scott.</p>
<p>John Kransinski has set up a new YouTube channel, entitled Some Good News, dedicated to spreading good news during this current climate.</p>
<p>The Quiet Place star and director opened the first video on his new channel by saying, &ldquo;Why is there not a news show dedicated to good news?&rdquo; and reached out to his followers on Twitter to send him some good news stories. This inspired him to start up this new show with the content that people had been sending into him, which included praising the healthcare workers, sharing videos of acts of kindness done by strangers and even sharing a photo from Ireland of a grandfather meeting his grandson through a window.</p>
<p>Just under halfway through his episode he acknowledged a very special date for him. Holding up a framed photo of him as The Office character Jim Halpert, he told his viewers that the popular show was celebrating its 15th anniversary.</p>
<p>He then brought his former co-star Steve Carell into the conversation through video call to have a discussion about the show and their fond memories of working together.</p>
<p>Their chat starts below at around the 5.55 mark.</p>
<p>The two began by talking about the show they starred in together, &ldquo;So this week marked a huge anniversary for you and I. We were on a little show called The Office&rdquo; and Steve added how people are still enjoying it today, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a happy surprise that people are still tuning in and finding it even. It&rsquo;s pretty cool&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two then go on to discuss some of their favourite and funniest scenes of The Office, and had clips from the show playing during their conversation.</p>
<p>They ended the conversation by recalling how emotional they were when filming their final scenes together.</p>
<p>John and Steve played Jim and Michael in the hit TV show (via NBC)</p>
<p>The US Office was the American adaptation of the original BBC comedy created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant.</p>
<p>Although many American remakes of British comedies usually do not do well once aired, The Office became extremely popular with viewers and ran for nine seasons.

<h3 id="john-krasinski-steve-carell-discuss-favorite-the-office-memories">John Krasinski, Steve Carell Discuss Favorite ‘The Office’ Memories</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sgn2.png" alt="img">
&ldquo;The Office&rdquo; stars discussed their favorite memories of the classic sitcom and the possibility of a reunion in a new interview.</p>
<p>There needs to be more good news on the internet. Thankfully, John Krasinski has the cure: “The Office” star and “A Quiet Place” director has started a new YouTube series to share all manner of uplifting stories, and the first episode included an interview with Steve Carell to celebrate the 15th anniversary of “The Office.”</p>
<p>“Some Good News” offered plenty of heartwarming clips about individuals performing acts of kindness, but the 15-minute video also included a mini “The Office” reunion, where Krasinski and Carell video chatted about their favorite memories from the classic sitcom. Carell’s personal “The Office” highlights included every bit about his character’s diminutive plasma screen television, while Krasinski reminisced about Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) sitting in Carell’s hapless character’s lap during a Christmas episode.</p>
<p>Carell, who recently returned to television acting on Apple TV+’s “The Morning Show” last year, spoke fondly of the “The Office” cast’s comradery — such as bonding while filming the “Fun Run” episodes in 105 degree weather. Carell also noted that Krasinski was a particularly talented impressionist, citing “The Office” episode where Krasinski pretended to be Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson).</p>

<p>“When you came in as Dwight that day, it was crazy watching Jim to Dwight,” Carell said. “You’re a very good impressionist in general. I don’t think people know that.”</p>

<p>While “The Office” made Carell and Krasinski giants in the entertainment industry, Krasinski noted that he never expected the show to become such a huge success.</p>
<p>“I was a waiter when I got that job,” Krasinski said. “I was 23-years-old and after the pilot I went back to waiting tables because I was sure nothing was gonna happen with it. We all came into it with that vibe. I remember that none of us had done anything huge.”</p>
<p>Though the duo also briefly discussed the possibility of a series reunion, Krasinski said if such a thing were to happen, he’d prefer to do it out of character.</p>
<p>“I know everybody is talking about a reunion,” Krasinski said. “Hopefully one day we get to reunite as people and just all get to say hi.”</p>
<p>The episode, which was uploaded Sunday, has already garnered around 5 million views and though Krasinski’s interview with Carell drew plenty of attention on social media, most of the episode was focused on sharing heartwarming stories about individuals performing acts of kindness. Krasinski kicked off the episode by praising the heroism of the global healthcare community and showing clips of various acts of kindness, such as entire city blocks cheering for hospital staffs and a delivery driver being gifted toilet paper and hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>Krasinski closed the episode by interviewing Coco, a 15-year-old girl in California who recently completed her final chemotherapy treatment. A video of Coco returning home to an uproarious “surprise social distancing welcome home parade” went viral several days ago when Coco’s mother tweeted the video at Krasinski.</p>
<p>“You are my newest and biggest hero,” Krasinski said during his interview with Coco.</p>

<h3 id="steve-carell-didnt-want-to-leave-the-office-a-new-book-says">Steve Carell didn’t want to leave ‘The Office,’ a new book says</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/in-Sq6pEqMwxuK2yJIGGXSXxYrc=/0x43:600x357/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/17144940/700342402.jpg" alt="img">
Steve Carell had a gracious exit from “The Office” after season seven, leaving the show on his own terms in a beautiful final episode. But a new book alleges that Carell didn’t want to leave the show and that NBC forced him out.</p>
<p>What’s going on:</p>
<p>A new book called “The Office: The Untold Story of the Greatest Sitcom of the 2000s,” by Andy Greene, explains why Carell left the show. According to Collider, Carell’s exit had more to do with the NBC network than Carell’s own decision.</p>
<p>Carell told BBC News in April 2010 that season seven would “probably be my last year.” But sound mixer Brian Wittle told Greene for the book that Carell didn’t want to leave. NBC made decisions that sort of forced Carell’s hand.</p>
<p>The text reads (via Collider):</p>
<p>“I sat with him one time and he told me the story. He was doing a radio interview and he haphazardly mentioned, almost unconsciously, that it might be his last season. He didn’t plan on saying it out loud and he hadn’t decided anything. He was kind of thinking out loud, but he did it in an interview in public and it created news. Then what he said was the people connected to the show had no reaction to it. They didn’t call and say, ‘What? You wanna leave?’ He said he didn’t get any kind of response from them. When he realized he didn’t get any kind of response from them, he thought, ‘Oh, maybe they don’t really care if I leave. Maybe I should go do other things.’ So I think that made it easier, because when the news broke that he was considering it, the people that are in charge of keeping him there didn’t make a big effort to do so until afterward.”</p>
<p>Hairstylist Kim Ferry agreed with the claim, saying NBC didn’t pick up Carell’s contract:</p>
<p>“He didn’t want to leave the show. He had told the network that he was going to sign for another couple of years. He was willing to and his agent was willing to. But for some reason, they didn’t contact him. I don’t know if it was a game of chicken or what… He planned on staying on the show. He told his manager and his manager contacted them and said he’s willing to sign another contract for a couple years. So all of that was willing and ready and, on their side, honest. And the deadline came for when they were supposed to give him an offer and it passed and they didn’t make him an offer. So his agent was like, ‘Well, I guess they don’t want to renew you for some reason.’ Which was insane to me. And to him, I think.”</p>
