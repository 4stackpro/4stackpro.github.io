From FaceTime to Houseparty, there is no shortage of platforms for work and play as you shelter in place</p>
<p>With offices and schools around the world temporarily shut amid the coronavirus crisis, the video platform Zoom has seen overnight success. But growing concerns over security across the platform have many consumers wondering about tech alternatives.</p>
<p>Privacy-minded consumers should consider video chat options carefully, said Arvind Narayanan, an associate computer science professor at Princeton University who has been outspoken about the security concerns surrounding Zoom.</p>
<p>“There is a tradeoff between security and usability when picking a video conferencing product,” he said. “Companies and schools should consider supporting multiple software options, configuring them securely, and educating their users about the risks.”</p>
<p>Among the most important criteria for evaluating a video conferencing platform is end-to-end encryption of calls and data protection policies, said Charles Ragland, security engineer at Digital Shadows, a San Francisco-based security provider. Companies should be in compliance with privacy frameworks like Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation or California’s Consumer Privacy Act, he continued, and should also tell users what data is being collected and what third parties can access that data.</p>
<p>Here are some of your videoconferencing options for staying connected while sheltering in place:</p>
<p>Zoom</p>
<p>The app is headquartered in San Jose, California, and was valued at $16bn when it went public in 2019. It quickly became the most popular option for meetings and other events moving online following shelter-in-place orders this year.</p>
<p>Pros: It’s seamless to use – attendees can join by a publicly shared link from anywhere, and joining does not require downloading any software. It’s a great option if you are not discussing anything private or secure – a virtual happy hour with friends, for example. The company has promised to fix issues with privacy and security, recently making default options more secure by requiring passwords to join meetings.</p>
<p>Cons: Zoom has had some glaring problems privacy and security. “Zoom bombings”, in which hackers enter chat rooms to drop racist language and violent threats, persist. The company had to fix a bug that would have allowed hackers to take over a Zoom user’s Mac. It also had to change some of its policies after a Motherboard report found Zoom sends data from users of its iOS app to Facebook for advertising purposes.</p>

<p>The company also claimed its calls were encrypted, and then backtracked when it was proven wrong by a report in the Intercept. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado has requested responses from Zoom CEO Eric Yuan on privacy concerns and the FTC is being called to investigate the company.</p>
<p>Skype</p>
<p>Released in 2003, Skype is one of the longest-standing options for video chatting. It was bought by Microsoft in 2011 and is a free option for one-on-one or group video chats.</p>
<p>Pros: Skype is free, easy to use and widely known.</p>
<p>Cons: The maximum number of people who can join a Skype meeting is 50, making it a difficult option for larger organizations or big get-togethers.</p>
<p>Microsoft Teams</p>
<p>Schools in New York are transitioning from Zoom to Microsoft Teams, a work-from-home collaboration platform. The app has been gaining traction: Teams saw its daily active user count rise more than 37% during just one week last month, from 32 million to 44 million around the world.</p>
<p>Pros: The video platform allows for 250 people in a meeting or up to 10,000 viewers through its presentation feature. Users can easily share files and chat during meetings as well as screen-share. It is free and integrates with Skype.</p>
<p>Cons: The platform is built primarily for businesses, or “teams”. People who want individual access can do so via Skype accounts, but it appears to require a download of Skype to join meetings – unlike Zoom, which lets users attend meetings through their web browsers.</p>
<p>FaceTime</p>
<p>The built-in video call option for Apple products is an often overlooked option for group video chats, but a strong one for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>Pros: Apple is known for its strong encryption practices, meaning the company cannot see what you share during a call. FaceTime is also free for Apple users and does not require the download of an app.</p>
<p>Cons: FaceTime is only available for users who have Apple devices, has a maximum of 32 users per call, and does not allow people to join by link, making it hard to spread the word about your online event in advance.</p>

<p>Signal</p>
<p>Signal is an encrypted messaging app widely considered to be the world’s most secure – and it is increasingly going mainstream. It allows for large group chats, but not group video calls.</p>
<p>Pros: It’s encrypted and free to download.</p>
<p>Cons: Signal does not allow for group video chats, but it is useful for one-on-one video chats that require strong security and encryption.</p>
<p>Starleaf</p>
<p>The Cambridge, England-based video conferencing provider Starleaf was founded in 2008 and has grown in popularity as it pitches itself as a more secure video conferencing alternative to Zoom. Call volume on StarLeaf has grown more than 1,000% compared to February 2020, the company said by email.</p>
<p>Pros: Starleaf is based in the UK and subject to local data privacy laws there. It also allows the consumer to choose where their user data is stored. It is used by NHS trusts in the UK.</p>
<p>Cons: Rather than the individual consumer, it targets organizations with 500+ employees – a good option for your company but maybe not for happy hour with your friends. Starleaf only hosts up to 20 people per meeting and has a maximum of 46 minutes per meeting.</p>
<p>Jitsi Meet</p>
<p>This video conferencing platform was founded in 2003 by a student in France, and it has gained popularity as a more secure alternative to Zoom.</p>
<p>Pros: Jitsi Meet is free; open-source, meaning outside parties can check its security; and encrypted.</p>
<p>Cons: It allows a maximum of 75 participants in a chat (and a “better experience” with 35 or fewer).</p>
<p>Houseparty</p>
<p>A series of now debunked reports claimed Houseparty had been breached – rumors the company is now claiming were part of a “paid commercial smear” by a rival.</p>
<p>Pros: This is perhaps the most fun video conferencing app, with a number of games within the app, including trivia and drawing challenges.</p>
<p>Cons: It appears that when you start a “house party”, anyone in your contacts can join, but it is possible to “lock” a room once the people you want to be there are in it. It also has questionable privacy policies and collects a “worrying amount” of information, according to one security researcher.</p>
<p>Google Hangouts</p>
<p>For those of us who use Gmail, Google Hangouts is a seamless option for video chats. Up to 150 people can participate in a chat, but only 25 people can participate in a video call at once.</p>
<p>Pros: It’s free and accessible.</p>
<p>Cons: Use it with the knowledge that Google will have even more of your data than it already does. A hangout can be joined via Gmail, the Hangouts app, or a Chrome extension but it requires a Gmail account.</p>
<p>BlueJeans</p>
<p>The California-based video conference platform BlueJeans is a good option for work teams and meetings that require a little more security than a free Zoom session.</p>
<p>Pros: Videos are encrypted by default. BlueJeans can be accessed via browser and does not require an account or the download of a new program.</p>
<p>Cons: It is not free – BlueJeans costs $9.99 for a basic plan that allows meetings up to 50 people and $13.99 for its “pro” product, which allows up to 75 people per meeting, among other features.

<h3 id="zoom-ceo-apologizes-for-security-problems-on-public-live-stream">Zoom CEO apologizes for security problems on public live stream</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HLi67ssASGoG3Zr0t9azPsXL8fE=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19861743/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0002.0.jpg" alt="img">
On a live YouTube stream on Wednesday, Zoom CEO Eric Yuan apologized to users for a string of security lapses that have rocked the app in recent weeks. Speaking to viewers for more than two hours, Yuan touted the company’s recent privacy updates and pledged to take any lapses seriously.</p>
<p>“Clearly we have a lot of work to do to ensure the security of all these new consumer use cases,” Yuan said on the call. “But what I can promise you is that we take these issues very, very seriously. We’re looking into each and every one of them. If we find an issue, we’ll acknowledge it and we’ll fix it.”</p>
<p>“Clearly we have a lot of work to do”</p>
<p>The live chat comes on the heels of similar interviews with CNN and The Wall Street Journal, as Zoom scrambles to adapt to its new consumer audience. As part of that new focus, Zoom has also instituted a 90-day freeze on planned features, allowing staff to work solely on addressing concerns with its current product. Earlier this week, the company rolled out a series of changes intended to prevent “zoombombing” and other harassment on the service.</p>
<p>Yuan also specifically addressed a Citizen Lab report published last week, which showed encryption keys being processed through a server in China even when all of the meeting participants were outside the country. According to Yuan, the communication happened as a result of client applications attempting to contact a timing server, but he said it happened in a vanishingly small percentage of cases. Still, the mere possibility of such a communication could open the door for bad actors, making it a significant vulnerability for the service.</p>
<p>“To be clear, this should never have happened,” Yuan said, “and the issue was completely addressed last Friday.”</p>
<p>Zoom is also bringing in help to manage its new security and privacy challenges. This morning, former Facebook security chief Alex Stamos announced he would be collaborating with the company on its security work, although he will not be an employee or an executive with Zoom.</p>
<p>“In a time of global crisis, Zoom has become a critical link between co-workers, families, friends and, most importantly, between teachers and students,” Stamos said in a Medium post. “[That] has created privacy, trust and safety challenges that no company has ever faced.”</p>
<p>Zoom is also facing new levels of scrutiny from US lawmakers and regulators. In a letter to the Federal Trade Commission earlier today, Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) called on the agency to issue “comprehensive guidelines for companies that provide online conferencing services, as well as best practices for users that will help protect online safety and privacy during this pandemic and beyond.” Such guidance would affect not only Zoom but competitors like Skype and Google Hangouts, opening the door for new regulatory action in the space.

<h3 id="security-issues-surrounding-zoom-not-serious-says-ceo">Security issues surrounding Zoom not serious, says CEO</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets.nst.com.my/images/articles/Copy_Of_08zoombaba17_NSTfield_image_socialmedia.var_1586404854.jpg" alt="img">
KUALA LUMPUR: The security issues that surrounded the Zoom video conferencing platform for the past week are not deemed serious and have been addressed accordingly by the company.</p>
<p>The issues were acknowledged by Zoom’s CEO, Eric Yuan, in the company’s blog (blog.zoom.us), and the US-based company has since been taking all the necessary measures to overcome them.</p>
<p>Earlier, it was reported that some loopholes in the video-conferencing platform had allowed people/hackers to join a video meeting uninvited and potentially access files or information shared during the meeting, which had caused worries among users.</p>
<p>“On March 20, we published a blog post to help users address incidents of harassment or so-called ‘Zoombombing’ on our platform by clarifying the protective features that can help prevent this, such as waiting rooms, passwords, muting controls, and limiting screen sharing,” he said.</p>
<p>Yuan, said the company had “fallen short” of necessary standards and ill-prepared to deal with the sudden influx in users due to the Covid-19 pandemic that has forced millions of people to work from home.</p>
<p>“Usage of Zoom has ballooned overnight, far surpassing what we expected when we first announced our desire to help in late February,” he added.</p>
<p>As of the end of December last year, the maximum number of daily meeting participants, both free and paid, conducted on Zoom was approximately 10 million.</p>
<p>However, in March this year, the company reached more than 200 million daily meeting participants, both free and paid.</p>
<p>This has also resulted in an increase in “Zoom” domain name registrations since people started self-quarantining to combat the coronavirus.</p>
<p>According to Internet security company Sophos, while the issues that have been uncovered in Zoom over the recent couple of weeks are serious, they shouldn’t have much impact users at home, especially if they keep their Zoom software up to date.</p>
<p>“Most the of the concerns have been addressed and the remaining questions about how Zoom uses encryption are not likely to impact users who are not doing highly confidential work,” said the company’s principal research scientist, Chester Wisniewski.</p>
<p>“We are not aware of much criminal activity on Zoom. Most of what is being done has been named ‘Zoom Bombing’ and is more of a prank than a criminal act for profit,” he said.</p>
<p>Aside from posting offensive content, there have been reports of people joining open Zoom meetings and sharing malicious files and web links.</p>
<p>“This is where the largest risk lies. Users should change their Zoom settings to avoid unauthorised people from joining their meetings, and not downloading or clicking links from unverified parties,” he said.</p>
<p>Wisniewski said people are also registering many domain names that contain the word Zoom in them.</p>
<p>“For example the real Zoom website is Zoom.us, but people have registered things like ZoomMeetings.com and Z00M.com with zero’s instead of the letter O. Not all of these are malicious, some are things like tips or training courses, but considering the increase in volume of these registrations, many of them will likely be used for fraud and scams,” he said, hence users need to be extra careful when choosing the platform.</p>
<p>Commenting on the safety measures users can take when using the Zoom platform, Wisniewski said: “Try to make a space and treat it as if you were actually in an office.”</p>
<p>“Disconnect the Google Home or Amazon Echo device so it can’t pick up confidential conversations, don’t surf websites you wouldn’t want to be seen surfing at work and be, especially wary, of unsolicited links or attachments, whether in Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Slack, WhatsApp or Facebook messenger,” he said.</p>
<p>“Criminals are trying to take advantage of our most popular work from home tools to make a quick dollar and staying vigilant will help us deny them the opportunity,” he added.</p>
<p>“Zoom is largely safe and it is no more unsafe than most of their competitors,” he concluded.</p>
<p>Sophos has also published security steps on tightening up users’ security and privacy while using Zoom.</p>
