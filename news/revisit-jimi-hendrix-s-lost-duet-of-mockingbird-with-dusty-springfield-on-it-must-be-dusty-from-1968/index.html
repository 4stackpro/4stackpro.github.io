<p>Thanks to some unique insight into reusing old tape to film with, many of Jimi Hendrix’s greatest moments on British television seem to be lost. Perhaps one of the most notable moments is when Hendrix appeared on Dusty Springfield’s show, on this day in 1968.</p>
<p>It Must Be Dusty was filmed for ITV and welcomed Hendrix and The Experience to the show on June 5th, 1968 for a very special performance. While much of the video documentation of the event has been lost to frugal producers, a warped clip of Hendrix and his host singing ‘Mockingbird’ has survived.</p>
<p>The footage, it has to be said, is not up to a great standard. The film comes from a Super 8 camera pointed directly at the original transmission and is therefore patchy at best. But thankfully, the audio of the entire show has been preserved and is now available to take a look at below.</p>
<p>As well as performing the somewhat novelty track ‘Mockingbird’, Hendrix and The Experience were also ready to start a few fires. “This is dedicated to Brian Jones,” begins Hendrix before launching into ‘Stone Free’ and Hendrix’s imposing vocal which rallies until relenting to let his guitar do the talking.</p>
<p>Then comes a comfortable chat, “Hey, whatcha been doing Jim?” says Springfield before the equally warm and friendly duet of ‘Mockingbird’ is brought out. Soon enough, the band once again take over and perform ‘Voodoo Child’ for the baying audience at home.</p>
<p>In 1968, many more Britons held Hendrix dear to their heart than in his native America and you can hear from the audience’s responses. It’s clear that Hendrix had won over Britain a long time ago and was now as big a star as anyone. Sadly, Hendrix would never get to reach his full potential and died just over two years later.</p>
<p>We can at least take some solace in the fact we have clips, however murky they may be, like this to remember when Jimi Hendrix was on top of the world. Below you can find the footage of Hendrix and Dusty performing and below that an audiotape of the entire performance.

<p>In 2008 Duffy was a bigger star than Adele: a modern, Welsh valleys version of Dusty Springfield, with a beehive-haired glamour reminiscent of Brigitte Bardot and songs that were equal parts tear-jerking, baroque balladry and upbeat soul stomp. A first album that year, Rockferry, sold 6.5 million copies. A second album in 2010, Endlessly, bombed. Then she disappeared.</p>
<p>Only in February this year did we learn that Duffy had, according to a now-deleted post on her Instagram account, been “raped and drugged and held hostage over some days”. She later elaborated that she had been taken to a foreign country, been held captive for four weeks, and spent the next ten years as a virtual recluse, having split from her

<h3 id="drag-legend-lady-bunny-on-miniskirts-politics-and-finding-humor-in-lockdown">&ldquo;Drag Legend Lady Bunny on Miniskirts, Politics, and Finding Humor in Lockdown&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5eea8b1029b8fa57f1c92fd4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-1029619296.jpg" alt="img">
Where many might instinctively balk at the idea of finding humor in a global health crisis, it’s easy to forget that for the queer community, this isn’t their first time facing the tragedy of a pandemic and using humor as a coping mechanism to find moments of uplift. Merely weeks ago, the New York Times published a front page that lit up social media with its moving insights into the 100,000 Americans who have died thus far of the COVID-19 virus. But others took the opportunity to offer a stark reminder of the disinterest with which the AIDS crisis was covered—at the point of its 100,000 death toll within the U.S., in 1991, it was memorialized on page 18 of the Times, with no pictures, no names, and no true acknowledgement of the tragic consequences of this grim milestone.</p>
<p>“It’s awful,” Bunny adds. “There are parallels, but there were specific and more difficult ways to contract the HIV virus, whether through intravenous drug use or anal sex. COVID is there for absolutely everyone to catch, just from touching your face.” While she resists being labeled as something of a figurehead for the New York drag scene (“the New York drag community thinks of me as what I am: a nut,” she laughs), she is more philosophical when it comes to the profound impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the future of queer nightlife. “Drag queens, like 80% of the country, often live paycheck to paycheck, and our fans realize that we don’t have anymore paychecks coming in for the foreseeable future,” she adds. “But maybe we don’t have to be in the same room with our fans. We don’t even have to be in the same city or country. If we do something that’s downloadable, everyone can enjoy it all over the world.”</p>
<p>It’s in these more self-reflective moments that it’s possible to see the other side of Lady Bunny, whose close-to-the-bone humor is always undercut by more nuanced political analysis. A staunch Bernie Sanders supporter in the Democratic primaries of both 2016 and 2020, Bunny has thrown her social media weight behind everything from abolishing super PACs and corporate funding to electoral campaigns to defunding the police in the wake of the recent Black Lives Matter protests initiated by the murder of George Floyd. Her risqué brand of comedy may not be politically correct, but it isn’t a product of ignorance. “By sticking to posts which are more humorous, it brings people joy in this really dark time,” she notes. “That’s why I chose this profession. I’m very much driven by and fascinated by politics. I’m more likely to check political figures on Twitter when I get home from work than check out drag queen makeup tutorials or performances in pageants.”</p>
<p>“At the same time, I’m not in any way suggesting that things are not as serious as they are,” she continues. “People might say that COVID-19 jokes are insensitive right now—well, I’ve had friends who’ve died from this. I live around the corner from a hospital where there’s a refrigerated truck that is a makeshift morgue. At 57, I’m three years away from the 60-year-old danger zone and have another preexisting condition as well, and I live in the world center of the pandemic, in New York City. If I can’t laugh at it, who can?”</p>
<p>It’s these more sobering facts that make Bunny’s approach to humor feel less like something that trades on shock value, and instead as something strangely defiant. “I got through the AIDS crisis losing friends left and right, not shying away from AIDS humor,” she adds. “So why would I shy away from this humor now? For all I know, I could get COVID and die in a few weeks. It’s not time for me to change who I am. If I am going out, I’m going to go out with a laugh.” Right on cue, Bunny erupts in cackles once again.

<h3 id="pet-shop-boys-where-to-start-in-their-back-catalogue">&ldquo;Pet Shop Boys: where to start in their back catalogue&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad751714c2e50096485fd95173ba88b35a16c5d6/0_225_2000_1199/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=25578488a9e7a35528e161089bff1e7e" alt="img">
In Listener’s digest, we help you explore the work of great musicians. Next: the peerless pop duo who elegantly delved into the big issues</p>
<p>The album to start with</p>
<p>Actually</p>
<p>Released in 1987, Actually opens with a seemingly disparate drum roll, Dancing Queen glissando and the squeal of car tyres, and rockets into a succinct 10 songs that bring the lecture hall to the club. Anchored by Neil Tennant’s deadpan delivery, highbrow doesn’t so much meet lowbrow as invites it in and spends a very pleasant evening debating socioeconomic issues with it before taking it out for a sweaty make-out sesh in a high-NRG club.</p>
<p>Rather than sticking to mindless hooks and vapid lyricism as some of their contemporaries did, the Pet Shop Boys elegantly delved into big issues. It’s a Sin picks apart the dichotomy of being Catholic and gay, mixing monastic chanting, reverential echo and house-felling drops. It Couldn’t Happen Here was one of three songs Tennant wrote about the Aids crisis and its specific effect on and subsequent passing of a friend. It has the feel of a quivering lip in a stoic face, a reasoned argument when all you want to do is rage. (The strings were arranged by Angelo Badalamenti, but recorded on a Fairlight when nobody remembered to book an actual orchestra).</p>
<p>But amid the soul-searching, there’s the pure pop adrenaline of Heart, the wonderful silliness of Shopping and the utter perfection of What Have I Done to Deserve This?, a duet with a mid-slump Dusty Springfield. The beauty of the Pet Shop Boys, and of Actually in particular, is the deftness with which they manoeuvre from all-out pop to elegiac melancholy and back again. They understood, instinctively, that pop music was not to be underestimated, revelling in it rather than sneering or cynically exploiting it for commercial gain. The result is an album that barely feels like it’s aged in the era of 80s revivalism. Sparklingly clever and skirting naff like a strobe light on a dancefloor, Actually is that rare thing: a second album that pleased everyone.</p>
<p>The three to hear next</p>
<p>Behaviour</p>
<p>“It’s fundamental that what we do only exists in our own universe,” Tennant told Melody Maker around the release of 1990’s Behaviour. “When you like Pet Shop Boys, you are in our world.” That world, which had been all camp-couture and adrenaline-surging pop, was about to graduate into something more sombre.</p>
<p>The melancholy Behaviour marked the end of the Boys’ imperial period – the age when that secret recipe for hits was infallible – as they entered a more reflective era. Being Boring, which Tennant and Lowe had been sure was a hit, flopped in the charts but has long been a fan favourite, not just because of the petulance of the title (coined after they were accused of “being boring”) and the indignant hook but also because of its subject matter, namely the same friend whose death Tennant sang about in It Couldn’t Happen Here. Being Boring tracks the move from adolescence to adulthood and, in parallel, from health to death.</p>
<p>Behaviour has come to be seen as a gateway from the 80s Pets into 90s Pets. It saw them experimenting with musical arrangements that hinted at their future theatrical aspirations, albeit under woozy synthscapes. “Also it probably didn’t have irritatingly crass ideas in it,” Tennant later said, “like our songs often do.” Which is quite something for an album that includes songs titled How Can You Expect to Be Taken Seriously? and My October Symphony.</p>
<p>Electric</p>
<p>On 2002’s Release, sad-lad guitar music had infiltrated the Pets’ world. Thankfully they’d got that out of their system and by 2013’s Electric, Johnny Marr’s six-string was out and thumping dance and vocals beamed in from another planet were in. With the weight of 11 studio albums behind them, they were wary of making something that sounded like a carbon copy of what they’d done before. The brief producer Stuart Price received was: Electric was to be a dance record. Every track, even the down tempo ones, were to have “that euphoric, fresh feel”.</p>
<p>It is near impossible to listen to Electric without closing your eyes and feeling the dancefloor around you; the lights swirling behind your eyelids, the feel of bodies pressing against you from all angles. The searing joy of dance underpins the entire album; lyrics are sparse and Lowe’s arrangements given space to shine. In some ways, the yearning romance of Love is a Bourgeois Construct is peak Pet Shop Boys: the music is based on a Michael Nyman piece, which in turn was based on a Henry Purcell piece, while the lyrics tell the story of an intellectual abandoned by their lover, based on a passage in David Lodge’s 1988 novel Nice Work. It’s also a huge, incomparable banger.</p>
<p>Disco</p>
<p>The Pet Shop Boys love remixes. Having another artist rework their songs is the only way for Tennant and Lowe to hear their music as fans do – and this first remix record was something of a screw you to anyone who’d ever described any of their songs as radio-unfriendly. Some tracks from Please and some B-sides were reworked by the Pets themselves and frequent Pets producers Julian Mendelssohn and Shep Pettibone, among others. The result is a short album that speaks to the unending versatility of song and the Pets Shop Boys’ view of their music as a living entity that can be set free rather than be closely guarded.</p>
<p>One for the heads</p>
<p>The Birthday Boy</p>
<p>It’s almost impossible to pick a deep cut from the Pets’ vast back catalogue: their love of remixes, their host of albums, collaborations, covers, gorgeously inventive live performances, entire musical shows … so I’ve picked a deeply sad one. It’s easy to get wrapped up in the poppers o’clock hits because the Pets are peerless in that arena but they’re also masters of the tragic – and this moving Christmas ballad about Jesus’s return to Earth only to be murdered in a racist attack is about as lushly tragic as it gets.</p>

<p>Neil Tennant on West End Girls: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s about sex and escape. It&rsquo;s paranoid&rsquo; Read more</p>
<p>Further reading</p>
<p>Literally, by Chris Heath</p>
<p>In possibly the greatest music book ever written, journalist Chris Heath joins the Pet Shop Boys on tour in Japan in the late 80s and spends hours talking with them about absolutely everything. (There is a lot of shopping.) Incredibly detailed, thoroughly entertaining – and the ending is a peerless kiss-off to everyone’s favourite troll, Piers Morgan.</p>
<p>One Hundred Lyrics and a Poem, by Neil Tennant</p>
<p>As author of some of the silliest, cleverest and most impressively intellectual lyrics in the game, Tennant’s anthology is worth poring over. His brief but entertaining anecdotes on each of the songs he’s chosen are entertaining and illuminating in equal measure.</p>
<p>Imperial, by Tom Ewing</p>
<p>Neil Tennant was the man who coined the term “imperial phase”, namely the period when a pop star simply cannot put a foot wrong. In this contemporary examination of the phrase and how it relates to both the Pet Shop Boys and modern pop, Ewing tracks not only the group’s own imperial phase but also the band’s legacy.</p>

<h3 id="willmott-dixon-wins-18m-historic-cinema-restoration">&ldquo;Willmott Dixon wins £18m historic cinema restoration&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.constructionenquirer.com/wp-content/uploads/EMD-Cinema-Walthamstow-1200x828.jpg" alt="img">
The fit-out specialist has earned top billing to deliver an £18m conversion of Walthamstow’s grade II EMD cinema into the UK’s finest theatre for comedy.</p>
<p>The art deco landmark opened as the Granada cinema in 1930. In its heyday, it hosted performances by The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Dusty Springfield and Johnny Cash.</p>
<p>After closing in 2003, it became derelict and was on the buildings at risk register.</p>
<p>It will now be transformed into a 950-seat comedy hub run by Soho Theatre.</p>
<p>The intricate refurbishment will include reshaping the seating and stage to allow live performances with improved sightlines, while the ziggurat ceiling and the building’s frontage will be restored to their former glory.</p>
<p>Graham Shaw, managing director for Willmott Dixon Interiors said: “We are delighted to be involved in restoring this historic landmark that is part of Waltham Forest’s heritage so it can once again be a popular venue for people to visit.</p>
<p>Our team has configured the site to meet the latest guideless to ensure it is Covid-19 secure so we can carry out the refurbishment safely during the current pandemic.”</p>
<p>The project follows similar schemes by Willmott Dixon to transform Grade 2* and heritage property across the UK into popular entertainment venues, including the Stockton Globe, Colston Hall in Bristol, Darlington Hippodrome, Octagon Theatre in Bolton and Eltham Cinema in Greenwich.

<h3 id="norah-jones-i-worried-about-being-swallowed-up-by-success">&ldquo;Norah Jones: &lsquo;I worried about being swallowed up by success&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>

Seven Years (2002)</p>
<p>To this day, it is hard to reconcile the supernatural success of Norah Jones’s debut album with the shy 22-year-old at its centre. Released in 2002, Come Away With Me went many times platinum around the world, and remains one of the biggest-selling records of all time. Jones did not enjoy the frenzy that emerged around her, particularly the media’s fixation with her relationship with the sitar great Ravi Shankar, the once-estranged father with whom she had only recently been reacquainted. “I was trying to have fun with the success, but at the same time, I was a little too worried about getting swallowed up by it all,” she says.</p>
<p>Today, she is calling from her Brooklyn bedroom around the start of lockdown, stealing an hour away from homeschooling her two young children to discuss the musical highlights of her career. There is a parallel there with the song she selects from Come Away With Me. Jones wrote only a few songs on her debut album, and Seven Years was not one of them; her then-boyfriend, the bassist Lee Alexander, wrote it after seeing a home video of Jones dancing as a child. “It was just a very sweet sentiment,” she says. “A child in her own world, being happy and content.”</p>
<p>As breezy as Come Away With Me sounded, recording it took two attempts. Jones’s voice got lost on the first recordings, although Seven Years survived those sessions. “I was in the studio with a bunch of musicians that I respected so much but just didn’t know that well,” she says. “Because I wasn’t super comfortable, maybe that’s why I didn’t come through.” A second go, aided by the renowned producer Arif Mardin, provided the goods, and made Jones the seminal jazz label Blue Note’s first pop icon.</p>
<p>While only a fraction older than the likes of Britney and Christina, Jones existed in an another universe, although she thinks she attended one MTV video music awards ceremony. “I felt like I was crashing a lot of parties, I’ll put it that way.” Some critics theorised that listeners were drawn to the album’s comforting vibe in the aftermath of 9/11. She disagreed at the time, “but looking back, I definitely think that could have been part of it”.</p>
<p>Sunrise (2004)</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest Norah Jones: Sunrise – video</p>
<p>The only way to follow such a smash was to let go, says Jones. The dreamy Sunrise is a testament to the easy feeling she got from playing with the guitarists Kevin Breit and Adam Levy, recording her second album on a mountain in upstate New York and channelling the her love of Dolly Parton, who guested on Feels Like Home. Contradicting critics who dismissed it as bland, the New Yorker described Jones’s second album as “one big booty call” and claimed her music was all about sex. “I definitely don’t agree!” she laughs. “Though people relate to music how they relate to it, so I don’t disagree, either. In college, I had an album I liked to listen to with my boyfriend at the time. Everybody has that album, right? Fine with me if it’s one of mine.”</p>
<p>The more pointed criticisms sometimes got to her. “But whatever, should I crawl in a hole and not release music because of some other person?” The music industry, however, couldn’t get enough, and the “Norah effect” precipitated the signing of Amy Winehouse, Katie Melua, Joss Stone and numerous other soulful young women. Jones didn’t mind their music but was less keen on the association. “It wasn’t stuff I wanted to listen to, and when people would put me in the same category as someone else, I wouldn’t agree,” she says. “But I had to separate myself from it all. The truth is some great artists came out of that and that’s awesome.”</p>

<p>Rosie’s Lullaby (2007)</p>
<p>Jones wrote Rosie’s Lullaby while touring Australia, about a friend who was going through a hard time. But it is not hard to interpret the lyrics about a woman “feelin’ so small / At the bottom of the world” as self-reflection. “It was probably about both of us,” she admits. Jones felt “kinda depressed” when making her third album, Not Too Late. “I was lonely and sad and the world was kinda falling apart.” Touring the second album had been crazier still than the first. “I was just trying to keep together, to be honest,” she says. “I was drinking on tour, and I was never a super-destructive drinker, which is good, but I was still just drinking a lot, which is not great.” There were fun times, she recalls, and good meals, but touring for the best part of a year, “you get a little delirious”.</p>
<p>Looseness became a release valve. Not Too Late came together from off-the-cuff recording sessions that Jones hid from her label. She started various side projects: the countrified Little Willies, the rockier El Madmo. “We were playing sports arenas in France, which was insane,” she says of her day job. “We set up our instruments backstage in some men’s locker room and would write silly pop songs that became the El Madmo record, trying to find ways to stay sane.”</p>
<p>Chasing Pirates (2009)</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest Norah Jones: Chasing Pirates – video</p>
<p>Jones’s “mind’s racing” on this song from The Fall, as a message from a lover leaves her “mixed up”. The sentiment could be anxious or anticipatory. “I was probably feeling both things, to be honest,” says Jones. She and Alexander had broken up, prompting her to seek an entirely new band and a different sound.</p>
<p>The Fall is darker and smokier than her previous albums, intermingling the spirits of Dusty Springfield and Massive Attack. It was also her first album primarily comprised of her own writing: she credits Ryan Adams, who plays on the album, with encouraging her when she felt insecure about her abilities. “It lifted me up as a songwriter and made me feel validated.” She says she doesn’t know much about the allegations against him. “It just wasn’t my experience with him. I feel bad for everybody involved.”</p>
<p>You can hear Jones coming into her own on The Fall, her dramatic vocals standing out instead of following the flow as she had on previous records. Performing covers, she says, “you’re listening to the sound of your voice a little more instead of delivering the lyrics”. But writing original material, “I was delivering the lyrics a little more”. Coming out of a relationship that she had been in for most of her 20s was jarring. “We had been together since before my first album came out, so then it became navigating who I was post-success, without that partner who was with me through it all,” she says. “It was a very strange time. But I had a lot of good friends who I knew from before, and in New York, there’s always some good music to go and hear.”</p>
<p>All a Dream (2012)</p>
<p>Jones’s fifth album, Little Broken Hearts, reinvented her process even more starkly. After collaborating with Danger Mouse, AKA Brian Burton, on his 2011 album Rome, she asked if he would work with her on a new set of songs that she had written. But Burton likes to start with a blank slate. “At the time I was a little confused, but once we started, I completely understood,” say Jones.</p>
<p>All a Dream was one of the first songs they made together: a noir meditation on the lingering effects of a bad love affair. They worked on the fly, prompting Jones to embrace roughness, using recordings that she had intended as scratch demos. It was a transformative experience. “Before, I was terrified of having to finish songs before I went into the studio,” she says. “Now, with the new album that I’m putting out, a lot of these songs were not finished. I went in having faith in the process and the lightning bolt of inspiration that comes with making music. I learned a lot of that from working with Brian.”</p>
<p>It’s a Wonderful Time for Love (2016)</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest Norah Jones: It’s a Wonderful Time for Love (live on Jimmy Kimmel) – video</p>
<p>Day Breaks was hailed as Jones’s return to jazz, although there is a sly maturity to the album, and especially Wonderful Time, that Jones says would have eluded her at 22. This song, she says, is the rare example of “something that happens when you capture exactly what you want, what you’re hearing in your head plus what other musicians play and bring to the table that you couldn’t even have imagined”.</p>
<p>One of those musicians was the jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter, whose solo albums – and work on Joni Mitchell’s early 90s records – are among Jones’s favourites. “He’s an incredible human,” she says. “My favourite thing about him is that he doesn’t play unless he’s feeling it. He’s not just gonna noodle around and find the tune, he’s gonna sit there and listen until he feels something and it moves him, and then he plays the most incredible thing. That’s different from anyone I’ve ever worked with.”</p>
<p>Wonderful Time scans as a love song, but it’s “more of a romantic humanity song”, says Jones. It was written as the US lurched towards Trumpism. “It’s more about: let’s lift each other up and send love to each other in a hard time,” she says. “Instead of saying: let’s get together romantically. It’s more than that.”</p>
<p>It Was You (2019)</p>
<p>On her seventh record, Jones applied the lessons she learned from Danger Mouse with such commitment that it is hard to call Begin Again an album. It is a collection of seven songs, made off the cuff in the studio with collaborators including Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy and the pianist Thomas Bartlett. She released them one by one and compiled them later.</p>
<p>The title track, written with Emily Fiskio and produced by Jones, was a true bolt from the blue. “I didn’t know what it was about until after we recorded it.” She is shy about saying what it meant to her: “It feels a little bit like it’s about God to me.” There was no literal, spiritual shift in her life, “but I was definitely feeling a lot of things at the time, maybe a little sad about certain things in my life. I think as we get older, that comes in and out more and more: we think about our humanity and happiness and our family and our loved ones.”</p>
<p>Despite the heavy themes, the making of Begin Again only continued to lift any burden of expectation from Jones’s career. Releasing one track at a time, she was excited to embrace the possibilities offered by streaming services, “and also give myself a break”, she says. “To get inspired to make music without having a huge album arc. It really freed me up and made me more inspired than ever.”</p>
<p>Flame Twin (2020)</p>
<p>For her eighth album, Jones took some inspiration from an unlikely source. “Reading Dr Seuss stories to my children every night, I feel rhymes in my head constantly,” she says. That, plus the encouragement of a poet friend, led Jones to start writing her own poetry, which she turned into three of the songs on her new record. “I’m certainly not going to release a book of poetry at this point in my life,” she says emphatically.</p>
<p>Once again, Jones hadn’t intended to make an album – until she realised this group of songs “all matched”. The ad hoc assembly reminded her of a photograph her husband took of her on the ground, so she called the record Pick Me Up Off the Floor. It has a heavy mood, dramatic vocals, songs about division and irreconcilable differences. Jones has previously said: “If there’s a darkness to this album, it’s not meant to be an impending sense of doom. It feels more like a human longing for connection.”</p>
<p>It is an eerie sentiment for an album that is ultimately being released into social isolation. “It feels kind of silly to talk about my music when people are sick, but at the same time, music lifts people up and I hope that they connect to it,” says Jones. She and her husband have been listening to John Prine (this interview was done before his death from the virus), Townes Van Zandt and Guns N’ Roses. “It’s certainly been making me feel better in this weird time,” she says. “What are you gonna do except what you do, right?”</p>
<p>• Pick Me Up Off the Floor is out now on EMI
