SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 66 new COVID-19 cases on Monday (Apr 6), bringing the national total to 1,375, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in its daily update.</p>
<p>One of the new cases is imported and the remaining cases are locally transmitted. Twenty-four more patients have been discharged, taking the total number of people who have fully recovered to 344.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Among the local cases, MOH has established links to existing clusters for 35 cases. Of these, 24 are linked to clusters at foreign dormitories and 11 are linked to non-dormitory clusters.</p>
<p>A total of 30 of the new cases are unlinked, and contact tracing is ongoing for these patients.</p>
<p>Of the 571 patients who are still in hospital, most are stable or improving, and 25 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>NEW CLUSTERS</p>
<p>Two new clusters were also identified, according to the ministry.</p>
<p>They are Little Gems Preschool at 3 Ang Mo Kio Street 62, and Kranji Lodge at 12 Kranji Road.</p>
<p>Case 1335, one of the newly confirmed cases, is linked to cases 1182 and 1294. These three form the cluster at Little Gems Preschool.</p>
<p>The preschool has been temporarily closed for cleaning and disinfection since Sunday after a teacher tested positive for the coronavirus. The Early Childhood Development Agency said it was informed of the case on Saturday.</p>
<p>She was last at the centre on Mar 31 and contact tracing is ongoing, the agency added.</p>
<p>The closure will last until Apr 14, covering a 14-day incubation period after the staff member last went to the preschool.</p>
<p>The centre will resume limited service on Apr 15 for children of parents who are working in essential services and are unable to extend their alternative care arrangements beyond the closure period, &ldquo;barring any new developments&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Kranji Lodge cluster is made up of three people who had tested positive for COVID-19 earlier: Cases 880, 1190 and 1241.</p>
<p>A link between the PCF Sparkletots Preschool @ Fengshan cluster and a family member of the school&rsquo;s principal, was also uncovered through further epidemiological investigations, MOH said.</p>
<p>The cluster, with 27 confirmed cases, consisted of a family cluster of 11 cases who are family members of the school&rsquo;s principal, Case 601.</p>
<p>The principal&rsquo;s family member, Case 566, had travelled to Malaysia on Mar 4 and &ldquo;was likely infected there&rdquo;, MOH said.</p>
<p>Case 566 subsequently transmitted the infection to other family members, including Case 601. The rest of the affected staff members of the preschool likely became infected by the principal through a staff meeting, the ministry added.</p>
<p>MORE CASES LINKED TO FOREIGN WORKER DORMS</p>
<p>More cases have been linked to the clusters at two foreign worker dormitories which have been gazetted as isolation areas.</p>
<p>MOH said 25 more cases are linked to the cluster at S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, which has a total of 88 confirmed cases now.</p>
<p>The cluster at Westlite Toh Guan dormitory now has a total of 29 confirmed cases linked to it, after one more case was identified in Monday&rsquo;s update.</p>
<p>All 19,800 foreign workers housed at the two dorms would be quarantined in their rooms for the next 14 days, authorities announced on Sunday.</p>
<p>Six more cases are linked to the cluster at Toh Guan Dormitory, which has a total of 14 confirmed cases. The dormitory is located in the vicinity of Westlite Toh Guan.</p>
<p>Beside the above-mentioned three dorms, also reporting more cases linked to their respective clusters are Sungei Tengah Lodge (two more cases, six total), Tampines Dormitory (four more cases, nine total), Cochrane Lodge II (one more case, four total) and a dormitory at 55 Sungei Kadut Loop (one more case, four total).</p>
<p>Two additional cases are linked to the cluster at a construction site at Project Glory, which now has a total of 16 confirmed cases. Another construction site at 6 Battery Road reported an additional case linked to the cluster there, which has five confirmed cases now.</p>
<p>The cluster at Mustafa Centre has 12 more cases linked to it, making its total confirmed cases 40.</p>
<p>Two more cases are linked to the cluster at Keppel Shipyard, with the total at nine cases now.</p>
<p>The cluster at Ce La Vi saw an addition of one case. It now has five cases in total.</p>
<p>Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that Singapore has been conducting around 2,000 coronavirus tests daily. As of Monday, the country has conducted more than 65,000 tests.</p>
<p>He provided these numbers in a written answer on Monday to a parliamentary question by Nominated Member of Parliament Walter Theseira.</p>
<p>Assoc Prof Theseira had also asked if the Ministry of health will report any other national health statistics relating to COVID-19 to enable researchers to gather &ldquo;internationally comparable datasets&rdquo; on the pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ministry of Health reports the relevant COVID-19 information and statistics regularly to keep Singaporeans updated. We also share information on the number of tests conducted from time to time where relevant,&rdquo; said Mr Gan in his reply.</p>
<p>THIRD SUPPORT PACKAGE TO SUPPORT SINGAPORE</p>
<p>As part of the country&rsquo;s ongoing battle against COVID-19, a third support package announced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Monday.</p>
<p>The S$5.1 billion Solidarity Budget is aimed at saving jobs and protecting livelihoods during the four weeks when schools and non-essential businesses have to be shut as part of the “circuit breaker” distancing measures that will kick in from Tuesday.</p>
<p>From Tuesday, most workplaces islandwide will be closed and schools will move to full home-based learning, as announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last week. Only essential services like food establishments, markets and supermarkets, clinics, hospitals, utilities, transport and key banking services will remain open.</p>
<p>Mr Heng said on Monday the COVID-19 pandemic had &ldquo;exploded&rdquo; in Singapore in recent days. To date, Singapore has seen six COVID-19 fatalities.</p>
<p>Singapore has “progressively” ramped up its measures but as the number of infections – especially local transmitted cases – kept rising in recent days, the Government decided to roll out an “extraordinary” set of “circuit breaker” measures to pre-empt the escalation, he said.</p>
<p>This is the first time that the Singapore Government has released three Budgets in less than two months, following the S$6.4 billion Unity Budget in February and the record-breaking S$48 billion Resilience Budget on Mar 26.</p>
<p>To fund this third booster, the Government has sought permission from President Halimah Yacob to draw an additional S$4 billion from past reserves, on top of the S$17 billion tapped for the Resilience Budget.</p>
<p>Altogether, Singapore will be committing S$59.9 billion, or about 12 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), for this battle against the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

Officials carry out disinfection works at streets during the state of emergency by the government against the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak in Madrid, Spain on April 5, 2020. Anadolu Agency</p>
<p>The coverage on this live blog has ended — but for up-to-the-minute coverage on the coronavirus, visit the live blog from CNBC&rsquo;s U.S. team. Global cases: More than 1.27 million</p>
<p>Global deaths: At least 69,300</p>

<p>7:27 pm: German government says it can&rsquo;t say when coronavirus restrictions will end</p>
<p>The German government has said it can&rsquo;t give a date for when lockdown restrictions will be lifted, a spokesman said on Monday. &ldquo;Even if some people are demanding it, the government can&rsquo;t yet give an exit day, a firm date from which everything will be different and the measures relaxed,&rdquo; Steffen Seibert told a news conference, Reuters reported. Currently, Germany&rsquo;s lockdown is scheduled to end on April 19. — Holly Ellyatt</p>
<p>7:24 pm: A loss of taste and smell may be the best way to tell if you have coronavirus, new study shows</p>
<p>If tests are not available, a loss of taste and smell could be the best way to detect whether someone has contracted the coronavirus, according to U.K. researchers. A research team at King&rsquo;s College London assessed the responses of more than 400,000 people reporting one or more suspected symptoms of COVID-19 to an app. The data analyzed showed that 59% of those who tested positive for the virus reported a loss of smell and taste, compared with only 18% of who tested negative for the disease. These results, the researchers said, were &ldquo;much stronger&rdquo; in predicting positive COVID-19 diagnoses than a self-reported fever. — Sam Meredith</p>
<p>6:50 pm: Japan&rsquo;s Abe unveils &lsquo;massive&rsquo; coronavirus stimulus worth 20% of GDP</p>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged on Monday to roll out an unprecedented economic stimulus package, equal to 20% of economic output, as his government vowed to take &ldquo;all steps&rdquo; to battle deepening fallout from the coronavirus, Reuters reported. The package, to be confirmed by the cabinet on Tuesday, will total 108 trillion yen ($989 billion), far exceeding one compiled in the wake of the 2009 financial crisis totaling 56 trillion yen in size, with fiscal spending of 15 trillion yen. — Reuters</p>
<p>6:33 pm: JPMorgan&rsquo;s Jamie Dimon says US can emerge from crisis stronger</p>
<p>Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, released his widely-read annual letter on Monday in which he said the U.S. has &ldquo;the resources to emerge from this crisis as a stronger country,&rdquo; Dimon said. &ldquo;America is still the most prosperous nation the world has ever seen.&ldquo;JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, is prepared for the tumult caused by the coronavirus epidemic, he said. — Hugh Son</p>
<p>5:55 pm: Spain&rsquo;s daily death toll continues to decline</p>

<p>5:15 pm: Europe looks for lockdown exit strategy as rate of new coronavirus cases and deaths slows</p>
<p>There are tentative hopes in Europe that the coronavirus outbreak could be slowing, as the number of new infections and fatalities starts to slow down, according to data over the weekend. The figures are prompting European leaders to look for an exit strategy to national lockdowns, while urging the public to maintain discipline while the apparent recovery from the outbreak is in its infancy. — Holly Ellyatt</p>
<p>4:45 pm: UK car sales fell 44% in March, industry data shows</p>
<p>U.K. passenger car sales in March fell 44% compared with the same month last year to 254,684 units, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said on Monday. The group, representing Britain&rsquo;s car industry, cut its 2020 sales forecast by 23% to 1.73 million vehicles because of the impact of the coronavirus crisis. That&rsquo;s 25% lower than the 2.31 million units registered in 2019. A further outlook will be published in April to reflect the latest conditions. — Holly Ellyatt</p>
<p>4:33 pm: UK leader Boris Johnson &lsquo;doing well&rsquo; in hospital, minister insists</p>
<p>U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is &ldquo;doing well&rdquo; and is expected to be back at his office shortly, Housing Minister Robert Jenrick told the BBC on Monday. It comes after Johnson was admitted to hospital on Sunday night for tests, 10 days after testing positive for coronavirus. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll stay in hospital as long as he needs to do that, but I&rsquo;ve heard that he&rsquo;s doing well and I very much look forward to him being back in Number 10 as soon as possible,&rdquo; Jenrick told BBC radio. — Holly Ellyatt</p>
<p>4:12 pm: Germany says it&rsquo;s &lsquo;still at the beginning of the epidemic&rsquo; despite rate of new cases slowing</p>
<p>Germany has been lauded for appearing to be on top of its coronavirus epidemic, and there are reasons to be hopeful; the daily number of new infections in Germany dropped for the fourth day in a row on Monday. But Germany&rsquo;s public health body, the Richard Koch Institute for infectious diseases, is cautious, telling CNBC that the country&rsquo;s comparatively low mortality rate (the case fatality rate) should not be taken as a measure of the country&rsquo;s success in combating the virus just yet. &ldquo;First of all, it is far too early to speak of a success story here. Germany — at least at the moment — sees a lower case fatality rate than other countries,&rdquo; Marieke Degen, a deputy spokeswoman at the RKI, told CNBC. &ldquo;Germany is still at the beginning of the epidemic. We see more and more deaths now and we can&rsquo;t predict how everything develops,&rdquo; she added. — Holly Ellyatt</p>
<p>2:45 pm: Singapore announces third stimulus package worth $3.6 billion</p>
<p>Singapore announced another 5.1 billion Singapore dollars ($3.6 billion) in stimulus to soften the economic damage from the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. That&rsquo;s the third stimulus package that Singapore has announced since the outbreak. Together with the previous two packages, the Southeast Asian country has set aside 59.9 billion Singapore dollars ($41.7 billion), accounting for around 12% of the country&rsquo;s gross domestic product The latest stimulus was planned to help businesses and households tide through the coming month, during which stricter social-distancing measures — which include closing schools and shutting workplaces temporarily — will kick in starting Tuesday. — Yen Nee Lee</p>
<p>2:15 pm: US Forces Japan declares public health emergency for Kanto bases</p>
<p>The U.S. Forces Japan commander declared a public health emergency for military bases in the Kanto region east of Japan. The region includes Tokyo which has seen a recent surge of the coronavirus disease, formally known as COVID-19. &ldquo;Due to the steady increase in COVID-19 cases in the Tokyo area, I have implemented a Public Health Emergency for the Kanto Plains region,&rdquo; said Lt. Gen. Kevin Schneider, U.S. Forces Japan commander in a statement. &ldquo;This order covers all Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine installations and facilities in the area.&rdquo; — Huileng Tan</p>
<p>2:10 pm: Cases in India rise despite the ongoing lockdown</p>
<p>India&rsquo;s health ministry said as of Monday morning, there are at least 4,067 confirmed cases of infection and 109 deaths from COVID-19. Around 292 people have been cured and discharged. Despite being in the middle of a 21-day lockdown, India&rsquo;s reported cases have climbed in recent days; on Sunday evening, the country was said to have around 3,374 confirmed cases and 79 deaths. — Saheli Roy Choudhury</p>
<p>1:30 pm: Coronavirus may add $300 billion credit in costs to Asia Pacific banks, says S&amp;P</p>
<p>Banks in Asia Pacific could chalk up an additional $300 billion in lenders&rsquo; credit costs and a $600 million increase in non-performing assets in 2020, S&amp;P Global Ratings said in a report on Monday. Although banks are not as exposed as the corporate sector during the initial states of the coronavirus pandemic, the strain on lenders could ultimately be &ldquo;profound,&rdquo; said S&amp;P. &ldquo;Banks face a second-order hit compared with the corporate and household sectors. It&rsquo;s the snowballing effects on people movement (tourism, business travel, and education), supply chains, trade, and commodity prices that will eventually hit bank asset quality, and may disrupt bank credit ratings,&rdquo; added the ratings agency. — Huileng Tan</p>
<p>1:12 pm: India faces delays for one-fifth of its renewable energy installations due to lockdowns</p>
<p>India could see delays for over 21.6% or 3 gigawatts of solar photovoltaic and wind installations as lockdowns to contain the coronavirus outbreak cause supply and labor disruptions, said Wood Mackenzie, a commodities consultancy. That is particularly as the states that have reported the highest rates of infections — Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan — are also those that are favorable to wind and solar development, said the consultancy in a report. &ldquo;The timing of the lockdown is unfortunate as Q1 is typically one of the busiest periods for wind project installations. The lockdown will delay some projects until summer, and if the lockdown is extended past April, wind farm construction could be further delayed into the monsoon season, where wind installations are typically at their lowest,&rdquo; said Robert Liew, principal analyst at Wood Mackenzie. — Huileng Tan</p>
<p>12:14 pm: Japan&rsquo;s coronavirus panel to meet Monday afternoon to prepare for state of emergency, Nikkei reports</p>
<p>The Japanese government&rsquo;s advisory panel on the coronavirus outbreak will meet Monday at 2pm local time in preparation for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe&rsquo;s declaration of a state of emergency, the Nikkei Business Daily reported. (See 8:51 am update) — Huileng Tan</p>

<p>Singapore&rsquo;s health ministry said that around 19,800 foreign resident workers housed in two dormitories have been placed under a 14-day quarantine due to the growing number of confirmed infection cases from those places.

<p>7:31 am: Global death count from coronavirus above 69,300</p>
<p>At least 69,309 people worldwide have died from coronavirus-related complications, according to the latest numbers from Johns Hopkins University. Many of those fatalities have taken place in Europe: Italy has reported 15,887 deaths, Spain reported 12,641 deaths and France reported 8,078 people have died. The United Kingdom saw at least 4,934 deaths, the JHU data said. The fast-spreading virus, which causes the illness COVID-19, has affected more than 1.2 million people around the globe. It was first reported in China&rsquo;s Hubei province late last year; in the United States, the virus has infected more than 335,500. To be clear, the actual number of coronavirus cases is impossible to tally on a country-by-country basis because many nations don&rsquo;t adequately track cases, and there&rsquo;s rising suspicion that some countries intentionally under-report their numbers. — Saheli Roy Choudhury All times below are in Eastern time.</p>
