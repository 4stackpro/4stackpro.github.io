LONDON — A day before they cease being working members of the British royal family, Prince Harry and his wife Meghan on Monday wound down their popular social media sites and transferred the management of their image and philanthropy to a new team of advisers in Los Angeles, where they recently moved.</p>
<p>The couple marked the milestone on the same Instagram page where they famously announced their plan two months ago to “step back” from their duties and relocate to North America. It was a quiet coda to the dramatic rupture between Harry and Meghan and the House of Windsor.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that the world had changed since their personal saga commanded breathless headlines, the couple said they would prefer that attention remain fixed on the coronavirus pandemic. They said little about their future, beyond noting that it would be affected by the crisis sweeping the world.</p>
<p>“What’s most important right now is the health and well-being of everyone across the globe and finding solutions for the many issues that have presented themselves as a result of this pandemic,” the couple said. “We are focusing this new chapter to understand how we can best contribute.”

<h3 id="trump-said-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-must-pay-for-their-own-security-protection-now-that-theyve-moved-to-los-angeles-from-canada">Trump said Prince Harry and Meghan Markle &lsquo;must pay&rsquo; for their own security protection now that they&rsquo;ve moved to Los Angeles from Canada</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.insider.com/5e80f421ba85ee66aa3ce2e3?width=1200&amp;format=jpeg" alt="img">
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are scheduled to cease their royal duties on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The couple, along with their son, Archie, have reportedly relocated to Los Angeles from Canada, where they temporarily resided after announcing their plans to step back from royal duties.</p>
<p>On Sunday, President Donald Trump tweeted that the couple would pay for their own security arrangements: &ldquo;The US will not pay for their security protection. They must pay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Canadian government officials had said their country&rsquo;s government paid for the couple&rsquo;s security while they resided there but would no longer do so after their transition out of royal life.</p>
<p>A representative for the couple said they had &ldquo;no plans to ask the US government for security resources.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Visit Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump tweeted Sunday that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle would pay for their own security arrangements now that they&rsquo;re said to be living in the US.</p>
<p>The couple moved to Los Angeles ahead of Canada&rsquo;s border closing, The Sun and People reported Friday, citing anonymous sources.</p>
<p>Buckingham Palace representatives declined to confirm the news Friday to Insider&rsquo;s royals reporter, Mikhaila Friel. Palace representatives have not responded to Insider&rsquo;s most recent request for comment.</p>
<p>In his tweet, Trump wrote: &ldquo;I am a great friend and admirer of the Queen &amp; the United Kingdom. It was reported that Harry and Meghan, who left the Kingdom, would reside permanently in Canada. Now they have left Canada for the U.S. however, the U.S. will not pay for their security protection. They must pay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chris Ship, a reporter for ITV News, later tweeted that a representative for the couple said they had &ldquo;no plans to ask the US government for security resources.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Privately funded security arrangements have been made,&rdquo; the representative said, according to the tweet.</p>
<p>Last June, Trump denied calling Meghan Markle &ldquo;nasty,&rdquo; despite a recording of an interview with The Sun in which he referred to her as such.</p>
<p>The couple and their son, Archie, had been residing in Canada since shortly after their announcement that they would be leaving their official royal duties. While the couple resided in Vancouver Island in the province of British Columbia, the Canadian government was paying for their security arrangements, Insider&rsquo;s Friel reported.</p>
<p>Recently, Canadian government officials announced that the country would no longer fund the couple&rsquo;s security costs when their royal duties ceased at the end of March.</p>
<p>Reports from CBC estimated that the family&rsquo;s security costs while they resided in Canada may have ranged from $1.7 million to as high as $30 million.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear what the royal family&rsquo;s security arrangements in the US could include or cost. The official Sussex Royal website&rsquo;s Spring 2020 Transition outline says the couple will require &ldquo;effective security to protect them and their son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The website says: &ldquo;This is based on The Duke&rsquo;s public profile by virtue of being born into The Royal Family, his military service, the Duchess&rsquo; own independent profile, and the shared threat and risk level documented specifically over the last few years. No further details can be shared as this is classified information for safety reasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their plans in January to transition out of formal royal duties</p>
<p>The couple reached an agreement with Queen Elizabeth II about their plans to depart from their traditional royal roles — in an ordeal that has informally become known as Megxit — which stated they would become financially independent, no longer fulfill official royal duties, and lose their HRH (His/Her Royal Highness) titles starting April 1.</p>
<p>They recently had their final royal engagements in the UK, where this now-iconic photo captured the couple in the rain.

<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190404175101-prince-harry-and-megan-markle-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) President Donald Trump said Sunday that the United States would not pay to protect Prince Harry and his wife Meghan if they move to the US, but the Duke and Duchess say they&rsquo;re not asking for any help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a great friend and admirer of the Queen &amp; the United Kingdom. It was reported that Harry and Meghan, who left the Kingdom, would reside permanently in Canada. Now they have left Canada for the U.S. however, the U.S. will not pay for their security protection. They must pay!&rdquo; Trump tweeted.</p>
<p>But a Sussex spokesperson said in a statement to CNN on Sunday that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have no plans to ask the US government for security resources. Privately funded security arrangements have been made.</p>
<p>In January, Harry and Meghan announced their decision to step back from royal life and become &ldquo;financially independent,&rdquo; sharing their desire to &ldquo;carve out a progressive new role within this institution&rdquo; in an Instagram post.
