Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:</p>
<p>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</p>
<p>a new continuous cough - this means you&rsquo;ve started coughing repeatedly</p>
<p>NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days.</p>
<p>If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>
<p>After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine. But, if anyone in your home gets symptoms, they should stay at home for 7 days from the day their symptoms start. Even if it means they&rsquo;re at home for longer than 14 days.</p>
<p>If you live with someone who is 70 or over, has a long-term condition, is pregnant or has a weakened immune system, try to find somewhere else for them to stay for 14 days.</p>
<p>If you have to stay at home together, try to keep away from each other as much as possible.</p>
<p>After 7 days, if you no longer have a high temperature you can return to your normal routine.</p>
<p>If you still have a high temperature, stay at home until your temperature returns to normal.</p>
<p>If you still have a cough after 7 days, but your temperature is normal, you do not need to continue staying at home. A cough can last for several weeks after the infection has gone.</p>
<p>Staying at home means you should:</p>
<p>not go to work, school or public areas</p>
<p>not use public transport or taxis</p>
<p>not have visitors, such as friends and family, in your home</p>
<p>not go out to buy food or collect medicine ‚Äì order them by phone or online, or ask someone else to drop them off at your home</p>
<p>You can use your garden, if you have one. You can also leave the house to exercise ‚Äì but stay at least 2 metres away from other people.</p>
<p>If you have symptoms of coronavirus, use the NHS 111 coronavirus service to find out what to do.</p>

Boris Johnson‚Äôs most senior adviser Dominic Cummings is reportedly self-isolating at home with coronavirus symptoms.</p>
<p>A Number 10 source told the MailOnline that Cummings is still ‚Äúin contact‚Äù with Downing Street colleagues.</p>

<p>A Downing Street spokesperson said they ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt expect‚Äù that Cummings had been tested.</p>
<p>It comes after the Prime Minister tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday, but is displaying only mild symptoms.</p>
<p>Johnson is still running the government‚Äôs coronavirus response operation while in self-isolation.</p>

<p>A video emerged on Friday of Cummings leaving Number 10 and running in the other direction, shortly after the Prime Minister announced he had tested positive for Covid-19.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister posted a video on social media last night to update the nation on the ‚Äúlatest steps the government is taking to fight the coronavirus‚Äù.</p>
<p>Notably, he said at the end of the video that the response to Covid-19 proved ‚Äúthere is such a thing as society‚Äù in a direct repudiation of Margaret Thatcher‚Äôs infamous quote that there is ‚Äúno such thing as a society‚Äù.</p>
<p>Johnson revealed that 20,000 former NHS staff have come back into the fold to help in the fight against Covid-19.</p>
<p>He also praised the 750,000 people who have now volunteered to help with the coronavirus response and pharmacists who are still at work.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are going to do it, we are going to do it together,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOne thing I think the coronavirus crisis has already proved, is that there really is such a thing as society.‚Äù</p>
<p>It comes as the UK‚Äôs deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said social distancing measures could be in place for six months or longer.</p>
<p>Dr Harries said yesterday that the length of restrictions would depend on the peak of the virus and that they would likely be lifted incrementally.</p>

<p>Speaking at the government‚Äôs daily press conference, Dr Harries confirmed the government would undertake reviews of the UK‚Äôs regulations on contact between strangers every three weeks ‚Äúprobably over the next six months.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is plausible that it could go further than that,‚Äù she added.

<h3 id="uk-pm-boris-johnsons-adviser-dominic-cummings-isolating-with-coronavirus-symptoms">UK PM Boris Johnson&rsquo;s adviser Dominic Cummings isolating with coronavirus symptoms</h3>
<p><img src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202003/UKleader_1-647x363.jpeg?CPnKE9qyx.SD0wCoD_YoS_58dbd09uUs" alt="img">
Dominic Cummings, special adviser for Britain&rsquo;s Prime Minister Boris Johnson, leaves his home, as the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues, in London, Britain, March 23, 2020. REUTERS</p>
<p>The coronavirus outbreak at the heart of the UK government spread on Monday with Prime Minister Boris Johnson&rsquo;s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, self-isolating with symptoms just days after the British leader himself tested positive.</p>
<p>A Downing Street spokesman said Cummings, one of the most powerful men in the government, had developed symptoms of COVID-19 over the weekend and was staying at home.</p>
<p>Johnson on Friday became the first leader of a major world power to announce he had tested positive for the virus. His health minister, Matt Hancock, also tested positive and the government&rsquo;s chief medical adviser, Chris Whitty, is self-isolating.</p>
<p>The spokesman said Johnson was working from his finance minister&rsquo;s office in Number 11 Downing Street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is chairing the daily meetings using video conferencing facilities, he&rsquo;s working from the Chancellor&rsquo;s office, he has been able to do everything that he needs to do lead the coronavirus response,&rdquo; the spokesman told reporters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can confirm that Dom (Cummings) is not in Number 10 today and that he is self-isolating after developing symptoms over the weekend,&rdquo; the spokesman said. The spokesman was not able to confirm if Cummings was still working, but said he had not been tested for the virus and was not expected to be.</p>
<p>Cummings was seen sprinting out of Downing Street shortly after Johnson revealed he had tested positive. Downing Street did not respond to a request for comment on the adviser&rsquo;s rapid departure.</p>
<p>Last week, Cummings denied a newspaper report which said he had prioritised herd immunity and the economy in the coronavirus crisis at the expense of pensioners dying.</p>
<p>Britain initially took a modest approach to containing the spread of the disease compared to Italy and France.</p>
<p>But Johnson imposed stringent controls after projections showed a quarter of a million people could die. He is now self-isolating.</p>
<p>Scientists say the virus&rsquo;s incubation period is estimated at between one and 14 days, and there have been anecdotal accounts of people spreading the disease without having symptoms.</p>
<p>The spokesman said Downing Street had drafted in experienced former staffers, including Isaac Levido who helped mastermind Johnson&rsquo;s election campaign, to help with work to fight the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Besides meetings in Downing Street, Johnson ventured beyond Downing Street last week. On Wednesday, a day before his positive test, Johnson answered questions at a weekly session in parliament&rsquo;s House of Commons chamber.</p>
<p>Johnson also spoke with several lawmakers. Minister for Scotland Alister Jack, who sat next to Johnson before the session, said on Saturday he had developed a temperature and a cough and was now working from home in isolation.</p>
<p>Health officials said on Sunday that figures showed that 1,228 patients in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) had died.</p>
<p>As of 0800 GMT on March 29, a total of 127,737 people in the UK have been tested, of whom 108,215 were confirmed negative and 19,522 were confirmed positive.</p>
