MK Gabi Ashkenazi of the Blue and White party says the coalition deal with the Likud is “the right thing to do.”</p>
<p>Asked if he is “satisfied” with the deal on a Channel 12 interview, Ashkenazi responds: “It’s not about being satisfied, it’s about doing the right thing.”</p>
<p>“I am convinced that – given the reality – it was the right things to do,” he says. Coalitions deals have a price, he explains.</p>
<p>“A responsible leadership cannot ignore the reality,” he goes on. “We said we wouldn’t sit alongside Netanyahu but we didn’t get the mandate to replace him.”</p>
<p>Ashkenazi understands “the disappointment” of the party’s voters but says he hopes “to convince them that this was the right decision.</p>
<p>Pushed on clauses of the deal that aim to protect Netanyahu from High Court intervention to bar him as prime minister or “alternate” prime minister because of the indictments against him, Ashkenazi says “there is nothing in the deal to circumvent the High Court.”</p>
<p>He says Blue and White will not fill all of the numerous ministries promised to it in the deal — which provides for a government of 32 ministers, rising to 36 — and won’t take all the promised deputy ministries either. (The deal provides for 16 deputy ministers in all.) He says Gantz has made clear he does not want the official residence promised to the alternate prime minister.</p>
<p>Asked about his former ally Yair Lapid’s allegations that Gantz, Ashkenazi and their colleagues betrayed their voters, and surrendered to Netanyahu and to ultra-Orthodox coercion, he says he respects Lapid and won’t get dragged into an exchange of allegations with him.</p>
<p>In a Channel 13 interview, Moshe Ya’alon, another former colleague of Gantz and Ashkenazi, says the Blue and White leaders “were reduced to dishrags, I’m sorry to say,” in the coalition negotiations with Netanyahu.

<h3 id="principals-call-for-detailed-guidance-over-leaving-cert">Principals call for detailed guidance over Leaving Cert</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.rasset.ie/0013ee28-1600.jpg" alt="img">
School principals are calling for detailed guidance on how the Leaving Certificate examinations are going to be managed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Minister for Education Joe McHugh announced the delayed Leaving Cert exams will commence on 29 July.</p>
<p>Speaking on RTÉ&rsquo;s Today with Sean O’Rourke, the Principal St Patrick&rsquo;s Classical School in Navan, Colm O’Rourke, has said it is &ldquo;unsatisfactory&rdquo; that schools have received no information from the State Examinations Commission, or the Department of Education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have not heard a word from the State Examinations Commission, or the Department of Education, all we have learned so far, has been learned from what we have heard in the media. That is quite unsatisfactory,&rdquo; Mr O’Rourke said.</p>
<p>He said Minister McHugh has been too quick to make announcements in relation to the Leaving Cert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has been no clarity on how this is going to work. Making an announcement on Good Friday was silly. There has been too much attention paid to social media by ministers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the same programme the Principal of Fingal Community College, Sharon McGrath, called for guidance on how to manage the logistics of assessments.</p>
<p>She welcomed yesterday&rsquo;s clarification that the Leaving Cert was to go ahead on 29 July, but she said there are &ldquo;significant difficulties in ensuring the safety of students&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not all schools are facing the same issues of trying to ensure that students can social distance. Teachers are rolling up their sleeves and are extremely willing, but I am struggling to see the way. We need guidance logistically on how we manage this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The organising of written papers &ldquo;are the least of our worries&rdquo;, as she said there are &ldquo;significant concerns around the administration and assessment of practical exams and projects&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mr O&rsquo;Rourke agreed that the sitting of exams is &ldquo;much easier&rdquo; than the proposal by the Minister that students may be able to return to school for two weeks of classes before the exams commence, which Mr O&rsquo;Rourke said would cause &ldquo;massive problems&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He also called for clarity for teachers about &ldquo;what work they will be expected to do, when the school year would reopen, if they&rsquo;re going have any holidays at all if they&rsquo;re expected to work online with Leaving students in June&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Earlier, also on the same programme, Aodhán O Ríordáin, Labour Party Spokesperson on Education, said the situation for disadvantaged students and those with additional needs still needed to be looked at.</p>
<p>He also said that he can&rsquo;t understand why Minister McHugh is refusing to cancel the exam fee of €160, describing it as &ldquo;unreasonable&rdquo;.

<h3 id="mchugh-leaving-cert-could-potentially-start-29-july">McHugh: Leaving Cert could &lsquo;potentially&rsquo; start 29 July</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.rasset.ie/00142e08-1600.jpg" alt="img">
The Minister for Education has said that this year&rsquo;s Leaving Certificate exams will &ldquo;potentially&rdquo; begin on 29 July.</p>
<p>Speaking on an Instagram Live chat organised by youth organisation Spunout.ie, Joe McHugh said that his department was looking at starting the exams on a Wednesday, as is tradition, and his department was looking at 29 July. He said he would be confirming this date in a couple of days&rsquo; time.</p>
<p>Spunout.ie said it received a &ldquo;phenomenal&rdquo; 1,300 emails from students with questions they wanted put to the minister.</p>
<p>The organisation said that &ldquo;by far and away&rdquo; the most common question related to why the Department of Education had not opted to cancel the exams in favour of using predicted grades. Four hundred students asked this question, according to Spunout.ie.</p>
<p>Mr McHugh said the department had looked at predicted grades, but had decided against them because there were &ldquo;so many issues&rdquo;. He said the advice they had received was that such a mechanism would be less fair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we don&rsquo;t have a standardised continuous assessment system, we felt that fairness would not have been at the heart of it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Citing examples of teachers who may be faced with predicting marks for nieces, nephews, next door neighbours, or even their own sons or daughters, the minister said there was &ldquo;too much inherent bias&rdquo; in a predicted grades approach.</p>
<p>He said while some teachers may be &ldquo;hard markers&rdquo;, another may be an &ldquo;easy marker&rdquo;, and that students who might subsequently miss out on a third level course because of their points may blame the predicted grades that they received.</p>
<p>Mr McHugh said that details as to the actual structure of the exams and the timetable would be announced in the first week of June.</p>
<p>He said the overall public health picture would have to be taken into account.</p>
<p>This may have an impact on the duration of individual exams. Citing current public health advice that two hours is the maximum limit for people to congregate, &ldquo;that would have an impact on the length of the papers&rdquo;, he said, if that advice, for example, was still current when the exams do take place.</p>
<p>Asked about the impact of the digital divide on students, the minister said he would announcing details shortly on an ICT support programme to help those affected. He said work was also being done on a wellbeing programme for students.</p>
<p>Mr McHugh said it would be late October before first years begin college this year. He said he understood unhappiness with the postponement of the Leaving Cert exams and said he was sorry that it had to be this way.
