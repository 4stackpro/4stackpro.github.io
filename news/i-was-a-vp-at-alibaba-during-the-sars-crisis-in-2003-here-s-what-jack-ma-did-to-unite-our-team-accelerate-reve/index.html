Porter Erisman was working in China as vice president of the Alibaba Group in 2003 when the SARS pandemic struck, and he and 400 colleagues were quarantined at home.</p>
<p>But instead of being paralyzed by fear and panic, Alibaba thrived during the SARS crisis: Their team became more united, revenues accelerated, and they launched a new business, Taobao.</p>
<p>The lessons of how Alibaba weathered the storm can offer guidance to entrepreneurs who are facing similar challenges during the COVID-19 crisis today.</p>
<p>Accept your new reality, don&rsquo;t delay tough decisions, and keep the team united, advises Erisman — and above all, keep your employees safe.</p>
<p>This article is part of Business Insider&rsquo;s ongoing series on Better Capitalism.</p>
<p>Visit Business Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>In spring of 2003, while I was working as a vice president at the Hangzhou, China headquarters of Alibaba Group, I received an unexpected phone call from the company&rsquo;s HR head. &ldquo;Porter, you don&rsquo;t need to come to work tomorrow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You and the rest of the colleagues in our headquarters are being quarantined for exposure to SARS.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It turned out that a colleague I had worked alongside at a trade show in Guangzhou — the SARS epicenter — had been hospitalized upon returning from our business trip and was showing symptoms of SARS. The next morning, the door to my home was chained shut, a guard was stationed in my apartment building lobby, and I and 400 Alibaba colleagues were forced to run the company from our homes for 10 days.</p>
<p>Our first concern was for the health of our colleagues and families. But our next concern was for the survival of our company. It was a crisis which, if handled poorly, could have destroyed Alibaba. At the time, I wondered how we&rsquo;d respond to the challenge. Would business dry up as our customers lost money? With everyone quarantined at home with their families, would the team be distracted and spin out of control?</p>
<p>While it would have been easy to be paralyzed by fear and panic, instead, Alibaba not only survived, but thrived during the SARS crisis. Our team emerged stronger and more united than ever. Our revenues accelerated. And we launched a new business — Taobao — which went on to become the most valuable business unit of Alibaba&rsquo;s vast $400 billion+ e-commerce empire. And fortunately, everyone in the company — including the suspected SARS victim — emerged healthy.</p>
<p>My hope is that the lessons of how Alibaba survived the SARS crisis can provide inspiration to entrepreneurs who are facing similar challenges today. There is no doubt that, economically, some of the hardest-hit victims of coronavirus will be entrepreneurs, small businesses and their employees. But when this crisis passes, it will also be these entrepreneurs and their teams who will need to rebuild their companies and economies around the world. With that in mind, here are the five lessons I learned from how Alibaba survived — and thrived — during the SARS crisis.

<h3 id="alibaba-suffers-culture-conflicts">Alibaba suffers culture conflicts</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.japantimes.2xx.jp/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2020-03-22T111335Z_1972363052_RC2ZOF9TNJI0_RTRMADP_5_HEALTH-COR-870x557.jpg" alt="img">
At Lazada, the Southeast Asian arm of Alibaba Group Holding, staffers are furious over demands that they submit health reports daily and other coronavirus-prevention steps seen as too invasive, highlighting a long-running culture clash with management from China.</p>
<p>Since February, Singapore-based Lazada has asked all employees to answer detailed questions seven days a week about their health and where they have been lately, according to five people with direct knowledge of the matter.</p>
<p>While the e-commerce firm describes the health reports as not mandatory, employees receive frequent calls from human resources, even on weekends, to make sure reports are submitted, the people said.</p>
<p>Lazada has also asked Singapore employees to wear masks at work, contrary to guidance from authorities, and has also considered urging employees to refrain from attending religious gatherings, they said.</p>
<p>The five employees, who said staff anger was widespread, detailed the measures on condition of anonymity because they fear retribution. Three showed a reporter a copy of a health report they had submitted.</p>
<p>Such measures are not unusual in China, which has imposed draconian rules to contain the virus. But they are seen as a huge invasion of privacy by many Lazada staffers in countries that include Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand.</p>
<p>The conflict illustrates how Alibaba’s business practices have sometimes played poorly abroad and hindered its overseas ambitions. It also shows how tensions can emerge within global companies as they struggle with the virus crisis.</p>
<p>“How does the company use the information gathered daily? Nobody is able to explain,” said one of the employees, expressing concern that Lazada might pass on the information to governments.</p>
<p>Lazada Group Chief Strategy Officer Magnus Ekbom denied there were issues with staff unhappiness over the measures.</p>
<p>“Lazada has a clear top priority to safeguard the well-being of our team and the community around us,” he said in a statement. “Our approach is in line with the recommendations made by the various governments in nations we operate in.”</p>
<p>Sources also say this is just the latest chapter in Alibaba’s struggles to manage Lazada, a company it owns 90 percent of after investing $3 billion since 2016 and where morale has been rapidly declining.</p>
<p>Once the top e-commerce firm in Southeast Asia when Alibaba first invested, Lazada has now fallen behind rivals in a fast-growing market of 650 million Southeast Asia consumers across six countries, according to market researchers.</p>
<p>Underlining management woes have been the quick departures of Alibaba executives dispatched to Lazada, with the latest co-president of the unit leaving in January after less than 18 months.</p>
<p>“Some Alibaba executives sent to Lazada have the natural tendency of pushing things the Alibaba way because it proved right in China,” said Jianggan Li, the founder of the Singapore-based tech investment firm Momentum Works.</p>
<p>“Many tend not to have enough respect for the market and patience to understand the market deeply,” he said, adding that Alibaba’s international efforts are still in their early days and the tech giant probably has the determination to learn from mistakes.</p>
<p>Alibaba declined to comment on issues at Lazada for this article.</p>
<p>The sources said many employees had raised their concerns to managers via meetings, emails and messages on DingTalk, an app developed by Alibaba that enables managers to keep constant tabs on staffers.</p>
<p>The request that employees at Singapore headquarters wear masks resulted in many queries because it runs counter to guidance from Singapore authorities who recommend masks only if feeling unwell.</p>
<p>“People are confused. If they think working in the office is that dangerous, they should’ve asked us to work from home,” one employee said.</p>
<p>There were also suggestions from Chinese managers about asking employees to reduce social activities, including religious gatherings, though those steps were not implemented in the face of employee resistance.</p>
<p>The pushback has resulted in some changes because some countries where Lazada operates, such as the Philippines, have stricter privacy laws than China. On March 10, Lazada added a paragraph on privacy protection to the terms of its health check-in program.</p>
<p>“All personal data collected from the daily health check-in program shall be processed in accordance with the local data privacy laws,” said an updated version.</p>
<p>According to sources, senior Lazada executives from China have often been quick to impose what has worked for the mainland Chinese market with little regard to local needs or sensitivities in Southeast Asia’s fragmented markets.</p>
<p>Some failed strategies include temporary halts to free shipping in some markets, a decision that drove merchants to other sites, and attempts to promote bulk buying, the sources said. They added that these mistakes and a tendency for China executives to have key discussions without local input have taken their toll on Lazada’s business performance and on morale.</p>
<p>At the job search website Glassdoor, anonymous employee reviews are mostly very critical. Among those that were positive, several said they were writing at the explicit request of Lazada CEO Pierre Poignant, who asked employees in a town hall meeting to write glowing reviews.</p>
<p>E-commerce in the region was worth $38 billion last year and is expected to grow rapidly, according to a study by Google, Temasek and Bain &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Alibaba does not break out Lazada’s financial performance or disclose market share, but market researchers say Lazada now lags behind Singapore-based Shopee, which is backed by Alibaba archrival Tencent Holdings Ltd.</p>
<p>Shopee was the most downloaded e-commerce app and the most used in the region as of the end of last year, knocking Lazada to second place, according to the research firm iPrice. Shopee’s website also attracts more visitors than Lazada’s, iPrice said.</p>
<p>In Indonesia, the region’s biggest economy, Lazada trails Shopee and the homegrown marketplace Tokopedia, analysts add.</p>
<p>Lazada disputed the market share assessment. “Lazada has the largest active consumer base in Southeast Asia and continues to gain market share,” said the statement by Ekbom.</p>
<p>According to three of the sources, executives from China often do not last long.</p>
<p>One former Lazada co-president, Jing Yin, quietly left in January and returned to Alibaba’s headquarters in Hangzhou, the people said. Others include the head of Lazada’s product team, Jin Luyao, who also returned to Hangzhou in January after less than 18 months; the CEO of the Vietnam unit, Max Zhang, returned in mid-2019 after spending little more than a year in Ho Chi Minh City.</p>
<p>Prior to that, Lucy Peng, one of Alibaba’s co-founders, stepped down as Lazada CEO in 2018 after just nine months, although she remains executive chairwoman.</p>
<p>Alibaba veteran Jessica Liu has replaced Jing. People who have attended meetings with her said she is smart and understands e-commerce well but her English is limited. That has added to concerns that Alibaba doesn’t understand Southeast Asia, where English is the dominant language for international business, they said.</p>
<p>Lazada and Alibaba declined to make Liu available for comment. Efforts to reach Liu and the other executives by email and Linkedin were not successful.</p>
<p>The clashes and history of departures have left Alibaba employees wary of coming to the Southeast Asian unit.</p>
<p>“Many people in Hangzhou now see Lazada as a career black hole,” one of the sources said.

<h3 id="the-sars-epidemic-threatened-alibabas-survival-in-2003heres-how-it-made-it-through-to-become-a-470-billion-company">The SARS epidemic threatened Alibaba&rsquo;s survival in 2003—here&rsquo;s how it made it through to become a $470 billion company</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104207483-GettyImages-455702448.jpg?v=1536938389" alt="img">
Chinese online retail giant Alibaba CEO Jack Ma (C) waves as he arrives at the New York Stock Exchange in New York on September 19, 2014.</p>
<p>As novel coronavirus COVID-19 wreaks havoc on the global economy, Alibaba finds itself in a familiar position. In a quarterly earnings call in February, Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang said the economic effects of COVID-19 &ldquo;will present near-term challenges&rdquo; to Alibaba&rsquo;s business, &ldquo;but at the same time, we will see opportunities created by the forces of change.&rdquo; Of course, Zhang also focused on Alibaba&rsquo;s &ldquo;responsibility to our community,&rdquo; saying the company &ldquo;took every effort to protect the health and safety of our employees.&rdquo; (The Alibaba Foundation and the Jack Ma Foundation have both donated medical supplies around the world.) But even in a dire situation, Alibaba can see opportunity, not only because people are now more reliant than ever on online services, but also because it was in fact another epidemic — that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (or SARS, which is also a kind of coronavirus) — that put the company on its path to becoming a $470 billion e-commerce behemoth.</p>
<p>A pandemic in China</p>
<p>Alibaba was founded in 1999 as an online, B2B marketplace aimed at Chinese firms looking to sell their goods to other businesses around the world. Three years later, the company had just 400 employees (today it has over 100,000), and turned its first annual profit in 2002. But in the fall of that year, a then-novel coronavirus outbreak began to take hold in southern China. SARS, also known as SARS-associated coronavirus, or SARS-CoV, would soon spread across the country and the world. As SARS turned into a pandemic in 2003, it presented a major challenge to China&rsquo;s economy — including Alibaba&rsquo;s nascent business — as the country&rsquo;s manufacturing sector suffered from factory closures, with workers staying home, while retail sales also dropped significantly with consumers reluctant to venture out to stores. Then in May 2003, an Alibaba employee contracted SARS (she would ultimately survive). The company was forced to quarantine its entire staff in their homes. It seemed at the time that disaster had struck the young business. The quarantine came just as Alibaba was preparing to launch Taobao, an online marketplace for consumers that Ma hoped would compete with eBay in China.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When SARS happened, it was a big hit for the company because we didn&rsquo;t know if our business will actually be around tomorrow. There were so many uncertainties,&rdquo; Annie Xu, who has worked at Alibaba since 2000 and is currently the head of human resources in North America, said in 2019. The SARS outbreak appeared to be hitting Alibaba at the worst possible time, threatening to halt the young company&rsquo;s early growth and delay the launch of Taobao. However, what looked like a worst-case scenario turned out to have a silver lining.</p>
<p>A dire situation becomes a watershed moment</p>
<p>First, Ma&rsquo;s decision to send his workers home helped prevent the spread of the disease at Alibaba, and the company founder encouraged his staff to take their work with them. Workers took their desktop computers home to ensure Alibaba&rsquo;s business-to-business e-commerce platform remained up and running. Employees worked 12-hour days, with the company&rsquo;s customer service hotline redirecting to workers&rsquo; homes during the quarantine.
