Former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola has been at Manchester City since 2016</p>
<p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola&rsquo;s mother, Dolors Sala Carrio, has died aged 82 in Barcelona after contracting coronavirus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone associated with the club sends their most heartfelt sympathy at this most distressing time to Pep, his family and all their friends,&rdquo; said Manchester City on social media.</p>
<p>Monday&rsquo;s increase of 637 coronavirus deaths means 13,055 have died in Spain.</p>
<p>Last month, Guardiola donated 1m euros (£920,000) to help fight the outbreak.</p>
<p>The money will be used to purchase medical equipment and protective material for staff involved in treating those admitted to hospital.</p>
<p>Barcelona is in Catalonia, which is one of the areas in Spain with the most concentrated number of cases.</p>
<p>Manchester United posted on social media to say the club was &ldquo;saddened to hear this terrible news&rdquo;, adding: &ldquo;We send our heartfelt condolences to Pep and his family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spaniard Guardiola, 49, has been in charge of Manchester City since July 2016 after spells as manager of Barcelona and Bayern Munich.</p>
<p>La Liga side Barcelona posted on Twitter: &ldquo;We are deeply saddened by the loss of Dolors Sala during this difficult time, and we would like to express our most heartfelt condolences, especially to Pep Guardiola, his family and his friends.&rdquo;

<p>Ian Holloway says he would be looking to get rid of disgraced Manchester City star Kyle Walker if he was Pep Guardiola after the right-back broke coronavirus lockdown rules to host a sex party last Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Sun revealed on Sunday that Walker and his friend flouted the UK government’s strict measures by inviting two escorts to his flat. Just hours earlier, the 29-year-old had urged his Twitter followers to stay indoors amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>Walker has since apologised and is set to be fined two weeks’ wages by City. To add to this, the defender’s international future is in serious doubt, with England head coach Gareth Southgate said to be furious with his behaviour.</p>

<p>Not long after Walker’s apology, it emerged that Guardiola had lost his mother, Dolors Sala Carrio, to the virus and messages of support flooded in for the City manager from around the footballing world.</p>

<p>Former Crystal Palace and QPR boss Holloway, now in charge at Grimsby, has urged Guardiola to come down hard on Walker after the full-back’s ‘brainless’ actions.</p>
<p>‘First off I’d like to send my love and best wishes to Pep as he’s lost his mum,’ Holloway told talkSPORT.</p>
<p>‘The reality of that and then you have one of your players… it’s almost brainless.</p>
<p>‘What on earth are you doing having a party like that? It’s bang out of order.</p>
<p>‘I’d be looking to get him out of the club, that’s not right and it’s so irresponsible.’</p>
<p>Asked whether it should be the end of Walker’s England career, Holloway added: ‘Totally. It beggars belief.</p>
<p>‘Where’s the discipline? Where’s the actual discipline?’</p>

<p>A few days prior to his mother’s death, Guardiola pleaded with supporters to remain indoors and follow the government’s guidelines as City launched a ‘Cityzens At Home’ website for their fanbase during the lockdown.</p>

<p>‘We miss football. We miss the life that we had a few days ago but now is the time to listen, to follow our scientists, doctors and nurses,’ the Spaniard said.</p>
<p>‘You are my football family and we are going to do everything possible to make you feel better.</p>
<p>‘We’ll come back from this stronger, better, kinder… and a little bit fatter. Stay inside, stay safe.’</p>

<h3 id="kevin-campbell-explains-how-arsenal-boss-mikel-arteta-can-emulate-pep-guardiola">Kevin Campbell explains how Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta can emulate Pep Guardiola</h3>

Arteta has had a good start to life in management at Arsenal (Picture: Getty Images)</p>
<p>Ex-Arsenal striker Kevin Campbell has explained how Mikel Arteta can reproduce Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola’s successful philosophy at the Emirates Stadium.</p>
<p>Arteta, 38, spent three years as Guardiola’s assistant coach at City, taking notes as they won back-to-back Premier League titles for the first time in the club’s history.</p>
<p>The Spaniard has clearly picked up some good habits from his former colleague, winning six and losing just two of his opening 13 games as Gunners manager.</p>
<p>However, the former Everton midfielder’s playing style in his first foray into management has been more pragmatic than free-flowing.</p>
<p>Ex-Arsenal striker Kevin Campbell admitted Arteta still has a lot of work to do to match his old mentor, telling the Chronicles of a Gooner podcast: ‘Everybody thinks Pep Guardiola’s system is attack, attack, attack.</p>
<p>‘Pep Guardiola’s system is work hard, graft and press the ball. Once you can do that you can play all the pretty football you like because you wear teams out.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>‘You have to, 1: Be extra fit, 2: Have the buy-in from the players in order to do it, and 3: This is probably the most important thing, you have to have the right players.’</p>

<p>‘Unfortunately, Mikel Arteta this season is our third manager, so it may take a bit longer because now I think we’ve got the right manager, but now we have to get the right players in.</p>
<p>‘I don’t think we’ve got the right players in our system to play the way Mikel Arteta wants.’</p>
<p>The Gunners have been notably more solid under Arteta compared to former boss Unai Emery, and remain the only side not to lose a Premier League game in 2020.</p>
<p>Campbell admitted the defence will be even stronger when 19-year-old William Saliba arrives from his season-long loan spell at Saint-Etienne next season.</p>
<p>He added: ‘At least we’ve got a centre half, big, strong, quick, centre half who is going to go straight into that side, he has to.</p>
<p>‘If we can get Saliba in and bed him in nicely then at least the defence is a lot younger and is a lot stronger.’</p>
