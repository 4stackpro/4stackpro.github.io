<p>TV favourite&rsquo;s Laura Whitmore and Iain Stirling began dating following months of flirting back and forth on social media.</p>
<p>The pair were friends before turning things romantic.</p>
<p>After much speculation about the nature of their romance, Laura officially confirmed the news in the summer of 2017 as she revealed that they were dating.</p>
<p>At the time, she said: &ldquo;Yeah he’s my boyfriend. He’s lovely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I’ve got him as my screensaver. I’ve known him for ages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura, who hails from County Wicklow, later revealed that it was she who asked him out because he was too nervous to make the first move on her.</p>
<p>They messaged back and forth in their DM&rsquo;s before Laura offered to take him for a drink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we first met he didn’t even hit on me, he was too nervous to hit on me! I think he was intimidated by me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember Iain was too scared to ask me out so in the end I had to ask him out,&rdquo; she told JD&rsquo;s In The Duffle Bag podcast.</p>
<p>Swipe across below to see the full gallery of images</p>
<p>&ldquo;He used to send me random messages, DM me and ask me about my dog. It took nine months but we got there! I was like &lsquo;let’s just go for a drink&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I had to make the moves on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Iain is, of course, best known for his voice over work on ITV &lsquo;s Love Island.</p>
<p>Laura flew to Spain to visit him on set before she landed the role of show host following the departure from Caroline Flack from the role before Christmas.</p>
<p>Laura opens up about her relationship with Iain on their one year anniversary, revealing she visited him while filming Love Island in 2017. &ldquo;We tried to keep it as quiet as possible at the beginning,&rdquo; she told Fabulous. &ldquo;I remember going to Majorca last year and not telling anyone, even though I know most of the crew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If anyone had seen me they’d be like, ‘What the hell is Laura doing here?’ I thought nobody knew, but it turned out everyone did. At the time I was like, ‘We totally got away with that’.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We’d been together for four or five months before we put anything on our social media. I think at that point we were both like, ‘Should we just own it?’And then once you put it out there, no one gives a s**t. People only care when they don’t know something.&rdquo;
