Keanu Reeves may be the internet’s boyfriend, but could his famed John Wick character have his eyes on a boyfriend of his own? What if his path crossed with that of Daniel Craig’s 007? James Bond never seems to be able to nab a single Bond Girl anyway – maybe he needs a Bond Man in his life? Sure it&rsquo;s a far-fetched scenario in the grand scheme of things, but it’s also the concept of this incredible video depicting James Bond and John Wick in a cute rom-com in between their typical death-defying action.

<h3 id="john-wicks-entire-backstory-explained">John Wick&rsquo;s entire backstory explained</h3>
<p><img src="https://img3.looper.com/img/gallery/john-wicks-entire-backstory-explained/intro-1584991161.jpg" alt="img">
At the heart of this action franchise is an operatic love story that ends in tragedy. John falls in love with Helen (Bridget Moynahan) and knows he has no choice but to get out of the assassin game. When he approaches Viggo Tarasov about retiring, Viggo first laughs at him. But once Viggo realizes John is serious, he seizes the moment to take full advantage of John&rsquo;s new vulnerability. Viggo tasks John with killing all of his rival leaders in one night, an event that needs to happen fast to avoid retaliation. The Tarasov family doesn&rsquo;t have a seat at the High Table, so it&rsquo;s possible this was an attempt to show force and win one.</p>
<p>While John does as he was tasked, coldly dispatching each target, he unfortunately isn&rsquo;t able to do this one alone; he gives his blood oath marker to the son of the head of the Rome Syndicate, Santino D&rsquo;Antonio, for tactical assistance. This will prove to be one of the biggest mistakes of John Wick&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Still, John gets to spend five years with his beloved Helen before she gets cancer and dies, shattering him in a way that he&rsquo;d never been broken before. She was his anchor in the real world outside of the assassin game. What we would he do with her gone? As a last gift, Helen leaves John a puppy named Daisy, someone new for him to take care of and to help him remember his humanity and all the love he has in his heart.

<h3 id="episode-3-is-the-star-wars-version-of-john-wick">Episode 3 is the Star Wars version of John Wick</h3>
<p><img src="https://cryptodictation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1585387353_the-mandalorian-staffel-1-folge-3-recap.jpg" alt="img">
Last ran Pedro Pascals Mandalorians chased a sand crawler while Baby Yoda demonstrated his remarkable power skills for the first time. A exciting and exciting 2nd episode of The Mandalorianwho saw the Star Wars universe as an adventure playground and let off steam in the dusty desert to their hearts&rsquo; content. Ultimately, however, the story as a whole was only partially advanced.</p>
<p>Here you can Disney + subscription to lock. It is an affiliate link. Your Moviepilot supports you by completing a subscription via this link. This has no effect on the price.</p>
<p>With the 3rd episode of The Mandalorian, namely the mistake, that changes. The bounty hunter returns to the volcanic planet Nevarro to give the child to the client (Werner Herzog) to deliver. The following crystallizes:</p>
<p>Similar to Star Wars The Clone Wars the series follows several small story arcs that lead to a mini-finale after two or three episodes.</p>
<p>Star Wars meets John Wick: Three observations for the third episode of The MandalorianBaby Yoda makes even the most silent bounty hunter in the galaxy weak. He cannot possibly leave the little creature to the client.</p>
<p>The Mandalorian then finds himself in the crossfire of his former colleagues and the series mutates to the Star Wars version of John Wick: Chapter 3.</p>
<p>For the first time in Star Wars history, takes away Deborah Chow a woman in the live action director&rsquo;s seat. She will also stage the Obi-Wan Kenobi series.</p>
<p>© Disney</p>
<p>The Mandalorian</p>
<p>Surprised the last episode of The Mandalorian with a headstrong humor, the third chapter takes you straight back to the bold place where the Mandalorian got his job at the beginning of the story. Nevarro is a grim setting and atmospherically very reminiscent of the hypothermic places that Gareth Edwards with cameraman Greig Fraser in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story discovered.</p>
<p>Baby Yoda is too innocent for the dark Star Wars world</p>
<p>Together with Barry Baz Idoine Greig Fraser is also responsible for the camera work at The Mandalorian – and this can be felt in every shot of the series, especially when the surroundings are composed of bluish-gray tones. But there can be little talk of beauty, because this is actually a nasty, hostile world in which the next shady figure is waiting around every corner.</p>
<p>The situation is all the more interesting when the Mando and Baby Yoda march into the settlement, while the unequal duo – like in a Western – reaps suspicious looks from the left and right. Baby Yoda may be 50 years old. The fact that mainly a doll was used during the shooting makes it not only tangible and real, but also particularly fragile.</p>
<p>© Disney</p>
<p>The Mandalorian</p>
<p>Werner Herzog described Baby Yoda as “heartbreakingly beautiful” at the premiere of The Mandalorian. In the third episode, the villain embodied by him can&rsquo;t wait to finally get his hands on the adorable creature. The no less scary Dr. Pershing is currently preparing his Frankenstein experiments. He hardly wants to examine Baby Yoda&rsquo;s Midi-Chlorian values.</p>
<p>The Mandalorian flies out of the bounty hunter guild</p>
<p>The big secret about Baby Yoda is not explained in the third episode. Series creator and screenwriter Jon Favreau is careful not to disclose too much information and instead lets Deborah Chow&rsquo;s production speak. As soon as the Mandalorian has torn the gatekeeper droid out of its anchorage, the episode scores with one action scene after the other. From then on, every bounty hunter pounced on the excommunicated Mando à la John Wick.</p>
<p>While it was a great attraction at the start of the series to experience an IG unit in motion in a live-action film for the first time, the third episode brought us an entire army of Mandalorians to help the title hero in a big battle rush. They take to the skies with jetpacks, and flamethrowers are also used extensively: Please let off steam in the Star Wars weapon pool!</p>
<p>© Disney</p>
<p>The Mandalorian</p>
<p>On the one hand, it&rsquo;s great to experience many of these moments that are dedicated to the design and aesthetics of the Star Wars universe. At the same time, the focus, for example, on the armor of the Mandalorian turns out to be a half-baked element in the plot. As in a video game, the protagonist can look at the</p>
<p>Weapon master (Emily Swallow) pick up an upgrade to reach the next level.</p>
<p>The hero&rsquo;s posture reveals more than any flashback</p>
<p>Again, the corresponding scene is merged with the flashback, which once took you back to the Mandalorian&rsquo;s past. An exciting idea in itself: While the armor is being repaired on the outside, the inner wounds of the otherwise taciturn hero are revealed. Contrary to the great ideas that drive this montage, the implementation turns out to be an uninspired deepening of character.</p>
<p>More meaningful is the posture of the Mandalorian, who falls and stumbles, but always gets up. Sometimes he looks like a professional, sometimes he drags himself through the battle: Pedro Pascal and his doubles, Brendan Wayne and Lateef Crowder, have skilfully coordinated themselves to create a feeling for the figure by walking alone, even if they prefer to sit silently in the cockpit of the Razor Crest.</p>
<p>© Disney</p>
<p>The Mandalorian</p>
<p>After three episodes, it feels like we&rsquo;re at the end of Season 1 first act. The next chapter promises not only a change of direction, but also a change of location. In addition, The Mandalorian is now published every Friday on Disney + on a weekly basis. After the concentrated Mando charge in the first week, our recaps will adapt to this rhythm.</p>
<p>How did you like the new episode of The Mandalorian?
