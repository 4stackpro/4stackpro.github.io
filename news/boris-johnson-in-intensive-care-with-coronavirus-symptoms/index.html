London (CNN) UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was moved to an intensive care unit Monday after his condition with coronavirus symptoms &ldquo;worsened,&rdquo; his office has said.</p>
<p>Johnson, 55, had been admitted to St Thomas&rsquo; Hospital in London on Sunday evening for what he said were &ldquo;routine tests,&rdquo; adding that was in &ldquo;good spirits.&rdquo; Downing Street had insisted the hospitalization was a &quot; precautionary step .&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dramatic change in the leader&rsquo;s health has shocked the nation, with politicians from his party and the opposition voicing their support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the course of this afternoon, the condition of the Prime Minister has worsened and, on the advice of his medical team, he has been moved to the Intensive Care Unit at the hospital,&rdquo; a Downing Street spokesperson said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The PM has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is the First Secretary of State and the most senior Cabinet minister, to deputize for him where necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="how-sick-is-boris-johnson-britons-want-to-know">How sick is Boris Johnson? Britons want to know.</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/b0k0pGfGSzJPiM_YMpAsnM8TqEY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3LHVLLTYCAI6VIYRVWYTIRYZVE.jpg" alt="img">
“I want to thank everyone on the NHS [National Health Service] front line, as well as care workers and those carrying out essential roles, who selflessly continue their day-to-day duties outside the home in support of us all,” she said.</p>
<p>Minutes later, the country found out that those on the NHS front line were also caring for the prime minister, who had just been admitted to the hospital. Boris Johnson tested positive for coronavirus on March 27 and had been in self-isolation since.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>So much for the reassurance. The head of state gave a serene address. But the head of government was in the hospital.</p>
<p>While government officials had previously said Johnson’s symptoms were “mild,” they later dropped that word from their statements. [Update: British officials announced on Monday afternoon that the prime minister has been transferred to intensive care, which intensified concerns about the state of his health.]</p>
<p>A month ago, Johnson enthusiastically told the press that he had visited a hospital with coronavirus patients and “shook hands with everybody,” though it is likely he contracted the virus later.</p>
<p>Johnson’s admission to the hospital comes at the worst possible moment. Epidemiologists expect that Britain’s outbreak is likely to peak in a week to 10 days. The United Kingdom is currently on a path that mirrors Italy’s horrific death tolls, a harrowing prospect given that more than 700 people already died in Britain in a single day. Because the British population is one-fifth the size of the United States, that’s akin to 3,500 Americans dying daily — with more than a week of increases to go before the peak arrives.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The government is now facing harsher criticism after the honeymoon period that saw strong approval ratings for Johnson’s response to the crisis. In late March, 72 percent of Brits said the prime minister was doing either “well” or “very well” in handling the crisis. But now the government is under increased scrutiny as bodies mount, ventilator shortages loom and health-care workers are reporting shortages of personal protective equipment. Testing targets have repeatedly been missed. Messaging to the public has been confusing.</p>
<p>Still, even with a hospitalized prime minister and several sick senior government officials, the British government’s response has been far better than President Trump’s callous and narcissistic incompetence. British policy has been significantly more coordinated and decisive than Trump’s systematic downplaying of the threat and his clownish self-aggrandizing reality-TV-style news conferences. (And yes, it’s a low bar to clear.)</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the spread of the coronavirus through Westminster shows how the pandemic can sap a government at exactly the moment when energetic leadership is required. In addition to the prime minister, Health Secretary Matt Hancock tested positive for the coronavirus. (He has now returned to work.) The chief medical officer who is advising the government’s response, Chris Whitty, was forced into self-isolation after developing symptoms. Neil Ferguson, the author of the epidemiological modeling that prompted Johnson to institute a nationwide lockdown, has tested positive for the virus. And Dominic Cummings, Johnson’s controversial, Rasputin-like adviser, is in self-isolation after developing coronavirus-like symptoms.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The scale of the national emergency transcends politics. Partisanship doesn’t disappear — and rightly so — but everyone is rooting for the leader to do what is right and necessary to save lives. In a country that has been as divided as ever over Brexit, everyone now wants the same thing: to reduce the number of people who die preventable deaths from the coronavirus. To accomplish that goal, Britain needs a leader — a healthy leader — to rise to the challenge. It’s Johnson’s chance to be Churchillian.</p>
<p>But, as with Churchill, there are now whispers that Downing Street isn’t being fully transparent. In 1953, Churchill suffered a stroke, a secret that was hidden from the public even though he was the sitting prime minister. He served for two more years before anyone found out.</p>
<p>Transparency in the coming hours and days is crucial. Brits will understand and accept a temporary transfer of power if it is necessary. They will not accept being lied to or deceived during the country’s most deadly period in modern history. If Johnson is unable to fulfill his duties, his powers can temporarily pass to Dominic Raab, the first secretary of state and foreign secretary. So far, that decision has not been made, and Downing Street insists that Johnson is working from his hospital bed. But if Johnson’s condition worsens, power should be transferred.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>And in the meantime, all we can do is hope for Johnson to make a speedy recovery, as a jittery nation confined at home heeds the queen’s words:</p>
<p>“We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: We will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again.”

<h3 id="coronavirus-boris-johnson-admitted-to-hospital-over-virus-symptoms">Coronavirus: Boris Johnson admitted to hospital over virus symptoms</h3>

<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been admitted to hospital for tests, 10 days after testing positive for coronavirus, Downing Street has said.</p>
<p>He was taken to a London hospital on Sunday evening with &ldquo;persistent symptoms&rdquo; - including a temperature.</p>
<p>It is said to be a &ldquo;precautionary step&rdquo; taken on the advice of his doctor.</p>
<p>The prime minister remains in charge of the government, but the foreign secretary is expected to chair a coronavirus meeting on Monday morning.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson, 55, spent the night in hospital and is having what has been described as a series of &ldquo;routine tests&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In a statement, a Downing Street spokeswoman said: &ldquo;On the advice of his doctor, the prime minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a precautionary step, as the prime minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus 10 days after testing positive for the virus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She added: &ldquo;The prime minister thanks NHS staff for all of their incredible hard work and urges the public to continue to follow the government&rsquo;s advice to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump began a White House press briefing by sending &ldquo;our nation&rsquo;s well wishes&rdquo; for Mr Johnson&rsquo;s &ldquo;own personal fight with the virus&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All Americans are praying for him. He&rsquo;s a great friend of mine, a great gentleman and a great leader,&rdquo; Mr Trump said, adding that he was sure the prime minister would be fine because he is &ldquo;a strong person&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Labour leader Keir Starmer also wished Mr Johnson well, saying he hoped for a &ldquo;speedy recovery&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Coronavirus is straining the highest levels of government</p>
<p>The prime minister, alongside the Queen, personifies the country&rsquo;s public response to this pandemic.</p>
<p>And Boris Johnson is continuing to personally experience the unpleasant reality of the virus.</p>
<p>Downing Street officials are adamant Mr Johnson remains in charge of the government and is in contact with ministerial colleagues and civil servants.</p>
<p>But the undeniable reality is there is nothing conventional, nothing normal about this - however routine the tests are that the prime minister is receiving.</p>
<p>The coronavirus has repeatedly proven its capacity to turn the far-fetched into reality, over and over again.</p>
<p>Advisers, officials and ministerial colleagues have all been forced to self-isolate.</p>
<p>Covid-19, the illness which the virus causes, is crippling the economy, robbing us of our usual liberties - and now it is straining the personal capacity of those at the highest level of government to respond to it.</p>
<p>Dr Sarah Jarvis, a GP and broadcaster, told the BBC that Mr Johnson would be likely to have his chest X-rayed and his lungs scanned, particularly if he had been struggling for breath.</p>
<p>She said he is also likely to have an electrocardiogram to check his heart&rsquo;s function, as well as tests on his oxygen levels, white blood cell count, and liver and kidney function before he is released from hospital.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson has worked from home since it was announced that he had tested positive for coronavirus on 27 March.</p>
<p>He was last seen in public applauding the NHS and other key workers from his flat in Downing Street on Thursday evening, and chaired a coronavirus meeting remotely on Friday morning.</p>
<p>Also on Friday, the prime minister posted a Twitter video in which said he was still displaying minor symptoms.</p>
<p>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Boris Johnson posted a video message on Friday</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still have a temperature. So in accordance with government advice I must continue my self isolation until that symptom itself goes,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re working clearly the whole time on our programme to beat the virus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Saturday, his pregnant partner Carrie Symonds tweeted that she has spent a week in bed with the main symptoms.</p>
<p>She said she had not been tested for the virus.</p>
<p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock had also tested positive for the virus and returned from self-isolation on Thursday to host the daily Downing Street news conference.</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, has also had to self-isolate after showing symptoms.</p>
<p>Last month, the prime minister&rsquo;s spokesman said if the prime minister was unwell and unable to work, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, as the first secretary of state, would stand in.</p>
<p>The news of Mr Johnson&rsquo;s admission to hospital came shortly after the Queen delivered a rallying message to the nation, saying the UK &ldquo;will succeed&rdquo; in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>In a rare speech, the monarch thanked people for following government rules to stay at home and praised those &ldquo;coming together to help others&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In other developments:</p>
<p>On Sunday the Department of Health said 621 more people had died in hospital in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total death toll to 4,934.</p>
<p>As of 09:00 BST on Sunday, 47,806 people had tested positive for coronavirus, the department said.</p>
