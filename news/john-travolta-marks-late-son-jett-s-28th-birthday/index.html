John Travolta has paid tribute to his late son Jett on what would have been his 28th birthday.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Grease&rsquo; star and his wife Kelly Preston have publicly remembered their late son, who passed away in 2009 during a family trip to the Bahamas, when he hit his head on a bathtub after suffering a seizure at their home on Grand Bahama Island.</p>
<p>In a post on Instagram that featured a black and white photo of himself and Jett, the 66-year-old actor wrote: &lsquo;&lsquo;Happy Birthday Jetty! We love you! (sic)&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Following his post, several stars left comments showing their support, including Queen Latifa - who left a series of praying and heart emojis - and musician Tommy Lee, who commented with a purple heart emoji.</p>
<p>Olivia Newton John - who starred alongside John in &lsquo;Grease&rsquo; - also left a comment, which consisted of a praying emoji, a red heart, and a rainbow.</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s wife Kelly shared her own image of herself giving Jett a hug.</p>
<p>She wrote alongside it: &lsquo;&lsquo;Happy Birthday to our sweetest Jetty, we love you!! (sic)&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Both John and Kelly - who married in 1991 - tagged each other in their posts, as well as their 20-year-old daughter Ella, who shared her own post remembering her big brother.</p>
<p>She posted: &lsquo;&lsquo;Happy Birthday to my brother Jett, I love you so much (sic)&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The couple are also parents to nine-year-old son Benjamin, who was born just over a year after Jett&rsquo;s tragic passing.</p>
<p>John has previously credited Benjamin with helping to &lsquo;&lsquo;re-bond&rsquo;&rsquo; the family after the &lsquo;&lsquo;tremendous loss&rsquo;&rsquo; they suffered following Jett&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Pulp Fiction&rsquo; star said in 2016: &lsquo;&lsquo;We certainly have bonded together. Certainly, having little Ben has been a beautiful kind of glue for us to re-bond after a tremendous loss.&rsquo;&rsquo;

<p>Discussing his firstborn&rsquo;s tragic death, the Pulp Fiction star said it was the &ldquo;worst thing to happen&rdquo; to him.</p>
<p>He penned on social media: &ldquo;Someone you raised and watched grow every day. Someone you taught how to walk and talk. Someone you showed how to love. It&rsquo;s the worst thing to ever happen to anyone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He brought me so much joy. He was my everything. Those 16 years of being his father taught me how to love unconditionally.&rdquo;</p>
