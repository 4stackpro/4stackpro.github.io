<p>The highly influential 60’s Rhythm and Blues band The Pretty Things have today shared two new recordings in memory of their singer, Phil May, who sadly passed away last Friday at the age of 75. Our tribute to Phil May can be found HERE.</p>
<p>The two new recordings are taken from sessions made following The Pretty Things’ ‘Final Bow’ from live performances at London’s O2 Indigo in December 2018. Phil May, along with his fellow founding member and the band’s guitarist Dick Taylor, together with manager and producer Mark St. John, had already begun work on a new album, in an entirely acoustic format and in what was marked contrast to much of their previous work.</p>
<p>Those songs shared today are two cover versions: the first is ‘To Build A Wall’ written by rising British folk singer Will Varley with the second the band’s powerful interpretation of American singer-songwriter’s Gillian Welch’s classic tune ‘Devil Had A Hold On Me’.</p>

<h3 id="phil-ochs-the-doomed-folk-singer-who-woke-up-from-the-american-dream">&ldquo;Phil Ochs: the doomed folk singer who woke up from the American dream&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/478b7caf5117c9ea583a6ac947ef61c26ac5f642/0_0_3396_2038/master/3396.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=370477956df3a5c508aa4f0237b4e24e" alt="img">
As a kid in the 1950s, Phil Ochs cut class and spent afternoons at the local movie house. The Searchers and Rebel Without a Cause were two of his favourites. Always a dreamer, Ochs fantasised that one day he could be a stoic cowboy like John Wayne, a teenage rebel like James Dean, or a rockabilly sex symbol like Elvis Presley. He took his early love of Hollywood with him to New York, where he became one of the most celebrated folk singers in the world, culminating in an album that has just turned 50: Greatest Hits, titled with a savage, knowing irony.</p>
<p>Ochs came up in the Greenwich Village folk scene, rattling off songs at a pace that caused Bob Dylan – with whom he had a friendly rivalry – to complain “I just can’t keep up with Phil”. But Ochs couldn’t cross over like Dylan did. His sole hit song There But for Fortune, which reached No 50 in the US and the Top 10 in the UK, was performed by Joan Baez.</p>

<p>The peak of his career took a different form. In 1968, aged 27, Ochs agreed to help organise and perform at the Festival of Life demonstration against the Vietnam war in Chicago’s Grant Park, at the Democratic National Convention. During his performance of I Ain’t Marching Anymore, one of his most acerbic and damning anti-war songs, bursts of fire sparkled throughout the crowd as young men from across America took the song’s message to heart and burned their draft cards. It was a defining moment in Ochs’s life and one of his greatest personal achievements. “This is the highlight of my career,” he told journalist Paul Krassner as he walked off stage. He felt like a Hollywood hero.</p>
<p>His sense of triumph would not last long. In the days following Ochs’s performance, Chicago mayor Richard Daley dispatched hundreds of police officers into Grant Park, sparking mass violence and leaving many demonstrators and police severely injured. Hubert Humphrey, the establishment candidate, won the nomination. Richard Nixon won the election. To many, the dream of the 60s died that summer in Chicago, but Ochs took the defeat especially hard.</p>
<p>Unknown to most of the music industry and his fans, Ochs battled undiagnosed and untreated bipolar disorder. When the revolution that first inspired him to write and sing apparently shattered, Ochs felt he no longer had an artistic or political purpose. He entered into the deepest, darkest depression of his life. By 1969, he was drinking heavily and abusing prescription drugs, worrying his friends and family. He’d recently separated from his wife Alice, with whom he had a young daughter, Meegan, and relocated from New York to Los Angeles with a new girlfriend. In LA, Ochs spent his days and nights listlessly reading the newspaper, watching TV and drinking at the legendary Troubadour nightclub. His once bountiful stream of creative energy trickled to almost nothing.</p>
<p>Enter Elvis Presley. Michael Ochs, Phil’s brother and manager, scored tickets to Elvis’s comeback performance in Las Vegas and took Phil to the gig. By this point, Elvis was overweight and deeply into his polyester jumpsuit period, but Ochs was stunned by the King’s electrifying performance. He had an idea.</p>

<p>Ochs concluded that Nixon had won because he had a more direct connection to the American people, and was determined to alleviate the drugs, violence, and lawlessness that the counterculture now represented. The old folkie Phil Ochs image served no purpose in modern America, he thought. If he had anything left to say, artistically or politically, he needed to meet America on America’s terms. In Ochs’s own words, “getting Elvis Presley to become Che Guevara”.</p>
<p>Back in LA, he got to work on what would become his sixth and final studio album, Greatest Hits. It’s his most singularly cohesive and confounding work – an experimental country rock album steeped in bleak postmodern Americana. Each song takes the listener on a vivid, hazy and often disturbing trip through Ochs’s mid-century American dream: visions of idyllic movie houses and open highways give way to dead movie stars, alcoholism and Hollywood excess.</p>
<p>Every aspect of the record, including the title, was contrary to the earnest folk singer image that Ochs was known for. Against the advice of his label, his manager, and pretty much everyone else in his life, Ochs insisted on titling the album Greatest Hits: a self-effacing joke considering he virtually had no hits to speak of. Greatest Hits was almost guaranteed to cause confusion among his fans, who might buy the album thinking they were going to get Phil Ochs classics, only to be confronted with not only new songs, but a drastic shift in musical style. As of today, Apple Music mistakenly lists Greatest Hits as a hits compilation, not a studio album of new material.</p>

<p>Ochs hired Nudie Cohn, a designer of exquisitely gaudy, rhinestone outfits for Elvis and Gram Parsons, to make him a new suit that would be his official uniform for the new album. But not just any new suit – a gold lamé suit, similar to the one Elvis famously wore on the cover of his greatest hits compilation 50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can’t Be Wrong. On the Greatest Hits cover, Ochs appears slightly dwarfed and uncomfortable, not the confident, cocky young activist we see on the sleeve of I Ain’t Marching Anymore. On the back, he poses below the words 50 Phil Ochs Fans Can’t Be Wrong! Ochs had always been a prankster, but his label was flabbergasted by the sardonic, self-sabotaging concept of his new album.</p>
<p>The recording of Greatest Hits, produced primarily by Van Dyke Parks, took only two days, likely due to budget restrictions – Ochs was far from a bestseller for A&amp;M Records and they were understandably doubtful of the record’s commercial potential. Parks described Ochs as “intense” during the sessions. They hired highly regarded studio musicians, including Elvis guitarist James Burton, Ry Cooder, and Merle Haggard backup singer Bobby Wayne. Ochs often played with the band in the same room, a technique used on country records to add a looser honky-tonk vibe to the songs. The opening track, One Way Ticket Home, explodes in bombastic Technicolor with horns, timpani and rockabilly guitars – equal parts Ennio Morricone and Elvis. On Boy in Ohio, Ochs’s lovely ode to the simplicity of his youth, Parks pulls the instrumentation back to a simple slide guitar and harmonica punctuating delicate acoustic strumming and a tender vocal.</p>
<p>On that song, Ochs remembers the thrill of early discovery in a picture-perfect midwestern town, lamenting the unrelenting speed of American progress: “We would wait for the summer to come / For swimmin’ and pickin’ berries / But now a freeway covers the field / Where I used to be so happy”. Jim Dean of Indiana is the heart of Greatest Hits and even more wrenching: a devastating, masterfully told tribute to James Dean, Ochs’s ultimate movie hero. Ochs paints the rise and fall of Dean – “he played a boy without a home, torn with no tomorrow” – through the eyes of an adoring fan, in the final stanza revealed to be Ochs himself. Drawing subtle parallels between Dean’s rise to fame and his own, Ochs questions the psychological toll of stardom and the cult of personality surrounding dead celebrities.</p>
<p>One gets the sense that Ochs had already, on some level, made peace with the death of his career, and Chords of Fame scarily predicts the swift slide into alcoholism and madness that the 70s held in store for him: “God help the troubadour who tries to be a star.” Basket in the Pool describes a real incident where a wasted Ochs won a basket filled with fine wine and cheeses as a door prize at comedian Tom Smothers’ party – Ochs thought it would be funny to throw the basket of goodies into the pool, which disgusted the other guests. Gas Station Women describes a brokenhearted factory worker, but minus the factory; the song could be a description of Ochs’s life after the disaster of Chicago. On the closing track, No More Songs, the refrain reads:</p>
<p>Hello hello hello, is anybody home</p>
<p>I’ve only called to say I’m sorry</p>
<p>The drums are in the dawn</p>
<p>And all the voices gone</p>
<p>And it seems that there are no more songs</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest Phil Ochs : Jim Dean of Indiana</p>
<p>Greatest Hits sold less than 50,000 copies and remains the poorest selling album of Ochs’s career. It was pulled from shelves weeks after its release. Still, Ochs was determined to fight for his vision of American popular music as a vehicle for a socialist revolution. He took his gold lamé suit and performed two raucous shows at Carnegie Hall, featuring medleys of Elvis and Buddy Holly tunes and almost none of his old folk classics. He was mostly booed. A live recording of these shows was released in 1974 under the title Gunfight at Carnegie Hall. “Bring back Phil Ochs!” an audience member shouts. By the end of the Greatest Hits tour debacle, Ochs was spent: creatively, physically, spiritually and politically.</p>
<p>By the early 70s, singer-songwriters largely turned apolitical and inward, which never suited Ochs. James Taylor’s Sweet Baby James, released in the same month as Greatest Hits, was a Top 10 hit and sold 3 million copies. Joni Mitchell was about to go Blue; Dylan had largely gone on hiatus. Having failed to endear himself to a new generation, Ochs occasionally worked on new songs, but he would never again assemble enough material for another studio album. He travelled around the world, played shows here and there, befriended revolutionaries, played backgammon, wrote movie reviews, and kept organising protests, rallies and benefits.</p>
<p>The songs on Greatest Hits always remained among his favourites – John Lennon, a longtime fan, once jammed with him on Chords of Fame. But Ochs was never able to recover from a manic, alcoholic bender in the summer of 1975, when he assumed an evil alter ego named John Butler Train, designed to kill off the old Phil Ochs for good. In the 2010 Ochs documentary There But for Fortune, Sonny Ochs, his sister, describes his final days in early 1976 at her house in Far Rockaway, New York. Broke and exhausted, he would sometimes sit at Sonny’s piano and pick out the mournful, sublime melody of Jim Dean of Indiana, possibly the last music he would ever play. He died by suicide.</p>
<p>History will rightly remember Phil Ochs for his topical protest songs, among the sharpest ever written in American folk music, and in Greatest Hits we’re able to see where the strength of his conviction came from. The boy in the movie house worshipping at the feet of James Dean, and America, a place he loved dearly and believed could be better, more humane and forgiving. In the days before his death, Ochs asked his brother Michael: “Do you think the songs will be remembered?” He needn’t have worried. His beloved and scorned gold lamé suit, meanwhile, hangs in the archive of that other great American protest singer: Woody Guthrie.

<h3 id="philip-rambow--the-rebel-kind-anthology-1972-2020--album-review">&ldquo;Philip Rambow – The Rebel Kind Anthology 1972-2020 – album review&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://louderthanwar.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Philr.jpg" alt="img">
Philip Rambow – The Rebel Kind Anthology 1972-2020</p>
<p>Cherry Red</p>
<p>3CD/DL</p>
<p>Released 29 May 2020</p>
<p>Round-up of the solo output of ex-Winkies singer Phil Rambow, with his three albums Shooting Gallery, Jungle Law and Whatever Happened To… plus many bonus tracks, including four demos cut with Mick Ronson and the first take of There’s A Guy Works Down The Chip Shop Swears He’s Elvis, sung by Kirsty MacColl. LTW’s Ian Canty looks at the work of a man who, by his own admission, was nearly famous twice….</p>
<p>Montreal native Philip Rambow first acquired a dose of notoriety via his unusual London-based pub/glam outfit the Winkies, once named by a certain Billy Idol as the first punk band. But he first recorded on his own back in 1972 under the tutelage of Jack Schectman in Toronto and Song Untitled from that session appears as a bonus track on the first disc of this compilation. The cheeky title, soulful voice and well-judged folk rock setting provided a glimpse of a developing talent to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>The next year Rambow began his adventures with the Winkies. Offering something a bit more spicy to the usual pub rock fare, their different attitude impressed one Brian Eno, who had just left Roxy Music. He enlisted them as his backing band for a John Peel session and an ill-fated tour that lasted a mere six dates. Even so, this thrust the Winkies into the public eye and Chrysalis snapped the band up. After junking some sessions with Leo Lyons behind the desk, they completed their self-titled LP with Guy Stevens producing. Unfortunately it failed to make an impact beyond the risqué “banana hammock” sleeve photo and they disbanded soon after the record’s release.</p>
<p>Chrysalis had enough faith in Rambow to retain him as a solo artist and his debut solo single, the tough street rock with steel drums(!) of Dem Eyes, showed he knew which way the wind was blowing in late 1975 at least. After Chris Wright, the label’s boss, had reportedly called Rambow a genius, the imprint cooled their interest a touch when the single failed to scale the charts. Spending a short while with a new band that included Blair Cunningham (later of Haircut 100), he then moved temporarily to the US. There he played legendary venues CBGBs and Max’s (even featuring on the second album taped at the latter club with Night Out, also covered by Ellen Foley on her debut LP), slowly making a name for himself until Chrysalis summoned him back to London as punk hit big.</p>
<p>A band was put together featuring the great Mick Ronson and demos were made with Chris Thomas and Bill Price producing. Four of the tracks set down are present as bonus tracks here and they’re pure gold, worth the price of admission alone. There is a bit of a sense that Mick was less than fully committed to the project, only wholeheartedly contributing to Fallen. His on-going partnership with Ian Hunter in the end curtailed things pretty quickly, which was a crying shame. What we have here is a perfect meshing of the skills of the performers given awesome power and precision by the production. Great songs, great playing and exciting performances, with Fallen and Cheap Shot being particularly fine. But somehow Chrysalis came to the peculiar decision that the tape was “just thrash” and rejected it outright – cloth ears in A&amp;R bringing the curtain down on something special. An album penned by Rambow with Ronson onboard would surely have been a delight.</p>
<p>Undaunted Phil dusted himself off and threw himself into the capital’s jumping live circuit. He contributed Underground Romance (a bonus track on CD two) to the Hope And Anchor Front Row Festival LP, which on top of a burgeoning reputation as a live act alerted EMI to his abilities. In 1979 he cut his first album for the label Shooting Gallery. A record of depth and abundant appeal, it again failed, possibly due to a lack of promotion. It appears that a change in EMI’s hierarchy resulted in Rambow plummeting down its list of priorities and the LP slipping out almost unnoticed as a result.</p>
<p>Mad again really, because if anything had a shot of thriving when exposed to the many fans of Elvis Costello and Graham Parker at the time, it was the finely judged power, variety and song-writing smarts of Shooting Gallery. If the re-recordings of Fallen (issued as a single) and Young Lust don’t quite match the Ronson band’s efforts, they’re still full of riffy goodness ripe for the new wave crowd. Even better is Don’t Call Me Tonto, a no-holds-barred tough driving number with a clever, hard-bitten lyric that underlined Phil’s never say die attitude. The Rebel Kind, also a single, was a wonderful soul pop/glam slam concoction that certainly had chart potential. But all the way through this is a quality record, from the high energy salvo of Strange Destinies to the mean and moody set closer Deep River.</p>
<p>Again Rambow was faced with a set of perfectly fine offerings not connecting with the listening public. Another bonus track on one disc one does point to a future line of success – the first demo of There’s A Guy Works Down Chip Shop Swears He’s Elvis, cut with Kirsty MacColl and a sparse backing from Phil on guitar and vocals, plus a rhythm machine. This record would kickstart Kirsty’s chart career and provide a decent side-line for Phil in providing songs for others. As the new decade dawned, EMI kept some faith in him though and two years after his debut a second album for the imprint Jungle Law arrived in 1981. Written in the aftermath of a romantic break-up, the LP is full of bittersweet observations, but he never overdoes things to the extent it stops the songs being involving and the melodies captivating.</p>
<p>If one thing stood in the way of Jungle Law’s success apart from EMI’s customary indifference to promoting Phil’s work, it could have been the changing face of pop music by 1981. Gamely there are attempts at modernising the sound, with the title track utilising a galloping beat and some electronic keyboards well and the gleaming synths on the otherwise Graham Parker/Phil Spector pop of Bike Boys. One sensed though that Rambow was a touch happier on more rock-flavoured efforts like the excellent Snakes And Ladders, an “end-of-gig/scarves-in-the-air” red-hot rocker in the Faces/Mott mode and the anthemic Don’t Come (Cryin’ To Me). Overall this was another strong selection that didn’t make any headway through no fault of the artist and his backing band.</p>
<p>Though the album was another goodie, the bonus tracks here don’t quite live up to the excellent ones featured on disc one. The four efforts that were recorded by soundtrack king Hans Zimmer plod due to the 80s production ticks, though Smokehouse Bay is an interesting electropop crossover. Rambow’s latest backing outfit the Debonairs’ boogie unexceptionally on Ain’t No Fun To Me, but an unsuccessful attempt to follow Auf Widersehen Pet’s Jimmy Nail into the charts with fellow cast member Gary Holton is a lot more fun. Glen Matlock and James Stevenson combine with Phil to provide the ex-Heavy Metal Kid with a good tune in Big Tears and a sound much in the style of Iggy’s hit Real Wild Child. We also get the live Underground Romance from the Hope comp, which is of course blooming good and Ellen Foley’s cover of Night Out.</p>
<p>In between Jungle Law and 2014’s Whatever Happened To Phil Rambow a lot of time passed. In the interim Phil worked in A&amp;R, ironically enough given his record label troubles, amongst other short term ventures. An invitation to appear at 2013’s RonsonFest, in tribute to his old mucker Mick, got him back into performing and after a stint supporting Bowie tribute act Holy Holy he finally got round to cutting a new album. Given the thirty years plus that had elapsed it is no surprise that Whatever Happened To… is a completely different kettle of fish than the other two LPs in this set. The nods towards country and folk that permeated Shooting Gallery and Jungle Law are far more pronounced here, but one could not deny Rambow still had a real talent for a winning couplet coupled with an appealing musical vision.</p>
<p>The goodtime, horn-driven of Not Broken, a smart song of defiance, welcomes us in and shows that whilst Phil may be toting a lighter sound, he’s still got a tonne of passion and soul. Call Me Anytime is a sharp look back to the new wave days sound-wise and Nothing Is Sacred a pure jolt of rock &amp; roll goodness. The slow-burning one-two of Once We Were Young and Perfect Storm bring the LP to an atmospheric, satisfying close.</p>
<p>The bonuses here echo the themes of the album, with the cool jazzy Alligator and a choral setting for The Writing’s On The Wall shining. Finally and bringing things right up to date we have two tracks from Rambow’s new LP Canadiana, including the fine Oceans Apart single, which benefits greatly from a lovely vocal performance by Sharlene Hector.</p>
<p>Phil Rambow remains an excellent songwriter, a talented performer that always provided something interesting for any audience that were prepared to listen. Unfortunately for the most part, this audience numbered relatively few, nowhere near enough to put him in reach of the success that he deserved (but only really received when writing for other people). Never fear, because you can still become part of this select group by taking time to acquaint yourself with The Rebel Kind, where his soulful voice, unstoppable ebullience and eminently cool wordplay are given ample opportunity to beguile the adventurous listener. A top quality set which has the added advantage of giving a view of an artist that still has something to offer today.</p>

<h3 id="was-it-a-lost-psych-funk-classic-its-khruangbin-right-now">&ldquo;‘Was It a Lost Psych-Funk Classic?’ It’s Khruangbin, Right Now&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/21/arts/14khruangbin1/14khruangbin1-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
In 2013, the producer and D.J. Bonobo released his version of “Late Night Tales,” the long-running musician-curated album series. The compilation’s theme was serene songs meant to soundtrack the night, and he included “A Calf Born in Winter” from a band called Khruangbin, an upstart Houston trio that hadn’t yet made a full album.</p>
<p>Bonobo had met two of its members, the bassist Laura Lee and the guitarist Mark Speer, in 2010 when they were touring with another band. What he heard of their own project made a strong impression. “The analogue timbres and subtleties of the melodies were incredible,” he wrote in an email. He didn’t forget about Khruangbin, and made an effort to introduce them to everyone he could — Bonobo was among the first to spread Khruangbin’s music by word of mouth, but he certainly wouldn’t be the last.</p>
<p>“A Calf Born in Winter” didn’t feel like a hit, but maybe that was the point: It was different, an ambient mix of drifting guitar chords, light bass and faint drums that seemed destined for a spot on chilled-out Spotify playlists, and not much else. But it connected with larger audiences in Britain, and Khruangbin started touring the world. Its first full-length album, “The Universe Smiles Upon You,” was released on the London-based label Night Time Stories in 2015.
