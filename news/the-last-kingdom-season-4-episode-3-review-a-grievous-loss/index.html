Luckily, the show’s children are stepping up. Aethelflaed fulfilled her promise as a true leader of Mercia by coming to her people’s aid (even if her, Aldhelm and the bloke who waters the horses don’t stand a great chance against Cnut’s entire army). Finan the joker proved this episode to have a very wise head on his shoulders, and is now the most likely candidate to step into Beocca’s shoes as Uhtred’s closest advisor. Brida is set to become a mother, which will only make her more of a warrior. And Young Uhtred has come around and sworn allegiance to his father.</p>
<p>The advocates Uhtred earned over the years spoke up for him in episode three, rallying in his time of need. Beocca, Finan, even the memory of Gisela helped Young Uhtred to see that his father must be more than a bloodthirsty Pagan to garner so much loyalty and respect.</p>
<p>The hour was filled with emotional monologues and touching tributes. Uhtred was crushed, declaring himself finished with battles and bemoaning the loss of his lands and his name. He cried and hugged, and hug-cried, but only after transforming into a Tasmanian Devil of grief-based rage back at the fortress.</p>
<p>That was an exhilarating sequence. Still reeling from Beocca’s premature exit, we watched our hero become a stab ‘n’ slice machine, repelling grown men with the earthquake-like force of his yells. A series of thrilling skirmishes followed the men to the ship, where the rain too, wept for Father Beocca.</p>
<p>Down south, a shit-storm of gargantuan proportions was brewing. If I’ve tracked this correctly, the Danes and the Mercians both left their own lands to invade each other’s, just missing each other like a wife and a mistress in a French farce. Now Cnut’s waiting for Edward to help Aethelred, so he can kill them both and win, and Edward’s waiting for Cnut to kill Aethelred, so he can kill Cnut and win.

<h3 id="the-last-kingdom-the-real-history-behind-the-series">The Last Kingdom: the real history behind the series</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/7/2020/04/Alexander-Dreymon-as-Uhtred-in-season-4-of-The-Last-Kingdom-b3f1bee.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=620,413" alt="img">
When is The Last Kingdom set and what it is about?</p>
<p>It is the story of the struggle between Saxons and Danes in 9th-century England, when England was not one nation but a series of independent kingdoms variously overrun or ravaged by Danes. The era of Lindisfarne and raiders from the sea is long past – by this point in history, the Vikings in Britain are settlers, lords and kings .</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>This tale plays out from the perspective of Uhtred of Bebbanburg, a man born a Saxon and raised a Dane, grappling with his persistently split loyalties between his oaths (of which he makes many), his conflicting cultural identities, and his quest for retribution.</p>
<p>What starts out as a tale of straightforward revenge – reclaiming his ancestral home in Northumbria from his usurping uncle and avenging the murder of his adoptive Viking father – rapidly extends into a history-adjacent Vikings versus Anglo-Saxons epic, as Uhtred finds himself in the Kingdom of Wessex, where Alfred the Great has dreams of expelling the northmen from all the realms of ‘England’ and creating a single nation, something that wouldn’t be achieved until the reign of his grandson .</p>
<p>The show is based on the Saxon Stories novels of Bernard Cornwell (now renamed as the The Last Kingdom series owing to the show’s success), of which there are currently 12 in print, with the concluding 13th instalment – War Lord – due to be published in October 2020.</p>

<p>What is the plot of The Last Kingdom season four?</p>
<p>Season four of The Last Kingdom is widely expected to cover books seven and eight of Bernard Cornwell’s saga, The Pagan Lord and The Empty Throne. Alfred the Great is dead, as is his ever-conniving nephew Aethelwold; Alfred’s son Edward the Elder sits on the throne of Wessex; his daughter Aethelflaed is wed to the ruler of Mercia; and the Danes, led by Haesten and Cnut ( not Cnut the Great – he won’t be born for another hundred years ), sense opportunity. Uhtred, meanwhile, realises now might be the time to challenge his uncle Aelfric for his birthright, the lordship of Bebbanburg in Northumbria.</p>
<p>Once season four is complete, there are still three more books in Cornwell’s series to adapt – if the The Last Kingdom is renewed for future seasons.</p>
<p>THE LAST KINGDOM SEASON 4 REVIEWS (LIST UPDATED DAILY):</p>
<p>What happened in The Last Kingdom season one? And what’s the real history?</p>
<p>The Last Kingdom begins in 866, the year that Vikings first seized control of York . Uhtred is a child and heir to Bebbanburg (Bamburgh) in Northumbria. When the Vikings arrive, his father, Lord Uhtred, rides out to give battle and is predictably slain; the boy Uhtred is captured.</p>
<p>Uhtred’s uncle Aelfric hopes to ransom the boy back and quietly murder him so that he can claim the lordship of Bebbanburg for himself unimpeded, but that plan is scuppered when Danish jarl Ragnar the Fearless takes a liking to the lad and ultimately takes him back to Denmark along with a Saxon girl, Brida.</p>
<p>Fast forward several years: Uhtred is now a young man, fully immersed in Norse culture and religion. His apparent happiness comes crashing down when Ragnar the Fearless is murdered, burned alive in his hall by shipmaster Kjartan and his son Sven the One-Eyed, in retribution for Ragnar taking Sven’s eye many years before. Kjartan spreads rumours that Saxon-born Uhtred is the miscreant behind the deed, forcing Uhtred to flee back across the North Sea to the lands he left as a boy.</p>
<p>It’s on returning to Northumbria that Uhtred meets Guthrum and Ubba, one of the fabled sons of legendary Viking hero Ragnar Lothbrok , whom he watches murder King Edmund of the East Angles. The real Edmund “was tied to a tree, beaten and then murdered with a volley of arrows,” writes ecclesiastical historian Emma J Wells – which is pretty much what happens here, except it plays out in a church.</p>
<p>Guthrum and Ubba don’t believe his innocence, so Uhtred flees to Winchester, capital of Wessex, the titular ‘last kingdom’ to fall prey to the Danes. Aethelred I rules, but by the middle of the season he has been mortally wounded, and on his deathbed passes the crown to his brother, Alfred – overlooking Aethelwold, his own son, portrayed as a drunkard who believes the crown should have been his by default.</p>
<p>“[Alfred] can never have expected to be king, as the youngest of five brothers, but all of them died young,” writes Michael Wood. “He was 21, pious and brave, but in poor health, with a crippling hereditary illness, perhaps Crohn’s Disease.”</p>
<p>Young Ragnar, son of Ragnar the Fearless, returns from Ireland – one of the many shores aside from England that the Vikings sailed to – to confirm for himself that Uhtred didn’t kill their father. When he leaves to seek revenge on Kjartan, Brida departs with him.</p>
<p>Uhtred proves instrumental at the battle of Cynwit in Devon in 878 – one of the four most important ‘lost battles’ of the Viking age, writes Thomas Williams, who describes it as “one of the great military reversals of the early Middle Ages”, prior to which he kills Ubba in single combat. Uhtred’s part in the battle is glossed over (a common theme in The Last Kingdom) and victory is ascribed to Odda the Elder, ealdorman of Devon, as it is in real history.</p>
<p>Uhtred and Alfred clash frequently through the rest of the series over loyalty and religion, but where Alfred is forced to admit Uhtred’s usefulness is when the would-be Lord of Bebbanburg helps Alfred escape into the Somerset Marshes – where he famously burns the cakes – in the wake of the Danish invasion of Wessex in 878, and then at the battle of Edington in which the Saxons inflict a crushing defeat on the Northmen.</p>
<p>Listen to renowned historical novelist Bernard Cornwell talk about his books that inspired The Last Kingdom, and about his writing career more broadly:</p>
<p>What happens in The Last Kingdom season two?</p>
<p>Uhtred heads north – not to Bebbanburg, but to rescue Guthred, a Christian Dane prophesised to become the king of Cumberland. The mission is a success, but once king Guthred is convinced to betray Uhtred and sells him into slavery. Alfred sends Young Ragnar (son of Ragnar the Fearless and Uhtred’s adoptive brother, taken hostage by Wessex at the end of season one) to rescue him. Reunited, Ragnar and Uhtred besiege Kjartan and Sven the One-Eyed in Durham, finally avenging Ragnar the Fearless.</p>
<p>This season also develops the character of Aethelflaed – not yet the ‘Lady of the Mercians’, but a young woman and, as a daughter of a king, one ready to be married off in alliance – “As a wife, Æthelflæd’s story is all too familiar in terms of royal dynastic marriages,” writes Dr Janina Ramirez. She is wed, in history and on The Last Kingdom, to Aethelred of Mercia. “Theirs was an entirely political union, designed to strengthen the two kingdoms against Danish and Norwegian incursions in the north,” says Ramirez.</p>
<p>On the show, the Mercian Aethelred reveals himself to be a poor husband, possessive and abusive. He takes Aethelflaed to war against Danish brothers Siegfried and Erik (both fictional antagonists) and their underling Haesten (who did exist), where she is captured and held for ransom, setting up the season’s climatic battle at Benfleet in 893 and Odda the Elder’s suicide in lieu of certain execution for treason.</p>
<p>What happened in The Last Kingdom season three?</p>
<p>Season three opens by introducing two new antagonists, the warrior Bloodhair and his seer, Skade – who has a vision of Bloodhair killing Alfred in battle. But Alfred really is dying, through ill health; Edward the Aetheling is a young man not yet ready to rule; Aetholwold is sowing discord as he sees a route to finally becoming king.</p>
<p>Relations between Uhtred and Alfred reach crisis point when Uhtred accidentally kills a priest after Aethelwold’s meddling; in response, Alfred tries to make Uhtred swear an oath to serve Edward. Uhtred, realising that swearing an oath to Edward would mean a life of servitude, flatly refuses, then takes Alfred hostage to effect his escape.</p>
<p>Season three places Aethelwold centre stage playing politics. He also leaves Wessex, stopping first at Mercia, where he sows the seeds of betrayal for Aethelflaed, and the at Bloodhair’s camp, where he argues that the Danes should form a single ‘great army’ to crush Wessex.</p>
<p>“West Saxon chroniclers were scathing about Æthelwold’s alliance with Vikings, but as a tactic of war it wasn’t unusual,” writes early medieval historian Professor Ryan Lavelle, who is also The Last Kingdom’s historical consultant. “There is good reason to suspect that Alfred too allied himself with Viking mercenaries when circumstances required.”</p>
<p>Uhtred makes his way north to Durham and to his brother Ragnar the Younger, where he briefly plots with Bloodhair, Haesten and Ragnar’s cousin Cnut to form a great army to invade the Saxon kingdoms, but abandons them to rescue Aethelflaed – now hiding in a nunnery, because Aethelred is plotting to have her killed.</p>
<p>Later, Aethelwold murders Ragnar in his bed – preventing him from reaching his sword and denying him entry to Valhalla. Haesten is revealed to be a spy for Alfred and alerts the king to the Danish threat.</p>
<p>Alfred finally succumbs to his illness – but not before he reconciles with Uhtred and sees Edward married. Uhtred publicly affirms his support for Edward as the presumptive king, and they ride to meet Aethelwold and the Danes near Bedford – defeating them with the help of Mercia and Kent. At the battle’s climax, Uhtred catches up with Aethelwold (having learned that he was the one responsible for Young Ragnar’s death) and stabs him through the heart.</p>
<p>This final act of Aethelwold’s machinations plays out markedly different to real events. Though in the show it is dealt with in the immediate aftermath of Alfred’s death in 899, the actual battle took place at unidentified location suspected to be Holme in East Anglia in 902, after a three-year insurrection in which Aethelwold had moderate success. Even the circumstances of the battle are reversed, with the Danes ambushing Edward’s army – they won the battle, but Aethelwold died in the fighting, making it somewhat pyrrhic.</p>
<p>“Æthelwold’s insurrection is little known today, a mere footnote in Anglo-Saxon history,” says Lavelle. “It also hints that, had Æthelwold enjoyed a little more fortune in the fallout from Alfred’s death, and had one obscure battle in 902 had an alternative outcome, the future of England could have been very different indeed.”</p>
<p>How will The Last Kingdom end?</p>
<p>If the show continues and follows the thread of Bernard Cornwell’s novels, then we might already know the answer. Cornwell told HistoryExtra in 2018 that The Last Kingdom series is going to end with a real historical event: the battle of Brunanburh in 937 . The battle marked the beginning of England, so obviously had to be included in the series.</p>
<p>The Last Kingdom season four airs on Netflix from Sunday 26 April.</p>

<h3 id="is-the-last-kingdom-historically-accurate-20-questions-answered">Is The Last Kingdom historically accurate? 20 Questions Answered</h3>
<p><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/w_2000,h_2000,c_fit/https%3A%2F%2Fwinteriscoming.net%2Ffiles%2Fimage-exchange%2F2020%2F03%2Fie_43051.jpeg" alt="img">
Alright, fellow arselings! With the much anticipated fourth season of The Last Kingdom dropping on Netflix, it’s time to sharpen our swords and gather the fyrd! In this article, we’ll have some fun looking over the historical elements of the show and see how accurately The Last Kingdom has been adhering to the known record.</p>
<p>That said, keep in mind that The Last Kingdom has a bit of an advantage since it’s set in the late ninth century, in the Early Medieval Period where much of the archaeological record is spotty at best and nonexistent at worst. There’s a lot of room to play with story elements, accuracy-wise.</p>
<p>The show is based on a series of novels — The Saxon Stories — by author Bernard Cornwell, but we’re not going to tackle how faithful Cornwell is to history here. This is about the TV adaptation.</p>
<p>Of course, The Last Kingdom is a fictional show based on historical events, where Cornwell and the showrunners often bend or ignore established historical facts and timelines in favor of enhancing the drama and streamlining the narrative. But it’s still fun to see how closely they’re managing to stick to the established history anyway. Let’s have at it!</p>
<p>Warning: There are SPOILER for the first three seasons ahead, and potentially for the fourth.
