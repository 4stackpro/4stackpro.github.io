An insightful documentary shown on RTÉ Two on Sunday night highlighted the plight of the pangolin, a shy, scaly animal found in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, which has the unfortunate title of the world&rsquo;s most trafficked mammal.</p>
<p>A 2016 report by animal charity, WildAid, estimated that one million pangolins were taken from the wild in the preceding decade. The nocturnal, solitary creature is often compared to a scaly anteater. It has no teeth and survives on a diet of insects it consumes with the aid of its extremely long tongue.</p>
<p>All eight of the subspecies of pangolin are protected under national and international law, but illegal trade in the animals continues and two types of pangolin are now critically endangered.</p>
<p>Pangolin meat is considered a delicacy in parts of Africa, China and Vietnam and their scales are used as a traditional medicine in Asia. To add to the animal’s woes, it’s now being blamed as a possible source of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Two groups of coronaviruses related to Covid-19 were found in smuggled pangolins</p>
<p>Since the coronavirus began to take hold in China early this year, scientists have been scrambling to find its origin, believed to have been a food market in Wuhan.</p>
<p>As bats are traditionally associated with coronaviruses (such as SARS), it was widely assumed that this novel coronavirus also originated in bats.</p>
<p>In fact, bats are reservoirs for hundreds of coronaviruses. Part of the reason for this is that, as the only flying mammals, bats have developed a rare ability to fight viruses, and consequently live with various types of diseases.</p>
<p>Read: More coronavirus stories</p>
<p>Analyses of the genetic code of the novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, backed up the theory that the virus originated in bats.</p>
<p>Since other coronaviruses have transmitted to humans from bats via an intermediary animal, it&rsquo;s now assumed that&rsquo;s the case here too. Several possible culprits have emerged, including the aforementioned pangolin, but scientists haven&rsquo;t reached consensus on the matter.</p>
<p>Researchers in Hong Kong and China claim to have found viruses in the scaly mammals, which are closely related to the one responsible for the Covid-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>The team analysed samples taken from more than 30 Malayan pangolins seized during anti-smuggling operations between August 2017 and January 2019.</p>
<p>They detected two groups of coronaviruses related to the new virus behind the human pandemic in some of the animals smuggled into China. But the researchers said the role of pangolins as the intermediate host of the disease remains to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Experts say handling pangolins &ldquo;requires considerable caution&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, a paper published in the journal Nature, said the findings suggest handling pangolins &ldquo;requires considerable caution&rdquo; and that the sale of these animals in wet markets &ldquo;should be strictly prohibited&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It added further surveillance is needed to understand the role of the animals in the emergence of coronaviruses. Outside of bats, pangolins are the only mammals reported to date that have been found to be infected with a coronavirus related to Sars-Cov-2.</p>
<p>The researchers said their findings highlight &ldquo;a potentially important role&rdquo; for the animals in the ecology of coronaviruses.</p>
<p>They wrote: &ldquo;The discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin coronavirus and their similarity to Sars-CoV-2 suggests that pangolins should be considered as possible hosts in the emergence of novel coronaviruses and should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In what could be seen as a boost to the endangered animal, China declared an immediate and &ldquo;comprehensive&rdquo; ban on the trade and consumption of wild animals in February.</p>
<p>Beijing implemented similar measures following the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s, but the trade and consumption of wild animals, including bats and snakes, made a comeback.</p>
<p>This time the ban is permanent, raising hopes that it could end the local trade in wildlife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do think the government has seen the toll it takes on national economy and society is much bigger than the benefit that wild-eating business brings,&rdquo; said Jeff He, China director at the International Fund for Animal Welfare.</p>
<p>Reports linking the virus to the pangolin have also scared off would-be consumers of the scaly mammals elsewhere, with bushmeat vendors in Gabon reporting a plunge in sales.

<h3 id="in-an-african-forest-a-fight-to-save-the-endangered-pangolin">In an African forest, a fight to save the endangered pangolin</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b4e07138-735c-11ea-994d-005056a98db9/w:1240/p:16x9/781a8d794b76567a461cdb9ed44ca569b2311f42.jpg" alt="img">
Heads up: Swiss scientist Maja Gudehus, rear, and a Pygmy tracker look for the elusive pangolin</p>
<p>Advertising Read more</p>
<p>Dzanga-Sangha National Park (Centrafrique) (AFP)</p>
<p>The prehistoric shape is hard to make out as it moves slowly through the gloomy forest, so trackers listen for the rustle of scales against the leaves to pick up its trail.</p>
<p>Their target is the long-tailed pangolin &ndash; a little mammal also called the scaly anteater, which will be lucky to survive to the end of this century.</p>
<p>The harmless creature has no defence against predators apart from its small size and a camouflage of brown scales covering its body.</p>
<p>Today, the world&rsquo;s pangolin species are listed as either vulnerable or critically endangered.</p>
<p>The pangolin is considered the most-trafficked animal on the planet &ndash; the victim of mass poaching for bushmeat and sales of its scales, especially to China.</p>
<p>According to a study published in 2017 by the Conservation Letters journal, between 400,000 and 2.7 million of the animals are hunted each year in central African forests.</p>
<p>Their plight has leapt to worldwide prominence as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The microbe is believed to have leapt the species barrier in markets in China, where pangolins and other wild animals are killed for their meat.</p>
<p>After testing more than 1,000 samples from wild animals, scientists at the South China Agricultural University found the genome sequences of viruses found on pangolins to be 99 percent identical to those on coronavirus patients.</p>
<p>Anecdotal evidence from Gabon suggests that the bushmeat trade in pangolins has plummeted since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic &ndash; but wildlife experts say it is too early to say whether this decline will last, and what impact this will have on the creatures&rsquo; survival.</p>
<p>— &lsquo;No data exists&rsquo; —</p>
<p>The Dzanga-Sangha National Park, in the far southwest of the CAR, is the last sanctuary for animal life in a poor country ravaged by civil war. Its dense forest offers one of the world&rsquo;s few refuges for a species facing extinction.</p>
<p>In this haven, pangolin trackers have no interest in the creature&rsquo; meat or taking the scales that sell at phenomenal prices in Chinese traditional medicine for their supposed therapeutic qualities &ndash; claims that are scientifically unproven and strongly contested.</p>
<p>Researcher Maja Gudehus is leading a team in Dzanga-Sangha to study pangolins in their natural habitat, the better to understand their ways and to protect them.</p>
<p>The project is unique in Africa. While their meat is prized, little is known about pangolins scientifically. Gudehus wants to unlock knowledge about their longevity, territory, food, life habits and reproductive cycle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Virtually no data exists about the long-tailed pangolin and not much more about the other African species,&rdquo; the Swiss scientist explained while watching her protege clamber in the branches overhead.</p>
<p>— Helped by Pygmies —</p>
<p>The animal is particularly easy to capture. When it senses danger, it curls up into a ball, which humans have but to pick up. But in captivity, it is one of the most difficult creatures to study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t keep them more than a few days. They don&rsquo;t eat, die from stress, gastritis, and other problems we don&rsquo;t know yet,&rdquo; Gudehus said.</p>
<p>The only solution is to monitor a few clearly identified specimens, with the help of Pygmies in the region. The knowledge of the Baka people, fine guides to the forest, is essential in tracking the fragile and fearful animals.</p>
<p>Of three creatures recently under observation, one has vanished and another was the victim of a hitherto unknown parasite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Normally one can tell when an animal is not well. But pangolins can die in half an hour without giving you time to notice,&rdquo; said Gudehus.</p>
<p>Gudehus uses whatever she can to provide necessary treatment. Her laboratory is also her home, a tiny shack besieged by vegetation, where scientific literature and boxes of medical supplies are packed in between her microscope and a camp bed.</p>
<p>— &lsquo;Difficult to follow&rsquo; —</p>
<p>&ldquo;We used to see many pangolins,&rdquo; said Didon, one of the most respected Baka trackers in the region. &ldquo;Today, they&rsquo;ve become rare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While all four African species of pangolin are present in the CAR and officially protected, the law is very hard to enforce. Two-thirds of the country are still in the hands of armed groups following a succession of conflicts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unlike elephants, pangolins are very difficult to track, and it&rsquo;s rare to be able to arrest poachers in the act,&rdquo; said Luis Arranz, the national park representative of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to rely on seizures on the road and on our informers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the park&rsquo;s offices, Arranz opened a metal door to give an idea of the scale of trafficking. Crates on shelves are overflowing with scales that had been destined for the Chinese market. The collection is valued at several hundred thousand euros (dollars).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, many people do that,&rdquo; said a local hunter, asking not to be named. &ldquo;A pot of pangolin scales sells for about 30,000 CFA francs (46 euros / $50). If there was work here, people wouldn&rsquo;t hunt.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="the-shy-yet-ominous-pangolin">The shy yet ominous pangolin</h3>
<p><img src="https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/03/31/626006.jpg" alt="img">
MYSTICISM and contagion theory obscures the logical rationale of worldviews held by endangered indigenous people like the Ma’ Betise’ of Peninsular Malaysia. Numbering only 3,500 individuals and living in mangrove rainforests on the west coast of the peninsula, they have developed a complex taxonomy of flora and fauna that contains ideas of conservation of wildlife.</p>
<p>Briefly, human existence with wild animals and plants is contained in ideas of ominous warnings and taboos on how to safely consume or, alternatively, protect wildlife and flora. Although these ideas of indigenous ecosystems convey much spirituality and mysticism, there is a scientific rationale behind these rules. The global pandemic of Covid-19, which is caused by a zoonotic strain of coronaviruses that have surfaced in the last and present century, is evidence of the dangers that can befall humans who kill and consume wildlife disproportionately.</p>
<p>Two oscillating concepts of consumption and conservation rule the lives of the Ma’ Betise’: tulah and kemali. Tulah are animals and plants that can be safely consumed while kemali are animals and plants that are anthropomorphic and hence close to humans in character and feature – they are “ancestral” and need to be protected like human elders.</p>
<p>Tulah animals are those that are reared, like poultry, pigs, goats and cattle as well as fish and crustaceans that are gathered.</p>
<p>Anthropomorphic Kemali animals include the tiger, siamang or gibbon, dusky-leaf monkey or langur, dog, dugong and the pangolin. Of these, the animal with the most potent force to destroy human lives if hunted or killed is the tiger, followed, surprisingly, by the pangolin.</p>
<p>The pangolin – called tenggiling in Malay and tenggeleng kondok (Proto Malay; Ma’ Betise’) – is the shyest of all mammals of the rainforest, curling into a ball to defend itself against predators. To the Ma’ Betise’ it is an endearing protector of afterbirth, or human placenta, and hence a protector of children. The human placenta is the twin that “died” and needs to be buried close to where the living baby is nursed – or the baby will cry endlessly as if pining for its dead twin.</p>
<p>The pangolin produces only one offspring at a time and nurses its young with milk like humans. It protects the placenta and curls around it to fend off predators. Most importantly, its scales resemble the woven pandanus mat used to wrap human placenta before it is buried. This burial ritual is strictly upheld by the Ma’ Beitse’ and indeed by some rural and even some urban Malays although many may have forgotten the rule of contagion between human and animal.</p>
<p>The Ma’ Betise’ regard the hunting and killing of the pangolin as horrific and ominous, equivalent to acts of barbarism against humans. Its retribution upon human life is illness and death. Hence the zoonotic transmission of Covid-19 from pangolin to humans is plausible, given that it is one of the most widely traded wildlife species in East Asia and China for medicinal purposes and exotic meats.</p>
<p>The hypothesis as reported by Dr Tommy Lam of the University of Hong Kong that pangolins smuggled into China have been found to carry the Covid-19 virus strain is close to an earlier worldview of the Ma’ Betise’, that the pangolin itself releases a mystical force called tenong when it is killed, and this has the power to spread illnesses or death of the most dreaded kind.</p>
