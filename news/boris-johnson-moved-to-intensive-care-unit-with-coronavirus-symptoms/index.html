London (CNN) UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was moved to an intensive care unit Monday after his condition with coronavirus symptoms &ldquo;worsened,&rdquo; his office has said.</p>
<p>Johnson, 55, was first admitted to St Thomas&rsquo; Hospital in London on Sunday evening for what he said were &ldquo;routine tests,&rdquo; adding that he was in &ldquo;good spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the apparent change in the leader&rsquo;s health has shocked the nation, with politicians from his party and the opposition voicing their support for the leader as the country battles a widespread coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the course of this afternoon, the condition of the Prime Minister has worsened and, on the advice of his medical team, he has been moved to the Intensive Care Unit at the hospital,&rdquo; a Downing Street spokesperson said.</p>
<p>According to Downing Street officials, Johnson remains conscious and has been moved to the intensive care unit as a precaution, in case he requires ventilation.</p>
<p>The move strikes a sharp contrast to earlier reports on Johnson&rsquo;s condition: During his period of self-isolation, Downing Street had said that Johnson&rsquo;s symptoms were &ldquo;mild,&rdquo; and on Sunday said his hospitalization was just a &quot; precautionary step .&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prime Minister&rsquo;s spokesperson had said earlier on Monday that Johnson spent a &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; night in hospital, but would not comment on reports Johnson was given oxygen. Officials are no longer describing his symptoms as mild.</p>
<p>Downing Street on Monday said that Johnson has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is the First Secretary of State and the most senior Cabinet minister, to deputize for him where necessary.</p>
<p>Raab chaired Monday&rsquo;s regular morning coronavirus briefing and made a televised statement saying that the government will continue Johnson&rsquo;s direction in responding to the outbreak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The government&rsquo;s business will continue and the Prime Minister is in safe hands with a brilliant team at St Thomas&rsquo;s hospital. And the focus of the government will continue to be on making sure that the Prime Minister&rsquo;s direction, all the plans for making sure that we can defeat coronavirus and can pull the country through this challenge, will be taken forward,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He added there was an &ldquo;incredibly strong team spirit&rdquo; in government behind the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Johnson was moved to the intensive care unit at around 7 p.m., Downing Street said. The decision was made by the leader&rsquo;s medical team after his condition worsened over the afternoon on Monday.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom passed a total death toll of more than 5,000 on Monday, according to Johns Hopkins University, one of the world&rsquo;s highest reported death tolls.</p>
<p>The government has been scrambling to implement widespread testing as evidence grows that people infected could be asymptomatic.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Together we will beat this,&rsquo; Johnson said</p>
<p>Johnson was hospitalized Sunday because he was still suffering coronavirus symptoms 10 days after testing positive for the virus.</p>
<p>The British leader announced on March 27 that he had been infected and was, at the time, suffering mild symptoms including a cough and fever.</p>
<p>At the time, he vowed to continue leading the nation&rsquo;s response to the outbreak and hold meetings via video-conference, saying in a video: &ldquo;Together we will beat this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The leader of the country&rsquo;s House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, said Johnson&rsquo;s admission to intensive care was &ldquo;terrible news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the thoughts and prayers of everyone across the House are with the Prime Minister and his family right now. We all wish him a speedy recovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keir Starmer, the newly elected leader of the main opposition Labour Party said the development was &ldquo;Terribly sad news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the country&rsquo;s thoughts are with the Prime Minister and his family during this incredibly difficult time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Former Prime Minister Theresa May, who was replaced by Johnson in the country&rsquo;s Brexit crisis, also sent her wishes to the leader on Twitter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My thoughts and prayers are with @BorisJohnson and his family as he continues to receive treatment in hospital. This horrific virus does not discriminate. Anyone can get it. Anyone can spread it. Please #StayHomeSaveLives,&rdquo; May wrote.</p>
<p>In a post on Twitter, Johnson had said he was keeping in touch with his team and thanked staff at Britain&rsquo;s National Health Service for taking care of him.</p>
<p>Last night, on the advice of my doctor, I went into hospital for some routine tests as I&rsquo;m still experiencing coronavirus symptoms. I&rsquo;m in good spirits and keeping in touch with my team, as we work together to fight this virus and keep everyone safe. — Boris Johnson #StayHomeSaveLives (@BorisJohnson) April 6, 2020</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump had expressed sympathy after Johnson was initially hospitalized, calling him &ldquo;a strong man and a strong person.&rdquo; In a news conference Sunday night, President Trump said: &ldquo;I want to express our nation&rsquo;s well wishes to Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he wages his own personal fight with the virus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All Americans are praying for him. He&rsquo;s a friend of mine, he&rsquo;s a great gentleman and a great leader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnson&rsquo;s pregnant partner, Carrie Symonds, has also experienced Covid-19 symptoms, and said over the weekend that she is &ldquo;on the mend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnson&rsquo;s secretary of state for health, Matt Hancock, also said on March 27 he had the virus, and the UK&rsquo;s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, announced that he would begin self-isolation after displaying symptoms.</p>
<p>The UK had faced criticism for its slow response to the coronavirus, with Johnson still shaking hands of patients with the virus in hospital just a few weeks ago.

<h3 id="british-prime-minister-boris-johnson-moved-to-intensive-care-as-coronavirus-symptoms-worsen">British Prime Minister Boris Johnson moved to intensive care as coronavirus symptoms worsen</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/03/27/USAT/e586621d-1df7-437b-b230-3fbb5f3782f8-VPC_BORIS_JOHNSON_COVID_DESK_THUMB.jpg?crop=1911,1075,x0,y0&amp;width=1911&amp;height=1075&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" alt="img">
LONDON – British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was moved to an intensive care unit at a London hospital Monday night after his coronavirus symptoms worsened, his office said in a statement.</p>
<p>Johnson, 55, asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab &ldquo;to deputize for him where necessary,&rdquo; according to a Downing Street statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since Sunday evening, the prime minister has been under the care of doctors at St. Thomas&rsquo; Hospital, in London, after being admitted with persistent symptoms of coronavirus,&rdquo; the statement said.</p>
<p>Johnson tested positive for the respiratory illness March 17, the first major world leader to publicly acknowledge having COVID-19. His symptoms include a high temperature and a cough. He is conscious and has not been put on a ventilator.</p>
<p>Earlier Monday, Johnson tweeted that he had a &ldquo;comfortable night&rdquo; and was in &ldquo;good spirits&rdquo; while receiving regular briefings from his Cabinet and government advisers.</p>
<p>Johnson&rsquo;s illness means that he has had to effectively step away from day-to-day governing as Britain, like much of the world, faces the worst public health crisis in a century. Britain has more than 52,000 confirmed cases and more than 5,300 deaths, and the virus could reach its peak in the country as soon as this weekend.</p>
<p>Britain&rsquo;s leader initially gambled that the country&rsquo;s best bet to overcome coronavirus would be to try to get to &ldquo;herd&rdquo; or majority immunity as quickly as possible. The thinking behind this was that it would protect the country in the long term if, as happened in the Spanish flu in 1918, a highly fatal second wave of infections occurred.</p>
<p>Johnson changed tactics in mid-March after researchers at Imperial College London projected that about 250,000 people in Britain would die if &ldquo;chains of transmission&rdquo; for the virus weren&rsquo;t immediately slowed or broken by a lockdown.</p>
<p>Worldwide pandemic:These countries are doing the best, worst jobs fighting coronavirus</p>
<p>Raab, 46, is Britain&rsquo;s first secretary of state and Johnson&rsquo;s de facto deputy. Though Britain does not have a written constitution indicating a clear line of succession, Johnson appointed him to run the country if he is incapacitated or unable to do it. Raab chaired the government&rsquo;s emergency coronavirus meeting Monday.</p>
<p>Like Johnson, Raab was a prominent member of the campaign for Britain to leave the European Union – Brexit. Though he will deputize for Johnson in his absence, it&rsquo;s not immediately clear whether he would automatically, permanently keep the role if Johnson were to die or whether there would need to be a vote to authenticate his premiership.</p>
<p>Britain elects a party, not an individual, meaning that Johnson&rsquo;s ruling Conservative Party would not necessarily be obliged to call an election.

Image caption The PM took part in the clap for carers on Thursday outside No 11 Downing Street</p>
<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been admitted to hospital for tests, 10 days after testing positive for coronavirus, Downing Street has said.</p>
<p>He was taken to a London hospital on Sunday evening with &ldquo;persistent symptoms&rdquo; - including a temperature.</p>
<p>It is said to be a &ldquo;precautionary step&rdquo; taken on the advice of his doctor.</p>
<p>The prime minister remains in charge of the government, but the foreign secretary is expected to chair a coronavirus meeting on Monday morning.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson, 55, spent the night in hospital and is having what has been described as a series of &ldquo;routine tests&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In a statement, a Downing Street spokeswoman said: &ldquo;On the advice of his doctor, the prime minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a precautionary step, as the prime minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus 10 days after testing positive for the virus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She added: &ldquo;The prime minister thanks NHS staff for all of their incredible hard work and urges the public to continue to follow the government&rsquo;s advice to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump began a White House press briefing by sending &ldquo;our nation&rsquo;s well wishes&rdquo; for Mr Johnson&rsquo;s &ldquo;own personal fight with the virus&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All Americans are praying for him. He&rsquo;s a great friend of mine, a great gentleman and a great leader,&rdquo; Mr Trump said, adding that he was sure the prime minister would be fine because he is &ldquo;a strong person&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Labour leader Keir Starmer also wished Mr Johnson well, saying he hoped for a &ldquo;speedy recovery&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Coronavirus is straining the highest levels of government</p>
<p>The prime minister, alongside the Queen, personifies the country&rsquo;s public response to this pandemic.</p>
<p>And Boris Johnson is continuing to personally experience the unpleasant reality of the virus.</p>
<p>Downing Street officials are adamant Mr Johnson remains in charge of the government and is in contact with ministerial colleagues and civil servants.</p>
<p>But the undeniable reality is there is nothing conventional, nothing normal about this - however routine the tests are that the prime minister is receiving.</p>
<p>The coronavirus has repeatedly proven its capacity to turn the far-fetched into reality, over and over again.</p>
<p>Advisers, officials and ministerial colleagues have all been forced to self-isolate.</p>
<p>Covid-19, the illness which the virus causes, is crippling the economy, robbing us of our usual liberties - and now it is straining the personal capacity of those at the highest level of government to respond to it.</p>
<p>Dr Sarah Jarvis, a GP and broadcaster, told the BBC that Mr Johnson would be likely to have his chest X-rayed and his lungs scanned, particularly if he had been struggling for breath.</p>
<p>She said he is also likely to have an electrocardiogram to check his heart&rsquo;s function, as well as tests on his oxygen levels, white blood cell count, and liver and kidney function before he is released from hospital.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson has worked from home since it was announced that he had tested positive for coronavirus on 27 March.</p>
<p>He was last seen in public applauding the NHS and other key workers from his flat in Downing Street on Thursday evening, and chaired a coronavirus meeting remotely on Friday morning.</p>
<p>Also on Friday, the prime minister posted a Twitter video in which said he was still displaying minor symptoms.</p>
<p>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Boris Johnson posted a video message on Friday</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still have a temperature. So in accordance with government advice I must continue my self isolation until that symptom itself goes,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re working clearly the whole time on our programme to beat the virus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Saturday, his pregnant partner Carrie Symonds tweeted that she has spent a week in bed with the main symptoms.</p>
<p>She said she had not been tested for the virus.</p>
<p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock had also tested positive for the virus and returned from self-isolation on Thursday to host the daily Downing Street news conference.</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, has also had to self-isolate after showing symptoms.</p>
<p>Last month, the prime minister&rsquo;s spokesman said if the prime minister was unwell and unable to work, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, as the first secretary of state, would stand in.</p>
<p>The news of Mr Johnson&rsquo;s admission to hospital came shortly after the Queen delivered a rallying message to the nation, saying the UK &ldquo;will succeed&rdquo; in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>In a rare speech, the monarch thanked people for following government rules to stay at home and praised those &ldquo;coming together to help others&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In other developments:</p>
<p>On Sunday the Department of Health said 621 more people had died in hospital in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total death toll to 4,934.</p>
<p>As of 09:00 BST on Sunday, 47,806 people had tested positive for coronavirus, the department said.</p>
