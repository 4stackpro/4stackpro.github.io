<p>Slovakia is to expel three staff from the Russian embassy in the capital, Bratislava, with local media reporting it is related to the murder of a Georgian man in Berlin last year.</p>
<p>Authorities cited the abuse of Slovak visas as reason for the expulsions.</p>
<p>Germany has accused Russia of ordering the murder of the former Chechen rebel Zelimkhan Khangoshvili.</p>
<p>The 40-year-old was shot dead in broad daylight last August in Berlin&rsquo;s Kleiner Tiergarten park.</p>
<p>A Russian national identified as Vadim K has been charged with the murder.</p>
<p>Why are the diplomats being expelled?</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to information from the Slovak intelligence services, their activities were in contradiction with the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations,&rdquo; a Slovak foreign ministry spokesman said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the top of that, there had been an abuse of visas issued at the Slovak general consulate in St Petersburg, and in this connection a serious crime was committed on the territory of another EU and NATO member state,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Local media, as well as investigative website bellingcat.com, have reported that one of those suspected of planning the murder had travelled to the EU on a Slovak visa.</p>
<p>All three must leave the country by 13 August.</p>
<p>Image copyright EPA Image caption Georgian protesters held images of the murdered man outside the German embassy in Tbilisi in September 2019</p>
<p>Russia has said it will respond, but did not give any further details.</p>
<p>In December, Germany expelled two Russian diplomats due to suspicions the Kremlin was involved in the murder. Russia responded by expelling two German diplomats.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the accusation?</p>
<p>In June, Germany&rsquo;s federal prosecutor said Vadim K took the &ldquo;government order to kill&rdquo; in the hope of financial reward or because he shared the desire to &ldquo;kill a political opponent&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Prosecutors say in August 2019 Vadim K flew from Moscow to Paris and from there to Warsaw, before arriving in Berlin, using a passport under the name Vadim S issued by Russian authorities just a month previously.</p>
<p>On 23 August he allegedly came up behind Khangoshvili on a bicycle and fired a shot into his torso using a silenced Glock 26 pistol. Prosecutors say he then fired two more shots into the victim&rsquo;s head as he lay on the ground, killing him.</p>
<p>Vadim K was arrested shortly afterwards and has been in pre-trial detention since.</p>
<p>Russia has previously called accusations it was involved in the crime &ldquo;absolutely groundless&rdquo; and said it had nothing to do with the death.</p>
<p>Who was the victim?</p>
<p>Zelimkhan Khangoshvili was a Georgian citizen of Chechen descent and had reportedly been an asylum-seeker in Germany since 2016.</p>
<p>Image copyright facebook Image caption Khangoshvili (R) was a close associate of Aslan Maskhadov (L), the Chechen rebel leader killed in 2005</p>
<p>He had fought against Russia as the leader of a Chechen militia between 2000 and 2004, and also put together a group of volunteers to defend the enclave of South Ossetia in 2008 on behalf of the Georgian government - although they were never deployed.</p>
<p>Germany&rsquo;s federal prosecutor said Russia had accused him of being a terrorist.

<p><img src="https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/AP_080911011155.jpg?w=1024" alt="img">
Editor’s Note: ARTnews has issued an apology to the family of Rebeccah Blum regretting that the original version of this article covering the shocking news of Blum’s murder hadn’t been more respectful of her and her many accomplishments. Read a separate obituary of Blum, published on July 29, 2020, here.</p>
<p>Saul Fletcher, a British-born, Berlin-based artist, is the subject of an investigation “on the suspicion of murder” of Rebeccah Blum, a well-regarded Berlin-based curator who was found dead last week before Fletcher reportedly committed suicide. Blum’s death was confirmed this week by her daughter, Emma Blum.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to ARTnews, a spokesperson for the Berlin Public Prosecutor’s Office confirmed the news. The statement added, “According to the present state of knowledge, [Fletcher] first killed the woman you named [Rebeccah Blum] and then committed suicide. Investigations into the causes of death and the circumstances of the crime are still ongoing.”</p>
<p>The spokesperson did not provide further details about the investigation, including those that have been circulating in the press surrounding the story, which was first reported by the Daily Mail.</p>
<p>Rebeccah Blum, who was in a romantic relationship with Fletcher, was a well-regarded independent curator in Berlin. She had previously worked as director at ScheiblerMitte, an outpost of Berlin’s Aurel Scheibler gallery. She also ran a fine art management services, Blum Fine Art Management, and an editing service focused on German-to-English translation, Wordsmith. She also worked for over 10 years as the European representative for David Nolan Gallery in New York. Read a full obituary for Blum.</p>
<p>“I love her so much and I miss her so terribly,” Emma Blum, her daughter, wrote on Instagram. “She was just by taken from me, without warning and in such a violent way by one of the people she loved. I can never forgive this and I can never forget this. I want her name to be remembered and nobody else’s.”</p>
<p>The three galleries that represented Fletcher at the time of his death—Anton Kern Gallery in New York, Knust Kunz Gallery Editions in Munich, and Grice Bench in Los Angeles—provided to ARTnews a joint statement regarding the reports: “We are devastated, appalled, and shocked by the tragic loss of Rebeccah Blum and Saul Fletcher. We are all grief-stricken and confused. We offer our deepest condolences to their families and together are offering our support and help.”</p>
<p>Fletcher first came to prominence in the late 1990s when he began showing with New York’s Anton Kern Gallery. His work has appeared in major international exhibitions as well, including the 30th Bienal de São Paulo in 2012, the 4th Berlin Biennale in 2006, and the 2004 Carnegie International in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Update, July 30, 2020: This article has been updated to include a statement from the Berlin Public Prosecutor’s Office confirming that Saul Fletcher is a suspect in the investigation into Rebeccah Blum’s murder.

<p><img src="https://dmdlnu87i51n1.cloudfront.net/v1/uk/ckda4pz2700093g5k8863k0mv/0x103:1773x931/1200x630/blum_2.jpg" alt="img">

<p>Rebeccah Blum, a noted arts curator, and Saul Fletcher, a British photographer, have died in Berlin. Although it has not yet been officially verified, multiple media sources reported Blum, 53, was murdered by Fletcher, 52, at his Berlin flat. He is believed to have subsequently committed suicide at Blum’s country home in Brandenburg, west of Berlin. Their bodies were discovered on 22 July.</p>
<p>Fletcher, whose friends say suffered from serious mental health issues, and Blum had been in an on-off relationship for many years. Berlin authorities confirmed that they are not seeking anyone else in conjunction with the case, and Blum&rsquo;s daughter confirmed her mother&rsquo;s death on social media.</p>
<p>Blum, the mother of two children, was born in 1967 and was raised close to Philadelphia. She studied art history in Washington DC before moving to San Francisco to work in an art gallery, supporting herself with restaurant work.</p>
<p>Blum moved to the German city of Düsseldorf in 1992, at the age of 25, before settling in Berlin in 1995, where she co-founded the non-profit arts organisation Base e.V. and the independent publishing platform txt.de. Blum became a director of the ScheiblerMitte gallery Aurel Scheibler in 2007 before founding her own art management firm, Blum Fine Art Management. As a freelancer, she supported the Berlin office of publisher Verlag der Kunst amid countless other projects.</p>
<p>The Berlin-based Mexican artist Julieta Aranda, a friend and colleague, says in an Instagram post that she pays tribute to Blum on behalf of the Berlin artistic community. Aranda remembers “a woman with a name, a profession, a rich life and a precious smile that we want to share with everyone. We are here to express our condolences and sorrow, to pay respect to her achievements and to honour her memory, as the brilliant woman she was and as a dear friend for many. We want to recall her name, and firmly condemn the brutality that took her life away, a too well known violence that needs to stop.”</p>
<p>Emma Blum, 22, one of Rebeccah’s two daughters, used Instagram to remember a committed mother, a ceaselessly inventive cook and an adventurous and enthusiastic lover of life “who supported me through every crisis, who raised me and loved me unconditionally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love her so much and I miss her so terribly,” Blum’s daughter wrote. “She was just taken from me, without warning and in such a violent way by one of the people she loved. I can never forgive this and I can never forget this. I want her name to be remembered and nobody else’s.”</p>
<p>Fletcher was born in 1967 to a working class family in the village of Barton-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire, and spent his early adulthood ferrying coal on cargo ships in Hull harbour. His earliest photographs, made after he joined an amateur photography club, were of North Lincolnshire&rsquo;s docks.</p>
<p>After moving to London in the early 1990s, he set up a makeshift studio in Crouch End and began to explore a form of carefully constructed portraiture, of himself and others. He supported himself by assisting the photographer Juergen Teller.</p>
<p>Fletcher moved to Berlin around the turn of the millennium. Those close to him remembered a warm but erratic man who often seemed happy and content but, at the depths of depression, would rarely leave the confines of his home or studio, where much of his work was created.</p>
<p>Most of his photographs used the walls of his studio as a canvas or backdrop for self-portraits. He would arrange found objects, vegetation, dead animals, Polaroids, paintings, drawings or pages torn from his notebooks, before photographing the composition, or himself in the midst of the composition, with an obsessive repetition.</p>
<p>After gaining representation from New York’s Anton Kern Gallery, Fletcher gained critical recognition for shows at London’s Courtauld Gallery; the Atlanta Contemporary Art Center; the Hessel Museum of Art, New York; MUMOK, Vienna; and the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, among others. He gained some populist fame for his visual work for the London-based alt rock band Placebo and, recently, a friendship with the actor Brad Pitt.</p>
<p>Fletcher’s last solo exhibition, titled Four Loom Weave, went on show at Anton Kern Gallery, New York, in Autumn 2018. Fletcher told the Financial Times at the time: &ldquo;I use whatever I have to hand, trying to create something, trying to make something good out of something bad.”</p>
<p>Fletcher’s most recent artwork, titled Don’t Let the Darkness Get You Down, is part of the exhibition Untitled 2020 on show at Punta della Dogana, Venice, until 13 December 2020.

<h3 id="russia-hopes-to-exchange-information-with-germany-about-tiergarten-murder--lavrov">&ldquo;Russia hopes to exchange information with Germany about Tiergarten murder — Lavrov&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://phototass3.cdnvideo.ru/width/1200_4ce85301/tass/m2/en/uploads/i/20200811/1278651.jpg" alt="img">
MOSCOW, August 11. /TASS/. Russia has responded to all inquiries from Germany regarding the murder in Berlin’s Tiergarten and would like to receive further explanations from the German side, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Tuesday following talks with his German counterpart Heiko Maas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our relevant agencies sent everything they could to our German colleagues,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We would also like to receive confirmation or any proof of the claims that the German Public Prosecutor General’s office made when it said that Russia is directly involved in this murder. We are yet to hear any specific answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In turn, Maas stressed that court is now studying the case. &ldquo;We, the German government, agreed to wait until the court’s decision,&rdquo; he stressed. &ldquo;The way it will classify this act will lay grounds for us to come up with our reaction. And if [Russia’s complicity] will be underlined in the court decision, we will of course react accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Georgian citizen, 40, was killed in Tiergarten on August 23, 2019. The Berlin prosecution reported that it detained a suspect the same day. According to the agency, the suspect is a 49-year-old Russian national identified as Vadim K. On June 18, 2020, he was officially indicted. The German Public Prosecutor General’s office is coming from the premise that &ldquo;at some point state bodies of the Russian central government ordered the indicted person to eliminate the Georgian citizen.&rdquo; The Russian side has repeatedly denied claims that Moscow was complicit in the Berlin murder.

<h3 id="former-nazi-guard-is-convicted-in-one-of-germanys-last-holocaust-trials">&ldquo;Former Nazi Guard Is Convicted in One of Germany’s Last Holocaust Trials&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/23/world/23germany01/23germany01-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
The German authorities have intensified their efforts in recent years to hold to account men and women, most of them now over 90, who played smaller roles in helping the Nazis round up and murder Europe’s Jews in their network of concentration and death camps.</p>
<p>Throughout the Cold War, these people were overlooked by a justice system that demanded evidence of direct involvement of a Nazi-era crime in order to bring charges against a perpetrator.</p>
<p>As the survivors grew older a reunited Germany began emphasizing the importance of remembrance and atonement, giving a prominent place to a Holocaust memorial in the heart of its new capital and establishing funds worth millions to compensate long overlooked victims of Nazi crimes.</p>
<p>Over the past decades, the courts, too, have shifted their perspective, following landmark rulings in 2011 and 2015 that established that individuals who played supporting roles in Nazi crimes could be convicted on the argument of association.</p>
<p>Last week, another former guard from Stutthof, age 95, was charged with similar crimes.</p>
<p>Because Mr. Dey was only 17 when he began his guard duties, he was tried as a juvenile. Prosecutors had sought a three-year prison sentence for his role at the camp, where he was tasked with making sure that none of the inmates, mostly Polish Jews and political prisoners, escaped.</p>
<p>More than 60,000 people — roughly half of whom were Jews — are believed to have died or been killed at the camp, which was the first to be established by the Nazi regime outside of Germany’s borders. Located in the small Polish town of Sztutowo, it served as a prison camp after the invasion of Poland in 1939. Gas chambers were put into use in 1944, and the camp was one of the last to be liberated.
