Anna Sayburn London</p>
<p>Experts have criticised an unpublished modelling study released to the media on Tuesday 24 March that suggested that half the UK population might already have been infected with covid-19.1</p>
<p>They emphasised that even if the modelling turned out to be correct it would not change the current public health advice to reduce the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>The study, from the Nuffield Department of Medicine at the University of Oxford, used data on the number of deaths and reported cases in the early stages of the epidemic in Italy and the UK. The researchers used mathematical modelling to estimate infection rates by fitting a “susceptible—infected—recovered” model of epidemics to the numbers of deaths seen.</p>
<p>The modelling made assumptions about the proportion of the population at risk of death or severe illness, the basic reproduction number of the virus, the period of time during which people are infected, and the time from infection to death</p>
<p>The researchers showed outcomes generated from different assumptions, including a reproduction number of 2.25 and 2.75, and setting the proportion of the population at risk of death or severe disease at 1% or 0.1%.</p>
<p>They said that the UK data indicated that by 19 March (15 days after the first reported UK death) between 36% and 68% of the UK population would have been infected, depending on the assumptions used. In addition, their figures suggested that the current epidemic “should have an approximate duration of two to three months,” they said.</p>
<p>Commentators pointed to a number of “key failings” that may undermine the study, which has not yet been peer reviewed or published in a journal.</p>
<p>Neil Ferguson, director of the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, was asked about the study when he appeared before a parliamentary select committee hearing on 25 March. It was his analysis that showed that without physical distancing there would be 260 000 deaths in the UK from covid-19 and that led to change in government policy.2</p>
<p>Ferguson said, “We’ve been analysing data from a number of Italian villages at the epicentre for the last few weeks where they did a viral swab on absolutely everybody in the village at different stages of the outbreak.3 And we can compare that with official case numbers, and those data all point to the fact that we are nowhere near the Gupta [the Oxford analysis] scenario in terms of the extent of the infection.”</p>
<p>Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said that the simple model “assumes complete mixing of the population,” which is “almost always wrong” at a country level. “We do not all have an equal random chance of meeting every other person in the UK.” He said that reproduction number was a “very clumsy” measure of how disease spreads, which is likely to change over time. He also criticised the researchers’ assumption that only a very small proportion of the population was at risk of being admitted to hospital because of the disease.</p>
<p>“This is a big assumption and it is far too early in the epidemic to know what this value is,” he said.</p>
<p>The researchers and the experts agree on the need for serological studies in areas affected by the epidemic. Testing serological immune response would show how many people have been exposed to the virus.</p>
<p>The researchers said in the study, “Urgent development and assessment of such tests should be followed by rapid implementation at scale to provide real-time data.”</p>
<p>James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute at the University of Oxford, backed the call for widespread testing. “This will be necessary to test the paper’s hypothesis. The need for, the science behind, and plans to implement such serological testing are accepted and moving forward across the globe,” he said. He warned that this would “take time.”</p>
<p>He added, “At this moment, nothing in [this] paper calls for or could be used to justify any change in current policy; that is, unless we all follow the current government advice on social distancing, the UK will see many thousands of deaths that could have been avoided.”</p>
<p>Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said that the possibility that large numbers of people have already been infected but remain asymptomatic was “hypothesis rather than fact.”</p>
<p>He said that, if it were correct, “that would not change current policy in the UK, which is focused on reducing the short term impact of the epidemic on the NHS.” It would, however, “change enormously our long term expectations” and suggests that the threat of covid-19 worldwide would diminish in coming months.

<p><img src="https://i.insider.com/5e15b87fb2e66a6e234dc472?width=1200&amp;format=jpeg" alt="img">
The UK&rsquo;s original plan to deal with the coronavirus by achieving &ldquo;herd immunity&rdquo; within the population, would have been &ldquo;catastrophic&rdquo; and caused &ldquo;a lot of death,&rdquo; President Donald Trump has said.</p>
<p>The UK reportedly abandoned its original plan for the UK population to achieve &lsquo;herd immunity&rsquo; after experts warned it would result in up to 250,000 deaths.</p>
<p>Trump said a similar strategy in the US would result in millions dying across the country.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson&rsquo;s government is under growing pressure domestically to defend its lack of preparation for the current crisis.</p>

<p>Donald Trump has said that Boris Johnson&rsquo;s abandoned plan for creating &ldquo;herd immunity&rdquo; to the coronavirus in the UK would have been &ldquo;catastrophic&rdquo; and caused &ldquo;a lot of death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The president said that the UK government&rsquo;s original coronavirus strategy plan, which involved allowing the virus to spread in order to achieve resistance to the virus in the population, would have caused millions of deaths if adopted in the US.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you remember, they were looking at that concept - I guess it&rsquo;s a concept if you don&rsquo;t mind death, a lot of death - but they were looking at that in the UK, remember,&rdquo; Trump told a White House press briefing on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all of a sudden they went hard the other way because they started seeing things that weren&rsquo;t good, so they put themselves in a little bit of a problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;It would have been very catastrophic I think if that would have happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Watch Trump label original UK coronavirus plan &lsquo;catastrophic&rsquo;</p>
<p>At the same briefing, Dr Deborah Birx, the White House&rsquo;s coronavirus response coordinator, said the UK had a dangerously low number of ventilators, which are respiratory machines being used to treat patients suffering from the worst effects of the virus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are worried about groups all around the globe,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if you heard the report this morning, there are 8,000 ventilators in the UK.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you translate that to United States, that would be like the United States having less than 40,000 ventilators. We have five times that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trump last week claimed that Boris Johnson pleaded with the president for the US to send ventilators to the UK.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before he even said hello, he said, &lsquo;We need ventilators,'&rdquo; Trump told reporters.</p>
<p>The president&rsquo;s comments are politically embarrassing for Johnson, who is currently struggling to answer questions about why it is testing for the coronavirus at a significantly lower level than other developed nations.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson initially resisted calls to close schools or mass gatherings even as deaths in other European countries including Italy surged.</p>
<p>The comparatively relaxed measures reflected the fact Downing Street was pursuing a strategy of &ldquo;herd immunity,&rdquo; according to multiple reports, a concept which the UK&rsquo;s chief science advisor openly discussed in a television interview.</p>
<p>However, scientists advising the government subsequently warned that the UK&rsquo;s strategy could result in up to 250,000 deaths, which persuaded the UK to change course abruptly and announce strict lockdown measures in line with most other European countries.</p>
<p>Johnson&rsquo;s government is under growing pressure to explain its slow response to the outbreak and its lack of testing and vital medical equipment.

<h3 id="misleading-and-alarming-behind-sheffields-coronavirus-figures">&lsquo;Misleading and alarming&rsquo;: behind Sheffield&rsquo;s coronavirus figures</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6175ca5e4206d49fe0138a00c233bf098ae5a73/0_277_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=29150e2cca9696316f68654708eb3398" alt="img">
For residents of Sheffield, the daily roll call of coronavirus cases has made for alarming reading. On Wednesday the Steel City had the fourth highest number in any local authority in England (541), behind Surrey (571), Hampshire (652) and Birmingham (734).</p>
<p>The figures have led some to worry that Sheffield – home to 575,400 people, compared with Birmingham’s 1.1 million – has become a hotbed of disease. Research from the Centre for Cities on Tuesday prompted further consternation by breaking the data down by population size and reporting that Sheffield was second only to London in terms of cases per 100,000 people.</p>
<p>But local hospitals and public health experts are playing down the statistics. “The figures are misleading and alarming. People look at them and think, ‘Oh gosh, we’re all going to get it’ and ‘Sheffield is a high-risk area’, but that’s not true,” said Dr Andrew Lee, a reader of global public health at Sheffield University and executive director of primary care and population health at NHS Vale of York clinical commissioning group.</p>
<p>So far, 21 patients have died in hospitals in Sheffield, while the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals trust, which operates the city’s two big hospitals, the Northern General and the Royal Hallamshire, says they are currently treating “a comparatively low level” of coronavirus patients.</p>
<p>Talking in his academic capacity, Lee despaired at the Public Health England daily dashboard, which lists the number of cases in each local authority in England. “That tracker is really misleading. In some senses they should just turn it off because everywhere is testing differently. So you can’t compare place A with place B with place C. And it’s not like you’re just following a score because the interpretation of those numbers is really complicated,” he said.</p>
<p>The main reason Sheffield has such a high number of cases is that it has been testing more people and testing earlier, according to Lee. The Sheffield Teaching Hospitals trust took the decision to test all symptomatic NHS workers 11 days before most other areas, the Guardian understands.</p>
<p>From 19 March, any Northern General staff with symptoms were instructed to phone occupational health and – assuming they had their own transport and weren’t going to use public transport – were given an appointment for a test, according to a medic from the Northern General. That hospital has a larger than average in-house testing laboratory, which when it opened in 2013 was able to process more than 10m tests a year. And at the start of March, local authorities set up a temporary drive-through community testing facility just off the Sheffield Parkway where members of the public who had visited affected countries could be tested without leaving their cars.</p>
<p>It was only this week that the rest of the NHS was ordered by Sir Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, to start testing staff, starting with those working in critical care, emergency departments and ambulance services.</p>
<p>Healthcare workers were disproportionately likely to get infected, said Lee. “If you look at what happened with Mers-Covid, when they had that big outbreak in South Korea some years ago, most of the cases were in health workers. And the same with Sars in 2003-4. It just reflects the fact healthcare workers have high-risk, prolonged contacts with patients. Healthcare workers are not representative of the wider public.”</p>

<p>The Northern General medic said the widespread testing in Sheffield meant that infected staff stayed at home while those who tested negative could come in to work. “I know five or six people in my team were sure they had it and tested negative, and yet a few others who were adamant it was just a cold turned out to have coronavirus,” they said.</p>
<p>Another reason for Sheffield’s high figures is that the Royal Hallamshire is home to one of England’s few specialist NHS infection centres. That is why, when the first coronavirus patients arrived in the UK from the cruise ship the Diamond Princess, two were sent there.</p>
<p>In addition, Sheffield has experienced a few “Covid clusters”, according to a spokeswoman at the hospitals trust. “I know we did have some clusters of people that we tested in the community, which had a wide contract testing base, which made the Sheffield figures look larger,” she said. These clusters were largely groups returning from Italy and other infected regions, she added.</p>
<p>She said the trust saw two million patients each year – four times the population of Sheffield – but that they were not currently treating many Covid-19 patients.</p>

<p>”The number of patients fluctuates each day, but we are at a comparatively low level at present. We currently have capacity in our ITU [intensive treatment unit] and HDU [high dependency unit] and have plans in place to increase capacity as the number of cases rise,” she said.</p>
<p>“It’s a bit like watching the tide go out before the tsunami comes in,” said the Northern General medic. “We are not overwhelmed yet, but we have all seen what has happened in London and we know what’s coming. We are hoping the lockdown will make it not as bad, but it depends who you talk to how much you believe whether we are going to be saved or not.”
