<p>As the news grows steadily more grim along the Indian and Chinese border in Eastern Ladakh near the Line of Actual Control, where 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a skirmish with Chinese forces, triggering nationwide grieving, netizens from Taiwan and Hong Kong have come out in India’s support.</p>
<p>An illustration went viral on Hong Kong social media platform lihkg, which showed Rama aiming an arrow at a Chinese dragon beside the words, “We conquer, we kill”. The image was picked up by Taiwan News, which made it their ‘Photo of the day’. Following this, it went viral on Indian Twitter, making #Taiwan one of the top-trending hashtags briefly.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Taiwan” read a tweet by one Twitter user, which was then retweeted thousands of times.</p>
<p>A post with the image was one of the top threads on lihkg, with many users sharing pro-India images, and several posts on the platform in support of India. Some pointed out India’s historic role as part of the military police in Hong Kong during the British-ruled period of the island, as well as how the Indian Army defended Hong Kong against the Japanese during the Battle of Hong Kong in 1941.</p>
<p>Netizens from Taiwan and Hong Kong alike took to social media to express their support for India in the clash with China. Curiously, many posts replying to the image spoke of a &lsquo;Milk Tea Alliance&rsquo;. The Milk Tea Alliance is an informal term used on social media to reflect solidarity among countries in Asia that have a custom of adding milk to their tea—the notable exception in the region being China—where black tea is more popular. With India, Hong Kong and Taiwan each known for their milk tea, the concept of the milk tea alliance also reflects a larger anti-China sentiment in such countries.</p>
<p>If this tiny island can speak for us, Why cnt a country of 1.3billion, worlds 4th strongest army, 3rd largest economy, speak up for them! Time to junk one China policy! — Arjun Patel (@arjunnpatel) June 17, 2020</p>
<p>The internet support comes as tensions between Taiwan and China have been growing, with Chinese warplanes flying inside Taiwanese airspace for the 4th time in two weeks on Wednesday. The war of words between Taiwan and China has intensified of late, with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen&rsquo;s assertion early in 2020 that Taiwan was an independent country and that Beijing must face this reality. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan&rsquo;s exclusion from the WHO also sparked calls for WHO reform and greater accountability of the role of China in spreading the virus across the world.</p>
<p>I am a Hongkonger. In WW2, brave soldiers of British Indian Army sacrificed themselves trying to save Hong Kong from hands of evil fascists. Thank you, Indians!#HKStandsWithIndia #IndiaChinaFaceoff</p>
<p>撐印度文宣2/3 — Zabic Leung (@ZabicL) June 17, 2020</p>
<p>Relations between India and Taiwan have been warming. Several Indians reportedly participated in a motor rally in Taipei on June 13 to thank the country for its successful contamination of the coronavirus. In May, two BJP MPs virtually attended the swearing-in of Taiwan&rsquo;s re-elected president Tsai Ing-wen. That month, Taiwan also donated one million masks to India to help in the national effort against the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Hong Kong too has seen its issues with China flare-up of late, as protests that raged through 2019 gradually resumed after a brief lull during the peak of the coronavirus pandemic in the city. A new bill by Chinese lawmakers that makes it illegal to insult the Chinese national anthem had sparked a new wave of protests, as had a controversial new national security bill.</p>
<p>While 2019’s protests were initially sparked over a bill that would allow for Hong Kongers to be extradited to China to face much-harsher prosecution in certain instances, they later snowballed into a larger pro-democracy movement, in response to accusations of police brutality against the Hong Kong police.</p>
<p>While the extradition bill was eventually shelved, the new national security bill could end up having the same effect, as a Hong Kong lawmaker recently pointed out that it too could be used to extradite Hong Kongers to China to face punishment.

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve said Monday that it will begin purchasing corporate bonds as part of a previously-announced plan to ensure companies can borrow through the bond market during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The program will purchase existing bonds on the open market, as opposed to newly-issued debt. The central bank said will seek to build a “broad and diversified” portfolio that will mimic a bond-market index. The bonds will have to be from highly-rated, investment-grade companies, or firms that fit that description before the viral outbreak struck.</p>
<p>The announcement boosted the stock market, which was already rebounding from early losses. The Dow Jones rose 0.8% in afternoon trading.</p>
<p>The Fed&rsquo;s purchases should hold down corporate bond yields, making it cheaper for companies to borrow. But by also lowering the return from investing in those bonds, the Fed&rsquo;s actions will likely encourage investors to shift money from corporate bonds to stocks in hopes of achieving a higher return.</p>
<p>When the Fed announced its bond-purchase program in March, few companies were able to issue bonds. Banks and other large investors were dumping assets in favor of cash. New research has found that simply by announcing the program, the Fed was able to encourage more bond trading and improve the market&rsquo;s efficiency.</p>
<p>The Fed has said it will buy up to $750 billion of corporate bonds and exchange-traded funds made up of corporate bonds. The Treasury Department has provided the Fed $75 billion of taxpayer funds to offset any losses that occur from the investments.

<p>PARIS (AP) — “Do as I say, but not as I do” was the message many British saw in the behavior of Prime Minister Boris Johnson&rsquo;s key aide, who traveled hundreds of miles with coronavirus symptoms during the country&rsquo;s lockdown.</p>
<p>While Dominic Cummings has faced calls for his firing but support from his boss over his journey from London to the northern city of Durham in March, few countries seem immune to the perception that politicians and top officials are bending the rules that their own governments wrote during the pandemic.</p>
<p>From U.S. President Donald Trump to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, global decision-makers have frequently set bad examples, whether it&rsquo;s refusing to wear masks or breaking confinement rules aimed at protecting their citizens from COVID-19.</p>
<p>Some are punished when they’re caught, others publicly repent, while a few just shrug off the violations during a pandemic that has claimed more than 350,000 lives worldwide.</p>
<p>Here are some notable examples:</p>
<p>NEW ZEALAND HEALTH MINISTER CALLS HIMSELF AN “IDIOT”</p>
<p>In April, New Zealand’s health minister was stripped of some of his responsibilities after defying the country’s strict lockdown measures. David Clark drove 19 kilometers (12 miles) to the beach to take a walk with his family as the government was asking people to make historic sacrifices by staying at home.</p>
<p>“I’ve been an idiot, and I understand why people will be angry with me,” Clark said. He also earlier acknowledged driving to a park near his home to go mountain biking.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said normally she would fire Clark but that the country couldn’t afford massive disruption in its health sector while it was fighting the virus. Instead, she stripped Clark of his role as associate finance minister and demoting him to the bottom of the Cabinet rankings.</p>
<p>MEXICO’S LEADER SHAKES HANDS</p>
<p>Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said it pained him not to embrace supporters during tours because of health risks, but he made a remarkable exception in March, shaking hands with the elderly mother of imprisoned drug kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzmán. Asked about shaking her hand when the government was urging citizens to practice social distancing, López Obrador said it would have been disrespectful not to.</p>
<p>“It’s very difficult humanly,” he said. “I’m not a robot.”</p>
<p>AMERICA’S PANDEMIC POLITICS</p>
<p>The decision to wear a mask in public is becoming a political statement in the U.S. It&rsquo;s been stoked by Trump — who didn’t wear a mask during an appearance at a facility making them — and some other Republicans, who have questioned the value of masks. This month, pandemic politics shadowed Trump’s trip to Michigan as he toured a factory making lifesaving medical devices. He did not publicly wear a face covering despite a warning from the state’s top law enforcement officer that refusing to do so might lead to a ban on his return.</p>
<p>Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, meanwhile, wore a mask along with his wife, Jill, as they laid a wreath Monday at a Delaware veterans’ memorial — his first public appearance since mid-March. Trump later retweeted Fox News analyst Brit Hume’s criticism of Biden for wearing a mask in public.</p>
<p>Vice President Mike Pence was criticized for not wearing a mask while on a visit to the Mayo Clinic.</p>
<p>NETANYAHU’S PASSOVER HOLIDAY</p>
<p>While the rest of Israel was instructed not to gather with their extended families for traditional Passover Seder in April, Netanyahu and President Reuven Rivlin hosted their adult children for the festive holiday meal, drawing fierce criticism on social media. Israeli television showed a photo of Avner Netanyahu, the premier’s younger son, attending the Seder at his father&rsquo;s official residence.</p>
<p>Benjamin Netanyahu later apologized in a televised address, saying he should have adhered more closely to the regulations.</p>
<p>THE FRENCH EXCEPTION</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron also has been inconsistent with masks, leaving the French public confused. Although Macron has sometimes appeared in a mask for visits at hospitals and schools, it&rsquo;s a different story in the Elysee presidential palace and for speeches. During a visit to a Paris hospital on May 15, Macron initially wore a mask to chat with doctors but then removed it to talk with union workers.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Christophe Castaner also faced criticism this month for huddling with dozens of mask-makers in a factory for a photo where everyone removed their masks.</p>
<p>PUTIN’S DIFFERENT APPROACH</p>
<p>The only time Russian President Vladimir Putin wore protective gear in public was on March 24, when he visited a top coronavirus hospital in Moscow. Before donning a hazmat suit, Putin shook hands with Dr. Denis Protsenko, the head of the hospital. Neither wore masks or gloves, and a week later, Protsenko tested positive for the virus. That raised questions about Putin’s health, but the Kremlin said he was fine.</p>
<p>Putin has since held at least seven face-to-face meetings, according to the Kremlin website. He and others didn’t wear masks during those meetings, and Putin also didn’t cover his face for events marking Nazi Germany’s defeat in World War II.</p>
<p>When asked why Putin doesn’t wear a mask during public appearances, spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the Kremlin has a different approach to protecting the president’s health.</p>
<p>“When it comes to public events, we ask medical workers to test all the participants in advance,” Peskov told reporters.</p>
<p>PUERTO RICO OFFICIAL’S INCONSISTENT MESSAGE</p>
<p>Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vázquez was criticized for not always wearing a mask despite holding new conferences ordering people to cover their face outside their homes and inside businesses. A member of the opposition Popular Democratic Party also filed a police complaint last week against members of Vázquez’s New Progressive Party, alleging they violated a curfew by gathering to inaugurate the party’s new headquarters. Police are investigating the incident, which angered many Puerto Ricans.</p>
<p>SCOTTISH MEDICAL OFFICIAL TAKES THE LOW ROAD</p>
<p>Scotland’s chief medical officer, Dr. Catherine Calderwood, broke her own rules and traveled to her second home during lockdown in April. She faced blowback after photos emerged of her and her family visiting Earlsferry in Fife, which is more than an hour’s drive from her main home in Edinburgh. She apologized and resigned.</p>
<p>“I did not follow the advice I’m giving to others,” Calderwood said. “I am truly sorry for that. I’ve seen a lot of the comments from … people calling me a hypocrite.”</p>
<p>JAPAN’S GAMBLING SCANDAL</p>
<p>A top Japanese prosecutor was reprimanded and later resigned this month after defying a stay-at-home recommendation in a gambling scandal.</p>
<p>Hiromu Kurokawa, the country’s No. 2 prosecutor who headed the Tokyo High Prosecutors’ Office, acknowledged that he wasn&rsquo;t social distancing when he played mahjong for money at a newspaper reporter&rsquo;s home twice in May. Japan didn’t enforce a stay-at-home recommendation, but his case outraged the public because many were following social distancing measures.</p>
<p>ITALIAN PRESS CONFERENCE CRITICISM</p>
<p>At a March news conference to open a COVID-19 field hospital in Milan’s old convention center, photographers and video journalists were pushed into corners that did not allow proper spacing. Only text reporters were given seating in line with regulations. The Codacons consumer protection group announced it would file a complaint with prosecutors in Milan.</p>
<p>“What should have been a moment of great happiness and pride for Lombardy and Italy was transformed into a surreal event, where in violation of the anti-gathering rules, groups of crowds formed,’’ Codacons said.</p>
<p>SOUTH AFRICA’S RULE-BREAKING DINNER</p>
<p>In April, Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams was placed on special leave for two months and forced to apologize by President Cyril Ramaphosa after she violated stay-at-home regulations. Ramaphosa directed police to investigate after a photo emerged on social media of Ndabeni-Abrahams and several others having a meal at the home of former deputy minister of higher education Mduduzi Manana.</p>
<p>SPANISH HOSPITAL CEREMONY INVESTIGATED</p>
<p>Madrid’s regional and city officials sparked controversy when they gathered on May 1 for a ceremony shuttering a massive field hospital at a convention center. Eager to appear in the final photo of a facility credited with treating nearly 4,000 mild COVID-19 patients, dozens of officials didn&rsquo;t follow social distancing rules. Spain’s restrictions banned more than 10 people at events like the one that honored nurses and doctors. The central government opened an investigation, and Madrid regional chief Isabel Díaz Ayuso apologized. She said officials “got carried away by the uniqueness of the moment.”</p>
<p>Former Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy also defied strict stay-at-home orders, with a television station filming him power walking around in northern Madrid. The Spanish prosecutor’s office is investigating whether Rajoy, who was premier from 2011 to 2018, should be fined.</p>
<p>INDIAN CRICKET GAME CRITICIZED</p>
<p>In India, a top leader of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party drew flak last weekend after playing a game of cricket. Manoj Tiwari, also a member of India’s parliament, said he followed social distancing rules during the game. Videos circulating on social media showed Tiwati without a mask. He was also seen taking selfies with people.</p>
<p>LEADERS WHO FOLLOW THE RULES</p>
<p>Some leaders are setting a good example, including Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. Media jokingly called him the most relaxed politician in the world after he was photographed queuing at a supermarket this month, wearing a mask and following social distancing measures. The photo was widely shared on social media.</p>
<p>Another rule-follower is Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who did not visit his ill 96-year-old mother in a nursing home during the last eight weeks of her life because of coronavirus restrictions. He only came to her bedside during her final hours this month.</p>
<p>“The prime minister has respected all guidelines,” according to a statement read by a spokesman. “The guidelines allow for family to say goodbye to dying family members in the final stage. And as such the prime minister was with her during her last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>NEW YORK (AP) — It had been a tense, challenging Thursday evening in the riot-torn Twin Cities for Associated Press photographer Julio Cortez. Midnight was fast approaching, and so was a lone protester carrying an upside-down U.S. flag.</p>
<p>Aware of the flag’s power as a visual symbol, Cortez followed the man down the rubble-strewn street and took a photograph that soon rocketed around the world – the protester silhouetted against the flames of a burning liquor store, the light of the fire glowing through the fabric of the flag.</p>
<p>Taken at 11:59 p.m. and transmitted a few moments later, it swiftly went viral — perhaps the most indelible image yet of the racial divisions and violent protests flaring after the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck.</p>
<p>TV networks featured it on their newscasts. Twitter at one point used it to lead its “What’s Happening” page. Multiple commentators on social media depicted it as “Picture of the Year.”</p>
<p>Cortez had sensed an opportunity as soon as he saw the flag-bearer approach – photojournalists know that flags have distinctive symbolic power, as evidenced by the famous photograph of flag-raising Marines at Iwo Jima.</p>
<p>“I didn’t think of it as a contest winner,” Cortez said of his photo. “I thought it told a story.”</p>
<p>Cortez, based in Baltimore for the AP, had arrived in the Twin Cities on Thursday afternoon, along with New York-based AP photographer John Minchillo.</p>
<p>They spent about three hours covering unrest in St. Paul, then shifted to Minneapolis after hearing there was a new outbreak of trouble at a police precinct house there.</p>
<p>“We’d been working that scene for about two hours when this particular moment happened,” Cortez said. “The police abandoned the precinct — there was just chaos and fires and people throwing stuff.”</p>
<p>Minchillo then relocated, having been asked to provide some video footage. Cortez stayed near the precinct house, though growing uneasy as word spread that a gas line had been severed and might explode.</p>
<p>“When I saw the man walking up with the flag, I started getting closer,” he said. “I could tell this was going to be very visual, so I just followed along. I wanted to silhouette him, so I waited for him to walk where it was burning.”</p>
<p>David Ake, AP’s director of photography, said Cortez’ photo was powerful on many levels.</p>
<p>“The upside-down flag is the universal signal of distress and is framed perfectly and backlit by the flames in the background adding to the urgency of the distress,” he said “One foot in either direction and the image would lose that backlight and lose the impact.”</p>
<p>Ake also noted that the person holding the flag is unrecognizable.</p>
<p>“It could be any person of any age, race, or gender,” he said. “It could be you or me.”</p>
<p>Cortez has been with the AP nearly 10 years, including a previous posting in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Among his many assignments, he remembers a similar feeling of uncertainty and risk covering the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 when the city was locked down due to a manhunt for the suspects.

<p><img src="https://talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-Facts-About-Feng-E.png" alt="img">
Get ready to be wowed by another young musical prodigy on America’s Got Talent. Feng E is a 12-year-old ukulele player whose talent will blow you away. He’ll be appearing on this week’s show.</p>
<p>Feng E is from Taiwan and is known for playing covers of popular and classic songs on his ukulele. His name is written as 馮羿 in his native language. Read on to find out more about this impressive talent, and check out a few of his performances.</p>
<p>5 Facts About ‘AGT’ Ukulele Player Feng E</p>
<ol>
<li>Feng E started playing the ukulele at age 5.</li>
</ol>
<p>He’s said that his father told him to learn to play the ukulele to give him more flexible fingers and hopefully improve his handwriting. He turned out to have an amazing talent for the instrument, and has been playing ever since.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Video of him playing on the street went viral.</li>
</ol>
<p>In 2018, Feng E took to the streets of London to perform “Beat It” by Michael Jackson on the ukulele. The video went viral, and currently has over 1.5 million views. As one commenter on the video pointed out, “He plays ukelele like it’s part of his body.”</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>Feng E on ‘The Ellen Show’ and his love affair with Legos</li>
</ol>
<p>In 2018, after the video of him busking went viral, Feng E was invited to perform on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. He spoke to the host through a translator, and Ellen was later criticized for seeming to mock her guest for his lengthy answers. Feng E remained positive, however, and was invited back on the show the next year.</p>
<p>Feng initially started playing ukulele because his father thought Feng’s fingers weren’t flexible enough and his father threatened him that if Feng did not practice ukulele, his father will not play legos with him. On the Ellen Show, after his performance, Ellen gifted Feng with legos to surprise him.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>He posts ukulele covers on YouTube.</li>
</ol>
<p>He has over 500,000 subscribers on his YouTube channel, where he frequently posts ukulele covers of well-known songs. Some of his most popular uploads include “Chandelier” by Sia, “Smells Like Teen Spirit” by Nirvana, and “Bad Guy” by Billie Eilish.</p>
<p>RELATED: MEET EMERALD GORDON WULF: THE 13-YEAR-OLD CONTORTIONIST ON ‘AMERICA’S GOT TALENT’</p>
<p>“The dislikes are envious adult ukelele musicians that can’t play like he does,” one commenter remarked on the cover. Another joked that it inspired them to sell their own ukulele, because they don’t think they’ll ever be as good.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>He competed on ‘Asia’s Got Talent.’</li>
</ol>
<p>This isn’t Feng E’s first time competing on a Got Talent show. In 2017, he appeared on Asia’s Got Talent. His audition earned the Golden Buzzer from judge David Foster. He made it all the way to the finals, although he didn’t end up winning. Maybe his luck will be better on America’s Got Talent. Could a second Golden Buzzer be in his future?

<h3 id="australia-asia-protests-embrace-black-lives-matter-movement">&ldquo;Australia, Asia protests embrace &lsquo;Black Lives Matter&rsquo; movement&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%2Fimages%2F6%2F9%2F5%2F9%2F27519596-5-eng-GB%2FCropped-1591433121AP_20158285985390.jpg?source=nar-cms&amp;width=1024&amp;height=512&amp;fit=cover&amp;gravity=faces" alt="img">
MELBOURNE (Reuters) &ndash; Thousands took to the streets across Australia on Saturday, as did hundreds in Tokyo and Seoul to support U.S. protests against police brutality, while demonstrations were expected around Europe in the coming hours.</p>
<p>The rolling, global protests reflect rising anger over police treatment of ethnic minorities, sparked by the May 25 killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis after a police officer detaining him knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes as fellow officers stood by.</p>
<p>Asia-Pacific demonstrations, however, were limited by social-distancing curbs aiming at stopping the novel coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>In the United States on Friday, prominent Democratic politicians adopted the slogans of the protests and announced reforms, as tensions remained high in major cities after days of largely peaceful protests that saw sporadic violence.</p>
<p>In Brisbane, police estimated 10,000 people joined a peaceful protest, wearing masks and holding &ldquo;Black Lives Matter&rdquo; placards. Many wrapped themselves in indigenous flags, calling for an end to police mistreatment of indigenous Australians.</p>
<p>In Sydney, a last-minute court decision overruled a coronavirus ban as several thousand people marched, amid a heavy police presence, chanting: &ldquo;Whose lives matter? Black Lives matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rallies were also held in Melbourne, Adelaide and other Australian cities.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, marchers protested against what they said was police treatment of a Kurdish man who says he was stopped while driving and shoved to the ground, leaving him with bruises.</p>
<p>Organizers invoked the U.S. protests, saying they were also marching in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to show that there&rsquo;s racism in Japan now,&rdquo; said 17-year-old high school student Wakaba, who declined to give her family name.</p>
<p>She and her friend, Moe, marching in their school uniforms, held a sign saying: &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not angry, you&rsquo;re not paying attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No justice, no peace, no racist police,&rdquo; the crowd chanted.</p>
<p>In Seoul, dozens of South Korean activists and foreign residents gathered, some wearing black masks with &ldquo;can&rsquo;t breathe&rdquo; in Korea, echoing George Floyd&rsquo;s final words as he lay on the pavement. Others participated in an online &ldquo;viral photo protest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;South Korea is becoming a multicultural society,&rdquo; organizer Shim Ji-Hoon told Reuters. &ldquo;So I proposed this march to have awareness of racial discrimination and make a world of living together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With pandemic restrictions in Bangkok, activists were going online, asking for video and photos of people wearing black, raising their fists and holding signs, and explaining why they &ldquo;stand united behind Black Lives Matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Thai protesters plan to gather on the video-meeting platform Zoom on Sunday and observe 8 minutes 46 seconds of silence &ndash; the period that George Floyd was filmed pinned under the officer&rsquo;s knee.</p>
<p>Around Europe, which has seen an unprecedented wave of anti-racism rallies drawing tens of thousands onto the streets, weekend protests were planned in Germany, Britain, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium and Hungary.</p>
<p>As in Seoul, Paris authorities banned demonstrations in front of the local U.S. Embassy, citing the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Some European demonstrators have been wearing masks and maintaining social distance, but in some places &ndash; notably Germany on Friday &ndash; large numbers marched closely together.</p>
<p>Banners and slogans have focused not just on George Floyd but on a string of other controversies in specific countries and mistreatment of minorities in general.
