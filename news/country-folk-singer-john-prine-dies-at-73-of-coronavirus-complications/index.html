Grammy-winning singer John Prine, who wrote his early songs in his head while delivering mail and later emerged from Chicago&rsquo;s folk revival scene in the 1970s to become one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, died on Tuesday. He was 73.</p>
<p>Prine was hospitalized in Nashville on March 26 suffering from symptoms of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, according to his wife, Fiona Whelan Prine, who was also his manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We join the world in mourning the passing of revered country and folk singer/songwriter John Prine,&rdquo; the Recording Academy said in a written statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Widely lauded as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, John&rsquo;s impact will continue to inspire musicians for years to come. We send our deepest condolences to his loved ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A publicist for Prine confirmed his death due to complications from COVID-19 at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in his adopted hometown of Nashville.</p>
<p>Born in Chicago on October 10, 1946, to William Prine and Verna Hamm, both originally of Kentucky, Prine was taught by his older brother David to play guitar at the age of 14 and attended music classes at the Old Town School of Folk Music.</p>
<p>After graduating from high school in suburban Maywood, Illinois, Prine worked as a mail carrier for five years, performing in Chicago clubs in the evenings at occasional &ldquo;open mic&rdquo; nights.</p>
<p>He would say later that some of his best-known early songs were written while he walked the streets of Chicago delivering mail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I likened the mail route to being in a library without any books. You just had time to be quiet and think, and that&rsquo;s where I would come up with a lot of songs. If the song was any good I could remember it later and write it down,&rdquo; Prine told the Chicago Tribune in a 2010 interview.</p>
<p>He was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1966, stationed in Germany during the Vietnam War, before returning home to dedicate himself to music and establishing himself as a leading member of Chicago&rsquo;s folk revival scene.</p>
<p>Singer-songwriter Kris Kristofferson fatefully saw Prine performing at the Earl of Old Town club, leading to Prine&rsquo;s signing with Atlantic Records and self-titled debut album, released in 1971.</p>
<p>That album, widely praised by critics, contained several songs that would become staples of Prine&rsquo;s catalog.</p>
<p>They included &ldquo;Angel from Montgomery,&rdquo; about a woman wishing for deliverance from her unfulfilling life, &ldquo;Paradise,&rdquo; about a Kentucky town devastated by strip mining, and &ldquo;Sam Stone,&rdquo; chronicling the downward spiral of a drug-addicted Vietnam War veteran and containing the oft-quoted refrain: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a hole in daddy&rsquo;s arm where all the money goes, Jesus Christ died for nothin I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The songs have since each been covered dozens of times by other artists.

<h3 id="celebrated-singer-songwriter-john-prine-has-died-at-73">Celebrated singer-songwriter John Prine has died at 73</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.graytvinc.com/images/AP_19167114323585.jpg" alt="img">
John Prine, the ingenious singer-songwriter who explored the heartbreaks, indignities and absurdities of everyday life in “Angel from Montgomery,” “Sam Stone,” “Hello in There” and scores of other indelible tunes, died Tuesday at the age of 73.</p>
<p>His family announced his death from complications from the coronavirus; he died at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>
<p>His wife Fiona said last month that she had tested positive for COVID-19 and she has since recovered, but her husband was hospitalized on March 26 with coronavirus symptoms. He was put on a ventilator and remained in the intensive care unit for several days.</p>
<p>Winner of a lifetime achievement Grammy earlier this year, Prine was a virtuoso of the soul, if not the body. He sang his conversational lyrics in a voice roughened by a hard-luck life, particularly after throat cancer left him with a disfigured jaw.</p>
<p>He joked that he fumbled so often on the guitar, taught to him as a teenager by his older brother, that people thought he was inventing a new style. But his open-heartedness, eye for detail and sharp and surreal humor brought him the highest admiration from critics, from such peers as Bob Dylan and Kris Kristofferson, and from such younger stars as Jason Isbell and Kacey Musgraves, who even named a song after him.</p>
<p>In 2017, Rolling Stone proclaimed him &ldquo;The Mark Twain of American songwriting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prine began playing as a young Army veteran who invented songs to fight boredom while delivering the U.S. mail in Maywood, Illinois. He and his friend, folk singer Steve Goodman, were still polishing their skills at the Old Town School of Folk Music when Kristofferson, a rising star at the time, heard them sing one night in Chicago, and invited them to share his stage in New York City. The late film critic Roger Ebert, then with the Chicago Sun-Times, also saw one of his shows and declared him an &ldquo;extraordinary new composer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly noticed by America&rsquo;s most popular folk, rock and country singers, Prine signed with Atlantic Records and released his first album in 1971.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was really into writing about characters, givin&rsquo; &lsquo;em names,&rdquo; Prine said, reminiscing about his long career in a January 2016 public television interview that was posted on his website.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just sit and look around you. You don&rsquo;t have to make up stuff. If you just try to take down the bare description of what&rsquo;s going on, and not try to over-describe something, then it leaves space for the reader or the listener to fill in their experience with it, and they become part of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was among the many promoted as a &ldquo;New Dylan&rdquo; and among the few to survive it and find his own way. Few songwriters could equal his wordplay, his empathy or his imagination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I try to look through someone else&rsquo;s eyes,&rdquo; he told Ebert in 1970. His characters were common people and confirmed eccentrics, facing the frustrations and pleasures anyone could relate to. &ldquo;Sam Stone&rdquo; traces the decline of a drug-addicted Vietnam veteran through the eyes of his little girl. &ldquo;Donald and Lydia&rdquo; tells of a tryst between a shy Army private and small-town girl, both vainly searching for &ldquo;love hidden deep in your heart:&rdquo;</p>
<p>They made love in the mountains, they made love in the streams</p>
<p>they made love in the valleys, they made love in their dreams.</p>
<p>But when they were finished, there was nothing to say,</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause mostly they made love from ten miles away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He writes beautiful songs,&rdquo; Dylan once told MTV producer Bill Flanagan. &ldquo;I remember when Kris Kristofferson first brought him on the scene. All that stuff about Sam Stone the soldier-junkie-daddy, and Donald and Lydia, where people make love from ten miles away &ndash; nobody but Prine could write like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prine&rsquo;s mischief shined in songs like &ldquo;Illegal Smile,&rdquo; which he swore wasn&rsquo;t about marijuana; &ldquo;Spanish Pipedream,&rdquo; about a topless waitress with &ldquo;something up her sleeve;&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dear Abby,&rdquo; in which Prine imagines the advice columnist getting fed up with whiners and hypochondriacs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no complaint,&rdquo; his Abby writes back:</p>
<p>You are what you are and you ain&rsquo;t what you ain&rsquo;t</p>
<p>so listen up Buster, and listen up good</p>
<p>stop wishin&rsquo; for bad luck and knocking on wood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prine was never a major commercial success, but performed for more than four decades, often selling his records at club appearances where he mentored rising country and bluegrass musicians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt like I was going door to door meeting the people and cleaning their carpets and selling them a record,&rdquo; he joked in a 1995 Associated Press interview.</p>
<p>Many others adopted his songs. Bonnie Raitt made a signature tune out of &ldquo;Angel from Montgomery,&rdquo; about the stifled dreams of a lonely housewife, and performed it at the 2020 Grammys ceremony. Bette Midler recorded &ldquo;Hello in There,&rdquo; Prine&rsquo;s poignant take on old age. Prine wrote &ldquo;Unwed Fathers&rdquo; for Tammy Wynette, and &ldquo;Love Is on a Roll&rdquo; for Don Williams.</p>
<p>Others who covered Prine&rsquo;s music included Joan Baez, Johnny Cash, John Denver, the Everly Brothers, Carly Simon, George Strait, Miranda Lambert, Norah Jones and Old Crow Medicine Show.</p>
<p>Prine himself regarded Dylan and Cash as key influences, bridges between folk and country whose duet on Dylan&rsquo;s country rock album &ldquo;Nashville Skyline&rdquo; made Prine feel there was a place for him in contemporary music. Though mostly raised in Maywood, he spent summers in Paradise, Kentucky, and felt so great an affinity to his family&rsquo;s roots there he would call himself &ldquo;pure Kentuckian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prine was married three times, and appreciated a relationship that lasted. In 1999, he and Iris DeMent shared vocals on the classic title track of his album &ldquo;In Spite of Ourselves,&rdquo; a ribald tribute to an old married couple.</p>
<p>In spite of ourselves we&rsquo;ll end up a-sittin&rsquo; on a rainbow</p>
<p>Against all odds, honey we&rsquo;re the big door-prize</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re gonna spite our noses right off of our faces</p>
<p>There won&rsquo;t be nothin&rsquo; but big ol&rsquo; hearts dancin&rsquo; in our eyes</p>
<p>Prine preferred songs about feelings to topical music, but he did respond at times to the day&rsquo;s headlines. Prine&rsquo;s parents had moved to suburban Chicago from Paradise, a coal town ravaged by strip mining that inspired one of his most cutting protest songs, &ldquo;Paradise.&rdquo; It appeared on his first album, along with &ldquo;Your Flag Decal Won&rsquo;t Get You Into Heaven Anymore,&rdquo; which criticized what he saw as false patriotism surrounding the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>Many years later, as President George W. Bush sent soldiers to war, Prine had a song for that, too. In &ldquo;Some Humans Ain&rsquo;t Human,&rdquo; he wrote: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re feeling your freedom, and the world&rsquo;s off your back, some cowboy from Texas, starts his own war in Iraq.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prine&rsquo;s off-hand charisma made him a natural for movies. He appeared in the John Mellencamp film &ldquo;Falling From Grace,&rdquo; and in Billy Bob Thornton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Daddy and Them.&rdquo; His other Grammy Awards include Best Contemporary Folk Recording for his 1991 album &ldquo;The Missing Years,&rdquo; with guest vocalists including Raitt, Tom Petty, Bruce Springsteen and Phil Everly. He won Best Traditional Folk Album in 2004 for &ldquo;Beautiful Dreamer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prine didn&rsquo;t let illness stop him from performing or recording. In 2013, long after surviving throat cancer, he was diagnosed with an unrelated and operable form of lung cancer, but he bounced back from that, too, often sharing the stage with DeMent and other younger artists. On the playful talking blues &ldquo;When I Get to Heaven,&rdquo; from the 2018 album &ldquo;The Tree of Forgiveness,&rdquo; he vowed to have the last laugh for all eternity.</p>
<p>When I get to heaven, I&rsquo;m gonna shake God&rsquo;s hand</p>
<p>Thank him for more blessings than one man can stand</p>
<p>Then I&rsquo;m gonna get a guitar and start a rock-n-roll band</p>
<p>Check into a swell hotel; ain&rsquo;t the afterlife grand?</p>
<p>He is survived by his wife, Fiona, two sons Jack and Tommy, his stepson Jody and three grandchildren.</p>

<h3 id="remembering-john-prine-the-songwriting-great-who-invented-east-st-paul">Remembering John Prine: The songwriting great who invented East St. Paul</h3>
<p><img src="https://stmedia.stimg.co/jonbream_1586317724_jpjoles.jpg?h=630&amp;w=1200&amp;fit=crop&amp;bg=999&amp;crop=faces" alt="img">
He was a sweet, quirky guy who sang about everyday people and invented East St. Paul.</p>
<p>John Prine recorded a song in 1978 called “Sabu Visits the Twin Cities Alone” in which a traveling circus boy, bundled up in corduroy, left “the jungles of East St. Paul” for Illinois.</p>
<p>“I figured there wasn’t one when I wrote it,” he told me of East St. Paul in ’78. “I found out later that I was right. That’s great. I’m a foot and a half off center – per usual.”</p>
<p>Prine, who died Tuesday of COVID-19 at age 73, had the keen observational powers of a veteran journalist, the subtle wit of a prose humorist and the kind of songwriting skills that justify his being mentioned in the same sentence with Bob Dylan and Paul Simon as the Great American Songwriters.</p>
<p>Prine’s Twin Cities debut was actually his first proper concert, after gigging at clubs and coffeehouses of Chicago. He came here in February 1972 to the old Guthrie Theater along with two other new singer-songwriters from the Windy City, Steve Goodman and Bonnie Koloc.</p>
<p>Goodman was a small guy with bright eyes and an eager-to-please manner. He was a storyteller with a quick sense of humor, a middle-class suburban kid who’d joined a fraternity at college.</p>
<p>Prine was a small guy with a sly grin and a hairdo waiting to be dubbed a mullet. He was a former mail carrier from a working-class suburb who’d served in the Army.</p>
<p>That night, Prine sang a tune called “Illegal Smile,” the cleverest song about being stoned that you’d ever want to hear.</p>
<p>He sang “Sam Stone,” about a soldier who&rsquo;d returned from the war overseas addicted to drugs or as Prine put it “there’s a hole in daddy’s arm where all the money goes.”</p>
<p>He sang “Hello in There,” about the loneliness of old people, ending poignantly with “So if you&rsquo;re walking down the street sometime/ And spot some hollow ancient eyes/ Please don&rsquo;t just pass &lsquo;em by and stare/ As if you didn&rsquo;t care, say, ‘Hello in there, hello.’&rdquo;</p>
<p>Witnessing such a range of emotions in one set, the Guthrie audience was taken with Prine, who was taken with the Twin Cities. In ’73, he came back to the Guthrie with Bonnie Raitt, another rising singer-songwriter.</p>
<p>In that 1978 interview, Prine told me he grew fond of Minneapolis-St. Paul. He said he wrote “Sabu” “more or less in honor of the Twin Cities.”</p>
<p>Even though he later moved to Nashville and released albums at erratic intervals, Prine continued to perform regularly at various Twin Cities venues over the years.</p>
<p>He was so comfortable here that in 2012 he sent his road manager ahead to the Minnesota Zoo and opted to drive himself from the hotel. Prine got lost and arrived late, which mattered because the zoo has a curfew. So his tardiness forced him to curtail his usual long-winded stories and clever one-liners &ndash; but not the quality of his performance.</p>
<p>In concert, Prine’s stories were as charming and rewarding as his songs. Like the one he told in June 2019 at Northrop about singer Leon Redbone, his former touring partner who had died the day before.</p>
<p>After one of their concerts, to see if he could catch the eccentric Redbone out of character, Prine knocked on the young vaudevillian’s hotel door at 3 a.m. Redbone answered immediately, wearing his familiar sunglasses, Panama hat, white shirt and less familiar boxer shorts and socks with garters. Prine was instantly invited in and asked what he’d like to drink.</p>
<p>“Cognac,” he recalled. Without missing a beat, Redbone pulled out a bottle of Christmas VSOP and two snifters.</p>
<p>At Northrop, as Prine was reliving that late night, you could sense that he was chuckling inside remembering his old pal, the kind of vivid character who could inhabit one of Prine’s classic songs.</p>
<p>In 2017, I interviewed Prine again, this time by email because he endeavored to preserve his voice, which had been ravaged by two bouts of cancer. Prine being Prine, he chose which questions to answer and which to skip (like the ones about &ldquo;Angel from Montgomery,&rdquo; which Raitt had made famous).</p>
<p>Of course, I asked him again about East St. Paul (“Hmm, poetic license? I make up songs. I’m a songwriter”).</p>
<p>I also asked him where his love of words came from (“The only subject I liked in school was English — the only thing I was really any good at”).</p>
<p>And where his humor came from.</p>
<p>“There’s very little about life that I don’t find in some way humorous or at least kind of goofy. There’s surely enough around us to be pissed at, but I’m just not that guy.”
