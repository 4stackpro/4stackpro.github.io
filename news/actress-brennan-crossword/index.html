<p>WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — When we last saw Benjamin Kramer in The New York Times Crossword, he was serving his puzzle to us over a net in a raucous game of volleyball. In this puzzle — and at a time when we are pursuing hobbies within our homes — he is settling us down with a much quieter activity.</p>
<p>And at least we won’t break any furniture while we are doing it.</p>
<p>Tricky Clues</p>
<p>11D. The exclamation just before and after “just” is WOW, as in “WOW. Just WOW.”</p>
<p>24D. The clue “Group of Greek women” had me thinking of “Lysistrata,” but this clue is hinting at modern SORORITY CHAPTERs.</p>
<p>44A. This is one of those famous “You either know it or you don’t” clues. AVERY is a paper products company that makes those peel and stick “Hello, My Name Is …” tags.

THURSDAY PUZZLE — A brief one today, as I attempt to catch up on all the things I do when I am not telling you stories about hormonal pigs or embarrassing experiences with my mother in the local head shop. You will be in the strong yet supple hands of Caitlin Lovinger until I return for the Tuesday puzzle.</p>
<p>Bruce Haight and Peter A. Collins return with a puzzle that the Werriam-Mebster dictionary might love.</p>
<p>Tricky Clues</p>
<p>21A. I had AND at first, but the clause connector in question was NOR.</p>
<p>50A. Nice cluing for a ubiquitous entry. “Italian mount” is not hinting at an Italian breed of horse; it refers to Mount ETNA.</p>
<p>52A. I had to look this one up. The Tennessee Lady Volunteers — often shortened to VOLS by fans — represent the University of Tennessee in the N.C.A.A.’s women’s basketball competition.

WEDNESDAY PUZZLE — Laura Taylor Kinnel made her New York Times Crossword debut in 2019 with a Sunday puzzle, then followed that up a few months later with another Sunday.</p>
<p>That’s a pretty good way to make your presence known in the crossword world, and she is back with a slightly larger than usual (15x16) Wednesday grid.</p>
<p>Tricky Clues</p>
<p>13A. The “Professor in a library, perhaps” in this clue is Prof. PLUM, from the game “Clue.”</p>
<p>31A. Editors shorten written sentences, but in this puzzle, to “Shorten the sentence, maybe?” is to COP A PLEA.</p>
<p>34A. We’re talking about hip, not hip. What I mean is, the “Hip designs?” are designs for one’s hip, or TATS. Of course, they could also be hip.

<h3 id="hollywood-proves-the-futility-of-showbiz-fantasy">&ldquo;&lsquo;Hollywood&rsquo; Proves the Futility of Showbiz Fantasy&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/TUwsetuGWpiTiCbXy4YUqcdlH3E=/0x408:5990x3528/960x500/media/img/mt/2020/05/HOLLYWOOD_107_Unit_01702RC_copy/original.jpg" alt="img">
The plea would be touching if it weren’t for the clunky setup. As rare as it would have been for anyone of color to be invited to a meeting with studio execs, the fact that the scene doesn’t include Camille (Laura Harrier), the black actor in question, but instead depends on a character introduced out of nowhere, contradicts Murphy’s socially progressive fantasy. Roosevelt’s hypothetical also distills the black experience down to poverty, making the scene not just tasteless, but insulting. Save for a few inspired arcs (such as one involving a closeted executive played by Joe Mantello), much of Hollywood functions this way—using the revisionist nature of the show as a narrative crutch.</p>
<p>As a producer, Murphy usually succeeds in excavating the complex, uncomfortable truths in dramas about history: In The People v. O. J. Simpson, he exercised restraint while telling the most tawdry of true-crime tales; in Pose, he found subtlety in the most exuberant ballroom worlds; and in Feud: Bette and Joan, he criticized the machinations of old Hollywood’s most glamorous icons. But in Hollywood, he resorts to wishful thinking, never demonizing the industry and its Hays Code era, leaving the series toothless instead. The show acknowledges the sexism, racism, and homophobia of the postwar movie business, but it treats such systemic issues as simply failures of imagination—as if all Hollywood needed was more Roosevelts bravely striding onto movie sets.</p>
<p>In an interview with Salon, Murphy said he wanted to avoid the “incredibly bleak” tone of other alternate-history series such as The Man in the High Castle, while Mock explained that they wanted to adopt an optimistic tone that would underline the impact Hollywood can have on marginalized communities. When she and Murphy worked together on Pose, they received feedback that “it’s not realistic,” she said. “With Hollywood we are actually saying, ‘What are the many interventions that we could have made that could have possibly taken us onto a different road?’”</p>
<p>Yet, that’s exactly the problem with Hollywood: The show doesn’t present a series of “interventions” that could have accelerated the industry’s progress; it presents a series of ridiculous plot contrivances. Camille lands the gig because of Roosevelt’s appeal. Patti LuPone’s Avis becomes the first female studio head because her philandering husband, who had the job, suffers a mid-coital heart attack. Everyone working on Meg, the film starring Camille and written and directed by talent of color, fears that their project will anger “the South.” But the biopic, which changes the race and backstory of Peg Entwistle, an actor who leapt to her death off the Hollywood sign, gets saved from censorship by a deus ex machina. Racism becomes a nonissue for Meg after the film opens; as a newscaster notes, racial protests “simply melted away.”

SATURDAY PUZZLE — I have been waiting for a Stella Zawistowski puzzle, and we’re lucky to get it on a weekend. Ms. Zawistowski is a supersonic force of nature in the crossword solving world as well as a powerlifter, a scientifically improbable combination of speed and strength.</p>
<p>I think that knowing these things helps explain the zeitgeist of this grid. It looks daunting at first, even unnavigable, but after paddling uncertainly for a while your raft will find a current and rush you forward, pell mell. Plenty of rapids, though! Plenty of sharp rocks!</p>
<p>Tricky Clues</p>
<p>There are several interesting trains of thought running through the clues — let’s run MOHEL down through NÉE and ILL TIMED, why not? — and a snappy, irrepressible vibe. So many riffs — SLAG and LAG, MANE and TEASES, RUN and LAM. The stacks in each corner were all just wonderful, too, replete with debuts, oddities and intimate jokes (SPORTSBRA and LABORIOUS. Sooo true.) Also, although I didn’t get either entry until after a few passes, the first row of this puzzle, as a tone setter for the whole adventure, was quite endearing.</p>
<p>35A: Guessing this word (which was common crossword fill in the 1950s, but fell from use over time) brought me to one of my favorite writers, Gerald Durrell, who used the term PALAVER quite often in his stories about collecting wild animals in exotic places. Also, there’s a very swinging Fela Kuti song that uses palaver in the chorus.

<h3 id="hollywood-on-netflix-ryan-murphys-alt-history-falls-short">&ldquo;&lsquo;Hollywood&rsquo; on Netflix: Ryan Murphy&rsquo;s alt-history falls short&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bd1c32d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2Fe4%2Fd272fc5444ea8aedcca4c98617f2%2Fhollywood-101-unit-01344rc.jpg" alt="img">
“Hollywood,” a new limited series from Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan, is an aspirational fantasy set in 1947 in a Hollywood that never was. Like time travelers heading into the past to improve the future, they aim to reset history, to liberate the picture business from racial and sexual prejudice decades before the picture business got around to considering it: We want the world and we want it &hellip; then.</p>
<p>“I want to take the story of Hollywood and give it a rewrite,” says black screenwriter Archie Coleman (Jeremy Pope) to director Ray Ainsley (Darren Criss), a Filipino American passing as white. “So maybe someday soon you ain’t a half-Asian director who feels he has to hide it; you’ll just be a director and … I’ll just be a writer. Wouldn’t that be something?” Ray wants to direct Archie’s script, “Peg,” the story of actress Peg Entwistle, who famously jumped from the Hollywood sign in the early 1930s, and whose story we are meant to regard as emblematic of the cruelty of a short-sighted industry. (“The town wouldn’t accept her,” Archie says of Entwistle. “I know the feeling.”)</p>
<p>Murphy previously concocted a traditional show business double-biopic “Feud: Bette and Joan,” about Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, but this is something different: an alternate history, like one of those speculative dramas where the United States has lost to Nazi Germany (see: “The Man in the High Castle”) or its surrogates (see: “The Plot Against America”), but in reverse — as if, say, Hitler got run over by a truck on the eve of war and Germany overnight became a peaceful bastion of inclusiveness. And as a partly accurate fable of Hollywood, it’s also like a couple of Coen Brothers films, but with farce and satire swapped out for melodrama and sentiment. Or a version of “Sunset Boulevard” in which the close-up Norma Desmond is ready for is in a big-budget major motion picture.</p>
<p>The fantastic nature of the story isn’t obvious at first, but there is something about the clean and creamy production values, the theatrical dialogue and the slightly to substantially larger-than-life performances that announce from the start that we are not quite in our world. It’s a movie reality, with situations and characters imported from old backstage dramas and clichés so obvious I can only imagine that we’re meant to regard them with knowing affection: When someone coughs into a handkerchief, the confession of a wasting disease cannot be far behind. There is a good deal of speechifying — indeed, the finale is made up of literal speeches — to make big points and to let the actors run.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Laura Harrier is a young actress trying to bring change to the postwar movie industry in Ryan Murphy’s “Hollywood.” (Netflix)</p>
<p>Among a host of invented characters and celebrity look-alikes are two real-life figures at the center of the action: Roy Fitzgerald (Jake Picking), a good-looking, good-natured unformed lump later known as Rock Hudson, and talent agent Henry Willson (Jim Parsons), who gave him that name. (Willson, who tells Hudson “You smell like milk,” is portrayed as bitter and sexually exploitative but lonely and frustrated too; he’s a sort of half-villain.) A third character, Ernie West (Dylan McDermott, going big), is inspired by the late Scotty Bowers, who ran a drive-through brothel out of a Hollywood gas station, for a mostly gay, sometimes famous clientele. Hollywood’s big closet — pretty fancy, but a closet still — is a theme here.</p>
<p>Working for Ernie is Jack Castello (David Corenswet), a hunk not long out of the service who has been angling to break into movies. (He is a sort of straight counterpart to Rock/Roy; they overlap.) His pregnant wife Henrietta (Maude Apatow) works as a waitress at Schwab’s (perfectly reconstructed) and has little attention paid to her either by Jack or the script. She is allowed a big scene near the end, which only underscores the fact that she has been employed to that point largely as a millstone.</p>
<p>Also working for Ernie, recruited by Jack, is Archie, who falls into a relationship with Rock, a new customer. Ray is living with actress Camille Washington (Laura Harrier), who is black and under contract at Ace Studios, run by loud, uncouth Ace Amberg (Rob Reiner, having fun), whose wife, Avis (Patti LuPone), is one of Jack’s clients. Their daughter, Claire (Samara Weaving), is also under contract at the studio, but under an assumed name, as if nobody there would recognize the boss’s daughter. Well, they don’t.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Together with the sometime participation of historical actors of color Anna May Wong (Michelle Krusiec) and Hattie McDaniel (Queen Latifah), they form a band of outsiders fighting for recognition, representation and artistic control. (Even LuPone’s mogul’s wife is a reject: “Nobody thought that a Jewish girl could be a movie star; nobody thought they were pretty.”) Along with friendly studio executives played by Holland Taylor and Joe Mantello, all are involved in one way or another with “Peg.” Much of the business of “Hollywood” revolves around the question of whether Camille can play the title character — the bruited solution is, hilariously, to change her name to “Meg.” (Though Archie is worried at first that making Camille the lead will turn it into “a message picture,” he’s already a character in one.)</p>
<p>“A few months ago, you were a contract player,” Claire says to Jack, once things get going for him, “and now you’re part of an incredible ensemble of artists who aren’t just making a movie, they’re making history.” I would note that none of them has ever made a movie before, and none of them is Orson Welles. But this is that kind of 1947 Hollywood.</p>
<p>Dylan McDermott, Patti LuPone and Taylor Holland play figures outside and inside the movie business in the Netflix series “Hollywood.” (Saeed Adyani / Netflix)</p>
<p>Even as it sticks pins in its subject, “Hollywood” insists on its power. “Movies don’t just show us how the world is,” says Ray, raising a metaphorical banner. “They show us how the world can be.” Even Eleanor Roosevelt (Harriet Sansom Harris) is brought in to attest that motion pictures can move mountains where “good government” cannot. As to the question of casting Camille, Roosevelt wonders what seeing her up on the big screen “might mean to a dirt-poor little black girl living in a shanty in some cotton town where she’s told she is free but really her life is no better than that of her own grandparents.”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The exact degree of ironic self-awareness here is hard to reckon, but “Hollywood,” for all its exaggerations, feels sincere — as if Murphy is building the past that would have created the world he would have preferred to grow up in. Yet it’s this very sincerity, even generosity — its best features, really — that keep the series from being lifelike, and, indeed, can make it seem a little ridiculous. “Hollywood” is determined to deliver good outcomes to its characters; it’s a fixed game, and while it’s easy enough to watch, and to sympathize with its desire to liberate a repressive age, it has little urgency. No one will be jumping off the Hollywood sign here. The only question is just how far Murphy and Brennan are going to take their orgy of wish fulfillment; the answer is all the way — which is a sort of courage, I suppose. (To dream the impossible dream, and all that.) The last episode is titled “Hollywood Ending,” so, you know, they’re not shy about it.</p>
<p>‘Hollywood’</p>

<p>The synopsis for tonight’s movie reads: “A well-known magician drops dead in the middle of a dangerous trick on stage in front of a packed audience, but when the sudden death turns out to be murder, New York Sentinel Crosswords editor (and part-timer sleuth) Tess Harper (Chabert) and NYPD detective Logan O’Connor (Elliott) team up to discover exactly whose sleight of hand is behind the deadly “now you see him, now you don’t” stunt. Together, they must uncover the not-so-obvious clues and work their investigative magic to bring a killer to justice.”</p>
<p>‘Crossword Mysteries: Abracadaver’ Was Filmed in Canada</p>
<p>Filming for the movie wrapped back in August.</p>
<p>The Crossword movies are filmed in Canada. This post from Barabra Niven, who stars in the series, talks about where it is filmed. She wrote: “On my way to the airport again. Going back to Toronto and North Bay for more #CrosswordMysteries. Can’t wait to see @thereallacey and @brennanelliott2 . I hope you’re having a great week! Sorry I have not been posting much, but I have been flying back-and-forth as we shoot these next three movies. I’ve been taking photos and video though of behind the scenes so I will share them with you soon. Meanwhile I send you a big heart hug!! I miss you!”</p>
<p>Interestingly, this movie was originally supposed to have aired in October. A lot of viewers were sad it was delayed because they were really looking forward to it. But it was delayed because Hallmark Movies &amp; Mysteries started its Miracles of Christmas season a little early.</p>
<p>Here are some behind the scenes photos and videos from filming.</p>
<p>Filming started in July.</p>
<p>And here is Chabert on a day off during filming in Ontario.</p>
<p>The second and third movies were filmed close to each other. In fact, the third movie was originally supposed to premiere the week after the second movie aired. But viewers are excited to see it now in January.</p>
