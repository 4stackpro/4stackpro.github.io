U.S. rotorcraft industry members should apply as soon as possible if they want to take advantage of two federal programs offering financial support through the COVID-19 crisis, according to experts from Helicopter Association International (HAI).</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“We’re experiencing global events that are affecting your lives and our industry in ways most of us never imagined,” said Jim Viola, president and CEO of HAI, in opening the first of a series of webinars the association is planning to help its members through the crisis. “We at HAI understand that information on how the government is trying to help is changing daily, and even then, the new information for our industry may be very difficult to find.”</p>
<p>Robert Lakind, an aviation attorney and member of HAI’s safety committee, highlighted the potential for financial support through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and the Air Carrier Worker Support (ACWS) Program. The two programs, created as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act are currently accepting applications and are being processed on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
<p>The PPP makes $349 billion available for loans, which may qualify for 100 percent forgiveness if certain criteria are met.</p>
<p>The potential payout is 2.5 times a company’s monthly payroll (excluding any compensation to an individual employee over $100,000) to a maximum of $10 million per company.</p>
<p>The PPP can be used for several uses, including payroll costs, mortgage interest, rent and utilities.</p>
<p>The money is provided in the form of a two-year loan, with a one percent interest rate. However, the interest is deferred for six months.</p>
<p>The program is available to companies with 500 employees or less, and sole proprietors and tax-exempt companies are also eligible. To qualify, companies must have been in operation on Feb. 15 and had employees that were taking some form of compensation.</p>
<p>Supporting documentation will need to be provided for loan forgiveness, and the amount of the loan that will have to be repaid will increase if staff at a company are laid off, if payroll is reduced more than 25 percent, or if more than 25 percent of the loan is used for non-payroll purposes.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The Air Carrier Worker Support program provides $25 billion to support salaries of air carrier employees, which a part 135 operator or part 145 repair station would qualify for.</p>
<p>The loans are equal to six months’ worth of employee salaries, but can only be used for employee compensation, and companies must not reduce staff or compensation before Sept. 30, 2020.</p>
<p>Finally, Lakind encouraged operators to see if they could be considered an essential service with local authorities, check their insurance policy to see if there was anything to help cover the current conditions, and suggested they contact banks if they have financed aircraft to see if they would defer payments.</p>
<p>Despite the current challenges, Lakind struck an optimistic note as he looked ahead to the industry’s emergence in the post-COVID world.</p>
<p>“Economists are saying the fundamentals of the economy are sound, and additionally there are just tough participants in this industry — we know how to problem solve,” he said. “I think there’s no doubt that the industry will be back and probably back sooner than you expect. But right now, we do need a little bit of some bridge gap — something to help us get through.”

<h3 id="hackenai-hai--what-is-hackenai">HackenAI (HAI) : What is HackenAI?</h3>
<p><img src="https://mk0asiacryptotopf9lu.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1_o3zwLKcPdJ3L_DIG1zSzPg.jpeg" alt="img">
in 2018 alone, cybercrime cost the world $3 trillion. By 2021, it is expected to rise to $6 trillion per year.</p>
<p>Hacken combines blockchain and cybersecurity to address this problem through a wide range of services geared for both businesses and consumers, respectively.</p>
<p>Like other blockchain cybersecurity platforms, HackenAI has its own native token which can be used to pay for the products and services it provides.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Hacken company was founded in August 2017 by a group of cybersecurity experts and white hackers. Since then, they have performed over a hundred security audits on different companies across the blockchain space.</p>
<p>The team has a combined experience of 50 years in the cybersecurity space and has worked with big and small clients alike, in industries such as manufacturing, banking, e-commerce, and transportation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they have a community of over 2,000 cybersecurity researchers and have secured partnerships with various big-time industry players like CoinMarketCap, Bitfury, and Etherscan.</p>
<p>There are two main components of Hacken: the Hacken company/ecosystem which provides B2B products, and the HackenAI platform which serves as a cybersecurity companion app for consumers.</p>
<p>Hacken</p>
<p>Hacken is a cybersecurity ecosystem that offers a suite of products and services to help companies and organizations remain secure amidst the existing perils of the online world. In addition, they have served several blockchain companies in the past.</p>
<p>B2B Products</p>
<p>Hackenproof</p>
<p>HACKENPROOF is a bug bounty platform designed to help companies secure their digital assets and private data through crowdsourced cyber protection. You could think of this as the GoFundMe or Kickstarter of blockchain-based cybersecurity, where an entity outsources its cyber protection to a community of white hat hackers.</p>
<p>Advantages</p>
<p>Hacken provides accurate information, transparent reporting, and 24/7 analytics.</p>
<p>Hacken attracts a large group of competent cybersecurity researchers from different backgrounds.</p>
<p>The Hacken platform manages all operational issues including bug validation, communication with cybersecurity experts, and coordination of operational activities.</p>
<p>Security Assessments</p>
<p>Hacken employs in-house specialists that provide a full range of professional cybersecurity services to protect systems, networks, and applications from cyber breaches and human error.</p>
<p>Web Application Penetration Testing</p>
<p>Mobile Application Testing</p>
<p>DDoS Resistance Testing</p>
<p>Social Engineering</p>
<p>Network Penetration Testing</p>
<p>Blockchain Security Consulting</p>
<p>Hacken had carried out over 150 security checks for blockchain companies from 2017-2019, establishing as one of the top players in blockchain cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Their services include smart contract audits, DApp security reviews, blockchain protocol reviews, formal verification. They’ve audited tokens based on Ethereum, EOS, Tron, Vechain, and other blockchains.</p>
<p>Crypto Exchange Ranks</p>
<p>CER is a digital asset auditor designed to analyze crypto exchange data and publish them on a webpage or an application. This provides users with transparency and prevents the falsification of data.</p>
<p>CER issues certificates on:</p>
<p>Solvency</p>
<p>Liquidity</p>
<p>Cyber Security</p>
<p>Community</p>
<p>Being a CERtified exchange means that they complied with the highest cybersecurity standards, which Hacken’s audits ensure.</p>
<p>As of April 2020, only seven exchanges have been certified including Coinbase Pro, Binance, and Bitfinex.</p>
<p>B2B Goals in 2020</p>
<p>Image taken from HackenAI whitepaper</p>
<p>HackenAI</p>
<p>HackenAI is a blockchain cybersecurity application that protects users’ digital assets as well as incentivizes them to learn cybersecurity best practices.</p>
<p>Hacken has recognized that most people don’t invest enough in cybersecurity. Most of them think that it’s not necessary or urgent. While exchanges with bigger pots of gold are the prime targets of the most sophisticated hackers in the world, a lot of bottom-feeders actually prefer the smaller individuals.</p>
<p>Why? They are the most complacent, which makes them the perfect victims.</p>
<p>Yet most people only seek professional help after a cyberattack has been made or if their system or accounts have been breached. But by then, it would already be too late.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<p>Here are the features of the HackenAI platform:</p>
<p>CyberBootCamp</p>
<p>The CyberBootCamp is the gateway to the world of cybersecurity. New users with no cybersecurity background will have the opportunity to earn HAI tokens by completing the program.</p>
<p>They start with a dashboard of practical educational modules consisting of anti-phishing, privacy, data protection rules, and many more lessons. After completing the BootCamp, they will achieve a 99.9% level of protection against online threats.</p>
<p>Password manager</p>
<p>HackenAI’s password manager enables users to add, import, or export passwords in one click while keeping their data in one device. In order to sync the data with other devices or restore it from a lost phone, they need to enter a twelve-word seed phrase.</p>
<p>Two-factor authentication</p>
<p>If you’ve been trading cryptocurrencies for a while, then you likely know about 2FA. Similar to Google Authenticator, HackenAI has the capability of generating one-time passwords (OTP) for verification every time users need to access their online accounts.</p>
<p>Account monitoring</p>
<p>Hacken combines blockchain and cybersecurity to consistently track all potential threats and malpractices and instantly prompts users with factual, detailed information.</p>
<p>Secure storage</p>
<p>User data is stored as securely as passwords. Furthermore, the data is encrypted in transit in the event that it needs to be shared on insecure channels.</p>
<p>VPN</p>
<p>A VPN secures your network using encryption and other security tools, which prevent your data from being intercepted. This is particularly useful for accessing websites that are banned in your area or to simply stay anonymous while surfing the web.</p>
<p>HackenAI’s premium VPN service takes things a step further by blocking unwanted ads too.</p>
<p>Wallet</p>
<p>HackenAI also provides a non-custodial crypto wallet, which means that the user alone holds his private key, not the Hacken company. This decentralized wallet supports the following cryptocurrencies:</p>
<p>BTC</p>
<p>ETH</p>
<p>VeChainThor (VET)</p>
<p>VIP-180 (VTHO, HAI)</p>
<p>Ethereum tokens (ERC-20)</p>
<p>Binance Chain tokens (BEP-2)</p>
<p>Digital asset tracker</p>
<p>The digital asset tracker allows users to connect all exchange accounts, crypto wallets, and other crypto investments and consolidate them into one account. This allows users to track the performance of their assets in the market.</p>
<p>This also makes filing taxes easier since all your records are in one place.</p>
<p>The tracker, however, doesn’t allow trading in the platform itself using the API’s of various exchanges, as they only employ read-only API credentials. Being cybersecurity experts, the Hacken team sees an API as a backdoor window, and most often than not, the weakest point of an exchange’s security.</p>
<p>Hacken’s Crypto Exchange Ranking module is also integrated with HackenAI. This webpage allows users to check constantly-updated information about all crypto exchanges.</p>
<p>Tokenomics</p>
<p>The HackenAI platform is powered by its native currency, HAI token, which you can use to pay for all the services the platform provides, including its B2B products and its white-hat hacker community. At the Beta release, users can pay subscription fees using HAI tokens only.</p>
<p>Later on, the platform will provide payment gateways for other cryptocurrencies as well as fiat for the same services mentioned.</p>
<p>Use cases</p>
<p>The HAI token can be used all throughout the Hacken ecosystem.</p>
<p>Paying for the HackenAI subscription fee</p>
<p>Paying for Hacken’s B2B services</p>
<p>Purchase of 3rd party products from HackenAI cybersecurity marketplace</p>
<p>Staking program</p>
<p>Corporate governance</p>
<p>How to get HAI</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways to acquire HAI:</p>
<p>Buy at an exchange</p>
<p>Earn at the Hackenproof bug bounty platform</p>
<p>Referral bonus for sharing the platform</p>
<p>Swap HKN tokens</p>
<p>Educational mining (bonus rewards for completing CyberBootCamp and other cybersecurity tasks)</p>
<p>Technology</p>
<p>HAI is a VIP180 token, which is minted on the VechainThor blockchain. It is a utility designed to power most of the activities conducted on the Hacken ecosystem, HackenAI platform, and white hat community.</p>
<p>VeChainThor blockchain</p>
<p>According to their whitepaper, the Hacken team had evaluated all major blockchain platforms and have concluded, without a doubt, that the VechainThor blockchain is the best available option.</p>
<p>This means that the success of the HackenAI platform is tied to capabilities of the Vechain’s blockchain unless they decide to migrate in the future.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Hacken provides a valuable blockchain cybersecurity solution in an age of prevalent security violations, offering both businesses and average consumers the opportunity to secure their digital assets and data.</p>
<p>They also provide a wide range of uses for HAI both in their B2B products and HackenAI platform. This gives the currency value and allows holders to potentially profit if its price goes up.</p>
<p>The only confusing part of their decisions is the planned acceptance of other cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies for their services. Since other modes of payment are allowed, it might undermine the value of HAI.</p>
<p>Another concern is on the consumer side. What if people aren’t going to proactively practice proper cybersecurity habits?</p>
<p>Sure, they might complete the BootCamp for the reward incentives, but finishing a course and putting all the lessons into practice consistently are two different things.</p>
<p>All in all, the project definitely has potential and it appears that the team behind it is quite competent in what they do.
