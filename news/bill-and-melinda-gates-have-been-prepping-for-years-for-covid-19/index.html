Melinda and Bill Gates at their home in Seattle (Xinhua/REX)</p>
<p>When it comes to a global health crisis, the man you can turn to for advice is legendary Microsoft founder Bill Gates.</p>
<p>Since leaving the tech company, Gates set up the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with his wife and turned completely to philanthropy. They have tackled the likes of polio and malaria around the world and warned for years about the dangers of infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Addressing a TED Talk five years ago, Gates, 64, warned the next ‘global catastrophe’ would not be caused by war, but by a virus.</p>
<p>He said: ‘If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it’s most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war – not missiles, but microbes.’</p>
<p>‘Part of the reason for this is we have invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents, but we’ve actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic.</p>

<p>‘We’re not ready for the next epidemic.’</p>
<p>Although it turns out that he and his wife were very much ready.</p>

<p>Melinda Gates told BBC Radio 5Live that her family ‘had prepared’ for years for a pandemic like coronavirus.</p>
<p>‘We had done some preparation, yes. A number of years ago we had talked about what if there isn’t clean water, what if there wasn’t enough food, where might we go, what might we do as a family,’ she explained.</p>
<p>‘Absolutely we had prepared and had some food in the basement in case we needed. But now we’re all in the same situation. There are no tools, there was nothing we could do specifically to prepare ourselves with a particular drug or vaccine.</p>
<p>‘This is a disease we are all in together and what we mostly talk about now in our home every night is how lucky we are.’</p>
<p>Gates went on to say that her family were all wearing masks when out in public.</p>
<p>‘When I’m outdoors you bet I am and you bet our kids are as well. I’m certainly seeing it much more in Seattle.</p>
<p>‘At the grocery store everybody has a mask on. We might be in that situation for 18 months or 2 years, but ok. Then that’s something new that we adopt.’</p>

<p>Considering Bill has topped the list of wealthiest individuals in the world for years, it’s probably not hard to stockpile a few essentials. But even without Gates’ wealth there are a collective of people known as ‘preppers’ who make sure they’re ready for any eventuality.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The survivalist movement is broad enough to include those who build up provisions for a minor power cut through to those who build nuclear bunkers, stockpile secret weapons and make detailed plans for living beyond the apocalypse.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, they’re probably dealing with the current coronavirus lockdown quite well. Here’s what happened when Metro.co.uk met three UK preppers earlier this year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, according to Melinda Gates, Germany and South Korea are setting the gold standard for nations in dealing with the pandemic.</p>
<p>‘From what we’ve seen about how they’ve conducted tests, how they’ve grouped their swift response, how they’re helping people do this physical distancing and isolation I think they are exemplars for the world,’ she said.</p>

<p>After Bill Gates criticized President Trump&rsquo;s decision to halt funding to the World Health Organization, his charitable foundation boosted its contribution to fight the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation announced it would give an additional $150 million to fight COVID-19, bringing its total contribution so far to $250 million.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From day one, the foundation has embraced a data-led, evidence-based approach to improving health, reducing poverty, and expanding opportunity,&rdquo; the foundation&rsquo;s CEO, Mark Suzman, wrote in a blog post. &ldquo;We rely on scientific and technical expertise. Together, these building blocks mean that in addition to our financial resources, we have the capacity and capability to play a significant role in the COVID-19 response.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BILL GATES SAYS US MISSED CHANCE TO AVOID CORONAVIRUS SHUTDOWN, BUSINESSES SHOULD STAY CLOSED</p>
<p>In February, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation committed up to $100 million to help fight against the virus, $20 million of which went toward groups such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO.</p>
<p>Suzman added that the funds would go to a number of different initiatives, including &ldquo;protecting vulnerable communities in the United States,&rdquo; developing and delivering both treatments and vaccines for the novel coronavirus, as well as accelerating detection of the virus and &ldquo;supporting countries in Africa and South Asia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gates, who co-founded Microsoft and is worth some $104 billion according to Forbes, said the virus needs to be eradicated around the globe, regardless of country.</p>
<p>“COVID-19 doesn’t obey border laws. Even if most countries succeed in slowing the disease over the next few months, the virus could return if the pandemic remains severe enough elsewhere,” Gates said in a press release. “The world community must understand that so long as COVID-19 is somewhere, we need to act as if it were everywhere. Beating this pandemic will require an unprecedented level of international funding and cooperation.”</p>
<p>The release specifically mentioned the WHO, saying that organizations &ldquo;such as the World Health Organization (WHO), national governments, and private companies will need to be involved in funding the at-risk manufacturing of vaccine candidates and deciding how to ensure equitable access to essential products for populations worldwide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Melinda Gates, the foundation&rsquo;s co-chair along with her husband, said the response to the pandemic &ldquo;will not be effective unless it is also equitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“We have a responsibility to meet this global crisis with global solidarity,&rdquo; Melinda added. &ldquo;In addition to contributing to the development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines, these funds will support efforts against COVID-19 in low-and-middle-income countries, where local leaders and healthcare workers are doing heroic work to protect vulnerable communities and slow the spread of the disease.”</p>
<p>&lsquo;SIGNIFICANT&rsquo; CORONAVIRUS MUTATION DISCOVERED, COULD MAKE VACCINE SEARCH &lsquo;FUTILE,&rsquo; STUDY SAYS</p>
<p>In addition to the $150 million commitment, the foundation will &ldquo;also leverage a portion of its $2.5 billion Strategic Investment Fund&rdquo; to help fight COVID-19.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Gates criticized Trump&rsquo;s announcement to halt U.S. funding to the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halting funding for the World Health Organization during a world health crisis is as dangerous as it sounds,&rdquo; Gates tweeted. &ldquo;Their work is slowing the spread of COVID-19 and if that work is stopped no other organization can replace them. The world needs @WHO now more than ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Trump said the U.S. would halt funding to the WHO while it undergoes a 60-to-90 day investigation into the organization, saying it had put &ldquo;political correctness over lifesaving measures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The U.S. is the WHO&rsquo;s largest single donor, and the State Department had previously planned to provide the agency with $893 million in the current two-year funding period. Trump said the U.S. contributes roughly $400 to $500 million per year to WHO, while China offers only about $40 million. The money saved will go to areas that &ldquo;most need it,&rdquo; Trump asserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have deep concerns over whether America&rsquo;s generosity has been put to the best use possible,&rdquo; Trump said, accusing the WHO of failing to adequately keep the international community apprised of the threat of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The WHO failed in this duty, and must be held accountable,&rdquo; Trump went on. He added that the WHO had ignored &ldquo;credible information&rdquo; in December 2019 that the virus could be transmitted from human to human.</p>
