HOUSTON – April 2nd is World Autism Awareness Day and KPRC 2 is once again proud to partner with Autism Speaks to help support families across the Houston area.</p>
<p>Today as part of World Autism Awareness Day, KPRC2 Owen Conflenti is reading a book written by a local mom and illustrated by her son who is an award-winning artist and advocate for others on the autism spectrum like himself. Big thanks to Jigsaw Grant and LongTale Publishing for allowing us to share the book “Grant the Jigsaw Giraffe: Different is More” with you today. After the story, KPRC2 Britta Merwin has an interview with the author and illustrator. Autism Speaks Houston. Posted by KPRC2 / Click2Houston on Thursday, April 2, 2020</p>
<p>This year in honor of the day, KPRC 2 anchor Owen Conflenti read “Grant the Jigsaw Giraffe: Different is More” on Facebook Live. The book, published by LongTale Publishing, was written by local mom Julie Coy and was illustrated by her son Grant. Grant is an award-winning artist who has a knack for recycling materials like paper, magazines, even puzzle pieces to create amazing collages. After hearing the book, you can check out his incredible gallery here.</p>
<p>KPRC 2 meteorologist Britta Merwin also interviewed Grant and his mom in order to help raise additional awareness about autism in the month of April.</p>
<p>Britta initially connected with Grant and his mom because of her own personal connection to autism. One of Britta’s sons is on the spectrum and she has publicly shared her experiences in order to help other parents be advocates for their own children. You can find Britta’s “Parent’s Guide to Autism” whenever you need it on our website.

<h3 id="autism-awareness-day-people-across-the-globe-light-it-up-blue-to-extend-support">Autism Awareness Day: People Across The Globe &lsquo;light It Up Blue&rsquo; To Extend Support</h3>

World Autism Awareness Day was celebrated on April 2 to commemorate the individuals that are diagnosed with the autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is a lifelong developmental disability that makes the individuals perceive the surrounding information differently, as per the National Autistic Society (NAS). The disorder can hamper an individual’s communication and their ability for social interaction. They might also experience over or under-sensitivity to sounds, touch, tastes, smells, light, colours, temperatures or pain.</p>
<p>This year, the World Autism Awareness Day was celebrated amid the global pandemic. The United Nations wrote on its official website, “On World Autism Awareness Day, we recognize and celebrate the rights of persons with autism. This year’s observance takes place in the midst of a public health crisis unlike any other in our lifetimes — a crisis that places persons with autism at disproportionate risk as a result of the coronavirus.” It further added, “Universal human rights, including the rights of persons with disabilities, must not be infringed upon in the time of a pandemic. Governments have a responsibility to ensure that their response includes persons with autism.”</p>
<p>Today is the World #Autism Awareness Day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Light it up blue&rdquo;</p>
<p>The communities worldwide came together, despite the global health emergency, united in support of the autistic individuals by lighting the homes and the landmarks blue to display inclusivity. The theme “light it up blue” trended in recognition and support of the autistic people. People took to social media to appreciate and educate about Autism to foster support worldwide. Internet users shared pictures of their loved ones or someone they knew who was autistic and their inspiring stories.</p>
<p>April is &ldquo;Autism Awareness&rdquo; month, &amp; today (April 2nd) is &ldquo;Autism Awareness&rdquo; day. So here&rsquo;s a thread of some important things to keep in mind. While the masses tend to call it &ldquo;Autism Awareness&rdquo; month/day, that&rsquo;s frowned upon. The preferred term is &ldquo;Autism Acceptance&rdquo; month/day. — 🌺 Lea 🌺 @ 🌟🦉🐸🚂🐞 (@LeaC_Official) April 2, 2020</p>
