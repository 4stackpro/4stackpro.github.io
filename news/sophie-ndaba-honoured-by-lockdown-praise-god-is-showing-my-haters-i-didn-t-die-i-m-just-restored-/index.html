Social media was flooded with messages of praise for the star and her name was trending on Twitter for two days straight.</p>
<p>Humbled by the love, Sophie took to social media to thank the nation for their support. She also hailed director Mandla N as the best in Mzansi and thanked his team for choosing her when she had so often been typecast.</p>
<p>“I&rsquo;m just so thankful that God never leaves nor forsakes us. Thank you SA for sharing your wonderful warm messages on my social media platforms and personally. I always knew 2020 is my year of restoration all round and Jeremiah 29:11 to 13 confirms just that. Listen people the best is yet to come. Thank you.”</p>
<p>Sophie&rsquo;s “restoration” comes after years of battling diabetes, weight loss and death rumours.</p>
<p>She said it was time for God to show her haters that she was alive and flourishing.</p>
<p>“All the haters out there, my God is showing you I never died. I&rsquo;m just restored!” she said.</p>
<p>In a sit-down interview with TshisaLIVE earlier this year, Sophie explained that her personal challenges helped shape how she portrayed Palesa.</p>
<p>“You know they always say, find somebody who died in your family and just become emotional. For me, I draw from the womanhood. I draw from the woman that I am. I draw from the things that I have been through.”
