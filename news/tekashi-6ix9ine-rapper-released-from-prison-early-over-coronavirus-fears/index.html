Lawyer argued 6ix9ine, who had been called a ‘model prisoner’, faced higher risks because of his severe asthma</p>
<p>The rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine was released from federal prison early Thursday afternoon to serve the final months of his sentence in home confinement, over fears the rapper’s health would be severely impacted if he were to contract coronavirus while incarcerated.</p>
<p>6ix9ine, whose real name is Daniel Hernandez, is serving a two-year sentence for his entanglement with a violent street gang, and was set for an early release from prison in August. In March, a judge had called the 23-year-old a “model prisoner”.</p>
<p>The decision to release 6ix9ine to home confinement comes as New York City is battling the spread of the coronavirus, including in prisons and jails. Figures published by the Legal Aid Society on Tuesday indicated there were at least 180 cases of coronavirus in New York City jails. High profile Rikers Island inmate Harvey Weinstein reportedly tested positive for the virus last week.</p>
<p>Bill de Blasio, the New York City mayor, announced last week that at least 900 inmates in the city had already been released because of the spread of Covid-19.</p>

<p>Lance Lazzaro, 6ix9ine’s lawyer, argued the rapper faced higher risks from the coronavirus because of his severe asthma. Other convicted celebrities in confinement, including R Kelly and Bill Cosby, are making similar arguments to also push for early releases.</p>
<p>6ix9ine was convicted in November 2018 for his involvement in the Nine Trey Bloods gang and charges of racketeering, drug trafficking and firearm offenses. The Brooklyn rapper, who found success through the “Soundcloud rap explosion” and became well known for his outlandish persona, worked with federal officials in their investigation of his gang in exchange for reduced prison time.</p>
<p>Lazzaro has said 6ix9ine does not plan to enter a witness protection program, as many have speculated the rapper would due to expected retaliations from gang members. “He hopes to resume his career,” Lazzaro said on Thursday.</p>
<p>States across the nation – from Texas to California – have begun releasing inmates, hoping to avoid repeats of the massive spread of coronavirus in the New York system. The top doctor at the Rikers Island complex said this week that the jail is a “public health disaster unfolding before our eyes”. The number of confirmed cases at Rikers spiked from one to nearly 200 n just 12 days, Ross MacDonald, the jail’s chief physician, said.

<h3 id="6ix9ines-lawyer-says-rapper-can-release-music-in-home-confinement-could-be-back-on-social-media">6ix9ine’s Lawyer Says Rapper Can Release Music in Home Confinement, Could Be Back on Social Media</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/nnimig4qzacwznkzmbmz/tekashi-6ix9ine-music-home-confinement-kevin-mazur" alt="img">
Now that Tekashi 6ix9ine is no longer beyond bars, people have a lot of questions about what’s next for the rapper. But now one thing is more clear: there will be more music soon.</p>
<p>Complex caught up with the rapper’s attorney Dawn Florio just hours after it became public that 6ix9ine was out of prison. The rapper was released from the Queens Detention Facility, where he was being held, to home confinement. He’ll spend the final four months of his 24-month sentence at home because his asthma puts him in a high-risk group of contracting COVID-19 in prison.</p>
<p>When asked if the terms of his home confinement included the ability to put out new tracks, Florio was unequivocal.</p>
<p>“Yes, he can release music,” she said.</p>
<p>But what kind of music? Florio confirmed that earlier reports about 6ix9ine re-upping with his label 10K Projects were true.</p>
<p>“What he’s gonna do is, he already has that advance for 10K Projects,” Florio explained. “So he has to put out a Spanish album and an English album. So that’s what he’s going to be working on.”</p>
<p>Just prior to speaking with Complex, coincidentally, Florio said she was speaking with 6ix9ine’s entertainment attorney Bob Celestin, planning the rapper’s return.</p>
<p>“We were actually trying to figure out the logistics of how that’s going to work,” she revealed. “It’s more difficult because of the coronavirus, because you don’t want strange people coming in to set up a studio where he’s going to be.”</p>
<p>But they don’t want to wait too long to build that studio. Florio told Complex that her conversation with Celestin made clear that new 6ix9ine music has to come soon.</p>
<p>“He already got an advance for all those millions of dollars,” she recalled the entertainment lawyer explaining to her. “So he&rsquo;s gotta put out those two albums as soon as possible. I can confirm that from Bob.”</p>
<p>And what about social media? Will 6ix9ine continue to keep the Instagram-using masses entertained while they’re waiting for him to finish his songs? Looking at the available paperwork, Complex came to the conclusion that he could. Florio agreed.</p>
<p>“So far, I haven’t seen any restrictions about him not being able to go on social media,” she said. But there is a condition.</p>
<p>“Obviously, it has to be in good taste. No more trolling,” Florio laughed.

<p><img src="https://remezcla.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1021309802.jpg" alt="img">
While hundreds of prisoners are being forced to carry out their sentences in the increasingly unsafe Rikers (along with hundreds of other correctional facilities around the country), it seems as though 6ix9ine could be given the privilege of serving the remainder of his sentence from home. According to XXL, the “Gummo” rapper could be released from prison any day now, as concern about the spread of Coronavirus has changed the judge’s mind about potentially releasing the rapper early.</p>
<p>6ix9ine was recently sentenced to 24 months, and with time-served, was expected to be in prison until August.</p>
<p>People on social media were quick to point out that the internet may soon be subjected to his insufferable online presence.</p>
