// Lidl reveals new measures to protect workers’ rights in its global supply chains during the coronavirus pandemic</p>
<p>// Includes providing more supplier info, steps to prevent modern slavery &amp; a tackling wages that fall short of a living wage</p>
<p>// The commitments follow months of campaigning by nearly 40,000 Oxfam supporters</p>
<p>Lidl has reportedly announced new measures to protect the rights of overseas workers in its global supply chains during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The measures include strengthening its policy on human rights, providing more information about its suppliers, taking steps to prevent modern slavery and to ensure equal treatment for women, and a promise to tackle wages of workers which fall well short of a living wage.</p>
<p>The commitments follow months of campaigning by nearly 40,000 Oxfam supporters in both the UK and The Netherlands.</p>

<p>Retail Gazette has contacted Lidl for comment.</p>
<p>Oxfam said the German supermarket chain is one of the largest food retailers in the world, with more than 10,000 stores in 32 countries.</p>
<p>Lidl is currently bottom of Oxfam’s Behind the Barcodes scorecard, which assesses the policies and practices needed to ensure that human and labour rights are fully respected in supermarkets’ global food supply chains.</p>
<p>With an overall score of just nine per cent, Lidl had previously made the least progress since Oxfam’s campaign was launched in 2018.</p>
<p>“For the first time, Lidl has promised specific steps to ensure fair and equal treatment for women,” Oxfam ethical trade manager Rachel Wilshaw said.</p>
<p>“We are particularly encouraged by this change, as over the last two years, Lidl has scored zero points in our assessment of their policies to protect women workers.</p>
<p>“We know that women tend to be clustered in the lowest-paid and least secure jobs in food supply chains, so this acknowledgement has the potential to transform lives.”</p>
<p>Oxfam said it would continue to engage with Lidl to ensure the new policies benefit workers in the supermarket’s supply chains.</p>
<p>The charity’s Behind the Barcodes campaign aims to improve the lives of the millions around the world producing food for supermarkets, many of whom are trapped in poverty and face brutal working conditions.</p>
<p>In the UK, the campaign is focused on the six major UK grocers: Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda, Morrisons, Aldi and Lidl.</p>
<p>“We are all very grateful for the role supermarkets and their staff in the UK are playing to provide food and support during the coronavirus crisis,” Wilshaw said.</p>
<p>“At the same time, it’s important that the rights of vulnerable workers in poor countries who produce our food are protected and we welcome this significant progress from Lidl during this time of disruption.”</p>

<p><img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article12941599.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_11Discount-Stores-Aldi-And-Lidl-Increase-Their-Popularity.jpg" alt="img">

<p>German discounter Lidl has made a string of sweeping changes to help speed up transactions as coronavirus numbers continue to rise in the UK.</p>
<p>The chain said it&rsquo;s changing opening times and putting measures in place to protect staff at checkouts.</p>
<p>It comes after Sainsbury&rsquo;s today announced plans to reopen petrol stations across the UK, to help more customers pick up essential items.</p>
<p>Bosses are also extending opening times at Sainsbury&rsquo;s Local branches, while all other stores will open until 10pm to reduce social distancing queues outside.</p>
<p>Over the past month, several supermarkets have implemented new measures to help cope with the coronavirus outbreak - including priority hours for vulnerable shoppers and NHS workers.</p>
<p>This week, Asda also confirmed it&rsquo;s introduced a &lsquo;no touch&rsquo; policy, urging customers to only pick up items they intend to buy.</p>
<p>It comes as latest figures show coronavirus has now claimed 18,738 lives in the UK, though ministers have now warned the UK is over the &lsquo;peak&rsquo; of the crisis.</p>
<p>Opening hours</p>
<p>Most stores are now open from 8am to 10pm on Monday to Saturday, and from 11am to 5pm on Sundays.</p>
<p>Lidl is advising shoppers to check their local store before visiting as opening hours are likely to have changed.</p>
<p>Protective screens at tills</p>
<p>Lidl has installed cough and sneeze proof screens at each of the checkouts to help protect store teams and customers.</p>
<p>Increased contactless payment limit</p>
<p>The chain has also increased the contactless payment limit to £45 in all stores to help reduce cash handling.</p>
<p>Bakery changes</p>
<p>All items in Lidl&rsquo;s bakery aisles are now being pre-packed by staff to help ensure they remain safe to eat.</p>
<p>Busiest and quietest times in stores</p>
<p>Lidl has updated its information about the busiest and quietest times to shop in stores. The chain has shared the following:</p>
<p>8am to 11am: Busy</p>
<p>11am to 2pm: Average</p>
<p>2pm - to close: Quiet</p>
<p>Rationing limits</p>
<p>Lidl has now lifted stockpiling restrictions on all items apart from toilet paper.</p>
<p>The chain said it is reverting to its previous policy of allowing all customers to purchase &lsquo;usual household&rsquo; quantities again.</p>
<p>This is, as ever, at the store manager’s discretion and Lidl asks for continued consideration for colleagues and other customers when shopping in store.

<p>A major report by consumer watchdog Which? has revealed which supermarket in the UK is the cheapest when it comes to your weekly shopping.</p>
<p>The survey compared 108 products from the groceries and household aisles to see how much a trolley-full would be at each of the country&rsquo;s major supermarkets.</p>
<p>The report compares Aldi and Lidl - the Germa bargain chains - with the big brands including Sainsbury&rsquo;s, Tesco, Asda, Waitrose and Morrisons.</p>
<p>According to Which? The cheapest supermarket in the country is Aldi - where the 108 items cost £111.</p>
<p>That was two pounds cheaper than their nearest rival Lidl.</p>
<p>Outside of the budget retailers, Asda was cheapest, with the equivalent trolley costing £123.</p>
<p>The same shopping at Tesco was £140 and at Sainsbury&rsquo;s would have cost you £144.</p>
<p>At Morrisons it was £143) while Waitrose charges £175 for the equivalent selection.</p>
<p>The shopping included everything from own-brand yoghurts and vegetables to popular branded items such as shampoo ad spreads.</p>
<p>But according to Which? while Aldi and Lidl offered the lowest prices overall they are not always cheapest on branded products.</p>
<p>The watchdog says some of the biggest price differences were in the branded ranges - with Asda often coming in cheapest.</p>
<p>Head &amp; Shoulders Classic Clean Shampoo (500ml) costs £5.15 at Waitrose or £3.42 at Asda.</p>
<p>Knorr Vegetable Stock Pot (4 x 28g) is £1.49 at Aldi and Waitrose and 99p at Lidl.</p>
<p>Patak’s Madras Paste Pots (2 x 70g) is £1.60 at Morrisons and 99p at Aldi and Lidl.</p>
<p>PG Tips Pyramid Tea Bags (240) are £5.99 at Waitrose and £3.53 at Asda.</p>
<p>Which? writes: &ldquo;Based on our results, it seems that if there are certain brands you would always choose over supermarket own-labels, it can pay to shop around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which also compared prices for a larger trolley of 193 products (the original 108, plus 85 more) with more branded items, excluding Aladi and Lidl which don&rsquo;t always sell a full range of branded goods.</p>
<p>Here Asda cost £295 – £25 less than Morrisons. and Waitrose was most expensive at £376.</p>
<p>Using data from an independent price comparison website, Which? calculated the average price (including special offers but not multibuys) for each item throughout the month.</p>
<p>It added those individual averages together to give an overall price for the trolley at each shop for the month.</p>
<p>You can read the full report on the Which? website
