London (CNN) British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been receiving oxygen treatment for coronavirus in intensive care, a senior member of the Cabinet confirmed.</p>
<p>Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said in an interview with the BBC that the Prime Minister was &ldquo;not on a ventilator&rdquo; but had &ldquo;received oxygen support.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told BBC Radio 4&rsquo;s Today program that Johnson was &ldquo;receiving the very best care&rdquo; at St. Thomas&rsquo; Hospital in London, after being taken into intensive care at 7 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET) on Monday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of course, one of the reasons for being in intensive care is to make sure that whatever support the medical team consider to be appropriate can be provided,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Johnson&rsquo;s hospitalization has highlighted the lack of a formal line of succession in the UK government. Johnson nominated the Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, who also holds the title of First Secretary of State, to deputize for him &ldquo;where necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="boris-johnson-moved-to-intensive-care-unit-with-coronavirus-symptoms">Boris Johnson moved to intensive care unit with coronavirus symptoms</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200406162636-boris-johnson-december-2019-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
London (CNN) UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was moved to an intensive care unit Monday after his condition with coronavirus symptoms &ldquo;worsened,&rdquo; his office has said.</p>
<p>Johnson, 55, was first admitted to St Thomas&rsquo; Hospital in London on Sunday evening for what he said were &ldquo;routine tests,&rdquo; saying on social media that he was in &ldquo;good spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the apparent change in the leader&rsquo;s health has shocked the nation, with politicians from his party and the opposition voicing their support for the leader, as the country battles an outbreak that has killed more than 5,000 people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the course of this afternoon, the condition of the Prime Minister has worsened and, on the advice of his medical team, he has been moved to the Intensive Care Unit at the hospital,&rdquo; a Downing Street spokesperson said.</p>
<p>According to Downing Street officials, Johnson remains conscious and has been moved to the intensive care unit as a precaution, in case he requires ventilation.</p>
<p>The move strikes a sharp contrast to earlier reports on Johnson&rsquo;s condition: During his period of self-isolation, Downing Street had said that Johnson&rsquo;s symptoms were &ldquo;mild,&rdquo; and on Sunday said his hospitalization was just a &quot; precautionary step .&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prime Minister&rsquo;s spokesperson had said earlier on Monday that Johnson spent a &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; night in hospital, but would not comment on reports Johnson was given oxygen. Officials are no longer describing his symptoms as mild.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is the First Secretary of State and the most senior Cabinet minister, said Johnson had asked him to deputize for the leader where necessary.</p>
<p>Raab chaired Monday&rsquo;s regular morning coronavirus briefing and made a televised statement saying that the government will continue Johnson&rsquo;s direction in responding to the outbreak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The government&rsquo;s business will continue and the Prime Minister is in safe hands with a brilliant team at St Thomas&rsquo;s hospital. And the focus of the government will continue to be on making sure that the Prime Minister&rsquo;s direction, all the plans for making sure that we can defeat coronavirus and can pull the country through this challenge, will be taken forward,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He added there was an &ldquo;incredibly strong team spirit&rdquo; in government behind the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Johnson was moved to the intensive care unit at around 7 p.m., Downing Street said. The decision was made by the leader&rsquo;s medical team after his condition worsened over the afternoon on Monday.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom&rsquo;s death toll of above 5,000 is one of the highest in the world. The government has been scrambling to implement widespread testing as evidence grows that asymptomatic people could carry and spread the virus.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Together we will beat this,&rsquo; Johnson said</p>
<p>Johnson was hospitalized Sunday because he was still suffering coronavirus symptoms 10 days after testing positive for the virus.</p>
<p>The British leader announced on March 27 that he had been infected and was, at the time, suffering mild symptoms including a cough and fever.</p>
<p>At the time, he vowed to continue leading the nation&rsquo;s response to the outbreak and hold meetings via video-conference, saying in a video: &ldquo;Together we will beat this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>British politicians from Johnson&rsquo;s ruling Conservative Party, as well as the main opposition Labour Party, have united in their wishes for the Prime Minister&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>Treasurer Rishi Sunak said on Twitter that his thoughts were with Johnson and his pregnant fiancée, Carrie Symonds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know he&rsquo;ll be getting the best care possible and will come out of this even stronger,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Symonds has also experienced Covid-19 symptoms but said over the weekend she was &ldquo;on the mend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The leader of the country&rsquo;s House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, said Johnson&rsquo;s admission to intensive care was &ldquo;terrible news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the thoughts and prayers of everyone across the House are with the Prime Minister and his family right now. We all wish him a speedy recovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A still from a video that UK Prime MInister Boris Johnson uploaded on March 27 to announce he had been infected.</p>
<p>Keir Starmer, the newly elected leader of the main opposition Labour Party said the development was &ldquo;Terribly sad news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the country&rsquo;s thoughts are with the Prime Minister and his family during this incredibly difficult time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And former Prime Minister Theresa May, who was replaced by Johnson in the country&rsquo;s Brexit crisis, also sent her wishes to the leader on Twitter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My thoughts and prayers are with @BorisJohnson and his family as he continues to receive treatment in hospital. This horrific virus does not discriminate. Anyone can get it. Anyone can spread it. Please #StayHomeSaveLives,&rdquo; May wrote.</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron also sent his wishes. &ldquo;I send all my support to Boris Johnson, to his family and to the British people at this difficult moment. I wish him a speedy recovery at this testing time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump responded to the news during a daily press conference, and said that his administration had been in contact with Johnson&rsquo;s doctors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also want to send best wishes to a very good friend of mine and a friend of our nation Prime Minster Boris Johnson. We&rsquo;re very saddened to hear that he was taken into intensive care this a little while ago,&rdquo; Trump said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been a really good friend. He&rsquo;s been really something very special. Strong. Resolute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve contacted all of Boris&rsquo;s doctors, and we&rsquo;ll see what is going to take place, but they are ready to go,&rdquo; Trump continued. &ldquo;When you are brought into intensive care that gets very, very serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are working with London with respect to Boris Johnson,&rdquo; he concluded.</p>
<p>Last night, on the advice of my doctor, I went into hospital for some routine tests as I&rsquo;m still experiencing coronavirus symptoms. I&rsquo;m in good spirits and keeping in touch with my team, as we work together to fight this virus and keep everyone safe. — Boris Johnson #StayHomeSaveLives (@BorisJohnson) April 6, 2020</p>
<p>Before being moved to intensive care, Johnson had said he was keeping in touch with his team and thanked staff at Britain&rsquo;s National Health Service for taking care of him.

<h3 id="coronavirus-live-updates-uk-prime-minister-in-icu-infections-slow-in-new-york-china-reports-no-deaths">Coronavirus Live Updates: U.K. Prime Minister in I.C.U.; Infections Slow in New York; China Reports No Deaths</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2020/03/04/corona-virus-social-images/assets/promo.jpg?u=1586254304483" alt="img">
You’re looking at a virtual reality image of a coronavirus patient at George Washington Hospital in Washington, D.C. The patient is a generally healthy 59-year-old man with high blood pressure. Just days before this image was created, he was asymptomatic. But now, those green areas show where the infection has damaged tissue in the lungs. For many, Covid-19 will be mild, but for others it’s deadly. This video is about the latter path: How the virus kills. We’ll start in China: 191 confirmed Covid-19 patients were in a hospital in Wuhan — 54 died. Of those 54, 50 had a condition known as ARDS, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. It’s a condition that stops oxygen from reaching the organs. “You have air hunger.” “It means that they can’t breathe.” “There’s a very strong correlation between the people who develop ARDS and the people who die.” ARDS is not unique to Covid-19. “It’s such a long list of causes: infection, people with H.I.V./AIDS. If you get into a big motor vehicle accident and sustain multiple injuries to multiple organs, that causes ARDS, SARS and MERS. Now, things that you inhale and that can be toxic can cause ARDS: household bleach, you know, war gases, mustard gas and phosgene. To the people who vaped THC that was contaminated with vitamin E acetate, and those patients were also developing ARDS.” Here’s what’s actually happening when you get ARDS. When we breathe in air, oxygen goes down our windpipe and fills the lungs. Specifically, the small air sacs at the end of the lungs are the key to air exchange in the body. “So that’s why nature has created, or evolution has created, this very, very — the barrier is so thin. It’s just a few micrometers in size. So the oxygen has to go through just a little bit of collagen, the cell that lines the alveolus, into the red blood cell. Once it gets into the red blood cell, then the blood takes it back into the heart and from there to the rest of the body.” And this is the key to understanding why Covid-19 is killing people. “That entire wall of the air sac gets damaged by the virus. Think of it like a thick layer of paint on the inside of the walls of a room or a thick layer of mold on the walls on the inside of the room. That’s what it looks like.” As that wall becomes thicker, oxygen can no longer pass into the bloodstream, and your organs begin to suffocate. So if you are sick, you might be asking yourself: Am I on the mild path or the serious path? A good indication is whether you have severe shortness of breath and for how long. Those are indications the virus has progressed lower into the lungs. One small study of hospitalized patients in China found that zero to two days after development of symptoms, chest scans were coming back normal for more than half of patients. Keep in mind, these are patients that were sick enough to be in the hospital. But within three to five days after symptoms started, that flipped, and 91 percent of hospitalized patients had significant respiratory issues. “As you progress beyond the seven to 10 days stage, that’s when the ARDS seems to be developing. And once it develops, it develops rapidly fast compared to ARDS developing from let’s say another cause. And these patients seem to be doing much worse over a relatively faster period of time.” Many people have mild or even no symptoms with the virus. But the longer Covid-19 affects your lungs, the higher the risk of serious respiratory issues. “And the longer you’re on the ventilator, the less likelihood you will come off the ventilator. That is the blunt truth of this situation.” “When I saw this in our first patient, and you see the extent of the damage and how it affects both lungs and various parts of the lungs, and it’s much more striking even for somebody who’s been in practice for almost 20 years.” And that’s what happened to this patient. “Just about one week after being at our hospital, unfortunately he passed away. Really my goal of trying to get this out into the public is so that they understand the severity of the problem that we’re seeing, and why the social distancing and the flatten the curve, and every other hashtag that’s come up in the past couple weeks, is just so, so important — is because this is a community-wide problem. It’s a global problem, and it’s going to take a community solution. Right? Everybody has a role to play. And if you’re not in the health care field right now, your role is to stay home. All right? Because again, the virus doesn’t move on its own. People move. People transmit the virus.” Gov. Cuomo: “And the longer you’re on the ventilator, the less likelihood you will come off the ventilator.”
