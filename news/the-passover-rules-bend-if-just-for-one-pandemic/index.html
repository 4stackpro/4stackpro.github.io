“We always followed the Ashkenazi tradition,” said Rachel Ringler, 64, a food writer and challah-baking instructor, who will be hosting her Seder over Zoom from Bridgehampton, N.Y., instead of with 30 people in her Manhattan apartment. “We never had rice. We never had lentils. We never even served string beans.”</p>
<p>But she has a son-in-law who is half-Syrian, so she follows different Passover customs.</p>
<p>“I said, ‘We are all Syrian this year,’ ” she said, laughing. “We are stocked with lentils, and so we are going to use those lentils for Passover.”</p>
<p>The Rabbinical Assembly, the international association of Conservative rabbis, has sanctioned eating kitniyot during Passover since 2015. The custom is widespread among Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews with ancestors from Spain, North Africa and the Middle East. In Israel, many follow suit.</p>
<p>This year, the assembly’s Committee on Jewish Law and Standards also offered alternatives for traditional foods on a Seder plate: a roasted beet and rice in place of a shank bone and egg, and any vegetable or fruit “that can bring a tear to the eye” if horseradish isn’t available.</p>
<p>The substitutions won’t be the only thing different on the first night of Passover, which is usually celebrated with a large communal meal with family and friends. Some families who cannot be in the same house plan to cook from the same recipes, as if they were together.</p>
<p>Self-isolating in various homes across the country, some observant Jews might need to embrace technology — normally a no-no — so they can celebrate together. (In Israel, which tightened travel restrictions specifically around the holiday, some are gathering before sundown to celebrate together via Skype or Zoom.)</p>
<p>“We’ve seen rabbis across the board — but especially in the Orthodox community — lowering the bar for Passover,” said Mishael Zion, an Orthodox rabbi who with his father, Noam, wrote “A Night to Remember,” the popular modern version of the Haggadah, the text that guides the Seder. This year, he said, “it’s like the matzo, which is just the basics of bread, water and flour.”

<h3 id="netanyahu-holding-passover-seder-with-his-son-leads-to-criticism">Netanyahu holding Passover Seder with his son leads to criticism</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2020/04/sacascasvasvs-1024x640.png" alt="img">
Questions have been raised about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s son appearing with him in a Passover Seder video, despite the premier repeatedly urging the Israeli public in recent days not to visit family this holiday, and specifically beseeching young people not to hold the traditional meal with their elderly parents — unless they live in the same household — to prevent coronavirus infection.</p>
<p>In the video the 70-year-old Netanyahu is seen alongside the 25-year-old Avner Netanyahu at a Seder table in the Prime Minister’s Residence as the two read from the Haggadah and Avner speaks of the relevance he feels the story of Passover has to the lives of Israelis today (it is traditional for the so-called head of the household to discuss the themes and relevance of Passover to the lives of the younger generation).</p>
<p>The video was apparently pre-filmed before the holiday itself. That raised further questions, as Netanyahu was supposed to be in self-quarantine over the past week due to his contacts with coronavirus patients, which only ended Wednesday night.</p>

<p>Pundits and social media commentators claimed that in order to be with his father at the mock Seder, Avner, who shares an apartment in Jerusalem with his girlfriend, would have had to break social distancing guidelines frequently cited by the prime minister in his television appearances.</p>
<p>Sources close to the prime minister told Channel 13’s Barak Ravid, “In the past month Avner has spent many hours a day at the Prime Minister’s Residence while sleeping in his apartment adjacent to the Prime Minister’s Residence inside the secure compound. Avner behaves according to the directives of the Health Ministry and does not go out anywhere.”</p>

<p>But Ravid questioned what apartment was being referred to, saying he was unaware of the younger Netanyahu having another home besides the one he shares with his partner.</p>
<p>Regardless, many commentators said the premier was setting a bad example by holding a Seder with his child after the public was compelled to avoid such gatherings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, supporters of the prime minister accused critics of looking for ways to attack him, stressing Avner, according to the family’s version, was practically living in the same household in the past weeks and thus allowed to meet with his parents.</p>
<p>Wednesday saw a curfew enforced throughout the country from 3 p.m. until Thursday morning. The curfew was aimed at preventing Israelis from spending the festive holiday meal with family or others, which officials feared could lead to a fresh wave of COVID-19 infections and set back Israel’s efforts against the virus.</p>
<p>With the lifting of the curfew, Israelis could travel more than 100 meters from their homes for essential purposes only, and businesses could reopen, though it was unclear if many would do so during the holiday.</p>
<p>Israelis continued to be barred from leaving their home towns as part of a general lockdown nationwide that won’t be lifted until Friday at 6 a.m. In Jerusalem, which has the most virus cases in the country, residents could not travel beyond the one of seven city designated zones in which they live.</p>
<p>However, the government was set to convene Friday and may further extend the lockdown, according to the Walla news site.</p>
<p>To enforce the curfew, thousands of police officers were deployed throughout Israel, backed by some 1,400 IDF soldiers helping to ensure Israelis adhered to the restrictions.</p>
<p>Confined to their homes and instructed to only spend the holiday with those they live with, many Israelis celebrated the first night of Passover alone, or if less religiously observant, used video chatting programs to connect virtually for the meal.

The &lsquo;This Year Together&rsquo; online event will stream live on Facebook and YouTube on Thursday at 5 p.m. PT.</p>
<p>On the second night of Passover on Thursday, stars Norman Lear, Debra Messing, Chrissy Metz, Emmy Rossum, Sophia Bush, Jamie Lynn Sigler, Mayim Bialik, Emmanuelle Chriqui, Tichina Arnold and more will join together for an online seder.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;This Year Together&rsquo; virtual event, which will feature inspirational poetry, music and readings, led by life coach and spiritual counselor Ryan Weiss, will stream live at 5 p.m. PT on Facebook and YouTube.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether you are unable to spend the holiday with your friends and family while social distancing or are new to Passover and want to deepen your knowledge of the holiday, this will be an immersive experience that everyone can find a home in,&rdquo; Weiss, who hosts daily meditation sessions on his Instagram account, said in a written statement.</p>
<p>The Jewish holiday of Passover marks the time when Jews remember their exodus from slavery in ancient Egypt and the 10 plagues to receiving the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai and freedom. As Passover is a time for reflection for Jews, the event will be non-denominational.</p>
<p>While traditional Passover rituals will be followed, the event will also have a compilation of meditation, music and poetry, plus a call to action to help oppressed communities and reflect on current social injustices, such as access to healthcare, education, affordable housing and issues like climate change and racial inequality, among other topics.
