20歲饒舌歌手YNW Melly涉嫌謀殺正等候判刑，據報他還押期間確診新冠肺炎；至於另一因運毒等多項罪名被判監兩年的饒舌歌手Tekashi 6ix9ine，則因疫情嚴峻，加上他患有哮喘而提早獲釋。</p>
<p>至於早前確診的女歌手Sara Bareilles自稱正在康復，對於能再呼吸順暢，十分感恩。另外，現年41歲的百老匯演員Nick Codero在深切治療部，據悉他在昏迷狀態，而且要依賴呼吸機，但經過兩次新冠病毒測試都呈陰性反應。

<p>Friends and fans of comedy legend Eddie Large have been sharing their memories of the star – and how he made them laugh.</p>
<p>People have taken to social media to share their experiences, from meeting Eddie in Portishead to working with him on stage.</p>
<p>The 78-year-old died in the early hours of Thursday (April 2) after contracting coronavirus while being treated in Bristol’s Southmead Hospital for heart problems.</p>
<p>Eddie, who lived at Portishead Marina with wife Patsy, had been in hospital for a couple of weeks undergoing treatment before his death.</p>
<p>His son Ryan announced his father’s passing in an emotional post on Facebook.</p>
<p>Musician Geoff Barrow from the band Portishead recalled how he bumped into Eddie in his hometown as a teenager.</p>
<p>He posted: “As teenagers we used to see him all the time going shopping.</p>
<p>“We used to shout ‘hey Eddie, where’s Syd? He used to point at his car and reply, “He’s in the boot!!!!!” Ahh… them were the days. RIP Eddie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fan Edgar Wright shared how he saw Eddie while driving along the M5.</p>
<p>He said: “In the 80s my family were on the M5 overtaking a car with a massive Little and Large decal on the back.</p>
<p>(Image: Getty Images)</p>
<p>“I was bemused a sticker even existed then floored to see Eddie Large himself driving (with Syd in shotgun).</p>
<p>“I waved furiously.</p>
<p>“My first celebrity sighting and still the best. RIP.”</p>
<p>Matthew Sweet worked with Eddie and Syd at a night last year at the Bristol Old Vic during the city’s slapstick festival.</p>
<p>Mr Sweet said: “I am so, so sad to see that Eddie Large has gone.</p>
<p>“Last year at @slapstickfest we got him back together with Syd for a night at the Bristol Old Vic.</p>
<p>“They’d not performed together for years. It was hilarious of course.”</p>
<p>Keith Povall also shared a funny tale of when Eddie visited his showroom.</p>
<p>Posting on Twitter Mr Povall said: “Eddie Large came into our showroom saying his wife’s tape player was all muffled.</p>
<p>“My colleague said s**t on the tape head.</p>
<p>“Eddie replied, “I tried that and it made it worse. True #EddieLarge story.”</p>
<p>Ian Blyth posted how lifelong Man City fan Eddie helped him and a friend out at a match.</p>
<p>(Image: PA)</p>
<p>Mr Blyth said: “Me and my mate Steve went to Highbury to see City.</p>
<p>“We got to London using Persil vouchers but we didn’t have the money to get in.</p>
<p>“Eddie saw us sat on the steps outside the ground, had a chat with us then popped back with two tickets for the posh seats.</p>
<p>“We lost 2 nil.”</p>
<p>Fellow comedians have also shared stories about Eddie’s kindness.</p>
<p>Comedian and actor Lenny Henry posted on Twitter: “Midnight matinee Great Yarmouth 1978. They finished part one.</p>
<p>“I’d never heard laughter like it. Rude, raucous and rollicking</p>
<p>“Dunno how they did it but Eddie’s energy and electricity and impressions and props and improve were hugely impressive. RIP.”</p>
<p>Comedian and actor Les Dennis shared how he met Eddie on the TV talent show Opportunity Knocks – the show that kick started Little and Large’s career.</p>
<p>Mr Dennis tweeted: “When I was 17 I was on Opportunity Knocks. I was incredibly nervous.</p>
<p>“Two lovely men sat in the canteen with me at Thames TV and helped calm me down.</p>

<p>“I’ll never forget the kindness of Syd and Eddie. RIP Eddie Large.”</p>
<p>Eddie underwent a heart transplant at Papworth Hospital in Cambridge in 2003 at the age of 62.</p>
<p>The star’s devastated family described how proud they were of him,</p>
<p>In a statement his son Ryan said: “He had been suffering with heart failure and unfortunately, whilst in hospital, contracted the coronavirus, which his heart was sadly not strong enough to fight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will miss him terribly&rsquo;</p>
<p>“Dad had fought bravely for so long.</p>
<p>“Due to this horrible disease we had been unable to visit him at the hospital but all of the family and close friends spoke to him every day.</p>
<p>“We will miss him terribly and we are so proud of everything he achieved in his career with Syd and know that he was much loved by the millions that watched them each week.</p>
<p>“RIP Dad. We love you and miss you from all the family.”

<h3 id="eddie-large-dies-british-comedian-had-contracted-coronavirus">Eddie Large Dies: British Comedian Had Contracted Coronavirus</h3>
<p><img src="https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_8986819r-e1585838097740.jpg?w=1024" alt="img">
Eddie Large, a British comedian who was best known as being one half of the Little and Large double act, has died after suffering with coronavirus. He was 78.</p>
<p>His son, Ryan McGinnis, confirmed the news on Facebook. “It is with great sadness that Mum and I need to announce that my dad passed away in the early hours of this morning. He had been suffering with heart failure and unfortunately, whilst in hospital, contracted the coronavirus, which his heart was sadly not strong enough to fight,” McGinnis said.</p>
<p>Large’s agent told the Press Association news agency that his family were only able to contact the comedian over the phone because of social distancing rules in the UK. “His family were very sad not to be able to be in the same room as him, touching him, in the last week because of coronavirus,” the agent said.</p>
<p>Large and is comedy partner Syd Little hosted hit shows on British television in the 1970s and 80s, making their name with ITV’s The Little And Large Tellyshow and later The Little And Large Show on the BBC. They would regularly attract audiences of up to 15M, according to the BBC. Large’s later work included appearing on ITV sketch show The Impressionable Jon Culshaw.</p>
<p>Little told the BBC that he was “devastated” by his partner’s death. “It wasn’t like having a partner. We were friends,” he said. Others have also paid tribute to Large, including top British TV presenters Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, who tweeted: “So sad to hear about the passing of Eddie Large. We had the pleasure of working with him and Sid a few years ago. He just loved making people laugh. He will be missed. Our thoughts are with his family at this time.”
