<p>Over the past month, the teleconference software Zoom has seen explosive growth because of, you know, the thing. But that growth has also come with increased scrutiny and a slew of uncovered security screwups. Taken individually, many of the problems seem more sloppy than malicious or sneaky, but taken in aggregate, they make a billion-dollar publicly traded company seem like it’s held together with duct tape and string.</p>
<p>A Sketchy Installer</p>
<p>There was the problem with Zoom’s installer, which took over admin privileges to gain root access to a user’s computer. That access could be abused to surreptitiously install programs without the user’s knowledge, including the ability to access a user’s webcam and microphone. (Last summer, a security researcher found a Zoom feature that opened up vulnerabilities by turning any user’s computer into a local server. In an unprecedented move, Apple silently pushed out an operating-system update to disable it.)</p>
<p>If the App is already installed but the current user is not admin, they ￼use a helper tool called “zoomAutenticationTool” and the AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges API to spawn a password prompt identifying as “System” (!!) to gain root (including a typo). pic.twitter.com/gp9DVCoVCm — Felix (@c1truz_) March 30, 2020</p>
<p>Questionable Routing</p>
<p>There are questions about where Zoom is sending the data it collects from your computer. Zoom was found to be sending data to Facebook, even if you weren’t logged in to a Facebook account. Zoom also apologized this month for mistakenly routing traffic through China, where the internet is heavily monitored by the government. Most tech companies operating in China have strict separations between domestic and international online traffic.</p>
<p>Dubious encryption</p>
<p>That monitoring would be less of a concern if Zoom were encrypted end-to-end, as the company claimed in marketing materials. But it admitted to The Intercept that Zoom did not use E2EE for video calls. Zoom uses some encryption (known as transport encryption) but not the more secure end-to-end type. Some of the confusion stems from defining what an “end” is. Zoom seems to think that its servers, acting as middlemen between users, count as such.</p>
<p>Zoombombing</p>
<p>There’s also the rash of “Zoombombing” that has gone on. People are guessing or finding Zoom meeting ID numbers online and entering uninvited to leave disruptive comments or share disruptive media using Zoom’s screen-share feature. Finding open meetings, which have IDs from nine to 11 digits, is relatively simple and has already been automated. Until a patch issued this week, the meeting ID would often be highly visible in screenshots.</p>
<p>Zoom says it has patched out many of the security flaws. The company has also turned on common-sense features, such as password-protecting meetings by default, to prevent Zoombombing. CEO Eric Yuan also published an apologetic blog post at the beginning of April, announcing a 90-day feature freeze, shifting all development resources toward bolstering security.</p>
<p>“[W]e did not design the product with the foresight that, in a matter of weeks, every person in the world would suddenly be working, studying, and socializing from home,” Yuan wrote. “We now have a much broader set of users who are utilizing our product in a myriad of unexpected ways, presenting us with challenges we did not anticipate when the platform was conceived.”</p>
<p>Those fixes haven’t stopped clients from growing wary and looking for other options. The New York Department of Education has recommended that its schools find a new teleconference software to conduct classes with. Taiwan has banned the software from use in government over fears of Chinese spying. Google has also prohibited the software from its employees’ work-issued devices, stating that the app “does not meet our security standards.”</p>
<p>The question for you, a normal person with normal problems, is: “Should I care about any of this?” Personally, I think you should care about it, but I’m less sure you need to worry. The documented security flaws of Zoom would require a high level of targeting and precision to fully exploit. This isn’t the sort of lax security that could lead to catastrophic widespread data leakage; it’s the sort of lax security that leaves high-value individual targets vulnerable.</p>
<p>Amid the fallout from Zoom’s many security stumbles, Yuan contacted Facebook’s former head of information security Alex Stamos for advice. In a blog post announcing that he was consulting with Zoom, Stamos reiterated a core idea to keep in mind when thinking about security issues: “Coding flaws and cryptographic issues are important, but the vast majority of real technological harm to individuals comes from people using products in a technically correct but harmful manner.” Zoombombing, for instance, is not a result of hacking and subterfuge; it’s a result of sloppiness enabled by Zoom and by users through poor software design.</p>
<p>The question for you surrounding Zoom then becomes, “Am I really that important?” If you work for a government entity or a multinational corporation, or you handle sensitive information like medical or financial data, maybe take a look at some of Zoom’s competitors. Google and Microsoft would certainly not mind more enterprise customers. But if you’re using Zoom’s most recently updated software and you have basic privacy features enabled, such as password-protecting your meetings, you can probably rest easy.

<h3 id="google-microsoft-talk-up-security-after-zoom-firestorm">Google, Microsoft talk up security after Zoom firestorm</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/02/skull_and_crossbones_emerge_from_digital_cubes_malicious_code_hacking_security_threat_by_gonin_gettyimages-1159346361_2400x1600-100833428-large.3x2.jpg" alt="img">
As video conferencing platform Zoom continues to weather unfavorable headlines about its security, two big market rivals are doubling down on commitments to keeps users safe.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Zoom has faced a barrage of criticism involving privacy and security failings, culminating in CEO Eric Yuan acknowledging this week that the company “moved too fast” but is now committed to being “open and honest with [customers] about areas where we are strengthening our platform.” He also announced that Zoom had stopped development of new product features for 90 days to focus on security.</p>
<p>While rival video conferencing platforms haven’t faced the same level of criticism, both Microsoft and Google pointedly outlined what their respective Teams and Hangouts Meet offerings are doing to ensure meetings remain secure.</p>
<p>In a recent blog post, Jared Spataro, corporate vice president for Microsoft 365, stressed all of the security features Microsoft already offers Team users, including how it encrypts data and handles enforcement requests – two areas where Zoom has come under fire. Spataro also noted that Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t use Teams data to serve ads or track participants&rsquo; attention in meetings, something else Zoom has been criticized for.</p>
<p>“Now more than ever, people need to know that their virtual conversations are private and secure,” Spataro wrote in an April 6 post. &ldquo;At Microsoft, privacy and security are never an afterthought. It’s our commitment to you—not only during this challenging time, but always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Google took a similar approach, publishing its own blog post on April 7, summerizing how Google Meet ensures meetings are secure. In the post, Karthik Lakshminarayanan, director of product management for G Suite security and controls, and Smita Hashim, director of product management for Google Meet, Voice &amp; Calendar, talked up Google’s efforts to combat abuse, block hijacking attempts, limit the need for frequent security patches and the platform’s “secure-by-design infrastructure.”</p>
<p>Though Zoom was not called out by name, the beleaguered platform has been criticized for problems in all of those areas in recent weeks.</p>
<p>“I think the moves of Microsoft and Google are partly defensive to reassure their existing users (both enterprise and personal), but also part offensive – trying to use the controversy over Zoom to take market share from them,” said Paul McKay, senior analyst at Forrester.</p>
<p>“Zoom has been caught out in this regard because they have made claims in the past about their security which have later proven to be demonstrably incorrect,” he added. “This has eroded a lot of trust in Zoom specifically, but I think their error here is not practicing good product security as part of development and making marketing claims which were not technically correct.</p>
<p>“They now have the next 90 days to prove if they meant what they said when their CEO responded to the issues last month,” McKay said.</p>
<p>Jarad Carleton, global program leader in cybersecurity at Frost &amp; Sullivan, argued that many of Zoom’s problems stem from the “move fast and break things” culture it adopted early on. That mentality was easier to overlook because of the easy, intuitive and highly reliable nature of the platform.</p>
<p>But companies like Zoom that were not set up with a strong organizational security culture can later find themselves in a retroactive scramble to fix issues that should be dealt with from the outset.</p>
<p>Carleton thinks the recent attention on Zoom’s shortcomings will benefit users in the long run, forcing other video conferencing platforms to review their own security measures to avoid similar criticism. He also said that publicly announcing security audits could help show users that collaboration vendors take security and privacy seriously.</p>
<p>“Solutions such as Microsoft Teams, WebEx, Zoom and others are business tools, first and foremost,” Carleton said. “Any public criticism about security issues can impact subscription revenue, so the enhanced focus on security now as more people use them will only serve to enhance trust over the medium and long-term.”</p>
<p>While Zoom’s security flaws may have given a black eye to a platform that is now pulling in more than 200 million daily users, McKay believes other platforms have quickly re-doubled their security commitments because “Zoom-bombing” and session hijacking could be a danger to them, too.</p>
<p>“I think the impact of this is that it has forced all market participants to pay attention, not just those impacted,” McKay said. “If the industry doesn’t respond positively, then I think it could erode user trust as enterprises have now become fully reliant on these solutions to allow any modicum of productivity to be maintained in the current pandemic.”

<h3 id="zoom-could-be-the-next-great-video-chat-app-but-rampant-security-concerns-have-left-room-for-microsoft-to-swoop-in">Zoom could be the next great video chat app, but rampant security concerns have left room for Microsoft to swoop in</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.insider.com/5e8cb4deb3b0925a1d6400e7?width=1200&amp;format=jpeg" alt="img">
Video conferencing app Zoom has exploded in popularity over the past month as people have been looking for ways to stay in touch virtually while social distancing.</p>
<p>But a number of security issues have come to light in recent weeks, including a new form of harassment known as &ldquo;Zoom-bombing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This recently caused the NYC Department of Education to shift away from Zoom as a tool for distance learning. The government of Taiwan also banned Zoom in official settings.</p>
<p>Zoom faces a number of competitors in the market, but some analysts think Microsoft is in a strong position to win over customers that may be turning away from Zoom.</p>
<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s Teams chat software, which also supports video calls, has a strong advantage thanks to its deep ties to the company&rsquo;s Office 365 software.</p>
<p>Visit Business Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>Video-conferencing app Zoom has surged in popularity over the last month as about 90% of Americans are under orders to stay home — meaning people are increasingly turning to virtual tools to hold work meetings, attend classes, and socialize.</p>
<p>But with that newfound popularity has come a deluge of concerns surrounding the quality of Zoom&rsquo;s privacy and security measures. Hackers have infiltrated private meetings and classrooms in &ldquo;Zoom-bombing&rdquo; attacks; data was apparently sent to Facebook and routed through China; and reports surfaced that the app potentially exposed user email addresses to strangers and didn&rsquo;t encrypt messages end-to-end.</p>
<p>The company was dealt another blow this past week when the New York City Department of Education banned Zoom usage for remote learning and instead instructed teachers to use alternatives like Microsoft&rsquo;s Teams software. Zoom shares were down as much as 9% on Monday after surging to an all-time high in March.</p>
<p>These moments are crucial for the ascendant company, and as pressures have mounted, the company&rsquo;s slow response may be leaving the door wide open for other services like Teams to swoop in and pick up Zoom&rsquo;s pieces.</p>
<p>Zoom has many competitors: Microsoft Teams, Google&rsquo;s Meet and Hangouts, and Cisco Webex are among the biggest, but RingCentral, a smaller cloud-based messaging firm, also launched its own video conferencing alternative just last week.</p>
<p>Still, some analysts think Microsoft is in a strong position to serve as an alternative to Zoom should other companies and organizations take steps similar to the New York City Department of Education&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got a good solution with Microsoft Teams,&rdquo; Alex Zukin, a senior research analyst covering enterprise software for RBC Capital Markets, said to Business Insider. &ldquo;So I think that&rsquo;s the one vendor that&rsquo;s going to have the largest amount of benefit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Zukin said he doesn&rsquo;t believe the recent security concerns will steer consumers and clients away from Zoom. Similarly, he doesn&rsquo;t see the recent incidents as having a meaningful impact on Zoom&rsquo;s business. The company has also worked to increase security and allay concerns, working with Facebook&rsquo;s former security chief and a team of other consultants.</p>
<p>If companies and organizations were to leave Zoom, however, the existing giants are likely to benefit. Microsoft Teams, in particular, has deep integration with Microsoft&rsquo;s widely used Office 365 software, which might play to its advantage for remote learning and work communications.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Microsoft&rsquo;s perception is secure, broad, and you&rsquo;re already using them in other places,&rdquo; Zukin said. &ldquo;So why not add [Teams]?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That lines up with recent thoughts from a group of Credit Suisse analysts led by Brad Zelnick, which wrote in a note on Monday that Microsoft Teams could be Zoom&rsquo;s biggest threat in the long-term.</p>
<p>Other than Teams&rsquo; easy connection to Microsoft&rsquo;s existing productivity software, Microsoft&rsquo;s size plays to its advantage since it has the resources to reach customers at scale, according to Mark Bowker, a senior analyst for research firm Enterprise Strategy Group.</p>
<p>When Zoom CEO Eric Yuan addressed the various security concerns that have emerged on his platform in recent weeks, he noted that Zoom was originally built to serve enterprise customers and businesses with IT departments. Zoom wasn&rsquo;t expecting it would suddenly be used to host weddings or an entire school district&rsquo;s classes, and it wasn&rsquo;t prepared to handle the massive uptick in consumers and new use cases that have surfaced, he said.</p>
<p>Tech&rsquo;s old guard might be better suited to weather this storm, according to Bowker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Microsoft and Google also have the backbone of infrastructure, credibility, and business scale to meet the current needs of the world,&rdquo; Bowker said via email.</p>
<p>Zoom has become the teleconferencing app of choice during the coronavirus pandemic, in which nonessential businesses have closed in cities across the United States, forcing many to work from home. In March, Zoom hosted 200 million daily participants, shattering the record it held as of December 2019 of 10 million daily participants. The company has also been working with 90,000 schools across 20 countries as classrooms remain closed in areas impacted by the pandemic.</p>
<p>But that popularity hasn&rsquo;t come without controversy and scrutiny. Over the past month, Zoom has been faced with a wave of security and privacy concerns.</p>
<p>Among the most notable is a recent practice known as Zoom-bombing, where intruders infiltrate a virtual Zoom conference and spam it with offensive content. The Boston bureau of the Federal Bureau of Investigations said it received reports of two such incidents occurring in virtual Massachusetts school classrooms hosted over Zoom.</p>
<p>Other security issues have also emerged; the company has been hit with a class-action lawsuit over accusations it shared some analytics data with Facebook without properly alerting users. Zoom also said on April 3 that some callers outside of China were mistakenly routed through systems in the country. Taiwan&rsquo;s government then banned officials from using Zoom.</p>
<p>Zoom has since laid out the efforts it&rsquo;s taking to improve security and privacy throughout its platform, which include enacting a feature freeze so that it can wholly focus on security, conducting a security review with third-party experts, and committing to publishing a transparency report including information about data requests.</p>
<p>Zoom&rsquo;s growth has undoubtedly exploded during the pandemic, but it had been gaining traction before then as well. In September 2019, market research firm Gartner designated Zoom as a market leader in the meeting solutions industry alongside Microsoft and Cisco. Such a move signaled that Gartner viewed Zoom, which is less than a decade old, as on par with the established forces in the industry.</p>
<p>To put that into context, Gartner categorized other rivals like Adobe and Google as challengers rather than leaders, which suggests these companies may offer popular services today but don&rsquo;t have as firm of a grasp on where the market is going as Cisco, Microsoft, and Zoom might.</p>
<p>In addition to well-known incumbents like Microsoft, Cisco, and Google, there are a number of smaller players that may be better-positioned for external collaboration or tighter security, according to Raul Castanon, a senior analyst specializing in workforce collaboration for S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. These include services such as CafeX Communications and LoopUp.</p>
<p>And while Cisco may have an advantage over Microsoft from a technical perspective — it has a longer history in the teleconferencing space — Castanon agrees that Microsoft&rsquo;s integration with other services gives it an important edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re already using, like most people do, their productivity and Office suite, it gives you different advantages because there are synergies between all of these products,&rdquo; Castanon said. &ldquo;So I think they&rsquo;re in a really good position.&rdquo;
