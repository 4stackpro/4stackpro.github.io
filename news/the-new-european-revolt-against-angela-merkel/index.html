The spark that kindled this fire was a proposal from nine E.U. states, led by France, Spain and Italy, to proceed with so-called coronavirus bonds, which would empower the E.U. to respond economically to the crisis. The initiative was instantly opposed above all by northern European states, led by Chancellor Merkel’s Germany and the Netherlands’ Prime Minister Mark Rutte.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>At first glance, this dispute over a bond seems obscure. Yet this is in fact a fight over the future of Europe. The common European bond proposal hits at the core of what Europe’s union is for. It is an act of unity that says that, in this time of crisis, Europe stands not as 27 separate nations but as one — in a union. A common E.U. bond would take the debt that individual European states accrue to fight this crisis and make it a collective European responsibility.</p>
<p>The bond issue has broad implications: Moving ahead with it would entail a sweeping increase in the power of the federal union. Jacob Funk Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute calls it Europe’s “Hamilton Moment,” referring to the young U.S. federal government’s decision in 1790 to assume all the debt incurred by the individual colonies during the War of Independence. This was a crucial step toward the creation of a strong central government in Washington.</p>
<p>The move by those nine countries for a common E.U. bond was in fact a revolt against Europe’s status quo. It was at its core therefore a revolt against Merkel and the past decade of austerity in Europe.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Merkel has been widely lionized, both overseas and at home. A recent profile of her in the Financial Times lauded her approach to the novel coronavirus domestically and explained internationally she has become a “symbol of western liberal values scorned by nationalists such as U.S. president Donald Trump.”</p>
<p>But many Europeans see her differently. Merkel is also the architect of a decade of devastating austerity that has caused economic devastation and deprivation throughout much of the continent. This has helped to fuel the rise of right-wing populist movements.</p>
<p>After the 2008 economic crisis, Merkel, as the head of Europe’s leading economy, was calling the shots. The crisis revealed that Europe’s new currency (the euro) had a design flaw. While the E.U. had a common monetary policy with its own central bank, it lacked a common fiscal policy. The E.U. thus couldn’t enact the sort of bold fiscal stimulus measures seen in the United States and China. Merkel could have pushed for that. Instead she demanded austerity.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>When the Greek economy collapsed, teetering on the brink of default in 2009, Merkel lectured southern European countries about profligacy. She turned what was a manageable crisis into a systemic shock to Europe’s economies. Unable to enact domestic stimulus measures since the euro mandated deficits stay below 3 percent of GDP, the only path forward was crushing austerity. Greece experienced an economic depression. Spain saw unemployment rise to 25 percent, and Italy saw its debt burden grow to unsustainable levels. This is why economist after economist have railed against the adoption of the euro.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, as the calamity of austerity became clear and as populist parties and movements plagued the E.U., European political leaders sought reform, pushing to strengthen the E.U.’s ability to stimulate growth. Emmanuel Macron’s election in France in 2017 looked like a turning point. He had offered proposal after proposal. Merkel, however, refused them all.</p>
<p>As the coronavirus crisis hit, it looked like the E.U. had learned some lessons. The E.U. suspended its rigid deficits rules. The European Central Bank, despite a brief initial misstep, quickly announced a massive relief package (in sharp contrast to its hesitation in 2008).</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Yet on the larger question of whether Europe should assume common responsibility for debts incurred in the crisis, Merkel has stuck to her guns — it’s a nein.</p>
<p>To be fair, Germany is not the only obstacle. Other conservative governments like the Netherlands are standing behind her. But Merkel carries their weight. If she moved, Europe would move. Merkel has the power to unite Europe, set it on the path for an economic revival. Yet she refuses.</p>
<p>Few European leaders in history have had the power to move Europe and done so little. The question now is whether Europe’s union can survive such obstinacy.</p>

<h3 id="parallel-lives-of-queen-elizabeth-and-angela-merkel">Parallel lives of Queen Elizabeth and Angela Merkel</h3>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/QueenE-Merkel.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, last week described the coronavirus pandemic as the greatest world crisis since the Second World War. Only one head of state can make that comparison as a matter of life experience. In an address to Britain and the Commonwealth on April 5, Queen Elizabeth reminded her listeners that she made her first broadcast in 1940, as a 14-year-old princess, when Britain stood alone against the Nazis.</p>
<p>In the spirit of Plutarch’s parallel lives, one might contrast the British sovereign to another maternal figure at the head of an important country, namely Germany’s Angela Merkel. No two women could be more different; Dr. Merkel is a highly qualified biophysicist and a no-nonsense practical leader. But the women from countries that fought each other in two world wars during the past century have played parallel roles in uniting their countries.</p>
<p>Now 94, the Queen gently exhorted the British people to act in a way that they could look back on with pride. In a global atmosphere charged by fear and recriminations, her message stood out as an example of leadership. News that Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson had been taken to hospital after showing symptoms of the coronavirus came out after the Queen’s address.</p>
<p>Today’s speech, filmed in solitude, orchestrated by one cameraman wearing protective equipment at Windsor Castle, stands in stark contrast of the Monarchy, often surrounded by family, pageantry or in front of representatives from all areas of public interest.</p>
<p>She said:</p>
<p>“Together we are tackling this disease, and I want to reassure you that if we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it. I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge, and those who come after us will say the Britons of this generation were as strong as any, that the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet, good-humored resolve, and of fellow feeling still characterize this country. The pride in who we are is not a part of our past, it defines our present and our future.”</p>
<p>Her comparison of the present crisis to what then Prime Minister Winston Churchill called Britain’s finest hour was a quiet summons to courage. It carried more weight coming from a woman who as a child already was a national symbol, but spoke to the children of today with the affection of a national matriarch.</p>
<p>Britain’s thousand-year-old monarchy embodies the continuity of its national character, but Elizabeth is far more than a figurehead. Her long life embodied the challenges her people have had to face, from her wartime evacuation with her sister, the early death of her beloved father George VI, her youth responsibilities as monarch, the tragic death of her daughter-in-law Diana and her responsibility for her young grandsons, to the many small and large crises which the Royal Family has had to face. Not only her status but a deep empathy for the difficulties of her people made her message of national unity so evocative.</p>
<p>With Prince Charles, the Queen’s firstborn son and future heir, in coronavirus recovery and Prime Minister Boris Johnson, since fighting to restore his health in a UK hospital unit, it was a deeply personal message that will hold people together, throughout the world, through difficult days ahead.</p>
<p>She concluded her address with a message for the children of Britain, who are “making sacrifices and painting rainbows.” Coming from a child of wartime, her words to today’s children offered hope that Britain will emerge from the crisis “as strong as any before.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth appealed to Britons’ better natures, in marked contrast to the political partisanship that surrounds public health policy in the United States. The major media is overwhelmingly hostile to President Trump, who in turn has sought to cast blame on state governors who have criticized him. Meanwhile, the federal and state governments are engaged in a lifeboat brawl over an inadequate provision of critical supplies and equipment.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the political leader whose standing in the present crisis most resembles that of the Queen is Germany’s Angela Merkel, now in her sixteenth year as Federal Chancellor. Nicknamed “Mutti” (or “Mommy”), Merkel took a very different tone with the German public, warning bluntly that more than half of Germans might contract the virus. Building on an excellent public health system with an ample hospital space and equipment, Merkel’s medical team has kept the fatality rate from coronavirus to the lowest in the world.</p>
<p>Largely in response to her handling of the medical emergency, voters’ support for Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union has risen to the highest level in three years, with 43% of voters saying that they believe the Union is best qualified to deal with Germany’s problems. Only months ago the Union’s popularity had sunk briefly below that of the Green Party; now Merkel’s party is far ahead, with pollsters reporting that the Green’s support has shrunk to a narrow base of college students.</p>
<p>The Queen established the tone of her reign at her Coronation Oath in 1953, “The things which I have here before promised, I will perform and keep. So help me God.” As head of the Church of England, the Queen re-establishes the British Monarchy, not as pageantry or celebrity, but as a legacy of service and the Monarch’s sanctimonious contract with the people, humanity and God.</p>
<p>Dr. Merkel has no such tradition to draw upon. German nationalism became a dodgy business during the Second World War, and Merkel has ruled out any cooperation with Germany’s avowedly nationalist minority party, the Alternative fūr Deutschland. Instead of appealing to historical memory, Merkel offered a robust public health system, a brilliant team of German doctors, and a dogged commitment to finding whatever means were necessary to save lives.</p>
<p>Thanks to Elizabeth and Angela Merkel, the wartime enemies of the 20th century have become models of national unity under stress, albeit in very different ways. And in a fractured and contentious world that is an encouraging sign.

<h3 id="angela-merkel-returns-to-office-after-coronavirus-quarantine">Angela Merkel returns to office after coronavirus quarantine</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.dw.com/image/52983741_304.jpg" alt="img">
German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday returned to her Berlin office after two weeks in home quarantine.</p>
<p>Merkel will continue to observe social distancing rules and lead the country via video and audio conferencing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thankfully the chancellor tested negative for the coronavirus several times &hellip; Now the work continues from the chancellery,&rdquo; said government spokesman Steffen Seibert.</p>
<p>The 65-year-old leader had been in self-isolation at her flat in the German capital&rsquo;s museum district after learning on March 22 that a doctor who gave her a vaccination two days before was infected with the COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>While in isolation, Merkel kept working and held government meetings via video link.</p>
<p>The chancellor&rsquo;s popularity has soared during the coronavirus crisis, with a survey showing that the vast majority of Germans agreed with the introduction of social distancing rules.</p>
