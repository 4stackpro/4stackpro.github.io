(CNN) California Gov. Gavin Newsom outlined a framework for reopening the economy in the Golden State Tuesday, warning in a gentle rebuke to President Donald Trump that the state&rsquo;s coronavirus protocols would be guided by &ldquo;science and public health, not politics&rdquo; and telling residents that they will enter a radically different environment in their daily interactions.</p>
<p>The Democrat did not give a date that the current state-at-home order would end. It currently extends through May 3 statewide, and longer in places like Los Angeles, which has a stay-at-home in effect until May 15. Instead local governments, he said, would be determinative, but he declined to respond to Trump&rsquo;s assertion that the President alone has total authority to decide when the country will reopen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no light switch here, it&rsquo;s more like a dimmer,&rdquo; Newsom said. &ldquo;I know you want the timeline, but we can&rsquo;t get ahead of ourselves and dream of regretting. Let&rsquo;s not make the mistake of pulling the plug too early, as much as we want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to make a political decision that puts people&rsquo;s lives at risk and puts the economy at even more risk by extending the period of time before we can ultimately transition and get people moving again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said the state would use real time data, science and examples on a daily basis as the loosening of orders go forward &ldquo;to toggle that dimmer, so we get exactly the appropriate lighting, so that we can ultimately transition to herd immunity and that vaccine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Newsom told reporters to check back with him in two weeks, when he may be able to outline exact dates if California sees a flattening, and then decline, of coronavirus hospitalization rates, as well as a reduction in the number of people in intensive care unit beds. A third major factor determining the date, he said, would be building a workforce of health care workers who can trace coronavirus infections in order to isolate the infected.</p>
<p>He warned that Californians should prepare to enter a radically different realm where residents continue to wear masks, and where they may be greeted at restaurants by waiters wearing masks and gloves with disposable menus in venues that have half as many tables. Local school officials would develop new protocols, he said, for physical education classes and recess at schools, as well as processes to deeply clean and sanitize schools, parks and playgrounds to keep infection rates down.</p>
<p>Outlining a framework for reopening the economy, the California governor said the dates would be determined by the ability to do six things: expand testing to identify and isolate patients, maintain vigilance to protect seniors and high risk people, be able to meet future surges in hospitals with a &ldquo;myriad of protective gear,&rdquo; continue to collaborate with academia on therapies and treatments, redraw regulations to ensure continued physical distancing at private businesses and schools and develop new enforcement mechanisms to allow the state to pull back and reinstate stay-at-home orders.</p>
<p>Newsom said it was an optimistic new phase where the state will move from its surge response, transitioning &ldquo;into suppression, ultimately on our way to herd immunity, and ultimately to a vaccine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not out of the woods yet, we are not spiking the ball,&rdquo; Newsom said. &ldquo;But we also extend a recognition in that light that this can&rsquo;t be a permanent state, and I want you to know, it&rsquo;s not &ndash; it will not be a permanent state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added that there&rsquo;s no expectation that large gatherings will be able to take place in the state as of yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prospect of mass gatherings is negligible at best until we get to herd immunity, and we get to a vaccine. So large-scale events that bring in hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of strangers all together across every conceivable difference, health and otherwise, is not in the cards based upon our current guidelines and current expectations,&rdquo; Newsom said.</p>

<p>A similar group is in the works on the East Coast. Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said his state, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Rhode Island and Massachusetts each plan to name a public health and economic official to a regional working group. The chief of staff of the governor of each state also will be a part of the group, which will begin work immediately to design a reopening plan.</p>
<p>Trump on Tuesday backed off his rhetoric from the day before, when he claimed his &ldquo;authority is total&rdquo; to reopen the states&rsquo; economies.</p>
<p>The President claimed he would be &ldquo;authorizing each individual governor of each individual state to implement a reopening and a very powerful reopening plan of their state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same time, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, was dismissing calls for a stay-at-home order in his state, which now has the mostcoronavirus cases in the nation.</p>
<p>Between March 12 and April 7, Newsom has estimated that about 2.3 million Californians filed for unemployment benefits putting an enormous strain on the state&rsquo;s budget, which had a $21.5 billion surplus earlier this year before the virus. Nationally, unemployment claims have surpassed 17 million.</p>
<p>California&rsquo;s system has been swamped with claims amid reports from applicants of website crashes and hours-long waits for assistance from the state&rsquo;s Economic Development Department, leading Newsom to extend the department&rsquo;s hours and dedicate more staff to the handling of claims.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles County alone, nearly half of Angelenos said they had either been laid off or had their hours reduced, according to a survey released Saturday by the Thomas and Dorothy Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount University.</p>

<p>But California&rsquo;s physical distancing measures have been a success and hailed by public health officials nationally. At least 724 people had died in California as of Monday, but the state&rsquo;s peak day in terms of coronavirus fatalities came on April 8, when 66 people died. Numbers have been slightly lower each day since then: 48 coronavirus-related deaths were reported on Monday.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said it may be possible to relax the county&rsquo;s stay-at-home orders in mid-May, which impact 10 million people. But she said lifting the order, which she extended until May 15 in concert with other local officials, will hinge on the ability to care for those who are sick, to make sure the most vulnerable and those in nursing homes are protected from the virus and to &ldquo;test, test, test, which has been a challenge,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>One of the models that Ferrer unveiled this week showed that the county could have a 95% infection rate if officials were to lift the order now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do know that the physical distancing requirements are working,&rdquo; Ferrer told CNN&rsquo;s Jim Scuitto on &ldquo;CNN&rsquo;s Newsroom&rdquo; Tuesday morning. &ldquo;We do a fairly aggressive job at isolating and quarantining people who have been exposed and can expose others. &hellip; In order for us to safely reopen, we have to understand it&rsquo;s going to take us some time. Because we cannot reopen, go back to where we were, and then see the huge spike that, of course, will overwhelm anybody&rsquo;s health care system.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It may seem that the coronavirus crisis has been with us forever, but it’s been less than a month since California’s officialdom began imposing a quasi-quarantine to reduce the toll on human life.</p>
<p>Support Times of San Diego&rsquo;s growth</p>
<p>with a small monthly contribution Become a supporter</p>
<p>It’s also been a few weeks since the Legislature recessed indefinitely and entrusted Gov. Gavin Newsom to do whatever he deemed necessary to protect the state’s 40 million residents.</p>
<p>So how has Newsom performed? After a couple of early miscues, he’s done extremely well, demonstrating a deft touch in persuading Californians to avoid personal contacts, even though it rapidly plunged the state into a deep economic recession.</p>
<p>Newson has, to use one of his favorite phrases, “met the moment” and it appears that Californians’ changes in personal behavior are, to use another Newsomism, “bending the curve” enough to sharply reduce the toll and avoid the terrible fate that’s befallen New York and other states.</p>
<p>Newsom has coupled defense with offense, tapping the state’s budget reserves to aggressively fund protective shelter for the homeless, expand hospital capacity and acquire more sorely needed medical equipment — most recently an initiative to buy many millions of protective face masks.</p>
<p>“We decided enough is enough,” Newsom declared as he announced the latter. “Let’s use the power of the purchasing power of the state of California as a nation-state … and in the next few weeks, we’re going to see supplies at that level into the state of California — and potentially the opportunity to export some of those supplies to states in need.”</p>
<p>“Nation-state” is another of the Newsomisms to emerge, a constant reminder — even an implicit boast — that California is big enough to act where the federal government has failed.</p>
<p>Newsom has always sought the spotlight, trumpeting “big hairy, audacious goals” such as unilaterally implementing same-sex marriages as mayor of San Francisco and promising as governor to build 3.5 million new houses.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic is an opportunity to act decisively on the biggest goal of all, saving thousands of lives, and Newsom has risen to the occasion with a tempered maturity, even throttling his penchant for attacking President Donald Trump to maintain a working relationship with the White House.</p>
<p>That said, it’s still been less than a month, California still has not seen the pandemic’s peak and even when its medical threat has receded, we will face the economic consequences for many months, even years. As tax revenues plummet and reserves melt away, the “big hairy, audacious goals” that Newsom had been seeking will take a back seat to crisis management.</p>
<p>From a purely political career standpoint, that’s not all bad, even though Newsom, of course, professes no political motivation. “This is not political, this is not in any way, shape or form usurping or undermining,” he said of his medical mask initiative. “This is all in the spirit of all of us stepping into this moment and doing what we can.”</p>
<p>However, Newsom didn’t reveal the action during one of his daily webcast briefings, but rather during a nationwide appearance on MSNBC’s “Rachel Maddow Show,” whose audience is overwhelmingly left-of-center Democrats. And he also garnered national media attention when he dispatched 500 ventilators to other hard-stricken states, such as New York.</p>
<p>Newsom’s Maddow appearance, coming one day before Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of presidential contention, had an immediate political effect as a #PresidentNewsom hashtag began trending on Twitter.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt Newsom harbors presidential ambitions. As well as he’s performed to date, however, he faces years of crisis that will decisively fix his place in California political history and thus determine how far he can go.</p>

To the editor: Of course the president does not have the power to reopen the economy amid the COVID-19 pandemic. However, he does have the ability to influence those state governors who long ago surrendered their independence to the president.</p>
<p>If any governors agree to put their citizens at risk by relaxing social distancing rules and opening businesses no matter how limited, then I have a right to expect that my governor, Gavin Newsom, continue his commitment to my health.</p>
<p>I cannot return from Las Vegas without going through a checkpoint inquiring whether I am bringing any fruit or vegetables into California. I cannot board a plane without federal security personnel examining my luggage and my person for any weapons or other threatening items.</p>
<p>Surely, you cannot expect to be allowed to enter California if you live in a state that has increased the likelihood that you are carrying a weapon far more dangerous than produce. I hope Newsom acts swiftly to address this new threat from outside our state.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Fred W. Burkardt, Rancho Cucamonga</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>To the editor: Here’s a bipartisan proposal for restarting the economy after COVID-19: a massive Works Progress Administration-style program for improving the nation’s infrastructure.</p>
<p>Choosing to fund needed repairs to things like roads and bridges rather than new projects might limit arguments over spending. Fewer vehicles on the road would make such repairs quicker and cheaper too.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Early release of healthy construction workers from stay-home orders would do minimum harm. They frequently wear masks, hardhats and coveralls anyway. Parts assembly would also become essential jobs.</p>
<p>Reintroducing capital into the economy in this useful and powerful way might make it possible for the rest of us to return to the task of rebuilding what has been damaged by this pandemic when it’s all over.</p>
<p>Victor Dorff, Agoura Hills</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>To the editor: There are risks in easing stay-home restrictions. There are also risks in 15% unemployment, millions unable to pay their rent or mortgage, shuttering entire industries and letting a whole generation of students fall behind because of school closures.</p>
<p>We seniors older than 70 who are most at risk in this pandemic can still recognize that risks should be weighed objectively and shared equitably.</p>
