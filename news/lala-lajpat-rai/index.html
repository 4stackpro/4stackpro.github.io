<p>印度北方邦密拉特 Lala Lajpat Rai 紀念醫學院近日發生與疫情相關的離奇攻擊事件，一些猴子在校園內襲擊了一名實驗室技術人員，並帶走 3 位武漢肺炎確診患者的血液樣本。</p>
<p>由於實驗室人員在遭搶當下隨即以手機拍下事件，目前在許多媒體上都可以看到事件過程。從印度媒體 NDTV 公布的影片來看，猴子在搶走樣本和外科手套在內的其他醫療物品後，便爬上附近的一棵樹逃跑。</p>
<p>目前印度已有近 19 萬人確診，約 5,400 人因病死亡，考量到國際間已傳出一些動物被人類傳染武漢肺炎的案例，加上候選疫苗也是在出現症狀的恒河猴身上測試，當地居民擔心，此事件可能會增加武漢肺炎傳播的風險，病毒或許會在猴群中傳播，接著再度傳回人類。</p>
<p>密拉特當局在 5/29 發表了關於盜竊案的第一起正式聲明。Lala Lajpat Rai 紀念醫學院校長 SK Garg 在聲明中強調，猴子搶走的是常規治療期間從確診患者身上採集的血液，而不是被感染患者的喉嚨或舌頭拭子採檢樣本，目前已知病毒主要是透過飛沫和氣溶膠傳染，還沒有任何動物可能透過與確診者血液接觸而感染冠狀病毒的證據。</p>
<p>官方目前正在對猴子事件進行調查。醫學院有關部門已要求技術人員解釋是如何被猴子壓制，又為何是選擇「拍攝」而非立即通知官員來對偷盜做出回應。</p>

<p>近年來，印度猴滿為患，猴群從人類手中搶奪物品、襲擊兒童等事件時有所聞。印度官方甚至發布過一份《如何避免猴子攻擊》指南。而近期更發生了一起嚴重的猴群攻擊事件：一名醫學院的實驗人員被猴子搶走了手中的病人血液樣本，引發當地居民恐慌，擔心新冠肺炎病毒可能因此被猴子帶入人群。</p>
<p>★【東森財經粉絲團】財經資訊一把抓</p>
<p>綜合外媒報導，印度北方邦密拉特 Lala Lajpat Rai 紀念醫學院近日發生一起離奇的猴群攻擊事件。一群猴子在校園內襲擊了一名實驗室人員，更嚴重的是，還從他的手中搶走了病人血液樣本。因該醫學院也有收集新冠肺炎患者的血液樣本，印度警方與鄰近居民都十分擔心，猴群是否會把這些未知的血液樣本帶到住宅區，造成病毒傳播。</p>
<p>▼印度發生醫學院內的實驗室人員被猴子搶走病人血液樣本事件。（示意圖／取自pixabay）</p>
<p>該實驗室人員在遭猴群襲擊當下，隨即以手機拍下過程，許多媒體上都可看到這支影片。從影谝中可看出，猴群得手後隨即逃跑，其中一隻猴子還爬到樹上，開始撕咬裝著病人血液的試管。該醫學院的校長SK Garg隨後對此發出一份聲明，強調被猴子搶走的是病人血液，而非患者的舌頭拭子採檢樣本。目前還沒有任何動物會因接觸確診者的血液而感染新冠肺炎的證據，請大眾不必過度恐慌。</p>
<p>不過，校長也承認，被猴群搶走的血液樣本是拿在技術人員手上，而非裝在箱子裡，此舉不符合運送血液樣本的規定。</p>
<p>▼印度許多地區猴滿為患，隨處可見猴子的蹤影。（示意圖／取自pixabay）</p>
<p>有鑑於印度目前的確診人數已超過16萬，死亡人數接近5千。此事也引起了外界的高度關注。目前，印度官方正針對此事進行調查。醫學院有關部門已要求技術人員解釋，當時是如何被猴子搶走樣本，事發當下的第一反應為何事拍攝影片，而非立即通知其他人員前來協助。</p>

The city witnessed the death of the first cop from COVID-19 when 56-year-old sub-inspector Balbeer Singh passed away on Tuesday at the Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College Hospital here.</p>
<p>The deceased sub-inspector was currently posted as in-charge of Fatehullapur Police Chowki of Lisari Gate Police Station. As soon as he tested positive of COVID-19 on Tuesday, the Police Chowki has been closed and the entire police staff posted there is quarantined.</p>
<p>This is the 39th death due to COVID in the district while the total number of positive cases is now 536. So far, a total of 39 COVID positive cases from the police and paramilitary forces have been reported in the district but this, unfortunately, is the first loss of life.</p>
<p>SI Balbeer Singh was admitted to a private hospital here with the symptoms of Corona early morning on Tuesday. He had a high fever and respiratory problems due to which his COVID test was done. When he tested positive, he was immediately shifted to the COVID ward of LLRM Medical College here on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>His condition, however, deteriorated considering which the higher officials had even reserved a bed for him at Medanta Hospital. But the doctors did not give permission to shift him from here in view of his critical condition. Later in the night, he lost the battle of his life.</p>
<p>His family members were immediately informed. The family arrived from Moradabad after which the last rites were performed at Suraj Kund Cremation Ground.</p>
<p>IG Meerut Range Praveen Kumar expressed condolences to the bereaved family and also tweeted about the unfortunate death of SI Balbeer Singh. He also assured the family every possible help by the Police department and said that the department stands with them at this time of grief.</p>
<p>Balbeer Singh was a resident of Village Govindpur of Swar area in district Rampur. Currently, he was residing in the K Block of Shastri Nagar locality of Meerut. He was staying here alone as his family lives in Moradabad.

<p>Updated: Jun 11, 2020 22:05 IST</p>
<p>Kanpur’s Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial (GSVM) Medical College principal Dr Arti Lalchandani has been transferred and attached to the directorate general of medical education in Lucknow, almost 10 days after a controversy broke out over her alleged remarks against Tablighi Jamaat members, made in a video clip.</p>
<p>Principal secretary, medical education, Rajneesh Dubey confirmed that Dr Lalchandani had been attached to DG Medical Education office, Lucknow and was replaced at the medical college in Kanpur by new principal Dr RB Kamal. Dr Kamal was an officer on special duty at the medical college prior to his new appointment.</p>
<p>Kanpur district magistrate Brahm Deo Tiwari on Thursday said Dr Lalchandani’s transfer orders were received on Wednesday, according to the news agency PTI. Dr Lalchandani was not available for comment.</p>
<p>After assuming charge, Dr Kamal said to reporters he would try to live up to the expectations.</p>
<p>In these ‘trying times’, his priority would be providing better health care to non-Covid patients at medical college-run hospitals, he added. He also said the responsibility given to him was big and that he would take everyone along.</p>
<p>For Coronavirus Live Updates</p>
<p>Earlier, Dr Lalchandani landed in a controversy after a video clip showed her making objectionable remarks about members of Tablighi Jamaat who were admitted at Kanpur’s Lala Lajpat Rai Hospital in April. LLR Hospital is one of the nine hospitals run by the Kanpur medical college.</p>
<p>In her purported remarks, she had also accused the Yogi Adityanath government of pursuing “appeasement” policy by providing Jamat members free treatment for Covid-19 in government hospitals.</p>

<p>After the video went viral, Lalchandani initially maintained the video was a ‘tampered one’ and leaked as part of a blackmailing effort. She later released a video apologising profusely for “hurting the sentiments of Muslims”, whom she described as her “brothers and sisters”.

<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200529110152-monkeys-india-0223-restricted-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
New Delhi (CNN) A troop of monkeys snatched the blood samples of suspected coronavirus patients at a government hospital in the Meerut district of the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p>The incident happened on Thursday when a lab assistant working with the Covid-19 facility of the hospital was carrying blood samples due for testing, Dr Dheeraj Baliyan, medical superintendent of Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College and Hospital, told CNN.</p>
<p>The monkeys attacked the lab assistant and stole the sample box with three samples, added Baliyan.</p>
<p>S.K. Garg, head of the hospital, told a local newswire that the samples were blood samples, and not the swabs usually taken to test for Covid-19. Garg said that the samples belonged to people who had tested positive for Covid-19, but were taken as part of routine blood tests for the patients.</p>
<p>The monkeys climbed the trees with the samples and threw them after chewing the packets, Baliyan added.</p>

<h3 id="dr-wijewardene-trailblazer-of-the-lankan-publishing-industry">&ldquo;D.R. Wijewardene: Trailblazer of the Lankan publishing industry&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.dailynews.lk/sites/default/files/news/2020/06/12/z_p05-DR-01.jpg" alt="img">
Only a few people have influenced the course of Sri Lanka’s history in the manner that the late D.R. Wijewardene, founder of the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited (ANCL), has done. As we commemorate the 70th death anniversary of this noble son of Sri Lanka today, it is time to reevaluate his yeoman service to the Nation and to journalism.</p>
<p>Wijewardene, founder of the ANCL, will always be known as the doyen of the newspaper industry in Sri Lanka. Born on February 23, 1886, Don Richard Wijewardene was the third son of a family of nine. He received his early education at S. Thomas’ College, Mount Lavinia and later entered the Cambridge University in England, where he met some leaders of the Independence Movement of India and also witnessed the power of media in moulding public opinion.</p>
<p>Wijewardene had the rare opportunity of meeting with the future leaders of India like Lala Lajpat Rai, Bepin Chandra Pal, Surendranath Banerji and a leading light of India Gopal Krishna Gokhale, a member of the Imperial Legislative Council.</p>
<p>Of these meetings during his student days, he writes: &ldquo;My interest in politics began during my undergraduate days at Cambridge. There were kindred spirits from India, Ceylon and other parts of the East&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Impressed by the thoughts, words and deeds of the contemporary Indian visitors to Cambridge that every educated young Indian or Lankan had a historic role to play in the public life of his respective country, Wijewardene was fired with the deep commitment to make the monumental sacrifice he was destined to do on his return home after studies.</p>
<p>Before his return home as a Cambridge graduate and being called to the Bar at the Inner Temple London, some like-minded Lankans had begun their crusade against the British Raj and were fearlessly taking their agitation and propaganda campaign to the enemy&rsquo;s camp - the British Parliament where all types of obnoxious pieces of one sided legislations were passed depriving innocent, unarmed but decent and civilised Asians and Africans of their basic freedoms and human rights.</p>
<p>Wijewardene was in touch with local events and organised the first deputation to the Secretary of State for the colonies with Mr. H. J. C. Pereira. Among the others of the group was Mr. E. W. Perera of the Lion flag fame.</p>
<p>At the time, Wijewardene had a good friend, a Sri Lanka born Englishman by the name of F. H. M. Corbet. Corbet was a practising barrister in England. &ldquo;It was in his Chambers that I first met E. W. Perera who was even then a keen politician and displayed many of the qualities which gave him a leading position in the legislature many years later&rdquo;, Wijewardene recalled.</p>
<p>The British who introduced a series of multifarious vices to wean the people - particularly the majority Sinhala Buddhists from their traditional way of disciplined lifestyles, went on opening taverns in every nook and corner for the sale of toddy under the guise of checking illicit liquor.</p>
<p>The purpose of Wijewardene&rsquo;s campaign was to protest against the multiplication of toddy taverns. His action in England paved the way for the birth of the Temperance movement, the Amadyapa Sabha to fight against the British evils. Wijewardene while in England collected old books and paintings; Portuguese and Dutch maps of Lanka.</p>
<p>Unlike many young Lankans who went to England for higher studies, Wijewardene refrained from travelling in the European continent nor inside Great Britain.</p>
<p>Don Richard, the third male child of seven sons and two daughters lost their father Muhandiram Tudugalage Don Philip Wijewardene an industrious timber merchant of Sedavatta when the mother Helena Weerasinghe who &ldquo;was not only fair and favoured with good looks but was practical&rdquo; was barely 38 years of age.</p>
<p>Mrs. Helena Wijewardene bravely shouldered the entire responsibility of bringing up the seven sons and two daughters in accordance with the traditional Sinhala customs and Buddhist discipline.</p>
<p>She imbubed in her children the unique qualities of Sinhala Buddhist culture. With the Kelaniya Raja Maha Viharaya as the nucleus of cultural, religious and spiritual sustenance, Helena Wijewardene provided ample opportunity for her children to lead dignified and disciplined lives and be patriotic to the motherland.</p>
<p>All her sons Don Philip Alexander, Don Lewis, Don Charles, Don Edmund, Don Richard, Don Albert and Don Walter were products of Saint Thomas&rsquo; College which was located, then at Mutuvella in Colombo North.</p>
<p>The two daughters were Mrs. E. W. Jayewardene (mother of President J. R. Jayewardene) and Mrs. Arthur Seneviratne. At the Sedavatta school where D.R. had his primary education &ldquo;efforts were directed towards learning the three &ldquo;R&quot;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At St. Thomas&rsquo;, I merely concentrated on my studies. There were no influences in school life which as far as I can remember, tended to direct one&rsquo;s interest into the broader life of the community. For example Ceylon History was not taught,” Wijewardene recalled in later years.</p>
<p>While in England, he had already decided to start a newspaper to fight for the cause of regaining freedom. By the time, he arrived he was fully equipped mentally with the techniques of the trade - how to survive in a competitive world.</p>
<p>A patriot to his fingertips, Wijewardene found the right opening for his anti-colonial mission by purchasing the Sinhala publication Dinamina started by legendary editor H.S. Perera. The Dinamina had run into financial difficulties by 1914. Wijewardene with his brother, D.C. Wijewardene bought the rights of the Dinamina and transformed it into one of the most dynamic dailies in the country. Overnight, the &ldquo;Dinamina&rdquo; rose up in popularity reaching remote areas of the country. Once, the &ldquo;Dinamina&rdquo; printed in natural colours the Lion flag of Lanka. D. C. Vijayavardhana in his book &ldquo;Revolt in the Temple&rsquo; states:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Dinamina edition created quite a stir in the island. The newspaper office which at that time located in Norris Road (present Olcott Mawatha, Pettah) Colombo, was stormed by crowds clamouring for copies of the paper which by noon was changing hands at five rupees a copy, and telegrams began to pour in from the outstations requesting more copies, but the edition had been exhausted within a few hours of the issue. Vast crowds gathered on the road opposite the newspaper office and police had to be called in to control them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the first occasion when our people saw for the first time the lion flag after it was removed by the British and deposited in the Chelsea hospital in London in 1815.</p>
<p>Wijewardene who learnt that E. W. Perera was responsible for obtaining the Lion flag, ordered a copy drawn exactly in colour and despatched so that he could reproduce the flag in his paper the &ldquo;Dinamina&rdquo;. Although the paper had no front page pictures and sensational stories, people everywhere - including the Bhikku Sangha welcomed it.</p>
<p>In 1918, D.R. bought an English paper, the Ceylonese which had also run into financial distress. He paid Sir Ponnambalam Arunachalam, its founder, Rs.16,000 (then a massive sum) for the paper and the plant and goodwill. Wijewardene revived it and renamed it the Ceylon Daily News.</p>
<p>This newspaper has become such an ingrained part of people’s lives that many old timers and even younger readers still call it the CDN, long after the newspaper shed the ‘Ceylon’ tag. It became one of the most influential voices in the local political scene, shaping opinions and creating debate and it remains so, having already passed its centenary two years ago.</p>
<p>He then purchased the Observer, which was already 90-years- old, having begun publishing in 1834. The Daily Observer folded around 10 years ago but the Sunday Observer, is as vibrant as ever and nearing 100 years. The Sinhala weekly Silumina was started in 1930 and the Thinakaran in Tamil followed a couple of years later. He not only established a newspaper business, he also laid the foundation for a newspaper empire where within a short time, newspapers rolled down daily in three languages - English, Sinhala and Tamil. Wijewardene, with his hand-picked team of erudite editors and journalists who shared his noble vision and mission, was in the forefront of the independence struggle through his array of newspapers. In fact, all of Sri Lanka’s leading journalists have begun their careers here at Lake House.</p>
<p>Wijewardene revolutionized the newspaper industry and journalism in Sri Lanka with his fearless commitment to exposing the truth through ANCL newspapers. As one of his biographers, the one-time Chief Editor of the Daily News H.A.J. Hulugalle wrote, ‘before he was fifty, D. R. Wijewardene had established several flourishing newspapers, built up a great business and influenced the course of the Island’s history. Perseverance, courage and a high sense of public duty were the main elements of his success.’</p>
<p>He was a perfectionist and a trailblazer. He also installed the latest printing technology available at that time and assured a good working environment for his employees. The ANCL continues this tradition, having recently installed some of the latest digital printing machinery.</p>
<p>Wijewardene also understood the power of the visual medium and established a studio called ChitraFoto at Lake House premises where some of Sri Lanka’s foremost photographers honed their skills.</p>
<p>The Lake House edifice, instantly recognized by people across the island, is a proud monument to his lasting legacy. The ANCL was formally established in 1926 and all operations were shifted to the purpose-built ‘Lake House’ building by the banks of the Beira Lake in the heart of Colombo in 1929; hence the name ‘Lake House’. The company, the biggest newspaper publisher in Sri Lanka, still operates from this historic landmark building and the name ‘Lake House’ is now synonymous with ANCL.</p>
<p>Anyone entering the Lake House building would be thoroughly amazed to witness the skillful planning and the deft designing of the entire construction and the interior lay out. The building is constructed in such a way that any type of modern machinery and equipment can be easily installed without major restructuring of the building.</p>
<p>Under any emergency, the entire workforce - can leave their desks and other places of work through the numerous exists found in the outfit.</p>
<p>Walking along the corridors one would be overjoyed to appreciate the different kinds of traditional Sinhala motifs adorning the walls.</p>
<p>The grills on the walls in all the floors are adorned with the design of the Dhammcakka - the wheel of righteousness.</p>
<p>Bordering the ceiling are paintings drawn on similar pattern to the Kelaniya Vihara paintings illustrating Buddhist themes.</p>
<p>Though Wijewardene maintained a low key profile throughout his life, his name became a household word with the ever growing readership of Lake House papers.</p>
<p>Sir Ivor Jennings, an Irish Christian, the first vice-chancellor of the Peradeniya University of Sri Lanka commented that, &ldquo;As a Buddhist he (Wijewardene) could not advocate or allow his newspapers to advocate methods of violence&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Sri Lanka&rsquo;s first University was to be constructed in a locality that would be pleasant and second to none in Asia, Wijewardene&rsquo;s advocacy for a residential University located away from all distractions of the capital city of Colombo, finally won the day and the Sri Lanka University came up majestically in the Dumbara Valley in the hill country.</p>
<p>Wijewardene could not live to see the accomplishment of the cause of the University he had championed. The Wijewardene Hall stands as a living monument to his ideals.</p>
<p>Before his demise he donated his books from the Donald Ferguson Collection relating to the Dutch and Portuguese period in Lanka and all the maps he purchased in England and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Wijewardene also bequeathed a valuable collection of books and manuscripts purchased from the Library of W. A. de Silva to the University Sangharama in Peradeniya.</p>
<p>The Sangharamaya - a residence for the undergraduate Bhikkus of the University had been agitating in his mind during the latter part of his life. His main objective was providing separate accommodation with all facilities provided to the Bhikkus to enable them &ldquo;to obtain a University education in order that they may be able to perform a Dharmaduta service both in Sri Lanka and in foreign lands.”</p>
<p>Indeed, men of his calibre are few and far between. While the newspaper industry has changed drastically since the 1950s, the ideals he cherished in the field of journalism still hold true. However, not all journalists and media outlets play by these rules. Today, print media outlets are facing stiff competition from electronic and new media - there was no television here during Wijewardene’s time.</p>
<p>Newspapers have also embraced the Internet even as they compete with dedicated news websites and citizen journalism websites, not to mention Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>All main ANCL newspapers are available on the web and the Daily News and Dinamina are also available as apps on iOS and Android platforms. In fact, ANCL was the first in Sri Lanka and South Asia to have web editions with the launch of Daily News and Observer web editions in 1995 and it has always kept pace with the latest technology. All the media are converging today and one cannot predict what the media landscape would look like even in 2030.</p>
<p>Today, people are bombarded with news 24/7, on their mobiles, on television, radio and the Net. Truth and accuracy often become casualties of this ‘race to be first’ and even national interests are sometimes disregarded. Despite these developments, reports of the death of the (printed) newspaper are greatly exaggerated. Newspapers still have a story to tell - one that is more analytical, more in-depth and assuredly more trustworthy than the sound bites and video clips of the Internet age.</p>
<p>Yes, newspapers will evolve and change over time but all journalists, regardless of their platform, still have to be guided by the principles that Wijewardene believed in - being bold, truthful and objective - in this noble mission.

<p><img src="https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-76152850,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-229479,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg" alt="img">
LLRM Medical College</p>
<p>MEERUT: Several patients at Meerut’s LLRM Medical College on Monday told visiting UP minister Suresh Khanna that the hospital staff charges money from them to clean Covid-19 wards . Some of them also complained to the UP medical education minister that they were purchasing medicines &amp; PPE kits from the market, which they were supposed to get free of cost from the government hospital.</p>
<p>A few patients also alleged that they were asked for Rs 200 to get the emergency ward cleaned.</p>
<p>After listening to the grievances at Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College, the UP minister ordered a probe and directed Meerut’s district magistrate to head it.</p>
<p>After inspecting the hospital, the minister directed that the hospital “should be cleaned every three hours”.</p>
<p>Khanna added, “A 90 minute-lecture every 15 days for all the doctors on morality should be conducted. The doctors need to go back home and ask from themselves whether they’d give themselves 100 marks for their work every day. And if this is not the case, then they need to work harder.”</p>
<p>His visit comes days after LLRM Medical College was in the news after a monkey snatched blood samples of Covid-19 patients and destroyed them. A langoor, too, was at the hospital campus to keep the monkeys at bay.</p>
