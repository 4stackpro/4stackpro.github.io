<h3 id="cryptic-crosswords-too-confusing-decipher-them-with-these-seven-common-clue-recipes">&ldquo;Cryptic crosswords too confusing? Decipher them with these seven common clue recipes&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.abc.net.au/cm/rimage/8679900-16x9-large.jpg?v=2" alt="img">
Have you tried your hand at the cryptic crossword, only to find it too cryptic?</p>
<p>Writer and broadcaster David Astle creates crosswords for Fairfax newspapers under the initials DA, which fans say stand for &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Attempt&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But Astle said anyone could attempt cryptic crosswords with a little knowledge of how they worked.</p>
<p>Here he gives seven clues, each one an example of a common cryptic crossword recipe.</p>
<p>Sweet stall (5)</p>
<p>The best way to get started on a cryptic crossword, Astle said, was to look for the shortest clue.</p>
<p>If a clue only has two words it is most likely using the double-definition recipe, in which you are given two synonyms of the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stall can be a noun, a booth that you see at a school fair, or it can be a verb when you tarry or lag,&rdquo; Astle said.</p>
<p>The clue also calls for a synonym for &ldquo;sweet&rdquo;, so we can deduce that the five-letter solution to this clue is &ldquo;fudge&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Terrain ruined coach (7)</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you see a word that means devastation or rearrangement, just like &lsquo;ruined&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s possibly an anagram,&rdquo; Astle said.</p>
<p>Rearranging the letters of &ldquo;terrain&rdquo; into a word that means &ldquo;coach&rdquo; gives you the answer &ldquo;trainer&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Apply some simple mentoring (9)</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;some&rdquo; indicates that this clue follows the hidden formula, where the answer is hidden in the clue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you take out some of &lsquo;simple mentoring&rsquo; you will find the word &lsquo;implement&rsquo; &hellip; a word that means &lsquo;apply&rsquo;,&rdquo; Astle said.</p>
<p>Shopkeeper sounds ruder (6)</p>
<p>The appearance of the word &ldquo;sounds&rdquo; gives away that this clue is asking for a homophone — a word that sounds like another word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any signpost suggesting hearing, you know it&rsquo;s a homophone clue,&rdquo; Astle said.</p>
<p>This clue is asking for a synonym of &lsquo;shopkeeper&rsquo; that sounds like a synonym for &lsquo;ruder&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grocer sounds like &lsquo;grosser&rsquo;,&rdquo; Astle said, so our answer is &ldquo;grocer&rdquo;.</p>
<p>David Astle says cryptic crosswords are best attempted with a friend. ( ABC News Breakfast )</p>
<p>Wave cereal bowl (8)</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no signpost here, no indicator, and when a clue has no indicator it usually is the charade recipe,&rdquo; Astle said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is where a word is broken down into little pieces, like a train made up of small carriages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By combining &ldquo;bran&rdquo; (cereal) and &ldquo;dish&rdquo; (bowl) we can construct a word meaning &ldquo;wave&rdquo; — &ldquo;brandish&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Damp fog hides nothing (5)</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds like a weather forecast, but don&rsquo;t be fooled,&rdquo; Astle said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cryptic crossword clues try to tell you a story — ignore the story and look at the words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;hides&rdquo; is a possible signpost that this is a container clue, where one word is put inside another to create the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a short word for fog? Mist,&rdquo; Astle said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What symbol means nothing? 0 (zero).</p>
<p>&ldquo;When mist &lsquo;hides&rsquo; 0, you get &lsquo;moist&rsquo;, meaning damp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boat in waters going west (5)</p>
<p>The phrase &ldquo;going west&rdquo; indicates that this is a reversal clue.</p>
<p>A synonym of waters is &ldquo;pools&rdquo;, which you can reverse to get &ldquo;sloop&rdquo;, a type of boat.</p>
<p>The signpost for reversal clues change depending on the direction of the answer in the grid.</p>
<p>An across clue might say &ldquo;going west&rdquo; or &ldquo;left&rdquo;, while a down clue could say &ldquo;going up&rdquo; or &ldquo;rising&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id="meet-the-cast-of-itvs-indian-period-drama-beecham-house">&ldquo;Meet the cast of ITV’s Indian period drama Beecham House&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2019/02/BEECHAM-HOUSE-01-66a6d0f.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=620,413" alt="img">
Given that it was co-created and written by one of the UK’s most respected film-makers, Gurinder Chadha, perhaps it is no surprise that Beecham House (airing on PBS Masterpiece on Sundays at 10/9c) has attracted some big-name actors from Britain, India – and beyond.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Set at the very end of the 18th century in Delhi before the British had consolidated power in that region, this six-part drama follows the story of John Beecham (Tom Bateman) and his family, friends and enemies.</p>
<p>Here are the characters you need to meet – and the actors who play them…</p>
<p>Tom Bateman plays John Beecham</p>
<p>Who is John Beecham? Described as “enigmatic” and “soulful”, John Beecham is a handsome former soldier who has quit the East India Company in disgust at its behaviour towards the Indians. Now, he has purchased a magnificent mansion and renamed it Beecham House – but the servants are surprised when he turns up with a baby boy and two Indian nursemaids in tow.</p>
<p>“Wealthy and distinguished, John has witnessed profiteering and exploitation during his time with the controlling East India Company and has resolved to conduct his business as a trader in a more equitable manner,” ITV says. “Determined to escape his previous life, John appears haunted by his past, but is inspired to become an honourable member of the region’s trading community.”</p>
<p>What else has Tom Bateman been in? The actor recently starred as Rawdon Crawley in ITV’s adaptation of Vanity Fair. He played Bouc in Murder on the Orient Express, and Justin Parker in Cold Feet, as well as Robert Jekyll in the TV series Jekyll &amp; Hyde and Guiliano Medici in Da Vinci’s Demons.</p>
<p>Lesley Nicol plays Henrietta Beecham</p>
<p>Who is Henrietta Beecham? John’s interfering mother, who has travelled from her home in England to stay with John in India. Despite not having seen her son for many years, Mrs Beecham feels perfectly entitled to boss him around – and attempt to play matchmaker.</p>
<p>What else has Lesley Nicol been in? Lesley Nicol will be forever remembered as the cook Mrs Patmore from Downton Abbey, a role she’s reprising in the upcoming Downton Abbey movie. Other credits include The Catch, Goldie and Bear, East Is East, and The Lion, the Witch &amp; the Wardrobe.</p>
<p>Leo Suter plays Daniel Beecham</p>
<p>Who is Daniel Beecham? John Beecham’s younger brother, who is a soldier for the East India Company. The two haven’t seen each other for ten years. Daniel is a bit of a womaniser and a party animal.</p>
<p>What else has Leo Suter been in? As Lord Edward Drummond, Leo Suter had an extremely dramatic role in series two of Victoria. He starred as Jack in the BBC Three series Clique, and also played Young Stringer in Sanditon.</p>
<p>Dakota Blue Richards plays Margaret Osbourne</p>

<p>Grégory Fitoussi plays General Castillion</p>
<p>Who is General Castillion? A French mercenary working for the Emperor, at a time when the French are challenging the East India Company for India. General Castillon is suspicious of John, believing him to be an agent of the Company, and plans to prevent John being granted a trading licence.</p>
<p>What else has Grégory Fitoussi been in? The French actor stars as Noah in the TV series Riviera. His other credits include Le Bureau des Légendes, Speakerine, Spiral, Spin, and Mr Selfridge – in which he starred as Henri Leclair.</p>
<p>Bessie Carter plays Violet</p>
<p>Who is Violet? A young family friend who has travelled with Mrs Henrietta Beecham to India. It quickly becomes clear that she was hoping John would agree to marry her.</p>
<p>What else has Bessie Carter been in? You may have spotted her in Howards End as Evie Wilcox, or in Cranford as Margaret Gidman. Really eagle-eyed viewers may even recognise her as a factory woman from 2012 movie Les Misérables.</p>
<p>Adil Ray plays Murad Beg</p>
<p>Who is Murad Beg? John’s neighbour, who dislikes French General Castillon intensely and agrees to help John secure a trading licence. English governess Margaret Osborne teaches his daughter Roshanara (Medha Shankar).</p>

<p>What else has Viveik Kalra been in? Young actor Viveik Kalra is only just out of drama school, but he has already starred in another ITV drama – 2018’s Next of Kin.</p>
