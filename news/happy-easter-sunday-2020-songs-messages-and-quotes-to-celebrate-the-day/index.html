Expect to eat plenty of chocolate eggs today (Picture: Getty Images)</p>
<p>Today is Easter Sunday – and while the day’s normally one for celebrations and get-togethers (not to mention a lot of chocolate), this year’s Easter is looking rather different in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>With the UK still in lockdown, the usual family get-togethers are off limits, while church services have also moved online, and egg hunts are moving into the back garden.</p>
<p>However that doesn’t mean people can’t mark the day in other ways, and listening to Easter music and sharing online greetings can still take place.</p>
<p>Here’s some suggestions on what you might want to listen to, and how to greet others celebrating the festival.</p>
<p>Top Easter songs</p>
<p>According to Praise Charts, these are the top five songs for Easter 2020:</p>
<p>Christ Our Hope In Life and Death (Matt Papa, Keith Getty, Krystyn Getty)</p>
<p>King Of Kings (Hillsong Worship)</p>
<p>Graves Into Gardens (Elevation Worship, Brandon Lake)</p>
<p>Holy Water (We The Kingdom)</p>
<p>See A Victory (Elevation Worship)</p>
<p>Easter messages and quotes</p>
<p>Even in the dark days of this Easter, we still have hope. In the new life of the resurrection of Jesus, we dare to have faith in life before death…</p>

Happy Easter From Everyone at Space Coast Daily</p>
<p>By History // April 12, 2020</p>
<p>The History Of Easter</p>
<p>ABOVE VIDEO: A quick look at the holiest day on the Christian calender, Easter. (History Video)</p>
<p>(HISTORY) – Easter, which celebrates Jesus Christ’s resurrection from the dead, is Christianity’s most important holiday. It has been called a moveable feast because it doesn’t fall on a set date every year, as most holidays do.</p>
<p>Instead, Christian churches in the West celebrate Easter on the first Sunday following the full moon after the vernal equinox on March 21.</p>
<p>Therefore, Easter is observed anywhere between March 22 and April 25 every year. Orthodox Christians use the Julian calendar to calculate when Easter will occur and typically celebrate the holiday a week or two after the Western churches, which follow the Gregorian calendar.</p>
<p>The exact origins of this religious feast day’s name are unknown.</p>
<p>Some sources claim the word Easter is derived from Eostre, a Teutonic goddess of spring and fertility.</p>
<p>Other accounts trace Easter to the Latin term hebdomada alba, or white week, an ancient reference to Easter week and the white clothing donned by people who were baptized during that time.</p>
<p>Through a translation error, the term later appeared as esostarum in Old High German, which eventually became Easter in English. In Spanish, Easter is known as Pascua; in French, Paques.</p>
<p>These words are derived from the Greek and Latin Pascha or Pasch, for Passover. Jesus’ crucifixion and resurrection occurred after he went to Jerusalem to celebrate Passover (or Pesach in Hebrew), the Jewish festival commemorating the ancient Israelites’ exodus from slavery in Egypt. Pascha eventually came to mean Easter.</p>
<p>Easter is really an entire season of the Christian church year, as opposed to a single-day observance.</p>
<p>Lent, the 40-day period leading up to Easter Sunday, is a time of reflection and penance and represents the 40 days that Jesus spent alone in the wilderness before starting his ministry, a time in which Christians believe he survived various temptations by the devil. The day before Lent, known as Mardi Gras or Fat Tuesday, is a last hurrah of food and fun before the fasting begins.</p>
<p>The week preceding Easter is called Holy Week and includes Maundy Thursday, which commemorates Jesus’ last supper with his disciples; Good Friday, which honors the day of his crucifixion; and Holy Saturday, which focuses on the transition between the crucifixion and resurrection.</p>
<p>The 50-day period following Easter Sunday is called Eastertide and includes a celebration of Jesus’ ascension into heaven.</p>
<p>In addition to Easter’s religious significance, it also has a commercial side, as evidenced by the mounds of jelly beans and marshmallow chicks that appear in stores each spring.</p>
<p>As with Christmas, over the centuries various folk customs and pagan traditions, including Easter eggs, bunnies, baskets and candy, have become a standard part of this holy holiday.</p>

<h3 id="doug-creamer-happy-easter---salisbury-post">Doug Creamer: Happy Easter - Salisbury Post</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.salisburypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/facebook-salisburypost.png" alt="img">
For more years than I can count, the tradition in my family has been to gather at my brother’s house for Easter. Everyone would go to their own church for Easter services, some even venturing out for sunrise services. Then we would all make our way to my brother’s house for a great lunch, followed by an Easter egg hunt.</p>
<p>I am really going to miss the gathering this year. Mom always brought the ham. Everybody else brought all the trimmings. My favorite was all the different types of salad that were there to enjoy. Naturally, there would be many different kinds of dessert. One thing that was really popular with the kids (when they were younger) was the Jell-O eggs. I never took one because I thought the kids were supposed to get them, but I will miss seeing them this year.</p>
<p>After the big meal, my brother would look over and nod his head. That meant it was time to go out and hide the Easter eggs. I know we accumulated hundreds of plastic eggs through the years. We would put them out everywhere. As the kids got older, we worked hard to really hide the eggs. I know some of my nieces and nephews were teenagers and still hunting Easter eggs. All the older adults would sit on folding chairs and watch the kids run around collecting eggs.</p>
<p>There would always be some basketball games, my brother and I would shoot a few games of pool, and there was always plenty of catching up. There would be little conversations here and there, and always plenty of laughter. You can’t get my family together without the prankster coming out in all of us. The laughter would slowly fade as each of us would head our separate ways. Stomachs filled, hearts warmed, and still chuckling as we drove home.</p>
<p>Easter will be different for families everywhere. The highways will be less busy. There won’t be as much good food to eat. Easter egg hunts will have to wait, or at least become more creative. The hugging, the family games, but most importantly, the laughter, will all have to wait. It will be alright. I know that in my family we will get together once this stay-at-home order is dropped. The fun and laughter will resume and we will all have stories of what we did during our time of being home.</p>
<p>There is one thing that this coronavirus can’t stop, and that is the real meaning of Easter. It’s hard to believe that there are still people who don’t know what Easter is all about. I assure you that many churches have launched online and live versions of their services. You can attend Easter Sunday service right from the comfort of your home. I have links to a number of churches that are having live services each Sunday at EncouragingU.com.</p>
<p>We know the message of Christmas is that Jesus came to earth born to be our savior. The message of Easter is the fulfillment of his mission. Jesus was born to be the sacrificial lamb that would take away our sins and restore a right relationship with God. God’s law required a blood sacrifice to cleanse us from our sins. Jesus died on the cross to pay the price we could not pay.</p>
<p>His death is not the end of the story. At sunrise on Easter morning, Jesus rose from the dead. No other religious leader did that. He experienced death’s sting but came out the other side a resurrected king. He has all authority and power. He has set us free from sin and death. He has given us forgiveness, joy, and peace.</p>
<p>The coronavirus can’t stop you from experiencing the true meaning or the true gifts of Easter. All you have to do is open your hearts to the living God. He’s done the rest. He paid the price for your redemption. If you accept Jesus as your savior, you can be assured of your place with Him for all eternity. While you are alive here you can experience His love, joy, peace, forgiveness, and His abiding presence. It’s yours for the asking and receiving.</p>
<p>I want to encourage you to invite Jesus into your heart. Easter is symbolic of the life-changing power that is available to you. The same power that raised Jesus from the grave is now available to you. You don’t have to clean yourself up first. He is awesome at taking broken lives and transforming them into something beautiful. I promise He will do it for you.</p>
