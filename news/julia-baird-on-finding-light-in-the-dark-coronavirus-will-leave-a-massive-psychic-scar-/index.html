After surviving cancer and a brutal heartbreak, the journalist wanted to find out how people find strength through despair. Her new book Phosphorescence could not have been better timed</p>
<p>Everything is on the periphery of the coronavirus at the moment. From where we are eating (home) to where we are socialising (home) and where we spend all of our time now (the internet, mostly), it is all dictated by the pandemic. So it has already been noted – numerous times – that Julia Baird’s book on how to cope with tough times could not have been more prescient.</p>
<p>But I will note it again here, because you can’t talk about the book (or anything, really) without referencing coronavirus.</p>
<p>Phosphorescence – subtitled On Awe, Wonder and Things That Sustain You When the World Goes Dark – began to germinate when Baird was going through a particularly brutal heartbreak a few years ago and speaking with her counsellor about how to see a way through. A few years later Baird was diagnosed with a rare type of cancer that could have killed her, which involved numerous operations and months at home. With two young children, Baird writes, her world “narrowed to a slit”.</p>
<p>Awe, wonder and the overview effect: how feeling small gives us much-needed perspective | Julia Baird Read more</p>
<p>But through it, she learned how to persevere. Not how to do something as twee as “flourish” during one of the toughest times in her life, but how to just keep putting one foot in front of the other. As we collectively feel the world as we know it shifting under our feet, from worrying about the mortality of our parents, and ourselves, to losing jobs it did not occur to us two months ago could be lost, there are a lot of us who need to hear how to simply make it through the day.</p>
<p>“If someone said to me when I got diagnosed, ‘Just go and sit under a tree and do some breathing’ – you know, we don’t do violence anymore, but you would want to punch them in that face. [This book] is really not meant to be that idea,” she says over the phone (face-to-face interviews are not considered essential work).</p>
<p>Baird mentions the Stockdale paradox, based on the experience of an American soldier who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam for years and who survived it not by convincing himself it would be over soon, but by facing the reality of how terrible it was. Baird says you should be aware of the “crappy and brutal” situation you find yourself in.</p>
<p>“But you don’t lose the faith that ultimately you will prevail, and that ultimately we will come out of it. The tide will turn,” she says. “It’s not like, ‘Oh, don’t worry, the world’s not that bad’. It’s, ‘Yeah, it is serious, serious stuff we have to deal with now in terms of global peril, let alone climate change and the future of the planet – and we have got a lot of work to do’. And to get through it, you’ve got to work out what makes you strong and tap into that.</p>
<p>“Everyone has their own thing,” she continues. “For me it was pockets of calm and stillness, and prayer or meditation, and getting into the ocean. It doesn’t mean the days aren’t dark. It doesn’t mean there aren’t times where you totally despair and struggle to even have a grain of hope. It just means that you are deliberately pursuing things that give you strength, instead of thinking [that things] are serendipitously falling apart.”</p>

<p>The meticulous research throughout Phosphorescence is typical of Baird, who is a host of ABC’s The Drum and the author of the internationally renowned biography Victoria: The Queen. She cites studies into the mental effects of blue space such as ocean and sky; forest bathing in Japan; storm chasing and philosophy. She references stoicism, with Descartes’ explanation of rainbows threaded through her own experiences. Even without a global health pandemic to ground it, it is a stunning book.</p>
<p>Some of the pillars she recommends include a more deliberate way of living, and getting out into nature. She writes about the importance of feeling small, stepping away from our phones and looking outwards, away from ourselves; and the joy of having lower expectations.</p>
<p>But while it’s full of strategies that could certainly help when you’ve lost your job and are not allowed to hug your mother or have dinner with your friends, some of them feel impossible right now.</p>
<p>A new hypervigilance has developed for a lot of us, as we track every development of the coronavirus on our phones, minute by minute. When we’re not entranced by the news, our phones also carry all of our loved ones. How can we possibly put down our screens when it feels like we are watching the world end on them? Then talking about the world ending with our mates?</p>
<p>“You cannot avoid the internet right now,” Baird concedes. “It’s like a pipeline for the outside world … We need information, and we’re not entirely sure who to believe – and people keep contradicting themselves. So we’re doing all these mental gymnastics every time we hop on.”</p>
<p>But there are benefits too. “There’s a lot of community and beautiful stuff happening online as well. This reminds us that for the first time in centuries we’re really facing a common threat globally. And it’s amazing to watch people respond to that.</p>
<p>“This will [leave] a massive psychic scar. It’s a huge death toll, there will be rage at negligence, at lack of foresight, at incompetence. I don’t know what can come from that – but I’ve never seen people act online the way they are acting now.”</p>

<p>Baird chose the title to allude not to the brilliance of light, but the process of storing it for gradual release. “I don’t mean for people to light up and be sparkly; it’s not [about being] covered in glitter and sequins,” she says. “For a long time, phosphorescent things take in the light of the sun, right? And then they emit that very slowly for a long time afterwards.”</p>
<p>Baird writes about losing her appetite and not being able to sleep after a heartbreak, and calling her counsellor in tears saying she did not know how she was going to get through.</p>
<p>He told her he had once said the same thing to his mentor, who slapped him, and said, “It is now that everything you have been given in your life matters; this is what you draw on. Your parents, your friends, your work, your books – everything you have ever been told, everything you have ever learned, this is when you use that.”</p>
<p>“I was trying to share that sense as well,” Baird says. “It’s not ‘how do you leap and bound after serious trauma?’ It’s ‘how do you keep putting one foot after the other, or at least just moving your toes’.”</p>

The mysterious beauty of the universe can lead us all to ponder humanity and the planet we call home, as Julia Baird writes in this book extract</p>
<p>Surely the best witnesses to the fact that the key to awe and wonder is feeling small are astronauts. Like Captain Jim Lovell, who, when on board the Apollo 8 on Christmas Eve 1968, raised his hand against the window and watched the entire planet disappear. “I realised how insignificant we all are if everything I’d ever known is behind my thumb,” he said. The first person to ever step on to the moon, Neil Armstrong, did exactly the same thing. He recalled later: “It suddenly struck me that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn’t feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.”</p>
<p>We have shot hundreds of human beings into space over the past few decades, most with a background in engineering, science, medicine or the military, and almost all of them seem to return with permanently widened eyes. Former soldiers suddenly speak of elation, mathematicians of bliss, biologists of transcendence. The term for the psychological impact of flying into space and viewing the Earth as a simple dot is called the “Overview Effect”, and it was coined by author Frank White in his book of the same name in 1987. White defined it as “a profound reaction to viewing the Earth from outside its atmosphere”.</p>
<p>They told me I had 18 months to live. Nothing was more important than finishing my book | Andrew Darby Read more</p>
<p>The Overview Effect turns astronauts into “evangelists, preaching the gospel of orbit” as they return from space with a renewed faith or on a quest for wisdom. For some it’s a kind of lingering euphoria that results in a permanent change of perspective. The first human to reach outer space, the Russian cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin, who circled the Earth for 108 minutes in 1961, came back with a clarion call: “Orbiting Earth in the spaceship, I saw how beautiful our planet is. People, let us preserve and increase this beauty, not destroy it.”</p>
<p>In recent years, scientists have been trying to measure and understand the Overview Effect, even sending people into virtual space, where they view galaxies through portals, and then grilling them about their responses, but the accounts of astronauts provide the best insights. The words they use are saturated with awe, an understanding of how fragile the Earth is, with its paper-thin atmosphere, and how much needs to be done to protect it and its inhabitants.</p>
<p>As Syrian astronaut Muhammad Ahmad Faris said, when you look at Earth from space, the “scars of national boundaries” disappear. American Sam Durrance said he became emotional after having hurtled past the stratosphere into black space because “you’re removed from the Earth but at the same time you feel this incredible connection to the Earth like nothing I’d ever felt before”. Mae Jemison, the first black woman to travel in space, who orbited the Earth 127 times in 1992 on board the space shuttle Endeavour, also says she felt “very connected with the rest of the universe”. (She later told students: “Life is best when you live deeply and look up.”)</p>

<p>The Japanese term yugen, which derives from the study of aesthetics, is sometimes used to describe space-gazing. It is said to mean “a profound, mysterious sense of the beauty of the universe … and the sad beauty of human suffering”, though the meaning and translation depend on the context. Japanese actor and aesthetician Zeami Motokiyo described some of the ways to access yugen:</p>
<p>To watch the sun sink behind a flower-clad hill. To wander on in a huge forest without thought of return. To stand upon the shore and gaze after a boat that disappears behind distant islands. To contemplate the flight of wild geese seen and lost among the clouds. And subtle shadows of bamboo on bamboo.</p>
<p>Or to stare at the heavens from Earth, or Earth from the heavens.</p>
<p>Yugen is also defined as “an awareness of the universe that triggers emotional responses too big and powerful for words”. It’s striking how, repeatedly, people who venture into space speak of the inadequacy of words. Former Nasa astronaut Kathryn D Sullivan, who in 1984 became the first woman to ever walk in space (and in 2013 was nominated by president Obama to be under secretary of commerce for oceans and atmosphere), was also gobsmacked.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to explain how amazing and magical this experience is,” she says. “First of all, there’s the astounding beauty and diversity of the planet itself, scrolling across your view at what appears to be a smooth, stately pace … I’m happy to report that no amount of prior study or training can fully prepare anybody for the awe and wonder this inspires.”</p>
<p>American engineer and astronaut Nicole Stott reported that she was “stunned in a way that was completely unexpected”. She described it to her seven-year-old son this way: “Just take a lightbulb – the brightest lightbulb that you could ever possibly imagine – and paint it all the colours that you know Earth to be, and turn it on, and be blinded by it.”</p>
<p>When you shrink, your ability to see somehow sharpens. When you see the beauty, vastness and fragility of nature, you want to preserve it. You see what we share, and how we connect. You understand being small. Astronaut Boris Volynov said that after seeing Earth from black space “you become more full of life, softer. You begin to look at all living things with greater trepidation and you begin to be more kind and patient with the people around you.”</p>
<p>Scott Kelly, who spent a full year on the International Space Station from 2015 to 2016, delighting Earth-dwellers with his tweets and superb photographs, told Business Insider that the experience of space makes people more empathetic, “more in touch with humanity and who we are, and what we should do to not only take care of the planet but also to solve our common problems, which clearly are many”. Kelly’s insights echo those of many others: the splendour and vulnerability of the Earth, the connectedness of people, and the need to work in concert, across nations. He said:</p>
<p>“The planet is incredibly beautiful, breathtakingly beautiful. Having said that, parts of it are polluted, like with constant levels of pollution in certain parts of Asia. You see how fragile the atmosphere looks. It’s very thin. It’s almost like a thin contact lens over somebody’s eye, and you realise all the pollutants we put into the atmosphere are contained in that very thin film over the surface. It’s a little bit scary actually to look at it. And then you realise looking at the Earth, that despite its beauty and its tranquility, there’s a lot of hardship and conflict that goes on. You look at the planet without borders, especially during the day. At night you can see countries with lights, but during the daytime it looks like we are all part of one spaceship, Spaceship Earth. And we’re all flying through space together, as a team, and it gives you this perspective – people have described it as this ‘orbital perspective’ – on humanity, and you get this feeling that we just need to work better – much, much better – to solve our common problems.”</p>
<p>The first Canadian to walk in space, Chris Hadfield, says whizzing across continents and seeing a sunrise or sunset every 45 minutes creates “a feeling of privilege and sort of a reverence, an awe that is pervasive. And that sense of wonder and privilege and clarity of the world slowly shifts your view.” He believes the Overview Effect is not limited to spaceflight but is more about “when you sense that there is something so much bigger than you, so much more deep than you are, ancient, [that] has sort of a natural importance that dwarfs your own.” This understanding, Hadfield suggests, can lead people to make smarter global decisions, and less “jealous, local, narrow” ones. We hope.</p>

<p>One of my favourite scientists is the brilliant Carl Sagan, an eloquent speaker, prolific author and cosmologist who was known in America as “the astronomer of the people”. He studied extraterrestrial life and sent physical “universal” messages into space in the hope that other beings might find and understand them. In his 1994 book Pale Blue Dot, which is about the solar system and our place in it, Sagan wrote about the sight of Earth from space.</p>
<p>He perfectly described how that view makes us keenly aware that our little planet is just a pale blue dot floating in an immensity of space, and our only home, where we and everyone we love, and everyone who has ever lived, has spent their lives. And he pointed out that recognising that all of humanity’s creation, and millennia of delight and pain, of hubris and striving, have all taken place on this tiny, distant speck must surely help us realise the importance of being decent and careful with each other, and of protecting and loving the Earth.</p>
<p>If only we could immediately send all members of our governing bodies, politicians and judges and thinkers, into outer space – and allow them to eventually return – to instil in them the urgency of protecting our planet.</p>

<p>You don’t have to leave this blue dot to experience awe, wonder and the like; but the accounts of mystified astronauts remind us of the importance of being alive to it, to open every door, window, threshold and portal to its possibility.</p>
