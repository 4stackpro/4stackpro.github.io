Like many others in the world who are currently in coronavirus lockdown, acclaimed British painter David Hockney is remaining at his home in Normandy, which he moved into earlier this March. In a BBC exclusive, Hockney shared 10 of his most recent Apple iPad images he created during this period of self-isolation. “I began drawing the winter trees on a new iPad,” he said. “Then this virus started…I went on drawing the winter trees that eventually burst into blossom… Meanwhile, the virus is going mad, and many people said my drawings were a great respite from what was going on.”</p>
<p>Spending most of his days drawing in the garden, Hockney sent a work in progress to one of his friends, which lead him to release an image of daffodils, titled Do Remember They Can’t Cancel the Spring, for publication. His nine other works — which remain unpublished — were painted over the last few days. “Why are my iPad drawings seen as a respite from the news?” Hockney says. “Well, they are obviously made by the hand depicting the renewal that is the spring in this part of the world.” His images are a record of his direct observations with nature, documenting his unique experiences of his subjects and the space in which they exist.</p>

<p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/11358/production/_111488407_gettyimages-137179421.jpg" alt="img">

<p>David Hockney is in lockdown at his house in Normandy with his dog Ruby and two of his long-standing assistants, JP and Jonathan.</p>
<p>He is in the garden most days, drawing the spring awakening on his iPad. In a BBC exclusive, he is sharing 10 of his most recent images (including one animation), nine of which have never been published before, for us all to enjoy at this difficult time, along with his thoughts on the role of art in life.</p>
<p>The artist previously visited Normandy in the autumn of 2018 following the installation of his stained-glass window in Westminster Abbey. He thought it would be a good place to draw and paint the arrival of spring, something he&rsquo;d done around a decade earlier in East Yorkshire. Those pictures, paintings, and films were the basis for a successful exhibition in 2012 at the Royal Academy in London.</p>
<p>He was attracted to Normandy because it offered a broader range of blossoms, with apple, cherry, pear and plum trees, as well as the hawthorn and blackthorn he had painted before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found this house with a large garden that was cheaper than anything in Sussex&rdquo;, he wrote in a letter to me. They bought it, renovated it and built a small studio; and have been living there since early March.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I began drawing the winter trees on a new iPad,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Then this virus started…</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went on drawing the winter trees that eventually burst into blossom. This is the stage we are right now. Meanwhile the virus is going mad, and many people said my drawings were a great respite from what was going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sent some of his work in progress to friends, which led to him releasing one image of daffodils for publication, which he titled: Do Remember They Can&rsquo;t Cancel the Spring. He is now sharing nine more, all painted in the last few days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are my iPad drawings seen as a respite from the news? Well, they are obviously made by the hand depicting the renewal that is the spring in this part of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The point being that his images are the product of him looking directly at nature and depicting or representing what he sees by transmitting his sensory reaction through his fingers onto paper via a pencil, rather than mediating the process through a photograph.</p>
<p>His pictures are a record of how he, uniquely, is experiencing reality of his subject and the space in which it exists. The one-eyed mechanical camera flattens out all this individual nuance.</p>
<p>Image copyright David Hockney Image caption The artist has also made multiple sketches of his home in Normandy</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intend to carry on with my work, which I now see as very important,&rdquo; he wrote to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have lost touch with nature rather foolishly as we are a part of it, not outside it. This will in time be over and then what? What have we learned? I am 83 years old, I will die. The cause of death is birth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only real things in life are food and love in that order, just like our little dog Ruby. I really believe this and the source of art is love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love life.&rdquo;</p>

<p><img src="https://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2020/03/DAVID_HOCKNEY_SHARES_NEW_WORK_WB_FEATURED_21032020-e1584818726656.jpg" alt="img">
“Do remember they can’t cancel the spring” by David Hockney (Image via Instagram)</p>
<p>One of the world’s greatest living artists has delivered a much-needed message of hope with a new painting unveiled this week.</p>
<p>David Hockney, 82, shared the new piece on Thursday via Instagram, through Denmark’s Louisiana Museum of Modern Art. A drawing composed on his iPad, the image depicts a cluster of bright yellow daffodils blossoming in the midst of a green field with a grey and barren landscape in the distant background.</p>
<p>The new work is titled, “Do remember they can’t cancel the spring.”</p>
<p>The British artist is a painter, draftsman, printmaker, stage designer, and photographer known as one of the key figures in the pop art movement of the 1960s. The iconic imagery he has produced includes a series of three swimming-pool-themed paintings – “The Splash,” “A Little Splash,” and “A Bigger Splash” – which are his most widely-recognized works. A 1972 work, “Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures),” set the record for the largest amount paid for an artwork by a living artist when it sold at auction in November 2018 for $90 million – though that record was subsequently broken when Jeff Koons’ “Rabbit” sold at Christie’s in New York for $91 million a few months later.</p>
<p>He has been openly gay throughout his career, exploring his sexuality through artworks such as “We Two Boys Together Clinging,” named after a poem by Walt Whitman.</p>
<p>Hockney has been weathering the coronavirus lockdown at his home in Normandy, the northern French where he relocated from Los Angeles in 2018, jokingly citing the ability to smoke in restaurants as one of the reasons for his transatlantic move, according to The Daily Mail.</p>
<p>He told interviewers, ‘I’d like to just work and paint, and to be able to smoke and eat in a restaurant at the same time. Thank God for Normandy. The French know how to live. They know about pleasure.”
