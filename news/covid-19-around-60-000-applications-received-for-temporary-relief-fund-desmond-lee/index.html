SINGAPORE — Around 60,000 people in Singapore have applied for the Temporary Relief Fund (TRF), which provides urgent financial assistance for those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, since it was launched on Wednesday (1 April).</p>
<p>“My colleagues at the SSOs (social service organisations) and CCs (community centres) under the People’s Association are working hard to get affected Singaporeans the support they need,” said Minister for Social and Family Development Desmond Lee during a COVID-19 multi-ministry taskforce virtual press conference on Friday.</p>
<p>The TRF provides low- and middle-income Singaporeans and permanent residents with a one-off cash sum of $500 to assist those who are facing financial difficulties due to the pandemic. It was announced in Parliament by Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat on 27 March as part of the Resilience Budget meant to help those affected by the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>Lee noted that TRF applications are open until 30 April and that there is “no need to rush”.</p>
<p>During the same press conference, the taskforce announced a number of “circuit breaker” measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore, including the month-long closure of most physical workplaces not involved in essential services from 7 April until 4 May.</p>
<p>Lee noted, however, that SSOs and CCs would remain open during this period so Singaporeans in need can continue to receive social and financial assistance, with the “appropriate safe-distancing measures put in place”.</p>
<p>“These include the TRF, the COVID-19 Support Grant as well as other ComCare assistance schemes,” he added.</p>
<p>Some measures to be taken to ensure social distancing is practised during TRF applications include the launch of an online application form in the second week of April.</p>
<p>Those who still feel the need to apply for the TRF in person can visit SSOs and CCs to obtain the forms, which can be filled out at home and later dropped off in a designated box. On-site assistance would also be available for those looking to apply, said Lee.</p>

<p>The Temporary Relief Fund is a one-off S$500 cash assistance for Singaporeans who have lost their jobs or suffered an income loss of at least 30 per cent due to the COVID-19 outbreak, hence earning a household income below S$10,000. The fund is meant to help those who need help urgently before the Resilience Budget measures kick in next month, Social and Family Development Minister Desmond Lee tells CNA&rsquo;s Melissa Goh.

<h3 id="government-has-responsibility-to-parents-to-maintain-high-standards-across-pre-schools-desmond-lee">Government has responsibility to parents to &lsquo;maintain high standards&rsquo; across pre-schools: Desmond Lee</h3>
<p><img src="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12577838/16x9/991/557/97b90d8874f9dcfd9c49a82ca345bffd/HX/desmond-lee-speaks-to-reporters-on-mar-26--2020.png" alt="img">
SINGAPORE: The Government owes parents a responsibility to “maintain high standards” across all pre-schools so that they can have “peace of mind” when they go to work, said Social and Family Development Minister Desmond Lee on Thursday (Mar 26).</p>
<p>“Pre-schools are an essential service in Singapore. Parents entrust their children to our pre-school sector so they have peace of mind when they go to work,” he told reporters.</p>

<p>“Some parents have alternative caregiving arrangements readily available, but many do not, that’s why they avail themselves of childcare, including full-day childcare.”</p>
<p>This includes workers on the frontlines, like hospital staff, general practitioners, and other industries such as cleaners, those in F&amp;B and public transport, he said.</p>
<p>Mr Lee’s remarks follow Wednesday’s report by the Ministry of Health, which indicated a new cluster of 18 cases linked to the PAP Community Foundation (PCF) Sparkletots centre in Fengshan.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Fourteen of the 18 cases are employees at the pre-school, including the principal of the centre. Four of the other cases are family members of the principal.</p>
<p>In an update, Mr Lee told reporters that another member of the pre-school staff, a teacher, was confirmed on Thursday to have been infected with COVID-19.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, PCF announced that it would close all of its centres for four days from Thursday to review and reiterate its enhanced precautionary measures with staff and clean and disinfect premises.</p>
<p>The Fengshan centre will close for two weeks, and all children and staff present at the centre from Mar 16 to Mar 24 are on quarantine.</p>
<p>On why all PCF centres will close for four days instead of 14, Mr Lee said that other centres “have not had lots of infected individuals”. Thus, there is no need to account for the 14-day incubation period.</p>
<p>However, he noted parents’ concern about their children’s wellbeing, with some parents deciding to take their children out of their pre-schools.</p>
<p>To accommodate this, the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) decided to waive the one-day monthly attendance requirement for parents to qualify for pre-school subsidies.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Government is not opposed to adopting more drastic measures, “if there is a sign of growing community transmission”.</p>
<p>“We will have to consider more measures, including &hellip; more drastic measures, which could include closures of some workplaces, as well as closures of pre-schools, schools,” said Mr Lee.</p>
