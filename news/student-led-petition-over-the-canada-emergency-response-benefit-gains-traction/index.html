SUDBURY &ndash; During this unprecedented time of COVID-19, millions of Canadians will be turning to the Canada Emergency Response Benefit for help and post-secondary students say they should qualify.</p>
<p>An online petition called #Don&rsquo;tForgetStudents is calling on Ottawa to amend the government financial assistance program and has already garnered more than 34,000 signatures as of Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>The idea was sparked with a student leader at the University of Toronto, Nicholas Ferreira, who felt students had to be included.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had honestly just handed in this massive paper that I had for school. The next day, I was sort of bumbling around trying to figure out what to do with myself and I saw on Twitter that students were not eligible to apply for the CERB and I just thought that was wrong. So, I immediately contacted some friends that I knew to see if they wanted to get something going, start a petition,&rdquo; said Ferreira.</p>
<p>And from there, the idea was born. They took the movement to Change.org and consulted with other student leaders across the country and it&rsquo;s been gaining traction ever since.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s definitely more than I would have expected to get when we first started, but I think the reason for that is it&rsquo;s something that resonates with people. It&rsquo;s affecting a lot of students,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>His comments come on the heels of an announcement from Ottawa in which the federal government announced an extension to the Canada Summer Jobs program. It was also going to increase the wage subsidy so employers can receive 100 per cent of the minimum hourly wage for each employee.</p>
<p>Coronavirus newsletter sign-up: Get The COVID-19 Brief sent to your inbox</p>
<p>One of those student leaders who the campaign resonated with is Laurentian University&rsquo;s Katlyn Kotila, who is also a vice-president within the Students&rsquo; General Association.</p>
<p>Kotila says the changes to the Canada Summer Jobs program don&rsquo;t go far enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As of right now, there are about 2 million students affected by this and the Canadian Summer Jobs program really will only cover about 70,000 jobs, which is going to leave about 1,930,000 students astray,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Kotila says students don&rsquo;t often work throughout the year and now that the academic year is coming to a close, many are leaving school to find the internship opportunities they had are gone and offers of employment drying up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the uncertainty of the market, those summer jobs won&rsquo;t really be available for students. And so, not only do they not have any money coming in throughout the year, but they also won&rsquo;t have money coming in from the summer. So, they won&rsquo;t have very much to pay for the experiences they need to pay for,&rdquo; said Kotila.</p>
<p>Sudbury MP Paul Lefebvre tells CTV News that he understands students are concerned. He&rsquo;s been busy answering their phone calls and wants them to know that Ottawa is working on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s important for them to know is we are having, we&rsquo;ve been having, these discussions as to how can we ensure that they are supported. And right now, we see a bit of a short runway because of the month of April to make sure that we can include them in there somehow,&rdquo; said Lefebvre.</p>
<p>The Sudbury MP says every option is on the table right now in a bid to make sure no one gets left behind.</p>
<p>For now, students like Kotila say they&rsquo;re optimistic, but they plan to still fight until they see some action on the part of the government.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hopeful that the government&rsquo;s going to do the right thing and include that benefit for students. So, I&rsquo;m hopeful in this, yes,&rdquo; she said.

<h3 id="child-and-spousal-support-not-covered-by-governments-coronavirus-emergency-benefit-plan">Child and spousal support not covered by government’s coronavirus emergency benefit plan</h3>
<p><img src="https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/michelle-guy.jpg?quality=70&amp;strip=all&amp;w=720&amp;h=379&amp;crop=1" alt="img">

<p>Single parents who rely on spousal or child support payments as their primary source of income — and whose ex-partners can’t afford to pay due to the novel coronavirus pandemic — do not qualify for help through the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), Global News has learned.</p>
<p>This is despite assurances from the government that it would work to fill gaps in eligibility requirements for the program.</p>
<p>“I have clients who have come to me and said, ‘I don’t qualify for any of these programs. How am I going to feed my children?’” said Michelle Guy, a family law lawyer from Vancouver.</p>
<p>Guy has several clients whose ex-partners have lost their jobs and are no longer able to provide support payments.</p>
<p>4:10 Living with cancer through the COVID-19 pandemic Living with cancer through the COVID-19 pandemic</p>
<p>One of Guy’s clients is a single mom and full-time university student. Her ex-husband owns an optometry clinic and, as part of their divorce settlement, agreed to pay child and spousal support.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>When her ex-husband’s business closed on March 18 due to COVID-19, his lawyer sent a letter saying he could no longer afford his support payments because of the loss of income.</p>
<p>This left the woman feeling like she was unable to provide for her children because she doesn’t qualify for any of the existing relief programs.</p>
<p>“With no income, and no government benefits, what are single moms to do to support our children?” the woman said in a letter sent to New Democratic MP Jenny Kwan asking for help.</p>
<p>Must have ‘been working’ to qualify</p>
<p>In an email sent late Monday, a spokesperson for Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough said that to qualify for the CERB a person must “have been working and ceased working due to COVID-19.”</p>
<p>This information was provided in response to questions that explicitly asked if someone who receives child support, spousal support or child and spousal support and then loses these payments due to an ex-partner’s inability to pay is eligible for the program.</p>

<p>And while it’s unusual for someone to rely on support payments as their only source of revenue, it does happen, Guy said.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>There are many more people for whom these payments make up a significant portion of their income and who are now going without, she said, because their ex-partners can’t afford to pay.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, the trickle-down effect of the economics of this pandemic is that children, the most vulnerable members of our society, will be the ones bearing the brunt of the suffering,” Guy said.</p>
<p>Uptick in people unable to pay</p>
<p>Ryan Kniznik, a Toronto family law lawyer, said he’s seen a jump in the number of clients who can’t make child and spousal support payments because of COVID-19.</p>
<p>In many cases, clients are figuring out ways to pay whatever they can, he said. This includes taking out loans, deferring expenses and paying reduced amounts.</p>
<p>But there are situations where people cannot pay at all, he said, including small business owners with significant expenses and profound losses of income.</p>
<p>“If people literally don’t have support, and they don’t qualify for (emergency benefits), they’re going to be in a really tough spot,” he said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ashley Krol, a Toronto divorce lawyer, said she’s anticipating a 50 per cent increase in the amount of work her firm does on child and spousal support cases because of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>This is similar to what her firm experienced following the 2008 financial crisis, she said, when there was a spike in applications filed with provincial courts seeking adjustments to how much should be paid in support due to declining incomes.</p>
<p>“It’s fair to say there will be an explosion of cases,” Krol said.</p>
<p>Lack of support a ‘catastrophic’ problem</p>
<p>Losing spousal or child support due to COVID-19 is a “catastrophic” problem, Guy said.</p>
<p>She believes the government should find a way to bridge this gap for anyone whose ex-partner can’t afford to pay and that this support should be guaranteed throughout the duration of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Maya Roy, the CEO of YWCA Canada, agrees with Guy, adding that the financial consequences of COVID-19 have disproportionately affected women because they’re more likely to work in the retail and service sector jobs hardest hit by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Roy said women are also more likely to be the recipients of child and spousal support and that an ex-partner’s inability to pay could put families at risk of being unable to provide basic necessities and the care children need.</p>
<p>“This policy is actually going to push women further into poverty,” she said. “Most women are already living paycheque to paycheque. This policy is just going to make it worse.”</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>Expanded eligibility for CERB</p>
<p>On Saturday, the government promised it would expand CERB eligibility to include seasonal workers, students, business owners, those who’ve exhausted employment insurance benefits and anyone earning modest incomes from part-time work, royalties and honoraria.</p>
<p>The government also promised essential workers earning low wages will receive additional financial support and that it will not “unjustly penalize” anyone who applies for the CERB in good faith and is later found ineligible.</p>
<p>Global News asked if the government considered including people who rely on spousal or child support payments when designing the CERB’s eligibility requirements, but no direct answer was provided.</p>
<p>Marielle Hossack, a spokesperson for Qualtrough’s office, said the government’s goal when creating the CERB was to “get funding out to as many Canadian workers as quickly as possible.”</p>

<p>She also said the program is intended for workers who lost their job and expect to be without employment or self-employment income for at least 14 consecutive days during each eligibility period.</p>
<p>Hossack added the government is providing additional support to 12 million families through enhanced GST rebates and to three million families through increases to the Canada Child Benefit.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>“During this challenging time, our government is unwavering in our support for families,” she said.</p>
<p>Hossack did not indicate if the government plans to expand eligibility for financial assistance to anyone who’s lost spousal or child support payments due to COVID-19.

<h3 id="canada-emergency-response-benefit-has-to-be-re-applied-for-after-the-4-week-period-is-done">Canada Emergency Response Benefit Has To Be Re-Applied For After The 4-Week Period Is Done</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.narcity.com/u/2020/04/14/eca922bd65bbb8cb3d4e5ceeb8baf57a.jpg_1200x630.jpg" alt="img">
Do you need money? If you&rsquo;ve lost income because of COVID-19 and are getting help from the federal government, this is something you should know about. The Canada Emergency Response Benefit is up and running but you actually have to re-apply every four weeks. If your situation continues, the benefit doesn&rsquo;t automatically renew.</p>
<p>Canada Revenue Agency took to Twitter on April 14 to answer a couple of questions about the new benefit from the government including when you can start getting the money.</p>
<p>However, the most important one was about whether or not it is automatically renewed for the entire four-month period that you can get it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eligibility periods are fixed in 4-week periods. If your situation continues, you can re-apply for CERB for an additional 4-week period, to a maximum of 16 weeks (4 periods),&rdquo; the CRA said.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve applied and have gotten the benefit and your situation doesn&rsquo;t change, you&rsquo;ll need to continue to re-apply every four weeks for 16 weeks.</p>
<p>With the CERB, you get $2,000 a month for up to four months.</p>
<p>The eligibility periods are from March 15 to April 11, April 12 to May 9, May 10 to June 6, June 7 to July 4, July 5 to August 1, August 2 to August 29 and August 30 to September 26.</p>
<p>However, you can only get the benefit for a maximum of 16 weeks so you can&rsquo;t get money from March 15 all the way to September 26.</p>
<p>According to the CRA, if you start working after you&rsquo;ve gotten a payment but then stop working again, you need to completely re-apply.</p>
<p>When you do that, you have to confirm that you won&rsquo;t get employment income, self-employment income and/or provincial or federal benefits related to maternity or paternity leave for at least 14 days in a row during the period you&rsquo;re applying for.</p>
<p>There are a lot of requirements to be eligible for the benefit like not quitting your job voluntarily, being 15 or older when you apply, earning a certain amount of money in the last year and more.</p>
<p>Justin Trudeau first announced this new benefit on March 25 and it finally launched on April 6 but you can&rsquo;t just apply whenever you want to.</p>
<p>You have to apply based on your birth month.</p>
<p>Just a few days after applications opened, people were already getting money in their bank accounts.</p>
<p>There are some conditions related to the CERB like you can&rsquo;t get it if you&rsquo;re also getting the wage subsidy.</p>
<p>Also, if you got money from it without being eligible, you might have to pay it back come tax time next year.</p>
<p>With the CERB, you can get payment by direct deposit within three business days from when you submitted your application or by mail within 10 business days.
