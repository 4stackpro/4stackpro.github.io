MetService has halted construction of its $2.8 million weather radar in Otago as a result of Covid-19 and the country going into lockdown.</p>
<p>Construction on Lamb Hill, near Hindon, was in full swing and the project was running to schedule.</p>
<p>MetService meteorological data services manager Kevin Alder had anticipated the radar would be operational by late May this year, but that date would now be considerably later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The delay was unavoidable,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the Covid-19 Alert Level 4 being put in place, we have made the difficult but necessary decision to stop the construction work immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a result, the installation of the radar will be delayed by some months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At present, the radar’s foundations are almost complete - the last concrete for the foundations had been scheduled to be poured next week.</p>
<p>Off-site construction of the 12-metre tower was largely complete. The tower would be stored by the manufacturer until it could be painted and transported to Dunedin.</p>
<p>The radar transmitter, antenna and radome had been delivered, and were in secure storage in Dunedin.</p>
<p>Off-site manufacture of the radar out-buildings was mostly complete and delivery of those facilities was anticipated in early April.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The construction of the radar involves a large number of people and external services and equipment, which was simply not possible to bring together while only essential services are permitted to operate during the lockdown period,&rdquo; Mr Alder said.</p>
<p>The location and topography of the radar site (750m above sea level, northwest of Dunedin) meant it was not possible for on-site groundwork to proceed in the winter months, which would further delay the commencement of the work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this stage, we hope to have the radar operational later in the year,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;MetService acknowledge this is a significant setback for communities in the Otago region, but as we are all aware, these are totally unforeseen and unprecedented circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Otago radar is the largest capital project MetService is managing, and the organisation is committed to having the radar operable as soon as possible.
