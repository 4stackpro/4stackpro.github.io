London (CNN) A third of NHS staff and key workers who have been tested for coronavirus in the UK have returned positive results, new British government data shows.</p>
<p>According to figures released Monday, 16,888 people who fall into the category of &ldquo;key workers and their households,&rdquo; and who have shown symptoms or live with symptomatic people, have been tested. So far, 5,733 &ndash; or 34 percent &ndash; were confirmed to have the virus.</p>
<p>Health workers who are not symptomatic and do not live with people who are do not meet the UK&rsquo;s criteria for testing, so the number is not necessarily representative of all workers.</p>
<p>The government has been under intense pressure to ramp up testing for NHS workers and their families, and to improve their access to appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).</p>
<p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock has previously said that the ultimate goal is to provide testing to all NHS workers regardless of symptoms.</p>

Prime minister said ‘we’re going to have to remain vigilant’ until vaccine is found as infections climb across the country</p>
<p>Justin Trudeau has warned that Canada’s economic shutdown is likely to remain in place for weeks, as coronavirus infections continue to climb across the country.</p>
<p>“I know people are interested in when things will go back to normal. The reality is, it’s going to be weeks still,” the prime minister said on Tuesday. “It is going to be important to get our economy going – but we’re going to have to remain vigilant until such a time as a vaccine is found.”</p>
<p>Trudeau’s measured comments come in stark contrast to Donald Trump, who has grown increasingly frustrated with the protracted slowdown of the American economy and has clashed with state governors over deciding when measures will ease.</p>
<p>On Monday, the US president told reporters that his administration was “very close to completing a plan to open our country. Hopefully, even ahead of schedule.”</p>
<p>The Canadian economy has also ground a halt in recent weeks following advice from health officials to lock down much of the country, prompting the government to pass billions in temporary aid. Nearly 6 million Canadians have applied for the government’s relief measures, which provides C$2,000 (US$1,400) for four months.</p>
<p>But while health officials are optimistic that early action by the country’s provinces may have avoided crisis-level admissions to hospital seen in New York City and much of northern Italy, Trudeau nonetheless cautioned that much of the risk was still present.</p>
<p>“We must remain in this phase for some time to come,” he said. “We are not on the other side of the curve at this point. We’re not through this first wave of Covid-19.”</p>
<p>&lsquo;We’re a part of the spread&rsquo;: flight attendant&rsquo;s guilt over Covid-19 Read more</p>
<p>He also suggested that the border with the US would remain closed to all non-essential travel for weeks to come, calling it an “extremely important” measure of curbing the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, Canada had recorded more than 26,100 cases of the coronavirus and 823 deaths, many of which happened at long-term care facilities.</p>
<p>Trudeau extended his condolences to families that have lost loved ones in retirement homes.</p>
<p>“We recognize the tragic and terrible stories that have come out of long-term care homes. We know we need to do more.”

<h3 id="she-kept-a-diary-of-chinas-epidemic-now-she-faces-a-political-storm">She Kept a Diary of China’s Epidemic. Now She Faces a Political Storm.</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/14/world/14china-virus-diary/14china-virus-diary-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
As Wuhan was engulfed by the coronavirus, the Chinese author Fang Fang worked late into the night, writing a daily chronicle of life and death in her home city that gave rise to a global pandemic.</p>
<p>Her online diary, though sometimes censored, became vital reading for tens of millions of Chinese readers — a plain-spoken, spontaneous view into Wuhan residents’ fears, frustrations and hopes during their 11 weeks under lockdown in their homes.</p>
<p>Her account has recently drawn bitter condemnation from zealous Chinese nationalists who have called plans to publish a translation in English an effort to malign the government and undermine the heroic image of Wuhan.</p>
<p>Fang Fang, who uses her pen name rather than her birth name, Wang Fang, said that she did not want to be cast as either a cheerleader for the government, or as a reflexively embittered critic. She called herself a witness, highlighting the bravery of doctors, street cleaners and neighbors helping neighbors, while vowing to hold to account officials who let the virus spread.
