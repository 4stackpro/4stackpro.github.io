AS millions around the world self-isolate during the coronavirus pandemic, the Houseparty app has soared to immense popularity.</p>
<p>This genius video calling app lets you chat with pals, play games and more – but is it safe and can it be hacked?</p>
<p>The Houseparty app lets you hang out with pals in a virtual environment Credit: House Party</p>
<p>Is Houseparty safe?</p>
<p>On the whole, Houseparty appears to be largely safe to use.</p>
<p>The app has seen pranksters hopping into calls to cause havoc – but there are ways to get around this.</p>
<p>And the app does also ask for a large amount of information, which may worry the privacy-conscious.</p>
<p>However, with the right settings, you can have a great time on Houseparty.</p>
<p>Exactly how safe is the popular app? Credit: House Party</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s always worth remembering that no app or service is ever truly safe.</p>
<p>Even tech titans like Facebook can suffer hacks or leaks, so always be vigilant with your information online.</p>
<p>Houseparty hack rumours</p>
<p>In late March 2020, rumours began circulating that suggesting a major Houseparty hack.</p>
<p>Users flooded to Twitter reporting other accounts – like Spotify or PayPal – had been hijacked after downloading Houseparty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear if Houseparty is linked to these breaches, but the app&rsquo;s creators denied that a breach had taken place.</p>
<p>Houseparty is owned and operated by Epic Games, the major US firm behind hit games Fortnite and Gears of War.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We’ve found no evidence to suggest a link between Houseparty and the compromises of other unrelated accounts,&rdquo; an Epic Games spokesperson told The Sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a general rule, we suggest all users choose strong passwords when creating online accounts on any platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use a unique password for each account, and use a password generator or password manager to keep track of passwords, rather than using passwords that are short and simple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uploading all of your contacts</p>
<p>One of the big red flags for true privacy die-hards is the networking system.</p>
<p>When you sign up, you&rsquo;re asked to hand over your entire list of contacts – which will be stored on Houseparty servers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you choose to import your personal contacts from your mobile device we will access your personal contacts in order to identify Users that you may know that are using the Services and to provide other Users with suggestions for potential Connections based on mutual contacts,&rdquo; Houseparty&rsquo;s privacy policy explains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Note, however, that we will never share your phone number or the phone numbers of third parties in your Contacts with anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a shady tactic: it simply lets the app connect you with pals.</p>
<p>But in a world where hacks and leaks are rife, handing over contact info for everyone you know won&rsquo;t sit well with everyone.</p>
<p>The good news is that it&rsquo;s possible to entirely avoid handing over your contacts to Houseparty.</p>
<p>Just press Skip when prompted, and your contacts won&rsquo;t be uploaded.</p>
<p>The app still works fine without contacts, and you can add friends, join and host calls, play games and everything else you&rsquo;d normally do.</p>
<p>You can get Houseparty on a range of devices Credit: House Party</p>
<p>Strangers &lsquo;porn-bombing&rsquo; your calls</p>
<p>Porn-bombing isn&rsquo;t a problem specific to Houseparty – but it certainly exists.</p>
<p>Just like on Zoom, it&rsquo;s relatively easy to find and access another person&rsquo;s group call.</p>
<p>This has led to twisted pranksters hopping into video calls to show off pornographic content – or their own naked form.</p>
<p>As such, it&rsquo;s important to keep your room &ldquo;locked&rdquo; if you can help it.</p>
<p>And try to avoid adding anyone you don&rsquo;t know as a friend.</p>
<p>Unlocked rooms</p>
<p>Basically anyone can enter one of your video chats – unless you make it private.</p>
<p>The obvious answer to many of Houseparty&rsquo;s problems is simply to &ldquo;lock&rdquo; your rooms entirely.</p>
<p>You can do this by hitting the padlock button when you&rsquo;re in the app.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still possible to invite people to the call – but that&rsquo;s the only way for someone to join.</p>
<p>This has a downside: pals can&rsquo;t just hop into your room when they like if it&rsquo;s locked.</p>
<p>That does remove the &ldquo;house party&rdquo; vibe somewhat, but it&rsquo;s a small price to pay to avoid having a stranger wave his todger at you over the internet.</p>

Are Zoom and Houseparty safe? How the privacy and security of video meeting apps compare</p>
<p>Zoom and Houseparty offer a new way to remotely socialise with friends and family without leaving the house - but are they safe to use?</p>
<p>By Rhona Shennan Monday, 30th March 2020, 3:01 pm Updated Monday, 30th March 2020, 4:30 pm</p>
<p>With the majority of the country now spending their free time indoors, people are discovering new ways to socialise with friends and family.</p>
<p>That’s where video chatting apps like Zoom and Houseparty come in handy - but how do they compare and are they safe to use? Here’s what you should know.</p>
<p>What is Zoom?</p>
<p>Sign up to our daily newsletter The i newsletter cut through the noise Thanks for signing up! Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later. Submitting&hellip;</p>
<p>Zoom is a free video chatting app that has gained popularity in recent weeks, as demand for online social networking increases.</p>
<p>On a video call, you can see a thumbnail video of each participant. You can also share your screen, send text messages to the group and share files and images.</p>
<p>Zoom is available to download on your computer and on iPhone and Android devices.</p>
<p>Is Zoom safe to use?</p>
<p>There have been some concerns raised around the safety features of Zoom.</p>
<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) compiled a list of privacy issues that users should be aware of:</p>
<p>The host of a Zoom call has the ability to monitor the activities of the attendees in a call. “If attendees of a meeting do not have the Zoom video window in focus during a call where the host is screen-sharing, after 30 seconds the host can see indicators next to each participant’s name indicating that the Zoom window is not active,” the EFF explained.</p>
<p>If any users record any calls via Zoom, the administrators have access to the contents of that call - including video, audio, transcripts, chat files and access to sharing, analytics and cloud management.</p>
<p>During any meetings, administrators can see details like the operating system, IP address and location data of each of the participants.</p>
<p>There’s also the issue of ‘Zoombombing’, a term that refers to random people crashing various Zoom chats. Most Zoom meetings have a public link that, if clicked, allows anyone to join.</p>
<p>To make sure your Zoom call is limited to only the people invited to the chat, head to settings, scroll down to ‘screen sharing’ and under the ‘who can share?’ tab, click ‘host only’ before saving settings.</p>
<p>What is Houseparty?</p>
<p>Also growing quickly in popularity is video chatting app, Houseparty. It’s available for free to download on Android and iOS devices.</p>
<p>First launched in 2016, Houseparty was acquired by makers of Fortnite, Epic Games, in 2019.</p>
<p>Similar to Zoom, everyone on the call can be seen on-screen at the same time. Where Zoom is more professional and business orientated, Houseparty has a more fun approach.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re in a ‘room’ with your friends, you can play various games with up to eight people, such as Heads Up, Trivia and Quick Draw.</p>
<p>You can also leave ‘Facemails’ for friends, like a voicemail, but a video.</p>
<p>To make it easier to find friends, you can link your Houseparty account with your phone contacts and your social media accounts.</p>
<p>Is Houseparty safe to use?</p>
<p>According to Forbes, Houseparty has no obvious flaws or security problems after having cybersecurity and privacy researcher Luka Stefanko take a look at the app.</p>
<p>Stefanko told Forbes: “I analysed the app’s permissions useage and since the app provides video chats with your friends it is logical that request permissions are necessary. I haven’t found any shady misusing of [these permissions] by the app.</p>
<p>“The app doesn’t provide a lot of in-app options and settings, which creates less scenarios for exploiting security issues.”</p>
<p>While using the app though, you should be aware that unless you ‘lock the room’ that you and your friends are using to chat and play games, any of your other friends (or friends’ friends) can join.

<h3 id="the-best-chat-apps-for-your-coronavirus-quarantine--ranked">The best chat apps for your coronavirus quarantine – ranked!</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84d2b077e561c46728247fb9d861beba6d0a02d2/0_166_5000_3002/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=f63e9b900c020df5a3b195cebca7d3a2" alt="img">
Group video platforms are making a heroic rise from last resort to daily routine as people stay indoors. We tried five of the most popular ones out there</p>
<p>For those of us lucky enough to be home safe and healthy during the coronavirus pandemic, group video platforms are making a heroic rise from last resort to daily routine. For me, they’ve actually resulted in a busier social life than pre-coronavirus days.</p>
<p>As I made it through week three of the #StayHome life, I tried five of the most popular. Here’s my ranking, from worst to best.</p>
<p>5 Bunch</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Ankita Rao/The Guardian</p>
<p>What is it? A group video and games app that allows eight people.</p>
<p>Price: Free, extra for more games.</p>
<p>The experience: I tried this out with a couple of friends I have kept in touch with for five years across the various continents we’ve lived on. Colorful and splashy, it includes trivia, a drawing game, a billiards game and something called Mars Dash. It’s possible we’re all getting bleary-eyed and dull in our self-isolation, but my normally intelligent friends found the trivia, notably the obscure questions about the Cincinnati Reds, to be exceptionally difficult. The billiards game, meanwhile, is awkward to play and almost as boring as the real thing.</p>
<p>The app has a lot of bells and whistles – when you win a game, it sticks a crown on your head. But having to download some of the games the first time you play slows you down, and in these trying times, who has that kind of energy? In the end, the three of us just used it as a normal video chat and had a much better time.</p>
<p>Worth it? Perhaps when you’ve exhausted the other options.</p>
<p>Rating: 2/5</p>
<p>4 FaceTime</p>
<p>What is it? A mobile app native to iPhones, iPads and Mac desktops. Allows up to 32 people.</p>
<p>Price: Free (as long as you’re on the Apple train).</p>
<p>The experience: I was today years old when I learned you can FaceTime with 32 people, and honestly, I’m shocked. I have never been able to successfully FaceTime with more than three or four people, and I find it to be a perennial letdown. In fact, I sustained a long-distance relationship for one and a half years with my now husband on FaceTime, and it was probably the thing we fought about the most (try looking at the words “poor connection” and not making them a metaphor).</p>
<p>FaceTime is handy because it comes pre-installed if you have an iPhone, and you can use it internationally over a data connection, like WhatsApp. But I still think it’s best when there are only two people on the call.</p>
<p>Worth it? If you’re an Apple person, yes. If not, don’t buy an iPhone for this feature.</p>
<p>Rating: 3/5</p>
<p>3 Google Hangouts</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Ankita Rao/The Guardian</p>
<p>What is it? A video platform that allows 25 people and can be accessed through an app, Gmail or other Google accounts.</p>
<p>Price: Free.</p>
<p>The experience: I have spent a lot of my life on Google Hangouts, probably because it’s easy to access through Gmail, and I have my email open pretty much all the time. I’ve used it in the quarantine era to workshop short stories with my fiction writing group and it wasn’t all smooth sailing – connectivity issues seem to be the norm, and you’re almost always looking at one big face, rather than a grid, which doesn’t make it easy if you’re doing more collaborative activities.</p>
<p>My pro tip for Google Hangouts is: open it in a pop-out window (there’s a button to do so) rather than viewing it inside your inbox, so you’re not checking email while spending quality time with your loved ones, which I swear I didn’t do.</p>
<p>Worth it? Why not? It’s free and you probably already have it!</p>
<p>Rating: 3/5</p>
<p>2 Houseparty</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Ankita Rao/The Guardian</p>
<p>What is it? According to my college-going brother-in-law, this video app with integrated games used to be cool, stopped being cool, and then became cool in the last few weeks again. It allows up to eight people.</p>
<p>Price: Free, extra for more games.</p>
<p>The experience: I first tried Houseparty when my family used it to celebrate a birthday. It’s fairly easy to use after everyone signs up, though we found the interface a bit difficult to navigate at first, which meant we accidentally left “parties” and missed several rounds of a game. But once we got the hang of it we had a pretty chill time playing Heads Up! (which is like Apples to Apples), trivia, Quick Draw (akin to Pictionary) and Chips and Guac (sort of like Cards Against Humanity).</p>
<p>This app, however, is definitely geared towards millennials and Gen-Z. For example, references to Lil Uzi Vert and the term “dank” were lost on some of our older players, and there are definitely some not-kid-friendly cards. At one point my eight-year-old niece was challenged to complete a song lyric. The right answer was Hennessy, which she chose. Good for her, but as far as alcoholic brand awareness goes, not ideal!</p>
<p>Worth it? Yes, but treat it like an actual house party (the beer pong kind) because it’s not for everyone.</p>
<p>Rating: 4/5</p>
<p>1 Zoom</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Ankita Rao/The Guardian</p>
<p>What is it? Often used in business settings, Zoom allows up to 100 people on a call, and up to 500 if you pay for the expanded version.</p>
<p>Price: Free for one-on-one calls or up to 40 minutes with more than two people, then paid.</p>
<p>The experience: I never thought I would be excited to join a Zoom meeting, but this has become the go-to for many of my friends’ post-work hangouts. The ease with which many people can join is nice, and you can choose fun backgrounds and effects to take the vibe from work to play (like when you take off your blazer and put on a daring necklace for after-work drinks). Zoom also offers various layouts for how you see other people in the chat, so you can do a Brady Bunch tiled setup and avoid staring at yourself the whole time.</p>
<p>I’ve had the fewest connectivity issues on Zoom. But the time limit is annoying, so to use it longer you’ll need to find a friend who has access to the paid plan.</p>
<p>Worth it? It’s your best bet for a seamless group video chat and can accommodate large families like mine and wayward friends.</p>
<p>Rating: 4.5/5. I’m docking half a point because it should be free and unlimited right now.
