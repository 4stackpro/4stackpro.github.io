Your customers need help optimizing processes and finding easy-to-use solutions that help to compensate for limited resources.</p>
<p>Businesses and organizations have always looked for ways to increase productivity and cut costs so that they can improve the bottom line. With virtually all vertical markets now setting and working toward digital transformation goals, demand is growing for business process management (BPM) and business process automation (BPA) software to help them achieve those goals.</p>
<p>BPM and BPA solutions can increase a business’ competitiveness by optimizing processes, improving the quality of products and services and ultimately, improving customer experiences. BPM and BPA software can also give managers greater visibility into their teams’ activities and intervene with things get off track.</p>
<p>BPM vs. BPA</p>
<p>BPM and BPA are related, but they are different categories of business applications. TrustRadius describes BPM tools as the “juncture between IT and business departments at a company.” Examples of these tools are business process modeling and workflow management systems. BPM software also includes form generators, collaboration solutions, and analytics.</p>
<p>Mordor Intelligence research found that the value of the BPM market in 2019 was $3.38 billion, and it is expected to grow to $4.78 billion by 2025, a CAGR of 6.26 percent.</p>
<p>The Association for Intelligent Information Management (AIIM) explains that effective BPM often includes:</p>
<p>Focusing on outcomes, not tasks</p>
<p>Establishing and standardizing processes across the organization</p>
<p>Assigning ownership of processes</p>
<p>Facilitating continuous improvement of processes</p>
<p>Optimizing processes before you automate them</p>
<p>That last point is the key to clarifying the difference between business process management and business process automation. Business process management solutions focus on managing processes, but not necessarily automating them.</p>
<p>BPA, on the other hand, is all about automation. The Help Systems Blog lists examples of BPA, including software that automates processes such as file transfers, user provisioning during onboarding, report generation, ordering, claims, data entry, and event log monitoring.</p>
<p>Like BPM, the BPA market is projected to grow. Statista forecasts an increase in market value from $9.7 billion in 2019 to $12.7 billion in 2021.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Business Process as a Service (BPaaS) market is expected to grow to $20.22 billion by 2024 from $5.89 billion in 2018. MarketWatch explains that BPaaS has emerged as a cost-effective alternative for businesses that want to optimize business processes while maintaining the ability to focus on their core competencies. Additionally, BPaaS can add value by eliminating the need for multiple vendor relationships. MarketWatch points out that robotic process automation (RPA) and Internet of Things (IoT) are also factors in BPaaS growth.</p>
<p>What Your Clients Need</p>
<p>The first issue you should address with BPM and BPA solutions is the fact that people without formal education or experience may have to use them. In his blog on his study BPM Employment Opportunities in 2017, BPM expert Pedro Robledo stated that 66 percent of BPM positions could not be filled, and moving forward, the demand for BPM professionals is expected to grow by 14 percent through 2024. ISVs and software developers who can help people tasked with business process management, regardless of their education or level of expertise, will find an eager market.</p>
<p>Your clients also need your guidance. They may not be able to see past their comfort with longtime, manual processes so that they can consider moving to more efficient options. Your technical sales team or channel partners can help businesses create a roadmap that allows them to optimize processes and get the greatest value from your application.</p>
<p>They may even discover innovative BPM or BPA solutions that exceed their expectations for efficiency and productivity.

<p>BENGALURU: The $38-billion Indian BPM (business process management) industry – which provides finance, accounting, payroll, procurement, HR, supply chain, legal and other services to many of the biggest global companies – is facing huge challenges in keeping the services going. Many of its services, particularly those related to financial transactions that require high levels of security, can contractually only be delivered from offices.Despite several state governments having exempted critical services like these from the lockdown mandate, there are different rules on the ground. Company officials carrying official letter heads seeking passes in Gurgaon, one of India&rsquo;s biggest BPM hubs, have been beaten by cops and their windshields broken.A CXO in a BPM company, who did not want to be named, said his firm has got 124 circulars from different central and state government agencies over the last ten days on do’s and don’ts. “Unlike in the US where FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) is the nodal agency for emergency management, we have a number of different authorities issuing their own circulars, adding to the confusion. We need to clearly define what essential services mean, and make sure that all agencies, be it the Central government, district administration or police fully understand and support the continuation of these services,” he said.Even where work can be transitioned to homes, it’s not easy. Keshav Murugesh, group CEO of NYSE-listed WNS, says the performance of a home-based internet connection is typically not as good as the corporate-provisioned network, which poses a challenge for certain processes that are bandwidth intensive. WNS’s client-base includes insurance companies, banks and healthcare, and it deals with some extremely sensitive information, including personal data, health information and financial information.The fear of security risks is high. “For a Rs 4 crore business, I don’t want to be sued for Rs 40 crore,” said a CXO in a BPM firm, who did not want to be named. “In offices, we have zero tolerance towards using cellphones or even carrying a paper and pencil. If we shift work home, we&rsquo;re taking a big risk of credit card numbers being noted down or other ways in which data might be compromised.&ldquo;Some, with customer permissions, are shifting even this work home. Some are diverting work to centres in other countries. But in a global pandemic like this, even that’s not often viable. A BPM company had diverted calls from the Philippines, which has been badly affected by the virus, to South Africa. But on Friday, South Africa announced a lock-down and the calls were routed to India. “The volumes in India jumped 2x. Calls were queuing up and the wait time stretched to 12 minutes,” said the CXO.Rajiv Ahuja, president and global COO at NYSE-listed BPM firm Startek, says the definition of `business continuity plan’ (BCP) needs to change. Earlier, BCP largely meant having the ability to seamlessly move volume from one centre to the other, or from one geography to the other. “Going forward, it will include moving work out of offices to your living room,” he said.Fortunately, many clients are aware of the constraints around the world, and are relaxing service-level agreements in areas like first-call resolution, average speed of answer and abandon rate. If the service level has an 80/20 target, agents will have to answer 80% of calls within 20 seconds. Now many are fine if they take a little longer. Clients are also giving waivers on average handle time, the amount of time agents talk to customers. “WNS’s clients understand and acknowledge the unprecedented nature of this disruptive event and the fact that it may not be feasible to apply normal operating metrics in this situation,” Murugesh said.But without a doubt, revenues will no longer be what was previously anticipated. A week ago, Nasdaq-listed BPM firm EXL Services withdrew its 2020 annual revenue guidance, saying it’s difficult to say anything until “there is clarity on the duration and severity of the Covid-19 situation … ”
