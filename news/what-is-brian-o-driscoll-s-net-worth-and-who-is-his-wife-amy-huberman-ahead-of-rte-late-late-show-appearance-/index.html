IRISH rugby legend Brian O&rsquo;Driscoll will feature on this week&rsquo;s edition of the Late Late Show on RTE.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s everything you need to know about him:</p>
<p>2 Irish rugby legend Brian O&rsquo;Driscoll</p>
<p>Who is Brian O&rsquo;Driscoll and where is he from?</p>
<p>Brian O&rsquo;Driscoll is a retired rugby player who is from Dublin and is currently 41 years old.</p>
<p>He currently works as a Rugby analyst for BT Sport, ITV and Off The Ball.</p>
<p>What is Brian O&rsquo;Driscoll&rsquo;s net worth?</p>
<p>Brian O&rsquo;Driscoll&rsquo;s exact net worth is unknown but in 2018 profits at his firm ODM and Promotions Limited topped the €6.5 million mark.</p>
<p>Who is his wife Amy Huberman?</p>
<p>Brian O&rsquo;Driscoll is married to actress and writer Amy Huberman since the pair tied the knot in 2010 at Lough Rynn Castle in Co Leitrim.</p>
<p>They first met back in 2007 and Amy admitted she barely knew who O&rsquo;Driscoll was, telling the Irish Times: &ldquo;Art and sport are very different worlds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pair have two kids together; a daughter Sadie who was born in 2013 and son Billy who was born in 2014.</p>
<p>2 O&rsquo;Driscoll with wife Amy Huberman</p>
<p>Huberman played the role of Daisy in RTE&rsquo;s drama series &lsquo;The Clinic&rsquo; from 2003 until 2009.</p>
<p>She won an IFTA for Best Actress in a Film in 2010 for her performance in Rewind.</p>
<p>In 2018 she began writing and starring in the comedy series Finding Joy where she plays the leading character.</p>
<p>In 2009, Amy released her first book Hello Heartbreak. And four years later her second novel, I Wished For You, was published.</p>
<p>What success has Brian O&rsquo;Driscoll enjoyed in his rugby career?</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Driscoll starred for both Leinster and Ireland throughout his career and is regarded by many as one of the best rugby players of all time.</p>
<p>He began his international career for Ireland in 1999 in a defeat to Australia but announced his arrival to world rugby with a hat-trick of tries in a Six Nations victory over France in Paris the following year.</p>
<p>He captained Ireland for the first time in 2002 before being awarded it on a full time basis in 2003 after the retirement of Keith Wood.</p>

<p>HSE guidelines</p>
<p>Here are the HSE guidelines for understanding the symptoms and impact of coronavirus:</p>
<p>Symptoms of coronavirus</p>

<p>shortness of breath</p>
<p>breathing difficulties</p>
<p>fever (high temperature - 38 degrees Celsius or above) or chills</p>
<p>If you develop symptoms you will need to self-isolate and phone your GP. Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. The GP will assess you over the phone. If they think you need to be tested for coronavirus, they will arrange a test.</p>
<p>For people who get infected with coronavirus</p>
<p>80% will have mild illness and make a full recovery within a few weeks</p>
<p>14% will have a more severe illness</p>
<p>6% will have a critical illness</p>
<p>Read more about the symptoms and causes of coronavirus</p>
<p>Protect yourself and others from coronavirus</p>
<p>Coronavirus is spread in sneeze or cough droplets. To infect you, it has to get from an infected person&rsquo;s nose or mouth into your eyes, nose or mouth.</p>
<p>It’s important to wash your hands properly and often.</p>
<p>Follow this advice to protect yourself and others from coronavirus</p>
<p>Restricted movements and self-isolation</p>
<p>To help stop the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) you may need to either restrict your movements or self-isolate.</p>
<p>Restricted movements means avoiding contact with other people and social situations as much as possible. You will need to do this if you are a close contact of a confirmed case of coronavirus and you are still well.</p>
<p>Self-isolation means staying indoors and completely avoiding contact with other people. You will need to do this if you have symptoms of coronavirus.</p>
<p>Read more about restricted movements and self-isolation</p>
<p>Testing</p>
<p>Only people who have symptoms of coronavirus will be tested for the virus.</p>
<p>If you develop symptoms you will need to self-isolate until you can be tested. The people in your household will need to restrict their movements.</p>
<p>You will either have your test at a community test centre or in your home.</p>
<p>Read more about testing for coronavirus</p>
<p>Treatment</p>
<p>There is no specific treatment for coronavirus. But many of the symptoms of coronavirus can be treated at home. Take any medication you are already takingas usual, unless you are told not to by a healthcare professional.</p>
<p>Most people who catch coronavirus will experience mild symptoms. They should make a full recovery without needing to go to hospital.</p>
<p>If your symptoms get worse and you feel very unwell you may need to go to hospital.</p>
<p>Read more about treatment for coronavirus</p>
<p>At-risk groups and coronavirus</p>
<p>There are some groups of people who may be more at risk of serious illness if they catch coronavirus. But we do not think these groups have a higher risk of catching coronavirus. This is similar to other infections such as flu.</p>
<p>Read more about at-risk groups and coronavirus</p>
<p>Pregnancy and coronavirus</p>
<p>When you are pregnant, your body naturally weakens your immune system. This is to help your pregnancy continue successfully. It means that when you are pregnant you may pick up infections more easily.</p>
<p>All pregnant women should get the flu vaccine. This will protect you and your baby from the flu, not from coronavirus.</p>
<p>Read more about pregnancy and coronavirus</p>
<p>Children and coronavirus</p>
<p>Encourage your child to wash their hands regularly and properly.</p>
<p>Follow this advice to prevent your child from catching or spreading viral infections.</p>
<p>Read this for information on how to care for a child in self-isolation.</p>
<p>Travel and coronavirus</p>
<p>You will need to restrict your movements if you return to Ireland from any country.</p>

This Wednesday, Off The Ball are handing over the mic to the kids of Ireland for the first-ever OTB Kids Takeover.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, we&rsquo;re giving the stuck-at-home kids of Ireland a chance to interview some of the biggest stars in Irish sport, starting with none other than Irish rugby legend, Brian O&rsquo;Driscoll!</p>
<p>You can ask him anything&hellip; from what pyjamas he wears (Superman, obviously!) to what age is it acceptable to wear highlights in your hair?&hellip;</p>
<p>All you&rsquo;ve got to do is video your kids asking the question - just get them to introduce themselves first (very important!) - and WhatsApp it to 087 9 180 180.</p>
<p>Ideally, the videos are in landscape mode. We&rsquo;ll be recording with Brian on Wednesday so get them in as soon as possible.</p>
