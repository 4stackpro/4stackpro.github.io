It’s time to get those binoculars out, because the full moon on 8 April will be the biggest and brightest of 2020.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>This ‘supermoon’ won’t actually look pink – it’s named after the spring blossom of pink phlox flowers that usually accompanies April’s full moon in the US.</p>
<p>But it nonetheless presents an ideal opportunity to study the surface of our natural satellite.</p>
<p>Read more stargazing tips:</p>
<p>A full moon supermoon is defined as a full moon that coincides with the Moon being at (or within 90 per cent of) its closest point to the Earth (its ‘perigee’) as it follows its elliptical orbit around us.</p>
<p>April’s supermoon will be 221,851 miles (357,035km) away from Earth – compared to the average Moon-Earth distance of 238,855 miles (384,400km).</p>
<p>A supermoon can be up to 14 per cent bigger and 30 per cent brighter than a normal full moon. And if you miss this one, don’t worry: there’ll be another supermoon next month, on 7 May 2020. Technically, a new moon can also be a supermoon, but we don’t tend to mark these because we can’t see them!</p>
<p>The best time to study the Moon’s surface is actually not on the night of the full moon itself, as it can be too bright. Instead, pick a night a few days before or after the full moon to see the most detail.</p>
<p>The easiest features to spot with binoculars are the Moon’s craters – especially the younger ones, which tend to be brighter.</p>
<p>Read more about the Moon:</p>
<p>If you’re looking from the northern hemisphere, you’ll see a large, bright crater just to the left of the centre of the Moon’s surface. This is Copernicus, which is 93km-wide and thought to be around 800 million years old (relatively young by the Moon’s standards).</p>
<p>If you imagine a line of symmetry drawn vertically through the Moon’s disk, the Apollo 11 landing site, in the Sea of Tranquility, is pretty much where Copernicus would be reflected on the other side. Remember, if you’re looking from the southern hemisphere, the Moon will appear upside down compared to looking from the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>You should also be able to see two more distinctive craters with your binoculars – Aristarchus, which is to the left of Copernicus, and the huge Tycho crater at the very bottom. If you look closely enough you’ll see there are many more craters, each one evidence of the Moon’s billions of years of meteorite bombardment.

<h3 id="space-news-how-to-see-the-april-super-moon-2020-in-australia">Space news: How to see the April super-Moon 2020 in Australia</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-950913/0cafac664e71bc006c26aa32a9d4b23f26044231-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1024" alt="img">
While the kids are homeschooling, here’s a great mini science excursion for them from mother nature&hellip; and you don’t even need to venture very far.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Moon will put on a stunning display in the evening sky - starting at around 6 pm.</p>
<p>Officially known as the perigee-syzygy Moon, the ‘super pink Moon’ is when the full Moon is the exact opposite of the Sun, as well as at the closest position to Earth. Therefore, the Moon will look larger in the sky, especially when it rises in the east of the Australian sky.</p>
<p>In fact, the Moon will be at a distance away from Earth of only 356,907 kilometres.</p>
<p>Just remember to follow social distancing guidelines set-out in your local state.</p>
<p>Best time to watch</p>
<p>Depending on where you are in Australia, the best time to view the super-Moon is just after 11 pm on Wednesday.</p>
<p>However, the Moon will also look pretty stunning when it rises, and we’ve listed both times for your location below.</p>

<h3 id="the-april-2020-full-pink-moon-will-be-the-worst-for-these-zodiac-signs">The April 2020 Full Pink Moon Will Be The Worst For These Zodiac Signs</h3>
<p><img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/shutterstock/2020/4/3/09a12e03-bd8b-43df-b516-fd537afc23dc-shutterstock-1283220583.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=70&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces&amp;fm=jpg" alt="img">
Despite how gorgeous a full moon looks as it glows in the night sky, the experience can (and often does) get ugly. Astrologically speaking, a full moon is a moment of heightened vibrations and emotional intensity. The moon is the ruler of the subconscious, and when it reaches its fullest state, the mask comes off and everyone&rsquo;s true feelings are brought to the surface. In case you were wondering, these zodiac signs will have the worst April 2020 full pink moon — Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces — and for them, it could feel incredibly overwhelming. However, just because you have placements in any of the aforementioned signs does not mean this upcoming full moon is guaranteed to be a difficult experience. All it means is that this full moon is exerting more pressure on you than you may be used to. In fact, getting through it may be incredibly rewarding.</p>
<p>The full pink moon — which will be the biggest supermoon of the year — rises in beautiful, harmonious, and partnership-oriented Libra, bringing the focus toward how you compromise, cooperate, and function in relationships. It will also call attention to the way you bring balance to the extremes in your life. Forming a trine to both passionate Mars and romantic Venus, this full moon is accentuated by invigorating and luxurious energy, easing you through the experience. However, with ambitious Mars and inhibiting Saturn getting in each other&rsquo;s way, you may feel like you&rsquo;re stuck between a rock and a hard place. Luckily, Libra is a cardinal sign and it&rsquo;s all about pushing through even the most impossible situations.</p>
<p>Taking place on April 7 at 10:34 p.m. ET, the following zodiac signs will learn a thing or two about pushing through difficult dilemmas:</p>
<p>Cancer: There May Be Discomfort Surrounding Your Home Life</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s as if all the longstanding conflicts and inconveniences at home are flaring up all at once, Cancer. This full moon may be forcing you to face what&rsquo;s missing in your home environment. It&rsquo;s also encouraging you to solve the issues that may be lingering within your family dynamic. You&rsquo;re likely craving a feeling of comfort and safety, and if your present reality is not providing you with enough of it, it may be time to forge it yourself. If you&rsquo;ve been searching for an excuse to soothe and nurture your heart, this full moon is most definitely it.</p>
<p>Scorpio: You Could Be Feeling Overwhelmed With Emotion</p>
<p>Your subconscious is incredibly powerful under the energy of this full moon, Scorpio. However, while it is powerful, it can also feel incredibly overwhelming. It may be difficult for you to concentrate on the facts, because your emotional truth is bleeding through your external reality. There&rsquo;s no better time than now to ground yourself, take a few deep breaths, and meditate. Even though your fears and worries may be kicking in, you have all the power to overcome them with positivity. Your thoughts create your reality and this full moon proves that.</p>
<p>Pisces: Something Important To You May Be Coming To An End</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s never easy to pry your fingers away from something you don&rsquo;t want to let go of, Pisces. Whether it&rsquo;s a bad habit, a dead-end job, or a relationship that&rsquo;s going nowhere, this full moon wants you take stock of your life and make sure that you like where it&rsquo;s headed. If something doesn&rsquo;t feel right; if you find yourself wondering why you&rsquo;re trapped in a cycle of stagnancy, this full moon is the kick in the butt you need to finally put an end to it. However, transformation is easier said than done. It requires you to know when to say goodbye.
