<p>Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar has rejoined the medical register and offered to work shifts to help the health service during the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>Mr Varadkar worked as a hospital doctor and as a GP before he was elected to the Dáil (Irish Parliament).</p>
<p>He left the medical profession in 2013, a year before he was appointed minister for health.</p>
<p>But he re-registered as a doctor last month, the Irish Times reported.</p>
<p>The paper reported that Mr Varadkar is set to work weekly shifts in an area suited to his qualifications and will be &ldquo;helping out in phone assessments&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The move follows an appeal by the Irish Health Service Executive (HSE) for ex-health workers who had left the profession to register for work during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Mr Varadkar, 41, is the Dublin-born son of an Indian doctor and an Irish nurse.</p>
<p>In the Republic of Ireland, the deaths of a further 21 patients who had Covid-19 were confirmed on Sunday, bringing the total death toll there to 158.

<p><img src="https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4221362&amp;origw=1200" alt="img">
Something changed last week. The mood shifted. With the initial shock of the pandemic’s arrival on our shores dissipating, a grim numbness has taken hold. Alongside the remarkable collective spirit shown across Ireland, an unease about the scramble to confront the virus on multiple fronts is growing.</p>
<p>At one point, our caretaker Taoiseach dispensed with caring for a moment, standing at a podium and delivering a seemingly off-the-cuff remark. “I have heard stories of people who have asked their employers to lay them off because they’d be better off on the €350 payment than maybe working 20 hours a week for €11,” he said, “you know, do the maths yourself.” Leo Varadkar then caught himself, but decided on another little dig. “I would just say to anyone who’s thinking that, we are all in this together, and nobody in any walk of life should seek to be better off, or seek to make a profit out of this crisis.” We are all in this together? It didn’t sound like it in that moment.

<h3 id="a-super-duper-job-as-taoiseach--leo-varadkar-shares-letters-written-by-young-fans">‘A super-duper job as Taoiseach’ — Leo Varadkar shares letters written by young fans</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.extra.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/03124714/Leo-Varadkar-Letters-Feature.jpg" alt="img">
Leo Varadkar has shared a number of letters sent to him from children around the country thanking for him doing a ‘super-duper’ job as Taoiseach.</p>
<p>Taking to his Instagram stories, the Taoiseach explained that he was ‘catching up with correspondence’ as he shared a number of letters, cards and postcards sent to him from children around Ireland.</p>
<p>All of the letters praised his efforts during the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak and told the Taoiseach that they were washing their hands more often.</p>
<p>However, one letter offered Leo Varadkar a helping hand if he needed it.</p>
<p>One boy called Jack wrote: ‘Dear Leo, You are doing a great job. Let me know if you need any help.’</p>
<p>Another letter saw a little girl explaining to the Taoiseach and Minister for Health Simon Harris that she really missed going to school and seeing her friends.</p>
<p>‘I really miss my reading school,’ 10-year-old Robyn explained.</p>
<p>‘But I know that we must all stay at home, except you and the people like my mum who is a doctor.</p>
<p>‘Stay safe.’</p>
<p>Another young writer told Leo Varadkar that he was doing a great job as Taoiseach and encouraged him to keep up the good work in her handwritten letters.</p>
<p>‘I like science and maths,’ six-year-old Mia explained.</p>
<p>‘I’m writing to you to tell you that you are doing a super-duper job as Taoiseach.</p>
<p>‘Lots of love.’</p>
<p>Another piece of post featured an exercise from a workbook that encouraged kids to write to their journal buddy ‘who is making a difference in the world’.</p>
<p>They also showed off their artistic skills by drawing a fairly accurate portrait of Leo Varadkar.</p>
<p>The letters come just days after Leo Varadkar admitted that there may be a ‘few bumps along the road’ as Ireland attempts to flatten the curve.</p>
<p>He made the comments at the new isolation in Citywest as he accepted that people may be anxious as they await either tests or test results.
