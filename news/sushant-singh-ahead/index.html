<p>Indian actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead Sunday at his home in Mumbai. Police said he took his own life at age 34, but are investigating. Rajput debuted in Hindi cinema in 2013 in Kai Po Che!, and was awarded best actor (male) at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne in 2017 for his movie M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story. In that film, Rajput played Indian cricket star Mahendra Singh Dhoni.</p>
<p>He was also known for the role of Manav in the TV series Pavitra Rishta, which ran from 2009 to 2014. Rajput’s public relations team released a statement on behalf of the family. “It pains us to share that Sushant Singh Rajput is no longer with us. We request his fans to keep him in their thoughts and celebrate his life, and his work like they have done so far. We request the media to help us maintain privacy at this moment of grief,” the statement said. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted his condolences on Sunday.</p>
<p>“Sushant Singh Rajput…a bright young actor gone too soon. He excelled on TV and in films. His rise in the world of entertainment inspired many and he leaves behind several memorable performances. Shocked by his passing away. My thoughts are with his family and fans. Om Shanti.”

The curse of suicide has haunted the showbiz since time immemorial with the likes of iconic actor-director Guru Dutt, South star Shoba, Silk Smitha, actor Jiah Khan and now Bollywood star Sushant Singh Rajput giving up on life in the Indian film industry known for being harsh and demanding of its stars.</p>
<p>Known for films like &ldquo;Kai Po Che!&quot;, &ldquo;MS Dhoni: The Untold Story&rdquo;, &ldquo;Chhichhore&rdquo;, Rajput was found hanging at his Bandra home, the police said on Sunday. He was 34.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: Shocking suicides: Actors who stunned us with their sudden exits</p>
<p>Rajput&rsquo;s last screen appearance was Nitesh Tiwari&rsquo;s 2019 film Chhichhore. And his last social media post, dedicated to his late mother who died in 2002 when he was a young teen, was on June 3, a foretelling perhaps on what to come.</p>
<p>Rajput&rsquo;s sudden death comes days after his former manager, 28-year-old Disha Salian, ended her life by jumping from a high rise building on June 9.</p>
<p>Guru Dutt, known for black-and-white classics like &ldquo;Kaagaz Ke Phool&rdquo;, &ldquo;Baazi&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Pyaasa&rdquo;, was found dead on October 10, 1964 in his bed in his rented apartment at Pedder Road in erstwhile Bombay. He was 39. The filmmaker, whose real name was Vasanth Kumar Shivashankar Padukone, was said to have been mixing alcohol and sleeping pills.</p>
<p>Dutt&rsquo;s death may have been suicide or just an accidental overdose. His son, Arun Dutt, considered the death to be an accident.</p>
<p>Guru Dutt</p>
<p>South star Mahalakshmi Menon, best known by her stagename Shoba committed suicide at the age of 17. She got herself a National Award for Best Actress for the film Pasi and on May 1, 1980, she was found to have killed herself in her house in Chennai, then Madras. The manner of Shoba’s death, however, still remains cloaked in mystery.</p>
<p>Four years after Shoba died, her mother Prema who was also an actress too killed herself. KG George&rsquo;s 1983 film Lekhayude Maranam – Oru Flashback is said to be loosely based on her life.</p>
<p>Actor Vijaylakshmi, who reached the iconic status of a sex symbol in Tamil cinema during her time, as Silk Smitha died at the age of 33 as the result of a suspected suicide in 1996. She appeared in over 200 films, including &ldquo;Vandichakkaram&rdquo;, &ldquo;Moondru Mugam&rdquo;, a most sought after actor at a time was said to be neck deep in controversies.</p>
<p>Silk Smitha</p>
<p>She was immortalised on screen in the 2011 film &ldquo;The Dirty Picture&rdquo;, starring Vidya Balan as Silk. The Milan Luthria-directed film, which showed the highs and lows of the dancing star, was inspired by the actor&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Former Miss India and video jockey Nafisa Joseph was found hanging at her residence in Versova in 2004 at the age of 25.</p>
<p>Joseph, who won the Miss India title in 1997, had worked as a model and had been involved in activities related to animal rights.</p>
<p>In 2006, model-turned television actor Kuljeet Randhawa, known for starring in high-school drama &ldquo;Hip Hip Hurray!&quot;, suspense serial &ldquo;Kohinoor&rdquo; and crime thriller drama &ldquo;Special Squad&rdquo;, allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself in her single room apartment in suburban Juhu. She was 25.</p>
<p>Kunal Singh, best known for starring opposite actor Sonali Bendre in the 1999 Tamil romance film &ldquo;Kadhalar Dhinam&rdquo;, was found hanging from the ceiling fan in his Mumbai apartment in 2008. He was 30.</p>
<p>Jiah Khan</p>
<p>British-American actor Jiah Khan, best known for films like &ldquo;Nishabd&rdquo; with megastar Amitabh Bachchan and &ldquo;Ghajini&rdquo; with Aamir Khan, was found hanging at her Mumbai residence on June 3, 2013 by her mother Rabiya Khan. Khan was 25.</p>
<p>It was deemed a suicide and reconfirmed as a suicide in 2016 following an extensive investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and a hearing at the Bombay High Court.</p>
<p>Khan&rsquo;s mother blamed her boyfriend, actor Sooraj Pancholi, for her death. He was charged with abetting Khan&rsquo;s suicide. The case has not yet been settled.</p>
<p>Last year, actor Kushal Punjabi, who appeared in films such as &ldquo;Kaal&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lakshya&rdquo; as well as the reality show &ldquo;Fear Factor&rdquo;, was found hanging in his Bandra apartment. He was 42.</p>
<p>Punjabi, whose body was found by his parents in the wee hours of December 27, left behind a suicide note in which he said nobody should be held responsible for his death.

<p>&ldquo;Such a talented actor&hellip; may God give strength to his family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bollywood is still struggling to come to terms with the loss of two luminaries, Irrfan Khan and Rishi Kapoor, in April.</p>
<p>In early June, Wajid Khan, one of the top composers of Bollywood dance songs, died at the age of 42 after contracting coronavirus, according to media reports.</p>
<p>Celebrated filmmaker Basu Chatterjee passed away just a week ago. He was 90.</p>
<p>Born in Patna in the eastern state of Bihar, Rajput quit his studies in engineering to pursue a career in acting and dance.</p>
<p>He got his big break in Bollywood in 2013 with Kai Po Che, a film about cricket, love and politics that won acclaim at the Berlin film festival.</p>
<p>His most recent films were comedy-drama Chhichhore and action movie Drive, both released last year.</p>
<p>Rajput in 2016 told AFP of the emotional rollercoaster he went through filming the biopic of Indian cricket hero Dhoni, M S Dhoni: The Untold Story, which included retelling the death of the ex-skipper&rsquo;s former girlfriend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very difficult because, after we did the preparation, in my head I was him and everything that was happening was actually affecting me,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Mumbai: Following ‘Chhichhore’ actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s alleged suicide at his Bandra home in Mumbai, former Union Minister and Congress leader Milind Deora on Sunday opened up about having suicidal thoughts. Deora also mentioned five &ldquo;effective&rdquo; tools to deal with depression.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old actor’s alleged suicide has sent shockwaves rippling through the Hindi film industry.</p>
<p>Taking to Twitter, Deora shared &ldquo;effective coping tools&rdquo; while saying that “his own experience with suicidal thoughts, first as a teen &amp; even as an MP, taught me to live with the blues.”</p>
<p>Here are the five “coping tools” that he shared for people struggling with depression:</p>
<p>Reach out to your family, friends, colleagues and even acquaintances. You are more loved than you know. Overcome the stigma of mental health and seeking counselling. Depression transcends age, gender, economic strata or success. We are in a constant struggle with our inner demons. Never give in to them. Life is beautiful. Do not get caught up in the rate race. Choose music, food, travel, reading, your work, and loved ones. Do what makes you happy. Choose life. Most importantly, love yourself for who you are.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s death</p>
<p>In a shocking development, Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput had on Sunday alleged committed suicide at his Bandra residence in Mumbai.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has committed suicide. Mumbai Police is investigating. The police have not found any (suicide) note yet,&rdquo; Mumbai Police Spokesperson and Deputy Commissioner of Police Pranay Ashok had said.</p>
<p>One of his domestic helps had found the actor hanging by a bedsheet at his home.</p>
<p>Rajput hailed from Bihar. He rose to fame for his work in TV serials like &lsquo;Pavitra Rishta&rsquo;, Bollywood films &lsquo;Kai Po Chhe&rsquo;, &lsquo;M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story&rsquo;, &lsquo;Shuddh Desi Romance&rsquo;, &lsquo;Kedarnath&rsquo; and &lsquo;Chhichore&rsquo;, among others.</p>
<p>Bollywood, as well as social media, reacted with disbelief as soon as the news broke. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and several political leaders condoled the death of the Bollywood actor.
