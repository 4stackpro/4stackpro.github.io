Epidemiologist tells parliamentary committee even more stringent measures could ‘eliminate virus over next few weeks’</p>
<p>Tougher New Zealand rules on Covid-19 could set it apart as &lsquo;normal&rsquo; nation after lockdown</p>
<p>The New Zealand government’s swift move to lock down the country when there had been no deaths and only a few hundred cases of Covid-19 has drawn widespread praise - but an epidemiologist told a committee of lawmakers on Tuesday that the rules alone would not be enough to curb the virus’ spread.</p>
<p>“It’s like pressing the pause button on your device,” David Skegg, an emeritus professor of epidemiology at the University of Otago, said of the four-week national lockdown that began last Wednesday. He added that the sacrifices New Zealanders had made by staying at home, and the hit to the country’s economy of a national shutdown, would be “a terrible waste if we don’t pull out all the stops now.”</p>
<p>“We could effectively eliminate the virus over the next few weeks,” said Skegg, if officials were more ambitious in their testing and contact tracing measures during the lockdown. He added that the government should ensure the lockdown was as comprehensive as possible, and tighten restrictions on those in quarantine after arriving from overseas – some of whom have reported being allowed out of their isolation to buy groceries, which should not be allowed.</p>
<p>He urged the government to produce a single, clear document explaining its goal, which he said should be elimination of the virus.</p>

<p>“We could be one of the very few countries on earth to be functioning normally” after the lockdown, Skegg said, adding that most countries had ordered the public to stay at home “much too late”.</p>
<p>“We still have a window of opportunity but only if we lift our game quickly,” he said.</p>
<p>Skegg was speaking to a New Zealand parliamentary committee convened to hold government and public officials to account over their decisions on the Covid-19 pandemic. It is chaired by the leader of the opposition, Simon Bridges, and features MPs from every political party in parliament.</p>
<p>New Zealand has recorded 647 cases of coronavirus; 14 people are in hospital with the virus, including two in intensive care, and one person has died.</p>
<p>The number of those infected, Skegg told the committee, was “likely far higher” than the number of cases confirmed, and authorities had “really &hellip; no idea of the extent of community spread,” he said. Health officials say 1 to 2% of cases in New Zealand were contracted through community transmission, a rate that they expect to grow.</p>
<p>Skegg said that as testing had been “heavily skewed towards those returning from overseas,” it was unsurprising that the figures of community spread were so low.</p>

<p>Separately on Tuesday, the government released modelling that informed its decision to lock down the country, which showed as many as 14,000 New Zealanders could die if coronavirus got out of control, with more than 65% of the population infected. Those aged 60 and over were most at-risk.</p>
<p>New Zealand’s director general of health, Dr AshleyBloomfield, said extra PPE supplies were being rushed to workers on the frontline, many of whom have told MPs and the media they were running out of protective gear and felt unsafe doing their jobs.</p>
<p>On Tuesday a national state of emergency was extended for an additional seven days. The emergency declaration gives officials the power to requisition goods, close roads, and direct people to move from certain areas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the national airline carrier Air New Zealand said that 3,500 employees would be laid off in the coming months as it grapples with severe global travel curbs that has led to cancellation of nearly all its flights.</p>
<p>In an email to staff and customers, Greg Foran, the chief executive, said if domestic restrictions on travel continue beyond the planned 28 days, further layoffs may be required.</p>
<p>Foran said that in a year’s time he expects staffing levels to be 30% smaller than they are currently.

The national state of emergency has been extended to continue access to powers and resources needed to fight Covid-19, the Government says.</p>
<p>The state of emergency was initially declared at 12.51pm last week but only lasts for seven days at a time.</p>
<p>It applies to all of New Zealand including the Chatham Islands, Stewart Island and other inhabited islands and can be extended as many times as necessary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This includes ensuring our civil defence emergency management workers can carry out critical work during this time including managing roads, traffic and public places, issuing first aid, and providing food, shelter and accommodation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this global pandemic has also called on every New Zealander to make sacrifices in their daily lives and we thank them for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>‌</p>
<p>Being in a state of emergency also includes powers of requisition and closing roads, and stopping people from doing certain activities.</p>
<p>The Director of Civil Defence Emergency Management will give Henare advice on whether the State of National Emergency should be extended again.</p>
<p>This will include consideration of the current Covid-19 alert level, as alert-level decisions and State of Emergency decisions are complementary to each other, but one does not dictate the other.

<h3 id="nz-heading-for-extension-of-level-4-coronavirus-lockdown-kiwi-in-china-says">NZ heading for extension of level 4 coronavirus lockdown, Kiwi in China says</h3>

How did China contain the coronavirus, and what can the rest of the world learn from their response to the outbreak?</p>
<p>A New Zealander who spent two months under lockdown in China says Kiwis need to abandon any &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll be right&rdquo; attitude to the level four restrictions here.</p>
<p>Wellington lawyer jd Dallas was completely housebound in an apartment with his wife Li Xu and her mother in Shiyan, about 400km northwest of the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan.</p>
<p>People are now free to move about the city and even leave after enduring weeks of tougher restrictions than are now in place in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Gao Xiang/Xinhua via AP Medical workers discuss patients&rsquo; treatment near a Communist Party flag at the &ldquo;Wuhan Living Room&rdquo; temporary hospital in Wuhan in early February.</p>
<p>Dallas had heard about the hundreds of people who flocked to the capital&rsquo;s Oriental Parade on Sunday, which earned a rebuke from the Police Comissioner.</p>

</ul>
<p>In his view, an extension of the level four restrictions was inevitable unless people started taking it seriously and staying home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going to be in lockdown not for four weeks but for maybe eight or nine,&rdquo; he predicted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;she&rsquo;ll be right&rsquo; attitude … is going to work against the numbers coming down. It&rsquo;s not going to happen if people are still going to go out and associate with one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During much of his lockdown, Dallas was unable to leave the apartment building</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of self-discipline here [in China]. As soon as people say it&rsquo;s safe if you stay inside, people listen and comply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For two days, the front door of his building was even chained shut before sense prevailed and it was removed, he said.</p>
<p>After long weeks in lockdown watching sport, reading his Kindle and continuing his legal work, Dallas was eventually allowed out by the &ldquo;guardians&rdquo;, volunteers who patrolled the streets overseeing the restrictions.</p>
<p>First, it was into a small area where he could finally get some air: &ldquo;It was 84 steps one way and 84 return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When new cases began to fall in Shiyan, the movement restrictions were eased.</p>
<p>Dallas and his wife have now moved into a nearby apartment and his mother-in-law has been reunited with her husband, who was in a rest home during the lockdown.</p>
<p>KEVIN FRAYER/GETTY IMAGES Dallas found himself marooned in a city in the same province, Hubei, as Wuhan (pictured).</p>
<p>Asked how to maintain good relations with those in your bubble, Dallas urged people not to sweat minor grievances.</p>
<p>He also paid tribute to the support of the guardians, and the local Chinese Communist Party committee, which had delivered food parcels to his mother-in law&rsquo;s apartment during the lockdown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The help that we got from the guardians, or volunteers, whatever you like to call them, has been extraordinary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in all, we&rsquo;ve been really really fortunate, and the community spirit is amazing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as he and Li can find someone to look after their parents in Shiyan they will return to Zhuhai, where they have an apartment.</p>
<p>But they are reluctant to return to New Zealand under lockdown, given the comparative freedom of movement they now enjoy in China and the number of people in his home country appearing to flout restrictions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people here were much more compliant, and it&rsquo;s worked.&rdquo;
