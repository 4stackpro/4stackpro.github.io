The sexually charged cat-and-mouse game between a serial killer and an MI6 agent picks up anew in the S3 premiere of Killing Eve, as Jodie Comer&rsquo;s Villanelle and Sandra Oh&rsquo;s titular Eve regroup from the fallout of their last brutal encounter. There&rsquo;s probably only so much drama you can milk out of their dysfunctional obsession with each other after this season, but judging by the premiere episode, we&rsquo;re in for another wild ride.</p>
<p>(Spoilers for first two seasons below; mild spoilers for first S3 episode.)</p>
<p>Based on Luke Jennings&rsquo; series of thriller novellas, Codename Villanelle, Killing Eve features a self-described psychopathic killer for hire named Villanelle (Comer), who is so good at her job that she frankly starts to be a bit reckless with her assassinations, much to the consternation of her handler, Konstantin (Kim Bodnia). Her string of corpses catches the attention of an MI5 officer named Eve Polastri (Oh), who is obsessed with female killers and correctly guesses there is a new player among their ranks. Eve&rsquo;s insight earns her a spot on a top-secret MI6 team led by Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw).</p>
<p>The strangely perverse attraction the two women feel toward each other drives the dramatic tension in Killing Eve, leading to a sexually charged cat-and-mouse game where it&rsquo;s not entirely clear who is the predator and who is the prey. Each sees a bit of herself in the other—and that naturally causes serious conflict between Eve and her long-suffering husband, Niko (Owen McDonnell). The first season ended with a bona fide cliffhanger: when the two women finally meet, they curl up on Villanelle&rsquo;s bed for what the killer thinks will be a romantic interlude. Eve stabs her with a knife and flees, leaving Villanelle to bleed out (or so she thinks).</p>
<p>The second-season opener finds Villanelle in a Paris hospital as Eve unsuccessfully tries to find her, before being called back to London to rejoin her MI6 team to track a new female serial killer, nicknamed the Ghost. Eventually, Villanelle and Eve join forces to find out what tech-company heir Aaron Peel (Henry Lloyd-Hughes) has to do with the string of assassinations. And in the season finale, Villanelle manipulates Eve into making her first kill. When Eve is horrified rather than elated by the act—they are not, as Villanelle believes, entirely &ldquo;the same&rdquo;—the assassin takes her revenge, shooting Eve amid Roman ruins and leaving her for dead.</p>

<p>S2 opened right after Eve stabbed Villanelle and dealt with the immediate aftermath for both women. S3 jumps ahead by what appears to be several months. Eve is alive—how could she not be?—but it&rsquo;s unclear how she survived, other than being told she was lucky somebody found her among those Roman ruins when they did. Eve is now working in the kitchen of a dumpling eatery in London (the better to keep a low profile) and living on a shocking amount of junk food in her dismal flat. Her long-suffering math teacher husband Niko survived his encounter with Villanelle in S2 (although his fellow teacher, Gemma, did not). He is now an in-patient being treated for PTSD.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Villanelle is living the high life in a lavish Spanish villa, having latched onto a wealthy heiress. We first see her on their wedding day. Watching her try (and fail) to convey genuine emotion during the traditional wedding reception speeches—and the reactions of the puzzled guests, who sense something is off but can&rsquo;t quite pinpoint what that might be—is a high point of the episode. Villanelle&rsquo;s plans for a life of semi-retired luxury are upended by the appearance of Dasha (Harriet Walter), her former mentor from Russia. Konstantin is also back in the picture; he might just be Villanelle&rsquo;s longest relationship, to his continued peril.</p>
<p>The official S3 synopsis referred to &ldquo;a shocking and personal death&rdquo; that serves to set Eve and Villanelle on another collision course. That demise occurs at the end of the premiere episode. While it&rsquo;s certainly going to have major repercussions for several main characters, I&rsquo;m not sure one could consider it shocking—certainly not by Killing Eve standards.</p>
<p>The inability to shock is, frankly, the main challenge the show now faces. S1 was stellar, and it constantly shocked and astonished us, precisely because the twisted Eve/Villanelle dynamic was so surprising and fresh. S2 was very strong but not quite as unpredictably exhilarating, despite some very clever plot twists in the final few episodes. By now we&rsquo;ve been conditioned to expect those kinds of shocks, which paradoxically makes them less effective.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong—this first S3 episode has all the elements we&rsquo;ve loved about the series from the start, including even more spectacular outfits for Villanelle. She is just as outrageously unpredictable and charming (in a deadly psychopath way) as ever, thanks to a brilliant performance by Comer. You never want to take your eyes off her; no wonder Eve remains obsessed. I trust that the writers and new showrunner Suzanne Heathcote have plenty of exciting twists and suspenseful moments in store for us. But at some point, the basic premise—already wearing a bit thin—will run out of steam altogether. And then the real question becomes, where does the series go from there?</p>

<h3 id="killing-eve-series-three-massive-and-shocking-twists-in-store">Killing Eve series three: &lsquo;Massive&rsquo; and &lsquo;shocking&rsquo; twists in store</h3>
<p><img src="https://e3.365dm.com/20/03/1600x900/skynews-killing-eve-jodie-comer_4957419.jpg?20200328163344" alt="img">
Killing Eve’s latest series has kicked off, and according to one new cast member there are “massive” and “shocking” twists in store.</p>
<p>Gemma Whelan has joined the cast for season three, playing the wayward daughter of MI6 chief Carolyn Martens played by Fiona Shaw.</p>
<p>Image: Gemma Whelan says she was &lsquo;thrilled&rsquo; to be offered the part of Geraldine</p>
<p>The Game Of Thrones star told Radio Times she was &ldquo;completely thrilled&rdquo; to get the part of Geraldine, especially as she&rsquo;d had &ldquo;a few near-misses with a few jobs&rdquo; and so was &ldquo;feeling a bit despondent&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The 38-year-old says she was &ldquo;star-struck&rdquo; to join the female-led cast, which aside from Shaw includes Jodie Comer, Sandra Oh and another new addition, Dame Harriet Walter.</p>
<p>Speaking about surprises in store for the audience, Whelan said: &ldquo;When we did it at the read-through, there were audible gasps. It&rsquo;s quite shocking. I can&rsquo;t wait for people to see it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Describing her character as &ldquo;emotionally fluid&rdquo; and &ldquo;a bit of a drifter&rdquo;, Whelan called the spy drama the acme (pinnacle) of the acting world.</p>
<p>Shaw, who has starred in the show since the first series in 2018, also admits that when she took the role of Carolyn she felt intimidated by the responsibility.</p>
<p>Shaw told Radio Times: &ldquo;I was terrified of the piece. I wasn&rsquo;t sure whether it was funny or not funny. And, of course, it&rsquo;s both funny and not funny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lost a lot of sleep over her. I wasn&rsquo;t sure that allowing Carolyn to be so unknowable would hold in the audience&rsquo;s imagination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it more than holds. People want to be chasing her down the rabbit holes of her mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Describing the characters as both &ldquo;ruthless&rdquo; and &ldquo;charming&rdquo;, she says it&rsquo;s the element of surprise that keeps viewers hooked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like juggling: There&rsquo;s always a ball in the air. And you don&rsquo;t know where it&rsquo;s going to land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shaw also described the mother-daughter relationship between Carolyn and Geraldine in the show as &ldquo;really terrible&rdquo;, adding that the MI6 spy&rsquo;s focused mind is driven &ldquo;utterly insane&rdquo; by her emotional daughter.</p>
<p>:: Listen to the Backstage podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker</p>
<p>She said those scenes were particularly pleasurable to film with Whelan.</p>
<p>A new episode of Killing Eve will be available to view every Monday from 6am on iPlayer, and on BBC One at 9pm on Sunday evenings from Sunday 19 April.</p>
<p>Full interviews with both Whelan and Shaw can be found in Radio Times

Not long after the coronavirus lockdowns kicked off in March, the makers of hit show Killing Eve announced the early release of the new season, bringing MI6 agent Eve Polastri and psychopathic assassin Villanelle back into our lives two weeks ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of good news for fans of the sexy and darkly comic thriller – but three seasons in, is the show starting to lose some of its steam? That&rsquo;s one of the topics up for discussion among The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age&rsquo;s top TV critics in this week&rsquo;s episode of The Televisionaries podcast.</p>
<p>Assassin Villanelle, equal parts terrifying and stylish, is back for season three of Killing Eve. Credit:ABC</p>
<p>Host Louise Rugendyke is joined by Spectrum deputy editor Kylie Northover and culture editor-at-large Michael Idato and one thing is clear: they&rsquo;ve all invested plenty of time in the adventures of Polastri and Villanelle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I absolutely love this show, even though series two was a bit more of the same,&rdquo; says Northover. &ldquo;Series one, it just was amazing. It&rsquo;s the complete gender flip of the traditional cat-and-mouse spy caper. Everyone&rsquo;s a woman.&rdquo;
