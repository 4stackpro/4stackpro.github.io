FILE PHOTO - The logo of Alibaba Group is seen at the company&rsquo;s headquarters in Hangzhou</p>
<p>By Julie Zhu and Kane Wu</p>
<p>HONG KONG (Reuters) - Alibaba Group Holding Ltd &lt;BABA.N&gt; plans to buy at least 10% of Yunda Holding Co Ltd &lt;002120.SZ&gt;, marking the e-commerce giant&rsquo;s fifth investment in a large courier, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.</p>
<p>Alibaba is looking to buy the stake from Yunda&rsquo;s controlling shareholders - founding couple Nie Tengyun and Chen Liying - who own 52.19% of Yunda through their wholly owned firm Shanghai LuoJieSi Investment Management, said one of the people. At the current market price, the stake would be worth at least $790 million.</p>
<p>The other person said China&rsquo;s dominant e-commerce firm could go beyond 10% and buy up to 15% of Shenzhen-listed Yunda.</p>
<p>The people declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak with media.</p>
<p>Under Chinese regulations, a stake of over 5% in a domestically listed company can be sold at a discount of as much as 10% to the firm&rsquo;s share price on the last trading day prior to a deal.</p>
<p>Based on Monday&rsquo;s closing price, the deal could fetch at least $790 million, as Yunda has a market capitalization of about $8.78 billion.</p>
<p>Alibaba has already bought a small stake in Yunda which is below threshold for disclosure, said two other people with knowledge of the matter.</p>
<p>Alibaba declined to comment. Yunda did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The move would mark another step forward in Alibaba&rsquo;s efforts to gain a bigger say in China&rsquo;s fragmented but fast-growing express delivery industry.</p>
<p>Domestic delivery firms dispatched 63 billion parcels last year, up 24% from 2018, while revenue grew 23% year-on-year to 745 billion yuan ($104.95 billion), data from the State Post Bureau showed in January.</p>
<p>But many firms are under pressure to boost logistics infrastructure and upgrade services to maintain market share as online retail continues to grow and amid continued price competition.</p>
<p>Alibaba&rsquo;s move also comes one year after it took a 14.65% stake in another large express delivery firm, STO Express Co Ltd &lt;002468.SZ&gt;, through a 4.66 billion yuan deal.</p>
<p>STO&rsquo;s controlling shareholder later agreed to grant Alibaba an option to purchase another 31.25% stake in three years.</p>
<p>Before STO, Alibaba acquired minority stakes in three other large Chinese couriers - YTO Express Group Co Ltd &lt;600233.SS&gt;, Best Inc &lt;BEST.N&gt; and ZTO Express (Cayman) Inc &lt;ZTO.N&gt;.</p>
<p>Shanghai-based Yunda, which went public through a backdoor listing in 2016, is one of several couriers that work with Alibaba under Cainiao, the e-commerce firm&rsquo;s logistics division launched in 2013.</p>
<p>Cainiao provides software and shares data with warehouses, carriers and other logistics firms that help deliver packages to shoppers on Tmall and Taobao, Alibaba&rsquo;s largest e-commerce sites.</p>

<h3 id="chinese-e-commerce-giant-takes-aim-at-rival-leader-alibaba-in-cloud-as-china-market-heats-up">Chinese e-commerce giant takes aim at rival leader Alibaba in cloud as China market heats up</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105385658-1533776080662gettyimages-961627232.jpeg?v=1585531883" alt="img">
JD.com is one of the biggest e-commerce and logistics company in China. Zhang Peng | LightRocket | Getty Images</p>
<p>BEIJING – JD.com, a major Chinese e-commerce company, is looking to become the technology platform of choice for U.S. customers in a cloud computing market dominated by Alibaba. JD is best known in China for its claim to one-day or next-day delivery service, which helped drive a year-on-year increase of 18.6% to 362 million annual active customer accounts in 2019. Bernstein analysts also upgraded the stock to &ldquo;outperform&rdquo; on March 17, noting how JD&rsquo;s in-house logistics network kept operating throughout the Lunar New Year and the coronavirus&rsquo; hit to the economy. The Beijing-based company is now trying to build on that delivery and retail network with a new line of business in technology services, which covers logistics, advertising and cloud computing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From last year, our new clear direction at JD was to serve the company based on the foundation of supply chain (development),&rdquo; Bowen Zhou, chair of JD&rsquo;s technology committee and president of JD Cloud &amp; AI, said in an interview with CNBC on March 20. That&rsquo;s according to a CNBC translation of his Mandarin-language remarks. &ldquo;When we look at the direction of our future operations, technology and services is a core engine of growth,&rdquo; Zhou said. Development of those products and services will also help JD achieve its international goals. Zhou said JD aims to work with Fortune 500 companies that want to grow their operations in China, as well as help U.S. and European technology companies&rsquo; products enter China.</p>
<p>Competition in cloud</p>
<p>At least in cloud computing, it&rsquo;s a tough road ahead as JD isn&rsquo;t even close to having the same market share as Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu have, according to Canalys analysis published March 18. China is the world&rsquo;s second-largest market for cloud infrastructure services, of which Alibaba Cloud accounts for 46.4% of total spend, followed by Tencent Cloud at 18% and Baidu AI Cloud at 8.8%, as of the fourth quarter, the analysis showed. For all of last year, cloud infrastructure services spend in China increased 63.7% to top $10.7 billion, according to Canalys. But JD is seeing growth. Net revenues from services surged 43.6% in the fourth quarter to 20.97 billion yuan ($3 billion), faster than the 24.5% growth in the albeit far greater sum of 149.7 billion yuan in net product revenues.</p>
<p>Zhou stressed that for JD, technology services sold to clients are based on applications for the company&rsquo;s own operations, and cover artificial intelligence, big data, cloud, devices and &ldquo;exploration&rdquo; of new applications. JD Cloud and AI officially became one of the company&rsquo;s major business lines on March 5, joining JD Retail, JD Logistics and JD Digits, highlighting the emphasis this company is putting on the segment. JD Logistics broke even last year on an operating income basis, while JD Digits is a research and fintech arm that was spun-off in 2017. Some businesses are already betting on JD&rsquo;s mix of technology, retail and supply chain systems. JD.com is backed by technology giant Tencent, and the online retailer received a $550 million investment from Google in 2018. JD also has a strategic alliance with Walmart, which invested $500 million together with JD in the Chinese company&rsquo;s affiliate Dada, which runs an online fresh produce delivery platform. For Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu, their stakeholders are primarily investment firms, according to public records.</p>

<p>Covid-19 test kits donated by the Jack Ma Foundation and the Alibaba Foundation arrived in Vientiane at Wattay International Airport on Saturday March 28. They will be distributed across the country by the Ministry of Health of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR).</p>

<p>The donation to Laos is part of the two foundations’ pledge to deliver medical supplies to 10 Asian countries announced on March 21. These 10 countries include Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Maldives, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Collectively, the 10 nations will receive a total of 1.8 million masks, 210,000 test kits and 36,000 units of protective clothing, as well as essential medical equipment that include ventilators and forehead thermometers.</p>
<p>To date, the two Foundations have donated medical supplies to 23 Asian countries totaling 7.4 million masks; 485,000 test kits; 100,000 sets of protective clothing along with other medical equipment.</p>
<p>These donations are among a number of aid initiatives from the Jack Ma Foundation and Alibaba Foundation to support the areas of the world most affected by the Covid-19 crisis. This includes sourcing and delivering various types of medical supplies to countries and regions across Asia, North America, Latin America, Europe and Africa.</p>
<p>The Foundations have published and distributed a handbook detailing learnings and best practices from the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, for treating Covid-19 patients: <a href="https://covid-19.alibabacloud.com/">https://covid-19.alibabacloud.com/</a></p>
