<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>Rajput was found dead at his residence on Sunday morning and an investigation is ongoing, a spokesperson for the Mumbai police said, declining to give further details.</p>
<p>Local media reported that the actor had been found hanging from the ceiling of his home.</p>
<p>Rajput’s death sent shock waves through Bollywood and Indian sport, with tributes and condolences pouring in on social media.</p>
<p>“This is just so shocking. A wonderful talent. RIP Sushant,” actor Abhishek Bachchan said on Twitter.</p>
<p>Rajput started his acting career with television soap operas and made his Bollywood debut in 2013. He had acted in 10 films and his eleventh, an official remake of the Hollywood hit “The Fault in Our Stars,” is scheduled for release later this year.</p>

<p><img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-01/f747m5no_sushant-singh-rajput_625x300_15_January_19.jpg" alt="img">
Actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his Mumbai home.</p>
<p>Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his home in Mumbai, police said today, confirming his suicide. He was 34.</p>
<p>The popular actor was recently seen in the film &ldquo;Chhichhore&rdquo; - which dealt with the extreme pressure of college and competitive exams. His last appearance was in the Netflix film &ldquo;Drive&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput had put up a moving post just last week when his former manager Disha Salian was found dead. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s such devastating news,&rdquo; the actor had written on Instagram.</p>
<p>His last post on Instagram was dedicated to his mother, whose death in 2002 left him devastated. &ldquo;Blurred past evaporating from teardrops, unending dreams carving an arc of smile And a fleeting life, negotiating between the two,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>Rajput, who became a household name with his hit television series &ldquo;Pavitra Rishta&rdquo;, debuted in films in 2013 with the critically acclaimed &ldquo;Kai Po Che!&rdquo; based on Chetan Bhagat&rsquo;s bestselling book &ldquo;The Three Mistakes of My Life&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The movie catapulted Rajput into the big league and he went on to do several films. He also played MS Dhoni in the former skipper&rsquo;s biopic, for which he was nominated for film awards.</p>
<p>He played the eponymous role of Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! in the 2015 thriller. He had a supporting role in Aamir Khan&rsquo;s 2014 hit PK. In 2018, Rajput starred in Kedarnath opposite debutante Sara Ali Khan.</p>
<p>Rajput was born in Patna. He studied engineering and was a National Olympiad Winner in Physics.</p>
<p>He said in interviews that after his involvement in theatre and dance, he rarely had time for studies. He eventually dropped out of engineering just a year short of his degree to pursue an acting career.</p>
<p>A shell-shocked film industry posted tributes on Twitter. &ldquo;Honestly this news has left me shocked and speechless&hellip;I remember watching #SushantSinghRajput in Chhichhore and telling my friend Sajid, its producer how much I&rsquo;d enjoyed the film and wish I&rsquo;d been a part of it. Such a talented actor&hellip;may God give strength to his family,&rdquo; Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No No No!!!!! Horrible heartbreaking news of the passing of #SushantSinghRajput ! Shocking &amp; sad beyond words!!! Goodbye Sushant.. you were such a wonderful performer and had such a long long way to go! Don&rsquo;t know what you were going through but I&rsquo;m sorry for your suffering! Red heart (sic),&rdquo; Swara Bhaskar posted, condoling his death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The news of Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s death is truly sad. What a tragic loss Deepest condolences to his family &amp; loved ones. May his soul find eternal peace,&rdquo; actor Ajay Devgn wrote.</p>
<p>Abhishek Bachchan tweeted: &ldquo;This is just so shocking. A wonderful talent. RIP Sushant&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Last month, death of seasoned actors - Rishi Kapoor and Irrfan Khan - left the country in grief and shock.</p>

<p>Updated: Jun 15, 2020 10:43 IST</p>
<p>Actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death should be investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Jan Adhikar Party chief Pappu Yadav demanded on Monday.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput, who dropped out of an engineering college to pursue a career in Bollywood and delivered several hit films over the past decade, was found dead in his apartment in Mumbai on Sunday. He was 34.</p>
<p>Dattatreya Bargude, an assistant commissioner of Mumbai Police, confirmed the actor’s death and said that no “note” was found at his residence.</p>
<p>“I cannot imagine how this happened. I request the government to launch a CBI inquiry. I think there is a deep conspiracy behind his death. Sushant cannot commit suicide,” Pappu Yadav told reporters.</p>
<p>“I want a CBI inquiry in the matter. Sushant was a workaholic and good man, not the kind of person that would commit suicide. He rose from the bottom. Made Bihar proud. Now the state of Bihar is in mourning,” he added.</p>
<p>Yadav also claimed that it could be a case of homicide.</p>
<p>Rajput was born in Bihar’s capital of Patna and was the youngest of five children of a government employee. He completed his schooling in Delhi before securing a seat in an engineering college in the Capital in 2003.</p>
<p>He dropped out of the course to pursue acting professionally three years later and joined the Barry John Acting School.</p>
<p>The actor landed his first role in the Hindi serial, Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil, in 2008 but gained popularity the next year with his character in the popular soap, Pavitra Rishta.</p>
<p>He debuted in Bollywood in 2013 with the movie Kai Po Che!, adapted from a novel by Chetan Bhagat but became a household name with the success of MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, a biopic on the World Cup-winning Indian cricket captain, in 2016.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput was last seen in Nitesh Tiwari’s Chhichhore in 2019 and also acted in the thriller Drive that was released on Netflix the same year.</p>

<p>Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput committed suicide at his home in Mumbai. The actor was 34.</p>
<p>The news has sent shockwaves through the film industry and comes a few days after his former manager Disha Salian reportedly killed herself.</p>
<p>According to reports, the award-winning actor was found hanging from his ceiling in his Bandra residence in Mumbai.</p>

<p>Singh is a self-made star who has acted in films including &lsquo;Shudh Desi Romance&rsquo; and &lsquo;Chhichhore&rsquo;. His close friend in Dubai Raza Beig, CEO of Splash, expressed his deep shock.</p>
<p>“He was one of my closest friends. We have hung together in Dubai a lot. I still can’t believe that he has gone,” said Beig.</p>
<p>Singh was living alone in his residence during the lockdown. According to Mumbai Police, the reason for his suicide is yet to be confirmed and post mortem reports are awaited.</p>
<p>Singh Rajput was a self-made star who was a perfect antidote to the nepotism charge plaguing Bollywood.</p>
<p>The Patna-born outsider was a young actor who made it through merit alone. He didn’t have powerful industry connections, nor was he born into an acting dynasty, but rather chose to make a mark through a clutch of meaningful films. His career catalogue is lean but rich with content-driven films.</p>
<p>The actor, who made ripples in Bollywood through director Abhishek Kapoor’s ‘Kai Po Che!’, has acted in several good films including &lsquo;Detective Byomkesh Bakshi&rsquo; (2015) and &lsquo;MS Dhoni: The Untold Story&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput Image Credit: Instagram</p>
<p>Instead of being prolific and acting in myriad projects, Rajput belonged to the new breed of actor who believed in quality than quantity.</p>
<p>Apart from a few creative misfires like his recent Netflix film &lsquo;Drive&rsquo; and re-incarnation drama &lsquo;Raabta&rsquo;, the actor has always shone in lead hero roles.</p>
<p>CELEBS MOURN SINGH</p>
<p>Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar expressed his shock in a tweet. &ldquo;Honestly this news has left me shocked and speechless&hellip;I remember watching #SushantSinghRajput in Chhichhore and telling my friend Sajid, its producer how much I’d enjoyed the film and wish I’d been a part of it. Such a talented actor&hellip;may God give strength to his family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actor Aftab Shivdasani also tweeted his shock. &ldquo;Sushant nooo!! that’s the most disturbing news!!! Broken&hellip; so so so sad.. why? Why end such a young and beautiful life that too suicide??!! So so heartbroken..&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dancer Mukti Mohan tweeted: &ldquo;This is so unsettling&hellip;Can&rsquo;t believe such a happy dancing soul is not among us now. #SushantSinghRajput You rest in peace in your mother&rsquo;s lap my friend. Heartiest condolences to all his loved ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actor Mohammed Zeeshan Ayub tweeted: &ldquo;Still can’t believe the news&hellip;.so so so painful to hear this&hellip;can’t say anything&hellip;it’s to much to handle..just rest in peace my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The actor&rsquo;s last Instagram post, put up a week ago, was a tearful ode to his late mother.
