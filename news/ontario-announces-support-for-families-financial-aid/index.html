Ontario parents will be getting a one-time payment to help offset child care costs during the COVID-19 pandemic and while schools are closed.</p>
<p>The new Support for Families initiative will give parents $200 per child 0 to 12 years of age, and $250 for those 0 to 21 years of age with special needs.</p>
<p>“During this extraordinary time, we’re doing everything we can to support parents to keep everyone safe and ensure our children continue to learn and stay mentally active,” said Premier Ford. “This one-time funding will allow parents to access additional tools for our kids to use while at home and studying remotely. I want to remind everyone to stay at home and only go out if absolutely necessary. It’s the only way we are going to defeat this terrible virus.”</p>
<p>You can apply online here, but if you are already receiving Support for Parents payments through direct deposit you do not have to apply again.

<h3 id="51b-more-to-support-firms-families-as-workplaces-close-today">$5.1b more to support firms, families as workplaces close today</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/articles/2020/04/06/ycsafe060420_0.jpg?itok=VIa-f_Dr" alt="img">
An additional $5.1 billion will be set aside to save jobs and support businesses and families as Singapore heads for a month of heightened safe distancing measures to stem the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>In an unprecedented third round of support measures unveiled in Parliament yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat announced that the Government will subsidise 75 per cent of the first $4,600 of gross monthly wages for all 1.9 million local workers this month.</p>
<p>Many firms cannot operate at all or can do so only at a much reduced level in the coming weeks, he said, but stressed that they should still retain and pay their workers, with enhancements to the Jobs Support Scheme.</p>
<p>Two weeks back, the scheme entailed subsidising 25 per cent of the first $4,600 of wages for all local employees for nine months this year, with higher subsidy levels for firms in harder-hit sectors - 50 per cent for food services and 75 per cent for aviation and tourism.</p>
<p>Mr Heng said the first payout - to include the higher subsidy - will be brought forward from next month to this month, to help businesses meet pressing cash needs. Firms on Giro and PayNow will get the cash next week, and others will get it by cheque about a week later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The aim of this strong support is to directly reduce firms&rsquo; wage costs, to help them retain their workers,&rdquo; Mr Heng said. &ldquo;I expect firms to make use of this Jobs Support Scheme to continue paying your workers and refrain from putting workers on no-pay leave during this period or, worse, retrenching them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monthly foreign worker levy that firms have to pay will also be waived for April, while a levy rebate of $750 will be granted for each work permit or S Pass holder so that companies can resume operations quickly once the circuit breaker is lifted.</p>
<p>In addition, the eligibility criteria for the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme will be broadened to include those who also earn a small income from employment, as well as those who live in properties with an annual value of up to $21,000, instead of up to $13,000.</p>
<p>And all adult Singaporeans will receive a one-off cash handout of $600, instead of the $300 Care and Support payout that had been announced in the supplementary budget on March 26.</p>
<p>This payment will be credited directly into bank accounts by next Tuesday, while higher tiers of Care and Support payouts for those with lower income and the additional $300 payment for parents with at least one Singaporean child under 20 will be brought forward to June from August.</p>
<p>Mr Heng said that these and other forms of support come as the Government is acutely aware that the circuit breaker - which will see all schools and recreation venues closed, and dining-in at eateries halted - will be painful, even as it is essential to curb transmission of Covid-19. &ldquo;It will disrupt businesses and impact workers severely,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Many will be anxious about their jobs and families.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Related Story All firms to get 75% wage subsidy for local employees and foreign worker levy waived for April</p>
<p>But these tough decisions have to be made as an escalation in the outbreak would hit lives and livelihoods harder. &ldquo;We must take short-term pains, to avoid even sharper pain later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Today, the Minister for Law will introduce a Bill to compel property owners to pass on the Government&rsquo;s 100 per cent property tax rebate to tenants in full. For most, this works out to slightly more than one month of rent.</p>
<p>The Government will also further enhance financing support for enterprises, and increase its risk share of loans under several loan financing schemes from 80 to 90 per cent.</p>
<p>The additional measures necessitate a further draw on past reserves beyond the $17 billion sought in last month&rsquo;s supplementary budget, and Mr Heng said he has sought and obtained President Halimah Yacob&rsquo;s in-principle support to draw an additional $4 billion from the nation&rsquo;s reserves, while the remaining $1.1 billion will be funded from &ldquo;the fiscal space of this term of government&rdquo;.</p>
<p>President Halimah said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and DPM Heng discussed the severity and urgency of the situation with her last week. &ldquo;I agreed with them that we need to provide additional support quickly and decisively,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;We are entering a critical phase in our nation&rsquo;s fight against Covid-19.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The latest injection means Singapore is allocating about $60 billion to fight Covid-19 to date - of which $6.4 billion was set aside in the Feb 18 Unity Budget, and a further $48.4 billion in the March 26 Resilience Budget. Parliament will continue its debate on the additional spending today.

<h3 id="goodfoundation-receives-critical-funding-from-bank-of-america-to-support-low-income-families-in-new-york-city-during-the-covid-19-crisis">Good+Foundation Receives Critical Funding from Bank of America to Support Low-Income Families in New York City During the COVID-19 Crisis</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ErVpFVtr_HkSGxxgCwa24g--~B/aD0zNzt3PTQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usnewswire.com/de03834495e660d1493e30d7bd0f9554" alt="img">
Donation will Provide 2 Million Diapers Across All Five Boroughs</p>
<p>NEW YORK, April 6, 2020 /PRNewswire/ &ndash; Today, Good+Foundation , a leading nonprofit that works to dismantle multi-generational poverty by pairing donations of goods with innovative services, is humbled to announce a $300,000 commitment from Bank of America to help provide diapers to low-income families in New York City impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This generous financial donation will allow the organization to distribute approximately 2 million diapers through its network of 30 grantee partners across all five boroughs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good+Foundation has been our long-time partner and is cementing its place as a reliable resource New Yorkers can count on, especially in times of uncertainty and necessity,&rdquo; said Anne Walker, Bank of America New York City Market President. &ldquo;This partnership will support families in need across the city who are struggling to secure even the most basic supplies. As a mother of three, I understand the challenges of parenthood and offer my full support for supplying these vital resources. During this challenging time, it&rsquo;s essential that we all come together – as New Yorkers always do – to support and uplift one another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Founded in 2001, Good+ distributes $6 million worth of goods annually — including diapers, cribs, high chairs and strollers — through its network. Grantees include home visiting programs like Nurse-Family Partnership, family preservation programs including the Center for Family Representation and fatherhood programs like CUNY Fatherhood Academy, Forestdale Strong Fathers and STRIVE. By tying donations of goods to parental enrollment in programs, Good+ provided 30,000 families in 2019 with the tools they need to keep their children healthy while they work to reach their education, employment and personal goals. To date, Good+ has raised more than $500,000 for its Crisis Fund to support COVID-19 relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Good+Foundation team and I are so grateful for this remarkable gift and for Bank of America&rsquo;s longstanding support of our work,&rdquo; Good+ Founder and President Jessica Seinfeld said. &ldquo;For families struggling during this crisis, worrying about how to keep a baby in diapers adds yet another layer of stress. With this grant, we can help alleviate some of that anxiety while also providing an essential children&rsquo;s item.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For parents and caregivers of young children, diapers are an essential, expensive and unrelenting need, costing an average of $70-$80 per month for each child. Diapers cannot be secured through government programs like Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) or the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). A shortage of diapers in recent weeks means that diapers are now the top requested item from Good+ grantee partners.</p>
<p>Bank of America has been a funder of Good+Foundation since 2008. In addition to providing financial support, the bank has been a key source of volunteer support for the organization.</p>
<p>Good+ has a staff of eleven in NYC, and Bank of America volunteers are critical to helping the team process, sort and distribute donations to partners based on their clients&rsquo; real-time needs. Last year alone, Bank of America employees volunteered 368 hours of their time — the equivalent of 46 days of work — to Good+, bundling more than 9,000 children and adult garments as well as books, feeding items, toys and more.</p>

<p>About Good+Foundation: Good+Foundation is a leading national nonprofit that works to dismantle multi-generational poverty by pairing tangible goods with innovative services for low-income fathers, mothers and caregivers, creating an upward trajectory for the whole family. With an early focus on mothers and children, Good+ expanded programming in 2010 to strengthen support for non-custodial and formerly incarcerated fathers to address one of the root causes of cyclical poverty: father absence. Today, the organization partners with a national network of social service programs to pair goods – such as cribs, car seats and diapers – with life skills training, employment assistance, financial literacy, co-parenting classes and more. By giving fathers tools, dignity and opportunities to re-engage with their families, Good+ is improving outcomes for children.</p>
<p>Good+Foundation has offices and warehouses in New York City and Los Angeles. In 2019, 87 percent of expenses went directly back into Good+ programs. The organization has earned seven consecutive 4-star ratings on Charity Navigator – the highest rating possible – as well as a GuideStar Platinum Seal of Transparency and accreditation by the Better Business Bureau&rsquo;s Wise Giving Alliance for transparency, efficiency and operations.</p>
