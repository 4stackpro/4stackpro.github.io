<p>The Age and 60 Minutes on Sunday night revealed Mr Somyurek handed over thousands of dollars in secret cash drop-offs and used political advisers to stack branches with fake members in a bid to amass significant political power inside the party. The party&rsquo;s national president, former federal treasurer Wayne Swan, published a statement condemning Mr Somyurek&rsquo;s actions. Premier Daniel Andrews on Monday morning. Credit:Eddie Jim &ldquo;The conduct of Mr Somyurek is reprehensible and at odds with everything the ALP stands for,&rdquo; Mr Swan said. &ldquo;Noting that Mr Somyurek has now resigned his membership of the Victorian ALP, the national executive committee has taken further steps to ensure that there will never be a place for Mr Somyurek in the ALP ever again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loading At a lengthy and uncomfortable press conference on Monday morning, Mr Andrews rubbished Mr Somyurek&rsquo;s claim to have resigned from his job as small business and local government minister, with the Premier saying the right faction boss had been &ldquo;terminated&rdquo;. &ldquo;Mr Somyurek was not offered an opportunity to resign. He is not worthy of an opportunity to resign. He was sacked,&rdquo; Mr Andrews said. Mr Somyurek&rsquo;s close allies Marlene Kairouz and Robin Scott have kept their jobs in the ministry, after pleading their innocence to the Premier but also face investigations by police and the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission into their role in the use of taxpayer-funded political advisors to stack branches. Mr Andrews, flanked by his government’s parliamentary leadership team, said it was his decision that Mr Somyurek leave the ministry.</p>
<p>Mr Albanese was equally damning, saying that &ldquo;the comments that we saw last night were that of someone who was prepared to denigrate not just people who he saw as his opponents, but also people who were working with him&rdquo;. &ldquo;There were sexist comments, homophobic, they were completely inappropriate. &ldquo;In particular, I have to say that the comments about the minister responsible for taking action against violence against women in Victoria, Gabrielle Williams, was just breathtaking in the ignorance and in their inappropriateness.&rdquo; Anthony Albanese in Canberra on Monday. Credit:Alex Ellinghausen The Premier said that he and Mr Albanese had already discussed measures to clean up branch stacking in the party, but would not disclose any details of the plans, saying &ldquo;today is not the day&rdquo; to discuss it further. &ldquo;I have had numerous conversations with federal leader Anthony Albanese today, last night, and we will have more to say about those matters soon,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Mr Andrews said he had never undertaken branch stacking himself. &ldquo;I follow the party&rsquo;s rules. I&rsquo;m the leader of the party and I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve got much more to add to that,&rdquo; Mr Andrews said. Loading Replay Replay video Play video Play video He said he would seek to have Mr Somyurek expelled from the party and has referred the allegations to IBAC and the police. &ldquo;That letter has been sent and it is my expectation that the national executive will agree to terminate Mr Somyurek&rsquo;s membership of the Australian Labor Party,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Loading &ldquo;I have also instructed – asked – the Attorney-General to refer all of these matters as canvassed last night on the television and in various newspaper reports today to both Victoria Police and to IBAC and the Attorney-General has written in those terms and those referrals have been made.&rdquo; In a statement, Victoria Police said it would &ldquo;assess the complaint and work with IBAC to determine how best an investigation might proceed&rdquo;. Mr Somyurek issued a statement on Monday morning saying he offered his resignation to Mr Andrews, and will be calling for a police investigation into the covert recordings. Mr Somyurek also apologised for his disparaging and misogynistic remarks against Minister for Women Gabrielle Williams and the LGBTI community that were aired in The Age and 60 Minutes report.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will f&mdash;ing force her out of the ministry, that f&mdash;ing stupid bitch, when Andrews goes … She&rsquo;s a stupid, stupid moll,&rdquo; Mr Somyurek said of Ms Williams. &ldquo;I’m going to f&mdash;ing knock her f&mdash;ing head off. She’s a f&mdash;ing psycho bitch.&rdquo; Mr Andrews blasted Mr Somyurek’s &ldquo;wicked&rdquo; comments about Ms Williams. &ldquo;I have spoken to Gab a number of times since last night&rsquo;s TV program and I have reassured her of the support that I&rsquo;ve also provided to her, the regard I have always had for her and the fact that the things that were said about her are simply unacceptable, wicked comments and I simply will not tolerate those,&rdquo; Mr Andrews said. The Premier said he met with Mr Somyurek on Monday at 9am with the intention &ldquo;to essentially end his career as a minister and end his career as a member of the Australian Labor Party and therefore a member of my government&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He offered no defence of his actions. It was not a meeting where I was having a debate or discussion with him. I was simply doing him the courtesy of informing him in person of the decisions that I had taken,&rdquo; he said. In his statement, Mr Somyurek rejected accusations of branch stacking and said he would provide a &ldquo;rigorous defence&rdquo;. &ldquo;It is clear that I was taped and surveilled in a federal electorate office without my knowledge and that this material was published without any knowledge of its existence or my consent,&rdquo; Mr Somyurek said. &ldquo;However, I accept and take full responsibility for the fact that my language on a number of occasions was simply not appropriate. While Ms Williams and I have been at odds factionally for many years, I should not have used the language I did about her and I apologise to her unequivocally. &ldquo;Further, I am deeply sorry for language I used regarding highly valued and exceptional young people who are members of the LGBTI community. These comments have rightly cost me my job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loading Mr Andrews said Mr Scott and Ms Kairouz, close allies of Mr Somyurek within the party, had given him assurances that they had acted appropriately. Mr Andrews said he would not ask them to step aside while police and and the anti-corruption watchdog investigate. &ldquo;Victorians can have confidence that Victoria Police and IBAC will look at all of these matters thoroughly,&rdquo; he said. It will be Mr Somyurek’s decision whether he chooses to remain in the upper house as an independent member and Mr Andrews said he was not concerned by how Mr Somyurek might act in Parliament in future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just sacked the bloke. I don’t think [the Labor Party] will be sitting down and doing any deals with him, be really clear about that,&rdquo; Mr Andrews said. Danny Pearson, the member for Essendon, will take over Mr Somyurek’s portfolios of local government and small business. Federal MP Josh Burns, who Mr Somyurek claimed in leaked recordings relied on his factional support, condemned the embattled upper house MP. &ldquo;The behaviour and attitudes displayed in last night&rsquo;s 60 Minutes were shocking and they have no place in the Labor Party,&rdquo; Mr Burns posted on Twitter. &ldquo;Any person engaging in that kind of behaviour does not deserve to represent our party nor do they deserve to be a member of it. I fully support the actions taken today by Daniel Andrews and supported by Anthony Albanese.&rdquo;

The Victorian Coalition, and a former senior Labor senator, have called for factional powerbroker Adem Somyurek to face a police investigation and expulsion from the Labor Party if allegations of branch stacking and illegal conduct are proven.</p>
<p>The Age and 60 Minutes on Sunday night revealed Mr Somyurek, a Victorian cabinet minister, handed over thousands of dollars in secret cash drop-offs and used political advisers to stack branches with fake members in a bid to amass significant political power inside the Australian Labor Party.</p>
<p>Premier Daniel Andrews has said he will not be commenting on the scandal until Monday. But senior figures within the Labor Party were on Sunday night already calling for action.</p>
<p>The Victorian Opposition called on Mr Somyurek and others involved to stand down, pending an anti-corruption and police investigation.

By AAP 05:54</p>
<p>Australia&rsquo;s consumer watchdog has lost its appeal over a ruling that Kimberly-Clark hadn&rsquo;t misled customers when it said its wipes were flushable.</p>
<p>In its 2019 Federal Court lawsuit, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission contended the wipes weren&rsquo;t suitable to be flushed because they caused harm to sewerage.</p>
<p>A giant fatberg which was removed from a Melbourne sewer.</p>
<p>But at its appeal the ACCC argued it was sufficient if it established the wipes posed &ldquo;a real risk&rdquo; of harm or had the potential to cause harm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such case was run at trial. It cannot be run now,&rdquo; said Justices Nye Perram, Bernard Murphy and Thomas Thawley on Monday in dismissing the appeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A case that the KCFC wipes were unsuitable because they posed a real risk of harm is quite different to one based on the wipes causing harm.</p>
<p>A giant &ldquo;fatberg&rdquo; – a mass of hardened fat, oil and baby wipes measuring 64 metres long in England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It raises quite different questions, in particular what level of risk would need to be established before it could be said that the wipes were unsuitable for flushing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kimberly-Clark would have run its case differently, possibly calling evidence comparing the degree of risk posed by its wipes with those of other products, including toilet paper.</p>
<p>Justice Jacqueline Gleeson in 2019 said she was not persuaded the ACCC&rsquo;s evidence was sufficient to support a conclusion that the wipes were unsuitable for flushing.</p>
<p>The ACCC is carefully considering the judgment, it said.
