<p>Kenyans in China are asking the government to assist them return home after a surge in racial discrimination against Africans in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Many Kenyans living in China have been kicked out of their houses and now live on the streets, depending on well-wishers for food and other basic requirements.</p>
<p>Chinese police are reportedly evicting them forcibly and taking away their legal documents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing they ask for are the documentations. Some police allow you to keep the passport, but others just take it,&rdquo; said a Kenyan woman in China whose identity we have concealed.</p>
<p>The situation in the country is so bad that posters have been put in malls and restaurants asking Africans to stay away.</p>
<p>Kenyans, especially those in Guangdong, have been hit hard and live in constant fear because of the the ill-treatment they are facing yet they have not committed any crime.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am frustrated and angry because of what we are going through. It is sad that the government is quiet about this. I live in fear waiting for the knock that could send me to the streets,&rdquo; said the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can barely step out to get even the most basic things. I cannot dare because I will be exposing myself to forceful eviction,&rdquo; she adds.</p>
<p>The Kenyans in China have reached out to Kenyan embassy officials for help but their pleas have been ignored.</p>
<p>They are now asking the Kenyan government to help in facilitating their return home to avoid the discrimination by Chinese nationals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are discriminated against because they think that we are asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus. Some just hate on us for no reason. Honestly, we need to come back home,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kenyans have reacted angrily to reports of persecution of their countrymen and women in China.</p>
<p>Through social media, many accused China of pointing fingers at others for a problem ‘of their own making’.</p>
<p>Many Kenyans have accused China of turning a blind eye to humiliation meted on innocent Africans and have called on other countries to rise up against this brutality.</p>
<p>Social media was awash with posts calling attention to the issue with the hashtags #ChinaMustExplain and #BringKenyansInChinaHome trending.</p>
<p>Narok Senator Ledama ole Kina called for Africa to unite against the coronavirus-fuelled xenophobia in China.</p>
<p>“Yes we are corrupt and broke but we are not children of a lesser God and neither are we stupid,” he said.</p>
<p>Others turned their anger on the Kenyan Embassy in China, accusing Ambassador Sarah Serem of ignoring the plight of fellow citizens.</p>
<p>“What&rsquo;s more infuriating than the inhuman treatment of Kenyans in China is to think that the only place where they&rsquo;d hoped to find solace, the embassy, brazenly turned a deaf ear to them. Tell me why Sarah Serem should continue bearing the title Ambassador” said twitter user @kimathiwamuthee.</p>
<p>There is still no communication from the Kenyan Embassy on the situation.</p>
<p>However, in a rejoinder, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson at the Chinese Embassy in Nairobi, Hong Lei, stressed that they treat all foreign nationals equally in China.

<h3 id="its-heartbreaking-to-see-kenyans-being-discriminated-in-china">It&rsquo;s heartbreaking to see Kenyans being discriminated in China</h3>
<p><img src="https://netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/84a74f669dcee2bb.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reports emerged about mistreatment of Kenyans in China on allegations of being the source of second wave of coronavirus infections</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement indicating it had contacted Chinese authorities to investigate the matter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Governor Alfred Mutua challenged President Uhuru Kenyatta to call out his Chinese counterpart over the alleged mistreatment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to Mutua, despite the billions of debts that Kenya owed China, no citizen whether foreign or local should be treated in that manner</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Machakos governor Alfred Mutua has challenged President Uhuru Kenyatta to come out boldly and call out his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, over alleged mistreatment of Kenyans in China.</p>
<p>This was after reports emerged that Africans in China were being kicked out of rental apartments on allegations that they were spreading a second wave of coronavirus infections.</p>

<p>Source: Facebook</p>
<p>READ ALSO: Indian officials force tourists to write apology 500 times for defying lockdown: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Maendeleo Chap Chap party leader said whatever was happening in China was pure racism which should be condemned irrespective of how much money China has loaned Kenya.</p>
<p>In a Twitter post on Monday, April 13, Mutua said the kind of mistreatment that was being meted against Africans was unfair and illogical considering coronavirus broke out in China and not in Africa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very heartbreaking to see black people being discriminated in China. I have not seen any white or Chinese or Arabians being chased out of their rented apartment, it&rsquo;s only Africans and this is nothing but racism,&rdquo; said Mutua.</p>
<p>READ ALSO: Coronavirus: Boris Johnson aondoka hospitalini, amesema &lsquo;hali ingeweza kwenda mrama&rsquo;</p>
<p>According to Mutua, it was high time the government brought back Kenyans in China to avoid unnecessary mistreatment.</p>
<p>He said it was very inhumane for Chinese landlords to kick out African tenants to spend the night in the streets, especially during the winter period.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expected the president to call his counterpart in China to ask him what is going on, police should be on the streets in China trying to contain this kind of mistreatment against Africans,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>READ ALSO: Siaya: Uproar after man who succumbed to COVID-19 is buried in shallow grave at night</p>
<p>The matter has since triggered an uproar from both local leaders and others across the globe who are demanding answers from the Chinese government.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement saying it had received the complaints and was engaging Chinese authorities to investigate the incidents for appropriate action.</p>

<h3 id="kenyans-mistreated-in-china-cs-omamo-under-fire-over-silence">Kenyans Mistreated in China: CS Omamo Under Fire Over Silence</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/files/styles/article_style/public/images/media/Raychelle%20Omamo.jpeg?itok=ljT4x0pN" alt="img">
Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Raychelle Omamo, is under fire following her silence regarding the apparent recent events in China that has seen Kenyans thrown out to the streets by landlords in the host nation.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Kenyans have taken to social media to question her whereabouts including prominent lawyer Ahmednasir Abdullahi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m disappointed with the letters CS Omamo is writing left and right on the inhuman treatment of Kenyans in China. She should have the guts (or does she first need permission from H.E [Uhuru Kenyatta] to summon the Chinese Ambassador in Nairobi to the Foreign Office and officially protest,&rdquo; he stated in a tweet shared on Sunday, April 12.</p>
<p>Chinese Ambassador to Kenya Wu Peng (Left) and Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Raychelle Omamo pose for a photo on March 10, 2020. They exchanged views on China-Kenya relations and the Covid-19 outbreak. File</p>
<p>He then shared a video of Nigerian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Geoffrey Onyeama, during a meeting with his Chinese officials in which he demands swift action. The lawyer demanded a similar meeting to be held by CS Omamo in order to bring an end to the suffering currently being endured by Africans in certain towns in China.</p>
<p>Kenyans.co.ke spoke to a number of Kenyans stuck in China who are trying to find their way through the predicament facing them, with one residing in Guangzhou revealing that she was in quarantine, where food was being rationed, adding that the conditions were unbearable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They took me into quarantine yesterday, Thursday, April 9, but the food is just noodles. They said we stay here for 14 days. So after the 14 days, we don&rsquo;t know what will happen next. We need to be home before it gets worse for us,&rdquo; she pleaded.</p>
<p>Photos of Africans sleeping on cold concrete streets in China have since gone viral, sparking a diplomatic nightmare, with Kenyans demanding swift action by the government to bring its citizens home.</p>
<p>Another woman who spoke exclusively to Kenyans.co.ke, revealed that she was living in fear for her life after reports surfaced alleging that Africans may be a target of a potential vaccine testing in China.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are only testing the blacks. This is why I&rsquo;m gripped with fear after being locked up here with police surrounding the building. They were reports that they want to test the vaccine on us. Maybe that&rsquo;s why we are here. Oh my God!,&rdquo; she narrated.</p>
<p>The tense situation escalated even further on April 10, when residents of Migori invaded a gold mine over land grabbing claims, forcing a government administrator and a Chinese investor to flee.</p>
<p>According to reports, the Chinese investor fled by jumping over a mabati fence as armed police watched helplessly.</p>
<p>The residents then claimed that the land in which the Chinese national dug the mine was grabbed from locals.</p>
<p>CS Omamo was last seen n public on April 7 when she received a cheque of Ksh10 Million; a donation from the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) staff, towards the Covid-19 Emergency Respond Fund.</p>
<p>Prior to that, she hosted the Chinese Ambassador to Kenya Wu Peng, on March 10, during a courtesy call, going on to reveal that they exchanged views on China-Kenya relations and the Covid-19 outbreak.
