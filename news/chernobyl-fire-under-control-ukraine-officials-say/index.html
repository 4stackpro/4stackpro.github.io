<p>A fire that threatened the abandoned Chernobyl nuclear plant has been contained, Ukrainian authorities said.</p>
<p>Emergency services said on Tuesday there were still some &ldquo;smouldering&rdquo; parts of the forest floor, but there was &ldquo;no open fire&rdquo; left.</p>
<p>There had been fears the blaze could threaten the site of the 1986 nuclear catastrophe.</p>
<p>Greenpeace Russia said on Monday one blaze was just one kilometre from the plant itself.</p>
<p>Though fires are common in the area, Greenpeace said this was the worst in decades. Police have arrested a 27-year-old man and accused him of starting the blaze.</p>
<p>Ukraine&rsquo;s President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was &ldquo;carefully monitoring&rdquo; the situation and praised emergency services for their &ldquo;courage&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He tweeted that &ldquo;society needs to know the truth and to be safe&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In 1986, the former nuclear plant suffered a catastrophic meltdown that spread radioactive fallout across Europe.</p>
<p>Chernobyl and the nearby town of Pripyat have been abandoned ever since, although they have attracted large numbers of tourists in recent years.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the situation?</p>
<p>Hundreds of firefighters as well as planes and helicopters were sent to tackle the fire.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, state emergency services announced the blaze had largely been contained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no open fire,&rdquo; a statement said, adding that there was &ldquo;a slight smouldering of the forest floor&rdquo; in separate places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are trying to stop the spread of several hot spots of fire,&rdquo; said Volodymyr Demchuk, a senior official from Ukraine&rsquo;s emergency service.</p>
<p>Aircraft dropped 538 tons of water on the blaze on Monday, the statement said. Background radiation in and around the capital Kyiv &ldquo;is within normal limits&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Over the past week there have been concerns the fire could threaten the plant and even spread radioactive chemicals.</p>
<p>Sergiy Zibtsev, head of the Regional Eastern European Fire Monitoring Center, told AFP news agency that the fire had become &ldquo;super-huge&rdquo; and &ldquo;unpredictable&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Local tour operator Yaroslav Emelianenko said on Monday that one fire had reached Pripyat and was even just 2km (1.24 miles) from where the most dangerous waste from the plant was stored. &ldquo;The situation is critical,&rdquo; he wrote on Facebook.</p>
<p>In 2018 more than 70,000 people visited the town. Last year that figure was even higher, after the success of an HBO mini-series about the disaster.</p>
<p>Chernobyl nuclear power station and Pripyat have been abandoned since 1986, when the plant’s No. 4 reactor blew up.</p>
<p>People are forbidden from living within 30km (18 miles) of the power station.</p>
<p>Chernobyl continued to generate power until the plant&rsquo;s last operational reactor was finally closed in 2000. A giant shield built to cover the reactor was installed in November 2016, replacing a decaying sarcophagus built in 1986 to seal in nuclear materials.</p>

<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png" alt="img">
KYIV, Ukraine — Forest fires raged Tuesday in the contaminated area near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, but officials insisted there is no radiation threat.</p>
<p>Hundreds of firefighters backed by aircraft have been battling several forest fires around Chernobyl since last week. They managed to contain the initial blazes, but new fires are now raging close to the decommissioned plant.</p>
<p>Volodymyr Demchuk of Ukraine&rsquo;s state Emergencies Service insisted that the situation is under control.</p>
<p>“There is no threat to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, waste fuel storage or other critical facilities,” he said.

<p>April 14 (UPI) &ndash; The Ukrainian government said Tuesday a large fire burning in the &ldquo;exclusion zone&rdquo; near the Chernobyl nuclear power station is under control, but some witnesses say that doesn&rsquo;t appear to be true.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian interior ministry said there &ldquo;were no open fires&rdquo; remaining within the 18-mile zone that surrounds the plant, which was the site of one of the world&rsquo;s worst nuclear accidents in 1986.</p>
<p>Interior ministry officials said crews had dumped 500 tons of water onto the fire and there&rsquo;s only &ldquo;a slight smoldering of the forest floor with separate cells&rdquo; remaining. They said 500 people and 110 vehicles were sent into the exclusion zone to fight the blaze.</p>
<p>Background radiation in Kiev and the surrounding region is within normal limits, the ministry added.</p>

<p>Ukraine&rsquo;s State Agency on Exclusion Zone Management said in a Facebook post that fires were still burning in the Rossokha village, a scrapyard containing the irradiated emergency vehicles that responded to the accident.</p>
<p>A Chernobyl tour operator, however, said the fire is still out of control and has reached the abandoned city of Pripyat, less than two miles from a site where contaminated debris from the accident is stored.</p>
<p>The situation has raised some concern that radiation still contained the exclusion zone could be spread by the fire, which started on April 4.</p>
<p>The No. 4 reactor at Chernobyl exploded and experienced a core meltdown following a safety test at the plant on April 26, 1986. It&rsquo;s one of only two nuclear disasters rated at seven, the maximum level, on the International Nuclear Event Scale. More than 77,000 square miles in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, which in 1986 were all part of the Soviet Union, were seriously contaminated by radiation.</p>
<p>The disaster directly killed less than 50 people, mainly emergency first responders known as the Chernobyl &ldquo;liquidators,&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s estimated that as many as 60,000 have died over the last three decades due to ailments related to the radiation fallout. Officials concluded design flaws at the plant contributed to the accident.</p>
<p>Scientists have said the area around the Chernobyl plant won&rsquo;t be habitable for 20,000 years.
