<p>A fire that threatened the abandoned Chernobyl nuclear plant has been contained, Ukrainian authorities said.</p>
<p>Emergency services said on Tuesday there were still some &ldquo;smouldering&rdquo; parts of the forest floor, but there was &ldquo;no open fire&rdquo; left.</p>
<p>There had been fears the blaze could threaten the site of the 1986 nuclear catastrophe.</p>
<p>Greenpeace Russia said on Monday one blaze was just one kilometre from the plant itself.</p>
<p>Though fires are common in the area, Greenpeace said this was the worst in decades. Police have arrested a 27-year-old man and accused him of starting the blaze.</p>
<p>Ukraine&rsquo;s President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was &ldquo;carefully monitoring&rdquo; the situation and praised emergency services for their &ldquo;courage&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He tweeted that &ldquo;society needs to know the truth and to be safe&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In 1986, the former nuclear plant suffered a catastrophic meltdown that spread radioactive fallout across Europe.</p>
<p>Chernobyl and the nearby town of Pripyat have been abandoned ever since, although they have attracted large numbers of tourists in recent years.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the situation?</p>
<p>Hundreds of firefighters as well as planes and helicopters were sent to tackle the fire.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, state emergency services announced the blaze had largely been contained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no open fire,&rdquo; a statement said, adding that there was &ldquo;a slight smouldering of the forest floor&rdquo; in separate places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are trying to stop the spread of several hot spots of fire,&rdquo; said Volodymyr Demchuk, a senior official from Ukraine&rsquo;s emergency service.</p>
<p>Aircraft dropped 538 tons of water on the blaze on Monday, the statement said. Background radiation in and around the capital Kyiv &ldquo;is within normal limits&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Over the past week there have been concerns the fire could threaten the plant and even spread radioactive chemicals.</p>
<p>Sergiy Zibtsev, head of the Regional Eastern European Fire Monitoring Center, told AFP news agency that the fire had become &ldquo;super-huge&rdquo; and &ldquo;unpredictable&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Local tour operator Yaroslav Emelianenko said on Monday that one fire had reached Pripyat and was even just 2km (1.24 miles) from where the most dangerous waste from the plant was stored. &ldquo;The situation is critical,&rdquo; he wrote on Facebook.</p>
<p>In 2018 more than 70,000 people visited the town. Last year that figure was even higher, after the success of an HBO mini-series about the disaster.</p>
<p>Chernobyl nuclear power station and Pripyat have been abandoned since 1986, when the plantâ€™s No. 4 reactor blew up.</p>
<p>People are forbidden from living within 30km (18 miles) of the power station.</p>
<p>Chernobyl continued to generate power until the plant&rsquo;s last operational reactor was finally closed in 2000. A giant shield built to cover the reactor was installed in November 2016, replacing a decaying sarcophagus built in 1986 to seal in nuclear materials.</p>

<h3 id="new-wildfires-in-area-around-ukraines-chernobyl-plant">New Wildfires in Area Around Ukraine&rsquo;s Chernobyl Plant</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/ap-images/2020/04/60d9e42d6de3de98e1a4ef8c75faecf2.jpg" alt="img">
MINSK - Three new wildfires have started in the radiation-contaminated evacuation zone around Ukraine&rsquo;s wrecked Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the site of the world&rsquo;s worst nuclear accident 34 years ago, emergency officials said Thursday.</p>
<p>A statement from the Emergencies Ministry said the fires were small and posed no threat to facilities holding radioactive waste. The statement did give an area for the fires or say how they started, but said they were being fanned by gusty winds.</p>
<p>Firefighters battled large blazes in the area for 10 days this month before reporting Tuesday that they had been extinguished.</p>
<p>The fires are in the 2,600-square-kilometer (1,000-square-mile) Chernobyl Exclusion Zone that was established after the 1986 disaster at the plant that sent a cloud of radioactive fallout over much of Europe.</p>
<p>The zone is largely unpopulated, although about 200 people have remained despite orders to leave. Fires in the area raise concerns that they could spread radioactive material.

<h3 id="chernobyl-fire-has-not-affected-greece-commission-says">Chernobyl fire has not affected Greece, commission says</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.ekathimerini.com/resources/2020-04/chernobyl-thumb-large.jpg" alt="img">
No radioactivity has been detected in the Greek atmosphere nor are findings of any radiological significance expected, the Greek Atomic Energy Commission (EEAE) said in a new statement regarding a forest fire that took place from April 4 to 14 in the area of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The EEAE said that no changes had been recorded by Greeceâ€™s network of radiation measuring stations.</p>
<p>Levels of radioactivity in Greece are monitored on a continuous and systematic basis through the national network of radiation measuring stations, which has been operating since 2000.
