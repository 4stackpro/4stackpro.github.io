<p><img src="https://cdn.extra.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/12191212/vogueamy.jpg" alt="img">
Irish celebrities stormed Instagram today, as the likes of Vogue Williams and Amy Huberman shared beautiful photographs of their families celebrating Easter Sunday together.</p>
<p>Vogue Williams shared some gorgeous family photographs as she celebrates Easter Sunday with her husband Spencer and their son Theodore. The Irish TV personality celebrated the holiday with her family as they isolate together at their London home.</p>
<p>Sharing some fabulous snaps of their one-year-old son Theodore wearing bunny ears, she wrote ‘Happy Easter everyone… I hope you’re all having a great day. It’s not ideal being away from our families but we have got this! All the love.’</p>
<p>Vogue’s followers were quick to comment, wishing her a happy Easter, and begging to know where she had gotten her stunning outfit.</p>
<p>‘Loving your dress Vogue x where is it from, please? X Happy Easter’ wrote one. ‘Happy Easter! I want that dress!’ commented another.</p>
<p>As well as her dress — which is from H&amp;M, by the way — Vogue also showed off her baby bump in the snaps. The model is expecting her second child with Spencer Matthews later on in the year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Amy Huberman, shared a snap of her husband Brian O’Driscoll with his chocolate, although it wasn’t the Easter Egg he was expecting.</p>
<p>The actress showed her followers a photo of Brian grinning with a chocolate Santa in his arms.</p>
<p>‘ I was just sooooo organized for Easter for your man this year I got this 4 months ago’ she joked.</p>
<p>‘May have found this at the back of the press and how I have not eaten it before now is a baffling Christmas miracle!’

A LOUTH hardware store has donated 2,000 Easter Eggs to hardworking frontline staff at two major hospitals in Ireland.</p>
<p>Dundalk-based firm Toolfix delivered the chocolate to brave workers at Navan General Hospital and Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda this past Easter Sunday.</p>
<p>A small but welcome gesture, the Ecco Road-based company provided the sweet treats as a thank you for the incredible work and dedication shown by those treating Ireland’s sick and vulnerable during this coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>It’s a situation the good people over at Toolfix are only too aware of.</p>

<p>Keen to do their bit to show some appreciation for the sacrifices being made, the company loaded up their vans with chocolate eggs before making the surprise drop-offs early on Sunday - much to the delight of the staff still on shift at both hospitals.</p>
<p>A note accompanied their generous chocolate gifts: &ldquo;To the staff working on the frontline. A small token of appreciation for all your hard work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking to The Irish Daily Mirror, Toolfix staff member Sean Matthews said frontline workers were delighted by the delivery.</p>
