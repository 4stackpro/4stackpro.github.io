<h3 id="oakland-county-unveils-heatmap-of-covid-19-cases-by-zipcode">Oakland County unveils heatmap of COVID-19 cases by zipcode</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox2detroit.com/www.fox2detroit.com/content/uploads/2020/03/724/407/oak-co-map.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1" alt="img">
article</p>
<p>The Oakland County Health Division is giving more information about where COVID-19 is within the entire county as it grapples with more than a thousand cases, behind only Wayne County for the most in the state.</p>
<p>Southeast Michigan is the epicenter of coronavirus/COVID-19 cases in Michigan. Wayne County has almost 3,000 confirmed cases while Oakland County is second in the state with over 1,200 cases.</p>
<p>County Executive Dave Coulter, the Health Division and the Emergency Operations Center gave an update on Monday about how the county is responding to the crisis.</p>
<p>The county has released a map showing cases by zip code within the county. The map is being added to the county&rsquo;s dashboard which tracks the deaths, confirmed cases, and hospital admittance in the county.</p>
<p>The county map shows a higher concentration of cases in Southfield and in part of West Bloomfield. However, the county cautioned that regardless of what number of cases are in your city, you must still be vigilant and follow the state order of staying home.</p>
<p>The map is not indicative of where people caught the virus - only where they live. Coulter cautions that the data is just a piece of information but is not the most important part of what we need to know.</p>

<p>Track the map here on Oakgov.com</p>
<p>Coulter said he&rsquo;s growing more concerned about the status of hospitals in the next week as they&rsquo;re starting to reach their limits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re entering a critical week where they&rsquo;re going to be at capacity and they&rsquo;re going to need our assistance,&rdquo; Coulter said.</p>
<p>Coulter said they need 200,000 N95 masks and have had 40,000 donated by residents and businesses in the county.</p>
<p>Coulter said people can still donate items at Oakland County Farmer&rsquo;s Market at 2350 Pontiac Lake Rd, Waterford Twp, MI.</p>
<p>Sunday, Oak Park was listed as a &lsquo;hotbed&rsquo; of COVID-19 cases as City Manager Erik Tungate said there seemed to be a higher level of cases in the city.</p>
<p>RELATED: Is it the flu, a cold or COVID-19? Different viruses present similar symptoms</p>
<p>Since the first cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in Michigan on March 10, Gov. Whitmer has declared a state emergency, closed all schools, prohibited gatherings of more than 50 people, restricted visits to hospitals and other facilities, closed public spaces such as theaters, bars, gyms and casinos, and limited restaurants to carry-out and delivery orders.</p>
<p>Most recently, she&rsquo;s also issued a stay-home order. You can get details on what that means here.</p>
<p>That was all in efforts to social distance and slow the spread of the virus. You can learn more about social distancing and flattening the curve in the video player above.</p>
<p>RELATED: Is it the flu, a cold or COVID-19? Different viruses present similar symptoms</p>
<p>Symptoms for coronavirus COVID-19 include fever, coughing, and shortness of breath.</p>
<p>To protect yourself, wash your hands well and often, keep them away from your face, and avoid crowds and standing close to people.</p>
<p>Are you showing symptoms? Try Beaumont&rsquo;s virtual screening tool</p>
<p>And if you do find yourself showing any of these flu or coronavirus symptoms - don&rsquo;t go straight to your doctor&rsquo;s office. That just risks making more people sick, officials urge. Call ahead, and ask if you need to be seen and where.</p>

<p>ACLU of Iowa files lawsuit challenging Gov. Kim Reynolds&rsquo; orders to suspend surgical abortions</p>
<p>March 30: Gov. Kim Reynolds&rsquo; orders to suspend surgical abortions in Iowa during the coronavirus outbreak will face a legal challenge.</p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa filed a lawsuit Monday on behalf of several groups seeking an immediate halt to Reynolds&rsquo; directive.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed in Johnson County District Court and names Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, Planned Parenthood Medical Director Jill Meadows and the Iowa City-based Emma Goldman Clinic as petitioners. Reynolds is listed as a respondent, alongside several state officials.</p>
<p>The lawsuit seeks an emergency injunction of Reynolds&rsquo; order, announced late last week, that would stop surgical abortions in Iowa until mid-April.</p>
<p>The ACLU lawsuit throws Iowa into litigation over women&rsquo;s reproductive health at a time that the state is responding to growing cases of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus.</p>
<p>Pat Garrett, a spokesman for Reynolds, told the Register that the office does not have a comment about the lawsuit.</p>

<p>Wells Fargo confirms COVID-19 case at West Des Moines call center</p>
<p>March 30: An employee who works at Wells Fargo’s West Des Moines contact center has tested positive for COVID-19, company officials confirmed Monday.</p>
<p>Wells Fargo first learned of the confirmed case Sunday. The employee is at home and is being “closely monitored by their doctor and public health authorities,” corporate communications director Steve Carlson told the Des Moines Register.</p>
<p>“We performed enhanced cleaning at the location, and we have asked employees who have been in close proximity with the employee to not come into the office in accordance with public health guidance. Those employees will not need to use paid time off,” Carlson said.</p>
<p>“We wish our colleague a full and speedy recovery and will provide our full support,” he said. “Our first priority remains keeping Wells Fargo employees and customers safe and well-informed.”</p>
<p>He added that Wells Fargo is taking extra precaution for workers who “must be onsite in order to serve our customers.”</p>
<p>“We are taking significant actions to ensure the safety of our team, including enhancing social distancing measures, staggering staff and shifts, performing enhanced cleaning and implementing the CDC’s guidelines of six feet of space between individuals,” he said. “We continue to follow all public health guidance, and we remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers while reducing the risk to our employees and customers.”</p>
<p>&lsquo;A sad song in our hearts&rsquo;: 80/35 Music Festival canceled</p>
<p>​​​​​​​March The annual music festival 80/35 has been canceled. The 2020 event would have been the 13th edition of the festival, put on by the Des Moines Music Coalition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a small, nonprofit organization that relies on ticket sales, volunteers, community grants, and corporate sponsorships, the COVID-19 global pandemic has profoundly disrupted our ability to responsibly prepare and produce the festival in a manner that ensures its future success,&rdquo; the group wrote. &ldquo;A future without 80/35 was something we couldn’t risk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>World Pork Expo canceled again — this time for a human disease</p>
<p>March 30: The World Pork Expo, planned for June in Des Moines, has been canceled due to the coronavirus outbreak, the National Pork Producers Council said Monday.</p>
<p>The group said the board of directors were &ldquo;deeply disappointed&rdquo; but agreed the move would help producers focus on feeding Americans through the public health emergency.</p>
<p>It will be the second year that the expo has been canceled. The event at the Iowa State Fairgrounds was canceled in 2019 “out of an abundance of caution” because of concerns surrounding African swine fever, which swept through China and other countries, killing millions of pigs.</p>
<p>The event attracts about 20,000 people over three days. In 2018, the event generated about 5,200 hotel room stays and $6.3 million in spending, tourism officials said.</p>
<p>African swine fever, which is deadly for pigs but harmless to humans, remains a threat, with outbreaks reported in Africa, Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>March 30: The Principal Charity Classic, a mainstay on the PGA TOUR Champions professional golf circuit for nearly two decades, has moved its three-day, 2020 event at the Wakonda Club to Sept. 4-6.</p>
<p>The tournament&rsquo;s competition dates were originally scheduled for May 29-31.</p>
<p>All tickets, volunteer registrations and sponsorships will remain valid for the rescheduled dates, according to a tournament news release.</p>
<p>The event is the sixth on the 50-and-over professional tour to be affected on the 2020 schedule. Three tournaments have been canceled outright; one major tournament, the Regions Tradition, has been moved from early May to late September; and the Rapiscan Systems Classic, which was scheduled for this past weekend, was postponed without an announced rescheduled date.</p>
<p>The proactive rescheduling gives the tournament hope to preserve the event’s philanthropic mission since Principal became the title sponsor in 2007. (The event was previously the Allianz Championship from 2001-06.) The tournament has raised more than $23 million for Iowa children’s charities during that time, including a record $5.7 million from the 2019 edition.</p>

<p>Iowa workers no longer have to exhaust paid leave for unemployment</p>
<p>March 30: Iowans no longer need to use all their paid leave prior to becoming eligible for unemployment benefits tied to the COVID-19 outbreak, Iowa Workforce Development said Monday.</p>
<p>The change is effective immediately, but it will not be applied retroactively, the state said. The state will not backdate claims prior to this week, it said.</p>
<p>Iowa had required unemployed workers to use all available paid leave prior to filing for benefits to help sustain the employer-funded trust fund that provides jobless benefits.</p>
<p>The state said the $2 trillion coronavirus relief package passed last week provides additional funding for workers who are unemployed due to the outbreak.</p>
<p>The federal benefits program also expands the number of people eligible for unemployment, including self-employed workers, independent contractors, nonprofit employees, and gig economy workers as well as workers who have exhausted their benefits.</p>

<p>Demand keeps truckers working during coronavirus outbreak</p>

<p>March 29: As Americans hunker down in isolation against the highly contagious coronavirus, truck drivers have been delivering goods as usual across the country. At a rest stop in Mitchellville, a town of 2,300 people on the far eastern edge of Polk County along Interstate 80, trucks rumble in and out, proof that, as some businesses close and many workers are laid off, COVID-19 hasn’t put the brakes on the trucking industry.</p>
<p>In fact, industry experts say trucking has boomed in March as demand surged, fed by shoppers buying bulk quantities of essential goods ranging from eggs to bleach wipes. Brenda Neville, president of the Iowa Motor Truck Association, attributed the spike in demand to customers stocking up ahead of social distancing and stay-at-home orders.</p>
<p>“Traffic has backed off a little bit, you can see that, but otherwise it’s just another day for me,” Eric Webb, a truck driver from Council Bluffs, said last week.</p>

<p>Iowa&rsquo;s coronavirus &lsquo;peak&rsquo; might be 3 weeks away</p>
<p>March 29: Iowa’s first “peak” of novel coronavirus infections could still be two or three weeks out, a public health official said at Sunday’s news conference with Gov. Kim Reynolds.</p>
<p>The state announced the fourth death related to COVID-19 on Sunday morning. The Iowan was 61-80 years old and a Linn County resident. An additional 38 Iowans have also tested positive for coronavirus, bringing Iowa’s total confirmed cases to 336.</p>
<p>“It should be every Iowan’s assumption that the virus is currently circulating in their community,” Iowa Department of Public Health Deputy Director Sarah Reisetter said Sunday.</p>
<p>Reisetter and Reynolds expect the total confirmed cases to continue to rise as more people show symptoms and the state’s increased testing capacity shows more results.</p>
<p>“We might see a peak, a first peak, in the next two to three weeks,” Reisetter said, adding that circumstances are changing and that estimate could change as more information becomes available.</p>
