New Zealanders should know this week whether they will be kept in lockdown for longer than four weeks as Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and her cabinet ministers are set to receive fresh advice.</p>
<p>The tough Covid-19 lockdown measures were brought in at midnight March 26, meaning all New Zealanders were required to self-isolate in their homes.</p>
<p>Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield this afternoon said there had been a flattening off in new coronavirus cases, but that he would like to see if that continued over the next two or three days.</p>
<p>Based on that outcome, Bloomfield would then provide advice to Cabinet this week about whether the lockdown should be extended.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may well be it [Covid-19] has peaked now,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The number of cases does seem to be levelling off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were now 950 likely cases of Covid-19 in the country after Bloomfield today said there were 52 new confirmed cases and 30 probables overnight.</p>
<p>The flattening off in cases was also backed by a ramping up of testing, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got good levels of testing happening. That&rsquo;s providing us with good information. So we&rsquo;re increasingly confident these lockdown measures are working.&rdquo;</p>
<p>New Zealanders officially went into lockdown at 11.59pm on Wednesday, March 25 after Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern attempted to get on the front foot in combat ting the highly contagious virus.</p>
<p>She took New Zealand into a state of emergency that led to all non-essential businesses closing and Kiwis staying home except for trips for essential supplies from the supermarket and pharmacy and exercise close to their homes.</p>
<p>What you can do</p>
<p>• Act and behave like you have Covid-19 by avoiding people and places to help reduce the risk of spreading the virus.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>• Spend time with people in your direct household.</p>
<p>• Go for a walk or exercise and enjoy fresh air, but keep a 2m distance from people at all times. Take your children outside and spend time with the people you are isolating with, but do it close to home.</p>
<p>• Drive in private vehicles in your own town/city for essential reasons like going to the supermarket or pharmacy.</p>
<p>• Children in shared custody arrangements can go between parents&rsquo; households as long as they live within the same community, city or town. If not, they will have to spend the lockdown with one parent.</p>
<p>• Go to a supermarket or dairy for essential items. Follow all the safety measures in place to reduce the risk of getting or spreading Covid-19.</p>
<p>• If people need to see a doctor or other medical professional they must phone first. Most consultations will be over the phone or by videoconference to stop any risk of the disease spreading by person-to-person contact.</p>
<p>• Put rubbish out for kerbside collection.</p>
<p>• Sign up to our daily Covid-19 newsletter for essential advice and a full summary of the day&rsquo;s news and developments. Register or sign in here and select Top News Stories</p>
<p>What you can&rsquo;t do</p>
<p>• If they don&rsquo;t live in your household, you can not visit or socialise with others outside your household - even elderly family members.</p>
<p>• Go out on the water. That includes fishing, surfing, boating, kayaking. Anyone who does could need rescuing, putting themselves, Coastguard volunteers and staff and health professionals in harm&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>• Share custody of children if the parents or caregivers live in separate towns/cities.</p>
<p>• Go hunting. You might think you&rsquo;re safe and well away from other people but should you get lost, injured or need other help, you put search and rescue teams at risk and could burden health and emergency service resources.</p>
<p>• Use public playground equipment. Councils&rsquo; playgrounds in parks, reserves and recreational areas have closed.</p>
<p>What are essential businesses?</p>
<p>Businesses that are essential to the necessities of life, and those that support them. This means food, medicine, healthcare, energy, fuel, waste-removal, internet and financial support.</p>
<p>What businesses can remain open during lockdown?</p>
<p>• Dairies, with a one-in-one-out rule. They cannot sell cooked food.</p>
<p>• Meals-on-wheels and whole-food delivery (eg subscription food boxes).</p>
<p>• Self-service laundries, with 2m physical distancing to be enforced.</p>
<p>• Bunnings, Placemakers, Mitre 10 and other retailers essential to the supply chain for building and construction can stay open to trade customers for essential purposes only.

<h3 id="covid-19-coronavirus-auckland-family-appeals-for-time-with-dying-grandfather">Covid 19 coronavirus: Auckland family appeals for time with dying grandfather</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/GiJqlFsVWLhKJBFHHxpmljuvZOE=/1200x0/smart/filters:quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-syd-prod-nzme.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2T3EEN4FUZE53BORGRU5W55DH4.jpg" alt="img">
John Parkes is nearing the end of his life after a battle with cancer - and all he wants is for someone to hold his hand.</p>
<p>Now the 76-year-old&rsquo;s family is making an urgent appeal for leniency and compassion, as the Covid-19 lockdown means very limited time with their father just when he needs it the most.</p>
<p>Aucklander Jess Parkes, 20, has described the heartbreak of being told that as of today, visiting times to see her grandfather would be cut down to 15 minutes per day - by one family member only.</p>
<p>There is to be no physical contact and the person who comes to see him must stand at the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We all know the importance of the Covid-19 lockdown and we all really appreciate the healthcare team [caring] for my grandfather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, for compassionate reasons, families should be able to say goodbye to their loved ones - not just my family, but other families who are in the same position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All we want is for him to be comfortable and to not be distressed in his final days. He doesn&rsquo;t deserve to die alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The family has chosen to speak out about the issue as they felt there would be many other people and families going through the same struggle.</p>
<p>They had earlier been allowed to visit daily. The only rules were that visits be restricted to one person at a time and not after 8pm.</p>

<p>Yesterday, however, was particularly difficult for both Parkes and her grandfather, who became emotional when his granddaughter was told she had to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was crying and would not let go of my hand,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I tried to leave - his grip is so strong - I couldn&rsquo;t get my hand away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just walking around the hospital crying because I didn&rsquo;t want to leave him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert Parkes said his father had been tested for Covid-19 and the result had come back negative.</p>
<p>He and his sister and their respective families and their mother were also keeping to separate isolation bubbles and no one was sick or showing flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>The situation has taken a toll on their family.</p>
<p>Even the staff at Middlemore Hospital were upset for them, he said, with nurses apologising and saying the lockdown had also been hugely hard on themselves as they could not give the kind of palliative care they wanted to.</p>
<p>• Covid19.govt.nz: The Government&rsquo;s official Covid-19 advisory website</p>
<p>&lsquo;He deserves his family and that respect at the end&rsquo;</p>
<p>That care included giving families the opportunities to come together and sit with a patient, hold their hand and simply spend time with them.</p>
<p>John Parkes is to be transferred to Pukekohe Hospital and the rules would be the same there too.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes was simply not enough, Robert Parkes said.</p>
<p>He said it was even more upsetting when taking into account that their father served in the Royal New Zealand Navy, worked in Foreign Affairs and the Government Communications Security Bureau.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He worked protecting the country and he&rsquo;s a very proud man and New Zealander - we&rsquo;ve always been very proud of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father deserved to have his family around him and deserved that care and respect at the end, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The overwhelming message from everyone is that this is unnecessary and it&rsquo;s actually cruel not only to the patient and the families, but the medical staff too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jess Parkes posted a touching photo online yesterday, holding her granddad&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The photo is from when I got asked to leave the hospital and because of the new policy, it might be the last time I ever hold his hand.&rdquo;

<h3 id="covid-19-coronavirus-love-in-age-of-lockdown-how-kiwi-couples-cope">Covid 19 coronavirus: Love in age of lockdown, how Kiwi couples cope</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/7Kg516W1MX0-I_BaC0XOr5dE07k=/1200x0/smart/filters:quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-syd-prod-nzme.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YY6IGBMDDNHZJHSQZ7KPEK57KE.jpg" alt="img">
Keeping the flames of love burning isn&rsquo;t always easy - even in a world where candlelit restaurants are open and couples can stroll the beach at sunset.</p>
<p>So how are New Zealand couples keeping their passion afire in Covid-19&rsquo;s world under lockdown?</p>
<p>Here new flames, newlyweds, young parents and those with more than half a century together tell the Herald on Sunday how they are keeping love alive in the age of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Kersti Ward and Justin Spick: young couple apart</p>

<p>Kersti Ward, 22, and boyfriend Justin Spick, 21, made an important commitment not to cheat on each other while in lockdown, hundreds of kilometres apart.</p>
<p>Netflix cheat, that is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We made a commitment to not watch-ahead the shows that we&rsquo;ve been watching or were gonna watch together,&rdquo; Ward - who is in lockdown in Taranaki with her family - says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is something I get pretty grumpy about when we promised to watch something and one skips ahead. There is a lot of trust in that,&rdquo; she says with a laugh.</p>
<p>With Spick staying in Auckland during the lockdown because he wasn&rsquo;t sure whether his building project would be classified as an essential service, the couple have each installed a Google Chrome internet browser extension called Netflix Party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means that if one person pauses a movie, it pauses it for everyone and makes a little chatbox so you can type and talk,&rdquo; Ward says.</p>
<p>Aside from Netflix, they have also been talking and eating lunch together on FaceTime video calls.</p>
<p>However, it can be hard to find new things to chat about when both are locked indoors all day, Ward admits.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is important to check in and make sure each other is okay, but also understand that you are both going to be quite stressed,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no pressure to be in each other&rsquo;s face, but also we need to balance that with not neglecting the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The couple were also more grateful for the little things, with Ward vowing to spend fewer nights lazing indoors.</p>
<p>Her ideal first date night back after lockdown would be to reunite with Spick over their shared passion for Dominion Rd noodles.</p>
<p>Katie Mattice and Ryan Minett: young couple together</p>
<p>Ryan Minett and Katie Mattice&rsquo;s whirlwind romance has left them cooped up together during the coronavirus lock down. Photo / Supplied</p>
<p>Canadian Katie Mattice, 31, and Brit Ryan Minett, 26, set off on a crazy, whirlwind romance in February before the lockdown cooped them up in the same flat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was supposed to be a casual thing and now we&rsquo;re stuck together,&rdquo; Mattice said.</p>
<p>If that wasn&rsquo;t complicated enough, Minett is Mattice&rsquo;s ex-boyfriend&rsquo;s best friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are having fun, but also some days, you&rsquo;re like: what is happening with my life - this is a lot so fast,&rdquo; Mattice jokes, while Minett watches Married At First Sight on the television in the background of her call with the Herald.</p>
<p>The pair first met as friends three years ago on farms in Australia as part of their working holiday visa requirements.</p>
<p>Recently, they had been living separate lives, with Minett working as a tradie in Auckland, and Mattice as a hairdresser in Wellington.</p>
<p>Then Minett planned a road trip to the South Island in February with another girl, but first made a fateful stop in Wellington to catch up with Mattice.</p>
<p>‌</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few glasses of Canadian Club changed everything&rdquo;, Mattice says.</p>
<p>Having fallen in love, Minett aborted his South Island trip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was like, &lsquo;it is cool, we can do this, but let&rsquo;s not jump into it&rsquo;,&rdquo; Mattice says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need to get your own place, and I&rsquo;ll keep mine and we&rsquo;ll date like normal people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the lockdown hit before Minett could get a flat and job, so he stayed put with Mattice and her flatmate.</p>
<p>Now the couple are having fun, but also trying to give each other space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes he sleeps in a different room to so we can feel like we have separate houses,&rdquo; Mattice said.</p>
<p>They planned to reassess whether to live together or move into separate houses after the lockdown and &ldquo;date like normal people&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You still want to enjoy the honeymoon and the dating side of things, you&rsquo;ve got plenty of time to settle down and do crosswords together and die,&rdquo; Mattice says.</p>
<p>Lizzie and Rob Lee: young parents</p>

<p>High-school sweethearts and young parents Lizzie and Rob Lee, both 34, have been spending more time together than usual during the lockdown.</p>
<p>But - as it&rsquo;s filled with nappy changes and arts-and-crafts lessons - it&rsquo;s not exactly the romantic kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Physically we are spending more time together, because we are in the same space, but it is not really quality time,&rdquo; Lizzie says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am on a computer or in between work phone calls and trying to spend time with the kids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Auckland couple are parents to 2-year-old Spencer and almost 5-month-old Harrison.</p>
<p>Both boys would normally spend four days a week in childcare and one with their grandmother due to physiotherapist Rob owning Form Physio in Auckland city, and Lizzie returning from maternity leave to her marketing manager role with fitness chain Les Mills.</p>
<p>However, now Rob&rsquo;s business has temporarily closed, he is on fulltime &ldquo;daddy daycare&rdquo; duties.</p>

<p>To cope, the family decided they needed a routine. It involves waking early with Rob and Lizzie taking turns to work out before both get the kids ready and go on a family walk.</p>
<p>By 8am, Lizzie is working, while Rob entertains the boys. At 3pm, Lizzie puts her tools down for a dance workout with her sons, then she&rsquo;s back at work until 5.30pm.</p>
<p>Next she and the boys call a different family member on Skype before the next few hours are taken up with bath, dinner and bed duties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then finally my husband and I get to talk to each other or watch Netflix,&rdquo; Lizzie says.</p>
<p>The family are grateful for the extra time together and have made a rule of no work in the evenings, but Lizzie admits this needs attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We still need to get better at phones down after dinner,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Emily and Luke Orr: newlyweds</p>

<p>Everyone tells Hamilton couple Emily, 29, and Luke Orr, 34, they married just in time. They tied the knot in the middle of February, meaning all their guests could attend.</p>
<p>Yet their Japan and Bali honeymoon sadly fell victim to coronavirus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is like a little honeymoon - but just a really boring honeymoon at home,&rdquo; Emily says about spending extra time locked down together.</p>
<p>Emily runs group fitness classes - and has now taken to live-streaming a free class every day from her home to the public before sending it to paying clients - while Luke owns a painting business.</p>

<p>They have also made a rule to not put the TV on during the day so they can hang out more and get things done.</p>
<p>Luke is now repainting the house, while their border collie-cross-retriever, is &ldquo;loving life&rdquo; with two walks a day.</p>
<p>Luke&rsquo;s 14-year-old daughter from another relationship is also set also spend two weeks with the couple, which they are eagerly looking forward to.</p>
<p>And though the busy couple normally eat similar meals each day, they have found one way to spice up their lives - heating things up in the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We decided each night we are actually gonna become MasterChefs, so right now we are being more creative cooking, which is lots of fun,&rdquo; Emily says.</p>
<p>Rae and Gavin McGregor: older couple</p>

<p>Authors Rae, 78, and Gavin, 82, McGregor didn&rsquo;t panic-buy at the supermarket before the lockdown.</p>
<p>Instead, they panic-borrowed from the library.</p>
<p>The Auckland couple - who have been married for 58 years - haven&rsquo;t had as much disruption from the lockdown as some others.</p>
<p>Gavin has been kept apart from his beloved sailing - including his role as skipper of the Maritime Museum&rsquo;s heritage sailing ship the Ted Ashby - and the couple have had to suspend their many voluntary roles.</p>
<p>But with Gavin researching a book about the MV Kaitawa - which disappeared near Cape Reinga with all hands in 1966 - and Rae writing her own novel, the pair have plenty of hobbies to keep them busy and in each other&rsquo;s company.</p>
<p>They are getting My Food Bag deliveries - although Gavin is making some visits to the supermarket, which he describes as a worry.</p>
<p>Another older couple from Albany, who did not want to be named, have described learning a new skill because of the coronavirus - ordering supermarket shopping online.</p>
<p>However, after accidentally clicking to collect the shopping rather than get it delivered, they have had to seek help from Age Concern, who sent a volunteer to drop it off for them.</p>
<p>The woman notes that it is not just love between couples but family love being affected by the lockdown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have one little granddaughter who is 5 years old, I&rsquo;m so close to her and she broke her arm a few weeks ago in a playground,&rdquo; the woman says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Normally, I&rsquo;m the first one to help but it is so frustrating I can&rsquo;t even give her hugs and cuddles anymore.&rdquo;
