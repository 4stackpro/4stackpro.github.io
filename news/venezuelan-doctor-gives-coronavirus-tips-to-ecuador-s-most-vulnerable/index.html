Armed with a poster and flyers in his hand and a stethoscope around his neck, Venezuelan physician Samuel Suárez set out on foot to provide life-saving advice on how to prevent COVID-19 infection to some of the most vulnerable people in a remote corner of Ecuador.</p>
<p>After fleeing insecurity, widespread violence, and shortages of food and medicines in Venezuela back in 2018, the medic started going door-to-door to explain the dangers of the spreading pandemic to elderly people in Ecuador’s Esmeraldas province, hoping that his advice would be heeded and the spread of the virus avoided.</p>
<p>During the house calls, Samuel patiently walks his small audiences of senior citizens – the demographic most susceptible to the illness – through the steps needed to protect themselves and others, from frequently washing their hands with soap and water to maintaining a safe distance of two meters between people.</p>
<p>And because some of the patients cannot read, he often acts out the recommendations on his informative poster, miming the proper way of coughing into the crook of the elbow to prevent the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>“In these remote communities, when the power’s out there’s no water, and hand washing and basic hygiene become that much more difficult,” said 27-year-old Samuel. “That makes us more vulnerable.”</p>
<p>Soon after he heard about the coronavirus outbreak, Samuel began crisscrossing the area in and around the tiny town of San Francisco, where he has worked in the local clinic for the past year and a half.</p>
<p>The area is home to a substantial community of refugees that includes Colombians who have fled the armed conflict in their country, as well as Venezuelans, nearly five million of whom are now living outside their country amidst the ongoing crisis at home.</p>
<p>After fleeing his native Venezuela, Samuel made his way to Ecuador, where he validated his medical degree. Having passed the exam, he was able to secure a job in Ecuador’s public health system and put his skills to use.</p>
<p>“I will continue to fight each and every day to share my knowledge.”</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has reached Ecuador, and although San Francisco has yet to see its first confirmed case of the virus, Samuel knows it is likely just a question of time before the area is affected. As a result, he redoubled his efforts to help give the local population – including the refugee community – the information they need to stay safe.</p>
<p>Refugees tend to be particularly at risk, as their often-precarious living conditions make basic sanitation and social distancing difficult, and also because restrictions on movement compromise employment and food security.</p>
<p>Facing the crisis, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, has continued to serve refugees, asylum seekers, displaced people, and their host communities throughout Latin America and the world. In response to restrictions on movement and physical contact, UNHCR has set up hotlines in Ecuador and other countries to provide assistance and protection.</p>
<p>The agency has ratcheted up outreach efforts to inform refugees and migrants about what to do if they present symptoms and handed out crucial hygiene products. It has also provided increased access to shelters for refugees living on the streets and installed additional sinks in shelters and reception facilities, among other initiatives.</p>
<p>Working to give life-saving information about the virus, Samuel stressed his commitment to inform and care for his host community in the difficult weeks ahead.</p>
<p>“Throughout the coronavirus epidemic, I will continue to fight each and every day to share my knowledge with the people of San Francisco,” he said.</p>
<p>UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration today stressed that more inclusive measures and additional aid are urgently needed for refugees and migrants from Venezuela, and their hosts, as the current global health emergency compounds their already desperate situation.</p>

Can the coronavirus live on food packaging? For how long? Experts advise how to decontaminate during the pandemic</p>
<p>Do you need to wash your groceries? And other advice for shopping safely</p>
<p>The coronavirus is thought to spread largely via person-to-person contact, but it can also live on surfaces – including food packaging – for several days. While some how-to videos and articles are encouraging people to disinfect grocery containers, mail and other packages entering the home, experts say that is probably overkill.</p>
<p>Below are step-by-step tips from experts about how to get what you need from the store and limit your exposure to the virus as much as possible.</p>
<p>Limit your trips and go when stores are less crowded</p>
<p>Experts advise limiting grocery trips to once every two weeks, if possible. This may mean stocking up on dry goods, and frozen or canned fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>If you can, plan to shop during off-peak hours. Some stores are setting aside times for older and immunocompromised people to shop with reduced crowds. Keep a distance of at least six feet from other shoppers.</p>
<p>Plan what you need before you go to minimize your time in the supermarket.</p>
<p>Clean your hands and disinfect your cart</p>
<p>“As soon as you get there, use hand sanitizer, and touch only what you need to touch. Wipe down your cart handle, and then use the hand sanitizer again,” said Elizabeth Eckstrom, professor and chief of geriatrics at Oregon Health and Science University.</p>
<p>Shoppers should also avoid touching their phones or wipe them down after any possible contamination, said Julia Marcus, an infectious disease epidemiologist and professor in the department of population medicine at Harvard Medical School. Gloves are not necessary, she said.</p>
<p>“Generally when we use gloves outside of the healthcare setting and just in the community, they tend to become like a second skin. We end up touching our faces, and they may actually make us feel like we’re not at risk but they themselves can become contaminated and may actually be a better surface for the virus to persist on than our own skin,” she said.</p>
<p>You don’t need to sanitize food packaging</p>
<p>While the coronavirus is not thought to be transmissible via food, it can live for several days on materials used to package food. Preliminary research shows it can survive on cardboard for 24 hours and on plastic for 72 hours. But the amount of the virus also quickly declines during that time period.</p>
<p>The US Centers for Disease Control currently does not recommend disinfecting packaging. And Marcus said shoppers should instead thoroughly wash their hands after handling any item that might have been touched by others.</p>
<p>“At this point, there’s no evidence that transmission is happening through food packaging. That said, we know the virus can remain viable on surfaces for hours or even days, so there’s a hypothetical risk of transmission through touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth,” Marcus said. “Better than disinfecting, the thing we keep saying over and over again is to just wash your hands.”</p>
<p>Donald W Schaffner, a food microbiologist and professor at Rutgers University, has firmly pushed back on viral advice for people to disinfect food packaging.</p>
<p>“Right now there’s no evidence that [the virus is] spread through food. There’s no evidence that it’s spread through food packaging. That doesn’t mean that we might not learn new evidence tomorrow that would change our thoughts on that, but right now that’s what we believe,” Schaffner said.</p>
<p>While the US government has provided a list of cleaning products that can kill the virus, most of them should not come into contact with food. Schaffner said people using them may expose themselves to chemicals that are designed for use on hard surfaces, not disinfecting groceries.</p>
<p>Food safety experts also say produce should be washed only with water and not household dish soap.</p>
<p>Do not go to the store, or any public spaces, if you have been exposed to the coronavirus or are experiencing symptoms</p>
<p>People are thought to be most contagious when they are exhibiting symptoms. But the virus can also spread from people who don’t yet have symptoms or who have the virus but never get sick.</p>
<p>If you are 60 or older or have a compromised immune system, have your groceries delivered</p>
<p>Early statistics show that the older you are, the more likely you are to get critically ill or die if you contract the coronavirus, Eckstrom said. The CDC finds that the death rate for people 65 to 84 years old is 3% to 11%, and the death rate for people 85 and older is 10% to 27%.</p>
<p>“Age matters,” Eckstrom said. “And then if you’ve got chronic illnesses – and those kind of boil down to heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, immunosuppressed status – then you’ll also have to be much more cautious.”</p>
<p>If you have groceries brought to you, ask the delivery person or friend or family member to leave the bags outside. Tip electronically, if you can. Clean any surfaces the bags touch, and wash your hands thoroughly after storing food. Experts also advise frequently cleaning high-touch surfaces in the home, including door knobs and light switches.

<h3 id="coronavirus-travel-tips-to-fly-or-not-to-fly-what-happens-if-you-cancel">Coronavirus Travel Tips: To Fly Or Not To Fly? What Happens If You Cancel?</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2020/03/05/gettyimages-182882458-30_wide-0c059bc8df59e5e966da9ae91b186535563e7aa6.jpg?s=1400" alt="img">
Coronavirus Travel Tips: To Fly Or Not To Fly? What Happens If You Cancel?</p>
<p>Enlarge this image toggle caption Bim/Getty Images Bim/Getty Images</p>
<p>How safe — or risky — is it to fly?</p>
<p>Should I cancel a trip I&rsquo;ve planned?</p>
<p>Can I come home early from my trip?</p>
<p>These are some of the questions that would-be travelers are asking in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. We talked to travel and health specialists to get answers.</p>
<p>Can I cancel a trip I&rsquo;ve booked because I&rsquo;m afraid of the coronavirus?</p>
<p>Depends on whether you bought a refundable ticket or have the right kind of travel insurance. Regular travel insurance won&rsquo;t cover a cancellation because of fears about the coronavirus outbreak. For that, you need to buy a &ldquo;Cancel for Any Reason&rdquo; (CFAR) policy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve become quite popular in the last few weeks,&rdquo; says Jonathan Breeze, CEO of AardvarkCompare, a travel insurance comparison website. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing about a 50% increase in the amount of policies being sold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few things to note: A CFAR policy typically needs to be purchased within a couple of weeks from the time you booked your trip, it will usually only cover about 75% of your costs, and New York state does not allow residents to buy CFAR policies.</p>
<p>In addition, some credit cards have automatic travel insurance for trips purchased by their cardholders. Check with your provider to see whether you would be covered.</p>
<p>How do I pick a travel insurance policy?</p>
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all policy, according to Christopher Elliott, founder of a consumer advocacy organization, Elliott Advocacy. Factors such as your age, the length of your trip and what you want covered all figure into the decision. Elliott recommends reading the insurance contract before buying to check whether it applies to &ldquo;worst-case scenarios,&rdquo; such as sickness or flight delays. See this column for more advice.</p>
<p>What if I booked a flight and want to reschedule it to avoid traveling during the outbreak?</p>
<p>Several airlines — including American, Delta, Frontier, JetBlue and United — have been waiving change fees for flights purchased between certain dates. And even if your purchase falls outside that window, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s always worth asking,&rdquo; says Seth Kaplan, transportation analyst for WBUR&rsquo;s Here &amp; Now. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re asking for an exception,&rdquo; he says — but if you&rsquo;re polite and explain your situation, you might get a break.</p>
<p>What if I want to end my trip early, say, because the outbreak has spread to a country I&rsquo;m visiting?</p>
<p>In most cases, &ldquo;somebody abroad saying, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to be here anymore,&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t covered by regular travel insurance,&rdquo; says Breeze. Again, this is where a Cancel for Any Reason policy would come in handy. With many CFAR policies, a traveler can not only recover some of the initial cost of the trip, he says, but in many cases, the policy will also cover the additional cost of coming home.</p>
<p>Is international travel riskier to my health than domestic travel?</p>
<p>It depends. Shira Doron, a hospital epidemiologist and infectious disease specialist at Tufts Medical Center, says she would not recommend traveling to countries that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has put on its &ldquo;warning&rdquo; list to avoid nonessential travel, such as China, Iran, Italy and South Korea.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean domestic travel is risk-free. To put things in perspective, the virus is here, with case numbers on the rise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We already have community transmission within the United States,&rdquo; says Doron. &ldquo;So, at some point, it&rsquo;s not going to be any riskier to go to another country than it is to stay right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the virus is already out there, should I avoid plane travel just to be safe? After all, when you fly aren&rsquo;t you breathing in recycled air?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The air&rsquo;s actually pretty clean. It gets recirculated through these HEPA filters that really are very good at clearing stuff out,&rdquo; says Vicki Hertzberg, director of Emory University&rsquo;s Center for Nursing Data Science, who co-led a study on flights and disease transmission with scientists at Boeing. &ldquo;So in some aspects, the air on a plane is cleaner than what&rsquo;s going on in your new office buildings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moreover, Dr. Mark Gendreau, chief medical officer at Beverly Hospital in Massachusetts, says that airlines have a high incentive to keep their ventilation systems well-maintained: &ldquo;If the HEPA filter is not changed regularly, if the system is not maintained well, it puts a lot of drag on the engines, which will increase the fuel consumption, which is quite an expensive proposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another important thing to know: The new coronavirus is not airborne. Instead, it&rsquo;s transmitted through droplets of fluid or mucus that you cough or sneeze out, which generally don&rsquo;t travel farther than 6 feet. But if those droplets land on a surface that you later touch, you can pick up the virus that way.</p>
<p>People can help protect themselves and one another by taking precautions such as washing hands frequently, coughing into an elbow and trying not to touch eyes, nose and mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good hand hygiene is the solution,&rdquo; Doron says.</p>
<p>And not just in the bathroom. Even on the way back to your seat after a bathroom visit where you washed your hands, &ldquo;one may be touching doors, doorknobs, seats,&rdquo; says Dr. Lin Chen, president of the International Society of Travel Medicine and director of the travel medicine center at Mount Auburn Hospital in Massachusetts. So it&rsquo;s a good idea to use hand sanitizer at your seat before eating pretzels or sweeping hair from your face.</p>
<p>The CDC says your sanitizer should have at least 60% alcohol content.</p>
<p>How clean are planes anyway?</p>
<p>Airline sanitization is also something to consider. Some airlines are stepping up their cleaning game. American Airlines says it is conducting a &ldquo;more thorough cleaning of all hard surfaces&rdquo; and removing self-serve snack baskets on some international flights. Alaska Airlines says that, since March 2, it has been &ldquo;enhancing&rdquo; aircraft cleaning between flights. For planes whose schedules allow, the cleaning policy now includes seats, overhead air vents, bathroom door handles, window shades and luggage compartment handles.</p>
<p>Flights often turn around quickly, which could lead to possible lapses in the cleaning process, so Chen suggests bringing alcohol wipes to clean the areas you personally touch — including your seat belt, tray table and armrests. In a pinch, squeezing hand sanitizer onto a tissue and wiping down your armrest would probably work, she says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We really don&rsquo;t have data about how long the coronavirus survives on surfaces,&rdquo; Chen says. Other coronaviruses can last for a few hours or a few days on different materials, so for the time being, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s best to be more cautious,&rdquo; she says.</p>
