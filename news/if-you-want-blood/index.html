<p>Vitalant, All Aboard America and the Holiday Inn in Mesa are partnering up to offer free COVID-19 antibody testing if you participate in their blood drive on Tuesday June 16.</p>
<p>An antibody test can run you more than $100, so donating blood and getting the test free is a real deal.</p>
<p>The blood drive will be from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at 1600 South Country Club Drive in the Holiday Inn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Superstition Ballroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Making an appointment is encouraged and do not donate blood if you are currently sick, Vitalant says.</p>
<p>The antibody test does not test for a current COVID-19 infection.</p>
<p>All donors must wear a face mask.</p>

This week was our first week back in the office as a team. Even though we never stopped serving members, it has been an exciting change to be back working in person. This week we were busy with several projects. I spent the week evaluating July and August programming, as some of our programs will need to be modified and may look different than they usually do. Talena, our administrative assistant, worked on membership training and peach order. Kaylen, our summer program assistant, spent time calling potential donors for our upcoming blood drive which will be held from 8 a.m. to noon June 20 at the Farm Bureau building, 210 W. Spring St., Freeport. Did you know that anyone in good health, at least 17 years old, or 16 years old with parental consent, and at least 110 pounds may donate whole blood every 56 days? Did you know that one out of seven hospital patients need blood? Did you know that The Rock River Valley Blood Center is in dire need of blood donations? Are you willing and able to donate? Do you want to help those who are in our community and need blood donations? If so, we have several time slots still available. Each donor will receive a carton of Prairie Farms Ice Cream to take home with them. First time donors will receive a $20 Stephenson County Restaurant gift card. Donations appointments can be made by calling 815-232-3186 or emailing <a href="mailto:manager@stephensoncfb.org">manager@stephensoncfb.org</a>.</p>

<h3 id="empire-records-totally-bombed-but-25-years-later-its-still-got-a-loyal-following">&ldquo;Empire Records totally bombed, but 25 years later, it&rsquo;s still got a loyal following&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.abc.net.au/cm/rimage/12229818-16x9-large.jpg?v=2" alt="img">
If you grew up in 1990s, you might be familiar with Empire Records.</p>
<p>The film, which followed a raggedy crowd of employees at an independent record store facing corporate takeover, resonated with those of us who listened to &ldquo;alternative music&rdquo; and wanted to telegraph our displeasure at The Man.</p>
<p>Loading</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a very cool thing,&rdquo; Jenna Guillaume, a pop culture writer and the author of two works of young adult fiction, told me when we spoke about Empire Records, which was released 25 years ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The characters were outsiders and you were an outsider if you loved it and that became a token of your cool status.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the film was a disaster.</p>
<p>It was abandoned by its studio just weeks before its release.</p>
<p>While it gave early platforms to Liv Tyler and Renee Zellweger, critics mostly dumped on it and it barely made it to US screens, let alone Australian ones.</p>
<p>With a budget of more than $US10 million, it made just $US150,000 in cinemas.</p>
<p>So, what happened — and why do people still care?</p>
<p>Happy Rex Manning Day</p>
<p>Only in the past five years did Carol Heikkinen realise the movie had achieved cult status.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything I have really learned about the fanbase I have learned from Twitter or Instagram,&rdquo; Heikkinen, who wrote the screenplay for the 1995 film, tells the ABC.</p>
<p>Speaking from Los Angeles, she says she&rsquo;s not sure why what was supposed to be a wide cinema release got pulled back to a two-week run on very few US screens. She suspects it came down to negative test screenings.</p>
<p>In any case, these days &ldquo;people who do like it really like it a lot&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That includes the people who celebrate Rex Manning Day.</p>
<p>Loading&hellip;</p>
<p>In the world of the film, Rex Manning is the heartthrob singer who stops by for an instore promotional appearance.</p>
<p>When the extended DVD version of the film was released in the 2000s, fans noticed a poster for Manning&rsquo;s visit listed the date as April 8.</p>
<p>Now, each year, fans on rally around the iconography of Rex Manning — puffy white shirt, tight leather pants — and share their love for a sometimes-hokey &rsquo;90s film about friendship and staying true to your beliefs.</p>
<p>The real story behind Lucas</p>
<p>At beginning of the film, Lucas, after discovering the imminent sale of Empire Records, takes $9,000 from his boss Joe&rsquo;s desk and goes to Las Vegas in a misguided attempt to save the day.</p>
<p>Lucas&rsquo;s theft was inspired by a story Heikkinen heard while working at Tower Records in her hometown of Phoenix, Arizona.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the interesting part of it to me was he came back to the store,&rdquo; Heikkinen says of the real employee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he did not get arrested. I think he did get fired but they made arrangements for him to pay it back without getting arrested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rory Cochrane as Lucas, whose decision to gamble away $9,000 puts the store in jeopardy. ( IMDB )</p>
<p>While that was the spark for the story, in a few key ways what made it onscreen was different to Heikkinen&rsquo;s script, which she wrote on spec and sold within a week.</p>
<p>For starters, there was also no threat of corporate takeover, a storyline that felt wedded to the 90s, when anti-corporatisation was the guiding principle of alternative culture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucas sat on the couch all day and at the end of day he sort of made plans with Joe to pay him back,&rdquo; Heikkinen said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a much more low-key movie. It was about friendships and family and it wasn&rsquo;t about &lsquo;the Man&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Liv Tyler as Corey in one of her first movie roles. ( IMDB )</p>
<p>Another change, says Heikkinen: &ldquo;I never wrote a draft where Corey wanted to lose her virginity to Rex Manning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Corey wanted to meet him, but somewhere along the way someone decided a teen movie needed a raunchy storyline.</p>
<p>Hit singles but no movie to promote</p>
<p>When the film was released, in its very limited way, it got some fairly bad reviews, and one of which called it &ldquo;a soundtrack in search of a film&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That was almost a compliment for Mitchell Leib, a music supervisor on Empire Records who put together the soundtrack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My job was to have hit singles and a giant soundtrack that was supposed to not only enhance the playability of the movie, but also was supposed to act as a marketing asset and launch the film,&rdquo; Leib said.</p>
<p>And it worked — sort of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had two number 1 singles, with Gin Blossoms and Edwyn Collins, before the movie opened,&rdquo; Leib said. (You might remember the Edwyn Collins track by its chorus, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never know a girl like you before&rdquo;.)</p>
<p>Loading&hellip;</p>
<p>In the weeks leading up the film&rsquo;s opening, the boss of A&amp;M Records, the label who would release the soundtrack, was ecstatic at the early success of those singles. The label would be shipping three million copies to record stores, a huge number for a soundtrack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three weeks before the movie is supposed to come out I get called into a marketing meeting,&rdquo; Leib says.</p>
<p>It was bad news: the movie was dead. It would be shown on a very small number of screens for two weeks only, then go straight to VHS.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a guy like me, that is just about the biggest nightmare possible,&rdquo; Leib says.</p>
<p>He had to call back the head of the record label.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He blew his cork, he went silent, he hung up on me,&rdquo; Leib recalls. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he ever talked to me again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anthony LaPaglia really wanted that AC/DC song</p>
<p>One of many musical highlights of the film is the scene where Australian actor Anthony LaPaglia&rsquo;s character Joe vents frustration via an office drumming session involving AC/DC&rsquo;s If You Want Blood.</p>
<p>The song choice was LaPaglia&rsquo;s, Leib says, and he fought for it even when the cost of licensing the song raised the ire of the film&rsquo;s budget-conscious producers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think they tried to throw it out and Anthony ended up talking to the producers and saying, &lsquo;You throw that song out of the movie, you got a big problem with me&rsquo;,&rdquo; Leib says. (LaPaglia declined our request for an interview.)</p>
<p>Australian Anthony LaPaglia was one of the better-known actors when the first was shot. ( IMDB )</p>
<p>Toward the end of the film, Zellweger&rsquo;s character Gina and Berko (Coyote Shivers) perform on the roof of the store as a fundraiser. They play Sugarhigh, an original by Shivers, a Canadian musician and actor.</p>
<p>But there was a problem with the opening line: &ldquo;They all said she&rsquo;s just another groupie slut, I said I thought you were anything but.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously, it was going to be a PG movie, we couldn&rsquo;t have the word &lsquo;slut&rsquo;,&rdquo; Leib says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very challenging to have to have the conversation and to censor Coyote,&rdquo; a conversation made more delicate by the fact Shivers at the time was married to Bebe Buell, Tyler&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>In the end, to save the song being ditched altogether, the line was re-recorded for the film as, &ldquo;They all say life&rsquo;s just a bowl of cherries but sometimes it seems like anything but&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The one film poster that draws all the attention</p>
<p>While the movie bombed, the soundtrack did not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we did end up selling 2 million records, which is f***ing unbelievable for a movie that did $147,000 at the box office,&rdquo; Leib says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember when I saw my royalty statement I was like, Holy shit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The evidence of the film&rsquo;s legacy for him: when people come into his office at Disney and see the posters of the projects he has worked on lining the walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They see Pretty Woman, they see Good Morning, Vietnam, they see Pirates of The Caribbean, they see Beauty and the Beast,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They look at Empire Records and go, Oh my God, you did Empire Records?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loading&hellip;</p>
<p>Guillaume says the fact the film was a failure might have helped it resonate with the audience that did find it, particularly in Australia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the quintessential underdog story, and then the movie itself became symbolic of that because it did totally bomb,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>Heikkinen always believed she did good work.</p>
<p>Some movies make money, others don&rsquo;t. She is pleased it has meant something to the audience it did find, and still does so many years later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing that has been really nice to find out about is just women who, when they were in high school, in the 90s, had it on VHS, and watched it over and over and over again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For some of them, that&rsquo;s an important movie in their adolescence &hellip; That&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo;

<h3 id="high-blood-pressure-drugs-apparently-dont-add-to-covid-19-danger-as-earlier-feared">&ldquo;High blood pressure drugs apparently don’t add to covid-19 danger as earlier feared&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AYFISLFLP4I6VFGS266EHMTL7E.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
Certain widely used medications that treat high blood pressure apparently don’t add to the danger as earlier feared. Recent studies suggest they don’t make people more susceptible to becoming infected with the coronavirus, nor do they exacerbate the disease. As a result, doctors who care for patients with hypertension have urged them to continue taking the drugs.</p>
<p>“I believe these medications do not make covid-19 worse,” says Karan Desai, a cardiology fellow at the University of Maryland Medical Center. “These medications treat hypertension and heart failure. But if these conditions worsen or go untreated, it will likely make covid-19 more severe if a patient contracts the virus.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>These findings are important because earlier reports raised questions about whether two frequently prescribed classes of blood pressure drugs, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), might actually make people more vulnerable to contracting the virus and cause an infection to become more virulent.</p>
<p>Nearly half of all American adults have high blood pressure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Blood pressure is the force of blood as it pushes against the walls of the arteries carrying blood from the heart to the rest of the body. Uncontrolled hypertension can damage vital organs, such as the heart, brain, kidneys and eyes, and lead to heart disease and stroke.</p>
<p>Many people don’t even know they have it, one reason it is known as a “silent killer.” Worldwide, it results in an estimated 10.4 million deaths annually, according to the International Society of Hypertension.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The two groups of drugs lower blood pressure by tinkering with a specific body system that regulates it. But in doing so, they also affect ACE2 enzymes, specific receptors that the virus uses to latch onto cells and infect them, especially in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. The concern was that the drugs might be causing ACE2 molecules to proliferate, providing the virus with more targets and the opportunity to further spread infection.</p>
<p>The lack of clear answers about a virus that keeps delivering unexpected surprises — prompting ideas about its behavior to constantly change — underscores the plight many doctors have been facing as they try to provide sound advice to their patients about the safety of treatment options.</p>
<p>“The message from doctors and the media regarding these medications over the past few months has not been consistent,” Desai says. Early on, he says, he was haunted by “a nagging feeling that maybe I [was] causing harm. Patience has been hard. We all are hanging onto every piece of information. We all want answers, and we want them fast. The angst that comes with uncertainty and fear is understandable. As providers, we want to provide solutions. But as scientists, we have to be steadfast. We cannot make treatment decisions that are not grounded in science.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>So he and others were relieved at current evidence that shows the drugs do no harm. Some experts also believe ultimately they could prove beneficial.</p>
<p>“It may turn out that these agents may, in fact, even be protective, although we need additional research to confirm this,” says Robert T. Schooley, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of California at San Diego.</p>
<p>Schooley, himself past 60, has suffered from high blood pressure since he was in his 20s. In early April, he briefly stopped taking his ACE inhibitor, alarmed by early suspicions the drugs might worsen an infection.</p>
<p>“The idea that I was trading one danger for another was a frightening prospect,” Schooley says. “Nevertheless, I decided to stop until I had a chance to study all the evidence available. Since the effects of the drugs last for several days, I could allow the increased ACE receptor population to decay while I looked for more rigorous evidence about the potential connection.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>His drug break lasted four days. Schooley, also editor in chief of the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, routinely reviews countless manuscripts related to the novel coronavirus. After finding no evidence that the drugs increased the risk of infection or severe illness, he resumed taking them.</p>
<p>Researchers continue to study the effect of these drugs on coronavirus infection and disease. But they also want to understand exactly what makes hypertension so dangerous for covid patients, including whether high blood pressure alone — that is, without additional underlying conditions — raises the risk.</p>
<p>People with hypertension have a twofold risk of dying from covid-19, and those with untreated high blood pressure have an even greater risk, according to one study, although experts don’t know why.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Many clinicians point out that patients with high blood pressure also have other factors that put them at risk of severe covid disease, including their age, obesity, diabetes, as well as other conditions in addition to hypertension that contribute to heart disease.</p>
<p>“I think it may be guilt by association,” says Sandra J. Taler, a specialist in hypertension at the Mayo Clinic. “Hypertension is a very common health problem that increases with age. The older you get, the more likely you are to have it. The people who most often get sick and die are those with coexisting conditions, which include hypertension, but I don’t think hypertension per se is the reason they are dying. I believe it’s just a marker of their age, and their health and the presence of other health problems.”</p>
<p>Stanley S. Liu, a cardiologist at the University of Maryland Medical Center, agrees. “Generally, patients with high blood pressure have a handicap anytime they experience serious illness,” he says. “This is because the organs affected by the serious illness already have compromised blood supplies due to long-standing high blood pressure, which makes them more vulnerable to serious damage.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>He believes this explains in part why many people experience severe disease or die, rather than the cause being “something new or different about covid-19 itself,” he says. “I am more worried about the link between hypertension and problems in every organ system with a blood supply than I am about hypertension and covid-19 itself.”</p>
<p>For now, experts agree that hypertension patients should continue with their drug regimens, as the current research concludes they pose no additional harm when it comes to covid-19. Studies have found no link between the medications and the risk of developing covid-19, or experiencing more severe symptoms, or that other blood pressure medications, such as calcium channel blockers, beta blockers and thiazide diuretics, raise the risks.</p>
<p>(The authors of another study that reached similar conclusions recently retracted their research following public concerns about the quality of the database they used.)</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Robert Carey, a cardiovascular endocrinologist who is dean emeritus of the University of Virginia’s School of Medicine, says researchers are still studying whether patients on the drugs do fare better than those who don’t take them. He points out that the drugs help reduce chronic inflammation, a condition that can lead to serious health dangers.</p>
<p>“Hypertension is characterized by inflammation in blood vessels,” he says. “A viral infection, of course, also has inflammation as its main manifestation, in this case in the lungs.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, numerous additional studies are gearing up or are already underway to seek answers to these questions and others. Researchers also are looking at the potential effect on covid-19 of blood thinners, statins, which lower cholesterol, antiplatelets, which prevent blood clots, and medications that lower triglycerides, a type of fat found in the blood that — in excess — can contribute to heart disease.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>They also are studying other types of blood pressure drugs.</p>
<p>Researchers at Johns Hopkins’s Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, for example, recently reported preliminary findings that suggest another blood pressure drug, Prazosin, an alpha blocker that relaxes blood vessels, targets what is known as cytokine storm, a syndrome that involves an extreme inflammatory response that afflicts older covid-19 patients with underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>It is associated with severe disease and an increased risk of death. They plan to conduct a larger clinical trial to determine whether early administration of the drug will reduce deaths among infected patients.</p>
<p>The University of Maryland plans to examine data from patient registries to learn more about the links between severe covid-19 complications, hypertension and diabetes, and also plans to study genetics involved in cardiovascular disease to see whether certain genes predispose a patient to greater risks.</p>
<p>UC San Diego scientists are planning to conduct a study to learn more about whether the drugs have a beneficial effect on patients with the disease.</p>
<p>University of Pennsylvania researchers also recently launched an international, multisite study to find out more about how ACE inhibitors and ARBS affect the covid-19 disease. They are cautious about the drugs’ effects until they finish their research.</p>
<p>“We have reason to think they may be helpful, and we have reason to think they might be harmful,” says Jordana B. Cohen, assistant professor in the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine, one of the principal investigators. “We really don’t know.”</p>
<p>Her co-principal investigator, Julio Chirinos, agrees.</p>
<p>“They may help the virus. They may help the body. Or they may do nothing at all,” he says. “We need to find the answers. But until we do, there is no reason to stop taking these drugs.”</p>
<p>Carey agrees, saying the most important thing hypertensive patients can do during the pandemic is to keep their blood pressure under control.

There Will Be Blood — Peter Mertens, Former Head of Audi R&amp;D: “We All Did Sleep”</p>
<p>June 13th, 2020 by Alex Voigt</p>
<p>I write this article full of anger as a German about the German auto industry.</p>
<p>The octopus is one of the most fascinating and intelligent animals in our seas. Scientists predict that if they didn’t die that early after the new generation is born, because of their ability to learn, they would be “the humans of the sea,” dominating all other sea animals large and small, just like humans do on soil.</p>
<p>An octopus has 8 arms, hence the name starting with “octo,” and each arm has its own little brain managing that arm. These 8 brains communicate with a central brain and scientists have not yet figured out how that all works and why their arms don’t get in the way.</p>
<p>The incumbent auto industry trying to develop a competitive fully electric vehicle (BEV) has exactly the same challenge, but it is not doing as well. Their “arms” are still getting in its way, are not coordinated, and exhaust the available energy in a vehicle too quickly.</p>
<p>Traditionally, over recent decades and since software started to dominate more and more devices in our lives, each little automotive function received its dedicated chip, software, and related computer, but the different parts of the car still don’t talk to each other. That’s how the industry developed in the last, say, 40 years.</p>
<p>Consider the octopus arms in my analogy to be different functionality segments and sub-systems in a vehicle. Each has a well-defined purpose, and as the ICE (internal combustion engine) industry has grown up and real new innovation does not happen anymore, each of these sub-systems has been outsourced to suppliers who offer it better, faster, and with lower costs. 90% of all Volkswagen software today is outsourced. A true win-win situation. Welcome to the world of low vertical integration and low pace of innovation.</p>
<p>A few hundred chips are now separately managing a complex network in your vehicle if you drive a vehicle from one of these automakers, but it’s not coordinated or centralized. Thousands of suppliers are involved, partly working together and partly independent. What all have in common is that all systems are working just in their own little box and do not communicate with a central computer or, to use my analogy again, the central brain of our octopus.</p>
<p>That has been the world the auto industry has been living in undisturbed, until Tesla released its first BEV. Tesla was the first company to release a vehicle custom designed with high vertical integration around a central computer managing all core and side functionality. You cannot see that from the outside, and that’s why people do still not understand why a Tesla is so different. They do typically learn it in the moment they press the accelerator.</p>
<p>That design allows Tesla to change the car’s driving features, range, or acceleration abilities just with new software that enters your vehicle over the air magically like Harry Potter changes reality with his wand in hand and whispering a spell. It reduces costs, makes your vehicle safer, and gives you new functionality and efficiency from someone pressing a button in the Tesla Fremont factory in the USA.</p>
<p>Tesla changed the rules of the auto business, and, with it, everything. They did that with a tool that is called software.</p>
<p>To counter the challenger, the incumbent auto industry activated what it is best at, its supplier base. Automakers asked their thousands of suppliers if they could develop something similar, and the suppliers confirmed convincingly, “yes, we can,” without knowing what they just committed to. 10 years later, the largest and best R&amp;D department in the auto industry has revealed vehicles that are nowhere near the 2012 Tesla Model S.</p>
<p>Peter Mertens, formerly Audi’s Head of R&amp;D and a Board Member, just said in June 2020: “I say this with honesty — in my own responsibility, we all slept to a certain extent, and that’s not only the auto industry, but in particular the suppliers.” He added, “I have made wrong decisions. We have trusted too much that the suppliers will make it happen somehow.”</p>
<p>For 10 years, the supplier base improved and combined their sub-systems in the existing IT and software infrastructure of the vehicles, claiming that if they just try hard enough they can build an integrated digitalized vehicle that can do what a Tesla has been able to do for a decade. The top managers of the German auto industry decided to use their strength from the ICE world to work with existing or new suppliers to try to achieve this.</p>
<p>Suppliers doctored on sub-elements of the vehicle instead of starting a completely new greenfield design with one integrated software architecture around custom-made chips and technology. Their reasoning for that decision was simple: revenue and profits. Congratulations, dear auto managers, you just asked a vampire to manage your blood bank.</p>
<p>At least at that point in time I would have expected that OEM managers in the auto industry would realize that they asked the wrong person for a solution of their problem, their supplier.</p>
<p>Today, all of those managers have left, but their successors still do not dare or do not know how to make a cut with the past and start a revolution. Instead, they’ve continued a slow evolutionary approach they do not have the time for. Time is the most precious and limited asset the auto industry has today. It is an asset you can’t buy with all the money the auto industry has. You will not solve the software issue by simply throwing money and resources at it.</p>
<p>Herbert Diess, CEO Volkswagen Group, just in June 2020: “It will be years before we have reached the necessary level of expertise in software to be able to compete at the forefront.”</p>
<p>“Even today, hardly a line of software code comes from us.”</p>
<p>Without software, you lose the most precious asset you have as a consumer-oriented company: access to your customer.</p>
<p>Without software, you lose the gold of the digital age, customer data.</p>
<p>Without software, you are just what is left, a company assembling low-profit metal boxes assembling company — and low profit metal boxes are an exchangeable commodity.</p>
<p>Having worked 20 years of my life in the software industry, I can confirm that software is not magic, just a technology. To manage software, you need software engineers and a software organization. If you allow hardware managers in a hardware organization to manage your software, how could you possibly expect success?</p>
<p>10 years after the incumbent industry failed to develop working IT and software operating systems for their BEVs, they still repeat the same mistake — outsourcing the piece of technology that is critical for their success, their profits, and their future.</p>
<p>Automotive managers who know how to develop ICE vehicles and who succeeded in their hardware world have been and are still responsible for the software organizations of the e-tron, Taycan, EQC, ID.3, and all the announced BEV concept and models from those companies. The German auto industry gives their most critical new products, which will determine if they survive as companies in their existing structure, to the responsibility of managers who have the least experience and knowledge about their most critical part, the software.</p>
<p>The attempt of the Volkswagen Group to centralize 10,000 IT resources in a new organization to solve the software problems of the ID.3, which 100 — or maybe even 50 — good software engineers could solve, is a testimony to not understanding software.</p>
<p>Herbert Diess lost the important CEO position for the Volkswagen brand because of the software issues with the Golf 8 and ID.3. More managers will lose their responsibility because it’s obvious that they do not know what they do and talk about.</p>
<p>Since their future depends on the software — be it in services, value, or profits — that software group needs to have one of the most powerful positions in the house. The software representative on the Volkswagen board had been promoted in 2019 and is in a weak position without the power and influence required. How can a company be successful if what they will make their main profits with does not have a real say in the decision-making board?</p>
<p>Managers who in their entire life have never written one single line of code nor understand it at all decide on vehicle software that determines the largest share of their profits. In the software industry, 80-90% margin is not unusual, while the auto industry is used to just a few percent. People who do not even know the basic current software languages nor what it means for success, or what good or bad code is, are deciding the big issues. They will not even understand the problem if a software engineer tries to explain it to them. They don’t understand the challenge, and with that are far away from solving it.</p>
<p>German auto industry top managers always proudly stated that they have “gas in their blood” (e.g., Piech or Winterkorn in the past, and today all others). It’s been seen as a statement of being qualified for that top management role. But since no gas is used in the electric world of BEVs anymore, and batteries and code are the critical qualification criteria, how fit are they really for the roles they own?</p>
<p>Do they have electricity and code in their blood? They don’t, and therefore, they are not qualified, because they don’t understand software and batteries or electric drivetrains. If they did, why do they deliver underwhelming BEVs?</p>
<p>If the justification for a top manager in the old ICE world is to have been a toolmaker or similar at the start of their career, today, using the same standards, a top manager now should have been a software coder at the start of his or her career. If you don’t understand what your organization does, you are not only obsolete, but you are a risk for the future of the company.</p>
<p>After I wrote this article, Herbert Diess lost his Volkswagen CEO role because of the software disaster with the Golf 8 and the ID.,3 but what changes with the new CEO? Does Brandstätter know software? Did they make the decision for the new CEO dependent on software or battery expertise?</p>
<p>Run a job assessment with all top managers at VW, Audi, Porsche, BMW, and Daimler tomorrow and ask them to code a small game or a simple but working virus. If they are not able to do so, fire them immediately, because they are not fit for the job. How many will be left?</p>
<p>It may sound like a radical measure, but isn’t it more radical to risk losing thousands of jobs instead because the top management is incompetent and unable to understand even the basics of what the value of the company is about?</p>
<p>Why shouldn’t the CEOs of the German automakers be able to do what a 12-year old, now CEO of Tesla, did in 1984?! If you are a CEO of a German automotive company:</p>
<p>“Dear CEO, here is your challenger! Can you as a grown up do the same and prove you understand?”</p>
<p><a href="https://blastar-1984.appspot.com">https://blastar-1984.appspot.com</a></p>
<p>With 12 years of age in 1984, Elon Musk programmed BlaStar.</p>
<p>As a shareholder of one of the above companies, you want managers who understand their business. I believe that is a basic, justified, and elementary request. The shareholders have understood that and value Tesla already as the most valuable automaker in the world, higher than Volkswagen, BMW, and Daimler combined. One of the reasons for that is the software know-how that is reflected in the future profits, and profits are what a company’s valuation is about.</p>
<p>The remaining options are simple, either you exchange the top managers with people who know their business or you risk losing it all.</p>
