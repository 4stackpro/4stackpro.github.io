European Union leaders gather by video conference on Thursday in a meeting likely to see a showdown over the issue of common debt issuance or eurobonds as extra financial firepower to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Nine euro zone countries, including Ireland, have appealed for the common debt instrument to mitigate the economic damage from the crisis, which economists warn is causing a shock of historic scale.</p>
<p>“We need to work on a common debt instrument issued by a European institution to raise funds on the market on the same basis and to the benefit of all member states, thus ensuring stable long-term financing for the policies required to counter the damages caused by this pandemic,” the letter from the nine states reads.</p>
<p>It was signed by the leaders of Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Slovenia and Ireland – all members of the euro zone.</p>
<p>Some academics argue that issuing common debt would make it cheaper to perform the massive economic stimulus required to address the emergency, as if repayments are guaranteed by the entire euro zone, interest rates will be lower.</p>
<p>There were calls for eurobonds previously during the euro zone debt crisis that followed the global economic crash of 2008, but these were defeated by opposition from northern countries, including Germany and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Dutch finance minister Wopke Hoekstra has indicated the country maintains its opposition to the idea, saying that the relaxation of EU borrowing and spending limits earlier this week should be “adequate” to address the crisis.</p>
<p>Together with the Germans, and probably the Austrians and the Finns, the Dutch are likely to block the move to eurobonds at this stage.</p>
<p>But the unprecedented nature of the pandemic has shaken old certainties. The European Central Bank has announced a plan to buy €750 billion in additional bonds to contain the financial fallout, and on Wednesday gave itself an unprecedented level of flexibility to support individual countries.

<h3 id="nine-member-states-ask-for-eurobonds-to-face-coronavirus-crisis">Nine member states ask for eurobonds to face coronavirus crisis</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/michel-1-800x450.jpg" alt="img">
Nine eurozone countries sent a letter on Wednesday (25 March) to the President of the EU Council, Charles Michel, asking for a common debt instrument to mitigate the damage caused by the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>“We need to work on a common debt instrument issued by a European institution to raise funds on the market on the same basis and to the benefits of all member states, thus ensuring stable long-term financing for the policies required to counter the damages caused by this pandemic,” reads the letter, circulated on Twitter.</p>
<p>The letter is signed by the leaders of nine countries – Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Slovenia and Ireland – all members of the euro area.</p>
<p>The signatories said the case for such a common instrument is strong “since we are all facing a symmetric external shock, for which no country bears responsibility, but whose negative consequences are endured by all.”</p>
<p>“And we are collectively accountable for an effective and united European response. This common debt instrument should have sufficient size and long maturity to be fully efficient and avoid roll-over risks now as in the future,” the letter adds.</p>

<p>Funds collected will be targeted to finance in all member states the necessary investments in the healthcare system and temporary policies to protect our economies and social model, the communication explains.</p>
<p>“In the same spirit of efficiency and solidarity, we could explore other tools like specific funding for Corona-related spending in the EU budget, at least for the years 2020 and 2021, beyond the announcements already made by the Commission,” the letter reads.</p>
<p>“By giving a clear message that we are facing this unique shock all together, we would strengthen the EU and the Economic and Monetary Union and, most importantly, we would provide the strongest message to our citizens about European determined cooperation and resolve to provide an effective and united response,” the leaders emphasised.</p>
<p>The Eurogroup discussed on Tuesday (24 March) what instruments Europe could deploy to release the fiscal stimulus and restart the economy, as the bloc is expected to suffer a severe recession.</p>
<p>The package will be presented to the leaders on Thursday and they will decide the shape and size of the European fiscal response, on top of the national packages already adopted.</p>
<p>Both Eurogroup chief Mario Centeno and the Commissioner for Economy, the Italian Paolo Gentiloni, agreed that the possibility of issuing joint debt, or ‘coronabonds’ is still on the table.</p>
<p>However, Northern countries, notably Germany and the Netherlands, have been staunch opponents of the eurobonds.

<h3 id="dutch-firm-on-eurobonds-eu-ministers-to-meet-again-in-two-weeks">Dutch firm on eurobonds: EU ministers to meet again in two weeks</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.dutchnews.nl/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/dutch-and-European-flag.jpg" alt="img">
The Netherlands is opposed to issuing eurobonds as a way to soften the impact of coronavirus on the worst affected countries, prime minister Mark Rutte told reporters following Thursday’s online meeting of the European Council.</p>
<p>‘I cannot foresee any circumstances in which the Netherlands will accept eurobonds,’ Rutte is quoted as saying. ‘This is against the design of the EMU.’</p>
<p>EU leaders failed during the four-hour meeting to reach agreement about a package of economic support measures to soften the blow coronavirus has dealt to Europe’s economies. They have agreed to meet again in two weeks.</p>
<p>Italy, Spain and France are among the countries keen to issue eurobonds and urged their introduction earlier this week. The Netherlands and Germany are strongly opposed. Both countries are seen as safe investments and enjoy low borrowing costs, and, according to the Financieele Dagblad, they fear that issuing eurobonds will impact on their status.</p>
<p>Spirit</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, criticised member states for looking out for themselves.</p>
<p>‘When Europe really needed an all-for-one spirit, too many initially gave an only-for-me response,’ she said at a meeting of the European parliament.</p>
<p>‘But things are now improving. The free movement of goods and services is the only way to get supplies to where they are needed. Putting barriers between us simply makes no sense. Europe’s citizens will remember the decisions and actions we take today.’
