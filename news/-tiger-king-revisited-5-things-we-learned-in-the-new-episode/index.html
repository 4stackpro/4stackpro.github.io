This includes spoilers for the new follow-up special for “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness”</p>
<p>Hey, all you cool cats and kittens! Inspired by the phenomenal response to its bizarre documentary series “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness,” Netflix dropped a new “after-show” episode on Sunday called “The Tiger King and I,” hosted by the comic actor Joel McHale.</p>
<p>Anyone in search of a serious critical evaluation of the criminal case against the flamboyant Joe Maldonado-Passage, better known as Joe Exotic — including his part in the attempted murder-for-hire of Carole Baskin — might want to look elsewhere. However, if all you want is a brief reunion with some of the zookeeper’s colorful colleagues, pull up a chair. Here’s what did and what didn’t happen when Erik Cowie, John Reinke, John Finlay, Kelci Saffery, Joshua Dial, Rick Kirkham and Lauren and Jeff Lowe reconvened to offer their thoughts on the dethroned, declawed Tiger King and the most-watched documentary — so far — of the quarantine era.</p>
<p>Problematic Portrayals</p>
<p>Despite criticism that Saffery, a trans man better known as Saff, had been misgendered in the Netflix documentary, Saffery himself was indifferent. “I don’t think it bothered me as much as it bothered everybody else,” he said. “I didn’t really pay it any mind.”</p>
<p>More upset were Dial; Joe Exotic’s campaign manager during a quixotic run for governor of Oklahoma; the zoo worker Cowie; and Maldonado-Passage’s former husband Finlay, who all objected to insinuations that they used drugs, specifically methamphetamine.

<h3 id="tiger-king-is-netflix-really-planning-a-surprise-new-episode">Tiger King: Is Netflix Really Planning a Surprise New Episode?</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5e85ff95ac720b00089fd032/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/true-crime-legal-cases-ss05.jpg" alt="img">
There are at least three key takeaways a viewer can glean from Tiger King. One: Gay polygamist private-zoo-owning Oklahoman country music one-time presidential candidates do exist. Two: There are more tigers in this country than one could have ever imagined. Three: You probably shouldn’t take anything that Jeff Lowe, the big-cat enthusiast who’s taken over Joe Exotic’s zoo, says at face value.</p>
<p>And yet over the weekend, Lowe made a very intriguing claim, one that Tiger King fans may hope to be true. In a Cameo (natch!) for Los Angeles Dodgers player Justin Turner (a little less natch), Lowe said the streamer is cooking up one more episode of the addictive docuseries.</p>
<p>“Netflix is adding one more episode,” Lowe said in the Cameo, which Turner posted on Twitter Saturday. “It will be on next week. They’re filming here tomorrow.” Lowe is joined in the video by his wife, Lauren Lowe, who also says the Netflix episode will be dropping soon.</p>
<p>But…is this true? Representatives for Netflix have not yet responded to Vanity Fair’s request for comment, so Lowe’s claim hasn’t been confirmed. However, dropping an additional episode of a popular series isn’t beyond the norm for the streamer. After the success of reality dating show Love Is Blind, for example, the streamer put together a titillating reunion episode. Oprah Winfrey also hosted a postshow interview with the cast of When They See Us, Ava DuVernay’s Emmy-winning series about the Exonerated Five.</p>
<p>Yet that was all pre-coronavirus, long before Netflix was forced to shut down production on all its upcoming movies and TV shows and set up an emergency relief fund for creatives impacted by the loss of business. How could a crew film new Tiger King material? Could they do it while practicing proper social distancing? And who is thinking of the tigers?! As we learned over the weekend, the endangered cats can contract coronavirus themselves—because our pandemic nightmare isn’t horrible enough already.</p>
<p>So, you know, cast a dubious eye on Lowe’s claims—but also don’t be surprised if Netflix does drop some kind of new episode in order to keep feeding the beast, perhaps assembled from previously excised Tiger King footage. After all, directors Rebecca Chaiklin and Eric Goode clearly had tons and tons of material to work with, so there’s probably a lot of cursed, juicy, terrible stuff they had to leave on the cutting-room floor…until now, perhaps.</p>

<h3 id="heres-whats-in-tiger-kings-bonus-episode">Here’s What’s In ‘Tiger King’s Bonus Episode</h3>
<p><img src="https://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2020/04/tiger-king.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=0&amp;zc=1&amp;s=0&amp;a=t&amp;q=89" alt="img">
As promised by Jeff Lowe and Netflix (in that order), there is now officially an eighth episode of Tiger King available for streaming. Titled The Tiger King and I, it’s kind of like one of those The Men Tell All specials they air after a season of The Bachelor, only everyone is interviewed remotely because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The 40-minute bonus show is hosted by Joel McHale of The Soup and Community. He interviews eight Tiger King alums for about five minutes each. The subjects he speaks to are Erik Cowie, Jeff and Lauren Lowe, John Reinke, Saff, Joshua Dial, John Finlay, and Rick Kirkham. Joe Exotic himself is not involved. (He’s currently in prison, which makes reality TV appearances a little tricky.) Carole Baskin and her husband aren’t featured either. And Tiger King’s directors, Eric Goode and Rebecca Chaiklin, aren’t credited on The Tiger King and I.</p>
<p>Is it worth watching anyway? If you loved Tiger King and you’re curious what the folks listed above thought of the series and how they’re grappling with their sudden fame, sure. Even over Skype interviews, the cast’s charisma and personalities shine through. And there are some interesting tidbits sprinkled throughout. Rick Kirkham, the reality producer who tried to make a Joe Exotic TV show, reveals that the self-proclaimed “Tiger King” is, in fact, deathly afraid of lions and tigers. Kirkham also has the single funniest line in the episode; now living in Norway, Kirkham jokes “I can’t even take a walk down the fjord without someone walking their dog walking by pointing and going ‘That’s him!’”</p>
<p>Joel McHale is a funny guy, and he does his best to keep the interviews light. But there was some really dark stuff in Tiger King, and The Tiger King and I gets a little uncomfortable when McHale tries to pivot from cracking jokes about Joe Exotic’s mullet to asking Josh Dial about witnessing a man shooting himself in the head.</p>
<p>All in all, The Tiger King and I is a decent after show for a fascinating documentary series. It definitely has some holes; without Joe Exotic or Carole Baskin, it feels a lot less essential than it would have been with their participation. Still, if you loved the series and wished there was more, this will scratch that itch a little. If you want to watch it, you’ll find it with the rest of Tiger King on Netflix.
