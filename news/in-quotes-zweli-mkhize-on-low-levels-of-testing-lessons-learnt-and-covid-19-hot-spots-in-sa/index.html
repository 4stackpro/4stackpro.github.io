Health minister Zweli Mkhize on Tuesday spoke on Radio 702 about the progress made by his department in fighting the spread of coronavirus in SA.</p>
<p>He addressed concerns about low testing, particularly in high density areas, dealing with asymptomatic individuals and the capacity of testing laboratories.</p>
<p>SA has 2,415 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 27 coronavirus-related deaths, TimesLIVE reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Here are important takeouts from what the minister said:</p>
<p>Low testing &amp; spread of Covid-19</p>
<p>“We deal with concrete numbers of people tested but whether this represents a uniform distribution of tests and positive cases in the whole community is impossible to tell because the distortion comes from the fact that people who came forward, were those who had money to go to private doctors.”</p>
<p>Testing in hot spots not reflective of countrywide spread</p>
<p>“We&rsquo;re also going to areas which we are targeting and those we test might be people who are in areas we consider to be hot spots, mainly because we&rsquo;ve identified cases or contacts in those areas and we think they fall into a description of high-risk groups. But this doesn&rsquo;t give the full picture of what is happening in the rest of the country.”</p>
<p>April 18, a time to reflect</p>
<p>“The 18th of April is about looking back at the past three weeks to say what trends can we work out, but I think what we have seen is an indication that with determination and unity of South African people, it&rsquo;s possible to actually make the outbreak behave in the way that we determine, rather than following the other countries, because we have had the advantage of learning from them.”

Dr Zweli Mkhize: A brief profile on the man leading SA&rsquo;s fight against Covid-19</p>
<p>Share this article: Share Tweet Share Share Share Email</p>
<p>Johannesburg - Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize has been at the forefront of South Africa&rsquo;s fight against the Covid-19 coronavirus and his leadership during the crisis has been commended by many. Mkhize has been commended for his skills and transparent communication which has brought relief to some as the cases of confirmed infections have continued to rise in the country. There has also been some measure of criticism. Here&rsquo;s a brief history of the man leading South Africa&rsquo;s fight against the Covid-19 coronavirus: Mkhize&rsquo;s appointment as health minister by President Cyril Ramaphosa in May 2019 came as no surprise to many has he holds a degree in the medical field. He previously served as the minister of cooperative governance and traditional affairs briefly from 2018 until the 2019 general elections.</p>
<p>Before that, he had served as the ANC treasurer-general based at the party&rsquo;s headquarters at Luthuli House. He had held the position since 2012 until the party&rsquo;s elective conference in December 2017.</p>
<p>Mkhize had also served as KwaZulu-Natal premier from May 2009 until 2012.</p>
<p>He has also served two terms as ANC chairperson in the province in 2008.</p>
<p>The minister had also served as MEC for Finance and Economic Development in KZN since 2004. He was also the chairperson of the ANC&rsquo;s National Education and Health subcommittee.</p>
<p>Mkhize was the longest-serving MEC for Health, having served in the position in KZN for over a decade.</p>
<p>He also served two four-year terms as chancellor of the University of KwaZulu-Natal.</p>
<p>Like many political struggle activists, Mkhize had started his activism at a young age. He was born and raised in Willowfountain in Pietermaritzburg and obtained a medical degree at the age of 26 at the University of Natal.</p>
<p>He worked as an intern at McCord Hospital and was then later employed at Edendale Hospital in KZN in the early 1980s. He was later forced to flee into exile due to his political activities. His time in exile was spent in Swaziland and later in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Mkhize returned to the country in 1991 and served as a member of the ANC&rsquo;s national health secretariat, Parliament&rsquo;s website states.

<h3 id="government-will-help-private-hospitals-with-protective-gear-mkhize">Government will help private hospitals with protective gear: Mkhize</h3>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/b0aCuRBcOvESMr7WHYok0ugCmv4Yc_QiBrwyjwyIDxRono1cLoPAlvYCXhYe9voXeopfI2nAVnAI1BRUNJFhwYc=s1000" alt="img">
The government will assist private hospitals to procure protective gear in a bid to arrest the large amount of infections recorded at those facilities in recent weeks.</p>
<p>This is according to Dr Zweli Mkhize, who also warned that South Africans who refused to stay at home were undermining the efforts of the nationwide lockdown.</p>
<p>The health minister made the comments during a press conference on Wednesday, where he announced that the country now has 2,506 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and seven additional deaths, bringing the toll to 34.</p>
<p>Gauteng remains the epicentre with 930 cases, while the Western Cape has 657 and KwaZulu-Natal has 519. The Eastern Cape has seen a significant increase in cases, which now stand at 199.
