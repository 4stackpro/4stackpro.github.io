<p>Recent years have seen more and more national and international awards emerging for literary works in Arabic, including the annual International Prize for Arabic Fiction (the “Arabic Booker Prize”), the Naguib Mahfouz Medal for Literature awarded by the American University in Cairo, and the Sheikh Zayed Book Awards in the UAE recognising works and authors.</p>
<p>The UK-based Saif Ghobash Banipal Prize for Arabic Literary Translation has been awarded every year since 2006 and is different from other prizes in that it recognises specifically translation. It is awarded to what in the opinion of the judges is the best literary translation each year from Arabic into English. The Prize’s Website adds that it is “given to a published translation in English of a full-length imaginative and creative Arabic work of literary merit published after, or during, the year 1967 and first published in English translation in the year prior to the award.”</p>
<p>Previous winners have included Farouk Abdel-Wahab for his version of Egyptian author Khairy Shalaby’s The Lodging House in 2007 and Roger Allen for his version of Moroccan writer Bensalem Himmich’s A Muslim Suicide in 2012.</p>
<p>This year’s Prize, awarded in London in February, went to a translation by Leri Price of Syrian writer Khaled Khalifa’s novel Death is Hard Work. Khalifa is already well-known to English-language readers, since earlier novels, perhaps particularly No Knives in the Kitchens of this City, have also been translated and enthusiastically received. He has become one of the best-known chroniclers of the ongoing crisis in Syria along with fellow novelist Samar Yazbek and commentator Yassin Haj Saleh.</p>
<p>However, the Banipal Prize, like other awards, is not, or should not be, a winner-takes-all contest, since its longlist and shortlist, published in the run-up to the final decision of the judges, contain intriguing samples of the range and variety of the Arabic literary works making it into English translation each year and are significant tests of their quality.</p>
<p>This year’s shortlist included Jokes for the Gunmen by Palestinian-Icelandic writer Mazen Maarouf translated into English by Jonathan Wright, Celestial Bodies by Omani novelist Jodha Alharthi translated by Marilyn Booth, and My Name is Adam by Lebanese novelist Elias Khoury translated by Humphrey Davies. Jokes for the Gunmen and Celestial Bodies are early career novels (the former is a collection of linked short stories), whereas My Name is Adam is an addition to an already distinguished body of work that has seen Khoury publish some 15 novels, among them the critically acclaimed Gate of the Sun.</p>
<p>This was made into a film directed by Egyptian filmmaker Yousry Nasrallah in 2004, and its subsequent English translation, also by Davies, was awarded the inaugural 2006 Banipal Prize.</p>
<p>While the first two novels may have been firsts for their writers, they were far from being so for their translators, both of whom have distinguished track records. Wright has translated well over a dozen Arabic literary titles into English and has previously won the Banipal Prize on two occasions, the first for his translation of Egyptian novelist Youssef Zeidan’s Azazeel in 2013, also the 2009 winner of the International Prize for Arabic Fiction, and the second for his translation of Kuwaiti novelist Saud Alsanousi’s The Bamboo Stalk in 2016, which earlier won the International Prize for Arabic Fiction in 2013.</p>
<p>Booth, also an academic at Oxford University in the UK, has translated many works of modern Arabic literature into English, perhaps one of the best known being her translation of Girls of Riyadh by Saudi novelist Raja Alsanea, which gave rise to some controversy between writer and translator when it first appeared. She has produced many translations of works by contemporary women authors, including several by Lebanese novelist Hoda Barakat and by Egyptian writer Nawal al-Saadawi, and is the translator of Egyptian novelist Latifa al-Zayyat’s classic novel The Open Door.</p>
<p>Davies is a veteran translator, responsible for the translation of contemporary popular novels such as Egyptian novelist Alaa al-Aswany’s Yacoubian Building, as well as heavyweight older materials, such as his inventive translations of 19th-century Lebanese writer Ahmed al-Shidyaq’s Leg over Leg and 17th-century Egyptian writer Yusuf al-Shirbini’s Brains Confounded by the Ode of Abu Shaduf Expounded in 2016 and 2019, respectively.</p>
<p>Price, the winner of this year’s Banipal Prize for her translation, thus found herself in very distinguished company.</p>
<p>JOKES FOR THE GUNMEN: Maazen Maarouf’s Jokes for the Gunmen, published under the same title in Arabic in Beirut in 2015, appears in a fresh and idiomatic translation by Jonathan Wright in an English edition from British publisher Granta Books.It is a book marked by civil conflict, and, though Maarouf is probably too young to remember much of it (he was born in 1978), also the Lebanese civil war. Most of the violence is indirect or represented in the form of “jokes,” with the gunmen of the title being engaged in a series of surreal encounters with the book’s young narrator in linked short stories.“That was my little mission in the war,” he explains in the first story. “When the fighting was intense and the gunmen were using heavy weapons such as mortars and RPGs, my terrified mother and brother would lie flat on the floor in the corridor… while I stood near the television,” tending a tiny pepper plant. “Just as I didn’t understand what was happening in the neighbourhood, I didn’t understand why my father had chosen a pepper plant,” he adds.Later, there is a deal with a group of gunmen in order to gain their protection. “There was always a group of young men standing near the school,” the narrator explains. “Five or six of them. We used to call them the ‘hippopotamuses’… They were known to be quiet but also vicious, and they worked by the hour.”Other than the gunmen, glimpsed at checkpoints or loitering in the streets, the characters are restricted to the narrator’s immediate family. His father disappears after what may be a botched kidnapping, and his uncle “dies three times in the space of a week.” Later, the father reappears, this time in a shady bar. “It was one level below ground. Long and narrow, it was shaped rather like a rectangular biscuit,” he explains. “My father was the gramophone operator in the bar… He spent hours and hours standing behind the bar, turning the handle of a Berliner gramophone from 1900 – there was no electricity and the bar was lit by candles.”The bar is destroyed in a bombing, rather like the cinema in the next short story. “When one of the occupying army’s tanks shelled the projection room at the top end of the auditorium, most of the families [taking shelter there] gathered on the stage and hid behind the curtain,” the narrator explains. Perhaps the deadpan manner should not be confused with humour, however black, even if much of what goes on seems to be some kind of monstrous joke.“I don’t have a sense of humour, to be honest,” the narrator says in a story called “The Angel of Death,” an odd admission in a book of jokes. “And I don’t understand why people smile.”Also from the Levant, this time Palestine as seen from New York, is My Name is Adam, the first volume in the Children of the Ghetto series by Lebanese novelist Elias Khoury in a handsome edition published by MacLehose. The novel was shortlisted for the International Prize for Arabic Fiction in 2017 and appeared in Arabic in 2012 under the same title.Khoury is at the other end of his career to Maarouf and is one of the elder statesmen of the contemporary Arabic novel. His intention in this book seems to be to retell the history and aftermath of the Nakba, the loss of Palestine in 1948, through memory fragments brought together in the consciousness of a single character whose “name is Adam.”These reflections are characterised by their range, taking in not only events in Lydda (Lod) in 1948 and the expulsion of the narrator’s family during the establishment of the state of Israel, but also much that has happened since. The book includes a glossary that tracks down some of the many references, but Davies and his editors have employed a light touch. The novel may be a challenging read for those not familiar with at least some of the events that float in and out of the text.Many of these are public, while some are more like private jokes, like, for example, when the narrator attends a screening of Gate of the Sun only to note the presence of its director and author sitting next to him. From the modern literary canon, Egyptian writer Taha Hussein makes an entrance, as do the Palestinians Ghassan Kanafani, Jabra Ibrahim Jabra, and Mahmoud Darwish, introduced as suggesting possible ways of approaching Palestinian experience. From the classical canon, there are mentions of Waddah al-Yaman, Imru al-Qays, al-Maari, al-Jahiz, and many others, with these being lighted upon as possible sources for a contemporary novel or as a kind of closely woven intertextual backcloth.The novel is framed by the idea of abandoned notebooks produced by its narrator Adam Dannoun while living in New York. Maybe it should be seen as notes towards writing a novel rather than the thing itself, an extended monologue, writing about writing, a meditation on the difficulty of stitching together memories to make a single narrative.“I don’t feel comfortable with messages in literature,” political or otherwise, the narrator writes. “Literature exists without reference to any meaning located outside of it, and I want Palestine to become a text that exists without reference to its current historical condition.”CELESTIAL BODIES: Published in translation by British publisher Sandstone Books, Omani novelist Jokha Alharthi’s Celestial Bodies appeared in Arabic under the different title of “Women of the Moon” in 2010. Its translation by Marilyn Booth won the 2019 Man Booker International Prize.Taking the form of a continuous narrative, though one told in different ways, the novel is divided into short sections headed by the names of different characters. It recounts the lives of a family, particularly three sisters, in the village of Al-Awafi in Oman. Sometimes there is an external narrator, with something like free indirect style being used. Sometimes events are recounted through internal monologue, with the narrative directly reproducing a character’s thoughts.The main impression is one of change over time, with Al-Awafi, like the rest of Oman, being transformed by economic development and the arrival of new patterns of life from abroad. Mayya, for example, one of the sisters, has grown up in a world in which women’s lives are circumscribed by the walls of the family compound, and life-changing decisions, including on marriage, are taken by family members, not by individual women themselves.She marries Abdallah, the son of local “merchant Sulayman,” having not previously seen him before the engagement is announced. Soon, there are three children, London, a daughter, being the first. Perhaps she is named after the English capital as an act of defiance, since, as a relative exclaims, “does anyone name their daughter London? This is the name of a place, my dear, a place that is very far away, in the land of the Christians.”As the daughter grows up, life around her begins to change. “When London graduated from the Medical School at Sultan Qaboos University, she said, papa, I want a BMW,” Abdallah remembers. “And when we moved to our new house [in the capital Muscat], Mayya moved the Farrasha [sewing machine] into the storage room… She was very happy about the move. She didn’t want to remain under her mother’s control for the rest of her life, she said. And when she had Muhammad she stopped sewing.”New pastimes open up, London and her friends being absorbed “in their never-ending expeditions from one mall to the next in her car.” There are new possibilities in business and education. Old family houses are sold, and new apartments obtained, not only in Muscat, but also abroad. The past seems to be receding from present generations, play-stations, BMWs, and consumer goods replacing shopping in traditional village souqs.Booth evokes the atmosphere of Alharthi’s novel by retaining many Arabic expressions, a rough-and-ready contemporary English, sometimes close to slang, coexisting with them. “Maya’s mother was in the room, and she wasn’t pleased. Laysh ya hibbat ayni! My dear woman, why would you want to name her for me?” “She’s forgetting those days when she didn’t even have a dishdasha to cover her body, way back before she married my boy. Ya ayni alayk, you poor boy, my Sanjar. Your luck took a wrong turn with that viper.”Finally, there is Khalifa’s Death is Hard Work translated by Leri Price in an English version that won this year’s Translation Prize. The novel appeared in Arabic under the same title in 2016, and it is published in English by the British literary publisher Faber and Faber, not previously known for publishing Arabic fiction.The framework is a journey from Damascus to Aleppo during the ongoing Syrian Civil War, with the members of an ordinary family, two brothers and a sister, being pushed into taking extraordinary measures in order to carry out their father’s dying wish to be buried in his home district. Along the way there is much to be learned about the workings of the social system in Syria, both under more normal circumstances and during the violence of civil war.Leaving Damascus, there is the first of a series of run-ins with the security forces and the inevitable production of IDs. “When it was their turn at the checkpoint, the agent on duty told Hussein,” one of the brothers, “that the Mukhabarat [intelligence agencies] would have to check their identity cards while he examined the corpse.” Vertiginous amounts of bureaucracy are required in order to obtain the necessary paperwork, first at the civil-records office, then at the central registry, and then at the relevant military hospital.All these steps can be avoided on the payment of a bribe disguised as a “goods-transit agreement.” “The agent gave him a sardonic glance, but they agreed on twenty thousand liras.”On their journey to Aleppo, silence reigns among the family members, each lost in thought about their past and present situation. Abdel-Latif, the father, had retreated into the past during his final years as a way of denying present circumstances. His sons have retreated into private routines designed to put as great a distance as possible between themselves and others.“Thousands of people disappeared without a trace, simply for being born in areas controlled by the opposition… Kidnappings, ransoms, and random arrests were widespread and tit-for-tat responses meant that they only escalated in frequency. People’s movements were tightly controlled. Any error could be costly.” The best strategy for one brother is to “cut short any burgeoning friendships with colleagues… by the time they started furtively discussing indications they had gleaned which pointed to recent regime losses, using codewords familiar to opposition sympathisers, he had already started ignoring them,” the narrator comments.The novel presents a terrifying picture of a Syria in which death, like life, is “hard work.” It makes for a bleak diagnosis in Price’s stylish translation, but also a mesmerising one.</p>

<h3 id="fear-of-a-black-man--by-alex-wheatle">&ldquo;Fear of a Black Man – by Alex Wheatle&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://brixtonblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/20170610-Alex_Wheatle_1K_%C2%A9Kim-Gribbon.jpg" alt="img">
Brixton Blog is grateful to The Bard of Brixton, Alex Wheatle, for allowing us the opportunity to publish this powerful essay that has a direct bearing on current debate and discussion</p>
<p>Alex Wheatle ©Kim Gribbon</p>
<p>It was Brixton 1978. I had taken a 109 bus from Brixton Hill to Brixton High Street en route to my social services offices on Herne Hill Road just off Coldharbour Lane. Having recently arrived from a Surrey children’s home, I was relatively fresh to the racial dynamics in Brixton. Casually dressed in trainers, jeans, t-shirt, anorak and a beige-coloured cloth cap, I enjoyed the sound of reggae music blaring out from cars, houses and ‘Brixton suitcases’ as I always did when I was out and about in Brixton. Within the fifteen minutes it took me to reach my destination, two white women had crossed the road to avoid me and another had clutched her handbag so tightly to her chest I’m sure it left an imprint of the maker’s brand on her clothing. If I ventured further afield to the leafy avenues of Dulwich or the wide pavements of Putney, there was a more than even chance that someone would alert the police about my presence. For young, black male Brixtonians, this was a daily occurrence.</p>
<p>It was the same whenever I browsed in shops. The security guard would move stealthily to ensure that he’d always have me or my friends in his vision. He would flex his fingers, shift his eyes and ready himself for a confrontation. The more criminally minded of my bredrens used this racial profiling to their advantage. They dressed down and entered clothing stores in the West End. They purposefully acted suspiciously and readily accepted the unblinkered attention from security as a white accomplice lifted all manner of garments.</p>
<p>Football hooliganism was at its peak in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was a time when shopkeepers located near to soccer grounds would board up their windows on match days. Local parents instructed their young children to stay indoors. Women were warned to steer clear of the streets. In a weekly ritual, rival supporters clashed in pubs, bars and train stations with crow bars, knuckledusters, bottles and other weapons of choice. Yet the SUS laws, where the police had the powers to arrest an individual if they believed they were about to commit a crime, was never employed against white football supporters en route to a football match. In Brixton, I was once stopped by the police for having an afro comb in my back pocket. According to the arresting officer, it was an offensive weapon and I had behaved menacingly. “What?” I said. “Are you saying I can’t flick out my afro? You gotta be fucking kidding me!”</p>
<p>Inhabiting a black skin was mistrustful enough for them.</p>
<p>These were the days of police intimidation, beatings in cells and forced confessions. No statements or witness accounts were filmed or recorded. I’ve never heard of an account where a black man was assaulted by a single officer whilst in custody – there were always three or more assailants. The mere presence of a black man, perceived by most of white society as wild, violent and sexually dangerous, led to a fear that had to be eradicated.</p>
<p>In 1955, it was this same irrational dread coupled with entrenched racism that led to two white men, Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam, abducting and mutilating the fourteen-year-old black boy, Emmet Till, before shooting him in the head and dropping his body into the Tallahatchie River, Mississippi. The supposed crime that Emmet Till committed was to flirt with Roy Bryant’s white wife, Carolyn.</p>
<p>I have visited Emmet Till’s shrine at the National Museum of African American History in Washington DC. I stood perfectly still as I viewed the original casket Emmet’s body was buried in. Although Emmet’s face was hideously deformed, at his funeral, his mother decided on an open casket so the whole world could witness Emmet’s defacement. I couldn’t help asking myself, ‘what hellish, primal, deep-seated racist fear could cause Bryant and Milam to inflict such appalling injuries on a child?’</p>
<p>A similar trepidation has led to numerous unarmed black men being executed by American policemen. These same officers never seem to be so anxious or trigger-happy when apprehending white murderers who in some instances have slain scores of people. More often than not, they manage to present themselves at court unscarred, unshot and unharmed. The media never labels them terrorists.</p>
<p>Even a silent, still gesture from a black man can terrify fragile white folks.</p>
<p>John Carlos, Tommie Smith, and the Australian Peter Norman on the Olympic podium in 1968</p>
<p>In London, I was fortunate enough to meet one of my boyhood heroes, Tommie Smith, winner of the 200m sprint at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City. In protest against the way Afro-Americans were dehumanised, killed and condemned to poverty in a rabid, racist society, Tommie Smith and his compatriot, John Carlos, marched out shoeless to their medal ceremony in black gloves and black socks. As the US National anthem blared out in the huge stadium, Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised their black-gloved fists in acknowledgement of those who had fought and lost their lives in the struggle. For this act, Mr Avery Brundage, President of the US Olympic Committee, took extreme offence. He immediately suspended Smith and Carlos from the Games and expelled them from the Olympic village. This was the same Avery Brundage who didn’t utter a murmur of dissent amid the mass Nazi saluting at the 1936 Berlin Games.</p>
<p>White America has means of making black men pay for forcing them to face and acknowledge their own atrocities.</p>
<p>Smith and Carlos returned to the US. They struggled financially and initially found it almost impossible to gain meaningful employment. Almost half a century later, Colin Kaepernick, the American footballer, has also discovered that a silent, still gesture, taking a knee as the US National anthem is being played before a game, will destroy his job prospects. As I write, no National Football League franchise has offered him an opportunity to resurrect his career. He was regarded as one of the best quarterbacks of his generation. Oh yes, they’ll always make us pay.</p>
<p>For the black man to be fully accepted, we have to strive to be perfect, compliant and not seen as a threat or an uncomfortable reminder of a genocidal colonial past.</p>
<p>In 1967, Sidney Poitier, the esteemed black actor, starred alongside Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn in the film, Guess Who’s Coming To Dinner, Poitier plays the black fiancé of a young white woman who is presenting him to her parents for the first time. Sidney Poitier’s character, Dr John Wayde Prentice Junior, is an impossibly idealistic man who graduated from a top school, began medical initiatives in Africa, is faultlessly groomed and, wait for it, even refused to partake in premarital sex. I love Sidney Poitier but I detest this movie with a passion because it says to the black man that for white middle class society to accept us, we have in effect, to conduct ourselves like a Godly image only found on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.</p>
<p>In 1981, white alarm reached new heights in the UK when black people held their ‘Day of Action’ march protesting against police apathy and inaction following the New Cross Fire where thirteen young black youngsters lost their lives. Thirteen dead, nothing said we chanted. As we crossed Blackfriars Bridge that day, I witnessed at first hand the growing panic and racial taunts from the police even though the rally was peaceful.</p>
<p>In the present day, I have recognised the same fright in white teachers when black male students banter or argue boisterously in school classrooms and corridors. They overreact and escalate the tension in a way they would never do if they were addressing white boys. Black male pupils are much more likely to be excluded from schools than their white counterparts for the same offence. When black men enter the justice system, they are more likely to receive longer sentences than white men for identical crimes. On first glance, black men are perceived as more of a physical threat to society than any other racial group. The statistics don’t lie.</p>
<p>As an award-winning writer, even I’m not immune to a mild sense of apprehension when I’m speaking at high society venues and prestigious book festivals. Recently, I arrived at a prominent literary festival wearing casual clothes (as mostly every other author does) As I walk into the Green Room, I sense suspicious eyes on me, a sudden alertness and stiffening of shoulders. To date, I’ve been asked if I’m in the band. Do I know where the cloakroom is? Am I aware this is the Green Room and only reserved for writers? Where can I get a drink? This space is not for the public and my favourite, are you lost? On all of these occasions, I detected a small dose of trepidation, an over-compensating smile and an obvious relief when I explain that I’m a writer. I try to be as approachable as I possibly can but sometimes the old rebel in me would like to produce my best Brixton scowl.</p>
<p>When I’m going about my daily business, I sense this unease, this fear of a black man. Simply waiting for my turn at an ATM machine can cause anxious glances over shoulders and a hurried look along the street for potential support. I’m confronted by a similar nervousness when I attempt to gain entry late at night into a club or bar. The eyes betray the bouncers’ thoughts – is this black man here to cause trouble?</p>
<p>I have to peel back the years to try and understand this illogical terror.</p>
<p>Slavemasters excused their abominable behaviour towards their black captives by convincing themselves and others that their slaves were animals. From South Carolina, John C. Calhoun, the 7th Vice President of the United States, said in a famous speech in defending slavery, “Never before has the black race of Central Africa, from the dawn of history to the present day, attained a condition so civilised and so improved, not only physically, but morally and intellectually.”</p>
<p>The implication was blatant. According to John C. Calhoun and his fellow slavery apostles, black people were sub-human.</p>
<p>Articles debating the slavery/antislavery issue were published in the Charleston Mercury. Numerous slaveholders strongly believed that “slavery would liberate Africans from their savage-like ways.”</p>
<p>So my ancestors were granted the status as ‘animal’. This rank has seeped into the consciousness of many ignorant white people over many centuries and decades. It’s taught to their children and passed on to their children’s children. Now, the hatred is whipped out and fanned by right wing media commentators, politicians and social media trolls. The 45thPresident of the United States says they are fine people. It always disturbs me when racists believe they have a license to brand us as monkeys, apes and gorillas, something that is inhumane and not quite civilised. I switch over the TV channel when I’m watching a soccer match and I hear monkey chants whenever a black player nears the ball. For me, the insults dredge up the belief that black people need “slavery to liberate Africans from their savage-like ways…” I’m not apologising for repeating this phrase.</p>
<p>The racist abuse perpetuates the myth that we are untamed, wild and dangerous. Hence the wary glances, the tightening of shoulders and the mild tension in the cheeks as I enter a Green Room at an esteemed literary festival.</p>
<p>My spirit informs me that black people carry a sense of injustice in their bloodline (Rastafarian brethren are always instructing me that the blood remembers) I also believe that those who have greatly benefited from our slave state have this subconscious and wholly conscious dread that one day there will come a reckoning when we will exact a merciless revenge. It’s why in the past our freedom fighters were quickly silenced and executed.</p>
<p>There are numerous slave revolts I could mention that occurred in Jamaica but I’ll relate the story of ‘Tacky’, who was born in my mother’s parish of St Mary. In 1760, Tacky and his band killed their slavemasters and took over a nearby fort that contained guns and ammunition. The British sent in reinforcements, more slaves from adjacent plantations joined the rebellion and the battle raged for a number of days. Tacky was hunted down and finally captured. His severed head was displayed on a long pole in Spanish Town to serve as a warning to others. Rather than return to a slave state, many of Tacky’s followers committed suicide in coastal caves. They didn’t teach me tales like this when I was at school.</p>
<p>Over a hundred years later, a similar fate awaited another Jamaican freedom fighter, Paul Bogle, and he wasn’t even a slave. He was a man of the church. That didn’t save him. No chains on my feet but I’m not free, Bob Marley and the Wailers sang in the early 1970s. The Jamaican reggae icon never killed anyone but the CIA kept a file on him because they knew he had the rhetoric, the intelligence and the power to rouse the black masses. To put it simply, they feared him.</p>
<p>To this day, the message to us is clear: if we see you as a threat, if you force us to confront our vile colonial past, if you dare to question our morality, beliefs and self righteousness, if you light the flame of black consciousness and solidarity, we will find ways to silence you, discredit you and eliminate the way you make your living. Muhammad Ali and Colin Kaepernick can bear witness to that.</p>
<p>In 2001, I published to what I consider my most important novel, East of Acre Lane. It’s set against the backdrop of the 1981 Brixton uprising and brutal police oppression acting under what I regarded as an inherently racist Conservative government. It was critically acclaimed wherever it was reviewed. If I can indulge in a little head-swell for a moment, here are three of them:</p>
<p>…Treading a Dubliners-esque terrain which swallows up the Brixton landscape, the novel spits out the simmering frustrations of being young, black and British during the Thatcher years…Wheatle retells a shaping episode in recent British history and tellingly captures as much of today’s mood as he does of an unforgettable 1981.</p>
<p>Pride Magazine</p>
<p>…A vibrant and highly evocative insight into one of the most explosive periods in London’s history.</p>
<p>Scotland on Sunday</p>
<p>…Wheatle has written a hard-hitting novel which is an incendiary reminder of one of the most explosive events in London’s post-war history…</p>
<p>Big Issue</p>
<p>After assessing my reviews, please forgive me if expected to be feted at literary festivals, named on shortlists for book prizes, my text to be included as essential reading on the national curriculum and serialisation rights on BBC radio. Yes, I did dream. For a year or two, it was even optioned by the BBC as a potential drama for television. I went to my bed in those days thinking good things. Gosh, how naive was I.</p>
<p>None of the above happened.</p>
<p>I believe I was seen as a threat, a black man who made white people feel uncomfortable by my presence and the words I print on the page. East of Acre Lane was too incendiary. Amidst descriptions of vivid racial violence, it contained depictions of a young black male wanting to kill police officers. I guess I didn’t quite tick the boxes like Dr John Wayde Prentice Junior in Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner. I didn’t graduate from a top school, attended Oxbridge or any other top-ranking university. Alex Wheatle’s an angry, uneducated black man from Brixton who was raised in a children’s home. What true artistic merit can flow from his unschooled pen? It’s better to promote black narrative texts that are palatable to sensitive white tongues.</p>
<p>If we can push my novel aside for a moment and consider why hasn’t one of the most significant events in black British history ever been dramatised for UK terrestrial television?</p>
<p>Since the publication of East of Acre Lane, it’s only through sheer persistence, fierce stubbornness and what talent I possess that I have managed to fashion a career in this old writing game, for so long the domain of white middle-class men. I’m still driven by this overriding urge to write our narrative.</p>
<p>I yearn for the day, when I can walk into an establishment, wearing my casual clothes, my red, gold and green shoulder bag, listen to Dennis Brown on my headphones and not be given a flicker of attention or perceived as the slightest of threats. I don’t think that day will come in my lifetime.</p>
<p>For the unaccountable atrocities that my ancestors had to endure, it is me who should cower in the presence of white men. It is me who should look up and down the street for potential support in case of an unprovoked assault and me who should be mistrustful of a paler skin. But it is me who is still seen as a menace to society.</p>
<p>Fear of a Black Man is taken from SAFE, an anthology on the Black British male experience, edited by Derek Owusu.</p>
<p>Cane Warriors, Alex Wheatle’s latest book, will be published on 1 October

<h3 id="stephen-runge-honoured-with-mount-allisons-2020-paul-paré-medal">&ldquo;Stephen Runge honoured with Mount Allison’s 2020 Paul Paré Medal&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thechronicleherald.ca/media/photologue/photos/cache/MountA-Pare-Award_medium.jpg" alt="img">
A A</p>
<p>SACKVILLE, N.B. — Stephen Runge, a celebrated pianist, professor, and department head of Mount Allison’s Department of Music is the 2020 recipient of the university’s Paul Paré Medal. Mount Allison’s pre-eminent award for faculty, the medal is presented annually to a faculty member at Mount Allison who has exemplified outstanding teaching, research, scholarship, and/or creative activities, and who has an exemplary record of service.</p>
<p>“It’s an honour to be recognized like this by my colleagues and students,” Runge said in a news release. “I’m very humbled to receive the Paul Paré Medal this year.”</p>
<p>Mount Allison provost and vice-president Jeff Ollerhead said his combination of research, creative work, and teaching is commendable.</p>
<p>“Being a music professor and active performer is an incredible balancing act. Stephen Runge’s dedication to his students and colleagues as a teacher and mentor reflects the very qualities the Paul Paré Medal seeks to recognize,” said Ollerhead. “I would like to congratulate him on this latest achievement.”</p>
<p>Runge has taught at Mount Allison since 2007. An award-winning pianist, he teaches applied music lessons (one-on-one performance classes for students), as well as classes in collaborative piano and pedagogy, keyboard literature, and music history and literature.</p>
<p>Entering his third term as department head, a position he’s held since 2014, Runge oversees many of the administrative duties of the department, from course offerings to auditions for incoming students, and an event docket that sees over 80 performances in the department over the course of an average academic year. He oversees scheduling of these events as well as the management of initiatives such as the annual Bragg Artist-in-Residence program, welcoming renowned musicians to campus each year for a week-long residency, as well as the annual Summer Music Academy, a program for high school music students. The summer academy will be offered virtually in 2020.</p>
<p>Runge is a regular on the Brunton Auditorium stage and other stages across the country. He has released four albums, with a fifth one being released this year. This album will focus on British Art song with noted countertenor Daniel Cabena. He has also served as a juror for both the Juno Awards (classical album of the year) and the East Coast Music Awards on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>From Regina, Runge started playing piano at the age of six. After several years of teaching piano lessons to beginning students while in high school and during his undergraduate studies, he first taught music at the university level while a graduate student, which influenced his decision to become a professor as well as a performer.</p>
<p>“I always enjoyed performing but didn’t really consider academia as a career until grad school,” says Runge. “But working with students is really one of the best parts of my job. Seeing their growth and development from first year to their final recitals is very rewarding and one of the best things about teaching.”

<h3 id="here-are-some-of-the-inspiring-women-of-the-civil-rights-movement-you-really-need-to-know">&ldquo;Here are some of the inspiring women of the Civil Rights movement you really need to know&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://gl-images.condecdn.net/image/0nkMO2zgKNZ/crop/1440/0.5235602094240838/f/gettyimages-515350398_sf.jpg" alt="img">
The moment we are living through now, of a renewed fervour for racial justice, is one of the most pivotal series of global protests we’ve seen in the Civil Rights movement. This is a movement which has been fighting globally for the rights of people of colour for centuries; from abolition to desegregation, from the Black Panthers to Black Lives Matter.</p>
<p>It’s a movement that spans hundreds of years of conflicting approaches, battles, debates and characters and which also features some powerhouse women who often put their very lives on the line in the fight for equality and freedom.</p>
<p>Here is a by no means exhaustive list of some of the most inspirational women of the civil rights movement, whose work tore down monumental walls of oppression and many who are still fighting for justice and equality today.</p>

<p>Harriet Tubman, 1822-1913</p>
<p>Harriet was born into slavery in Maryland in 1822. She escaped in 1849 but returned 13 times to free her family, friends and many others slaves using a system of safe houses and passages that became known as the Underground Railroad. She was so successful, and famously “never lost a passenger” that she was given the nickname “Moses.” When the American Civil War broke out, she served as an armed scout and spy for the Union Army and dedicated her later life to getting women the vote. She dedicated her life to the pursuit of freedom and equality and was generally one hell of a badass, dying at the ripe old age of 91; a free woman and an icon.</p>

<p>Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander, 1898-1989</p>
<p>Sadie was born in Philadelphia in 1898, 33 years after the abolition of slavery in the United States, though she was by no means born into a society of racial equality. Her father was the first African American to receive a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania and she went on to herself receive a doctorate from that same university- becoming the first African American woman to earn a PHD in economics. She later returned to earn her law degree in 1927 and began her civil rights advocacy as a lawyer in 1935. She fought to end racial segregation in Philadelphia - both in the courts and through on-the-ground agitation at segregated cinemas, bars and restaurants. She worked on the integration of the American military, she joined countless presidential Civil Rights commissions and fought for racial and social justice all her life, until she retired at the grand old age of 85.</p>

<p>Ella Baker, 1903-1986</p>
<p>Often called the “unsung hero” of the civil rights movement; Ella Baker was the granddaughter of slaves who went on to become one of the most influential players in the progression of civil rights in the US. She became an activist at a young age, fighting against racial injustice at school and university before joining political causes in Harlem in the 1930s. She joined the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, which is still active today) in the 1940s and became the first woman to head up its New York branch.</p>
<p>She organised for Martin Luther King and fought for voter’s rights in the South- where African Americans were still denied their legal right to vote. She was a fierce advocate of grassroots activism and would have felt right at home in today’s activism sphere, as she fought for the inclusion of women and young people into the movements- helping to form the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) which was one of the first youth activist groups in the Civil Rights movement.</p>

<p>She fought the good fight right up until her death in 1986 and her work inspired many of the activists of today even though she remained a relatively unfamous figure. As she said herself: “You didn&rsquo;t see me on television, you didn&rsquo;t see news stories about me. The kind of role that I tried to play was to pick up pieces or put together pieces out of which I hoped organisation might come. My theory is, strong people don&rsquo;t need strong leaders.”</p>

<p>Claudia Jones, 1915-1964</p>
<p>Born in Trinidad and Tobago, Claudia subsequently emigrated to the US where her actions as an active member of the Communist party got her deported in 1955. She moved to the UK, where she ardently continued her campaigning against racial injustice, and founded Britain’s first major black newspaper; West Indian Gazette. Following the race riots in Notting Hill in 1958, and subsequent violence in Nottingham that year, Claudia said “we need to wash the taste of Notting Hill and Nottingham out of our mouths” and organised the first Caribbean Carnival in the UK. Part of the proceeds raised, went to support the fines of those affected by the riots and that carnival went on to become the Notting Hill Carnival. Today, the National Union of Journalists Black Member’s Council holds a special Claudia Jones lecture every October, as a testament to her contribution to Black British journalism.</p>

<p>Connie Mark, 1923-2007</p>
<p>Born in Jamaica, Connie served in World War II as a medical secretary and became politically active when, after moving to London, she was denied her British Empire Medal. She began campaigning for the rights of black people in the UK, specifically conditions in London, and worked tirelessly for black servicemen and women to receive their awards. She also co-founded the Mary Seacole Memorial Association to raise awareness for the legacy of the famous Jamaican nurse. In 1989, she began campaigning again, for the inclusion of black servicemen and women in the celebrations of fifty years since the outbreak of World War II. She eventually raised enough money for a photography exhibition celebrating the war effort of Black British people and was- finally- awarded her British Empire Medal in 1992. She was renowned for her championing of Caribbean culture in the UK and in 2001, five years before her death; she was awarded an MBE; another medal to add to her rightful collection.</p>

<p>Unita Blackwell, 1933-2019</p>
<p>When Unita first registered to vote in the early 1960s in Mississippi; and encouraged other African Americans to do so: she was fired. Thus began her passionate journey in the civil rights movement, which would take her from boycotts and protests with the SNCC to a landmark case she brought against the US Board of Education which resulted in further school desegregation. She went on to co-found a political party; the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and in 1976, she went on to become the first black female mayor in Mississippi- a state where she had, previously, been denied the right to even vote. She was reelected in 1997 and was politically active until her health began to decline in 2008. She lived long enough to see both the inauguration of Barack Obama and Donald Trump; dying at age 86 in 2019.</p>

<p>Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, 1940-</p>
<p>Miss Major is a monumental black trans woman activist who centres a lot of her work on women of colour. She was the original Executive Director of The Transgender Gender-Variant Intersex Justice Project which works directly on the issues of incarceration that disproportionately and negatively affect transgender people- and especially people of colour. Her whole life has been dedicated to her activism, fighting against the oppression she faced in her youth and she was a leader in the Stonewall Riots of 1969. Her activism continues to this day.</p>

<p>Margaret Busby, 1944-</p>
<p>Britain&rsquo;s youngest and first black female publisher when she founded Allison and Busby in 1967, Margaret is a strong advocate of literacy activism and a staunch campaigner for diversity within the arts. She has complied many anthologies of black female writing, from Daughters of Africa (1992) to New Daughters of Africa (2019), has worked as a journalist, broadcaster and activist and has won countless awards for her inexhaustible efforts to diversify the literary output of the UK, and to champion often overlooked an unsung voices; which she continues to do to this day.</p>

<p>Angela Davis, 1944-</p>
<p>Angela Davis is perhaps the first person in the civil rights movement to have her own merchandise. Long before Dior stuck ‘We Should All be Feminists’ on a t-shirt, there were FREE ANGELA badges, hats and tees. She grew up in the heart of the racial struggles in America; in a predominantly black area of Alabama, known as Dynamite Hill because there were so many KKK bombings and as a high school student in segregated schools, she organised interracial study groups that were broken up by the police. She went on to study abroad in Paris and Germany and became heavily involved in politics, returning to America to study her masters in California, where she joined the communist party and the Black Panthers; a militant organisation set up in 1966, originally for the self-defence of African Americans. When her guns were used in a prison heist, even though she was uninvolved and nowhere near the event; she was charged with murder. She evaded arrest and went on the run- earning a spot on the FBI’s Most Wanted List. When she was caught and imprisoned, there were FREE ANGELA rallies (and merchandise!) across the world and she was freed after 16 months; acquitted of all charges. She remains a strong political figure to this day, aged 76; a fierce activist, history professor and author of many books on race, feminism and prison reform.</p>

<p>Marsha P Johnson, 1945-1992</p>
<p>A black trans activist and insistent fighter for social and economic justice, Marsha, whilst often homeless herself, worked tirelessly to help homeless street youth - many of whom had been kicked out of their homes for being gay or non-conforming- and was a pioneering advocate on behalf of AIDS victims. She was a leader at the Stonewall Riots in 1969 and devoted her life to the protection of marginalised people, particularly gender non-conforming people of colour. “As long as gay people don’t have their rights all across America,” she once said, “there’s no reason for celebration.”</p>

<p>Olive Morris, 1952-1979</p>
<p>Though perhaps less famous than their American originals, Britain had its very Black Panthers and many of its founders were women. One of the most iconic was Olive Morris, who lived a tragically short but enormously impactful life. Born in Jamaica, she moved to the UK when she was nine and lived predominantly in South London. When she was seventeen, in 1969, she stepped in when a Nigerian diplomat was badly beaten by British police. She herself sustained brutal injuries both in the street and in police custody. The incident made her even more ardently politically active. She became one of the founding youth members of the British Black Panthers and the Brixton Black Women’s Group, which was founded in 1974. One of the aims of the group was to encourage black women to share their experiences of day-to-day injustices; an idea that greatly informed subsequent movements, like the #MeToo movement. She set up Black Community bookshops and squats, founded the Organisation of Women of African and Asian Descent in London and protested tirelessly throughout her life for racial justice, until her death, aged 27, of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in 1979.</p>

<p>Baroness Doreen Lawrence OBE, 1952-</p>
<p>After the tragic and racially-motivated murder of her son Stephen Lawrence, Doreeen became a strong public campaigner, not just for her son’s justice, but for racial and social justice in London communities. She continued to fight for other victims of racist crimes, set up the Stephen Lawrence foundation to promote community support and create a substantial legacy for her son, was awarded an OBE in 2003 for her services to communities and became a Life Peer in 2013. She advises the Home Office and the police service, sits on the board of the human rights organisation Liberty and is a patron of the hate crime charity Stop Hate UK. She is Chancellor of De Montfort university and in April of this year, she became race relations advisor to the Labour Party. She remains a vocal and active fighter for racial justice and equality in the UK.</p>

<p>Phyll Opuku-Gyimah, known as Lady Phyll, is the co-founder of UK Black Pride; the organisation which promotes unity among all LGBTQ people of colour. Her life had been dedicated to her work and her activism for both LGBTQ and racial justice and she is a trustee at Stonewall and an editor at Sista!, an anthology of writings by LGBTQ women of African and Caribbean descent. A leading and vocal British activist, she publicly turned down an MBE in 2016.</p>

<p>One of Britain’s leading black trans activists, Munroe is a powerful advocate for trans lives and racial justice. She uses her platform as a model to be an active voice for the transgender community and has held major corporations to account, including L’Oreal Paris, from whom she recently extracted a very public apology for their treatment of her in 2017, when they unceremoniously dropped her as an ambassador but has since joined their board to make serious change. Munroe’s pioneering work continues to be a light for hope and change today.</p>

<p>The movement that we see taking on new life today, across the world, was originally founded by three black American women in 2013 as a response to the acquittal of the murderer of black teenager Treyvon Martin. It is a global organisation, with chapters in the US, UK and Canada with a mission to end White Supremacy and intervene in the senseless violence inflicted upon black communities. The three women are artists, organisers, writers, activists and freedom fighters from LA and New York, whose work is powerful and intersectional and whose work together on Black Lives Matter has injected new life and purpose into the civil rights movement; perhaps opening up its next chapter…

IOC ACTIVITIES</p>
<p>PrEsident</p>
<p>On Monday 8 June, Olympic House reopened with a 30 percent occupancy in accordance with the Swiss health authority guidelines while also allowing a graduated return to normal. IOC staff have been working from home since 16 March because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>On 10 June, the IOC Executive Board (EB) held its second remote meeting. The EB members discussed the next editions of the Olympic Games, the IWF situation as well as nominations of new IOC Members and several other institutional matters.</p>
<p>At a time when demonstrations against racism are held all over the world, the IOC EB opened its meeting with the adoption of a resolution with regard to racism and inclusion in which the IOC condemns racism in the strongest terms. The IOC stands for non-discrimination as one of the founding pillars of the Olympic Movement. The IOC EB supports the initiative of the IOC Athletes’ Commission to explore different ways of how Olympic athletes can express their support for the principles enshrined in the Olympic Charter, including at the time of the Olympic Games, and respecting the Olympic spirit.</p>
<p>The EB received updates on the planning and preparations for the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020. The Tokyo 2020 report was given by the Organising Committee’s President, Yoshiro Mori, and its CEO, Toshiro Muto, while IOC Coordination Commission Chair John Coates reported on behalf of the “Here we go” Task Force. A key element of the presentation was Tokyo 2020 sharing the positioning, principles for re-planning, and a roadmap to the Games in 2021. The positioning and principles put the athletes and sport at the centre of the plans for Tokyo 2020, and address the desire to simplify and optimise Games preparations and delivery. The roadmap outlines the key activities, initiatives and milestones up until Games time in 2021. Full details here.</p>
<p>Concerning the Olympic Games Paris 2024, the EB agreed to maintain the previously set deadline of December 2020 to confirm the event programme and athlete quotas, including consideration of the events in the four additional sports (breaking, skateboarding, sport climbing and surfing) proposed by the Organising Committee. This decision is based on the recommendation of the Olympic Programme Commission after receiving feedback from the athletes, IFs, NOCs and Paris 2024. With the confirmation of the original deadline, December’s IOC EB meeting will now see a decision made on requests from 20 of the 27 Olympic IFs for changes to the Paris 2024 event programme. Full details here.</p>
<p>An update was made on the situation of the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) following the recent release by Professor McLaren of the “Independent Investigator Report to the Oversight and Integrity Commission of the International Weightlifting Federation” (see here the IOC statement following the release of this investigation). The EB took note that the information gathered in the independent investigation is now being further reviewed and addressed by the IWF Oversight and Integrity (O&amp;I) Commission, which has also received a more detailed report that has not yet been made available to the IOC. Full details here about the EB decisions with regard to the IWF.</p>
<p>The EB also approved the reallocations of medals, diplomas and medallist pins from three editions of the Olympic Games and one Youth Olympic Games following decisions made by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Full details here.</p>
<p>The IOC EB proposed five new IOC Members - three women and two men – for election to the IOC Session, which will be held virtually on 17 July 2020. Four of the five proposed new Members are Individual Members, while one candidature is linked to a function within an IF. The candidates are: Maria de la Caridad Colón Ruenes (Cuba); Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović (Croatia), Princess Reema Bandar Al-Saud (Saudi Arabia), Battushig Batbold (Mongolia) and Sebastian Coe, President of World Athletics (Great Britain). Full details here.</p>
<p>In addition, the EB also agreed to submit to the Session the change from a Membership linked to a NOC to Individual Membership for William Frederick Blick.</p>
<p>The EB also agreed to submit to the Session the extension of the term of IOC Member Zaiqing Yu (membership linked to his function as Vice-President of the NOC of China and age limit to be reached on 31.12.2021) from the end of 2021 to the end of 2025, due to the important role that he plays in Chinese sport and society.</p>
<p>The day after the EB, at The Olympic Museum in Lausanne, IOC President Thomas Bach met the President of the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF), Francesco Ricci Bitti. Together they discussed about the preparations for the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, the financial concerns caused by the coronavirus pandemic as well as various Olympic topics.</p>

The presentations made by the Paris team to the Commission reaffirmed their commitment to this strategy as the first Organising Committee to fully implement the measures outlined in Olympic Agenda 2020 and its New Norm.
