<p>In the latest episode of The Times’ TV podcast “Can’t Stop Watching,” host and staff writer Yvonne Villarreal asks “Orange Is the New Black” veteran Uzo Aduba about the research she did to play Black congresswoman and presidential candidate Shirley Chisholm in “Mrs. America”:</p>
<p>Why are we tuning in to watch this? We could watch a bunch of YouTube clips about her and see it told there. But the thing I really hooked into was, if you’ve watched [the documentary “Chisholm ’72: Unbought and Unbossed”], it’s the last maybe 10 minutes of the film, when she’s releasing her delegates, and you see her collapse into her hands and she starts crying. And it is the polar opposite — that and a dancing clip of her — of anything — interview, speech, whatever — I had ever seen of hers. I had never seen, I realized, the woman who goes home after having had to confront the world all day as “the only.” &hellip; I’d never seen her, the woman, without her wig on. I’d never seen Shirley Chisholm until that moment.</p>
<p>Listen to the full episode to meet Aduba’s first dog, Mr. Fenway Bark, hear the actress discuss her journaling and viewing habits in self-isolation and what it meant to find another project led by women in front of and behind the camera after “Orange Is the New Black.” Plus, catch our recent episodes with “Watchmen’s” Tim Blake Nelson, “This Is Us” star Mandy Moore and more of your TV faves.

Uzo Aduba is as gorgeous on the inside as she is on the outside - here’s a peek at her life.</p>
<p>Even though her IMDB page notes that she began gaining popularity when she performed in “Translations of Xhosa” at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, it wasn’t until she played Suzanne “Crazy Eyes” Warren in “Orange Is the New Black” that Uzo Aduba became wildly famous.</p>

<p>However, beyond her life as an actress, Uzo appears to have a fun-filled personal life, which she often shows off on her social media pages.</p>
<p>According to Uzo, what she missed about the Netflix original series was the opportunity to run into people that you didn’t intend to.</p>
<p>One of such posts, which she shared to her verified Instagram page, featured Uzo at a gathering that was put together by her friends. Through the post’s caption, the Blue Bloods” star praised her friends for their “ability to grow and evolve.”</p>
<p>Asides showing up at events of friends, Uzo appeared in “Miss Virginia,” which is a 2019 feature film about a real-life activist named Virginia Walden Ford who hailed from Washington D.C.</p>
<p>According to Forbes, Virginia was a single mother who, in the early 2000s, campaigned for a bill to ensure that children of low-income families have the same access to schools of their choice as those of wealthier families.</p>
<p>The movie also starred Matthew Modine and Aunjanue Ellis and was directed by R.J. Daniel Hanna, who claimed that he knew Uzo was perfect for the role of the titular character when he read the script.</p>
<p>Seeing as film production is on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the “Mrs. America” actress, recently disclosed to Elle what her quarantine routine was and what she missed most about OITNB - which ended in 2019 after seven seasons.</p>
<p>According to Uzo, what she missed about the Netflix original series was the opportunity to run into people that you didn’t intend to.</p>
<p>The actress, who made her Broadway debut as Toby in “Coram Boy,” also revealed that she was using the stay-at-home period to take classes online while experimenting with food in the kitchen. She noted that she is thankful for the time she gets to spend with her loved ones.

<h3 id="uzo-aduba-listens-to-niecy-nash-naturi-naughton-and-angela-polks-inspiring-career-stories">&ldquo;Uzo Aduba Listens to Niecy Nash, Naturi Naughton and Angela Polk&rsquo;s Inspiring Career Stories&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.amomama.com/67de8c4b6c2b1c1e3a566feb803c2da9.jpg?width=650&amp;height=340" alt="img">
While she has received her fair share of fame and acclaim in her career, actress Uzo Aduba is beginning to come into her own. Regardless, she&rsquo;s also getting some sage advice from some industry veterans.</p>
<p>The actress recently shared an interview that she had with some of her colleagues. In an Instagram video, she discussed with Niecy Nash, Naturi Naughton, and Angela Polk over their journeys and experiences as actresses.</p>
<p>Uzo Aduba attends EMILY&rsquo;s List 3rd Annual Pre-Oscars Event at Four Seasons Hotel Los Angeles at Beverly Hills on February 04, 2020 | Photo: Getty Images</p>
<p>The insightful session lasted over an hour. In it, the three guests shared what they had learned in the industry so far and even took some questions from fans and listeners while on air.</p>
<p>Uzo&rsquo;s career has taken off spectacularly. She gained recognition and awards for her portrayal of Suzanne Warren on Netflix&rsquo;s &ldquo;Orange Is The New Black,&rdquo; a show that she was on for seven years. However, she got her first lead role last year with &ldquo;Miss Virginia.&rdquo; Speaking on her big chance to play a lead role, she said in an interview:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d worked on a show for so long that had so many actors, but I&rsquo;d never&hellip; being the central focus, the titular character, so I was fascinated to find out what it meant&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The movie turned out to be quite fascinating. It focused on the life of Virginia Walden Ford, a Washington lawyer and single mother who fought for the education rights of poor children in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>In the interview, the actress explained that she found the role to be quite daunting. Apart from being her first lead role, it brought challenges of its own. However, she also learned quite a lot.</p>
<p>Niecy has especially been taking a break at this time., with the lockdown still in effect.</p>
<p>The Instagram interview session brought Uzo together with the other actresses, who she described as &ldquo;incredible.&rdquo; Their experiences should go a long way in inspiring each other.</p>
<p>The session is part of the actresses&rsquo; activities during the quarantine. Niecy has especially been taking a break at this time, with the lockdown still in effect In an interview from last week, she said of her time at home:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a time of some much-needed rest. I have learned to listen to the beat of my drum and give my body and soul what it needs at this time. That&rsquo;s what I require.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Expatiating, she said that she had been working straight for two years and hadn&rsquo;t taken a break. Now, she gets to enjoy her new house and be with her family.</p>
<p>Uzo also spoke on her routine during this period. Earlier this month, she appeared on an &ldquo;Ask Me Anything&rdquo; session, where she divulged some of her quarantine hacks.</p>
<p>The actress pointed out that she had been engaging in more self-care activities. She&rsquo;s also been reading books and watching movies. Of course, it&rsquo;s back to work for her once the lockdown ends. Uzo is already preparing for a role on a new series, titled &ldquo;Mrs. America.&rdquo;

<p>Dorothy gets whisked away from home by a tornado and transported to the magical world of Oz, where she meets the powerful (or not so powerful, as it turns out) wizard. She then has to find her way home, crossing paths with enchanting friends and wicked foes along the way&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip; but in this TV production, she does so accompanied by a rather magnificent Cirque du Soleil performance.</p>

<p>NBC’s The Wiz Live! is streaming on YouTube this Friday. Picture: NBC</p>
<p>How can I watch The Wiz Live! for free?</p>
<p>The Wiz will be available tonight, Friday 12 June, from 7pm BST (11am PT, 2pm ET).</p>
<p>You can stream the production via YouTube channel The Shows Must Go On, but you’ll only have 48 hours to view the show and it won’t be available in Asia and Latin America (except Brazil).</p>
<p>While the stream itself is free, audiences are encouraged to donate money, if financially able, to the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People), and arts causes including Acting For Others, Broadway Cares, the Actors Benevolent Fund and the NHS Charities COVID-19 appeal.</p>
<p>The Wiz Live! – who’s in the cast and is there a scarecrow?</p>
<p>Last weekend’s livestream, Peter Pan Live!, was cancelled in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The channel said: “We will no longer be going ahead with this weekend’s show. We stand with our black employees, colleagues, partners and creators in outrage at acts of racism.”</p>
<p>Tonight’s livestream features an all African-American cast, with musical theatre powerhouse Amber Riley in the lead role of Addaperle, and rapper Queen Latifax as The Wiz.</p>
<p>Directed by Matthew Diamond and Kenny Leon, the new production also stars singer-songwriter Mary J. Blige as Evillene, actress Uzo Aduba as Glinda the Good Witch of the South, singer Ne-Yo as Tin-Man and dancer Elijah Kelley as the famous Scarecrow.</p>
<p>The Wiz Live! – what are the songs?</p>
<p>The music for the TV production was co-written by Charlie Smalls, Timothy Graphenreed, Harold Wheeler, George Faison, Ne-Yo, Elijah Kelley, Harvey Mason Jr and Stephen Oremus.</p>
<p>Popular melodies include ‘Tornado’, ‘He’s the Wizard’, ‘What Would I Do If I Could Feel’, ‘We Got It’ and motivational number, ‘Believe in Yourself’.</p>
<p>The musical also features the song ‘Everybody Rejoice/A Brand New Day’, which was penned by iconic soul singer, Luther Vandross.</p>
<p>Watch The Wiz Live! tonight, Friday 12 June, from 7pm BST, on YouTube.

<h3 id="gabrielle-union-cites-julianne-houghs-blackface-offense-in-lawsuit-against-nbc">&ldquo;Gabrielle Union Cites Julianne Hough’s Blackface Offense In Lawsuit Against NBC&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CJV_xjeUMAAwGYz.jpeg" alt="img">
Gabrielle Union is taking things a step further with her demand for change at NBC following her termination from America’s Got Talent. The actress filed a harassment complaint against the network, the production company and longtime host, Simon Cowell. Union famously accused Cowell of creating a toxic environment for her and others. She named her former co-host, Julianne Hough, in the suit – alleging that NBC has a history of hiring talent known for past racist behavior and cites Hough dressing in blackface for Halloween as an example.</p>

<p>A recap of Julianne Hough’s blackface offense</p>
<p>Hough was criticized after dressing as Crazy Eyes, An African American character from the popular Netflix series Orange Is The New Black for Halloween in 2013. Donned in an orange jumpsuit, Hough wore makeup that was multiple shades darker to try and mimic the character. She also attempted to copy the same natural hairstyle as the television character. She issued an apology after the swift backlash.</p>

<p>“I am a huge fan of the show ‘Orange is the New black,’ actress Uzo Aduba, and the character she has created. It certainly was never my intention to be disrespectful or demeaning to anyone in any way. I realize my costume hurt and offended people and I truly apologize,” a then 25-year-old Hough wrote on Twitter.</p>
<p>Hough apologized for a second time in 2015 during an interview with Allure Magazine. “Ignorance is sometimes not bliss. I really had no idea what I was doing, and it was all out of fun and respect for the character,” she said. “I don’t even know how to talk about it because it’s such a sensitive topic. It makes me so sad to think that I was that dumb. I learned a big lesson.”</p>
<p>Gabrielle Union says NBC has a history of hiring talent accused of racist behavior, including Julianne Hough</p>
<p>Union is alleging in her suit that after witnessing behavior she deemed racist and misogynistic, she filed a complaint with executives that fell on death ears. As a result of her complaints, Union says she was deemed “intimidating” and fired.</p>

<p>She says that NBC has a history of hiring celebrities with a racist past, including Hough, who she worked alongside at America’s Got Talent. She cites Hough’s blackface offense as an example and believes NBC intentionally hired Hough knowing of the incident.</p>
<p>According to documents obtained by The Blast, Union’s suit says of Hough’s hiring:</p>
<p>Producers made a decision to hire Union as a judge on AGT while simultaneously hiring Hough, a two-time professional champion of ABC’s Dancing with the Stars who had recently gone through a widely publicized scandal for personally appearing in blackface. Hough apologized in response to the public uproar that she caused. Combining someone who so openly wore blackface (Hough) with someone who is black and regularly advocates on behalf of minorities (Union) should have at least alerted Telegdy that this could cause Union to experience some trepidation or concern about being unprotected from racially insensitive individuals while working as a judge on AGT.</p>
<p>Union is requesting monetary compensation in an unspecified amount, as well as demanding that changes are made at NBCUniversal. Hough was also fired at the time of Union’s termination after just one season as a judge.

<h3 id="the-emmys-limited-series-acting-categories-present-an-intriguing-numbers-game--tv-podcast">&ldquo;The Emmy’s Limited Series Acting Categories Present an Intriguing Numbers Game — TV Podcast&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Watchmen-HBO.jpg" alt="img">
Neither pandemic, nor lockdown, nor social upheaval, nor second-wave pandemic stays the Emmy Awards from its originally scheduled completion of the 2020 ceremony — or so it would appear from a series of announcements shared this week.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Television Academy announced adjusted plans for the Creative Arts Emmy Awards which will forgo in-person ceremonies for virtual events spanning several nights in September, in addition to cancelling any and all Governors Balls that typically accompany both the Creative Arts and Primetime Emmy Awards. On Tuesday, ABC announced the Primetime awards would proceed as scheduled on September 20, with late-night host Jimmy Kimmel returning to emcee, in whatever way, shape, and form the ceremony took place — be it virtual, live, tape-delayed, in a closet, in a bathtub, or at an overcrowded Orange County beach while surrounded by people who refuse to wear masks. Hopefully, it will not be the latter.</p>
<p>And while Emmy season continues apace, it’s anything but business as usual for TV awards prognosticators. If divining potential Emmy nominees in the best of times is interpreting industry buzz and reading tea leaves, then 2020 is the year that all the bees died and everyone started drinking whisky instead.</p>
<p>But the Emmys are happening, come hell or high water, and in anticipation (and maybe trepidation) IndieWire’s television podcast “Millions of Screens” is kicking off its category-by-category breakdown of the Primetime Emmy Awards’ most vital categories.</p>
<p>First up for analysis are the absolutely brutal acting categories for TV movies and limited series. These are likely some of the most contentious competitions in the entire Emmy slate, not only because of how many high-quality productions the year offered, but also because of how many outstanding performances each of those productions created.</p>
<p>Take, for example, HBO’s “Watchmen,” a limited series inspired by the comic book of the same name, which offered audiences an opportunity to deconstruct the violence and racism built into the backbone of American history. While Regina King is a lock for limited series actress and Jean Smart is virtually guaranteed a nomination for supporting actress, there are so many other players that will be in direct competition with each other, including Tim Blake Nelson, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, and Louis Gossett Jr. all competing for Supporting Actor.</p>
<p>Sabrina Lantos / FX</p>
<p>Or FX’s “Mrs. America,” where Cate Blanchett transformed herself into vile opponent of the Equal Rights Amendment Phyllis Schlafly and finds herself situated as King’s greatest competition in the Best Actress category. Beyond Blanchett, every other woman in the show’s murderers row of actresses falls into Supporting Actress, which means the likes of Rose Byrne, Margo Martindale, Sarah Paulson, Uzo Aduba, and Tracey Ullman are all in direct competition with each other, as well as the entirety of the supporting actress field.</p>
<p>It’s a similar issue faced by Netflix and Ryan Murphy’s star-studded alternate history “Hollywood,” where Jim Parsons, Joe Mantello, Darren Criss, and Dylan McDermott are all jockeying for position in Supporting Actor.</p>
<p>Here’s why this matters: Last year we talked about the overwhelming ballot that Emmy members face when trying to register their voting preferences, in huge part due to the continuing demands of Peak TV. In response, it appeared that voters ended up voting, not necessarily for what they loved, but more for what they’ve seen. “Game of Thrones” got 32 nominations, likely because Emmy voters knew exactly what a “Game of Thrones” episode was, even if they didn’t actually love the underwhelming final season.</p>
<p>Last year I posited that Emmy voting worked on a three-prong system: People watched it. People talked about it. People always vote for it.</p>
<p>Because of conditions beyond anyone’s control, the concept of people talking about TV shows seems largely a thing of the past. It’s hard to create buzz without FYC events and industry chatter, and it’s hard to have industry chatter when the industry is shuttered. That leaves two prongs: People watched it. People always vote for it.</p>
<p>Because we’re dealing with limited series and TV movies, none of them have an established history with the Academy because they’re all one-and-done. So that leaves one prong: People watched it.</p>
<p>Beth Dubber/Netflix</p>
<p>What that means for these limited series categories specifically is that if voters watch one series, but skip another, you could see an entire category populated by performances from “Mrs. America.” Or if voters were enamored with Netflix’s “Unbelievable” and skipped Hulu’s “Little Fires Everywhere,” then the former could see double nods in actress, as opposed to double nods for the latter.</p>
<p>Welcome to the ultimate downfall of the streaming revolution, in which we don’t how many people are watching what, and boy is it about to show. No matter what your awards pundit of choice will try to tell you, most of us are flying blind. The best we can do is look at what the TV Academy has done before, what networks have done before, what actors have done before, and try to extrapolate all of that into something that makes sense, while also keeping in mind that 2020 is unlike any other year in human history, so all bets are off.</p>
<p>As difficult as that makes my job, it’s a wonderful opportunity for the TV Academy to throw off the burdens of history and remake their awards into something that better reflects the high-quality programming consistently being produced in corners not always recognized by the mainstream. Last year’s celebration of “Fleabag” was a great start, but there’s still plenty of room for improvement.</p>
<p>To hear a full breakdown of the limited series and TV movie acting categories, make sure to tune in to this week’s episode of “Millions of Screens” with TV Awards Editor Libby Hill, TV Deputy Editor Ben Travers, and Creative Producer Leo Garcia. We’re still faithfully abiding by California’s social distancing recommendations, so this week’s episode was recorded from the comfort of everyone’s respective Los Angeles-area apartments, and we’re again offering viewers a video-version of the podcast, as embedded above.</p>
