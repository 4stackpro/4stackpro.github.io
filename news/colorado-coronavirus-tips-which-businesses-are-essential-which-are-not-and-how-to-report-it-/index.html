Coronavirus Travel Tips: To Fly Or Not To Fly? What Happens If You Cancel?</p>
<p>Enlarge this image toggle caption Bim/Getty Images Bim/Getty Images</p>
<p>How safe — or risky — is it to fly?</p>
<p>Should I cancel a trip I&rsquo;ve planned?</p>
<p>Can I come home early from my trip?</p>
<p>These are some of the questions that would-be travelers are asking in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. We talked to travel and health specialists to get answers.</p>
<p>Can I cancel a trip I&rsquo;ve booked because I&rsquo;m afraid of the coronavirus?</p>
<p>Depends on whether you bought a refundable ticket or have the right kind of travel insurance. Regular travel insurance won&rsquo;t cover a cancellation because of fears about the coronavirus outbreak. For that, you need to buy a &ldquo;Cancel for Any Reason&rdquo; (CFAR) policy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve become quite popular in the last few weeks,&rdquo; says Jonathan Breeze, CEO of AardvarkCompare, a travel insurance comparison website. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing about a 50% increase in the amount of policies being sold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few things to note: A CFAR policy typically needs to be purchased within a couple of weeks from the time you booked your trip, it will usually only cover about 75% of your costs, and New York state does not allow residents to buy CFAR policies.</p>
<p>In addition, some credit cards have automatic travel insurance for trips purchased by their cardholders. Check with your provider to see whether you would be covered.</p>
<p>How do I pick a travel insurance policy?</p>
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all policy, according to Christopher Elliott, founder of a consumer advocacy organization, Elliott Advocacy. Factors such as your age, the length of your trip and what you want covered all figure into the decision. Elliott recommends reading the insurance contract before buying to check whether it applies to &ldquo;worst-case scenarios,&rdquo; such as sickness or flight delays. See this column for more advice.</p>
<p>What if I booked a flight and want to reschedule it to avoid traveling during the outbreak?</p>
<p>Several airlines — including American, Delta, Frontier, JetBlue and United — have been waiving change fees for flights purchased between certain dates. And even if your purchase falls outside that window, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s always worth asking,&rdquo; says Seth Kaplan, transportation analyst for WBUR&rsquo;s Here &amp; Now. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re asking for an exception,&rdquo; he says — but if you&rsquo;re polite and explain your situation, you might get a break.</p>
<p>What if I want to end my trip early, say, because the outbreak has spread to a country I&rsquo;m visiting?</p>
<p>In most cases, &ldquo;somebody abroad saying, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to be here anymore,&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t covered by regular travel insurance,&rdquo; says Breeze. Again, this is where a Cancel for Any Reason policy would come in handy. With many CFAR policies, a traveler can not only recover some of the initial cost of the trip, he says, but in many cases, the policy will also cover the additional cost of coming home.</p>
<p>Is international travel riskier to my health than domestic travel?</p>
<p>It depends. Shira Doron, a hospital epidemiologist and infectious disease specialist at Tufts Medical Center, says she would not recommend traveling to countries that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has put on its &ldquo;warning&rdquo; list to avoid nonessential travel, such as China, Iran, Italy and South Korea.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean domestic travel is risk-free. To put things in perspective, the virus is here, with case numbers on the rise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We already have community transmission within the United States,&rdquo; says Doron. &ldquo;So, at some point, it&rsquo;s not going to be any riskier to go to another country than it is to stay right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the virus is already out there, should I avoid plane travel just to be safe? After all, when you fly aren&rsquo;t you breathing in recycled air?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The air&rsquo;s actually pretty clean. It gets recirculated through these HEPA filters that really are very good at clearing stuff out,&rdquo; says Vicki Hertzberg, director of Emory University&rsquo;s Center for Nursing Data Science, who co-led a study on flights and disease transmission with scientists at Boeing. &ldquo;So in some aspects, the air on a plane is cleaner than what&rsquo;s going on in your new office buildings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moreover, Dr. Mark Gendreau, chief medical officer at Beverly Hospital in Massachusetts, says that airlines have a high incentive to keep their ventilation systems well-maintained: &ldquo;If the HEPA filter is not changed regularly, if the system is not maintained well, it puts a lot of drag on the engines, which will increase the fuel consumption, which is quite an expensive proposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another important thing to know: The new coronavirus is not airborne. Instead, it&rsquo;s transmitted through droplets of fluid or mucus that you cough or sneeze out, which generally don&rsquo;t travel farther than 6 feet. But if those droplets land on a surface that you later touch, you can pick up the virus that way.</p>
<p>People can help protect themselves and one another by taking precautions such as washing hands frequently, coughing into an elbow and trying not to touch eyes, nose and mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good hand hygiene is the solution,&rdquo; Doron says.</p>
<p>And not just in the bathroom. Even on the way back to your seat after a bathroom visit where you washed your hands, &ldquo;one may be touching doors, doorknobs, seats,&rdquo; says Dr. Lin Chen, president of the International Society of Travel Medicine and director of the travel medicine center at Mount Auburn Hospital in Massachusetts. So it&rsquo;s a good idea to use hand sanitizer at your seat before eating pretzels or sweeping hair from your face.</p>
<p>The CDC says your sanitizer should have at least 60% alcohol content.</p>
<p>How clean are planes anyway?</p>
<p>Airline sanitization is also something to consider. Some airlines are stepping up their cleaning game. American Airlines says it is conducting a &ldquo;more thorough cleaning of all hard surfaces&rdquo; and removing self-serve snack baskets on some international flights. Alaska Airlines says that, since March 2, it has been &ldquo;enhancing&rdquo; aircraft cleaning between flights. For planes whose schedules allow, the cleaning policy now includes seats, overhead air vents, bathroom door handles, window shades and luggage compartment handles.</p>
<p>Flights often turn around quickly, which could lead to possible lapses in the cleaning process, so Chen suggests bringing alcohol wipes to clean the areas you personally touch — including your seat belt, tray table and armrests. In a pinch, squeezing hand sanitizer onto a tissue and wiping down your armrest would probably work, she says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We really don&rsquo;t have data about how long the coronavirus survives on surfaces,&rdquo; Chen says. Other coronaviruses can last for a few hours or a few days on different materials, so for the time being, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s best to be more cautious,&rdquo; she says.</p>

<h3 id="easy-affordable-and-healthy-eating-tips-during-the-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak">Easy, affordable and healthy eating tips during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.unicef.org/sites/default/files/styles/hero_desktop/public/UN0343152.jpg?itok=XrCkfNOF" alt="img">
&lt; Back to UNICEF COVID-19 portal</p>
<p>The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is upending life for families around the world. As schools and childcare centres close, many parents are finding themselves stuck at home for most of the day juggling childcare, full-time work and other competing responsibilities. Figuring out “What’s for dinner?” can be yet another daily challenge.</p>
<p>To make things even harder, panic buying and disruptions to food supply systems mean some foods can now be difficult to find. And for many people, unemployment and lost income are making food shopping an additional financial challenge.</p>
<p>While many parents are understandably looking to ready meals and processed foods as a quick and low-cost way to feed the family, there are convenient, affordable and healthy alternatives. Here are five ways to help feed your children a varied, nutritious diet that will support their growth and development, all while building healthy eating habits.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>See food hygiene tips</p>

<p>5 healthy eating tips</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep up fruit and vegetable intake</li>
</ol>
<p>Purchasing, storing and cooking fresh vegetables can be challenging in a lockdown, especially when parents are advised to limit trips outside of the home. But wherever possible, it’s important to ensure children are still getting plenty of fruit and vegetables in their diet.</p>
<p>Whenever it is possible to get hold of fresh produce, do so. As well as being eaten fresh, fruits and vegetables can be frozen where possible and will retain most of their nutrients and flavor. Using fresh vegetables to cook large batches of soups, stews or other dishes will make them last longer and provide meal options for a few days. These can also be frozen where possible and then quickly reheated.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Swap in healthy dried or canned alternatives when fresh produce is not available</li>
</ol>
<p>Fresh produce is almost always the best option, but when it is not available there are plenty of healthy alternatives that are easy to store and prepare.</p>
<p>Canned beans and chickpeas, which provide an abundance of nutrients, can be stored for months or even years, and can be included in meals in many ways. Canned oily fish such as sardines, mackerel and salmon are rich in protein, omega 3 fatty acids and a range of vitamins and minerals. These can be used cold in sandwiches, salads or pasta dishes, or cooked as part of a warm meal.</p>
<p>Canned vegetables, such as tomatoes, do tend to contain lower quantities of vitamins than fresh produce, but they are a great fallback option when fresh produce or frozen vegetables are hard to come by.</p>
<p>Dried goods like dried beans, pulses and grains such as lentils, split peas, rice, couscous or quinoa are also nutritious, long-lasting options that are tasty, affordable and filling. Rolled oats cooked with milk or water can serve as an excellent breakfast option, and can be spiced up with yoghurt, chopped fruits or raisins.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Build up a stock of healthy snacks</li>
</ol>
<p>Children often need to eat a snack or two during the day to keep them going. Rather than giving kids sweets or salty snacks, opt for healthier options like nuts, cheese, yoghurt (preferably unsweetened), chopped or dried fruits, boiled eggs, or other locally available healthy options. These foods are nutritious, more filling, and help build healthy eating habits that last a lifetime.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Limit highly processed foods</li>
</ol>
<p>While using fresh produce may not always be possible, try to limit the amount of highly processed foods in your shopping basket. Ready-to-eat meals, packaged snacks and desserts are often high in saturated fat, sugars and salt. If you do purchase processed foods, look at the label and try to choose healthier options containing less of these substances. Try to also avoid sugary drinks and instead drink lots of water. Adding fruits or vegetables like lemon, lime, cucumber slices or berries to water is a great way to add an extra twist of flavor.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Make cooking and eating a fun and meaningful part of your family routine</li>
</ol>
<p>Cooking and eating together is a great way to create healthy routines, strengthen family bonds and have fun. Wherever you can, involve your children in food preparation – small children can help with washing or sorting food items while older children can take on more complex tasks and help to set the table.</p>
<p>Try as much as possible to stick to fixed mealtimes as a family. Such structures and routine can help reduce anxiety for children in these stressful situations.</p>
<p>Advice for breastfeeding children</p>
<p>Breastmilk remains a great food for children between 6-24 months. Women with COVID-19 can continue to breastfeed if they wish to do so. They should, however, practice respiratory hygiene during feeding, wearing a mask where available; wash their hands before and after touching the baby; and routinely clean and disinfect surfaces they have touched. If too unwell to breastfeed due to the virus or other complications, mothers should be supported to safely provide newborns with breastmilk in any way possible.
