<h3 id="mafss-drew-speaks-about-dating-his-housemate-after-kc-and-michael-go-public">MAFS&rsquo;s Drew speaks about dating his housemate after KC and Michael go public</h3>

<p>Their relationship is moving at a fast pace! New Idea</p>
<p>Michael also revealed the MAFS bride— who moved back from Hollywood in the hope of finding love— has met his son, Connor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a cutie,&rdquo; she said, with Michael adding they&rsquo;ve already discussed starting their own family together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think KC would be the best mum. A little dancing pop star! We are excited to start the next chapter,&rdquo; said the party boy who caused quite the stir on this season of the experiment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no regrets. I loved filming the show and everything it taught me. I learned so much from Drew and even though I didn’t find love on the show, it led me to find love now and I couldn’t be happier,&rdquo; KC added.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re officially official! New Idea</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, their love story began after Michael split from law graduate Stacey, with KC hitting back at her claims she tried to pursue him while they were in the midst of working things out.</p>
<p>As we know, Stacey once said: &ldquo;She went behind my back and proceeded to see Michael after he broke my heart. KC and I are now no longer friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t hook up during filming. No, but we got along really well. And we both thought each other was attractive so we remained friends after the experiment and shared a few phone calls,&rdquo; KC clarified.</p>
<p>Thankfully, her on-screen husband was far more supportive than Michael&rsquo;s ex-wife was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went for lunch with Drew after filming the Today show and he asked if the rumours were true. I couldn’t lie to him, so I told him that we were dating,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Drew was nothing but supportive and agreed to keep it a secret. We finished off by having a glass of wine and toasting to the good times we had in the experiment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drew and KC pretended they were together during their Today interview. Today Show</p>
<p>But what do the rest of their co-stars think of their relationship? Natasha Spencer— who exposed Stacey&rsquo;s affair with Mikey Pembroke— says she&rsquo;s happy they&rsquo;re happy!</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are dating and it&rsquo;s very serious,&rdquo; she told WHO online exclusively. &ldquo;KC and Drew didn&rsquo;t last long at all so she started talking to Michael not long after the show. If they work out, good luck to them. Something positive should come out of this sh*t show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>News of their coupling may come as a shock to some seeing as Michael slammed rumours he was dating the 31-year-old, calling these allegations &ldquo;fake news&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone keeps asking me if I&rsquo;m with KC or if I&rsquo;m not. Honestly, it’s getting fired at me that many times it’s ridiculous. I don’t honestly know where that came from,&rdquo; he told Nova 100’s Chrissie, Sam &amp; Browny during a radio interview last week.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s said to be very upset about Michael and KC&rsquo;s relationship. Nine</p>
<p>that he&rsquo;d found the woman of his dreams, however she had no connection to the show! Then, a day later, he told HIT105&rsquo;s hosts Stav, Abby and Matt that he&rsquo;d found the woman of his dreams, however she had no connection to the show!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I decided that single wasn&rsquo;t the way to be. I have met someone I am with now and I would take a bullet for her. She is my world and I am really happy,&rdquo; he dished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It worked out for me in the end I guess. I am really happy and it&rsquo;s a good feeling waking up and going, &lsquo;Wow, how did this all work out for me?'&rdquo;</p>
<p>Either way, we&rsquo;re happy for the couple and hope they last longer than Mikey&rsquo;s 10-second effort.

<h3 id="michael-goonan-just-compared-his-relationship-to-coronavirus">Michael Goonan just compared his relationship to coronavirus</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.who.com.au/media/59230/michael-goonan.jpg" alt="img">
Nine</p>
<p>He added: &lsquo;People don&rsquo;t like to do what they&rsquo;re told sometimes, sometimes you sneak out, you know what I mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a bid to clarify his remarks, Michael told Daily Mail Australia: &lsquo;It was a comparison or people in Australia breaking the national rules.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Michael spoke out about the cheating scandal that tore his relationship apart with Stacey.</p>
<p>A heartbroken Michael said his TV wife was acting bizarrely before the final dinner party and was already covering her tracks before he was even confronted with news of her affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we got to the dinner party, she goes, &lsquo;I think there&rsquo;s going to be a rumour coming out that I hooked up with Mikey - but we only went out for coffee.&rsquo; I was wondering why she told me like that?&rdquo; a perplexed Michael said on Married At First Sight&rsquo;s YouTube channel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t add up. And I was like, well, if it didn&rsquo;t happen, it didn&rsquo;t happen. Then it came out that she slept with Mikey and I thought I&rsquo;d give her the benefit of the doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he says he desperately wanted to believe the woman he fell in love with on the dating experiment, proof they were messaging was the final nail in the coffin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she says there&rsquo;s no messages, and out comes the phone,&rdquo; he said, still baffled she&rsquo;s still lying about sleeping with Mikey. &ldquo;I still wanted to defend her and I think the world of her. She&rsquo;s a great mum, lovely person and sat on a big secret, which would have been really hard to handle.&rdquo;
