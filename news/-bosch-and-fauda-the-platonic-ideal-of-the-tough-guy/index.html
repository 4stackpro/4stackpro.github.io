It’s April, so I must be writing about “Bosch.” This is the fifth straight year I’ve taken note of a new season (now the sixth) of Amazon Prime Video’s Los Angeles cop show based on Michael Connelly’s Harry Bosch novels. It’s an indulgence in a time when many worthwhile series go unremarked. This year, I can rationalize it as coronavirus-related: “Bosch” is my comfort show, the one I binge the day it’s available. On Friday I’ll be quarantined in my happy place.</p>
<p>The show adheres to a tough-guy ethic from another era of television — you wouldn’t be surprised to see a “Cannon”-vintage Quinn Martin credit pop up onscreen — and there’s something a little retrograde and formulaic about the conception of Bosch, a non-dirty Harry who plays it mostly by the book but sits on deep reserves of righteous anger. In practice, though, nuanced writing (under the showrunners Eric Overmyer and Daniel Pyne) and a marvelous performance by Titus Welliver make Harry a singular character, a California combo of stone-faced avenger, laid-back hipster and tireless gumshoe.</p>
<p>Strong, silent types take up a smaller share of the TV landscape than they used to, but another prime example also returned this week: Doron Kavillio (Lior Raz) in the Israeli drama “Fauda,” whose 12-episode third season arrived Thursday on Netflix.</p>
<p>“Fauda,” about an undercover Israeli counterterrorist unit, is set in the claustrophobic environs of the West Bank and Gaza and continually rattles with the sound of automatic weapons; it’s a very different show from the quieter and more deliberate “Bosch.” But at the core of each is that same laconic hero, the volatile outsider who bends the rules (in Harry’s case) or shatters them (in Doron’s) in order to uphold a status quo that’s showing serious signs of wear.

<h3 id="new-season-of-fauda-to-debut-this-week-on-netflix">New season of Fauda to debut this week on Netflix</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2020/04/000_1QK3KU-e1586789601187-1024x640.jpg" alt="img">
The hit TV show “Fauda” about an undercover Israeli unit fighting terrorists focuses on the punishing toll paid by “innocents” as it returns this week for a third season, says its co-creator Avi Issacharoff.</p>
<p>“We see how people who do not want to go to war, who want to live in peace, get caught up in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, in spite of themselves,” he told AFP about the show, largely set in the Gaza Strip for the first time.</p>
<p>Fauda, which means “chaos” in Arabic, has won accolades and drawn controversy since it premiered in 2015 as the first prominent Israeli show to screen in both Hebrew and Arabic.</p>

<p>It has attracted a global following since it was picked up by Netflix in 2016, and the streaming service is set to release the third season in most of the world this week.</p>
<p>With unprecedented numbers of people streaming television at home during isolation forced by the COVID-19 pandemic, Fauda’s third season appears poised to draw a substantial audience.</p>
<p>Issacharoff, an Arab affairs analyst for The Times of Israel who has closely covered the conflict, said “the recipe remains the same overall, but this season is much more complex than the previous ones.”</p>
<p>The earlier plotlines, based in the West Bank, focused on the hunt for the head of the Hamas terror organization and a commander from the Islamic State jihadist group.</p>
<p>Issacharoff — whose co-creator and Fauda lead actor Lior Raz served in the military unit on which the show is based — said the third season seeks to “show the heavy price paid by innocent people because of the conflict.”</p>
<p>The third seasons starts with Israeli agent Doron Kavillio, the central character played by Raz, going undercover in the West Bank city of Hebron.</p>
<p>Posing as a coach, Kavillio steers a young Palestinian boxer with a bright future down a path with substantial consequences.</p>
<p>The third season is the first with much of the action taking place in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian enclave under an Israeli and Egyptian-enforced blockade since 2007, the year Hamas took power in the coastal strip. Israel says the blockade is necessary to prevent arms from reaching the Gaza-ruling terror group.</p>
<p>Scenes set in Gaza were filmed in the Arab-Israeli cities of Kfar Kassem and Jisr al-Zarqa, in the center and north of the Jewish state.</p>
<p>‘An Israeli series’</p>
<p>Fauda has been praised by many as offering a nuanced depiction of the conflict, and the New York Times in December called it one of the 30 best international television shows of the decade.</p>
<p>Critics see it as one-sided as Israeli agents are undeniably depicted as the dare-devil protagonists.</p>
<p>A 2018 review in the Guardian newspaper noted that the extent to which the show treats the conflict with evenhandedness is largely “in the eye of the beholder.”</p>
<p>Issacharoff stressed that Fauda is an “Israeli series.”</p>
<p>But, he said, “it is important for us not to caricature the enemy” and to show that they also “suffer, cry and love.”</p>
<p>He added that he hopes the show can serve as a bridge between Israelis and Palestinians while highlighting the suffering on both sides.</p>
<p>Certain characters are based on personalities known to the co-creators, notably Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza.</p>
<p>But, said Issacharoff, Fauda “remains fiction, even if we give it some elements of reality.”</p>
<p>Reality is also often more complex than many imagine, he added, pointing to the fact that Israel and Hamas — who have fought three wars since 2008 — are cooperating to contain the COVID-19 outbreak in Gaza.</p>
<p>Times of Israel staff contributed to this report.

<p><img src="https://images.wsj.net/im-176236/social" alt="img">
The hunt for a bingeable series continues among the sequestered multitudes, but it becomes clear—if you swap recommendations with friends—that one viewer’s meat can be another’s induced coma. This couldn’t be more starkly exemplified by two series that reach different milestones Thursday, though each can be recommended, with reservations.</p>
<p>“Devs” is the creation of writer-director Alex Garland, who’s having something of a moment right now: He wrote “28 Days Later,” the 2002 Danny Boyle-directed horror film about an incurable&hellip;
