No Australian government has ever spent A$130 billion so quickly.</p>
<p>Last Tuesday, when the Prime Minister announced the government would subsidise six million jobs for six months to the tune of $1,500 a fortnight, the nation’s economists were left speechless.</p>
<p>Today, the government unveiled the legislation to be considered by the parliament tomorrow.</p>
<p>In ordinary times, there wouldn’t be a lot of support for a $130 billion wage subsidy. But these aren’t ordinary times.</p>
<p>Whole sectors of the economy have shut down, either directly as part of the health response to the pandemic, or indirectly as part of a wave of knock-on effects.</p>
<p>Read more: Australia&rsquo;s $130 billion JobKeeper payment: what the experts think</p>
<p>The JobKeeper wage subsidies will give direct support to the worst-affected businesses and jobs, helping to keep the economic damage to a minimum. The package isn’t perfect. But it’s a far better response than had been feared.</p>
<p>It will help keep the Australian economy afloat over the next six months, putting it in a position to bounce back when health officials deem it safe to reopen parts of the economy for business.</p>
<p>It has three key features:</p>
<p>businesses get $1,500 per fortnight per worker (only for those workers who were employed on March 1. Short-term casuals with the business and some visa holders are excluded)</p>
<p>the employer has to keep those workers on the books and pay them at least $1,500 per fortnight</p>
<p>it only applies to businesses whose revenue has collapsed by at least 30% (15% for charities and not-for-profits, 50% for the largest businesses, with banks excluded).</p>
<p>To be effective, it has to deliver on three goals:</p>
<p>to support workers’ incomes through the crisis</p>
<p>to keep workers attached to firms, preserving as many job-specific skills and as much know-how as possible</p>
<p>to prevent wide-scale business failures which could turn a short and sharp recession into a long and painful depression.</p>
<p>Importantly, this means if it’s working well, both workers and employers will get something out of the deal.</p>
<p>At firms that would otherwise have shut down, workers will benefit considerably.</p>
<p>Many workers will get paid more</p>
<p>The $1,500 payment will give them much more than the Newstart payment they would have received if laid off, even the doubled Newstart (now called JobSeeker) which for six months has been paired with a Coronavirus supplement lifting it from $565.70 to $1,115.60 per fortnight.</p>
<p>And for the one third of workers otherwise earning less than $1,500 per fortnight, the JobKeeper payment will be a pay rise. If the subsidy keeps their firm afloat, they’ll keep their job and be paid even more than before for the next six months.</p>
<p>It’s possible those earning more than $1,500 per fortnight will earn less than they did before in pay and benefits, depending on what the government does with the Fair Work Act.</p>
<p>Read more: The key to the success of the $130 billion wage subsidy is retrospective paid work</p>
<p>Exactly how it works out for workers who get JobKeeper will depend on the labour market. On one hand, they will be more attractive to employers because their employment comes with a big subsidy that new hires don’t bring with them. On the other hand, they might have few alternative employers to turn to. Jobs might be hard to find.</p>
<p>They’ll get to keep their jobs</p>
<p>Regardless, even if their pay is reduced, their situation will be much better than under the renamed Newstart. And to the extent that cutting their pay helps to keep the firm viable, it will secure a job for them on the other side.</p>
<p>Employers will also benefit. If a business stays open, it will get the benefit of its workers’ labour for free or at a big discount. It might look like corporate welfare, but it’s a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>Read more: Open letter to the prime minister: extend coronavirus support to temporary workers</p>
<p>A key objective of the scheme is to plug the hole in firms’ revenues to prevent them going under. Most would have been viable if it weren’t for the necessary public health measures governments have taken. Allowing them to fail would mean a pointless destruction of valuable resources.</p>
<p>The wage subsidy is somewhat crude and inevitably there will be some waste. Some firms will be given more money than they need, some workers will be given more, some less.</p>
<p>It was never going to be perfect</p>
<p>Given more time, the treasury could have designed something better targeted, less wasteful. It didn’t have it. The economy has never experienced so sudden a collapse.</p>
<p>But there are a few simple things the government could do to make it better.</p>
<p>It could include short-term casuals and visa holders, and it should take care not to weaken the Fair Work Act.</p>
<p>JobKeeper won’t prevent a serious contraction in the Australian economy, but it should give us a very good chance to bounce back on the other side.</p>

The Morrison government has defended excluding more than one million casual workers from $1500 a fortnight in coronavirus wage subsidies.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Mathias Cormann says casuals not covered under the JobKeeper scheme will be able to access the $1100-a-fortnight JobSeeker allowance and other welfare benefits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The JobKeeper payment is taxable. The JobSeeker payment isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he told Sky News today.</p>

<p>The $130 billion scheme will be passed when parliament sits tomorrow.</p>
<p>Drafting of changes to workplace law are expected to be finalised today after Industrial Relations Minister Christian Porter struck a deal with ACTU secretary Sally McManus.</p>
<p>While unions pushed for changes to be made through the Fair Work Commission, the government will instead legislate temporary amendments to the Fair Work Act.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s expected unions will be given an assurance they can pursue employer wrongdoing through the commission.</p>
<p>Labor&rsquo;s industrial relations spokesman Tony Burke believes there will changes to the legislation to allow a FWC role.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. But we are arguing that people shouldn&rsquo;t be left behind,&rdquo; Mr Burke told Sky News.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say you&rsquo;ve got to draw the line somewhere, but they&rsquo;ve drawn a very strange line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Labor will back the legislation but are likely to push for changes in parliament.</p>
<p>While the JobKeeper payment is expected to cover six million people, 1.1 million casuals who have been with their employer less than a year are set to miss out.</p>
<p>Another 1.1 million temporary migrant workers are also not covered.</p>
<p>A worker cleans his Sydney cafe after it was forced to close. (AAP)</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s mounting pressure from more than 120 faith, union, business, civil society and migrant groups to include overseas workers.</p>
<p>Acting Immigration Minister Alan Tudge said temporary visitors needed to look after themselves during the crisis.</p>
<p>Mr Tudge said sacked migrant workers would have to go home unless they could find another sponsor.</p>
<p>Migrant Workers Centre director Matt Kunkel said the vast majority of people on temporary visas couldn&rsquo;t go home because of closed borders or not being able to afford an airfare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cannot afford to leave anyone behind,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The National Retail Association, National Council of Churches in Australia, Migration Council of Australia and the Federation of Ethnic Community Councils of Australia support the call.</p>
<p>Unions and welfare lobby groups are also behind the push.</p>
<p>In full-page newspaper advertisements today, the group called on Prime Minister Scott Morrison to show leadership and help migrant workers.</p>

<h3 id="why-temporary-migrants-need-jobkeeper">Why temporary migrants need JobKeeper</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/325941/original/file-20200407-110267-1qcvclv.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;rect=11%2C0%2C3695%2C1844&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1356&amp;h=668&amp;fit=crop" alt="img">
The centerpiece of the Commonwealth government’s COVID-19 economic stimulus program is JobKeeper. Priced at A$130 billion, it will pay eligible employers $1,500 per fortnight for each eligible employee for up to six months.</p>
<p>The aim, according to the government fact sheet, is to</p>
<p>support employers to maintain their connection to their employees (as) these connections will enable business to reactivate their operations quickly – without having to rehire staff – when the crisis is over</p>
<p>But excluded from the scheme are workers on temporary visas (except for New Zealand citizens on Special Category Subclass 444 visas - they’re included).</p>
<p>This exclusion is wrong for four reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>It penalises the businesses that employ temporary workers</li>
</ol>
<p>The exclusion of temporary visa holders discriminates against the businesses that employ them.</p>
<p>Given there are close to 900,000 temporary visa holders with work rights (excluding New Zealand citizens) the discrimination will have a serious impact.</p>
<p>It will be particularly severe in industries that significantly rely on temporary migrants: among them hospitality (international students), agriculture (working holiday makers), health and aged care (workers on Temporary Skill Shortage visas).</p>
<p>The exclusion of temporary visa holders from JobKeeper will bring about distortions within and between industries. It will likely result in the closure of businesses that rely upon temporary migrants.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>It breaches fundamental rights</li>
</ol>
<p>Equal rights at work - regardless of migrant status - is a key principle of</p>
<p>This principle underpins Australia’s Fair Work Act which treats migrant workers as within its scope.</p>
<p>JobKeeper, which provides a workplace benefit through wage subsidies, departs from this principle.</p>
<p>Not only does it set a dangerous precedent, it is a particularly egregious breach.</p>
<p>Denial of the JobKeeper payment will mean the loss of jobs and livelihoods for many or most temporary visa holders.</p>
<p>Some will be forced to attempt to return to their countries of origin, which in some cases are less safe than Australia.</p>
<p>Among them are Italian working holiday visa holders.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Many of those affected are members of the community</li>
</ol>
<p>Temporary visa holders are only temporary in the sense that they have a limited right to stay.</p>
<p>Swinburne University’s Peter Mares has characterised Australia’s shift to temporary migration as “permanent” in two senses: it is an enduring change, and it has resulted in temporary visa holders residing in Australia for extended periods of time.</p>
<p>Philosopher Joseph Carens has rightly argued that such extended periods of residence provide a basis for community membership, given the contributions given and connections made, regardless of migration status.</p>
<p>Asking temporary visa holders to “go home” not only fails to recognise membership of the Australian community but also misses the fundamental point that Australia is home to many of these temporary visa holders.</p>
<p>Read more: Open letter to the prime minister: extend coronavirus support to temporary workers</p>
<p>This ought not be hard to understand: most overseas Australians would consider their country of residence to be their home.</p>
<p>The position of overseas Australians (of which there are hundreds of thousands) suggests another important perspective: the Golden Rule.</p>
<p>How would we view the actions of foreign governments that insisted that overseas Australians “go home” if they had insufficient funds due to COVID-19 restrictions imposed by these very governments?</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>It undermines the fight against COVID-19</li>
</ol>
<p>The hardship resulting from the temporary visa holder exclusion will undermine public health measures.</p>
<p>Temporary visa holders will increasingly swell the number of homelessness.</p>
<p>It is hard to “stay at home” if you don’t have one. Financial desperation will drive some to continue working even if unwell.</p>
<p>Other adverse consequences are likely. Desperate temporary visa holders will become exposed wage theft of the kind exposed by the 7-Eleven scandal, slowing Australia’s labour market recovery.</p>

<p>The recovery of higher education will be slowed down if international students are impoverished and unable to pay the fees necessary to continue their studies.</p>
<p>Temporary migrant workers ought to be part of JobKeeper, just as are other Australian residents and New Zealanders on temporary visas.</p>
<p>Excluding them breaches their fundamental rights, fails to recognise the community membership of many of them, and it will undermine Australia’s efforts to fight COVID-19.
