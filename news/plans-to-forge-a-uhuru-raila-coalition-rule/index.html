<p>Plans are underway to form a government of national unity that will bring on board opposition leaders like Orange Democratic Movement leader Raila Odinga, a senior Jubilee Party official confided in the Sunday Nation on Saturday.</p>
<p>Mr Odinga, the official noted, has technically been a government insider since his 2018 political truce with President Uhuru Kenyatta, “only that he has not been assigned any official roles”.</p>
<p>“The plans for the formation of a government of national unity are afoot and have been further influenced by the situation in the country, which requires all heads together in times of crisis,” said the official.</p>
<p>Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru, one of those championing the Building Bridges Initiative in the Mt Kenya region, confirmed that a government of national unity that will bring Mr Odinga even closer to the Jubilee administration was in the offing.</p>
<p>“Yes, there is such a plan,” she told the Sunday Nation. “Once the president entered into the Handshake deal with Mr Odinga, it was just a matter of time before this was actualised for the benefit of the nation.”</p>
<p>The president, Ms Waiguru added, has sufficient constitutional and legal tools for such an arrangement, including a major reorganisation of government to include his new partners in significant roles.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>WARNING SHOT</p>
<p>Pressed on whether the inclusion of Mr Odinga would water down or in any other way affect Deputy President William Ruto’s role in the government, Ms Waiguru quipped:</p>
<p>“As for the DP, only himself and his relationship with the principal players will determine his best role for the country’s overall benefit in such an arrangement.”</p>
<p>But, seemingly aware of the plans of a political deal with the Opposition, Mr Ruto on Friday took to Twitter to warn Jubilee members against what he termed as “ethnic coalitions”.</p>
<p>“The Jubilee fraternity should ignore propaganda peddled by desperados seeking ragtag ethnic coalitions,” Mr Ruto tweeted, noting further that “our progressive constitution vests power in party organs, not personalities”.</p>
<p>The ruling party, Mr Ruto continued, has no room for “selfish evil experiments meant to benefit brokers and their ilk”.</p>
<p>The deputy president has in recent days been on a collision course with senior Jubilee officials, including Secretary-General Raphael Tuju and Vice-Chairman David Murathe, for an attempt to wrest control of the running of the party from him.</p>
<p>A recent attempt to change the membership of the governing council of the party caught Mr Ruto unawares and forced him to quickly fire a protest letter to the Registrar of Parties.</p>
<p>RAILA&rsquo;S ROLE</p>
<p>The final decision on the matter is still pending, and the welcoming of opposition leaders into government has the potential of further muddying his political ambitions and relationship with President Kenyatta.</p>
<p>Sources in the party said last evening that the fate of Wiper Democratic Movement leader Kalonzo Musyoka and his Ford-Kenya counterpart Moses Wetang’ula will be decided in negotiations that are currently limited to President Kenyatta and Mr Odinga, but which could in the future bring in both of them.</p>
<p>Since the peace deal between President Kenyatta and Mr Odinga was brokered in the famed Harambee House Handshake of March 9, 2018, the ODM leader’s influence in government circles has grown immensely.</p>
<p>Apart from giving Mr Odinga a controlling stake in the mobilisation of support and funding for a constitutional change drive through the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI), the Head of State has also allowed the ODM leader to make policy pronouncements.</p>
<p>Mr Odinga is also accorded VVIP treatment by State agencies, and is said to receive regular briefings from Cabinet secretaries, unlike the DP, whose influence in the government is fast fading.</p>
<p>Even though Mr Odinga and the rank and file of his ODM party have been cagey about formally joining the government, Mr Murathe earlier this month hinted at it during talks with Central Organisation of Trade Unions Secretary-General Francis Atwoli and Devolution minister Eugene Wamalwa.</p>
<p>PULL TOGETHER</p>
<p>Mr Tuju neither confirmed nor denied knowledge of the plans, only telling the Sunday Nation that, as secretary-general of the party, he cannot express his personal opinion before any matter is formally deliberated upon by the party.</p>
<p>“I can only express decisions which have been made, which I communicate to the public,” he said. “I can’t express an opinion.”</p>
<p>On Mr Murathe’s assertions, Mr Tuju said: “The vice-chairman has that latitude, but my position is official communication.”</p>
<p>ODM Secretary-General Edwin Sifuna said that, in the wake of the current Covid-19 crisis, it was not right to discuss such political movements and alignments.</p>
<p>“Mr Odinga already made it clear that talk of a government of national unity is just that — talk. At the moment it is ridiculous to speculate about the forms of government to come when humanity is not sure we will survive this pandemic,” he said.</p>
<p>But political analyst Herman Manyora said a reorganisation of government appeared inevitable, “partly because of the coronavirus pandemic, but majorly arising out of the irreconcilable differences between President Kenyatta and his deputy”.</p>
<p>“Because of the pandemic, the country needs to pull together, and the absence of the Ruto team means the president has to turn to Raila’s side for support. The form the cooperation takes, and the timing, will be determined by the developments on the health front and the attendant social and economic challenges,” Mr Manyora said.</p>
<p>The current Jubilee wars, he noted, will also play a major role in the timing and shaping of “this inevitable coalition”.</p>
<p>REFERENDUM</p>
<p>Kimilili MP Didmus Barasa, an ally of Mr Ruto, said it was the prerogative of the president to reorganise his government, and as such he would not be surprised if a government of national unity was formed.</p>
<p>Including Mr Odinga in government, he added, will “answer my question and those of many Kenyans who have been seeking to understand his role in government for a while now”.</p>
<p>He said the president “is free” to go into any arrangement with the ODM leader “if this will end the rumours, conmanship and underhand dealings that undermine the deputy president”, but warned that Mr Kenyatta should be focusing on rescuing the economy post-Covid-19.</p>
<p>During a recent interview on a local radio station, Mr Odinga downplayed claims of a possible coalition with the ruling party, noting that his focus and that of the president after the Covid-19 pandemic will be a referendum to bring changes in the country through the Building Bridges Initiative.</p>
<p>Mr Murathe was the first to claim a possible formation of a government of national unity as a post-coronavirus agenda, following huge cracks in the ruling party that have pushed Mr Ruto to a corner.</p>
<p>“Post-coronavirus, this country probably needs a government of national unity to bring everybody together so that people focus on rebuilding the nation,” said Mr Murathe, adding that the country “cannot work if we have this kind of antagonism” where some people’s single focus is 2022.</p>
<p>Deputy President Ruto, he noted, only woke up when he felt his position in Jubilee was threatened.

<h3 id="president-kenyatta-announces-26000-new-jobs">President Kenyatta Announces 26,000 New Jobs</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/files/styles/article_style/public/images/media/President-Uhuru%20Kenyatta%20signs%20document.jpg?itok=Hwr090P8" alt="img">
President Uhuru Kenyatta has announced the creation of 26,000 new jobs to cushion the youth and the vulnerable against the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In his address to the nation on Saturday, April 25, President Kenyatta announced the creation of the National Hygiene Program, aimed at guaranteeing the youth employment and also taking care of the environment in the same beat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This initiative that will commence on April 29, 2020, is an initiative that we will call a National Hygiene Program. I believe that this initiative will create jobs and make our environment healthier at the same time,&rdquo; President Kenyatta stated.</p>
<p>He announced that in the next thirty days, the first phase of the program will be launched and will cater to 26,148 youth with a target of over 100,000 as more phases are launched over time.</p>

<p>President Kenyatta expressed optimism that with time, the government will be able to cater for a huge margin of Kenyans that was subsisting below the poverty line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This initiative added to the already existing 108,000 vulnerable households that are presently receiving direct cash grants, and the Ksh8 billion that the senior citizens program and the vulnerable families are getting, will continue to offer tangible relief to our families,&rdquo; he stated.</p>
<p>President Kenyatta informed that the inaugural National Hygiene Program would target residents in 23 informal settlements in seven of the counties most affected by the pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To demonstrate the principles of this approach, the making of facemasks will be undertaken by 4,048 tailors residing in these settlements and their neighbourhoods. They will make at least 250,000 masks per day,&rdquo; the president stated.</p>
<p>He also announced that measures were being put in place to ensure that those being employed would work under proper standards and protocols to reduce the rate of infection.</p>
<p>He further announced that the government had considered a number of measures to be effected once the country is declared free of the pandemic to ensure that the economy continues to grow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My administration shall, in particular, activate Medium, Small and Micro Enterprises (MSMEs) to manufacture basic equipment and supplies for domestic use and for exports.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This initiative shall be housed under the Universal healthcare (UHC) agenda and will utilize about Ksh1.5 billion,&rdquo; he stated.

Uhuru rules out lockdown as he puts quarantine escapees on notice</p>
<p>President Uhuru Kenyatta () has indicated that he is reluctant to order a total lock-down even as he faults Kenyans for what he terms as ‘deliberately taking lightly the threat of Covid-19&rdquo;. Talking to reporters today, the president said people who recently escaped quarantine by jumping over the walls of the Kenya Medical and teaching College (KMTC) will be traced, arrested and forced to complete the mandatory isolation period. He was also categorical that he was not interested in getting into the public feud between China and the United States on the origin of Covid-19 but was more interested in working with nations that will help Kenya overcome the disease and the economic recovery.</p>

<p>Likewise, President Uhuru said his administration was dealing on a case-to-case basis to repatriate Kenyans stuck in the United Kingdom, South Sudan, Dubai, India, China and other nations despite the closure of airports. The Head of State also disclosed that beginning this weekend, his administration would embark on targeted mass-testing of over 2,000 people a day in residential areas that have registered high numbers of infections and those in the frontline. He admitted that the economy had suffered a major blow especially in sectors like tourism, agriculture, education and manufacturing among others which was why he announced the reduction of Value Added Tax from 16 per cent to 14 per cent.</p>

<p>Addressing a myriad of issues in the wake of the coronavirus effects, the Head of State expressed his fear that a lockdown would lead to a hunger crisis in the country.</p>

<p>Even as he ruled out the lockdown route, he regretted to note that Kenyans lacked seriousness regarding Covid-19 which has turned out to be his administration’s biggest test in the fight against the pandemic. &ldquo;We did not want to lock down the whole country, and we allowed those that can go to work to do so, but follow the guidelines laid out. We are still working to ensure that other services like farming and food production go on,&rdquo; he said. “I am saddened that there are those who have declined to adhere to the guidelines including quarantine to enable us to defeat this virus in the shortest time possible and embark on the economy’s recovery.” In reference to his Big Four Agenda projects on food security, President Kenyatta disclosed that he was opposed to the lockdown because he wanted to allow farmers to grow their crops and get inputs like fertiliser to cushion the country against hunger. “We have not abandoned this agenda, we want to ensure the availability of the market chain and production. We will continue to buy maize and other food produce from farmers and allow them to farm maize, rice, cotton among others during this difficult time,” he said.</p>
