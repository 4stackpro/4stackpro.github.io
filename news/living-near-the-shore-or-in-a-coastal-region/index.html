<p>AHMEDABAD: Nearly 50,000 people living in coastal areas of South Gujarat and some 4,000 residents of the neighbouring Union Territory of Daman have so far been shifted to safer places ahead of the approaching cyclonic storm &lsquo;Nisarga&rsquo;, officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>They said that police have been deployed on all the beaches in Gujarat&rsquo;s coastal belt and people have been asked to remain indoors. &ldquo;As many as 50,000 living near the coastline in South Gujarat have already been shifted to safer places while work is in progress to evacuate more people,&rdquo; Additional Chief Secretary (Revenue) Pankaj Kumar said.</p>
<p>He said that the cyclone would have maximum impact on the coastal districts of Valsad and Navsari, followed Bharuch and Surat. &ldquo;It is expected that the wind speed will remain between 100 to 110 kmph in Valsad and Navsari when the cyclone hits the coast between south Gujarat and north Maharashtra. All the fishermen have already been called back from the sea. Salt-pan workers along with shrimp farm workers have also been shifted to safer locations,&rdquo; Kumar said in a statement.</p>

<p>Besides, another official said that some 4,000 people living close to the sea shore in the adjoining Union Territory of Daman have also been shifted to safer places. The nearly 50,000 people evacuated so far in Gujarat include 32,000 from Valsad district alone.</p>
<p>While the cyclone is expected to cross the state coast in the afternoon, light rain started in most parts of Valsad and Navsari districts since morning. &ldquo;We have shifted nearly 32,000 people living close to the sea shore to temporary shelters. The weather is cloudy at present but winds have not started yet,&rdquo; Valsad collector RR Raval said.</p>
<p>As many as 15 teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and six teams of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) have been deployed at different locations to help local administration in relief and rescue works, Kumar said.</p>
<p>He said that as a precautionary measure, about 236 large hoardings and 120 high mast lights have been removed from Surat, Valsad and other towns of coastal region. Around 250 ambulances and 170 emergency medical teams have been kept on stand-by in the South Gujarat region to address any eventuality, the official said.</p>
<p>The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has indicated that the cyclone may not make a landfall on the Gujarat coast. However, it will have an impact in the form of gusty winds coupled with heavy rainfall in the coastal belt.</p>
<p>As per the latest IMD release, the cyclonic storm Nisarga over East Central Arabian Sea is currently around 460 km from Surat.</p>

<p>It will cross north Maharashtra and adjoining south Gujarat coast between Harihareshwar and Daman, close to Alibaug of Maharashtra during the afternoon, with a maximum sustained wind speed of 100 to 110 kmph, it said.</p>
<p>The state MeT Centre said the cyclone will cause heavy rain in several parts of South Gujarat on Wednesday and Thursday. Barring the South Gujarat region, the cyclone will not have much impact in rest of the state, state MeT centre director Jayanta Sarkar said.

Stingray sightings off the Mazarrón and Cartagena coastline</p>
<p>At the weekend stingrays were sighted in both municipalities</p>
<p>It’s quite rare for these elusive and beautiful fish to swim in close to the shore of the Murcia Region but they are out there and on Saturday and Monday reports were received of Stingray sightings in both La Azohía, which is in the Cartagena municipality, and the playa del Rihuete, which is around five kilometres along the coast in the Mazarrón municipality.</p>
<p>The La Azohía sighting was on Saturday and the one in Mazarrón on Monday.</p>
<p>Tweet:Alfonso.Garrido</p>
<p>In both cases the ray was close in to the shore and apparently unperturbed by the proximity of curious bathers.</p>
<p>They’re generally found much deeper and tend to prefer depths of around 60 metres.</p>
<p>If you are fortunate enough to witness a ray swimming in close to shore be careful not to get too close; they’re not called stingrays for nothing and the tail contains a stinging spine with a venom gland at its base.</p>
<p>They’re not aggressive but won´t appreciate attempts to catch them, tread on them or grab their tail, so be careful and admire from afar!</p>

Lifeguards want everyone to heed the warnings and keep themselves and their animals safe this summer.</p>
<p>SAN DIEGO COUNTY, Calif. — Ocean waves and sandy beaches are among the many reasons why San Diegans and tourists love our region, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it all goes according to plan along the coast.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of people from out of town. There’s a lot of people who haven’t been to the beach in a while even if they do live in San Diego,” said Maureen Hodges, a Marine Safety Lieutenant with San Diego Fire and Rescue Lifeguards. “We do see a lot of people that make decisions that don’t turn out for the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That can encompass a list of things including what happened near La Jolla Cove last week. A dog, off its leash in an un-designated area, got swept out to sea near the cove. Bystanders reported watching it go under and struggling to stay afloat.</p>
<p>An eyewitness said the dog&rsquo;s owner was taking a video selfie at the time. While lifeguards did respond, the dog made it safely to rocks down the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think in that instance the dog made it to shore was leashed and exited The beach. We do make a lot of dog rescues,” Hodges said. “We get a lot of dogs at Sunset Cliffs, and sometimes at Torrey pines that will go down a trail, chase a ball or get stuck in a position.”</p>
<p>Sadly, in the age of social media, tragedies have happened. Sunset Cliffs has had several “selfie deaths,” and lifeguards have responded to numerous rescues possibly linked to someone trying to get the best shot for social media. Last may a man taking a selfie drowned after falling off the Oceanside Pier into rough waters.

<p><img src="http://carsonnow.org/sites/www.carsonnow.org/files/111764-nhpdoor.jpeg" alt="img">
The Nevada Highway Patrol has identified the victim in a fatal crash Thursday involving three motorcycles on State Route 207 Kingsbury Grade near Lake Tahoe in Douglas County.</p>
<p>Paul Bartell, 71, of Jackson, Calif., died at the scene of the crash, which happened June 11 after 2 p.m. in the area of Palisades Drive in the Stateline area, said NHP spokeswoman Hannah DeGoey.</p>
<p>The preliminary investigation shows a burgundy 1994 Harley Davidson motorcycle was traveling eastbound on SR-207 and entered a right hairpin curve. Traveling in the opposite direction were two motorcycles: a red 2016 Harley Davidson and a blue 2010 Harley Davidson.</p>
<p>The burgundy Harley Davidson, occupied by Bartell, veered left, crossing the double yellow centerline, and entered the westbound travel lane wrong-way and directly in the paths of the two oncoming motorcycles. The burgundy Harley Davidson struck the red Harley Davidson head-on and was subsequently struck by the blue Harley Davidson.

<h3 id="ancient-humans-feasted-on-shellfish-during-one-migration-out-of-africa">&ldquo;Ancient humans feasted on shellfish during one migration out of Africa&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/06/16/14/29670608-0-image-a-5_1592312930487.jpg" alt="img">
Prehistoric pioneers moving out of Africa and on to Arabia 5,000 years ago feasted on shellfish as a way to sustain themselves, a new study found.</p>
<p>Archaeologists from the University of York studied fossil reefs near to the now-submerged Red Sea shorelines that marked prehistoric migratory routes.</p>
<p>These routes took our ancestors out of Africa and to Arabia at the end of the Stone Age and the coast offered enough resources to make the journey sustainably.</p>
<p>The research team found that during periods of little rainfall when other food sources were scarce people would turn to crustaceans for sustenance.</p>
<p>The York team focused their study on the remains of 15,000 shells from sea creatures dating back 5,000 years to an arid period in the region.</p>
<p>Overview of the Farasan Island where thousands of shell fossils were found by the research team. This map of the southern Red Sea shows black dots indicating the main shell sites. The white rectangles indicate the three research areas where sites have been excavate</p>
<p>Drawing of a mature shell of the type that contained mollusks eaten by the ancient travellers</p>
<p>Marine molluscs have been a food source for more than 164,000 years but being able to study patterns and trends have ben hampered by the fact that the areas they were consumed are submerged or have been destroyed by sea-level change.</p>
<p>This led York researchers to find a new way to track the consumption of shellfish.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ecological information on the resilience of intertidal resources is crucial in assessing how attractive they were to past humans as a long-term source of food,&rsquo; they wrote.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of particular interest is the southern Red Sea and its function as the southern gateway out of Africa into Arabia during a period of aridity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Marine molluscs have been a food source for more than 164,000 years but being able to study patterns and trends have ben hampered by the fact that the areas they were consumed are submerged or have been destroyed by sea-level change</p>
<p>Prehistoric shell midden on the coast of the Farasan Islands (Saudi Arabia) where the shells were found and studied</p>
<p>With the coastline of original migratory routes submerged by sea-level rise after the last Ice Age, the team studied shells on the Farasan Islands in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>The researchers found that populations of marine mollusks were plentiful enough to allow continuous harvests without any major ecological impacts.</p>
<p>According to lead author, Dr Niklas Hausmann, their plentiful availability would have enabled people to live through times of drought - as was being experienced during this migration about 5,000 years ago.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The availability of food resources plays an important role in understanding the feasibility of past human migrations,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>For example, hunter-gatherer migrations would have required local food sources and periods of aridity could have restricted these movements.</p>
<p>With the coastline of original migratory routes submerged by sea-level rise after the last Ice Age, the team studied shells on the Farasan Islands in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our study suggests that Red Sea shorelines had the resources necessary to provide a passage for prehistoric people,&rsquo; Hausmann said.</p>
<p>The team said their findings suggest that shellfish may have been used in much earlier migrations out of Africa.</p>
<p>The southern Red Sea functioned as an important node in the network of human migration through time, most notably during the late Stone Age.</p>
<p>The study also confirms that communities settled on the shorelines of the Red Sea could have relied on shellfish as a sustainable food resource all year round.</p>
<p>It was a time when many other food resources, particularly those on land, were scarce and so people turned to the sea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Previous studies have shown that people of the southern Red Sea ate shellfish year-round and over periods of thousands of years,&rsquo; said Hausmann.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We now also know that this resource was not depleted by them, but shellfish continued to maintain a healthy population.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Farasan Bay is shown in these images - including the main areas of this study. Top left is Khur Maadi Bay, bottom left is Janaba West and right is Janaba East. We indicate the potential size of the near-shore area where shells were found</p>
<p>Southwards view from the area where the shells were found and were ancient humans would have walked on their way to Arabia 5,000 years ago</p>
<p>The southern Red Sea seascape consists of hundreds of islands, scattered along both shorelines together with two major archipelagos, the Farasan Islands and the Dahlak Islands, situated towards the southern end.</p>
<p>The sites in this study are all located on the Farasan Islands, which are on the Arabian side of the Red Sea, about 25 miles off-shore but inter-connected through smaller islands less than a dozen miles apart from each other.</p>
<p>The shellfish species found in the archaeological sites on the Farasan Islands were also found in abundance in fossil reefs dating to over 100,000 years ago.</p>
<p>This suggests that these shellfish have been an available resource over longer periods than archaeological sites previously suggested.</p>
<p>Co-author of the study, Matthew Meredith-Williams, from La Trobe University, said it was important to look at what was happening on land and sea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We know that modelling past climates to learn about food resources is extremely helpful, but we need to differentiate between what is happening on land and what is happening in the water,&rsquo; said Meredith-Williams.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In our study we show that marine foods were abundant and resilient and being gathered by people when they couldn&rsquo;t rely on terrestrial food.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The shorelines of the southern Red Sea are variable and have experienced dynamic shifts and geomorphological transformations in the past.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The implications of having a resilient, abundant, predictable and easily accessible coastal resource at one of the important nodes of human mobility - the southern Red Sea - adds an extra dimension to the study of Out Of Africa,&rsquo; they wrote.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The fact that these resources are also unaffected by arid conditions adds an additional complicating factor to arguments that past dispersal events were limited to periods of greater moisture availability.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The data showed that even with year round harvesting over long periods, the shellfish beds weren&rsquo;t negatively impacted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With the data presented here, we start to address the gap in quantifying the potential of marine resources in this key gateway of human dispersal through time,&rsquo; the study authors wrote.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The shellfish diversity and abundance found in the shell midden datasets indicate a rich ecological environment that is unaffected by the arid conditions of the terrestrial environment, providing sustainable resources to complement a mixed diet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The findings have been published in the journal Quaternary International.

<p>One of the primary objectives of the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) launched by the federal governmentthree years ago was aimed at diversifying the economy. With the price of oil in the global market always going up and down like a yo-yo, we do not need a prophet to tell us that the time has come for us to beam our searchlight on the non-oil sectorin the face of declining government revenue.</p>
<p>The 2020 national budget of N10.59 trillion ($29.42 billion)assumed an average price of oil at $57 per barrel if our production ranges between 1.7 million and 2 million barrels per day. That was not a bad projection although, on the face of it, the oil price benchmark appeared very ambitious. With the disruption wrought upon global markets by COVID-19 and multiple constraining factors, oil price crashed below $20 at one point with far reaching consequences for the Nigerian economy.</p>
<p>With the declining demand for our oil which accounts for 90% of export revenue, Zainab Ahmed, Minister for Finance, Budget and National Planning, has announced adjustments to the budget. She has also asked everyone to brace up for the inevitable economic recession that would follow. In the meantime, the Economic Sustainability Committee headed by vice president Yemi Osinbajo is working round the clock to come up with solutions to weather the economic crisis since the pandemic hit the world.</p>
<p>One area the federal government and Osinbajo’s committee should consider immediately as a major revenue alternative to oil is our blue economy. Unfortunately, Nigeria is not tapping into the potential of the blue economy but it is not too late to begin with baby steps. What is a blue economy? Navy Commodore Daniel Atakpa, the immediate past Commandant of the Nigerian Navy Hydrographic School and blue economy expert, answers the question as follows: “A blue economy is an evolving maritime ecological concept aimed at the sustainable exploitation of ocean resources for economic growth, citizenry well-being and national development. Nigeria stands to gain immensely if we adopt and implement a credible strategy for harnessing the resources of the blue economy considering that the country is strategically located within the resource-rich Gulf of Guinea.”</p>
<p>The oceans cover two thirds of the Earth’s surface and they are a precious resource. Emphasising the value of ocean resources, Natalie Parletta, a freelance science writer based in Adelaide — the coastal capital of South Australia — and adjunct research fellow with the University of South Australia, explained that the oceans are vital for planetary and human health. “Oceans help to buffer the impact of climate change. These delicate ecosystems also provide habitats for millions of species; more than half the oxygen we breathe and food for more than a billion people come from the oceans,” Parletta wrote in one of her essays published in Forbes and Cosmos magazines. She also noted that an ideal model of a blue economy revolves around decision making that integrates economic, social and environmental needs for optimal benefits for all.</p>
<p>Nigeria has a coastline of about 420 nautical miles and an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of 200 nautical miles which translates to a maritime area of 84,000 square nautical miles, says Navy Commodore Atakpa. Nigeria is situated in the Gulf of Guinea and if we do the maths right by using one nautical mile as the equivalent of 1.852 kilometres, Nigeria’s maritime space (290 square kilometres) is about one third of our land area (924 square kilometres). In other words, Nigeria’s maritime space is the sum of the land areas of the following States and Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory: Niger (76,363 sq km), Borno (70,898 sq km), Taraba (54,473 sq km), Kaduna (46,053 sq km), Lagos (3,343 sq km) and Abuja (7,315 sq km).</p>
<p>The current exploitation practice of the oceans in Nigeria is based on the traditional model: it is an unsustainable way of maritime practices of fishing, transportation and off-shore oil and gas exploitation. However, blue economy, according to the experts, incorporates the emerging sectors of marine biotechnology, deep sea mining, off-shore renewable energy and eco-tourism amongst others. These ocean resources are embedded in the Gulf of Guinea, a major natural endowment; it means Nigeria is ignorantly seating on a blue economy with massive economic potential for the country if properly harnessed.</p>
<p>We do not currently have a blue economy which began globally about 10 years ago. Even with traditional ocean economy which is the pathway to operationalizing the blue economy, we do not have reliable data. This is the time for policy makers to understand the concept of blue economy and embrace it as it is being done in other parts of the world.Three countries — Republic of Ireland; Republics of South Africa and Seychelles – provide exemplary models for the establishment of blue economy bearing in mind that the concept was operationalized in these countries in 2012, 2014 and 2015 respectively.</p>
<p>At the last International Maritime Week which held at Oriental Hotel in Lagos (September, 2018), it was agreed that Nigeria has what it takes to operationalize the blue economy and make it work for enhanced economic growth. It is evident that the absence of a strategic maritime economic blue print, flawed institutional framework, maritime insecurity, lack of data as well as withheld Carbotage Vessel Financing Fund (CVFF) are the bane of the maritime economy. Across Africa, fishing is a major economic activity in the oceans, lakes, rivers and fish farms. According to a UNDP report, fishing — which is a major source of income for fishing communities in the continent — employs about 12.3 million people between the ages of 15 – 64 years either as full or part time.</p>
<p>Writing for Raconteur magazine, freelance journalist Jon Axworthy listed five African countries with blue economy potential as follows: Madagascar, Somalia, Kenya, South Africa and Nigeria. Maritime transportation, deep sea ports, fishing, aquaculture and ship yards appeared to be common features in all the countries. However, sea cucumber farming is a big deal in Madagascar with 5,500 kilometres coastline.</p>
<p>In the case of Somalia with 3,000 kilometres coastline, the report indicated that their rich fisheries-based economy is threatened by the criminal activities of pirates thereby forcing foreign vessels to avoid Somali waters. The Kenyans are encouraged to eat more fish because the country lies within the lucrative tuna belt and it is estimated that there are between 150,000 and 300,000 tonnes of fish swimming through the country’s expansive 200 nautical miles exclusiveeconomic zone (EEZ). South Africa’s blue economy strategy is anchored on “Operation Phakisa” (Phakisa means “hurry” in Sesotho, one of the country’s traditional languages) and their area of focus is the growth of domestic shipping (marine transport and manufacturing) because, from about 13,000 trade cargo ships that visit South African Ports every year to deliver imports and export local produce and minerals, only a handful are registered under South African flag, Axworthynoted in his special report on Africa’s “five champions” of the blue economy.</p>
<p>Nigeria’s biggest economic potential in the traditional oceaneconomy, Axworthy further revealed, is in shipbuilding and repair yards in addition to aquaculture, deep-sea development and seafarer training. But due to lack of investment in these areas, Nigerian maritime operations have continued to losemoney to foreigners. Ideally, oil export revenues should stay with us if we have a national carrier but we also lose significant revenue because of foreign ships lifting oil from Nigerian ports.</p>
<p>These are challenges we must address for a successful blue economy model. First, the federal government should understand the concept of blue economy and buy into it; second, establish a legal and institutional framework and muster the political will to adopt changes required to foster a blue economy; third, government should appoint experts tocome up with a blue economy strategy, and four, a new Ministry of Blue Economy (MoBE) should be created to implement the strategy. The proposed strategy must be “inclusive, environmentally sound and sustainable”. There is no doubt marine activities will boost Nigeria’s revenue, a position canvassed by Olisa Agbakoba, senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN). He estimated that Nigeria’s maritime economy has the capacity to create over 40 million jobs and generate N7 trillion revenue annually (Agbakoba, O., “Strategic Action Plan for Nigeria’s Maritime Sector”, Law Blog, 26 May 2015).</p>
<p>As a blue economy expert, Navy Commodore Atakpa says it is important that we worry about dwindling land-basedresources and rising global population. By 2050, the global population is projected to be in the region of 9 – 10 billion people and Nigeria is expected to have a population of about N400 million people. The oceans would provide the shock absorbers the global population needs to survive. The experts have indicated that because of its resource endowment, the oceans can provide a means of livelihood for over three billion people.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Bjorn Gillsater, head of the Word Bank–UNHCR Joint Data Centre on Forced Displacement, attested to the value of ocean resources in his contribution to World Bank’s blog. “Blue economy is an asset that provides food, jobs, water and it is a source of economic growth,” Gillsater wrote. “It provides the source of livelihood for hundreds of millions of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world. By one estimate, it generates $3 – 6 trillion to the world economy. If it were a country, the oceanic economy would be the 7th largest in the world,” Gillsater stated.</p>
<p>However, exploiting the oceans comes with its own challenges – the precious resource is suffering from the effect of human activities. According to Gillsater, these problems have large implications in the global food supply chain and pose risks to human health. “Almost a third of the global fish stock is over fished; climate change is impacting the ecosystems in both the oceans and the coastline,” Gillsaterstated, sounding a note of alarm. Developments at some of the coastal areas have caused irreparable erosion; pollution and marine litter from both land and marine sources threaten the health of our oceans including its biodiversity.</p>
<p>The exploitation of ocean resources is receiving global attention. When the United Nations launched the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) five years ago with 169 targets to drive the goals, “Life Below the Oceans” was created as Goal No 14 (SDG14). This goal focuses on the sustainable management and protection of marine and coastal ecosystems. It also covers conservation and protection of ocean and aquatic life. The UN designed the 17 global goals to be a “blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all” and as a successor to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The expectation is that these goals would be achieved by 2030. According to Navy Commodore Atakpa, the UN recognises blue economy as an ecological economics development strategy that is re-enforced by SDG14 which advocates the sustainable use of ocean resources.</p>
<p>As part of the global response, Gillsater noted in his blog post that the UN, World Bank and 15 other global stakeholders agreed on a joint road map for global development of the blue economy concept and countries such as Canada, Fiji, Germany, Grenada, Kenya, Norway, Portugal, Sweden are providing leadership at national and global levels. To facilitate action for SDG14, the road map framed activities for the blue economy in five areas: harvesting and trade of marine resources; extraction and use of marine non-living resources; use of renewable non-exhaustible natural forces (blue energy); commerce and trade in and around the ocean, and those activities that indirectly contribute to the economy such as carbon sequestration, carbon protection, waste disposal and biodiversity.</p>
<p>The SDG office at the Presidency is expected to play an active role when a national policy framework to establish the blue economy is put together and it is essential to note that SDG14 will be very significant in this regard. Collaboration and engagement with states in the coastal region and agencies such as the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) will be helpful, too. It is also advisable for the SDG office to engage the services of a blue economy expert to articulate SDG14 strategy, implementation and progress.
