Among the headlines from yesterday’s meetings of the newly-empowered government and the national security council, one that caught the eye was the announcement of a cat diagnosed with coronavirus caught from its owner.</p>
<p>The cat was reported to have caught the virus from close contact with its owner, who had recently returned from Italy. When the cat became ill, its stool was examined and traces of the virus discovered.</p>
<p>The experts were quick to reassure pet owners that the case was exceptional, that animals were not considered a vector for the disease, and that there was no reason to be afraid either for their pets or for themselves.</p>
<p>But one animal virologist has raised questions about the whole story.</p>
<p>Hans Nauwynck is a professor at the faculty of veterinary medicine at the University of Ghent, and a specialist in virology. The news of the corona cat took him by surprise.</p>
<p>“Before sending this news out into the world, I would have had some other tests carried out,” he told Het Laatste Nieuws. “When you hear about this right now, I wouldn’t wish to be a cat tomorrow.”</p>
<p>The discovery was made by the vet faculty at Liege university, who concluded the infection passed from human to cat and not the other way around.</p>
<p>“Look, I have no criticism of my colleagues at Liege university,” he stressed. “The diagnosis has been made, I’ve no doubt about the result, but we’re dealing here with a PCR test, a way of identifying genetic material of the virus.”</p>
<p>The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test allows scientists to multiply a very small sample of genetic material to produce a quantity large enough to study.</p>
<p>“I’m simply questioning the interpretation of the results. The test is positive for corona, fine, but how was the test carried out? How was the sample taken, and can that result be trusted? I would advise people to slow down. There may somehow have been genetic material from the owner in the sample, and so the sample is contaminated.”</p>
<p>To be absolutely certain, he said, more tests should have been done to confirm the initial result, and certainly before making an announcement to the world.</p>
<p>“I think it’s too bad they didn’t look further,” he said. “There should also have been research carried out to see if the cat had produced antibodies. I’m worried that people will be scared by this news and animals will be the ones to suffer, and that’s not right. As scientists we ought to put out clear and full information, and I don’t think that has happened.”</p>
<p>In the latest update, the cat is doing well. Its owner is also recovering, albeit more slowly.</p>

<h3 id="first-known-cat-infected-with-coronavirus-reported-in-belgium">First known cat infected with coronavirus reported in Belgium</h3>

They were all fired up. An enterprising city kindergarten teacher&hellip;</p>
<p>A doctor shows the lungs of COVID-19 patient at the MontLegia CHC hospital in Liege, Belgium, today.</p>
<p>A cat in Belgian has tested positive for the coronavirus after catching the potentially deadly bug from an infected owner, officials said Friday.</p>
<p>The sick pet in Liège tested positive after showing classic symptoms of COVID-19 — including difficulty breathing — a week after its owner first fell sick, health officials told a press conference, the Brussels Times reports.</p>
<p>While it is the first known infection of a cat, two dogs in Hong Kong have previously tested positive — with the first, a 17-year-old Pomeranian, dying after returning home from quarantine.</p>
<p>“The cat had diarrhea, kept vomiting and had breathing difficulties. The researchers found the virus in the cat’s feces,” professor Steven Van Gucht said Friday, according to the outlet.</p>
<p>No information was given on the conditions of either the cat or its owner, the Brussels Times said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the World Health Organization insists that there is “no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can transmit COVID-19” to humans.</p>
<p>Van Gucht also stressed that the Liège case appeared to be the owner getting her pet sick.</p>
<p>“We want to stress that this is an isolated case,” he said, according to the Belgian newspaper. “The risk of animal-to-human transmission is very small.”</p>
<p>Belgium’s National Council for Animal Protection (CNPA) also told the paper that there is no known threat from pets.</p>
<p>“Animals are not vectors of the epidemic, so there is no reason to abandon your animal,” the agency said — while advising owners to “not rub their nose against their pets.”</p>
<p>As well as the cat, 7,284 people have been confirmed infected with coronavirus in Belgium, with almost 300 deaths, officials also said at the press conference.

<h3 id="caterpillar-cat-withdraws-guidance-on-coronavirus-concerns">Caterpillar (CAT) Withdraws Guidance on Coronavirus Concerns</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t92Gs3TrRC5VqsKiPIsbxw--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MzU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/dfbf477ce67e2ca9b1c9e4b00f36cf66" alt="img">
Caterpillar Inc. CAT recently withdrew its guidance for 2020 on account of the coronavirus outbreak. The company also announced that its supply chain has been disrupted owing to the coronavirus crisis. Further, it is temporarily suspending operations at certain facilities on account of weak demand and restrictions imposed by governments to contain the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>First detected in China, the coronavirus rapidly spread across the world and has been declared a pandemic. Per the World Health Organization’s situation report as of Mar 26, 2020, global affected coronavirus cases has shot up to 462,684, claiming 20,834 lives.</p>
<p>Supply Chain Impacted</p>
<p>Caterpillar stated that the coronavirus pandemic has impacted its supply chain. The company is monitoring the situation and supply chain teams have been executing business continuity plans. These options include, using alternative sources, air freight, rerouting orders to other distribution centers, while prioritizing the redistribution of the most impactful parts.</p>
<p>Few Facilities Suspended</p>
<p>Due to weak demand on account of uncertain economic conditions, potential supply constraints and government actions to curb the spread of the virus, Caterpillar is temporarily suspending operations at certain facilities. However, the company continues to run majority of its domestic operations and plans to continue operating in rest parts of the world, as permitted by local authorities. However, the company added that it may suspend operations at additional facilities if the situation warrants.</p>
<p>2020 Guidance Withdrawn</p>
<p>During its fourth-quarter 2019 conference call, Caterpillar had issued earnings per share guidance of $8.50-$1.00 for 2020. The mid-point of the guidance indicates a fall of 16% from the adjusted earnings per share of $11.06 reported in 2019. Caterpillar had then cautioned that end user demand would be down by about 4% to 9% thanks to the trade war tensions. Dealers were anticipated to reduce inventories by about $1 billion to $1.5 billion, due to the ongoing global economic uncertainty. The company has now withdrawn this guidance, citing that the uncertainty of the impact of the outbreak on its financial and operating results cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.</p>
<p>Taking Precautionary Measures</p>
<p>Caterpillar added that the company is taking all necessary steps to protect the safety, health and well-being of employees, customers, dealers, suppliers and communities. Preventive measures taken by the company include increased cleaning and disinfecting of facilities, advocating remote working when possible, restricting business travel, cancellation of certain events and limitations on visitor access to facilities and practicing social distancing.</p>
<p>Over the past year, shares of Caterpillar have plunged 16.6% compared with the industry’s decline of 22.9%.</p>
<p>The coronavirus outbreak has dealt a further blow to the manufacturing sector, which was already reeling under the protracted U.S.-China trade tensions and waning global demand. The U.S Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) released by the Institute for Supply Management had been below 50 (indicating contraction) for five consecutive months till December 2019. Even though the index climbed to 50.9 in January and came in at 50.1 in February, it seems unlikely that this recovery will stay, considering that manufacturing has been impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. Factory closures across the globe, impact of the restrictions imposed by different governments, supply chain disruptions, low demand for goods, availability of employees and workers, logistic costs, among others will hit the sector.</p>
<p>There has been a spate of guidance withdrawals by the industry players lately. Terex Corporation TEX, another player in the manufacturing and construction industry withdrew its guidance for 2020 and announced that it has suspended all share repurchases. Earlier this week, agricultural and construction equipment manufacturer, Deere &amp; Company DE withdrew its financial outlook for 2020 citing the COVID-19 outbreak. Another farm equipment maker, AGCO followed suit and withdrew its financial guidance for the current year. Production has been suspended in many of the company’s European facilities, primarily due to supply-chain constrains and material shortage. Additional production disruptions in other regions are expected as well.</p>
<p>Zacks Rank &amp; a Stock to Consider</p>
<p>Caterpillar carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).</p>
<p>A better-ranked stock in the Industrial Products sector is Sharps Compliance Corp SMED, which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today&rsquo;s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</p>
<p>Sharps Compliance has an estimated earnings growth rate of 800% for 2020. In a year’s time, the company’s shares have gained 57%.</p>
<p>The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All</p>
<p>Last year, it generated $24 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it&rsquo;s predicted to blast through the roof to $77.6 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s first trillionaires,&rdquo; but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.</p>
