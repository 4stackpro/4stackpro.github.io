<p>South Africa has announced its first deaths from coronavirus infection, and said cases there have passed the 1,000 mark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This morning, we South Africans wake up with sad news that we now have our first deaths resulting from Covid-19,&rdquo; the health ministry said on Friday.</p>
<p>Both deaths took place in hospitals in the southern province of Western Cape.</p>
<p>Security forces have begun enforcing a three-week nationwide lockdown in an effort to stem the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>All but essential movement is forbidden and both the army and the police are enforcing the measures.</p>
<p>Ahead of the midnight deadline there were long queues outside supermarkets as people stocked up on essentials.</p>
<p>How is South Africa fighting the virus?</p>
<p>Late on Thursday, President Cyril Ramaphosa visited soldiers before they were deployed from a base in the Soweto township of Johannesburg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I send you out to go and defend our people against coronavirus,&rdquo; he said, wearing a camouflage uniform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is unprecedented, not only in our democracy but also in the history of our country, that we will have a lockdown for 21 days to go out and wage war against an invisible enemy, coronavirus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the terms, food shops are allowed to stay open, but alcohol sales are banned - and Police Minister Bheki Cele urged South Africans to stay sober during the lockdown. Jogging and dog walking are also prohibited.</p>
<p>Image copyright EPA Image caption President Cyril Ramaphosa greeted troops prior to their deployment</p>
<p>On Friday morning, however, local media showed pictures of busy streets and queues outside supermarkets in the townships - where poverty and the volume of people make social distancing difficult.</p>
<p>A day earlier, heavy traffic was reported on the main roads out of Johannesburg, despite a government appeal not to go on long journeys.</p>
<p>Thousands of people thronged bus stations aiming to escape the city and stay with family in rural areas, raising fears that they could take the virus to older relatives who are retired in farms and villages.</p>
<p>Image copyright AFP Image caption Police in Johannesburg had already made arrests in the early hours of Friday</p>
<p>The authorities have warned that anyone violating the rules faces six months&rsquo; imprisonment or a heavy fine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If people are not complying, they (the military) may be forced to take extraordinary measures,&rdquo; Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula warned.</p>
<p>South Africa has already closed schools and banned gatherings of more than 100 people.</p>
<p>Although Africa as a whole has not been hit as hard as other parts of the world by the virus, experts fear underfunded health services on the continent could be quickly overwhelmed by a sudden rise in cases.</p>
<p>In South Africa there are additional fears for people living with HIV - particularly the estimated 2.5 million in South Africa who are not taking anti-retroviral drugs.</p>

<h3 id="south-africa-records-second-coronavirus-death-as-infections-jump-to-1280">South Africa records second coronavirus death as infections jump to 1,280</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/03/29/2020_03_29_91057_1585415568._large.jpg" alt="img">
South Africa&rsquo;s confirmed cases of the coronavirus increased by 93 to 1,280 people on Sunday and the death toll doubled to two, the Health Ministry said, as the country entered the third day of a national lockdown and officials announced new measures to deal with the economic fallout.</p>
<p>South African health officials said the 74-year-old man in the southeastern KwaZulu-Natal province had been diagnosed two days ago after showing flu-like symptoms and already had skin cancer.</p>
<p>South Africa entered a 21-day lockdown on Friday with people restricted to their homes and most businesses shuttered.</p>
<p>Earlier, President Cyril Ramaphosa officially declared 112 people who were under quarantine in a remote resort for two weeks after being repatriated from Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus began, as all testing negative and free to return home.</p>
<p>Treasury officials said on Sunday they were considering approaching the International Monetary Fund for emergency funds to fight the outbreak, the largest so far on the continent and which some experts fear may overwhelm the already stretched health system.</p>
<p>The Treasury said it was also introducing a tax subsidy of 500 rand (US$28) a month per worker to employers for the next four months to cushion financial losses suffered by firms from the coronavirus.</p>
