<p>The legend of the music industry Kishore Kumar won the hearts with his spectacular voice. He is the best and most excellent voice in the music industry. Let’s get closer to know more about his actual family.</p>
<p>The birth name of Kishore Kumar was Abhas Kumar Ganguly, born on 8th August in Madhya Pradesh. Born into a Bengali family, Kishore Kumar was the youngest of three older brothers and a sister. His father Kunjalal Ganguly was a lawyer and mother Gouri Devi, a homemaker.</p>
<p>Kishore Kumar was always passionate about singing as a kid. But people used to criticize him for not having the perfect voice. With the help of his brother Ashok Kumar, he joined acting and later switched to singing. But his brother was against him singing. His first marriage was with Ruma Guha Thakurta from 1950 to 1958. She was an actress and singer by profession. He had a son with her, Amit Kumar.</p>
<p>Later, Kishore Kumar married Madhubala, and their marriage lasted until she died in 1969. He then married Yogeeta Bail, but their marriage was against short-lived for three years. When he married Leena Chandavarkar, he had another son Sumit Kumar. Both his sons are singers.</p>
<p>Kishore Kumar’s life was filled with tragedy and was not so perfect. But surely he had perfection while singing. Today we have some great tracks that are spectacular and popular.</p>

<h3 id="batman-secret-files-3-review">&ldquo;Batman: Secret Files #3 review&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/batman-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Batman-Secret-Files-3.jpg?fit=781%2C1200&amp;quality=80&amp;strip=info&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
Whenever we get a copy of Batman Secret Files, it’s usually a gamble on whether or not we’ll get more than one good story. Unlike these epic, anniversary issues, DC doesn’t really pull in their top talent for this. They just use it as an opportunity to showcase some of the up-and-coming talent – especially as far as writers are concerned. That’s not an insult to the people contributing here, just the reality. Writing is a craft, and it takes time and experience to hone that craft. And who knows, today’s new talent could be tomorrow’s next big thing! The point is, I’ve found that it’s better to come into this with lower expectations, but hope for the best. Discover the talent that you like from these collections, then support that talent to the best of your ability.</p>
<p>Anyway, for this collection, each story depicts Batman’s first encounter with the assassins that Tynion used at the beginning of his Batman run. Unfortunately, only one story really added anything to the characters for me, so consider this foreshadowing.</p>
<p>“Don’t Hold Your Breath” ft. Cheshire</p>
<p>The first story in the collection is written by Vita Ayala, with art by Andie Tong. This story captures Batman’s first encounter with Cheshire when she targets a rich activist in Gotham City. For the most part, it’s your standard story that you would expect when Cheshire is involved. She has a target, Batman plans to stop her, she’s going to use her poisons… You get the idea.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, instead of simply stopping Cheshire, Batman uses this as an opportunity to try and convince her that she doesn’t need to be evil, and that she can be good… And I don’t understand why. I mean, I understand wanting to reason with people, but I do think Batman is much better at being aware of who is and isn’t open to the idea of this. People open to reform typically show signs of this. We don’t get any of that here. Batman meets Cheshire and automatically moves into a, “It doesn’t have to be this way…” speech… And nothing about it feels authentic.</p>
<p>I mean, at this point, Batman knows who Cheshire is, how she’s trained, and how many kills she has. Then, for no logical reason, he decides to try and reason with her before stopping her. Aside from feeling unauthentic, it also felt as though Ayala was trying too hard. I get what Ayala was going for, but it just didn’t land.</p>
<p>There is, however, a fun little twist at the end that I did appreciate as Cheshire gets an upper hand on Batman. I felt like that was handled quite well, and I enjoyed Bruce’s moment with Leslie Thompkins… But I practically love any chance I get to see Leslie!</p>
<p>As for the art, I’m a huge fan and Andie Tong’s work here! I wasn’t familiar with him coming into this, but damn… He’s so good! Between the character work and the storytelling, he definitely has a strong craft, and I have no doubt that it will only get better with time. There are elements of his work that remind me of David Marquez and Jorge Jimenez, so that should say something. Give this guy a regular schedule, stat!</p>
<p>6/10</p>
<p>“Hunters” ft. Merlyn</p>
<p>The next story on the slate teams Batman with Green Arrow, as the two try to track down Merlyn in Gotham City. Written by Phillip Kennedy Johnson, with art by Victor Ibanez and colors by Jordie Bellaire, this is definitely one of the stronger stories in the collection. Right off the bat, it’s fun to see Batman and Green Arrow together, and I really enjoy the banter created between the two – the cape and age gags are pretty damn funny. It’s clear Johnson has a solid grasp on who these characters are, and he tailors his story around that.</p>
<p>After discovering that Merlyn has come to Gotham, Batman calls on Green Arrow knowing the two have a history together. Ollie explains to Bruce how Merlyn operates and thinks, and differentiates Merlyn’s approach compared to another assassin. According to Ollie, Merlyn doesn’t just kill someone, he hunts them. He takes his time, watches his prey, learns their habits, and then he strikes… And that’s exactly what he does here.</p>
<p>Batman has to rescue a young girl from a burning building. It’s clear the entire set-up is a trap, but he goes in anyway. As you might expect, Merlyn launches his assault from there, and it’s a test of whether or not Batman will survive to save the girl… Yes, it’s a Batman book, we know he survives, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t anything to take away from this story.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this story has very little to do with Merlyn, and everything to do with Batman and his resilience. We always get stories about what Batman endures, and there are times where writes fail to edit themselves, and hence you get those pesky Bat-god conversations. Well, this is definitely not one of those moments! While Johnson definitely puts Batman through the ringer, it never feels as though it’s too much or unbelievable, and it’s all in how he has the encounter play out.</p>
<p>The story is beautifully illustrated by Victor Ibanez with colors by Jordie Bellaire. Ibanez clearly has a bright future in comics, and I love the texture and grittiness he brings to his art. In fact, I’d say the balance between cleanliness and the grit that he brings is perfect for a street-level hero – something Bellaire definitely honed in to and elevated.</p>
<p>The thing I was most impressed with though, is the range of emotions and expressions Ibanez delivered. Typically, I find that this is what artists struggle the most with. Too often characters look dead or emotionless in the face, but he adds so much storytelling through expression here! Even the impact of blows or arrows… It’s genuinely great work all around, and I can’t wait to see more of him!</p>
<p>7.5/10</p>
<p>“Muted” ft. Mr. Teeth</p>
<p>My least favorite entry for this collection comes from Mariko Tamaki and Riley Rossmo. This story features Mr. Teeth… and… There’s really not much to this story at all. Basically, Mr. Teeth has entered someone’s home and about to kill them, before Batman stops him. The story is less focused on Mr. Teeth, and instead his target.</p>
<p>The approach is intended to be similar to horror films or slasher flicks, and the idea is that the panels are building suspense, but it didn’t really work for me. I think it’s hard to build suspense in this way for this medium.</p>
<p>All of the heavy-lifting here is done by Rossmo. Generally speaking, I’m not the biggest fan of his aesthetic. I respect it, it’s just not my cup of tea. That being said, I don’t think he presents his best work here. Everything featuring the victim and her cat looks and feels rushed, but the “horror” elements are done incredibly well!</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, this story just fails to deliver anything worthwhile. We don’t learn anything new about Mr. Teeth, nor do we really get much of a plot… It was just a letdown, and I feel the creative team could’ve done so much more.</p>
<p>4/10</p>
<p>“Afraid of America” ft. Gunsmith</p>
<p>Wow. Wow! Wow! Dan Watters and John Paul Leon… This is some quality craftsmanship here! Before I get into anything, I often talk about a creator’s craft in my reviews. There’s more to writing than just delivering a story. There’s more to art than just pretty pictures… This story proves that point! From the script to the art, the work here is masterclass, and I want to see more of these two together! Give them a book, get out of their way, and just let them create, because I promise you, you’ll get classic stories that will be revered for decades.</p>
<p>Alright, let me hop off of my soapbox now. “Afraid of America” showcases Batman’s first encounter with Gunsmith after Gotham City holds a gun buy-back program to help get guns off the street. Seeing it as an opportunity, Gunsmith decides to infiltrate and takes these guns, but knowing it will catch the attention of Batman, he decides to take some hostages as leverage.</p>
<p>The story seems simple enough, but I’ll be damned if it doesn’t pack some heavy punches. What’s really interesting, is that when Tynion first launched his run, Gunsmith was the assassin that I was least interested in. He just seemed like your stereotypical jarhead/ redneck (I say that with love as I consider myself a redneck in many ways – East Texan here), and I didn’t find him interesting. After reading this book, I want more Gunsmith. And this is what separates a strong quality writer from a good storyteller. Watters delivers so much nuance and detail, giving us insight into how Gunsmith plans his missions, his mindset, and how he prepares for variables that might come into play. I absolutely love it.</p>
<p>The story flashes back and forth between the encounter and Gunsmith sharing the story with someone. I love the slight arrogance that Watters and JPL create with him, but more importantly, the slightest realization that his arrogance stems from the fact that he knows he’ll be successful because people will view him as nothing more than a jarhead/redneck. It’s the slightest little tinge, but it’s present.</p>
<p>There’s also a subplot concerning one of the hostages, how he responds to the situation, and his fear that he will become a target of Batman’s because of what he ultimately chooses to do out of desperation. I can’t stress how good this is! I don’t even want to get into details, I just want you to read the story, because you deserve to experience it!</p>
<p>More than anything, as a writer and as a fan, I appreciate how much thought went into crafting this story. Over the past year, I’m sure I’ve come off as an asshole, endlessly yelling, “work your story!” in my reviews… So, this… This restored my faith in the craft of writing. I’m not familiar with Dan Watters or his work, but you better believe I’m about to look up other books of his and buy them!</p>
<p>As for JPL… Well, I’ve been singing your praises ever since I discovered your work on the “Terminal” story you did during the New 52.</p>
<p>DC… Seriously… Just ask these two men what they would like to do, and let them do it!</p>
<p>10/10</p>
<p>“Fool’s Gold” ft. Deathstroke</p>
<p>And, from one extreme to the next… While I loved “Afraid of America,” I feel like we take a turn for the worst here, and it’s all because of execution. James Tynion teams with Sumit Kumar for this story, and, across the board, I feel as though the work is just mediocre.</p>
<p>“Fool’s Gold” showcases more of the fight between Batman and Deathstroke from Batman #86 that many readers felt they were cheated from experiencing… but after reading this, I wish we would have just left things as they were. The action, honestly, it just there to be there, and it shows.</p>
<p>The point of this story is to showcase how the Joker recruits Deathstroke for his mission. Surprise, surprise! I’m not really a fan. I don’t really find any of the character portrayals, and instead of focusing on making this interesting, Tynion just does it. I don’t believe the Joker’s approach, and I don’t believe Slade’s reason for joining. It all seems forced. And because there really isn’t a story worth telling here – I mean, there could’ve been, but it wasn’t thought out very well – we’re left with a writer trying to tell us something when he has nothing to say. It’s a shame, and ties back to many of the comments I made in my review for Batman #92.</p>
<p>As for the art, Kumar’s work is fine, but he needs a lot of finesse. While I think the storytelling aspect of his work is solid – which I will say is the most important job of an artist – his aesthetic is very inconsistent. Characters look different from panel to panel, and there are hardly any backgrounds. It’s hard to make a believable world that feels real and lived in when 90% of your panels are just splashes of color.</p>
<p>4/10</p>
<p>Recommended if:</p>
<p>You want to learn more about the assassins featured early in Tynion’s Batman run.</p>
<p>Pick this up for the Gunsmith and Merlyn stories</p>
<p>Overall: When all is said and done, I don’t really know if there’s much substance or reason to justify buying this book. On one hand, stories like “Afraid of America” are well worth the cost of this book on its own – seriously, the work from Dan Watters and Jon Paul Leon is a masterpiece – but then there’s a whole lot of mediocre and subpar work here as well. The art, in general, stands head-and-shoulders above everything else, so maybe get it for that reason. If you haven’t learned to fully appreciate art in comics yet, then this book isn’t for you.</p>
<p>SCORE: 6.5/10

<h3 id="hizbul-chief-syed-salahudin-attacked-in-islamabad-injured">&ldquo;Hizbul chief Syed Salahudin attacked in Islamabad, injured&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.canindia.com/wp-content/themes/pennews/images/no-thumb.jpg" alt="img">
New Delhi, May 29 (IANS) Unable to carry out Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) diktat of creating unrest in Jammu and Kashmir lately, terror outfit Hizbul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin reportedly faced the ire of his masters when he was attacked by unknown assailants in Islamabad on May 25, sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>Sources in the intelligence agencies said that Mohammad Yusuf Shah alias Syed Salahuddin, who also heads the alliance of pro-Pakistan terrorist groups called the United Jihad Council, was “grievously injured in the attack and is undergoing treatment”.</p>
<p>Salahuddin has been declared a global terrorist by the US State Department.</p>
<p>“He was targeted near the Hizbul Mujahideen compound in Islamabad on May 25,” said a top intelligence agency officer. The attack was reportedly planned and executed by the ISI. It was not meant to kill Salahuddin, but to send a message to him and the members of his terror outfit that they were gradually becoming redundant.</p>
<p>The difference between Salahuddin and his ISI handler started ever since the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir in August last year.</p>
<p>Intelligence sources said that since Salahuddin or his outfit were clueless about the Indian government’s move to abrogate Article 370, which granted special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir, the ISI had gradually started withdrawing its support to the Hizbul Mujahideen.</p>
<p>Further, sources said that ISI had also directed Salahuddin to carry out a massive attack in the Valley against the Indian government’s move, but he failed to deliver on that ground.</p>
<p>The sources said that when ISI started sending him messages of withdrawing its support, Salahuddin approached Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) leader Raja Farooq Haider and others.</p>
<p>He promised the ISI of carrying out attacks in the Valley, source said. In the meantime, ISI stoped providing adequate training, weapons and ammunition to the Hizbul cadres.</p>
<p>In addition, the lack of support to Hizbul in Kashmir weakened him further. But after the elimination of top Hizbul commander Riyaz Naikoo by the Indian security forces in an encounter in Kashmir earlier this month, Salahuddin went on the back foot, sources said. He openly criticised the ISI during an interaction with the Hizbul cadres in PoK.</p>
<p>Earlier in May, after Naikoo was killed, Salahudin had said that Indian security forces’ position in the Kashmir Valley was strong. A video of the him saying so had surfaced.</p>
<p>Salahuddin was heard saying in a gathering in Rawalpindi to mourn the killing of Naikoo that even after the killing of five security personnel, Indian security forces continued to be in a position of strength.</p>
<p>He was speaking in Urdu with a Kashmiri accent and could be heard saying, “It’s a shock for all of us (killing of Riyaz Naikoo) but these sacrifices are going on in Kashmir since long.”</p>
<p>He was heard saying that since January this year, 80 Mujahideens (terrorists) were eliminated by the security forces and all of them were highly educated and trained.</p>
<p>The intelligence agencies had stumbled upon the video recording of the gathering where Salahuddin could be seen ranting about the Indian security forces and singing praises for Naikoo.</p>

<p>New Delhi, Jun 6 (IANS): India and China military top brass began talks on Saturday to resolve the stand-off situation in Eastern Ladakh region and de-escalation of forces across the Line of Actual Control. The meeting is being held in Moldo on the Chinese side opposite Chushul.</p>
<p>Indian military delegation is headed by the commander of Leh-based 14 Corp Lieutenant General Harinder Singh and the Chinese are led by Major General Liu Lin, Commander of South Xinjiang Military Region.</p>
<p>Both countries are engaging in dialogue to resolve the stand-off in Eastern Ladakh region, particularly at north bank of Pangong Tso where the Chinese People&rsquo;s Liberation Army has attempted to change status quo.</p>
<p>They attempted to change the status quo by putting up shelters and setting up a camp in areas that were under Indian control so far.</p>
<p>Before this, talks between major general-rank officers between two countries took place on June 2 that remained &ldquo;inconclusive&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Chinese troops in large numbers have been camping at Finger 4 area of the Pangong Lake. India also matched these numbers in deployment there. The Pangong Lake is divided into 8 fingers. The mountainous spurs jutting out into the lake are referred to as fingers. So far India has been controlling fingers 1 to 4 and China controls the area between 5 and 8.</p>
<p>There is an Indian post near Finger 4. However, India claims the entire stretch till Finger 8. The area between Finger 4 and 8 has been a matter of dispute and has often witnessed confrontations.</p>
<p>The clash took place at Pangong Lake on May 5, leaving several from both sides wounded.</p>
<p>Sources further pointed out that the standoff was not a spontaneous reaction to India&rsquo;s road construction in Ladakh. Unusual activities were first noticed in few weeks before that clash.</p>
<p>The current standoff in Ladakh is not the usual patrolling faceoff but part of the new combative strategy that was rolled out by China after Doklam.</p>
<p>In 2017, there was a 73-day stand-off between India and China. The standoff was at the India-China-Bhutan tri-junction Doklam. China&rsquo;s road construction in Bhutanese territory was seen as an attempt to change the status quo by India and finally the road work had to be stopped.

Even before the finale of the eleventh season of Indian Idol, Sunny Hindustani has made himself a top contender. The contestant seems to have worked his magic not just on the viewers of the show, but also celebrities from the music industry. After making his Bollywood debut with The Body and being signed by the show’s judge Himesh Reshammiya, Sunny Hindustani has won over Kishore Kumar’s son Amit Kumar as well. Sunny’s rendition of the legend’s hit reportedly made Amit Kumar instantly sign him.</p>

<h3 id="hemant-kumar-singer-with-a-perfect-baritone">&ldquo;Hemant Kumar: Singer with a perfect baritone&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.indianexpress.com/2017/06/hemant-kumar-birthday-759.jpg?w=759" alt="img">
Hemant Kumar was an authority on symphonies. (Source: File Photo) Hemant Kumar was an authority on symphonies. (Source: File Photo)</p>
<p>“Ye nayan dare-dare, ye jaam bhare-bhare, zara peene do…. .”</p>
<p>No price for guessing the singer. No one who has listened to this number can ever forget that it was sung by Hemant Kumar in his unmistakable baritone. By the way, only two singers in Indian film music have been known to have a perfect baritone: Pankaj Mullick and Hemant Kumar.</p>
<p>Even the great Rafi had an orotund (next to baritone) voice. Hemant Kumar’s Hispanic baritone (similar to that of Frank Sinatra or Harry Belafonte) makes this song a lover’s anthem with its delectable cadences and rolling pauses against the backdrop of night. Kaifi Azmi wrote this song for the film Kohra (1964), after Hemant Kumar requested him to write a similar number that was already sung by the maestro for the Bengali film, Deep jwele jai (1959).</p>

<p>Gouriprasanna Majumder wrote an immortal song (Aei raat tomaar-aamaar…) that was composed and sung by Hemant Kumar. Not to be outwitted by anyone, the legendary Kaifi penned an equally romantic masterpiece. In fact, those who have listened to both the versions are still unable to decide who wrote it better. And Hemant Kumar sang it so soulfully in both the languages that one is wonderstruck.</p>
<p>ALSO READ | The intriguing love story of Amrita Pritam and Sahir Ludhianvi</p>
<p>Born with a baritone, Hemant Kumar was a trained singer. He never had to develop his naturally booming voice. He was born in Varanasi on June 16, 1920. Years ago, actress Shakeela described his voice thus: Hemant da ki aawaaz mein shaam ki Ganga ki laharon ki khamoshi hai (Hemant da’s voice has the placidity of river Ganga when it flows leisurely in the evening). He indeed had that rare placidity that echoes in the consciousness. Which is why Hemant’s voice is called ‘Nida-e-maztoob’ (Goonj ki aawaaz) in Urdu. Very few people are aware that Hemant had the best and most perceptive mike-sense. On this count, he was on an even keel with Rafi. This needs some elaboration.</p>
<p>A voice (especially a musical voice) sounds different through a mike as sophisticated recording equipment were not available in those days. So, expert singers would make distance-adjustments to sound natural and in accordance with the requirements of the number to be sung. A slight distance from the mike makes the voice sound heavy and from a close distance, the echo gets subdued.</p>
<p>Kalyanji-Anandji didn’t have to tell this to Hemant when he sang for them in the film: Majboor (1964, Biswajeet/Waheeda Rahman). Penned by Indivar, Hemant da sang the song: Tumhein jo bhi dekh lega, kisi ka na ho sakega. If you listen to this number, you’ll find that his innately echoing voice has a diminished degree of echo effect in this song. He optimised the use of the mike. That was his intrinsic quality. Moreover, he was aware of the colloquial range of Biswajeet as both were from Bengal. Bisawjeet had a bass-tenor combination voice. So, when Do Dil hit the marquee in 1965, viewers got to hear Rafi’s voice on Biswajeet for that lovely number: Tera husn rahe mera ishq rahe, toh ye subho ye shaam rahe na rahe…(Kaifi Azmi/Music: Hemant Kumar). Hemant Kumar had an excellent instrumental sense that pared down to minimalist arrangements. Since he himself was a composer-cum-arranger-cum-singer, he knew when and where to use a particular instrument to create a lasting effect. To quote Urdu poet Riyaz Khairabadi, Meri aawaaz ko darkaar hai sahi saaz ki (My voice needs a proper instrument). That’s the reason, his compositions never had instrumental noise. Just listen to Ya dil ki suno dunia waalo, Kuchh dil ne kaha…, dheere-dheere machal…(all from Anupama, 1966).</p>
<p>Extremely knowledgeable about the western classical music and a die-hard fan of Sebastian Bach’s reverberations, Hemant da’s music has the same quality of ‘coming from a distance to assimilate into heartbeats’ (Trevor Malinx’s description of Bach’s ethereal compositions). Apropos, Hemant Kumar was an authority on symphonies. Kaifi Azmi, who wrote many gems for Hemant, once wrote poetically about Hemant’s brand of singing and music: Ghul-sa jaata hai suroor fiza mein/ Teri aawaaz ko sunoon ya teri mausiqi ko sarahoon’? (Intoxication gets assimilated into the ambience/Should I listen to your voice or shall I admire your musical skills?). Or, who can forget all the numbers of the film Khamoshi (1969)? Humne dekhi hai inn aankhon ki mahakti khushboo (Lata) or Tum pukaar lo (Hemant) or Woh shaam kuchh ajeeb thi (Kishore Kumar).</p>

<p>Gulzar’s pen produced these hauntingly beautiful numbers and Hemant Kumar embellished them with his music to make every song a burnished gem. The way Hemant sings, Dil bahal toh jaayega, iss khyaal se, haal mil gaya tumhara apne haal se………Mukhtsar-si baat hai, tumse pyaar hai…. The cathartic effect of these lines can only be felt and experienced but can never be described. Despite being a Bengali with not much command of Hindi/Urdu, he so correctly and tunefully enunciated the Urdu word mukhtasar (brief, trivial, inconsequential).</p>
<p>Gulzar once said that his platonic number Humne dekhi hai inn aankhon…. required an equally sacred tune and Hemant da provided that. A master of Rabindra Sangeet, Hemant Kumar was one of the exponents of Tagore’s Rabindra Sangeet. Along with Debabrata Biswas, Sagar Sen and Kanika Banerjee, Hemant carved a niche for himself. The commendable dimension of his musical persona was that he could strike a balance between Bengali and Hindi cinema music. No other singer or composer so masterfully tackled two musical genres of discrete nature. Hemant da was also very magnanimous and emotional. When Uttam Kumar passed away on July 24, 1980 and Rafi on July 31, Hemant cried and said, ‘I’ve lost my two younger brothers.’ It’s worthwhile to mention that he was very close to Bengal’s matinee idol Uttam Kumar and Biswajeet and admired Rafi for his singing prowess.</p>

<p>Whenever Rafi got an opportunity to sing a Bangla song, he’d go to Hemant Kumar’s place and learn the proper pronunciation of certain words from him. Modest to a fault, he never mentioned a single song that he sang. ‘”I just sang and forgot,” he once told a film critic. His favourite songs were Rafi’s Dil ki aawaaz bhi sun mere fasane pe na jaa (Humsaya, Shevan Rizvi/Music: O P Nayyar, 1968), Manna De’s Piya maine kya kiya, mujhe chhod ke jaiyo na.. (Film: Uss Paar/ S D Burman, Lyrics: Yogesh Gaud, 1974) and Mukesh’s Woh tere pyaar ka gham&hellip;(My love, Anand Bakhshi/Daan Singh, 1970). He was very fond of Lata Mangeshkar and Gita Dutt and liked almost all the songs they sang! Many of these singing greats are no more, but their musical memories are forever with us. This reminds one of P B Shelly’s immortal lines: ‘Music, when soft voices die, vibrates in the memory’ or Qateel Shifai’s poignant lines, Goonjegi teri sada tere jaane ke baad/ Hongi aakhein purnam, hoga dil naashaad (Your voice will echo once you’re gone forever/The eyes will be tearful and the hearts, sad). So very true!</p>

<h3 id="ruma-guhathakurta-passes-away">&ldquo;Ruma Guhathakurta passes away&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.telegraphindia.com/derivative/THE_TELEGRAPH/1691751/2X1/image99f6b318-de97-403c-adbe-40ade62d0dbc.jpg?v=50" alt="img">
Ruma Guhathakurta The Telegraph file picture</p>
<p>Ruma Guhathakurta, actor, singer and founder of Calcutta Youth Choir, passed away on Monday at her Ballygunge Place residence. Family members said she died in her sleep. She was 84.</p>
<p>Though she mostly stayed with elder son Amit Kumar in her first husband Kishore Kumar’s house in Mumbai, she had returned to Calcutta a month ago to visit her younger son Ayan Guhathakurta. “Even last evening, she was watching the World Cup match with me,” Ayan said.</p>
<p>Amit, who arrived from Mumbai in the evening with stepbrother Sumit Kumar and daughter Muktika Ganguly, bid an emotional farewell to his mother.</p>
<p>“She spent the last 10 years of her life with me in Gaurikunj. In April, she asked me to take her to Calcutta. I had protested mildly pointing out that the doctor was against it. But she had a strong attachment to this house, so I could not refuse. She had wanted to breathe her last in Calcutta and that is what happened.”</p>
<p>It was his mother who, he said, had taught him “everything”.</p>
<p>“She showed me quality films, from Laurel Hardy to Charlie Chaplin. She created my interest in cricket, taking me to Eden as a child. She loved and would make me listen to Western classical and jazz music. It was she who introduced me as a singer in 1977 to the Calcutta audience at a programme at La Martiniere school after Baba (Kishore Kumar) did so in Bombay in 1974. She was an all-rounder.”</p>
<p>She, indeed, was.</p>
<p>Ruma, whose film career spans over six decades, was born on November 21, 1934, in Calcutta. She started her career as a dancer and trained under Uday Shankar at his Almora centre. Thereafter, she moved to Bombay, where she married singer Kishore Kumar in the early 1950s. They got divorced in 1958. She later married writer-director Arup Guhathakurta and had two children — singer Sromana and sound engineer Ayan.</p>
<p>Ruma, Satyajit Ray’s niece, acted in two of his films — Abhijaan (1962) and Ganashatru (1989). “My father was a bit unwell during Ganashatru. Rumadi and my mother together looked after him during the shooting,” recounted Sandip.</p>
<p>She also acted under filmmakers Tapan Sinha, Tarun Majumdar, Rajen Tarafdar, Goutam Ghose and Aparna Sen. Her last big screen appearance was in Mira Nair’s The Namesake (2006).</p>

<p>Among the films where she played a major role are Palatak, Antony Firingee, Ashi Te Ashio Na, Balika Badhu, Dadar Kirti, Bhalobasa Bhalobasa and Wheelchair.</p>
<p>Jwar Bhata, a 1944 black-and-white Hindi film, will be remembered for being the debut of both Ruma and thespian Dilip Kumar. Ruma was 10 year old then. Her other Hindi films were Mashaal, Afsar, Raag Rang and Paar. She also played a role in Aparna Sen’s first film 36 Chowringhee Lane (1981). She acted in her husband Arup’s directorial venture Panchashar.</p>
<p>As a playback singer, she lent her voice to a number of films, ranging from Lukochuri in 1958 — which featured two popular duets with Kishore, Mayabonobiharini Horini and Ei toh hethay — to Amrita Kumbher Sandhane in 1982.</p>
<p>Along with Salil Chowdhury, Guhathakurta founded the Calcutta Youth Choir in 1958, which is known for singing folk and mass songs. The choir played a key role in popularising songs like Aaj joto juddhabaj, Bharatbarsho surjer ek naam, O Ganga boichho keno and Waqt ki awaz. The last-named album was released by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in Delhi.</p>
<p>“Indiraji held Ma in high regard. Ma was attending the inauguration of the AICC session in Salt Lake in 1972 when Indiraji stopped the performance of Vande Mataram and asked Ma to sing and teach the singers,” Ayan recalled.</p>
<p>The choir also performed in Dhaka at the first anniversary celebration of the liberation of Bangladesh. Her choir members, who arrived in numbers at her residence to pay their last respects, lauded her for her leadership qualities. “She was like a strict and loving guardian. When we had rehearsals at the HMV studio she used to cook and bring meat dishes for all of us,” recalled tabla player Dipankar Acharya.</p>

<p>Rehearsals would be held regularly in the mezzanine floor of the Ballygunge Place house on Mondays and Thursdays, with musicians like V. Balsara in attendance, till chief minister Jyoti Basu provided a plot on Prince Anwar Shah Road where the choir then shifted. “We had a minimum of 50 shows every month, 10 for the party (CPM) and 40 of our own,” said vocalist Abhijit Sur. “When we travelled, a whole train compartment would have to be booked for the 70 of us.”</p>
<p>“The choir was her first child. But I never heard her do riyaz at home. She was a natural singer,” said Ayan.</p>
<p>Among her film colleagues, Bhanu Bandyopadhyay was close to her and would often drop by. In her last days, she loved watching old films on television, family sources said.</p>
<p>Chief minister Mamata Banerjee visited her residence twice in the day and tweeted her condolence. Also present were cousin Sandip Ray, actress Debasree Roy (who had acted with her most notably in Dadar Kirti), minister Indranil Sen and Left Front veteran leaders Biman Bose, Shyamal Chakraborty and Sujan Chakraborty. Her last rites were performed at the Keoratala burning ghat with state honours.
