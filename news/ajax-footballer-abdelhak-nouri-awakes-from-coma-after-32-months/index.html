Abdelhak Nouri, a midfielder for Dutch football giants Ajax, has woken from a coma after two years, eight months and 19 days.</p>
<p>The player&rsquo;s brother Abderrahim said the 22-year-old woke up and showed signs of life, Dutch daily De Telegraaf reported late on Thursday.</p>
<p>More:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is going well with Appie [Abdelhak]. Yes, what is good? He&rsquo;s awake, he&rsquo;s asleep, he&rsquo;s eating, he&rsquo;s burping, but he&rsquo;s not getting out of bed,&rdquo; Abderrahim told the Amsterdam-based newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At good times there is a form of communication, then he moves his eyebrows. He just can&rsquo;t keep it up for long, that seems to be top sport for him,&rdquo; he said, adding that Nouri was at home with his family and &ldquo;aware of where he is&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Cardiac arrest</p>
<p>The Dutch-Moroccan midfielder collapsed during a friendly match between Ajax and Germany&rsquo;s Werder Bremen on July 8, 2017 in Austria due to a cardiac arrest, which caused serious brain damage.</p>
<p>Amsterdam-based Ajax were later forced to admit that their on-field treatment of the player was inadequate. Club doctor Don de Winter was fired.</p>
<p>Winter is believed to have deviated from UEFA&rsquo;s guidelines, beginning resuscitation attempts too late. Ajax Chief Executive Edwin van der Sar said at the time a defibrillator should &ldquo;have been used sooner&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had this happened, it&rsquo;s possible that Abdelhak would have come out in a better condition,&rdquo; Van der Sar had said in a statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t certain, but it&rsquo;s a possibility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We recognise our responsibility and liability for the consequences of this.&rdquo;

<h3 id="ajax-abdelhak-appie-nouri-is-back-at-home---prosoccertalk">Ajax: Abdelhak &lsquo;Appie&rsquo; Nouri is back at home - ProSoccerTalk</h3>
<p><img src="https://soccer.nbcsports.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2020/03/GettyImages-826446048.jpg" alt="img">
This week at ProSoccerTalk we will be detailing what we love about each Premier League club competing in the 2019-20 season and next up it is Southampton.</p>
<p>[ VIDEO: Premier League highlights ]</p>
<p>Each day we will release details on why who adore each team in particular as we remind ourselves just how awesome the PL is as we await its return following the suspension due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Time to focus on the Saints.</p>
<p>An amazing academy: From Gareth Bale, Adam Lallana, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Theo Walcott and Luke Shaw in recent years to Alan Shearer and Matt Le Tissier in the past, Southampton have always had a reputation of being eager to play youngsters and that helps massively with recruiting the best young players from around the UK and Europe. Their training facility in the New Forest national park is geared around developing young talent and if you are a fan of Southampton youâ€™ve seen some of the best young talents in recent history pass through the club. The odd player like Le Tissier or James Ward-Prowse will stick around for their entire careers but one of the things we love most about Southampton is how often new players come through their academy. This season their most recent win against Aston Villa saw five academy products involved for Saints and one for Aston Villa, as they continue to develop top young talent which provides the club with players they donâ€™t have to pay for, plus they can sell them on for huge profits. Will Smallbone, Michael Obafemi and Jake Vokins are the latest youngsters who will break through in the coming months. And so the conveyor belt continues.</p>
<p>Becoming the best feeder club in the Premier League: A feeder club, selling club, call it what you want, but thereâ€™s no doubt Southampton have become the top team to develop promising talent and then sell players on for huge profits. Sadio Mane, Virgil van Dijk and Morgan Schneiderlin were bought by Saints, improved at St Maryâ€™s and then sold on for huge profits to the Premier Leagueâ€™s big boys. Southamptonâ€™s fans obviously do not enjoy seeing their best players sold each season but it provides them with valuable income to compete with the top 10 teams. Due to their huge overhaul in 2014 when Mauricio Pochettino left for Tottenham and Shaw, Calum Chambers, Lallana and Dejan Lovren followed him, new manager Ronald Koeman was able to lead Saints to seventh and sixth place finishes in back-to-back seasons. With four-straight top eight finishes from 2014 to 2017 with Europa League appearances and cup runrs, Southampton became the model of consistency despite losing their best players and managers. We have to give a special mention Pochettino and Koeman who both moved on to bigger jobs but owe Saints a lot for allowing them to thrive in the Premier League since their return to the big time in 2012. Moussa Djenepo, Jan Bednarek and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg are the latest examples of players bought for relatively small sums from Europe and developed into Premier League regulars at Saints. Southampton are a family club and their is a close connection between the fans and players, which allows them to develop away from the spotlight of some of Englandâ€™s bigger cities.</p>
<p>Danny Ings: The local lad played for Bournemouth, Burnley and Liverpool before returning home to play for his hometown team and boy has he made up for lost time. Ings, 27, didnâ€™t get into Saintsâ€™ famed academy as a youngster and took a long, tough, winding round to get back to St Maryâ€™s. After several injury-plagued seasons at Liverpool he is now fully fit and this season heâ€™s been a revelation with 18 goals in all competitions for Saints. He is the reason they are clear of relegation trouble up until this point in the season. Everybody loves Ings. Jurgen Klopp and every single Liverpool fan adores him and thereâ€™s not a neutral out there who isnâ€™t happy to see him scoring goals and playing with a smile on his face. Ings is on the verge of the England squad and he leaves everything out on the pitch each time he plays. He is wearing the number nine shirt and scoring goals for his hometown team and he grew up in a house just three miles from St Maryâ€™s stadium. Ings is home and Southampton are so glad their $22.5 million signing from Liverpool is feeling comfortable and, most importantly, scoring goals.</p>
<p>â€˜Klopp of the Alpsâ€™ has a clear plan: It is safe to say Ralph Hasenhuttl has a clear playing philosophy and plan for Southampton and now he has been in charge for 18 months you can see things starting to come together. Southampton have one of the youngest teams in the Premier League so thereâ€™s still a lot of mistakes in their play, especially defensively, and Hasenhuttl has been hamstring by his predecessors making several mistakes in the transfer market with pretty much all of the $100 million they received from Liverpool for Virgil van Dijk in January 2018 now spent on players who are out on loan. The so-called â€˜Klopp of the Alpsâ€™ is expected to sign a new long-term contract at Saints in the coming months and he loves giving young players a chance to shine, just like he did at RB Leipzig before he arrived in the Premier League. Hasenhuttl loves young, hungry players who are brave, press high and excite the fans. After Leicester smacked Southampton 9-0 earlier this season, Hasenhuttl went back to basics and Saints have been superb in recent months with wins against Chelsea, Leicester and Tottenham some of the highlights. Hasenhuttl completed his coaching badges in Germany at the same time as Klopp and their playing philosophy is eerily similar. The Klopp of the Alps looks set to stabilize Saints after recent relegation scraps and if he is ever handed money to spend, he could certainly push them back into the top 10.</p>
