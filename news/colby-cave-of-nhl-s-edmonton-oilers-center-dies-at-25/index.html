(CNN) NHL center Colby Cave, who played for the Edmonton Oilers and the Boston Bruins, has died. He was 25.</p>
<p>The Edmonton Oilers and Cave&rsquo;s family announced the news on Saturday morning. He passed away days after doctors at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto operated to remove a colloid cyst putting pressure on his brain, according to NHL.com.</p>
<p>He had been in a medically induced coma since suffering a brain bleed overnight Monday, his team said</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is with great sadness to share the news that our Colby Cave passed away early this morning,&rdquo; his wife, Emily Cave, said in a statement</p>
<p>&ldquo;I (Emily) and both our families are in shock but know our Colby was loved dearly by us, his family and friends, the entire hockey community, and many more. We thank everyone for their prayers during this difficult time.&rdquo;

<h3 id="oilers-colby-cave-receives-support-from-teammates-while-in-coma-you-just-pray-that-he-wakes-up">Oilers’ Colby Cave receives support from teammates while in coma: &lsquo;You just pray that he wakes up&rsquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/04/Colby-Cave-Connor-McDavid-Getty-Images.jpg" alt="img">
Edmonton Oilers’ Colby Cave is receiving an outpouring of support from teammates past and present as he remains in a medically induced coma following a brain bleed and surgery to remove a cyst earlier this week.</p>
<p>Oilers’ captain Connor McDavid appeared optimistic about Cave’s recovery when speaking to reporters during a video conference call Thursday, asking fans to keep the 25-year-old’s family in their “thoughts and prayers.”</p>
<p>WIFE OF EDMONTON OILERS’ COLBY CAVE GIVES UPDATE ON MEDICALLY-INDUCED COMA</p>
<p>“This is devastating news, Colby is such a strong guy, he’s a good Saskatchewan boy and he’s as tough as they come and if anyone is going to get through it, it’s going to be Colby Cave,” McDavid said, according to TSN.</p>
<p>“I think all the fans out there and everyone needs to keep Colby, Emily his wife and the entire family in their thoughts and prayers and send out good vibes for them. We can just think and pray that he comes out of this and pray that the family can get through it as well. I can’t imagine how hard it is on them.”</p>
<p>McDavid described Cave a “well liked [guy] in our dressing room.”</p>
<p>“You just pray that he wakes up and that family is OK,” he continued.</p>
<p>EDMONTON OILERS’ COLBY CAVE IN MEDICALLY INDUCED COMA AFTER SURGERY TO REMOVE CYST FROM BRAIN</p>
<p>Cave’s family is also receiving support from his former organization, the Boston Bruins.</p>
<p>According to The Athletic, the Bruins coaching staff and players that knew Cave from his time with the organization from 2014-2019 are recording messages for Cave’s wife, Emily, to play for him over a communication system as the threat of COVID-19 has prevented her from going into the room with him.</p>
<p>“Hopefully that helps,” Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy told the website. “Anything we can do. Every little bit helps and if we can chip in with some encouraging words, then that’s what we’re going to do.”</p>
<p>Cave was placed in a medically induced coma on Tuesday after suffering a brain bleed and undergoing surgery to remove a colloid cyst that was causing pressure on his brain.</p>

<p>Cave scored one goal in 11 games with the Oilers this season. He spent time with the American Hockey League’s Bakersfield Condors, scoring 11 goals with 23 points in 44 games.</p>
<p>Before he joined the Boston Bruins for the 2014-15 season, Cave played five seasons for the Western Hockey League’s Swift Current Broncos. He joined the Oilers in 2019.</p>
<p>Fox News’ Ryan Gaydos contributed to this report.

<h3 id="boston-bruins-to-record-messages-for-former-teammate-colby-cave-whos-in-coma">Boston Bruins to record messages for former teammate Colby Cave, who&rsquo;s in coma</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/09/USAT/0d62a555-7656-454c-bd05-63e4cbae75c8-Colby_Cave.jpg?crop=2251,1266,x1,y0&amp;width=2251&amp;height=1266&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" alt="img">
The Boston Bruins are doing their part to help out former teammate Colby Cave, who&rsquo;s in a medically induced coma.</p>
<p>Cave, 25, who played for the Bruins organization from 2014-19 and is now with the Edmonton Oilers, is in a Toronto hospital after having surgery to remove a colloid cyst that was causing pressure on his brain.</p>
<p>Because Cave&rsquo;s wife, Emily, can&rsquo;t go into the room with him, members of the Bruins organization will record messages for her to play to her husband over a communication system.</p>
<p>“Hopefully that helps,” Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy told the Athletic. “Anything we can do. Every little bit helps and if we can chip in with some encouraging words, then that’s what we’re going to do.”</p>
<p>Emily had posted a heart-rending message on Instagram Wednesday about her husband&rsquo;s condition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please wake up,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;Please wake up. It’s all I can keep asking, “he’s going to wake up right?” We need a miracle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The center had played in 23 games for the Bruins and 44 with the Oilers after he was picked up on waivers in January 2019.</p>
<p>Cassidy also coached him with the American Hockey League Providence (Rhode Island) Bruins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he enjoyed his time in Providence and Boston,&rdquo; Cassidy told the Athletic. &ldquo;His wife got to know all the girls and he was very tight with the players here. They formed a good bond. Colby’s a likable guy; he’s hard not to like.”
