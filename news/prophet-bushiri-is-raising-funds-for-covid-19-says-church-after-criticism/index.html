The Enlightened Christian Gathering (ECG) church has dismissed social media criticism about its leader Shepherd Bushiri asking for money from his followers.</p>
<p>The church said Bushiri was on a global fundraising campaign to raise money needed in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>A video of the self-proclaimed prophet telling his followers to pay their tithes and offerings to a displayed bank account was doing rounds on social media over the weekend.</p>
<p>“You are saying, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a Sunday and I cannot go without my offering.&rsquo; There&rsquo;s a church account I&rsquo;m putting on the screen right now,” says Bushiri in the 27-second video.</p>
<p>“The prophet intends for raise more money from willing well-wishers across the globe — the money needed to buy ventilators, face masks, gloves and hand sanitisers, which will be given freely to any place where it’s needed,” said Bushiri’s spokesperson Ephraim Nyondo on Monday.

<h3 id="bushiri-says-demonic-covid-19-is-only-targeting-certain-people">Bushiri says ‘demonic’ Covid-19 is only targeting ‘certain people’</h3>
<p><img src="https://citizen.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bushiri2_91195-250x166.jpg" alt="img">
Enlightened Christian Gathering church leader Shepherd Bushiri’s video clips in which he addresses the coronavirus outbreak, which has now infected more than 700,000 people globally and killed more than 30,000 have caused a bit of a stir on social media.</p>
<p>In one clip, Bushiri says this “demonic” virus is targeting only certain people and it will disappear once it has done its job.</p>
<p>He says: “You see, this thing, the coronavirus, there are people who it is targeting. You must know it’s a very demonic thing. When those people who are being targeted are over, it will disappear.”</p>
<p>In another clip, Bushiri said God had instructed him to rebuke the “demon” that could only disappear if the church prayed. He further told his followers they were protected from the virus.</p>
<p>He said: “Before we begin to pray, the Holy Spirit has led me to rebuke a certain demon. I want you to know you and your families, Africa, the whole world, God said I should rebuke the demon of coronavirus. You spirit, wherever this demon is, it can only stop if the church, servants of God, can stand up and pray and coronavirus will disappear. I stand up and command this demon to come out! You will disappear in the name of Jesus…I protect you from this virus.”</p>
<p>In another clip, Bushiri said the virus was a sign of the end of times and that it would never end. According to him, it would only change from one tragedy to another.</p>
<p>“You see, this sickness, people are always asking when will it end. The answer is simple, this is a sign of end times. It will never end, it can only change from one name to another. The moment you say it must end you mean the signs of the end of times to end. They will never end, it will just change from one tragedy to another,” he said.</p>

<h3 id="bushiri-honours-malawi-filmmaker-sukez-for-forbes-recognition">Bushiri honours Malawi filmmaker Sukez for Forbes recognition</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nyasatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20200404-WA0000-e1585990098750.jpg" alt="img">
Prophet Shepherd Bushiri has congratulated filmmaker Gift Sukez Sukali for being listed by Forbes as one of Africa’s greatest young entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Bushiri said this on his Facebook page which has about 4 million followers: “I am proud of you and your achievements that will shock the world.</p>
<p>“Never forget the words I keep on telling you; ‘there are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure.’</p>
<p>“I can not wait to see the new movie you are directing (FATSANI) breaking records; you will always have my support. Congratulations son!”</p>
<p>Sukez is the founder and director of HD Plus Creation Company Limited.</p>
<p>Writing about Sukez, Forbes said: “He was seen with nothing but a camera, working from a backroom focusing on where his passion would take him.</p>
<p>“Using borrowed cameras, lights and computers, Sukez was able to save up enough to buy his own HD Camera which cost $300.</p>
<p>“With the flash of a camera, the picture became clear and HD Plus Creation Company Limited was born, offering media consultancy services and video content creation.”</p>
<p>Sukez told Forbes that the passion he had for creative visuals fueled him to work very hard every day and it eventually paid off in 2016 when he managed to register the company and with time, the demand for my services grew.</p>
<p>Today, Sukez owns two offices and a video production department and employs up to 18 staff.</p>
<p>One of Sukez’s most early notable work was when he worked with Akon, Yvonne Chaka Chaka, Jah Prayzah and P-Square to produce and direct the making of the 2017 African leaders for change theme song, The Song for Africa.</p>
<p>His company has also produced content for organizations such as UN Malawi, UNICEF and Standard Bank.</p>
<p>The biggest highlight of the business was when they worked on a film directed by Mark Spencer titled Whistleblower shot in Australia, Japan and Malawi.</p>
<p>Last year, they also took part in shooting and working on set for two Australian movies, The Drover’s Wife and Fallout.</p>
<p>Sukez plans to take his knowledge working internationally to produce quality content for Malawians.</p>
<p>“Malawi lacks so much in terms of technology, as a result, we fail to have the right connections and network to help boost the business internationally, but we try with the little capacity we have,” he says.</p>
<p>“When I look at my future and the company, my vision is to employ more than 1,000 young people by 2030 in Africa and this includes actors, scriptwriters, directors, producers, cameramen, just to mention a few.”</p>
