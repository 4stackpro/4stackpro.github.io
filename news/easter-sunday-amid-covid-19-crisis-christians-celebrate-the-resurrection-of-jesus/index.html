Normally, by the time you were reading this, many in our community — perhaps you and your family — would have been returning from sunrise church services.</p>
<p>But today isn&rsquo;t exactly normal.</p>
<p>This is Easter Sunday, the day Christians celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ—the holiest day of the year in many denominations.</p>
<p>The Gospels tell us Christ rose from the dead three days after he was crucified. Of course, no one knows exactly what the date was. So Easter became a movable feast, it&rsquo;s date determined by the phase of the moon.</p>
<p>Easter also marks the end of Lent, a 40-day period of fasting, penance and prayer that commemorates the 40 days Christ spent in the wilderness, where he withstood temptation from Satan.</p>
<p>After Christ was crucified, his body was given to Joseph of Arimathea, who had the body wrapped in fine linen and placed in a sepulchre—a tomb—carved out of rock. Then great stone was used to seal the tomb.</p>
<p>The Gospel of St. Mark tells what happened next:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him. 16:2 And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun. 16:3 And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre? 16:4 And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great. 16:5 And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted. 16:6 And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him. 16:7 But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Appear he did. And the resurrection has been the basis of Christian faith ever since.</p>
<p>Over the centuries, various religious groups and scriptural scholars have disagreed over the details of the resurrection, but the message remains clear. The sacrifice of Christ — crucifixion, death and resurrection — is central to the salvation of man. And even the cornonavirus pandemic can&rsquo;t change that.</p>
<p>A Happy Easter to all.

Evidence, history is on the side of Jesus&rsquo; resurrection</p>

<p>These are very trying times. There is an enemy out there at the microscopic level, wreaking all kinds of havoc in people’s hearts and minds and lives. The economic consequences alone of the coronavirus could possibly be felt for years to come.</p>
<p>The big problem in life, of course, is the threat of death.</p>
<p>But the coronavirus is not going to cancel Easter – though it may cancel our traditional celebrations of it. But Easter hope defangs the threat of the coronavirus because Jesus has taken the sting out of death.</p>
<p>After a bee stung a boy one day, his young brother was frightened as the insect continued hovering around him. But his father told him not to worry – there was only one stinger in that bee, and his older brother had already received it.</p>
<p>Jesus is our older brother, and He has taken the sting of death upon Himself. As the Apostle Paul would say, “Oh death, where is thy sting?”</p>
<p>Easter hope is not just a pious sentiment. There is ample reason to believe that Jesus bodily rose from the dead, historically.</p>
<p>For Christian television, I once interviewed Dr. Dana Harris of Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in the Chicago area. She told me, “Christianity rests on the historical proclamation that Jesus rose from the dead.”</p>
<p>Harris added, “I would say that it’s virtually impossible to maintain the idea that we can separate religious truths from historical facts and it has to do with the nature of Christianity. Christianity is fundamentally dependent on historical truths. In other words, if Jesus is not resurrected from the dead, then we don’t have Christianity.”</p>
<p>But what about the idea, promoted by skeptics, that perhaps this was just a legend from the ancient world? One man has an interesting take on that. Lee Strobel, former legal affairs editor for The Chicago Tribune, received his legal training at Yale Law School.</p>
<p>When his wife started going to church, he worked hard to disprove the faith, so he could reclaim her, and the two could live happily ever after, as agnostics.</p>
<p>But his quest to disprove Christianity had an unexpected result: He became a believer in the very thing he tried to falsify. He wrote all this up in his classic book, since made into a motion picture, The Case for Christ.</p>
<p>In an interview for D. James Kennedy Ministries, Strobel noted, “One very powerful evidence is that we have a report to the resurrection of Jesus that has been dated back by scholars to within months of His death. So, what we have is, in 1 Corinthians chapter 15, starting in verse 3, a creed, a report of the early church that says, Jesus died—why? For our sins, He was buried, and the third day He rose from the dead. And then it mentions specific individuals and groups to whom He appeared.”</p>
<p>Strobel adds, “And if that creed developed so early, the beliefs that make up that creed go back even earlier. Probably, one of the greatest classical historians who ever lived, A.N. Sherwin-White of Oxford, studied the rate at which legend grew up in the ancient world. And he determined that the passage of two generations of time is not even enough for a legend to grow up and wipe out a solid core of historical truth.” With the Christian reports of the resurrection, notes Strobel, “We’ve got a ‘news flash from ancient history.’ So that is a very powerful bit of evidence.”</p>
<p>The interesting thing about the resurrection of Jesus is that the earliest skeptics of the event were the disciples themselves. They were only convinced because Jesus appeared to them over and over. Then they became so convinced, they went out and became unstoppable in their proclamation – in some cases, even when it meant they would be put to death for their testimony.</p>
<p>As Lee Strobel puts it, “We have nine ancient sources inside and outside the New Testament confirming and corroborating that the conviction of the disciples is that they encountered the resurrected Jesus. That is an avalanche of historical data. When you consider most of what we know from ancient history is from one or two sources, but nine ancient sources inside and outside the New Testament [corroborating the disciples’ conviction], that is a convincing amount of evidence that convinced me that the disciples encountered the resurrected Jesus. It changed their lives, it changed everything about them.”</p>
<p>Covid-19 may have set the world’s teeth at edge. And ultimately it is a reminder of our mortality. We are not going to escape this world alive. But thank God for Jesus, the elder brother, who has taken the sting out of death for those who believe. Nothing, including Covid-19, will ever cancel Easter.

<h3 id="on-an-easter-under-quarantine-pope-calls-resurrection-a-contagion-of-hope">On an Easter under quarantine, Pope calls resurrection a ‘contagion of hope’</h3>
<p><img src="https://cruxnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Foto-3_DSC6266-1024x683.jpg" alt="img">
ROME – Pope Francis Easter Sunday prayed for those suffering due to either global conflict or the coronavirus, saying Christ’s resurrection brings both light and hope to the darkness of an oppressed and suffering world.</p>
<p>“Like a new flame this Good News springs up in the night, the night of a world already faced with epochal challenges and now oppressed by a pandemic severely testing our whole human family,” the pope told viewers of his livestreamed Urbi et Orbi blessing (“to the city and to the world”), speaking of the global COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>Easter, he said, offers humanity “a different ‘contagion,’ a message transmitted from heart to heart – for every human heart awaits this Good News. It is the contagion of hope,” he said, insisting that it’s not a “magic formula” that makes humanity’s problems disappear.</p>
<p>The Urbi et Orbi is generally a policy speech as well as a blessing and Francis held to form, calling for debt relief for impoverished nations, easing of international sanctions, relief for the unemployed, European solidarity, and an end to armed conflicts, all styled both as a response to the pandemic and an expression of the Easter spirit.</p>
<p>“The resurrection of Christ … is the victory of love over the root of evil, a victory that does not ‘by-pass’ suffering and death, but passes through them, opening a path in the abyss, transforming evil into good. This is the unique hallmark of the power of God,” he said.</p>
<p>Pope Francis spoke during his livestreamed April 12 Urbi et Orbi blessing, which he offered for the second time in just a month. Typically only given on Christmas and Easter, this year the pope gave the Urbi et Orbi an unprecedented third time on March 27, during a special prayer service for the end of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Those who receive the blessing either in person or through television or social media receive a plenary indulgence, meaning the full pardon of the temporal consequences of sin.</p>
<p>Francis’s blessing was given after celebrating Easter Mass earlier that morning in St. Peter’s Basilica.</p>
<p>Easter at the Vatican is widely known for the vast array of bright, colorful flowers that bedeck the altar on the platform where the pope celebrates Mass in St. Peter’s Square. This year, however, the Mass took place inside the basilica, at the Altar of the Chair, which sits behind the main altar, due to the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>Instead of an explosion of flowers covering the platform in front of the basilica, there were small bouquets placed around the main altar inside, with large arrangements placed around the altar where Francis celebrated Mass.</p>
<p>Due to the coronavirus, the Ressurexit rite was omitted from the Mass. An ancient tradition, the rite takes place at the beginning of Easter Sunday Mass and consists of the pope pausing for a moment of veneration in front of an icon of the Most Holy Savior.</p>
<p>Previously, the image had been kept in a private chapel at the Oratory of Saint Laurence, near the papal basilica of John Lateran, called the Sancta Sanctorum. Papal Easter celebrations used to begin there, with the pontiff kissing the feet of Jesus three times and reciting the chant, Surrexit Dominus de sepulchro, alleluia, Qui pro nobis pependit in ligno, alleluia, meaning, “The Lord is Risen from the tomb, alleluia, Who for us hung on the wood, alleluia.”</p>
<p>Concelebrants at the Mass would then also kiss the icon and offer a sign of peace to the pope. Under John Paul II the rite was incorporated into papal Easter celebrations at St. Peter’s, however, this year it was skipped because of the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>During Mass, Pope Francis did not offer a homily, but sat in silence after the reading of the day’s Gospel reading from John.</p>
<p>In his Urbi et Orbi address, Pope Francis urged Christians everywhere to turn to Jesus in suffering, “that he may heal the wounds of an afflicted humanity.”</p>
<p>He offered prayers for all those directly affected by the coronavirus, above all the deceased and family members who could not say goodbye.</p>
<p>“May the Lord of life welcome the departed into his kingdom and grant comfort and hope to those still suffering, especially the elderly and those who are alone,” he said, and prayed that God would console the vulnerable, especially those living in nursing homes, barracks and prisons.</p>
<p>“For many, this is an Easter of solitude lived amid the sorrow and hardship that the pandemic is causing, from physical suffering to economic difficulties,” he said, and asked God to grant strength and hope to the doctors and nurses who are exhausted and risk their health to serve the sick amid the pandemic. He also prayed for law enforcement and military personnel.</p>
<p>Noting how the coronavirus has changed the lives of millions in a few weeks’ time, sparking fear among many about unemployment and the ability to provide for their families, the pope urged political leaders to “work actively for the common good, to provide the means and resources needed to enable everyone to lead a dignified life and, when circumstances allow, to assist them in resuming their normal daily activities.”</p>
<p>With the whole world impacted by the virus, Pope Francis urged both people and nations not to fall into indifference, but to be attentive to the needs of others, especially “those living on the peripheries,” such as homeless, migrants and refugees.</p>
<p>“May these, the most vulnerable of our brothers and sisters living in the cities and peripheries of every part of the world, not be abandoned. Let us ensure that they do not lack basic necessities,” including access to medicine and healthcare, he said.</p>
<p>Francis also called for the relaxing of international sanctions due to the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus, saying the sanctions “make it difficult for countries on which they have been imposed to provide adequate support to their citizens.”</p>
<p>He also urged the reduction or forgiveness of the debts owed by poor nations, so that they will be in a better position to “meet the greatest needs of the moment.”</p>
<p>“This is not a time for self-centeredness, because the challenge we are facing is shared by all, without distinguishing between persons,” he said, pointing to the wave of solidarity that swept through Europe following the Second World War.</p>
<p>Noting that the European Union now finds itself in the midst of a massive crisis, he said it is more urgent than ever that “these rivalries do not regain force, but that all recognize themselves as part of a single family and support one another.”</p>
<p>In present circumstances, the only alternative to solidarity “is the selfishness of particular interests and the temptation of a return to the past, at the risk of severely damaging the peaceful coexistence and development of future generations,” he said.</p>
<p>He called for an end to division, asking that God give all those who have a hand in global conflicts the courage to call for an immediate ceasefire throughout the world.</p>
<p>“This is not a time for continuing to manufacture and deal in arms, spending vast amounts of money that ought to be used to care for others and save lives,” he said, voicing hope that the pandemic might finally end the ongoing war in Syria and conflicts throughout the Middle East, Africa and Ukraine.</p>
<p>Francis also offered prayers for those suffering a humanitarian crisis in Africa, Greece, Turkey and Venezuela, asking that child migrants and refugees would especially be protected.</p>
<p>“Dear brothers and sisters, indifference, self-centeredness, division and forgetfulness are not words we want to hear at this time. We want to ban these words forever!” he said, adding that these things will prevail as long as Jesus is not welcomed into peoples’ hearts and lives.</p>
<p>He closed praying that Christ, “who has already defeated death and opened for us the way to eternal salvation, dispel the darkness of our suffering humanity and lead us into the light of his glorious day, a day that knows no end.”</p>
