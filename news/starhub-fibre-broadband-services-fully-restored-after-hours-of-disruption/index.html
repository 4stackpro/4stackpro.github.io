SINGAPORE: StarHub users across Singapore reported issues with their Internet service on Wednesday (Apr 15), with frustrated customers taking to social media to complain of an outage.</p>
<p>The disruption began at about 11am, according to posts on Twitter and on StarHub&rsquo;s Facebook page.</p>

<p>Services were &ldquo;fully restored&rdquo; as of 8.20pm, said the telco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will continue to monitor the situation closely to ensure service stability for customers. Thank you for your patience and understanding,&rdquo; it added.</p>
<p>StarHub had said in an earlier statement that the disruption was due to a network issue with one of its Domain Name Servers that handles Internet traffic routing, adding that there was no evidence pointing to a cyber attack.</p>
<p>The disruption came at a time when many people were working from home, as part of enhanced COVID-19 circuit breaker measures. Most workplaces are closed, and schools have moved to full home-based learning.</p>

<p>@StarHub Why was my home broadband service down for a good 20 minutes between 11:00 and 11:25 am today ? I see many users have reported the same issue. I restarted my modem and router. It did not work for 10 minutes after restarting and then suddenly resumed. Provide root cause. pic.twitter.com/vwS61okYa7 — Debashis Ghosh (@Deb_a_Ghosh) April 15, 2020</p>

<p>@StarHub hi starhub! Is your internet down? No one&rsquo;s picking up the hotline - urgent working from home! — rostoss (@rostoss1) April 15, 2020</p>
<p>StarHub first acknowledged the issue at about 12.45pm in a Facebook post, saying that fibre services to some customers in the North and North-East regions were temporarily affected for about 20 minutes due to a network equipment fault.</p>
<p>It added that services resumed progressively after backup equipment immediately took over, and advised customers to reboot their modems and routers to refresh their data connection.</p>
<p>However, users were still reporting outages in the afternoon. More people appeared to have been affected as the day went on, according to user reports on the Down Detector website.</p>
<p>An outage map on the Down Detector website shows problems with the StarHub network on Apr 15, 2020.</p>
<p>StarHub&rsquo;s chief technology officer Chong Siew Loong apologised to customers in a statement on Wednesday night, confirming that the disruption had come about due to a network issue with one of the telco&rsquo;s Domain Name Servers.</p>
<p>The issue affected home broadband services. Enterprise customers were not affected, he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Traffic on our network is well below our available capacity and ample redundancy has been built into our network to cater for high service levels to be delivered consistently,&rdquo; said Mr Chong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We take this incident seriously and will conduct a detailed root cause analysis so that we can prevent future recurrence.&rdquo;

<h3 id="starhub-internet-users-face-connectivity-woes">StarHub Internet users face connectivity woes</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/articles/2020/04/16/ST_20200416_WYSTARHUB_5602758.jpg?itok=XZ5pJRJf" alt="img">
StarHub&rsquo;s Internet service faced intermittent outage issues yesterday, causing disruption to subscribers working and studying at home during a period when connections are crucial amid the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>According to the Down Detector website, which logs Internet outages, StarHub started having problems at around 11am, before complaints spiked at 11.30am and again, at 3.55pm.</p>
<p>StarHub, in confirming the problem on its Facebook page, said fibre broadband services for some customers living in the north and north-east of Singapore were &ldquo;temporarily affected&rdquo; for about 20 minutes in the morning due to &ldquo;a fault in a network equipment&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Its update on Facebook at 3.45pm said it was aware that some broadband customers were still facing connectivity problems.</p>
<p>The telco later said this was due to a separate network issue with one of its domain name servers that handles Internet traffic routing.</p>
<p>StarHub&rsquo;s chief technology officer Chong Siew Loong apologised for the inconvenience and said: &ldquo;We take this incident seriously and will conduct a detailed root-cause analysis so that we can prevent future recurrence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said traffic on the telco&rsquo;s network is &ldquo;well below&rdquo; available capacity, and that &ldquo;ample redundancy&rdquo; has been built into the network to cater for high service levels.</p>
<p>All affected services were fully restored by 8.20pm, said the telco.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) told The Straits Times: &ldquo;IMDA takes a serious view of any service disruption to public telecommunications services, especially during the circuit breaker period, where many of us are working and studying from home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spokesman added: &ldquo;IMDA has commenced investigations into the two service disruptions to StarHub&rsquo;s Internet services&hellip; and will not hesitate to take strong enforcement action should there be any lapses on StarHub&rsquo;s part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CONNECTIVITY IS ESSENTIAL Such connectivity will be the difference between success and failure, particularly for smaller businesses that need to turn to digital means to reach their local and global audiences while home-bound. MR ALPER TURKEN, CommScope&rsquo;s senior vice-president, service provider, Asia-Pacific, on the importance of reliable Internet services.</p>
<p>Thousands of Internet users from Yishun and Ang Mo Kio to Seletar and Kallang took to social media to complain about the outages.</p>
<p>Facebook user Danny Tong wrote on StarHub&rsquo;s page: &ldquo;How to work from home when your &lsquo;equipment&rsquo; and infrastructure failed big time? Still not working after rebooting all my devices equipment several times now. Bishan area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Private investor Stephen Chen, 42, said he realised that something was wrong when he noticed his wife using her phone&rsquo;s mobile data to conduct a Zoom call for work at around 5pm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw that my computer&rsquo;s Internet connection was also down and I couldn&rsquo;t do any trading. I rebooted the router a few times and it still didn&rsquo;t work,&rdquo; said Mr Chen, who lives in Mountbatten.</p>
<p>Mr Alper Turken, CommScope&rsquo;s senior vice-president, service provider, Asia-Pacific, said the Internet is &ldquo;as essential as water and power&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such connectivity will be the difference between success and failure, particularly for smaller businesses that need to turn to digital means to reach their local and global audiences while home-bound.&rdquo;
