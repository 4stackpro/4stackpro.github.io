<p>In case ya haven’t noticed, there’s an absolute STORM going down in the beauty YouTuber community and the internet’s still reeling from the fallout.</p>
<p>Shane Dawson’s post comes at the heels of Jeffree Star’s ex-friend saying felt silenced by the duo after hearing Shane “curse James out” to Jeffree before release of Tati’s vid: &ldquo;I was kind of taken aback…I&rsquo;ve never seen Shane Dawson like that…he was just going in on James.” pic.twitter.com/l7DXttxZmz — Pop Crave (@PopCrave) June 21, 2020</p>
<p>It all started when Shane Dawson yeeted himself out of the beauty world, reopening the James Charles / Tati Westbrook can of worms in the process. Oh, and Jeffree Star is OF COURSE involved in the whole shebang as well.</p>

<h3 id="jessica-mulroneys-ctv-show-was-pulled-after-she-threatened-black-influencer-sasha-exeter">&ldquo;Jessica Mulroney&rsquo;s CTV Show Was Pulled After She Threatened Black Influencer Sasha Exeter&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/sasha-jessica-gettyimages-951203554-1591972363.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">
Jessica Mulroney, who is close friends with Meghan Markle, had her CTV reality show I Do Redo pulled off the air after influencer Sasha Exeter came forward, accusing Mulroney of privately threatening her livelihood and trying to silence her.</p>
<p>In an 11-minute video, Exeter detailed how Mulroney perceived a generic call-to-action post Exeter shared as directed at her, because Mulroney had not posted anything about the Black Lives Matter movement on her Instagram. Exeter said Mulroney lashed out at her over messages and texts and at one point, threatened to talk to her sponsors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, I’m by no means calling Jess a racist but what I will say is this: She is very well aware of her wealth, her perceived power, and privilege because of the color of her skin,&rdquo; Exeter said. For context, Mulroney is married to Ben Mulroney, former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney&rsquo;s son, and is part of Toronto&rsquo;s elite. &ldquo;And that, my friend, gave her the momentary confidence to come for my livelihood in writing,&rdquo; Exeter said. &ldquo;Textbook white privilege really, in my personal opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her video, Exeter gave a full run down of what Mulroney did. Her statement is transcribed below.</p>
<p>Very early on in this, I was very vocal about wanting my peers and folks with an online presence to speak out, stand up, and use their voice for good to help combat what’s going on with this race war and what’s happening to the Black community. I’ve been extremely mindful and cognizant with the way I communicate and my approach, making sure during these post sharing that I was never, not once, calling out anybody directly. Unfortunately though, one very prominent Canadian figure who used to be an acquaintance of mine named Jessica Mulroney took offense to a very generic call to action that I shared on my IG Stories. And what happened next was a series of very problematic behavior and antics that ultimately resulted in her sending me a threat in writing last Wednesday, June the 3rd. Listen, I’m by no means calling Jess a racist but what I will say is this: She is very well aware of her wealth, her perceived power, and privilege because of the color of her skin. And that, my friend, gave her the momentary confidence to come for my livelihood in writing. Textbook white privilege really, in my personal opinion.</p>
<p>So you’re probably wondering how this whole thing started and to be honest the story is kind of convoluted. But there are two main issues here of concern. Number 1: Jessica never wanted to stand up and use her voice in the first place and didn’t understand why she needed to. This I found quite strange seeing that she is very vocal about supporting many causes and very open about everything else. So how could she not be speaking up about this issue that’s affecting everyone in the world? Also, her best friend is arguably one of the most famous Black woman in the world [Meghan Markle]. I just didn’t get it.</p>
<p>Number 2: I believe that she wrongly assumed that my generic call to action on my Instagram Stories was a direct and blatant call out to her. Maybe this is possibly showing her guilt for her lack of action and because of that, she began to lash out at me.</p>
<p>During the span of about a week or so, Jessica basically ticked every single box of what a white woman should absolutely not do during the biggest racial uproar in history, citing that this wasn’t really a problem that she wanted to share on her social channels, excuses that she would be bullied or vilified by the public media if she did so. Claimed her show was more important to promote because it was going into, I believe, the season finale, and because after all, this is her job, and get this, &ldquo;they matter too.&rdquo; She tried to use my one piece of sponsored content as her get out of jail free card because I think she felt that put us on the same playing field after she spent the first entire week of this crisis promoting her TV show with like, no mention of show of support or solidarity, like at all.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t enough. She made herself the victim, of course, me the villain. A story mysteriously popped up in the Daily Mail UK, a British tabloid, last Tuesday which could be June the 2nd. I was blocked from her Instagram account that same day and a trail of offensive messages to me that ended in her saying and I quote, &ldquo;I have also spoken to companies and people about the way you’ve treated me unfairly. You think your voice matters. Well, it only matters if you express it without shaming people who are simply trying to learn. Good luck.&rdquo; Now, I’m still shaking my head at this attempt and the audacity she had. Now, not only is Jessica very well aware of her white privilege but just like her fellow Canadian Amy Cooper, she spewed out that threat so effortlessly. But I think what makes this situation really horrendous is the threat or the claim that she was going ahead and speaking to brands and companies that I potentially have worked with, or are currently working with or could possibly work with.</p>
<p>And that’s a threat. That’s a threat to my livelihood. And for her to threaten me, a single mom, a single Black mom, during a racial pandemic blows my mind. It’s absolutely unbelievable. My impression, I think Jess realized that she screwed up big time, knowing that everything she said to me and the threat was done in writing and that I have the receipts and that resulted in a lot of back pedaling, excuse after excuse, through text messages for her behavior. Reaching out to my Black peers and friends, to prove her allyship through her association to them. I don’t get it. How can you be about the Black people and be a supporter and about female empowerment on the outside when you’re attempting to silence a Black woman during this movement behind closed doors? It just seems very contradictory to me.</p>
<p>Amidst all this craziness, I remained paralyzed. Actually paralyzed in fear. That is part of the reason I was very silent on my feed for five or six days, to be honest. I stayed up days, nights, wondering what could she be saying to my existing brand partners or people that I’m trying to work with? Like my potential work, my potential livelihood, what could this mean for my career?</p>
<p>I spoke to my parents about the situation, and they were legitimately stressed and worried. Worried about the ramifications and how this would affect me if I actually stood up for myself. I was literally—not was, up until last night, I was sick to my stomach, feeling like I was being fraudulent in some way, standing up for this cause and for my people on the forefront publicly but behind closed doors, allowing this woman to like, silence me.</p>
<p>Years of systemic racism and what I now understand as trained thinking actually made me believe there would be more harm done than good if I stood up for myself and said something. And you know what? Thinking that and realizing that made me really, really sad. I am raising a Black daughter. I don’t want her to ever have to face any of this or to experience what I’ve experienced, especially in the last two weeks. And I am fully aware that by sharing this in this way that I am opening myself up to potential criticism, hate, bullying, but I’m willing to take that risk today. And I’ve thought really long and hard about making sure to incorporate some takeaways, and add in here before signing off and you know what? There’s not going to be a long list of takeaways. There’s only one takeaway. This shit needs to stop right now. The goal here is genuine transformative change, not optical and performative bullshit. You cannot be posting that you stand in solidarity while attempting to silence somebody via text. I’ll be damned if the next generation of Black women have to go through this. If we’re going to hold businesses accountable, we should be holding individuals accountable as well. Because enough is enough. I’m openly sharing this story with you guys, really in hopes to give other women the confidence to stand up for themselves too. Thanks for listening.</p>

<p>Mulroney commented on the post, publicly apologizing and seemingly referencing her experience with Meghan in her response, according to Vanity Fair. The comment appears to have since been deleted.</p>
<p>@sashaexeterr, you are right when you say “this shit needs to stop”. As leaders, we need to join hands and call out wrongs. I know we have different experiences. And that is something that, even in the course of a heated argument, I need to acknowledge and understand. I am unequivocally sorry for not doing that with you, and for any hurt I caused. As I told you privately, I have lived a very public and personal experience with my closest friend where race was front and centre. It was deeply educational. I learned a lot from that. I promise to continue to learn and listen on how I can use my privilege to elevate and support black voices.</p>
<p>In private, Exeter revealed on her Instagram Stories, Mulroney threatened to sue her. &ldquo;Here is what happens when you call out somebody with privilege and with wealth, okay? They publicly make an apology or a statement and privately behind closed doors, they send you a threat of filing a lawsuit against you,&rdquo; Exeter said. &ldquo;I’m not quite sure what’s going on because I thought I was very clear yesterday in my video that I’m not going to be silenced and I’m not going to shut up. I’m going to move forward and do what I need to do essentially to protect myself at this point. But I’m feeling confident in doing so, knowing that I have the truth, the unequivocal truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Exeter then shared a screenshot of Mulroney&rsquo;s DM to her. &ldquo;After her public apology on my post yesterday, I received this via DM. Please take in the timestamp in green on the top left of the screen. Also, poor thing didn&rsquo;t even spell &lsquo;libel&rsquo; correctly. Sigh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instagram</p>
<p>&ldquo;I honestly don’t know what’s worse here: Her losing her perceived power to try and threaten my livelihood or using her resources to basically shut me up,&rdquo; Exeter continued on an Instagram Story video. &ldquo;But whatever the case is, it needs to stop. I’m going to take a little break from social media. I somehow still have to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Exeter posted her videos and they circulated, CTV released a statement on its Twitter. &ldquo;Bell Media and CTV encourages our entire team including our on-air talent to practice respect, inclusivity, and allyship as we pledge to work better and more openly to listen to and amplify Black voices, and not to minimize them,&rdquo; the network wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because recent conduct by one of our shows hosts, Jessica Mulroney conflicts with our commitment to diversity and equality, CTV has removed I Do Redo from all Bell Media channels and platforms effective immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This content is imported from Twitter. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.</p>
<p>Mulroney posted a statement to her own Twitter, saying she respected the network&rsquo;s decision. She wrote:</p>
<p>The events that have transpired over the last few days have made it clear that I have work to do. I realize more than ever how being a white, privileged woman has put me far ahead of so many, and in particular those in the Black community.</p>
<p>I respect the decision of CTV and have decided to step away from professional engagements at this time. I&rsquo;m going to take this time to reflect, learn, and focus on my family.</p>
<p>I also want to take a moment and clarify that I have no intentions of pursuing any legal action. I was wrong and for that, I am truly sorry. I remain more committed than ever to support anti-racism efforts and will do everything in my power to right this wrong.</p>

<h3 id="spore-influencer-denies-business-owners-allegations-of-using-fake-followers-to-reap-freebies">&ldquo;S&rsquo;pore influencer denies business owner&rsquo;s allegations of using fake followers to reap freebies&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.mothership.sg/1/2020/06/Influencer-drama.jpg" alt="img">
A local influencer has responded to allegations by a business owner of procuring &ldquo;fake&rdquo; followers and likes to &ldquo;request for free food in the name of Covid-19&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Venie Lin, the co-founder of fresh and frozen food supplier &ldquo;Frozendozen&rdquo;, took to Facebook to share her experience with a &ldquo;dubious influencer&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Lin claims that the influencer been approaching local small businesses to &ldquo;reap freebies&rdquo; with &ldquo;fake&rdquo; likes and followers.</p>
<p>Influencer approached business owner for three-month sponsorship</p>
<p>According to Lin, Instagram influencer Xue Wei of @anaffairwithfood (AAWF) had first sought a collaboration with her as she had claimed to want to &ldquo;support local businesses&rdquo; during the Covid-19 pandemic:</p>
<p>After discussions between the two parties, exchange terms for a collaboration were agreed upon.</p>
<p>Xue Wei had allegedly asked for S$300 worth of sponsored food items over three months, but refused to sign an exclusive contract with Lin&rsquo;s company.</p>
<p>This was apparently because there was no payout from Lin&rsquo;s company.</p>
<p>Lin told Mothership that she empathised with Xue Wei&rsquo;s plight, but had to reduce the three month sponsorship to one month because her company could not approve the three-month collaboration without a signed contract.</p>
<p>Business owner noticed discrepancies in influencer&rsquo;s Instagram posts, hired third party to do background check</p>
<p>After proceeding with the collaboration, Lin claimed to have noticed some discrepancies in AAWF&rsquo;s Instagram posts.</p>
<p>According to Lin, AAWF&rsquo;s &lsquo;like&rsquo; count had dropped drastically from around 300+ to below 100 in the same week, hovering at around 50 to 90 likes based on her recent uploads.</p>
<p>She had found this strange as AAWF had a follower count of more than 22,000.</p>
<p>After looking at these &ldquo;alarming figures&rdquo;, Lin grew concerned about AAWF&rsquo;s engagement rate on the platform and got her management to engage a third party agent to do a background check on AAWF&rsquo;s profile.</p>
<p>According to Lin, AAWF had an engagement rate of 0.95 per cent on her Instagram posts, and witnessed a spike in follower count between January 20 to March 20, 2020:</p>
<p>After doing a manual check on AAWF&rsquo;s account, Lin claimed that all her &ldquo;advertising&rdquo; posts had zero comments, save for one or two comments from bots.</p>
<p>Lin also claimed that many of AAWF&rsquo;s followers were bots.</p>
<p>Lin then approached Xue Wei with her findings, and requested a refund on the products that were sent to her.</p>
<p>According to Lin, this was because AAWF&rsquo;s followers and likes were &ldquo;evidently fake&rdquo;:</p>
<p>However, Lin claimed that Xue Wei replied by insisting that &ldquo;she is not fake&rdquo;, refused to refund her, and even threatened to take legal action against her:</p>
<p>She apparently even accused Lin of &ldquo;coercion and intimidation&rdquo;:</p>
<p>Eventually, Lin gave up on the S$93 refund.</p>
<p>Other business owners come forward with their own stories</p>
<p>Following this, Lin shared Instagram screenshots of messages she had received from other business owners who had negative experiences with Xue Wei:</p>
<p>An Affair with Food responds to allegations</p>
<p>In response to these allegations, Xue Wei put up a series of Instagram stories on AAWF, explaining her side of the story.</p>
<p>Xue Wei said that she did not sign the three month contract with Frozendozen because she only signs off on paid engagements.</p>
<p>According to Xue Wei, Lin was agreeable to this and proceeded with their collaboration:</p>
<p>According to Xue Wei, Lin should have advised her management against the collaboration if she was concerned about AAWF&rsquo;s engagement rate.</p>
<p>She added that AAWF&rsquo;s statistics have always been available on SocialBlade for public viewing, and that she is keen to share their statistics with anyone who wants to view it.</p>
<p>Xue Wei also attributed any increase in AAWF&rsquo;s growth and engagement to various sources such as articles on their website to the hosting of giveaways:</p>
<p>And said that she had considered legal consult as Lin&rsquo;s statement in her email &ldquo;had come with a threatening intent&rdquo;:</p>
<p>Xue Wei then stated that AAWF had never presented false or misleading statistics and information to businesses, and defended herself against accusations that she had been &ldquo;demanding&rdquo; in collaborations:</p>
<p>Finally, Xue Wei clarified that AAWF&rsquo;s Instagram posts &ldquo;do not immediately draw a large traction since (they) have a small following&rdquo; and that their post engagement will &ldquo;take time&rdquo; to reach their audience:</p>
<p>She went on to end her series of explanations by saying that businesses have the right to decline working with influencers if they do not think that they will be able to achieve their &ldquo;expected reach or performance&rdquo;:</p>
<p>Welp.</p>

<h3 id="spore-influencer-publicises-entitled-domestic-helpers-antics-receives-open-letter-about-being-gracious">&ldquo;S&rsquo;pore influencer publicises &lsquo;entitled&rsquo; domestic helper&rsquo;s antics, receives open letter about being gracious&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.mothership.sg/1/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-17-at-5.12.50-PM-1.png" alt="img">
Another storm is brewing in the influencer community.</p>
<p>This comes after Jessica Loh (@shiberty) posted to Instagram about the issues she was facing with her domestic helper on June 13, 2020.</p>
<p>Some may know Loh for her previous F&amp;B venture, Shiberty Bakes.</p>
<p>According to Loh, her foreign domestic helper had helped herself to the seafood bee hoon that Loh had cooked for her friend&rsquo;s birthday, among other things.</p>
<p>Going by Loh&rsquo;s Instagram Stories, it was not the first time that her helper overstepped boundaries in the house.</p>
<p>Subsequently, a non-profit organisation/ advocacy group addressed Loh in an &ldquo;open letter&rdquo;, thus setting off much discussion (to put in mildly) on the social media platform.</p>
<p>Eating the bee hoon for dinner</p>
<p>According to Loh, this was a message that the helper had sent her the morning after the incident.</p>
<p>The helper said that Loh had &ldquo;gone too (sic) far&rdquo; this time.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the message, Loh was so riled up that she posted it to her Instagram Stories.</p>
<p>The influencer explained that she was originally irritated that the helper had not asked for permission before eating the bee hoon, but was prepared to let the incident go.</p>
<p>The WhatsApp message, however, revived her exasperation.</p>
<p>Loh also alleged that the helper had lied about having no dinner until 9pm, when she could easily have fried rice at 7pm after cooking it for Loh&rsquo;s nephew.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Loh adds, she would even have offered her helper the seafood if the latter had asked for permission nicely.</p>
<p>According to Loh, she had done so on a previous occasion when she cooked the same dish.</p>
<p>Later, on the helper threatened to leave the household, and complained about Loh checking her belongings.</p>
<p>Loh said she wanted to make sure that the helper had not swiped anything from the household, as she allegedly had a history of doing so.</p>
<p>Open letter</p>
<p>On June 15, local advocacy group Maid For More dedicated an &ldquo;open letter&rdquo; to Loh regarding the incident.</p>
<p>The organisation said that they were writing &ldquo;in good faith,&rdquo; and did not intend to call Loh out.</p>
<p>They then gave examples of their items being mishandled and misplaced by their own helpers, and spoke about the alienation that helpers experience when handling things that they cannot afford.</p>
<p>They also urged Loh to approach her situation with grace and dignity.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the full letter:</p>
<p>Loh disagreed with the organisation&rsquo;s position, and questioned their intent of making it public.</p>
<p>Blogging pioneer Xiaxue, who is also a friend of Loh&rsquo;s, rebuked Maid For More&rsquo;s post in a comment:</p>
<p>“We too have similar experience where items are handled without our consent” - then you proceed to list examples where helpers did not steal but instead misplaced stuff. ARE YOU JOKING OR WHAT? 🤡 theft is theft, it is NOT misplacement. HOW IS YOUR SITUATION SIMILAR? And in what universe are employers supposed to accept that their employees, because they feel alienated and demoralised, are allowed to use their personal items? So I can go to Jamie Chua’s house and wear her expensive bras and use her Birkins is it?! Coz rich pple also make me feel demoralized? Jeez the amount of self righteousness and condescension in this post is palpable. If you are so kind, then take in this helper, let her steal ur stuff and wear your clothes yeah? Don’t talk so much use your actions. Remember to ask her what’s her fav food after you catch her.&rdquo; '</p>
<p>Loh, however, responded to the Maid For More in her own Instagram Stories:</p>
<p>She emphasised that the helper was not mistreated in any way, and in fact, receives clothes, skincare, and make up from Loh, on top of unlimited access to wifi and a relatively light workload.</p>
<p>Loh also shared a conversation with her previous helper, whom she was on good terms with.</p>
<p>Personal messages</p>
<p>Later on, Maid For More reached out to Loh through personal messages, which sparked another dispute.</p>
<p>That was long.</p>

<h3 id="ben-mulroney-leaves-hosting-job-amid-wife-jessicas-race-drama">&ldquo;Ben Mulroney leaves hosting job amid wife Jessica&rsquo;s race drama&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/06/22/18/29922632-0-image-a-78_1592846725264.jpg" alt="img">
Ben Mulroney has announced that he is stepping down from his CTV entertainment show &lsquo;etalk&rsquo; amid his wife Jessica Mulroney&rsquo;s headline-grabbing race row with a former colleague.</p>
<p>On Canada’s Your Morning today, the 44-year-old TV host and son of former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said that he would be &lsquo;immediately&rsquo; leaving the show he&rsquo;d been on for 18 years.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is my hope that that new anchor is Black, Indigenous or a person of color, and they can use this important platform to inspire, to lead and to make change,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Out of a job: Ben Mulroney has announced that he is stepping down from his CTV entertainment show &lsquo;etalk,&rsquo; effective immediately</p>
<p>Public drama: The announcement was made amid his wife Jessica Mulroney&rsquo;s headline-grabbing race row with a former colleague</p>
<p>Ben&rsquo;s leaving the show is the latest career change for the couple since Sasha Exeter accused Jessica, 40, of wielding her &lsquo;white privilege&rsquo; and threatening to sue her following their private war of words over racism.</p>
<p>Jessica has already lost several jobs in the fallout, and now it seems Ben, too, is out of a job.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want to take a moment to speak to you about the situation surrounding my wife Jessica, and the next steps I will be taking with Bell Media, he said in his announcement this morning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I love my wife. However, it is not my place to speak for her. And today, together, we are committed to doing the work to both learn and understand more about anti-Black racism as well as learn and understand more about our blind spots. So, what does this mean for me?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Together, we are committed to doing the work to both learn and understand more about anti-Black racism as well as learn and understand more about our blind spots,&rsquo; he said</p>
<p>Still working; He added that he will still host red carpet events and other special projects, and will also still cohost the show Your Morning</p>
<p>New host: He said that he hopes is replacement is Black, Indigenous, or a person of color</p>
<p>Leaving: Ben, pictured with his wife and Meghan Markle in 2016, said he&rsquo;s &lsquo;so proud of everyone involved with etalk and CTV&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it means acknowledging here today that my privilege has benefitted me greatly,&rsquo; he went on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And while I have certainly worked hard to build my career, I know that systemic racism and injustice helps people like me and harms those who aren’t like me, often in ways that are invisible to us. This needs to change.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that is why I have decided to immediately step away from my role as an anchor at etalk to create a space for a new perspective and a new voice,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>He went on to call for &lsquo;more Black voices, more Indigenous voices, more people of color in the media as well as every other profession.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am so proud of everyone involved with etalk and CTV, and I know they will continue to demonstrate the excellence that has made that show and this network No. 1,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>He added that he will still host red carpet events and other special projects, and will also still cohost the show Your Morning.</p>
<p>Kiddos: The couple shares nine-year-old twin boys John and Brian and seven-year-old daughter Ivy</p>
<p>Couple: &lsquo;I love my wife. However, it is not my place to speak for her,&rsquo; he said in the announcement</p>
<p>Ben&rsquo;s decision comes just days after Jessica stepped down from the board of directors of The Shoebox Project, a charity she had founded with her sisters-in-law.</p>
<p>The charity, which collects and distributes gifts in the form of shoeboxes to at-risk women in shelters, was founded by Jessica in collaboration with Ben&rsquo;s high-profile sisters Caroline, Vanessa, and Katy Mulroney.</p>
<p>In a statement shared on Instagram, the charity said: &lsquo;Jessica Mulroney is a founding member of The Shoebox Project and she has dedicated herself to its growth and success over the years, for which we are very grateful.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In light of recent events, the charity supports Jessica’s decision to step away from the Board of Directors.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The charity also vowed to do better to support BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) women moving forward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To our valued supporters and volunteers, we believe in a world where women feel seen, and are treated with compassion, dignity, and respect,&rsquo; the statement continued.</p>
<p>Done: Last week, Jessica (second from left) stepped down from The Shoebox Project, the charity she founded with her sisters-in-law Vanessa, Caroline, and Katy Mulroney (left to right)</p>
<p>Troubles: Jessica is no longer on the board of directors following her race row with Sasha Exeter, a scandal that has allegedly ended her friendship with Meghan Markle</p>
<p>&lsquo;As an organization, we are deeply committed to do better for Black and Indigenous women who have been systematically oppressed in Canada and around the world.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is not an issue that will be solved overnight. We pledge to make race an ongoing conversation that occurs regularly and at every level of our organization.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jessica&rsquo;s husband Ben and his three sisters are all prominent figures as the children of former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.</p>
<p>Caroline is the current Ontario Minister of Transportation and Minister of Francophone Affairs. Her husband is financier Andrew Lapham, the son of former Harper’s Bazaar editor Lewis Lapham.</p>
<p>Vanessa runs her own fashion branding agency, Power of Prive, after previously working as an editor at Condé Nast, and Katy is a financial analyst.</p>
<p>Announcement: The Shoebox Project released a statement on Instagram saying they support her decision to step away</p>
<p>Plans: The charity also vowed to do better to support BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) women moving forward.</p>
<p>Over the past week and a half, Jessica&rsquo;s &lsquo;white privilege&rsquo; scandal has cost her business deals, partnerships, TV shows, and even — reportedly — her friendship with Meghan.</p>
<p>The Duchess of Sussex is said to have permanently cut ties with Jessica after she became embroiled in a race row with an influencer, sources have claimed.</p>
<p>Meghan, 38, first met Jessica while she was filming legal drama Suits in Toronto, and the stylist went on to attend her wedding to Prince Harry in 2018 — however, the royal has now reportedly ended their friendship &lsquo;for good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>DailyMail.com exclusively revealed last week that Meghan had been left &lsquo;absolutely mortified&rsquo; by Jessica&rsquo;s &lsquo;tone-deaf&rsquo; threats to Sasha, and told close friends that she can &lsquo;no longer be associated with her&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Meghan is absolutely mortified that she&rsquo;s been dragged into this complete mess. She said Jessica is in no way a racist, but the way she handled the situation (with the fashion influencer) was tone-deaf and heartbreaking,&rsquo; a close friend of Meghan&rsquo;s said.</p>
<p>Throwback: The charity collects and distributes gifts to at-risk women in shelters. Jessica is pictured promoting The Shoebox Project with husband Ben in 2018</p>
<p>Important family: Jessica&rsquo;s husband Ben and his three sisters are all prominent figures as the children of former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney</p>
<p>&lsquo;Meghan said friends reflect friends and because of what&rsquo;s at stake she can no longer be associated with Jessica, at least not in public. She has to do what she has to do in order to preserve her dignity and her own reputation,&rsquo; they added.</p>
<p>The source added that they &lsquo;wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised&rsquo; if this marked the &lsquo;beginning of the end of their friendship&rsquo;.</p>
<p>They also said that Meghan cannot publicly defend Jessica in this case or help salvage her career.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s not like Meghan can just call up ABC and defend Jessica,&rsquo; the source said. &lsquo;There was a reason Meghan waited to so long to make a statement. She wanted to get it right. She said she urged Jessica to do the same thing from the get-go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Earlier, an insider told Page Six that the duo&rsquo;s relationship was already on the rocks because Meghan felt that Jessica was trying to &lsquo;make a career out of the friendship.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The white privilege row has really given Meghan the excuse she was waiting for to cut Jess off for good,&rsquo; the source said. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what the tipping point was, but Jess has been on the outs for some time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Their friendship is definitely not what it was. And really, how can you have such a close friendship when one person is basically making a career out of the friendship?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Representatives for Jessica and Meghan have been contacted for comment.</p>
<p>Old friends: Meghan (seen with Prince Harry in March) first met Jessica while filming Suits in Toronto, and the stylist went on to attend her wedding to Harry in 2018</p>
<p>Scandal: Last week, influencer Sasha Exeter shared a series of unpleasant messages in which Jessica allegedly threatened to sue her</p>
<p>How Jessica Mulroney&rsquo;s career has progressed since the royal wedding Canadian stylist Jessica Mulroney&rsquo;s career has gone from strength to strength since she attended Meghan Markle&rsquo;s wedding to Prince Harry in May 2018. The mother-of-three, whose children were page boys and flower girl at the Duchess of Sussex&rsquo;s nuptials, has since won an array of high-profile TV contracts. Jessica, 40, who is married to Canadian television host Ben Mulroney, son of former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, announced her new wedding reality show with CTV last year. Her reality show, I Do, Redo, premiered on CTV at the end of March and was also released internationally on Netflix. The series followed Jessica as she helped couples move on from their disastrous weddings by giving them the nuptials they&rsquo;ve &lsquo;always dreamed of.&rsquo; Jessica has been a regular face presenting a fashion segment for ABC&rsquo;s Good Morning America since last year. She also became the spokesperson for The Bay&rsquo;s bridal brand, which launched in fall 2018. However, Jessica&rsquo;s reality TV show has been canceled and she was fired as a bridal marketing specialist last week amid the race row. ABC has also cut ties with Jessica in her occasional role as a fashion contributor on Good Morning America. The Bay released a statement last Thursday, confirming that Jessica would no longer be the face of Kleinfeld Canada. Jessica, who attended Meghan&rsquo;s baby shower in New York in 2019, was last seen visiting Windsor following the birth of Archie last May. Though plenty of reports followed claims over her role in Harry and Meghan&rsquo;s move to Canada earlier this year, the pair have not been spotted together. Jessica has been careful not to speak out about Meghan too extensively in public, saying last March: &lsquo;Listen, every person has to have a bit of privacy in their life. &lsquo;There are certain things I hold very dear and secret. There are things I&rsquo;ll never talk about for sure. My life is an open book, but there&rsquo;s always a few secret pages in the back that nobody will be able to read.&rsquo; But in a rare moment she previously appeared to hit out at the media in August, defending Meghan. Jessica took to Instagram at the time to say the Duchess of Sussex had been unfairly criticized and suggested that race was a factor. &lsquo;When someone faces unfair criticism, you call it out. When that person is your friend and your family, you call those critics what they truly are. Shame on you, you racist bullies,&rsquo; Jessica wrote. She added: &lsquo;Three years of undeserved hate and abuse. It&rsquo;s enough.&rsquo; Jessica had earlier shared a tweet by British actress Jameela Jamil that accused people of bullying Meghan because of her race. Last month, Jessica revealed she was taking a social media break because &lsquo;someone dear to her&rsquo; told her being silent amid racism is not enough. Advertisement</p>
<p>This comes after Jessica had her reality TV show canceled and was fired as a bridal marketing specialist after &lsquo;threatening&rsquo; a Black social media influencer in a row over white privilege.</p>
<p>Jessica admitted last week that &lsquo;I was wrong&rsquo; after clashing with the lifestyle blogger amid the George Floyd protests.</p>
<p>Sasha said Jessica &lsquo;took offense to a generic call to action&rsquo; that she posted on her Instagram Story weeks ago and that the pair then started arguing.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear if the entire dispute happened over Instagram and what specifically was said but, eventually, it resulted in Jessica allegedly threatening Sasha that she would contact companies she had worked with.</p>
<p>Jessica apologized publicly on one of Sasha&rsquo;s Instagram post after she went public with their dispute, but Sasha claims she then sent her another private message which read: &lsquo;Liable suit. Good luck.&rsquo; [sic]</p>
<p>Since then, Jessica, who grew up in a wealthy Jewish family in Canada — has been fired from CTV, which aired the wedding show I Do, Red.</p>
<p>Story: Sasha said Jessica &lsquo;took offense to a generic call to action&rsquo; that she posted on her Instagram Story weeks ago and that the pair then started arguing</p>
<p>&lsquo;Recent conduct by one of our shows&rsquo; hosts, Jessica Mulroney, conflicts with our commitment to diversity and equality,&rsquo; the network said in a statement.</p>
<p>Jessica took to Instagram to publicly apologize and say that she took something &lsquo;personally&rsquo; that she shouldn&rsquo;t have.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not intend in any way to jeopardize her livelihood. We had a disagreement and it got out of hand. For that I am sorry,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;The events that have transpired over the last few days have made it clear that I have work to do.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I realize more than ever how being a white, privileged woman has put me far ahead of so many, and in particular those in the Black community. And while I can&rsquo;t change the past, I can do my part to do better in the future.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I respect the decision of CTV and have decided to step away from my professional engagements at this time. I&rsquo;m going to take this time to reflect, learn and focus on my family.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I also want to take a moment to clarify that I have no intention of pursuing any legal action. I was wrong, and for that I am truly sorry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I remain more committed than ever to support anti-racism efforts and will do everything in my power to right this wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jessica&rsquo;s friend and fellow TV presenter Tracy Moore, who is Black, said Jessica had &lsquo;used her extreme privilege to potentially bury a Black sister.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Response: After Sasha went public with the dispute, Jessica posted this comment publicly on her page</p>
<p>Say what? However, Sasha said she received this message from Jessica following her public apology</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am a friend. I am also a Black woman. The emotional labour often falls on our backs to speak up, push through and fight hard,&rsquo; Tracy said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s unlearn lashing out at Black women as a legitimate response to feeling called out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The cancelation of Jessica&rsquo;s show was confirmed in a tweet by CTV last Thursday evening that said the recent actions of the I Do, Redo host had conflicted with their &lsquo;commitment to diversity and equality.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bell Media and CTV encourages our entire team including on-air talent to practice respect, inclusivity and allyship as we pledge to work better and more openly to listen to and amplify Black voices, and not minimize them,&rsquo; the statement began.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because recent conduct by one of our shows hosts, Jessica Mulroney, conflicts with our commitment to diversity and equality, CTV has removed &lsquo;I DO REDO&rsquo; from all Bell Media channels and platforms effective immediately.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hours later, Canadian department store Hudson&rsquo;s Bay announced on Instagram that &lsquo;in light of recent events&rsquo; they too would be distancing themselves from Jessica and would no longer have her serve as the brand&rsquo;s fashion and bridal specialist.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Over the past week Hudson&rsquo;s Bay has committed to doing better,&rsquo; the statement read. &lsquo;As we move forward, our leadership associates and ambassadors must reflect our brand inclusivity, equality and respect for all. We will not tolerate anything less.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Done: CTV and Hudson&rsquo;s Bay both dropped Jessica amid the &lsquo;white privilege&rsquo; scandal</p>
<p>Sasha, who is based in Toronto, posted her emotional video last week, saying Jessica had threatened her during an argument &lsquo;speaking up&rsquo; against racism.</p>
<p>She explained that Jessica had taken offense to a call to action she posted online, causing them to argue about the topics of white privilege and racism but she never shared the full exchange.</p>
<p>Claims: Hours after posting her initial video about her argument with Jessica, Sasha alleged to have been sent further messages &lsquo;threatening a law suit to try and shut you up&rsquo;</p>
<p>The influencer said the exchange resulted in Jessica saying: &lsquo;I have also spoken to companies and people about the way you have treated me unfairly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You think your voice matters. Well it only matters if you express it with kindness and without shaming people who are simply trying to learn. Good luck.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sasha said the exchanges left her fearing for her livelihood as she wondered what Jessica was saying to her brand partners or potential brands she might want to work with.</p>
<p>Sharing the video with her 58,000 followers, she explained: &lsquo;Very early on in this, I was very vocal about wanting my peers with an online presence to speak up, stand up and use their voice for good to help combat what&rsquo;s going on with this race war.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m by no means calling Jess a racist, but she is very well aware of her wealth, her perceived power and privilege because of the color of her skin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that my friends, gave her the momentary confidence to come for my livelihood in writing. Textbook white privilege really.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The influencer accused Jessica of &lsquo;never wanting to stand up and use her voice in the first place&rsquo; and &lsquo;not understanding why she needed to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Final plea: Jessica asked her followers to continued to hold her &lsquo;accountable&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sasha suggested that Jessica felt &lsquo;sharing that this really wasn&rsquo;t a problem that she wanted to share on her social channels,&rsquo; used &lsquo;excuses that she would be bullied by the public and media,&rsquo; and &lsquo;claimed her show was more important to promote.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Revealing the &lsquo;threatening&rsquo; message, Sasha said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m still shaking my head at this attempt and the audacity she had.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not only is Mulroney very well aware of her white privilege but just like her fellow Canadian Amy Cooper, she spewed out that threat so effortlessly,&rsquo; she said. Cooper was the woman who called police on a Black birdwatcher in Central Park in a video which was widely shared last month.</p>
<p>Sasha continued: &lsquo;But I think what makes this situation really horrendous is the threat or claim she was going ahead to speak to brands or companies that I potentially haven&rsquo;t worked with or could possibly work with. That is a threat. That&rsquo;s a threat to my livelihood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For her to threaten me? A single mother, a single Black mother, during a racial pandemic? Blows my mind, it is absolutely unbelievable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Canceled: Jessica&rsquo;s reality show, I Do, Redo (pictured), premiered on CTV at the end of March and was also released internationally on Netflix</p>
<p>Sasha continued to say that she felt Jessica &lsquo;realized she had screwed up big time&rsquo; and &lsquo;that resulted in a lot of back pedaling.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Amidst all this craziness, I remained paralyzed with fear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I stayed up days and nights wondering what could she be saying to my existing brand partners, potential work, potential livelihood. What could this mean for my career?</p>
<p>&lsquo;I spoke to my parents, who were legitimately stressed and worried about how this would affect me if I stood up for myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sasha said that the &lsquo;only take away is this sh** needs to stop right now&hellip;You cannot be posting that you stand in solidarity, while attempting to silence somebody via text.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a comment posted on the video clip, Jessica said she was &lsquo;unequivocally sorry,&rsquo; adding that being Meghan&rsquo;s &lsquo;closest friend&rsquo; has &lsquo;deeply educated&rsquo; her about race.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As I told you privately, I have lived a very public and personal experience with my closest friend where race was front and centre. It was deeply educational,&rsquo; Jessica responded.</p>
<p>She posted another apology to Sasha, this time on her own Instagram page, insisting the former athlete had &lsquo;rightfully called me out for not doing enough when it came to engaging in the important and difficult conversation around race and injustice in our society.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I took it personally and that was wrong. I know I need to do better,&rsquo; she continued. &lsquo;I want to say from my heart that every more of my apologies to Sasha over the course of the last two weeks privately, and again both publicly and privately today is true.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not intend in any way to jeopardize her livelihood &hellip; for that I am sorry,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>Previously, Jessica said she was taking a break from social media, after revealing that &lsquo;someone dear to her told her to stand up to racism.&rsquo;</p>

As protests over the killing of George Floyd in police custody erupted in nearly every major US city, the online response to Floyd&rsquo;s death included influencers promoting bail funds, petitions, and more.</p>
<p>Across different influencer niches, including YouTubers and TikTokers, celebrities, and lifestyle accounts, fans urged influencers to either promote Black Lives Matter or stop posting.</p>
<p>When influencers posted self-promotion or &ldquo;off-topic&rdquo; posts before making statements, the backlash was swift. When influencers posted statements that weren&rsquo;t deemed sufficient, many apologized.</p>
<p>Visit Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>On Instagram, every imaginable niche has its own influencers. Now, as protests over the killing of George Floyd roil the US, followers are demanding that influencers of all stripes with large platforms acknowledge the political climate. That includes people who like to shop at the grocery chain Trader Joe&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Natasha Fischer has built up an audience of more than 1.1 million followers for &ldquo;@traderjoeslist&rdquo; by shopping at Trader Joe&rsquo;s, taking pictures of items there, and posting about them on Instagram. This weekend, Fischer received &ldquo;thousands of comments&rdquo; from her angry fanbase over her treatment of the protests on her account.</p>
<p>First, she was criticized for failing to post anything supporting Black Lives Matter. Fischer then posted &ldquo;links directing individuals to resources if they wanted to learn more or make an impact.&rdquo; She tagged the post &ldquo;#AllLivesMatter,&rdquo; a common rebuke to &ldquo;Black Lives Matter&rdquo; which usually comes from a misunderstanding of the goals of the movement or an effort to delegitimize it. This resulted in an even bigger backlash.</p>
<p>As Fischer went on to write in her apology, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take back my ignorant hashtag but I can learn from it and do better. I hope this is heard and that it&rsquo;s understood that I made a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The comments on Fischer&rsquo;s apology post are still divided, and the ideological clash over a Trader Joe&rsquo;s hobbyist&rsquo;s account represents an all-encompassing shift in the influencer sphere. The protests over Floyd&rsquo;s killing and the institutional racism in the criminal justice system have come dominate public discussions nearly everywhere in the US, and fans are demanding participation in the movement from influencers like never before.</p>
<p>Unlike in past protests that gained national attention and spurred responses from influencers and celebrities, activists and protesters involved in the Floyd demonstrations are aggressively calling out inaction in digital spaces, and demanding that those with large platforms use them to boost their cause, regardless of what they normally talk about. People who have stayed silent or made missteps have quickly faced backlash severe enough to prompt public apologies.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s representative of both the explosive current moment and evolving stances on celebrity worship and online conduct. Now, having a platform, even a relatively small one compared to A-list celebrities and influencers, carries an expectation. Fans are in control of their favorite influencer&rsquo;s destiny, and the message is clear: Use your platform to support Black Lives Matter, and do so quickly and meaningfully, or lose followers.</p>
<p>YouTubers, TikTokers, and teen celebrities appear to bear the brunt of these new expectations, especially given their young, diverse, and highly-engaged audiences.</p>
<p>The day before Floyd&rsquo;s killing, YouTuber Tana Mongeau launched an OnlyFans account to sell nude and lewd content to her fanbase. Mongeau, who has 5.4 million Instagram followers, is not usually a very political person. Her brand is being a messy high school dropout whose explicit antics entertain predominantly teenage girls.</p>
<p>On Saturday, as fires raged across the country, Mongeau posted a slideshow of herself smoking weed, half-undressed, and posing in designer clothing in a splashy LA home. In the caption, she promoted her OnlyFans. It was a very on-brand post for Mongeau, and her audience was furious.</p>
<p>i might start posting on IG daily again cause this what life been looking like every day..🤍 always grateful i have @iblamerusty capturing me in my natural habitat &lt;3 and u already know where to get the raunchier version of these pics 🤑🤑🤑 (and yes that’s a fucking pool above my head in that one pic the fuck) A post shared by tana mongeau (@tanamongeau) on May 30, 2020 at 7:05pm PDT May 30, 2020 at 7:05pm PDT</p>
<p>Immediately underneath a few complimentary comments from friends, the backlash is clear. &ldquo;So you STILL won&rsquo;t talk about what is happening in your own words? I am disappointed in you and not sure if I should be a fan,&rdquo; one commenter said. &ldquo;people are dying tuna,&rdquo; another noted. &ldquo;pls speak out about the protests tana this is embarrassing :(&rdquo; pleaded one commenter.</p>
<p>On Twitter, a micro-influencer and real-life friend of Mongeau shared an open letter that received more than 2,000 likes calling on Mongeau to support Black Lives Matter.</p>
<p>The backlash resulted in Mongeau completely re-branding across platforms to change her various display names to &ldquo;Black Lives Matter,&rdquo; posting various messages of support for the movement, explaining her white privilege, and linking to resources, petitions, and ways to donate.</p>
<p>For her fans, it was crucial that Mongeau seize the current political movement and stand up for her Black friends, peers, and followers. She quickly and enthusiastically gave into the demands, and so have most of the influencers and celebrities who were criticized. Notably, the Kardashian and Jenner sisters turned comments off on their posts, which came days after the protests had started, anticipating even more backlash after it took days to craft their statements.</p>
<p>Despite not having a sizeable impact on the actual protests, it&rsquo;s important for many teenagers who are digitally engaged to see their progressive views reflected in the people they follow. For &ldquo;stan&rdquo; communities, or accounts that are entirely devoted to a celebrity or influencer of the person&rsquo;s choice, these pro-Black Lives Matter statements are crucial to the reputation of not only the influencer but of their own fans. For &ldquo;stans,&rdquo; their own identities are wrapped up in the people that they admire. A post from Mongeau may not instill any real change, but it gives her fans a sense of security that they are doing the right thing by continuing to support her.</p>
<p>On &ldquo;@tiktokroom,&rdquo; an Instagram page dedicated to chronicling and discussing the drama of famous TikTokers, a post asked the account&rsquo;s nearly 700,000 followers to discuss which influencers were surprisingly silent about the protests. The responses reveal that the teen-skewing audience of famous TikTokers wants more from the people who entertain them on the app beyond their TikTok content.</p>
<p>And do you think they have a responsibility to do so? - idea from @theshaderoom A post shared by The Tiktok Shaderoom (@tiktokroom) on May 31, 2020 at 12:07am PDT May 31, 2020 at 12:07am PDT</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bhad bhabie since she wants to steal our culture so bad,&rdquo; is one top response, referring to white 17-year-old rapper and &ldquo;Dr. Phil&rdquo; alum Danielle Bregoli, AKA Bhad Bhabie, who has been criticized for Black cultural appropriation. &ldquo;none cause it&rsquo;s all expected 😐&rdquo; says another top response, followed by &ldquo;everybody who hasn&rsquo;t said anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And while Fischer of &ldquo;@traderjoeslist&rdquo; may not have devoted &ldquo;stan&rdquo; accounts, it&rsquo;s clear that embracing causes like Black Lives Matter is crucial to widespread success – unless you have a majority conservative audience, or an audience that would otherwise respond poorly to your support of Black Lives Matter.</p>
<p>But among apolitical accounts, the expectation to support Black lives is the loudest majority opinion. For proponents of the cause, this isn&rsquo;t meaningless. It suggests that among mainstream influencers and celebrities, it is no longer an easy option to stay silent. Compared to Black Lives Matter protests of past years, this expectation has only grown.</p>
<p>For a celebrity with a strong online following, fans expect more than just a blasé attitude about the protests.</p>
<p>Both Fischer and Mongeau are white female examples of the Black Lives Matter influencer backlash on social media, but even Black musician and Twitter personality Lil Nas X apologized for not speaking out sooner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;i honestly feel as though it has become so normalized that even i myself am numb to police brutality towards black people,&rdquo; Lil Nas X, whose real name is Montero Lamar Hill, wrote. Initially, he linked to a widely-circulated Change.org petition that has over 10 million signatures and argued that the four officers involved in Floyd&rsquo;s death should be fired (they were) and that charges should be filed (ex-officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd&rsquo;s neck, has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter).</p>
<p>Hill also linked to the Minnesota Freedom Fund, a widely-shared bail fund for Minneapolis protesters. Many influencers and celebrities are donating and directing fans to donate to bail funds (which has inspired some on the right to push back against those donating, claiming the funds empower violence and riots).</p>
<p>But what Hill did next was even more popular than just his initial statements of support.</p>
<p>Hill went on to advise his 4.7 million Twitter followers to wear protective eyewear at protests. He pointed out specific examples of police escalating violence among peaceful protesters and defended those protesting. He helped rationalize why protesters were angry, writing &ldquo;this riot/protest situation is the same as a child being bullied at school. you are silent while they are being mistreated but upset when they finally snap back. had u spoke up while they were being mistreated they wouldn&rsquo;t have had to snap back. silence equals complicity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By engaging with the issues his followers cared about in such great detail, Hill proved that he wasn&rsquo;t just posting to avoid hate; he actually cares about Black Lives Matter, a cause that digitally-engaged teens across the US are resonating with in huge numbers. It&rsquo;s clear, based on Hill&rsquo;s thorough and well-received response to the protests, why fans of other celebrities and influencers get angry when those influencers&rsquo; responses are late, are deemed &ldquo;not enough,&rdquo; or never come at all.

<h3 id="influencer-kameron-lester-says-jeffree-star-made-him-the-token-black-kid">&ldquo;Influencer Kameron Lester says Jeffree Star made him the ‘token Black kid’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/1080/0-202-1080-720/azure/dazed-prod/1290/2/1292918.jpg" alt="img">
Look, we get it, none of us want to hear about another drama involving Jeffree Star – there are so, so, so many – but here we are anyway.</p>
<p>Yesterday, beauty influencer Kameron Lester called out the YouTuber for tokenising and silencing him when they worked together. Posted on his account via an IGTV entitled ‘Fear and Manipulation within the beauty community’, Lester explains that Star often promised to help him with his career, but never followed through. “I just felt like it was never a friendship, it was never a friendship in the beginning to start with, it was always just something like I was the kind of like the token black kid,” he says.</p>
<p>He goes on to detail being put on the spot by Star about whether he liked James Charles – who he says supported him early in his career – and then being told “Well, you don’t fucking owe him forever,” when he said he didn’t have a problem with him. From then on, Lester says he was no longer supported by Star or Shane Dawson and was outcast.</p>
<p>“I felt like this was a game. Even with Shane Dawson posting me on his platform, I was grateful,” he says. “But I felt like it was kind of to silence me to be like, ‘We’re gonna keep giving you breadcrumbs and hanging you by a string and manipulating you so you can stay quiet.’ I felt always silenced.”</p>
<p>Despite being “so scared” of Star, Lester wanted to speak out and promises: “I will no longer just be the Black boy that is there to make you look good or speak up for you”. You can continue to support Lester (and other Black creatives in the beauty industry) by following them on their social channels, as well as checking out this extensive (but not exhaustive) list of Black-owned beauty brands that you can give your money to.</p>
