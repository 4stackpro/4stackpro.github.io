SBI Alert! SBI announces 3-month EMI moratorium. Check how it impacts your loan</p>
<p>SBI Loan Moratorium: State Bank of India (SBI), India&rsquo;s largest lender has good news for its customers, amid coronavirus crisis. SBI Bank has announced all its term loan borrowers a three-month moratorium for its customers under the terms of a COVID-19 RBI package announced on Friday. This comes days after Reserve Bank of India (RBI) allowed all lending institutions &ndash; banks and housing finance companies will have to give its borrowers a three-month moratorium on &lsquo;term loans&rsquo;. SBI customers were wondering since RBI&rsquo;s announcement whether their loan EMIs will automatically get deferred or will they have to apply. SBI has now made it clear about what it is going to do with loan EMIs for its customers.</p>
<p>Making the big announcement, the State Bank of India tweeted: &ldquo;In terms of RBI COVID-19 regulatory package, SBI has initiated steps to defer the instalments and interest/EMIs on Term Loans falling due between 01.03.2020 to 31.05.2020 and extended the repayment period by 3 months. The interest on Working Capital facilities for the period 01.03.2020 to 31.05.2020 is also deferred to 30.06.2020.&rdquo; It must be noted that interest will be deferred and not waived during the three month EMI pause. Effectively, this order is EMI moratorium is a relief measure if you have a cash crunch and not something that you should avail if not needed now.</p>
<p>SBI&rsquo;s term loan moratorium will bring relief to all borrowers, including those who have home loans, auto loans, education loans, agricultural term loans, retail and crop loans to their names. It will also be applicable on credit card dues. Besides retail borrowers, micro, small and medium enterprises and large companies will also benefit from the RBI&rsquo;s relaxation of loan repayment.</p>
<p>The scheme would be available to all borrowers having standard account with the bank, meaning they have no record on default in the past.</p>
<p>Bank has also issued mailers and put FAQs on their sites informing the customers about the scheme.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on Friday announced a three-month moratorium on EMIs of all term loans due during March 1 to May 31 and said that the repayment schedule for all those loans would be shifted by three months after the moratorium.</p>

<p>This article was originally published by the Oregonian/OregonLive, one of more than a dozen news organizations throughout the state sharing their coverage of the novel coronavirus outbreak to help inform Oregonians about this evolving health issue.</p>
<p>Oregon Gov. Kate Brown placed a 90-day moratorium on commercial evictions for nonpayment Wednesday, bringing relief to thousands of businesses facing their first rent payments since losing significant revenue due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Brown had previously placed a ban on residential evictions, prohibiting landlords from charging tenants late fees for nonpayment of rent during the moratorium. But Oregon was slow to follow other cities and states in extending the moratorium to commercial leases.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, The Oregonian/OregonLive.com spoke to restaurant owners facing “panic” and “frustration” over the prospects of missing rent and being locked out of their businesses by landlords after weeks of diminished or no revenue. The order comes just more than two weeks after Brown placed a ban on on-premises dining at restaurants and bars across the state.</p>
<p>“During this unprecedented public health crisis, too many Oregonians have found themselves with no way to pay the monthly rent for their homes and businesses,” Brown wrote in a press release. “These are difficult times. This order will help Oregon small businesses stay in their locations without the threat of evictio

<h3 id="despite-moratorium-some-lenders-ask-for-march-emis">Despite moratorium, some lenders ask for March EMIs</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-74940770,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-400971,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg" alt="img">
Kolkata: Some lenders appear to be flouting the Reserve Bank of India &lsquo;s (RBI) directive to banks to offer moratorium to borrowers on repayment of loans for the month of March. Some leading non-bank lenders and private sector banks told their microfinance clients to pay up for March, with repayment amounts already getting deducted in the case of some. “The NBFC MFIs have managed to collect repayment from the end-borrowers till March 21. So, there should not be any cash flow issue for them in this cycle. That’s why, we have insisted them to pay their instalments till now,” a private bank chief executive said. “The situation may change in the next two months. Our board will come out with a policy soon reflecting on what RBI said,” he said.Some lenders with sizeable loan exposure to MFIs have deducted the instalments on the first day of the month. They said the policy on moratorium is still a work under progress. Another leading non-bank lender is learnt to have called back loan against shares given to the promoter of a top NBFC-MFI, anticipating stress for the latter as cash flow for microfinance firms dried up. This is despite the promoter topping up his pledge with additional shares.Such moves have made MFIs anxious as they create uncertainty and appear to go against the RBI guidelines. The pay-day pressure multiplied their pain. NBFC MFIs have suspended both loan disbursements and collections immediately after the countrywide lockdown was imposed. The RBI last week gave relief to borrowers by agreeing to defer the payment of interest and principal for three months till the end of May. It asked bank boards to formulate appropriate policies for giving such relief. “Whether lenders will offer moratorium or not will technically depend on their respective policies, That’s the lacuna left by RBI,” a chief executive of a leading NBFC-MFI said.“The RBI scheme came too close to the month-end. With the country being on lockdown and boards working from home, there may be delays in rolling out the moratorium scheme (by lenders),” said Sanjaya Gupta, managing director at PNB Housing Finance . “We are going to pay all term-loan instalments as we have enough liquidity,” he said.The moratorium on terms loans, otherwise, is applicable to all segments, irrespective of the segment and the tenure of the term loans. The original repayment period for term loans will get extended by 90 days. For example, a loan repayable in 60 instalments maturing on March 1, 2025 will mature on June 1, 2025. According to FAQ released by Indian Banks’ Association, firms may also request banks to reassess their working capital requirements on account of disruption of their cash flows or elongating the working capital cycle.
