<p>Eric Bana is one of Australia&rsquo;s most recognisable stars and is known for roles including Troy, Hulk and Dirty John.</p>
<p>And now his wife Rebecca Bana (née Gleeson) has revealed why they ditched living in Hollywood to be based in Melbourne.</p>
<p>Rebecca, 49, admitted in a candid interview this week that the pair are &lsquo;happier in Australia,&rsquo; living an ordinary life in the quiet suburbs of Melbourne with their two adult children.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are happier in Australia&rsquo;: Rebecca Gleeson (pictured left) has revealed why she and actor husband Eric Bana (pictured right) ditched living in Hollywood to move to Melbourne</p>
<p>Speaking to the Herald Sun, Rebecca explained travelling around the world with her husband for his work was an isolating experience for her and their children Klaus and Sophia, now 20 and 18 respectively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;d travel somewhere and I&rsquo;d be like, &ldquo;How can I kind of make it like home? How can I get piano lessons and a bit of sport and school?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;d go to these countries and the kids wouldn&rsquo;t have a single friend and there was no support, there was no childcare, it was just us buckling down and trying to create a life on our own.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Familiar face: Eric is one of Australia&rsquo;s most recognisable stars and is known for roles including Troy, Hulk and Dirty John</p>
<p>At first, Rebecca felt it was her &lsquo;job&rsquo; to be supportive of Eric&rsquo;s blossoming career, but later realised their family feeling &lsquo;safe&rsquo; and &lsquo;grounded&rsquo; was just as important.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We were always happier in Australia,&rsquo; Rebecca said, adding that they wanted their children to go to school in Australia.</p>
<p>Rebecca went on to explain while it seems like the next step for actors to move to Hollywood, Eric found he could go a decade without shooting near Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Eric first became a television star in Australia when he joined the cast of sketch comedy series Full Frontal.</p>
<p>Priorities: At first, Rebecca felt it was her &lsquo;job&rsquo; to be supportive of Eric&rsquo;s blossoming career, but later realised their family feeling &lsquo;safe&rsquo; and &lsquo;grounded&rsquo; was just as important</p>
<p>But he made the shift into dramatic acting in the 2000 film Chopper, a biopic about infamous criminal Mark &lsquo;Chopper&rsquo; Read.</p>
<p>At the time, U.S. movie critic Roger Ebert described the comedian as &lsquo;a future star&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This turned out to be prophetic, as he went on to appear in Hollywood films Hulk (2003), Troy (2004), Star Trek (2009) and The Time Traveler&rsquo;s Wife (2009).</p>
<p>Eric first met Rebecca in 1995, when she was working as a TV publicist. They married two years later after he proposed during a trip to America.

Even after 16 years of its release, Troy still popularly remains as one of Wolfgang Petersen&rsquo;s most beautiful works. Petersen and Pitt&rsquo;s collaboration swept the audience off their feet.

Oscar winner Brad Pitt can basically have his pick of roles. Starring in dozens of films since the 90s, the actor is considered one of today’s biggest box office draws.</p>
<p>Despite his success, Pitt sometimes became frustrated with a film’s final product or how his character was portrayed. After one movie in particular, the Once Upon A Time in Hollywood star decided to make a “distinct shift” in picking roles.</p>
<p>Brad Pitt | Amy Sussman/Getty Images</p>
<p>Brad Pitt wants deeper roles</p>
<p>With Pitt taking on more contemplative roles in recent years, fans are seeing the actor in films that are quite different from his earlier work.</p>
<p>“In the ’90s I did become aware that there was this kind of leading-man role that you could plug any of us into and it didn’t even matter,” Pitt told The New York Times in December. “We would all have the same result.”</p>
<p>Pitt now considers how he can add something to a role rather than just going for cookie-cutter fare. “As I’ve gotten older, I’ve become more conscious of thinking, If I am the one to play something, what can I bring that’s unique?” he said.</p>
<p>RELATED: Brad Pitt’s Role in ‘Se7en’ Was Turned Down by This Academy Award-Winning Superstar</p>
<p>A Coen brothers film that didn’t take off</p>
<p>In his NYT interview, Pitt revealed that he almost had an opportunity to work with famed directors Joel and Ethan Coen, but the project never materialized.</p>
<p>“There was this defining film I never got to do, a Coen brothers film called To the White Sea,” Pitt recalled. “We had an opportunity to go, and then it was shut down.”</p>
<p>Sharing that actors get a myriad of opinions on what professional direction to take, Pitt revealed that early on he would often follow opinions being thrust upon him. “When you’re trying to figure things out in your career, you get a lot of advice,” he said. “People are telling you that you should be doing this, and other people are saying you should be doing that.”</p>

<p>After the Coen brothers film evaporated, Pitt listened to others rather than himself on what he should do next. “Another interesting opportunity arose, and instead I was talked into: ‘No, you need to be doing this other thing. You can get to your art project later.'” the Ad Astra star said. “I ended up taking that advice.”</p>
<p>Brad Pitt on working with Wolfgang Petersen</p>
<p>In the 2004 epic film Troy, Pitt starred in the title role along with Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom, Diane Kruger, and Rose Byrne. Despite being a huge box office success, Troy was not a favorite of Pitt’s.</p>
<p>“I was disappointed in it,” Pitt admitted. “I had to do Troy because — I guess I can say all this now — I pulled out of another movie and then had to do something for the studio. So I was put in Troy. It wasn’t painful, but I realized that the way that movie was being told was not how I wanted it to be. I made my own mistakes in it.”</p>
<p>A particular way the movie was shot rubbed the actor the wrong way. “I could not get out of the middle of the frame,” he explained. “It was driving me crazy.”</p>
<p>RELATED: Why Brad Pitt Was ‘Miserable’ Starring in This Film With Tom Cruise</p>
<p>Previously teaming up with director David Fincher for films including Se7en and Fight Club, Pitt apparently had grown accustomed to his style over Troy director Wolfgang Petersen’s technique.</p>
<p>“I’d become spoiled working with David Fincher,” Pitt said. “It’s no slight on Wolfgang Petersen. Das Boot is one of the all-time great films. But somewhere in it, Troy became a commercial kind of thing. Every shot was like, Here’s the hero! There was no mystery.”</p>
<p>The Moneyball star revealed that the experience served as the catalyst to picking more substantial roles. “About that time I made a decision that I was only going to invest in quality stories, for lack of a better term,” Pitt shared. “It was a distinct shift that led to the next decade of films.”</p>
<p>Apparently, that “shift” is working for Pitt since he just won an Oscar for Once Upon A Time in Hollywood.

If you&rsquo;re looking for a fluffy romance drama to ease the strain of, oh, the whole global pandemic thing, do I have the pick for you: Sweet Magnolias, which dropped on Netflix May 19. Based on the Sweet Magnolias book series, this fluffy small-town drama is created in the vein of Hart of Dixie and Gilmore Girls, with ingredients including: a small, tight-knit town; frequent cocktail nights; love triangles; and a sense of earnestness that doesn&rsquo;t generally feel forced or fake. JoAnna Garcia plays Maddie Townsend, the lovable protagonist who&rsquo;s forced to start over when her husband (Chris Klein) runs off with his pregnant mistress (a very apologetic-looking Jamie Lynn Spears). We have bro-y friendships and curious teenagers, Sunday church services and a beloved local restaurant, not to mention plenty of heavy Southern accents (the show is set in Serenity, South Carolina). The inversion of edgy small-town drama Big Little Lies, this fluffy romance series will do your tired heart some good; it&rsquo;s as soothing as the spa that the three best friends who helm the series found together. Here&rsquo;s your guide to who plays who.</p>
