<p>Along with a throwback picture, actress Taapsee Pannu on Thursday shared a noteworthy message about body positivity and self-love.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old star hopped on to Instagram to share a behind-the-scenes picture of hers from an earlier shoot.</p>
<p>Dressed in a blue sari, the ‘Mulk’ actor is seen flashing a beautiful smile and flaunting her short curls.</p>
<p>“I remember how I was concerned that my short hair won’t suit the sarees he makes Coz they r so traditional but he was so nonchalant about it n said we will use your original hair length, colour, texture, everything natural, everything YOU [sic],” she wrote while talking about a photo shoot she did for designer Gaurang Shah.</p>
<p>The ‘Badla’ actor later stressed that “sometimes you just have to embrace how you look only then the world will embrace it. Shying away from how you look is never going to help you grow in life.”</p>
<p>She concluded the post by saying: “The day I accepted my flaws was the day I came into my true self n my flaws helped me get a unique identity.”

<p>Untitled Carousel Taapsee Pannu shares throwback picture with her tattoo for Pink Bollywood actress Taapsee Pannu on Wednesday shared a throwback picture from her film Pink. The talented actress has been treating her fans with a series of throwback pictures amid the 21-day lockdown and quarantine to contain the spread of the deadly coronavirus.</p>
<p>The coronavirus-induced lockdown has thrown’s schedule for a toss. Theadmits that once normalcy returns, she will have to rejig her calendar to accommodate all five films that were to be shot this year. “If we get back on track in May, we can’t kick off Rashmi Rocket (a sports-drama with her as an athlete) in Kutch as the Rann will be scorching around that time. Similarly,Lapeta (adaptation of the German cult thriller Run Lola Run) will be shot across Mumbai and in Goa. If it’s raining, how will I run?” she points out resignedly.Scheduling glitches aside, Taapsee is kicked about the latter. Describing it as “a new-age comedy with a very interesting visual quality”, she informs that “it won’t be shot like a regular film”. The actress goes on to add that she’s had enough of making people cry for a year, with films like Badla, Saand Ki Aankh and Thappad, and now wants to evoke different emotions. “The humour in Looop Lapeta is dry, sarcastic and situational. It comes more from the pauses than punchlines,” she asserts.With blue tank top and faded denims off-set by flaming red hair, the original’s titular, played by, conjures an image as iconic as the film. Ask Taapsee if there are plans to recreate the look and she rules out the red hair. “We don’t want to copy the film scene by scene. Also, it’s not that radical anymore,” insists the actress, who’d dyed her hair for’s Manmarziyaan, promising that her character will have an edgy look.Taapsee adds that there are a lot of flashback scenes in the script and she will have several looks. “But the story takes place in one day, so I’ll be in the same look for the most part of the film,” she reasons.Before schedules went awry because of the pandemic, Taapsee was to head to a foreign location for Anurag’s horror-thriller. “Now, we have to wait till travel restrictions are lifted. But Anurag finishes a film within 35 days, so we just have to reach the location and brace ourselves for a start-toend schedule. I’m not worried,” she states.And what’s her role in Anubhav Sinha’s next, Anek? “I am not a part of that film as is being speculated; it has,” she clarifies, adding with a chuckle, “We are alternating now.”

<p>Actor Taapsee Pannu has revealed that her film Looop Lapeta - an official adaptation of German thriller Run Lola Run - is not as radical as the original, adding that the Hindi version has dry and sarcastic humour.</p>
<p>Taapsee told Mumbai Mirror in an interview, “The humour in Looop Lapeta is dry, sarcastic and situational. It comes more from the pauses than punchlines. We don’t want to copy the film scene by scene. Also, it’s not that radical anymore.”</p>

<p>She also revealed that she was supposed to shoot for Anurag Kashyap’s horror film in a foreign location before the lockdown was announced due to the coronavirus pandemic. “Now, we have to wait till travel restrictions are lifted. But Anurag finishes a film within 35 days, so we just have to reach the location and brace ourselves for a start-to-end schedule. I’m not worried,” she told the tabloid, adding, “If we get back on track in May, we can’t kick off Rashmi Rocket (a sports-drama with her as an athlete) in Kutch as the Rann will be scorching around that time. Similarly, Looop Lapeta (adaptation of the German cult thriller Run Lola Run) will be shot across Mumbai and in Goa. If it’s raining, how will I run?.”</p>
<p>Recently seen in Mission Mangal, in which she reunited with Baby and Naam Shabana co-star Akshay Kumar, and Anubhav Sinha’s Thappad, Taapsee also has comic thriller Haseen Dillruba and Shabaash Mithu, in which she essays the role of cricketer Mithali Raj.</p>
<p>Currently in lockdown, Taapsee has been sharing throwback pictures on social media. Recently, she shared a picture from the days of her film Manmarziyaan. She wrote how she coloured her hair red for the character of Rumi. She wrote, “Typical Anurag Kashyap prep&hellip;.. last minute ! Got the idea of colouring the hair red after I landed in Amritsar. This is the first time I felt the skin of Rumi , that is, 2 days before we went for shoot.”</p>
