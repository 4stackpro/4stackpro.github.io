<p>Chris Lopez seems to have thrown some shade toward his ex, Kailyn Lowry. The comments appear to be made toward the Teen Mom 2 alum after she had responded to a photographer allegedly sharing a nude photo of her from a maternity photoshoot without her consent. As InTouch Weekly pointed out, Lopez posted a few remarks to his Instagram story on Friday that seems to address the issue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a parent, you should be more concerned with your child&rsquo;s happiness than your petty insecurities and jealousies. Just a thought,&rdquo; Lopez wrote. &ldquo;[People] really need to grow up. [Shaking my head]. It&rsquo;s really sad,&rdquo; he later added, along with a thumbs down emoji. He&rsquo;s previously stated that he &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t believe the [photo] was leaked.&rdquo; In the comments section of the Teen Mom Shade Room, Lowry decried Lopez&rsquo;s claim, writing that &ldquo;the photographer herself posted the photo without my permission. F— Chris for saying that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lowry had previously addressed the issue with her photographer on Thursday in an emotional Instagram post. &ldquo;My team and I have been made aware that a personal photo of me was posted online without my knowledge or permission,&rdquo; she wrote in the caption. &ldquo;To say I am deeply saddened and humiliated, especially after the ill-advised posting of my previous maternity photo, is an understatement. I had no plans to release this photograph. I ask that any accounts that have reposted it to remove it, and other accounts to refrain from reposting it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The former couple are parents to 2-year-old son Lux, while Lowry is also mom to 10-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Lincoln from prior ex-boyfriends Jo Rivera and Javi Marroquin, respectively. The reality star also revealed she was expecting her fourth child back in February and shortly thereafter announced it would be a baby boy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re confirming the news, baby number four is coming soon! I&rsquo;m almost 16 weeks pregnant and it&rsquo;s been a rough few months this time around. I&rsquo;ve had nausea, morning sickness, and absolutely no energy. This week I&rsquo;m starting to feel a bit better and I&rsquo;m really hoping it stays this way,&rdquo; she wrote at the time.</p>
<p>In March, Lowry also blasted some online trolls who accused her of having children in exchange for cash. &ldquo;I wish I got paid for having babies. I think the last, twins, could&rsquo;ve really made us millionaires, too,&rdquo; one user wrote in her Instagram comments. In response to the message, Lowry replied simply, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get paid to have babies. But OK.&rdquo;

<h3 id="teen-mom-2-star-kailyn-lowry-shares-advice-about-being-a-single-mom">‘Teen Mom 2&rsquo; Star Kailyn Lowry Shares Advice About Being a Single Mom</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/kailyn-lowry-teen-mom-single.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1080px%2C567px&amp;resize=1200%2C630" alt="img">
Riding solo. Teen Mom 2 star Kailyn Lowry shared some advice about being a single mother during a Q&amp;A session on her Instagram Story. The 28-year-old said being the head of the household is no easy task.</p>
<p>“I’m entering the single mom club, advice? You’re the bomb!” one fan asked the expecting mother on Tuesday, April 21. “It’s exhausting at times,” she admitted. “It can feel really f–king lonely. You’ll probably go through waves of emotions in the beginning — sadness, then maybe empowerment. But maybe look forward to having a day to yourself every other week … but it’ll get easier. It’s a learning curve. Just do not question yourself as long as you know you would do anything for your little one(s).”</p>

<p>Following her wise words, another fan asked the reality star how she manages her three children — Isaac, 10, Lincoln, 6, and Lux, 2 — and one on the way. “It’s not always easy,” she revealed. “But it’s always worth it. Remember that!”</p>
<p>Also during the Q&amp;A, Kail admitted she and her boys are a little “anxious” for the arrival of baby No. 4, despite being a veteran in the mom game. The MTV personality first revealed she was expecting again in February. “Baby No. 4 is coming soon!” she shared on Instagram at the time. “I’m almost 16 weeks pregnant and it’s been a rough few months this time around. I’ve had nausea, morning sickness and absolutely no energy.”</p>
<p>In March, she gave an update on her growing baby and posted a picture of her latest ultrasound. “He was breech, but seems to have turned since our last ultrasound,” she said on social media. “This time around, I have an anterior placenta so movement feels a lot different than any of my previous pregnancies.”</p>

<p>This will be Kailyn’s second child with baby daddy Chris Lopez. They have had a tumultuous relationship since welcoming their first son, Lux, in 2017.</p>
<p>Despite her nerves and tough pregnancy, Kailyn is grateful to be spending quality time with her older sons before their newest family member arrives. We can’t wait to meet him!

<h3 id="teen-mom-2-kailyn-lowry-keeps-fans-in-line-about-baby-4s-name">‘Teen Mom 2’ Kailyn Lowry Keeps Fans In Line About Baby #4’s Name</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.tvshowsace.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kailyn-Lowry-@kaillowry-%E2%80%A2-Instagram-photos-and-videos.jpg" alt="img">
‘Teen Mom 2’ Kailyn Lowry Keeps Fans In Line About Baby #4’s Name</p>
<p>InTouch Weekly shares that Teen Mom 2 alum, Kailyn Lowry, puts fans back in line after speculation about baby number 4’s name.</p>
<p>Kailyn Gives No Hidden Clues Here</p>
<p>Speculation of baby number 4’s name began after Kailyn tweeted about her love of Law &amp; Order SVU’s character, Elliot. She tweets, “I just don’t think I’ve recovered from Elliot leaving Law &amp; Order SVU yet.</p>
<p>In response, a fan tweeted, “Is that code for what you’re naming the new baby?” Albeit a clever way to drop a name, Kailyn tweets back, “Isaac’s middle name is Elliot. So, no. LOL.”</p>
<p>Kailyn’s older boys are named Issac, Lincoln, and Lux. Fans remember her lengthy process for naming Lux. Heartwarmingly, Kailyn writes in an Instagram caption the meaning of the youngest-at-the-time’s name, “Lux–from Latin, literally ‘light’.” Also of note in the naming babies realm, Kailyn legally changed Lux’s last name from Lopez to Lowry.</p>
<p>Relationship Status Update</p>
<p>Baby number 4 will be the second child between Kailyn and Chris Lopez. Lux was born in 2017 and the pair have been off and on since then. There are rumors that Chris cheated on Kailyn while they were official. Given the public nature of Kailyn being a reality television star, it’s hard to imagine the following, but there is also speculation that she’s been a side piece this whole time.</p>
<p>Kailyn claims in an Us Weekly interview that Chris “admitted to intentionally getting [her] pregnant.” For reasons unknown at this time, Kailyn says she is no longer “in contact” with Chris. Researching the duo’s past leads to a series of headlines alleging domestic violence and detailing arrests. Us Weekly reports that two arrests occurred after a protection order was put in place in October 2019.</p>
<p>Additionally, Kailyn tells Us Weekly, “Legally, I’m not able to go into detail. Domestic violence and narcissism are very real subjects, and when I’m in the place to be able to offer advice, I will.”</p>
<p>Kailyn discusses the tumultuous relationship prior to her current pregnancy. She says, “Within the next year if we’re still doing this, I’m not gonna do it anymore. I’m getting to the point where, eventually, I want to be with someone and raise my kids with someone and have a life together and do all that because I do get so emotional and lonely. ”</p>
<p>All of that to say, Kailyn isn’t backing down from the challenge of raising four children on her own, according to The Sun. She says that she’s ready to raise the baby on her own.</p>
