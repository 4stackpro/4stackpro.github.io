(CNN) Hospitals in New York are giving Covid-19 patients heartburn medicine to see if it helps fight the virus, according to the doctor who initiated the trial.</p>
<p>Preliminary results of the clinical trial of famotidine , the active ingredient in Pepcid, could come out in the next few weeks, said Dr. Kevin Tracey, president of Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research at Northwell Health, which runs 23 hospitals in the New York City area.</p>
<p>So far, 187 patients have enrolled in the clinical trial, and Northwell eventually hopes to enroll 1,200, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many examples in the history of medicine where a drug that was designed for one purpose turns out to have an effect in another disease,&rdquo; Tracey said.</p>
<p>He said if famotidine works &ndash; and that&rsquo;s a big if at this point &ndash; it would be easy to use it on a widespread scale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s generic, it&rsquo;s plentiful and it&rsquo;s inexpensive,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>But he emphasized that it might not work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know if it has any benefit. We really don&rsquo;t. I swear we don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;People are hoping for anything. But we need to do this clinical trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He also emphasized that the patients in the study are in the hospital taking mega-doses intravenously &ndash; doses about nine times what someone would normally take for heartburn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should not go to the drugstore and take a bunch of heartburn medicine,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Learning from Chinese patients&rsquo; medications</p>
<p>Tracey and his colleagues got the idea to study famotidine after it was observed that some patients in China taking the drug fared better than patients not taking the drug.</p>
<p>He said studies on the Chinese patients have not yet been published, but that Dr. Michael Callahan, an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital who worked with coronavirus patients in China, observed that some people with lower incomes were surviving longer than their wealthier counterparts who also had heartburn.</p>
<p>When Callahan and the Chinese doctors looked closer, they found that many of the people with lower incomes were taking famotidine, whereas the wealthier patients tended to take a different, more expensive drug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor peasants really seemed to do well on famotidine,&rdquo; Tracey said. &ldquo;There are a lot of anecdotes passing around that give us some hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Callahan could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>The famotidine study was first reported in Science Magazine</p>
<p>Tracey said in addition to the observation in Chinese patients, Florida-based Alchem Laboratories used a computer model to make a list of existing drugs that might fight coronavirus, and famotidine showed up near the top of the list.</p>
<p>He said that&rsquo;s because, theoretically, the structure of famotidine is such that it could stop the virus from replicating, in the same way that protease inhibitors, which are used to treat HIV, stop that virus.</p>
<p>Concerns about famotidine shortages</p>
<p>In the Northwell trial, all the patients are taking hydroxychloroquine.</p>
<p>Tracey said that when the study started in early April, doctors and patients were insisting on using hydroxychloroquine, and in effect, it became the standard of care.</p>
<p>President Trump has frequently touted the drug as a &ldquo;game-changer&rdquo; in the fight against the virus, although recent studies have suggested it doesn&rsquo;t help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have to be fair to people &ndash; they&rsquo;re reading in the paper and hearing on the news that hydroxychloroquine works and they look at their dying wife or grandma or child and they want to try it and how could we say no? What kind of person would say no?&rdquo; Tracey said.</p>
<p>Half of the patient in the study will be given famotidine in addition to hydroxychloroquine. The other half will be given intravenous saline as a placebo, which has no effect.</p>
<p>Hydroxychloroquine might not be used in the study moving forward, since last week, the US Food and Drug Administration warned against its use for coronavirus because of possible side effects.</p>
<p>Tracey said the independent board monitoring the trial will make the decision about whether to continue including hydroxychloroquine in the study.</p>
<p>He added that Northwell kept the study quiet until now because of the experience with doctors rushing to put patients on hydroxychloroquine. He doesn&rsquo;t want that same rush for intravenous famotidine &ndash; it&rsquo;s unclear if it works, and if there&rsquo;s a rush on the drug, his research team might not have enough for their study subjects.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s also concerned that people who don&rsquo;t have heartburn will rush to stores to buy famotidine pills, mistakenly convinced it will help against coronavirus.</p>
<p>That could leave heartburn patients in the lurch, especially since the FDA pulled Zantac &ndash; a different heartburn medicine &ndash; off the market earlier this month due to possible contamination.</p>
<p>He said these are unusual concerns at an unusual time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the reality of trying to do the right thing in a pandemic. It&rsquo;s very, very hard,&rdquo; he said.

<p>2020-04-27 09:42:35</p>
<p>〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕美國的武漢肺炎嚴重疫區紐約，有大型醫療網絡對確診患者投入大劑量的非處方藥物法莫替丁（famotidine，可抑制胃酸分泌，主要治療消化性潰瘍和胃食道逆流），目前已有187名病患參加了臨床試驗，研究人員將分析法莫替丁是否真的有效。</p>
<p>據《CNN》報導，紐約最大醫療系統Northwell Health的費恩斯坦醫學研究所（Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research）博士特雷西（Kevin Tracey），透露法莫替丁的臨床試驗已於4月7日開始，初步結果將在幾週內出爐。</p>
<p>請繼續往下閱讀&hellip;</p>
<p>特雷西和同事們之所以提出法莫替丁療法，是因為他們注意到中國服用該藥的部分患者，狀況比沒服用法莫替丁的病患更好；佛羅里達州醫療實驗室Alchem Laboratories分析了可能治療武漢肺炎的現有藥物，也將法莫替丁放在首位。</p>
<p>特雷西預計在紐約最終會讓1200名確診者參與這次治療，病患由靜脈注射的法莫替丁，會比一般口服劑量高出9倍左右。</p>

<h3 id="government-scientist-felt-pressured-to-approve-contract-for-work-on-drug-trump-touted">Government scientist felt pressured to approve contract for work on drug Trump touted</h3>
<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4b84168/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4534x2380+0+321/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa2%2Ff4%2Fe439523e4d2e8c2898de5df7e05b%2Fvirus-outbreak-trump-00762.jpg" alt="img">
The federal scientist recently ousted from a senior position overseeing research on coronavirus vaccines felt pressured by Trump administration officials to award a $21-million contract to a Florida laboratory to study an anti-malaria drug touted by the president as a COVID-19 treatment, according to a person familiar with the incident.</p>
<p>Rick Bright, who was abruptly removed this week from his senior post at the Department of Health and Human Services, was told by officials to approve the contract for a clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine to Alchem Laboratories, a small drug-development firm, the person said.</p>
<p>“He was very concerned and was ordered to do it,” said the person.</p>
<p>The contract with the laboratory introduces a new element to an episode that burst into public view this week. The controversy began when Bright said he had been demoted because he resisted pressure from administration officials to provide widespread access to hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug that President Trump repeatedly has touted as a potential cure for COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The government awarded the contract to Alchem on April 14, a week before Bright was moved out of his job running the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a research agency within the Health and Human Services Department that, among other duties, was overseeing research on coronavirus vaccines.</p>
<p>The internal fight over the study was part of a weeks-long clash pitting Bright and his team of immunologists against senior administration officials who, he says, were seeking regulatory approval for nationwide, unsupervised use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>Bright had been pushing for a controlled study of the drug before it was put into widespread use. The study proposed by Alchem and backed by senior officials at the department called for combining hydroxychloroquine with intravenous doses of famotidine, an anti-heartburn drug known by the brand name Pepcid.</p>
<p>The design of the planned study appears to have been a key concern to Bright, according to the person familiar with the case. It’s unclear what possible role famotidine may have in the treatment of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Bright’s lawyers said Thursday they were planning to file a federal whistleblower complaint, alleging he was reassigned to a lesser job in his department because he questioned Trump’s promotion of hydroxychloroquine.</p>
<p>“In our filing we will make clear that Dr. Bright was sidelined for one reason only — because he resisted efforts to provide unfettered access to potentially dangerous drugs, including chloroquine, a drug promoted by the administration as a panacea, but which is untested and possibly deadly when used improperly,” Bright’s lawyers, Debra Katz and Lisa J. Banks, said in a statement.</p>
<p>They accused the adminstration of “making demonstrably false statements about Dr. Bright, one of the nation’s leading vaccine, drug and diagnostic experts, to deflect attention from its retaliatory removal of him as the director” of the research agency.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately answer questions about possible links between the contract and Bright’s dismissal.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Administration officials have denied that Bright, who has a PhD in immunology, was removed over a dispute about hydroxychloroquine, saying instead that he had requested that the Food and Drug Administration grant special permission for Health and Human Services to acquire stocks of the drug.</p>
<p>“It was Dr. Bright who requested an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for donations of chloroquine that Bayer and Sandoz recently made to the Strategic National Stockpile for use on COVID-19 patients,” the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement.</p>
<p>But the person familiar with Bright’s role said he had agreed to seek the emergency-use authorization as “a compromise” with senior officials pressing for wider use of the drug, including by patients not being treated in hospitals for COVID-19.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Bright said in a statement that he was reassigned for insisting that “the billions of dollars allocated by Congress to address the COVID-19 pandemic” be invested “into safe and scientifically vetted solutions, and not in drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit.”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“Rushing blindly towards unproven drugs can be disastrous and result in countless more deaths,” he added. The statement was first reported by the New York Times.</p>
<p>As the number of coronavirus cases rose in February and March, Trump touted hydroxychloroquine and its close relative chloroquine repeatedly, at one point calling them potentially “the biggest game-changers in the history of medicine.”</p>
<p>In recent days, as more negative results about hydroxychloroquine have become public, Trump has toned down his promotion of it.</p>
<p>Researchers from the Columbia VA Health Care System in South Carolina and the University of Virginia School of Medicine reported earlier this week that in 368 hospitalized COVID-19 patients treated with a range of medicines, hydroxychloroquine failed to reduce patients’ need for mechanical ventilation to assist with breathing.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>They also found that in some cases, the drug was linked to higher rates of death, especially when administered without the antibiotic azithromycin, according to a copy of the study posted Thursday to the research site MedRxiv.</p>
<p>Of the 368 patients, all of them male, the 97 who got hydroxychloroquine alone were almost 2½ times more likely to die than those who got neither drug. The 113 who got hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were roughly twice as likely to die as the 158 patients who got neither drug.</p>
<p>The “retrospective analysis” of COVID-19 patients treated within the VA system was hastily conducted after the Food and Drug Administration waived its usual evaluation process and allowed the drug’s use as treatment for a disease without first evaluating its safety and effectiveness. It was only the second time in its history that the agency has done so.</p>
<p>Alchem Laboratories, the firm conducting the study funded by the Department of Health and Human Services, is located in the north-central Florida city of Alachua, near Gainesville.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The firm appears to have gotten into the hydroxychloroquine business in January 2018, when the Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity awarded it a contract “to procure, synthesize, or purify potential antimalarial drug candidates” for the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.</p>
<p>The contract was just one of $10.6 million in federal contracts that Alchem won in early 2018, mainly with the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>The company described itself at that time as a “contract manufacturing organization” and appeared largely to manufacture “experimental therapeutics” for use in clinical trials.</p>
<p>Later in 2018, the firm appears to have moved aggressively into doing more clinical trials.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The current agreement between the firm and the government calls for it to “rapidly implement a multi-site, randomized, double-blind, multi-arm historical control, comparative trial of the safety and efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine and the combination of Hydroxychloroquine and Famotidine for the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19 disease in hospitalized adults.”</p>
<p>James D. Talton, the company’s president and chief executive officer, hung up abruptly when contacted Thursday by The Times. “I cannot speak to you, I’m sorry,” he said.</p>
