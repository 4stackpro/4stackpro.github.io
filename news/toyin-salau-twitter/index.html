TALLAHASSEE — In the hours before Oluwatoyin Salau went missing, she tweeted she had just been sexually assaulted.</p>
<p>Salau, a 19-year-old Black Lives Matter protester, was last seen June 6 in Tallahassee, according to the Tallahassee Police Department. Police and her fellow demonstrators are still searching for her.</p>
<p>The afternoon she went missing, Salau tweeted a man molested her that morning. She said the man offered to give her a ride back to a church where she had sought &ldquo;refuge&rdquo; because of &ldquo;unjust living conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came disguised as a man of God and ended up picking me up from nearby Saxon Street,&rdquo; she tweeted. &ldquo;I trusted the holy spirit to keep me safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salau said she called police after the assault happened. She did not specify the church where she had been staying.</p>
<p>Several people replied to her on Twitter offering help and asking whether she was OK. She never responded and hasn&rsquo;t tweeted since.</p>
<p>The Tallahassee Community Action Agency conducted a search party Wednesday night. The demonstrators searched for hours. They carried flashlights and asked for medics to join them in case she was hurt.</p>
<p>TCAC has started a social media campaign sharing &ldquo;Have you seen me?&rdquo; fliers and photos of Salau.</p>
<p>Jesula Jeannot, a 21-year-old protest organizer, said she had gotten to know Salau through protests and hasn&rsquo;t seen her for almost a week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m shaking,&rdquo; she said when she heard of her new friend&rsquo;s disappearance.</p>
<p>Salau spoke at recent protests and carried signs pleading for justice in the wake of black lives lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want their names gone in vain,&rdquo; the local activist said.</p>
<p>Salau was possibly wearing white Crocs, black shorts and a black top at the time she went missing.</p>
<p>TPD&rsquo;s Special Victims Unit is investigating.</p>

<p><img src="https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Oluwatoyin-Salau.jpg?quality=65&amp;strip=all&amp;w=780" alt="img">
Oluwatoyin Salau was a Black Lives Matter protester who vanished in Tallahassee, Florida. For days, there was a police and community effort underway to find her after she disappeared hours after leaving a series of disturbing tweets. Salau was found dead in an double homicide Saturday night, June 15, along with another woman, the Tallahassee Police Department said Monday in a press release.</p>
<p>According to Tallahassee Police, Salau was found dead in the 2100 block of Monday Road along with 75-year-old Victoria Sims. Vicki Sims was an AARP volunteer who had also been reported missing. A suspect, 49-year-old Aaron Glee Jr., has been taken into custody, police said in the press release. Authorities have not released any other information about the double homicide investigation. “The 19-year-old (Salau) and 75-year-old (Sims) met after recent protests over justice for black lives,” Tallahassee.com reported. Sims was active in Democratic politics.</p>
<p>“Toyin was very passionate,” her friend Danaya Hemphill said, according to CBS News. “She was very vocal she was very loving, very spiritual, very caring. Toyin she was like a light in a dark room. That was Toyin.”</p>
<p>The suspect has two recent battery cases involving other victims. You can learn more about his background here.</p>
<p>“Silence is the best weapon for some but not for me I will not be silenced,” Salau wrote recently on her Twitter page, which she filled with comments about race and social justice. Salau’s disappearance sparked a great deal of emotion on social media, where many question why the media haven’t covered her case more widely, and some criticized police for, in their view, not doing more considering the number of details Salau herself posted on Twitter about what she said was a sexual assault right before she vanished.</p>

<p>Salau, who was a speaker at Black Lives Matter protests after the death of George Floyd, disappeared on June 6.</p>
<p>On June 14, a woman who goes by Ashley on Twitter and who indicated she was helping Salau’s mother, wrote, “I’m sorry to inform everyone about this but Toyin is no longer with us.” On June 11, the same woman wrote on Twitter, “She’s been missing since last Friday since she left me and my friends. Last time she was last sighted was at the BL Perry Library on Saturday then after that we haven’t seen her. If you know any info please contact me because I’m helping her mom. She’s somewhere on the south side.” Heavy has also reached out to Ashley for more information.</p>
<p>Another woman claimed on a True Crime Group, “The family messaged in the group chat thanking everyone for their help and letting everyone know that she was no longer with us, and asking for people to give them time and not mention it on social media. Some friends who weren’t part of the search group started posting about it…there are no firm answers.”</p>

<p>Before her body was found, Tallahassee Police classified Salau as a “missing adult,” giving her name as Oluwatoyin “Toyin” Salau.</p>
<p>A missing person’s poster released by police stated she was 19 years old, 5 feet, 7 inches tall, weighs 120 pounds and has black hair and brown eyes.</p>
<p>“The Tallahassee Police Department’s Special Victims Unit is seeking information on the location of Oluwatoyin ‘Toyin’ Salau,” the post says. “Salau was last seen on June 6, 2020, in the area of Orange Avenue and Wahnish Way in Tallahassee.

<p>AARP Florida deeply regrets the death of Vicki Sims, a long-time AARP volunteer. We understand that the @TallyPD is pursuing an investigation into her death. Few details are available at this time. 1/5 pic.twitter.com/9oxEjIMAo2 — AARP Tallahassee (@AARPTally) June 15, 2020</p>
<p>Vicki Sims had last been seen on June 11. She volunteered with the Tallahassee AARP chapter, the organization said in a press release.</p>
<p>The Tallahassee AARP said about Sims, “Vicki worked tirelessly to improve the lives of others – as a dedicated advocate for older Americans; a committed volunteer for AARP, Second Harvest Food Bank of the Big Bend and other community causes; a devoted mother and grandmother; and a passionate, fully engaged citizen, helping our nation to achieve its highest ideals.”</p>

<li>Salau Wrote a Series of Disturbing Tweets the Afternoon She Went Missing</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyways I was molested in Tallahassee, Florida by a black man this morning at 5:30 on Richview and Park Ave. The man offered to give me a ride to find someplace to sleep and recollect my belongings from a church I refuged to a couple days back to escape unjust living conditions. — Oluwatoyin (@virgingrltoyin) June 6, 2020</p>
<p>On June 6, 2020, on her Twitter page, just hours before she disappeared, Salau wrote a series of disturbing tweets. “Anyways I was molested in Tallahassee, Florida by a black man this morning at 5:30 on Richview and Park Ave. The man offered to give me a ride to find someplace to sleep and recollect my belongings from a church I refuged to a couple days back to escape unjust living conditions,” she wrote.</p>
<p>She continued:</p>
<p>He came disguised as a man of God and ended up picking me up from nearby Saxon Street. I entered his truck only because I carry anything to defend myself not even a phone (which is currently at the church) and I have poor vision. I trusted the holy spirit to keep me safe. When we arrived at his house he offered me a shower and I thanked him and shower and he gave me a change of clothes. He exposed himself to me by peeing with the bathroom open obviously knowing I was out of it. I told him about a sexual assault situation that happened…</p>
<p>rest in power oluwatoyin salau 🤍</p>
<p>BLACK WOMEN DESERVE SO MUCH MORE. SHOW UP, FIGHT FOR, AND PROTECT ALL BLACK WOMEN WHILE THEY ARE STILL HERE!!! #SayHerName pic.twitter.com/azdIfxOgpG — girl w tha butter coochie (@monetbadue) June 15, 2020</p>
<p>Salau described an alleged sexual assault by another man who she said, back in March, “tried to force me to give him oral sex and then continued to harrass (sic) me thru text and knocking at my door for days.” She wrote that she is 19 and that man was 32.</p>
<p>She continued:</p>
<p>Going back to the situation that happened to me this morning, I did not fall asleep. He then asked me if I wanted a massage at this moment his roommate who was in the house was asleep. I was laying on my stomach trying to calm myself down from severe ptsd. He started touching me back and rubbing my body using my body until he climaxed and then went to sleep. Before I realized what happened to me I looked over and his clothes were completely off. Once I saw he was asleep I escaped from the house and started walking from Richview Road to anywhere else. All of my belongings my phone my clothes shoes are all assumably at the church where I’ve been trying to track since I sought spiritual guidance/ refuge. I will not be silent. Literally wearing this man’s clothes right now DNA all over me because I couldn’t locate his house the moment I called the police because I couldn’t see.</p>
<p>She added: “Mid 40’s lives in a gray painted duplex apartment style house drives a white clean Silverado Chevrolet truck.”</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Salau Wrote About Race, Police &amp; Other Issues in Society on Social Media</li>
</ol>
<p>Salau filled her Twitter page with comments about race, police and other issues affecting society. “What do white people b tryna escape,” read one recent post. According to Tallahassee.com, Salau was affiliated with Movement 850, which describes itself as “student leaders and community residents working together to demand justice and policy change” relating to Tallahassee police.</p>
<p>“The media loves to censor black pain for a groundbreaking story there is no middle ground… keep reporting and fact checking stay on y’all toes,” read another. Other posts:</p>
<p>“Abeg stop using Black as an umbrella term African Americans are being targeted you people want to say Black but when its any other ethnicity you’ll list the whole al pha bet.”</p>
<p>“White suprecrazy.”</p>
<p>“In this dim ass social age Black could mean anything your fav white celebs get called black and for marrying African Americans will you shut up your mouth.”</p>
<p>“it’s so funny how white ppl use reverse psychology for every conflict and it’s not even that effective.”</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Citizens Were Out Searching for Salau, Who Was a Speaker at Black Lives Matter Protests</li>
</ol>
<p>TCAC — Tallahassee Community Action Committee — organized search parties for Salau. “We’re still at Bethel AME Church (On Orange Ave. and Wahnish Way) forming search teams, it’s not too late to join us!” the organization wrote with one post on its Facebook page.</p>
<p>Jesula Jeannot, a 21-year-old protest organizer who knew Salau through protests, told the Tallahassee Democrat, “I’m shaking.”</p>
<p>The newspaper reported that Salau “spoke at recent protests and carried signs pleading for justice in the wake of black lives lost.”</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>A Relief Fund Was Established for Salau, but the GoFundMe Has Been Suspended Amid Questions About Its Legitimacy</li>
</ol>
<p>19 year old OLUWATOYIN SALAU IS MISSING</p>
<p>last seen in Tallahassee FL</p>
<p>She also has poor eyesight &amp; is without her glasses https://t.co/N7hzA1wqyX pic.twitter.com/ITyeuL7X8r — dumebi, i think¿ (@True_Igwe) June 11, 2020</p>
<p>A “relief fund” on GoFundMe for Salau has raised more than $10,000. The fund was created by someone claiming to be a family friend, but the fund stopped taking donations on Monday.</p>
<p>“Oluwatoyin ‘Toyin’ Salau is an activist in the Tallahassee community who was reported as a Missing Persons by family after disappearing on June 6th, 2020,” the page reads. It continues:</p>
<p>Toyin was last seen in the southside of Tallahassee near the intersection of Orange Ave. and Wahnish Way. Toyin’s current condition is unknown, and she may be at risk – this fund exists as an outlet to pool together financial assistance for her when she is found or when contact is established. The funds gathered will be allocated directly to Toyin to be used at her discretion for resources she may need to feel safe, secure, and supported when she is found, and to assist financially in her healing process. Please support Tallahassee organizers, and the friends and family of Toyin in the effort to provide mutual aid to an integral member of our community.</p>
<p>The page continued, “For the sake of transparency, we want to let you all know that Trish Brown, the main organizer of this campaign, is a family friend of Toyin’s and was in communication with Toyin before she went missing. Trish will be the main facilitator in transferring funds directly to Toyin once contact with her is established. We are also in contact with a group of Toyin’s close friends who are also helping to raise money.”</p>
<p>But some of Salau’s friends have called the GoFundMe into question and are asking that donations not be made to it. The fund was no longer accepting donations as of the morning of June 15, but it was not immediately clear what would happen to the money already donated.</p>
<p>One friend wrote on Twitter, “DO NOT DONATE TO THIS GO FUND ME!! Trish is a liar &amp; most definitely is not a friend of the family. TOYIN DID NOT TRUST HER AT ALL. TOYIN WAS LAST WITH MY FRIENDS &amp; I. She left while we protesting.”</p>
<p>The friend added, “Trish say there &amp; made a big deal about Toyin phone being missing &amp; whole time it was in the back of her red truck! She lied &amp; said she’s been in contact with Toyin up until she went missing but HOW when Toyin didn’t have her phone?”</p>
<p>Another friend tweeted, “Her mom nor her family members can be trusted! I’ve known Toyin since she was 14 years old and her mom allowed her to be beat on by her family members! Nobody wanted to help her, only to hurt her! Her dad abused her as well!” Her friends say that her parents kicked her out in the middle of a pandemic, which led to her being homeless.</p>

<p>Após seu desaparecimento, a ativista afiliada ao movimento Black Lives Matter em Tallahassee, Oluwatoyin &ldquo;Toyin&rdquo; Salau, foi encontrada morta na Flórida, EUA. Segundo a família da jovem de 19 anos &ldquo;ela não está mais entre nós&rdquo;, escreveu uma familiar no Twitter.</p>
<p>De acordo com a CBS News, o corpo de Salau foi descoberto em Tallahassee na noite de sábado (13), informou a polícia em um comunicado enviado nesta segunda-feira (15). O corpo de outra mulher, Victoria Sims, 75, também foi encontrado, informou a polícia.</p>
<p>Oluwatoyin desapareceu em 6 de junho, poucas horas depois de fazer uma séries de twittes sobre um homem que a agrediu sexualmente depois de se disfarçar de &ldquo;um homem de Deus&rdquo; que ela pensava estar tentando ajudá-la.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fui molestada em Tallahassee, Flórida, por um homem negro às 5:30 da manhã em Richview e Park Ave.&quot;, twittou Salau. A ativista ainda disse que o suspeito dirigia uma caminhonete branca do modelo Chevrolet Silverado e ofereceu carona até uma igreja próxima, onde ela havia deixado vários de seus pertences.</p>
<p>Ela continuou dizendo que o homem a levou para sua casa, se expôs a ela e começou a tocá-la sem o seu consentimento. Salau compartilhou que foi a segunda vez este ano que ela foi agredida sexualmente.</p>

<p>Danaya Hemphill, amiga de Salau, disse ao The Democrat que viu a amiga pela última vez um dia antes dela desaparecer e &ldquo;tinha a sensação de que não encontraríamos Toyin [como a jovem era conhecida pelo amigos] viva&rdquo;. Ela pensou na ativista como &ldquo;uma luz em um quarto escuro&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Ainda de acordo com a CBS News, um homem de 49 anos foi preso hoje. Em comunicado, a polícia não forneceu outros detalhes sobre o caso nem explicou qualquer relação entre as duas vítimas encontradas mortas e o homem apreendido.</p>
<p>Salau participou ativamente das manifestações do Black Lives Matter em prol das pessoas mortas pela polícia, incluindo Tony McDade, de Tallahassee, e George Floyd, de Minneapolis. Ela era uma ativista que apareceu em vários vídeos dos protestos na capital do estado. Seu nome e #JusticeForToyin foram Trendic Topics do Twitter nesta segunda-feira.

<p>On Sunday night, the 19-year old Tallahassee activist Oluwatoyin “Toyin” Salau, who went missing on June 6 after sharing a wrenching Twitter thread about her sexual assault, was found dead. The loss of Salau has burnished conversations about the ways black women, especially dark-skinned black women, are abused, discarded, and ultimately lost. Her death makes clear not just the danger of home instability and misogyny, but the fact that what’s on the line with this current uprising against anti-black racism is black life itself. Salau’s death is tragic news compounded in a time marked by great horror (the continuous loss of life and reshaping of our culture by COVID-19) and beauty (the swell of protests across the globe, including the mammoth crowd outside Brooklyn Museum yesterday in support of an action for black trans lives). Every day I wake to news that leaves me both emboldened by my anger over the present conditions of black life and heartbroken as a black woman.</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s why Insecure feels like such a balm. The HBO series, which closed out its fourth season Sunday evening, lingers on the joys of blackness, giving us a succor that is often missing in depictions of black life. There’s something moving about being able to escape into a vibrant series populated by beautiful and beautifully rendered black and brown folks that allows them to just be. The problems these characters are mired in lack the urgency and heartbreak of the current state of the world, for which I am thankful. It’s the kind of show you slip into like a warm bath, as its aesthetic, narrative, and sonic prowess work to create a series that is wildly engaging even when it frustrates occasionally.</p>
<p>This season felt more mature than its predecessors, adding a heaviness to its typically gossamer-light proceedings through its exploration of the love stories at its center, especially the friendship between Issa (co-creator and star Issa Rae) and Molly (Yvonne Orji). Insecure has never been a wholly perfect series — it’s touched by a classism that can be frustrating and the finale has a markedly odd moment with cops — but season four felt like solace, bristling with mature storytelling and beguiling aesthetic dimensions. Even in an uneven finale that doubled down on the show’s worst impulses, there’s enough wondrous about the series, particularly in its aesthetic beauty, to keep me intrigued.</p>
<p>Insecure’s greatest strength since its very beginning has been the vibrant aesthetic and sonic dimensions that are essential to its portrayal of black life. The style set by director and producer Melina Matsoukas is charmingly easygoing, colorful, and rich. Actors are lit with a care that demonstrates the beauty of a wide variety of black skin tones. Characters are dressed gorgeously. The music this season by artists like Rico Nasty, Raphael Saadiq, and Jucee Froot did more than set a mood; it added to the lyrical splendor of the series, evocatively creating a warm hangout vibe. Some gambits in aesthetic experimentation didn’t quite work: When the season first started, I was cool on how the series played with time to tease out Issa’s block party, which proved to be a turning point in her life both professionally and personally. Yet one of the season’s most intriguing threads was wholly visual: a motif in which two characters are separated within the frame and look at one another head on, communicating the distance between them. We see this yet again in the finale between Nathan (Kendrick Sampson) and Issa, as she visits him in the space that will become his own barbershop. Each of them reflected in a different mirror and holding each other’s gaze is ripe with meaning. This season, the grace of Insecure’s aesthetics finally matched the maturity of its storytelling.</p>
<p>This was never more true than when the show turned to its beating heart, Molly and Issa’s friendship. What has been intriguing to me is how, even in the beginning, the fissures between them were evident. In many ways, Issa and Molly have always been dramatically different people, but their fight at the block party was a turning point in which their finally long-held issues boiled to the surface. That was tragic, but not surprising. While I have a lot of tender feelings toward Molly, she’s often stubborn and unable to see her own selfishness and issues despite pointing them out effortlessly in others. Issa isn’t perfect either. How couldn’t she see Molly was growing distant? How didn’t she realize Molly would feel betrayed by her asking Andrew (Alexander Hodge) to book Vince Staples for her block party? Watching the split in their friendship was both emotionally poignant and evocative, bringing up memories of my own fraught platonic relationships with women. Yet even as Insecure handled such a knotty, ambitious narrative about a withering friendship, it retained its light, airy touch and an interest in the pleasure principle — visuals of the show feel ripe enough to eat — that allowed it to still work as a salve, an escape, a balm.</p>
<p>What followed after Molly and Issa’s argument at the block party was silence, then an awkward, hollow attempt at reconciliation engendered by Issa reaching out. Molly seemed incapable of meeting Issa halfway, as Andrew suggested. She can only see relationships in terms of who has the power and control, rather than an even playing field of mutual care. Their friendship was further harmed when Issa, during an impromptu night with Molly, Andrew, and Nathan, got an accidental text from Molly: “See? I’m trying with her.” This opened the two up to at least be somewhat honest with each other, as Molly noted that perhaps they no longer fit together. I ultimately see this as the truth: These characters are no longer compatible as friends and perhaps they never were. Their relationship has often felt defined by convenience and a history together rather than a wholly healthy love. While I expect the show to work toward bringing them together next season, what has most interested me in this story line is how it speaks to the fact that some people are only in our lives for a specific period of time. There is heartbreak in such a loss, even if it feels right.</p>
<p>And what about an old relationship reborn anew? The dynamic between Issa and Lawrence this season initially had me very wary. The two tentatively navigated around one another as they shared Condola (Christina Elmore), who had grown into a friendship with Issa as they worked on the block party only for it to be revealed that she was seeing Lawrence. This nascent friendship between Issa and Lawrence, buoyed by their long history, bloomed into something full of pluratities and potency in episode eight, “Lowkey Happy,” when they met up for something that was evident from its swooning romanticism to be a date. There was something especially moving about slipping into a world where former lovers could reconnect, where people could grow, where change could be made. It was easy to get lost within the simple beauty of their coming together. I’ll be honest, I have never seen it for Lawrence. But “Lowkey Happy” acted as a good argument for why he and Issa have a bond in the first place and may be right for each other more than ever because they’ve grown. (Although, has Lawrence really grown, or did he just get a shape up and a job?)</p>
<p>In many ways, the writers — including showrunner Prentice Penny, Natasha Rothwell, Issa Rae herself, and their collaborators — did some of their most elegant work this season, braiding together threads about the limits of desire, hustling for professional success in the face of possible failure, and navigating interpersonal bonds with aplomb. It felt as if the show was building toward a defining moment that would shape our understanding of the story and where these characters were set to go in the future. Questions swirled in my mind. Would Issa be forced to choose between life in Los Angeles and her rekindled romance, if Lawrence got the job in San Francisco? How would Molly and Issa’s lives look in the face of the fracturing of their friendship? Would Andrew and Molly survive, given the issues between them she didn’t seem to notice? Amid such emotional bramble, the show remained a blissful escape. It wasn’t just the glamorous rush of the aesthetics, but the writing too that allowed space for the beauty of black life.</p>
<p>That defining moment didn’t arrive in the season finale, or at least not in the form I expected. A third of the episode “Lowkey Lost” was spent searching for Tiffany (Amanda Seales), the bougie mutual friend of Issa, Molly, and Kelli (Rothwell) who is mired in postpartum depression and decides to escape her life momentarily. Exploring the way black women navigate postpartum depression and the weight of motherhood is a potentially powerful story. But this story line, while hinted at earlier in the season, unfortunately lacks enough actorly finesse and narrative development to hit home. We aren’t really privy to much of the marriage between Tiffany and Derek (Wade Allain-Marcus), which makes their reconciliation hollow. Did this really make sense as such a large focus of the finale, considering how thinly constructed their relationship happens to be? The frantic search for Tiffany did allow for some awkward moments with Molly and Issa, which demonstrated the ocean of tangled emotions between them, but even that felt less important than other developments. When Issa and Molly finally meet up in an Ethiopian restaurant to hash things out — perhaps to end the season on a softer note among all the attending chaos — we’re not privy to their conversation, but the mood suggests a sense of them coming together. Whether they actually reconnect or decide their friendship no longer serves them is left to be answered next season.</p>
<p>But by far, the great work done this season was most undercut by the revelation that Condola is pregnant with Lawrence’s child and has decided to keep the baby. This decision turns the writing away from its knotty complexity. Where to start? I will say the way this revelation is handled aesthetically is masterful. As the editing cuts between Condola’s revelation to Lawrence and Issa finding out the next day, the tension mounts. All actors involved are giving it their level best, but they can’t surmount how cheap and obvious this narrative turn feels. Even the grandeur of the cinematography and soundtrack aren’t enough to distract from how pedestrian this narrative turn happens to be.</p>
<p>Twitter was bubbling with theories that Condola kept blowing up Lawrence’s phone episodes earlier because she was pregnant. I didn’t want to believe Insecure would make such an obvious soap operatic turn, but here we are. Why is the show, like many others, so afraid to even mention the word abortion? Why would Condola decide to keep a child with a man with whom she had a brief relationship and who doesn’t want anything to do with it? The show gestures to Condola’s emotions, as she notes she didn’t want to have a child when she was married, but feels ready now. Unfortunately, this decision doesn’t track with how the character was previously framed throughout the season. It’s the kind of narrative turn predicated on setting Twitter aflame rather than engendering intriguing, rich, properly built storytelling. This twist didn’t wholly undo the show, of course. Season four was still engaging and worthwhile, even if Condola’s pregnancy now portends a question — can Lawrence and Issa survive in the face of such a radical, life-altering shift? — that I don’t think is as rich as what has come before. It’s a messy situation, but one I will definitely continue watching if only to escape from the mounting heartbreak of everyday black life in order to be reminded of its beauty.

<p>Salau, a 19-year-old Black Lives Matters protester, was last seen June 6 near Wahnish Way and Orange Avenue, according to the Tallahassee Police Department. Police and her fellow demonstrators are still searching for her.</p>
<p>The afternoon she went missing, Salau tweeted a man molested her that morning around Park Avenue and Richview Road. She said the man offered to give her a ride back to a church where she had sought &ldquo;refuge&rdquo; because of &ldquo;unjust living conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came disguised as a man of God and ended up picking me up from nearby Saxon Street,&rdquo; she tweeted. &ldquo;I trusted the holy spirit to keep me safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Salau said she called police after the assault happened. She did not specify the church where she had been staying.</p>
<p>Several people replied to her on Twitter offering help and asking whether she was OK. She never responded and hasn&rsquo;t tweeted since.</p>
