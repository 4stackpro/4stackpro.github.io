London (CNN) It&rsquo;s not just toilet roll that people are panic buying. Some illegal drug users are reportedly stockpiling their substance of choice as restrictions intended to stop the spread of coronavirus disrupt the international supply chain.</p>
<p>And the consequences could be devastating, with experts concerned that people will adopt riskier habits, substitute unfamiliar drugs or enter withdrawal, which can be dangerous if unmanaged. Since heavy users often have other health problems, this could mean increased strain on services that are already near breaking point.</p>
<p>UK drug policy and crime experts told CNN they were worried over a growing number of reports of shortages and escalating prices for drugs, as international borders close and supply lines are cut off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are reports coming through of people stockpiling their favorite drug or their drug of choice, and of course, that just creates a shortage, which has inevitably led to price increases,&rdquo; Ian Hamilton, senior lecturer in addiction and mental health at the University of York, told CNN. He said he expected to see heroin &ldquo;disappearing very, very quickly&rdquo; in the UK.</p>
<p>Steve Rolles, senior policy analyst at the Transform Drug Policy Foundation, told CNN there was &ldquo;anecdotal evidence of price rises&hellip; and that doesn&rsquo;t seem surprising.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem likely that the supply of drugs that these people are using, in particular heroin, is going to be restricted &hellip; it&rsquo;s going to be more challenging to move drugs around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As weeks stretch into months, I think we&rsquo;re likely to see a drought, a heroin drought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alex Stevens, criminal justice professor at the University of Kent, told CNN that in areas including Birmingham and Bristol, users of heroin and synthetic cannabinoids &ldquo;are reporting that they&rsquo;re getting less in a £10 ($12) bag than they would have done four or five weeks ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this is an industry that operates on supply and demand. The dark web and sites including Craigslist are still active, with many users buying drugs through the mail at a time when police are not focused on monitoring post, according to several experts. &ldquo;If the heroin isn&rsquo;t available they will probably find another route, whether it&rsquo;s alcohol or inhalants, or benzodiazepines or something else,&rdquo; said Rolles.</p>
<p>Rolles has even heard reports of dealers dressing in nurse&rsquo;s uniforms and supermarket uniforms to make deliveries unnoticed.</p>
<p>What happens during a drought</p>
<p>When the UK last experienced a heroin drought in 2010-11, the drug&rsquo;s purity at &ldquo;local dealer level&rdquo; fell to 18%, according to the National Crime Agency. Street prices reportedly increased, and there was a reduction in the number of deaths involving heroin and a simultaneous (but smaller) increase in deaths involving methadone.</p>
<p>That may sound positive, but the experts say the effects could be different this time. Users may move from less dangerous drug-taking methods to injecting. They may use lethal combinations of drugs. They may use too much of their stockpile. And they may be more likely to overdose alone because of social distancing.</p>
<p>One vital difference between 2010 and 2020 that is causing anxiety among the experts is the proliferation of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that is up to 50 times stronger than heroin and can therefore be transported in much smaller quantities. The drug has not yet become widespread in countries including Britain, but is wreaking havoc in the United States.</p>
<p>Fentanyl is the drug most often involved in overdoses in the US, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. The rate of overdoses involving the opioid skyrocketed by about 113% each year from 2013 through 2016. If you&rsquo;re used to heroin and you take fentanyl, &ldquo;the risk of overdose is extreme,&rdquo; said Hamilton.</p>
<p>The drug is often manufactured in China, but little is moving out of the original coronavirus epicenter. It is also manufactured in Mexico and possibly Eastern Europe</p>
<p>With many drug users dealing with mental health issues such as depression and anxiety, coronavirus isolation presents an unprecedented challenge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People who have an active disorder, addiction disorder, they&rsquo;re going to look for ways to get a drug,&rdquo; Cynthia Moreno Tuohy, executive director at NAADAC in the US (National Association for Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors), told CNN.</p>
<p>Asking for help The suicide rate in the United States has seen sharp increases in recent years. Studies have shown that the risk of suicide declines sharply when people call the national suicide hotline: 1-800-273-TALK. There is also a crisis text line. For crisis support in Spanish, call 1-888-628-9454. The lines are staffed by a mix of paid professionals and unpaid volunteers trained in crisis and suicide intervention. The confidential environment, the 24-hour accessibility, a caller&rsquo;s ability to hang up at any time and the person-centered care have helped its success, advocates say.</p>
<p>The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide also provide contact information for crisis centers around the world.</p>
<p>Tuohy expects more &ldquo;poly-use&rdquo; of readily available marijuana and alcohol , which is already seeing increased consumption worldwide.</p>
<p>It takes longer to build up data on illegal drug consumption, but analysts are watching closely.</p>
<p>Federal confidentiality laws in the US have been relaxed to allow people to access counseling and peer support faster. NAADAC is offering telehealth training, and resources to help clients find services available in their state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever there&rsquo;s a natural disaster, we know that relapse goes up, because of anxiety, the fear of the unknown,&rdquo; said Tuohy. &ldquo;Now we have an ongoing, natural disaster, if you will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The longer a crisis goes on, the less hope that people see &hellip; it doesn&rsquo;t feel like there&rsquo;s going to be a light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long term, we&rsquo;re likely to see suicide go up as a result of depression. So I know that the suicide centers are gearing up and the suicide hotlines already are taking calls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A vulnerable population</p>
<p>Any disruption to the illicit drug supply will have the biggest effect on the most vulnerable populations. Heavy drug users are more likely to live with multiple people, have respiratory or other health issues or be homeless &ndash; and are therefore more at risk of contracting Covid-19.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are in a double tier of vulnerability in that they&rsquo;re more likely to get the virus and they&rsquo;re more likely to be affected negatively by it,&rdquo; said Rolles. &ldquo;So there&rsquo;s a big responsibility, I think, on society to look after and protect those populations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If that doesn&rsquo;t happen, hospitals and treatment facilities will face a huge additional strain, he warns.</p>
<p>Governments are conscious of the risks. The UK government has asked local authorities to house all homeless people. Low risk and pregnant prisoners are being released across the world</p>
<p>Facilities in the US UK and Canada are allowing stable users to pick up supplies of addiction treatment medications like methadone and buprenorphine once a week or every two weeks instead of daily, but this also presents risks.</p>
<p>Mat Southwell, a drug user and global advocate from Bath in southwest England, told CNN he was delivering a methadone prescription to a woman who cannot pick it up for herself, is suicidal and self harms. She had gone three days without it.</p>
<p>Will Haydock, from Public Health Dorset also in southwest England, told CNN that UK clinics were seeing an increase in people accessing treatment. He said this was encouraging but warned that for providers already making &ldquo;significant changes to service design&rdquo; this was adding to pressure. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a real challenge to deal with that influx of people who want support,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a particularly vulnerable group of people, and you&rsquo;re looking at services that are already really stretched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re not able to offer the kind of level of support that we would like to, we will see more people die earlier than they need to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the UK&rsquo;s Home Office told CNN it is &ldquo;monitoring the impacts of coronavirus&rdquo; and law enforcement are &ldquo;continuing to prevent drug trafficking and are successfully disrupting the drugs supply within the UK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The world was already facing a drug crisis before the coronavirus pandemic. The US is in the throes of an opioid epidemic . An estimated 10.3 million Americans ages 12 and older misused opioids in 2018. In 2017, there were more than 70,200 overdose deaths in the US and 47,600 of those deaths involved opioids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very apprehensive about what&rsquo;s happening right now and what&rsquo;s going to happen over the next few weeks to this group of our society who are extremely vulnerable, who&rsquo;ve been exposed to adverse experiences, neglect and abuse from childhood onwards, and now risk being put at the back of the queue for support when in fact, they should be in front of it,&rdquo; said Stevens, from the University of Kent.</p>
<p>The coming weeks and months will be crucial in identifying the effects of coronavirus on illegal drug use &ndash; and what it means for all of us.

<h3 id="map-where-coronavirus-treatments-and-vaccines-are-being-tested-on-patients-in-the-us">MAP: Where coronavirus treatments and vaccines are being tested on patients in the US</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.insider.com/5e87761f92e8ba47a444ad67?width=1200&amp;format=jpeg" alt="img">
Researchers are testing a wide range of experimental treatments against the novel coronavirus, with clinical trials now happening across the US.</p>
<p>Business Insider analyzed a federal database of studies to see where most of these trials are happening across the US.</p>
<p>New York state leads the way with 11 trial listings.</p>
<p>Fourteen states do not have any listed COVID-19 studies for treatments or vaccines. That includes Indiana and Nevada, which are both states with more than 1,000 confirmed cases.</p>
<p>Visit Business Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>Research activity has ramped up in the US against COVID-19, with dozens of clinical trials underway or starting soon testing a range of potential treatment options.</p>
<p>An analysis of a federal database by Business Insider found a wide range of research activity varying by state. New York leads the nation with 11 coronavirus trials in the state.</p>
<p>Many trials are recruiting patients across the country, such as a study led by the National Institutes of Health to test remdesivir, an antiviral. That trial, for instance, is recruiting patients in more than a dozen states.</p>
<p>But 14 states still have no listed coronavirus trials, even as the virus has spread across the nation. Indiana and Nevada both have more than 1,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases but no clinical trials in their states to test experimental treatments.</p>
<p>The most widespread treatments being tested include the antiviral remdesivir, developed by Gilead Sciences, the anti-malaria pill hydroxychloroquine, and Kevzara, an anti-inflammatory arthritis drug developed by Sanofi and Regeneron.</p>

<p>The first US coronavirus vaccine trial is also underway, testing healthy volunteers in Washington state and Georgia.</p>
<p>Business Insider conducted the analysis on April 3. Additional listings are being added daily to the database, which has grown from listing 19 US-based trials a week ago on March 27 to 44 studies.</p>
<p>Read more: There are more than 40 potential coronavirus vaccines in the works. Here are the top efforts to watch, including the 8 vaccines set to be tested in people this year.</p>
<p>The analysis is limited to the timeliness of the database. Federal law requires clinical trials to be posted no later than three weeks after a study starts enrolling patients, which could mean some studies aren&rsquo;t yet included. Most researchers post a listing on the site before they start recruiting participants.</p>
<p>Additionally, Business Insider went through the listings to remove trials that were either observational, meaning they are not testing any treatment option, or mentioned COVID-19 in the listing but were not actually focused on the disease. (For example, one study in the District of Columbia focused on high blood pressure was updated to state that it was delayed due to the COVID-19 outbreak.)</p>

<h3 id="coronavirus-potential-drug-treatment-starts-uk-trials">Coronavirus: Potential drug treatment starts UK trials</h3>
<p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D3FB/production/_111376245_hi060726083.jpg" alt="img">
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Trials have begun globally of a handful of potential treatments</p>
<p>A drug that could help treat coronavirus is to be trialled on a small number of patients in England and Scotland.</p>
<p>The studies, which have been fast-tracked by the government, will initially involve 15 NHS centres.</p>
<p>In the absence of a known treatment for the virus, a handful of experimental drugs are being tested globally.</p>
<p>The drug, known as remdesivir, is manufactured by the pharmaceutical company Gilead.</p>
<p>Two studies are to be carried out in the UK - one on patients with moderate symptoms, and one on those who are in a serious condition.</p>
<p>Trials are already underway in China and the US, with the first results expected in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The UK trials will be based in England and Scotland and overseen by Dr Andrew Ustianowski, a consultant in infectious diseases.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s spent the past couple of weeks working full time helping treat COVID-19 patients and has seen first-hand how sick patients can become.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we really need, and what we really want, is a specific treatment against Coronavirus that delays the infection, treats the infection, and hopefully makes people better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think this drug is promising in the laboratory, and we&rsquo;re hopeful it will be as promising in humans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my heart I&rsquo;m hopeful, but we do need studies such as this to work out how well it works and how best to use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anti-viral drugs</p>
<p>Gilead specialises in producing anti-viral medications.</p>
<p>Hilary Hutton-Squire, the company&rsquo;s General Manager in the UK and Ireland, says the work behind this drug stretches back over ten years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For about a decade we&rsquo;ve been looking at what we call emerging viruses, looking at viruses that aren&rsquo;t a problem yet but could be in the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coronaviruses are an important category of virus because when we&rsquo;ve seen them jump from animals to humans previously they&rsquo;ve caused a lot of problems as with SARS and MERS,.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So remdesivir was a product we had looked at against SARS and MERS and seen that it had some activity, and that&rsquo;s why we thought it was really important to see if it has a role to play in treating patients with COVID-19 as quickly as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The UK regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said it was ready to prioritise and provide any assistance in response to Covid-19, in line with government priorities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have procedures for rapid scientific advice, reviews and approvals and are ready to support manufacturers, researchers and other regulators,&rdquo; said Dr Siu Ping Lam.</p>
<p>Remdesivir has been considered as a potential treatment for Ebola.</p>
<p>The drug is designed to interfere with the way a virus reproduces, thereby stopping it from multiplying inside the body.</p>
<p>With no approved therapies for coronavirus infection, hopes rest on speeding up the approval process for drugs that show promise in fighting the disease.</p>
<p>US researchers have begun a trial trial to see if the malaria drug, chloroquine, will help treat coronavirus.
