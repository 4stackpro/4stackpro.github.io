President Donald Trump addresses the daily coronavirus task force briefing in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, April 14, 2020.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump&rsquo;s first step toward pulling World Health Organization funding during the coronavirus pandemic has set the stage for another legal tug of war with House Democrats wary of him treading on their power.</p>
<p>Facing sustained backlash for his handling of the outbreak as U.S. Covid-19 cases top any other country in the world, the president on Tuesday criticized the United Nations agency for what he called its &ldquo;role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus.&rdquo; Trump said he was &ldquo;instructing [his] administration to halt funding&rdquo; to the WHO during a 60 to 90-day review period.</p>
<p>House Democrats argued that suspending funding would hamper the global response to the disease ripping across the globe. They also contended he cannot withdraw money already appropriated by Congress under its constitutional authority — suggesting a court fight over Trump&rsquo;s power looms if he pulls funding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This decision is dangerous, illegal and will be swiftly challenged,&rdquo; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement Wednesday.</p>
<p>The party also raised the specter of the White House&rsquo;s decision to withhold congressionally-approved military aid to Ukraine last year as Trump urged the country to investigate his political rival, apparent Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. The action led to the House impeaching Trump. The Senate acquitted him in February.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a desperate attempt to deflect blame, President Trump is violating the same spending laws that brought about his impeachment,&rdquo; House Appropriations Committee spokesman Evan Hollander said in a statement. &ldquo;The President does not have the unilateral authority to withhold the United States&rsquo; assessed contribution to the World Health Organization.&rdquo;

<h3 id="coronavirus-live-updates-business-executives-call-for-more-testing-trumps-who-attack-is-condemned">Coronavirus Live Updates: Business Executives Call for More Testing; Trump’s W.H.O. Attack Is Condemned</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2020/04/09/corona-virus-social-images-by-section/assets/US_promo.jpg?u=1586987480391" alt="img">
That belief has been amplified by some of the president’s top allies in Congress and the right-wing news media, who share deep suspicions about the Chinese government and were furious when W.H.O. officials said aggressive action by China was crucial to slowing the spread of the virus outside its borders.</p>
<p>The “War Room” podcast featuring Steve Bannon, the president’s former chief strategist, and Jason Miller, his former campaign communications director, called a week ago for an end to funding for the W.H.O., citing what they said was China’s delay in providing truthful information about the virus.</p>
<p>The Fox News Channel has published 49 articles about the W.H.O. on its website since mid-February, and the cable network has repeatedly featured Republican lawmakers and conservative pundits railing against the W.H.O. for being too deferential to China. Mr. Trump echoed that sentiment on Tuesday, when he announced that he would freeze nearly $500 million in funding for the organization.</p>
<p>A top W.H.O. official said in mid-February that restrictive measures adopted by China had delayed the spread of the virus to other countries, saying, “Right now, the strategic and tactical approach in China is the correct one.”</p>
<p>“It is very China-centric,” Mr. Trump told reporters during a briefing in the Rose Garden. “I told that to President Xi. I said, ‘The World Health Organization is very China-centric.’ Meaning, whatever it is, China was always right. You can’t do that. You can’t do that. Not right.”</p>
<p>Many of the president’s closest aides — including Peter Navarro, his trade adviser — and key members of the National Security Council have long been suspicious of China. Mr. Trump himself has often offered contradictory messages about the country, repeatedly complimenting President Xi Jinping even as he wages a fierce, on-again, off-again trade war.</p>
<p>On Jan. 24, about a month after the virus was discovered there, Mr. Trump tweeted: “China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency.”
