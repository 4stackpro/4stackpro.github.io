This is the moment Aston Villa captain Jack Grealish makes a hasty exit from an estate in the suburbs of Birmingham moments before police arrive to the scene of a car crash.</p>
<p>In these new images Grealish, 24, is seen leaving Dickens Heath, close to a luxury flat owned by former team-mate Ross McCormack, with an unzipped backpack and the sky-blue hoodie he was pictured wearing in images circulating online on Sunday.</p>
<p>A witness told MailOnline: &lsquo;They went to collect their possessions before leaving the scene before the police arrived. We were watching and my partner saw them leaving the building and head off down the road quickly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Grealish today faces serious questions after police confirmed they were looking for the driver of a £70,000 white Range Rover that crashed into two stationary cars earlier that morning - shortly after he had warned people to &lsquo;stay at home&rsquo; during the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>Jack Grealish is pictured walking away, close to the scene of a Range Rover crash on Sunday morning in a Birmingham suburb</p>
<p>Police are investigating the crash involving the white Range Rover on Sunday morning</p>
<p>An image of a man resembling Grealish, wearing odd footwear, circulated on social media, claiming he was near the incident</p>
<p>The midfielder has previously been seen arriving at the Aston Villa training ground in a similar white Range Rover.</p>
<p>The 4x4 is claimed to have reversed from a designated parking bay, across a road and hit a parked silver van. The van reportedly has a dented bumper and smashed rear lights.</p>
<p>Grealish was then pictured with former Leeds United player Tony Capaldi, a former team-mate of McCormack&rsquo;s at Cardiff City, with locals claiming they had attended a party at McCormack&rsquo;s house on Saturday night.</p>
<p>A witness told MailOnline: &lsquo;We live near the estate he stayed partying overnight, his car was parked in the street all night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The commotion outside when he was hitting cars was tremendous, and the estate security guard saw him reverse into a van and hit a Mercedes causing significant damage to all cars.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A neighbour told The Sun: &lsquo;The party had been going on all night. It was unbearable. The noise had only stopped a short while when, just after 8am, there were a series of almighty collisions which reverberated through the flats.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Outside, Jack Grealish was stood next to his car rowing with a security guard. It was strange to see an England ace looking so unkempt and dishevelled. He looked unsteady and confused.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Grealish and McCormack were both unavailable for comment.</p>
<p>West Midlands Police said: &lsquo;We were called to Waterside, Dickens Heath, just before 10am to reports that a Range Rover had crashed into two parked cars in the street,&rsquo; the statement read.</p>
<p>The white Range Rover is pictured after the crash in the Dickens Heath area of Solihull</p>
<p>The white Range Rover was pictured damaged after reports of a crash with parked cars</p>
<p>&lsquo;The driver left his details with a member of the public at the scene before leaving on foot, and will be spoken to by police in due course.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Minor damage was caused to the parked vehicles. Officers are investigating the circumstances and anyone with information has been asked to get in touch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Current government advice during the coronavirus crisis states that citizens should leave their homes only to shop for basic necessities, to exercise once a day, for any medical need, or travelling to work if they cannot work from home.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Grealish appeared to echo that advice as he posted a video for his Twitter followers pleading with them to stay at home.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To help save lives, you must stay at home,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Grealish is the club captain of Aston Villa and has been with his boyhood club since 2001</p>
<p>Piers Morgan has slammed Grealish after he allegedly flouted coronavirus lockdown rules</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only leave your house to buy food, buy medicine or for exercise and always remember to stay at least two metres apart. This is urgent. Protect the NHS. Stay home. Save lives.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As with the rest of the Premier League, Villa&rsquo;s players are currently following fitness programmes at home, with their Bodymoor Heath training ground closed.</p>
<p>Grealish, who earns around £45,000 a week at Villa Park, joined his boyhood club at the age of six and has worked his way up the ranks to become a key player for the Midlands outfit. He has been linked with Manchester United this season.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old has established himself as a key man for Villa and is currently club captain</p>
<p>On Monday, Piers Morgan slammed Premier League star Grealish after the incident.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He had a lot to say last week,&rsquo; the Good Morning Britain presenter said, talking about the 24-year-old&rsquo;s social media post.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was really good until you go to your mates. What are you thinking to Jack? What happened to being sensible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t help when an England star, a role model, breaks the rules. Shame on you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Former Tottenham and Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp, also speaking on GMB, said: &lsquo;I have been his biggest fan. Every time I talk about him I say he should be in the England team.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I was a manager of the big teams I would buy him up. But this is no excuse. This is absolutely stupid. I can&rsquo;t believe what he has done, he needs to be punished for sure.&rsquo;

<h3 id="what-might-have-been-for-aston-villa-skipper-jack-grealish-today">What might have been for Aston Villa skipper Jack Grealish today&hellip;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.expressandstar.com/resizer/Ilx4_MhtYFFJ2pacyS8A3_C5ANY=/1200x0/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-expressandstar-mna.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A4OKR5HO7NCSTDJJUANRQGOC54.jpg" alt="img">
Today would have been a significant one for the England football team, with a home friendly against Italy at Wembley – the first of several staging posts in the final build-up to Euro 2020.</p>
<p>It might have been an even bigger day for Jack Grealish, the Villa playmaker whose form over the course of recent months had surely done enough to earn a first senior call-up and might even have been enough to force his way into Gareth Southgate’s starting XI.</p>
<p>Of course, it doesn’t matter a jot now. The European Championships have quite rightly been pushed back 12 months and there is no guessing when England might actually play again.</p>
<p>As Southgate said in a typically perfectly-toned message to supporters last week, we really shouldn’t waste another moment thinking about the postponement. “Now is not the time for us to take centre stage,” he wrote. “The heroes will be the men and women who continue to work tirelessly in our hospitals and medical centres to look after our friends and families.</p>
<p>“They won’t receive the individual acclaim, but we all know their importance is beyond anything we do on the pitch.”</p>
<p>You can be certain the sentiment is shared by Grealish, who for all the heights he is capable of reaching on the pitch remains firmly grounded off it. His focus right now will be the same as everyone else, on the health and well-being of friends and family. It doesn’t mean we shouldn’t feel an element of regret on his behalf, or for the thousands of other athletes around the world who have dedicated so much time and effort for competitions which have now been swept aside by global events.</p>
<p>Neither does it stop us from pondering the future and hoping for the sense of normality the return of sport will eventually bring, no matter how long it takes.</p>
<p>“The weirdest feeling I have is that I have found I really don’t have a life without football,” said Villa winger Anwar El Ghazi in a candid interview with the Dutch media last weekend.</p>
<p>El Ghazi will certainly not be the only one involved in the sport to have experienced that epiphany in recent days, no matter whether they are a player, coach, executive, or even journalist. On that score, things are only going to get tougher. This is no short-term shutdown.</p>
<p>The good news is at some point, some time sport will be back. And when it is, like many of the far more important things too often taken for granted, it will be celebrated and cherished more than ever.

<h3 id="five-jack-grealish-transfer-alternatives-manchester-united-could-save-millions-on">Five Jack Grealish transfer alternatives Manchester United could save millions on</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/article17747342.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Jack-Grealish-of-Aston-Villa.jpg" alt="img">
Manchester United will have to fork out a fortune to sign Jack Grealish this summer.</p>
<p>The Aston Villa captain has emerged as a transfer target for United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer who wants to add more creativity to his squad.</p>
<p>At 24, England hopeful Grealish - who has contributed to 13 goals in 26 Premier League appearances this season - appears to fit the bill.</p>
<p>Villa won’t be willing to let Grealish leave on the cheap though and are likely to play hard-ball, just as Crystal Palace, Leicester and Sporting did over Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes respectively.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here are some playmakers who are likely to be available for less than the reported £60 million Villa could demand for Grealish.</p>
<p>Harvey Barnes</p>
<p>Like Grealish, Barnes has tended to operate from the left for Leicester this season, but he can also thrive more centrally.</p>
<p>Barnes, who is two years Grealish’s junior, boasts similar statistics in the Premier League this season and recently overshadowed the Villa man in Leicester’s 4-0 victory at the King Power.</p>
<p>For now Barnes is still living in the shadows of James Maddison - another player linked with United - but he’s been the Foxes’ most potent attacking player since the turn of the year.</p>
<p>Dwight McNeil</p>
<p>It’s impossible to know whether releasing an under-14 will come back to bite you but that’s exactly what McNeil has done to United.</p>
<p>McNeil, a United fan growing up, was with the academy alongside Brandon Williams and Mason Greenwood through school before being released. He’s bounced back in some style though.</p>
<p>McNeil has been a regular in the Premier League for two seasons now and his performances for Burnley in recent months have been outstanding.</p>
<p>Clubs are queuing up to sign the 20-year-old who is comfortable out on the left or in central midfield.</p>
<p>Ebere Eze</p>
<p>QPR’s Eze is a supreme talent who has come of age in the Championship this season.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old’s skill and technique has been on display for three seasons at Loftus Road now, but he’s only just beginning to get the attention he truly deserves.</p>
<p>Eze has 20 goal contributions in 37 league games for QPR this term and looks certain to be playing Premier League football next season.</p>
<p>As Grealish has shown, sometimes players don’t need time to adapt to the top flight.</p>
<p>Houssem Aouar</p>
<p>Aouar’s showings for Lyon have seen him attract admiring glances from the Premier League with Liverpool and Arsenal reportedly interested in signing him. He’s also been linked with Juventus and Real Madrid.</p>
<p>With six goals in 29 domestic games for Lyon this season Aouar’s statistics stack up against the others on this list.</p>
<p>Aouar has craft and class in abundance and the Lyon number eight also possesses a good turn of speed.</p>
<p>Christopher Nkunku</p>
<p>RB Leipzig star Nkunku has caught the eye with his performances in the Bundesliga and the Champions League.</p>
<p>Nkunku’s 12 assists in 23 Bundesliga matches this campaign is bettered in Germany only by Bayern Munich’s Thomas Muller (16) and United target Jadon Sancho (15).</p>
<p>The Frenchman has played wide and even in attack this season but his best performances for Leipzig have come in midfield.
