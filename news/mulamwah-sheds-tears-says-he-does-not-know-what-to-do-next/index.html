SUMMARY “I would be attacked from all angles about my art, my looks, how I dress, my home…my girlfriend lost a baby and I told her it was probably time to quit comedy. “She encouraged me to continue but the negative energy online was too much. So many people were working to pull me down,” he said.</p>
<p>Days after he announced his exit from comedy, comedian David Oyando aka Mulamwah has spoken about what he has been going through.</p>
<p>In a video posted on his social media pages, the comedian said the past few days have been tough and he has gone through so much.</p>
<p>He admitted that the negative comments he was getting online affected him psychologically especially since it was getting to his family.</p>
<p>“I would be attacked from all angles about my art, my looks, how I dress, my home…my girlfriend lost a baby and I told her it was probably time to quit comedy.</p>
<p>“She encouraged me to continue but the negative energy online was too much. So many people were working to pull me down,” he said.</p>
<p>Mulamwah revealed that he was at home in Kitale with his friends when he went online and found his name trending.</p>

<p>“I am a comedian and I am used to banter but this was affecting my family. The screenshots would get to my parents and my siblings were affected too.</p>
<p>“I thought to myself that ditching comedy and living a quiet life away from the limelight would be beneficial to my family,” he said.</p>
<p>Mulamwah also explained how important his iconic shirt was and said that it was tough to burn it since it had a lot of sentimental value.</p>
<p>He lamented why there is a lot of negativity online because one is never forced to subscribe to any content.</p>

<p>“After burning my shirt I switched off my phone but later I realized I was trending…everyone was talking about it.</p>
<p>“Some said I was depressed…I had to uninstall WhatsApp and I was under immense pressure,” he said.</p>
<p>The comedian was, however, thankful to all those who reached out and encouraged him but said he was not sure on what to do next.</p>

<h3 id="kenyans-respond-to-ezekiel-mutua-after-offering-to-mentor-mulamwah">Kenyans respond to Ezekiel Mutua after offering to mentor Mulamwah</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/ureport-uploads/FILE-1586940600.jpg" alt="img">
SUMMARY Taking to his Twitter handle, the KFCB boss asked the comedian not to give up on comedy because he was cyber-bullied. Mutua even asked Mulamwah to give him a call and offered to mentor him to become the ambassador of clean content.</p>
<p>Kenyan Film Classification Board (KFCB) boss Ezekiel Mutua on Wednesday, April 15, weighed in on Kenyan comedian Mulamwah’s cyber-bullying on social media.</p>
<p>Taking to his Twitter handle, the KFCB boss asked the comedian not to give up on comedy because he was cyber-bullied.</p>
<p>Mutua even asked Mulamwah to give him a call and offered to mentor him to become the ambassador of clean content.</p>
<p>“I hear that twitterates are driving @mulamwah out of comedy &amp; into depression. Bro pick yourself up and give me a call. I will buy you a new shirt, mentor you and make you an ambassador of clean content. The best way of dealing with cyber bullies is to refuse to give up!” Mutua said.</p>
<p>When one tweep told the KFCB boss that he drove Alvindo, another Kenyan comedian, into depression, Mutua said that he would have helped if the comedian changed his content.</p>
<p>“I would have helped him too if he was willing to change and do clean content. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be dirty to sell. I helped Desagu with 200K to buy better equipment and I demand nothing from him,” added the KFCB boss.</p>
<p>On Monday, the comedian posted a video on Instagram of him burning his signature shirt as a way of saying he had quit comedy due to the number of trolls.</p>
<p>Mulamwah said that he was not doing comedy for the fame adding that his wife miscarried following the stress of him being trolled.</p>

<p>“I wasn&rsquo;t here for fame and bad blood but for fun…To those who always wished the worst for me I hope y&rsquo;all happy now, the stage is all yours. my prayer is that no one else goes through the same again.</p>
<p>“I once posted @carrol_sonie while in a hospital bed, we had just lost our baby at 3 months following stress after being trolled online. I have never been the same since then,” said the comedian.</p>
<p>Despite efforts by the KFCB boss to help and mentor the comedian, a section of Kenyans on Twitter had a lot to say.</p>
<p>Some Kenyans thanked Mutua for his generosity but asked him to first investigate the comedian before taking any further measures.</p>
<p>Ja Lock: The worst kind of votes to get in life is sympathy votes. I wish you knew how many people Mulamwah has bullied and abused on these streets. Yes, bullying is wrong and should be condemned, but he is holding the wrong end of the stick.</p>
<p>Wanjiku Mugane: As you take your time to listen to music before you ban it also take your time to research on Mulamwah it might take a month. True he needs a mentor and a break.</p>
<p>Nelson Namonywa: Mulamwah wanted this for himself by being a bully to some of his critics forgetting that KOT are more than bullies when rattled.</p>
<p>Gacheru Kariuki: The guy has bullied so many people, including Kamene Goro. Support him, but don&rsquo;t hide the fact that he is also a big bully.</p>
<p>Peter Luka: That’s great. The mark of a leader here! @mulamwah take up this offer for mature mentorship and guidance.</p>
<p>Jama Shujaa: I hate bullies and I do not agree with cyber bullying at all. But do you know Mulamwah is one of the Biggest Bullies on this App??? However much I do not support anyone bullying someone back. But as you mentor him ask him to stop being a bully himself.</p>

<h3 id="comedian-mulamwah-gets-rebuke-sympathy-in-equal-measure-after-quitting-social-media-over-cyberbullying">Comedian Mulamwah gets rebuke, sympathy in equal measure after ‘quitting’ social media over cyberbullying</h3>
<p><img src="https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Mulamwah-1.jpg" alt="img">
Online funnyman Kendrick Mulamwah on Monday threw in the towel and said he had abandoned online comedy after being mercilessly trolled on social media.</p>
<p>In a post, Mulamwah, who rose to fame thanks to Instagram skits, said his life was filled with constant attacks, rebuke and trolling since he joined the entertainment industry and set ablaze his signature shirt, which he often wears during his skits.</p>
<p>The comedian said that trolls were doing more harm to his life than good and had left him fatherless after losing his child at 3 months due to stress reportedly caused by cyber bullies.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t here for fame and bad blood but for fun…To those who always wished the worst for me I hope y’all happy now, the stage is all yours. My prayer is that no one else goes through the same again,” he wrote.</p>
<p>He added: “I once posted @carrol_sonie while in a hospital bed, we had just lost our baby at 3 months following stress after being trolled online. I have never been the same since then,” he lamented.</p>
<p>Mulamwah also took time to apologise to all those who looked up to him but urged them to continue with their journey.</p>
<p>“We shall still meet on different entertainment platforms, social media ADS and product campaigns too,” he wrote.</p>
<p>After his post, hundreds of top comedians in the country and his followers on Twitter and Instagram came to offer him advice and urging him to fight on to surmount the hurdles.</p>
<p>“Small bro, no one promised you it was going to be easy but nobody says that you can’t overcome it as well, man was made to talk but whether it’s positive or negative was left to man to decided but hey good news is only God is the author of your destiny and many great stories are made out of people like you and I, wake up tomorrow smile and ask yourself why you have been doing it in the first place. You must go back!! Change the clothes if you have to!!” said comedian Dr Ofweneke</p>
<p>“Now this is the real definition of trying to make everyone happy… huwezi.. hata ukifanya nini hawatakupenda… sisi tuko mpaka na members of the family wenye tunasaidia na school fees na rent, Marafiki wenye tulileta Nairobi wengine tunazunguka nao tukifikiri ni watu but bado wanasema tutaisha coz hawaonangi kenye tunafanya ya maana na usanii. Wacha ujinga nunua nguo ingine kuja tufanye comedy Nairobi city,” wrote Dj Shiti.</p>
<p>Jalongo had a few words of wisdom and wrote: “Kijana kesho ukiamka enda sokoni uchukue nguo ingine kazi iendelee. You can’t make everyone happy! Even Jesus was crucified!! I know sometimes it really hurts but truth is no one has ever made it without haters!! Sisi sikuizi tumezoea hadi tusipotukanwa tunashangaa nini mbaya!!….Harden up son! Nobody said it will be easy! Hakuna kutoroka!! Twende kazi!!”</p>
<p>Another comic, Teacher Wanjiku said, “From the comments, you have plenty of advice that i think you should follow if you choose to. What you should be thinking about right now is ‘video yangu next content ni gani’ kazi lazima iendeleee, it must go on.”</p>
<p>But a section of Kenyans on Twitter were having none of what they termed as antics and pretense, accusing him of being one of the biggest bullies on social media.</p>
<p>Radio presenter Kamene Goro did not mince her words and narrated how the comedian once trolled her terming his current stance on bullying as hypocritical.</p>
<p>“This is some hypocritical nonsense. Personally, Mulamwah is the biggest bully I have ever met! I have been in this industry for 8 years very few people can bully me. Mulamwah bullied me online. So I posted a picture with Ronoh and we were sitting at the swimming pool rooftop at my place. Mulamwah comes to the comment section and said if the two of us get into the pool, all the water pours out,” she said.</p>
<p>Other Kenyans dug into the archives and dug out posts by the comedian on various social media platforms trolling people, some which Nairobi News cannot publish.</p>
<p>One Malik 88 wrote and shared a screenshot of what the comedian had written, “To the TV stations that are planning to interview #mulamwah about bullying, Don’t forget to ask him the following, just a few to mention…..then chase him and call the police.”</p>
<p>“Mulamwa once told my Android friend that hao followers wake hata wakigeuzwa kuwa doo na wakuwe multiplied by 1000 bado hawezi manage kubuy Iphone. My friend almost died of depression, i told him pole. But for Mulamwa, my word to you, always be NICE. It costs nothing!” Eugine Ongeri shared.</p>
<p>Peter Mwangi also shared a screenshot of what Mulamwah had said and captioned it, “Mulamwah is the author to his own misfortunes” #Mulamwah yesterday tweeted ati hawezi dress kama wamama which we all know alikuwa anadirect that tweet to Flaqo then went ahead and deleted the tweet after kujua hajafanya poa, now the guy is seeking sympathy,.OK nice good.”</p>
<p>Mulamwah trended on Twitter for the better part of Monday and Tuesday as those for and against him traded words, but it remains unclear if he left comedy for good.
