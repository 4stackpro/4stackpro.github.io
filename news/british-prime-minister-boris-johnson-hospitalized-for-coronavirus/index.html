British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who tested positive for COVID-19, was admitted to the hospital due to “persistent symptoms of coronavirus,” the BBC reported Sunday.</p>
<p>A government spokeswoman described the move as a “precautionary step” that was “on the advice of his doctor.”</p>
<p>Johnson, 55, has been isolating after being diagnosed with coronavirus 10 days ago.</p>
<p>He has been self-quarantining separately from his pregnant girlfriend, who said Saturday she was “on the mend” after suffering symptoms over the past week.

<h3 id="boris-johnson-has-coronavirus-he-handled-it-badly---the-new-york-times">Boris Johnson Has Coronavirus. He Handled It Badly. - The New York Times</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/27/opinion/27cottleWeb/27cottleWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
Boris Johnson, the prime minister of Britain, on Friday announced that he had tested positive for the coronavirus. In a brief video released on Twitter, he shared the basics: Having developed “mild symptoms — that’s to say, a temperature and a persistent cough” — he underwent testing and received the bad news. He will now be “self-isolating” until the illness has run its course.</p>
<p>Looking mostly healthy, if typically disheveled, Mr. Johnson stressed that he would continue to “lead the national fightback” from his home via teleconferencing. He urged the British public to abide by the three-week lockdown put into place on Monday. The more effectively people stick with social distancing, the faster the nation and its National Health Service will “bounce back,” he said, before closing with the plea, “Stay at home, protect the N.H.S. and save lives.”</p>
<p>It was a responsible, no-drama message. If only the prime minister had displayed such leadership sooner, he — and who knows how many others — might have been spared this illness.</p>
<p>Instead, Mr. Johnson’s handling of the crisis has borne an unsettling resemblance to that of President Trump. He was slow to recognize the risks, taking a mid-February holiday with his pregnant fiancée at his country home. Even after the virus became impossible to ignore, he remained glib and dismissive, as his government dithered and failed to put together a coherent response.

<h3 id="coronavirus-latest-uk-pm-boris-johnson-hospitalized-with-covid-19-symptoms">Coronavirus latest: UK PM Boris Johnson hospitalized with COVID-19 symptoms</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.dw.com/image/52811793_304.jpg" alt="img">
Johnson&rsquo;s office says the PM was hospitalized for &ldquo;tests&rdquo; on the advice of his doctor</p>
<p>Cases of coronavirus in Germany have surpassed 100,000</p>
<p>US Surgeon General warns of the &ldquo;hardest&rdquo; and &ldquo;saddest&rdquo; week of most Americans&rsquo; lives</p>
<p>Spain sees its third consecutive daily decline in deaths; Italy&rsquo;s daily fatality rate is the lowest in two weeks</p>
<p>Greece puts a second migrant camp in quarantine</p>
<p>Updates in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC/GMT)</p>
<p>23:47 President Donald Trump said he was hopeful that the US could be seeing a &lsquo;&lsquo;leveling-off&rsquo;&rsquo; of the coronavirus crisis in some of the country&rsquo;s hot spots for the viral outbreak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We see light at the end of the tunnel. Things are happening,&rdquo; the president said during his daily White House briefing on the subject. But he warned that still, the US would reach &lsquo;&lsquo;a horrific point&rsquo;&rsquo; in terms of deaths.</p>
<p>Trump added that some 1.67 million Americans had been tested so far and he again pushed the notion that hydroxychloroquine would be effective against the virus.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that no conclusive evidence exists to support the claim, Trump said that there were &lsquo;&lsquo;some very strong signs&rsquo;&rsquo; that the drug helped and announced that the government had purchased &lsquo;&lsquo;a tremendous amount&rsquo;&rsquo; of it.</p>
<p>22:37 A 4-year-old Malayan tiger at New York&rsquo;s Bronx Zoo has tested positive for COVID-19. It is the first recorded case of a tiger testing positive for coronavirus in the US and globally.</p>
<p>The zoo has been closed to the public since March 16 and the tiger began showing respiratory illness symptoms on March 27. An asymptomatic zoo employee is believed to have infected the animal.</p>
<p>Some six other cats have also fallen ill, though they have not yet been confirmed positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We tested the cat out of an abundance of caution&rdquo; and aim to &ldquo;contribute to the world&rsquo;s continuing understanding of this novel coronavirus,&rdquo; said Dr. Paul Calle, the zoo&rsquo;s chief veterinarian.</p>
<p>The zoo said there is &ldquo;no evidence that animals play a role in the transmission of COVID-19 to people other than the initial event in the Wuhan market, and no evidence that any person has been infected with COVID-19 in the US by animals, including by pet dogs or cats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other cases of human-to-animal transmission of coronavius have been documented, including a pet cat in Belgium and two dogs in Hong Kong. No animal deaths from the virus have been registered so far.</p>
<p>21:13 Germany has surpassed 100,000 coronavirus cases, according to the latest count from the Johns Hopkins University. The cities of Berlin, Munich and Hamburg currently hold the highest number of infections.</p>
<p>There have been 1,576 COVID-19 deaths across the country.</p>
<p>20:31: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was hospitalized on Sunday. The 55-year-old tested positive for coronavirus on March 26.</p>
<p>Downing Street said that it was a &ldquo;precautionary step&rdquo; as he was showing &ldquo;persistent symptoms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the advice of his doctor, the Prime Minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests,&rdquo; his office said.</p>

<p>19:50 The German Economic Institute (IW) has come up with a 12-point plan to lift movement restrictions in Germany, once the coronavirus outbreak is under control. The newspaper Bild reports that the plan calls for medical capabilities and testing to be boosted. Then schools and kindergartens could reopen and public transport ramped up, allowing public institutions to return to normal initially. Restaurants and stores could then reopen, possibly under orders to allow patrons to maintain a safe distance. Later, the private sector could restart their businesses and borders with the rest of the EU can be reopened. The other stages of the plan include the loosening of rules for paying taxes and debt and allowing migrant labor to return safely. Finally, the government would need to cut taxes, boost domestic demand, and launch a new program of economic stimulus, according to the IW report.</p>

<p>19:27 Addressing the UK, Queen Elizabeth said the current period of self-isolation brought back memories of a World War II radio broadcast which she made when she was 14 years old. &ldquo;It reminds me of the very first broadcast I made, in 1940, helped by my sister. We, as children, spoke from here at Windsor to children who had been evacuated from their homes and sent away for their own safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today, once again, many will feel a painful sense of separation from their loved ones,&rdquo; she said in a pre-recorded speech. &ldquo;But now, as then, we know, deep down, that it is the right thing to do. While we have faced challenges before, this one is different. This time we join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavor, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;We will succeed - and that success will belong to every one of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>19:20 The British monarch, Queen Elizabeth, has thanked medical workers, carers and all essential workers who remain active during the coronavirus outbreak. &ldquo;I am sure the nation will join me in assuring you that what you do is appreciated and every hour of your hard work brings us closer to a return to more normal times,&rdquo; she said in a pre-recorded address that was broadcast on Sunday evening.</p>
<p>The 93-year-old head of state also thanked people for staying at home and urged Britons to show &ldquo;attributes of self-discipline, of quiet good-humored resolve and of fellow-feeling&rdquo; and be able to take pride in their response. &ldquo;Together we are tackling this disease, and I want to reassure you that if we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>19:10 Despite a nationwide lockdown, German authorities have approved two protests against transporting nuclear waste. The rallies will be held in the northwestern cities of Münster and Gronau on Monday. The organizers said only 15 people would take part in either event, and they would be wearing face masks and keep at a 1.5 meter (5 feet) distance away from each other. The activists oppose the planned transport of uranium from an enrichment facility in Gronau to the Russian factory of Novouralsk, according to Germany&rsquo;s public broadcaster Deutschlandfunk.</p>
<p>18:40 Scotland&rsquo;s top medical expert has been caught ignoring her own advice on staying at home during the outbreak. People across the UK slammed Chief Medical Officer Catherine Calderwood after photos of her in the coastal town of Earlsferry were published in The Sun newspaper. Calderwood admitted she visited her second home on Scotland&rsquo;s east coast over two consecutive weekends, despite urging the public to avoid traveling. &ldquo;I did not follow the advice I am giving to others,&rdquo; Calderwood told a news conference. &ldquo;I am truly sorry for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>18:30 Swiss-born Serbian footballer Aleksandar Prijovic has been sentenced to three months in-home detention for flaunting Serbia&rsquo;s strict lockdown rules. The 29-year-old striker was arrested with more than a dozen partygoers at a hotel in Belgrade on Friday. He pleaded guilty to breaking the emergency order which bans gathering of groups larger than five.</p>
<p>Prijovic, who plays for Al Ittihad in Saudi Arabia and the Serbian national team, is the second famous footballer to face punishment over isolation rules in the Balkan nation. Last month, Real Madrid striker Luka Jovic returned to Serbia and then left his mandatory 14-day home quarantine, triggering outrage. The 22-year-old athlete blamed local officials, saying they &ldquo;did their job unprofessionally and did not give me precise instructions on self-isolation.&rdquo; He faces a fine and up to three years in jail.</p>

<p>18:20 France has reported 357 coronavirus deaths in hospital, lower than the previous two days, bringing the country&rsquo;s total death toll to 8,078. The overall tally includes 5,889 patients who died in hospital and 2,189 people in old age homes and other medical facilities, a government statement said.</p>
<p>18:10 Singapore has quarantined 20,000 migrant workers in their dormitories, after linking a number of new coronavirus cases to two buildings. Authorities have reported 120 new infections, by far the largest day-to-day jump since the outbreak reached the city-state. The latest figure mark a 60% percent increase over the previous day, when 75 new cases were registered. The rich Asian country has seen 1,309 infections and six deaths.</p>
<p>17:55 Ireland&rsquo;s Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, a medical doctor by vocation, has re-registered as a medical practitioner and will be working one shift per week to help the country&rsquo;s anti-coronavirus effort, his office said on Sunday. The 41-year-old Varadkar has worked as a doctor for several years before entering politics. His decision to return to medicine comes after his government launched a massive recruitment drive among retired or non-practicing health professionals. The country&rsquo;s Health Service Executive (HSE) said over 70,000 people signaled they were ready to rejoin.</p>
<p>17:45 Police in Australia have opened a criminal investigation into why a cruise ship was allowed to disembark in Sydney, resulting in more than 10% of the country&rsquo;s total coronavirus cases. The Ruby Princess, owned by British-American cruise operator Carnival, docked in Sydney Harbour on March 19 after 11 days at sea.</p>
<p>Border and health authorities had allowed some 2,700 passengers to leave with only minimal checks, even though about a dozen passengers showed respiratory symptoms before they disembarked.</p>
<p>The Ruby Princess is now in Botany Bay, but due to dock further south at Port Kembla on Monday</p>
<p>17:30 With another 73 people dying of COVID-19 in Turkey, the country&rsquo;s death toll has now reached 574. Turkey has also registered 3,135 new cases for a total of 27,069 infections, the country&rsquo;s Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said on Twitter.</p>
<p>After ordering a mandatory confinement order for everyone older than 65 and younger than 20, Turkish authorities revised the decision on Sunday and said seasonal agricultural workers and employees aged 18-20 would be exempt.</p>
<p>17:05 Residents of India turned off their lights and lit candles, lamps, and flashlights in a show of solidarity after Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged them to &ldquo;challenge the darkness spread by the coronavirus crisis.&rdquo; The event, on Sunday night, also saw people shout, cheer, and gather at their doors, balconies and windows. The show of solidarity lasted for nine minutes.</p>
<p>This scene in Ahmedabad was repeated in homes and apartment blocks all over India</p>
<p>16:55 The novel coronavirus has a good chance of becoming &ldquo;seasonal,&rdquo; says Anthony Fauci, one of the most senior figures in the Trump administration&rsquo;s virus response team. He thinks it is unlikely that the virus will be completely eradicated this year and the &ldquo;beginning of a resurgence&rdquo; could be seen during the next flu season. Speaking on CBS&rsquo;s Face the Nation, Fauci also warned that US states without lockdown measures are putting themselves at risk.</p>
<p>16:40 The death toll in Canada has jumped by over 20% in a single day, reaching 258. With 1,502 new infections, the country now has 14,436 confirmed cases. In a bid to partially offset the economic impact of the outbreak, the government is offering full-time jobs to army reservists. Canada has around 31,000 reserve military personnel, with most of them serving one evening a week and one weekend a month. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that bolstering military ranks would also &ldquo;ensure our communities are well supported.&rdquo;</p>
<p>16:35 Italy has recorded its lowest death toll in over two weeks. According to the civil protection service, another 525 have died, taking the overall death toll to 15,887. The number of deaths over the past 24 hours was the lowest since March 19. &ldquo;This is good news but we should not let our guard down,&rdquo; civil protection service chief Angelo Borrelli told reporters. Even so, 91,246 people remain ill, a rise of 2,972. Nearly 22,000 have recovered.</p>

<p>16:30 Here is our roundup of COVID-19 stories from across the world:</p>
<p>United States: The US should brace for &ldquo;the hardest and the saddest week of most Americans&rsquo; lives,&rdquo; the country&rsquo;s surgeon general has said. The death toll has topped 8,400 and is rising fast. &ldquo;This is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9/11 moment, only it&rsquo;s not going to be localized,&rdquo; Surgeon General Jerome Adams, one of the most senior health officials in the country, told Fox News on Sunday. The White House has projected that between 100,000 and 240,000 people in the US will die before the epidemic runs its course.</p>
<p>European Union: Several EU countries say their infection rates are slowing, giving rise to hopes that the end of the crisis might be in sight. On Sunday, Spain reported 674 deaths — the lowest fatality figure in 10 days and said 6,023 more people were newly infected — about 1,000 fewer than the day before. Italy also reported its first-ever reduction in the number of patients requiring intensive care, from 4,068 on Friday to 3,994 on Saturday. Germany reported a third consecutive day of falling infection numbers, from 6,174 reported on Friday to 5,936 on Sunday.</p>
<p>Pakistan: Authorities in Pakistan have quarantined 20,000 Muslim worshipers and are searching for thousands more who defied a ban on large meetings to attend an Islamic gathering in Lahore. Over 100,000 people are believed to have attended the March 10-12 event including several foreign nationals.</p>
<p>United Kingdom: Queen Elizabeth has urged British people to show &ldquo;good-humored resolve&rdquo; and exercise self-discipline in a special address on the COVID-19 outbreak. &ldquo;I hope in the years to come, everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge, and those who come after us will say that the Britons of this generation were as strong as any,&rdquo; she said, according to remarks released before her TV address aired on Sunday evening.</p>
<p>China: With many countries ordering masks, ventilators and COVID-19 testing kits from China, the Asian superpower says it has made $1.44 billion, €1.33 billion exporting medical equipment since March 1. However, the Netherlands and Spain have rejected masks and test kits, saying that the supplies were faulty.</p>
<p>Ecuador: After videos of abandoned dead bodies surfaced online, the country&rsquo;s vice president has vowed to make amends. &ldquo;We have seen images that should never have happened and as your public servant, I apologize,&rdquo; he said.

<p>Speranza also discussed the creation of coronavirus-focussed hospitals and creating an app to track the infected, as well as give them remote access to medical care.</p>
<p>Speranza urged caution, saying there would be &ldquo;no single day on which we will be able to say &lsquo;it&rsquo;s all over,'&rdquo; and that it would be &ldquo;irresponsible&rdquo; to promise a date for a return to normality.</p>

<p>In reporting on the coronavirus pandemic, unless otherwise specified, DW uses figures provided by the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Coronavirus Resource Center in the United States. JHU updates figures in real time, collating data from world health organizations, state and national governments and other public official sources, all of whom have their own systems for compiling information.</p>
<p>Germany&rsquo;s national statistics are compiled by its public health agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). These figures depend on data transmission from state and local levels and are updated around once a day, which can lead to deviation from JHU.</p>
