<p>Australian Trainers&rsquo; Association president Robbie Griffiths believes animal welfare should be taken into consideration by the state and Federal Governments if they are looking at closing down the racing industry due to the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bottom line there are 4000 or more thoroughbreds who will still need to be fed and watered and looked after every day so you can&rsquo;t shut the gates on stables completely, as if you did it would become an animal welfare issue. This also applies to harness, greyhound and all living animal operations,&rdquo; Griffiths said.</p>
<p>Griffiths said the training centres acted in a similar manner to quarantine centres as human movement was controlled.</p>
<p>Stream over 50 sports On-Demand with KAYO SPORTS on your TV, computer, mobile or tablet. Just $25/month, no lock-in contract. Get your 14-day free trial and start streaming instantly &gt;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you can&rsquo;t lock the gates on stables. The same people who are with the horses now will still be with them then. You can&rsquo;t close it down. Even if they all go spelling people need to feed them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horses don&rsquo;t carry the virus. Cats and dogs still need to be fed as do horses. We can&rsquo;t afford for the horse&rsquo;s sake to shut the doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another trainer, Natalie Young, also said even if race meetings were stopped she hoped that training centres could stay open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like people at home who can just take their dogs out for a walk. These horses need care and continual work,&rdquo; Young said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We just have to hope that if the worst happens and we can&rsquo;t race that the training centres can stay open. It&rsquo;s not like people at home who can just take their dogs out for a walk. These horses need care and continual work.</p>
<p>Griffiths said racing participants have been extra diligent as they know they&rsquo;ve been privileged to continue racing at a time when many industries have shut.</p>
<p>Horse racing continues to be held wwhile other sports go into a hiatus.</p>
<p>He also believes as participants work in the racing bubble they do not mix with the wider society.</p>
<p>Griffiths said race meetings had a maximum of 150 people on course who were all instructed to stay well clear of each other and were all practising the best hygiene protocols.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As an industry we&rsquo;re doing a great job. We&rsquo;re the third biggest industry in the country and there&rsquo;s a benefit for all if we continue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Griffiths also said workers being in the racing bubble also gave them an advantage over other industries as they stayed to themselves.</p>
<p>Danny O&rsquo;Brien said he hoped racing could go on for the foreseeable future and he pointed out that for those in the industry it was a lifestyle commitment for participants, and as a result, it was the right industry to keep going.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the hours our workers have got it&rsquo;s their life. They work for most of the day in the stables and then they go home and come back early in the morning to start again. 90 per cent of them don&rsquo;t go out so they&rsquo;re not mixing with the general population,&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="missing-event-horse-found-after-six-days-alone-in-the-woods">Missing event horse found after six days alone in the woods</h3>
<p><img src="https://keyassets.timeincuk.net/inspirewp/live/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2020/03/Peekaboo.jpg" alt="img">
An event horse who went missing after she escaped from her field was found safe and well, six days later.</p>
<p>Jennie Brannigan’s five-year-old Keepsake, known as Peekaboo at home, jumped out of her field on 13 March. It is thought she may have been spooked by the wild hogs that live in the neighbouring Florida woods.</p>
<p>Jennie told H&amp;H her grooms found broken fencing and Peekaboo missing, as well as another horse who was then found, on the Friday morning.</p>
<p>“I thought I’d find her right away but drove round for a few hours and couldn’t find her,” she said. “I had five or six horses competing at an event that day, and three or four students, so it was a bit tough to concentrate when I couldn’t find a horse.”</p>
<p>Jennie, who also rode Peekaboo’s dam and sisters, said the mare is somewhat quirky, and she was not surprised she had not stopped nearby, even with all the other horses in local fields.</p>
<p>“My main concern was a quicksand pond next door and we could see evidence she’d jumped into that field but not out of it,” she said.</p>
<p>“I hired a thermal drone and it found a hotspot, about the size of a horse. I was so upset, but then it turned out it was just sand – and Alexa who works for me then found hoofprints where she’d jumped out of the field.”</p>
<p>Jennie put up posters locally appealing for sightings, and eventually people got in touch, one to say he had heard a horse on the road about 2.30am on 13 March, and another who had seen the mare – who was still wearing part of her distinctive rug – in woods near her home.</p>
<p>Continues below…</p>
<p>On 19 March, the team went into the woods and found Peekaboo, who was thin and dehydrated but otherwise unharmed.</p>
<p>“I think she’d just run blindly,” Jennie said. “The woods here are very thick, like jungle, and I think she’d run so far in, she got stuck.</p>
<p>“I think she’d hardly eaten or drunk but she’s fine, she even still had all four shoes on when she came home. It’s a crazy story; I don’t know one other horse who would run past six or seven fields with horses in them, into the woods and be alone without food or water.</p>
<p>“But she’s very unusual, which is what made me hold out some hope. She’s a lovely mare.”</p>

<p><img src="https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/03/27/622379.jpg" alt="img">
BANGKOK (The Nation/ANN): Following the deaths of 30 horses in the Northeast region on Thursday (March 26), the Department of Livestock Development conducted an investigation and learned that the horses had had fevers, snots and breathing difficulties, but no signs of Covid-19 infection.</p>
<p>The animals also presented subconjunctival haemorrhage, fatigue and swollen faces which are symptoms of the African horse disease.</p>
<p>The department ordered horse farm owners to quarantine them to prevent the disease from spreading and confirmed that it poses no danger to humans. - The Nation/Asia News Network
