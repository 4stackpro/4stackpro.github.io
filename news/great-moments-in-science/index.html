Dr Karl:</p>
<p>G&rsquo;day, Dr Karl here. And even though I&rsquo;m an arachnophobe, I can definitely appreciate how incredible spiders are.</p>
<p>If it wasn&rsquo;t for our little friends with eight legs, we would have no agriculture. That&rsquo;s right - according to the evolutionary biologist, Miquel Arnedo, from the University of Barcelona, we humans would have no food crops without spiders because &ldquo;&hellip; insects would eat them all&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So, spiders have a reflex to eat, and we humans accidentally benefit.</p>
<p>But recent research show that spiders are more than just a bundle of reflexes. They can plan for the future, they make and use tools, and &ndash; amazingly - they can count.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, most of us respond to spiders with our own reflex - by trying to kill them.</p>
<p>Even so, spiders are very successful. There are more than 48,000 different species of spiders, and on average, there are about 130 spiders on each square metre of dry land.</p>
<p>Now spiders have been around for a very long time. They have been making silk for almost 400 million years. This silk comes out of specific organs on the body called spinnerets.</p>
<p>And silk is a good starting point to appreciate just how smart a spider really is.</p>
<p>Spiders can make a web that is incredibly efficient in terms of filling the space, avoiding obstacles and catching food. And yet most spiders are almost completely blind. So how do they map out the space they need to fill with their web?</p>
<p>Well many spiders start their web by throwing out a horizontal line across the gap, and then they map out the space for their web by descending and ascending from many locations on this horizontal line. This is surprising, because until recently, we thought that only birds and mammals could mentally represent a space, and make what is technically called a &ldquo;cognitive map&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Nope, arachnids are in this mental map-making club as well.</p>
<p>And it also seems that spiders can think ahead.</p>
<p>They will alter the size and shape of their web, for example, if they are running low on silk, or if the temperature drops. And based on past experience, they will adjust the tension and stickiness of specific strands in the web, and even lay down extra strands if something big broke through the web last time.</p>
<p>So the web is not something that is simply built automatically, by primitive reflexes, in the same way every time, but rather, a web is continually being changed and improved.</p>
<p>This is amazing behaviour, especially when you consider how small the brain of some spiders really is! Some orb weaver spiders weigh less than one thousandth of a gram, and the brain is a tiny fraction of that.</p>
<p>One Jumping Spider in the genus Portia can do amazing stuff with its brain. Now these spiders are small &ndash; usually less than one centimetre long. And they don&rsquo;t wait around in webs to catch food. They are &ldquo;attack spiders&rdquo; &ndash; they attack and eat other spiders &ndash; up to twice their size! Like microscopic cats, they silently roam the landscape, looking for something to eat &ndash; so unlike other spiders, they have great eyesight.</p>
<p>And they couple that eyesight with some impressive memory and counting skills.</p>
<p>In one remarkable study, scientists put a single Portia spider on a tower on a tiny island in a tiny lake, (ok &hellip; a puddle!) surrounded by dry land.</p>
<p>Now Portia spiders hate getting wet. So the experimenters put two floating pathways across the lake. And outside the lake, on dry land, they put another spider for the Portia to eat on another tower. But (and here&rsquo;s a bit of clever design) when the Portia went down its tower, it lost sight of its potential dinner. So it had to use its memory.</p>
<p>First experiment.</p>
<p>One floating pathway led to dinner, while the other did not. The Portia could see this from its tower. And after it had climbed down its tower, it always remembered which was pathway led to dinner. Yup, the Portia remembered its mind map.</p>
<p>Second experiment.</p>
<p>This time, both floating pathways led to dinner, but one was shorter. And, yep, Portia chose the shorter pathway. Again, Portia could remember the map.</p>
<p>Third experiment &ndash; and this is to do with &ldquo;counting&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Now this experiment relies on something well-known to psychologists: a sudden pause in activity is an indicator of &ldquo;confusion&rdquo; or &ldquo;surprise&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So, getting back to our Portia spider. Up on its tower, it sees a few spiders waiting to be eaten over on the other tower. So it comes down from its tower, crosses the water, arrive at dinner &ndash; BUT in the meantime, the experimenters have changed the number of spiders waiting to be eaten. There might be more, or there might be fewer &ndash; but the point is, the number is different.</p>
<p>And get this: the Portia spider suddenly pauses. It expected a certain number, but didn&rsquo;t find them. Yes, this really suggests that spiders can count.</p>
<p>So if you ever see a spider and have a reflex urge to thwack it &ndash; try and resist. As well as protecting our crops and being artisanal builders, it probably knows where you live &hellip;

<h3 id="expert-discovers-spider-that-looks-like-van-goghs-painting-starry-night">Expert discovers spider that looks like van Gogh’s painting &lsquo;Starry Night&rsquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2020/03/SpiderStarryNight.jpg" alt="img">
A new species of spider that resembles Vincent van Gogh’s famous “Starry Night” painting has been discovered in Australia.</p>
<p>The spider is one of seven new species of Peacock spider identified by Joseph Schubert of Australia’s Museums Victoria.</p>
<p>SHOCKING PHOTO OF A COLONY OF HUNTSMAN SPIDERS LIVING TOGETHER FOUND IN AUSTRALIA</p>
<p>“Last year I travelled the country collecting specimens of these new peacock spiders (some discovered by citizen scientists!) and spent countless hours in the lab studying them,” Schubert tweeted on March 26. “Some welcome news in tough times,” added the entomology and arachnology expert at Melbourne Museum.</p>
<p>The spider, which bears a striking resemblance to “Starry Night,” is Maratus constellatus, and was discovered in Western Australia, along with four other colorful species &ndash; Maratus azureus, Maratus laurenae, Maratus noggerup and Maratus suae. Another species, Maratus volpei, was discovered in South Australia and Maratus inaquosus was identified in Victoria</p>

<p>&ldquo;Starry Night,&rdquo; which is in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, was painted by van Gogh at San Remy in southern France in June 1889.</p>
<p>Schubert, who is only 22, previously described five new species of Peacock spider in 2019, so the latest discoveries take his tally to 12. Incredibly, he grew up afraid of spiders, according to a statement released by Museums Victoria.</p>
<p>A paper on the seven new spider species has been published in the journal Zootaxa. The research was funded by Bush Blitz Australia and Museums Victoria.</p>

<p>“Some of the species in this paper were discovered by citizen scientists who documented the localities and sent images to me&ndash; their help is so important for this kind of research,” Schubert added.</p>
