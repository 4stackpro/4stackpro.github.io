4-4 Spotlight: Logan’s Allison Erickson</p>
<p>Ken Kosirowski by Ken Kosirowski</p>
<p>LA CROSSE, Wis (WKBT)–We continue with our new Sports Spotlight segment, in which we give our local senior athletes a chance to be recognized, since they’re unable to play their final season of competition.</p>
<p>Being honored for Saturday, April 4th is Logan High School’s Allison Erickson.</p>
<p>Erickson has been behind home plate for the Rangers for four years. She’s a three sport athlete, but out of all of them, Softball is her favorite. Along with other seniors Marissa Kleman, Jenna Davis and Claire Borsheim were poised to make a run of things in the state tournament.</p>
<p>Those seniors have been on the same team since 10 under ball. Last year Allison helped lead the team within a game from winning regional competition, and with how close this senior team is they may have done more this year.</p>
<p>If you have an athlete you know who you feel should be nominated, click here to get to our Sports Spotlight page.</p>
<p>There you’ll be invited to fill out a comprehensive nomination form. You can also email <a href="mailto:kkosirowski@wkbt.com">kkosirowski@wkbt.com</a> photos and videos of your athlete that you’d like to include on air.</p>

<p><img src="https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/bidenjoetwo_03122020getty.jpg" alt="img">
Welcome to The Hill&rsquo;s Campaign Report, your daily rundown on all the latest news in the 2020 presidential, Senate and House races. Did someone forward this to you? Click here to subscribe.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re Julia Manchester, Max Greenwood and Jonathan Easley. Here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re watching today on the campaign trail.</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>LEADING THE DAY:</p>
<p>Joe Biden Joe BidenSome Sanders top allies have urged him to withdraw from 2020 race: report Sunday shows preview: As coronavirus spreads in the U.S., officials from each sector of public life weigh in Trump defends firing of intel watchdog, calling him a &lsquo;disgrace&rsquo; MORE is confronting a unique dilemma: Keeping a media spotlight on his presidential campaign in the midst of an international crisis.</p>
<p>Biden and his aides have raced to put together a media operation from the former vice president&rsquo;s Wilmington, Del., home. Since March 24, he&rsquo;s taken part in nearly a dozen television interviews. And his campaign has rolled out a newsletter, a podcast and a series of virtual roundtables and press briefings.</p>
<p>All told, Biden&rsquo;s digital content generated views from more than 20 million people between March 24-28, his campaign said.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s still hard for him to compete with the power and visibility of the presidency in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak. President Trump Donald John TrumpPelosi eyes end of April to bring a fourth coronavirus relief bill to the floor NBA to contribute 1 million surgical masks to NY essential workers Private equity firm with ties to Kushner asks Trump administration to relax rules on loan program: report MORE&rsquo;s daily briefings are televised across news networks and draw an average audience of about 8.5 million. And a Fox News town hall last month featuring the president drew 4.2 million viewers, making it the most-watched town hall of the 2020 election cycle.</p>
<p>Biden&rsquo;s allies say that&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing. They acknowledge that he can&rsquo;t replicate the kind of megaphone that Trump has as president. Nevertheless, they say he&rsquo;s been strategic about his media presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not going to do a daily press conference to try and achieve parity with Trump,&rdquo; former Rep. Steve Israel Steven (Steve) J. IsraelThe Hill&rsquo;s Campaign Report: Biden struggles to stay in the spotlight Biden fights for attention in coronavirus news cycle The Hill&rsquo;s Campaign Report: Biden offers to talk coronavirus response with Trump MORE (D-N.Y.), who has endorsed Biden, told The Hill this week. &ldquo;That would look overtly political.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doing these shows one by one, doing interviews selectively strikes just the right tone,&rdquo; Israel added. &ldquo;A major speech on coronavirus probably wouldn&rsquo;t be as effective with voters as Joe Biden just being Joe Biden when he&rsquo;s interviewed by talk-show hosts and late-night hosts. That breaks through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other Democrats say that Biden is at his best in less formal settings where he can show off his personality and empathetic manner. Jon Reinish, a Democratic strategist and former aide to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand Kirsten GillibrandThe Hill&rsquo;s Campaign Report: Biden struggles to stay in the spotlight Biden fights for attention in coronavirus news cycle Lawmakers already planning more coronavirus stimulus after T package MORE (D-N.Y.), said that Biden&rsquo;s greatest strength is his ability to reassure a country on edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Americans want to hear relief, strength, authority, a plan, that they will be cared for, and that the person who is delivering the information and in charge cares,&rdquo; Reinish said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one better at delivering that message than Joe Biden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a time when we need a bowl of chicken soup, God, the man is a bowl of chicken soup.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersSome Sanders top allies have urged him to withdraw from 2020 race: report We&rsquo;re at war and need wartime institutions to keep our economy producing what&rsquo;s necessary Larry David: Bernie Sanders should drop out of 2020 race MORE (I-Vt.) calls for $2,000 monthly payments, suspending some bills amid coronavirus, writes Jordain Carney.</p>
<p>FROM THE TRAIL:</p>
<p>A federal judge refused to push back the date of Wisconsin&rsquo;s April 7 presidential primary despite concerns about the coronavirus pandemic but ordered that absentee voting be extended to April 13. John Bowden reports.</p>
<p>Sanders has called on Wisconsin to delay the primary, as stories emerge from the state that paint a portrait of chaos amid the coronavirus. Biden has said he&rsquo;s comfortable with the state holding the election on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers (D) Friday urged the state legislature to allow all-mail voting for the state&rsquo;s primary and accept ballots that are casted through most of next month amid fears about the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel says this is no time to hold a primary election.</p>

Martha McSally Martha Elizabeth McSallyThe Hill&rsquo;s Campaign Report: Biden struggles to stay in the spotlight Democratic super PAC targets McSally over coronavirus response McSally calls on WHO director to step down MORE (R-Ariz.) over her comments about the coronavirus pandemic in a new ad set to air statewide on Fox News and CNN. McSally is in one of the most competitive Senate races in the country this cycle. Rebecca Klar reports.</p>
<p>Conservative political action committee Maggie&rsquo;s List on Friday endorsed 11 female candidates in House races across the country, seeking to gin up support for Republicans as the party seeks to elect more women. Julia Manchester reports.</p>
<p>MARK YOUR CALENDARS:</p>

<p>ONE HOPEFUL THING</p>
<p>Most of the human population in the U.S. is staying at home in an effort to stop the spread of the coronavirus, but animals seem to be having the time of their lives in aquariums across the country.</p>
<p>Take a look at this sloth making new underwater friends at the Texas State Aquarium.</p>
