<p>While the United States is often at the forefront of many trends, it still lags behind the rest of the world in some respects. And one example is the country’s strange reluctance to embrace the bidet toilet seat. Perhaps due to curious culture reasons that probably date back to the Mayflower, Americans still depend on dry and often substandard toilet paper for bathroom needs. Not only is traditional toilet paper harder on our bodies, it’s also harder on the environment. But with toilet paper being a little bit more of a concern these days, it might be time for the country to get on board with the bidet – and there’s no better way for us to do it than with a Tushy bidet toilet seat.</p>
<p>For a limited time, you can get a Tushy Classic brand bidet toilet seat for the special price of $79 — that’s a $20 discount off its regular price. Tushy Classic attaches to virtually any standard toilet and doesn’t require its own water line or electricity. You can install it yourself in about ten minutes, and then spend the rest of eternity wondering how and/or why you ever chose to live without it.</p>
<p>And the Tushy Classic’s benefits aren’t just sanitary in nature. It’s also a boost to health, with hemorrhoids and UTIs among ailments alleviated by regular bidet use.</p>
<p>Maybe one of the reasons Americans have been reluctant to get in on bidets despite the obvious hygienic and health benefits is that we just don’t like the idea of a cold spritz of water so early in the morning. If that applies to you, Tushy has you covered as well, with Tushy Spa bidet toilet seat. For a special limited time price of $109 (another $20 discount), you can enjoy all the cleanliness of regular Tushy Classic, but with an extra temperature control courtesy of the hot water connection on your sink. Who doesn’t crave a little extra warmth in our lives?</p>
<p>Tushy Classic and Tushy Spa are both quick and relatively inexpensive ways to turn your bathroom into one that’s fit of a king or queen. But even on a camping trip in the middle of nowhere, you might find yourself unable to cope with using toilet paper (or, worse, whatever substitute happens to be at hand). With Tushy Travel, a compact go-anywhere outdoor travel bidet, you don’t have to. Its collapsible accordion-like design makes it compact and discreet, and it doesn’t require any batteries or electricity to work. All you have to do is point, squeeze, and spray.</p>
<p>So whether you opt for Tushy Classic, Tushy Spa, or Tushy Travel, your days of relying on toilet paper are coming to an end. Check out Tushy’s bidet toilet seats today, and discover what the rest of the world already knows: there is a better way.

<h3 id="with-a-bidet-tp-shortages-no-longer-scare-the-crap-out-of-us">With a bidet, TP shortages no longer scare the crap out of us</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.heraldnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/21100552_web1_TSR-Bardsley-edh-200329.jpg" alt="img">
This family ordered their new toilet just in time. Now bidets are either sold out or on back-order.</p>
<p>If only I could imitate a French accent. When I tell my husband, “The grocery store was out of toilet paper” in my usual voice, it sounds pedestrian. But if I could say: “Sacre bleu! The toilet paper was gone!” in a dramatic French accent, that would really catch his attention.</p>
<p>When I first understood that COVID-19 was serious, I went to Fred Meyer and bought a typical amount of groceries plus one package of toilet paper. Two weeks ago, I shopped normally again, except I bought a four-pack of disinfectant wipes and a second package of toilet paper. I’m certainly not a hoarder, but I did think ahead. That’s why 1½ weeks ago, I also ordered a bidet, direct from a company called Tushy.</p>
<p>At the time I ordered our Tushy Classic for $79, I had my pick of any Tushy model I wanted. Now they are either sold out or on back-order, and my family’s toilet paper supply is running low. The bidet arrived just in time, or else we’d be harvesting ferns from the back yard.</p>
<p>A big question, though, was where to put it: the downstairs bathroom, the kids’ bathroom or the master bathroom? After a colorful discussion, our family voted for the kids’ bathroom. We didn’t want every Tom, Dick and Harry who used our downstairs bathroom to experiment with it, and the kids explained that their bathroom was the designated location for important business already (which was news to my husband and me but explained why that bathroom ran out of toilet paper so fast).</p>
<p>During this conversation, it also became apparent that my 10-year-old daughter had been relentlessly bombarded with bidet advertisements the past week via YouTube. “If you had dog poop on your arm and you wiped it away with toilet paper would you think your arm was clean?” she asked. “No, of course not. That’s why bidets are so much better.”</p>
<p>“Oui oui,” I said, in my American accent.</p>
<p>“I just hope I can install it,” said my husband.</p>
<p>It turns out, he needn’t have worried. The Tushy Classic is a cold-water bidet, which is barbaric compared to the warm water Tushy Spa version, but easier to install because you don’t have to cut into the bathroom cabinetry to hook up to the hot water under the sink. My husband set up the Tushy in 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Three days and a bag of prunes later, this is what we’ve learned:</p>
<p>Do you still need toilet paper? Yes, because although the Tushy cleans you, it doesn’t dry you off. But since it does such a good job of washing, you cut your TP usage by 95%.</p>
<p>Does it make a mess? Sometimes. You have to fully cover the toilet basin with your derriere, or else water will splash up.</p>
<p>Does it hurt? Only if you crank the water pressure up too high and give yourself an accidental enema. I won’t say which Bardsley learned that lesson the hard way. But, oh mon Dieu, be careful with the dial.</p>

<h3 id="the-best-bidet-deals-for-april-2020-cheap-bidet-toilet-seats">The best bidet deals for April 2020: Cheap bidet toilet seats</h3>
<p><img src="https://icdn4.digitaltrends.com/image/digitaltrends/euroto-toilet-bidet-in-bathroom-1200x630-c-ar1.91.jpg" alt="img">
If you’re like most people, you’ve paid more attention to toilet paper, or the lack thereof, lately than you ever have before. With the recent shortages of paper products, many people are looking for alternative methods to clean themselves after using the toilet. Enter the bidet — these bathroom fixtures have been used for decades in countries like Italy, Portugal, and Spain and believed to have originated in France in the early 1700s. Though historically not as popular in the U.S., these toilets make a lot of sense in terms of cleanliness. But which is the best bidet? If you are open to trying new things and curious, there are some cheap bidet toilet seats available. If you are familiar with bidets and would like to add one to your bathroom, we’ve found some cheap options, too. Check out all of the best bidet deals below.</p>
<p>Today’s best bidet deals</p>
<p>How to choose a bidet</p>
<p>Bidets are not that familiar to most Americans, so choosing the right one for you may prove to be harder than you think. The first thing to consider is money. Although a bidet will save you money in the long run (on the cost of toilet paper), they aren’t a drop in the bucket. A whole unit can cost upwards of $1,000, and the toilet seats aren’t cheap either. The price of the bidet toilet seat or actual bidet is dependent on quite a few factors. The first factor is electric or non-electric. Almost all bidets that are on the cheap side are non-electric and, therefore, run based on the water pressure in your home. Electric bidets are packed with features such as heated seats, increased water pressure that is adjustable, ambient noise that muffles the sounds of nature, and more. Most electric units also come with a remote.</p>
<p>The second factor is water temperature. Almost all bidets offer heated water because cold water on sensitive areas is a no-no. However, the time it takes for the water to come up to a comfortable temperature is the main issue here. Some models have their own tank that holds warm water while other models use your house’s water heater to get the job done.</p>
<p>Self-cleaning nozzles are the next factor to consider. Having the ability to clean the nozzle before using it is a nice feature and feels more sanitary overall. Since some splashing occurs inside the toilet bowl when using it, being able to quickly rinse the nozzle is a definite positive.</p>
<p>Next comes the question of attachment, full seat, or entire fixture. Most attachment bidets are mechanical. If you don’t want an attachment hanging off the side of your toilet, a seat is the way to go. Seats are more expensive than attachments, but some of them offer additional features such as heated seats and slow-close lids. When it comes to a whole fixture, though way more expensive than an attachment or seat, the features are unparalleled. Most of them have heater water and seat with adjustable levels for each, adjustable water pressure, slow-close lid, electronic controls in the form a remote or attached side panel, a nozzle (or multiple nozzles) that has adjustable positions, and more.</p>
