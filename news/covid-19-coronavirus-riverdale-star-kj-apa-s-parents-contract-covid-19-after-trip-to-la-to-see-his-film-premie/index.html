Riverdale star KJ Apa&rsquo;s parents contracted Covid-19 after a trip to Los Angeles, where they attended their son&rsquo;s movie premiere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&ldquo;Honestly I thought I was going to die &hellip; people absolutely need to take this seriously - it&rsquo;s the worst thing I&rsquo;ve ever had,&rdquo; Tupa&rsquo;i Keneti Apa told the Coconet.</p>
<p>Tupa&rsquo;i Keneti Apa, 56 and wife Tessa tested positive for their virus when they returned to New Zealand, the Coconet reported.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;d visited the City of Angels and attended the premiere for son KJ&rsquo;s first film, &ldquo;I Still Believe&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Based on a true story, the film follows Christian music star Jeremy Camp - played by KJ - as he rises to fame and the love story of his first wife amid her later cancer diagnosis.</p>
<p>Apa senior shared his experience with the virus in the hope that it would encourage Pacific communities how crucial it was for big aigas (families) to stay in their bubble.</p>
<p>Tupa&rsquo;i Keneti Apa told The Coconet he first lost his sense of smell and taste on March 13.</p>
<p>The next day he had body aches and a high temperature as he flew home to New Zealand and began to self-isolate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just thought I had the normal flu or bad cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But his condition worsened and he developed a bad cough.</p>
<p>Apa and his wife were tested for Covid-19 at a Remuera clinic on March 20. They both tested positive.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>&ldquo;They called an ambulance and took me to hospital,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was discharged five hours later after assessments and cleared me for bronchitis. However my breathing got worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>‌</p>
<p>Just over a week after first losing his sense of smell and taste, he couldn&rsquo;t breathe at all unless he was lying horizontal.</p>
<p>The day before, his worried wife called an ambulance to their house, Apa said.</p>
<p>He was told he wasn&rsquo;t sick enough to be taken back to the intensive care unit, &ldquo;although at that point my breathing was very laboured&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But Apa is now recovering well, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can now get out of bed and breathe okay for about 30 mins before I have to lie down again. And I can now smell and taste things again. Each day I&rsquo;m feeling a little stronger.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="kj-apa-is-immune-to-his-own-charm">KJ Apa Is Immune To His Own Charm</h3>
<p><img src="https://mtv.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:ao:image:mtv.com:690791?quality=0.8&amp;format=jpg&amp;width=1440&amp;height=810&amp;.jpg" alt="img">

<p>KJ Apa beelines for the coffee as soon as he walks into our interview room at the Four Seasons Beverly Hills. Minutes before, someone came into the room to make sure there was coffee in the pot; minutes after, Apa is spilling milk and apologizing profusely. He just landed in Los Angeles from Vancouver, Canada, where Riverdale films nearly year-round. (Of course, this meetup is happening a week prior to the CW pausing production over COVID-19 concerns.)</p>
<p>“Great start to the day, isn&rsquo;t it?” he jokes. It’s actually 12:30 in the afternoon, but you know how weird time can feel on travel days. Apa can be clumsy and his timing can be wonky; these quirks only add to his charm.</p>
<p>Any fan of the actor is familiar with his brand of charisma, highly visible in his portrayal of Archie Andrews, the amateur vigilante always trying to make his community better. It’s an earnest, do-good appeal, where sometimes he makes mistakes, but his heart is always in the right place. Apa has perfected the persona, even if he insists he can’t see it. He is “extremely critical” of himself, as many actors are. “It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m sitting there watching, going, man, I&rsquo;m charming,” Apa tells MTV News.</p>

<p>It makes perfect sense — we are all our own worst critics — but at the same time, it is a little hard to understand how anyone, Apa included, can avoid staring at the screen, mesmerized by his sweet sincerity. This is apparent in his latest movie, I Still Believe. In the tragic love story, Apa stars as singer-songwriter Jeremy Camp opposite Britt Robertson’s Melissa Henning, who is diagnosed with ovarian cancer shortly after their courtship begins. It&rsquo;s based on the true story of the Grammy-nominated artist and his late first wife, who, on screen, channels her faith to guide her through the crisis, inspiring Jeremy to do the same.</p>
<p>“There were moments where I saw that situation and I asked myself, damn, what would I do in that situation? How would I react?” Apa says. “Jeremy is just&hellip; He truly is a one-of-a-kind human being. When you meet him, you understand it.”</p>
<p>Although he aspires to love intensely and unconditionally, the way his character does throughout the film — “The purest form of love is giving yourself to someone or something and not expecting anything in return,” he says — Apa still has trouble seeing it in himself. He initially turned down the role. It took some coaxing to build his confidence.</p>
<p>His hesitation cropped up in a few places. He worried about the responsibility of telling a true story, and telling it well. “I didn&rsquo;t want to be the guy at the end of the day, if it all turned bad, then I&rsquo;m the guy. It&rsquo;s my face all over it,” he says. And then there was the musicality of the role.</p>

<p>KJ Apa takes the stage as Jeremy Camp.</p>
<p>I know what you’re thinking, because I had the same thought: Apa is a musician — what does he have to be afraid of? He grew up playing the guitar, and he’s been showcasing his talent on Riverdale since Season 1.</p>
<p>“Riverdale is a perfect example of &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a musician,'” Apa says. “But am I particularly enjoying the musical aspects of the project that I&rsquo;m doing? Not really. I have to do it.”</p>
<p>Apa hadn’t dug into Camp’s discography until after he read the script, but now, he’s a fan. As a songwriter and an artist, he calls Camp “amazing,” so in this case, style was less of an issue. Apa just isn’t a singer — definitely not publicly, and not privately, either. “People just … keep forcing me to sing in all these projects.” He’d really rather just play his guitar.</p>
<p>Shania Twain, music legend who plays mom to Apa’s Camp, begs to differ. “He has a natural communication to the audience, to the guitar, so I thought he was amazing,” she told MTV News. And Twain has multiple Diamond-certified albums, dozens of BMI Awards, 5 Grammys, and a slew of other accolades, so that is very high praise.</p>
<p>Still, despite the fact that he’s been acting since he was a teen, stars in the biggest show on the CW, and leads a film of his own, Apa moves to put air quotes around the word “success” when he speaks it, changing course midway through his sentence to instead call them “achievements.”</p>
<p>Michael Kubeisy</p>
<p>Shania Twain and KJ Apa share a mother-son moment.</p>
<p>He doesn’t take any of it too seriously. Sometimes he makes up answers on the spot during interviews, especially those rapid-fire questions. (But, he assures me, he never exaggerates when he talks about the importance of moisturizing.) He feels his best when he’s just acting like a normal person: eating healthy, exercising, playing music, and looking after his friends. He holds a certain disdain for the highlight reel that Instagram has become and the comparisons it often encourages. “That’s not the shit that I care about,” he says. And even though he very much could be one of those people with the ultimate highlight reel, he’s not interested. “At the end of the day, to me, I&rsquo;m living my life. You&rsquo;re living your life. We&rsquo;re all living our lives. We&rsquo;re all humans.”</p>
<p>Apa surrounds himself with people who feel the same way. It helps him stay grounded, and helps him to genuinely enjoy life — and more specifically, his life.</p>
<p>“The real world is right in front of me right now, with you, right now. Present,” he emphasizes. “The real world is not on our phone. It&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on right in front of you.”</p>
<p>The passion with which he says this — while maintaining perfect eye contact, no less — is exactly what makes Apa so damn charming. “I think it’s the truth,” he says. Then, after a brief pause, “But yeah,” he adds, mockingly swapping his native New Zealand accent for an American one. “I guess it&rsquo;s charming.”

<h3 id="why-riverdale-star-kj-apa-says-his-school-was-like-hogwarts">Why ‘Riverdale’ Star KJ Apa Says His School Was Like Hogwarts</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/KJ-Apa-2.jpg" alt="img">
When Riverdale star KJ Apa visited The View to promote his new film, I Still Believe, he talked his past and told the ladies what it was like growing up in New Zealand. But the actor also dropped one little detail that left Harry Potter fans delighted and intrigued. Apa revealed that his school was a lot like Hogwarts, and there’s literally nothing cooler than that.</p>
<p>KJ Apa | Matt Winkelmeyer/VF20/WireImage</p>
<p>KJ Apa is from New Zealand</p>
<p>As Archie Andrews on Riverdale, KJ Apa might look and sound like an all-American boy. But the 22-year-old actor was born and raised in Auckland, New Zealand, and he often goes back there to visit his family and friends.</p>
<p>In a recent interview on The View, Apa talked about his life growing up in New Zealand, and explained why it is so easy for him to pull off an American accent. “I think that’s because we’re constantly bombarded with American content over there when you grow up,” he told Joy Behar. “Like TV, all TV is American [and] music, radio. So, I think it’s easier for us to do it than it would be for you to do a New Zealand or Australian accent.”</p>
<p>Apa also admitted that two of the hardest words for him to say in an American accent are “burger” and “girlfriend,” both of which he says he has to repeat “a lot” on Riverdale.</p>
<p>The ‘Riverdale’ star went to a Hogwarts-style boarding school in Auckland</p>
<p>On The View, when asked about his childhood and passion for acting, Apa said that he never did theater in school because he was more interested in “music, and rugby, and accounting.” The actor then revealed how his boarding school, King’s College Auckland, is similar to Hogwarts.</p>
<p>There’s a fantastic crowd building here at King’s College with just 15 minutes until kick-off #KingsVsGrammar #rugbykings pic.twitter.com/0DkVEJZPO0 — King&rsquo;s College (@KingsCollegeAk) June 16, 2018</p>
<p>“My school was very like Hogwarts-y,” said Apa. “There were like different houses, and you had to compete with your house. You had colors you had to wear, like five different uniforms. It was pretty trippy.”</p>
<p>Looking through King’s College Auckland’s website and Instagram account, you can count notable similarities with Hogwarts. Sure, the school doesn’t offer potions classes and there’s no Quidditch. But it does have different houses, a majestic chapel, and competitive Rugby which the whole school participates in.</p>
<p>Plus, students are required to wear uniforms, some of which include Gryffindor-style crimson and gold ties. In a post on King College’s Twitter page, students are dressed in their uniforms gearing up to watch a school Rugby game. Minus the robes, it looks just like a Quidditch stadium scene from Harry Potter.</p>
<p>KJ Apa even confirmed his Hogwarts house</p>
<p>KJ Apa already has a scar on his forehead. And now, with his Hogwarts-like school history, it makes you wonder how many things he has in common with the boy wizard. Well, in a fan Q &amp; A session during Melbourne’s Oz Comic Con in 2018, the Riverdale star did mention that he’d like to be in the same house as Harry himself.</p>
<p>When a fan asked the question, Apa revealed his Hogwart’s house and then took it upon himself to sort costar Cole Sprouse as well. “I reckon I’d be in Gryffindor, I reckon,” said Apa. “Is that the one Harry Potter’s in? And I think [Cole] would be in Slytherin.”
