After six seasons on Starz, Power came to a close with drug kingpin James &lsquo;Ghost&rsquo; St Patrick (played by Omari Hardwick) murdered by his own son Tariq (Michael Rainey Jr) in his nightclub Truth. The ending was divisive, to say the least, in no small part thanks to a series of leaks the final episode suffered, but now fans have taken issue with something Tariq said in his last moments with his father. BACK BRITAIN&rsquo;S BRAVE NHS HEROES - CLICK HERE NOW</p>
<p>Having finally had enough of his father&rsquo;s behaviour and impact on his life, Tariq headed to Truth to shoot Ghost in the series finale. In his head, Tariq had plotted to kill his dad and frame his nemesis Dre (Rotimi) for the crime. Ultimately, however, it was his mum Tasha (Naturi Naughton) who ended up taking the fall and facing a life behind bars while her son went off to college. While the questionable series of events after Ghost&rsquo;s death has already left some viewers baffled, it&rsquo;s Tariq&rsquo;s speech to his dad before taking his life which has angered some further.

<p>READ MORE Power dealt devastating blow after season 6 finale Tariq and Ghost were alone in Truth when he pulled the gun on his dad. Taken aback, Ghost said to his son: &ldquo;What the hell do you think you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo; Tariq then reeled off why he was about to take the drastic action: &ldquo;Because you - you&rsquo;re gonna turn Ma in for LaKeisha. You&rsquo;re gonna turn me in for Ray Ray. &ldquo;When the f*** you gonna pay for all the bulls*** you&rsquo;ve done, huh Dad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Power plot hole: Tariq shot his own dad</p>
<p>Despite Ghost&rsquo;s pleas, Tariq continued: &ldquo;Up to now, you still don&rsquo;t see me for who I really am. I&rsquo;m you, Dad. &ldquo;I tried to give you one last chance like you said you did to Breeze, but you&rsquo;re in the way. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in the way of my future the way he was in the way of yours.&rdquo; Moments later Tariq pulled the trigger and killed his father but it&rsquo;s the &lsquo;Breeze&rsquo; segment of his speech some fans are baffled by.</p>
<p>Exposing the possible plot hole, Reddit user BussDownGlowing2020 asks: &ldquo;So I just finished binge-watching all seasons of Power and a few things do not make sense to me, maybe you guys can clear it up for me, &ldquo;Why does Tariq want to be in the game so bad even though he is rich?? &ldquo;At the end, Tariq said he is killing Ghost cause he is getting in his way like he killed Breeze years earlier. Ghost sold drugs and killed Breeze cause his plan was to be rich enough to stop having to deal drugs and live a comfortable lifestyle. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Tariq&rsquo;s &lsquo;end plan&rsquo;?? He is already rich and he could easily have been even more well off with Ghost living.&rdquo; DON&rsquo;T MISS:</p>

If you&rsquo;ve been following the Merc with the Mouth&rsquo;s tasks this season then you&rsquo;ll want to know where the Fortnite Recruitment Poster locations are, so you can draw all over them with your big black marker. This entry in the Fortnite Deadpool challenges sends you out to deface three GHOST or SHADOW recruitment posters, and although there&rsquo;s a decent number of them around the island a lot of them are tucked away so you may not stumble across them by accident. We&rsquo;ve been on the campaign trail in Fortnite to search out all of these motivational displays and save you the leg work, so if you want to add the Deadpool wrap to your locker in Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 2, then check out where you can deface Fortnite recruitment posters.</p>

<p>On the map above we&rsquo;ve marked all of the Fortnite recruitment poster locations we&rsquo;ve discovered, and as you can see they are well distributed around the island with options in every named location. As with most challenges in the game, you can deface GHOST or SHADOW recruitment posters over multiple matches until you ruin three in total, but if you&rsquo;re looking for a quick route for ticking them all off in one go then here are couple of options:</p>
<p>Frenzy Farm - there are Fortnite SHADOW recruitment posters on the west side of the small red barn and the southeast corner of the main house in F4, and the southeast corner of the large red barn in F4.</p>
<p>Weeping Woods - there are Fortnite GHOST recruitment posters on the east side of the main building in D5, on the east side of the toilet building south of the campground in D6, and two more on the north and east sides of the GHOST house just east of Weeping Woods in D5.</p>
