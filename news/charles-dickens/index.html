<p>When Charles Dickens died on June 9, 1870, newspapers on both sides of the Atlantic framed his loss as an event of national and international mourning. They pointed to the fictional characters Dickens had created as a key part of his artistic legacy, writing how “we have laughed with Sam Weller, with Mrs Nickleby, with Sairey Gamp, with Micawber”.</p>
<p>Dickens himself had already featured as the subject of one piece of short biographical fiction published during his lifetime. Yet, in the years following his death, he would be increasingly appropriated as a fictional character by the Victorians, both in published texts and in privately circulated fan works.</p>
<p>Dickens’s private family funeral at Westminster Abbey created a gap in knowledge which some journalists chose to fill with a fictional scene they considered more emotionally satisfying. The London Penny Illustrated Paper visually re-imagined the funeral, publishing a large illustration depicting a crowded public event.</p>
<p>Under the sub-heading: A National Honour Due to Charles Dickens, the accompanying text acknowledges that the image is fictional, but argues that: “A ceremony such as is depicted in our Engraving would unquestionably have best represented the national feeling of mourning occasioned by the lamented death.’</p>
<p>It was the publication of John Forster’s Life of Charles Dickens in 1872–’74, though, that marked a watershed in fictionalisations of Dickens. Victorian readers now had a full-length birth-to-death Dickens biography to draw on, written by a friend who had known him for his entire adulthood. Dickens’s Preface to his 1849–’50 novel David Copperfield had encouraged readers to interpret it as semi-autobiographical. However, it was only with Forster’s biography that the full extent of the similarities between Dickens and the fictional Copperfield was made public.</p>
<p>The revelation that Dickens had performed child labour in a blacking warehouse when his father was imprisoned for debt, before rising to international fame in his 20s, gave him a life story that the press described as rivalling Dickens’s “most popular novel”.</p>
<p>Rags to riches</p>
<p>The Household Edition of Forster’s Life, published by Chapman &amp; Hall in 1879, included 28 new illustrations of the biography by Fred Barnard. Among them was an emotive image of Dickens as a young boy in the blacking warehouse.</p>

<p>Dickens wrote a private account of this time, for which Forster’s biography is our only remaining source. In this autobiographical fragment, Dickens describes how he was brought down to work among other boys in the warehouse. He was careful not to let them see his suffering, and to make sure that he worked as hard as them. Yet what Barnard pictures is a scene of solitude, visible despair or perhaps exhaustion at the warehouse that is not described in this fragment. The image bears a closer resemblance to Dickens’s fictionalisation of the first day at the warehouse in David Copperfield.</p>
<p>In the novel, the young Copperfield writes that: “I mingled my tears with the water in which I was washing the [blacking] bottles.” Barnard heightens and externalises the private emotion that Dickens wrote about in the autobiographical fragment to create a fictional scene. In doing so, he further blurs the boundaries between Dickens and the fictional Copperfield.</p>
<p>The practice of Grangerisation – the art of extending and customising a published book with inserted material – was popular among Victorian readers. Additional fictionalised illustrations of Dickens’s life, created by the Dickens illustrator Frederick W Pailthorpe, are revealed in a 14-volume Grangerization of Forster’s Life, held in the British Library.</p>
<p>Some of these seem to have been created for personal interest and private circulation among fellow Dickens enthusiasts, rather than for publication. One sketch shows Dickens as a boy making a low bow to a friend of his father’s.</p>
<p>This image is based on an incident which Forster describes as taking place at the blacking warehouse where Dickens worked. Yet Pailthorpe’s illustration fictionalises the location of the event, transposing the young Dickens to the front of the house of John Dryden, the former poet laureate next to whom Dickens would eventually be buried in Westminster Abbey. In doing so, Pailthorpe creates a narrative in which Dickens was always destined for literary greatness.</p>
<p>Biographical fiction</p>
<p>In the 21st century, readers have commented on the resemblances between the fictional stories which the young Brontë siblings wrote about real-life contemporary figures such as the Duke of Wellington, and 20th and 21st-century forms of fan fiction. Oscar Wilde’s 1889 story, The Portrait of Mr WH, focuses on a series of men whose biographical speculations about the life of Shakespeare verge on fictionalisation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, recent scholarly work on biographical fiction has described it as coming into being “mainly in the 20th century”. Press articles on the form of fan fiction known as “real person fiction” have largely focused on it as a product of internet culture, while noting briefly that many of Shakespeare’s plays also fictionalise real-life figures.</p>
<p>Archival work on the Victorian press, and on semi-private forms of reader response such as Grangerised books, can flesh out our understanding of the role that biographical fictionalisation played in Victorian culture. It demonstrates a longer and more varied history of the human desire to appropriate and imaginatively recreate famous contemporary figures. And it shows that part of Dickens’s creative legacy, as well as his own works, was the fictional forms that his life inspired others to create.</p>

<h3 id="worst-of-times-why-charles-dickens-would-have-hated-lockdown">&ldquo;Worst of times: why Charles Dickens would have hated lockdown&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bdf86371651f9c79a2d6c6e450c90cd26b5e37d/81_66_5277_3168/master/5277.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=b690068f68d5cbf6aec408477553ab28" alt="img">
It is hard to imagine anyone less suited to living with any kind of restraint than Charles Dickens. Especially, I think, the hyperactive Dickens of 1857, the year he turned 45. By the last days of the summer, he had already written, staged and starred in his own play in London and Manchester; bought, renovated and moved into the house of his childhood dreams in Gad’s Hill, in the village of Higham, Kent; and taken trips to Brighton and Southampton, where he waved his 16-year-old son on to a troopship bound for India.</p>
<p>In the May he had finished his latest novel, Little Dorritt, and in June had given his first-ever public readings (a crowd of 2,000 turned up to hear him declaim and weep his way through A Christmas Carol). Editing his monthly magazine was also keeping him busy, as was his charity for homeless women. Dozens of letters flowed.</p>

<p>And still he burned and suffocated and paced the London streets, often through the night. On 29 August, he wrote to his friend Wilkie Collins, begging him to come away, it didn’t matter where. I want to “escape from myself”, he scrawled – as if that were ever possible. Collins suggested Norfolk, but Dickens (all of a sudden no longer relaxed about their destination) insisted on going to the Lake District. He wanted “moors and bleak places”, he wrote, but in truth what he wanted was to get to Doncaster, where 18-year-old actress Ellen Ternan was appearing with her mother and sisters at the Theatre Royal.</p>
<p>Dickens and Collins got lost in fog on Carrock Fell, and Collins sprained his ankle, badly, but Dickens dragged him to Doncaster, and stuffed him into a hotel room to recover while he entertained Ellen and her mother at the races. He won large, jumping up and down at the “coming-in” – the last turn behind the brow of the hill – and marvelled at the scale of the grandstand, “rising against the sky with its vast tiers of little white dots of faces, and its last high rows and corners of people, looking like pins stuck into an enormous pin-cushion”.</p>
<p>The image of a packed racetrack seething with spectators has a different resonance today. Our lockdown started late and is ending – or not – in confusion. I doubt Dickens would have coped well with this uncertainty, but who does? We are trapped in the back of a car on a long, dark journey, and the world’s worst parents keep telling us every few miles that we are nearly there. Surely they know that those words, at this stage, are a trigger for rage and despair?</p>

<p>The Dickens of 1857 would have had trouble enduring lockdown. He went home after his trip to Doncaster and set about tearing apart his own life, closing his magazine, selling his London home and divorcing his wife Catherine with shocking vindictiveness. But we can still lose ourselves in his adventures in the Lake District (he wrote that Skiddaw in particular had “vaunted himself a great deal more than his merits deserve”) and the roiling excitement of a day at the races. It’s all there (including his thinly disguised pursuit of Ellen Ternan) in the book he wrote with Collins, The Lazy Tour of Two Idle Apprentices.</p>
<p>Even on that seemingly carefree jaunt to the Lakes and then Doncaster, Dickens was starting to look older than his years; he died 13 years later, on 9 June 1870, aged 58, struck dumb and then dead by a stroke (not his first). He had never stopped writing, of course, but nor had he ever been able to stay still for long. He crisscrossed the country, giving talks and readings, feasting on the rapturous crowds. He toured America. He wrote some of his greatest books even as the darkness spread. His last novel, The Mystery of Edwin Drood, was left half-finished on his desk in the garden chalet at Gad’s Hill.</p>
<p>And on the morning before he finally collapsed, Dickens dropped into the Sir John Falstaff pub in Higham (still there, opposite his former home) and cashed a cheque with the landlord for £22. Most of the money might have been for Ellen Ternan, who by then was living in Peckham, south-east London. Because as far as Dickens was concerned, on that sunny June morning 150 years ago, life was going on just as it always had.</p>

<p>Charles Dickens is one of Britain&rsquo;s most famous authors.</p>
<p>His writing includes books such as Oliver Twist and A Christmas Carol - books that are still very widely read today.</p>
<p>He wrote about things that many people before him had avoided writing about, like the lives of poorer people.</p>
<p>He died in 1870, making 2020 the 150th anniversary of his death, so we thought we&rsquo;d take a look at who Charles Dickens was, and why his books were so influential.</p>
<p>Who was Charles Dickens?</p>
<p>Getty Images Charles Dickens</p>
<p>Charles John Huffam Dickens was born in 1812, in Portsmouth on England&rsquo;s south coast, and was one of eight children. His family moved around though, and he grew up in London and Kent.</p>
<p>When Charles was 12 his father was sent to prison because of financial problems. This meant Charles had to go to work, and he got a job at a shoe polish factory pasting the labels on to bottles.</p>
<p>Did you know? Charles himself was a father to 10 children!</p>
<p>Many experts have said this period in his life had a lot of influence on the stories he went on to write.</p>
<p>What did Dickens write?</p>
<p>Getty Images</p>
<p>Charles Dickens wrote 15 novels, five novellas and hundreds of short stories.</p>
<p>Novels like Oliver Twist, Great Expectations and A Tale of Two Cities are still sold today.</p>
<p>Some books you might recognise: A Christmas Carol</p>
<p>Great Expectations</p>
<p>Oliver Twist</p>
<p>A tale of two cities</p>
<p>But his most famous work is probably A Christmas Carol. It was first published just before Christmas in 1943, and its first print of 6,000 copies sold out in just 8 days.</p>
<p>The story of Ebenezer Scrooge learning about the spirit of Christmas is still well known and the BBC made a new television adaptation of it just last year.</p>
<p>Oliver Twist was turned into a musical that is still being performed now, and there have been several film versions of Great Expectations.</p>
<p>Away from television adaptations and stage shows, many people still read his books. They have never been &lsquo;out-of-print,&rsquo; which means, even all these years later, book shops are selling enough copies to need new ones printed.</p>
<p>What made him different from other writers of his time?</p>
<p>Getty Images</p>
<p>Dickens wrote about topics that lots of other authors ignored.</p>
<p>He wrote a lot about people who lived in poverty, who were ill, or who had to fight for their place in society - a lot like he had to do as child.</p>
<p>Change begets change. Nothing propagates so fast. Charles Dickens</p>
<p>Many of his characters were based on real people and their lives. That made people understand his stories more, and reflect on what Britain was like at that time.</p>
<p>He was often challenging and spoke out about laws he didn&rsquo;t agree on, especially the &lsquo;new poor law,&rsquo; a law the British Library describes as an attempt to, &ldquo;slash expenditure on poverty.&rdquo; Dickens thought the law was harsh, and that poor people needed help, not to be forced to work in awful conditions in factories.</p>
<p>Charles Dickens was a journalist when the law was being introduced and worked hard to make sure newspapers told people what was happening in parliament. He went on to use his books to speak out about the system and promoted change - and it worked.</p>
<p>How is he remembered today?</p>
<p>Getty Images Dickens began his writing career in Westminster as a journalist</p>
<p>Dickens is still regarded as one of Britain&rsquo;s greatest ever authors - he even had his image used on the ten pound note.</p>
<p>However, he is also remembered as a great pioneer who pushed for real changes in society.</p>
<p>Did you know? The term Dickensian is often used to describe poor social conditions that are similar to the sort of things Charles Dickens described in his novels.</p>
<p>His books are still affecting authors today and he has a museum dedicated to him and there is a statue of him in Portsmouth, where he was born.</p>
<p>Have you read any of his books or seen film adaptations? What did you think? Let us know in the comments.

<h3 id="charles-dickens-using-data-analysis-to-shed-new-light-on-old-characters">&ldquo;Charles Dickens: using data analysis to shed new light on old characters&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/340130/original/file-20200605-176554-1vv6h04.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;rect=0%2C9%2C720%2C360&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1356&amp;h=668&amp;fit=crop" alt="img">
Dickens created some of the best-known characters in fiction. The likes of Ebenezer Scrooge, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield are still well-remembered, 150 years after his death – and are regularly updated through new stage and screen adaptions. One of the reasons why his characters have become part of popular culture is Dickens’s ability to exaggerate and caricature but at the same time also deeply understand human character.</p>
<p>Behaviours that he describes in his novels still resonate today, as in a recent comment by a political editor who describes a lack of decisive action on coronavirus as a “Micawberish conviction in government that something would turn up”, in reference to Dickens’s memorable comic hero and unshakeable optimist in David Copperfield.</p>
<p>Read more: David Copperfield on screen: Charles Dickens&rsquo; masterpiece is a celebration of everyday heroes</p>
<p>The striking and individualising features of his characters have received much critical and popular attention. Yet, crucial to Dickens’s authorial techniques – and hence the public’s love of his characters – is also the description of conventional ways of behaving. Common features make fictional people more like normal people. As with anything in life, we don’t quite notice what’s “normal” until it isn’t any more.</p>
<p>This is where digital methods come in. Treating Dickens’s novels as a dataset makes it possible to identify patterns based on formal repetitions and frequencies – the type of information we are not consciously aware of when we a read a novel.</p>
<p>A common stance</p>
<p>Analysing Dickens’s novels as one single dataset (or “corpus”) shows us that, as in normal life, a type of common behaviour is that people often have or put their hands in their pockets, as Fledgeby in Our Mutual Friend.</p>
<p>‘But why’, said Fledgeby, putting his hands in his pockets and counterfeiting deep meditation, ‘why Riah should have started up, when I told him that the Lammles entreated him to hold over a Bill of Sale has has on all their effects.’</p>
<p>When we read a novel, such a description can easily go unnoticed. Why would we pay particular attention to what people do with their hands – unless it is clearly meaningful.</p>
<p>It’s the same in real life – we would not normally pick up on body language, unless it strikes us as unusual and unfamiliar. But looking at several novels at the same time makes patterns of repeated and commonly occurring behaviours more clearly visible.</p>
<p>This can be achieved with the help of a “concordance” tool that displays all occurrences of a word or phrase with a specified amount of context to the left and right. Below is a sample from a concordance for the phrase “his hands in his pockets” in Dickens’s novels, retrieved with the free web application CLiC.</p>
<p><a href="https://clic.bham.ac.uk">CLiC</a> , Author provided</p>
<p>Importantly, it is not only Dickens who depicts such everyday behaviour. We find examples in other 19th-century fiction, too:</p>
<p>Mr. Earnshaw vouchsafed no answer. He walked up and down, with his hands in his pockets, apparently quite forgetting my presence; and his abstraction was evidently so deep, and his whole aspect so misanthropical. Emily Brontë, Wuthering Heights He sauntered on, with his hands in his pockets, humming the chorus of a comic song.</p>
<p>Wilkie Collins, Armadale</p>
<p>While such phrases often appear circumstantial rather than central to plot or character, they fulfil important functions in drawing the reader into the text. The description of conventional behaviour makes fictional people more like real people, subtly creating a link between what the reader knows about how people “normally” behave or how fictional people are generally depicted across novels.</p>
<p>What, however, is the norm that we measure fictional characters against? Behaviours and body language change over time. So it is little surprise that in the 19th century it was mainly men who were described with their hands in their pockets.</p>
<p>Depicting power</p>
<p>Exploiting conventions and subtleties also enabled Dickens to draw attention to exceptional behaviours. Another common pattern of body language that occurs across 19th-century fiction is men standing with their back to the fire, a pose connected to power and confidence of the man of the house.</p>
<p>In Dickens, we also find a woman, Mrs Pipchin (in Dombey and Son), who is depicted in a situation where she stands with her back to the fire. This is no coincidence. As a widow, Mrs Pipchin looks after herself, and the way in which she runs her boarding house for children does not show her to be a character who displays stereotypical, female qualities.</p>
<p>… and Mrs Pipchin, with her back to the fire, stood, reviewing the new-comers, like an old soldier.</p>
<p>Dombey and Son</p>
<p>The interplay of norms and deviations from norms also becomes apparent in the wide range of body language references that Dickens uses. References to eyes are generally common in fiction, as can be shown with frequency data retrieved by tools like CLiC. Typical patterns we find in Dickens (and elsewhere) concern the direction and duration of gaze.</p>
<p>‘And what’, said Mr Pecksniff, turning his eyes on Tom Pinch, even more placidly and gently than before, ‘what have YOU been doing, Thomas, humph?’</p>
<p>Martin Chuzzlewit</p>
<p>Body parts that are less frequent are teeth. So using teeth in a similar way to eyes makes these body parts a more strikingly characterising feature.</p>
<p>‘May I be allowed, Madam,’ said Carker, turning his white teeth on Mrs Skewton like a light – ‘a lady of your excellent sense and quick feeling will give me credit.’</p>
<p>Dombey and Son</p>
<p>With Dickens’s ability to both create individualised, memorable characters as well as subtly connect to our experience of encountering people more generally, his novels still speak to readers today.</p>
<p>The contexts in which modern readers interact with the texts have changed, and in today’s digital world we can draw on new tools to view and understand the people Dickens has given us. After 150 years, we not only remember Dickens’s fictional characters, but we can still find out more about them.

<h3 id="charles-dickens-and-the-push-for-literacy-in-victorian-britain">&ldquo;Charles Dickens and the push for literacy in Victorian Britain&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/340636/original/file-20200609-21201-vlm05j.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;rect=5%2C396%2C1000%2C499&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1356&amp;h=668&amp;fit=crop" alt="img">
Such is the aura still surrounding Charles Dickens that it is no surprise readers want to mark the 150th anniversary of his death in June 1870, even in the middle of a desperate global public health crisis.</p>
<p>While this impulse to show one’s admiration of – and gratitude to – deceased writers is fairly commonplace, it’s much rarer to consider the conditions that enable people to read at all. One of the events of 1870 that will probably not be treated to the same attention in the UK as Dickens’s death, but should be remembered alongside him, was the passing of the Education Act.</p>
<p>Mandating new partially state-funded board schools to be built in areas where provision of elementary education was insufficient, the legislation established the principle of a statutory responsibility for schooling, and helped achieve the rapid rise in UK literacy rates seen in the latter decades of the 19th century. Between 1851 and 1900, there was a rise in British male literacy from 69.3% to 97.2%, while for the female part of the population, the improvement in literacy rates was even more pronounced, from 54.8% to 96.8%.</p>
<p>The legacies of the Education Act – also called the Forster Act after W. E. Forster, who drafted the bill – are multiple, given the importance of mass reading and writing to the functioning of democracy. Perhaps most visible of them is the collection of still-used school buildings dotted around Britain’s cities that date from the decade following this legislation.</p>
<p>Dickens famously used his pen throughout his career as a tool for campaigning with and writing about a huge number of topical issues, from inhumane welfare reform to parliamentary corruption, but education was one of his most consistent concerns. In Nicholas Nickleby, his depiction of the abusive Dotheboys Hall exposed the Yorkshire boarding school industry as a national disgrace. Later, in Hard Times, Dickens raised the problem of an overly utilitarian curriculum – with no space for imaginative learning or play.</p>
<p>The author gave speeches for working-class adult education facilities, such as the Manchester Athenaeum, and visited Ragged Schools – charities that taught the poor before the government assumed responsibility for their education.</p>
<p>While Dickens had some anxieties about the overly religious syllabus in some of these philanthropic schools, he wrote articles exhorting his readership to support them nonetheless, while making it clear that their existence was a marker of the state’s “frightful neglect” of “those … whom it might, as easily and less expensively, instruct”.</p>
<p>Literacy as theme</p>
<p>Dickens also made the problem of illiteracy a major theme of his fiction. Many of his characters are semi-literate, while others have no reading ability at all. Jo the crossing sweeper from Bleak House, who dies from the same infectious disease that the heroine Esther Summerson survives, is one of Dickens’s completely illiterate characters. His inability to decipher the signs that saturate the city in which he lives makes him especially vulnerable to exploitation.</p>
<p>When Dickens’s non-reading characters get the chance to correct their disadvantage, they often take it. In Our Mutual Friend, the illiterate servant Mr Boffin suddenly becomes wealthy and swiftly hires someone to teach him how to read.</p>
<p>Dickens did not see literacy as a panacea for all the ills of his unequal society – and he warned against the dangers of teaching some but leaving others uneducated. In Our Mutual Friend, literacy drives a wedge between the non-reader Lizzie Hexam and her brother, Charlie, whose personality is clearly tainted rather than enhanced by his encounter with the education system.</p>
<p>A similar estrangement happens between Pip and his brother-in-law, Joe Gargery, in Great Expectations. In both cases, it is the non-schooled characters who retain their moral compass, while their literate loved ones become prey to the seductions of social prestige and a concomitant self-disgust for their roots.</p>

<p>Great Expectations includes an episode that looks back to the very start of the narrator Pip’s literacy, in which he composes his first, orthographically unorthodox letter:</p>
<p>Alex Brenchley , Author provided</p>
<p>Pip’s coming to literacy is not merely ornamental to Great Expectations, and his early bad prose isn’t exhibited among the refined words of the narrator’s mature self just for the sake of comic value. After all, if Pip hadn’t learned to read and write we would never hear his story.</p>
<p>Radical reading</p>
<p>Unlike many in his time, Dickens saw that improving literacy had nothing to do with teaching the poor morals and everything to do with empowering them. His continual emphasis on learning to read was a key part of that democratic radicalism which made him popularly loved but drew criticism from conservatives such as Anthony Trollope, who satirised his rival as “Mr Popular Sentiment”.</p>
<p>It is because Dickens implicitly recognised literacy as a political issue that the revolutionary Marxist William Morris included a lover of Dickens’s novels nicknamed Boffin in his News from Nowhere, a novel that imagines a 22nd-century London after its transformation into utopia.</p>
<p>Real-life working-class readers paid homage to Dickens too, in the decades following the Education Act. As Jonathan Rose, a historian of reading, insists, Dickens was the most popular author in typical working-class communities – and may have even been a source of political radicalisation for working-class readers, when other kinds of reading were less accessible.

<h3 id="the-mystery-of-charles-dickens-by-an-wilson-review--a-great-writers-dark-side">&ldquo;The Mystery of Charles Dickens by AN Wilson review – a great writer&rsquo;s dark side&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd7274f3fe47ed341212a4001a606b0b74caa465/673_0_3315_1989/master/3315.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=ecfdda562606bfc6eccb927e4b563b5a" alt="img">
Near the end of The Mystery of Charles Dickens, AN Wilson quotes at length from a letter written by Philip Larkin to his lover Monica Jones. The poet has just reread Great Expectations, and is reflecting on the novelist’s attention-seeking tricks: “Say what you like about Dickens as an entertainer, he cannot be considered a real writer at all; not a real novelist.” It is a version of a complaint that has been made many times about Dickens the mere “entertainer”. “His is the garish, gaslit, melodramatic barn … where the yokels gape.” Yet, at the end of all his sentences of critical deprecation, Larkin’s final reflex is equally familiar: “However, I much enjoyed G.E. &amp; may try another soon.”</p>
<p>Those with high literary standards have often enjoyed Dickens against their better judgment. In The Mystery of Charles Dickens, Wilson sides with the gaping yokels. He confesses the he has read Dickens with “obsessive rapture” since his childhood, but had to overcome the presumption, later educated into him, that his writing was insufficiently deep or sophisticated. “The death of Paul Dombey is so schmaltzy that we simply refuse to be moved, but then, damn it, we read and the tears well down our cheeks.” For Wilson, Dickens is an irresistible performer. One chapter of his book is devoted to “The Mystery of the Public Readings”, in which Dickens drove himself to near collapse (and made huge amounts of money) by touring America as well as Britain to perform readings from his work. In 1869, he had a stroke on stage in Chester, but still refused to stop the readings, partly because of the money but mostly because he was addicted to the instant responsiveness of his audience.</p>

<p>The highlight of his show was Bill Sikes’s murder of Nancy from Oliver Twist, in which, Wilson thinks, the novelist released some demonic aspect of himself – some yen for sexual violence – on stage. Murderous villains such as the gleefully sadistic Quilp in The Old Curiosity Shop, or the psychopathic John Jasper in The Mystery of Edwin Drood, were projections of his own cruelty. Wilson’s book is, you might say, bio-critical: “Dickens’s novels tell the story over and over again of his divided self,” he writes. The secrets of his life lie on the surface of his fiction. The dust jacket proclaims that the book goes “beyond standard narrative biography”. Which is to say that The Mystery of Charles Dickens does not reveal anything the previous biographers have not told us (indeed, it is conscientiously reliant on a small number of secondary sources). Instead, it shows, by a mixture of rational inference and I-feel-it-in-my-bones intuition, how the most powerful aspects of Dickens’s fiction drew on the most painful and secret aspects of his life.</p>
<p>The biggest secret of Dickens’s life, of course, was his clandestine relationship with Ellen (“Nelly”) Ternan, the young actor whom he first met when she performed at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester in The Frozen Deep, a play that he had written with his friend Wilkie Collins, and in which he himself was acting. She was 18; he was 45. For the next 13 years, Dickens paid for her to live in a series of discreetly located residences, where he would secretly visit her. The last of these was Windsor Lodge in Peckham, then a pleasant village outside London, with a railway station on the line from Dickens’s Kent home.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;seizure&rsquo; that killed Dickens must have been induced by energetic sex, the dying novelist was then driven to his Kent home</p>
<p>Each chapter of Wilson’s book is a different “Mystery”, the first being what happened to most of the £22 for which Dickens cashed a cheque on the day before his death. Dickens must have given it to Nelly for housekeeping. Which means that he must have made a quick trip to Peckham and that the “seizure” that killed him must have been induced by some hyper-energetic sex with her. Which means that hasty measures must have been taken to heave the dying novelist into a carriage to be driven back to his Kent home. “Exit Nelly, stage left.” (This enjoyable fiction, which has been hazarded by others before Wilson, is partly withdrawn near the end of the book.)</p>
<p>Next is “The Mystery of his Childhood”. Wilson is hardly the first to suggest that Dickens’s fiction was shaped by what he calls “the grotesquely sad galanty show of his childhood”. He briskly takes us through the story of the penury, the period in the debtors’ prison, the aborted education, the banishment, aged 10, to menial labour in Warren’s Blacking warehouse. There is less stress than usual on the improvidence of Dickens’s father, John Dickens (whose self-relishing orotundity at least inspired the matchless idiolect of Mr Micawber). Instead, Dickens blamed his mother. The ludicrous (Mrs Nickleby) or monstrous (Mrs Clennam) mothers in his novels bear the imprint of “the deepest needs of mother-hate”. Wilson asserts that “his flawed relationship with his mother is the defining feature, of the man and of his art”. Yet his privations made him a great novelist. The Blacking warehouse “saved Dickens the novelist, just as grammar school and Cambridge would have destroyed him”.</p>
<p>We should be grateful Dickens was so screwed up. Great Expectations, Wilson believes, was a masterpiece of self-torment</p>
<p>Then there is “The Mystery of the Cruel Marriage”. Nothing has more tainted Dickens’s reputation than his public repudiation (via an advertisement in the Times) of his wife, Kate, who had borne him 10 children and suffered all his demands for 22 years. Wilson’s house, he tells us, overlooks the back garden of 70 Gloucester Crescent, Camden Town, whence Catherine Dickens was exiled, with the company of only one of her children, Charley, their eldest son. The others were forbidden to see her. We have found out recently that Dickens tried to have her certified insane, so that she would be put in an asylum. Not only did he want to be free to pursue an affair with Nelly Ternan, he wanted somehow to declare that it was all his blameless wife’s fault. He was the wounded party.</p>
<p>But all the fury and resentment that he felt towards first his mother, and then his wife, inspired his greatest fiction, Wilson thinks. We should be grateful that he was so screwed up. Great Expectations, he believes, was a masterpiece of self-torment, formed from his own ruthlessness, his hunger for money and status, his family hatreds – all handed down to the novel’s narrator, Pip. “A helpful course of cognitive therapy, such as our contemporaries would have urged on a middle-aged man who had just visited such absolute mayhem on his wife and children” would have destroyed his creativity. Just as Pip owed his fortune to a violent criminal, Magwitch, its author owed his lucrative brilliance to “a secret, violent criminal”: himself. Or rather, the dark and nasty secret self that he never consciously acknowledged.</p>
<p>Wilson concedes all the contradictions and hypocrisies anatomised by John Carey in his brilliant, often openly exasperated study of Dickens, The Violent Effigy – but forgives him. Dickens had to contend with the “vast, smoky, cruel, boundlessly energetic, steel-hearted nineteenth century”, which made him variously cruel and sentimental. He was, after all, a nobody, who had grown up “with nuffink”. Alone among all great writers of the 19th century, he had “not merely looked over into the abyss. He had lived in it.” His lifelong insecurity was another creative asset.</p>
<p>If you are a Dickens aficionado, you will think that much of the book’s biographical narrative is well-known material, though here revisited in a sprightly manner. Yet its last, highly personal section suddenly shifts your sense of Wilson’s commitment to his subject. In his final chapter, he remembers first encountering episodes from Dickens at the age of eight or nine at his private school, which was “in effect a concentration camp run by sexual perverts”. The teacher who introduced him to Dickens was himself utterly sinister and Dickensian, the skill with which he impersonated Fagin and Squeers “all too convincing”. The shards of Dickens sustained his spirits among the privations and abuse visited on him by the paedophile headmaster and his monstrous wife, uninhibited sadists in Wilson’s vivid, detailed account. After this, nothing would convince him that Dickens should be condescended to as insufficiently “realistic”. And in returning him to the “abject terror and hopelessness” of childhood, but with that strange Dickensian stir of laughter (Fagin and Squeers, those comic turns), the novelist, hypocritical and self-deceiving as he might have been, has done him some matchless kindness.</p>

This episode of The Conversation’s In Depth Out Loud podcast, features the work of Leon Litvack at Queen’s University Belfast, a world authority on Charles Dickens, on what happened after the death of the author.</p>
<p>His new research has uncovered the never-before-explored areas of the great author’s sudden death on June 9 1870, and his subsequent burial.</p>
<p>Dickens’s death created an early predicament for his family. Where was he to be buried? Near his home (as he would have wished) or in that great public pantheon, Poet’s Corner in Westminster Abbey (which was clearly against his wishes)? But two ambitious men put their own interests ahead of the great writer and his family in an act of institutionally-sanctioned bodysnatching.</p>
