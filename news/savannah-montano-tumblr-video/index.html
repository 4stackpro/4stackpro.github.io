<p>Instagram model and YouTuber Savannah Montano has had a string of relationships over the years, each more public than the last. Always open about her relationships, Savannah has continuously vlogged about them, including on her YouTube, where she has just over 500,000 subscribers.</p>
<p>Savannah is currently dating MMA fighter Dillon Danis.</p>
<p>Since at least July 2019, Savannah has been linked to MMA fighter Dillon Danis. She first introduced her audience to Dillon in a YouTube video titled “NYC VLOG (MEET MY BOYFRIEND).” The fighter is known for being good friends and training partners with notable fighter Conor McGregor.</p>
<p>Source: Instagram</p>
<p>A member of Bellator’s roster, Dillon is currently undefeated with a 2-0 record, taking out both Max Humphrey and Kyle Walker in the first rounds. He’s been cited multiple times as a fighter to watch for in the ring. Not only is Dillon an up-and-coming fighter, but his relationship has already caused some public beef. Controversial YouTuber Jake Paul allegedly tried to get under Dillon’s skin in an effort to get him in the ring, claiming he had hooked up with Savannah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dillon, I know you&rsquo;re watching this,&rdquo; Jake said in a video with TMZ. &ldquo;Just remember you&rsquo;re still a b&mdash;h and I hooked up with your girlfriend. Savannah, how you doing? What&rsquo;s good?&rdquo; It’s been rumored that Jake offered Dillon $5 million to fight him, though Jake denied the claims. Dillon fired back at Jake over his comments about his girlfriend, posting a photo with Tana Mongeau. At the time, Tana and Jake had recently gotten “married” in an elaborate fake marriage.</p>

<h3 id="jake-paul-taunts-dillon-danis-with-scandalous-claim-that-he-hooked-up-with-his-girlfriend">&ldquo;Jake Paul Taunts Dillon Danis With Scandalous Claim That He Hooked Up With His Girlfriend&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.distractify.com/brand-img/hAe4P-74h/0x0/savannah1-1571936562729.jpg" alt="img">
Well, it looks like Jake Paul doesn&rsquo;t want to let his brother, Logan Paul , get all the fun and hype from a highly publicized fight. Pro MMA fighter Dillon Danis — who has two wins and is known for being best friends with Conor McGregor — has been taunting Jake Paul to fight him for quite some time, and now, Jake is returning the gibes.</p>
<p>Dillon says that Jake&rsquo;s team offered him $5 million for a fight, while Jake is saying it&rsquo;s a bogus claim. Now, Jake is alleging that he hooked up with Dillon&rsquo;s girlfriend, Savannah Montano.</p>
<p>The outrageous accusation is causing a stir online, leading many to wonder if this is true. Who is Dillon Danis&rsquo; girlfriend Savannah? We&rsquo;ve got the details of who she is, and if Jake&rsquo;s latest comments are enough to finally solidify this match.</p>
<p>Savannah introduced Dillon as her boyfriend in June of 2019, with a video on her channel. Since then, the couple has been inseparable, but it looks like Jake Paul might be trying to come between them.</p>
<p>She created an e-commerce site called Disruptive Youth in 2014, with money from her dad, who is the company&rsquo;s official CEO. Savannah&rsquo;s eponymous YouTube channel got popular after she posted videos with her now ex-boyfriend, Jessey Stevens. The two showcased their relationship in videos, but they ended things in September of 2018. Her channel has more than 500,000 subscribers.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old first got notoriety from Tumblr and Vine. Her Tumblr account was focused on fashion content. On the now-defunct video app, she had more than 400,000 followers, which allowed her to pursue a fashion career.</p>
<p>In addition to having a name that sounds way too similar to Hannah Montana (we had to!), Savannah works as an Instagram model, and she&rsquo;s often seen on Dillon&rsquo;s arm at events. The two have shared many NSFW photos and videos together, making them a steamy social media couple.</p>
<p>What Jake Paul said about Dillon Danis&rsquo; girlfriend.</p>
<p>Dillon has been wanting a fight with Jake Paul since 2018, when Jake said that he could easily beat the MMA fighter in a match. Jake said that Dillon had a weak punch, and that he&rsquo;d easily win. Dillon didn&rsquo;t take the criticism too well, and he&rsquo;s been asking for a fight ever since.</p>
<p>Dillon first made things awkward for Jake when he claimed that he would steal Tana Mongeau from the YouTuber after beating him in a fight. Jake and Tana got &ldquo;married&rdquo; on July 28, and Dillon posted a photo with Tana as proof that they&rsquo;ve hung out before. The low blows definitely didn&rsquo;t end there.</p>
<p>Source: Instagram</p>
<p>Jake began writing on Dillon&rsquo;s Instagram, asking him to talk to Savannah about the time when she and Jake hooked up. Dillon seemingly ignored the messages, but he went on to say that Jake&rsquo;s team offered him $5 million to sign a contract for a fight. He also denied that Savannah and Jake have ever been together.</p>
<p>While training in a boxing ring, Jake spoke to TMZ about whether or not he&rsquo;d ever offered Dillon money for a fight.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s talking about,&rdquo; Jake said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dillon, I know you&rsquo;re watching this,&rdquo; Jake continued. &ldquo;Just remember you&rsquo;re still a b&mdash;h and I hooked up with your girlfriend. Savannah, how you doing? What&rsquo;s good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Source: Instagram</p>
<p>Jake&rsquo;s mean comments didn&rsquo;t end there. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not worth $5 million,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The only reason anyone knows who he is, is because he&rsquo;s used me and my brother&rsquo;s name to make a name for himself and he got punched in the face by Khabib [Nurmagomedov.] That&rsquo;s the peak of his career. He&rsquo;s Conor McGregor&rsquo;s best friend. That&rsquo;s all this guy&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The YouTuber went on to say that he&rsquo;d fight Dillon eventually, but he wasn&rsquo;t ready to pick a date yet because he&rsquo;s focusing on other career ventures. Dillon posted a video of Jake&rsquo;s TMZ interaction on his Instagram page, writing &ldquo;I can smell his p&mdash;y from here.&rdquo; Yikes.

It was a ‘visual symphony’ on stage as revellers brought revered mas man Peter Minshall’s vision to life for Kinetic Mas’ presentation – Mas Pieta.</p>
<p>Shrouded in black bodysuits adorned with multi-coloured wings representing the different ‘Acts’ of the presentation, masqueraders jumped, chipped and twirled their way across the Savannah stage on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They did so under the watchful eyes of towering moko jumbies also adorned in ornate costumes.</p>
<p>Also joining the band in their journey across the stage was Machel Montano, who could be seen singing along to the song that would eventually go on to win the Road March title – Stage Gone Bad.

<p>While they never made an official statement about their break-up, both of them deleted all photos of each other on social media. Of course, when that happens it usually means the pair is totally dunzo. But, now, there&rsquo;s good news!</p>
<p>Jessey and Savannah have seemingly confirmed they are 100 percent back on – at Coachella of all places! Savannah posted this steamy photo of the couple on Instagram with the caption, &ldquo;Tasting like forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it looks like they couldn&rsquo;t keep their hands off of each other! Savannah posted another video clip of the two kissing. This one was for a sponsored ad and STILL, she made their love the center of attention. We can&rsquo;t blame her though – he is super cute! Savannah posted this on social media with the caption, &ldquo;@sugarbearhair ?? #ad #sugarbearhair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Obviously, the caption doesn&rsquo;t say much, but the photo says it all! The pair started posting photos together at the beginning of the year which clued fans into the fact that they were talking and hanging out again. But, that didn&rsquo;t mean they were official. Exes can be friendly, too!</p>
<p>But, then, Jessey actually went to visit Savannah for Valentine&rsquo;s Day this year. That trip may have sealed the deal. There&rsquo;s no telling if they did anything romantic for the occasion but just the fact that they were together says something.</p>
<p>These two are adorable and hopefully, they can make it work this time around! It&rsquo;s clear that there are feelings between them and we hope to continue to share their sweet love on social media for all the fans to see!</p>

<h3 id="how-savannah-montano-became-a-fashion-icon-on-instagram">&ldquo;How Savannah Montano became a fashion icon on Instagram&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.dailydot.com/wp-content/uploads/1b7/07/savannahmon-1449532753-53.jpg" alt="img">
Two young women are freaking out on Instagram. One comments on a photo, “I THOUGHT SHE CUT HER HAIR FOR 1 SEC &amp; I WAS GONNA CRY.” The other replies “SAME.” The “she” here is Savannah Montano, and if you don’t know who she is yet, her 1 million followers would be happy to fill you.</p>
<p>Montano is 19-year-old fashionista who shares frequent glimpses into her beautiful life in south Florida—photos of her favorite outfits and portraits of her and her boyfriend, many of which look more like Calvin Klein perfume ads than two teens running around town. Montano started building a name for herself on Tumblr about four years ago, but it was her rise on Instagram—in concert with the app’s near ubiquity in teen culture—that showed her she could really make a living out of it.</p>
<p>“People really like seeing who people truly who are. They really don’t like the fake, and putting on a front for social media,” Montano told the Daily Dot via Skype. “I think that’s what people really liked about me—that I was really truthful to who I was. They liked seeing what my day-to-day life was like in the pictures that I would post.”</p>
<p>Her path to success hasn’t been without its setbacks. She got a peek into the Web’s dark side when her Instagram got hacked two and half years ago. Her email was also compromised, which made it impossible for her to reset her password. At the time, Montano had approximately 600,000 followers, and she says that after multiple attempts to get in touch with Instagram, she was forced to delete her account and start anew.</p>
<p>“I think that’s what people really liked about me—that I was really truthful to who I was.”</p>
<p>For someone so young and just starting to develop a personal brand, that disruption could have been the end of it, but with 1.1 million followers currently, the hack was a blip on the rising star’s radar.</p>
<p>In January of this year, Montano—with the help of her father, Dr. Robert Montano—launched her e-commerce site, Disruptive Youth. The elder Montano serves as CEO while Savannah is the co-founder and creative director. “Everyone on social media would always ask me ‘Where do you get your clothes?’ ‘What’s your style?’ And I never really had a direct answer, because I buy my clothes everywhere,” she says. “So I figured it would be great to create somewhere to put all the styles that I wear into one area.”</p>
<p>In conversation, Montano seems humble and gracious. Despite all the attitude she gives the camera when rocking a bikini, her smile during our Skype conversation conveys a genuine appreciation for this wonderful life she’s built for herself, off- and online.</p>
<p>“‘Disruptive’ is creating your own path, and not following along with the crowd, not doing what everybody else is doing and following something that’s true to your heart,” Montano says of her company’s name, “And ‘youth’ is because I’m a millennial.”</p>
<p>A warehouse in Delray Beach—filled with crop tops, cut-off jean shorts, flirty dresses, and barely there activewear—serves as company headquarters, where Montano and her team of seven spend a majority of their time. Montano buys items wholesale, and then sells them on her site with a general price point between $30 and $60. She’s in talks with U.S. manufacturers to create her own line.</p>
<p>On her personal Instagram, her boyfriend, Jessey Stevens, a model signed with Next Models, serves as the chief photographer and helps Montano share her life with her fans. “I really trust his eye. He’s a great editor.” The two met via Twitter in 2014 while on a trip to New York. It turned out they were both south Floridians, and when they got back home, the chance encounter lead to romance—and a beautiful creative collaboration.</p>
<p>Despite her popularity—or perhaps because of it—Montano says she still gets negative comments on her social platforms, and relies on her strong sense of self to ignore the haters. “I think it’s really important to have your own happiness and self-confidence, aside from what people have to say about you.”</p>
<p>She’s seen how other teen Internet stars struggle with being in the spotlight, like the recent case of Essena O’Neill, an 18-year-old Australian model who released an emotional video detailing the artificial aspects of her seemingly perfect life.</p>
<p>“I think it was unfair of [O’Neill] to group everyone on social media together, and say that everyone is fake, and that everyone is doing it to just make money and promote brands they don’t even like,” Montano says, “because I think social media is wonderful. It’s not all staged and fake.”</p>
<p>Montano says she rarely promotes products, and if she does, you can bet it’s something she actually likes. When your fans implicitly trust your taste, it’s easier to turn down lame endorsement deals.</p>
<p>So what’s next for Montano? In addition to starting her own line, Disruptive Youth is planning on expanding internationally. Top of the list: Brazil. “I have a lot of fans in Brazil who are dying for me to ship there,” Montano says. Just a typical day for a teenage Instagram star.</p>
