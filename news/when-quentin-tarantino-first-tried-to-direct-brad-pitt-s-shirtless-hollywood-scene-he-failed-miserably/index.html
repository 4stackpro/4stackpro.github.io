Note to self: You don&rsquo;t give Brad Pitt acting advice on how to take his shirt off.</p>
<p>One of the most memorable moments in Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” arrives when Brad Pitt’s Cliff Booth climbs to the roof of Rick Dalton’s house to fix an antenna. It’s a warm summer afternoon in Los Angeles, so Cliff strips down and takes off his shirt. Pitt’s physique and the way the sun is beating down on his body and glaring off his abs overwhelmed more than a handful of moviegoers. Tarantino appeared on the latest episode of Amy Schumer’s “3 Girls, 1 Keith” podcast and recalled the moment he tried and failed to direct Pitt’s acting when it came to how Cliff should take off his shirt.</p>
<p>“It was funny because actually in public Brad is kind of shy about things like that,” Tarantino said. “At the same time, he knows exactly what time it is. I go, ‘So, I’m thinking maybe you unbutton the Hawaiian shirt, and you peel that off, and then peel off the Champion T-shirt.’ He was like, ‘Really? You want me to go through all that button bullshit? I’ll just take it off in one bit. Go!'”</p>
<p>Tarantino continued, “I’m like, okay, this guy knows exactly what time it is. Shut the fuck up and let the master do his job! Even when you see him in the work shed and the way he puts on the leather gloves and puts the wire in his mouth all butch and macho. He just knows what time it is.”</p>
<p>Popular on IndieWire</p>
<p>Pitt won every major supporting actor prize on the 2019-20 awards circuit for his performance in “Once Upon Time in Hollywood,” including the Golden Globe, Screen Actors Guild Award, and Academy Award. Pitt had previously won an Oscar as the producer of Best Picture winner “12 Years a Slave,” but his win for “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” marked his first Academy Award for acting.</p>
<p>Tarantino has yet to announce a follow-up project to “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” but whatever he chooses to do will be his last film as he remains committed to his plan to retire after directing 10 movies. Tarantino was attached to an R-rated “Star Trek” for a time but has announced he most likely will not direct the space adventure. Listen to Tarantino’s full appearance on Schumer’s podcast here.</p>

<h3 id="brad-pitt-and-jennifer-aniston-almost-reconciled-in-2005-despite-angelina-jolie">Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston &lsquo;almost reconciled in 2005 despite Angelina Jolie&rsquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article21765632.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Ron-Galella-Archive-File-Photos-2011.jpg" alt="img">
There was a moment after Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston split in 2005 that they almost reconciled, only for it to all go wrong again.</p>
<p>The 56-year-old Hollywood actor&rsquo;s grandmother, Betty Russell, even spoke about her hopes that the pair would give it another go, only to be left disappointed.</p>
<p>At the height of their relationship, Brad and Jen were the golden couple of Tinseltown.</p>
<p>Friends star Jennifer, 51, met Brad in 1994 after their agents acted as cupid. It took until 1998 before the pair went on a date and two years later they were married.</p>
<p>They were the A-list Hollywood couple for five years, until Brad hooked up with Angelina Jolie on the set of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith.</p>

<p>Brad and Jen were divorced in 2005 and he embarked on a relationship with Angelina but there was a moment when he almost got back together with Jennifer.</p>
<p>That was the hope of his grandmother anyway, who thought that he would rekindle his romance with Jen and leave the liaison with Angelina in the past.</p>
<p>Speaking at the time, Betty said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure this is just a temporary thing. Brad and Jennifer are beautiful people. They&rsquo;ve always been so happy.</p>
<p>(Image: Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images)</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are both precious and have too much love to throw it all away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They just need to spend a little time apart before they realise how much they miss each other. I&rsquo;m praying for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was reported that Brad returned to Jennifer for her 37th birthday on February 11, 2005.</p>
<p>Despite separating weeks earlier, the pair were reportedly still wearing their wedding rings and were walking hand-in-hand, according sources at the time.</p>
<p>An insider said: &ldquo;It was if the past few weeks hadn&rsquo;t happened. Over dinner they couldn&rsquo;t keep their hands off each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to People, the pair even went on dates together again after having marriage counselling, in the hope that there could be a reconcilliation.</p>
<p>A source told the publication: &ldquo;They still love each other. The separation is a step back to see if their relationship is going to be forever or if it’s not.</p>
<p>(Image: Getty Images)</p>
<p>&ldquo;They’re searching for the answer, which is not an easy one to come up with. They’re still very close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfortunately it wasn&rsquo;t to be and it all unravelled after Brad was seen &ldquo;kissing and holding&rdquo; Angelina at the Parker Meridian Hotel in Palm Springs.</p>
<p>Brad strenuously denied the rumour but it was enough is enough for Jennifer and she filed for divorce on grounds of irreconcilable differences.</p>

<p>BRAD Pitt and Angelina Jolie&rsquo;s younger children are reportedly staying with her amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The Hollywood actor and Maleficent star&rsquo;s kids Pax, 16, Zahara, 15, Shiloh, 13, and 11-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne are thought to be self-isolating at Angelina&rsquo;s LA home.</p>

<p>This comes after their eldest child, Maddox, 18, allegedly left his South Korea college to return home to Angelina.</p>
<p>A source told E! News: &ldquo;All the kids are home with Angelina but they have continued seeing Brad and go over for their regular visits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are keeping up with their schoolwork, practicing their languages, playing instruments, board games and helping cook dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The insider went on: &ldquo;They are having a lot of family time and just hanging out together watching movies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, According to People, Maddox chose to stay with his mom and siblings instead of Brad, 56, after his semester at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea was canceled due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>The teenager is said to be concentrating on his Korean and Russian studies while his UN Ambassador mom takes charge of his brothers and sisters&rsquo; homeschooling.</p>
<p>Angelina has opted for a structured routine of &ldquo;waking them up early&rdquo; and setting them educational tasks to keep them on top of their studies.</p>

<p>Their relationship appeared to fall fast in love from the minute they met on the set of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith - and they didn&rsquo;t get the happily ever after they were hoping for.</p>
<p>The couple filed for divorce in September 2016 following an incident on a plane when Brad allegedly lost control of himself and clashed with son Maddox.</p>
<p>The Hollywood couple then released a joint statement where they said they&rsquo;d agreed to settle their divorce in private.</p>

<p>The messy break-up has reportedly involved various court orders and a custody dispute.</p>
<p>It has been claimed that Brad was not providing enough support for their six children.</p>
