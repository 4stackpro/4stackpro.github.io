<p>&lsquo;Will From Home&rsquo; already offers 12 episodes, with new episodes being released every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The show is made in collaboration with Snapchat and the app’s Head of Original Content, Sean Mills, commented on the collaboration. &lsquo;Will was feeling a lot of pent-up creative energy and was excited to do something with it in a new and different way,&rsquo; Mills revealed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our first reaction was to shore up the news coverage and really deliver on that,&rsquo; Mills shared speaking on collaboration with Smith&rsquo;s production Westbrook Media. &lsquo;But after a week-and-a-half or so, we started to see a huge surge in interest in entertainment content, especially humor and comedy.&rsquo;

<p>Will Smith and Tyra Banks created the content we didn’t know we needed after they came together for the actor’s new Snapchat series, Will From Home.</p>
<p>He had the model as a guest on the show and naturally the duo started to reminisce about the time she played the role of Jackie on his hit 90s sitcom, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.</p>
<p>The pair gave us all the feels when they managed to re-enact one of their most memorable scenes – nearly three decades after it first aired.</p>

<p>And what’s more, they managed to remember all their lines too!</p>
<p>Will, 51, explained: ‘This next piece is one of my favorite moments. I love that we did this.</p>
<p>In the scene Smith, their characters got into a huge screaming match.</p>

<p>Tyra, 46, got into character as she said: ‘You know what, you ain’t ever going to change! I’m getting the last word! Oh, no you’re not! Oh, yes I am! Scram!’</p>
<p>Will was clearly impressed by Tyra’s memory as he captioned the video in Instagram: ‘Yo it’s 30 YEARS LATER and @tyrabanks still has this scene memorized!! Love that!’</p>
<p>Tyra played Will’s girlfriend Jackie for several episodes of the hit 90s sitcom (Picture: REX)</p>
<p>Will From Home is his new Snap Original series showing the actor as he follows stay-at-home orders and practices social distancing at home with his family.</p>
<p>In each episode, Will does what he loves most – spending time with his family, connecting with people and bringing us laughs.</p>
<p>What a guy!</p>
<p>Will From Home airs every Monday, Wednesday and Friday until April 29th only on Snapchat’s Discover page.</p>

<h3 id="martin-lawrence-blames-will-smith-for-delays-to-bad-boys-for-life">Martin Lawrence blames Will Smith for delays to Bad Boys for Life</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.film-news.co.uk/images/news/cover/74614.jpg" alt="img">
Martin Lawrence has blamed the delays to making Bad Boys for Life on Will Smith&rsquo;s desire to perfect the script.</p>
<p>The third instalment of the action-comedy franchise, starring Lawrence and Smith as Miami detectives Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowery, was released in January, with the flick coming two decades after Bad Boys II was unveiled in 2003.</p>
<p>Discussing the lengthy hiatus during a recent Q&amp;A with #CRWN on Tidal, Lawrence playfully pointed the finger at Smith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;(Bad Boys for Life) took so long because of this guy. He wouldn&rsquo;t do the script unless it was right,&rdquo; he insisted.</p>
<p>Smith, who co-produced the movie, then noted that the reason why the project took so long to develop was because he takes the representation of African-Americans in cinema very seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These first two (Bad Boys) movies - at the time we did the first one &lsquo;95 - it was two black guys in a movie. That was a big deal back then. And it was like just what Bad Boys meant to the community and then we came back with Bad Boys 2 and it worked,&rdquo; the 51-year-old commented.</p>
<p>Readily accepting responsibility for Bad Boys for Life&rsquo;s slow progress, Smith told the audience that he felt especially protective over the third Bad Boys film.</p>
<p>&ldquo;(The story had to be) right, that it had something to say, that it was funny, and that it deserved to be made again&hellip; The Bad Boys had to come correct,&rdquo; he stated. &ldquo;I just didn&rsquo;t want to wreck the franchise, you know. I had felt like I had other sequels in my career that I didn&rsquo;t feel like, I didn&rsquo;t land it.&rdquo;
