Roger Waters has covered “The Right to Live in Peace,” updating the protest anthem with new lyrics that decry several world leaders, including President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The Pink Floyd co-founder, who has been a harsh critic of Trump for years, posted his rendition of the song in a homemade music video on his Facebook page. In a message accompanying the track, Waters declared that his cover “is for the people of Santiago and Quito and Jaffa and Rio and La Paz and New York and Baghdad and Budapest and everywhere else the man means us harm.”</p>
<p>Delivering lyrics in both English and Spanish, Waters eviscerated several of the world’s most controversial figureheads: &ldquo;So beware Bolsonaro / Giuido and Modi and Trump / The Cassarolazo is louder than all of your guns / It’s the beating heart of the people / And the message is perfectly plain / Our mother earth is just not for sale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You can watch Waters’ video below.</p>
<p>“The Right to Live in Peace” was originally recorded by Chilean folk singer and activist Victor Jara in 1971. The musician was killed by dictator Augusto Pinochet in 1973, becoming a martyr and symbol for social justice. More recently, his song again gained notoriety as the anthem for those protesting against Chilean President Sebastian Pinera in 2019.</p>
<p>At a screening of his recent concert movie Us + Them earlier this year, Waters lambasted Trump, referring to the president as &ldquo;a man who has failed at fucking everything in his life except becoming the biggest … tyrant and mass murderer and mass destroyer of everything that any of us might love or cherish in the whole [world], only because he has the power.”</p>
<p>Waters had planned to spend the year touring his This Is Not a Drill Tour in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election. But he recently had to cancel those dates due to the continuing COVID-19 outbreak.

<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/faroutmagazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Roger-Waters-Pink-Floyd2.jpeg?fit=800%2C523&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
As one half of Pink Floyd’s creative drive and aside from the band in his solo career, Roger Water has never been afraid to show his true feelings. He’s done so again with a cover of the protest anthem, ‘The Right To Live In Peace’.</p>
<p>The singer has been a keen advocate of world peace throughout his career and the outbreak of COVID-19 has not dampened his pursuit.</p>
<p>Waters has shared a cover of ‘The Right To Live In Peace’, a 1971 folk song written and performed by Victor Jara. The track was originally written to tackle the Chilean dictatorship of the time. Jara was killed by the Pinochet regime.</p>
<p>Last year the song again rose to prominence in the region as it became an anthem for the protests that raged across the country.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve re-recorded Victor Jara&rsquo;s great song &ldquo;The Right to Live in Peace&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is for the people of Santiago &amp; Quito &amp; Jaffa &amp; Rio &amp; La Paz &amp; New York &amp; Baghdad &amp; Budapest and everywhere else the man means us harm.</p>
<p>Love R.</p>

<p>“This is for the people of Santiago &amp; Quito &amp; Jaffa &amp; Rio &amp; La Paz &amp; New York &amp; Baghdad &amp; Budapest and everywhere else the man means us harm. Love R,” Waters captioned the post.</p>

<h3 id="roger-waters-postpones-2020-tour-due-to-coronavirus">Roger Waters Postpones 2020 Tour Due to Coronavirus</h3>
<p><img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2020/03/Roger-Waters-1.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=0&amp;zc=1&amp;s=0&amp;a=t&amp;q=89" alt="img">
Roger Waters has postponed his upcoming This Is Not a Drill Tour due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>“The bad news is I’ve had to postpone my tour until next year,” the Pink Floyd co-founder declared in a statement. “Bummer, but if it saves one life, it’s worth it.”</p>
<p>The dates will be rescheduled in 2021. Those with tickets to the original shows are advised to hang onto them for the new dates. The trek had been scheduled to hit 31 cities from July through October, a plan specifically designed to lead up to the 2020 presidential election. Waters envisioned the tour as a chance to enlighten audiences about the world around them.</p>
<p>“As the clock ticks faster and faster and faster down to extinction, it seemed like a good thing to make a fuss about it, so that’s why I’m going on the road,” he explained at the time of the tour’s announcement.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with the Austin Chronicle, Waters expounded on those thoughts, describing This Is Not a Drill as a “call to arms.&rdquo; “It&rsquo;s saying, ‘This is not a drill.’ They&rsquo;re killing you now,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Every single day they&rsquo;re killing you. Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg are killing you and so is Donald Trump and so is Mike Bloomberg, and so is the rest of that whole, huge corporate machine. They&rsquo;re killing you and your children. And everybody else in the world and their children!”</p>
<p>Though his opinions seem dire, Waters insisted the concerts’ message would be about hope and empowerment. “The power resides here,&rdquo; he noted. &ldquo;It would be so easy not to save the world. That&rsquo;s difficult now because it&rsquo;s been left way too late, but at least to change direction and show each other a little bit of respect and love.”</p>
<p>Updates, including when the rescheduled This Is Not a Drill performances will take place, will be posted to Waters&rsquo; official website.
