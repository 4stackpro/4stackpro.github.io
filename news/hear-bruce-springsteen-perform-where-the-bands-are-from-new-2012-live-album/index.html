The newest release from Bruce Springsteen’s monthly concert download series is a gig he played with the E Street Band in Gothenburg, Sweden, on July 28th, 2012.</p>
<p>It was a special, rain-soaked show that featured tour premieres of “Lost in the Flood,” “Frankie,” “Where the Bands Are” and “Jungleland.”</p>
<p>The emotional highpoint of the evening was “Jungleland.” It hadn’t been played since Clarence Clemons died the previous year and many fans presumed it was the one song that would never be done without him. “As you know, Clarence was a special part of Sweden,” Springsteen told the crowd prior to playing it. “This was a very special place for him. And so tonight…we haven’t done this one in a long time and we haven’t practiced it. So this is for the Big Man.”</p>
<p>This was yet another high-profile test for Jake Clemons, nephew of the late E Street Band saxophonist. He joined the group earlier that year as part of a five-piece horn section, but he alone played Clarence’s iconic parts on songs like “Born to Run,” “Badlands” and “Dancing in the Dark.”</p>
<p>The first gig took place at New York’s Apollo Theater and was broadcast on SiriusXM radio. He was note-perfect that night, but now he was called upon to play the longest sax part that Clarence ever recorded in the E Street Band, unrehearsed, in front of a capacity crowd at a Swedish soccer stadium.</p>
<p>As you can see from this fan-shot YouTube video, he nailed it. When it wrapped, a proud Springsteen walked over, tapped him on the shoulder and whispered something in his ear. The song entered regular rotation in the setlist in the following weeks and has been there ever since.</p>
<p>Popular on Rolling Stone</p>
<p>Springsteen hasn’t toured or played with the E Street Band since the Australian leg of The River tour wrapped in February 2017. Last year, he said he had a set of new songs he wanted to record with the band. He planned on releasing an album this year and supporting it with a tour, but that seems very unlikely now that the coronavirus has shut down the entire concert business for the foreseeable future.

<h3 id="for-you-is-a-must-read-book-for-philly-area-bruce-springsteen-fans-social-distancing-at-home">&lsquo;For You&rsquo; is a must-read book for Philly-area Bruce Springsteen fans social distancing at home</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/Screen_Shot_2020-03-31_at_6.10.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630-c0.png" alt="img">
Social distancing guidelines designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus have confined most Americans to their homes, leaving them searching for various forms of entertainment.</p>
<p>Concert-goers are now unable to attend shows and festivals for the foreseeable future, so plenty of music is being streamed to fill the void.</p>
<p>But one thing that may cheer up music lovers, particularly Bruce Springsteen fans, is a book titled “For You: Original Stories and Photographs by Bruce Springsteen&rsquo;s Legendary Fans,” by author Lawrence Kirsch.</p>
<p>The book was originally published in 2007 and essentially has been out of publication since 2009. But a limited edition – 1,100 copies – was reprinted in 2019.</p>
<p>The title, as any serious Springsteen fan would know, comes from the hit off his 1973 debut album, “Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.”</p>
<p>The 200-plus page book pays homage to The Boss himself, but most importantly, to his fans. It is packed with stories told by his fans and more than 400 photos they captured from the 1970s through 2009. It include contributions from fans from 30 countries, showcasing Springsteen&rsquo;s wide and impactful reach.</p>
<p>Springsteen diehards likely will relate to many, if not most, of the stories shared. It makes one want to play some of Bruce’s music or imagine one of his iconic concerts. Plus, the books features plenty of other famous musicians who have performed with Springsteen.</p>
<p>There’s also no shortage of stories and images of Springsteen’s performances across the Philadelphia region either. Performances at the Spectrum, Veterans Stadium, JFK Stadium and the Wells Fargo Center in South Philly are featured. So are shows at The Main Point in Bryn Mawr, Widener College in Chester, The Roxy Theater in Manayunk and The Tower Theater in Upper Darby.</p>
<p>One story that particularly stands out comes from a Columbus, Ohio man who saw Springsteen perform at the Spectrum on December 8, 1980, an infamous day in American history:</p>
<p>On the evening of December 8, 1980, a demented young man named Mark David Chapman, who wanted to be famous, pumped five bullets into John Lennon, who died a few minutes later of his wounds. It was 11:50 p.m. I was attending a Bruce Springsteen concert at the Spectrum in Philadelphia that night. Bruce’s fifth album, “The River,” had been released that fall, and “Hungry Heart” was somewhere near the top of the charts. I was a 19-year-old sophomore in college. My friends and I had driven about three hours to the Spectrum from Carlisle, and we saw an amazing show. The Boss played for about four and a half hours that night.</p>
<p>The concert let out at about the time that Chapman fired the fatal rounds. Nobody told Bruce Springsteen that John Lennon had been shot, so nothing was said during the show. We were completely ignorant of events when we left the arena to head for the cars.</p>
<p>When we got to the car, all of the Philly radio stations were playing nothing but Beatles and John Lennon songs, and we could not, for the life of us, understand why. Finally, there was a break in the music, and we heard the terrible news. Obviously, that’s a night that is forever burned into my memory, both for the incredible show we saw, and then for the horrific events that we learned of after the end of the show.</p>
<p>It’s a perfect book for the coffee table and, in the meantime, to keep one occupied and entertained while social distancing at home. Less than 450 copies of the book remain, and you can order a copy here.

<h3 id="jason-isbells-hang-outs-with-lady-gaga-springsteen-bradley-cooper">Jason Isbell’s hang outs with Lady Gaga, Springsteen, Bradley Cooper</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.al.com/resizer/rPdRj8zdsijzntbiXYKkEA_mDKM=/1280x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-advancelocal.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NPB6VHFSJ5BGDB6W6PRJYXT6QM.jpg" alt="img">
Even though his orbit now includes superstars, Jason Isbell remains - in my experience from interviewing him 10 or so times over the years - as down-to-earth and kind as any “famous” person you’ll ever meet.</p>
<p>In a new interview with Rolling Stone. senior writer Brian Hiatt asks Isbell about his relationships with some of music’s giants.</p>
<p>There’s a funny story about pop singer Lady Gaga. “Gaga called me while I was feeding my daughter one afternoon,” Isbell tells Hiatt. “For some reason, I thought it would be hilarious to put them on the phone with each other. So I handed my two-year-old the phone — and of course she could say ‘Gaga’ really well.”</p>
<p>Lady Gaga starred in the smash 2018 remake film “A Star Is Born,” which featured leading man/director Bradley Cooper singing the excellent, Isbell -penned song “Maybe It’s Time.” “Bradley came to some shows, and we hung out a bit,” Isbell tells RS. “He’s a good guy and a good director.”</p>
<p>In March 2019, the circle was completed when Pearl Jam singer Eddie Vedder, who Cooper reportedly based some of his portrayal of fictional hard-living musician Jackson Maine on, covered “Maybe It’s Time” during a solo acoustic concert. Upon finding out back then about Vedder covering his song, Isbell tweeted “Holy s&mdash;Eddie Vedder sang my Bradley Cooper song in his set tonight. That is by far the strangest sentence I’ve ever composed but it’s certainly a huge honor. I was 12 when (Pearl Jam’s 1991 album) ‘Ten’ came out and by god I learned how to play every song on it.” In a following tweet, Isbell commented “I was not ready for Nirvana at 12 years old. That took a while. But I played rock guitar on a Fender Stratocaster so PJ hit the spot immediately.”</p>
<p>Turns out Isbell, a four-time Grammy winner from the Muscle Shoals area now Nashville based, almost turned down the offer to have a song in “Star is Born,” which became the highest profile of his work yet. “Before I read the script or anything,” Isbell says in the RS interview, “I thought it sounded like a terrible idea. The one with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, as much as I love both of them, was not a great movie. And I had been writing a lot, and I just didn’t feel up to it. And of course my wife, Amanda (Shires, musician/songwriter), was like, ‘You’re an idiot! You’ve got all these songs laying around, just finish one up.’ That’s what I did, and it turned out great.”</p>
<p>In January 2014, Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Bruce Springsteen touted Isbell’s song “Traveling Alone,” from Isbell’s 2013 breakthrough solo album “Southeastern,” during a Springsteen interview with NPR. During that NPR chat, The Boss called “Southeastern” a “lovely record.”</p>
<p>When Isbell got the chance to meet Springsteen, Springsteen even sang a snippet of “Traveling Alone” to him, Isbell tells Hiatt in Rolling Stone’s Q&amp;A: “He goes, ‘My son brought your record home, and I really liked that song — and then he started singing — ‘Traveling Alone.’’ And I’m standing there thinking, ‘He’s singing my song in Bruce Springsteen voice!’ But he was super-sweet. And I was beside myself. I mean, it’s Bruce Springsteen.”</p>
<p>In the press, Isbell and his backing band The 400 Unit have been compared to Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band more than once. He notes to Rolling Stones, The Boss “comes from a time when it was possible for people to write those kind of songs and sell millions of records and sell out arenas.” Hiatt follows-up by asking is Isbell “yearns for that era.&rdquo; Isbell answers, “If I’d come along in the ’70s, I probably would have been a much bigger star, and I would’ve had a lot more money. And I would be dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He’s probably correct on all accounts there. Of course, Hiatt and Isbell also talk music, including Isbell’s upcoming seventh studio album “Reunions.” Asked about writing the track “It Gets Easier” about the challenges of staying sober, Isbell says, “I’m always looking for ways to come at subject matter that haven’t been explored before. People will write a lot about the first stages of love or recovery or life-changing events. You write about the funeral; you don’t write about 30 years later, when Dad’s been gone.”</p>
<p>During the Rolling Stone Q&amp;A, another “Reunions” song gets brought up. “Letting You Go” is about Isbell’s young daughter eventually getting married. “That is a terrifying thing for a father to imagine,&rdquo; he tells RS. &ldquo;When my father-in-law was walking my wife down the aisle, when he got up to me, he stopped and would not hand her over. And now I think, ‘Man, I’d probably do the same thing.’”</p>
<p>Much has been made about the depressing themes of some of Isbell’s songs. He’s been self-depreciating about it during interviews and on social media. In 2017, I put together a ranking of all of Isbell’s songs released by then, solo and written during his time with punk-tinged Southern rockers Drive-By Truckers, for AL.com. After repeated listens to more than 60 Isbell songs and corresponding analysis, by the end, tears were literally welling up in my eyes.</p>
<p>For Rolling Stone, Hiatt asks Isbell, “Do you, on some level, enjoy making listeners cry?” Isbell replies, “Well, that or making them laugh — if you make somebody make some type of noise unintentionally, you’re doing a pretty good job as a songwriter. But there’s something about the sad songs where it’s not just sad, there’s a resilience, and I think that’s what really affects people.”</p>
<p>“Reunions” is out May 15. Fans can preorder the album at orcd.co/reunions. So far, Isbell’s released three songs from the LP: alt-rocker “Be Afraid&rdquo;; acoustic jewel “Only Children;” and album opener “What’ve I Done To Help,” featuring backing vocals from Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash legend David Crosby. In the Rolling Stone interview, Hiatt asks what his relationship is like with Croz. Isbell replies, “David is like your granddad, if your granddad was really stoned all the time,” before attesting to how strong Crosby’s voice remains even after being dragged through hell. The Rolling Stone Q&amp;A is excerpted from a 45-minute(ish) Isbell interview from Hiatt’s Music Now podcast.</p>
