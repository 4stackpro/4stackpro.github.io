Doug the Pug is getting into the fitness game right now and that means hosting workout sessions and even doing Tik Tok videos.</p>
<p>We all know that Doug the Pug is a star and whether he is walking the red carpet, starring in a commercial, or gracing us with his presence on social media, he knows how to draw attention. And now it seems he is also getting into the world of health and fitness.</p>
<p>According to People Magazine, on March 27, Doug the Pug hosted a workout session on the Facebook page for Planet Fitness. But that‚Äôs not all, as he even has a Tik Tok video that he shared on Twitter showing off even more workout options that involve our furry friends at home.</p>
<p>Basically this is one health-conscious Pug and we are here for it. With so many of us practicing social distancing, some people are finding it hard to get in a good workout while at home. And with the help of Doug the Pug and other online fitness gurus, it looks like there may be some options for how to get in a solid workout even while you are at home and away from the gym.</p>
<p>At home workouts with ur dog! üê∂ pic.twitter.com/bvLoH02ety ‚Äî Doug The Pug (@itsdougthepug) March 28, 2020</p>
<p>The nice thing about these workout sessions with Doug the Pug is the fact that it reminds us that we can still be healthy and active with our dogs around. And while some of us might be walking our dogs more than ever, with these videos, we are reminded that there are more ways to workout with a pup around than just going for a walk.</p>
<p>Honestly, these workout videos are an awesome way to stay active, while also reminding us that our pups can help us out with some of these exercises.</p>
<p>In fact, I think these are a great way to be inspired and get active.</p>
<p>What do you think of Doug the Pug‚Äôs workout videos? Are they inspiring you to stay active? Tell us what you think in the comments.

<p>As businesses across the nation remain closed due to the current coronavirus pandemic, many have had to find a way to adapt to the current state of the world.</p>
<p>Movie studios have pushed back upcoming releases and sped up their digital release strategies, while food service companies have resorted to take-out only options. Similarly, gyms have had to make changes as well.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur daily routines have changed in unexpected ways, and we know that people may not be able to get to the gym,‚Äù Jeremy Tucker, chief marketing officer of Planet Fitness, said in a statement to USA TODAY. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we‚Äôre offering a free, daily virtual fitness class for everyone on Planet Fitness‚Äô Facebook page from Monday through Friday.‚Äù</p>
<p>Tucker also added that virtual classes ‚Äúwill be led by Planet Fitness certified trainers, as well as special guests like ‚ÄòThe Biggest Loser‚Äô coach and fitness trainer Erica Lugo, among others. The home workouts will offer tools to combat stress while providing motivation and inspiration sure to keep us all physically and mentally fit.‚Äù</p>
<p>How exactly Dog the Pug will lead an online exercise class remains to be seen but we‚Äôre sure it will be an exciting and adorable feat to watch.</p>
