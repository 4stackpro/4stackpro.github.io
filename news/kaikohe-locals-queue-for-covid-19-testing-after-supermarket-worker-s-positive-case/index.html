Hundreds of people from the small Northland community of Kaikohe have lined up to be assessed for Covid-19, after a supermarket worker tested positive.</p>
<p>Photo: Supplied</p>
<p>The Northland DHB is advising anyone who shopped at New World Kaikohe between 20 to 30 March to keep a close eye on their health and monitor themselves for symptoms.</p>
<p>More than 150 people showed up yesterday to get assessed for Covid-19 at the only community testing station in Kaikohe, run by the iwi Ngāpuhi, and another 119 people have come through today.</p>
<p>The Ngāpuhi Pandemic Response team&rsquo;s project lead Tia Ashby said not all those who showed up needed testing, with only 30 requiring swabbing on Sunday and 33 today.</p>
<p>Ashby said most of those who showed up just needed reassurance from health professionals that their symptoms were just allergies or the common cold and not Covid-19.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of them did say they have anxieties&hellip; it&rsquo;s every day when they see numbers rising, any little niggle that could be similar to what Covid-19 is can trigger anxieties,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we have the CBAC [community-based assessment clinic] to ensure that whānau have the right education on what these resources actually mean, so it&rsquo;s about health literacy, [and] comprehension on the medical terminology that can be confusing at times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>See all RNZ coverage of Covid-19</p>
<p>Of those who came to the community clinic on Sunday, Ashby said 55 were in need of social services, with Whānau Ora navigators also working onsite to help those struggling to pay rent or feed their family.</p>
<p>The testing station, run by the iwi in conjunction with Broadway Health Centre and Mahitahi PHO, was opened on Friday morning.</p>
<p>Te Rūnanga-a-iwi o Ngāpuhi chair Mere Mangu said the iwi was &ldquo;running off its own resources&rdquo;, as it had not been given a share of the $2.2 million she understood Northland DHB had budgeted for Māori health providers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are the only Māori provider with this facility, especially in the north here, and yet we have not received any funding from the Northland DHB.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a service we know this community needs so we are going to carry it, but we are also seeking to be funded in the proper way and have equitable service from these government departments out to us that we should be entitled to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Northland DHB did not respond to RNZ&rsquo;s request for comment.</p>
<p>Mangu said Foodstuffs, which owned the Kaikohe New World where the infected employee worked, needed to front up to the community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d like to know from Foodstuffs that they really do have concern for their kaimahi, that they have all been tested or they have all be laid-off so the public are really safe to go in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a statement, Foodstuffs said as soon as the store was alerted about the positive test, the worker&rsquo;s immediate team members were tested as a precaution and were sent home to isolate.</p>
<p>They will remain at home until their test results are returned.</p>
<p>A deep clean of the department and the wider store was also undertaken.</p>
<p>If you have symptoms of the coronavirus, call the NZ Covid-19 Healthline on 0800 358 5453 (+64 9 358 5453 for international SIMs) or call your GP - don&rsquo;t show up at a medical centre</p>
<p>Attempts to reassure the community</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health aimed to reassure people it was okay to keep shopping at Kaikohe New World.</p>
<p>People who shopped there during that time frame should be keeping a close eye on their health, Northland Public Health officials said.</p>
<p>Director General of Health doctor Ashley Bloomfield said people could be confident shopping there now that the person will be in isolation and unable to infect others.</p>
<p>Dr Bloomfield said as part of the investigation, close contacts would have be identified, tested if symptomatic and monitored if not.</p>
<p>Northland DHB said in a statement today there were 16 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the region and one probable cases.</p>
<p>There were 12 people in Northland hospitals who were suspected coronavirus cases and under investigation, but none had been confirmed.</p>

<h3 id="covid-19-coronavirus-northland-dhb-urges-kaikohe-new-world-shoppers-to-keep-eye-on-their-health">Covid-19 coronavirus: Northland DHB urges Kaikohe New World shoppers to keep eye on their health</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/UDGvHDhOetVveVjncOL0ac948OY=/1200x0/smart/filters:quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-syd-prod-nzme.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WNOQYC5LARBK5I4XM4KFVFV7HM.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<p>Kaikohe New World shoppers are being urged to keep an eye on their health following contact tracing on Northland&rsquo;s latest confirmed Covid-19 case.</p>
<p>In a statement from the Northland District Health Board (NDHB) late today, it advised anyone who shopped at Kaikohe&rsquo;s New World supermarket between March 20-30 to check themselves for Covid-19 symptoms.</p>
<p>The warning comes after contact tracing was conducted on Northland&rsquo;s latest confirmed case of Covid-19, which brought the region&rsquo;s total to 14 (13 confirmed and one probable).</p>
<p>NDHB Medical Officer of Health Dr Catherine Jackson accepted the news would be distressing but encouraged only those with symptoms to seek testing.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I acknowledge our community will feel concerned, you only need to be tested if you have symptoms of Covid-19,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Jackson said it was important to practise Covid-19 health and safety guidelines including hand washing, social distancing and only going into town for essential purposes.</p>
<p>The NDHB said it had no confirmed or probable cases in any Northland hospitals. On Friday, it confirmed there were 12 cases under investigation at three Northland hospitals.</p>
<p>Six cases under investigation were at Whangārei Hospital, four at Bay of Islands Hospital and two at Kaitaia Hospital.</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Health, being under investigation is someone who is eligible for testing but has not yet been tested, or is someone who has been tested and do not yet have a result.</p>
<p>People who were being tested were quarantined (self-isolated) until their test results were available.</p>
<p>A probable case is someone who has been in close contact with a confirmed case and has an illness that is consistent with Covid-19, while their testing for Covid-19 is inconclusive and other causes of their illness (for example flu) have been ruled out.</p>
<p>These people were isolated and contact traced as if they were a confirmed case.</p>

<p>Head to the bottom of the story for details on the centres</p>
<p>New Zealand&rsquo;s national case tally is now 950 with the addition of 82 new cases, announced by Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield in a media conference today.</p>
<p>• Covid19.govt.nz: The Government&rsquo;s official Covid-19 advisory website</p>
<p>Of the 82 new cases, 52 were confirmed and 30 were probable as at 9am today. Bloomfield said 10 people were in stable conditions in various hospitals while a total of 127 cases had recovered from the virus.</p>
<p>Bloomfield said there has been a &ldquo;flattening off&rdquo; of new cases but he would like to see another two or three days of lower new cases numbers to be confident of that.

<h3 id="far-north-town-steps-up-covid-19-testing">Far North town steps up Covid-19 testing</h3>
<p><img src="https://news-image-prod-imgix.tech.tvnz.co.nz/content/dam/images/news/2020/04/03/covid-19-testing-widens-in-kaikohe-region.png.hashed.5bda17bf.desktop.story.share.jpg" alt="img">
Testing for Covid-19 increased today in the Kaikohe region, as warnings suggest the disease will be more dangerous to Māori than Pākehā if it takes hold.</p>
<p>Your playlist will load after this ad</p>
<p>In Kaikohe, there are also reports some of the 13 Northland cases might be in their town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we do know is that we do have confirmed cases that have reach the Far North and it is a concern because a lot that are still out and about in the community are not sticking to the lockdown rules,&rdquo; says Tia Ashby of the Ngapuhi response team.</p>
<p>There have been similar warnings from Auckland University statistician, Andrew Sporle - crunching the numbers as they relate to Māori, with worst-case predictions that if the epidemic hits 60 per cent of people, there could be as much as 5,500 deaths.</p>
<p>Because of that, he says Māori in the over 50s group should be treated as if they are over 60 and over 60s treated as if they are over 70 – suggesting they have the same risks as Pākehā who are 10 years older.</p>
<p>“A big proportion of our deaths will be in their 50s and 60s, so the one size fits all approach to lock up your oldies who are at home for us needs to slide down,” he says.
