Selena Gomez liked two photos of her ex Justin Bieber, a fan account reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>The account also said that the 27-year-old &ldquo;Rare&rdquo; singer has since removed her likes from both photos.</p>
<p>While some people were confused by Gomez&rsquo;s likes on pictures of the &ldquo;Yummy&rdquo; singer, others suggested that her Instagram account had been hacked or it was an accident.</p>
<p>Visit Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>Selena Gomez has publicly said that she&rsquo;s moved on from her on-again, off-again relationship with ex Justin Bieber, however, a fan account noticed that she recently liked two photos of the &ldquo;Yummy&rdquo; singer.</p>
<p>The account, which is called &ldquo;theselenarundown,&rdquo; posted a screenshot of artist Moises Arias&rsquo; photo of the 26-year-old&rsquo;s bare chest ‚Äî showing that Gomez had liked the picture.</p>

<p>Bieber is tagged in Arias&rsquo; photo, and the tattoos match the singer&rsquo;s body art, which he&rsquo;s previously displayed on his own Instagram.</p>

<p>Shortly after sharing the first photo, the fan account showed that Gomez has since unliked the picture.</p>

<p>The fan account also said Gomez liked a photo of the couple in Jamaica to attend Jeremy Bieber&rsquo;s wedding in February 2018. The picture was posted by a Beiber-Gomez fan account called &ldquo;alwaysjsjelena&rdquo; on Wednesday.</p>

<p>After seeing Gomez&rsquo;s name pop up on photos of Bieber, some fans reasoned that the likes must&rsquo;ve been an accident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must be mortified right now imagine liking by accident your ex&rsquo;s pic and the whole world saw it,&rdquo; one user commented on the Instagram post. Another wrote, &ldquo;It was obviously an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Others asserted that the &ldquo;Bad Liar&rdquo; singer had been hacked given that she&rsquo;s said she&rsquo;s moved on from the relationship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who tf is with her phone??&rdquo; one person wrote. Someone else added, &ldquo;AW NAH. She gotta be hacked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 2019, Gomez released a single called &ldquo;Lose You to Love Me,&rdquo; and fans were convinced that the emotional ballad was about her breakup with Bieber, who began dating his now-wife Hailey Bieber two months after he and Gomez called it quits.</p>
<p>After releasing the lead single and her third studio album &ldquo;Rare,&rdquo; Gomez said she felt like a &ldquo;victim to certain abuse&rdquo; during her relationship with Bieber on NPR&rsquo;s &ldquo;Weekend Edition Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When asked if she was referring to emotional abuse, she said, &ldquo;Yes, and I think that it&rsquo;s something that ‚Äî I had to find a way to understand it as an adult. And I had to understand the choices I was making.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gomez added, &ldquo;I felt I didn&rsquo;t get a respectful closure, and I had accepted that, but I know I needed some way to just say a few things that I wish I had said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The singer also spoke about the meaning behind &ldquo;Lose You to Love Me,&rdquo; explaining that she used it as a method of coping and recovery after the breakup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a hateful song; it&rsquo;s a song that is saying ‚Äî I had something beautiful and I would never deny that it wasn&rsquo;t that. It was very difficult and I&rsquo;m happy it&rsquo;s over. And I felt like this was a great way to just say, you know, it&rsquo;s done, and I understand that, and I respect that, and now here I am stepping into a whole other chapter,&rdquo; she said.

<h3 id="selena-gomez-performs-rare-acoustic-gospel-song-on-her-instagram--watch">Selena Gomez Performs Rare Acoustic Gospel Song On Her Instagram ‚Äî Watch</h3>
<p><img src="https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/selena-gomez-acoustic-gospel-song-instagram-shutterstock-ftr.jpg" alt="img">
Selena Gomez showed off her impressive vocals when she sang an uplifting gospel song by the piano with two pals.</p>
<p>Selena Gomez has switched up her usual sound, for an acoustic rendition of a gospel song while self-isolating amid the coronavirus outbreak ‚Äî and fans are loving it! The ‚ÄúRare‚Äù songstress took to Instagram on March 28 to share a clip with her 171 million followers, showing herself singing The Blessing by Kari Jobe. She was accompanied by her pals Anna Golden, and Liz Golden, who played the accompanying piano. ‚ÄúMay His presence be upon you, a thousand generations and your family and your children and their children and their children‚Ä¶ He is for you,‚Äù Selena captioned the pic, which showed her wearing a baby blue hoodie, grey sweatpants, and her hair swept back into a messy bun. The trio seem to be singing at Selena‚Äôs house, as hanging above the piano was a neon sign that read, ‚ÄúI Needed To Lose You To Find Me,‚Äù a lyric from Selena‚Äôs track about her ex Justin Bieber, ‚ÄúLose You to Love Me.‚Äù</p>
<p>Fans commented on how moving this song was, with one follower writing, ‚ÄúThank you Selena! This means so much to me. I‚Äôve felt really sad and down lately, had such a hard time with everything and not dealt with my emotions in a good/the right way‚Ä¶This song/video gave me some peace, so thank you for that!‚Äù This track isn‚Äôt the only thing Selena‚Äôs been singing lately. The former Wizards of Waverly Place star dropped a surprise music video for her song ‚ÄúDance Again‚Äù on March 26, while quarantining amid the global COVID-19 pandemic. ‚ÄúA portion of the proceeds from Dance Again merchandise will benefit the MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund,‚Äù the YouTube caption for her new video read, with a link to the Selena Store, where fans can purchase ‚ÄúDance Again‚Äù branded shirts.</p>
<p>In addition to donating a portion of merch sales, Selena has done her bit in helping stop the spread of coronavirus by partaking in the #SafeHands Challenge. In a PSA posted to her Instagram, the ‚ÄúLook At Her Now‚Äù singer demonstrated the proper way to wash your hands. ‚ÄúEverybody is saying that it‚Äôs 40 seconds long, which is technically as long as the ‚ÄòABCs‚Äô twice ‚Äî who would have thought because I clearly wasn‚Äôt washing my hands the right way,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI know about the girls and the long nails‚Ä¶so, some of the tips that I‚Äôve been given is that you want to do a little bit of this to get under your fingers.‚Äù</p>
<p>As for how Selena is handling the coronavirus crisis, she has admitted that she‚Äôs missing her friends. In a bittersweet Instagram post, Selena shared pictures of her alongside the singer-songwriter duo of Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter. ‚ÄúMissing our nights [of] creating and dancing,‚Äù she captioned the post. Don‚Äôt worry. Selena and her friends will ‚Äúdance again‚Äù soon.

<h3 id="is-selena-quintanillas-killer-still-in-prison">Is Selena Quintanilla‚Äôs Killer Still in Prison?</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-869979928.jpg" alt="img">
It has been 25 years since the murder of the ‚ÄúQueen of Tejano Music‚Äù Selena Quintanilla on March 31, 1995.</p>

<p>The 23-year-old ‚ÄúBidi Bidi Bom Bom‚Äù pop star was gunned down by Yolanda Sald√≠var, the president of the singer‚Äôs fan club, who was subsequently convicted of first-degree murder and sent to prison for life.</p>
<p>Selena was forced to fire Yolanda Sald√≠var</p>
<p>Yolanda Sald√≠var, after attending a concert of Selena‚Äôs, began contacting Abraham Quintanilla, Selena‚Äôs father and manager, to ask him for permission to start a fan club for the Tejano singer in San Antonio. She asked him repeatedly until he acquiesced in 1991. By 1994, Abraham entrusted Sald√≠var with responsibility as manager of Selena‚Äôs boutiques.</p>
<p>By Jan. 1995, Selena‚Äôs father started realizing that Sald√≠var was not what she seemed. He began receiving communication from disappointed fans who had paid for memberships to the fan club and received nothing.</p>
<p>Once he looked into their claims, he discovered that Sald√≠var‚Äôs wrongdoing was far more serious than it had seemed. She had not only failed to send fans their membership items; he discovered she had also been embezzling tens of thousands of dollars from the fan club.</p>
<p>The day Selena was killed</p>
<p>The family confronted Saldivar early in March of 1995 about the financial discrepancies and as a result, reportedly, she purchased a gun.</p>
<p>On the morning of March 31, 1995, Sald√≠var was able to convince Selena to come to her motel room under the ruse of giving her business papers for tax purposes.</p>

<p>At the room, the ‚ÄúDreaming of You‚Äù star and Sald√≠var argued loudly, according to motel guests, who complained about noises coming from Sald√≠var‚Äôs room. They said they heard two women arguing about business matters.</p>
<p>Selena was prepared to fire Sald√≠var and dumped a bag containing bank statements onto the bed and saw Sald√≠var‚Äôs gun, which the older woman grabbed and pointed at the singer.</p>

<p>As Selena tried to run out of the room, she was shot by her former fan club president. The bullet severed an artery and caused tremendous blood loss.</p>
<p>Selena managed to get out of the room and somehow into the motel lobby, leaving a blood trail, and crying out in pain and for help. The hotel staff tried to stop the bleeding and reported she said Saldivar‚Äôs name and room number before passing out.</p>
<p>Paramedics arrived to the scene, but were unable to do anything. Her blood loss had been too extensive and her pulse weak. The musical artist was dead on arrival to the hospital.</p>
<p>Sald√≠var is still in prison and requesting a retrial</p>
<p>Yolanda Sald√≠var was convicted of Selena‚Äôs death and sentenced to life in prison. She will be up for parole on Mar. 30, 2025.</p>
<p>In 2019, the convicted murderer requested a new trial, claiming that the prosecution had evidence that Saldivar‚Äôs defense team did not.</p>
<p>Her petition read in part, ‚ÄúThe Petitioner paraphrases Mr. Valdez‚Äôs media interview where he stated that he and the defense counsel, the late Mr. Douglas Tinker, discussed what [evidence] would or would not be introduced to the jury. . . The jury, NOT the defense or the prosecutor is the trier of fact of all relevant material evidence and they alone should and DID determine between conviction and acquittal.‚Äù</p>
<p>Her motion for a retrial was denied on Nov. 5, 2019.
