透過視訊的虛擬社交平台成了疫情隔離期間的熱門app。（網路截圖：houseparty）</p>
<p>「昨天跟幾個朋友開趴，我們還續了兩攤。超嗨的。」</p>
<p>在疫情緊張的時刻，這樣說話顯然不合時宜，還會立刻招來周遭譴責的目光。</p>
<p>不過，這一切如果是透過線上視訊進行應該就沒問題。根據《金融時報》報導，Houseparty這個虛擬社交app在短期間內爆紅，一週內超過200萬人下載，在英國、義大利、西班牙等17國登上Apple app store的下載排行榜冠軍。</p>
<p>保持社交距離如今成了防疫宣導的重點，許多人的社交生活也因此中斷。參加生日派對、家人聚餐、與朋友小酌，都成了此刻不宜的活動。</p>
<p>在此同時，Houseparty突然成了最熱門的社交舞台。</p>
<p>根據金融時報的報導，不只是青少年喜歡透過它的視訊聊天室進行社交活動，連青少年的父母輩也開始熱衷。28歲的米蘭達在金融時報的訪問中說：「Houseparty受歡迎的程度似乎隨著冠狀病毒在全球擴散。」她說幾個星期前，她開始注意到朋友們在分享視訊聊天室的螢幕截圖，一群朋友對著手機鏡頭開心地聊天喝酒。</p>
<p>金融時報說，就和防疫期間流行視訊會議軟體如Zoom或Google Hangouts，Houseparty似乎也正開始建立一套視訊社交的儀式規範。許多人在居家隔離期間，用Houseparty一起開視訊共進晚餐。一些人管它叫“AperiTV”（取其aperitif，餐前酒的諧音。）有矽谷的科技公司則利用它舉行「虛擬快樂時光」。</p>
<p>（資料來源：SensorTower/ FT）</p>
<p>Houseparty的共同創辦人魯賓（Ben Rubin）在金融時報的訪問中說，Houseparty過去就受到年輕人的歡迎。「不過，在如今情況下，許多大人們現在有時間、也有需求要找到新的連結方式。」</p>
<p>強調「共享體驗」（shared experience）的Houseparty，提供了一些內建的遊戲（像是冷知識的趣味問答），甚至讓朋友們一起參加交友網站或是共同觀看電視節目。自然流暢（spontaneity）是它吸引用戶的關鍵。它盡可能模仿家庭派對裡該有的情境，比如說它可以讓朋友們分組對談，提醒用戶有哪些新朋友加入，並顯示誰正和誰在聊天。你也可以隨時插入朋友聊天的話題，除非他們正在闢室密談而設定了「封鎖」。</p>
<p>Hosueparty原本只是50人的小公司，創立之初就強調他們絕不會像Facebook一樣，利用用戶資料和廣告來賺錢。這個目標在去年公司被遊戲開發公司Epic Games買下之後，似乎是更容易達成了。推出「要塞英雄」（Fortnite）等熱門遊戲的Epic Games再重新整合後可以提供Houseparty免費的遊戲，而Houseparty的技術和工具則強化了線上遊戲平台的社交元素。</p>
<p>從長期角度來看，我們無法知道Houseparty的走紅，是否只是疫情肆虐下的一時熱潮，不過這類型的視訊平台，顯然將是我們未來溝通方式的常態。</p>

<p>With more and more people needing to stay home right now, the ability to have those fun parties on the weekends has sort of been taken away from us. Well, with Houseparty, the fun doesn&rsquo;t have to stop (until it gets too late), as you can party with up to seven of your friends right from your phone.</p>
<p>Party like its 2020 Houseparty Houseparty makes it possible for you and seven other friends to have a good time without leaving the house. You can play a few party games together, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about what phones your friends are using, and you can catch up water-cooler style with everyone. Free w/ IAP at Google Play</p>
<p>Have a party without leaving the house Are you tired of being stuck in the house with nowhere to go and no parties to attend? With Houseparty, you can have a party wherever you are! The app launched in February 2016 and comes from the same developers behind the now-defunct Meerkat app. In case you don&rsquo;t remember, Meerkat was another app that let you broadcast live video straight from your device. After a little more than a year, the doors to Meerkat were closed as the developers created Houseparty, which supplanted it. Best online learning tools for kids: ABCmouse, Reading IQ, &amp; more The premise of Houseparty is simple — have a party with your friends, from the confines of your own home. There are in-app games and the ability for you to be a part of different rooms, similar to that of walking from room-to-room at an actual house party. Who can download and use Houseparty?</p>
<p>Source: Chrome Web Store</p>
<p>The great thing about Houseparty is the fact that it&rsquo;s available on all platforms. There&rsquo;s no &ldquo;green bubble vs. blue bubble&rdquo; problem to worry about, as Houseparty is available on the following platforms: Android</p>
<p>iOS</p>
<p>macOS</p>
<p>Windows (with a Chrome extension) The only potential hiccup is that Windows users will have to download and use the Chrome extension. We would have liked to see a fully-fledged desktop app similar to macOS, but it just doesn&rsquo;t seem to be in the cards. Getting started with your Houseparty</p>
<p>Source: Andrew Myrick / Android Central</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to sign up for Houseparty as the app is completely free, and requires just an email address. During the initial process, Houseparty asks for your cell phone number only to verify who you are. This is just another method of two-factor authentication that is prevalent in a lot of apps today. Instead of other apps like Google Duo which require your cell phone number to get running, Houseparty does not. You&rsquo;ll go through and attach your email address along with creating a unique username. Doing so makes it easy for you to give someone your username instead of giving them your cell number.</p>
<p>Source: Andrew Myrick / Android Central</p>
<p>After granting Houseparty access to your Camera, Microphone, and Location, you are dropped right into the app. The initial screen shows you any of your contacts, or you can search for a specific person. Swiping down on the Contacts screen shows what the party members will see; a livestream of your beautiful face. Plus, there are various controls around the edges of the screen for you to take advantage of. Swiping down on the Contacts screen shows a livestream of your beautiful face. As for finding other Houseparty members, the app takes a look at your contact list to see if any of your other friends are already using the app. Plus, there is some Facebook integration, so you can link the two accounts and find even more potential Houseparty attendees. How to find and add contacts to your Houseparty</p>
<p>Source: Andrew Myrick / Android Central</p>
<p>During the initial setup of Houseparty, the app requests access to your Contact list, along with providing the ability to link your Facebook app. These are two ways for you to be able to get started with a few partiers (hopefully) right from the get-go. Houseparty also makes it easy to find and add more friends to your contact list, even after the initial setup. By tapping the Plus (+) icon in the top right, you can add friends and are provided with a few different options: Add by Name</p>
<p>Add from Contacts</p>
<p>Add from Facebook</p>
<p>Add Nearby</p>
<p>Copy Profile Link</p>
<p>Source: Andrew Myrick / Android Central</p>
<p>Remember where we said that Houseparty requested access to your location? That&rsquo;s where the &ldquo;Nearby&rdquo; functionality comes in. If someone near you just downloaded Houseparty and wants to get in on the fun, you can invite them by both parties opening the Nearby screen. Just tap on the contact, and continue the fun. You can share your profile link in any messaging platform. A unique link is generated within the app, and when you copy the Profile Link, you can paste it in any of your other messaging platforms. As for the Profile Link, this is created so that you can quickly send invites to your friends over more traditional platforms. This makes it easy to get more of your friends into the party. In-call options</p>
<p>Source: Andrew Myrick / Android Central</p>
<p>So what controls do you have from within your party? There are actually quite a few, although these are more like optional features instead of actual potential limiters. At the bottom of the screen, there are buttons for the following: Toggle Camera On or Off</p>
<p>Switch from front to rear camera</p>
<p>Lock the Room</p>
<p>Toggle Microphone On or Off</p>
<p>Source: Houseparty</p>
<p>In the top right-hand corner, below the Add Friends button, there are a set of die. Tapping this opens up some fun party games for you and your party mates to play: Heads Up!</p>
<p>Trivia</p>
<p>Chips and Guac</p>
<p>Quick Draw! Heads Up! and Quick Draw! are two games that you&rsquo;ve likely heard of or played before. These are adaptations of the popular Play Store games that have been integrated directly into the app. So once everyone has joined the party, just pick a game and start playing! Leave a Facemail</p>
<p>Source: Andrew Myrick / Android Central</p>
<p>Since you aren&rsquo;t going to be in the same place as the other party-goers, sometimes you&rsquo;ll need to send a gentle reminder. Instead of doing the boring ole&rsquo; thing of sending a text, you can leave a &ldquo;Facemail&rdquo; from within the Houseparty app. This is pretty simple too, as you&rsquo;ll need to swipe left from the &ldquo;Add contacts&rdquo; menu, and you&rsquo;ll be taken to the Inbox. After you find the friend(s) that you want to leave a Facemail for, tap their contact info and record. This will record a short video, which will appear in their Inbox the next time that the Houseparty app is opened. Perhaps another exciting aspect of Facemail is that you can record highlights from a party and share them. This is an easy way to make sure your friends don&rsquo;t miss out on another great party (read as: guilt them to coming next time). Keep your party private There have been rumors swirling around Houseparty users that their accounts have been &ldquo;hacked&rdquo;. The eyebrows started to get raised after folks began seeing random users and strangers joining their &ldquo;parties&rdquo;, even without being invited. As it turns out, this is not exactly a hack, but instead is a feature of the app, for better or worse.</p>
<p>Source: iMore</p>
<p>In the event that you want to keep Houseparty rolling, but want to keep your parties to you and your friends, you&rsquo;ll need to create a private room. This can be done from the app by heading into Account &gt; Settings &gt; Private Mode. Houseparty itself has tweeted stating that all of the user accounts are safe, and have not been compromised in anyway. This is after people have attempted to delete the user account, only to be met with a message saying that the password doesn&rsquo;t match, along with failed logins from other countries.</p>
<p>Source: iMore</p>
<p>But that hasn&rsquo;t stopped folks from wanting to delete the app altogether from their devices. In order to do so, head into Account &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Delete Account. You&rsquo;ll need to confirm your password, and then the account will be deleted. What&rsquo;s the catch? It&rsquo;s rare to find an app that is not only free but doesn&rsquo;t want to dig too deep or ask for too many permissions. That&rsquo;s not an issue with Houseparty, as you can give the app as much or little information that you&rsquo;d like, other than creating an account. The only significant limitation that we see with using this is that you can only have eight members in a room at a single time. However, if you have a big group of friends, you can create multiple rooms and then switch between them as you see fit. And if you want to have a private party, you can start with the built-in Private Mode. This must be toggled on in the Settings panel, which can be accessed by tapping the Gear icon on your Friends list, in the top left-hand corner. The room that is created will be automatically locked so that nobody can see the party taking place. But Houseparty isn&rsquo;t the only way to have a group video chat, as there are plenty of other options to download and tinker with if you want to have a party without leaving the confines of your home.

<h3 id="is-houseparty-safe-video-chat-apps-creepy-porn-bombing-trend-and-privacy-fears-revealed">Is Houseparty safe? Video chat app&rsquo;s creepy &lsquo;porn-bombing&rsquo; trend and privacy fears revealed</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/PARTY-e1585591980827.png?strip=all&amp;quality=100&amp;w=1200&amp;h=800&amp;crop=1" alt="img">
AS millions around the world self-isolate during the coronavirus pandemic, the Houseparty app has soared to immense popularity.</p>
<p>This genius video calling app lets you chat with pals, play games and more – but is it safe and can it be hacked?</p>
<p>The Houseparty app lets you hang out with pals in a virtual environment Credit: House Party</p>
<p>Is Houseparty safe?</p>
<p>On the whole, Houseparty appears to be largely safe to use.</p>
<p>The app has seen pranksters hopping into calls to cause havoc – but there are ways to get around this.</p>
<p>And the app does also ask for a large amount of information, which may worry the privacy-conscious.</p>
<p>However, with the right settings, you can have a great time on Houseparty.</p>
<p>Exactly how safe is the popular app? Credit: House Party</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s always worth remembering that no app or service is ever truly safe.</p>
<p>Even tech titans like Facebook can suffer hacks or leaks, so always be vigilant with your information online.</p>
<p>Houseparty hack rumours</p>
<p>In late March 2020, rumours began circulating that suggesting a major Houseparty hack.</p>
<p>Users flooded to Twitter reporting other accounts – like Spotify or PayPal – had been hijacked after downloading Houseparty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear if Houseparty is linked to these breaches, but the app&rsquo;s creators denied that a breach had taken place.</p>
<p>Houseparty is owned and operated by Epic Games, the major US firm behind hit games Fortnite and Gears of War.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We’ve found no evidence to suggest a link between Houseparty and the compromises of other unrelated accounts,&rdquo; an Epic Games spokesperson told The Sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a general rule, we suggest all users choose strong passwords when creating online accounts on any platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use a unique password for each account, and use a password generator or password manager to keep track of passwords, rather than using passwords that are short and simple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uploading all of your contacts</p>
<p>One of the big red flags for true privacy die-hards is the networking system.</p>
<p>When you sign up, you&rsquo;re asked to hand over your entire list of contacts – which will be stored on Houseparty servers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you choose to import your personal contacts from your mobile device we will access your personal contacts in order to identify Users that you may know that are using the Services and to provide other Users with suggestions for potential Connections based on mutual contacts,&rdquo; Houseparty&rsquo;s privacy policy explains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Note, however, that we will never share your phone number or the phone numbers of third parties in your Contacts with anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a shady tactic: it simply lets the app connect you with pals.</p>
<p>But in a world where hacks and leaks are rife, handing over contact info for everyone you know won&rsquo;t sit well with everyone.</p>
<p>The good news is that it&rsquo;s possible to entirely avoid handing over your contacts to Houseparty.</p>
<p>Just press Skip when prompted, and your contacts won&rsquo;t be uploaded.</p>
<p>The app still works fine without contacts, and you can add friends, join and host calls, play games and everything else you&rsquo;d normally do.</p>

<p>Strangers &lsquo;porn-bombing&rsquo; your calls</p>
<p>Porn-bombing isn&rsquo;t a problem specific to Houseparty – but it certainly exists.</p>
<p>Just like on Zoom, it&rsquo;s relatively easy to find and access another person&rsquo;s group call.</p>
<p>This has led to twisted pranksters hopping into video calls to show off pornographic content – or their own naked form.</p>
<p>As such, it&rsquo;s important to keep your room &ldquo;locked&rdquo; if you can help it.</p>
<p>And try to avoid adding anyone you don&rsquo;t know as a friend.</p>
<p>Unlocked rooms</p>
<p>Basically anyone can enter one of your video chats – unless you make it private.</p>
<p>The obvious answer to many of Houseparty&rsquo;s problems is simply to &ldquo;lock&rdquo; your rooms entirely.</p>
<p>You can do this by hitting the padlock button when you&rsquo;re in the app.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still possible to invite people to the call – but that&rsquo;s the only way for someone to join.</p>
<p>This has a downside: pals can&rsquo;t just hop into your room when they like if it&rsquo;s locked.</p>
<p>That does remove the &ldquo;house party&rdquo; vibe somewhat, but it&rsquo;s a small price to pay to avoid having a stranger wave his todger at you over the internet.</p>
