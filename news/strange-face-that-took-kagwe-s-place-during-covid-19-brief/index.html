The face of the Covid-19 briefs has for a long time been associated with Health Cabinet Secretary (CS) Mutahi Kagwe and the Health Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) Mercy Mwangangi.</p>
<p>However, On Friday, April 24, Kenyans were left with many questions when a new face stepped in to inform the country on the status of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The strange face belonged to Rashid A. Aman, the second CAS in the Ministry of Health (MoH), serving alongside CAS Mwangangi who is a recent entrant into public service.</p>
<p>CAS Aman was selected into the Cabinet by President Uhuru Kenyatta to serve alongside Engineer Peter Tum during Sicily Kariuki tenure as the Health CS.</p>

<p>Aman is a man with vast experience in the health sector, being the holder of a Bachelor of Pharmacy degree from the University of Nairobi and a PhD in Pharmaceutical Chemistry from the University of California in San Francisco.</p>
<p>He is also the custodian of the Hedida Post-Doctoral Fellowship at the School of Medicine, Stanford University, at Stanford, California in the USA (1985-1988), after which he joined the National Cancer Institute of the NIH at Frederick in Maryland in the USA as a Fogarty Visiting Associate(1988–1990).</p>
<p>In terms of career and service, Aman is currently the Chairman of the Kenya National Commission for UNESCO and a Council member of the Taita Taveta University.</p>
<p>He has also served as Director on the Boards of several institutions including Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and the National Museums of Kenya and is also an Honorary Research Professor at Strathmore University and a Senior Research Affiliate at the National Museums of Kenya.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr Aman joined the National Museums of Kenya in 1990 where he has served in various positions for over 15years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the time he left the National Museums of Kenya in 2003, he had risen to the position of Deputy Director in charge of research, leaving behind a strong track record of institutional and human capital development in the applications of molecular genetics in the study of infectious agents and the diversity of life,&rdquo; his profile on the Kenya Mental Health Conference 2019 website reads.</p>
<p>He was also announced to be having research interests in Molecular and Biochemical Parasitology, Molecular Genetics, Biodiversity, Biotechnology, Environmental Science, Drug Policy, Management and Regulation, Clinical Pharmacology, and Clinical Trials.</p>
<p>As a businessman, Aman is the founder of a number of private organizations including the Centre for Drug Management (CEDMAP) and the African Centre for Clinical Trials (ACCT), both of which he directs and is active in training, research, and consultancy.

<h3 id="state-open-to-trials-of-new-virus-vaccine--the-standard">State open to trials of new virus vaccine : The Standard</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/images/friday/state_open_to_trials5ea31e05b6b01.jpg" alt="img">
State open to trials of new virus vaccine</p>
<p>The government is open to a plan by United Kingdom-based scientists to try out a Covid-19 vaccine in the country. Health Chief Administrative Secretary Rashid Aman yesterday said although a formal request had not been made to the government by the scientists at Oxford University, once made, it would be considered. An article published by the BBC on Thursday indicated that the UK was considering testing the vaccine in Kenya.</p>

<p>“If this request comes to us, it will be scrutinised by the government before we respond to it,” said Dr Aman. The CAS said even with the expression of interest by the scientists, Kenya had detailed guidelines for such an activity to be carried out in the country. “There are laid down procedures, which are rigorous for approval of any trial,” he said.</p>

<p>He added: “We have a robust structure at Pharmacy and Poisons Board for regulating any clinical trial.” The clinical trials of the said vaccine, which is said to have the ability to boost one’s immunity with just one dose, started in the UK on Thursday.</p>

<p>Some 800 people are targeted. The vaccine is the latest strand of hope against Covid-19 after both Remdisivir and Hydroxychloroquine drugs failed clinical trials as potential treatment to the disease. The vaccine is made from a weakened version of common cold virus, extracted from chimpanzees, and modified so that it does not replicate in humans. However, it is not clear how soon the vaccine or a report on its efficacy will be ready since the scientists have to wait and see if any of the 800 volunteers will be infected.</p>

<p>Only half of the 800 will be injected with the vaccine while the other half will be a control group who to be immunised against meningitis. The interest of the scientists in Kenya, as reported by the BBC, has been informed by the low number of infections in the country, which currently stands at two per cent. This means only two of 100 people tested turn positive. As of yesterday, the number of coronavirus cases in Kenya had hit 336 after 16 more people tested positive. The 16 were from 946 samples collected across 12 counties.</p>

<p>Of the 16, 11 are from Nairobi and five from Mombasa. Some 887 contacts are still on follow-up, with the number of recoveries rising to 94 after five more patients tested negative. Death toll from the virus is still 14.</p>

Kenyans will not be used as Coronavirus vaccine guinea pigs – Uhuru</p>
<p>President Uhuru Kenyatta (pictured) has dismissed as untrue media reports attributed to an Oxford University researcher that they would use Kenyans to test a Coronavirus vaccine being developed by the British institution.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the president said local research institutions, such as KEMRI, were working on their own vaccines and would collaborate with international partners.</p>
