The 2012 Brazilian Grand Prix marked the official final race for F1 legend, Michael Schumacher. Although he stepped away at the end of the 2006 season, he returned in 2010 with the Mercedes F1 team. After three years, which bore just one pole position and one podium, the 7-time world champion retired for good.</p>
<p>At the final race of the season, Michael Schumacher delivered an emotionally-charged message meant for the team. He said, ‚ÄúGuys, I‚Äôm on the way to the grid. I would like to use the opportunity to say thank you to all the boys, all the mechanics, the engineers who I have been working with. I would like to say as well, thank you to all the people that have been following us around the world, everywhere, watching us on television‚Äù</p>
<p>He continued, ‚ÄúStaying on track, sharing all the emotions and all the good times that we have had together. I just want to say thank you for being there with us and sharing my particular passion for so long. Thanks for all of these wonderful times and good memories. It‚Äôs gonna be‚Ä¶ Thanks again. Now, let‚Äôs go and get ready to rumble, for another good race.‚Äù</p>
<p>While most eyes were on the duel at the front‚Ä¶ Formula 1&rsquo;s most successful champion was beginning an emotional final Grand Prix for @MercedesAMGF1 üëè#F1Rewind ‚è™ #F1 @emirates pic.twitter.com/kpmJZYYGOa ‚Äî Formula 1 (@F1) April 25, 2020</p>
<p>Mercedes paid tribute to Michael Schumacher and his contribution to the team</p>
<p>An equally emotional Ross Brawn got on the radio and thanked the German legend. He confessed that it was a privilege and honour to work alongside him. The two have worked alongside each other right from the time when they were in Benetton, to the hugely successful Ferrari era and now with Mercedes.</p>
<p>Sadly, Michael Schumacher ended the race in a disappointing 7th place and denied a swan song. However, he can take pride in the fact that he went out on a high note, with his Valencia GP podium. In addition to that, he grabbed pole position in Monaco, though he later copped a penalty for an infringement in the previous race.</p>
<p>To this day, Michael Schumacher is steadily trying to recover from his traumatic skiing accident

Meeting legends, people you have looked up to, in real life can go one of two ways. They‚Äôre not anything like you expected and you‚Äôre left disappointed, or they meet your expectations. It was certainly the latter when Leclerc met seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher‚Ä¶</p>
<p>During a break in kart testing in the mid-2000s, at Circuit Paul Ricard, Leclerc and some of his competitors were invited to pop into the adjacent F1 track to meet Schumacher while he was testing at the French venue with Ferrari.</p>
<p>Leclerc tweeted a picture of the meeting last week, showing the German signing their overalls, saying: ‚ÄúI never thought I would be driving for the same team he was driving for back then.‚Äù</p>
<p>During an interview with Formula1.com, Leclerc recalls being in awe of meeting F1‚Äôs most successful racing driver and was immensely grateful he found time to chat to them.

<h3 id="former-manager-reveals-why-michael-schumacher-failed-with-mercedes-on-his-f1-comeback">Former Manager Reveals Why Michael Schumacher Failed With Mercedes on His F1 Comeback</h3>
<p><img src="https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/20200422141419/msc-2.jpg" alt="img">
‚ÄúMichael failed at Mercedes‚Äù, that is the view of Willi Weber, who managed Michael Schumacher for the entirety of his Formula 1 career. Weber believes the 7 times World Champion struggled on his F1 comeback due to the nature of the newer cars. Schumacher retired in 2012 after a comeback that wasn‚Äôt very successful.</p>
<p>Michael Schumacher and his struggles at Mercedes</p>
<p>When Michael Schumacher announced his F1 return in 2010, it seemed like the king had returned to reclaim his lost crown. Title number eighth looked closer than ever and Michael was itching to stand on the top step of the podium once again. A German driver driving for a very familiar German team that Ross Brawn spearheaded. Many expected Schumacher to pick up where he left off but it never came to pass.</p>
<p>Sadly, Michel‚Äôs younger and less experienced teammate beat him in all aspects over the course of his time at Mercedes. While some pin the blame on Michael‚Äôs age, many believe the car was the main reason for Schumacher‚Äôs poor form. The Mercedes from 10 years ago was nowhere near the powerhouse that it is today.</p>
<p>The early models of the German team weren‚Äôt particularly competitive but Michael really struggled to unlock the car‚Äôs true potential. Recently, Former Ferrari engineer John Barnard revealed that Michael‚Äôs struggles at Mercedes were partly due to the car setup. According to the Briton, the Mercedes car setup wasn‚Äôt suited to Schumacher‚Äôs driving style and was part of a different generation.</p>
<p>Now, Schumacher‚Äôs long time manager Willi Webber opened up on the German‚Äôs final years at Mercedes. Weber also feels Michael struggled at Mercedes mainly due to the car. Speaking to the Kolner Express, Weber said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was a different technology and driver generation,‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMichael couldn‚Äôt compensate for it, even though he was as fit as ever. ‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMichael failed at Mercedes. If only he had listened to me this time. He tried everything and made the car faster together with Rosberg so that Mercedes could become a world champion so often. But it was still as unnecessary as a goiter. ‚Äú</p>
<p>However, Weber concluded by admitting that the 7 times Champions was still the greatest in F1.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMichael is and remains the best Formula 1 driver in the world.
