<p>Sinéad O’Connor’s “Nothing Compares 2 U” was one of the most iconic music videos of the 1990s. Miley Cyrus’ “Wrecking Ball” was one of the most iconic music videos of the 2010s. Oddly enough, there’s a direct link between the two.</p>
<p>Cyrus’ video was partly inspired by O’Connor’s. Some artists like it when another artist takes inspiration from their work. O’Connor, however, had some choice words for Cyrus.</p>

<p>The connection between ‘Nothing Compares 2 U’ and ‘Wrecking Ball’</p>
<p>The video for “Nothing Compares 2 U” famously features O’Connor crying while looking directly at the audience. She has little hair on her head in the video. Many people found this image striking, and it became the subject of parodies.</p>
<p>In parts of the “Wrecking Ball” video, Cyrus cries while looking at the camera. She has a short haircut in the video. The shots of O’Connor crying certainly warrant comparison to the shots of Cyrus crying.</p>
<p>In fact, Cyrus told Rolling Stone the video for “Wrecking Ball” took direct inspiration from the video for “Nothing Compares 2 U.” O’Connor was aware of this. She responded to Cyrus’ homage with an open letter published in The Guardian. O’Connor said she wrote the letter with an intention to mentor Cyrus.</p>

<p>Sinead O’Connor’s issue with Miley Cyrus</p>
<p>O’Connor wrote “I am extremely concerned for you that those around you have led you to believe, or encouraged you in your own belief, that it is in any way ‘cool’ to be naked and licking sledgehammers in your videos. It is in fact the case that you will obscure your talent by allowing yourself to be pimped, whether its the music business or yourself doing the pimping.”</p>
<p>She continued: “Nothing but harm will come in the long run, from allowing yourself to be exploited, and it is absolutely NOT in ANY way an empowerment of yourself or any other young women, for you to send across the message that you are to be valued (even by you) more for your sexual appeal than your obvious talent. I am happy to hear I am somewhat of a role model for you and I hope…you will pay close attention to what I am telling you.”</p>

<p>Miley Cyrus responds</p>
<p>Cyrus did respond to O’Connor. According to Entertainment Weekly, Cyrus highlighted old tweets by O’Connor where she discussed her struggles with mental health. Furthermore, Cyrus compared O’Connor to Amanda Bynes, anther celebrity whose struggles with mental health have been public.</p>
<p>O’Connor responded. She decried Cyrus’ decision to “mock” her and Bynes. She also took issue with Cyrus for responding to her letter in such a way when the letter was written with good intentions.</p>
<p>Both O’Connor’s letter and Cyrus’ tweets received criticism. Some felt O’Connor was shaming Cyrus whereas others felt she was looking out for her. In addition, many felt Cyrus had handled the issue of mental health very poorly.</p>

<h3 id="glassgow-pursues-more-hotel-towers-despite-downturn--daily-business-magazine">&ldquo;&lsquo;Glassgow&rsquo; pursues more hotel towers despite downturn – Daily Business Magazine&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/magazine.dailybusinessgroup.co.uk/wp_mag14/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/West-Nile-Nyx-hotel-Glasgow.png?fit=822%2C544&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
As I See It: Terry Murden</p>
<p>Another large hotel development has been approved in Glasgow which suggests the City Council is more optimistic than some about prospects for the leisure and business tourism sector.</p>
<p>There were already thousands of objections to the £30 million development at the junction of West Nile Street and Bath Street from those who did not want to see it replace five buildings, including a historic pub which has been a gathering place for fans of the Scotland national football team.</p>
<p>But Glasgow claims to have a shortage of hotels. At least pre-Covid. Hundreds of extra rooms have, and are still, being planned. A study published in February found there were about £260 million-worth of hotel deals last year in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, and Inverness as overseas visitors and conference delegates poured into Scotland. Glasgow accounted for £170m of this investment across nine transactions.</p>
<p>But that was then. A lot has changed in the last three months and with numerous hoteliers now closing or threatening hundreds of job losses the council’s decision to allow another development looks all the more questionable.</p>
<p>Macdonald Hotels, the Crieff Hydro chain, Apex Hotels, the Kimpton Blythswood Square, the Grand Central, InterContinental Hotels Group… just some of those currently counting the worry beads. Seven hotels in the Specialist Leisure Group in the Highlands and Borders have ceased trading.</p>
<p>The West Nile Street site is expected to become a NYX hotel, a lifestyle brand operated by Leonardo Hotels which has similar plans for Edinburgh. The developer, George Capital, and the hotel operator clearly still have faith in a sector which fears for its future.</p>
<p>The historic Iron Horse pub will make way for an enormous glass hotel</p>
<p>Glasgow council, still believing the city to be the nation’s style-capital, appears to have been lured by promises of a rooftop restaurant (this in a city with more than its fair share of rain and biting winds) and, of course, “new jobs”.</p>
<p>The jobs angle is always dangled before councillors who feel under pressure not to be accused of turning down employment opportunities. In this case, they also seem to have been persuaded to believe a demolition report which said the current building has no architectural merit.</p>
<p>That depends on what sort of Glasgow you prefer: one with a mix of community facilities, characterful and human scale properties, or a city steadily filling up with enormous and featureless glass boxes, including the huge Virgin Money building going up in Bothwell Street. Do glass boxes have any greater architectural merit than a building that has served the city since the middle of the 19th century? The city is becoming so fond of glazed buildings it ought to be renamed Glassgow.</p>
<p>The Iron Horse pub, which closed in February when its lease and those of its neighbours expired, dates back to 1872 but if the city really does have pride in its roots, its characters and its hospitality then it must have represented an opportunity.</p>
<p>The city is becoming so fond of glazed buildings it ought to be renamed Glassgow</p>
<p>The pub was certainly not without its supporters. It scored four stars on the TripAdvisor website and as well as being the “spiritual home” of the Tartan Army it hosted various local groups such as the Malt whisky club, the RAF society and even the Star Trek club. A petition created on behalf of the bar garnered thousands of signatures with some objectors coming from Australia, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Philippines, Poland, Spain and the US.</p>
<p>They have been ignored. The sad fact is that many of the visitors that these big hotels hope to accommodate are looking for just the sort of ‘old Glasgow’ character that these buildings are steadily replacing. In that regard, the city clearly hasn’t learned from its past mistakes. Ironically, it was the demolition of a much-loved hotel – St Enoch – that represents one its biggest errors and which might now have helped solve its accommodation needs without the need to keep swinging the wrecking ball.</p>
<p>The danger, economically, is that the council is planning for a future that in the post-Covid world will look very different. Business tourism is expected to fall more heavily than leisure visitors. Not only will hotels face tougher competition, but student accommodation, another recent boom sector, may struggle as overseas students stay away.</p>
<p>The council needs to adjust to this new reality and ask why pubs like the Iron Horse survived for 150 years and why it’s only when they’re gone that we regret losing another piece of the city’s fabric.

<h3 id="friday-essay-taking-a-wrecking-ball-to-monuments--contemporary-art-can-ask-what-really-needs-tearing-down">&ldquo;Friday essay: taking a wrecking ball to monuments – contemporary art can ask what really needs tearing down&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/341059/original/file-20200611-114080-j58km.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;rect=11%2C89%2C1876%2C937&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1356&amp;h=668&amp;fit=crop" alt="img">
As the Black Lives Matter protests raged across the world, I was sent a post on Facebook that read,</p>
<p>Donald J Trump now lives at 1600 Black Lives Matter Plaza, NW, Washington, DC 20500.</p>
<p>The post referred to the mural painted in front of Lafayette Square. In bright yellow paint, the words “Black Lives Matter” stretched from sidewalk to sidewalk over two city blocks. The work was commissioned by DC’s mayor Muriel Bowser, who also renamed the area Black Lives Matter Plaza.</p>
<p>The artwork is a powerful symbol, made even more so because of its visibility and prominence in a public space – and local government endorsement. It will serve to remind everyone of this moment in history, including the violence perpetrated against protesters by police to clear the streets for a presidential photo opportunity in front of a church.</p>
<p>Contemporary art can be transformative, especially when located in public spaces. Historical monuments have the same kind of power. They are a physical reminder created to commemorate a person or event who is deemed worth remembering.</p>
<p>Now is the time to ask which monuments can withstand introspection and revision. Artists are opening those conversations – creatively and sometimes hilariously.</p>
<p>Tearing down history</p>
<p>Around the world, we have seen colonial monuments attracting the rage of protestors who don’t want to see the continual memorialising of men known for their violent and oppressive actions.</p>
<p>In Bristol in the UK, the statue of Edward Colston, a 17th century slave trader, was torn down, dragged through the streets, and thrown into the harbour. Colston was a member of the Royal African Company and responsible for enslaving approximately 80,000 men, women and children and forcibly removing them from Africa to the Americas. His statue is a tangible reminder their lives were considered insignificant.</p>
<p>In the US, statues of Christopher Columbus have been beheaded. Columbus, once celebrated for “discovering” the US, has in recent times been reviled for his brutality toward Native American people, with many states and cities replacing the annual Columbus Day with Indigenous People’s Day.</p>
<p>In the US, most of the targeted statues have been of Confederate memorials in cities across the south. The statue of Confederate General Robert E Lee will be removed from its prominent position in the centre of the town of Richmond, Virginia, with Governor Ralph Northam pledging the state will no longer preach a “false version of history”.</p>
<p>Australians are also questioning whether colonial monuments – standing prominently in towns and cities – should remain. The same question is being asked of past film and television productions. This week, Netflix removed four Chris Lilley programs from its library, some of which originally aired on the ABC, in which the comedian used “brown face” makeup and racial stereotypes to depict characters of colour.</p>
<p>Read more: Ten Twitter accounts you should be following if you want to listen to Indigenous Australians and learn</p>
<p>Yesterday, Today show journalist and Gamilaroi/Gomeroi woman Brooke Boney broke down the tension behind the issue to her Channel 9 audience:</p>
<p>Does going through the archives and tearing down art that’s been made in the past really help us move forward? If I have children, I don’t want them to see and think that is how they fit into the world. But I’d also like to be able to show them how poorly our people were thought of and treated in the past.</p>
<p>Can we contemplate a horizon whereby narratives of nation are represented by less harmful and more truthful physical constructions? Their presence is not neutral. They masquerade as benign signifiers of nation building when, in fact, they are inscribed with a violent history that reminds Indigenous people of their dispossession and enduring trauma.</p>
<p>Swinging through</p>
<p>Enter Tony Albert, a politically-minded artist provoked by stereotypical representations of Aboriginal people, and hailed as one of our most exciting contemporary Australian artists. His previous works have used drawing, painting, photography and installation. He’s also incorporated a collection of “Aboriginalia” – retro and household kitsch objects depicting Aboriginal people and their culture.</p>
<p>His new artwork, titled You Wreck Me, is a video that invokes the mythology of the trickster, here to relay important moral and life lessons. The work brings to the fore the ongoing discussions about memorialisation and nationalism through the lens of parody.</p>
<p>In the video, Tony Albert is painted up for ceremony while straddling an exercise ball in a comedic representation of Miley Cyrus’s infamous video clip, Wrecking Ball. Singing (badly) and swinging, he shatters statues of Captain James Cook.</p>
<p>Artists like Albert are asserting their existence in contemporary Australia in myriad ways, including using humour to challenge the continual idolisation of the legacies of colonialism littering our public spaces.</p>
<p>Albert’s work comes at a time as many Indigenous and non-Indigenous people across Australia are calling for the removal of colonial monuments. There is a growing movement towards a more equitable and fair society.</p>
<p>Gamilaroi/Darug multimedia artist Travis De Vries presciently captured this in his 2019 digital print Cook Falling, Tear it Down. It showed a scene in Hyde Park, Sydney, with a group of Aboriginal people using a rope to pull down a statue of Captain Cook by the neck.</p>
<p>Truth telling has been the focus of Indigenous and non-Indigenous relationships for some time as noted by the 2019 NAIDOC theme: VOICE. TREATY. TRUTH.</p>
<p>The colonial monuments speak to the erasure of our histories as noted by Stan Grant in 2017 when he said:</p>
<p>the monument of Captain Cook speaks to the emptiness, it speaks to our invisibility; it says that nothing truly mattered, nothing truly counted until a white sailor first walked on these shores.</p>
<p>Read more: Monumental errors: how Australia can fix its racist colonial statues</p>
<p>Deeper than monuments</p>
<p>I personally do not care if the colonial monuments are torn down. What I do know is that while this would be symbolically important, their removal will not remove the attitudes and institutional racism behind their creation.</p>
<p>The reason these debates are raging and the reactions from many non-Indigenous people are so vehement, is because their legacies still endure. Removing the statues will not automatically end the legacy.</p>
<p>I am also aware their removal would allow another kind of amnesia where the trauma and violence experienced by Aboriginal people could be “forgotten”. Other options are being debated – removing monuments and housing them in museums, creating parks where they can stand and be used for educational purposes.</p>
<p>Some have pointed to artworks like the huge yellow slogan in Washington DC and demanded more from leaders. “It’s not enough to have a pretty painting in the middle of the street; we need politics,” Mckayla Wilkes, an activist for criminal justice reform, told The New Yorker.</p>
<p>Just ignoring the issue is not an option, because it also ignores who has the right to determine which histories are able to be displayed in public spaces and continues to privilege one version of history while erasing the presence of Aboriginal people.

Miley Cyrus was one of the premier music video artists of 2010s. Her video for “We Can’t Stop” showed she had a knack for creating memorable imagery. However, her song ”Wrecking Ball” arguably inspired her most iconic music video.</p>
<p>Many fans can’t hear the song without thinking of the clip of a nude Cyrus riding a wrecking ball. It became an oft-parodied moment that completely shattered Cyrus’ former image as a Disney Channel actress. As the years went on, however, Cyrus’ views on the clip seem to have evolved over the years.</p>

<p>The famous scene that started out as a joke</p>
<p>One moment from the video everyone remembers is the scene where Cyrus licks a sledgehammer. Some people thought the scene was disgusting. Others thought it was sexy. Regardless, it’s stuck in the cultural memory bank for a lot of millennials and members of Generation Z.</p>
<p>The sledgehammer licking was Cyrus’ idea. According to Complex, Terry Richardson directed the video. He told Cyrus to appear as if she was both sad and in love with the sledgehammer. Richardson was pleased Cyrus looked liked she loved the hammer. Then, he was distraught when she started licking the hammer in jest.</p>

<p>Cyrus recalled “They were, like, ‘You can’t lick that thing! There’s paint!’ And, I’m like, I don’t care, I think this is actually going to be dope.” Cyrus’ decision made music video history and became one of the most widely-discussed moments from her career. It’s amazing to think such a famous image started out as a joke!</p>
<p>Miley Cyrus’ evolving thoughts on ‘Wrecking Ball’</p>
<p>When the video was released, many people focused on its sexuality more than anything else. Cyrus told fans there was more to the video than its sex appeal. Entertainment Weekly quoted Cyrus as saying “if people can take their minds off the obvious and go into their imagination and see what the video really means, it is so vulnerable. … If you look at my eyes, I look more sad than actually my voice sounds on the record. It was a lot harder to actually do the video than it was to even record the song. It was much more of an emotional experience.”</p>

<p>Apparently, Cyrus initially wanted to downplay the risque aspects of the video. However, she seems to have some regret over the sledgehammer scene. According to Entertainment Tonight, Cyrus said “‘Wrecking Ball’ — I’ll do it, but I don’t love it. It’s when you’re so stoked about something and then you have to sing a song that bums you out. And I’ll never live down when I licked a sledgehammer.”</p>
<p>Cyrus licked a sledgehammer as a joke. She feels she won’t live that down. However, the moment remains one of the most famous images in the history of the music video.</p>

Langley Township council will deliberate the 71-year-old building’s future at its Monday meeting</p>
<p>Langley Township Councillor Eric Woodward has submitted a motion, to mayor and council, to demolish the Alder Inn. Those in opposition to the building’s destruction want to see it, as a piece of local history, preserved. (Aldergrove Star files)</p>
<p>Langley Township Councillor Eric Woodward has declared it’s time for the Alder Inn “to come down.”</p>
<p>Those words were not just lip service, either.</p>
<p>Woodward, in a Facebook post on Wednesday, outlined the motion he’s submitting for council’s consideration on Monday, June 15.</p>
<p>The local politician is proposing the demolition of the hotel at the corner of 272nd Street and Fraser Highway, which the Township acquired a year ago in a $5.4-million deal.</p>
<p>The downtown inn was most recently the home of a liquor store, bar, hotel, and strip club. It now sits empty after a September fire in a second-storey room.</p>

<p>Woodward is arguing that the cost of restoring the 71-year-old building – due to fire damage and long-term neglect – would outweigh the resulting benefits for Aldergrove’s business community.</p>
<p>“Retaining the current structure would be economically detrimental to the long-term residential and business interests in Aldergrove,” Woodward said.</p>
<p>The motion will have council consider replacing the Alder Inn with “positive, interim uses” like a walkable community garden and rear-lane parking.</p>
<p>He’s not the only one in favour of seeing the inn go.</p>
<p>RELATED: The Alder Inn: ‘Should it be saved?’</p>
<p>In a recent Aldergrove Community Association online poll, a majority of community stakeholders voted that they want to see the age-old inn demolished.</p>
<p>As of May 31, 82 responses were in favour of toppling the building, compared to 11 against it.</p>
<p>For those in favour of saving it, like Coun. Bob Long, their position is a matter of preserving local history.</p>
<p>“I think the building could be available now for someone with entrepreneurial spirit combined with a love for the town,” Long told the Aldergrove Star.</p>
<p>“I really see potential,” the councillor added, listing opportunities for the community to reuse the building.</p>
<p>As it stands, he says the building is in “fair condition,” and would be expensive to demolish.</p>
<p>Long is envisioning the building spruced up with a new facade, possibly some greenery atop its roof, and a new purpose in town.</p>
