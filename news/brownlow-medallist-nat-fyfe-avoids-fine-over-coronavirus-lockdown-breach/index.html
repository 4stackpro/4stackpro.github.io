He’s normally a model citizen, but dual Brownlow medallist Nat Fyfe came to the attention of the WA Premier and Police Commissioner on Thursday.</p>
<p>Fyfe was snapped at a beach in Margaret River, 30km from his city home.</p>
<p>Watch the video above</p>
<p>He lives in Perth, works in Fremantle, but with the AFL on hold, the Fremantle captain has been working for his family’s trucking business.</p>
<p>The business is based in Lake Grace, a five-hour, 400km drive from Gas Bay, where he detoured after picking up lime in Margaret River.</p>
<p>The club says surfing is part of his exercise regime, and working for the family business gives him access to drive between WA’s newly-created regions.</p>
<p>“With the appropriate exemption notice Nat has, for the past two-and-a-half weeks, been driving a truck for his family’s transport business, including carting lime out of Margaret River,” Fremantle CEO Simon Garlick said.</p>
<p>Nat Fyfe has been photographed surfing in Western Australia but the club says there’s a perfectly good reason for it. Credit: ABC</p>
<p>“Our understanding is that if you are approved to be in a different region for a period for legitimate work purposes then you can exercise in that region in accordance with the guidelines.</p>
<p>“Nat has been following all the regulations and guidelines regarding social distancing since they have been released and frequently updated, as everyone is endeavouring to do.”</p>
<p>Maintaining fitness</p>
<p>“As a club, we are encouraging our players to do whatever they can to keep occupied while the season is suspended, including working hard in an operating business as Nat has been doing,” Garlick said.</p>
<p>“We also require that our players maintain a high level of fitness and general well-being during this downtime by following a daily exercise regime.</p>
<p>“The club categorically supports Nat’s decision making throughout this episode.</p>

<p>“He understood he was doing so in accordance with all current responsible practices regarding social distancing.”</p>
<p>On Thursday evening it was confirmed that Fyfe has been cleared of any wrongdoing and will not receive a fine.</p>
<p>While Fyfe won’t be fined, Police Commissioner Chris Dawson said there were “some questions” around Fyfe’s actions.</p>
<p>“Surfing isn’t essential work, unless you’re a professional surfer,” he said at a press conference in Perth earlier on Thursday.</p>
<p>Perth’s city beaches remain open, but the Premier says they will be closed if people don’t stay 1.5 metres apart.

<h3 id="kane-cornes-reveals-brutal-nat-fyfe-sledge-that-ended-his-300-game-career">Kane Cornes reveals brutal Nat Fyfe sledge that ended his 300-game career</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/B881508643Z/1585900923879_GA52MUMU0.1-2.JPG?imwidth=1024" alt="img">
Two-time Brownlow medallist Nat Fyfe is known for many things- his impeccable talent, his proud Lake Grace roots – but one thing he’s lesser known for is ending Kane Cornes’ career.</p>
<p>After 300 games for Port Adelaide, Cornes retired in 2015, but he’s revealed Fyfe planted the seed it was time to hang up the boots a year before he actually did.</p>
<p>“The message from Ken Hinkley was pretty simple: do not let Fyfe touch the ball,” Cornes recalled of their round eight clash in 2014.</p>

<p>“So at the next stoppage, I went over and stood next to Nat Fyfe.</p>
<p>“He looked at me in amusement almost, I’ll never forget the look on his face, and he said to me with the ball only about 5m away, he forgot the ball and he just looked at me and said ‘bring your old skinny frail bones with me, we’re going straight to the goal square’.</p>

<p>“I thought ‘oh, here we go’.”</p>
<p>The Fremantle captain would go on to claim his first Brownlow medal the next season, and as he dominated a 15kg lighter Cornes, and he didn’t hesitate to let him know about it.</p>
<p>“He looked at me and said: ‘Told you old man, it’s going to be a pretty rough day for you’,” Cornes remembered.</p>
<p>“That was it and that was the moment that had me questioning my football future.</p>
<p>“It took me another 12 months before I actually did retire but I never ever forgot that sledge from Nat Fyfe.”
