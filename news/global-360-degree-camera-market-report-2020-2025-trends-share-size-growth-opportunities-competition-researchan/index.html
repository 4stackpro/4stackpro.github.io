The &ldquo;360-Degree Camera Market: Global Industry Trends, Share, Size, Growth, Opportunity and Forecast 2020-2025&rdquo; report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com&rsquo;s offering.</p>
<p>The global 360-degree camera market is currently witnessing robust growth. Looking forward, the market is projected to expand at a CAGR of around 25% during 2020-2025.</p>
<p>Widespread adoption of virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) systems in the interactive entertainment sector is one of the key factors driving the market growth. 360-degree cameras are widely used in video games, VR feature films, advertisements and adventure and sports activities to offer an immersive user experience.</p>
<p>Furthermore, extensive product utilization in the defense sector for surveillance and monitoring purposes is also providing a boost to the market growth.

<h3 id="all-the-oneplus-8-series-camera-details-have-just-leaked">All the OnePlus 8 series camera details have just leaked</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/oneplus-8-series-winfuture-920x470.jpg" alt="img">
WinFuture</p>
<p>The OnePlus 8 series launch is a week away, but we already have a ton of rumored specs to pore over. The stream of leaks continues today though, as a comprehensive list of specs have surfaced online.</p>
<p>The details come via reliable journalist Roland Quandt of WinFuture, and it corroborates some of the rumored specs we previously heard about the series.</p>
<p>For one, Quandt’s report also mentions that the vanilla OnePlus 8 will offer a 6.55-inch FHD+ OLED screen (2,400 x 1,080) with a 90Hz refresh rate. Meanwhile, the OnePlus 8 Pro is said to deliver a 6.78-inch OLED panel (3,168 x 1,440) with a 120Hz refresh rate. The company has previously confirmed that it’s using an MEMC chip to boost the frame-rate of content, and WinFuture suggests that this could be limited to the Pro variant only.</p>
<p>The report also mentions IP68 water and dust resistance for the Pro model, with no mention of any IP rating for the standard OnePlus 8. This seems to follow previous rumors as well.</p>
<p>A ton of camera details</p>
<p>WinFuture.de</p>
<p>Quandt says the OnePlus 8 Pro camera setup consists of a 48MP IMX689 main camera, a 48MP IMX586 ultra-wide shooter, a telephoto zoom camera (3x hybrid zoom), and a color filter camera. This mostly echoes earlier reports as well, but we also get loads more information on specific camera features.</p>
<p>OnePlus is apparently ditching 8K recording on the series (topping out at 4K/60fps), even though it’s supported by the Snapdragon 865 processor. Instead, the company is said to be focusing on improving 4K video by offering HDR (combining three 4K frames at a time), and improved 4K stabilization by combining EIS and OIS.</p>
<p>The Pro model is believed to support audio zoom functionality too due to its use of three microphones. This should allow you to zoom in on a subject and focus on the sound coming from them. We’ve previously seen this feature on the likes of HTC and LG devices, but we’d be glad to see it here too.</p>
<p>The color filter camera seems like an odd addition, and WinFuture says it delivers “unique style through artistic lighting effects and filters.” Hopefully there’s more to this sensor.</p>
<p>Leaks point to the OnePlus 8 Pro having the far superior camera specs on paper.</p>
<p>Other noteworthy camera-related details mentioned for the Pro model include a macro mode via the ultra-wide camera (as per previous devices), a flicker sensor as seen on other phones to prevent flicker in recorded videos, and a night mode once again. But we can likely expect the latter two features on the vanilla variant.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the standard OnePlus 8 is tipped to offer a 48MP IMX586 main camera, a 16MP ultra-wide sensor, and a 2MP macro camera. Don’t expect telephoto zoom, the brand-new IMX689 main camera, or a 48MP ultra-wide sensor, then.</p>
<p>The OnePlus 8 series is believed to also deliver a “cinema format” video recording option, a better Pro mode, and a pet-focused recording mode. Both phones are tipped to share the same 16MP selfie camera, albeit with slight aperture differences.</p>
<p>Other differences between OnePlus 8 phones?</p>
<p>OnePlus previously said that LPDDR5 RAM was coming to the series, but WinFuture asserts that only the Pro model will get the faster RAM standard. Meanwhile, LPDDR4X is tipped for the vanilla variant. Otherwise, both phones are said to get 128GB or 256GB of UFS 3.0 storage (non-expandable).</p>
<p>Editor&rsquo;s Pick Here are all the apps that are compatible with OnePlus 8’s frame-boosting chip CashKaro OnePlus previously confirmed back in January that an MEMC chip was coming to the OnePlus 8 series, boosting 30fps content to 120fps. Now, CEO Pete Lau has revealed the supported apps and content on Weibo, …</p>
<p>We’ve previously heard that the OnePlus 8 Pro will have a slightly bigger 4,510mAh battery with wireless charging and reverse wireless charging. Meanwhile, the standard OnePlus phone was said to offer a 4,300mAh pack with no wireless charging. The new report corroborates these claims, while adding that the standard model should hit 50% capacity in 22 minutes (a minute faster than the Pro’s apparent 23 minutes).</p>
<p>There’s no word on official pricing, but it’s claimed that the phones will be available a week after the reveal event. OnePlus previously said the phones won’t exceed the $1,000 mark, but we’re still expecting significantly more expensive pricing than previous devices.
