<p>日前才報導過因疫情而需要在家隔離 14 天的 Gal Gadot 受著網上影片的啟發，聯同 25 位同樣需要居家隔離的荷里活名人一同隔空演唱出一首《Imagine》，希望鼓勵全球的人為抗疫而努力。這本來是一番善意之舉，可是最後卻演變成一場謾罵，到底 Gal Gadot 做錯了甚麼？</p>

<p>Gal Gadot 聯同群星一人接一句的隔空合唱出 John Lennon 的經典曲目《Imagine》，他們都是需要留在家隔離 14 天的人士，因此不少都是以素顏現身，跟觀眾平常看到造型非常華麗的他們不同。雖然這本來是一番善意，而且充滿鼓勵性的舉動，可是 Twitter 和 Instagrsm 卻有不少用戶指 Gal Gadot 並沒有真正的為疫情帶來甚麼改變，就連《The New York Times》也批評指「這一連串名人空洞而笨拙的舉動是毫無意義。」的確 Gal Gadot 上載影片時並沒有表明她會否做出另一些舉動去支援抗疫，例如捐款或捐助物資等，但其實這都是她的一個小小心意，到底有沒有必要就這件事向她指罵呢？另外就是名人所做的每一個舉動又是否需要向公眾公開和交待呢？這些問題就留待大家自行決定了！</p>

<p>全球疫症肆虐，人人自危，特別是曾經外遊人士，都會自律的遵守家居自我隔離 14 天的規定。除了時尚圈外，就連電影業也受到疫情的影響，不少電影需要改期上映和延遲拍攝，其中原訂需要拍攝新電影的 Gal Gadot 就是其中一個要進行自我隔離的電影業界人士。當大家正在苦惱隔離日子該做甚麼的時候，Gal Gadot 忽發奇想聯合了 25 位荷里活巨星、名人給大家一個小驚喜！</p>
<p>Gal Gadot 於影片上表示自己受到一段意大利網絡瘋傳的影片所啟發，該影片是拍著一個人於露台吹奏《Imagine》一曲鼓勵身邊正在居家隔離的鄰舍，讓她想到號召一眾好友給大家拍一段充滿鼓勵性的影片。影片由 Gal Gadot 開始唱出《Imagine》這首經典歌曲，然後也剪輯了不同名人的版本，包括 Natalie Portman、Jamie Dornan、Sia、Jimmy Fallon、Mark Ruffalo、Amy Adams、Kaia Gerber 和 Cara Delevingne 等 25 位名人一同獻聲，最後回到 Gal Gadot 作結尾。</p>
<p>這段影片不用 4 小時就已經超過百萬人次觀看，不少人都指這個時候能看到自己喜歡的名人的隔空鼓勵都感到非常窩心。說到這段影片最多人討論的就是名人們的素顏居家造型，雖然少了平常那份華麗感，但每個都是人美心善的代表呢！

<h3 id="vogue-never-imagined-this">Vogue Never Imagined This</h3>

<p>On Thursday morning, when Vogue magazine revealed that its May cover star was Gal Gadot, the general reaction online seemed to be this: oops.</p>
<p>Before the coronavirus pandemic, the Israeli actress was perhaps best known for her role as Wonder Woman. But we live in a very different world now — one in which Gadot’s name and face are unfortunately tied to a train-wreck viral video in which she and a handful of other celebrities sing John Lennon’s “Imagine.” It was bad, and an easy target for people looking to displace all their pent-up frustrations. The Times likened Gadot’s opening performance to that of “a joyfully sadistic nurse about to administer a gruesome shot.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Vogue never imagined that the world would be turned upside down by a global pandemic. (Our own government didn’t, so we can hardly blame the magazine for not seeing this coming.) It also never imagined that its cover star would be the face of how not to deal with this crisis. A new introduction to Gadot’s profile, which reads almost like an apology, helps explain that magazines are planned months in advance, with most publications now scrambling to produce remotely. “This story, reported before COVID-19 began to take hold in the U.S., went to press as profound changes to daily life were being seen across the country,” it reads.</p>
<p>Also unfortunately for Vogue — and this one is on the magazine — its profiles tend to offer only the most glowing portraits of their subjects. The opening line to the Gal Gadot piece says it all: “Spending time with Gal Gadot is an exercise in nonchalance,” writes Jonathan Van Meter, who admits by the end of the first paragraph (after describing how carefree Gadot seems while cruising in her Tesla) that “it feels wrong” to call their encounter an interview. “It’s a hang, really,” he says. Oof.</p>
<p>It’s hard to get through an endorsement of celebrity nonchalance right now, and the timing is especially awkward, given that one of the main criticisms of the “Imagine” video was its tone-deafness (and not just the musical kind). As Vogue explained though, Gal Gadot, “like every one of us,” has been affected by COVID-19. Her children’s school closed, and her projects are on hold, including the June release of Wonder Woman 1984.</p>
<p>Sometime in mid-March, Vogue reached out to Gadot for an addendum. (Gadot shared the “Imagine” video on March 18.) “Obviously the circumstances are horrible and frightening, but we’re home and we’re trying to make the best of it — to enjoy the quality time,” she said. “It’s so surreal. I’ve never been through times like these. But I’m also full of hope for when it will be behind us.”</p>

<h3 id="jamie-dornan-defends-gal-gadots-cringeworthy-imagine-celebrity-viral-video">Jamie Dornan defends Gal Gadot&rsquo;s &lsquo;cringeworthy&rsquo; Imagine celebrity viral video</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/09/21/27017208-0-image-a-59_1586462872791.jpg" alt="img">
Jamie Dornan has defended Gal Gadot&rsquo;s &lsquo;cringeworthy&rsquo; Imagine video that featured several celebrities singing the John Lennon hit to lift spirits during the coronavirus lockdown.</p>
<p>The Wonder Woman actress, 34, recruited A-list stars including Jamie, Will Ferrell, Mark Ruffalo, Kristen Wiig and Amy Adams to take part in the video which was deemed out of touch by social media users.</p>
<p>Speaking on the Tea With Me podcast, Jamie, 37, admitted he was roped into the video by his friend and Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar co-star Kristen Wiig but insisted Gal was &lsquo;trying to do a good thing&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Speaking out: Jamie Dornan, 37, has defended Gal Gadot&rsquo;s Imagine video that featured several celebrities singing the John Lennon hit and was widely deemed out of touch</p>
<p>He said: &lsquo;Kristen and I did a movie together last summer that’s meant to be coming out on July 31 but who knows what will happen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We got on brilliantly. I would do anything for her - that’s how highly I think of her. I was the biggest fan of her before anyway.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not being on social media, I wasn’t aware of the reaction – but was made aware by mates,&rsquo; he added.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Kristen texted, &ldquo;Gal and I are trying to organise this thing to lift spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Star-studded: Gal recruited several A-list stars to take part in the video which was widely criticised as the celebrities were all isolating in their luxurious homes</p>
<p>Pals: Jamie admitted he was roped into the video by his friend and Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar co-star Kristen Wiig</p>
<p>Jamie agreed to do the video and admitted he received a text message from Kristen several days after its release apologising for getting him involved.</p>
<p>He said: &lsquo;So I was like: &ldquo;Of course I’ll do it&rdquo;. Then she texted days later saying, &ldquo;Sorry&rdquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Jamie filmed his segment from his toilet &lsquo;to make it normal&rsquo; and insisted Gal was &lsquo;trying to do a good thing&rsquo;, adding: &lsquo;I just got dragged along with it&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The video was an attempt to lift people&rsquo;s spirits during the coronavirus lockdowns taking place in several countries around the world.</p>
<p>Out of touch: People were not impressed with the video, claiming they didn&rsquo;t want to see wealthy A-list stars isolating in their lavish homes</p>
<p>However, social media users quickly condemned the video after its release, saying the stars were all isolating in luxury.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know how millionaires singing about &ldquo;no possessions&rdquo; from their mansions is supposed to ease my anxiety,&rsquo; one user wrote.</p>
<p>Asking the stars to put their money where their mouths are, someone else shared: &lsquo;Cheesy and embarrassing, until they donate money I [couldn&rsquo;t] care less about this video.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just seen the celeb Imagine video and now coronavirus no longer scares me,&rsquo; joked another.</p>
<p>A-list: Will Ferrell and Mark Ruffalo were among the stars who appeared in the video</p>
<p>&lsquo;Me seeing some my my face celebrities singing in the Gal Gadot video,&rsquo; one person tweeted with a reaction image of two people grimacing.</p>
<p>Things all started with good intentions, as Wonder Woman actress Gadot explained in the original video.</p>
<p>She introduced the project saying: &lsquo;Hey guys. Day six in self-quarantine. And I&rsquo;ve got to say that these past few days got me feeling a bit philosophical.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know, this virus has affected the entire world, everyone &ndash; doesn&rsquo;t matter who you are, where you are from, we are all in this together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Pals: Kaia Gerber (centre) and Cara Delevingne (right) appeared together in Gal&rsquo;s videoc</p>
<p>The Israeli starlet went on to say she was inspired by a viral video of an Italian man playing trumpet for his neighborhood as the country continues its lockdown.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There was something so powerful and pure about this video,&rsquo; Gal said before kicking off the song.</p>
<p>Things persists with a new celebrity delivering each line including Eddie Benjamin, Jimmy Fallon, and Sia.</p>
<p>Gadot even enlisted the original Wonder Woman herself, Lynda Carter, along with Leslie Odom Jr., Pedro Pascal, Chris O&rsquo;Dowd and Dawn O&rsquo;Porter.</p>
<p>Song: Maya Rudolph and Natalie Portman were also among the stars who appeared</p>
<p>Although he has not seen any of the online criticism himself, Jamie said he could understand why some people were unimpressed with the video.</p>
<p>He said: &lsquo;I’ll tell you what the problem was. I literally did mine in the toilet of my house. Quite clearly, some people had escaped to their second home.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There’s too much acreage in the background, too many beautiful trees swaying in the background, clearly in front of an ocean, that sort of craic. I was quite aware of that whenever I was doing it, to make it normal.&rsquo;
