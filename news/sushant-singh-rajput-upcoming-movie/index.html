<h3 id="from-shoba-to-sushant-singh-rajput-a-look-at-suicides-in-indian-cinema">&ldquo;From Shoba to Sushant Singh Rajput: A look at suicides in Indian cinema&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.manoramaonline.com/content/dam/mm/en/entertainment/entertainment-news/images/2020/6/15/sushant-soba-silk-smitha-suicide.jpg" alt="img">
The curse of suicide has haunted the showbiz since time immemorial with the likes of iconic actor-director Guru Dutt, South star Shoba, Silk Smitha, actor Jiah Khan and now Bollywood star Sushant Singh Rajput giving up on life in the Indian film industry known for being harsh and demanding of its stars.</p>
<p>Known for films like &ldquo;Kai Po Che!&quot;, &ldquo;MS Dhoni: The Untold Story&rdquo;, &ldquo;Chhichhore&rdquo;, Rajput was found hanging at his Bandra home, the police said on Sunday. He was 34.</p>

<p>Rajput&rsquo;s last screen appearance was Nitesh Tiwari&rsquo;s 2019 film Chhichhore. And his last social media post, dedicated to his late mother who died in 2002 when he was a young teen, was on June 3, a foretelling perhaps on what to come.</p>
<p>Rajput&rsquo;s sudden death comes days after his former manager, 28-year-old Disha Salian, ended her life by jumping from a high rise building on June 9.</p>
<p>Guru Dutt, known for black-and-white classics like &ldquo;Kaagaz Ke Phool&rdquo;, &ldquo;Baazi&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Pyaasa&rdquo;, was found dead on October 10, 1964 in his bed in his rented apartment at Pedder Road in erstwhile Bombay. He was 39. The filmmaker, whose real name was Vasanth Kumar Shivashankar Padukone, was said to have been mixing alcohol and sleeping pills.</p>
<p>Dutt&rsquo;s death may have been suicide or just an accidental overdose. His son, Arun Dutt, considered the death to be an accident.</p>
<p>Guru Dutt</p>
<p>South star Mahalakshmi Menon, best known by her stagename Shoba committed suicide at the age of 17. She got herself a National Award for Best Actress for the film Pasi and on May 1, 1980, she was found to have killed herself in her house in Chennai, then Madras. The manner of Shoba’s death, however, still remains cloaked in mystery.</p>
<p>Four years after Shoba died, her mother Prema who was also an actress too killed herself. KG George&rsquo;s 1983 film Lekhayude Maranam – Oru Flashback is said to be loosely based on her life.</p>
<p>Actor Vijaylakshmi, who reached the iconic status of a sex symbol in Tamil cinema during her time, as Silk Smitha died at the age of 33 as the result of a suspected suicide in 1996. She appeared in over 200 films, including &ldquo;Vandichakkaram&rdquo;, &ldquo;Moondru Mugam&rdquo;, a most sought after actor at a time was said to be neck deep in controversies.</p>
<p>Silk Smitha</p>
<p>She was immortalised on screen in the 2011 film &ldquo;The Dirty Picture&rdquo;, starring Vidya Balan as Silk. The Milan Luthria-directed film, which showed the highs and lows of the dancing star, was inspired by the actor&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Former Miss India and video jockey Nafisa Joseph was found hanging at her residence in Versova in 2004 at the age of 25.</p>
<p>Joseph, who won the Miss India title in 1997, had worked as a model and had been involved in activities related to animal rights.</p>
<p>In 2006, model-turned television actor Kuljeet Randhawa, known for starring in high-school drama &ldquo;Hip Hip Hurray!&quot;, suspense serial &ldquo;Kohinoor&rdquo; and crime thriller drama &ldquo;Special Squad&rdquo;, allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself in her single room apartment in suburban Juhu. She was 25.</p>
<p>Kunal Singh, best known for starring opposite actor Sonali Bendre in the 1999 Tamil romance film &ldquo;Kadhalar Dhinam&rdquo;, was found hanging from the ceiling fan in his Mumbai apartment in 2008. He was 30.</p>
<p>Jiah Khan</p>
<p>British-American actor Jiah Khan, best known for films like &ldquo;Nishabd&rdquo; with megastar Amitabh Bachchan and &ldquo;Ghajini&rdquo; with Aamir Khan, was found hanging at her Mumbai residence on June 3, 2013 by her mother Rabiya Khan. Khan was 25.</p>
<p>It was deemed a suicide and reconfirmed as a suicide in 2016 following an extensive investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and a hearing at the Bombay High Court.</p>
<p>Khan&rsquo;s mother blamed her boyfriend, actor Sooraj Pancholi, for her death. He was charged with abetting Khan&rsquo;s suicide. The case has not yet been settled.</p>
<p>Last year, actor Kushal Punjabi, who appeared in films such as &ldquo;Kaal&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lakshya&rdquo; as well as the reality show &ldquo;Fear Factor&rdquo;, was found hanging in his Bandra apartment. He was 42.</p>
<p>Punjabi, whose body was found by his parents in the wee hours of December 27, left behind a suicide note in which he said nobody should be held responsible for his death.

<p>Actor Arjun Kapoor was all heart and sincerity as he posted his last interaction with Sushant Singh Rajput after the release of latter’s film, Kedarnath. Arjun wrote with the picture of their interaction: “18 months ago&hellip; My last msg to him was when he posted about his mom a week after the release of Kedarnath. He was missing her I assume while the movie was being celebrated.”</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput died by suicide on Sunday. He was 34.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know him well enough though our paths crossed at yrf, events &amp; screenings every now &amp; then. I can’t say I understood what made him make this choice. I can say I felt the pain he did about losing his bearings &amp; feeling that void of his mother. I hope ur in a better &amp; happier space my friend. I hope u have found ur peace. We will all wonder &amp; try &amp; make sense of what happened today. I just hope &amp; pray that when the circus settles down we as a society in due course realise ur choice wasn’t driven by one singular moment or thing but a culmination of so much that defines a human being not just by the profession u were in. Rest my dear brother Sushant you are now I hope at peace.”</p>
<p>The sincerity in the interaction comes through strongly as Arjun says ‘she’s watching n is proud man” and how they give solace to each other as Arjun says “Hang in there&hellip; one day at a time..” and Sushant acknowledges with a simple “yes’ . At one point, Sushant had responded: “I love you brother, I know you understand.”</p>
<p>Also read: Let Sushant Singh Rajput go in peace, Sonu Sood requests media; Anushka Sharma and Vikrant Massey call for sensitive coverage</p>
<p>There has been an outpouring of grief at the death of Sushant from across different fields with film stars, directors, politicians and cricketers expressing their grief.</p>
<p>Sushant was found hanging in his Bandra apartment on Sunday. Sushant, who made the storybook transition from a Patna boy to television and then the starry lights of the Hindi film industry, was the youngest of five siblings and is survived by his father and four sisters.</p>

<p>In Photos: From Maanav in Pavitra Rishta to Annirudh in Chhichhore, roles that defined Sushant Singh Rajput 1 12 Tracing Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s life in films Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s tryst with the camera began with a chance sighting. Ekta Kapoor&rsquo;s casting team spotted him in a play by Nadira Babbar&rsquo;s theatre company and invited him to audition for a show. It set the ball rolling on the then-aspiring hero&rsquo;s career. A look: Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil (2008) Sushant made his television debut as Preet Juneja on this show. The character was killed early on, but was brought back as a spirit for the series finale, owing to his popularity. Pavitra Rishta (2009) The next year, he landed the lead role of Manav Deshmukh in the hit show, widely considered to be his breakout role and a stepping stone to films. While working on this Ekta Kapoor production, he also met his future girlfriend, Ankita Lokhande, who played the female lead. Kai Po Che! (2013) After participating in two dance-based reality shows— Zara Nachke Dikha 2 and Jhalak Dikhhla Ja 4—Sushant auditioned for this Abhishek Kapoor directorial, and bagged one of the three lead roles alongside Rajkummar Rao and Amit Sadh. His portrayal of former district-level cricketer Ishaan Bhatt, who falls prey to politics in the selection process, in the critical and commercial success earned him raves. Shuddh Desi Romance (2013) Sushant followed it up with this Maneesh Sharma-directed Parineeti Chopra and Vaani Kapoor co-starrer. The romance comedy-drama was set in Jaipur and revolved around youngsters’ take on love and live-in relationships. PK (2014) In Rajkumar Hirani’s satirical comedy-drama led by Aamir Khan and Anushka Sharma, Sushant had a brief yet notable role. Detective Byomkesh Bakshy (2015) Dibakar Banerjee’s mystery thriller featured the actor in the titular role, a character created by Bengali writer Sharanindu Bandopadhyay. Set in the Kolkata of the 1940s, the film was reportedly to get a sequel with Sushant reprising his role. MS Dhoni: The Untold Story (2016) Neeraj Pandey’s biographical drama that traces the journey of the eponymous former Indian skipper-wicket keeper saw Sushant take on another titular role. The film, which also featured Kiara Advani and Disha Patani, secured for Sushant his first Filmfare Best Actor nomination the following year. Raabta (2017) In Dinesh Vijan’s directorial debut, a reincarnation-themed romance actioner, Sushant was paired opposite Kriti Sanon and the duo played star-crossed lovers. The film featured Jim Sarbh, Rajkumar Yadav and Varun Dharma in supporting roles. Kedarnath (2018) The actor reunited with Abhishek ‘Gattu’ Kapoor to headline Sara Ali Khan’s launch vehicle. The inter-faith love story was set against the backdrop of the pilgrim site and revolved around a Muslim boy who falls in love with a rich Brahmin girl. Sonchiriya (2019) Co-written and directed by Abhishek Chaubey, the film is set in the Chambal ravines of 1975 and tells the story of a group of dacoits. It also featured Manoj Bajpayee, Bhumi Pednekar, Ranvir Shorey and Ashutosh Rana. Chhichhore (2019) Sushant followed it up with one of the biggest successes of his career with this Nitesh Tiwari-directed campus comedy-drama. The film won five Filmfare nods, including Best Film and Best Director. It was also Sushant’s last theatrical release.</p>
<p>A disarming smile when he would get smacked in the face by the hard, leather ball. An actor who had a parallel world of books, which seemed to give him immense peace of mind. And if more release was needed, he would turn to his cars. He had quite a few of them — the Maserati Quattroporte was his favourite. That’s the Sushant I knew, the one whose cricketing skills I had to sharpen for the movie, ‘MS Dhoni: The Untold Story’.Before I started preparing him for the role of Dhoni — we trained together for nine months — I had warned him that discipline would be non-negotiable. Discipline is an overworked word in sport, but without Sushant’s unwavering focus, he couldn’t have done justice to Dhoni’s character.I was clear that he would have to report on time for practice and carry his own kit. I had him agree to another condition — he would have no spot boys and security guards at nets.We would practise at the Chandrakant Pandit Coaching Clinic in, daily from 7 to 9 am.Facing the leather ball was never going to be easy for someone who had been brought up on tennis-ball. Training him in wicketkeeping was more challenging. Even someone as prodigiously talented as Sachin Tendulkar might not be comfortable if abruptly asked to do the job behind the stumps.So we eased him into wicketkeeping drills. First, we made him do basic catching drills with the tennis ball before making him wear the keeper’s pads and polish the art of neat collections.He would be hit frequently on the fingers, chest, face and legs, but not once did he whine.If you watched the movie, he was slimmer as young Dhoni and had to look heavier later. Sushant managed to achieve both. He had to sweat buckets to raise his fitness levels. Everybody knows Dhoni has naturally-built strong thighs. To get Sushant’s legs to that level, we engaged Rajesh Sawant, the then U-19 fitness trainer who passed away three years ago.I was witness to Sushant’s complete transformation as a cricketer. Like we did with his wicketkeeping, we tried making him comfortable with the bat. We started giving him throwdowns before unleashing fast bowlers at him.The batting drills became progressively tougher. We made him bat on uncovered wickets with unpredictable bounce. Once a delivery cut through the grill of his visor leaving him with a bloodied nose.Each day, he would joyously give me a count of his bruises, but he never stopped training.It took him roughly three months of rigorous practice — sometimes against the bowling machine — to execute the helicopter shot, considered the toughest in the sport. It was surprising, for I hadn’t seen many cricketers look comfortable playing it. I remember a shoot in Jamshedpur where he was demonstrating the helicopter shot – it was as though he had been practising it all his life.Once we were training at’s Bandra-Kurla Complex indoor facility. Sachin had accompanied his son Arjun for a net session. Sushant was batting at the adjacent net. Sachin was curious to know who this man was. Sachin was stunned when he learned he was Sushant. “He’s batting like an accomplished batsman,” he beamed., the former India pacer who was also around, told me: “Man, you’ve turned him into a cricketer.” I can’t express in words how nice I felt that day.As his stint with me was coming to an end, I could see another makeover in him. The way Sushant would communicate with people, carry his kit, wear his pads and gloves…he had gotten into the skin of Dhoni’s character. The actor had become a cricketer.I may have worked on fine details like changing his stance and his grip, but in nine months Sushant had become Dhoni in flesh. Spending considerable amount of time with Dhoni had its wondrous effects too.I can’t believe such a warm person — that’s the Sushant that will stay with me — has left us so abruptly. To say I’m shocked is not the word.

<p>Mumbai: Following ‘Chhichhore’ actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s alleged suicide at his Bandra home in Mumbai, former Union Minister and Congress leader Milind Deora on Sunday opened up about having suicidal thoughts. Deora also mentioned five &ldquo;effective&rdquo; tools to deal with depression.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old actor’s alleged suicide has sent shockwaves rippling through the Hindi film industry.</p>
<p>Taking to Twitter, Deora shared &ldquo;effective coping tools&rdquo; while saying that “his own experience with suicidal thoughts, first as a teen &amp; even as an MP, taught me to live with the blues.”</p>
<p>Here are the five “coping tools” that he shared for people struggling with depression:</p>
<p>Reach out to your family, friends, colleagues and even acquaintances. You are more loved than you know. Overcome the stigma of mental health and seeking counselling. Depression transcends age, gender, economic strata or success. We are in a constant struggle with our inner demons. Never give in to them. Life is beautiful. Do not get caught up in the rate race. Choose music, food, travel, reading, your work, and loved ones. Do what makes you happy. Choose life. Most importantly, love yourself for who you are.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s death</p>
<p>In a shocking development, Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput had on Sunday alleged committed suicide at his Bandra residence in Mumbai.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has committed suicide. Mumbai Police is investigating. The police have not found any (suicide) note yet,&rdquo; Mumbai Police Spokesperson and Deputy Commissioner of Police Pranay Ashok had said.</p>
<p>One of his domestic helps had found the actor hanging by a bedsheet at his home.</p>
<p>Rajput hailed from Bihar. He rose to fame for his work in TV serials like &lsquo;Pavitra Rishta&rsquo;, Bollywood films &lsquo;Kai Po Chhe&rsquo;, &lsquo;M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story&rsquo;, &lsquo;Shuddh Desi Romance&rsquo;, &lsquo;Kedarnath&rsquo; and &lsquo;Chhichore&rsquo;, among others.</p>

Veteran Marathi actress Usha Nadkarni played late actor Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s mother in his debut TV show &ldquo;Pavitra Rishta&rdquo;. The show made Sushant a household name and an overnight star.</p>
<p>Usha said, &ldquo;Sushant was a quiet boy. We had worked together for almost two and a half years on the show ‘Pavitra Rishta&rsquo;. It was a good experience playing the role of his ‘aai&rsquo; ( mother).</p>
<p>When my hairdresser contacted me in the morning and shared the news of Sushant&rsquo;s demise, I could not believe it. I thought it was a hoax. My immediate reaction was Sushant aatmahatya kashi karu shakto (why would Sushant commit suicide)? But then, the news was all over and it sadly turned out to be true.</p>
<p>My whole body started shaking as read the news of his death. I just had tears rolling down my eyes. I was numb for a moment. May his soul Rest in peace.</p>
<p>I was not in touch with Sushant after he left the show. He then made foray into films and became a big and successful person. His life was different and I never tried to bother him by contacting him. He was a shy, quiet and calm person. He used to quietly sit on the sets and would always go out of his way to make others comfortable.</p>
<p>Apne kaam mein kaam rakhne wala ladka tha (he used to mind his business). He was a good boy. I will always remember him.&rdquo;</p>
