The Scottish government’s support for vulnerable families struggling to access food due to Covid-19 has been welcomed by MSP Maree Todd.</p>
<p>Ms Todd, who represents the Highlands and Islands region, said the food funding was important to help during this “unprecedented crisis”.</p>
<p>Shetland Islands Council has been allocated £104,000 from the £30 million Food Fund to support those struggling.</p>
<p>The funding will support those most in need including families with children who are eligible for free school meals, older people, those with long-term health conditions and pregnant women.</p>
<p>Councils will have the flexibility to use this additional resource in ways that best meet emerging local needs and circumstances, working with community groups and businesses to support home delivery, provide financial help and meet dietary requirements.</p>
<p>Ms Todd said: “Coronavirus has brought enormous disruption to all of our lives, and some people will be concerned about accessing food.</p>
<p>“This investment will help those in Shetland at most risk, such as older people and children eligible for free school meals, to access food through this unprecedented crisis.</p>
<p>“Free school meals are vital for families across Shetland and are an important way of ensuring children receive the nutritious food they need. That is why it is so important that support continues while schools remain closed.</p>
<p>“This is just one part of the support the Scottish government is providing to individuals and businesses to protect jobs and incomes.”

<h3 id="covid-19-latest--majority-in-shetland-have-made-a-full-recovery">Covid-19 latest – majority in Shetland have made a full recovery</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.shetnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/200311-Coronavirus_latest_post.jpg" alt="img">
ANOTHER person has tested positive for coronavirus in Shetland, bringing the isles’ total to 42.</p>
<p>There have also been four positive tests in Orkney and the Western Isles. The number of coronavirus deaths throughout Scotland jumped to 296 with 4,229 people testing positive, it was announced at 2pm.</p>
<p>NHS Shetland has meanwhile said that the majority of people in the isles who have tested positive for Covid-19 have made a full recovery, but cannot give specific numbers for “confidentiality issues”.</p>
<p>3 of 9 Adverts</p>
<p>NHS Shetland chief executive Michael Dickson said that the “Covid-19 situation is still developing in Shetland.”</p>
<p>He added: “We are doing everything we can to prepare but only time will tell what happens. We have a team of people working in their respective disciplines doing everything they can to ensure we are in the best position we can be to manage any eventuality.”</p>

<p>The health chief added that it would be wrong to apply “national modelling” to a place the size of Shetland to estimate the number of people actually infected with Covid-19.</p>
<p>4 of 9 Adverts</p>
<p>On Monday it had been suggested that more than 300,000 people in Scotland could be affected by the virus.</p>
<p>He said: “Shetland is a unique place and the cases we have identified to date occurred far earlier than other locations such as Orkney.</p>
<p>“The other issue is considering rates such as the per 100,000, based on that measure Shetland looks like an extreme outlier, however this figure isn’t weighted to take into consideration the small population of Shetland.</p>
<p>Dickson confirmed there were no cases of Covid-19 at the Gilbert Bain Hospital “but this could change at any time”. The hospital is set up with a five-patient respiratory care unit.</p>
<p>5 of 9 Adverts</p>
<p>The unit does not replace the need to fly patients south for intensive care, he said, and two patients have been flown south for intensive care.</p>
<p>Dickson added that NHS Shetland could also not confirm the number of Covid-19 patients in care homes owing to the low numbers involved, but stressed the need for people not to visit their loved ones unless “absolutely necessary.”</p>
<p>He said that there were a “host of protocols in place including isolating patients, the use of PPE and stopping all but essential visits into the care home.” This is being done in conjunction with the SIC’s social care services which manage care homes in Shetland.</p>
<p>Dickson emphasised that anyone who suspects they have Covid-19, or has any respiratory symptoms, must not come to the Gilbert Bain Hospital.</p>
<p>Instead, they must check for more information on NHS Inform and, if they remain unwell, call NHS 24 on 111. In the case of any medical emergency people should continue to call 999.</p>
<p>“Within the hospital anyone admitted with suspected Covid-19 is kept isolated and strict infection control protocols followed,” he added. The Ronas Ward has been established as a dedicated area, as and when required.</p>
<p>Dickson said: “Pathways for Covid-19 patients have been mapped so that the risk of coming into contact with any other patient or person in the hospital is kept to an absolute minimum.”

<h3 id="single-death-in-isles-attributed-to-coronavirus">Single death in isles attributed to coronavirus</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.shetnews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/200311-Coronavirus.jpg" alt="img">
NEWLY released statistics from the National Records of Scotland show there has been one death attributed to coronavirus in Shetland up to 5 April.</p>
<p>The death was recorded in the week beginning 30 March. Only Orkney and the Western Isles health board areas have so far had no deaths attributed to coronavirus.</p>
<p>3 of 9 Adverts</p>
<p>It is believed that the death of at least one further person in Shetland can be associated to coronavirus, with one close relative urging people to stick to the rules outlined by health authorities to “avoid the pain we are feeling just now.”</p>
<p>The NRS has started releasing numbers of deaths from coronavirus including those contained on death certificates that mention coronavirus.</p>
<p>By 5 April, 354 deaths had been registered in Scotland where Covid-19 was mentioned in the death certificate.</p>
<p>Between 30 March and 5 April, 282 deaths relating to Covid-19 were registered. There were 62 in the previous week, 23 to 29 March, and 10 in the week before, 16 to 22 March.</p>
<p>4 of 9 Adverts</p>
<p>Earlier figures released by the government as part of its daily coronavirus update have only been for people who tested positive for the virus and subsequently died.</p>
<p>As of yesterday the total deaths based on tested patients was 296.</p>
<p>Asked about deaths from Covid-19 on Tuesday, NHS Shetland chief executive Michael Dickson said: “At the current time deaths due to Covid-19 are reported at a national level and are not broken down to a health board level.</p>
<p>“Unless this reporting arrangement changes, and to maintain patient confidentiality, we will not be commenting on this issue.”</p>
<p>Jamie Halcro Johnston. Jamie Halcro Johnston.</p>
<p>Highlands and Islands Conservative MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston said a short while ago: “As a more accurate picture of the number of deaths in the community from Covid-19 has finally been provided, it is absolutely vital that everything is done to protect residents of our care facilities, and those receiving care in the community, from this horrific and indiscriminate virus.</p>
<p>5 of 9 Adverts</p>
<p>“That means clear and consistent guidance must be available, as well as the PPE and other equipment needed to protect both those being cared for and the people who care for them.</p>
<p>“And it also means better access to testing which, at the moment, appears to be a postcode lottery across Scotland, with each NHS board given the flexibility to decide who and when it tests.</p>
<p>“Those who work in our care sector are, like our NHS staff, at the very front line of efforts to protect the most vulnerable in our society and already do so in the most challenging of circumstances.”</p>
<p>The elderly are being disproportionately hit by the virus with people aged 75 or older accounting for 60 per cent of deaths.</p>
<p>The official advice in order to protect yourself and others is to stay at home; only go outside for essential food, health and work reasons; stay two metres (six feet) away from other people; wash your hands regularly and wash your hands thoroughly as soon as you get home.</p>
<p>The most common symptoms of Covid-19 are a new continuous cough and/or a fever or high temperature (37.8C or greater).</p>
