The Church of Scientology could be hit hard as the coronavirus sweeps the globe, with several whistleblowers claiming the religion&rsquo;s bases around the world are not equipped to handle the pandemic.</p>
<p>Scientology&rsquo;s chairman of the board, David Miscavige, branded the coronavirus crisis &ldquo;hysteria&rdquo; and &ldquo;planetary bull bait&rdquo; in a missive obtained by Daily Mail. Miscavige also vowed to create a safe environment for business to go as usual, per the British newspaper.</p>
<p>That said, the pandemic appears to pose a real threat to the church founded by L. Ron Hubbard, especially with rumors of dwindling revenues that usually come from members who flock to US bases from across the globe. In an extensive report, Daily Mail broke down the Scientology headquarters that are threatened by the virus and what its VIPs Tom Cruise, John Travolta, Kirstie Alley, etc. are doing to deal with the crisis.</p>

<p>One of the church&rsquo;s most high profile locations, per the report, is the Twin Peaks base near Lake Arrowhead, California.</p>
<p>Known as the secretive Church of Spiritual Technology HQ, the property is nestled deep in the San Bernadino Mountains east of Los Angeles. It is almost the perfect place to hide out should the coronavirus manage to topple human civilization. The mysterious base is reportedly built to withstand a nuclear holocaust to the exact specifications outlined by David Miscavige. What&rsquo;s more? It is purportedly home to special bunkers where Hollywood titans Tom Cruise and John Travolta can escape if things take an apocalyptic turn.</p>
<p>According to the report, the $18-million base is so secure that many experts believe Miscavige&rsquo;s wife Shelley has been living there ever since she was allegedly exiled by her husband in 2005.</p>
<p>Another high-profile Scientology base is located in the United Kingdom, where L. Ron Hubbard&rsquo;s theory of the mind – known as Dianetics – attracted a following from the very start. In fact, the movement&rsquo;s global headquarters was located at Saint Hill Manor in East Grinstead, Sussex, until 1966.</p>
<p>Known as the manor house, the magnificent property dates back to 1733 and is set in a 100-acre country estate which includes Hubbard&rsquo;s own home and a castle built by Scientologists. Cruise, who put his own East Grinstead mansion on the market in 2016, was reportedly due to use the base as his home after the sale. Bella, Cruise&rsquo;s daughter, was heavily involved in promoting the church&rsquo;s London Org &ndash; whose headquarters are located near the city&rsquo;s famous St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral. However, the report notes that Tom and Bella would be able to self-isolate better in the church&rsquo;s countryside castle considering the rise of coronavirus cases in the British capital.</p>

<p>Having said that, Tom Cruise is the poster boy of Scientology, with some reports claiming he&rsquo;s regarded as a deity in the religion. The superstar joined the church in 1990 through Mimi Rogers, his first wife, and went on to become best friends with the church&rsquo;s current leader David Miscavige.</p>
<p>Former Scientologist Karen Pressley was asked about the Hollywood superstar&rsquo;s dedication to the church. &ldquo;Tom Cruise is a personal friend of David Miscavige so there is an allegiance there and a loyalty that will probably never be broken,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>According to the report, Cruise has brought up Connor and Bella (whom he adopted alongside second wife Nicole Kidman) as Scientologists.</p>

<h3 id="john-travolta-dancing-with-diana-was-one-of-the-highlights-of-my-life">John Travolta: “Dancing with Diana was one of the highlights of my life”</h3>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/royalcentral.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/John_Travolta_and_Princess_Diana.jpg?fit=750%2C504&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
Actor John Travolta has revealed that his favourite moment of the 1980s was when he danced with Princess Diana at the White House.</p>
<p>Speaking to Good Morning America back in 2016, Mr Travolta reflected on his moment with the Princess of Wales at a gala in 1985.</p>
<p>“That was one of the highlights of my life,” he told the interviewer. “So that’s probably the best moment of the eighties.”</p>
<p>The Prince and Princess of Wales were on a visit to the United States in November 1985 when they attended a White House Gala on 11 November, during the presidency of Ronald Reagan. First Lady Nancy Reagan urged Travolta to dance with Diana, stating that it was her wish to do so.</p>
<p>Mr Travolta was invited to the event, and danced with Diana to the music of one of his iconic films, Saturday Night Fever.</p>
<p>Mr Travolta has reflected on the dance on a number of occasions.</p>
<p>In 2007, he was promoting the movie musical Hairspray, and told a reporter that it was Diana’s request to dance with him.</p>
<p>“At midnight, I had to tap her on her shoulder, and I had to say, ‘Would you care to dance?’ She turned around and dipped her head in that Lady Diana way and we were off for 15 minutes dancing.”</p>
<p>Images of the pair twirling around the dance floor became iconic, and were widely circulated around the globe.</p>
<p>“I’m so honoured that I was able to experience it, and I know for a fact that it was a highlight of being in the United States; it was her favourite moment. So I feel I made her life better; she made my life better; and I’m very sorry that she’s not here,” he continued.</p>
<p>Diana wore a midnight blue velvet evening gown with off-the-shoulder sleeves designed by British designer Victor Edelstein. It immediately became one of her most famous dresses and was simply called the Travolta Dress. She wore it several times after the White House Gala, including when she sat for her last official portrait in 1997.</p>
<p>A few months before her death in 1997, the dress was auctioned off for charity for £100,000 by a Floridian businesswoman named Maureen Dunkel. It was the most expensive dress sold at the auction.
