<p>When Instagram revealed that it was testing pulling “likes” from public view, worry began to ripple through the professional influencer community. Now, according to Instagram, at least some relief may be on the way.</p>
<p>As part of the company’s latest announcements on new tools and updates on Wednesday, the Facebook-owned social network doubled down on its commitment to help branded content creators — and that includes giving them powers to share their private like counts with potential partners, along with other metrics.</p>
<p>In fact, the company considers the feature an important area of investment, Instagram’s Susan Buckner Rose, director of product marketing, told WWD.</p>
<p>“We know that like counts and engagement metrics are important for creators, especially in the spirit of branded content,” she explained. Buckner Rose acknowledged that brands often use likes to help determine who to partner with, as evidence of how engaged a given influencer’s audience is. “We’re going to build an experience and a tool within the Instagram app to give creators the option to share those engagement metrics with partners that they want to work with.”</p>
<p>Through the platform’s tests to remove public likes, it preserved the numbers for private viewing, accessible by the account holder only. As it was, that change could undercut numerous fashion, beauty and other businesses on the platform. Creators typically need to prove engagement to agencies that can broker deals with brands.</p>
<p>View Gallery Related Natasha Zinko x Duo Ltd Spring 2021</p>
<p>But with the tool, anyone would be able to connect with brands directly and share numbers — no agencies or intermediaries required, the company said.</p>
<p>The roll-out would begin when Instagram officially snuffs out public likes, and that timeline’s not clear. Tests began earlier this year to remove public like counts in some markets and then went global on Nov. 14.</p>
<p>As for why Instagram wanted to ax public likes to begin with, Buckner Rose said, “The goal of that test is to make sure that we help people find their authentic voices on Instagram, express themselves in a way that they’re comfortable with and to focus more on the message that they want to get out to their community, and less on competition and how people are responding to that message.”</p>
<p>She wouldn’t divulge any data or results from the test but simply said the team is “really excited” about it. So a full launch doesn’t look like a matter of “if,” but “when.”</p>
<p>Instagram also announced other changes that, in total, look like the network is lining up more with its parent, Facebook.</p>
<p>Starting Wednesday, the platform will begin testing integration into Facebook’s Brand Collabs Manager.</p>
<p>The tool is akin to a matchmaking service for brands and influencers. Companies can discover new creators based on past partners, people who like the brand’s page and other factors.</p>
<p>Influencers get to showcase content and audience details in the tool, which could be beneficial for creators who have followings on both platforms. The test starts with some 40 U.S. Instagram creators.</p>
<p>To hear Buckner Rose tell it, Instagram wanted to further connect brands and creators, and Facebook had already been testing Brand Collabs Manager for more than a year. So it made sense to bring them together. Now, Instagram can cast these moves as its efforts to democratize branded content.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure we’re doing more to protect our community and promote transparency across the Facebook family when it comes to branded content,” Buckner Rose said.</p>
<p>Some pundits will undoubtedly see this as Facebook’s latest attempt to pull its various business units further into its fold. And the theme continues with Instagram’s latest policy change to zero in on restricted goods and services.</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram have already nixed advertisements for things such as guns and e-cigarettes. Now they’re closing gaps that allowed influencers’ branded content to tout them and other risky items — like alcohol for, say, U.S. consumers under 21, or sketchy weight loss products.</p>
<p>The companies also revealed on Monday that Instagram will be using Facebook’s tech to battle fake news. Instagram will label images that Facebook’s image recognition software tags as false or misleading, and then apply links to credible sources beside them, strip off the hashtags and relocate them from the Explore page.

<p>Bayern Munich’s Bundesliga-clinching Tuesday might’ve cast a pall over its two closest competitors.</p>
<p>Borussia Dortmund and RB Leipzig dropped points on Wednesday, the former in shocking fashion days before a meeting with the latter.</p>
<p>[ MORE: Man City drops Arsenal | Pep reacts ]</p>
<p>Bayer Leverkusen has renewed hope of finishing in the top three after becoming the lone top-four contender to win on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The early match saw USMNT midfielder Weston McKennie bag another goal in another loss, as Schalke fell 2-1 to Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Borussia Dortmund 0-2 Mainz</p>
<p>Jonathan Burkardt and Jean-Philippe Mateta scored as Mainz stunned second-place BVB at the Westalenstadion on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The visitors now are incredibly unlikely to finish in an automatic relegation place and the playoff spot isn’t looking probable either. Mainz is five points clear of 16th-place Fortuna and six ahead of Werder Bremen.</p>
<p>Dortmund had 70 percent of the ball and took 16 of the match’s 25 shots.</p>
<p>Americans Abroad: Giovanni Reyna missed out on the lineup card for the first time in a long time with a bacterial infection. Bild reported that the American 17-year-old tested negative for COVID-19.</p>

<p>Bayer Leverkusen 3-1 Koln</p>
<p>Kai Havertz had a goal and an assist as Bayer Leverkusen moved fourth with a nice home win.</p>
<p>Sven Bender and Moussa Diaby scored the other goals for Bayer, who is back ahead of Borussia Monchengladbach and three back of third-place Leipzig.</p>
<p>Koln remains 13th with 35 points.</p>
<p>RB Leipzig 2-2 Fortuna Dusseldorf</p>
<p>Leipzig has renewed hope of second place but did not take complete advantage of Dortmund’s stumble.</p>
<p>The hosts struck twice after the hour mark including a terrific Kevin Kampl goal and yet another marker from Timo Werner.</p>
<p>But Fortuna kept fighting and found a point thanks to an 87th-minute goal from Steven Skrzybski and a stoppage-time equalizer from Andre Hoffman.</p>
<p>Fortuna’s 29 points are one better than 17th-place Werder Bremen but Mainz is now five points clear of the visitors with only six points left for Fortuna to win.</p>
<p>Americans Abroad: Tyler Adams went 90 minutes for RBL, completing 91 percent of his 67 passes and winning five of six duels. He had two tackles, an interception, and a clearance. On the other side was Alfredo Morales, who departed in the 82d minute with Fortuna down 2-0. He had a rough day passing but did register one key pass and a completed cross. Morales won seven of 15 duels and registered one tackle.</p>
<p>Augsburg 1-3 Hoffenheim</p>
<p>Hoffenheim is back in seventh ahead of what will be a frantic finish in the race for sixth and seventh.</p>
<p>Munas Dabbur scored twice and Ihlas Bebou also found the net against Ruben Vargas’ lone goal for the hosts.</p>
<p>Hoffenheim’s 46 points are level with Wolfsburg and one better than Freiburg. Eintracht Frankfurt is not totally out of the picture with 41, but those odds are long.</p>
<p>Augsburg’s still safe barring calamity, six points ahead of the playoff spot.</p>

Pablo Carrozza, tal vez el periodista más innecesariamente valiente que tiene la televisión argentina, dio este domingo una prueba de dignidad que deberían tener muchos de sus colegas&hellip; Especialmente los que amparaba Daniel Angelici.</p>
<p>Es que con diciembre por la mitad, lejos de estar pensando en un pan dulce cargadísimo de chocolate, frutos secos y glacé, mucho menos en vacacionar en Mar Azul; el tipo sigue pensando en trabajo.</p>
<p>¿Por qué? Porque llegó a su fin un nuevo ciclo de Fútbol al Horno, el programa que desde su nacimiento le cayó como anillo al dedo, y ahora está pensando en dónde seguirá dando rienda libre a sus informes especiales.</p>
<p>Se termina #FútbolAlHorno y @pablocarrozza puso un aviso en los clasificados para conseguir trabajo. pic.twitter.com/Tkl1PD1oof — #FútbolAlHorno ⚽️ (@FutbolalhornoTV) December 15, 2019</p>
<p>Como no tenemos la llave del despacho de recursos humanos en Bolavip, porque de lo contrario ya habríamos salido como posesos alzando lapiceras al grito de contratado, creemos que su decisión de publicar un aviso en los clasificados fue la más acertada.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Busco trabajo. Panelista Full Time. Low Cost. 35 años. Radical. Me pagaron por pegarle a Boca un año entero&rdquo;, comienza diciendo el aviso.</p>
<p>Y sigue: &ldquo;CV. Insta @pablocarrozza. Odio a rugbiers, influencers y plomeros. Acepto canjes de sushi. C/ exp y ref. Chaca. Chaleco. Mini&rdquo;. Repetimos. Si tuvieramos ese poder, ya estaría sentado al lado nuestro.</p>

<h3 id="psg-would-cope-without-neymar-but-would-french-football-suffer">&ldquo;PSG would cope without Neymar but would French football suffer?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/001b3bbd89f9e41fad1272c9290b3192e665b35f/0_59_2246_1347/master/2246.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=a98c71bb230d22c3febdb8b9531479d0" alt="img">
Neymar’s absence from PSG’s first game of the season against Nîmes on Sunday was initially attributed to an injury. Speaking on Saturday, Thomas Tuchel said he was reluctant to risk his star player given that he had only just returned to training after missing the Copa América this summer. However, the full truth emerged later, when PSG sporting director Leonardo admitted there was more to the story than the player’s fitness. “Honestly, it’s not only his physical state,” said Leonardo resignedly. “We’ve had a discussion and, where things weren’t clear before, they’re more advanced now – even though I wouldn’t say there’s an agreement.”</p>
<p>Tuchel says he wants to keep the player. “I love Neymar. I want to continue playing with him, but the reality is that we have to find solutions without Ney. If we lose Neymar, maybe I will not sleep. It’s not possible to lose Ney and find a guy who does the same things as him. I’m trying to convince him to stay but, on the other hand, it’s a personal choice. It’s between him and the club.”</p>
<p>Neymar can leave ‘if offer suits’, says PSG sporting director Leonardo Read more</p>
<p>Even though PSG ran out fairly convincing 3-0 winners against Nîmes – with Kylian Mbappé, Edinson Cavani and Ángel Di María all scoring – Tuchel said his team missed Neymar’s creativity and ability to “find solutions that only he can find”. Although, he was also honest enough to admit that not every fan at the Parc de Princes saw it that way. During the game some supporters chanted “Neymar, you son of a bitch” and unveiled a banner telling the player to “go away”.</p>
<p>“It’s tricky,” said Tuchel. “I don’t know what to say. I saw it on my colleagues’ smartphones because I did not hear them during the match. Can I understand it? Yes and no. He’s still our player, my player and I protect all my players. He’s in my dressing room. I can understand that not everyone has liked what he has said and done.”</p>

<p>The Brazilian was linked with a return to Barcelona throughout the summer – in a variety of intriguing partial swap deals – and now Real Madrid appear to have joined the race for his signature, rekindling an interest in the player that predates his arrival to the Camp Nou. Zinedine Zidane’s squad has no shortage of deadwood; Gareth Bale, Isco, and one of Keylor Navas or Thibaut Courtois have been put forward as tantalising makeweights. Despite already spending heavily this summer, Real are eager to return to the summit of the world game and Neymar would fit their once-heralded galácticos policy perfectly.</p>
<p>Do PSG need to keep Neymar to progress, at least on the pitch? Winning Ligue 1, of course, will be no object. They secured the title at a canter last season even though Neymar missed a large portion of the campaign. In Julian Draxler, Di María and the newly arrived Pablo Sarabia, the champions have more than enough creative drive to rumble past most opponents in France, even if they did fail to win either domestic cup last season.</p>
<p>Do they need him in the Champions League? In his two seasons at the club, Neymar has played 13 games in the competition, scoring scored 11 goals and providing five assists, so surely his absence would be felt on the biggest stage? Well, he has only featured in one knockout match for the club (a 3-1 defeat at Real Madrid) and he was anonymous in their big group stage matches away to Liverpool and Bayern Munich. The idea that his presence could have turned PSG’s last two Champions League campaigns is a lovely thought, but the club have been knocked out of the Champions League sooner with Neymar than without him. With so much money invested in his transfer fee and wages, the squad has been left lacking in depth and balance.</p>

<p>How about Neymar’s influence among his teammates? Is he a leader by example, on the pitch or behind the scenes, setting an example for his fellow professionals? The answer there, again, is decidedly negative, as his opulent parties and frequent trips home demonstrate.</p>
<p>Who, then stands to lose from his departure? The answer may be a very nervous LFP. France’s professional football body is riding high on a wave of goodwill at the moment, a tide that had its genesis in France winning the World Cup and has continued as former Ligue 1 players have continued to have an outsized influence on the rest of European football. This goodwill has helped generate a lucrative new TV contract. Money is seemingly coursing through the league’s coffers. They staged an ambitious pre-season tournament in the US and many clubs were surprisingly aggressive in the summer window – even Amiens, Metz and Toulouse spent more than the brought in on transfers.</p>
<p>What does Neymar have to do with this? Marketability. He has made the league (or at least PSG’s matches) compulsory viewing for many. Kylian Mbappé may have surpassed him as the league’s iconic player after the World Cup last year, but Neymar is still a massive star, particularly in Brazil. His potential departure (coupled with Mbappé’s rumoured exit next summer) could leave the LFP scrambling for another face upon which to pin their hopes, no easy task at the moment.</p>
<p>Neymar’s tricks, dribbles and goals are appreciated on the pitch, but his off-field impact is perhaps even bigger for the league’s officials. Their product, tenuous in its status as a “big five” league as a result of the reformatted Champions League, could regress back to the mean. It is a far cry from the optimism, financial and otherwise, that swirled around France following takeovers at Marseille and Monaco in recent years.</p>
<p>Ligue 1 talking points</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest Victor Osimhen celebrates after scoring for Lille in their 2-1 win over Nantes at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy. Photograph: Pascal Rossignol/Reuters</p>
<p>• It was quite the weekend for debutant attackers across Ligue 1. Toulouse’s Efthymis Koulouris, Amiens’ Chadrac Akolo, and Angers’ Mathias Pereira Lage all found the net, but none of them had quite the impact of Victor Osimhen, the young Nigerian forward who was making his debut for Lille. The former Charleroi striker scored both goals for Lille as they beat Nantes 2-1, a victory that will come as a relief for their supporters following the mass exodus at the club this summer.</p>
<p>• André Villas-Boas looks to be following in the footsteps of Rudi Garcia at Marseille, who only had two shots on target in their 2-0 defeat to Reims at the Vélodrome. Florian Thauvin was a big miss on the right flank, but the rest of the side looked as poor as they did at any point last season. Young defenders Duje Ćaleta-Car and Boubacar Kamara were particularly at sea although the veterans in the team were not much better. Marseille will need more than just a big season from new striker Darío Benedetto to succeed this season.</p>
<p>• Lyon top the table for the moment, though only by dint of alphabetisation. They deserve to be there on merit too, though; the red card shown to Cesc Fàbregas half an hour into their 3-0 win at Monaco no doubt helped, but their performance was impressive nonetheless. Moussa Dembélé scored a thumping header and was a menace throughout; while Lucas Tousart, playing at the base of midfield, was the ideal sentinel and added an impressive goal to boot. There will be sterner tests to come for new manager Sylvinho but, as debuts go, the former Barcelona man appears well suited to Ligue 1.</p>

University of Pikeville Coach Kelly Wells with his wife Shawne, his daughter Kaylee and his son Mason. (UPIKE Athletics) -</p>
<p>Kelly Wells wanted more time with his family.</p>
<p>The last couple weeks have reassured his decision on stepping down as the University of Pikeville basketball coach, getting to spend even more time with his family as we’re stuck under quarantine.</p>
<p>His daughter Kaylee will be a senior next school year, son Mason headed in to eighth grade.</p>
<p>“Family was like my third full-time job. I’m just at a stage in my life where my daughter is a rising senior, son is in eighth grade and figured the time was now, ” Wells said, who made the announcement in late January that this season would be his last as the coach.</p>
<p>Tuesday night would have been the men’s NAIA National championship in Kansas City.</p>
<p>Just nine years ago, Wells and his UPike squad cut down the nets in KC to claim the school’s first ever national championship.</p>
<p>Wells wanted one more crack at it. With the Coronavirus pandemic, Wells didn’t get that chance as the tournament was canceled, putting an end to his coaching career.</p>
<p>In 25 seasons as a coach, Wells won over 550 games from the high school to the college ranks with stops at Marion County High School, Mason County, Hawaii Pacific and Pikeville. He won the 2011 NAIA National title with UPike and the 2003 state title with Mason County. The accolades can go on and on. He also took on the role of Athletic Director at Pikeville two years ago.</p>
<p>But it’s family time now.</p>
<p>“Kaylee really loves volleyball, wants to be an attorney and a lawyer. It’s a really fun time of her life right now and I want to be more a part of it. I want to be able to make it to more of Mason’s basketball practices,” Wells said.</p>
<p>Not to mention more time with his wife Shawne, who he feels has made the sacrifices for his career, it’s now his turn to make some for her.</p>
<p>Wells will still be the Athletic Director at UPike, a role that will keep him busy with 23 sports at the University.</p>
<p>“I’m going from having about 15-20 student-athletes to about 600. I want to have a big impact on that. We just added swimming so that brought us up to 23 sports and we still have so much to be able to do with facilities for example,” Wells said. “The last two years I’ve been the Athletic Director at the school and the head men’s basketball coach. It’s irresponsible and unreasonable to do both. There were days I went home the last two years where I needed to narrow my focus down and days I felt like I didn’t get anything done because so much was going on.”</p>
<p>The coaching itch is still there and probably will be for a while, Wells telling me he woke up in the middle of the night a couple of days ago and wanted to jot some notes down about offensive or defensive sets. He knows it will get easier in due time.</p>
<p>On top of all the wins and championships, Wells feels most accomplished with what he calls his “living trophies”.</p>
<p>“Winning is a byproduct of doing things right. The letters from past players, notes, calls and people that reach out everywhere from the lives you’ve touched mean the most. I call them my living trophies whether if it’s helping find someone a job, them having and raising kids, those are the highlights I look back on,” Wells said.</p>
<p>In 25 years, Wells has helped shape many lives. Wells took the unique path from high school to college coaching. He wanted to be a head coach right away and high school allowed him to do that. It started in 1995 at Marion County, Wells getting into coaching as soon he graduated from Morehead State and his college playing days. He then came to Maysville in 1997-98, a few years later things really took off that included a state title in 2003 and a runner-up finish in 2004.</p>
<p>Which one was more rewarding, the title with Pikeville in 2011 or the one with Mason County in 2003?</p>
<p>“That’s like asking me to pick my favorite child,” Wells said. “They’re exclusively different. At Mason County the tradition was there and success was already at a high level, just finally got over the hump and won a state championship. At UPike the tradition was there, but they came a further distance from Pikeville College to UPike. Both were very special, with very special players, coaching staff and administration.”</p>
<p>After 2004 and a brief stop at Hawaii Pacific, Wells returned to Kentucky to lead Pikeville’s program. In 14 seasons and 332 wins later as a Bear, Wells has a legacy that will be tough to top. He knows the program will be in good hands with newly appointed coach Tigh Compton.</p>
<p>“100 percent,” Wells said. “I would not even considered this if Coach Compton wasn’t here and all the confidence I have in him. He’s been with me for 11 years and knows what it takes. He knows having a good team in the Mid-South Conference doesn’t mean anything. He’ll recruit at a high level, has my 100 percent vote of confidence and look forward to sharing things with him. I’m excited about his future here.”</p>
<p>While he didn’t really get an official way to end his career and say his goodbyes, he did get a bit of a farewell tour when he announced he’d be stepping down in late January that was capped by a celebration after UPike’s final home game. Friends, family and former players gathered for the coach with the best winning percentage by any Pikeville basketball coach with more than a four-year tenure and helped put UPike on the basketball map.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing I’d look back on and do differently honestly. Maybe some games or situations in games, but if I didn’t have those struggles there wouldn’t be growth. We got beat a few times in the region finals at Mason County before making it to state, you either win or you learn. Persevering through my health issues and learning from that helps you grow as a person even more. I’m truly thankful for all my stops along the way and all the people who have helped influence my life along the way,” Wells said.
