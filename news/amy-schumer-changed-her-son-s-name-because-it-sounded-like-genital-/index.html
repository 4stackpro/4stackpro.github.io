The comedic actress revealed on the latest episode of her podcast &ldquo;3 Girls, 1 Keith&rdquo; that she and her husband officially changed her toddler&rsquo;s name after realizing that it sounded like &ldquo;genital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s now Gene David Fischer,&rdquo; she said of her 11-month-old son. &ldquo;It was Gene Attell Fischer but we realized that we, by accident, named our son &lsquo;genital.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>The infant&rsquo;s middle name was a tribute to the couple&rsquo;s friend, comedian Dave Attell.</p>
<p>Schumer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Trainwreck&rdquo; co-star Claudia O&rsquo;Doherty was a guest on the podcast and said she realized the name snafu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mom pointed that out to me, actually,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Doherty said. &ldquo;&ldquo;My mum was like, &lsquo;Amy&rsquo;s called her son genital.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>Schumer told O&rsquo;Doherty and podcast co-hosts Rachel Feinstein, Bridget Everett, and Keith Robinson that going with David as a middle name has its advantages because it&rsquo;s Attell&rsquo;s first name and her father&rsquo;s middle name.

Amy Schumer arranged for a supply of 2,500 KN95 and other crucial supplies to be donated to a New York hospital where her childhood friend Jen Cloudman is among the ranks of brave healthcare workers waging the fight against the coronavirus.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is Jen, my best friend since I was 12 years old,&rsquo; the 38-year-old actress said of her friend, who was in a clip she shared talking to the staff at Mount Sinai South Nassau in Oceanside, New York in a FaceTime exchange.</p>
<p>After Cloudman remarked she was &lsquo;so afraid of running out&rsquo; of the KN95 masks, Schumer arranged for the care package - which also consisted of 2,500 surgical masks, 2,500 &lsquo;corona kits&rsquo; and sanitizer, People reported.</p>

<p>Cloudman told the publication about her longtime friendship with the Trainwreck actress.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve been friends for probably almost 30 years now, since we were 11 years old. We talk all the time,&rsquo; Cloudman told the outlet. &lsquo;So we have a group chat where we just kind of support each other, especially in this time, and it was there that she reached out and said like, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to do this, I can do this, I can help.&quot;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Heroic: The medical staff posed after Amy&rsquo;s donation on behalf of her best friend</p>
<p>Gracious: In the Instagram clip, Cloudman told the New York City native that she and the nursing staff were grateful to have the protective supplies as they treat people battling the pandemic</p>

<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t even know how much it means to us. It makes us feel safer,&rsquo; Cloudman told her longtime friend. &lsquo;We are extremely grateful. Everybody here has really, really been through a lot the last few weeks and to know there&rsquo;s people looking out for us, doing whatever they can, makes a big difference.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Schumer reciprocated the warm feelings toward the hospital workers, saying, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m so grateful to you guys, I&rsquo;m so sorry you have to go through this. I&rsquo;m so proud to know you Jen.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Cloudman told the outlet of the staff&rsquo;s brush with her famous pal: &lsquo;They thought it was funny, but really more than anything, everybody was just happy to get the masks.&rsquo;</p>

<h3 id="why-amy-schumer-changed-her-sons-name">Why Amy Schumer changed her son&rsquo;s name</h3>
<p><img src="http://daijiworld.com/images/daijiSquareLogo.png" alt="img">
Los Angeles, Apr 15 (IANS): Actress-comedienne Amy Schumer has changed the name of her son, Gene Atell. This, because she and her her husband Chris Fischer felt the word sounded like &ldquo;genital&rdquo;!</p>
<p>Schumer and Fischer&rsquo;s 11-month-old son was named Gene Attell Fischer at birth. However, the parents then started having second thoughts about the moniker, reports aceshowbiz.com.</p>
<p>On her podcast, &ldquo;Amy Schumer Presents: 3 Girls, 1 Keith&rdquo;, she spoke up about the decision to change Gene&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;So do you guys know that Gene, our baby&rsquo;s name, is officially changed? It&rsquo;s now Gene David Fischer. It was Gene Attell Fischer but we realised that we by accident named our son, &lsquo;genital&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Schumer and Fischer welcomed their son last year in May. She had shared that she had to go through a three-hour long C-Section.
