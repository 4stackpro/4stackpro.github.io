‘Too Hot to Handle’</p>
<p>Starts streaming: April 17</p>
<p>If you were disappointed that Netflix’s “Love Is Blind” premiered a couple of weeks before we all headed into coronavirus isolation, have I got some good news for you. “Too Hot to Handle” is yet another outrageous dating “experiment” from the streaming giant: Here, we are investigating whether “deeper and more meaningful connections” will form when sex is banned. In order to create as much unscientific drama as possible, the show is set in a beachside villa populated by “the hottest, horniest, commitment-phobic swipesters” — (if this sounds like “Love Island,” you’re not far-off — who are then told that they can’t have sex by a digital personal assistant called Lana. Amounts are deducted from the prize money every time there is sexual contact between contestants, and my guess is at this point in this description, you know whether you’ll be watching or not.</p>
<p>‘Never Have I Ever’</p>
<p>Starts streaming: April 27</p>
<p>Mindy Kaling drew on her teenage years in California to create this half-hour coming-of-age show. We meet Devi (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan), a first-generation Indian-American, at the beginning of her sophomore year in high school. She’s determined to get her and her besties boyfriends, but the rest of the school is more interested in the fact that she’s out of the wheelchair she’d been using since a mystery paralysis took hold after her dad died of a heart attack. Devi is having a tough time, and “Never Have I Ever” grounds her struggles in sessions with her therapist (a wonderful Niecy Nash) and knowing narration from John McEnroe — yep, the tennis player — as well as moments of awkward teenage hilarity. “Never Have I Ever” is a show that respects the complexity of teenagers’ feelings, and it’s refreshing to see an actual teenager, Ramakrishnan, play the lead, and do it so well.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dzGyS5_KFq95vVpTn3Ggz5DMHHo=/0x0:2416x1265/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15988557/Screen_Shot_2019_03_26_at_1.46.09_PM.png" alt="img">
Apple and Goldman Sachs have allowed Apple Card users to defer their March 2020 credit payments due to the financial impact that the coronavirus is having on many people. According to Bloomberg, Apple has extended the grace period through April, letting its cardholders defer the payment this month.</p>
<p>There’s one simple step to take in order to be eligible. Just open the Wallet app on your iPhone, then message a support representative and request to be enrolled in the Customer Assistance Program.</p>
<p>The company notes in the email sent to Apple Card users that those who enrolled in the Customer Assistance Program to defer their March payments will need to do so again for their April payments in order to avoid building up interest. And since this pandemic unfortunately shows no sign of slowing down, we’ll have to wait and see if it continues the promotion for May.
