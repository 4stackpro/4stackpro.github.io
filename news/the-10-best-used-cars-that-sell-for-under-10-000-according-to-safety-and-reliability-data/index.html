<p>Car search engine and automotive research firm iSeeCars.com has compiled a list of the 10 best used cars under $10,000 with good safety ratings.</p>
<p>Of the ten cars, seven are made by Japanese automakers Nissan, Toyota, Mazda, and Honda, with the latter populating the list three times via one Accord and two Civic builds. The other three vehicles on the list are produced by Korea-based Kia, and US-based Dodge and Chevrolet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Accord and Civic are both popular vehicles known for their safety and reliability,&rdquo; iSeeCars CEO Phong Ly said.</p>
<p>Ly also believes that the $10,000 price range allows potential car buyers to find &ldquo;a safe and reliable vehicle in the generally lower-priced passenger car segment,&rdquo; according to the study.</p>
<p>The search engine used data from over 6.1 million used cars sold between October 2019 and March 2020 for the study. It then compared the batch with iSeeCar&rsquo;s previous &ldquo;Longest-Lasting Cars&rdquo; study, and Insurance Institute for Highway Safety&rsquo;s (IIHS) safety scores or National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&rsquo;s (NHTSA) ratings, depending on the vehicle. The average price for each model for all model years was then calculated.</p>
<p>The cars that were deemed long lasting, received a good safety score from IIHS or a 4.0 or higher on NHTSA&rsquo;s crash test rating, and have an average price under $10,000 were then selected for this list. Keep scrolling to see the 10 cars that made the cut:

<h3 id="china-is-giving-cash-to-car-buyers-to-revive-sales-crushed-by-the-pandemic">China is giving cash to car buyers to revive sales crushed by the pandemic</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200413092729-01-wuhan-honda-0407-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
Hong Kong (CNN Business) In a normal year, China would have sold more than 6 million new cars by now. This year, the number is closer to 3.7 million, and now the government is handing out cash to help the world&rsquo;s biggest auto market get back on its feet after the coronavirus pandemic .</p>
<p>Car sales declined 42% in the first quarter of 2020 compared to last year, according to data released late last week by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM). While that is largely because of a whopping 79% plunge in February — when the country of 1.4 billion people recorded just 310,000 sales — the market remains very weak. Only 1.43 million vehicles were sold in China last month, a 43% decline over March 2019.</p>
<p>The auto industry plays a crucial role in China&rsquo;s economy. More than 40 million people in the country rely on the sector for jobs, either directly or indirectly. The industry generates more than $1 trillion in revenue each year, roughly 10% of China&rsquo;s manufacturing output.</p>
<p>A healthy Chinese car market is also important to the rest of the world. Global automakers likeandsell millions of cars in China — each of those companies, for example, depend on the country for roughly 40% of their total sales.</p>
<p>Returning to anything resembling normality, though, will be difficult for China. The economy is still trying to rebound after the government attempted toquash the coronavirus outbreak by placing entire cities on lockdown and restricting travel. Auto manufacturing stalled as the measures forced factories to close and snarled supply chains. Much of the world is also still under lockdown, complicating the recovery.</p>
<p>Car production, at least, has started to resume in China: Even Wuhan, the original epicenter of the virus and a major hub for the global auto industry, ended its 76-day lockdown last week</p>
<p>But getting consumers to buy new cars again is harder, and made even more challenging by the fact that consumer demand was already slowing significantly before the virus hit. Total car sales in China fell about 8% in 2019 to just under 25.8 million after having slid nearly 3% in 2018 — the first contraction since the 1990s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the supply chain disruption by coronavirus is surely a headache for auto makers, plummeting demand could be even more life-threatening after two consecutive years of sales contraction in China,&rdquo; wrote Alicia García-Herrero, chief Asia Pacific economist at Natixis, in a recent research note.</p>
<p>García-Herrero added in an interview with CNN Business that the 43% drop in March, while an improvement over February, was still &ldquo;massive,&rdquo; especially given the slowdown that was already underway.</p>
<p>An &lsquo;urgent need&rsquo; to boost sales</p>
<p>China knows it has a demand problem on its hands. CAAM said in a statement Friday that as automakers restart production, boosting sales is now the industry&rsquo;s &ldquo;primary issue&rdquo; and an &ldquo;urgent need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the car market may rebound in the second quarter, it&rsquo;s unlikely that China will be able to make up for its losses in the first quarter, CAAM added.</p>
<p>The industry association did not release a new forecast for sales this year. Before the outbreak, it predicted a 2% drop in 2020. Recent independent estimates, though, have been severe: China&rsquo;s auto sales could decline by as much as 10% this year, according to an analysis S&amp;P Ratings published last week.</p>
<p>China is taking steps to try to shore up sales. Beijing last month announced that it would extend subsidies and tax breaks for new energy vehicles, such as electric or plug-in hybrid cars, for another two years.</p>
<p>Tesla TSLA The country had begun dramatically cutting those incentives last year in order to weed out underperforming companies. But electric vehicles have suffered more than the broader market. Last month, only 53,000 such cars were sold, a 53% drop compared to a year earlier. (That amount, though, excludes, the American automaker that has lately been pushing hard for Chinese customers .)</p>
<p>Local governments are also stepping in. At least a dozen cities or provinces have encouraged people to buy cars, mainly by offering cash subsidies of as much as $1,400 per vehicle.</p>
<p>The country is likely hoping that demand will return as schools reopen this spring and the summer season approaches, too. The need to drive children to and from school is a big reason why people in China buy cars, according to the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA), another trade group.</p>
<p>CPCA Secretary General Cui Dongshu also noted earlier this month that China&rsquo;s Labor Day holiday in May will last five days this year, longer than it has been in more than a decade. He&rsquo;s hoping the desire to travel over a long holiday could boost sales.</p>
<p>Less money to spare</p>
<p>Handing out cash and hoping drivers return to the roads, though, isn&rsquo;t going to be enough to save China&rsquo;s sagging car market.</p>
<p>The explosive sales growth that defined China&rsquo;s car market in the 1990s is long gone. And García-Herrero noted in her research report that the purchasing power of Chinese consumers has been weakening, creating an underlying structural problem that could plague sales for a long time to come.</p>
<p>The ensuing lack of demand for cars — and other big-ticket items — can be attributed to a host of problems that have bedeviled China&rsquo;s economy in recent years. García-Herrero pointed, for example, to rising housing costs that have reduced the amount of money that Chinese consumers can set aside for other purchases.

<h3 id="are-we-doing-enough-to-protect-connected-cars">Are we doing enough to protect connected cars?</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.helpnetsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/09102207/connected_car.jpg" alt="img">
Even though connected cars should meet the highest level of security, safety, and performance, we know this is not always the case. In this interview, Moshe Shlisel, CEO at GuardKnox, discusses today’s most pressing issues related to automotive security.</p>
<p>What are the most significant challenges related to the creation of a detailed threat taxonomy for the connected vehicles ecosystem?</p>
<p>The trend in the automotive industry is to add solutions that entail more connectivity, such as IT-based solutions. But, to effectively thwart cyber threats, vehicles require cyber security solutions without the need for constant connectivity and which are suited for moving platforms unlike traditional IDS/IPS solutions and firewalls. While greater automotive connectivity promises to significantly enhance the driving experience, it also creates new attack vectors for hackers to exploit.</p>
<p>Vehicles should not need constant human interaction with the cybersecurity aspects of a vehicle in order to prevent cyber-attacks. To ensure that the foundation of a vehicle’s critical security system is safe, vehicles must be secure by design: security must be embedded within every aspect of the vehicle. There will always be new threats, but a car should be capable of stopping cyberattacks through standalone solutions that do not require any human intervention, and which are not learning mechanisms but rather deterministic.</p>
<p>What are the most pressing and actionable good practices manufacturers can do in order to improve the cybersecurity of connected cars?</p>
<p>Simply put, going forward, all vehicles must be secure by design. Cybersecurity should be embedded from the first stages of a car’s design, well before they’re manufactured. Treating cybersecurity as an afterthought is a surefire recipe for failure. As it is, there are millions of connected and semi-autonomous vehicles on the road with no cybersecurity that will require after-market cyber protection. Drop-in, hardware-based aftermarket solutions will be needed to adequately secure vehicles on the road. Ultimately, automakers must ensure that critical-safety systems in vehicles are not vulnerable to hackers’ exploitation techniques.</p>
<p>The time is now for manufacturers to embrace these good practices, as potential threats grow more and more severe. Hackers, for instance, could remotely interfere with a connected vehicle and disrupt safety critical systems and functions including the engine, brakes, and steering wheel, causing the driver to lose control. On a larger scale, a hacker could enter a single vehicle and access an entire fleet, as a fleet is only secure as its least-secure vehicle.</p>
<p>As drivers crave more personalization and customization features, vehicles will be even more connected and will need the ability to host and process in-vehicle updates safely. Each connected car and each vehicle component – from telematics to infotainment to GPS and beyond – must therefore be cyber-secure.</p>
<p>What type of security controls and policy initiatives would you like to see when it comes to connected vehicles?</p>
<p>As cars have more connected and autonomous features (even partially autonomous), they are extremely susceptible to malicious cyberattacks and could potentially be weaponized. Federal lawmakers should enact legislation – with the input of cybersecurity experts – setting uniform safety standards across the board for these vehicles. We see the beginnings of this in the U.S., as several bills – such as the SPY Car Act and AV START Act – have been drafted surrounding connected and autonomous vehicles, but no bill has yet succeeded.</p>
<p>We offered comments for legislation, but federal standards still remain voluntary. Until governments authorize rigorous vehicle cyber standards, drivers, passengers, pedestrians, and cargo are in harm’s way. It took well over 20 years for seatbelts to be properly regulated – this should not be the case for cybersecurity.</p>
<p>In addition, ISO and SAE have joined forces to establish and standardize automotive cybersecurity from the concept phase to post-deployment when vehicles are in customer’s hands with the new ISO/SAE 21404 standard.</p>
<p>How do you see the cybersecurity of vehicle systems evolve in the near future? What should consumers look out for?</p>
<p>Cybersecurity is a cat and mouse game and hackers must continue to be fought with smarter technology. All new connected vehicles will need to be secured during manufacturing, and all connected vehicles already on the road will need to be retrofitted with robust aftermarket cyber secure solutions.</p>
<p>Consumers should be looking for full end-to-end solution that addresses all vulnerabilities including but not limited data transfer and OTA updates in and out of the vehicle. Cybersecurity solutions must empower automakers and consumers with the freedom to evolve to meet the changing needs of connected cars safely and securely.</p>
<p>It’s important to note, however, that it’s not only cybersecurity that manufacturers should be focused on. Drivers continue to demand a better in-vehicle experience; therefore, automakers must offer products that enable high-performance computing that is secure by design.</p>
<p>Yet, while consumers are demanding a safer, more innovative, in-vehicle experience, the current electronic architecture in vehicles does not enable the automotive services model to securely support vehicle applications, functions, and data usage. Technology must empower automakers to address increasing consumer demand for a personalized and secure driving experience while simultaneously opening up a new revenue stream for OEMs.</p>
<p>Consumers have the right to know, when they are buying a car, that the vehicle comes equipped with cybersecurity. A cybersecurity rating system might be in order so consumers understand that their vehicles are secure and feel protected.
