Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announces New Zealand has had its first death from coronavirus.</p>
<p>New Zealand&rsquo;s sharemarket kicked off the week in negative territory, but posted a 1 per cent gain late on Monday.</p>
<p>By 5.30pm the benchmark NZX-50 had reversed earlier losses to rise 1.09 per cent, or 104 points, to 9661.19.</p>
<p>That was in contrast with declines on Asian share markets on Monday as countries reported surging numbers of infections from the coronavirus that has prompted shutdowns of travel and business in many parts of the world.</p>

<p>The New Zealand sharemarket was going to remain under pressure with such global uncertainty, said Grant Davies, of brokers Hamilton Hindin Greene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sharemarkets don&rsquo;t like uncertainty, and that&rsquo;s all we have at the moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shares in retail chain Smith City were negative all day, but plunged in late trading to be down 42.5 per cent at 10 cents after it said it had reached a deal with its bank, ASB, about delaying a debt repayment.</p>
<p>ASB has agreed to delay by four weeks the repayment of $1.5 million of Smiths City&rsquo;s $65 million Senior Secured Facility, due on Tuesday.</p>
<p>JOSEPH JOHNSON/STUFF Hallenstein Glasson shares fell on news of a decline in its six-month profit.</p>
<p>Smiths City believed it had enough capital to cover its debts, but said its capital structure was not sustainable and it had to secure more funding. It was working with PWC to develop a plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even before the Government imposed the Covid-19 Level 4 Alert, Smiths City warned on March 18 2020 that it had seen a reduction in sales and the number of customers passing through its stores and that these trends were directly attributable to the pandemic,&rdquo; the company told the NZX.</p>
<p>&ldquo;ASB&rsquo;s extension of the facility demonstrated its willingness to support Smiths City through this extraordinary period and give Smiths City the space to engage in discussions with potential investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hallenstein Glasson fell 6.5 per cent to $2.72 after a decline in its six-month profit. The company said net profit was down 3.8 per cent on a year earlier, in line with guidance. Sales for the first seven weeks of the current financial period were up, until it had to close stores due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The company joins the growing ranks of businesses deciding not to pay a dividend.</p>
<p>Fletcher Building, which said independent non-executive director Steve Vamos has resigned, fell 2.4 per cent to $3.20.</p>
<p>Air New Zealand was flat at 90c, Auckland Airport fell 5.3 per cent to $5.24, and Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare was up 6.6 per cent at $30.35. Tourism Holdings fell 10 per cent to $1.08.</p>
<p>Shares in dental company Abano were down 22.8 per cent at $1.80 after it said a takeover offer from Bidco at $5.70 per share was off.</p>
<p>In November, Bidco announced a $150 million takeover bid for Abano, described as the largest dental group in Australasia, with clinics under the Lumino The Dentists brand in New Zealand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abano Healthcare Group Limited advises that it has agreed with Adams NZ Bidco Limited that a Material Adverse Change has occurred and, as a result, Bidco has terminated the Scheme Implementation Agreement,&rdquo; Abano said on Monday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No break fee is payable by Abano or by Bidco, and the parties have agreed they have no other liability to each other, as a result of the termination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rubber products company Skellerup fell 6.78 per cent to $1.65 after it withdrew its guidance and said it had reduced some of its services to concentrate on essential services.</p>
<p>Australia&rsquo;s benchmark ASX200 Index was up more than 4 per cent on Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>In the US on Sunday evening, futures for the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 300 points, signalling another volatile week after it tumbled more than 900 points on Friday. Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s 500 futures lost 1.5 per cent.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump late on Sunday extended the national social distancing guidelines to April 30 as US fatalities from the pandemic climbed above 2300. The announcement came after Trump said last week he hoped to open up the country by Easter.</p>
<p>Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, projected between 100,000 and 200,000 people could die from the virus.</p>
<p>The US stock market has shed more than 20 per cent since touching records just over a month ago, although on Friday the Dow still notched its biggest weekly gain since 1938.

<h3 id="covid-19-smiths-city-retail-chain-in-talks-with-potential-investors">Covid-19: Smiths City retail chain in talks with potential investors</h3>

Almost all staff stood down at retail chain. Credit: Smiths City</p>
<p>Retail chain and HP retail partner Smiths City has come out of a trading halt and is initiating discussions with potential strategic investors to support the business.</p>
<p>Smiths City, which sells mainly furniture and appliances but also a range of home and SME technology gear through a network of 32 stores nationwide, went into a trading halt late on Friday citing the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on its business.</p>
<p>Even before the government imposed the Covid-19 Level 4 Alert, Smiths City warned on 18 March that it had seen a reduction in sales and the number of customers passing through its stores and that these trends were directly attributable to the pandemic.</p>
<p>The government’s subsequent imposition of the Covid-19 Alert Level 4 has since required Smiths City to close its stores, including its online outlet.</p>
<p>These conditions and the new Covid-19 restrictions represented a &ldquo;material and significant challenge to the business&rdquo;, it told investors today.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we noted in our 18 March 2020 market announcement, Smiths City is undertaking a comprehensive review of its operations,&rdquo; it said.</p>
<p>The company had stood down almost all its 465 employees for at least the term of the Level 4 Alert on 80 per cent of their salary or wage entitlements, in line with the terms of the Government’s support package.</p>
<p>Directors and the chief executive and other senior executives had also agreed a 20 per cent reduction in their remuneration.</p>
<p>A skeleton staff remained working on business continuity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The company has initiated a number of measures to manage expenses and cashflow in line with sales performance including negotiations with landlords, reductions in new inventory and operating expenses and cancelled or deferred capital expenditure.</p>
<p>Following discussions last Friday, Smiths City’s banker, ASB, agreed to delay by four weeks, the repayment of $1.5 million of the company’s $65 million senior secured facility due for payment on 31 March.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While Smiths City believes it has enough capital to cover its debts as they fall due, the company recognises the current capital structure is not sustainable given the outlook and the company must secure more funding,&rdquo; it said today.</p>
<p>Smiths City is also working with PwC to develop a strategy for addressing its capital structure.</p>
<p>“ASB’s extension of the facility demonstrated its willingness to support Smiths City through this extraordinary period and give Smiths City the space to engage in discussions with potential investors,&rdquo; chief executive Roy Campbell said.</p>
<p>“Our focus continues to be on the health and wellbeing of our team and customers, including doing all that we can to prevent the spread of Covid-19, and ensuring business continuity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am grateful for the resilience and continuing loyalty our team and our broader community of partners have shown as we navigate this period of uncertainty.</p>
<p>“Smiths City is committed to keeping the market informed and will provide more information as it becomes available.”</p>
<p>Other tech brands offered include Apple, Samsung, Epson and Canon.</p>
<p>For the half years ended 31 October 2019, Smiths City reported revenue fell to $95.1 million from $114.2 million due to the closure of two stores and slower trading than the prior year.</p>
