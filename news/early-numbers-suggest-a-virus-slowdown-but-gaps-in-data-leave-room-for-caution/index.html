<p>Vermont’s COVID-19 cases are doubling every four days. Last week they were doubling every two to three days.</p>
<p>As the COVID-19 outbreak spreads through Vermont, some signs point to the beginnings of success in curbing the rate of spread.</p>
<p>The latest data from the Department of Health shows the number of COVID-19 cases in Vermont is doubling every four days, said Easton White, a researcher at the University of Vermont. That’s a decline from a week ago, when the number of cases was doubling every two to three days.</p>
<p>Get all of VTDigger&rsquo;s daily news. You&rsquo;ll never miss a story with our daily headlines in your inbox.</p>
<p>“I think it is fair to say the doubling time is increasing at this point,” White said via email.</p>
<p>That data may be a reflection of the beginning of social distancing trends that began to take effect around March 15, as Gov. Phil Scott closed schools, limited crowds to 50 people, and ordered businesses to go remote.</p>
<p>White said that any improvements caused by those actions are likely on a delay, since it takes time for the virus to incubate, for infected people to develop symptoms and for patients to get test results.</p>
<p>It also may be the result of increased testing, White said. If more people are tested for COVID-19 and found to be negative, that will increase the total being tested and lower the percent of people testing positive, lowering the case rate.</p>
<p>Vermont continues to have among the highest testing rates in the nation for COVID-19, conducting 63 tests for every 10,000 residents — just below New York, Washington and Louisiana, according to the COVID Tracking Project.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Department of Health published new data on hospitalizations, revealing that 21 patients were hospitalized at the time for COVID-19. The new data also shows that even more patients, 52, are hospitalized “under investigation for COVID-19.”</p>
<p>VTDigger is underwritten by:</p>
<p>It’s unclear how many COVID-19 cases have been hospitalized in general, or the rate of hospitalization, since the department did not say how many COVID-19 patients have been discharged since the start of the epidemic.</p>
<p>A broader understanding of the pace of Vermont’s outbreak to come is still missing. Vermont is working on a model to show the coming rate of cases based on a variety of data sources, according to Mike Smith, secretary of the Agency of Human Services.</p>
<p>Smith said the state’s ability to expand testing capacity will help it develop a more precise model.</p>
<p>“We are waiting because we needed to have a statistically significant amount of data,” he said.</p>
<p>The Scott administration is using worst case scenarios based on Wuhan, Italy and Spain to prepare for a surge in hospitalizations, according to Conor Kennedy, a spokesperson for the Agency of Human Services.</p>
<p>That peak could occur in the next few weeks, Levine said, and when it hits, “it’s going to be like the opiate crisis.”</p>
<p>“Everyone will be able to say they know someone who died or suffered,” Levine said. “That’s how it’s playing out across the country. It’s only a matter of time. Every state will have its sad set of stories.”</p>
<p>Researchers and hospitals are creating their own models of how COVID-19 could spread. One University of Washington analysis projected Vermont’s peak cases would hit as soon as next week, April 7 — but other researchers cautioned that data may not be accurate. It predicted that Vermont would need 183 hospital beds on March 31, far more than the 73 current hospitalized patients.</p>
<p>CHIME, another model developed by Penn researchers, allows hospitals to plug in their unique numbers and get an estimate of how many COVID-19 patients to expect, but it does not allow for a statewide tally.</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s lead infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, released a model Tuesday that shows 100,000 to 240,000 Americans could die of the coronavirus, in spite of social distancing policies that have banned large gatherings and led to the abrupt closing of businesses and schools. The biggest outbreak is in the New York City metro area, and positive cases have been reported in every state. More than 3,400 people have died since the pandemic took hold in the United States, the New York Times reports.</p>

<h3 id="virtual-blockchain-week-is-a-virus-proof-crypto-conference">Virtual Blockchain Week Is A Virus-Proof Crypto Conference</h3>

It’s just the kind of event that these sequestered, hunkered-down times call for.</p>
<p>With COVID-19 still wreaking havoc on any plans to get more than ten people in a room together, Virtual Blockchain Week is a weeklong conference taking place completely online, and it just so happens that Cointelegraph is the primary media partner for the event.</p>
<p>Virtual Blockchain Week attendees simply tune into the appropriate webcast to participate. The agenda kicks off the evening of April 26 and features a full lineup of huge blockchain names giving presentations and participating in fireside chats the entire following week.</p>
<p>Because of the online nature of the event, this conference agenda won’t be shifted around or canceled for coronavirus reasons. You don’t even necessarily need to pay to attend — there’s a free ticket available if you want it — but a $97 VIP ticket will include a networking pre-party and speaker meet-and-greets. Furthermore, 50% of the money generated by selling these VIP tickets will go to a COVID-19 non-profit relief effort, the specific organization still TBD.</p>
<p>Confirmed agenda participants include such A-list crypto names as Tim Draper, CZ, Caitlin Long, Charlie Shrem, Brittany Kaiser, Anthony Pompliano, and Mati Greenspan. Now you don’t even need to leave home to catch up with the latest from these industry leaders.</p>
<p>“Right now we’re locked in around the world. Conferences are canceled,” said Joel Comm, cohost of the Bad Crypto Podcast and co-organizer of Virtual Blockchain Week. “There’s a need for connection and content now more than ever. It’s amazing how quickly people responded to our virtual conference — within 48 hours we had commitments from 23 speakers.</p>
<p>So stay tuned until the end of April. We’ll be bringing you the latest coverage and analysis from Virtual Blockchain Week, whether you score your free ticket or not.

<h3 id="phage---using-a-virus-against-a-virus">Phage - Using a Virus Against a Virus</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.technologynetworks.com/tn/images/thumbs/jpeg/640_360/phage-using-a-virus-against-a-virus-332803.jpg?cb=20200401" alt="img">
Read Time:</p>
<p>On the basis of an empty – and therefore non-infectious – shell of a phage virus, researchers from Berlin have developed a chemically modified phage capsid that “stifles” influenza viruses. Perfectly fitting binding sites cause influenza viruses to be enveloped by the phage capsids in such a way that it is practically impossible for them to infect lung cells any longer. This phenomenon has been proven in pre-clinical trials, also involving human lung tissue.</p>
<p>Researchers from the Leibniz-Forschungsinstitut für Molekulare Pharmakologie (FMP), Freie Universität Berlin, Technische Universität Berlin (TU), Humboldt-Universität (HU), the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) and Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin were involved in this groundbreaking work. The results are also being used for the immediate investigation of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Influenza viruses are still highly dangerous: The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that flu is responsible for up to 650,000 deaths per year worldwide. Current antiviral drugs are only partially effective because they attack the influenza virus after lung cells have been infected. It would be desirable – and much more effective – to prevent infection in the first place.</p>
<p>This is exactly what the new approach from Berlin promises. The phage capsid, developed by a multidisciplinary team of researchers, envelops flu viruses so perfectly that they can no longer infect cells. “Pre-clinical trials show that we are able to render harmless both seasonal influenza viruses and avian flu viruses with our chemically modified phage shell,” explained Professor Dr. Christian Hackenberger, Head of the Department Chemical Biology at the Leibniz-Forschungsinstitut für Molekulare Pharmakologie (FMP) and Leibniz Humboldt Professor for Chemical Biology at HU Berlin. “It is a major success that offers entirely new perspectives for the development of innovative antiviral drugs.”</p>
