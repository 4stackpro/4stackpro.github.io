Happy birthday to Elton John’s smash hit album “Elton John,” released 50 years ago on April 10, 1970. There are few artists who have achieved the cross-generational appeal and success Elton John has. Throughout his decades-long career, he’s been loved by millions of fans, young and old, around the world. His music has stood the test of time as he’s continually appealed to the masses through songs that embrace sentimentality and speak to humanity’s universal experiences. In the past 50 years, John has recorded over 35 studio albums, as well as countless singles and collaborative projects — selling more than 250 million albums worldwide, making him one of the top selling artists worldwide.</p>
<p>John has no shortage of classic albums that have been revolutionary to the music industry, but it was his self-titled second album that shot him into international stardom and solidified his career. His debut album “Empty Sky,” released in 1969, was a terrible first impression into the music industry, and has largely been forgotten about over time. It wasn’t until “Border Song” and “Your Song” exploded on the American radio and charts in early 1970, that many began to take notice of John — assuming the “Elton John” album was his debut. The LP flew off the shelves here in the U.S. upon its release and brought John out of the U.K. shadows.</p>
<p>Recorded at Trident Studios in London, John collaborated with producer Gus Dudgeon and arranger Paul Buckmaster to bring “Elton John” to life. The two had worked on David Bowie’s “Space Oddity” the previous year, prompting John to get them on board with his new project. “We had heard ‘Space Oddity’, which for me was one of the best records of all time, and we learned that it was produced by Gus Dudgeon,” said John in “Elton: The Biography,” written by David Buckley. “And we knew then that we had to get him to produce my second album.”</p>
<p>Where “Empty Sky” faltered, “Elton John” soared, showcasing John’s sonic advancement and his long-time songwriting partner Bernie Taupin’s lyrical maturity. “On the ‘Empty Sky’ record we sounded like naive little rock &amp; rollers, then suddenly … it was night and day,” John said in an interview with Rolling Stone. “I don’t know what happened. I’d fi­nally found my own voice, and the seismic change was happening in Bernie’s lyrics.” It was a triumphant return to the studio for John and Taupin, creating an album rich in powerful melodies, vocals and vivid lyrical imagery.</p>
<p>It’s an album that’s still a delight to listen to now, 50 years later. “Elton John” was a true testament to the untapped potential and sheer talent John and Taupin possessed when they were starting out. “Your Song,” the most popular and beautiful song on the record, exploded onto the radio in 1970 and hasn’t ever left. As an artist, when your compositions can endure half a century and continue to be loved, that’s the pinnacle of success. John’s gift was his song, one that he’s yet to stop giving. Looking back on “Elton John,” I see one of the greatest rock, pop albums recorded. It paved the way for a lifetime of weird, wonderful and poetic music, so it’s worth celebrating this brilliant album with a listen.</p>

<h3 id="freddie-mercury-and-elton-johns-beautiful-friendship-from-drag-alter-egos-to-aids-heartbreak">Freddie Mercury and Elton John&rsquo;s beautiful friendship from drag alter egos to Aids heartbreak</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article9309828.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_John-Peter-Freddie.jpg" alt="img">
Freddie Mercury and Elton John are true icons, stamping their mark on music and the world with remarkable careers.</p>
<p>Both hitmakers of the 1970s and beyond, it seemed natural that the two meet on more than one occasion.</p>
<p>That they became such close pals was a match made in showbiz heaven - two larger than life characters, beloved by millions, came together in a friendship that lasted across decades.</p>
<p>Freddie tragically died in 1991, after a secret battle with Aids, only telling the world of his medical status hours before his final breath.</p>
<p>Recent revelations by Elton, now 73, have given fans a glimpse into the relationship that became so strong that he was one of the few people Freddie allowed to see him as he lay dying.</p>
<p>(Image: Hulton Archive/Getty Images)</p>
<p>Elton describes Freddie&rsquo;s final days in his memoirs - during which the Queen frontman never lost his sense of humour or kindness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was too frail to get out of bed,&rdquo; the Rocketman singer recalled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was losing his sight, his body was covered in Kaposi&rsquo;s sarcoma lesions, and he was still definitely Freddie, gossiping away, completely outrageous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was Freddie down to a tee, says Elton, and he&rsquo;d been the same since they first met back in the &rsquo;70s.</p>
<p>Since their first meeting, they&rsquo;d been through a lot together - Elton experiencing addiction issues in &rsquo;80s.</p>
<p>It was Freddie, in fact, who led the charge among Elton&rsquo;s celeb pals to get him to kick his cocaine habit, and encouraged him into rehab.</p>
<p>Elton told that his addiction issues had stemmed from a struggle with fame and an emotionally tough childhood - but Freddie was there to point him in the right direction.</p>
<p>(Image: Getty Images)</p>
<p>And Elton was just as committed to Freddie, starstruck by his iconic onstage performances.</p>
<p>He told The Guardian of Queen&rsquo;s Live Aid performance in 1985, often considered the greatest live gig of all time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a huge area that I kind of decorated. I made sure there were seats for everyone, so that people who were playing could sit down and have a natter.</p>
<p>(Image: fs) (Image: Redferns)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freddie came over after Queen had stolen the show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Freddie, nobody should go on after you, you were magnificent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a cheeky smile, Freddie came back: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re absolutely right, darling, we were. We killed them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elton also recalled that Freddie never failed to be exceedingly generous, even on his deathbed.</p>
<p>(Image: Getty)</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Christmas morning,&rdquo; he remembered, &ldquo;[Musician] Tony King came round and gave me this pillow case&hellip;.my drag name is Sharon and Freddie was Melina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the beautiful pillowcase was a watercolour painting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the note that went with it, it said, &lsquo;Dear Sharon, I saw this at auction and thought you would love it. I love you, Melina.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elton still has the painting, and the pillowcase.
