Rihanna always knows what the people need before they do, and of course, the people had no idea they needed to see the singer/beauty mogul/badass on not one, but two covers of British Vogue&rsquo;s May 2020 issue. Not only does Bad Girl Rih Rih grace the front of the renowned glossy, but she does so in a Stephen Jones Millinery durag. So, if you&rsquo;re keeping track, that&rsquo;s two durags on the cover of British Vogue. Color us impressed.</p>
<p>A quick rundown for those who don&rsquo;t know: A durag is a scarf worn to set Black hairstyles. It will keep your curls and waves in place, protect cornrows and braids from frizzing, and keep locs looking crisp. They were popularized for fashionable use by rappers like Nelly and 50 Cent in the late &rsquo;90s and early 2000s, and we&rsquo;ve seen stars like Solange wear them on the red carpet. They&rsquo;ve become a staple accessory in modern Black beauty and grooming.</p>
<p>Now, this isn&rsquo;t the first time Rih has worn a durag on a major fashion platform — in 2014, she wore a Swarovski crystal-encrusted one to match her Adam Selman dress when she won the CFDA Fashion Icon award. She also wore one for her performance at the 2016 MTV VMAs, and outfitted some of the models in her Spring 2017 Fenty x Puma fashion show with — you guessed it — durags.</p>
<p>Black hair culture is and always has been high fashion, a statement Rihanna has never feared to make time and time again. Remember when she wore that doobie wrap to the 2013 American Music Awards? Legendary.</p>
<p>The shoot was photographed by Steven Klein and styled by editor-in-chief of British Vogue Edward Enninful, with hair by Rih&rsquo;s long-time hairstylists Yusef Williams and Naphia White. Even Enniful is in awe of this cover, writing in his Instagram caption, &ldquo;And did I ever imagine that I would see a durag on the cover of Vogue? No, reader, I did not. Although this potent symbol of black life — of self-preservation, resistance, and authenticity — has an important place in popular culture, it is rarely viewed through the prism of high fashion. Yet, here we have the most fabulous, aspirational, and beautiful durag, worn by a woman who is breaking every boundary she comes up against. How exciting.&rdquo; We couldn&rsquo;t say it better ourselves.</p>
<p>Also, we would be remiss if we didn&rsquo;t mention that stunning blue &ldquo;truth&rdquo; makeup by Isamaya Ffrench, which we will be replicating in our bedrooms, thank you very much. We definitely have the time to practice getting that lettering down.</p>

Rihanna makes history in the May 2020 issue of British Vogue, becoming the first person to ever wear a durag on the cover of the prestigious fashion publication.</p>
<p>The Barbadian singer, songwriter, actress, and businesswoman poses in the durag for a high-fashion shoot captured by critically-acclaimed photographer Steven Klein.</p>
<p>Inside the magazine, Rihanna speaks to British broadcaster Afua Hirsch about her experience of living in London and the global struggle with racism.</p>
<p>Rebel: Rihanna makes history in May 2020 issue of British Vogue , becoming the first person to ever wear a durag on the cover of the prestigious fashion publication</p>
<p>The star has called the UK capital home for the past three years, revealing she loves the anonymity she feels among flash London crowds who are &lsquo;too bougie to give a s**t about me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Living in London though has given the globe-trotting star a different perspective on the struggle against racism and injustice which she insists is &lsquo;everywhere&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think police brutality is probably extremely severe in America,&rsquo; she explains, &lsquo;but racism is alive everywhere. Everywhere&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s the same [in the UK]. It&rsquo;s either blatant, which is becoming more and more of a norm, or it&rsquo;s underlying, where people don&rsquo;t even know they&rsquo;re being obvious about it. You know, it&rsquo;s just a subconscious layer that&rsquo;s embedded from their entire core.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cover star: The Barbadian singer, songwriter, actress, and businesswoman poses in the durag for a high-fashion shoot captured by critically-acclaimed photographer Steven Klein</p>
<p>Rihanna explained that growing up in Barbados with her mother Monica, who was an immigrant from Guyana, the former British colony in South America, shaped her early experiences of racism.</p>
<p>Explaining that Guyanese immigrants were unpopular in Barbados when she was growing up, the star said &lsquo;that&rsquo;s why I really relate and empathise with Mexican people or Latino people, who are discriminated against in America.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know what it feels like to have the immigration come into your home in the middle of the night and drag people out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not my mother, my mother was legal,&rsquo; she clarified &lsquo;but let&rsquo;s just say I know what that fight looks like. I&rsquo;ve witnessed it. I&rsquo;ve been in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>London girl: Inside the magazine, Rihanna speaks to British broadcaster Afua Hirsch about her experience of living in the UK and the global racism she has witnessed</p>
<p>Rihanna has channelled her experiences both into music and lately her fashion and cosmetic lines, launching the sell-out brand Fenty Beauty in 2017.</p>
<p>Vogue explains that it was also the singer who came up with concept of wearing a durag on the cover, texting Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful in the early hours with her idea.</p>
<p>Enninful wrote in his editor&rsquo;s letter for the issue:&lsquo;Did I ever think that I would see a durag on the cover of Vogue? No reader, I did not&hellip;Yet here we have the most aspirational and beautiful durag. How exciting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It takes a person of extraordinary charisma to pull off such a moment.&rsquo;</p>

<h3 id="rihanna-makes-british-vogue-history-wearing-durag-on-cover">Rihanna makes British Vogue history wearing durag on cover</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/31/07/cover-v2-rgb.jpg" alt="img">
Rihanna has made British Vogue history by appearing on this month’s cover wearing a durag.</p>
<p>The singer is the publication’s first cover star to don the garment which editor Edward Enninful describes as a “potent symbol of black life” that is “rarely viewed through the prism of high fashion”.</p>
<p>“Did I ever imagine that I would see a durag on the cover of Vogue? No, reader, I did not,” Enninful wrote on Instagram.</p>
<p>“Here we have the most fabulous, aspirational and beautiful durag, worn by a woman who is breaking every boundary she comes up against. How exciting.”</p>
<p>The durag worn by Rihanna on the cover was designed by Stephen Jones, the acclaimed British milliner who last year celebrated his 40th anniversary working in the fashion industry.</p>
<p>Rihanna has worn a durag at several red carpet occasions, notably when she wore a Swarovski crystal-encrusted one that matched her Adam Selman dress at the CFDA Fashion Awards in 2014</p>
<p>In the interview, the singer opens up about wanting to have children, and reveals she would like “three or four” in 10 years time.</p>
<p>When asked whether she would have them on her own if she hadn’t met the right person, Rihanna replied: “Hell yeah, I feel like society makes me want to feel like ‘Oh you got it wrong …’ They diminish you as a mother, [if] there’s not a dad in your kid’s lives.</p>
<p>“But the only thing that matters is happiness, that’s the only healthy relationship between a parent and a child.</p>
<p>“That’s the only thing that can raise a child truly, is love.”</p>
