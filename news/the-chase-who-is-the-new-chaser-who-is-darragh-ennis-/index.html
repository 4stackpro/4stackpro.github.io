The Chase is a popular game show on ITV and it sees host Bradley Walsh walk a panel of contestants through a series of questions in a bid to win cash. The aim of the game is for the contestants to not get caught by the chaser, a professional quizzer who tries to stop them from winning the prize. A new chaser has just stepped up to try and stop the contestants in their tracks, and here is everything you need to know about Darragh Ennis.</p>
<p>Who is new chaser Darragh Ennis?</p>
<p>Fans may have seen the new chaser, Darragh Ennis, before as he was a former contestant on the game show back in 2017.</p>
<p>Following his performance, he was asked to join the rest of the chasers, and he will be the first new recruit to join since 2015.</p>
<p>Ennis tweeted about his new role, saying: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really excited to be the 6th chaser on #TheChase. I&rsquo;ve been working hard on this for a while now and can&rsquo;t wait for my episodes to air. Well, the ones I win anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Former contestant Mark Wallace welcomed him to the team. He said: &ldquo;Congratulations! As a former contestant, always been hugely impressed by the Chasers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plus @anne_hegerty was incredibly nice to us all even while trying to destroy us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Chase fans went into meltdown during today&rsquo;s episode as Mark Labbett suffered some serious blunders when answering questions.</p>
<p>Mark, 54, said he was having a &ldquo;shocker&rdquo; on tonight&rsquo;s show which saw him answer several questions incorrectly.</p>
<p>Viewers were stunned as The Beast is usually the one to beat, and tonight&rsquo;s players were giving him a run for their money that&rsquo;s for sure.</p>
<p>Fans flooded Twitter, fuming at Mark&rsquo;s performance.</p>
<p>One said: &ldquo;Mark given the runaround!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While another wrote: &ldquo;Mark isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;making mistakes&rsquo;. He&rsquo;s not knowing the right answers. A mistake is accidentally pressing the wrong button or something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Image: ITV)</p>
<p>Mark even reflected on his blunders during the episode, admitting: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m having what&rsquo;s known in the trade as a shocker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chase made headlines earlier this week after it was announced the show would have a sixth chaser join the team.</p>
<p>Former contestant Darragh Ennis has been revealed as the brand new chaser after appearing on the show back in 2017.</p>
<p>A source told the Mirror: &ldquo;Darragh has got what it takes to be a Chaser, he has been put to the test and passed with flying colours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t bring in new members on The Chase regularly so this is a big deal for the show and Darragh. Viewers will be very interested to see how he gets on.</p>
<p>(Image: ITV)</p>
<p>&ldquo;The show is so popular with spin off shows now as well so there is a need to increase the team. No one is leaving, Darragh is very much an addition to the team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mark Labbett, who is the chaser known as The Beast, hinted that Darragh may be joining the show later this year.</p>
<p>The media personality mentioned Darragh while responding to a fans question on Twitter.</p>
<p>(Image: ITV)</p>
<p>Mark wrote: &ldquo;Two weeks today Beat the Chasers on ITV all week at 9pm. We think you will like it #TheChase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Twitter user asked Mark: &ldquo;Any idea when the new episodes with the 6th chaser will be shown?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which Mark responded: &ldquo;Probably the autumn would be my guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chase continues tomorrow at 5pm on ITV

BACK BRITAIN&rsquo;S BRAVE NHS HEROES - CLICK HERE NOW The 2020 show of Strictly Come Dancing hangs in the balance of the government and whether or not the UK returns to normal in upcoming months following the current coronavirus pandemic. Professional dancers Janette Manrara and Aljaz Skorjanec are set to return this September should the next series be given the green light. However, Janette hinted she may leave the series when she opened up on family life with Aljaz.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, BBC announced which professionals would be returning to this year’s series. While the broadcaster, cast, crew and fans all hope to see the Strictly magic back on screens, it is yet to be officially confirmed. In the meantime, Janette and Aljaz joined This Morning presenters Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes via a live video link to talk about how they’re coping during the coronavirus lockdown. Ruth couldn’t help but ask Janette whether or not a ‘corona-baby’ could be the result of her and Aljiaz being stuck indoors together.

<p>Janette and Aljaz have been married for three years having met through the dancing community. Not only are they one another’s partners in dance competitions, they also have their own tour which has had to be postponed until next year. As for whether or not they are looking to start a family, the couple appeared on ITV’s Lorraine earlier this year and spoke about it. They told the host: “We talk about it all the time. We adore kids. DON&rsquo;T MISS&hellip;</p>

<p>“You should see us around babies, we get so broody, both of us. “[But] Especially as a woman, it&rsquo;s a big decision, for me whenever we do decide to have a child. “We are definitely going to have children,’ she confirmed. It seems the pair want a few more Strictly wins under their belts before they settle down.</p>
