The Last Temptation of Christ (1988): This is an offbeat film directed by Martin Scorsese. Willem Defoe plays a conflicted Jesus, who clashes with his friend Judas’ goal of staging a revolution against the Romans, his guilt over building crosses for the Romans and his desire to start a family with Mary Magdalene. Harvey Keitel plays Judas and Barbara Hershey was cast as Mary Magdalene. Predictably, the subject matter caused some controversy, particularly in Europe.

<h3 id="the-best-easter-movies-to-stream-this-bank-holiday-weekend">The best Easter movies to stream this bank holiday weekend</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.timeout.com/images/105634609/image.jpg" alt="img">
When it comes to movies, Easter definitely feels like Christmas’s poor relation. But while it may not have a canon to match all those Yuletide classics – and there’s definitely a preponderance of bunnies and Bible stories – there are a bunch of Good Friday goodies to enjoy. We’ve picked out a few for every taste to watch on Netflix, Amazon Prime and other spiritually-enhanced streaming sites.</p>
<p>Monty Python’s Life of Brian (1979)</p>
<p>Not wanting to offend the world’s bazillion Christians was the furthest thought from the Monty Python gang’s mind in this lol-rich departure from the gospel story. Instead of Jesus, we follow Brian (Graham Chapman), a young Jewish man who is hailed as the messiah, has a run-in with the People’s Front of Judea (and the Judean People’s Front), falls foul of the Romans, and finally ends up stuck up on a cross. It’s all a massive misunderstanding, because as his mum says: ‘He’s not the Messiah, he’s a very naughty boy.’ If you want to look on the bright side this weekend, look no further.</p>
<p>Available on Netflix, Amazon Prime, iTunes, YouTube, Google Play</p>
<p>The Long Good Friday (1980)</p>
<p>Never mind about whether ‘Die Hard’ is a Christmas movie, the real question is whether ‘The Long Good Friday’ is an Easter movie. And fackin’ right it is. Okay, Bob Hoskins’ cockney gangster Harold Shand lacks some of the verbal niceties of a proper messiah – you can’t really see Jesus growling: ‘The Romans? I’ve shit ’em!’ – but his efforts to bring the Olympics to east London do look weirdly prophetic with hindsight. And as chance would have it, this Brit crime classic isn’t just set over an Easter weekend, the first draft was written over one too.</p>
<p>Available on Amazon Prime, Google Play, YouTube, iTunes, Rakuten TV</p>
<p>The Last Temptation of Christ (1988)</p>
<p>Loved ‘The Irishman’? Try The Nazorean. This equally meaty Martin Scorsese-directed epic follows Willem Dafoe’s provocatively human Jesus. To pre-empt the inevitable controversy over his carnal Christ, Scorsese even stuck a disclaimer in the opening credits (‘This film is not based on the Gospels,’ it ran, ‘but upon the fictional exploration of the eternal spiritual conflict’), but it wasn’t enough to save him from an ungodly furore. Even Blockbuster refused to stock it, so you can only imagine what the Pope must have thought.</p>
<p>Available on Amazon Prime, iTunes, YouTube, Google Play, Rakuten TV</p>
<p>Peter Rabbit (2018)</p>
<p>If you only watch one family movie in which a talking rabbit tries to kill a farmer in cold blood, make it this jolly comedy. James Corden voices the no-nonsense bunny and Domhnall Gleeson plays his adversary, Mr McGregor. Leaving aside the much-complained-about bit where the hit-bunny hurls blackberries at the allergic farmer, it’s a cutesy caper that mostly sticks to the spirit of Beatrix Potter’s famous children’s books. Fluffy support is provided by Flopsy (Margot Robbie), Mopsy (Elizabeth Debicki) and Cotton-Tail (Daisy Ridley).</p>
<p>Available on Netflix, Amazon Prime, iTunes, Google Play, YouTube, Rakuten TV</p>
<p>The Gospel According to Matthew (1964)</p>
<p>If, under normal circumstances, your Easter weekend would have involved either a church or an art gallery, Pier Paolo Pasolini’s ascetic black-and-white vision of the life (and death) of Christ will help fill those gaps a little. The Italian director, who filmed this neorealist take on the gospel in southern Italy using non-professional actors, offers a vision of New Testament life with all the painterly qualities of a Renaissance masterpiece. Light a few votive candles, turn down the lights and get spiritual.</p>
<p>Available from Amazon Prime, YouTube, Google Play, iTunes</p>
<p>Easter Parade (1948)</p>
<p>Judy Garland, Fred Astaire, a bunch of Irving Berlin bangers and a whole mess of MGM razzmatazz… this roaring ’40s musical is a proper visual workout. (Think: Joe Wicks, only for your eyeballs.) The story of a lovelorn Broadway song-and-dance man (Astaire) who goes looking for a new protégée and finds her in Judy Garland’s dancer. Cue great songs and guaranteed uplift.</p>
<p>Available on Amazon Prime, iTunes, Google Play, YouTube</p>
<p>Hop (2011)</p>
<p>This rambunctious crossbreed of live action and animation requires you not to think too hard about, well, anything, but if you can go with its floppy-eared charms it’ll keep your blood sugar levels up for 90 minutes. It comes from the studio that gave us the Minions and it features the same secret sauce of silliness and pratfalls that kids will be powerless to resist. Russell Brand voices EB, the heir to the Easter bunny crown, who, to the chagrin of his dad (Hugh Laurie), heads to Hollywood to pursue his dream of becoming a drummer – the rascal. James Marsden plays his human pal and there’s a bonus appearance from the Hoff.</p>
<p>Available on Amazon Prime, iTunes, Google Play, YouTube, Rakuten TV</p>
<p>Looking for a movie to make the whole family happy? Here’s what to stream if you’re self-isolating with kids.</p>
<p>Lockdown watch list: Gemma Arterton shares what she’s streaming while stuck indoors.

Easter films for kids: best children&rsquo;s movies to watch over the April bank holiday weekend on Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+</p>
<p>Easter&rsquo;s here, and the kids are off school (and have been for a while)</p>

<p>The sun is shining, but this year you&rsquo;re not allowed to go outside. So what to do?</p>
<p>One surefire way to keep the kids entertained is to stick on a film, and with more streaming services and choice than ever, there are plenty of great Easter movies to try.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve rounded up some of the best below, which should see you through until Easter Monday very nicely indeed.</p>

<p>Bambi</p>
<p>Disney+</p>
<p>With the recent launch of Disney+, the House of Mouse&rsquo;s animated classics are now easily available.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no better classic to sit down with this Easter weekend than Bambi, the timeless tale of wide-eyed fawn coming of age in a world fraught with unseen dangers.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s joined of course by playful rabbit pal Thumper, perfect for some seasonal relevancy.</p>
<p>Chicken Little</p>
<p>Disney+ and NowTV</p>
<p>Chicken Little may not be as fondly remember as other poultry-based pictures.</p>
<p>But this story of a courageous chicken who must come to the rescue of his fellow citizens when aliens start an invasion will keep the little ones entertained this weekend.</p>
<p>Chicken Run</p>
<p>Amazon Prime</p>
<p>Aardman&rsquo;s classic set on a Yorkshire chicken farm follows the turbulent romance between Rocky the Rooster and Ginger the chicken, who both yearn for freedom and are planning a daring &ldquo;prisoner of war&rdquo; style escape.</p>
<p>Best not to think about the fact this film is 20 years old this year&hellip;</p>
<p>Ice Age: The Great Egg-Scapade</p>
<p>Disney+</p>
<p>This spin-off from the Ice Age films follows Sid the Sloth as he takes a job as an egg nanny.</p>
<p>Unaware an old enemy has plans of his own, the shenanigans lead to the first egg hunt and creation of popular Easter traditions.</p>
<p>Life of Brian</p>
<p>Netflix</p>
<p>Perhaps not as child friendly as other suggestions on this list (though it&rsquo;s rated &lsquo;12A&rsquo; by the BBFC), Monty Python&rsquo;s classic follows Brian of Nazareth as he spends his life being mistaken for a messiah.</p>
<p>An irreverent link to Easter perhaps, but a comedy classic that&rsquo;s bound to have you grinning from ear to ear.</p>
<p>Mary Poppins</p>
<p>Disney+ and NowTV</p>
<p>Another classic now available through Disney+, Mary Poppins might not be the most Easter-centric of films.</p>
<p>But for all of its feel-good charm and toe-tapping musical numbers, there&rsquo;s never been a better time to put a spring in your step.</p>
<p>2018&rsquo;s sequel is also available on NowTV and Disney+.</p>
<p>Peter Rabbit</p>
<p>iPlayer and Netflix</p>
<p>The sequel may have been indefinitely delayed due to coronavirus, but 2018&rsquo;s original is available both on Netflix, and for free on iPlayer.</p>
<p>The James Corden-voiced film retells Beatrix Potter&rsquo;s classic tale of a rebellious rabbit trying to sneak into a farmer&rsquo;s vegetable garden.</p>
<p>Rise of the Guardians</p>
<p>Netflix</p>
<p>When the evil spirit Pitch launches an assault on Earth, the Immortal Guardians team up to protect the innocence of children all around the world.</p>
<p>Not very Easter-y you might think, but that team includes Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy&hellip; and the Easter Bunny.</p>
<p>Zootropolis</p>
<p>Disney+
