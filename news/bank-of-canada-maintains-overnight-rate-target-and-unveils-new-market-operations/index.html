The Bank of Canada today maintained its target for the overnight rate at ¼ percent, which the Bank considers its effective lower bound. The Bank Rate is correspondingly ½ percent and the deposit rate is ¼ percent. The Bank also announced new measures to provide additional support to Canada’s financial system.</p>
<p>The necessary efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic have caused a sudden and deep contraction in economic activity and employment worldwide. In financial markets, this has driven a flight to safety and a sharp repricing of a wide range of assets. It has also pushed down prices for commodities, especially oil. In this environment, the Canadian dollar has depreciated since January, although by less than many other currencies. The sudden halt in global activity will be followed by regional recoveries at different times, depending on the duration and severity of the outbreak in each region. This means that the global economic recovery, when it comes, could be protracted and uneven.</p>
<p>The Canadian economy was in a solid position ahead of the COVID-19 outbreak, but has since been hit by widespread shutdowns and lower oil prices. One early measure of the extent of the damage was an unprecedented drop in employment in March, with more than one million jobs lost across Canada. Many more workers reported shorter hours, and by early April some six million Canadians had applied for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.</p>
<p>The outlook is too uncertain at this point to provide a complete forecast. However, Bank analysis of alternative scenarios suggests the level of real activity was down 1-3 percent in the first quarter of 2020, and will be 15-30 percent lower in the second quarter than in fourth-quarter 2019. CPI inflation is expected to be close to 0 percent in the second quarter of 2020. This is primarily due to the transitory effects of lower gasoline prices.</p>
<p>The pandemic-driven contraction has prompted decisive policy action to support individuals and businesses and to lay the foundation for economic recovery once containment measures start to ease. Fiscal programs, designed to expand according to the magnitude of the shock, will help individuals and businesses weather this shutdown phase of the pandemic, and support incomes and confidence leading into the recovery. These programs have been complemented by actions taken by other federal agencies and provincial governments.</p>
<p>For its part, the Bank of Canada has taken measures to improve market function so that monetary policy actions have their intended effect on the economy. This helps ensure that households and businesses continue to have access to the credit they need to bridge this difficult time, and that lower interest rates find their way to ultimate borrowers. The Bank has lowered its target for the overnight rate 150 basis points over the last three weeks, to its effective lower bound. It has also conducted lending operations to financial institutions and asset purchases in core funding markets amounting to around $200 billion.</p>
<p>These actions have served to ease market dysfunction and help keep credit channels open, although they remain strained. The next challenge for markets will be managing increased demand for near-term financing by federal and provincial governments, and businesses and households. The situation calls for special actions by the central bank. To this end, the Bank is furthering its efforts with several important steps.</p>
<p>Under its previously-announced program, the Bank will continue to purchase at least $5 billion in Government of Canada securities per week in the secondary market, and will increase the level of purchases as required to maintain proper functioning of the government bond market. Also, the Bank is temporarily increasing the amount of Treasury Bills it acquires at auctions to up to 40 percent, effective immediately.</p>
<p>The Bank is also announcing today the development of a new Provincial Bond Purchase Program of up to $50 billion, to supplement its Provincial Money Market Purchase Program. Further, the Bank is announcing a new Corporate Bond Purchase Program, in which the Bank will acquire up to a total of $10 billion in investment grade corporate bonds in the secondary market. Both of these programs will be put in place in the coming weeks. Finally, the Bank is further enhancing its term repo facility to permit funding for up to 24 months.</p>
<p>These measures will work in combination to ease pressure on Canadian borrowers. As containment restrictions are eased and economic activity resumes, fiscal and monetary policy actions will help underpin confidence and stimulate spending by consumers and businesses to restore growth. The Bank’s Governing Council stands ready to adjust the scale or duration of its programs if necessary. All the Bank’s actions are aimed at helping to bridge the current period of containment and create the conditions for a sustainable recovery and achievement of the inflation target over time.</p>
<p>Information note</p>
<p>The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is June 3, 2020. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR on July 15, 2020.

<p><img src="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/BoC-Twitter_BG_900A.jpg" alt="img">
Good morning. Senior Deputy Governor Wilkins and I are glad to have the opportunity to answer your questions about today’s policy announcement and Monetary Policy Report (MPR). Allow me to begin with a few comments.</p>
<p>The Canadian economy is experiencing a significant and rapid contraction. The shock is a global one, affecting all countries, but commodity-producing countries like Canada are being hit twice. In the very near term, policy-makers can do little more than cushion the blow.</p>
<p>It is worth spending a moment to emphasize why the central bank’s inflation targets matter so much, even at a time such as this. Inflation targets were put in place around the world when the dominant worry was higher inflation. Today, the situation is very complex. However, Governing Council agreed that the balance of forces points to weaker demand and a decline in inflation as the dominant concern. Inflation targets provide an anchor for the economy—particularly inflation expectations—and a guide for policy actions equally in today’s situation. Keeping inflation close to target means taking measures to ensure that the economy stabilizes and then returns to full capacity. Failing to do so now would mean that inflation would persistently fall short of target.</p>
<p>If inflation were to fall short of target for an extended period, faith in that anchor would be eroded, and policy-makers would face even greater challenges in returning the economy to full capacity. This challenge can become particularly acute should inflation fall persistently below zero. Sub-zero inflation, or deflation, would interact with existing indebtedness in a particularly undesirable way. Specifically, negative inflation would increase the real value of outstanding debts while it would erode the ability of companies and households to service their debt—a very difficult mix for the financial system.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the risk of sustained deflation in Canada is low, for several reasons. First, there has been a vigorous and elastic response from governments to the pandemic. These actions will put a floor under the economy and lay the foundation for the subsequent recovery. This is especially true for wage subsidies, which are designed to maintain the employee-employer relationship, thereby buttressing confidence and facilitating the recovery. Second, Canada began the pandemic episode with the economy operating near potential and inflation around its 2 percent target. Just as a healthy, fit individual is more likely to shake off a COVID-19 infection, a healthy economy is more likely to recover quickly from a major negative shock. Third, Canada has enjoyed considerable success in keeping inflation close to target for more than 25 years. This means that investors, firms and households expect that the Bank will act to help return the economy to capacity and bring about stable, 2 percent inflation. The Bank’s recent actions should be seen in exactly that light.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Governing Council lowered our policy interest rate three times to 0.25 percent, which we consider to be its effective lower bound. These moves were based on analysis of the factors we could measure immediately—mainly the likely fallout on the economy from the collapse in oil prices, as well as the immediate effects of measures to contain the novel coronavirus. This preliminary analysis indicated that cutting rates all the way to the effective lower bound was the best contribution the Bank could make to stabilizing the economy and complementing the government’s efforts.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the outlook is highly conditional on how long the containment measures remain in place, and how households and firms adapt. Governing Council agreed that it would be false precision to offer its usual specific forecast. Instead, we chose to offer two plausible illustrative scenarios for the economy—one should be thought of as a “best case” given where we find ourselves today, while the other is a much more severe scenario. Many possible outcomes lie between these scenarios, but based on the Bank’s new analysis, Governing Council concluded that substantial monetary stimulus needed to be in place to lay the foundation for the post-containment economic recovery.</p>
<p>For the Bank’s policy actions to reach companies and households and foster a robust recovery, it is crucial that financial markets function well. In the past few days, Governing Council’s deliberations focused mainly on what additional actions the Bank could take to achieve this goal. There has been some improvement in market functioning. But important strains continue, and Governing Council acknowledged that near-term borrowing requirements of governments and the private sector are likely to pose further challenges. We decided to increase the Bank’s participation in the government’s treasury bill auctions to 40 percent of each new issue, and to underscore that our program of purchasing at least $5 billion per week of Government of Canada bonds in the secondary market could be increased at any time, should market conditions warrant it. A similar argument applies to provincial government bond markets, which are seeing significant strains—hence our decision to supplement our program to buy provincial money market securities by also buying up to $50 billion in provincial bonds.</p>
<p>Governing Council also noted that the corporate bond market continues to show signs of stress, although our program to purchase commercial paper has helped. Governing Council reasoned that the Bank’s presence in the secondary corporate bond market would ease some of these strains and announced a $10 billion purchase program aimed at high-quality corporate borrowers. In addition, Canada’s major banks face relatively high longer-term funding costs in the corporate bond market, a factor that is leading to upward pressure on some longer-term mortgage rates, despite the 150-basis-point drop in our policy rate. For this reason, Governing Council decided to lengthen the term of its weekly repo operations to allow for funding for up to 24 months. This should lead to improved funding conditions for the major banks and therefore help companies and households benefit more from monetary stimulus.</p>
<p>The Bank has so far accumulated over $200 billion of new assets—amounting to about 10 percent of Canada’s GDP in liquidity support for the economy—and the Bank’s balance sheet has expanded by about this amount as a consequence. This is natural at a time when financial market participants and firms seek to increase their levels of liquidity because it is the central bank’s job to fulfill those needs. If we failed to do our job, increased liquidity demands could instead lead to a contraction of credit availability, with obvious consequences for individuals and the economy. When financial tensions ease as the pandemic runs its course, these extra liquidity demands will dissipate, and the Bank’s balance sheet expansion can reverse over time.</p>
<p>The Bank stands ready to augment the scale of any of its programs should market conditions warrant it. Governing Council agreed that the combination of aggressive fiscal action and monetary stimulus will create the best possible foundation for the recovery period.</p>
<p>Before concluding, let me point out that this MPR is unique in one other respect. This is the 25th anniversary of the first MPR, published under Governor Gordon Thiessen’s leadership in May 1995. We have marked this event by using the same front page as 25 years ago. Ironically, I was one of the architects of that first MPR, and today’s will be my last. I wish the circumstances were more favourable.</p>
<p>With that, Senior Deputy Governor Wilkins and I will now be happy to take your questions.
