<p>Editor’s Note: ARTnews has issued an apology to the family of Rebeccah Blum regretting that the original version of this article covering the shocking news of Blum’s murder hadn’t been more respectful of her and her many accomplishments. Read a separate obituary of Blum, published on July 29, 2020, here.</p>
<p>Saul Fletcher, a British-born, Berlin-based artist, is the subject of an investigation “on the suspicion of murder” of Rebeccah Blum, a well-regarded Berlin-based curator who was found dead last week before Fletcher reportedly committed suicide. Blum’s death was confirmed this week by her daughter, Emma Blum.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to ARTnews, a spokesperson for the Berlin Public Prosecutor’s Office confirmed the news. The statement added, “According to the present state of knowledge, [Fletcher] first killed the woman you named [Rebeccah Blum] and then committed suicide. Investigations into the causes of death and the circumstances of the crime are still ongoing.”</p>
<p>The spokesperson did not provide further details about the investigation, including those that have been circulating in the press surrounding the story, which was first reported by the Daily Mail.</p>
<p>Rebeccah Blum, who was in a romantic relationship with Fletcher, was a well-regarded independent curator in Berlin. She had previously worked as director at ScheiblerMitte, an outpost of Berlin’s Aurel Scheibler gallery. She also ran a fine art management services, Blum Fine Art Management, and an editing service focused on German-to-English translation, Wordsmith. She also worked for over 10 years as the European representative for David Nolan Gallery in New York. Read a full obituary for Blum.</p>
<p>“I love her so much and I miss her so terribly,” Emma Blum, her daughter, wrote on Instagram. “She was just by taken from me, without warning and in such a violent way by one of the people she loved. I can never forgive this and I can never forget this. I want her name to be remembered and nobody else’s.”</p>
<p>The three galleries that represented Fletcher at the time of his death—Anton Kern Gallery in New York, Knust Kunz Gallery Editions in Munich, and Grice Bench in Los Angeles—provided to ARTnews a joint statement regarding the reports: “We are devastated, appalled, and shocked by the tragic loss of Rebeccah Blum and Saul Fletcher. We are all grief-stricken and confused. We offer our deepest condolences to their families and together are offering our support and help.”</p>
<p>Fletcher first came to prominence in the late 1990s when he began showing with New York’s Anton Kern Gallery. His work has appeared in major international exhibitions as well, including the 30th Bienal de São Paulo in 2012, the 4th Berlin Biennale in 2006, and the 2004 Carnegie International in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Update, July 30, 2020: This article has been updated to include a statement from the Berlin Public Prosecutor’s Office confirming that Saul Fletcher is a suspect in the investigation into Rebeccah Blum’s murder.

<p>Rebeccah Blum, a noted arts curator, and Saul Fletcher, a British photographer, have died in Berlin. Although it has not yet been officially verified, multiple media sources reported Blum, 53, was murdered by Fletcher, 52, at his Berlin flat. He is believed to have subsequently committed suicide at Blum’s country home in Brandenburg, west of Berlin. Their bodies were discovered on 22 July.</p>
<p>Fletcher, whose friends say suffered from serious mental health issues, and Blum had been in an on-off relationship for many years. Berlin authorities confirmed that they are not seeking anyone else in conjunction with the case, and Blum&rsquo;s daughter confirmed her mother&rsquo;s death on social media.</p>
<p>Blum, the mother of two children, was born in 1967 and was raised close to Philadelphia. She studied art history in Washington DC before moving to San Francisco to work in an art gallery, supporting herself with restaurant work.</p>
<p>Blum moved to the German city of Düsseldorf in 1992, at the age of 25, before settling in Berlin in 1995, where she co-founded the non-profit arts organisation Base e.V. and the independent publishing platform txt.de. Blum became a director of the ScheiblerMitte gallery Aurel Scheibler in 2007 before founding her own art management firm, Blum Fine Art Management. As a freelancer, she supported the Berlin office of publisher Verlag der Kunst amid countless other projects.</p>
<p>The Berlin-based Mexican artist Julieta Aranda, a friend and colleague, says in an Instagram post that she pays tribute to Blum on behalf of the Berlin artistic community. Aranda remembers “a woman with a name, a profession, a rich life and a precious smile that we want to share with everyone. We are here to express our condolences and sorrow, to pay respect to her achievements and to honour her memory, as the brilliant woman she was and as a dear friend for many. We want to recall her name, and firmly condemn the brutality that took her life away, a too well known violence that needs to stop.”</p>
<p>Emma Blum, 22, one of Rebeccah’s two daughters, used Instagram to remember a committed mother, a ceaselessly inventive cook and an adventurous and enthusiastic lover of life “who supported me through every crisis, who raised me and loved me unconditionally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love her so much and I miss her so terribly,” Blum’s daughter wrote. “She was just taken from me, without warning and in such a violent way by one of the people she loved. I can never forgive this and I can never forget this. I want her name to be remembered and nobody else’s.”</p>
<p>Fletcher was born in 1967 to a working class family in the village of Barton-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire, and spent his early adulthood ferrying coal on cargo ships in Hull harbour. His earliest photographs, made after he joined an amateur photography club, were of North Lincolnshire&rsquo;s docks.</p>
<p>After moving to London in the early 1990s, he set up a makeshift studio in Crouch End and began to explore a form of carefully constructed portraiture, of himself and others. He supported himself by assisting the photographer Juergen Teller.</p>
<p>Fletcher moved to Berlin around the turn of the millennium. Those close to him remembered a warm but erratic man who often seemed happy and content but, at the depths of depression, would rarely leave the confines of his home or studio, where much of his work was created.</p>
<p>Most of his photographs used the walls of his studio as a canvas or backdrop for self-portraits. He would arrange found objects, vegetation, dead animals, Polaroids, paintings, drawings or pages torn from his notebooks, before photographing the composition, or himself in the midst of the composition, with an obsessive repetition.</p>
<p>After gaining representation from New York’s Anton Kern Gallery, Fletcher gained critical recognition for shows at London’s Courtauld Gallery; the Atlanta Contemporary Art Center; the Hessel Museum of Art, New York; MUMOK, Vienna; and the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, among others. He gained some populist fame for his visual work for the London-based alt rock band Placebo and, recently, a friendship with the actor Brad Pitt.</p>
<p>Fletcher’s last solo exhibition, titled Four Loom Weave, went on show at Anton Kern Gallery, New York, in Autumn 2018. Fletcher told the Financial Times at the time: &ldquo;I use whatever I have to hand, trying to create something, trying to make something good out of something bad.”</p>
<p>Fletcher’s most recent artwork, titled Don’t Let the Darkness Get You Down, is part of the exhibition Untitled 2020 on show at Punta della Dogana, Venice, until 13 December 2020.

<h3 id="rebeccah-blum-well-regarded-berlin-based-independent-curator-is-dead">&ldquo;Rebeccah Blum, Well-Regarded Berlin-Based Independent Curator, Is Dead&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Rebeccah-Blum.jpg?w=1024" alt="img">
Rebeccah Blum, an independent curator based in Berlin who ran a namesake art management firm, has died. The news was confirmed by her daughter Emma Blum in an Instagram post.</p>
<p>In her Instagram post, Emma Blum wrote, “I want to take a moment to talk about my mom. Rebeccah. The person who supported me through every crisis, who raised me and loved me unconditionally. The amazing cook, who could open the fridge and magically make a dish out of something nobody would ever expect to taste good. Who, when she told a story, would sometimes get up, gesturing all over the place, so animated and excited in what she had to tell. I miss her silly ways and the conversations we had in the evening while cooking together. She taught me card tricks and games, took me to the forest to go mushroom hunting.”</p>
<p>Emma Blum’s post continued, “I love her so much and I miss her so terribly. She was just by taken from me, without warning and in such a violent way by one of the people she loved. I can never forgive this and I can never forget this. I want her name to be remembered and nobody else’s.”</p>
<p>Rebeccah Blum was found dead last week. Several media outlets reported the death as a murder-suicide committed by British-born photographer Saul Fletcher. In a statement sent to ARTnews, a spokesperson for the Berlin Public Prosecutor’s Office confirmed the news. The statement added, “According to the present state of knowledge, [Fletcher] first killed the woman you named [Rebeccah Blum] and then committed suicide. Investigations into the causes of death and the circumstances of the crime are still ongoing.”</p>
<p>Rebeccah Blum was well-known in the Berlin art scene. Prior to starting her Berlin-based firm, Blum Fine Art Management, she had been a director at ScheiblerMitte gallery in Berlin (an adjunct exhibition space of Aurel Scheibler in the downtown area of the German capital), joining the enterprise when it opened its space in the city in 2006. Among the exhibitions mounted at ScheiblerMitte, which staged its last presentation in 2011, were solo shows of work by Joe Zucker, Anthony Goicolea, and Michel Auder. Oftentimes, the exhibitions were the artists’ first in Berlin. She also worked on the gallery’s production of its exhibition catalogues and contributed texts on the work of Ad Reinhardt, Alice Neel, and others.</p>
<p>Among Blum’s curatorial credits at ScheiblerMitte was a 2009 group exhibition titled “Shadow/Existence” that Blum organized with Jennifer Bork. The show included work by Jonathan Bragdon, Tom Chamberlain, Öyvind Fahlström, Neil Gall, Nico Glaenzel, Mark Lombardi, Alexander Schellow, David Schutter, Jorinde Voigt, and Michael Wutz.</p>
<p>In the press release to the “Shadow/Existence,” Blum and Bork wrote, “[Chaos and order] alternate rhythmically yet form a whole that refers to the ambivalence of all that is. ‘Shadow/Existence’ addresses this ambivalence in its notion of presence and absence. Oneʼs own shadow cannot exist alone but requires a source of light and an object. It is not representational and not present yet carries the trace of presence within.”</p>
<p>Blum also operated Wordsmith, an editing service focused on German-to-English translation and the production of texts in those two languages. According to the company’s website, clients included the Goethe Institute, Satellite Berlin, the Vitra Design Museum, and the publisher Hatje Cantz, for which she translated some of the essays for an exhibition catalogue of Stephan von Huene.</p>
<p>Blum also worked as the European representative for New York’s David Nolan Gallery for over 10 years. During her tenure at David Nolan, she helped coordinate exhibitions with the gallery’s Europe-based artists at the New York location and worked in the gallery’s art fair booths.</p>
<p>In an email to ARTnews, the gallery’s owner, David Nolan, said, “Rebeccah excelled at explaining art to clients and curators. She was a great communicator and a very warm person that always put the artists and clients at ease. I could trust her totally to choose works from an artist’s studio and make studio visits and liaise for me with dealers and others in our complicated contemporary art world.”</p>
<p>Nolan said that one of the artists whom Blum introduced him to was Berlin-based artist Jorinde Voigt, whom he first met in 2009 and has represented for around 10 years. Nolan subsequently included Voigt in the gallery’s summer exhibition in 2010 and has since mounted six solo shows of Voigt’s work, including one this past spring.</p>
<p>Nolan added, “I will remember her for her honesty, humor, and intelligence. A lovely person who was the most loyal friend one can be fortunate enough to know.”</p>
<p>Update, 7/30/20 2:05 p.m.: This article has been updated to include confirmation from the Berlin Public Prosecutor’s Office that Blum is believed to have been murdered by artist Saul Fletcher.

Art Industry News is a daily digest of the most consequential developments coming out of the art world and art market. Here’s what you need to know on this Tuesday, July 28.</p>
<p>NEED-TO-READ</p>
<p>Artist Saul Fletcher and Curator Rebeccah Blum Die in Apparent Murder-Suicide – The Berlin-based artist and freelance curator died last week in an apparent murder-suicide. According to local media, Fletcher’s daughter called police to report that he had confessed to the murder of a woman who is believed to be curator and former Aurel Scheibler director Rebeccah Blum. (Blum’s identity has not been confirmed by law enforcement, but was affirmed by Fletcher’s galleries.) Fletcher was later found dead on his property just outside Berlin. He was represented by Anton Kern, Grice Bench in Los Angeles, and Knust Kunz Gallery in Munich at the time of his death. (ARTnews)</p>
<p>Debate Erupts Online Over the Met’s Labeling of a Religious Artifact – The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York posted what it described as “a sixth-century amulet from Egypt” on Twitter over the weekend. But some followers say it is in fact a piece of tefillin, the leather boxes and straps used in Jewish prayer, and are asking for a correction. The debate has sparked conversation about how museums catalogue religious objects; the Met has not yet commented on the matter. (Jewish Telegraphic Agency)</p>
<p>A Report Says the Trade of Illicit Antiquities Has Been Overstated – A new report from the American research organization RAND suggests that the actual size of the trade in illicit antiquities may be “much smaller” than widely believed. Perhaps more controversially, the report blames “bloggers, journalists and advocacy groups” who pen sensational headlines for perpetuating the distortion. ln a recent op-ed on Artnet News, antique trade organization head Erika Bochereau argued that a recent study into the illicit trade of antiquities in Germany was based more on suspicion rather than scientific research. (The Art Newspaper)</p>
<p>French Photographers Petition Macron for Relief Measures – More than 400 photographers and photojournalists have signed an open letter urging French president Emmanuel Macron to launch specific measures to aid the sector in the wake of a speech in May in which he pledged to inaugurate a major program of public commissions. The signatories are calling for a kind of “photographic new deal” to employ photographers to document France during this historic moment. (TAN)</p>
<p>ART MARKET</p>
<p>Uccello Painting Sold Under Duress Heads to Sotheby’s – A work by Italian Renaissance artist Paolo Uccello is heading to Sotheby’s “From Rembrandt to Richter” sale with an estimate of £600,000 and £800,000. Battle on the Banks of a River belonged to the Jewish collector Friedrich Gutmann, who died in a concentration camp in 1944. The profits of the sale will be split, as per an agreement, between Gutmann’s heirs and the new owners of the painting, who bought it unaware of its dark past. (Guardian)</p>
<p>Phillips’s Editions Sale Nets $5.4 Million – Phillips’s editions and works on paper sale raked in $5.4 million across 232 lots. The top seller was Pablo Picasso’s Portrait de jeune fille, d’après Cranach le Jeune (Portrait of a Young Woman, After Cranach the Younger), which sold for $590,000 after a competition among four bidders. (Art Market Monitor)</p>
<p>Eva Chimento Closes Her Gallery – Los Angeles’s Chimento Contemporary will close after five years in business and 45 exhibitions. Owner Eva Chimento will join Telluride Gallery of Fine Art in Colorado as director. (Press release)</p>
<p>COMINGS &amp; GOINGS</p>
<p>Virgil Abloh and Mercedes-Benz Hatch an Art Project – The omnipresent artist and designer is working with the car company to create a new art-inspired automobile. Called “Project Geländewagen,” the reinterpretation of Mercedes’s G-Class model will be unveiled on September 8. A one-of-a-kind model replica will also be auctioned off to raise funds for an arts charity. (Hypebeast)</p>
<p>ICA Miami Expands Research Initiatives – The Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami is expanding its research department thanks to a $2 million grant from the Knight Foundation back in 2018. The renamed Knight Foundation Art + Research Center is in the midst of developing a new online platform for digital scholarship and an academic partnership with the University of Miami’s Africana Studies program. (Press release)</p>
<p>Artes Mundi Prize Postponed to 2021 – The UK’s biggest art prize, the £40,000 ($51,544) Artes Mundi award, has been pushed back to next spring. The biannual prize and exhibition was initially slated to launch in October, but will now be held from February 3 through June 6 across three venues in Cardiff, Wales. (The Art Newspaper)</p>
<p>FOR ART’S SAKE</p>
<p>Police Confiscate Roman Vases Found in Seafood Shop – Spanish authorities have seized 13 Roman amphorae from a seafood shop in Alicante. The owner’s son claims that he found the vessels on fishing trips and was using them to decorate the store. An investigation of both men is underway; if the objects are confirmed to have been looted from shipwrecks, they could be charged with “crimes against historical heritage.” (Smithsonian)</p>
<p>Magnum Launches Print Sale to Benefit the NAACP – Magnum Photos is holding a print sale of more than 100 archival photographs to raise money for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

<h3 id="plo-official-laments-sudans-desire-for-deal-with-israel">&ldquo;PLO official laments Sudan’s desire for deal with Israel&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2020/02/AP_19229473479104-e1580767346189-1024x640.jpg" alt="img">
WASHINGTON — The Senate intelligence committee concludes that the Kremlin launched an aggressive effort to meddle in the 2016 US presidential contest on behalf of Donald Trump, as the Republican-led panel releases its fifth and final report in its investigation into election interference.</p>
<p>The Senate panel describes its report, totaling more than 1,300 pages, as “the most comprehensive description to date of Russia’s activities and the threat they posed.” The bipartisan investigation lasted almost three and a half years, much longer than the other probes.</p>
<p>The report purposely doesn’t come to a final conclusion, as the other reports did, about whether there is enough evidence that Trump’s campaign coordinated or colluded with Russia to sway the election to him and away from Democrat Hillary Clinton, leaving its findings open to partisan interpretation.</p>
<p>A group of Republicans on the panel submitted “additional views” to the report saying that it should state more explicitly that Trump’s campaign did not coordinate with Russia. But Democrats on the panel submitted their own views, arguing that the report clearly shows such cooperation.</p>
<p>Former special counsel Robert Mueller concluded in a report issued last year that Russia interfered in the election through hacking and a covert social media campaign and that the Trump campaign embraced the help and expected to benefit from it. But Mueller did not charge any Trump associates with conspiring with Russians.</p>
<p>The Senate investigation also delves into areas of great interest to Trump that were not explored by Mueller. Those include the FBI’s reliance on a dossier of opposition research compiled by a former British spy whose work was financed by Democrats.</p>
<p>Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, the committee’s acting chairman, says in a statement that the committee was troubled that the FBI had been willing to use the dossier “without verifying its methodology or sourcing” as it applied for secret surveillance warrants against a former Trump campaign adviser.</p>

<h3 id="when-is-the-matrix-4s-release-date-cast-plot-and-trailer">&ldquo;When is The Matrix 4’s release date? Cast, plot and trailer&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2019/08/Keanu-Reeves-5939c06.jpg?quality=45&amp;resize=620,413" alt="img">
It seems as though reboots, remakes and long-awaited sequels are having a moment right now, from the upcoming live-action Mulan and Bill and Ted 3, to Top Gun: Maverick and The Batman.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Joining that list of exciting titles is The Matrix, with Keanu Reeves reprising his seminal role of Neo for the franchise’s fourth film, set for release almost 20 years since the virtual reality system graced our screens.</p>
<p>While COVID-19 initially slowed down production on the sequel, Reeves recently confirmed that filming has restarted in Belgium – so hopefully we won’t be waiting too long to see our favourite rebels reunited once more.</p>
<p>Co-creator Lana Wachowski is back to direct the next chapter in the high-concept sci-fi series, with a selection of returning stars and exciting fresh faces in tow.</p>
<p>Here’s everything we know so far about The Matrix 4.</p>
<p>When is The Matrix 4’s release date?</p>
<p>The Matrix 4 was originally scheduled for release on 21st May 2021, but due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, this date was pushed back in July to Friday 1st April 2022.</p>
<p>The pandemic caused production on the new instalment to be halted over safety concerns, placing it behind schedule along with several other major projects, so it’s possible the movie could arrive later than expected.</p>
<p>However, Keanu Reeves recently confirmed that cast and crew restarted filming this summer, telling The Associated Press in August: “There’s some really thoughtful, effective protocols in place and the rhythm of film making has not really been impacted or interrupted.”</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re scrappy!&rdquo; Keanu Reeves returned to playing Neo this summer on the Berlin set of &ldquo;The Matrix 4.&rdquo; He says producers have &ldquo;thoughtful, effective protocols in place&rdquo; to keep cast and crew safe. Reeves spoke while promoting @BillandTed3. pic.twitter.com/RtTsLOsyGP — AP Entertainment (@APEntertainment) August 16, 2020</p>
<p>He continued: “I think everyone loves the project and if you’re ever going to get into any kind of situation that needs to be figured out or how to redo this, show business people are the back. We’re scrappy, we know how to get stuff done, we’re inventive, we think on our feet – that kind of kindred spirit of just coming together.”</p>
<p>Giving some insight into life on set in Berlin at the moment, he said: “It goes back to, ‘Let’s put on a show! We’ll get some props, we’ve got somethings, we’re gonna write’ – and that spirit is definitely alive and well on The Matrix.”</p>
<p>With production up-and-running, hopefully The Matrix’s fourth instalment wont see any further delays.</p>
<p>Who is in the cast of The Matrix 4?</p>
<p>Original series leads Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss will be back as doomed lovers Neo and Trinity, but its unclear what the circumstances of their return will be after the shocking events of 2003’s The Matrix Revolutions.</p>
<p>Jada Pinkett Smith (Gotham) will also be back, reprising the role of Logos captain Niobe, which she previously played in the second and third Matrix films.</p>
<p>Rising star Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who has become a DC Comics icon across roles in Aquaman and Watchmen, has reportedly landed a leading role in the film.</p>
<p>Some fans have speculated he could be playing a younger version of Morpheus, in the absence of Laurence Fishburne, but his role is yet to be confirmed and will probably remain under wraps for some time.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Iron Fist and Defenders star Jessica Henwick has also joined The Matrix 4 after impressing director Lana Wachowski in her audition – with Deadline reporting she could be up for another, Neo-styled role.</p>
<p>How I Met Your Mother’s Neil Patrick Harris has also signed on to join the project, along with Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Toby Onwumere, who is reuniting with Wachowski after their collaboration on Netflix original series Sense8.</p>
<p>Hugo Weaving’s long-running character Agent Smith (the central villain in the original trilogy) will not be making a reappearance in the sequel, as the actor revealed that a scheduling clash had prevented him from taking part in the project.</p>
<p>“We’d sorted the dates and then she [director Lana Wachowski] sort of changed her mind,” he told Time Out. “They’re pushing on ahead without me.”</p>
<p>What is The Matrix 4 about?</p>
<p>No plot information has been released as yet, so we’re left to wildly speculate. Either Neo survived the conclusion to The Matrix Revolutions, which saw him murder-suicide big bad Agent Smith, or he’s set for a Jesus-like resurrection. The latter would fit with the Messiah metaphor that pervaded the trilogy.</p>
<p>Cast members Carrie-Anne Moss and Keanu Reeves certainly had high praise for the film’s script when they were interviewed for a feature in Empire Magazine.</p>
<p>Moss said: “When it was brought to me in the way that it was brought to me, with incredible depth and all of the integrity and artistry that you could imagine, I was like, ‘This is a gift.’ It was just very exciting.”</p>
<p>Reeves added: “Lana Wachowski wrote a beautiful script and a wonderful story that resonated with me. That’s the only reason to do it. To work with her again is just amazing. It’s been really special, and the story has, I think, some meaningful things to say, and that we can take some nourishment from.”</p>
<p>As teased in the coda to Revolutions, a new war between man and machine seems inevitable, and will likely be the primary source of trouble for our heroes…</p>
