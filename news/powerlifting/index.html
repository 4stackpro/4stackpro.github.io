<p>Iran has identified Mansour Pourmirzaei as the country&rsquo;s best hope to fill the void replaced by late powerlifting icon Siamand Rahman.</p>
<p>Ali Asghar Ravasi, the new head coach of the Iranian powerlifting team, told ISNA that it is hoped Pourmirzaei can replicate Rahman&rsquo;s superb achievements in the heavyweight class.</p>
<p>Known as the world&rsquo;s strongest Paralympian, Rahman clinched gold at the London 2012 and Rio 2016 Paralympic Games.</p>
<p>The triple world champion broke the men&rsquo;s over 107 kilograms category world record with a lift of 310kg in the Brazilian city, but tragically died of a heart attack aged just 32 in March.</p>
<p>He has since been honoured with a giant bust in his home town of Oshnavieh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sudden demise of Siaman Rahman inflicted a great blow to the team and first, efforts should be put to rebuild the team&rsquo;s morale and then to get prepared for the Tokyo Paralympics,&rdquo; said Ravasi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Currently, Mansour Pourmirzaei, who has already secured quota for the Tokyo Paralympics, is the best option for replacing Rahman and we are hopeful that he could repeat Rahman&rsquo;s gold in Tokyo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will try to boost his record so that he could be an appropriate replacement for Rahman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tokyo 2020 Paralympics will now take place in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

As he trains to represent Canada at the world powerlifting championships, Sumeet Sharma has been giving back to his community and lifting spirits during the COVID-19 pandemic</p>
<p>A Vancouver powerlifter is using his connections to pump up spirits during the novel coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>As he trains to represent Canada at the October world championships in Russia, Sumeet Sharma has been looking for ways to give back to his community.</p>
<p>In April, he began delivering food and drinks to hospitals across the Lower Mainland, including butter chicken and rice donated by Raga Restaurant in Vancouver and power bars from Supplement King in Surrey. His family and friends provided coffee and water bottles.</p>
<p>“When we come, people’s faces light up,” Sharma said. “They’ve been very happy and grateful.”</p>
<p>A correctional officer at Surrey Pretrial, Sharma also asked colleagues on the emergency response team for help. Several members of his team recently joined him at Langley Memorial Hospital to deliver pizza and coffee.</p>
<p>“For me, it’s really important to pull together in these tough times,” he said. “It’s all about being part of your community and working together.”</p>
<p>Sharma has competed in powerlifting since 2016. A member of the Canadian powerlifting team, he won a gold medal at the North American Powerlifting Championships in Panama City in October with a 370-pound bench press. Before that he claimed silver at the Commonwealth Powerlifting Championships in Newfoundland.</p>
<p>In powerlifting, competitors have three attempts to lift maximum weight on three types of lifts, including squat, bench press and deadlift.</p>
<p>Sharma was set to compete for Canada in the Czech Republic in May, but the event was postponed because of the COVID-19 outbreak. If all goes well, he now hopes to attend the world championships in Russia.</p>
<p>“When gyms shut down, I continued working out at home,” he said.</p>
<p>The powerlifter’s food deliveries are just one way he tries to build community. He also gives presentations to school kids about healthy eating and competition, in addition to training young powerlifters for free.</p>
<p>“Hopefully, if other people hear about what we’re doing, they’ll be inspired to get on-board and help in their own way,” Sharma said.</p>

<h3 id="lauren-simpson-shows-off-killer-physique-in-powerlifting-transformation-videos">&ldquo;Lauren Simpson Shows Off Killer Physique In Powerlifting Transformation Videos&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Lauren-Simpson2-2.jpg" alt="img">
Fitness model Lauren Simpson took to Instagram on Tuesday, June 16 to post a powerlifting transformation video set that showed her progress over the course of three months.</p>
<p>In the first video, Lauren wore a black long-sleeved crop top that showed off a small strip of her midsection. She added a pair of black booty shorts that rose high on her hips and cut off at the very tops of her thighs, contouring to her sculpted figure. The fitness trainer completed the outfit with a pair of white and black Adidas sneakers, which she wore with white ankle mid-calf socks, and added a large black belt and black and red knee pads for added support during her workout. She pulled back her long platinum locks into a ponytail and secured the loose strands with a bobby pin. She appeared to have made up her face with black mascara, eyeliner, and lip gloss.</p>
<p>In the second clip, Lauren wore an all-black outfit that consisted of a sports bra and booty shorts. The top included crossing straps that left cutouts across the chest and teased the model’s cleavage. The skinny spaghetti straps left much of her shoulders and upper back exposed, showing off her enviable muscles. The shorts showed off her chiseled legs and left a chunk of her toned tummy exposed. She added a pair of white sneakers to complete the outfit.</p>
<p>The third video featured the fitness model in a white sports bra and booty shorts. The shorts included a thick waistband that covered her belly button, while drawing the eye to her legs. She added a pair of black sneakers and accessorized with a white scrunchie on one wrist and stud earrings.</p>
<p>Lauren documented her strength-training transformation from March through June of 2020 after having undergone a bowel surgery in February that left her on bed rest and unable to exercise for weeks. In the caption, she expressed her excitement at finally being able to powerlift a 100 kg squat and deadlift, writing that it was a huge milestone. The trainer told her fans she was able to make progress quickly by working her body every day. She started with stretching and mobility and worked her way up to bodyweight, machine, and barbell exercises.</p>
<p>The post earned more than 10,000 likes and nearly 350 comments within the first three hours. Many of the model’s followers were thrilled to learn of her new milestone.</p>
<p>“Congratulations!!!! You are so very inspiring,” one fan commented.

<h3 id="powerlifting-is-copyright-stronger-than-trademarks">&ldquo;Powerlifting: Is Copyright stronger than Trademarks?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-facebook.png" alt="img">
The story starts rather simply. Guangdong Puss Investment Co., Ltd. from China filed a trademark application for the NOME logo, in Serbia. Serbia applies a “first-to-file” system in terms of the trademark registration. There had not been prior similar trademarks, and the registration went smoothly.</p>
<p>However, Guangzhou Renren Management Consulting Co., also from China, filed an invalidation action against this trademark. The legal basis was prior copyright being registered in China – triple black and blue NOME logo. This is where it gets interesting. The Serbian Intellectual Property Office has never by itself, at least as far as we are aware, invalidated a trademark based on copyright. In similar cases, the examiners have always referred cases involving copyright to the courts.</p>
<p>In the NOME case, the Intellectual Property Office decided to accept the copyright registration certificate issued in China. By doing this, it solved the preliminary issue by itself. It made a step forward in efficiency that will affect all future cases where two colliding rights are confronted.
