To Our Readers:</p>
<p>What an unusual and terrible time this is for all of us — with people’s lives at risk, and many lost so far; with the vast majority of us confined to our homes or, out of necessity, precariously trying to work outside our homes. There is much to mourn, much to be grateful for and much cause for worry and fear.</p>
<p>Apart from the obvious life-and-death matters at stake, we at the Book Review are especially concerned for those whose livelihoods depend on books. We think of the authors whose book tours have been canceled, authors who depend on income from teaching, authors who need money from speaking engagements to supplement their advances. All of those opportunities, temporarily — and in some cases, permanently — gone.</p>
<p>Our hearts go out to the debut authors of the season, many of whom spent years, perhaps a lifetime, waiting for the dream moment when their first book would make its way into the world. We think of the authors whose publication dates have been delayed, complicating not only their financial lives but all other plans, professional and personal. We think of the authors whose new books are coming out right now, at a moment when the realities of everyday life can feel all-consuming, and when libraries are shuttered and many bookstores have closed or laid off workers.

<h3 id="recommending-books-is-high-risk--but-its-also-high-reward">Recommending books is high risk – but it&rsquo;s also high reward</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ab837990ef29a00ebc439530e4d829a2eb5225f/0_662_4416_2650/master/4416.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=5cfadb6d97152139c889369c657d8c5e" alt="img">
Recommending books is a tricky but satisfying business. It’s high risk, high reward. Every day I wake up to messages from my friends asking me to recommend “something I’d like” to them. That’s not even a clear directive but still, challenge accepted. And that was before the lockdown.</p>
<p>Now, I’m being asked for lists of books for people to read. So. I dutifully drag myself out of bed and go to my bookshelves. I spend a few minutes thinking about the person. What do we speak about, most of all? Is it politics, is it love? What makes them laugh? What makes them angry? Then I think about whether or not the content of some books might be challenging, or triggering.</p>
<p>I even provided this recommendation service to a woman who took the time to email my website, telling me, across seven fulsome paragraphs, why my novel Queenie was a terrible book, and how disappointed she was by my representation of a black British woman. She got, in return, a list of books about black British women that she might not hate so vehemently.</p>
<p>Woefully, nobody recommends any books to me, the great recommender, but as a gift to you all, here are the three books I tell absolutely everyone to read: Ordinary People by Diana Evans, How to Love a Jamaican by Alexia Arthurs and Citizen by Claudia Rankine.

<h3 id="from-blyton-to-bryson-comfort-reading-to-enjoy-during-lockdown">From Blyton to Bryson: comfort reading to enjoy during lockdown</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97089100ca426c91a2b7a7471e0cd42ea1f27062/0_232_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=4c06e2f5a2bba6fdae9cfb6971c64dc2" alt="img">
From the romance of the English countryside to a chronicle of American small-town life, Jenny Colgan picks books that are kind at heart</p>
<p>Although many superb new books are still being published we also sometimes need a dose of the familiar. So here are some recommendations for comfort reading: works that are familiar, gentle and set in a kinder or funnier world than the one that currently presents itself.</p>
<p>I find myself yearning for the gentle, rain-soaked watercolour writing of Maeve Binchy, with her adorable girls brimming with life and worried, caring mothers. Circle of Friends is a good place to start, tracing the lives of three Irish girls from the 1950s on, but every book she wrote is full of sweetness and heart.</p>
<p>If you haven’t picked up a James Herriot in a while, you may have forgotten just how good he is. As well as being funny, kind and surprisingly romantic, his books such as All Creatures Great and Small offer a beautiful sense of wide open spaces – ideal for when you are feeling hemmed in. He also writes conveniently short, easy chapters, with plenty of dogs.</p>

<p>The BBC has brought forward its new adaptation of Enid Blyton’s Malory Towers series as succour to a grateful nation. Some moments in the books can seem a bit much these days – particularly the hammering poor Gwendoline gets for daring to be overweight and feeling sad about saying goodbye to her parents – but the novels remain classics. For more boarding school tales try Susan Coolidge’s What Katy Did at School and Antonia White’s Frost in May.</p>
<p>Garrison Keillor, whose Prairie Home companion radio show is also available as a podcast, was accused of being twee in his novel Lake Wobegon Days, but these tales of small-town life in the midwest are as warm and reassuring as a big pie. And if you like avuncular Americans, don’t forget Bill Bryson, whose tourist books now read like ancient history. Try Tim Moore, too: Another Fine Mess, in which he travels across Trumpland in a 93-year-old Ford Model T, sounds gimmicky, but is in fact funny, touching and transformative. Continuing the escape theme, both Andrew Martin and Monisha Rajesh are brilliant on very long train journeys.</p>
<p>Fans of Sherlock Holmes might also enjoy Kate Summerscale, who writes intricate nonfiction about the Victorian era. The Suspicions of Mr Whicher was a breakout hit, and her latest, Mrs Robinson’s Disgrace, is equally beguiling, a world in which mysteries are explained and secrets satisfyingly revealed.</p>
<p>When it comes to the classics, I have never understood the fuss around whether George Eliot’s Middlemarch is difficult: it is gossipy, sad, romantic and exciting. Isaac Newton’s Principia Mathematica is difficult; Middlemarch is charming, and if not now, when? You’re in for an absolute treat if you haven’t read it.</p>
<p>And finally don’t forget the staples of the comfort reading genre: Patrick O’Brian, Jane Austen, Georgette Heyer, Louisa May Alcott, Helen Fielding and PG Wodehouse. They will not let you down. As for me, I’m going back to the brilliance of Douglas Adams: “Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral arm of the galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun … ”</p>
