The finance ministers of Eurogroup are due to meet on Tuesday, after being tasked by the EU27 leaders to come up with proposals on the Union’s exit plan from the Covid-19 havoc. During previous videoconferences held, divisions were deep among member-states, which failed to agree on a common European fiscal response to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Germany and the Netherlands were reluctant to issuing common debt with other European nations and in particular with highly indebted countries such as Greece and Italy. As for Angela Merkel’s country, the ‘Corona bonds’ scenario would be a synonym to lack of budgetary discipline for the countries of Europe’s south. Similarly, the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, kept a hardline stance to the temporary eurobonds for Covid-19, proposing instead a gift fund of €10-20 bn, whereby member states would donate for the countries worst-hit by the virus.</p>
<p>Both countries pointed at already existing tools, namely the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and the €410 bn available to countries worst-hit by the virus’ outbreak through credit lines, while they also acknowledged the European Central Bank’s €750 bn stimulus and the Commission’s €100 bn job-support SURE mechanism.</p>
<p>A lending facility from the European Investment Bank (EIB) is also on the table, for the mobilisation of €200 bn of investments, through the creation of a pan-European guarantee fund of €25 bn, that would leverage support for SMEs hit by the pandemic.</p>
<p>As the South is claiming that Europe has not learnt its lesson from the previous Eurozone debt crisis, the formation of a new common debt instrument, and in particular ‘Coronabonds’ to finance the post-virus recovery is a request by nine member-states, including Spain, Greece, France and Italy. Yet, on Monday, Merkel reiterated her government’s position of activating ESM, without mentioning any debt-pooling scenario.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Mário Centeno, the Eurogroup’s President urged the euro area finance ministers to be ‘creative’, when it comes to the fresh money required for EU’s recovery plan.

<h3 id="greek-pm-mitsotakis-holds-video-conference-ahead-of-eurogroup">Greek PM Mitsotakis Holds Video Conference ahead of Eurogroup</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5067187-760x507.jpg" alt="img">
ATHENS – Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis on Tuesday had a video conference in preparation for Tuesday’s Eurogroup with Finance Minister Christos Staikouras, Deputy Minister to the prime minister responsible for the coordination of the government’s work Akis Skertsos, Deputy Minister to the prime minsiter and government spokesperson Stelios Petsas, the director of the prime minister’s Economic Bureau Alexis Patelis, the head of Council of Economic Experts and Greece’s representative to the EuroWorking Group, Mihalis Argyros, and the head of prime minister’s diplomatic bureau, Eleni Sourani.</p>
<p>According to government sources, Greece intends to continue pushing for an EU-issued ‘corona-bond’ at Tuesday’s virtual Eurogroup, in line with a request made at the EU summit by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and other European leaders, as an expression of solidarity with the countries that have been most stricken by the coronavirus crisis and in support of the common European vision.</p>
<p>The same sources said that it is a form of “support capable of persuading European citizens and the markets that Europe has the will and the means to do whatever is takes to deal with the repercussions of the coronavirus on the economies of its member-states.”</p>
<p>Greece will also support the European Commission’s proposal for a programme to support labour, the workforce and the unemployed, as well as a proposal for the support of enterprises via the European Investment Bank.</p>
<p>Regarding the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), Greece will go to meeting with the firm position that a solution must be common and able to meet the demands of the present conjuncture, the sources said. Greece had repeatedly expressed the position, they added, that “in this crisis, the EU must demonstrate decisiveness and solidarity”.</p>
<p>PM Mitsotakis chairs video conference on new town planning bill</p>
<p>Earlier today, a video conference chaired by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis was held on Tuesday at the Maximos Mansion, regarding the new town planning bill that will be presented to the Cabinet in April. The meeting formed part of the effort to prepare the transition to the post-pandemic phase.</p>
<p>According to government sources, the draft bill is a major legislative measure that will strive resolve long-standing issues and aims at the creation of a stable, simple and uniform framework of rules for the entire country, which offers transparency and legal security to investors and citizens.</p>
<p>Participating in the meeting were Environment and Energy Minister Kostis Hatzidakis, State Minister Giorgos Gerapetritis, Deputy Environment and Energy Minister Dimitris Economou, Deputy Minister to the prime minister responsible for the coordination of the government’s work Akis Skertsos, the prime minister’s general secretary Grigoris Dimitriadis, the general secretary for town planning Efthymios Bakoyiannis and the general secretary for the coordination of economic and development issues Vicky Loizou.

<h3 id="eurusd-advances-to-3-day-tops-near-10880-ahead-of-eurogroup">EUR/USD advances to 3-day tops near 1.0880 ahead of Eurogroup</h3>
<p><img src="https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Majors/EURUSD/iStock-919003044_Large.jpg" alt="img">
EUR/USD reverses Monday’s losses and tests 1.0880.</p>
<p>COVID-19 pandemic loses traction in Spain and Italy.</p>
<p>Eurogroup meeting expected to agree on joint debt issuance.</p>
<p>The single currency has left behind Monday’s pessimism and is now pushing EUR/USD to the upper end of the range near 1.0880, or 3-day highs.</p>
<p>EUR/USD looks to Eurogroup event</p>
<p>EUR/USD regains some composure and is reversing a 6-day negative streak on Tuesday, always on the back of the improved sentiment in the risk-associated universe and renewed selling bias around the greenback.</p>
<p>In the meantime, all the attention is expected to be on the Eurogroup meeting due later on Tuesday, where European officials are seen discussing a joint action to help bloc’s members to fight the fallout of the coronavirus on the economy. The centre of the debate is expected to gyrate on the issuance of new debt, while the so-called “coronabonds” should also be on top of the agenda.</p>
<p>The better tone in the riskier assets has also echoed in the German fixed income markets, where yields of the key 10-year Bund are navigating daily highs around -0.37%.</p>
<p>In the docket, the German Industrial Production expanded 0.3% MoM during February, extending the positive trend from the start of the year and surpassing initial consensus for a 0.9% contraction. Across the Atlantic, JOLTS Job Openings and the API’s weekly report will be on the limelight.</p>
<p>What to look for around EUR</p>
<p>The single currency has regained the smile on Tuesday following the negative start of the week, as markets have improved their sentiment on the back of positive headlines from the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in Spain and Italy, where infected cases and deaths appear to have left the worst behind. On the macro view, recent better-than-expected results in fundamentals in both Germany and the broader Euroland opened the door to some respite in the prevailing downtrend, although the underlying stance still remains well on the negative side.</p>
<p>EUR/USD levels to watch</p>
<p>At the moment, the pair is gaining 0.74% at 1.0871 and a break above 1.0983 (55-day SMA) would target 1.0992 (monthly low Jan.29) en route to 1.1066 (200-day SMA). On the other hand, immediate contention emerges at 1.0768 (monthly low Apr.6) seconded by 1.0635 (2020 low Mar.20) and finally 1.0569 (monthly low Apr.10 2017).
