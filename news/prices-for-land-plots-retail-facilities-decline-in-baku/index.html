<h3 id="watch-charles-leclerc-recreates-i-am-stupid-moment-from-baku-in-virtual-racing">WATCH: Charles Leclerc Recreates “I am Stupid” Moment from Baku in Virtual Racing</h3>
<p><img src="https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/20200414192834/lec-2.jpg" alt="img">
The coronavirus pandemic has unleashed devastation with sporting schedules, yet F1 motorsport supervisor Ross Brawn is cheerful. He says Grand Prix racing can take in lessons from a troublesome circumstance so the title rises on a more grounded and increasingly reasonable balance when racing gets moving once more. Teams and Drivers are doing their best to indulge the fans. Charles Leclerc, Max, Norris are participating in various F1 Esports events. While teams are giving fun activities to cheer their fans.</p>
<p>Canada was the ninth race to be deferred or dropped not long ago, which means Formula 1 won’t start until late June at the earliest. Brawn has proposed 19 races could even now be conceivable, with races potentially going in without spectators.</p>
<p>F1 supervisors have moved to help lessen expenses to help secure groups, including broadening the shutdown by 14 days to five weeks. Three groups – McLaren, Williams and Racing Point have put a portion of their staff on leave of absence, as have F1. While senior administration and a few drivers have taken compensation cuts.</p>
<p>More and More drivers are now joining the F1 Esports. Even players from different sports are also coming in to support F1. Recently Charles Leclerc won the Virtual Australian GP. The race took place on 6th April 2020 in place of the Vietnam GP which is currently postponed.</p>
<p>Charles Leclerc has just been playing the F1 2019 game for seven days, yet that didn’t prevent him from taking a predominant debut triumph in his first F1 Esports Virtual Grand Prix on Sunday night.</p>
<p>The Ferrari driver was racing around the Australian Grand Prix’s Albert Park track for the FDA Hublot Esports Team.</p>
<p>Although, Mattia Binotto is happy with Leclerc’s win. He said “Leclerc enjoyed… the Esports,” said Binotto, speaking to Sky Sports F1. “I think for him, it was important to be back in the cockpit. He was missing the cockpit, he was missing the racing and the emotion.</p>
<p>“I think it has been a great event,” he added, “a lot of enthusiasm, feedback. I think people were positive, that was good, and it was positive that [Charles] started in pole, finished first. That’s what he was looking for, and he enjoyed the moment.”</p>
<p>Charles Leclerc imitates the Baku crash</p>
<p>Every Charles Leclerc fan still remembers the accident of the driver which took place in Baku.</p>
<p>Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc smashed into the wall during the qualifying session of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix. Ii was in the wake of hitting the barriers at the tightest area of the circuit.</p>
<p>He had just set a time sufficiently speedy to advance through to the last session of qualifying. However, due to the slip-up, he started on the ninth position on Sunday.</p>
<p>“I am stupid. I am stupid,” Leclerc says on team radio as the session was red-flagged.</p>
<p>Therefore, he tweeted not long after that he had “been useless” and had “no excuses”.</p>
<p>Charles Leclerc has been taking place in various Esports event since then. He is participating in the event called ‘#Racefortheworld’. Apart from Leclerc, there are 5 other F1 drivers also. The event consists of 3 races and its a part of charity to fight COVID-19. Today is the 2nd race of the event.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Charles Leclerc was practicing for the event at the Baku circuit. What happens next is quite hilarious. With only 11 minutes remaining in the qualifying session, he crashed at the same castle section where he crashed during the 2019 race weekend. After the crash, everyone started bombarding the comments section with “I am stupid. I am stupid.” Leclerc says “Bad memories, Flashback. I can see you all coming in the comments.”
