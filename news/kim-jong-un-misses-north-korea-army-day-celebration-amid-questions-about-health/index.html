There are new questions surrounding the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un after his reported absence from &ldquo;Army Day&rdquo; celebrations on Saturday. This is the second major holiday the Supreme Leader has missed in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a train likely belonging to Kim has been parked at his compound on the country&rsquo;s east coast since last week, satellite imagery showed, amid speculation about his health that has been caused, in part, by a long period out of the public eye.</p>
<p>This Wednesday, April 15, 2020, satellite image provided by Airbus Defence &amp; Space and annotated by 38 North, a website specializing in North Korea studies, shows overview of Wonsan complex in Wonsan, North Korea. AP</p>
<p>The satellite photos released by 38 North, a website specializing in North Korea studies, don&rsquo;t say anything about Kim&rsquo;s potential health problems, and they echo South Korean government intelligence that Kim is staying outside of the capital, Pyongyang. Seoul has also repeatedly indicated that there have been no unusual signs that could indicate health problems for Kim.</p>
<p>That hasn&rsquo;t stopped growing unconfirmed rumors and media reports about Kim&rsquo;s health that have emerged since he missed an April 15 commemoration of the 108th birthday of his grandfather, North Korea founder Kim Il Sung.</p>
<p>Kim Jong Un is the third generation of his family to rule North Korea, and he hadn&rsquo;t missed the April 15 event, one of the year&rsquo;s most important for the North, since assuming power after his father Kim Jong Il&rsquo;s death in late 2011.</p>
<p>Kim&rsquo;s health is of crucial importance because of worries that the serious illness or death of a leader venerated with near godlike passion by millions of North Koreans could cause instability in the impoverished, nuclear-armed country.</p>
<p>Many experts in South Korea downplayed speculation that Kim is seriously ill. They also said North Korea won&rsquo;t likely face a serious immediate turmoil even if Kim is incapacitated or dies because someone else like his influential sister Kim Yo Jong will quickly step in, though the prospect for the North&rsquo;s long-term political future would be unclear.</p>
<p>Kim Jong Un&rsquo;s train has been parked at the Leadership Railway Station servicing his Wonsan compound since at least April 21, the website 38 North said Saturday, citing an analysis of recent satellite photos of the area. The website said that the approximately 250-meter (820-foot) -long train wasn&rsquo;t present on April 15 but was present on both April 21 and 23.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The train&rsquo;s presence does not prove the whereabouts of the North Korean leader or indicate anything about his health, but it does lend weight to reports that Kim is staying at an elite area on the country&rsquo;s eastern coast,&rdquo; it said.</p>
<p>The photos indicate the train arrived before April 21 and was still present on April 23, when it appeared to be repositioned for departure. However, there was no indication when that departure might take place, 38 North said.</p>
<p>North Korea exerts extremely tight control on information about its leadership, making it virtually impossible for outsiders to find out what&rsquo;s going on at those senior levels. Even South Korea&rsquo;s main spy agency has a mixed record on confirming developments in North Korea. When Kim Jong Il died in December 2011, for instance, few outsiders knew it until it was reported by North Korea&rsquo;s state media two days later.</p>
<p>A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn&rsquo;t authorized to talk to the media, said the latest rumors about Kim&rsquo;s health had not changed the U.S. assessment of the information as &ldquo;speculation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danny Russel, a former National Security Council director and assistant secretary of state for Asia who has dealt with North Korea in the past, cautioned that rumors have abounded for years about Kim, his father, Kim Jong Il, and his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, and most turned out to have been false.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While serving in government I was on the receiving end of multiple intelligence reports about alleged accidents, illnesses and assassination attempts against North Korean leaders - only to have them reappear in public,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>South Korea&rsquo;s presidential office said last week that Kim appeared to be handling state affairs normally and that there had been no suspicious activities, such as an emergency readiness order issued by the North&rsquo;s military or the ruling Workers&rsquo; Party. The South Korean government has since maintained its assessment that Kim&rsquo;s health remains the same. Some South Korean media outlets, citing unidentified government officials, have reported that Kim was staying at Wonsan.</p>
<p>North Korea&rsquo;s state media still remain silent about the outside speculation on Kim&rsquo;s health. On Saturday, the official Korean Central News Agency reported that Kim had received a message of greeting from the chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation on the occasion of the first anniversary of Kim&rsquo;s summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The message wished Kim &ldquo;good health and happiness,&rdquo; KCNA said.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the first time that Kim has vanished from the public eye, and past absences in state media dispatches have also triggered speculation about his health. In 2014, state media didn&rsquo;t report any public activities for Kim for about six weeks, before he reappeared with a cane. South Korea&rsquo;s spy agency said later that he had a cyst removed from his ankle.</p>
<p>Alex Ward, a Vox staff writer covering international security and defense issues, told CBSN that in addition to Kim&rsquo;s general poor health, what makes his absence from the public eye different this time is that he has missed two high-profile holidays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have not seen images of Kim at the Army parade on Saturday and especially at the ceremony for his grandfather on the 15th, a massive holiday for North Korea, it has led to speculation,&rdquo; Ward said.

<h3 id="as-kim-jong-un-disappears-north-korea-watchers-advise-caution">As Kim Jong Un Disappears, North Korea Watchers Advise Caution</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.wsj.net/im-180482/social" alt="img">
One question swirled among North Korea watchers this weekend—where is Kim Jong Un?—as the dictator’s unexplained absence stretched past two weeks and Twitter lighted up with speculation about his incapacitation or death.</p>
<p>As of late Sunday, there was little information about the third-generation leader’s health. The guessing game began when Mr. Kim missed the country’s most important holiday on April 15, then ratcheted higher after a South Korean publication reported he had had heart surgery. On Saturday, a Japanese magazine&hellip;

<h3 id="a-woman-in-a-mans-world-could-kim-yo-jong-really-become-north-koreas-leader">A woman in a man&rsquo;s world: could Kim Yo Jong really become North Korea&rsquo;s leader?</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nknews.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kim-Yo-Jong-Kim-Jong-Un-Moon-Jae-in.jpg" alt="img">
Views expressed in Opinion articles are exclusively the authors’ own and do not represent those of NK News.</p>
<p>The latest rumors of Kim Jong Un’s deteriorating health should come as no surprise. His indulgent lifestyle, chronicled by former NBA star Dennis Rodman among others, includes a love of cigarettes, liquor, and the Swiss cheese he reportedly acquired a taste for during his student days in Bern.</p>
<p>All are addictive habits designed to clog one’s arteries, damage one’s lungs, and expand one’s waistline.</p>
<p>Still, for a 36-year-old to have let his body deteriorate so rapidly is rather astonishing. His grandfather, after all, lived until the age of 82, and even his father, with a myriad of chronic health problems, made it to the age of 70.</p>
<p>Kim Jong Un, with the best medical care North Korea can buy, is not likely to be gone tomorrow. His father and grandfather both reportedly sought expert medical care overseas and had medical specialists flown in from Europe when the need arose.</p>
<p>This could be complicated a little more because of the global shutdown due to the coronavirus. Still, being the Supreme Leader of some twenty-five million people has its advantages, especially when moral scruples are not an issue.</p>
<p>Certainly, if the need for a heart transplant arises, a willing “volunteer” can be found from among the masses — if not from the emaciated population in the North Korean gulag then from a healthy specimen in the Korean People’s Army (KPA).</p>
<p>Yet there must be thoughts of the need for some contingency planning in Pyongyang, if worse comes to worst.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the Kim family dynasty, like the English Tudor dynasty before them, there is a dearth of available male heirs — and they must contend with the disturbing prospect of a power struggle and perhaps even civil war with nuclear-armed rivals in the case of Kim Jong Un’s sudden demise.</p>
<p>Kim Jong Un does have a daughter, Ju Ae, who should be about ten-years-old at this point based on what he disclosed to Dennis Rodman back in 2013. Rodman noted at the time that he thought Kim was “a good dad.”</p>
<p>Rumors have it that Kim and his wife, Ri Sol Ju, may have one or two other children by now, perhaps including a boy. They would, however, be mere children, not capable at present of taking the reins of power in the labyrinth of Pyongyang.</p>
<p>Possibly the most capable available male heir in the Baekdu bloodline was Kim Jong Un’s half-brother, Kim Jong Nam. But his embarrassing Tokyo Disneyland passport scandal two decades ago put him out of favor with his father Kim Jong Il.</p>
<p>Then he was considered too close to his uncle, the disgraced and executed Jang Song Thaek, as well as to Beijing. His off-the-cuff comments to the press on the occasion of his little brother’s ascension were also considered highly politically suspect.</p>
<p>He had to be liquidated, literally, with biochemical cream rubbed in his face at a Malaysian airport a few years back.</p>
<p>Kim Jong Un does have an elder brother, Kim Jong Chol, from the same mother. However, he was considered “too effeminate” (possibly meaning gay) by his father, Kim Jong Il, and was passed over for the succession.</p>
<p>Dad knew that the dog-eat-dog world of North Korean generals and Party cadres in Pyongyang is no spectator sport.</p>
<p>Is Confucian, male chauvinist, highly militaristic North Korea ready for a woman in the top position?</p>
<p>The Kim family is now posed with the question of how to maintain the family firm into a fourth generation if something suddenly happens to Kim Jong Un.</p>
<p>Press speculation has turned to younger sister Kim Yo Jong as the potential heir.</p>
<p>She reportedly recently returned to favor with her reappointment to the politburo after being scuttled for promoting the failed summit diplomacy with U.S. President Trump.</p>
<p>She had her coming-out party at the South Korean Winter Olympics in 2018, where she warmed to South Korean President Moon Jae-in even as U.S. Vice President Pence, accompanied by deceased American student Otto Warmbier’s father, snubbed her.</p>
<p>Long seen as handling big brother Kim Jong Un’s public image as his de facto press secretary, she stepped forward in her own right recently.</p>
<p>She denounced Seoul in a scathing public remark as “a frightened barking dog” after a periodic military exercise. Yonsei University research fellow Youngshik Bong told the Guardian that this was a sign Kim Jong Un was ready to let his sister “become his alter ego.”</p>
<p>Still, alter ego or not, the question remains: is Confucian, male chauvinist, highly militaristic North Korea ready for a woman in the top position — something that even Americans recently rejected in the 2016 presidential election?</p>
<p>North Korea’s tough old generals certainly all know the misogynistic, old Korean proverb warning against assertive females: “if the hen crows, the household will be destroyed.”</p>
<p>Are these generals ready for a crowing hen? North Korea, with its dance troupes and musical groups of beautiful young women provided for the entertainment of the male elite, with its gulags full of sexually exploited women, and with its sexual trafficking of refugee women along its border with China is certainly one place that the “Me Too” movement has passed by.</p>
<p>Kim Yo Jong has both her gender and her tender age, 31, against her. Even her brother, Kim Jong Un, was allegedly scrutinized as “a mere boy” by the older male military establishment when he assumed power at the age of 27.</p>
<p>He reportedly sought to embellish his credentials with the skeptics in his run-up to power by taking credit for the torpedoing of the South Korean naval vessel the Cheonan in 2010. Will Kim Yo Jong also need to sink a ship or two to prove her bona fides?</p>
<p>Another woman ruler gained the title Gloriana by sinking a whole fleet of ships belonging to the then greatest naval power in the world — the Spanish Armada — with the help of Sir Francis Drake and some divine winds in the North Sea.</p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth I of England also assumed power after her brother, King Edward VI, had died — after her older sister Mary’s brief interregnum.</p>
<p>Her Tudor family, like the Kims, feared disruptions and civil war if the dynasty suddenly died out. As a woman in a man’s world, Elizabeth had to demonstrate that she could be as iron-willed and ruthless as her father, Henry VIII.</p>
<p>The Tudors, like the Kims, displayed no compunction about executing rivals and subordinates, even family members. The list of beheaded included everyone from Anne Boleyn (Elizabeth’s own mother) to Sir Thomas More to Lady Jane Grey.</p>
<p>The Kims have done similarly, executing scores including Uncle Jang, brother Kim Jong Nam, and members of the old order like Vice Marshal Ri Yong Ho.</p>
<p>Elizabeth followed this bloody path in approving regicide through the execution of anointed royalty, her cousin Mary Queen of Scots. She then had the audacity to name the dead Mary’s son, James VI of Scotland, as her own heir since the Tudor bloodline had finally dried up.</p>
<p>If Kim Yo Jong sets up shop in Pyongyang, her first order of business might be tracking down and eliminating her own nephew, Kim Han Sol, the son of her murdered half-brother Kim Jong Nam.</p>
<p>Han Sol disappeared soon after his father’s murder, having reportedly been spirited away by a secretive North Korean defector organization.</p>
<p>This twenty-something may be young, but he is still a member of the Baekdu bloodline and, more importantly, male. If Kim Yo Jong cannot secure the reins of power directly because of her gender, she may wish to imitate another highly successful female ruler in a Confucian society, the Chinese Empress Dowager Cixi.</p>
<p>The “Old Buddha” knew that she, as a female, could not rule China directly, only from “behind the curtain.” She reigned through two Emperors, first her son and then her nephew.</p>
<p>Similarly, Kim Yo Jong may assume power as a “regent” for her deceased brother Kim Jong Un’s very young son.</p>
<p>Kim Yo Jong’s second order of business after taking over would likely be playing tough with Seoul and Washington, to impress the generals, possibly by launching some more missiles.</p>
<p>As President Trump does not seem to do well with women leaders — ask Angela Merkel and Theresa May — Kim Yo Jong may then want to throw another nuclear test right in his face.</p>
<p>She also may wish to borrow another page from the English Virgin Queen’s playbook by not having some highly visible male consort at her side.</p>
<p>Her own aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, was a close adviser to her own brother Kim Jong Il, but then ran afoul of the powers-that-be by the downfall of her politically ambitious husband, Jang Song Thaek.</p>
<p>Kim Yo Jong may wish to rule, like Elizabeth, in her own right with no official husband plotting behind her back. To be another Gloriana in her own right in what is still a man’s world, Kim Yo Jong may wish to rule as the Virgin Supreme Leader of North Korea.</p>
