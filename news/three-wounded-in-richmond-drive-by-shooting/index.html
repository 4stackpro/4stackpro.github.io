RICHMOND — Three men attending a family barbecue were wounded in a drive-by shooting Wednesday night, police said Thursday.</p>
<p>The three men, who police said are Richmond residents believed to be in their 20s, were in stable condition.</p>
<p>The shooting happened about 7:13 p.m. Wednesday in the 400 block of Marina Way South.</p>
<p>Officers responding to a ShotSpotter activation found a group of people in a carport including the three gunshot victims.</p>
<p>Sgt. Aaron Pomeroy said in a news release that officers learned that family members were having a barbecue in the carport while doing their best to social distance, when a light colored vehicle approached the residence, stopped, and at least one occupant of the vehicle began shooting.</p>
<p>The vehicle then fled northbound on Marina Way South.</p>
<p>One man who suffered a gunshot to his upper torso was flown by air ambulance to a local</p>
<p>trauma center. The other two men, who were wounded in their extremities, were taken to local hospitals for</p>
<p>treatment. All three men were in stable condition and expected to survive their wounds.</p>
<p>Police have not yet released a motive for the shooting or announced any arrests.</p>
<p>Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to contact Homicide Detective Jose Villalobos at (510) 620-6541, email him at <a href="mailto:jvillalobos@richmondpd.net">jvillalobos@richmondpd.net</a> or contact Richmond’s anonymous tip line at (510) 621-1212, extension 1933.</p>

FLORENCE, AZ (3TV/CBS 5) &ndash; From unemployment and safety to suddenly having to home-school children, several issues are weighing heavy on the minds of Arizonans as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>As a result, Desert Rock Church in Florence has created a unique drive-in service experience just south of the Florence Hospital on Franklin Road.</p>
<p>“This is the first time in history that we’ve all experienced the same thing,” said Pastor Joey Bilbrey.</p>
<p>Latest Arizona coronavirus news: Updates from Arizona&rsquo;s Family newsroom This is the latest confirmed information about the coronavirus in Arizona. This page will be continuously updated by the Arizona&rsquo;s Family digital staff.</p>
<p>Church members stay in their cars and listen to the hour-long service through FM radio.</p>
<p>Pastor Bilbrey, staff and volunteers wear masks, gloves and keep at least six feet of distance in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines.</p>
<p>“Even if we can’t touch each other, even if we can’t hug, we all still feel the love of God,” said Sharon Woodard, a church member.</p>
<p>In addition to pre-packaged communion, Desert Rock’s service has several other changes with the safety of churchgoers in mind.</p>
<p>“We do a lot of waving and when they like when something is said they’ll honk their horn and celebrate that way,” said Pastor Bilbrey.</p>
<p>“It looks different in a lot of ways. We want to love our neighbor and we want people to come here and feel comfortable and know that we care about their safety,” said Naomi Wood, a church volunteer.</p>
<p>At a time when many in the community feel isolated at home, this new drive-in service experience is catching on in popularity.</p>
<p>“This lifts us up and I think everyone needs that,” said Woodard.</p>
<p>“People need hope at this time, they need to know they’re okay, they need to know they’re not alone. That’s one of the reasons we wanted to do drive-in church. We are not alone,” said Pastor Bilbrey.</p>
<p>Desert Rock holds its drive-in service at 9 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. each Sunday.

<h3 id="nonprofits-greenways-drive-for-charity-ending">Nonprofits: Greenway’s Drive for Charity Ending</h3>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/loudounnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/greenway-3.jpg?fit=1000%2C667&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
Nonprofit leaders say they’ve been told the Dulles Greenway will end its annual Drive for Charity, which dedicates one day of toll revenues to nonprofits and last year raised close to $327,000.</p>
<p>In 2019, that money was distributed among the March of Dimes, ECHO, the Loudoun Abused Women’s Shelter, Fresh Air/Full Care, the Loudoun Wildlife Conservancy, the Loudoun Free Clinic and Loudoun Hunger Relief. The collection also funds the Dulles Greenway Scholarship Program, which provides $2,000 to a graduating senior at each of Loudoun’s 16 public high schools.</p>
<p>Last year, the Drive for Charity resulted in donations of more than $42,000 to each nonprofit. While they were grateful for the reliable funding they have received over the years, ending the program will leave holes in their budgets. And nonprofit leaders don’t believe the replacement event will bring in the same kind of funding.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be a pessimist, but based on what I’ve heard so far, I don’t think it’s a $50,000 event,” said disability services nonprofit ECHO Executive Director Paul Donohue.</p>
<p>And, he said, ECHO already does two fundraising events of its own, the ECHO Tennis Classic and the Tour de ECHO—”We don’t really have the bandwidth to do a third event.”</p>
<p>And some nonprofit leaders say they won’t be able to participate in the Greenway’s new event, about which they don’t have details but which they expect to be a 5K on the Greenway, at all.</p>
<p>“We have our golf tournament at around the same time, and I wouldn’t switch my sponsors from our golf tournament to sponsor an event on the Greenway,” said Loudoun Abused Women’s Shelter Executive Director Judy Hanley.</p>
<p>The decision comes the same year the Greenway’s owners applied to the State Corporation Commission to increase tolls every year for the next five years, resulting in a total increase of 30 to 36 percent over today’s rates.</p>
<p>The Drive for Charity money was also a particularly valuable kind of funding—unrestricted funding, which is sometimes hard to find for nonprofits. Grant funding is often restricted to specific programs or projects, meaning it can’t be used for overhead expenses like offices and administration.</p>
<p>“A lot of our funders want the funding to go directly to services for clients, so the Greenway funding covered overhead costs, which is a huge loss to our organization,” Hanley said. “And even though it’s a small percentage of our overall budget of $2.6 million, it’s still a significant chunk of money that we needed for overhead.”</p>
<p>Other nonprofits with smaller budgets will feel the loss even more keenly.</p>
<p>“About a quarter of our operating revenue from last year came from the Drive for Charity, and it’s been similar for previous years,” said Loudoun Wildlife Conservancy Executive Director Michael Myers. “So, what that means for our organization is, it supports and enables us to conduct pretty much all of our programs.”</p>
<p>His organization also has other ties to the Greenway, leading walking tours of the company’s 149 acres of privately held wetlands, conducting bird counts, and other programs.</p>
<p>“We look forward to whatever iteration of their charitable giving, because we have a strong relationship with them that goes deeper than just the financial benefits,” Myers said.</p>
<p>Although the word went out about six months ago, long before the COVID-19 pandemic sent the country into lockdown, for nonprofits weathering the storm, it’s just one more bit of bad news.</p>
<p>“To their credit they gave us months of warning,” Donohue said. ECHO, which is funded largely through fees collected from the state or Medicaid for services to their clients, has felt the impact particularly hard as many clients can into the nonprofit amid the current social distancing protocols. For fee-for-service nonprofits buffeted by COVID-19 pandemic, Donohue said, “it’s almost surreal.”</p>
<p>“That $50,000, right now—I never could have imagined saying this, but that seems like kind of nothing, because we’re doing our billing right now for March services, and it’s less than half of normal,” Donohue said. “And this time in a month, when we bill for April, based on the way things are going, it’s going to be almost nothing. And we’re a $6 million organization, so our monthly cashflow is pretty significant, of which $50,000 in May is a tiny piece.”</p>
<p>ECHO also offers transportation for their clients with a fleet of buses and vans, and the Drive for Charity money went directly into that part of the budget.</p>
<p>“At the time, it represented a budget deficit that we were going to have to figure out how to get around, but compared to the COVID budget deficit … it’s really just one piece of the tsunami,” Donohue said.</p>
<p>Nonprofit leaders were grateful for the support they’ve had in previous years, and are still figuring out how they will fill those holes in their budget.</p>
<p>“Corks [for a Cause, a Loudoun Abused Women’s Shelter fundraiser] last year brought in about $40,000 net, and the [annual LAWS] golf tournament brought in about $20,000, so even our events don’t make as much as the Greenway was donating to us,” Hanley said. “We are incredibly thankful that we’ve been a recipient for 13 years.”</p>
<p>“I bear no ill will towards the Greenway, I mean 10 years of about $50,000 is phenomenal, and I certainly appreciate all the drivers in the area that jumped on the road every year to do that,” Donohue said. “…. They were kind of called out for, ‘how can you raise tolls and then give money away to charity, you should cut your tolls and forget the charity.’ I guess they’re playing hardball.”</p>
<p>“Just as the Dulles Greenway is reimagining their charitable giving to local nonprofits, we’re sort of reimagining our fundraising strategy,” Myers said. “So, this is an opportunity with their alternative event. It’s an opportunity for us to engage with our local donors and local business.”</p>
<p>A Greenway spokesman declined to comment.
