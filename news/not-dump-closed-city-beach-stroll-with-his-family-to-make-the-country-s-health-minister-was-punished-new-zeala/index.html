紐西蘭衛生部長克拉克（David Clark）不甩政府封城禁令，開車載著家人到海邊散步，被發現後引起公憤，克拉克隨後遞出辭呈道歉，還罵自己真是個「白癡」；紐西蘭總理阿爾登（Jacinda Ardern）今（7日）表示，他已退回克拉克的辭呈，以免影響國內抗疫行動，不過會將他的財政部副部長職務解職，並將他降至內閣官員的最低級別。</p>
<p>紐西蘭自3月26日起封城，所有人被要求居家隔離，如果沒有購買生活必需品等必要理由，不可駕車外出。</p>
<p>然而英媒《衛報》報導，封城令發布的第一週，衛生部長克拉克就被發現開車到離他家2公里的公園騎自行車，過沒幾天，又被拍到帶著家人去海灘散步，明顯違反規定的出遊照片被拍下後引發討論。克拉克隨後承認犯錯並向總理阿爾登遞出辭呈，「在我們要求紐西蘭人做出歷史性讓步的時候，我讓大家失望了，我真是個白痴，我了解大家對我生氣的原因。」</p>
<p>總理阿爾登（Jacinda Ardern）隨即下達指令，拔除他的財政部副部長職務，並將他降至內閣官員的最低級別，不過克拉克將繼續擔任衛生部長。「正常情況下，我會將他解職，他確實做錯了，而且不存在任何藉口。」不過當前疫情嚴峻，若將克拉克革職恐怕會影響紐國抗疫行動，「我們承受不住醫療衛生系統的崩解，就因為這個原因，克拉克將繼續留任衛生部長。」阿爾登表示。</p>
<p>今（7日）紐西蘭今天新增54起確診病例，為兩週以來的新低，目前累積確診病例來到1160例。

<h3 id="health-minister-david-clarks-covid-19-rule-flouting-a-slap-in-the-face---mourner">Health Minister David Clark&rsquo;s COVID-19 rule-flouting a &lsquo;slap in the face&rsquo; - mourner</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/04/health-minister-david-clark-s-covid-19-rule-flouting-a-slap-in-the-face-mourner/_jcr_content/par/video/image.dynimg.1280.q75.jpg/v1586242976974/GettyImages-1012263594-David-clark-health-minister.jpg" alt="img">
&ldquo;He was being cremated on his own on the day of lockdown, so my husband and I felt really, really uncomfortable about leaving our bubble,&rdquo; she told Newshub.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t leave their bubble but they did leave their house, trailing the hearse as a final farewell because lockdown rules meant they weren&rsquo;t allowed into the crematorium.</p>
<p>Parsons learnt on Tuesday that on that same weekend, the Health Minister flouted the rules.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way you can now tell people what to do when literally that weekend that I had to follow a hearse and couldn&rsquo;t get out of the car&hellip; he was driving to the beach with his family,&rdquo; she told Newshub.</p>
<p>Dr Clark drove 20 kilometres from his North Dunedin home to Doctors Point beach for a walk - something he has been repeatedly warning us not to do.</p>
<p>Driving to a recreation location is expressly forbidden. It&rsquo;s Dr Clark&rsquo;s second offence after driving to a track to go mountain biking - a forbidden sport during lockdown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that there&rsquo;s any excuse for my behaviour - that&rsquo;s why I offered my resignation,&rdquo; he said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said, &ldquo;Under normal circumstances I would sack the minister. What he did was wrong, and there are no excuses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead, she has stripped him of his Associate Finance role and demoted him to the lowest ranking in her Cabinet - teetering on being cut completely.</p>
<p>Newshub asked the Prime Minister if Dr Clark will be sacked once the pandemic is over and she responded: &ldquo;I am totally focused on this and not hypotheticals. We need to get on with the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s questionable whether Dr Clark can even do that after a blundering appearance at Tuesday&rsquo;s COVID-19 Epidemic Response Committee during which he frequently passed questions on to Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you be able to tell us? You&rsquo;re the Minister of Health,&rdquo; National leader Simon Bridges, the chair of the committee, asked him during the meeting.</p>
<p>Dr Clark only came clean to the Prime Minister after Newshub asked on Monday about other lockdown breaches, and the question came up in his preparation for the committee meeting.</p>
<p>Four days after being busted for mountain biking, he had a sudden total recall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was bloody obvious and I felt like a complete dick if I&rsquo;m honest,&rdquo; Dr Clark told The AM Show.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s more than that.</p>
<p>Asked what message his actions have sent, Parsons told Newshub: &ldquo;That we don&rsquo;t really matter. It&rsquo;s one rule for some and not others. It&rsquo;s a slap in the face, that&rsquo;s the best way to describe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prime Minister was asked how Dr Clark can do his job when he doesn&rsquo;t have moral authority.</p>
<p>She replied, &ldquo;He has made a massive mistake. What he did was wrong and there are no excuses for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet, he holds onto one of the most important jobs in the country.</p>
<p>Political Editor Tova O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s analysis</p>
<p>David Clark is going to have to work bloody hard to regain the trust of the country. He&rsquo;s in the last chance saloon, and if he screws up again, he&rsquo;s gone.</p>
<p>That was a very strong message from the Prime Minister that she would&rsquo;ve sacked him. She is livid, and serious consideration was given to accepting his resignation on Monday night.</p>
<p>David Clark is also not saying whether he&rsquo;ll stand at September&rsquo;s election - if indeed it still goes ahead, no firm decision has been made on that yet.</p>
<p>Jacinda Ardern is in an invidious position, she&rsquo;s trying to steer a steady ship during this crisis but the guy who should be her first mate acted like an arrogant dick.</p>
<p>Dr Clark has an axe hanging over his head. He has very little credibility and is distracting from the government&rsquo;s otherwise pretty impressive response to covid-19. His future as an effective Health Minister seems untenable.

<h3 id="heather-du-plessis-allan-firing-david-clark-would-have-done-more-harm-than-good">Heather du Plessis-Allan: Firing David Clark would have done more harm than good</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/media/22956943/jacinda-ardern-david-clark-suicide-announcement-nzh.jpg?width=635&amp;height=395&amp;mode=crop" alt="img">
The Prime Minister executed perfect political judgement today.</p>
<p>She covered off all her bases so well that there was no political gain in firing David Clark. Actually, it would’ve done more harm than good.</p>
<p>So yes, she could’ve made an example of him to other rule-breakers. But she did that without firing him. She stripped him of a portfolio, dumped him to the bottom of the cabinet rankings and humiliated him by saying he would’ve been sacked if we weren’t in the middle of a health crisis.</p>
<p>Yes, it would’ve made her look strong when she has a track record of failing to fire errant ministers. But, she doesn’t need to look strong at the moment. Everything she’s doing at the moment with every twist of this pandemic response makes her look strong.</p>
<p>We are in the middle of the biggest health crisis in 102 years.</p>
<p>The health minister should be crucial. But, we can tell David Clark isn’t. That’s obvious from his geographic location. He’s in Dunedin when the people really running the response are all working together in Wellington</p>
<p>He can’t even answer basic questions. The number of times he had to ask Ashley Bloomfield to help answer questions in today’s epidemic response select committee told us he’s not across the details of what’s happening.</p>
<p>But, firing him would be admitting his irrelevance. And admitting that would be admitting the calibre of the cabinet is so weak this was the best they could do for a crucial ministry like health</p>
<p>And here’s the crucial thing: unlike normal times she could explain her decision directly to voters. That is an important difference right now.</p>
<p>Normally the Prime Minister would be grilled by journalists somewhere in parliament, then have her answers chopped up and put in stories and interpreted by members of the media.</p>
<p>But that’s not happening. Instead, she’s making statements an answering questions every afternoon and that’s going out live on radio and TV and websites and hundreds of thousands of us are tuning in and hearing her responses in totality</p>
<p>Which means she gets to explain her reasoning, repeat how disappointed she is in David Clark, tell him off some more, all without any media interpretation of that.</p>
<p>It’s the PM direct to the public, explaining why she made the call, and the public trusts her right now. She has a lot of goodwill, so she used it, and she used it well.
