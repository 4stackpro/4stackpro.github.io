The Black Eyed Peas have teamed up with Puerto Rican superstar Ozuna and newcomer J. Rey Soul in their upbeat new reggaeton-house single, “Mamacita.”</p>
<p>Recorded in English and Spanish, the new song comes paired with an ultrachic music video by Director X, set at a colorful, tropical resort hotel straight out of the Sixties. Ozuna and the Black Eyed Peas dance around the premises with bellhops in bright pink hoodies. The visual serves as a kind of introduction to J. Rey Soul, or 22-year-old Jessica Reynoso, a black Filipina artist who was a finalist on The Voice of the Philippines Season One. She became an official member of the Black Eyed Peas in late 2018.</p>
<p>“Mamacita” marks the second release from the Black Eyed Peas since signing to their new label Epic Records. Earlier this year they joined forces with J Balvin for the release of “Ritmo (Bad Boys for Life),” which featured on the soundtrack to the 2020 film Bad Boys for Life. Their last album, the politically charged Masters of the Sun Vol. 1, was released in October 2018.</p>
<p>Ozuna released his latest album, Nibiru, this past November. Last month, he released a remix of the classic Latin crossover hit “Macarena” with Tyga.

<h3 id="a-fantasía-made-reality-ozuna-scores-18th-no-1-on-latin-airplay">A &lsquo;Fantasía&rsquo; Made Reality: Ozuna Scores 18th No. 1 on Latin Airplay</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.billboard.com/files/media/Ozuna-credit-pablo-diaz-bb27-2019-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg" alt="img">
&ldquo;To score 18 No. 1s on Latin Airplay is a great blessing,&rdquo; Ozuna tells Billboard.</p>
<p>As Ozuna’s “Fantasía” lifts 3-1 on the Latin Airplay chart (dated April 11), he nabs his 18th No. 1 and breaks away from a tie with Ricky Martin for the fourth-most leaders. He now trails only Enrique Iglesias (30 leaders), J Balvin (21) and Daddy Yankee (19).</p>
<p>“&lsquo;Fantasía&rsquo; is one of my favorite singles off NIBIRU,” Ozuna tells Billboard. “It’s a pleasant surprise to see that the song hits No. 1 on two Billboard charts. Likewise, to score 18 No. 1s on Latin Airplay is a great blessing. I‘m grateful for the love and support from my fans and all of those who listen to my music around the world.”</p>
<p>“Fantasía” eclipses Nicky Jam and Daddy Yankee’s one-week reign with “Muévelo” as it ascends with 16 million in audience impressions (up 24%) earned in the week ending April 5, according to Nielsen Music/MRC Data.</p>
<p>It earns Ozuna his first No. 1 of the year. He last took the crown when “Hasta Que Salga El Sol,” the fourth single from NIBIRU, landed atop the list in December.</p>
<p>Beyond the song&rsquo;s Latin Airplay coronation, “Fantasía” strikes an identical 3-1 hike on Latin Rhythm Airplay and earns Ozuna his 17th leader there.</p>
<p>“Fantasía” is the fifth single from NIBIRU, which opened at No. 1 on the Top Latin Albums chart dated Dec. 14.</p>
<p>“In these difficult times we are going through due to the pandemic, I urge everyone to take care of themselves,” Ozuna adds. “My heart and my prayers go out to all the countries that are currently going through this health crisis, which, trusting God, we will overcome soon.”</p>
<p>Pitbull, Ne-Yo, Lenier &amp; El Micha Move: Farther down the Latin Airplay chart, Pitbull and Ne-Yo’s “Me Quedaré Contigo,” featuring Lenier and El Milcha, enters the top 10 in its 13th week, climbing 19-7.</p>
<p>It’s the third charting collaboration by Pitbull and Ne-Yo, which began in 2011 when “Give Me Everything,” which also features Afrojack and Nayer, hit No. 1 in June 2016. The former six-week ruler earned Ne-Yo his first leader on the tally. Prior to “Me Quedaré,” the two collaborators scored a No. 18 peak with “Time of Our Lives” in April 2015.</p>
<p>“Me Quedaré” advances to the top 10 thanks to a lofty 41% boost in audience (up 9.1 million). It earns Pitbull his 17th top 10, Ne-Yo his second, while Lenier and El Micha clock their first.</p>
<p>Concurrently, the tune moves to No. 6 on Latin Pop Airplay.
