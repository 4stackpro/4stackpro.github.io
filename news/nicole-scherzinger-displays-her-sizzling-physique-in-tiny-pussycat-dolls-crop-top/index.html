<p>Nicole and British boyfriend Thom Evans left the UK from Gatwick Airport in March, shortly after Britain entered government mandated lockdown.</p>

<p>She captioned the video: &lsquo;Alright #MondayMotivation&hellip; who’s ready to jazzercise with me??&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nicole&rsquo;s video was reminiscent of Christine and Paddy McGuinness&rsquo; 80s style workout last week as they also took part in the Blinding Lights challenge.</p>
<p>Showing off their synchronised moves, the video ended with Christine jumping into Paddy&rsquo;s arms as she kicked her leg in the air and threw her head back.</p>

<p>Nicole has been loving life in isolation with her boyfriend Thom Evans, taking things to the next level after meeting on The X Factor: Celebrity last year.</p>
<p>The Pussycat Doll and rugby star, 35, gazed at one another in the adorable video as they sang Shania Twain&rsquo;s You&rsquo;re Still The One to mark his birthday.</p>
<p>Nicole and Thom couldn&rsquo;t take their eyes off each other as they performed the harmonies in the romantic ballad.</p>
<p>As they reached the end of the song, Nicole leaned in for a kiss as she said: &lsquo;Happy birthday baby.&rsquo;

<p>“I was watching, with my nieces this week, a movie — it’s called UglyDolls,” the Pussycat Dolls singer begins in the clip. “One of the characters, the UglyDoll, says, ‘Let your freak flag fly!’ And I was like, oh my God, how do I know ‘freak flag fly?’ And that was in her clue package last week.”</p>

<p>Fellow judge Robin Thicke admits he thought it could’ve been actress Roberts, 29, as well, but, “I think she might’ve just catnipped it in the bud.”</p>
<p>On Wednesday’s episode, Kitty goes up against Banana, Frog and Rhino in hopes of getting one week closer to winning the Golden Mask. The Talk‘s Sharon Osbourne, whose daughter Kelly competed on the Fox singing competition as Ladybug in season 2, joins Ken Jeong, Jenny McCarthy, Scherzinger and Thicke as this week’s guest judge.</p>
<p>The Masked Singer airs Wednesdays (8 p.m. ET) on Fox.
