(CNN) China has ended its lockdown of Wuhan, the original epicenter of the coronavirus crisis , as the city reemerges from a deadly outbreak that is now raging across the globe.</p>
<p>But even as Wuhan reopens its borders after 76 days, some restrictions within the city will remain in place, and officials warn that the threat of further infections remains far from over.</p>
<p>The metropolis of 11 million, where the coronavirus was first detected in December, had been sealed off from the outside world since January 23 in an unprecedented effort to contain the outbreak.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, healthy residents and visitors will finally be allowed to leave Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, with trains and flights resumed and highway entrances reopened.</p>
<p>Wuhan&rsquo;s railway authority estimated more than 55,000 passengers will leave Wuhan by train Wednesday, with about 40% bound for the Pearl River Delta region, a major manufacturing hub in China, according to state broadcaster CCTV.</p>
<p>The easing of travel restrictions on Wuhan is the latest milestone in China&rsquo;s fight against Covid-19. The country reported nearly zero new local infections in recent weeks, leading to similar restrictive measures being lifted for other parts of Hubei province late last month.</p>
<p>Luo Ping, an epidemic control official in Wuhan, told CCTV Sunday that the lifting of the lockdown marks a &ldquo;full restart&rdquo; of the city&rsquo;s economic and social activities from their previous &ldquo;suspension.&rdquo; But he warned the city faces an arduous task preventing imported cases and a recurrence of local infections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After work and production resumed, the movement of people increased and so did the risk of cross-infections from mass gatherings. Some residents have dropped their guard and don&rsquo;t wear masks when they go on the streets,&rdquo; he told the broadcaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reopening of Wuhan does not mean the all-clear, neither does it mean a relaxing of epidemic prevention and control measures (within the city),&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Passengers wear facemasks as they form a queue at the Wuhan Wuchang Railway Station in Wuhan, early on April 8, as they prepare to leave the city for the first time in more than ten weeks.</p>
<p>A city brought to a halt</p>
<p>Wuhan, a sprawling industrial hub on the banks of the Yangtze River, reported more than 50,000 infections and over 2,500 deaths, accounting for 77% of all coronavirus deaths across China, according to the National Health Commission.</p>
<p>As the outbreak swept the city, much of Wuhan was brought to a halt by strict epidemic control measures &ndash; some of which would later be introduced throughout the world as the virus spread to more than 200 countries and territories, infecting more than 1.4 million people worldwide</p>
<p>For more than two months, public transport in Wuhan was suspended, businesses were shut and millions of residents were confined to their homes and residential communities &ndash; not even allowed to go outside for grocery shopping.</p>
<p>The draconian measures apparently worked. By mid-March, the number of new infections had slowed to a trickle from thousands per day at its worst in February. In a major show of confidence, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Wuhan on March 10, praising the city and its people for being &ldquo;heroic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People stand near the Yangtze River in the city of Wuhan, on April 6. In recent weeks, officials have gradually eased some of the lockdown measures, allowing a limited number of residents to leave their residential compounds for a short time.</p>
<p>A degree of normalcy amid restrictions</p>
<p>Over the past two weeks, life in Wuhan has gradually gained some semblance of normality.</p>
<p>Residents with a government-assigned green QR code on their mobile phones &ndash; meaning they&rsquo;re healthy and safe to travel &ndash; have been allowed to go back to work as long as their employers issue them a letter.</p>
<p>In residential communities where no new cases have been reported for 14 days, one person per household with a green QR code can leave the compounds two hours per day.</p>
<p>On March 25, public buses started to resume service; three days later, underground trains began running too. Businesses and shops gradually reopened, and cars and pedestrians returned to the city&rsquo;s once-deserted streets.</p>
<p>Luo, the Wuhan official, told CCTV that 10,641 large-scale factories and businesses in the city have reopened as of April 3, accounting for 91.4% of the total.</p>
<p>On Monday, there was even a long line outside the Wuhan Blood Center, following a call from the municipal government for citizens to donate their blood, the state-run People&rsquo;s Daily reported. The center received 874 donors in a day, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>But officials warned that the restrictions on residential communities will remain in place after the lockdown is lifted on Wednesday.</p>
<p>To leave their compounds, residents still need to produce a green QR code and a letter from their employer, Luo said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For now, we still call on citizens to remain vigilant on the epidemic, don&rsquo;t go out unless it&rsquo;s necessary, and wear masks and properly protect yourself when you do,&rdquo; he told CCTV.</p>

<p>Threat of a return of the virus</p>
<p>Chinese health experts have also urged the public to continue to practice caution.</p>
<p>Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told the state-run Health Times on Thursday that China had not seen the end of the epidemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;China is not near the end, but has entered a new stage. With the global epidemic raging, China has not reached the end ,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>With the number of global infections continuing to surge, a growing number of cases have been imported back to China from overseas &ndash; many of them Chinese students and workers eager to return home.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, 698 imported coronavirus cases have been reported by Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>Concerns have also been growing in recent weeks over asymptomatic carriers.</p>
<p>In China, only patients showing symptoms and positive results in nucleic tests are included in the official tally of confirmed cases. Asymptomatic patients who have tested positive are monitored and placed under quarantine until they develop symptoms or turn negative in later tests.</p>
<p>Amid mounting public concerns, China started to announce a separate daily number of asymptomatic carriers last week. Since then, dozens of new asymptomatic carriers have been found in Wuhan everyday, with 673 currently under medical observation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although for now, it seems that the infectiousness of asymptomatic cases are relatively low, they are still infectious and we should be vigilant,&rdquo; Yang Jiong, a respiratory expert at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, told the Health Times on Monday.</p>

<p>Burying the dead</p>
<p>Apart from the easing of travel restrictions, there is another sign that Wuhan is starting to move on from the crisis: It has finally started to bury the dead.</p>
<p>For months, residents in Wuhan had been unable to bury their loved ones, as the government banned all funerals and closed cemeteries on January 25. The remains of thousands of people who died both from coronavirus and other causes were stored at funeral homes. Families were told to await government advice on when they could be collected.</p>
<p>Many would not get to see the body of their loved ones before cremation. To curb the spread of the virus, all bodies of confirmed and suspected coronavirus patients were taken directly from hospitals to funeral homes for cremation, according to a notice issued by the National Health Commission.</p>
<p>Like everything else in the city, the normal process for dealing with grief was put on hold.</p>
<p>In late March, Wuhan residents were finally able to retrieve the ashes of their relatives from funeral homes and find them a resting place, reported the state-run Changjiang Daily, citing an official from the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>The news came just ahead of the Ching Ming, also known as Tomb Sweeping Day, the most important Chinese festival for honoring the dead.</p>
<p>Funeral ceremonies are still not permitted. It is not clear what rituals family members are allowed to observe when laying their loved ones to rest.

<h3 id="prestigious-scientific-panel-tells-white-house-coronavirus-wont-go-away-with-warmer-weather">Prestigious scientific panel tells White House coronavirus won&rsquo;t go away with warmer weather</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200406144729-coronavirus-mask-california-0318-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) A prestigious scientific panel told the White House Tuesday that it doesn&rsquo;t look like coronavirus will go away once the weather warms up. President Trump has claimed that &ldquo;when it gets a little warmer [the virus] miraculously goes away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In their letter to the White House, members of a National Academy of Sciences committee said data is mixed on whether coronavirus spreads as easily in warm weather as it does in cold weather, but that it might not matter much given that so few people in the world are immune to coronavirus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is some evidence to suggest that [coronavirus] may transmit less efficiently in environments with higher ambient temperature and humidity; however, given the lack of host immunity globally, this reduction in transmission efficiency may not lead to a significant reduction in disease spread without the concomitant adoption of major public health interventions,&rdquo; according to the letter.</p>
<p>The letter noted, for example, that a study of the outbreak in China showed that even under maximum temperature and humidity conditions, the virus spread &ldquo;exponentially,&rdquo; with every infected person spreading it to nearly two other people on average.</p>
<p>Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, who is not a member of the NAS committee, said, &ldquo;Although we can hope weather will make some contribution to the reduction in transmission, we can&rsquo;t rely on it alone. We have to continue to employ social distancing and other measures to reduce transmission.&rdquo;

<h3 id="the-nurses-risking-it-all-on-the-frontline-of-britains-coronavirus-outbreak">The nurses risking it all on the frontline of Britain&rsquo;s coronavirus outbreak</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200407095944-sean-white-rosana-josep-zaragoza-laura-duffell-nurses-split-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
London (CNN) It gets really, really hot inside the protective gear Sean White has to wear most of the time. His skin is sore from the tight-fitting face mask and two pairs of gloves worn almost non-stop for 12 hours at a time.</p>
<p>White is a critical care nurse at a major teaching hospital in London and &ndash; like nurses in almost every country around the world &ndash; he couldn&rsquo;t be any more frontline in the battle against coronavirus. His hospital is currently treating several hundred Covid-19 patients in the city at the epicenter of the UK outbreak, which has so far claimed more than 7,000 lives.</p>
<p>When coronavirus patients end up in hospital, it&rsquo;s nurses who care for them most of the time and who are responsible for making sure they receive the right treatment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is still this view that nurses, you know, are washing patients, feeding them and just being these compassionate, caring souls&hellip; which is exactly what nurses are, but there is this other layer of things that nurses do now,&rdquo; said Laura Duffell, a matron nurse at The Royal London Hospital.</p>
<p>White spends his working days taking care of people who are fighting for their lives. Patients are often on ventilators, suffering from multiple organ failure, sedated, with number of tubes attached to them. It&rsquo;s a high-pressure job, but he knows what he is doing &ndash; he has been doing it for years.</p>
<p>But in this crisis, White says even he is at his limits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re having to prioritize things, not do some of the other things that we normally do, we make changes to our normal practice,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>White checks patients&rsquo; oxygen levels, adjusts ventilators, runs blood tests, cleans wounds, replaces dressings, monitors tubes and takes care of sick people&rsquo;s mouths and eyes. Once every four hours, he moves them to prevent bed sores. He also reassures them when they wake up in a scary and unfamiliar environment.</p>
<p>At normal times, each nurse looks after one patient at a time. But these are not normal times. White has been deployed to other intensive care units (ICUs) and is now regularly juggling two patients. The plan is to go up to four if necessary, he says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are demanding patients,&rdquo; said Rosana Josep Zaragoza, a nurse working at Guy&rsquo;s Hospital in London, of ICU coronavirus cases. &ldquo;They might have eight infusions attached to their bed and you have to make sure they are not running out, that they are working properly, and you are dealing with a breathing machine and sometimes a kidney machine,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>At the same time, the nurses are very aware of the risk they themselves are facing. White said that he and his colleagues are wondering &ldquo;when, rather than if&rdquo; they catch the virus. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re hoping that it will be like a cold, but we keep hearing all the time of people who don&rsquo;t necessarily have health problems who have died,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>From left to right: Sean White, Rosana Josep Zaragoza and Laura Duffell are among the nurses on the frontline of this crisis.</p>
<p>Nursing exodus</p>
<p>The coronavirus crisis has hit the UK at the time when its public health system, the National Health Service, was already highly stretched because of the country&rsquo;s aging population and the spending cuts that followed the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p>Before the outbreak, a combination of tough conditions and low pay was leading to many nurses leaving the profession, according to the Royal College of Nursing (RNC). There are over 40,000 nurse vacancies across the UK, 10,000 of which are in London, says the RNC. At the same time, fewer young people are joining the pipeline because of cuts to training funding, it adds.</p>
<p>In the UK, nurses&rsquo; pre-tax salaries start just below £25,000 ($30,000) a year. That&rsquo;s £5,000 below the country&rsquo;s median salary. With more experience, pay for most can rise to around £37,000 ($45,535) a year, depending on seniority. The RNC said most nurses&rsquo; paychecks falls into that region. Nurses with advanced training &ndash; such as a master&rsquo;s degree &ndash; can make up to £44,503. Only matrons, chief nurses and specialized consultant nurses earn more than that.</p>
<p>For comparison, doctors start at £28,200 to £32,691 during the first two years after medical school, when they are still training. After that, their basic salary rises to £38,693 to £49,036 during specialist training. Once fully qualified and with years of experience, doctors in the public system can earn as much as £107,000.</p>
<p>White has been a frontline healthcare worker for a decade, and spent a big chunk of this time in critical care. He is planning to leave nursing after the coronavirus crisis has passed and work on building up his own business in medical aesthetics. While he will continue to work shifts in critical care to maintain his skills and fill in where the need is, his main focus will be elsewhere. A better work-life balance and the desire to do new things are among the reasons for his move, but money is also a factor.</p>
<p>Even though nurses based in London get extra cash to cover the city&rsquo;s higher cost of living, most end up living on very tight budgets. According to a RNC survey published in January, 26% of nurses in London said they were financially struggling and further 42% said they were just about able to meet essential living costs, but wouldn&rsquo;t be able to cope with any unexpected costs.</p>
<p>Long-term staff shortages are making the current crisis worse. There also aren&rsquo;t currently enough coronavirus tests for healthcare workers in the UK. This means that any time a hospital employee or a member of their household shows symptoms, they have to self-isolate and stop work &ndash; even if they don&rsquo;t actually have the disease. The government has been trying to ramp up testing and as of Wednesday, 20,000 UK health workers and their family members have been tested, the Prime Minister&rsquo;s spokesman said.</p>
<p>Duffell said the high cost of living in places like London forces people to live with roommates, further exacerbating the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many nurses will live with other healthcare professionals, partly because of the shift patterns and the understanding &hellip; and then &hellip; it means that if someone is then symptomatic, the whole household have to isolate, which means we have four [or] five nurses who are all off at the same time,&rdquo; Duffel said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a hideous situation&rsquo;</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic also means many nurses are being redeployed to departments they don&rsquo;t normally work in, including intensive and critical care.</p>
<p>Josep Zaragoza, the Guy&rsquo;s Hospital nurse, has found herself exactly in that position. She expects to start working in ICUs this week. And while she has worked there in the past, she hasn&rsquo;t done so in four years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am scared,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have been doing something completely different now, and obviously, ICU &hellip; it&rsquo;s a really specialized area and the patients are very sick, so you have to know what you&rsquo;re doing, the pressures are enormous,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Josep Zaragoza said her hospital has been providing nurses like her with refresher training and simulation days. She said she will likely get to spend two days at the ICU observing and working alongside other nurses before starting to take care of patients on her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it should be at least a week &hellip; but I understand that they need nurses up and running as soon as possible,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>Josep Zaragoza can rely on past experience, but many of her colleagues are being redeployed into jobs that are completely new to them. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine how nervous people are going into such a specialized area which they have never worked in,&rdquo; she said. A spokesperson from Guy&rsquo;s and St Thomas&rsquo; NHS Foundation Trust said the hospital has asked &ldquo;all clinical teams to be prepared for the potential redeployment,&rdquo; adding that temporarily redeployed staff &ldquo;will receive appropriate training and support if necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over at The Royal London, Duffell manages a team of around 50 to 60 nurses and healthcare assistants across several children&rsquo;s wards. Some of them are now being reassigned to positions in critical care, despite not having the training that is normally required for these roles.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Barts Health NHS Trust, the body that oversees the Royal London Hospital, said the hospital was &ldquo;working hard to while ensuring the safety of patients, staff and visitors.&rdquo; The spokeswomen referred to the hospital&rsquo;s peak operating plan, which says that &ldquo;large number of staff&rdquo; will be retrained and redeployed.</p>
<p>Duffell added: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a junior nurse in a flood of tears because she feels like she&rsquo;s putting people at risk and you have to have that conversation that actually, you&rsquo;re doing your absolute best, you rely on your knowledge and you know what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hideous situation and unfortunately, I think there are going to be a huge number of nurses that are going to be quite traumatized.&rdquo;
