Writer-producer Tyler Perry has helped ease the current financial burden of almost 3,000 seniors needing food.</p>
<p>The supermarket chain Kroger tweeted Wednesday, opening with an applause emoji, that &ldquo;@tylerperry paid it forward and purchased groceries for nearly 3,000 senior shoppers today at Kroger stores across Atlanta. You can see how much this means by the look on their faces,&rdquo; the company wrote, posting a photo of an emotionally overwhelmed older person pointing to the total of a register receipt. &ldquo;Thank you, Tyler, for your generosity!&rdquo; said Kroger.</p>
<p>NBC News added that the New Orleans born-and-raised Perry, 50, did similarly for seniors at 29 Winn-Dixie stores across Louisiana. Perry has not commented publicly.

<h3 id="tyler-perry-pays-for-groceries-during-senior-hour-mourns-crew-members-coronavirus-death">Tyler Perry pays for groceries during &lsquo;senior hour,&rsquo; mourns crew member&rsquo;s coronavirus death</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/03/05/PIND/47a3c851-2680-4ad4-bf3b-540e5c2be38f-14SPRINGTYLER_1.jpg?crop=1612,907,x0,y0&amp;width=1612&amp;height=907&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" alt="img">
Tyler Perry is making a statement after revealing one of his crew members died from coronavirus.</p>
<p>In an Instagram post Wednesday, Perry shared a series of photos of Charles Gregory, a hairstylist who worked with the comedian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today it’s with a heavy heart that I inform you of the passing of one of our crew members. Mr. Charles Gregory was a hairstylist that had worked with us for many years. The man was warm, loving and hilarious. We all loved to see him coming and hear his laughter,&rdquo; Perry wrote. &ldquo;Charles lost his battle with COVID-19 today. It saddens me to think of him dying this way. My sincerest prayers are with his family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perry urged black people to take the virus seriously, as it is killing them at higher rates compared with other Americans in some major cities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard a black person say, &lsquo;Black people don’t get it.&rsquo; That is a lie! You can get it, and you will get it if we don’t do what we&rsquo;re being told to do,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;A 26 year old black woman died the other day, a 44 year old black man died the other day, not to mention the hundreds of people that are dying every few minutes. Your age does not matter!! Your health does not matter. You could be totally healthy, and you could die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;A Fall from Grace&rdquo; director encouraged people to socially distance and do everything they could to stay safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, please, please, I beg you to take this seriously. You have to socially distance yourself. That means stop hanging out, stop congregating, stop doing anything that will put not only your life in danger but also the lives of so many others,&rdquo; Perry wrote.</p>
<p>Perry&rsquo;s PSA comes shortly after he paid for people&rsquo;s groceries during senior shopping hours.</p>
<p>Lori Freehling fully expected to pay for her groceries Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>So when she found out at the register that her total was being covered by renowned actor and director Perry, a New Orleans native, Freehling couldn&rsquo;t help but shed a tear or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said, &lsquo;He just paid for your groceries as his random act of kindness,&rsquo; &quot; Freehling wrote in a Facebook post. &quot; &lsquo;Really?&rsquo; I said as my eyes teared up, thanking her as she handed my my receipt. Thank you Tyler Perry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Call it a hometown discount.</p>
<p>Perry paid it forward at 29 Winn-Dixie stores across Louisiana and at 44 Kroger stores in Atlanta, where Perry resides, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.</p>

<p>The act of charity was held during the stores&rsquo; senior hours, when older citizens who are more susceptible to COVID-19 are able to shop by themselves.</p>
<p>Floored by the generosity, Freehling took the money she would have spent and followed Perry&rsquo;s example.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To pay it forward, I made a donation in your honor to Second Harvest Food Bank for what would have been the cost of my groceries today,&rdquo; Freehling wrote.</p>

<p>Perry, the mind behind the popular &ldquo;Madea&rdquo; movies, is no stranger to generosity. Perry paid of nearly $500,000 in layaway balances at Atlanta-area Walmarts in 2018.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s also not the only New Orleans native to give back during the pandemic. Former NFL quarterback Peyton Manning donated an undisclosed amount to United Way of Southeast Louisiana&rsquo;s Hospitality Cares Pandemic Response Fund, according to WGNO.

<h3 id="charles-gregory-ross-dies-of-covid-19-ava-duvernay-tyler-perry-lee-daniels-viola-davis-and-more-pay-tribute-to-legendary-hairstylist">Charles Gregory Ross Dies Of COVID-19: Ava DuVernay, Tyler Perry, Lee Daniels, Viola Davis And More Pay Tribute To Legendary Hairstylist</h3>
<p><img src="https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/charles-gregory-ross.jpg?w=1000" alt="img">
Ava DuVernay, Tyler Perry, Viola Davis, Lee Daniels and many more industry luminaries today paid tribute to Charles Gregory Ross after the Emmy-nominated hairstylist lost his battle with coronavirus yesterday.</p>
<p>“God bless you and keep you in His Kingdom forever,” DuVernay said of Ross, who she most recently worked with on her HBO Max DMZ pilot earlier this year. “You lit up every room you entered and every path you crossed. Thank you for your warmth and your wisdom and your wonderful spirit. Please watch over us and keep loving us. We will keep loving you and will never forget you. Your memory will be our blessing.”</p>
<p>As America and most of the world are in lockdown against the global pandemic, Ross died on Wednesday in Atlanta just over two weeks from first testing positive for COVID-19 – a fact he shared online.</p>

<p>Ross was a renowned hairstylist, working on an impressive list of films including Remember the Titans (2000) and Drumline (2002). He also worked on the Outkast musical drama Idlewild (2006) as well as the TV movie Lackawanna Blues (2005), for which he received an Emmy nomination. Other credits include the TV series Red Band Society and Survivor’s Remorse as well as features All Eyez on Me and Janicza Bravo’s Zola, which debuted at Sundance earlier this year. His work can also be seen in Lee Daniels’ forthcoming film The United States vs. Billie Holiday.</p>
<p>Daniels remembered Ross yesterday on his Instagram:</p>
<p>Among his many credits, Ross worked extensively with Tyler Perry on many of his films and TV series including House of Pain, Madea Goes to Jail, Meet the Browns and was part of the Academy Award-winning team for the Adam McKay helmed Vice, where he served as Perry’s personal hairstylist.</p>
<p>With the increasing news of the black community being disproportionately impacted by coronavirus, Perry took to Instagram to honor Ross:</p>
<p>Oscar winner Viola Davis paid a very personal tribute to Ross on April 8 also:</p>
<p>Taraji P Henson, Kerry Washington, Octavia Spencer, Angela Rye, Tina Lawson, Rosario Dawson, Tyrese Gibson, Tichina Arnold and many others also commented on social media to honor Ross, as you can see in the posts above.</p>
<p>R.I.P. Mr. Ross.
