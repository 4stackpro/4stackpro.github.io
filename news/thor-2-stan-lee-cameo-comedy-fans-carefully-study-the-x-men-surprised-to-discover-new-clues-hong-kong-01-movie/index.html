由Alan Taylor執導；基斯咸士禾夫（Chris Hemsworth）、妮坦莉寶雯（Natalie Portman）及湯赫度斯頓（Tom Hiddleston）主演的《雷神奇俠2：黑暗世界》（Thor: The Dark World），是Marvel電影宇宙的第八部作品。可是電影在2013年上映至今，受到不少批評，早前還有粉絲認為這電影是MCU最差。其實都有許多網民為此平反，還解釋電影隱藏了變種特攻的線索。</p>
<p>早前有網民指《雷神奇俠2》是MCU最差的電影，有粉絲即時為雷神平反。（《雷神奇俠2：黑暗世界》劇照）</p>
<p>《鐵甲奇俠》都有伏線</p>
<p>迪士尼去年成功收購FOX，讓後者旗下的Marvel版權終於回到Marvel Studios手上。Marvel Studios總裁Kevin Feige在去年的聖地亞哥國際漫畫展上，確認變種特攻將加入MCU。奈何當時時間不足夠，未能談及變種特攻會在甚麼時候登場。然而，在迪士尼仍未成功收購FOX前，其實Kevin Feige都曾有意無意地把變種特攻的彩蛋加到Marvel電影宇宙。最著名是在2008年上映的《鐵甲奇俠》（Iron Man），當時電影曾提及SR-71黑鳥式偵察機（SR-71 Blackbird）。而在1977年發行的原著漫畫《Uncanny X-Men》第104期開始，SR-71黑鳥式偵察機就一直與變種特攻有關連。</p>
<p>SR-71黑鳥式偵察機一直與變種特攻有關連，而當時在《鐵甲奇俠》已經有伏筆。（《鐵甲奇俠》影片擷圖）</p>
<p>另外，在Marvel Studios官方公開的《鐵甲奇俠》刪剪片段中，當時Nick Fury曾跟Tony Stark提及「Gamma Accidents」（伽瑪事故）、「Radioactive Bug Bites」（輻射蟲咬傷）及「Assorted Mutants」（各種的異變人）。而這三件事分別對表的超級英雄就是變形俠醫、蜘蛛俠及變種特攻。</p>
<p>Kevin Feige曾公開《鐵甲奇俠》的刪剪片尾，當時Nick Fury曾提及異變人及蜘蛛俠。（《美國隊長3：英雄內戰》劇照）</p>
<p>「Marvel之父」成彩蛋中的彩蛋</p>
<p>然而在《雷神奇俠2》中，原來戲中有一個隱藏彩蛋與超強異變人有莫大關係。當時天體科學家Erik Selvig在向一群囚犯解釋，五千年才會發生一次的宇宙九界串連成直線的現象「聚合」（Convergence）。「Marvel之父」Stan Lee當時都出場，他待Erik Selvig問「有甚麼問題嗎？」（Any questions?）後，即刻回答「有問題！可以把鞋退還給我嗎？」（Yeah, can I have my shoe back?）。當時影迷都以為這幕純粹是笑話，可是，原來在黑板上，有讓人意想不到的線索。</p>
<p>由Stellan Skarsgård飾演的Erik Selvig，其角色看似「無厘頭」，但卻對Marvel電影宇宙有重要作用。（《雷神奇俠2：黑暗世界》劇照）</p>
<ul>
<li>9 + 8 + 7</li>
</ul>
<p>當時黑板雜亂無章地介紹了Marvel宇宙觀，其中一種現象名為「The Fault」（斷層）。在Marvel漫畫事件簿中，「The Fault」是Shi&rsquo;ar族與詭族（Kree）大戰結束時所創造。當時Shi&rsquo;ar族被終極異變人（Omega Mutant）Vulcan入侵，並引發一場銀河戰爭。在Shi&rsquo;ar族與詭族的最終一戰中，Vulcan與異人族（Inhumans）的黑蝠王（Black Bolt）單挑，當時詭族引爆了T-Bomb，並在時空結構中炸問了一個洞，形成「The Fault」，而這地方還可以通往扭曲領域Cancerverse。</p>
<p>除了「The Fault」外，Erik Selvig還介紹了「616 Universe」，這詞語在原著漫畫《The Daredevils》第7期出現，被Opal Luna Saturnyne稱為Otherworld（異世界）。另有「The Crossroads」，這詞彙在原著漫畫《Incredible Hulk》第300期出現，是通向其他世界的門戶。最後「The Nexus of All Realities」，則聯想到Man-Thing。

<h3 id="x-men-the-new-mutants-5-movies-like-it">‘X-Men: The New Mutants’: 5 Movies Like It</h3>
<p><img src="https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/31a/95d/e6fe5ec266a6a4b841a8ce24d2bfdadebb-chronicle.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg" alt="img">

<p>In a different reality, we’d right now be in the midst of Hollywood’s blockbuster season, enjoying the nearly weekly unveiling of a major-event movie, including much-anticipated sequels (F9) and new installments of beloved properties (No Time to Die). Instead, well, you’re cooped up in your place trying to figure out what to watch while not going stir-crazy.</p>
<p>This is where we come in. On a regular basis, we’ll be presenting “The Replacements”: a list of five alternative choices for every big tentpole you’d been excited to see before COVID-19 changed our lives. We’ll select movies that are thematically or narratively similar to the postponed blockbuster, offering picks that range from cool obscurities to certifiable classics to forgotten gems. For the time being, event movies are on hold. But hopefully our alternatives will help scratch that cinematic itch.</p>
<p>This week: The New Mutants, a spinoff from the X-Men franchise that’s been delayed several times. Initially slotted for an April 2018 release, this horror film got pushed back to February 2019 … and then August 2019 … and then April 3, 2020 … and now, well, who knows in our current pandemic? After the creative and commercial disaster of last year’s Dark Phoenix, audiences may not be ready for more mutants anytime soon, but this film stars Maisie Williams, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Charlie Heaton as a collection of young people being held captive by Alice Braga, who’s studying their untapped powers. Will The New Mutants be able to overcome its poisonously bad buzz? We have no idea, but in the meantime, let us recommend five replacements that might tide you over — and, to be honest, might end up being better.</p>
<p>Firestarter (1984)</p>
<p>In the peak era of quickie Stephen King adaptations, 1984’s Firestarter tells the story of a little girl with pyrokinetic abilities (that means she can set things on fire with her mind) trying to escape an evil government agency with her father (David Keith). The thing is, though, is that you do not want to anger the little girl, particularly when she’s played by a Drew Barrymore, who’s already eager to show she’s more than just little Gertie. The movie gets a boost from its very hammy villains (Martin Sheen and a wildly over-the-top George C. Scott), and while it can be a little conventional at times, its story of a child attempting to wrangle her overwhelming powers is surely a major theme of The New Mutants.</p>
<p>The Incredibles (2004)</p>
<p>Often, movies about young people with superpowers are dark, tormented affairs; they’re metaphors for adolescent hormones and teenage insecurities. Then there’s The Incredibles, an altogether joyous story about the Parr family, who have tried to live like ordinary people, but that’s impossible because they’re not like you and me. With its cool retro-futuristic design and jazzy score, writer-director Brad Bird’s first Pixar effort — after The Iron Giant and his long association with The Simpsons — stylishly presaged the Marvel/DC blockbuster era, making superpowers look like an absolute blast. Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack are a far cry from the miserable mutants of The New Mutants — the worst they have to do is hide their true nature from the public — and The Incredibles’ giddy action and heartwarming exploration of family make this ideal all-ages viewing.</p>
<p>Chronicle (2012)</p>
<p>The premise of Chronicle — three teenagers accidentally develop superpowers and have to deal with both those and the horrors of being a teenager — sounds gimmicky, especially when you add in a found-footage format. But Josh Trank’s powerful concept thriller has more on its mind than that, as it grows progressively darker as it moves along, with the picked-on Andrew developing his powers in a different, more dangerous way than his more popular cohorts. This was the movie that made you think Dane DeHaan was going to be a huge star (that turned out to be reserved for Michael B. Jordan) and seemed to map Trank as a director to watch. That ended with his disastrous Fantastic Four, but still, this story of the dangers of too much power given to the too-inexperienced and callow resonates in a way The New Mutants will be lucky to approach.</p>
<p>The Witch (2015)</p>
<p>Not yet 24, Taylor-Joy has been on a hot streak for about five years. (For most anyone else, graduating to an X-Men movie would seem like a huge step up. But at this point, The New Mutants needs her more than she needs it.) The star of Split and Thoroughbreds showed a different side this year with the new adaptation of Emma., but if you never saw her breakthrough, then it’s time to check her out in the movie that was also Lighthouse filmmaker Robert Eggers’s coming-out party. The Witch is a supernatural shocker rich in atmosphere and period detail, studying a Puritan family in 17th-century New England that lives out in the woods alone. Suddenly, strange things start occurring, and after Thomasin’s (Taylor-Joy) baby brother is kidnapped and killed, they wonder if satanic happenings are afoot. Taylor-Joy unleashed her slow-burn, edgy intensity for the first time here, and her character is our guide through The Witch’s suffocating unease. The New Mutants is billed as a horror movie, but it’ll be a tall order to top this supreme chiller.</p>
<p>Deadpool 2 (2018)</p>
<p>This might be a little bit of a cheat, considering at one point Deadpool and his cohorts actually visit the X-Men campus and (almost) interact with some of the crew. But the irony of a film with a main character who has a lot of disdain for the X-Men is that Deadpool 2 is, in many ways, sort of like Professor Xavier: It’s all about an older mentor (albeit an unconventional one!) helping younger kids understand and control their powers … and provide them a community of their own at last. Sure, Deadpool might not be the gentlest father figure, but he’s a little softer in this sequel … almost at times Xavier-esque. He even sits in his chair!</p>

<h3 id="everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-messy-x-men-timeline-after-dark-phoenix-explained">Everything You Need to Know About the Messy ‘X-Men’ Timeline After ‘Dark Phoenix,’ Explained</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/x-men-dark-phoenix-crazy-timeline-stuff-mystique-death.jpg" alt="img">
(We spoil the entire ending of “Dark Phoenix” here, and since this is about the full franchise we’ll also have spoilers for the rest of the “X-Men” movies as well)</p>
<p>Folks didn’t exactly flock to theaters to catch “X-Men: Dark Phoenix” when it came out last summer, but with the COVID-19 pandemic ruining everything, and “Dark Phoenix” hitting HBO, people are finally catching up with the end of main series of Fox’s “X-Men” movies.</p>
<p>It’s only the end of this whole thing because of the Disney-Fox merger, of course — “X-Men: Dark Phoenix” actually ends on a somewhat ambiguous note, rather than the sort of definitive conclusion you’d generally expect from the end of a two-decade series. And no, that’s not because the spinoff “New Mutants” will someday be actually released, despite all the delays. Or because a third “Deadpool” film starring Ryan Reynolds would seem to be a certainty though there hasn’t been any movement on that front in forever. (Either way, the “Deadpool” films are pretty much their own thing, connecting to the “X-Men” film series usually just to make jokes.)</p>
<p>“New Mutants,” as far as we can tell, won’t feature any character from the other Fox “X-Men” films. And as for post-“Dark Phoenix,” since Disney now owns 20th Century Fox, Marvel almost certainly intends to introduce the main X-Men into the Marvel Cinematic Universe at some point, and it’s unlikely they’re gonna keep going with these actors playing these characters — unless they really wanna get into that whole multiverse thing that was teased in both “Avengers: Endgame” and “Spider-Man: Far From Home.”</p>
<p>So it’s time to say goodbye to a franchise that kicked off nearly 20 years ago — and more importantly, to a crazy timeline built up over the years that makes it hard as hell to nail down what the story even is.</p>
<p>That difficulty stems from two factors: The fact that “X-Men: Days of Future Past” included an in-universe soft reboot of the franchise using time travel, a la the JJ Abrams “Star Trek”; and the series’ general lack of concern with maintaining its continuity as it began doing prequels with “First Class.” All we can say with absolute certainty is that the main continuity is probably everything except the “Deadpool” films and “Logan.”</p>
<p>Also Read: All 57 Marvel Movies Ranked, Including &lsquo;X-Men: Dark Phoenix&rsquo;</p>
<p>So let’s talk about the time travel thing first, since it’s the biggest issue that throws people off. The original film timeline, in chronological order, prior to “Days of Future Past,” went like this: “First Class” -&gt; X-Men Origins: Wolverine” -&gt; “X-Men” -&gt; “X2” -&gt; “The Last Stand” -&gt; “The Wolverine.” There are plenty of weird continuity issues among those movies, but those films made up one long story.</p>
<p>The frame story of “Days of Future Past,” set in an apocalyptic future in which the sentinel robots have destroyed the world in their quest to eliminate all mutants, takes place at the end of that timeline, several years after “The Wolverine.” In that terrible future, they send Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back in time to 1973 to try to prevent that robot apocalypse from happening, and he succeeds.</p>
<p>The net effect there is that everything that took place after 1973 was wiped from history, and the following decades were very different from what they were in the original “X-Men” movies. The events of “Apocalypse,” for example, occurred because the existence of mutants became widespread much earlier than it had in the previous timeline, and that in turn set in motion the chain of events that brought En Sabah Nur (Oscar Isaac) back to wreak havoc on the world.</p>
<p>Also Read: All 12 &lsquo;X-Men&rsquo; Movies Ranked, From Worst to Best (Photos)</p>
<p>Likewise, Jean Grey’s whole Dark Phoenix situation happened differently after Wolverine’s journey through time. The prerequisite scenario for Jean to go Phoenix is that she has to either die or be put in a situation where she’s going to die — in the old timeline that happened in 2003 at the end of “X2,” and in the new timeline that happened in 1992.</p>
<p>So to be perfectly clear: none of the events of the original three “X-Men” movies are going to take place after “Dark Phoenix.” By going back in time and changing things, he created a new future. So Mystique dying in 1992, for example, doesn’t contradict the original films in which she was alive later on, because those movies didn’t happen in this timeline. The new sequence of events is: “First Class” -&gt; the 1973 parts of “Days of Future Past” -&gt; “Apocalypse” -&gt; “Dark Phoenix.”</p>
<p>That’s the basic gist of it, though the movies haven’t been all that great at keeping their continuity straight otherwise, but most of the screwups come from characters being the wrong ages in different films. For example, the character Moira McTaggart features in both “X-Men: The Last Stand” (played by Olivia Williams) and “First Class” (played by Rose Byrne). Both actors were in their 30s when their respective movies were released — but the two films are set 44 years apart.</p>
<p>Also Read: &lsquo;Dark Phoenix&rsquo; Film Review: X-Men Saga Wraps Up With Overly Familiar, Mediocre Sequel</p>
<p>The “X-Men” movies are rife with that specific type of continuity goof because they kept re-using characters from the original films in movies set decades earlier even when that didn’t make sense — Angel, Jubilee and Psylocke being some other prominent examples. It was also amusing to see the character of Trask, played by Bill Duke in “The Last Stand,” be recast in “Days of Future Past” with Peter Dinklage. Obviously those two look nothing alike, but that’s not actually a continuity error since their ages do match up well enough.</p>
<p>Adding to the confusion a bit is the fact that James McAvoy, Jennifer Lawrence, Michael Fassbender and Nicholas Hoult are all playing characters who have aged 30 years across the films they starred in, even though in the real world less than a decade has passed. Hoult is still a few months short of his 30th birthday, but in “Dark Phoenix” he’s playing a character who’s in his 60s without the aid of makeup to age him up. That kind of thing can mess with your head.</p>
<p>Of course, “Dark Phoenix” goes out on a note that may throw one last wrench into the messy continuity of the “X-Men” films. At the end of the movie, Jean takes full control of her Phoenix powers and is seen flying around in space, with Xavier’s school now called the Jean Grey School, and Professor X implied to have left the school with Hank McCoy to run.</p>

<p>In “Days of Future Past” we get a glimpse of what the new version of 2023 will look like when Wolverine returns to the updated version of his present at the very end of the movie. We see Jean hanging around the school, with Xavier in charge. A lot can happen in three decades that could still bring that future to fruition, but with this main series ended now it’s tough to draw a line from what happened at the end of “Dark Phoenix” to where “Days of Future Past” shows everybody ending up.</p>
<p>That that means that “Dark Phoenix” may or may not have introduced some massive new continuity errors to the series, and we’ll never get to find out because there aren’t going to be any more movies that follow this thread. To me, that sort of timeline ambiguity is the perfect way to end this whole thing.
