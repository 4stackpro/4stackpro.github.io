<p>The number of coronavirus cases in Kenya increased to 142 after 16 people tested positive.</p>
<p>Health Chief Administrative Secretary Mercy Mwangangi on Sunday said the new patients include 15 Kenyans and a Nigerian.</p>
<p>She said the 16 people have been moved into isolation in various facilities and contact tracing is ongoing. The ages of the confirmed cases range between 22 to 66 years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have so far monitored 1,833 contacts and out of this number 1,384 have been discharged. Currently, there are 449 contacts that we are actively tracing,&rdquo; Dr Mwangangi said.</p>
<p>The government has directed families of patients who succumb to coronavirus to bury kin within 24 hours; mourners restricted to 15.</p>
<p>The 16 cases were discovered after the ministry conducted tests on 530 samples. Nine of those who tested positive were from quarantine facilities, while seven were from contact tracing; 11 patients had travel history while five were infected locally.</p>

<p>EXPLOITING KENYANS</p>
<p>Dr Mwangangi said that of the positive cases, 12 are from Nairobi, three from Mombasa and one from Kilifi. Nine are males while seven are females.</p>
<p>She urged Kenyans visiting public places, such as supermarkets, to wear face masks to reduce virus transmission. She said once the masks and other equipment are ready, they will be distributed at county level through various organised groups like matatu saccos.

<h3 id="6-year-old-dies-of-coronavirus-in-kenya">6-year-old dies of coronavirus in Kenya</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.monitor.co.ug/image/view/-/5513874/medRes/2593986/-/r9o5xh/-/world01pix.jpg" alt="img">
By DAILY NATION</p>
<p>The administration of Kenyatta National Hospital is isolating and testing patients and healthcare workers who were in the intensive care unit following the death of a six-year-old child from Covid-19.</p>
<p>The boy, who had chronic anaemia, succumbed to the disease on Wednesday, raising the number of people who have died of the coronavirus to four.</p>
<p>Health minister Mutahi Kagwe, in a speech read by Chief Administrative Secretary Mercy Mwangangi, said that 122 people had tested positive for Covid-19.</p>
<p>This was after another 12 people tested positive Friday from the 362 samples analysed in the preceding 24 hours.</p>
<p>Dr Patrick Amoth, the director-general of health, said the ward where the boy was admitted would be disinfected.</p>
<p>Dr Amoth stressed the need for social distancing, the directive that people should stay away from groups and from each other.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>VARYING EFFECTS</p>
<p>The hospital has not been forthcoming on the number of healthcare workers who have been asked to self-quarantine, but it is estimated that more than 10 registrars (masterâ€™s students) who had attended to the child will be asked to go into quarantine.</p>
<p>The isolation comes at a time when there are complaints by healthcare workers over the lack of protective gear to handle Covid-19.</p>
<p>Questions have also been raised about the preparedness of healthcare workers in sorting out patients with acute respiratory illnesses, such as pneumonia.</p>
<p>Those who contract Covid-19 experience the disease in different ways: one, the sub-clinical and asymptomatic, meaning those who have the virus but do not present any symptoms, and, two, those who get infected in the upper respiratory tract, who are easier to treat; then there are those that develop pneumonia, fall very sick and need assistance in breathing through ventilators.</p>
<p>Dr Amoth said healthcare workers have been trained on triage, a medical term that refers to modalities used to choose which patient to attend to first.</p>
<p>Some hospitals have decided to treat pneumonia as a potential Covid-19 until lab tests rule out the virus.</p>
<p>HIGH RISK PATIENTS</p>
<p>Covid-19 seems to have largely spared children, but nobody knows why.</p>
<p>The World Health Organisation warns that the elderly and people with a history of immunity-compromising conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes and heart problems, are more likely to experience severe cases of Covid-19.</p>
<p>A tent has been set up at the entrance to Nakuru Level Five Hospital, where patients with acute respiratory infections are triaged.</p>
<p>Dr Joseph Mburu, the Medical Superintendent at the hospital, told the Saturday Nation that a clinical officer records a patientâ€™s history, which includes travel, and carries out physical examination.

<p><img src="https://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mercy-Mwangangi-1.jpg" alt="img">
Move over Chilobae! Kenyans seem to have found a new catch, who is keeping them glued to their television screens while self-isolating due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>And it is none other than Health Chief Administrative Secretary Dr Mercy Mwangangi.</p>
<p>Dr Mwangangi addressed the nation on Thursday afternoon for the first time where she announced three new confirmed coronavirus cases, bringing the total number to 31.</p>
<p>Her appearance was a breath of fresh air to a section of Kenyans, compared to the past briefings by Health CS Mutahi Kagwe.</p>
<p>Kenyans could not help but shower praises to Ms Mwangangi, as they noted how articulate, sharp and of course beautiful she is.</p>
<p>Below are some of their comments:</p>
