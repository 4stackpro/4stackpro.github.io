THE SCHEME (2020) 9 p.m. on HBO. In 2017, the N.B.A. scout Christian Dawkins — along with several assistant coaches and Adidas executives — was arrested by the F.B.I., after a two-year investigation into a collegiate basketball scandal. In 2019, Dawkins was found by a New York jury to be guilty of bribery and conspiracy to commit bribery. This feature details the scandal and the investigation, including interviews with Dawkins, his parents, his lawyer and two journalists.</p>
<p>THE POLIO CRUSADE: AMERICAN EXPERIENCE 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings.) Partly based on the book “Polio: An American Story” by David Oshinsky, this feature documents the state of the nation during the polio outbreak of the 1940s-50s. Easily transmissible and potentially resulting in paralysis or death, polio and the threat of its contagion gripped the country until the Salk vaccines were tested in 1954. This program includes interviews with people who had polio and the only scientist still alive who worked on the vaccine.

THE RM250bil economic stimulus package has been generally well-received by the public including industry leaders.</p>
<p>Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers Penang branch chairman Datuk Dr Ooi Eng Hock said the measure was good, provided the country has strong financial capability.</p>
<p>“At least, the package can stimulate the growth of our country’s economic performance, ” said Ooi.</p>
<p>“It also enables the people to feel comfortable and help each other in this difficult period, ” he added.</p>
<p>Ooi, however, said he was worried that the nation’s economy would be hit hard if the virus crisis is prolonged.</p>
<p>“The Malaysian Government must be able to spur the economy once the crisis is over, ” he said.</p>
<p>Malaysian Association of Hoteliers Penang Chapter chairman Khoo Boo Lim described the economic stimulus package as a ‘people’s incentive’.</p>
<p>He added that he was glad that individuals and businesses would receive 15% to 50% electricity bill discounts.</p>
<p>“Many hotels in Penang are in dire straits as they are running on low occupancy.</p>
<p>“The incentive helps them to ride out this crisis to a certain extent.</p>
<p>The incentive will help hotels ride out the crisis, says Khoo.</p>
<p>“Electricity bills form a big percentage of hotels’ operation expenditure, ” he said.</p>
<p>Consumers Association of Penang president Mohideen Abdul Kadir said the package looked good on paper but a great challenge lay ahead for the Government in implementing it.</p>
<p>He said there would be questions on how the aid would reach the target groups, adding that the distribution must be open and transparent.</p>
<p>“Civil societies must be able to monitor how this large sum of money is going to be channelled properly and to whom the money is being sent, ” he said.</p>
<p>He said the Government should ensure the mechanism of the distribution not fall into the wrong hands.</p>
<p>“I am wondering why there is no mention of foreign workers, ” said Mohideen.</p>
<p>“The government must look into ways to help them also as they are contributing to the development of this country too.”</p>
<p>S. Chandrasekaran, 29, who has just started work as a private valuer, said the Bantuan Prihatin Nasional aid of RM1,000 was timely.</p>
<p>“My wife who is a graduate is still looking for a job.</p>
<p>“The amount will be used for our monthly expenses.</p>
<p>Ooi says the package can stimulate economic growth.</p>
<p>“I have friends working in factories who also fall within the category.</p>
<p>“The news definitely comes as a relief, ” he said.</p>
<p>Under the economic stimulus package, the Bantuan Prihatin Nasional gives RM1,000 to each household earning between RM4,001 and RM8,000.</p>
<p>Clerical worker Kamaliah Mohd Sirajuddin, 27, is happy with the RM800 incentive provided for those aged 21 and above who are earning less than RM2,000 a month.</p>
<p>“My salary is RM1,700 which is barely enough to sustain me. I also have to take care of my 60-year-old mother.</p>
<p>“The aid will be of great help, ” she said.</p>
<p>Information Technology executive Syed Arafath Syed Mustafa, 40, said the package was a good move in alleviating the people’s burden.</p>
<p>He described the scheme as comprehensive as he believes almost every Malaysian would benefit from the package.</p>
<p>“The aid will really come in handy for those in the B40 and M40 groups in view of the movement control order.</p>
<p>“This shows the Government is aware of our economic hardship which has been plaguing us for some time.</p>
<p>“The situation has worsened with the Covid-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>“The wage subsidy will also help the business community in coping with the rising overhead demand since they have no incoming funds, ” he said.

“We Got Out Just In Time”- Kory Holden</p>
<p>Holden shares story of Georgia Superleague being postponed amid Coronavirus outbreak</p>
<p>SALISBURY, Md- Professional basketball player Kory Holden was nearing the end of his first year as a pro in the Georgia Superleague when the coronavirus pandemic put things on hold.</p>
<p>“Our general manager came over and told us that they were suspending the league,” said Holden. “The airports were pretty dry (at first).” Holden explained that he and about four other American players took planes to Qatar, and had an eight-hour layover before returning to the states. “Right now, (Georgia) they’re in a state of emergency, the airports, the borders closed down, no one can leave the house. So we got out just in time.”</p>
<p>Listen to his story above!
