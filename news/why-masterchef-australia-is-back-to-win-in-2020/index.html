With 11 seasons of contestants to pick from it wasn’t hard for Masterchef Australia to select a team of 24 all-stars to come ‘Back to Win’ for the 2020 season. Fan favourites Hayden Quinn and Khanh Ong join those who have had wide-ranging success outside the show including Poh Ling Yeow and Reynold Poernomo.</p>
<p>“Masterchef Australia 2020 is a chance for all Masterchef viewers – past and present – to find a genuine connection with contestants they will know,” says executive producer Rick Maier.</p>
<p>“The ‘Back to Win’ contestants were chosen by Marty Benson and his casting team at ESA [Endemol Shine Australia] very deliberately to canvas cuisine, demography, state etc. It is without a doubt the most diverse cast we have had, and every single one is a potential winner.</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>“Whether you remember Poh from season one or the contestants from last year, there will be someone you already have familiarity with, and want to cheer on.”</p>
<p>It isn’t just the contestants returning in 2020. A number of sponsors have come back for the 12th season, including Bulla. This will be the third season the brand has been involved with Masterchef Australia, with Mark Herring, Bulla Dairy Foods marketing manager for its chilled products saying the partnership is a natural one, brought about by shared values.</p>
<p>“Bulla is proud to continue its involvement with Masterchef Australia, given the show is all about the food first and foremost,” says Herring.</p>
<p>“With over 100 years of dairy expertise behind us, we know that cream can truly help bring a dish to life, bringing together flavours and boosting the everyday dish to the next level. This is why we continue to choose to partner with Masterchef Australia, a show that inspires creativity in the home kitchen and talks to the importance of beautiful fresh Australian produce.”</p>
<p>Bulla returns after last season when Ten and the brand partnered on an integrated campaign, focused on Bulla as the show’s cream of choice. The brief was to raise brand awareness and demonstrate the versatility of the product. The campaign consisted of in-show integration, broadcast and digital sponsorship, as well as off-screen activations.</p>
<p>Ten delivered on the integration, and versatility, and added integrated billboards and TV commercials reinforced the association and a 10 Play sponsorship for viewers online. This was followed up in-store with the ‘MasterChef Seal of Approval’ tagline.</p>
<p>“In any partnership, Bulla looks for partners who align to the same brand values. The success of Bulla’s involvement with the show over the past three years has been very rewarding. Not only has this been critical to help our own brand success but also we hope our involvement has been a great support to the show,” says Herring.</p>
<p>“A mutually supportive partnership is very important to us. Like Masterchef, Bulla takes pride in how we make our products and the quality of ingredients that go into them. We are not just a company but a community and everyone involved with Bulla is considered part of the family.”</p>
<p>The partnership in 2019 delivered a 63% integration recall among Masterchef viewers with 29% choosing to use the product compared to 8% of non-viewers. Bulla reports unit sales increased 23% after the sponsorship.</p>
<p>Bulla and Masterchef will be inviting three new members to the family in 2020. Jock Zonfrillo, Melissa Leong and Andy Allen have joined as judges, following last year’s departure of Matt Preston, Gary Mehigan and George Calombaris. Herring says Bulla isn’t concerned by the new faces, because the focus is the food. Maier says the diversity the trio bring to the show is what will make audiences love them.</p>
<p>“They’re brilliant. They have an ease of working together and a short-hand that belies the short time they’ve had together. Their backgrounds are different, their food knowledge is diverse, and they don’t always agree. It makes for some very interesting analysis of the dishes presented,” says Maier.</p>
<p>The combination of the new judges and the returning players will provide a new perspective on the 12th season, says Maier, and Ten is confident audiences will respond well to the switchup.</p>
<p>“It comes down to intent. Amateur cooks want to come on the show to learn from the very best. There is always exponential growth and the improvement in the contestants in a few short months is amazing. This year, these contestants are certainly not amateurs. They’ve had experience in the Masterchef kitchen and they’ve taken that experience into the outside world,” says Maier.</p>
<p>“They’ve opened restaurants, hosted cooking programs, written cookbooks, launched food lines. They have returned for unfinished business, and to relive some of the magic. It is the happiest, most focused set you could walk onto. There’s definitely a camaraderie, but they all want to win.”</p>
<p>Ten isn’t worried about the stress of launching during what has been described by many as an unprecedented environment for content. Media companies have struggled with a downturn in ad revenue and while news and current affairs programming has seen the highest ratings in five years, reality show programming doesn’t seem to have felt the same boost.</p>
<p>Masterchef, however, as Ten points out, first launched around the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the team is used to tough environments and is confident new judges, returning contestants and the usual uplifting and positive nature of Masterchef can help the show deliver a good result.</p>
<p>Maier insists the judges won’t be trying to fit existing stereotypes. Nobody is going to be the mean judge. Nobody will walk in with a Matt Preston-style cravat. The trio have found their new niche, he says.</p>
<p>“Melissa, Andy and Jock are very much their own people, and respectful of the legacy left by Gary, George and Matt. This is a new Masterchef, but the heart and soul remain. The food we have seen, the level of camaraderie, and the passion to succeed are all the ingredients you could wish for. It should be a cracking season.”

<h3 id="gordon-ramsay-claims-channel-tens-new-masterchef-judges-are-feeling-the-pressure">Gordon Ramsay claims Channel Ten&rsquo;s new MasterChef judges are feeling the pressure</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/12/03/27088704-0-image-a-15_1586659547535.jpg" alt="img">
Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay will return to MasterChef Australia during the 2020 all-star season as a guest judge.</p>
<p>And he claims the new judges are definitely feeling the heat following the departure of long-running hosts Gary Mehigan, Matt Preston and George Calombaris last year.</p>
<p>Speaking to The Daily Telegraph on Sunday, the British restaurateur and TV personality said the new line-up were almost under as much pressure as the competing stars.</p>
<p>Scroll down for video</p>
<p>&lsquo;This show is huge outside of Australia&rsquo;: Gordon Ramsay claims Channel Ten&rsquo;s new MasterChef judges are feeling the pressure ahead of their debut on popular cooking series</p>
<p>MasterChef Australia: Back To Win will see 24 contests from past seasons of the show return to the kitchen in a bid to win a cash prize of $250,000</p>
<p>Ramsay, who is the judge on the US version of the program, previously appeared on MasterChef Australia as a guest judge in 2018.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I look at how this show travels and it&rsquo;s huge outside of Australia, and I mean really huge. It is the unsung hero of the MasterChef phenomenon,&rsquo; Ramsay said of the success the Australian version has had over the past 10 years globally.</p>
<p>Gary, Matt and George were replaced last year by Andy Allen, Jock Zonfrillo and Melissa Leong.</p>
<p>Are they ready to take over the legacy? Ramsay spoke highly of the Australian version&rsquo;s global success over the past 10 years, claiming it was &lsquo;the unsung hero of the MasterChef phenomenon&rsquo;. Pictured: MasterChef Australia&rsquo;s new judges Andy Allen, Melissa Leong, and Jock Zonfrillo</p>
<p>While many Australian reality TV programs have suspended their productions due to the outbreak of coronavirus, MasterChef Australia has pressed forward with filming ahead of its advertised April 13 premiere.</p>
<p>Returning star Poh Ling Yeow, who was runner-up on the cooking show’s debut season, confirmed the show was only &lsquo;halfway through filming&rsquo; and were taking government COVID-19 regulations very seriously on set</p>
<p>Speaking to Hit105’s Stav, Abby and Matt last month, Poh said Channel 10 had no plans to shut down, or postpone, production of the ratings hit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It’s going ahead following all the government regulations for the virus,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;re following all the government regulations&rsquo;: Poh Ling Yeow (pictured) confirmed MasterChef Australia had adapted to coronavirus rules and were continuing filming the 2020 season in Melbourne during a radio interview last month</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s halfway through filming&rsquo;: The celebrity cook said Channel 10 were &lsquo;pushing ahead&rsquo; and felt they were in a ‘privileged position’ due to filming the series without a live audience</p>
<p>Remember her? Returning star Poh Ling Yeow was the runner-up on the cooking show’s debut season in 2009 (pictured)</p>
<p>International judges Nigella Lawson and Heston Blumenthal have had to cancel their scheduled appearances, while outdoor challenges with crowds have been shelved.</p>
<p>One drawcard for the program, however, is having filmed segments in advance with Gordon Ramsay, Curtis Stone and American pop star Katy Perry.</p>
<p>Former MasterChef contestant and new judge Andy Allen, 31, who recently closed his Three Blue Ducks chain as a result of coronavirus, told The Daily Telegraph that while the pandemic is &lsquo;a dire situation&rsquo;, the &lsquo;vibe on set is really positive&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Changes: The Sunday Telegraph reported how not only has Nigella Lawson (centre) bowed out of her scheduled appearance, planned travel and shooting outdoors has been cancelled. Nigella is pictured with former judges George Calombaris (left) and Matt Preston (right)</p>
<p>Star appeal: One drawcard for the program, however, is having filmed segments in advance with Gordon Ramsay, Curtis Stone and American pop star Katy Perry (pictured)</p>
<p>He previously told KIIS FM&rsquo;s The Kyle and Jackie O radio show, that the new judges were told by producers to &lsquo;just be themselves,&rsquo; after replacing old hosts, Gary Mehigan, Matt Preston and George Calombaris.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They didn&rsquo;t want us to step into Matt, George or Gary&rsquo;s role, they were just [like], &ldquo;we chose you because we want you to be you&rdquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Last year, Gary, Matt and George&rsquo;s contracts were not renewed after 11 seasons of hosting the show.</p>
<p>MasterChef - Back To Win premieres Monday, April 13 at 7.30pm on Channel 10

<h3 id="comfort-food-home-delivered-a-new-era-for-masterchef">Comfort food home delivered; a new era for MasterChef</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2518%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_249/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/8b1df00fc0b795e52d6b019d60311ef721b7a78a" alt="img">
Leong and fellow judges Andy Allen and Jock Zonfrillo aren’t household names (qualifier: yet) but the Endemol producers have left no stone unturned in ensuring the show’s 2020 reboot minus the familiar faces of Matt Preston, Gary Mehigan and George Calombaris stands its best chance in the prime-time arms race. Paving the way for Australia’s acceptance of the new judging troika, MasterChef Australia: Back To Win reintroduces 24 of the higher-profile alumni from previous seasons, among them Poh Ling Leow, Hayden Quinn, Dani Venn and Khanh Ong. “These are 24 contestants who are beloved and known by Australians and the global audience for MasterChef Australia and I think it’s a really smart move,” says Leong. “It does give us the opportunity for people to get to know us through that filter. It’s a fair indication of a high degree of intelligence from the brains trust at Endemol.” Past contestants and winners get a second chance in season 12 of MasterChef Australia. Credit:Network Ten More than a decade into MasterChef, the opportunity to breathe new life into the format has initiated other subtle yet important changes.</p>
<p>Past seasons have led to instant spikes in sales of particular ingredients: goats’ cheese, for example, pork belly, and pink ling (just ask series sponsor Coles, which stocks the contestants’ pantry and gets instant market insights into what floats Australians’ gustatory boat). Zonfrillo, the restaurateur who has put native ingredients in the spotlight at his three-hatted Adelaide restaurant Orana, signed up with the intention to insinuate them into the everyday food conversation. This year we’ll see the Indigenous plants, proteins and spices he’s spent his career championing included as a matter of course in the contestants’ pantry. “It was my non-negotiable term,” says the Scottish-born chef. “The important thing was to make sure it wasn’t the standalone Indigenous episode, where it’s isolated out like some kind of leprosy. It had to be integrated into everyday MasterChef much like a carrot or an onion. I wanted it to be natural rather than a tokenistic ‘look at this’ teaching moment. It’s time it went to the next level and got into people’s homes.” Here come the judges: Jock Zonfrillo, Andy Allen, guest Gordon Ramsay and Melissa Leong in the new-look MasterChef. Credit:Network Ten Ingredients such as mountain pepper (“a basic spice people can use an alternative to black pepper”); lemon myrtle (“fantastic when you put a few leaves into a chicken roast”); and Geraldton wax (“It should be on the supermarket shelves, for Christ’s sake; it’s great in a stir-fry or braise”) are part of the MasterChef 2.0 mise-en-place. “It’s been emotional, coming into it not knowing if they’d reach for the ingredients,” says Zonfrillo, “but they did.”</p>
<p>MasterChef 2.0 is also the perfect time to reflect on the capriciousness of fate. Loading Andy Allen is the season-four winner who has become a restaurateur in his own right (he’s teamed up with the Sydney-based Three Blue Ducks stable). His appointment to the judges’ table marks him as one of the MasterChef graduates to have best capitalised on the media career prize fluttering from the confetti cannon. By way of comparison, his fellow season-four traveller Ben Milburn, with whom he filmed the SBS series Andy and Ben Eat Australia, is on the other side of the bench as a contestant. “A lot of eyes were on the choice of new judges,” says Allen. “I do feel humbled they picked me.” He’s been heartened by 2020s renewed focus on comfort cooking returning the franchise to its more accessible roots. “Last year I saw some things I never thought I’d see on TV, much less on MasterChef. There was an episode when they were in Japan and someone was cooking shabu shabu and I just thought, no one’s going to relate to that. This year it’s going back to real people serving real food with a lot of flavour. We’re not looking at pretty stuff for the sake of it.”</p>
<p>This year’s viewers will not need to be eagle-eyed to notice the effects of the uninvited guest at the months-long dinner party. The arrival of COVID-19 forced a reset part-way through filming, cancelling the appearance of some international guest judges and modifying the typical challenge format. The cooking benches will be moved further apart, while for the judges there will be no more Gary, Matt and George-style eating off the same plate like a bunch of share-house mates. “Social distancing is very strange but we’re doing what we need to do,” says Leong. “It was funny to walk onto set and realise we can’t stand as close to each other and we can’t eat from the same plate. It’s impossible to ignore all the handwashing. But they can still make the show look and feel good.” As for anyone concerned that the nation’s talent pool of TV-ready amateur chefs has been swallowed up by endless MasterChef-inspired cooking competitions – well, you can take some coronavirus-inspired heart. “Who knows what people are doing with all this extra time at home?” says Leong. “They have YouTube, produce and a whole lot of time, so it bodes well for next year.”
