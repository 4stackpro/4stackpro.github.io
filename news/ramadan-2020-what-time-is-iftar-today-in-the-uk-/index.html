<p>What happens at Iftar?</p>
<p>Muslims must fast between sunrise and sunset every day in Ramadan.</p>
<p>However, they are able to enjoy one meal &ldquo;pre-dawn&rdquo; and one after sunset each day.</p>
<p>Iftar is the meal eaten after the fourth prayer of the day, the Maghrib, which happens just after sunset.</p>
<p>In Arabic, iftar means &lsquo;break of a fast&rsquo;, and fatoor means &lsquo;breakfast&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It is the second meal of the day during Ramadan as those taking part in the fast must not eat or drink anything during daylight hours.</p>
<p>The Suhur is consumed in the morning, and can be as early as 2.30am.</p>
<p>The Iftar is considered a blessing, often enjoyed as a community.</p>
<p>It is thought not eating during daylight hours, as well as not drinking, smoking or indulging in sex will lead to greater &ldquo;taqwa&rdquo; or consciousness of God.</p>
<p>The time of spiritual reflection, improvement and increased devotion and worship is thought to teach followers how to be more self-disciplined and have empathy for those less fortunate.</p>
<p>But with lockdown measures in place, gatherings will need to be kept according to government guidelines.</p>
<p>When does Ramadan end?</p>
<p>This year, Ramadan began on Thursday April 23 and will end on Saturday May 23.</p>
<p>The fast is 30 days long and the beginning and end are determined by the lunar Islamic calendar – meaning it depends on when the new moon is sighted.</p>
<p>Hilal, the crescent, is usually a day or more after the astronomical new moon.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;night of power&rdquo; or &ldquo;night of decree&rdquo; is considered the holiest night of the year, as Muslims believe the first revelation of the Koran was sent down to Muhammad on this night.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s thought to have occurred on an odd-numbered night during the last ten days of Ramadan - the 21, 23, 25, 27 or 29th.</p>
<p>The first day of fasting begins on April, 24, 2020 and the final iftar should take place on the evening of May 23.</p>
<p>The holiday of Eid al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan and the beginning of the next lunar month.</p>
<p>This annual observance is regarded as one of the Five Pillars of Islam.</p>
<p>A common greeting is Ramadan Mubarak, which means &ldquo;have a blessed Ramadan&rdquo;.</p>

<p>How to practice Ramadan &amp; social distancing?</p>
<p>Many of the traditions around Ramadan involve gathering together, community work and charity, which has to be compromised due to social distancing restrictions.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic has curbed large gatherings for prayers and public iftars, or meals to break the fast.</p>
<p>Islam&rsquo;s holiest sites in Saudi Arabia and Jerusalem have been largely empty of worshippers as authorities are forced to impose unprecedented restrictions.</p>
<p>In a rare occurrence in Islam&rsquo;s 1,400-year history, Mecca&rsquo;s Grand Mosque and the Prophet&rsquo;s Mosque in Medina - the religion&rsquo;s two holiest locations - will be closed to the public during the fasting period.</p>
<p>Prayers from inside the mosque at Mecca on the first evening of Ramadan on Thursday were restricted to clerics, security staff and cleaners, in a ceremony broadcast live on television.</p>
<p>New guidance released by The Muslim Council of Britain has outlined how Muslims can practise their faith during the holy month while keeping safe from coronavirus.</p>

<h3 id="new-york-city-will-distribute-500000-free-halal-meals-to-muslims-during-ramadan">New York City will distribute 500,000 free halal meals to Muslims during Ramadan</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200424185701-01-halal-ramadan-0423-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) The coronavirus pandemic has turned life upside down for many New Yorkers, including those who wish to safely practice their faiths.</p>
<p>Muslims, who began the holy month of Ramadan on Thursday, are no exception. The holy month involving fasting from sunup to sundown, charity and prayer is typically celebrated as a community. But due to social distancing, that&rsquo;s not possible this year.</p>
<p>To help families celebrate, especially those who&rsquo;ve lost income due to shutdowns, New York City has announced plans to serve more than 500,000 halal meals to Muslims during Ramadan.</p>
<p>A halal meal is one that is prepared in accordance with Islamic law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of Ramadan&rsquo;s most noble callings is to feed the hungry,&rdquo; Mayor Bill de Blasio said during a press conference on Thursday. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a crucial part of how the holiday is celebrated, to remember to be there for those in need, and that is now harder than ever.&rdquo;</p>
