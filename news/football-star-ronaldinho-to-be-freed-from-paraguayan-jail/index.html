Ronaldinho Gaucho leaves the Paraguayan Public Ministry where he testified along with his brother Roberto de Asis on March 5, 2020.</p>
<p>Brazilian World Cup winner Ronaldinho Gaucho will be released from jail into house arrest in Paraguay on Tuesday after he and his brother paid $1.6 million in bail, the judge in his case said.</p>
<p>Advertising Read more</p>
<p>The former Barcelona, Paris St Germain and AC Milan midfielder, who won the World Cup with Brazil in 2002, was arrested on March 6 with his brother and business manager Roberto Assis.</p>
<p>They were accused of possessing adulterated Paraguayan passports. The brothers&rsquo; lawyer has called their detention &ldquo;arbitrary, abusive and illegal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pair had been previously denied bail but the judge on Tuesday said the investigation carried out in the days since favoured the detainees.</p>
<p>Judge Gustavo Amarilla gave no further details but said there was no reason to keep the pair in custody given their huge bail payment and on the condition they do not leave the country.</p>
<p>The judge relayed his decision to the brothers in a video call and granted them permission to move into the four-star Palmaroga hotel in Asuncion while they awaited their trial.</p>
<p>They are expected to leave prison on Tuesday and they will be allowed to receive visits in the hotel.</p>
<p>The two men deposited $800,000 each as bail into a local bank account on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It’s a significant bail in cash to guarantee they will not flee,&rdquo; Amarilla said.</p>
<p>Although he last played professionally in 2015, Ronaldinho, who also represented Brazilian clubs Gremio, Atletico Mineiro, Flamengo and Fluminense, is still hugely popular with global football fans.</p>
<p>He also won the Champions League with Barcelona in 2006 and was named FIFA world player of the year in 2004 and 2005.</p>

Ronaldinho avoided a slide tackle with the ease of a man sidestepping a turd</p>
<p>Nostalgia</p>
<p>Share</p>
<p>We’re in lockdown and there’s no football to keep us entertained, so Tom Victor is watching back old games to search for the kind of insignificant moments we usually write about on a Monday morning. First, a moment of Ronaldinho genius from October 2005.</p>
<p>When Ronaldinho wants to run a game, there’s no stopping him. You can only wait it out and attempt to salvage something once he’s got bored of leaving you flailing.</p>
<p>Deportivo La Coruna discovered this when the Brazilian maestro spent more than an hour making the Riazor his own personal playground.</p>
<p>The hosts clawed their way back to earn a 3-3 draw they may well be satisfied with, but Manuel Pablo will be having nightmares about Barca’s No.10 for years to come.</p>
<p>The Spain full-back has challenged himself against some of the world’s best before, keeping Kaka quiet in Depor’s sensational Champions League comeback against AC Milan last year, but this was another challenge altogether.</p>
<p>Ronaldinho had already got inside the defender’s head once to turn a 1-0 deficit into a 2-1 Barcelona lead, turning stasis into kinesis so abruptly it was barely possible to notice the shift.</p>
<p>And we’d seen another clue in the way he converted the penalty to put Barca 3-1 up, blasting the ball high into Jose Molina’s net with the fury of a man upset that the ball and the responsibility that came with its position on the spot might consider forcing him to break stride.</p>
<p>However, it was a moment after all of this which really let Manuel Pablo know who was in charge.</p>
<p>Ronaldinho rarely needs a second invitation to let loose with disrespect, but when Manuel Pablo went to ground there was never likely to be another outcome.</p>
<p>The full-back’s slide is the act of a man who has had enough. He’s going in for ball or man, and he doesn’t matter which he takes: after the earlier embarrassment, he’s piling in with the force of a truck and letting the laws of physics decide who or what he makes contact with.</p>
<p>If he’s timed it right, ball and man will both come into contact with his boot, and for neither to do so would be a sign of his target reacting quicker than any man realistically could.</p>
<p>What he doesn’t consider, though, is that Ronaldinho’s mind doesn’t believe in such limits.</p>
<p>The simplicity of Ronaldinho’s skill is the worst part for Manuel Pablo. What he imagines as a surefire way to stop his opponent is viewed by the Brazilian as the most minor of inconveniences; to avoid the challenge is akin to stepping out of your way while walking down the street so as to avoid stepping on a dog turd.</p>
<p>The escape itself won’t have bothered him as much as how easy it was to make, and even the attempted recovery from the defender feels accelerated as if Ronaldinho is dragging him along by a string tied to his heels. Immediately, the Depor man has gone from having command of his decisions to not even having any self-control to lose.</p>
<p>The pursuit feels permanent, as if he can only ever be in a state of chasing. The time for approaching any challenge head-on is long gone, so distant it’s hard to even conceive of what it might look like were it to present itself again. Ronaldinho is in charge of the direction of play, and you’re lucky if he’s even generous enough to give you a clear view.</p>

<p>• • • •</p>
<p>When you’ve been to carefully and devastatingly put to the sword, it’s hard to focus on much beyond the immediate embarrassment.</p>
<p>Once the reflex wears off and you’re allowed to give up the chase, attention will naturally turn to making sure you don’t suffer the same fate again. This means time spent attempting to make sense of the original embarrassment, and therein lies the issue: you can prevent others doing the same to you, but whether Ronaldinho repeats the trick is down to the whims of Ronaldinho alone.</p>
<p>If Manuel Pablo wants any consolation, all he can do is remind himself he wasn’t the first to be left scrambling for his lost pride, and he certainly won’t be the last.</p>

<h3 id="ronaldinho-é-o-maior-driblador-que-já-vi-diz-ex-atacante-do-barcelona">Ronaldinho é o maior driblador que já vi, diz ex-atacante do Barcelona</h3>

Ronaldinho é o maior driblador que já vi, diz ex-atacante do Barcelona</p>
<p>Cristian Hidalgo, ex-companheiro do brasileiro, relembrou a parceria em entrevista exclusiva à Goal</p>
<p>Em entrevista exclusiva à Goal, Cristian Hidalgo, ex-atacante do , hoje jogando em Andorra, classificou Ronaldinho Gaúcho como o melhor driblador que ele já viu jogar e como responsável pelo sucesso dos catalães naquela época.</p>
<p>Vindo das categorias de base do Barça, Hidalgo dividiu os vestiários com o craque brasileiro em 2006, um dos principais momentos da carreira do Bruxo. &ldquo;Ele era a alegria personificada, ele contagiou cada companheiro de equipe com sua risada. Estava sendo brincando com a gente, principalmente comigo&rdquo;, relembra Hidalgo ao contar uma história sobre Ronaldinho.</p>
<p>A alegria do brasileiro também era mostrada dentro de campo, o &lsquo;Rei dos Dibres&rsquo;, como ficou conhecido, driblava até seus companheiros: &ldquo;Nunca vi um driblador melhor do que ele. Ele driblava todos nós durante os treinos&rdquo;, lembra o atacante.</p>
<p>Quando chegou à , Ronaldinho encontrou um Barcelona em crise, sem ser campeão há várias temporadas, foi ele um dos responsáveis, talvez o principal, por reerguer o time e, para Hidalgo, ele fez isso do mesmo jeito que sempre: com alegria. &ldquo;Sem ele e sua aura positiva, Barca não teria sido tão bem sucedido na época&rdquo;, disse à Goal.</p>
<p>Em seu tempo de Barca, Hidalgo também teve a oportunidade de jogar com outro - que viria a ser - grande craque do futebol, Lionel Messi. Pela equipe principal os dois só estiveram junto sme 2006, mas passaram pelas categorias de base juntos.</p>
<p>Sobre o garoto que viria ser eleito seis vezes como melhor jogador do mundo, Hidalgo lembrou &ldquo;Leo era um talento incrível. Todos no clube sabiam que um dia ele seria um jogador muito bom. Mas o melhor de todos os tempos&hellip; Não. Ninguém poderia prever isso&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mas uma das imagens que fica é do garoto tímido e introvertido, mas só até começar a marcar - os hoje tão comuns - gols &ldquo;Ele era muito tímido, muito introvertido. Na verdade ele só falava quando era necessário. Como ele jogou mais e começou a marcar gols, ele descongelou um pouco e brincou mais&rdquo;.
