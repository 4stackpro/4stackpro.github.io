With the sixth pick in the seventh round of the 2020 NFL Draft, the Los Angeles Chargers select Ohio State wide receiver K.J. Hill. The Buckeyes&rsquo; all-time leading pass catcher will now take his talents to the NFL where he looks to build on a successful career with the Scarlet and Gray.</p>
<p>Coming out of North Little Rock High School in Arkansas, Hill was a four-star prospect and the country&rsquo;s 16th best receiver in the 2015 class, per the 247Sports Composite. He was recruited by all the major college football programs but his decision came down to Ohio State his home-state Razorbacks. In the end, the appeal of playing for the Scarlet and Gray and the potential for what he could become in Columbus was too much for Arkansas to overcome.</p>
<p>Despite being the No. 1 player from his home state, Hill had plenty of competition when he arrived to Ohio State. Playing the H-Back spot in Urban Meyer&rsquo;s offense, Hill had to contend with Curtis Samuel, Jalin Marshall, Dontre Wilson and Parris Campbell. Because of the crowded receiver room, Hill redshirted his first year as a Buckeye, giving him time to adjust to life with the Scarlet and Gray.</p>
<p>As a redshirt freshman, Hill found some playing time but was still behind the likes of Samuel, Wilson and Campbell. He still finished the year with 18 receptions &ndash; fifth best on the team &ndash; for 262 yards and his first career touchdown in 11 games played.</p>
<p>It was in 2017 when fans really began to see the player Hill would become. While splitting reps with Campbell at the H-Back spot, Hill recorded 56 catches &ndash; the most on the team &ndash; for 549 yards and three touchdowns. He also worked on special teams, returning 26 punts for 144 yards.</p>
<p>Both Hill and Campbell returned in 2018 and again split snaps at the H-Back position. Both players managed to have successful seasons, as Hil finished second on the team in receptions with 70, going for 885 yards and six touchdowns. Following the season, Hill was named honorable mention All-Big Ten.</p>
<p>After the 2018 season, Campbell, Terry McLaurin and Johnnie Dixon, Hill&rsquo;s close friends and fellow Ohio State wide receivers, all went to the NFL, but the Arkansas native elected to return for his redshirt senior season. That decision paid off, as Hill was, for the first time in his career, the Buckeyes&rsquo; primary option at slot receiver.</p>

<p>In what proved to be a deep and talented wide receiver corps Hill finished second on the team with 57 catches for 636 yards and a career-high 10 touchdowns. In the Big Ten Championship Game against Wisconsin, Hill broke David Boston&rsquo;s 20-year old record for all-time reception in Ohio State history and tied Gary Williams&rsquo; mark of 48 consecutive games with at least one catch by the year&rsquo;s end. Once again, Hill was named honorable mention All-Big Ten after the season.</p>
<p>In Hill, the Chargers are getting a talented slot receiver who has plenty of experience, a proven track record running routes and arguably the best hands in the draft. His improvement from his true freshman season to his historic final year at Ohio State will now continue in the NFL.

<h3 id="what-your-nfl-team-will-be-getting-if-they-draft-kj-hill">What your NFL team will be getting if they draft K.J. Hill</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZSBWIjWZaAS8VjyqNdcPzFr5SEo=/0x212:3000x1783/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19918802/1187477930.jpg.jpg" alt="img">
What a college career K.J. Hill had. After nearly playing college football elsewhere, the wide receiver from Arkansas went on to become Ohio State’s all-time leading pass catcher. Now, Hill will likely have his name called in the later portion of the 2020 NFL Draft and find out where he will begin his professional football career.</p>
<p>Hill came out of Little Rock, Arkansas, where he was the top player in the state, and a four-star recruit. Originally, Hill verbally committed to play football at Arkansas, but a month before National Signing Day he opened his recruitment back up. Ohio State was able to beat out Alabama in landing Hill’s commitment, bringing the wide receiver to Columbus.</p>
<p>After redshirting in 2015, Hill saw a good amount of snaps as a redshirt freshman, catching 18 passes. In 2017, Hill started to become a favorite of Buckeye quarterbacks, catching at least 50 passes in each of his final three seasons at Ohio State. By the time all was said and done, Hill would eclipse David Boston’s school record of 191 career receptions. Hill finished his Ohio State career with 201 catches.</p>
<p>Throughout his Ohio State career, Hill was always there to make the catch in high pressure situations. The reliability Hill showed at Ohio State is a big reason why NFL teams are looking at him. There’s nothing special about Hill in terms of size or athleticism, but he more than makes up for it with his hands and toughness.</p>
<p>Another thing that makes Hill so good is his route work. Hill is able to create separation from defenders because of how well he can run routes. Because Hill isn’t going to threaten defenders vertically, he makes up for it by not only running crisp routes, but he has the ability to hide his rotes and force defenders into mistakes.</p>
<p>As good as Hill is, there are some limitations to his game. Since he isn’t a burner, Hill has a tough time creating quick separation underneath. If the ball gets into Hill’s hands, he isn’t going to break many tackles or run away from defenders.</p>
<p>Another issue teams might find with Hill is he has shorter arms, which leaves him with a smaller catch radius. If teams do a little more homework on Hill though, they’ll see that even with the smaller catch radius, Hill catches a lot of what is thrown at him. If the quarterback gives Hill a decent shot at making the catch, he is more than likely going to pull the football in.</p>
<p>Hill likely will have to wait until day three to hear his name called in the 2020 NFL Draft, but any team would be lucky to have him on their roster. Once Hill does land with a team, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see him last a while in the NFL. While Hill isn’t going to reel in passes like Michael Thomas, he has the feel of that receiver who always finds a way to make big catches in the clutch.</p>
<p>Hill’s size and lack of burner speed will leave him as a slot receiver. Not that Hill can’t find success at that position. Who knows, maybe Hill can turn into the next Wes Welker or Julian Edelman. It was a pleasure to watch Hill as a Buckeye, and hopefully more greatness is to come for him in the NFL.

<h3 id="la-bound-jordan-fuller-kj-hill-drafted-by-rams-chargers">L.A. bound: Jordan Fuller, K.J Hill drafted by Rams, Chargers</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.buckeyextra.com/storyimage/OH/20200425/SPORTS/200429115/AR/0/AR-200429115.jpg" alt="img">
The NFL draft began Thursday with a flood of Ohio State Buckeyes.</p>
<p>It ended Saturday with a long wait, then a late rush.</p>
<p>It took more than 4½ hours for a Buckeye to be picked on the final day of the draft, which started with the fourth round. The drought finally ended when the Los Angeles Rams took senior safety Jordan Fuller in the sixth round, the 199th overall pick.</p>
<p>K.J. Hill, Ohio State’s leader in career catches, went to the other Los Angeles team — the Chargers — in the seventh and final round with the 220th selection. Later, the Detroit Lions selected defensive lineman Jashon Cornell at No. 235 overall, giving the Buckeyes 10 overall picks.</p>
<p>The long wait on Saturday was a contrast to Thursday, when the draft began as practically a commercial for Ohio State. LSU’s Joe Burrow, whose career began in Columbus, as you may have heard, went first overall to the Bengals.</p>
<p>Defensive end Chase Young then went to Washington and cornerback Jeff Okudah to Detroit, as expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To see three guys that have been in our program go 1-2-3 like that, it&rsquo;s kind of surreal,&rdquo; Ohio State coach Ryan Day said Saturday on ESPN radio.</p>
<p>Young and Okudah, both juniors in 2019, were projected as high future draft picks before they ever enrolled at Ohio State.</p>
<p>Most of the other OSU draft picks took longer, more winding paths. Only running back J.K. Dobbins, who went in the second round to Baltimore on Friday, was an underclassman.</p>
<p>Cornerback Damon Arnette, a surprise first-round pick at No. 19 by the Las Vegas Raiders, intended to turn pro last year before changing his mind.</p>
<p>Two local products, defensive tackle DaVon Hamilton of Pickerington Central and linebacker Malik Harrison of Walnut Ridge, were below-the-radar recruits who blossomed late in their Ohio State careers and were third-round picks. Jacksonville took Hamilton with the 73rd pick.</p>
<p>After Detroit took OSU offensive lineman Jonah Jackson two picks later, Harrison went as the No. 98 selection, to the Ravens.</p>
<p>Even as they developed at Ohio State, Harrison and Hamilton tended to be overshadowed. Hamilton played nose tackle, a position with more grime than glory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I’m just trying to create as much disruption in the backfield as possible — even without the tackle or sack or anything,&rdquo; Hamilton told Jaguars reporters. &ldquo;That was my role at Ohio State, and hopefully I can continue that in the league.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hamilton probably wasn’t on most teams’ draft radar before his final season. He had 10½ tackles for loss last year, including six sacks.</p>
<p>The 6-2½, 247-pound Harrison led the Buckeyes with 75 tackles and trailed only Young in tackles for loss, with 16½.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Malik’s just different,&rdquo; Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta said. &ldquo;You don’t get a lot of big linebackers anymore in college football. He’s almost 250 pounds. He’s got long arms. He takes on guys really well. He’s really strong in the box. He’s a guy that really looks like an NFL linebacker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Day contrasted the path of his seniors with that of Young and Okudah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are the guys like Chase and Jeff,&rdquo; Day said. &ldquo;They came in, they played for three years and they get drafted like they did. Those are guys who are just very, very talented and have potential, and in their third year really came on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The journey was longer for the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These guys were in our program for multiple years, and our strength and conditioning program with Mick Marotti, I think, is the best in the country and just the way that we develop guys,&rdquo; Day said. &ldquo;A lot of it is physically, but a lot of it is emotionally and mentally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That mental toughness probably was necessary as the hours dragged on Saturday. The Buckeye drought finally ended with Fuller’s selection. Fuller was a two-time captain and three-time Academic All-American.</p>
<p>He flourished last year as the sole deep safety in Ohio State’s revamped defense. Fuller finished with 224 career tackles and five interceptions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly, I’m speechless at the moment,&rdquo; he told Rams media. &ldquo;It’s a bunch of hard work going into this, and I know it’s the first step in a long journey. But I’m just so, so thankful that they gave me this opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I’m so excited to be an LA Ram and being in LA. My brother (Devin) went to UCLA. I’ve got family out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fuller was the 12th Ohio State defensive back drafted since 2014.</p>
<p>Hill was expected to be the first Buckeye to be picked on Saturday. The slot receiver, whose 201 career receptions broke David Boston’s school record, was expected to go in the middle rounds. But he had a longer wait than expected.</p>
<p>After Fuller, Hill and Cornell were picked, receivers Austin Mack and Binjimen Victor, as well as offensive lineman Branden Bowen and defensive tackle Robert Landers waited for their names to be called as the final picks were made.</p>
