<p>A bill aimed at increasing Colorado’s childhood vaccination will get another hearing this Sunday. Despite coronavirus and racial justice protests, it’s expected to draw what will be the biggest crowds of this mid-pandemic legislative session.</p>
<p>The measure already caused a delay in the House calendar when Republicans slowed the pace of debate on Friday.</p>
<p>Roxborough Park Republican Rep. Mark Baisley said he was furious at the sudden scheduling of a bill for a Sunday hearing at noon. Lawmakers occasionally work on a Saturday, but a Sunday is almost unheard of.</p>
<p>“This may be the final weekend before the 2020 Session finally comes to a close and I was close to allowing myself to believe that the Democrats would give Colorado’s parents some relief — Relief from the fear of having a critical choice taken from them; choice in what goes into their children’s bodies. My heart sank when they informed me that a rare meeting of the committee will meet on Sunday to introduce Senate Bill 163. SUNDAY!” Baisley said.</p>
<p>The bill would require parents who want to opt a child out of vaccines to either get a signature from an immunization provider or watch an online informational video produced by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. It would also set a state goal of reaching a 95 percent immunization rate.</p>
<p>Right now parents need to fill out a form and return it to the school.</p>
<p>“To know that we&rsquo;re still at risk for that with the rates that we have is extremely scary,” said Democratic sponsor and emergency room nurse, Rep. Kyle Mullica of Northglenn. “This pandemic has shown us is what life is like to deal with something when we don&rsquo;t have a vaccine for.”</p>
<p>Most parents in Colorado do vaccinate their children. However, the percentage of Colorado kindergartners vaccinated for measles, mumps and rubella has dropped to 87 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the lowest rate in the country. Public health officials say that makes pockets of the state especially prone to a measles outbreak. That was before COVID-19.</p>
<p>Sean O’Leary, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Children&rsquo;s Hospital Colorado, said the state has since “seen dramatic drops in vaccination because of all the social and physical distancing measures” and people’s infection concerns about visiting their doctors.</p>
<p>“So our vaccination rates in Colorado have already taken a hit because of COVID-19,” O&rsquo;Leary said “So it&rsquo;s really important that we do everything we possibly can to bring those rates up. And I think this bill would go a long way towards doing that.”</p>
<p>The bill originally cleared the Senate back in February after a marathon committee hearing, before the legislature temporarily adjourned the session for the pandemic.</p>
<p>Yael Cohen, a special education advocate from Boulder, opposes the bill and doesn’t understand why lawmakers have taken it back up. Because she’s in a high-risk category for the coronavirus, she’s concerned she won’t be able to testify against it in person.</p>
<p>“With everything going on with the virus and with the protests and riots, this is the priority?” she questioned.</p>
<p>Lawmakers will allow written remarks but Cohen is dismissive of that as “it’s not like they read those and consider those before they vote.”</p>
<p>Another critic of the bill, Theresa Wrangham, the executive director for the National Vaccine Information Center, feels the measure is an effort to coerce people into vaccinating their children.</p>
<p>“You&rsquo;re assuming that this group of people who have come to a different decision are ignorant,” she said. “They require education, and you&rsquo;re going to make them give up their federal privacy rights in order to get their personal and religious beliefs approved so that their children can attend school. That is wrong to so many of us.”</p>
<p>Supporters are just as steadfast.</p>
<p>Denver Democratic Rep. Susan Lontine, chair of The House Health &amp; Insurance Committee which will hear the bill, said holding the hearing on Sunday was responsible. Each side will be limited to an hour and a half of testimony.</p>
<p>“We have an abbreviated session to finish up a lot of work and we missed two days last week. There wasn’t a lot of time. The other reason I suggested it, was to do what I could to minimize exposure to the staff because there wouldn’t be any other business in the building on Sunday.”</p>
<p>Lontine said she won’t be “held hostage” by a vocal minority.</p>
<p>“It’s business the state needs to finish.&rdquo; She thinks it’s in the best interest of public health. As one supporter said, “if we can’t pass a vaccine bill during a pandemic, when can we?”

<h3 id="classes-that-click-a-semester-to-remember">&ldquo;Classes that click: a semester to remember&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://news.emory.edu/stories/2020/05/er_covid_remote_classes_wrap_up/thumbs/story_main.jpg" alt="img">
“I was really impressed with my students’ resilience and their ability to roll with this transition, but also their need to maintain interpersonal connection – even if it’s only through the Zoom grid,&rdquo; says Christina E. Crawford, assistant professor of modern and contemporary architecture.</p>
<p>“Classes that Click” is a series spotlighting how Emory is adapting undergraduate courses to remote learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Each column will showcase one course, with insights and tips from both the professor and students. View more “Classes that Click” stories.</p>
<p>From taping class schedules to bedroom walls to keep time zones straight to creating whiteboard teaching surfaces on bookcases, Emory’s faculty, students and staff did whatever they could to make remote learning work during the second half of spring semester. Countless lessons – during class times and beyond – were learned along the way that many believe will serve them well when the Emory community returns to campus.</p>
<p>Gathering student input</p>
<p>One of the first decisions faculty needed to make was whether to teach synchronously, asynchronously or a combination of the two.</p>
<p>Mike Rogers, associate professor of mathematics and computer science at Oxford College, says one primary goal was to ensure that students had the best opportunity to learn. When he invited students from his Calculus I course to meet during spring break via Zoom to discuss ways they might carry the course forward, most participated.</p>
<p>“The trials and testing we did before and after the end of spring break rebuilt the trust we had established at the beginning of the course,” Rogers says. “We could meet their learning goals, the rules and logistics of assignments and assessments would be manageable, they wouldn’t have to stress out about meeting requirements. I appreciated the students’ help as we [Rogers and his co-teacher, Nicolas Petit] put together our new plans.”</p>
<p>Andra Gillespie, associate professor of political science, surveyed her students to get a sense of their physical locations and internet access. That was important for Gillespie&rsquo;s students and others across campus, since some such as Esteban Ancona Garcia, a sophomore from Merida, Mexico, hadn’t studied at home in several years.</p>
<p>Based on what she learned from her students and through department training, Gillespie decided to teach her classes synchronously and then provide lecture recordings for students who could not attend class.</p>
<p>Katherine Ostrom, senior lecturer in Spanish and Portuguese, opted for a different type of combination approach. She held shorter synchronous sessions during the original course time and make-up sessions later in the day (both of which were recorded). She also posted about half the day’s material in a video for students to watch at their convenience.</p>
<p>“It took a little extra time, but a nice side benefit was getting to work with a smaller group each time and devote the whole meeting to discussion,” she says.</p>
<p>Connecting beyond class</p>
<p>The remote environment led some students to reach out to professors for the first time.</p>
<p>“Many students had managed the first part of the semester on their own and not sought any personal help from me,” Rogers says. “During the initial transition I dealt with more students on an individual basis than normal. When two people come together committed to a shared goal – in this case, what the student needs to be able to learn the material – it is such a joy to listen to them, discuss possible solutions and feel the tension dissolve as you move from a problem to a solution you can both be happy with.”</p>
<p>Remote learning also gave faculty and students opportunities to learn more about each other than they might in a typical classroom, from seeing siblings or pets on screen to taking extra time to chat.</p>
<p>“I would arrive to Zoom meetings a few minutes early to talk to others about how they were doing,” says Kevin Kim, a student in Nosayba El-Sayed’s “Introduction to Database Systems” class. “Catching up with professors and classmates made me realize what unique individuals all of us are and that not taking that first step in getting to know the people around you is an opportunity lost.”</p>
<p>Goizueta Business School student Tate Stevenson agrees. “I have gained a greater appreciation for the value and need of community and belonging. Checking in on others and making an effort to remain connected and engaged is critical.”</p>
<p>Students also took it upon themselves to connect outside class. For example, Sally Kim, who graduated with double majors in computer science and psychology, says one of her friends created weekly “Silent Disco” nights on Zoom so students could see their friends and meet new ones.</p>
<p>“I was really impressed with my students’ resilience and their ability to roll with this transition, but also their need to maintain interpersonal connection – even if it’s only through the Zoom grid,” says Christina E. Crawford, assistant professor of modern and contemporary architecture in the Art History Department. “I lost Wi-Fi connection between our Zoom opening chitchat and delivering my first online lecture. I was offline for 10 minutes and when I came back they were still all there, asking me to give the lecture.”</p>
<p>Factoring in fun</p>
<p>“One challenge was to maintain student engagement and motivation levels in an online setting while making sure classes stayed interactive and fun,” says El-Sayed, a computer science lecturer. “Another challenge was getting the students to turn on their webcams to create a more interactive class experience.”</p>
<p>To help meet those challenges, El-Sayed invited everyone to pick a Zoom background based on a theme for each lecture. Themes included Hogwarts School of Magic, baby photos of themselves, monuments from the cities where they currently resided, White Hall 206 (their classroom on campus) and graduation ceremonies.</p>
<p>“If students were shy or couldn’t turn on their cameras, they could change their Zoom avatar to match the theme,” El-Sayed says.</p>
<p>“Seeing others in the lecture hall seemed surreal, but was funny in a way,” says Kevin Kim, who would change his virtual background in other classes as well. “In one class I changed my virtual background to a picture of a grocery store aisle. Many, including the professor, got a good laugh out of it. Some even changed their backgrounds to join me.”</p>
<p>Incorporating current events</p>
<p>While faculty often incorporate aspects of current events into their classes, the pandemic provided avenues for that across multiple subjects.</p>
<p>“I tried to lean into the crisis and use it to advance learning goals,” Gillespie says. “I was somewhat intentional about using examples from the crisis in lecture examples and test questions. There were times when I purposely didn’t talk about the crisis to avoid raising anxieties, but it sometimes provided excellent examples of the concepts we were studying in class.”</p>
<p>El-Sayed also found ways to connect her database systems course to COVID-19. A friend who is an epidemiologist told El-Sayed that scientists would benefit from a database system that consolidates information from multiple sources, enabling easier analysis. El-Sayed turned her friend’s observation into a class assignment, asking students to design a “schema” for a database system that could eventually be used by scientists analyzing the pandemic.</p>
<p>Looking to the future</p>
<p>“There are lots of ways to come together as a classroom community, and virtual does not have to mean cold or impersonal,” says Melissa Williams, Goizueta term chair and associate professor of organization and management. “This crisis drew attention to just how committed everyone at Emory is to taking care of those we’re responsible for.</p>
<p>“Our medical colleagues stepped up patient care and faculty rose to the challenge of remote teaching – even the ones who didn’t necessarily consider themselves to be technically savvy. It’s clear that we are all committed to delivering a world-class education, even during a pandemic.”</p>
<p>However, even the positives associated with remote learning don’t outweigh the belief by faculty and students that being together on campus is special. Kara Trotman, a biology and Spanish double major from Seattle, and Yael Cohen, a finance major from Costa Rica, both look forward to when they can learn face-to-face with their professors and fellow students.</p>
<p>“When the pandemic is over, I will be appreciative every day for the opportunity to walk around campus with my friends, sit inside a classroom, run in Lullwater Preserve and attend club meetings in the business school or study groups at the library,” Cohen says.</p>
<p>“We are all making it work online, but face-to-face learning is invaluable – a true gift, actually,” Crawford says. “The diverse scholarly community that grows inside the four physical walls of a classroom is one of the most memorable aspects of the college experience. I suspect that once we’re through this we’ll appreciate campus and classroom life more than ever.”

<h3 id="woke-fashion-brands-face-backlash-for-not-practising-what-they-preach">&ldquo;&lsquo;Woke&rsquo; fashion brands face backlash for not practising what they preach&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca758acfa1a54ec1df935acf765b6b9cd4f932d6/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=5ce52ba6e78aff06961fba9d603b7be7" alt="img">
In the wake of George Floyd’s killing, many brands and influencers have made outwardly progressive statements that jar with their internal culture</p>
<p>Fashion’s facades are crumbling. In the wake of the police killing of George Floyd, the progressive images of many brands, shops and influencers are being stripped away to reveal what are in some cases toxic internal practices.</p>
<p>Racism is at the heart of fast fashion – it&rsquo;s time for change | Kalkidan Legesse Read more</p>
<p>Under the pressure of a debate over racism sparked by the killing of Floyd in Minneapolis, a harsh spotlight has been thrown upon organisations and individuals in the fashion sector whose outwardly “woke” statements in support of anti-racism jars with their internal behavior.</p>
<p>Last week, the protests over racism spread as several brands and designers were criticised for being tone deaf to the change of mood, or worse. Even the US Vogue editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, apologised for her magazine’s historical publication of stories and images that may have been hurtful to or intolerant of black people. Leandra Medine Cohen, the founder of the fashion blog Man Repeller, said she would “step back” after criticism of her company’s response to systemic racism.</p>
<p>This disconnect between outward brand identity and racist undercurrents has surfaced in recent years, with fashion labels like Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Comme des Garçons, Gucci and Burberry called out for producing racially insensitive and culturally inappropriate items of clothing.</p>
<p>But now an outpouring of statements from minority workers have often exposed systematic racism beneath veneers of corporate civility.</p>
<p>Days after the LA-based sustainable brand Reformation donated to Black Lives Matter, Reclaim the Block, Black Visions Collective, the NAACP and the ACLU, they too were criticised for their internal practices by a black former employee, Elle Santiago.</p>
<p>“Being overlooked and undervalued as a woman of color who worked and managed their flagship store for three years was the hardest,” Santiago wrote in an Instagram post picked up by industry watchdog Diet Prada. “I cried many times knowing [that] the color of my skin would get me nowhere in the company.”</p>
<p>Santiago said she was denied work promotions in favor of white colleagues, as well as being ignored by the company founder, Yael Aflalo, because of her race. “I’ve failed,” Aflalo posted as an apology at the weekend and announced a diversity and inclusion board, a personal donation of $500,000 and an independent investigation into the company’s workplace culture. She stepped down from running the company on Friday.</p>
<p>It’s a similar story at Urban Outfitters, according to a former employee who spoke to the Guardian.</p>
<p>“As one of very few PoC [people of color] I quickly noticed the toxic environment I’d joined,” says the former employee, who wishes to remain anonymous. “Within my first month my manager made a flippant racist comment in regards to an Uber I’d called; the driver’s name was Muhammad. Her comment was, ‘You would get a Muhammad’ – in what I can only take as a comment made because of my heritage.</p>
<p>“There’s no PoC in the executive team and very little representation of PoC in head office, on the website, marketing campaigns and within the retail management teams.”</p>
<p>The company has a history of producing offensive items of clothing, including a seemingly blood-spattered T-shirt seen as a reference to the 1970 Kent State shootings; a T-shirt in a color named “Obama/Black”; another featuring a six-pointed badge, which seemed to allude to the Star of David badge that Jewish people were forced to wear during the Holocaust; and a racially insensitive Navajo line which used the Navajo nation name illegally.</p>

<p>The Guardian contacted Urban Outfitters for comment and they shared an internal email that said: “We support and stand with the black community and we recognise that we all must do more than we’ve done to date.”</p>
<p>The company added it would commit to attracting “a more diverse internal and external workforce.”</p>
<p>Fashion industry observers say the reckoning is long overdue.</p>
<p>Many complain that non-white voices have been sublimated by white executives, and it is important now that these emerging testimonies are listened to and bring change. It is seen as especially important, because there’s been a theme of some fashion-centric companies benefitting from either diversity on the shop floor, or on their webpages or in their advertising campaigns, deliberately adding a cultural “edge” to their aesthetic.</p>
<p>For example, the Urban Outfitters website sells T-shirts featuring black groups such as Wu-Tang Clan and TLC, musicians such as Aaliyah and Jimi Hendrix, and ones featuring the logo from Death Row records, which was co-founded by Dr Dre. “[They are] profiting from black culture and have done for decades,” said the ex-employee. “The least they can do is show genuine alliance and support the black community.”</p>
<p>The race issues of companies such as Urban Outfitters and Reformation also shows a deep misunderstanding of the consumers they should be serving, fashion watchers say.</p>
<p>“This generation feels comfortable not having only one way to be themselves,” says Kati Chitrakorn, Vogue Business’s retail and marketing editor. “Their search for authenticity creates a greater freedom of expression, and a greater openness to understanding different kinds of people. But it also means they scrutinize brands more carefully.”</p>
<p>Frustration with the perceived corporate hijack of minority identity can be seen in the recent dissident Pride marches, which have championed “queer liberation not rainbow capitalism”, in a critique of the official marches, which have become an advertising showcase for corporations who sponsor floats rather than an echo of the radical message of the original protesters of Stonewall.</p>
<p>Historically, shoppers have used fashion as a social identifier, but many consumers these days want more. “Successful brands realize they are part of society and have a role to play, and will cater to teens’ craving for authenticity” says Chitrakorn. “It’s also why, for a generation of buzzy brands, making consumers feel kinship takes precedence over selling product.”</p>
<p>That’s why the current chorus of public apologies might not cut it unless they come with concrete action.</p>
<p>“Changing yourself before talking about your changes will be vital,” says RJ d’Hond from data consulting company Kantar, “and only if it is a full company intent, not a marketing or communication department idea.”</p>
<p>In this landscape, people will spot fakes. “If a brand suddenly activates content around a cause it does not have a history of supporting, it will appear superficial and transactional,” says Conor Begley, co-creator of influencer analysts Tribe Dynamics.</p>
<p>He cites Rihanna’s Fenty as a brand that has effectively taken on social issues, supported by Rihanna’s own advocacy on social justice issues and the brand’s hiring of diverse influencers and models from the off.</p>
<p>“As a result, the brand’s recent contributions to racial justice conversations on social media do not appear hollow or performative, but rather an authentic expression of the values Fenty has always stood for,” Begley says.</p>
<p>So what should fashion do as the great unmasking roars on?</p>
<p>“It’s time to clean house and get things in order,” says Karen Binns, fashion director of Fashion Roundtable. “The consumer will be asking for receipts, so get ready.”

<h3 id="fewer-than-100-new-daily-infections-reported-for-first-time-in-over-week">&ldquo;Fewer than 100 new daily infections reported for first time in over week&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2020/06/F200613DC06-1024x640.jpg" alt="img">
Outgoing Health Ministry director Moshe Bar Siman-Tov tells Kan radio that he was surprised by the speed at which Israel seems to have been hit by a second wave of the coronavirus. But he adds that a new lockdown is not a given.</p>
<p>“We can still be relatively optimistic and flatten the curve without a lockdown. We need to keep the guidelines, especially regarding masks. There was an issue in keeping people aware that the corona was not a one-off that came and went. We need to convince the public of how important it is. I think the public, and everybody, was quite tired.”</p>
<p>Sunday is set to mark his last day on the job, after Prof. Chezy Levy was confirmed as his replacement earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Bar Siman-Tov defends his decision not to fire deputy Itamar Grotto, who was exposed as giving a billionaire a pass to ignore virus rules, saying that Levy will deal with it and “there are facts which are still not clear.”

Is the wanton killing of cells in autoimmune disease a case of mistaken identity, or does it arise from an important physiological service? The first is the commonly accepted view – that autoimmune attack is a sort of mistake. But the latter view may be closer to the truth, according to a new model proposed by researchers at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Among other things, the model suggests a solution to the long-standing riddle of why some organs are susceptible to autoimmune diseases while others are not. The findings were published today in Immunity.</p>
<p>Yael Korem Kohanim, a research student in the lab of Prof. Uri Alon in the Institute’s Molecular Cell Biology Department, who led the study, explains that autoimmune diseases can be divided into two types – systemic ones like lupus that attack many organs in the body and the ones like type-1 diabetes that affect just one organ. One of the riddles about this second, organ-specific type of autoimmune disease is why some organs get autoimmune diseases while others do not. The pancreas is an extreme example: The insulin-producing beta cells that make up 2-4% of the pancreas are highly prone, while the rest of the pancreas almost never gets autoimmune diseases. Likewise, Hashimoto’s-thyroiditis affects the thyroids of some 7% of the population, whereas the parathyroid glands right next to them almost never get autoimmune syndromes. These organ-specific autoimmune diseases tend to follow a similar pattern, arising in children or young adults (unlike genetic diseases that appear at birth, or those of aging), and they involve the destruction of cells that secrete essential hormones. Immune cells called T-cells somehow identify these endocrine cells as dangerous and eradicate them on contact.</p>
<p>Korem Kohanim, Alon and the research group, including Avichai Tendler and Avi Mayo and Prof. Nir Friedman in the Immunology Department asked: What if the T cells are meant to kill these cells all along?</p>
<p>Keeping supply matched to demand</p>
<p>The researchers hypothesized that T cells might be “kept on the payroll” as an extra layer of protection to ensure the amounts of hormones stay within narrow limits. The hormones – insulin, thyroid hormones, cortisol – tend to function in feedback loops; too little as harmful as too much. When demand for the hormone rises – for example, a demand for insulin when glucose is repeatedly sensed – the cells not only step up production, they ramp up cell division to help meet that demand. But cell division carries risks: A certain percentage of the new cells are likely to carry mutations. Most such mutations are harmless, but if one disrupts the cell’s delicate sensing machinery, the cell will misread the demand as high when it is actually low. The result is deadly: the cell will continue not only to pump out extra hormones, it will divide again and again to produce new cells with the same mutation, which will then divide again and produce even more of the hormone, soon causing severe disease.</p>
<p>They act as secret agents, removing cells that threaten to take over the organ and secrete too much hormone</p>
<p>T cells – immune cells that select their targets by recognizing small pieces of protein identifying the cells they are meant to kill – could conceivably target the over-secreting cells in healthy organs. They act, in this case, as secret agents, removing cells that threaten to take over the organ and secrete too much hormone. In autoimmune diseases, the T-cells might be primed to accomplish the same task, but get overzealous, and kill off non-mutant cells.</p>
<p>Was this hypothesis reasonable? Korem Kohanim Alon and the team delved into the literature and bioinformatics data on several single-organ autoimmune diseases, and they then created a mathematical model for the functioning of healthy organs in which small numbers of T cells kept a low profile. In this model, the organs stay fit and productive as long as the T cells have a means of being highly selective, so that most of their targets would be the mutated cells. This result agrees with the findings from research on the diseases showing that in each one, the T cells identify proteins specifically connected to the production or secretion of the target cells’ hormones. In healthy organs, those T cells could use the same identification codes to target any cells that are overproducing the hormones. In other words, autoimmune diseases could be the result of a trade-off: a layer of regulation preventing diseases linked to overproduction while risking the opposite effect in some people – reduced production.</p>
<p>The glands that refuse to pay the price</p>
<p>If other glands are not susceptible to autoimmune disease, does this mean they also forgo T cell protection? The team went back to the literature and found that the parathyroid, for example, is highly prone to non-cancerous growths called adenomas that are common in post-menopausal women, affecting as many as one in 50. These adenomas secrete huge amounts of hormone, causing a disease called hyperparathyroidism. Other examples, though less dramatic than the parathyroid adenomas, supported the idea that a lack of T cell intervention, as the model would suggest, could result in unchecked hormone-secretion and cell growth.</p>
<p>“The model explains a number of puzzling findings,” says Korem Kohanim. “For example, we looked at genetic sequences of T cells found in healthy people, and noted that some of them indeed have the exact same protein-identifying receptors as the T cells found in those with autoimmune diseases. The explanation has always been that the apparently healthy people have a mild form of the disease, or one in its initial stages. But the findings are more logical if you assume these auto-reactive T-cells are meant to be there; that they are meant to keep us from getting diseases of cell division and hormone over-production.”</p>
<p>So far, says Korem Kohanim, the model provides a solution to a riddle that has long plagued researchers, though experimentation is needed to see if its claims can be borne out. But it has already garnered interest in the field and is generating discussion among top immunologists. The team in Alon’s lab collaborated in this research with the group of Prof. Nir Friedman in the Immunology Department, and they are continuing to collaborate on means of testing the model’s results experimentally.</p>
<p>“We think that autoimmune diseases do not come out of nowhere. They are a malfunction, but one of a physiological system that is already in place,” she says. “We follow in the footsteps of pioneers at Weizmann, Irun Cohen and Michal Schwartz and their students, who emphasized the immune system as tending our bodies as well as fighting pathogens,” says Uri Alon, “I can’t wait to see if this theory is fruitful in the sense of generating new experiments that will teach us about the mysteries of autoimmune diseases.”</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn01.cdn.justjared.com/wp-content/uploads/headlines/2019/06/yael-slams.jpg" alt="img">
Scooter Braun‘s wife Yael is coming to his defense and slamming Taylor Swift‘s accusations!</p>
<p>The 32-year-old philanthropist took to her Instagram to call out the singer on displaying bullying behavior.</p>
<p>“I have never been one for a public airing of laundry, but when you attack my husband… here we go,” she wrote. “Let’s start with @taylorsift, whoa. Then let’s get the facts straight. You were given the opportunity to own your masters, you passed. Interesting that the man you’re so “grossed out” by believed in you more than you believe in yourself.”</p>
<p>“And girl, who are you to talk about bullying? The world has watched you collect and drop friends like wilted flowers. My husband is anything but a bully, he’s spent his entire life standing up for people and causes he believes in…” Yael added.</p>
<p>“What you haven’t seen is what happens behind closed doors, when has supported and stood up for you. When he has challenged his clients to be kind or be quiet. When he has reached an olive branch out to you on numerous occasions,” she continued.</p>
<p>“Scott was so excited to work and build with you. How embarrassing this temper tantrum is because you didn’t get your own way. He believes in and supports you, I sincerely hope you can learn to love and believe in yourself the way my husband does.”
