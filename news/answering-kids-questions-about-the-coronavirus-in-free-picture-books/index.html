In India, where more than 250 million children have been affected by school closures, Worldreader is working with educational agencies and telecommunications companies to alert parents to its free e-reading service through WhatsApp and SMS group messages.</p>
<p>“The evidence is so overwhelming that without a literate and reading population, you can’t have a self-reliant, healthy population,” Mr. Risher said.</p>
<p>Other literacy organizations, nonprofits and subscription services have also opened up their e-book collections for children who are out of school. The digital reading platform Epic, which has more than 40,000 children’s e-books, has made its library available at no charge, allowing schoolteachers to give their students access to its e-books through June 30. Since the start of the pandemic, the nonprofit First Book has distributed more than a million print editions of children’s books, and has made downloadable e-books available to teachers to distribute to their students. In the past six weeks, teachers have used 724,000 download codes to access e-books for their students, surpassing the number of downloads for all of 2019, according to a spokeswoman for First Book. Scribd, an e-book and audiobook subscription service that includes 150,000 children’s and young adult titles, is offering free access to its digital library for 30 days. (One of the recommended reading lists is titled “Keeping kids busy at home.” “We’ve put together a list of kids’ books to help your household stay sane and even enjoy this time of forced family togetherness,” the description says.)</p>
<p>Worldreader remains focused on reaching children in the developing world, though they’ve discussed expanding to Europe and North America in the wake of school closures across those continents, Mr. Risher said, and the group’s BookSmart app is accessible in the United States and Britain.</p>
<p>Worldreader started with a trial program with e-readers in Africa in 2009, but a few years later the group shifted its focus to a mobile reading app for cellphones. Through partnerships with 426 different publishers, Worldreader built up a library of more than 12,000 e-books in more than 50 languages, including classics like “The Chronicles of Narnia” and contemporary best sellers like Mary Osborne’s “Magic Tree House” series and several of Neil Gaiman’s books for young readers. Penguin Random House has provided some 450 e-books for Worldreader’s library; Simon &amp; Schuster has made 100 of its titles available, and plans to add another 100 books for the BookSmart app.</p>
<p>“They have been very assiduous about identifying the communities that need these books,” said Carolyn Reidy, the president and chief executive of Simon &amp; Schuster. “Everyone’s at home, and everybody does not have the ability to do distance learning.”

<h3 id="recommending-books-is-high-risk--but-its-also-high-reward">Recommending books is high risk – but it&rsquo;s also high reward</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ab837990ef29a00ebc439530e4d829a2eb5225f/0_662_4416_2650/master/4416.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=5cfadb6d97152139c889369c657d8c5e" alt="img">
Recommending books is a tricky but satisfying business. It’s high risk, high reward. Every day I wake up to messages from my friends asking me to recommend “something I’d like” to them. That’s not even a clear directive but still, challenge accepted. And that was before the lockdown.</p>
<p>Now, I’m being asked for lists of books for people to read. So. I dutifully drag myself out of bed and go to my bookshelves. I spend a few minutes thinking about the person. What do we speak about, most of all? Is it politics, is it love? What makes them laugh? What makes them angry? Then I think about whether or not the content of some books might be challenging, or triggering.</p>
<p>I even provided this recommendation service to a woman who took the time to email my website, telling me, across seven fulsome paragraphs, why my novel Queenie was a terrible book, and how disappointed she was by my representation of a black British woman. She got, in return, a list of books about black British women that she might not hate so vehemently.</p>
<p>Woefully, nobody recommends any books to me, the great recommender, but as a gift to you all, here are the three books I tell absolutely everyone to read: Ordinary People by Diana Evans, How to Love a Jamaican by Alexia Arthurs and Citizen by Claudia Rankine.

<h3 id="a-letter-from-the-editors-of-the-book-review">A Letter From the Editors of the Book Review</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/19/books/review/19Letters-1/19Letters-1-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
To Our Readers:</p>
<p>What an unusual and terrible time this is for all of us — with people’s lives at risk, and many lost so far; with the vast majority of us confined to our homes or, out of necessity, precariously trying to work outside our homes. There is much to mourn, much to be grateful for and much cause for worry and fear.</p>
<p>Apart from the obvious life-and-death matters at stake, we at the Book Review are especially concerned for those whose livelihoods depend on books. We think of the authors whose book tours have been canceled, authors who depend on income from teaching, authors who need money from speaking engagements to supplement their advances. All of those opportunities, temporarily — and in some cases, permanently — gone.</p>
<p>Our hearts go out to the debut authors of the season, many of whom spent years, perhaps a lifetime, waiting for the dream moment when their first book would make its way into the world. We think of the authors whose publication dates have been delayed, complicating not only their financial lives but all other plans, professional and personal. We think of the authors whose new books are coming out right now, at a moment when the realities of everyday life can feel all-consuming, and when libraries are shuttered and many bookstores have closed or laid off workers.
