Where to Stream: Outer Banks Powered by Reelgood</p>
<p>If you’ve been looking for a new vacation spot, Netflix has a suggestion. This April the streaming giant released Outer Banks, which is half steamy teen thriller and half an ad for the Carolinas. Have you been wondering where the gorgeous locations in this new drama are and how you can visit them? We have your back.</p>
<p>Outer Banks revolves around a group of friends who get swept up in a centuries-old treasure hunt. But right now we don’t care about that fictional shipwreck or which 20-something smokeshow playing a teenager is hottest. Here’s where Outer Banks was actually filmed — and more importantly here’s how you can see these idyllic locales for yourself.</p>
<p>Where Is Outer Banks Filmed? Is Outer Banks Filmed in the Outer Banks, North Carolina?</p>
<p>That’s a big N-O. Despite sharing its name with the North Carolina barrier islands, Outer Banks was actually filmed in Charleston, South Carolina. According to Star News Online, the production originally looked to shoot in Wilmington, North Carolina. That was always the location series creator Jonas Pate envisioned for his show. But Netflix pushed back on that location because of anti-LGBTQ legislation that dated back to 2016. The decision was ultimately made to film in Charleston, a change that the series’ creators and stars have vocally supported.</p>
<p>But not everyone has been happy with the change of location. Many Outer Banks and North Carolina locals have expressed their outrage over filming in Charleston. Some have ever called out the show for its incorrect use of foliage.</p>
<p>Was Hurricane Agatha in Outer Banks Real?</p>
<p>Yes and no. There was a real Hurricane Agatha, but it didn’t come close to hitting North Carolina. It also technically wasn’t a hurricane. Tropical Storm Agatha emerged in May of 2010 and brought widespread flooding to large parts of Central America. The storm caused 204 fatalities and $1.1 billion in damage.</p>
<p>Where is Redfield Lighthouse in Outer Banks?</p>
<p>That being said, North Carolina has had its share of powerful hurricanes. Eleven Category 3 hurricanes and one Category 4 have hit the area since 1879. The most recent major storm was Hurricane Fran in 1996. But judging by the fact that John B and Pope were able to surf during the Hurricane Agatha, that fictional storm was definitely less severe. The most recent hurricane to hit North Carolina was Hurricane Irene, which landed on the Outer Banks as a Category 1 in 2011.</p>
<p>Sadly, there is no Redfield Lighthouse. But there is a Morris Island lighthouse! All of this series’ lighthouse scenes were filmed in the Morris Island lighthouse in South Carolina. North of Folly Beach and near the southern entrance of Charleston Harbor, the beacon for boaters was first constructed in 1876. But because of the erosion of the shoreline, Morris Island Light didn’t remain the city’s primary lighthouse for long. It was decommissioned in 1962 and replaced by the Charleston Light. Today it’s part of the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
<p>Where Is The Wreck Restaurant in Outer Banks?</p>
<p>Wondering if you can eat at Kiara’s (Madison Bailey) family restaurant? Open up those wallets because you can — sort of. There is a restaurant called The Wreck in the real Outer Banks. Located on Hatteras Island, The Wreck Tiki Bar and Food has been open since 2011. It looks a little different than Netflix’s South Carolina interpretation of the place, but this place is the most authentic bang for your buck.</p>

<h3 id="outer-banks-leaders-discuss-staged-reopening-dare-day-2020-cancelled">Outer Banks leaders discuss staged reopening; Dare Day 2020 cancelled</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.obxtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Checkpoint-031720.jpg" alt="img">
Dare County leaders have started discussions of a possible staged reopening of access to the Outer Banks in the near future that could follow similar guidelines to what state officials shared on Wednesday about restarting the economy.</p>
<p>The Town of Manteo has also decided to cancel the 2020 Dare Day celebration due to the uncertainties still surrounding the future and the ongoing COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>There have been no changes in the number of positive COVID-19 cases in Dare County over the past four days, according to Thursday’s bulletin from the Dare County Control Group.</p>
<p>Dare County remains at 15 positive test results. Of the 15 individuals who have tested positive, 13 have recovered/or are asymptomatically cleared (meaning they are seven days post testing with no symptoms), one is asymptomatic (meaning they have not experienced any COVID-19 symptoms), and one died.</p>
<p>In North Carolina, there are currently 5,465 cases of COVID-19 in 94 counties. There have been 131 fatalities in NC associated with COVID-19. Currently, the state is reporting 452 hospitalizations across the state from COVID-19 illness.</p>
<p>“With the economic hardships created by the COVID-19 crisis, many in the community are anxious for a timeline to establish expanded entry to the County. Dare County’s Stay Home – Stay Healthy order aligns with the Governor’s Stay at Home Order and is effective through April 29,” the control group’s news release stated.</p>
<p>The control group, made up of representatives of the local, state and federal government units that have authority in Dare County, will continue to have serious discussions about ways to most effectively balance the health of the community and the economic impacts, in order to make decisions that are in the best interest of all as the expiration of the closure order approaches.</p>
<p>It is likely that a staged entry process will be implemented to allow non-resident property owners entry before allowing entry to visitors, the control group said.</p>
<p>As decisions on entry are made, consideration is being given to the Governor’s actions regarding the state’s Stay at Home order, the scientific data including trends and models that are frequently changing, the capacity of local health providers, and the ability of local merchants to provide essential goods and services.</p>
<p>Governor Roy Cooper on Wednesday said the state needs to make more progress in testing, tracing and trends, and that reopening North Carolina’s economy would have to be done in stages.

<p><img src="https://media.graytvinc.com/images/Outer+Banks+OBX+Cape+Hatteras.jpg" alt="img">
The lack of tourists on the Outer Banks during the coronavirus pandemic has been creating large piles of uncollected seashells.</p>
<p>A Facebook video posted Monday by the Cape Lookout National Seashore shows a multitude of colorful shells spread out across the beach as waves splash over them.</p>
<p>The Charlotte Observer reports that while park facilities are closed, both Cape Lookout and Cape Hatteras national seashores in the Outer Banks are open to residents.</p>
<p>The shells remain uncollected since visitors tend to gather them during the springtime.</p>
