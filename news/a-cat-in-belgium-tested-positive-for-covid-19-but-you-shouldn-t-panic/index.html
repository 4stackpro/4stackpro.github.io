Health officials in Belgium say a pet cat appears to have contracted COVID-19 from her owner, though they emphasized human-to-pet transmission seems to be extremely rare.</p>
<p>“Recently, the veterinary medicine faculty in Liège reported that a coronavirus infection has been determined in a cat,” virologist Steven Van Gucht said at a Federal Public Service Health press conference on Friday, The Brussels Times reported﻿. “The cat lived with her owner, who started showing symptoms of the virus a week before the cat did.”</p>
<p>The cat had diarrhea and breathing trouble, and researchers subsequently found the novel coronavirus in her feces. As of Saturday, both cat and owner were reportedly doing well.</p>
<p>“We want to stress that this is an isolated case,” Van Gucht said. “Additionally, in this case, we are talking about a human-to-animal transmission, not the other way around. There are no indications that this is common. The risk of animal-to-human transmission is very small.”</p>
<p>Nils Jacobi via Getty Images A cat in Belgium (not pictured) may be the first known case of a feline contracting COVID-19.</p>
<p>Those sentiments were echoed by Jane Sykes, chief veterinary medical officer at the University of California, Davis. Cats and dogs, she said, may be “dead-end” hosts for the virus, meaning they could become infected but don’t shed enough of the virus to transmit it to humans other animals.</p>
<p>So far, there are no known cases of pets transmitting the virus to people, but there’s not enough data to tell for sure if that’s possible. But generally, “you’re more likely to get infected from another person,” Sykes told HuffPost.</p>
<p>Previously, two dogs in Hong Kong tested positive for the virus and were asymptomatic. At least one of those dogs tested “weakly positive,” leading some experts to believe the dog could be merely carrying traces of the virus in its nose or fur, rather than being truly infected. But Sykes said the levels of virus found in the cat, plus the cat’s symptoms, suggest true infection, but noted that further tests ― like checking to see whether the cat has developed antibodies for the virus ― are needed.</p>
<p>“It’s not really very surprising to hear of an infected cat,” she said, explaining that cats and ferrets were able to contract the similar virus that caused the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s. But there was no evidence of cats transmitting that virus to humans. (She also noted that ferrets became much sicker from the virus than cats did.)</p>
<p>That said, the case of the Belgian cat means pet owners and veterinarians should be on the lookout for any possible symptoms consistent with COVID-19 in cats, dogs and other mammals (especially ferrets), Sykes said. And pet owners who have the illness should take precautions to minimize any risks.</p>
<p>Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Veterinary Medical Association recommend having another person in your household care for your pets if you are sick with COVID-19, if possible. If that’s not possible, wash your hands before and after interacting with pets; regularly wash their bowls, bedding and toys; and wear a face mask if you can.</p>
<p>If a pet has come into contact with an infected person and you’re worried about exposure from the virus surviving on the animal’s fur, some experts suggest bathing pets with species-appropriate shampoo or wiping them down with soapy cloth and water.</p>
<p>Sykes also stressed the importance of the “human-animal bond” and noted that no one should abandon or euthanize their pets out of fears over COVID-19. And she continues to see it as a good thing that so many people are spending their extra time at home with animal companions.</p>
<p>“That would still be strongly encouraged,” she said.

<h3 id="the-curious-case-of-the-cat-with-corona">The curious case of the cat with corona</h3>
<p><img src="https://fsyv2fdkkw2xd3knut4uab98-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cat-c-an-min-pxhere-1024x601.jpg" alt="img">
Among the headlines from yesterday’s meetings of the newly-empowered government and the national security council, one that caught the eye was the announcement of a cat diagnosed with coronavirus caught from its owner.</p>
<p>The cat was reported to have caught the virus from close contact with its owner, who had recently returned from Italy. When the cat became ill, its stool was examined and traces of the virus discovered.</p>
<p>The experts were quick to reassure pet owners that the case was exceptional, that animals were not considered a vector for the disease, and that there was no reason to be afraid either for their pets or for themselves.</p>
<p>But one animal virologist has raised questions about the whole story.</p>
<p>Hans Nauwynck is a professor at the faculty of veterinary medicine at the University of Ghent, and a specialist in virology. The news of the corona cat took him by surprise.</p>
<p>“Before sending this news out into the world, I would have had some other tests carried out,” he told Het Laatste Nieuws. “When you hear about this right now, I wouldn’t wish to be a cat tomorrow.”</p>
<p>The discovery was made by the vet faculty at Liege university, who concluded the infection passed from human to cat and not the other way around.</p>
<p>“Look, I have no criticism of my colleagues at Liege university,” he stressed. “The diagnosis has been made, I’ve no doubt about the result, but we’re dealing here with a PCR test, a way of identifying genetic material of the virus.”</p>
<p>The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test allows scientists to multiply a very small sample of genetic material to produce a quantity large enough to study.</p>
<p>“I’m simply questioning the interpretation of the results. The test is positive for corona, fine, but how was the test carried out? How was the sample taken, and can that result be trusted? I would advise people to slow down. There may somehow have been genetic material from the owner in the sample, and so the sample is contaminated.”</p>
<p>To be absolutely certain, he said, more tests should have been done to confirm the initial result, and certainly before making an announcement to the world.</p>
<p>“I think it’s too bad they didn’t look further,” he said. “There should also have been research carried out to see if the cat had produced antibodies. I’m worried that people will be scared by this news and animals will be the ones to suffer, and that’s not right. As scientists we ought to put out clear and full information, and I don’t think that has happened.”</p>
<p>In the latest update, the cat is doing well. Its owner is also recovering, albeit more slowly.</p>

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption People are wanting their cats to be rehomed fearing they will catch the virus</p>
<p>Cat owners fear they will catch coronavirus from their pets with some asking for them to be rehomed, an animal charity has said.</p>
<p>Iris&rsquo;s Cats In Need in Stoke-on-Trent has received several calls from owners worrying their pets will make them sick.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization said there is no evidence that pets can be infected by Covid-19.</p>
<p>Volunteer Claire Jones said: &ldquo;You cannot catch this from a cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 42-year-old said the charity has had several calls about rehoming cats, &ldquo;Mostly, it&rsquo;s people who haven&rsquo;t got access to the right information online.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a nightmare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are worried about somebody stroking the cat outside and passing it on to them. It doesn&rsquo;t work like that,&rdquo; she told the Local Democracy Reporting Service.</p>
<p>Iris&rsquo;s Cats In Need said self-isolation has led to a drop in the number of people able to help.</p>
<p>Food donations are also down as panic buying hits supermarkets, it said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re worried about running out of food. I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve had any at our collection point at Tesco, in Kidsgrove, but we do know they&rsquo;ve had a short supply,&rdquo; Ms Jones said.</p>
<p>She said no cats have so far been left at the charity, but it has had &ldquo;a lot of requests&rdquo; for cats to be rehomed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got 12 cats to add to our waiting list now&hellip; We do try to help people if they do have problems with their cats first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a lot of nervous people out there, but we need to be clear your pets are not going to get you sick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now is the time to get a pet because you&rsquo;re going to be home a lot.&rdquo;</p>
