NBA美國職籃明尼蘇達灰狼隊明星中鋒Karl-Anthony Towns，今天在個人社群軟體上PO出影片，除了透露自己的母親染上現在大流行的武漢肺炎，目前插著呼吸器陷入昏迷，也呼籲大家重視疫情的危險。</p>
<p>Towns的母親Jacqueline Cruz過去曾是護士，在影片中Towns透露，上週父母不太舒服，他告訴家人要小心注意，並且要立即就醫，結果父親順利出院，沒想到母親的病情極速惡化。</p>
<p>（Towns透過影片呼籲大家正視疫情的嚴重程度）</p>
<p>Towns的母親在住院期間，始終高燒不退，體溫一直在華氏103度（攝氏39.4度）左右，就算服藥後體溫也沒低於華氏101.9度（攝氏38.8度）。</p>
<p>「她非常不舒服，她肺部的狀況越來越糟，而且咳得很厲害。」Towns難掩激動地表示，媽媽的身體在他們眼前不斷惡化，他們懷抱希望下一種藥物會有效，只要下一個療程結束，病情就會緩解，不過Towns難過的說：「但她每天還是持續惡化。」</p>
<p>Towns透露，某天母親的狀況看似好轉，沒想到病情急轉直下，肺部狀況持續變糟，如今甚至已經昏迷需要戴上呼吸器。</p>
<p>Towns強調，他會說出自己家人與病魔奮鬥的故事，就是希望能讓更多人留在家裡避免出門，並希望大家提供更多資源幫助正在與病毒對抗的醫護人員。</p>
<p>Karl-Anthony Towns</p>
<p>3月初，Towns就已率先捐出10萬美元（約新台幣305萬元）給梅奧診所（Mayo Clinic），做武漢肺炎相關測試的費用。Towns說道：「這些疾病是真的，不能被輕忽，拜託保護你的家人、你愛的人，你的朋友以及你自己。」Towns繼續說：「這種病是致命的，我們必須擊敗它，而且面對這場戰役，我們必須贏得勝利。」</p>

The mother of NBA All-Star Karl-Anthony Towns has died due to complications from Covid-19, her family has confirmed. Jacqueline Cruz-Towns was 58.</p>
<p>“Jackie was many things to many people – a wife, mother, daughter, grandmother, sister, aunt and friend,” the Towns family said in a statement. “The matriarch of the Towns family, she was an incredible source of strength; fiery, caring, and extremely loving person, who touched everyone she met. Her passion was palpable and her energy will never be replaced.”</p>
<p>Towns posted a video to social media in March, describing how his mother had been placed into a medically induced coma after contracting the virus. “I think it’s important that everyone understands the severity of what’s happening in the world right now with the coronavirus, and I think where my life is right now could help, so I decided to do this video and give you an update of where I’m at,” Towns said at the time.</p>
<p>Towns’s father, Karl Sr, had also contracted the virus but is now understood to have recovered. Towns has mentioned his close relationship with his mother in several interviews during his career.</p>

<p>Towns’s team, the Minnesota Timberwolves, paid tribute to Cruz-Towns’s role in her son’s career. “Jackie provided constant and positive energy for him and was beloved by our entire organization and staff at Target Center as she supported her son and the Timberwolves,” the team said in a statement. “The League, teams, and players have come together in their support of Jackie and Karl and we are grateful for our NBA family.”</p>
<p>The Towns family also thanked medical staff for their support. “The Towns family is extremely grateful for the outpouring of love and support they have received during this very difficult time,” the family’s statement continued. “They would like to thank the medical warriors at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center and JFK Medical Center, who fought for Jackie day in and day out, and helped Karl Sr from the same virus that took Jackie’s life.”</p>
<p>The 24 year-old Towns, who was the No1 overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft, grew up in New Jersey and his mother worked at the state’s Rutgers University for 20 years. New Jersey and neighbouring New York are at the centre of the Covid-19 outbreak in the US.

The Minnesota Timberwolves announced Monday afternoon that the mother of center Karl-Anthony Towns died from the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The Towns family is heartbroken by the untimely passing of Jacqueline Towns due to complications as a result of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Jackie, as she was affectionately known among family and friends, had been battling the virus for more than a month when she succumbed on April 13.</p>
<p>Jackie was many things to many people – a wife, mother, daughter, grandmother, sister, aunt, and friend. The matriarch of the Towns family, she was an incredible source of strength; a fiery, caring, and extremely loving person, who touched everyone she met. Her passion was palpable and her energy will never be replaced.</p>
<p>The Towns family is extremely grateful for the outpouring of love and support they have received during this very difficult time. They would like to thank the medical warriors at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center and JFK Medical Center, who fought for Jackie day in and day out, and helped Karl Sr. recover from the same virus that took Jackie’s life.</p>
<p>The family is devastated by their tremendous loss, and respectfully requests privacy in this time of great mourning.</p>

<p>One week ago, John Calipari, Towns’ former college coach at Kentucky, said Jackie was still battling in the ICU.</p>
<p>“I would say to everybody out there, Ms. Jackie, Karl Towns’ mother, is still in that hospital. She’s fighting, she’s there,&rdquo; Calipari said Monday. “We get updates, every single day we get an update from Karl Sr. about how she’s doing from the nurses at the ICU. Keep praying for her. Send her unbelievably positive thoughts. I just can’t wait until she gets out of that hospital.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Karl-Anthony Towns, who was born in Edison, raised in Piscataway and played his high school basketball at St. Joseph, posted an emotional video on Instagram three weeks ago detailing his mother’s fight with the coronavirus.</p>
<p>In the video, which described how his mother was in a coma, Towns said that his father, Karl Sr., was released from the hospital and had been told to self-quarantine as they awaited the results of his COVID-19 test.</p>
<p>Towns’ agent later told ESPN that Karl Sr. tested positive for the coronavirus and that he’s “recovering well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his 5-minute, 47-second Instagram video, Karl-Anthony Towns explained that his mother was hospitalized, on a ventilator and in a medically-induced coma. According to Towns, both of his parents recently became ill, then his mother’s fever spiked and she quickly deteriorated.</p>
<p>Among the people to reach out to Towns during his mother’s illness was Utah Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell, one of the 10 active players in the NBA to be diagnosed with the coronavirus.</p>
