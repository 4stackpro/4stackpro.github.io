Clocks across the country are set to spring forward an hour at 2:00 a.m. on Sunday for daylight saving time, but with a few exceptions.</p>
<p>Neither Sonora nor Quintana Roo will change their clocks for trade and tourism reasons, while 33 northern border municipalities in the states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo León, Coahuila, Chihuahua and Baja California have already changed theirs.</p>
<p>Their time changed on March 8 to be in sync with communities across the border. For them, daylight saving ends November 1.</p>
<p>For the rest of the country daylight saving time remains in effect until October 25.</p>
<p>The practice was first implemented in Mexico in 1996 during the administration of President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de León to make better use of daylight hours and conserve electricity.</p>
<p>But calls to end the practice have surfaced in Sinaloa and Mexico City in recent years, as opponents cite international trade and health concerns as reasons to let the clocks run their course unaltered.</p>
<p>President López Obrador has a long history of challenging daylight saving time, causing some to speculate that his administration might put it to a public referendum, possibly ending the practice, but no such move has been made.</p>

<h3 id="dont-forget-the-clocks-are-changing-tonight-as-daylight-saving-time-comes-to-an-end">Don&rsquo;t forget! The clocks are changing TONIGHT as daylight saving time comes to an end</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/04/02/26794994-0-image-a-31_1585962939378.jpg" alt="img">
Most Australians will get an extra hour of sleep on Sunday morning as daylight savings comes to an end in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>Smartphones and computers will automatically turn clocks back an hour at 3am on April 5, but analogue clocks need to be changed manually.</p>
<p>At a time where stress and anxiety are high due to the coronavirus pandemic, sleep experts say maintaining good sleep patterns can keep people from falling into a cycle of restlessness.</p>
<p>Graphic showing the difference in time zones across Australia. Includes changes for daylight saving time which ends Sunday April 5 2020</p>
<p>The sun won&rsquo;t start to rise until around 7am but natural light will extend later into the afternoon as the days become shorter.</p>
<p>DST will begin again on the first Sunday of October, which is October 4, 2020, and will end on the first Sunday of April, which is April 4, 2021.</p>
<p>It applies in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria but is not used in Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>Sleep Health Foundation&rsquo;s David Hillman said stress is at an all-time high due to the coronavirus but people must maintain a healthy sleeping pattern.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anxiety and stress are not good bedfellows with decent sleep,&rsquo; Mr Hillman told AAP.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If the sleep is disturbed &hellip; then tiredness during the daytime tends to feed the anxiety and make sleep more difficult. So it&rsquo;s a bit of a vicious cycle there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What is Daylight Savings Time (DST)?</p>
<p>Australia is divided into three time zones known as Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST), Australian Central Standard Time (ACST) and Australian Western Standard Time (AWST).</p>
<p>In Australia, Daylight Savings Time is when clocks go forward by one hour for the winter and one hour back in the summer.</p>
<p>Germany was the first country to adopt DST in 1916 as a way to reduce fuel usage during the war and after its success, it was taken on by other countries. It was used again during World War II.</p>
<p>Tasmania was the first to implement Daylight Savings Time in 1968 and other states did the same in 1971. Queensland stopped participating in 1971.</p>
<p>However, five years later, a referendum was held in NSW asking whether or not DST should be adopted on a permanent basis, but the majority voted in favour of the clocks being put back and forward.</p>
<p>Which states do not participate in Daylight Savings Time?</p>
<p>Daylight Savings Time is observed in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria.</p>
<p>It is not used in Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>Benefits and drawbacks of Daylight Savings Time</p>
<p>In Australia, Daylight Savings Time is less popular in rural areas because farmers are affected by the changes in time.</p>
<p>However, changing the clocks does not create extra daylight because people are just adding an hour of natural sunlight to their days.</p>
<p>The extra daylight encourages people to get out of the house and do more outdoor activities as well as provide a boost to the tourism industry.</p>
<p>Studies have also shown that DST can make people sick because of the disruption to body clocks or circadian rhythms.

In self-isolation and amidst the breakout of a deadly virus many of us have forgotten we’ll soon have to reset our clocks. Yes, that’s right – daylight savings is coming to an end.</p>
<p>It means for those of us in certain states you might feel a tad more refreshed when, or if your alarm goes off on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>When does daylight savings finish in Victoria, Tasmania, the ACT and NSW?</p>
<p>Daylight savings will end at 3am. It means at 3am, or whenever you wake up, you’ll have to set your clock or watch back one hour.</p>
<p>If you rely on your smartphone to tell the time, most will automatically adjust to the right time for you.</p>

<p>For iPhone users, just go to general, then settings followed by date and time. If this is set to automatic then your phone will adjust the time based on whichever time zone you’re in.</p>
<p>What time does daylight savings finish in South Australia?</p>
<p>South Australia observes the same rules as Victoria and NSW. The state will finish its daylight savings at 3am on Sunday, local time.</p>
<p>However, the state is in a different time zone and follows Australian Central Standard Time.</p>
<p>It’s half an hour behind Australian Eastern Standard Time which is observed in Victoria and NSW.</p>
<p>Broken Hill, despite being in NSW, also observes ACST as it’s close to the border of South Australia.</p>
<p>Daylight savings in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory</p>
<p>Queensland, WA and the Northern Territory don’t have daylight savings.</p>
<p>The sunshine state’s thoughts on daylight savings has been particularly divisive among residents.</p>
<p>Queensland abolished it in 1992.</p>

<p>A bill to have it reinstated was also defeated in 2011.</p>
<p>The two states and territory all have different time zones to each other too. Queensland honours AEST except without the daylight savings component.</p>
<p>When does daylight savings start in 2020?</p>
<p>Daylight savings will start in the states and territories which observe it on the first Sunday of October, 2020.</p>
<p>This year that’s October 4, which means anyone waking up on that Sunday might feel a tad sleepier.</p>
<p>Instead of clocks being set back an hour at 3am, they’ll be set forward an hour at 2am.</p>
<p>How does daylight savings affect my sleep?</p>
<p>The change to daylight saving time will probably affect how much sleep people get in the days following the initial change, according to Dr Elise McGlashan, research fellow at the Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, Monash University.</p>
<p>Daylight savings might affect how you sleep in the following days given you&rsquo;re possibly losing an hour in bed when we change back. Source: Getty Images (file pic) More</p>
<p>“Some people might notice that with the change, they don’t sleep as long as they normally would. The clock on our phones might change right away, but the ones in our body do not,” she told Yahoo News Australia.</p>
<p>Our core body clock, located in the brain, helps us to sleep and wake at regular times. When we change the clocks for daylight saving, our internal clock doesn’t want to go to sleep until our normal bedtime - according to standard time - which is now an hour later.</p>
<p>“But we still have to wake up at the same time for work. So, we usually end up sleeping a bit less for those first few days,” Dr McGlashan said.</p>
