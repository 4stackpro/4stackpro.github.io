Businesses that have suffered sharp downturn are eligible for wage subsidies of $1,500 a fortnight per employee for up to six months</p>
<p>Australia to subsidise wages of up to 6m workers in $130bn coronavirus plan</p>
<p>The Australian government has earmarked $130bn towards wage subsidies over the next six months in an extraordinary bid to stave off further job losses as the economy faces a sharp downtown during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Up to 6m workers could be eligible for wage subsidies of $1,500 per fortnight, which the Australian Tax Office will pay directly to businesses that have suffered sharp drops in turnover. Such businesses will required to pay at least that amount to workers – including those who have been stood down since 1 March.</p>
<p>Scott Morrison described the measure as an “economic lifeline” at a time when the nation was fighting twin battles “against a virus and against the economic ruin that it can threaten”.</p>
<p>Coronavirus Australia live news: Scott Morrison announces $1,500 a fortnight &lsquo;job keeper&rsquo; payment to employers worth $130bn – latest Read more</p>
<p>The prime minister warned that the disruption caused by the pandemic was such that many countries would see their economies collapse in the months ahead.</p>
<p>“We could see countries themselves fall into chaos – this will not be Australia,” Morrison told reporters in Canberra on Monday. “We will get Australians through this, with uniquely Australian solutions to deal with the unique Australian challenges we face here.”</p>
<p>Morrison confirmed parliament would have to be recalled to pass the legislation, possibly as soon as next week.</p>
<p>The announcement came as officials confirmed that Tasmania and ACT had experienced their first Covid-19 related deaths.</p>
<p>As of Monday afternoon, there have been 4,245 confirmed cases of the illness across Australia with 18 deaths.</p>
<p>The deputy chief medical officer, professor Paul Kelly, said while there had been a decrease in the daily growth in cases, it was “not a time to take the foot off the brake” as attempts must continue to slow the spread of the virus. He said 55 people remained in intensive care units at present. Kelly also committed to release more detail about the modelling that underpins the government’s health measures, after growing calls for the rationale to be explained at length.</p>
<p>Morrison was due to have another teleconference with state and territory leaders on Monday evening, just a day after the national cabinet agreed to tougher restrictions on social interactions, including limiting gatherings with others outside the household to two people.</p>
<p>The new $1,500 JobKeeper payment is an about-face for the Morrison government, which resisted union calls for a wage subsidy until employer groups joined the push last week, warning that the previous economic stimulus packages were not enough to support Australians’ jobs.</p>
<p>The new wages subsidy aims to help employers maintain relationships with employees, even as increasingly strict restrictions force more and more businesses – particularly retail and hospitality - to shut their doors.</p>
<p>Affected businesses are those that suffer a drop in turnover of at least 30% - or at least 50% in the case of large employers with more than $1bn of turnover.</p>
<p>The government says the flat payment of $1,500 per fortnight will be available for full and part time workers, sole traders, and casuals who have been with an employer for 12 months or more.</p>

<p>“We want to keep the engine of our economy running through this crisis,” Morrison said. “It may run on idle for a time but it must continue to run.”</p>
<p>The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said the wages subsidy built on other economic stimulus and support measures announced over the past month.</p>
<p>“At a cost of $130bn over the next six months, we are providing support to the Australian worker like never before,” he said. “Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.”</p>
<p>As the coronavirus crisis has led to tighter and tighter restrictions, including forced shutdowns of certain businesses, the government has had to dramatically ratchet up the level of support to prop up the economy and support laid-off workers.</p>
<p>Just over one week ago, the government announced an effective doubling of the jobseeker payment, previously known as Newstart, over the next six months, which prompted long queues to form outside Centrelink offices across the country.</p>
<p>On Monday the secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sally McManus, revealed that the union body believed 1m workers had been stood down or laid off since the start of the crisis, while the Centre for Future Work estimated the figure could rise to more than 2m within weeks, pushing unemployment to 20%.</p>
<p>The OECD has estimated that Covid-19 shutdowns could see 22% of Australia’s economic activity directly lost due to shutdowns.</p>
<p>It assumed a full shutdown in the arts, entertainment, recreation, transport manufacturing and other personal service sectors; declines of three-quarters of activity in hotels, restaurants, air travel, retail and wholesale trade; and declines of one half in construction and professional service activities.</p>
<p>McManus told reporters a $1,500 fortnightly payment was “highly inadequate”. The ACTU has lobbied for workers to receive a subsidy of 80% of their former wage, up to a cap of 80% of the median wage, or $1,375 a week.</p>
<p>McManus also took aim at the “simply bad communication by governments, state and federal, that led to panic” among employers.</p>
<p>The Morrison government had suggested employers “could let people go and they’d be looked after by the social security system” while state governments had suggested that some employers were not essential, she said.</p>
<p>“[It] was a bit bungled really &hellip; and we woke up to a whole lot of workplaces standing down or just sacking their employees.”</p>
<p>On Monday the shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, promised Labor would support “any additional measures which will get more help to more Australians more quickly” - but warned while it would be constructive it would not be “silent”.</p>
<p>“Where there are obvious gaps or where there are obvious flaws or where there is a lack of urgency, we will make those points as well,” he said.</p>
<p>Chalmers said wage subsidies had been delayed because the Coalition had dismissed “sometimes ridiculing, the good ideas that Labor and others in our community, the unions, have put forward”.</p>
<p>The government also confirmed on Monday that it would temporarily ease the partner income test that applies to the JobSeeker Payment. It will now be available to eligible people so long as their partner earns less than $79,762 a year. Previously it was set around $48,000, meaning that many recently laid-off workers would have missed out on the payment.

People placed in hotels to self-isolate for 14 days as part of a government effort to contain coronavirus say they are not being permitted to leave rooms or open windows</p>
<p>Dinner at the five-star InterContinental hotel in Sydney is a plastic container of “unidentifiable food”. The sauce is lukewarm but chunks of meat are still frozen inside.</p>
<p>For Paula Lemmon, who has multiple serious food allergies, two small containers of chopped tomato and cucumber are the only meals she has been able to eat in almost 24 hours since arriving back in Australia and being placed in hotel quarantine.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen a few comments that it’s a five-star hotel and people shouldn’t be complaining,” Paula’s daughter, Olivia, told Guardian Australia. “We completely understand travellers are a high risk – we are 100% for quarantining. We’d be happy to be in a caravan.</p>
<p>“But we’re not staying at a five-star hotel, we’re staying at a government-run quarantine centre and we’re not getting basic needs.”</p>
<p>Similar stories are emerging in Sydney and elsewhere as Australians returning from overseas are put into an enforced 14-day quarantine in city hotels. People say they are not permitted to leave rooms or open windows.</p>

<p>Olivia, her partner Chloe Steffensen and mother Paula arrived in Australia early on Sunday morning. Paula had been visiting Olivia and Chloe, both vets working in the UK, when the coronavirus outbreak worsened.</p>
<p>When they arrived in Sydney, they were put on buses with other travellers and kept onboard for about three hours.</p>
<p>Since arriving about 1.30pm on Sunday, the only food available has been the meals supplied by the hotel.</p>
<p>“When the food arrives it is vacuum-sealed, unidentified food,” Olivia said. “It’s really, really bad. It’s been heated up, you can feel that it’s warm but all the chunks of meat were cold.”</p>
<p>Each time food has been delivered, no allowance has been made for Paula’s dietary requirements.</p>
<p>“When we tell the hotel she cannot eat the food, they just send up cucumber and tomato for Mum. She’s literally starving. And I know that sounds very over the top, but she got off the plane yesterday morning and all she’s been offered since is cucumber and tomato.”</p>
<p>For breakfast on Monday, they were given a bread roll, a small croissant and a container of porridge to share between three.</p>
<p>A friend has offered to cook meals and deliver them to the hotel, but no deliveries have been allowed.</p>
<p>“The hotel manager said: ‘You have to realise you’re not staying in a hotel, the hotel is shut, you don’t have the services of a hotel,’” Olivia said.</p>
<p>“We’re all for the quarantine, but the way we’ve been treated has been worse than criminals. We asked if we can have some fresh air. We have windows but they don’t open and we’re not allowed to leave the room.</p>
<p>“We need to know who is in control at the moment. The staff are just doing what they’re told. Even the manager said he was in no position to change any of the rules that were in place. It’s fine to keep us here but we need our basic human rights respected.”</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest Home for 14 days: a room at the InterContinental. Photograph: Supplied by Olivia Lemmon</p>
<p>The InterContinental Sydney general manager, Jennifer Brown, said in a statement the government had put in place “extremely strict rules around the way we operate … and these will inevitably have some impact on the quality of service delivered”.</p>
<p>“It includes a requirement that only three meals are delivered a day, medication and baby formula may be delivered to guests, and nothing else. Let me assure you that every guest staying at InterContinental Sydney has received their three meals per day since they arrived, and that all dietary requirements have been accounted for.”</p>
<p>However, people sent to other Sydney hotels said they had been allowed deliveries from friends, and to order food from hotel restaurant menus.</p>
<p>One woman who landed in Australia after eight years living in the US, told Guardian Australia that she, her husband and two-year-old son were taken to the Novotel in Darling Harbour, where they were given a room and a uniformed police officer was guarding every floor.</p>
<p>While stressing that she did not think her family’s circumstance was “unique or desperate”, the woman, who asked not to be named, was critical of the government for the way the policy had been implemented and said people should be allowed breaks outdoors.</p>
<p>During the long wait before arriving at the hotel yesterday, the woman said, officials appeared to have little idea what the process was supposed to be. The family were not allowed to use baggage trolleys to transport their luggage and she said she watched as airport security, airline staff and Border Force officials argued over whose job it was to assist passengers making their way through the terminal.</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest Breakfast for three, provided to people in quarantine at the InterContinental Sydney. Photograph: Supplied by Olivia Lemmon</p>
<p>The passengers were given no food during the lengthy wait on the bus, and the woman’s two-year-old son was able to only eat snacks that the group’s bus driver and a sympathetic police officer provided.</p>
<p>“I think it all goes to the policy being announced and coming into force without sufficient time and understanding among the people who actually had to enforce it,” she said.</p>
<p>“There clearly just wasn’t time to do the necessary coordination. When you’re in these stressful circumstances and ask the people who are supposed to be in charge for information and the response is ‘I don’t know’, it’s not particularly reassuring.”</p>
<p>The woman said the food provided – which comes at allotted times – was fine, but that she and her husband were now gearing up to spend two weeks with a two-year-old in a single room with locked windows.</p>

<p>“We’ve got four Thomas the Tank books that I must have read 30 times on the trip over – I am ready to throw them in the fire – and some pens and markers,” she said.</p>
<p>“We’ve been drawing pictures with him and trying to stop him drawing on the hotel walls. I really think, like, my husband and I can survive two weeks inside and obviously so many people have it so much worse, but life with a toddler you can’t take outside is not going to be great. I really don’t see why we couldn’t be allowed breaks to walk around a park for an hour a day at least.”</p>
<p>Melbourne woman Catherine, who asked for her full name not to be used, has been sent to the Hyatt Regency hotel in Sydney. She said she and other guests had been given a per diem of $90 to spend on meals from the room service menu.</p>
<p>“That sounds like a lot but it doesn’t go very far,” she said. “Even if you want a cold, preprepared salad it’s quite pricey.”</p>
<p>Catherine said her room was dusty when she arrived on Sunday and appeared not to have been cleaned for several weeks, but that hotel staff had gone out of their way to be helpful.</p>
<p>“I’m still very concerned about air quality because we don’t have windows that open. My room when I opened up was super dusty.</p>
<p>“The hotel staff are trying to do their best and they’re being very polite, and any request they’re doing their best to accommodate. It does feel as though it’s a bit of a rush job to make a political statement that looks like the government is doing something.</p>
<p>“When you see what was happening at the airport just days before, we’re being scapegoated for those people who arrived before.</p>
<p>“Many of us are not from Sydney and had interstate transfers booked. We haven’t been given any guarantee that we’ll be able to get home when we’re allowed out of here.”</p>
<p>At a press conference on Sunday, the New South Wales police commissioner, Mick Fuller, appeared to dismiss many concerns about conditions in mandated quarantine accommodation.</p>
<p>“I know there will be people who are unhappy with the bed, the pillow, the heater, dinner and all those type of things,” Fuller said.</p>
<p>“The reality is they are in a hotel room and yes they will be isolated for 14 days. That is for their own protection, the protection of their family members and the protection of the NSW community.</p>
<p>“We can only take and listen to their complaints and try to reconcile them.”
