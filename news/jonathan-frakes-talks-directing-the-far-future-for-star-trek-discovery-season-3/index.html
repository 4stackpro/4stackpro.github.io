The latest edition of Star Trek Magazine (#75) has just arrived with a number of great features and interviews, including one with Star Trek: The Next Generation star (and Star Trek: Discovery and Picard director) Jonathan Frakes. One highlight from Frakes’ interview is his discussion about Discovery’s upcoming third season.</p>
<p>On finding a future and Burnham’s new POV</p>
<p>The focus character of Star Trek: Discovery has gone through a lot in the first two seasons. Frakes reveals where Michael Burnham finds herself now.</p>
<p>Discovery feels to me like my home show now. I just finished Episode 3, Season 3. We’re far in the future now and Burnham has been separated from the [Discovery] crew, and then they reunite. I was talking with Sonequa. We were talking about acting. She’s one of those actors – not unlike Patrick – where you can give a note and it’s like a fine musician. It’s just enough to get in tune on that particular beat, or that micro transition, as opposed to when you give a note to somebody who doesn’t have the technique, and they drop everything else and only play the note you’ve just given them. Sonequa and Patrick and most of these actors have that [technique]. I said to her, “This character is so appealing and interesting and complicated, and always has been, but there’s a little more joy [now].” She said to me, “Because Burnham is now no longer driven by fear and guilt.” I thought, “Wow.”</p>
<p>The second season ended with Martin-Green’s Burnham in the red angel suit flying ahead and leading the USS Discovery through a wormhole into the distant future. Some preview images and clips for the third season have shown Burnham along with a new character (Book, played by David Ajala) on some planet. Frakes’ comment indicates she and the rest of the Discovery crew will remain separated for the first couple of episodes.</p>
<p>The third season finds the crew of the USS Discovery 930 years in the future, setting the show beyond all known Star Trek canon. Frakes told STM about the practicalities of this challenge.</p>
<p>They are all so thrilled. That’s the adventure, technically, financially, emotionally. You can create worlds that nobody has seen before because you’re not limited by anything. That’s freeing. But it’s also completely exhausting because even a show this big has to stay on a budget. Everything can’t be created digitally. Some of the stuff has to be real. We just have to have some things you can touch. In the future, obviously, there could be a lot of stuff that’s holographic or where your mind is connected to something. These are all things we know are coming, just from the way we use our iPhones to run our lives and plan our trips. So, finding a future that’s futuristic but is practical to shoot has been fascinating. You can’t get caught up in the technology. It is about maintaining a basic core of why we’re there, which is to tell emotionally compelling stories. That has been the driving force, as opposed to the other way around. Nobody is making the mistake of, “This has to look cool.” It’s great when things look cool, but if you don’t give a damn about the people or what’s happening, it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>The third season of Star Trek: Discovery is currently in post-production. A teaser released last week promised it will arrive on CBS All Access “soon.”</p>

<p>For Discovery fans, there is also an interview with Hannah Cheesman (Airiam). The latest issue also includes interviews with Star Trek: Picard‘s Isa Briones (Soji), Michelle Hurd (Raffi), Alison Pill (Dr. Jurati), and Santiago Cabrera (Rios) as well as a feature exploring how other Star Trek iterations have approached the theme of artificial intelligence.

<h3 id="o-captain-my-captain-anson-mount-of-star-trek-discovery-dishes-on-possible-return-of-capt-pike">O Captain! My Captain! Anson Mount of &lsquo;Star Trek: Discovery&rsquo; dishes on possible return of Capt. Pike</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8M3PKwbcSzeBgUCb2Dvf3X-1200-80.jpg" alt="img">
Go on admit it, when the announcement was made in April 2018 that actor Anson Mount would be joining the cast of &ldquo;Star Trek: Discovery,&rdquo; most of you were probably wondering who Anson Mount was. His biggest television role prior to this was probably in the 1860s period drama &ldquo;Hell on Wheels,&rdquo; but he has also appeared in the shows &ldquo;Inhumans,&rdquo; &ldquo;Conviction&rdquo; and he even starred opposite Robert De Niro in the movie &ldquo;City by the Sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His journey to beloved Trek character began in January 2019 and he was quickly accepted with open arms into the &ldquo;Star Trek&rdquo; community. And, despite only appearing in one season so far, Mount quickly made his mark playing the firm, fair and unflappable Captain Pike. So how does Capt. Pike feel about &ldquo;Star Trek&rdquo;?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re talking to a Trekkie here,&rdquo; he told Space.com, not mincing any words.</p>
<p>Related: &lsquo;Star Trek: Discovery&rsquo; Season 3: What we know and what we hope for</p>
<p>Space.com caught up with the Tennessee-born actor while he was relaxing on his porch with his mom, Nancy Smith, a former professional golfer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s to blame actually,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;When it [Star Trek: The Original Series] started syndication on local TV here, she&rsquo;s the one who turned it on and told me I had to watch this. I asked her why and she told me it was about this group of people who fly around the galaxy and meet different aliens each week. And at first, I thought that&rsquo;s a terrible idea for a TV show and then I very quickly got hooked and I&rsquo;ve been a huge fan ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Capt. Pike is a key figure in &ldquo;Star Trek&rdquo; lore. He served on three Federation starships before being assigned to the USS Enterprise as Capt. Robert April&rsquo;s first officer. After five years, he was promoted to captain and was given command of the Enterprise (April was promoted to commodore) where he would serve as the ship&rsquo;s commanding officer for 15 years before the command of the Enterprise was transferred to James T. Kirk. During his tenure in Starfleet, Pike was considered to be one of the most highly decorated starship captains in Starfleet history.</p>
<p>Pike must witness his future in order to take a time crystal in &ldquo;Through The Valley of Shadows&rdquo; (S02, E12) (Image credit: CBS All Access)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was actually talking to them earlier in the year about the role of Captain Lorca and then they very wisely hired Jason Isaacs, who was great and did a much better job than I ever could have. But then when Pike was coming around, they called up and said, &lsquo;Hey, there&rsquo;s this other role, a new captain, would you mind putting yourself on tape?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Related: The &lsquo;Star Trek: Discovery&rsquo; search for Spock comes to a head in &lsquo;Light and Shadows&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I said, &lsquo;of course.&rsquo; And they sent me dummy scripts. So the character&rsquo;s name on the dummy scripts was Captain Parker. And I thought, &lsquo;Well that&rsquo;s a terribly unimaginative name for a captain. All right, fine. I&rsquo;ll do it.&rsquo; And I put myself on tape and then they called back the next day and they said, &lsquo;Okay, doing it and it&rsquo;s Captain Pike.&rdquo; And I just about fell out of my seat,&rdquo; Mount said.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the character of Capt. Pike has a tragic, preordained fate in &ldquo;Star Trek&rdquo; history.</p>
<p>Ten years after the events that we saw unfold in &ldquo;Star Trek: Discovery&rdquo; Season 2, Pike — who has been promoted to fleet captain — is severely injured while rescuing several cadets from a baffle-plate rupture onboard a J-class training vessel. The delta-ray radiation leaves him paralyzed, unable to speak, badly scarred and forced to use a brainwave-operated wheelchair for mobility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;New Eden&rdquo; (S02, E02) was the best episode in &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; Season 2 and that was because of Mount&rsquo;s portrayal of Pike (Image credit: CBS all access)</p>
<p>In the pilot episode of &ldquo;The Original Series,&rdquo; Pike was the captain of the USS Enterprise. In the episode, entitled &ldquo;The Cage,&rdquo; the Enterprise is en route to the Vega colony to deliver medical supplies but makes a stop to respond to a mysterious distress call coming from the crashed survey ship the SS Columbia on Talos IV. An away team beams down, but Pike (played then by Jeffrey Hunter) is abducted and held in a zoo-like cell. The Talosians take control of his mind, creating various illusions based on pleasure and pain in an &ldquo;experiment&rdquo; to observe his behavior.</p>
<p>Later, in &ldquo;The Original Series&rdquo; two-part episode &ldquo;The Menagerie&rdquo; (S01 E11 &amp; E12) the now-paralyzed Pike requests that he return to Talos IV and live out the rest of his life in the &ldquo;Matrix&rdquo;-like, illusion-induced dreamworld that the Talosians can offer, rather than be forever physically restricted in his cumbersome wheelchair.</p>
<p>While this destined ending is tragic, what life would&rsquo;ve unfolded for Christopher Pike if the training accident hadn&rsquo;t happened?</p>
<p>Related: &lsquo;Star Trek: Short Treks&rsquo; Review: Did Spock Just Laugh in &lsquo;Q&amp;A&rsquo;?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would want the best for him, certainly,&rdquo; Mount said. &ldquo;One of the few things I felt that I knew instinctively about Captain Pike coming in to play the role is that he probably had good parents and he definitely had good mentors … I think he would take a gracious retirement at some point. And I just think he&rsquo;d probably end up teaching at Starfleet if not being the Dean,&rdquo; he laughed.</p>
<p>Mount himself graduated from the University of the South, Tennessee, in 1995. He collected his MFA in theater from Columbia University in 1998 and went on to study acting at the Michael Howard Studios, also in New York City.</p>
<p>In a lip-quivering moment, the crew of the Discovery stand eyes front out of respect for Pike on the eve of battle in &ldquo;Such Sweet Sorrow&rdquo; (S02, E13) (Image credit: CBS All Access)</p>
<p>While Mount is new to the franchise, there&rsquo;s certainly a lot of &ldquo;Trek&rdquo; to look forward to. &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; Season 3 recently wrapped and Season 4 is rumored to be shooting back-to-back with Season 5, starting in July. &ldquo;Picard&rdquo; Season 2 has also been confirmed, &ldquo;Section 31&rdquo; has been given a second season (although principal photography for Season 1 has been delayed) plus there&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lower Decks,&rdquo; the Nickelodeon series, which is thought to be called &ldquo;The Prodigy,&rdquo; possibly a new movie directed by Noah Hawley and, rumor has it, two new, additional (so far unnamed)live-action shows.</p>
<p>In fact, when &ldquo;Star Trek&rdquo; overseer Alex Kurtzman said at the &ldquo;Picard&rdquo; press tour in January that two more live-action shows were planned, fans quickly reacted en masse on social media sharing their enthusiasm for one of these series to be about Capt. Pike, Ensign Spock (Ethan Peck) and First Officer Number One (Rebecca Romijn).</p>
<p>Related: &lsquo;Star Trek: Discovery&rsquo;s&rsquo; Ethan Peck talks about filling Spock-size boots</p>
<p>Kurtzman told The Hollywood Reporter that &ldquo;the fans have been heard. Anything is possible in the world of &lsquo;Trek.&rsquo; I would love to bring back that crew more than anything. It was a huge risk for us. One of the most gratifying things is to see how deeply the fans have embraced Pike, Spock, Number One, and the Enterprise. The idea of getting to tell more stories with them would be a delight for all of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When asked about this, Mount laughed, &ldquo;I keep having to dissuade people from the idea that actors know anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These decisions are usually made by people that you and I have never met and may never meet. And they have to determine how they want to go forward with the franchise and if I can continue to serve in that capacity, I&rsquo;d love to do that. But they&rsquo;ve got a lot of fish to fry and they&rsquo;ve got a lot of spreadsheets to consider. I&rsquo;m just happy that I don&rsquo;t have to do that. Because I&rsquo;d be terrible at it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I mean you&rsquo;re talking to a Trekkie who, I mean, just to sit in the captain&rsquo;s chair is one of the rarest honors of being a modern actor. Not a lot of people have been asked to do it. I&rsquo;m certainly grateful that I was entrusted with that responsibility. And yes, of course I&rsquo;d love to continue to occupy that chair. I&rsquo;m not going to grouse around and be aloof about it. I&rsquo;d love to.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="new-star-trek-discovery-teaser-promises-season-3-is-coming-soon">New ‘Star Trek: Discovery’ Teaser Promises Season 3 Is Coming Soon</h3>
<p><img src="https://scifanatic-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/dsc-s3teasesoon-head.jpg" alt="img">
The season one finale of Star Trek: Picard released today on CBS All Access was preceded by a very brief tease for Star Trek: Discovery. It didn’t show any new footage, but featured star Sonequa Martin-Green’s Michael Burnham on an alien world, proudly holding a flag for (what’s left of) the United Federation of Planets.</p>
<p>The only other thing of note in the brief tease was the ending title card, which promised the next season was “coming soon.” Production for the third season of Discovery was completed in February and it is currently in post-production, which is being done remotely.</p>
<p>The second season of Star Trek: Discovery ran from January through April of 2019. CBS All Access went without any new Trek content for six months until October when it began the second season of Short Treks which ran through to January 2020, just as the first season of Picard premiered. To avoid churn on All Access, CBS is likely keen to deliver new original Star Trek programming as soon as possible. The inclusion of the teaser with Picard indicates the next Star Trek show headed to All Access is likely to be Discovery’s third season. Another anticipated show in development for delivery this year is the first season of the animated comedy Star Trek: Lower Decks.</p>
<p>If you want to see the Discovery short teaser it is available now on CBS All Access. It was also shared by executive producer Alex Kurtzman who promised “Starfleet embarks on a new mission soon – Star Trek: Discovery Season 3 is on its way.”</p>

<p>Star Trek: Discovery is available exclusively in the USA on CBS All Access. It airs in Canada on the CTV Sci-Fi Channel (formerly called Space) and streams on CraveTV. It is available on Netflix everywhere else. The cast and crew are currently shooting season three.</p>
