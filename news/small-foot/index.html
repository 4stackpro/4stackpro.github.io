<h3 id="leopold-ii-belgium-wakes-up-to-its-bloody-colonial-past">&ldquo;Leopold II: Belgium &lsquo;wakes up&rsquo; to its bloody colonial past&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F8C6/production/_112868636_gettyimages-1219053331.jpg" alt="img">
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Leopold II ruled Belgium from 1865-1909 - activists want this statue in Brussels removed due to his brutal regime in Congo Free State</p>
<p>Inside the palatial walls of Belgium&rsquo;s Africa Museum stand statues of Leopold II - each one a monument to the king whose rule killed as many as 10 million Africans.</p>
<p>Standing close by, one visitor said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know anything about Leopold II until I heard about the statues defaced down town&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The museum is largely protected by heritage law but, in the streets outside, monuments to a monarch who seized a huge swathe of Central Africa in 1885 have no such security.</p>
<p>Last week a statue of Leopold II in the city of Antwerp was set on fire, before authorities took it down. Statues have been daubed with red paint in Ghent and Ostend and pulled down in Brussels.</p>
<p>Leopold II&rsquo;s rule in what is now Democratic Republic of Congo was so bloody it was eventually condemned by other European colonialists in 1908 - but it has taken far longer to come under scrutiny at home.</p>
<p>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Before a renovation in 2018, Belgium&rsquo;s Africa Museum was known as the world&rsquo;s &ldquo;last colonial museum&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last week thousands in the country of 11 million joined solidarity protests about the killing of US black man George Floyd in police custody.</p>
<p>A renewed global focus on racism is highlighting a violent colonial history that generated riches for Belgians but death and misery for Congolese.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone is waking up from a sleep, it&rsquo;s a reckoning with the past,&rdquo; explains Debora Kayembe, a Congolese human rights lawyer who has lived in Belgium.</p>
<p>Statues defaced and removed</p>
<p>Like statues of racist historical figures vandalised or removed in Britain and the US, Leopold II&rsquo;s days on Belgian streets could now be numbered.</p>
<p>On Monday the University of Mons removed a bust of the late king, following the circulation of a student-led petition saying it represented the &ldquo;rape, mutilation and genocide of millions of Congolese&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Joëlle Sambi Nzeba, a Belgian-Congolese poet and spokesperson for the Belgian Network for Black Lives, says the statues tell her she is &ldquo;less than a regular Belgian&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Thousands marched in Black Lives Matter protests in Belgium</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I walk in a city that in every corner glorifies racism and colonialism, it tells me that me and my history are not valid,&rdquo; she explains from the capital.</p>
<p>For activists the holy grail is the giant statue of Leopold II on horseback at the gates of the Royal Palace in Brussels. A petition calling on the city for its removal has reached 74,000 signatures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will dance if it comes down. I never imagined this happening in my lifetime,&rdquo; Ms Kayembe adds. It would be &ldquo;really significant for Congolese people, especially those whose families perished,&rdquo; she explains.</p>
<p>She does not believe it will not be quick or easy. There are at least 13 statues to Leopold II in Belgium, according to one crowd-sourced map, and numerous parks, squares and street names.</p>
<p>Warning: This piece contains graphic pictures</p>
<p>One visitor to the Africa Museum, where an outdoor statue was defaced last week, disagreed with the idea of removing them - &ldquo;they&rsquo;re part of history,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>A king who still commands praise</p>
<p>On Friday the younger brother of Belgium&rsquo;s King Philippe, Prince Laurent, defended his ancestor saying Leopold II was not responsible for atrocities in the colony &ldquo;because he never went to Congo&rdquo;. The royal palace is yet to give its own response.</p>
<p>For many years Leopold II was widely known as a leader who defended Belgium&rsquo;s neutrality in the 1870-71 Franco-Prussian war and commissioned public works fit for a modern nation.</p>
<p>Image copyright Reuters Image caption This TV image shows a statue of Leopold defaced and damaged by fire being removed in Antwerp</p>
<p>In 2010, former Belgian foreign minister Louis Michel and the father of future prime minister Charles Michel, called Leopold &ldquo;a hero with ambitions for a small country like Belgium&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In a TV debate this week, a former president of the Free University of Brussels, Hervé Hasquin, argued there were &ldquo;positive aspects&rdquo; to colonisation, listing the health system, infrastructure, and primary education he said Belgium brought to Central Africa.</p>
<p>Colony built on forced labour and brutality</p>
<p>&ldquo;Civilisation&rdquo; was at the core of Leopold II&rsquo;s pitch to European leaders in 1885 when they sliced up and allocated territories in what became known as the Scramble for Africa.</p>
<p>He promised a humanitarian and philanthropic mission that would improve the lives of Africans.</p>
<p>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Colonial officials amputated and mutilated Congolese people, including children, as punishment</p>
<p>In return European leaders, gathered at the Berlin Conference, granted him 2m sq km (770,000 sq miles) to forge a personal colony where he was free to do as he liked. He called it Congo Free State.</p>
<p>It quickly became a brutal, exploitative regime that relied on forced labour to cultivate and trade rubber, ivory and minerals.</p>
<p>Archive pictures from Congo Free State document its violence and brutality.</p>

<p>In one, a man sits on a low platform looking at a dismembered small foot and small hand. They belonged to his five-year-old daughter, who was later killed when her village did not produce sufficient rubber. She was not unique - chopping off the limbs of enslaved Congolese was a routine form of retribution when Leopold II&rsquo;s quotas were not met.</p>
<p>Colonial administrators also kidnapped orphaned children from communities and transported them to &ldquo;child colonies&rdquo; to work or train as soldiers. Estimates suggest more than 50% died there.</p>
<p>Killings, famine and disease combined to cause the deaths of perhaps 10 million people, though historians dispute the true number.</p>
<p>Leopold II may never have set foot there, but he poured the profits into Belgium and into his pockets.</p>
<p>He built the Africa Museum in the grounds of his palace at Tervuren, with a &ldquo;human zoo&rdquo; in the grounds featuring 267 Congolese people as exhibits.</p>
<p>Image copyright RMCA Tervuren; A. Gautier, 1897 Image caption Congolese people were forced to be human exhibits in a &ldquo;zoo&rdquo; in Belgium in 1897</p>
<p>But rumours of abuse began to circulate and missionaries and British journalist Edmund Dene Morel exposed the regime.</p>
<p>By 1908, Leopold II&rsquo;s rule was deemed so cruel that European leaders, themselves violently exploiting Africa, condemned it and the Belgian parliament forced him to relinquish control of his fiefdom.</p>
<p>Belgium took over the colony in 1908 and it was not until 1960 that the Republic of the Congo was established, after a fight for independence.</p>
<p>When Leopold II died in 1909, he was buried to the sound of Belgians booing.</p>
<p>Image copyright Alamy Image caption Missionaries documented amputations while investigating abuses committed in Congo Free State</p>
<p>But in the chaos of the early 20th Century when World War One threatened to destroy Belgium, Leopold II&rsquo;s nephew King Albert I erected statues to remember the successes of years gone by.</p>
<p>This makeover of Leopold&rsquo;s image produced an amnesia that persisted for decades.</p>
<p>Calls for apologies</p>
<p>The current protests are not the first time Belgium&rsquo;s ugly history in Congo has been contested in the streets.</p>
<p>In 2019, the cities of Kortrijk and Dendermonde renamed their Leopold II streets, with Kortrijk council describing the king as a &ldquo;mass murderer&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And in 2018, Brussels named a public square in honour of Patrice Lumumba, a hero of African independence movements and the first prime minister of Congo, since renamed the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Congolese independence hero Patrice Lumumba is commemorated in a Brussels square</p>
<p>Last year a UN working group called on Belgium to apologise for atrocities committed during the colonial era.</p>
<p>Charles Michel, prime minister at the time, declined. He did however apologise for the kidnapping of thousands of mixed-race children, known as métis, from Burundi, DR Congo and Rwanda in the 1940s and 1950s. Around 20,000 children born to Belgian settlers and local women were forcibly taken to Belgium to be fostered.</p>
<p>What next for the statues?</p>
<p>Statues of Leopold II should now be housed in museums to teach Belgian history, suggests Mireille-Tsheusi Robert, director of anti-racism NGO Bamko Cran. After all, destroying the iconography of Adolf Hitler did not mean the history of Nazi Germany was forgotten, she points out.</p>
<p>Image copyright AFP Image caption This bust of Leopold II was removed on Friday in Auderghem, near Brussels</p>
<p>In Kinshasa, the capital of DR Congo, Leopold II&rsquo;s statues were moved to the National Museum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leopold II certainly does not deserve a statue in the public domain,&rdquo; agrees Bambi Ceuppens, scientific commissioner at the Africa Museum. But taking the monument away does not solve the problem of racism, she believes, while creating one museum devoted to the statues would not be useful either.</p>
<p>In DR Congo itself, no-one has really noticed the Belgian protests, says Jules Mulamba, a lawyer in the south-eastern city of Lubambashi. He attributes colonial crimes to the king himself, rather than the Belgian people or state.</p>
<p>Beyond removal of statues, far more work is required to dismantle racism, protesters and black communities argue.</p>
<p>For decades, colonial history has been barely taught in Belgium. Many classrooms still have Hergé&rsquo;s famous cartoon book Tintin in the Congo, with its depictions of black people now commonly accepted as extremely racist.</p>
<p>Belgium&rsquo;s education minister announced this week that secondary schools would teach colonial history from next year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing that everyone is waking up, looking around and thinking &lsquo;is this right?'&rdquo; says Ms Kayembe.</p>

<p>New Zealand-based Build Tiny created the Bitser Tiny House, a two-story 19.7-foot long towable home on wheels.</p>
<p>The home was created out of extra material that was unused by previous builds, such as leftover windows and kitchen cabinets. But besides producing the tiny home with recycled pieces in mind, Build Tiny also wanted the interior design to reflect an &ldquo;airy look&rdquo; filled with light.</p>
<p>Biter was purchased by Build Tiny&rsquo;s designer who &ldquo;fell in love&rdquo; with the build during construction and decided to purchase the mobile home before the company could publicly list it, according to its maker. While this particular build has already been sold, Build Tiny can create custom replicas for customers interested in a similar tiny home on wheels.</p>
<p>The tiny Bitser is 7.9 feet by 19.7 feet, and sits at around 7,121 pounds, allowing it to be easily towed, according to Build Tiny&rsquo;s YouTube video tour of the tiny home. But like any non-tiny, non-mobile home, the Bitser comes with a bedroom, living room, kitchen, dining area, and bathroom.</p>
<p>Keep scrolling to see inside Bitser, which was completed in March and cost around $84,746 including appliances.

Play some tunes: The UX with the 8-speaker Lexus Premium sound system is definitely for audiophiles. I heard pieces of songs that I haven’t heard since … the last time I drove a Lexus. It came as part of a $2,200 package that provided a 10.3-inch navigation screen and tilt/telescoping wheel (which didn’t slide out as far or as high as I would have liked).

<p>Precautions that shopkeepers are taking:</p>
<p>With markets reopening as part of unlock 1.0, buzz is gradually returning to the market places, but with a new set of rules. Sanitizers at the entrance, to limited entry of customers in the shops, is the new normal, which is being followed in most of the shopping areas in Kanpur.“We are following all the guidelines laid down by the governmen,” says a shop owner in Kanpur.A shopkeeper in Naveen Market has demarcated places where the customers should ideally stand. “Since I am diabetic and have hypertension too, I am going all out to safeguard myself. Apart from sanitising my shop, myself and the customers, I am also spraying it on the curency that I am taking. I am leaving no stone unturned to be safe,” says he.Most shops aren’t allowing customers to touch or try items. Manish Arya , owner of a garment shop says, “Firstly, people who are actual buyers are only stepping out to shop during this time. So, footfall has fallen miserably. And those are coming also, we aren’t letting them touch anything. We ask them to see the items from a distance. It is only after they select a piece that we give them a new piece from our stock.”Ashish, a manager at a watch shop in the market, shares, “Apart from regular sanitisation of the customers’ hands and checking if they are wearing masks, we have put a huge poster of the dos and don’ts at the shop. Plus, we are not letting people touch anything. We are also keeping a close watch on our sales people to check if they are following the rules and regulations.”Pankaj Ahuja, owner of a shop in Civil Liones area says, “I have installed small foot sanitizer machines in my shop for the customer and even for my staff. I have deployed one person on my shop to just keep a check on the staff and the customers to see if they are following proper social distancing and sanitisation norms. Also, I am only allowing a limited number of customers at a time in my shop.”Nishan Chowdhary, owner of an artificial jewellery shop is only letting one customer enter his shop at a time. “Space is a major issue in a small shop that I have. And since I am alone handelling everything, I make sure that only one customer enters the shop and I sanitise their hands properly and check their temperature. Plus, I have also started preferring digital mode of payment for purchases,” he says.- Sanitising customers’ hands, temperature checks, providing customers with masks- Not allowing customers to touch items – and if they do, the products are sanitised- Providing customers with fresh pieces from the stock after they&rsquo;ve selected items and bargained the price- Some shops not allowing customers to enter, while some are allowing only three-four people at a time

<p><img src="https://images.wsj.net/im-197514/social" alt="img">
After months of home workouts, even fitness enthusiasts like myself are suffering plank and push-up fatigue. Luckily, as coronavirus lockdowns slowly lift, people have more options for exercise. If you aren’t ready to rush back to the gym, here are four fresh workouts that take advantage of small spaces and summer weather. With minor adjustments, they can all be done in a backyard or park. If you don’t have weights, get creative with household items.</p>
