The joy that former Tennessee wide receiver Jauan Jennings was feeling after being drafted by the 49ers was undeniable.</p>
<p>The club used the No. 217 pick of the 2020 NFL Draft to select Jennings, and the receiver could not contain his enthusiasm. He had an ear-to-ear grin for the majority of his video call with local Bay Area Media and revealed that he had been “too excited to stop jumping around the house” with his family.</p>
<p>Gah y’all! Him and his momma gives me all the feels! 49ers&hellip;.LETS GO!!! pic.twitter.com/L1qtPXPG2r — Christie (@christie0106) April 25, 2020</p>
<p>Jennings met with the 49ers at the NFL Scouting Combine and while they were positive about many aspects of his game, they were also very honest about what the former Volunteer needed to work on.</p>
<p>“They loved my film, they loved my tape,” Jennings said. “They just really needed me to basically dive deep in myself to work harder, and I take that upon myself to do so.”</p>
<p>Jennings is 6-foot-3, 215 pounds with a similar build to his former Tennessee teammate Jalen Hurd. Jennings’ film shows he is a physical receiver with strong hands, who uses his body to dominate defensive backs.</p>
<p>Jennings admires physical receivers, modeling his game after NFL free agent receiver Brandon Marshall and Cleveland Browns Jarvis Landry. Jennings broke 30 tackles in the 2019 season with Tennessee, according to Pro Football Focus, the most in the country.</p>
<p>“Definitely going to bring that physicality to every game,” Jennings said. “That’s always been a part of me. That’s not just in the blocking game, because I do love to block, but that’s also when it comes to me catching the ball.</p>
<p>“Great receiver after the catch, and I take pride in that, and I believe in myself to be able to do that at a high level.”</p>
<p>[49ERS INSIDER PODCAST: Listen to the latest episode]</p>
<p>Jennings is familiar with coach Kyle Shanahan’s offensive system after watching the post season and knows it will be a challenge to learn. If he had his choice, he’d already be at the team facility getting started.</p>
<p>“I’m just excited to get there and be a part of a great team that they already have,” Jennings said. “Just for me to come there it’s a blessing and I’m extremely grateful and I can’t wait to go and work my butt off for them. They gave me a chance and I’m just going to do my best not to disappoint.”</p>

<p>The 49ers developed Deebo Samuel into a key part of the offense in his 2019 rookie campaign, and Jennings would love to follow in his footsteps. With Jennings&rsquo; size and physicality, it’s not a stretch that he could grow into a similar role.</p>
<p>“He’s always had that dog, that great attitude that I’m going to bring as well,” Jennings said of Samuel. “And Jimmy Garoppolo, you got him in the backfield throwing the rock. It’s just going to be hard to stop us in my mindset. We got a lot of weapons and I just can’t wait to go out there and help.”

<h3 id="san-francisco-49ers-trade-away-matt-breida-marquise-goodwin">San Francisco 49ers trade away Matt Breida, Marquise Goodwin</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.tsn.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1231377!/fileimage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/matt-breida.jpg" alt="img">
MIAMI — Running back Matt Breida was traded to the Miami Dolphins by the San Francisco 49ers for a fifth-round draft pick Saturday.</p>
<p>The 49ers used the pick to select West Virginia tackle Colton McKivitz.</p>
<p>Breida, who is from Brandon, Florida, averaged 5.0 yards per carry in three seasons with the 49ers and has 67 career receptions. Last year he rushed for 623 yards in 13 games but saw little action late in the season.</p>
<p>Breida is likely to share playing time with Jordan Howard, who was acquired in free agency last month. The Dolphins ranked last in the NFL in rushing in 2019, and 37-year-old quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick was their leading rusher.</p>
<p>Breida signed a restricted free agent tender this month worth about $3.3 million. The 49ers still have running backs Raheem Mostert, Tevin Coleman, Jeff Wilson Jr. and Jerick McKinnon under contract for 2020.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Eagles have acquired wide receiver Marquise Goodwin from the San Francisco 49ers.</p>
<p>The teams flipped sixth-round picks with Philadelphia getting No. 210 and San Francisco receiving No. 190.</p>
<p>Goodwin spent his first four seasons with Buffalo and past three in San Francisco. He has 140 receptions for 2,323 yards and 13 TDs in his career.</p>
<p>Goodwin has been plagued by injuries and played 16 games only once in 2017 when he had career highs in receptions (56) and yards (962).</p>
<p>The Eagles selected TCU wideout Jalen Reagor with the 21st overall pick. The 29-year-old Goodwin joins veterans DeSean Jackson, Alshon Jeffery, Reagor, 2019 second-round pick J.J. Arcega-Whiteside and Greg Ward, among others.

<h3 id="49ers-reportedly-trade-rb-matt-breida-wr-marquise-goodwin">49ers reportedly trade RB Matt Breida, WR Marquise Goodwin</h3>
<p><img src="https://arizonasports.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/patrick-peterson-breida-49ers-cardinals.jpg" alt="img">
Shortly after the San Francisco 49ers agreed to a trade that would net them left tackle Trent Williams from the Washington Redskins, they agreed to trade away two players.</p>
<p>Running back Matt Breida has been traded to the Miami Dolphins and wide receiver Marquise Goodwin was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter.</p>
<p>For Breida, the 49ers received a fifth-round draft pick, which they used on West Virginia offensive tackle Colton McKivitz.</p>
<p>They had traded away their own fifth-round pick in the Williams deal. San Francisco was short on draft capital and had not made a selection since the first round.</p>
<p>The 49ers have a deep group of running backs that includes Tevin Coleman, Raheem Mostert and, when healthy, Jerick McKinnon.</p>
<p>Breida had 123 carries for 623 yards and one touchdown last season.</p>
<p>The 49ers improved their sixth-round pick with the Goodwin trade. The Eagles agreed to swap sixth-rounders for Goodwin, allowing San Francisco to jump from No. 210 to 190.</p>
<p>Goodwin had a hot stretch during the 2017 season and finished with 962 receiving yards, but he had fewer than 400 yards in 2018 and just 186 yards last season.</p>
<p>49ers’ three trades today: 🏈 WR Marquise Goodwin and a 6th-round pick (210) to the Eagles’ for a 6th-round pick (190). 🏈 RB Matt Breida to the Dolphins’ for a 5th-round pick. 🏈 A fifth-round pick this year and third next year to Washington for OT Trent Williams. — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) April 25, 2020</p>
<p>While the 49ers have now lost Goodwin and fellow wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders this offseason, they drafted Arizona State wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk in the first round.</p>
<p>An NFC West division foe to the Arizona Cardinals, the 49ers are trying to return to the Super Bowl after falling to the Kansas City Chiefs last season.</p>
