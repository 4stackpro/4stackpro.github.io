<p>Netflix and WWE Studios have been doing deals lately, and The Big Show Show is the first of those deals to see the light of day (the film The Main Event premieres on April 10). It stars Big Show (aka Paul Wight), 7 feet tall and 400 pounds. Can he pass as a beleaguered sitcom dad? Read on for more…</p>
<p>THE BIG SHOW SHOW: STREAM IT OR SKIP IT?</p>
<p>Opening Shot: A shot of an airplane, then we see an older lady tell a teenager “… and that’s how I named my eighth poodle after my fourth husband.”</p>
<p>The Gist: The teenager, who politely tells the woman, “You know the ding means that the fasten seat belt sign is off, not that it’s time to share?” is Lola (Reylynn Caster), a teenager who is moving to Tampa from Minnesota to live with her father; her mother got a great job in Belgium, and Lola thought it would be a good opportunity to get closer to her dad, whom she sees mostly on FaceTime.</p>
<p>Her dad just happens to be WWE superstar Big Show (Paul Wight), all 7 feet and 400 pounds of him. He’s famous enough that he attracts crowds wherever he goes, and it’s kind of hard for him to disguise himself. He’s nervous about Lola fitting in and being a full-time parent to her; his wife Cassy (Allison Munn) assures him it’ll be OK, climbing on a stepladder to kiss his bald head.</p>
<p>Their kids have different reactions: 9-year-old J.J. (Juliet Donenfeld), who seems to be super-confident and prone to tiny crimes, is happy to get another big sister. Teenager Mandy (Lily Brooks O’Briant) doesn’t want to suffer from “Middle Child Syndrome.” “It’s real and it affects 1 in 3 children in 3-children households,” she laments. When Big Show tells her that she’s going to have to give up her room to Lola, she decides to stage a sit-in.</p>
<p>Lola’s first day in Tampa doesn’t go great; her dad makes a scene at the airport (he carries a security guard like a baby), then she finds out that there’s no girl’s ice hockey team, like there is in California. Big Show tries to get the P.E. teacher, Coach Fener (Ben Giroux) to let her on the boys’ team, but ends up hanging him on a hook when the coach calls him “Double Stuff” one too many times. Either way, Lola doesn’t want her dad fighting her battles.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mandy’s sit in has blown up on social media, and is attracting kids from all over Florida. When it gets to be too much, the three sisters hatch a plan that will get their parents to cave and get Lola her own room at the same time.</p>
<p>Our Take: Jason Berger and Josh Bycel (both from Happy Endings, among other shows) are the creators and showrunners of The Big Show Show, and their comedy pedigrees help make the show a tiny bit better than your average TGIF/Nick/Disney family sitcom. That doesn’t mean that it’s a good show, but it least it’s not terrible.</p>
<p>Let’s start with Big Show himself. The guy has performed in front of pro wrestling audiences for over 25 years, and it shows in how comfortable he is in front of a camera and audience. He’s not the most emotive guy, but he does get laughs out of his big-guy-as-teddy-bear persona and just his sheer size. His advantage is that he can do physical comedy fairly well, and he can always fall back on having fun play-wrestling J.J. or doing something like carrying a grown man in his arms.</p>
<p>The rest of the cast is a mixed bag. Munn is a veteran of multi-cams, going back to That ’70s Show, and has played the mom in the kid space before, on Nickelodeon’s Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn, so she knows the territory here. She’s given a few too many asides where she questions how crazy what she’s about to say is before she says it, but she handles the role like a pro. The kids are the usual mix of overly-verbal and super-precocious kids, whose purpose is to outsmart their supposedly clueless parents. Caster is just fine as Lola and O’Briant oversells all of Mandy’s lines; we’d enjoy J.J.’s mischievous character more if Donnenfeld didn’t have to spit out her lines so quickly.</p>
<p>But when it all comes together, it’s a perfectly fine show that you can sit and watch with your family, and you might even laugh once or twice. That’s more than what we can say about most family sitcoms.</p>
<p>What Age Group Is This For?: This is one of those shows that the whole family can watch, even the little ones from 6 on up. The word “sucks” goes out a few times, and Lola checks Big Show into the boards at a hockey tryout, but that stuff is still pretty mild.</p>
<p>Lola’s mom texts her to say that maybe Lola should live with her in Belgium, but Lola says that she’s fine, and sits with the family to enjoy burrito night.</p>
<p>Sleeper Star: None we can see. Jaleel White will show up at some point as a regular character, which should bring up the professionalism quotient by a bit.</p>
<p>Most Pilot-y Line: “What about RBG and ABC and all that feminist stuff?” Big Show asks Lola after she tells him that boys won’t check her if she tries out for the boys’ hockey team. “It’s AOC. ABC is what old people watch when they can’t find YouTube.” Oy. Then Cassy chimes in “That totally tracks; I’ve done that.” Big Show and Cassy are in their 40s, not their 80s, and YouTube has been around 15 years. Maybe “Hulu” would have been a better thing to put in that joke.</p>
<p>Our Call: STREAM IT. You might think that a family sitcom staring a massive wrestler wouldn’t work, but The Big Show Show works, for the most part. But “works” is relative here, as it has to clear a pretty low bar in its genre to be thought of as any good.</p>

<p><img src="https://nypdecider.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/the-big-show-show-on-netflix-cast-copy.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="img">
Where to Stream: The Big Show Show Powered by Reelgood</p>
<p>If you’re a fan of WWE Superstar The Big Show, you’ll absolutely want to push play on the big man’s new Netflix family comedy The Big Show Show.</p>
<p>Premiering on Netflix on Monday, April 6, the new sitcom follows Paul “Big Show” Wight as he battles his toughest opponent to date: his family! When his teenage daughter Lola (Reylynn Caster) comes to live with him and his wife (Allison Munn) and the couple’s two other daughters, the recently retired Big Show quickly becomes outnumbered as he tries to rein in the chaos.</p>
<p>To borrow a phrase from the Big Show’s legendary WWE theme song, “get ready for something that you’ve never known. You wont see it coming, but I promise you’ll know: It’s The Big Show (Show).”</p>
<p>Here’s everything you need to know about the cast of Netflix’s The Big Show Show.</p>
<p>HOW TALL IS THE BIG SHOW?</p>
<p>Paul “Big Show” Wight is reportedly a legitimate seven-footer with the WWE listing the giant as seven feet tall.</p>
<p>WHO PLAYS THE BIG SHOW’S WIFE?</p>
<p>Cassy is portrayed by actress Allison Munn.</p>
<p>WHERE HAVE I SEEN ALLISON MUNN BEFORE?</p>
<p>You may know Allison Munn as Cassy, but to me, the actress will always be Lauren Fletcher on One Tree Hill. If you’re not a fan of One Tree Hill (rude!), you might recognize Munn as Caroline Dupree from That ’70s Show, Tina Haven from What I Like About You, or as Anne Harper from the Nickelodeon comedy Nicky, Ricky, Dicky &amp; Dawn.</p>
<p>The actress has also appeared in Peter Kosminsky’s 2002 drama White Oleander, Cameron Crowe’s Elizabethtown, and Nickelodeon’s Sizzling Summer Camp Special.</p>
<p>Fun fact: Allison Munn used to be involved in roller derby. Munn (a.k.a. Kiss M’Grits) played for the L.A. Derby Dolls during the writers’ strike of 2008. If you’re a fan of Munn’s work, you can follow the actress on Instagram and/or binge all 187 episodes of One Tree Hill.</p>
<p>WHO’S IN THE BIG SHOW’S FAMILY? WHO PORTRAYS THE BIG SHOW’S KIDS?</p>
<p>Big Show’s daughters are portrayed by Reylynn Caster (Lola), Lily Brooks O’Briant (Mandy), and Juliet Donenfeld (J.J.).</p>
<p>Reylynn Caster (Lola):</p>
<p>Caster is best known as Brie Witherspoon on the ABC comedy American Housewife. Reylynn also played Nori Sterling on the CBS sitcom Me, Myself and I and is an accomplished theatrical performer, appearing in productions of Big River, The Music Man, Aladdin, Pippin, Sleeping Beauty, and Willie Wonka.</p>
<p>Lily Brooks O’Briant (Mandy):</p>
<p>O’Briant is best known for playing Carly Gray in the 2015 Dolph Lundren action film Shark Lake. You may also recognize the young actress as Young Dot from Amazon’s The Tick.</p>
<p>Juliet Donenfeld (J.J.):</p>
<p>Wanna feel old? Juliet Donenfeld already has 17 credits to her name! The pint-sized scene stealer is best known for playing Mike Ehrmantraut’s granddaughter Kaylee on Better Call Saul and Thalia in the Netflix film The Laundromat.</p>
<p>WHO PLAYS TAYLOR SWIFT ON THE BIG SHOW SHOW?</p>
<p>The man with the famous name is portrayed by actor Dallas Young (credited as Dallas Dupree Young).</p>
<p>WHERE HAVE I SEEN DALLAS YOUNG (OR DALLAS DUPREE YOUNG) BEFORE?</p>
<p>Young played Young Uzo on NBC’s The Good Place, Corey on the Freeform series The Fosters, and “Elementary Kid” in Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, this isn’t Young’s only wrestling-related comedy of the year. The burgeoning star will also appear in the upcoming Netflix film The Main Event.</p>
