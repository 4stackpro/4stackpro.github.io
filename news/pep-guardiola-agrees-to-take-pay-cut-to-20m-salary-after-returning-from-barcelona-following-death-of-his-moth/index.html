PEP GUARDIOLA is set to take a pay cut when he returns to Manchester City, according to reports.</p>
<p>The manager, 49, earns around £20million per year in his role at the Etihad.</p>

<p>3 Pep Guardiola is prepared to take a cut on his £20m-per-year salary amid the coronavirus crisis Credit: PA:Press Association</p>
<p>But according to The Times, Guardiola - who is currently in Barcelona - informally discussed the prospect of cutting his salary.</p>
<p>It is also reported that senior City executives including director of football Txiki Begiristain and Ferran Soriano, the chief executive, and some at their sister clubs within the City Football Group are also prepared to receive less pay to ensure all of the club&rsquo;s non-playing staff can be paid in full throughout the lockdown.</p>
<p>The players, too, are ready to see their wages shrunk over the coming months to help support both the workers at the Etihad as well as the NHS.</p>
<p>Vice-captain Kevin De Bruyne spoke with the league&rsquo;s captains on Saturday where it was agreed the players across the division wanted to play their part to support the country.</p>
<p>The suggestions were made as those within football try and help look at the ways they can reduce the financial impact of coronavirus on the sport and wider community.</p>

<p>Nothing official has been decided at Manchester City yet, with the club thought to be waiting to get a better idea of the significance of the financial damage from Covid-19.</p>
<p>One Manchester City executive told The Times: “This is our compromise with the club. We know that there will be sacrifices and we are committed to doing this [taking a pay cut].”</p>
<p>City were the first Premier League team to confirm they would not be putting workers on furlough.</p>
<p>Tottenham and Liverpool received heavy criticism for turning to the government scheme to cover staff wages before the Reds made a sudden U-turn on Monday.</p>
<p>The discussions between Guardiola and City&rsquo;s board had already taken place before the City boss tragically lost his mother on Monday.</p>
<p>Dolors Sala Carrio died in Barcelona aged 82 after contracting coronavirus.</p>
<p>Guardiola is in Barcelona with his family as they begin to grieve the devastating loss.</p>
<p>Dolors is one of more than 3,000 people in Catalonia to die of the virus with more than 13,000 across the country overall.</p>
<p>Just weeks ago, Pep donated £920,000 to fight the virus in his homeland, intending for the money to go to medical equipment through the Angel Soler Daniel Foundation.</p>

<h3 id="kevin-campbell-explains-how-arsenal-boss-mikel-arteta-can-emulate-pep-guardiola">Kevin Campbell explains how Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta can emulate Pep Guardiola</h3>

Arteta has had a good start to life in management at Arsenal (Picture: Getty Images)</p>
<p>Ex-Arsenal striker Kevin Campbell has explained how Mikel Arteta can reproduce Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola’s successful philosophy at the Emirates Stadium.</p>
<p>Arteta, 38, spent three years as Guardiola’s assistant coach at City, taking notes as they won back-to-back Premier League titles for the first time in the club’s history.</p>
<p>The Spaniard has clearly picked up some good habits from his former colleague, winning six and losing just two of his opening 13 games as Gunners manager.</p>
<p>However, the former Everton midfielder’s playing style in his first foray into management has been more pragmatic than free-flowing.</p>
<p>Ex-Arsenal striker Kevin Campbell admitted Arteta still has a lot of work to do to match his old mentor, telling the Chronicles of a Gooner podcast: ‘Everybody thinks Pep Guardiola’s system is attack, attack, attack.</p>
<p>‘Pep Guardiola’s system is work hard, graft and press the ball. Once you can do that you can play all the pretty football you like because you wear teams out.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>‘You have to, 1: Be extra fit, 2: Have the buy-in from the players in order to do it, and 3: This is probably the most important thing, you have to have the right players.’</p>

<p>‘Unfortunately, Mikel Arteta this season is our third manager, so it may take a bit longer because now I think we’ve got the right manager, but now we have to get the right players in.</p>
<p>‘I don’t think we’ve got the right players in our system to play the way Mikel Arteta wants.’</p>
<p>The Gunners have been notably more solid under Arteta compared to former boss Unai Emery, and remain the only side not to lose a Premier League game in 2020.</p>
<p>Campbell admitted the defence will be even stronger when 19-year-old William Saliba arrives from his season-long loan spell at Saint-Etienne next season.</p>
<p>He added: ‘At least we’ve got a centre half, big, strong, quick, centre half who is going to go straight into that side, he has to.</p>
<p>‘If we can get Saliba in and bed him in nicely then at least the defence is a lot younger and is a lot stronger.’</p>
