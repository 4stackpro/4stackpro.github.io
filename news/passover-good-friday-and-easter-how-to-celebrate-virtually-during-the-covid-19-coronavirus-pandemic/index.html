The week leading up to Easter Sunday is considered the Holy Week. This year, many will not be able to have traditional celebrations because of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Governors, city leaders across Ketuckiana, and the country have asked that all in-person religious services be postponed, until it&rsquo;s deemed safe to continue them. This means, celebrations and services will have to be done virtually or not at all.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to keep your faith and celebrate together at home as a family or individually from home:</p>
<p>Zoom, the tool many are now using for business meetings and school lessons, is one option. The company is allowing users to sign up and host video conferences for free, and is a fairly easy-to-use tool, even for the technologically-challenged. It&rsquo;s also a good option if you have a large group that normally gathers together for Passover, as it can hold probably more people than those dining room tables can.</p>
<p>FaceTime is another good option for iPhone and Mac users, especially if you typically have a more intimate Seder or will only have a few people calling in.</p>
<p>Google Hangouts also has a video chat tool that can connect up to 25 users together at one time, no matter what kind of phone or computer they&rsquo;re on. This option might be a bit more involved than Zoom technically, though, so this explainer sheet from Google is helpful.</p>
<p>Both Zoom and Google Hangouts offer multiple ways for users to join the video call, including the ability to just send participants meeting codes or links.</p>
<p>Facebook Live. If your church is doing a live via, make sure you have your notifications turned on. You&rsquo;ll get the alert when the pastor starts the live stream. Anyone hosting a live event should: Post notifications about it days in advance and start the live at least 5-10 minutes early. Let the stream be something scenic to give as many people as possible time to join before you actually begin the service.</p>
<p>House Party App which is good for large group chats. The greatest feature with this app is the ability for people to jump in and out of conversations. As long as you are friends with the host, users can enter and leave conversation no matter how many people are there.</p>
<p>Skype The Skype video chat app, group video calling for up to 50 people is available for free on just about any mobile device, tablet or computer.</p>
<p>What celebrations are part of Holy Week?</p>
<p>Passover</p>
<p>Passover 2020 starts at sundown on Wednesday, April 8th and ends at sundown on Thursday, April 16th. It&rsquo;s celebrated by the Jewish community locally and across the world.</p>
<p>What is Passover?</p>
<p>First of all, Passover in Hebrew is Pesach. Second of all, it&rsquo;s called Passover because the Angel of Death &ldquo;passed over&rdquo; the doorsteps of all the Jews in Egypt when the 10th plague, the killing of the first born, happened. So the angel passed over the homes, that&rsquo;s where we get Passover from. It&rsquo;s a celebration of the redemption by God from slavery in Egypt as we wandered into the desert to go to the promised land.</p>

<p>What is the significance of the holiday and how do you celebrate?</p>
<p>The service is called Seder which includes a Seder plate. There are six different places for six different items&ndash; so eggs, bitter herbs, lamb shank bone, charoset, which is a mixture of apples and honey and nuts, lettuce and then parsley or some kind of green to dip in salt water. The holiday lasts eight days, and Seders are often held on the first two nights. Each item on the Seder plate is representative of something having to do with the Passover story.</p>
<p>The Jewish Federation of Louisville have some resources to help you celebrate Passover virtually.</p>

<p>Maundy Thursday</p>
<p>Maundy Thursday, also called Holy Thursday or Sheer Thursday, the Thursday before Easter, observed in commemoration of Jesus Christ’s institution of the Eucharist during the Last Supper, according to Encyclopaedia Britannica online.</p>
<p>Good Friday</p>
<p>Good Friday occurs two days before Easter Sunday in the United States. It is the day when Christians commemorate Jesus Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion, which plays an important part in the Christian faith, according to the website Time and Date.</p>
<p>Getty Images/iStockphoto</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important day to Christianity, because it represents the sacrifices and suffering in Jesus&rsquo; life. Traditionally, some churches organize a prayer vigil on Good Friday for various causes, such as for cancer patients or for the American troops who have been sent to the middle-east. Some Christians may attend special church services or prayer vigils. The candles are often extinguished and statues, paintings and crosses may be draped in black, purple or gray cloth. Some Catholics treat Good Friday as a day of fasting, while others observe a partial fast involving the exclusion of meat.</p>
<p>Easter</p>
<p>Easter celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ on the third day after his crucifixion. Traditionally, many churches hold a service at sunrise on Easter Sunday. Some churches hold regularly scheduled Sunday services themed around the meaning of Easter.</p>
<p>Many church leaders have been honoring the call to stop in-person services and will have those services online, Facebook or on YouTube.</p>

<h3 id="good-friday-2020-date-check-out-significance-how-its-celebrated-messages">Good Friday 2020 Date: Check out significance, how it&rsquo;s celebrated, messages</h3>
<p><img src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/btmt/images/stories/goodfriday_505_090420125939.jpg" alt="img">
Good Friday is the most important festival for the Christian community across the world. This day marks Jesus Christ&rsquo;s demise at the cavalry and his crucifixion. Good Friday is observed during the auspicious week as part of the Paschal Triduum on the Friday before the Easter Sunday.</p>
<p>This date varies from one year to another, according to Gregorian calendar. This year, Good Friday will be observed on April 10 while Easter Sunday falls on April 12. Essence of Good Friday lies in the victory of good over evil.</p>
<p>Christians who are Anglican, Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, Methodist, Oriental Orthodox and Reformed Traditions celebrate Good Friday by observing fast and attending church service. Most countries including India mark this day as a public holiday.</p>
<p>Germany bars celebratory acts like dancing, horse racing, etc and instead focuses on remembering the Lord with a somber mood. In German speaking countries, Good Friday is known as Karfreiatag which means Mourning Friday. Nordic nations call this day as The Long Friday whereas in Greek, Polish and Hungarian regions, it is known as Great Friday.</p>
<p>History and significance</p>
<p>The term Good Friday is not quoted in the Holy Bible but religious texts do tell us how Judas&rsquo; betrayal led to Christ&rsquo;s arrest. Christians remember the sacrifices of Jesus on this day and the priest and visitors to the Church wear black to mark the day. Many don&rsquo;t light candles on this day and refuse to eat meat.

<h3 id="big-supermarkets-will-close-on-easter-sunday-despite-coronavirus-pandemic">Big supermarkets will close on Easter Sunday despite coronavirus pandemic</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/09/10/26995454-0-image-a-4_1586426057587.jpg" alt="img">
Supermarket shoppers will face even longer queues on Saturday as government rules mean larger stores cannot open on Easter Sunday.</p>
<p>Rules passed down by the Department for Business say no shop larger than 280sq metres can open on Easter Sunday or Christmas Day.</p>
<p>Despite Britain being in a state of lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, a DfB spokesman said &lsquo;existing rules still apply&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Shoppers keep their distance from one another outside a Sainsbury&rsquo;s in Durham on Wednesday, as the spread of coronavirus continues. Queues could be even longer on Saturday as stores prepare to close for Easter Sunday</p>
<p>Most supermarkets now have two metre lines to keep customers apart. Shoppers heading into the west London Sainsbury&rsquo;s were closer together during a long queue on March 20</p>
<p>Which shops have to close on Easter Sunday? The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy have clear guidelines on which stores can and can&rsquo;t open on Easter Sunday. Any shop over 280sq metres must stay shut for the full day. There are exemptions, these are the ones listed on gov.uk: Airport and railway station outlets</p>
<p>Service station outlets</p>
<p>Registered pharmacies selling only medicinal products and medical and surgical appliances</p>
<p>Farms selling mainly their own produce</p>
<p>Outlets wholly or mainly selling motor or bicycle supplies and accessories</p>
<p>Suppliers of goods to aircraft or sea-going vessels on arrival at, or departure from, a port, harbour or airport</p>
<p>Exhibition stands selling goods</p>
<p>&lsquo;Most of our shops in England, Wales and the Channel Islands will be closed on Easter Sunday, and open for shorter hours on Good Friday and Easter Monday,&rsquo; Bérangère Michel, executive director of customer service at Waitrose wrote to customers, according to The Times.</p>
<p>He added &lsquo;We are continuing to limit the number of customers in our shops, and introducing further measures to ensure everyone keeps a safe distance once inside. Unfortunately, that will sometimes mean queues, but these do move quickly and many of our stores are quieter after 6pm.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Larger stores, including supermarkets, normally open on reduced hours on most Sundays, but twice a year they must close. On Easter Sunday and Christmas Day.</p>
<p>The rules do not apply in Scotland, however.</p>
<p>A Sainsbury&rsquo;s spokeswoman said: &lsquo;As with previous years, the vast majority of our supermarkets will be open from 8am to 8pm on Good Friday and some of our Sainsbury’s local stores will be open on Easter Sunday.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some of our supermarket opening hours will also vary, so it’s best to check our store locator for details.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Morrisons, which normally pulls in around 11million customers each week, did not offer a formal comment when approached by the MailOnline.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman replied to our request for comment by saying: &lsquo;We would expect people to shop how they normally do around Easter time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Asda said its stores would be open over the Bank Holiday Friday and Monday, but shut on Easter Sunday.</p>
<p>Britain&rsquo;s lockdown and social distancing guidelines mean there have already been long queues stretching around supermarkets as people head out for their weekly shops.</p>
<p>With Sunday&rsquo;s closure looming, shoppers are now being warned to get their shopping done ahead of time.</p>
<p>Shoppers are told to &lsquo;keep a safe distance&rsquo; by signs at a Tesco in London on Wednesday, but queues could start to build in the coming days</p>
<p>Before the social distancing rules were put in place, there were still long queues to get into Britain&rsquo;s supermarkets. Shoppers in south London are pictured heading into a Sainsbury&rsquo;s on March 22 to stockpile</p>
<p>A senior industry figure told The Times: &lsquo;Some of the bigger retailers are concerned about greater queues but few are clamouring to open. Most believe that they wouldn&rsquo;t get a whole lot more sales — maybe they would pick up a bit extra from convenience stores — but it would just mean a lower average sale for the rest of the week.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Shopping for essentials is one of the few reasons Brits are allowed to leave their home, aside from exercise, travelling to work where necessary and picking up medication.</p>
<p>Supermarkets struggled to cope with demand since Britain was locked down more than two weeks ago, many of their delivery websites crashed under the sudden influx of bookings, while caps had to be placed on certain products.</p>
<p>Yesterday Sainsbury&rsquo;s revealed it was lifting its three-item cap on thousands of products, but a two-product limit on essentials was kept in place.
