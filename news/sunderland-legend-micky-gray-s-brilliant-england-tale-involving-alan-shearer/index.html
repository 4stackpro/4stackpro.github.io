<p>Former Sunderland defender Micky Gray has been reminiscing about making his England debut under Kevin Keegan.</p>
<p>Gray was an ever-present at left-back during the Peter Reid era and was rewarded at the end of the Black Cats&rsquo; promotion winning 1998/99 season with an England call-up.</p>
<p>With 17 minutes remaining, Kevin Keegan handed Gray his first cap in a 1-1 friendly draw with Hungary in Budapest and he almost set up Alan Shearer for a winning goal.</p>
<p>However, the Newcastle United legend spurned the opportunity and Gray has joked the former England great missed on purpose due to his Sunderland connections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you are a young lad that is your dream when you are kicking the football around in your street and against your garage,&rdquo; he told Sky Sports presenter - and Sunderland executive director - David Jones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You obviously want to start playing professional football first and foremost and making your debut for whoever it is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a local lad and making my debut for Sunderland, you couldn&rsquo;t get any better than that in my eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I think the special thing about making my debut for England and picking up my first cap was that we were still playing in the Championship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had obviously just got promotion to the Premier League but it wasn&rsquo;t just me. It was Kevin Phillips who started the game against Hungary. I came on for the last 17 minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had Allan Johnston who made his debut for Scotland. Thomas Sorensen who made his debut for Denmark. There were so many young lads who were unheard of and trying to make a name for themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But for me, it has to be top of the tree. To pull on that shirt is so special.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t feel out of place. It was the same when I was 16/17 and training with the first team at Sunderland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All these stars who I had watched every single week. Alan Shearer, Michael Owen, Jamie Redknapp, David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Tony Adams, Sol Campbell, Teddy Sheringham, I could go through all of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had watched them on TV and not been anywhere near them. I thought the only thing I could do is show them how good I am in training and when we get to the match, show them how good I was then as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I loved every single minute of it. I know it was only 17 minutes. I remember with two or three minutes of the game remaining, I ran up the left-hand side and put probably one of the best crosses in of my career.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was on the end of it? Alan Shearer. But what did he do? He missed it, didn&rsquo;t he? I think he did it on purpose!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was an incredible time.&rdquo;

We’ll have the latest on those talks throughout the day, with a conclusion not expected to be reached until Friday.</p>
<p>Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.</p>
<p>We’ll also have the latest developments from the Stadium of Light over on our live blog throughout the day. The club remains up for sale and Charlie Methven suggested earlier this week a deal could be done by the summer.

<h3 id="sunderland-till-i-die-season-2-is-another-tragicomic-slice-of-football-life">&lsquo;Sunderland Till I Die&rsquo; Season 2 is another tragicomic slice of football life</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.esquireme.com/s3/files/styles/fb_share_style_image/public/images/2020/04/02/stid1-1585743015.jpg?itok=WkkK3JOA" alt="img">
The first season of Sunderland &lsquo;Til I Die was a tragicomic odyssey into a Premier League club&rsquo;s equivalent of The Upside Down. Instead of bouncing straight back to the top table, Sunderland were relegated again from the Championship to League One.</p>
<p>Out went wantaway owner Ellis Short and chief exec Martin Bain; in came new brooms Stewart Donald and Charlie Methven. The cameras hung around to see what happened. As you might know, things didn&rsquo;t get any less tragicomic last season.</p>
<p>Key voices from the first season are still around. Peter, the taxi driver who&rsquo;s been coming to Sunderland games since 1963, is still there, as is Joyce, the club&rsquo;s head cook. Club captain George Honeyman continues to be an adorable sunbeam. Methven is the standout character in this new series, though.</p>
<p>Everything about him smells a bit off. He says &ldquo;season cards&rdquo; rather than season tickets. He pushes his hair back so it looks like it&rsquo;s got Cadillac-style fins. In the first episode he attempts a Glengarry Glen Ross-style foul-mouthed rant at staff to impress upon them how f**ked everything is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On an operational basis, this business was losing, and planning to lose, 30 to 40 million [pounds] a year,&rdquo; he says. A pause for dramatic effect. &ldquo;It is a failed&rdquo; – he draws a big line through some figures on his whiteboard – &ldquo;f<strong>ked-up business, and unless you guys understand that, you&rsquo;ll never f</strong>king make it in this world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looks around. &ldquo;This. Was. F<strong>ked.&rdquo; He smiles. &ldquo;Hundred per cent f</strong>ked.&rdquo; Nobody seems to know how much the club was paying in interest the previous season. &ldquo;It was in my presentation to all staff,&rdquo; says Methven, clicking his pen irritably.</p>
<p>Sunderland went almost a full calendar year without winning at the Stadium of Light, and Methven wants to turn it into a fortress. For some reason, his weapon of choice is trance. Sergei Prokofiev&rsquo;s Dance of the Knights has been Sunderland&rsquo;s walk-out music at the start of games since the Stadium of Light opened, but Methven has some thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My personal instinct is: new start, fresh beginnings, new sound,&rdquo; he says, tapping on his laptop. &ldquo;This is how I&rsquo;d do it if I was DJ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tiesto&rsquo;s &lsquo;Adagio For Strings&rsquo; bangs tinnily into the meeting room. Looks are exchanged. Later, while trying out the PA system with matchday announcer Frankie Francis, he tries to get across what he wants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know those massive raves?&rdquo; Methven says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a nightclub?&rdquo; says Francis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; says Methven, &ldquo;or at least a very large-scale one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Methven is eerily smooth, Donald seems to carry the weight of Wearside on his shoulders. He literally crumples during the January transfer negotiations for Will Grigg, eventually forking out a whopping £3 million – a little over Methven&rsquo;s £1.25 million valuation – to try to replace striker Josh Maja. You feel sorry for him.</p>
<p>If the first season of Sunderland &lsquo;Til I Die was about pride and place, and the crumbling but abiding love between the city and its club, the second is about money. Sunderland&rsquo;s wage bill is £34 million. In League One. £34 million. League One. The majority of the playing staff leave. In come off-cuts, youngsters and low-price punts.</p>
<p>The two seasons of Sunderland &lsquo;Til I Die feel like they&rsquo;ve come from completely different eras in footballing history. The first saw a tightening of belts and some essential pruning. Since then, we&rsquo;ve seen Bury expelled from the Football League after collapsing financially, and a former director chain herself to a drainpipe at the ground in protest. We saw Bolton Wanderers pad out their squad with youth players after an exodus left them with six senior professionals. Southend United have just been served a winding up order. Other clubs like Macclesfield Town, Oldham Athletic and Coventry City have struggled to keep their heads above water too.</p>
<p>This is the company Sunderland keep now. They&rsquo;re not a yo-yo club plotting a return to stability; they&rsquo;re a business sprinting toward a cliff edge. More clubs will collapse. The season starts and ends with games against Charlton Athletic – the second a play-off final at Wembley – though with strikingly different endings. The value of that final isn&rsquo;t just monetary, it&rsquo;s existential. The shock and pain is even more visceral than it was in the first season.</p>
<p>While many of the football club documentaries which followed Sunderland &lsquo;Til I Die were little more than very well produced exercises in myth-building, none can touch this one for capturing the everyday suffering fans endure.</p>
<p>Watch Sunderland &lsquo;Til I Die on Netflix.
