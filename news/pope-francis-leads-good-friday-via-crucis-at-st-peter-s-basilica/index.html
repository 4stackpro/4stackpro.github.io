On Good Friday, Pope Francis presides at the Way of the Cross, which this year takes place in Piazza San Pietro.</p>
<p>By Vatican News</p>
<p>Pope Francis led the traditional Via Crucis in a near-empty Saint Peter’s Square on the evening of Good Friday.</p>
<p>A stark contrast</p>
<p>It marked a stark departure from the usual ceremony, which normally takes place at the Colosseum amid throngs of people as the Church remembers the final moments of the Passion, Death, and Burial of our Lord Jesus Christ. This year, measures taken to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus, Covid-19, made it necessary to hold the service without the physical presence of the faithful.</p>
<p>Meditations from Prison</p>
<p>For 2020, the meditations for the fourteen “Stations” along the Way of the Cross were prepared by the chaplaincy of the Due Palazzi House of Detention in the northern Italian city of Padua. Five prisoners, the family of a murder victim, the daughter of a man given a life sentence, the mother of another prisoner, a guard, and a priest who was convicted of a crime but eventually exonerated, were among those contributing their reflections on the Passion of the Lord, and how it bears on their own situations.</p>
<p>A path through the darkness</p>
<p>With the path marked out by burning torches on the ground, the black Cross was carried around the obelisk at the centre of the Square, before coming to the door of the Basilica. The Cross was escorted by members of the Due Palazzi chaplaincy, and by members of the Health and Hygiene Directorate of the Vatican City State.</p>
<p>The papal blessing</p>
<p>Arriving at the sagrada, or porch before the façade, the Cross was given to Pope Francis for the fourteenth and final Station.</p>
<p>Finally, at the conclusion of the ceremony, the Holy Father gave his papal blessing to all those following the Via Crucis, wherever they might be throughout the world.

CHICAGO (WLS) &ndash; The faithful in Chicago, the state, and around the world are being asked by their leaders to worship differently this Easter weekend to save lives. And it was readily apparent in the Pilsen neighborhood.Fewer than 10 people formed the procession for the 43rd annual Via Crucis in Pilsen.All of them, except the actor portraying Jesus for the stations of the cross, wore face masks and social distanced. The streets were nearly empty this Good Friday because of COVID-19.Normally, they are filled with 5,000 to 8,000 spectators.Cardinal Blase Cupich, interdenominational faith leaders and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot recognized the stations of the cross and the severity of the threat this global health crisis poses. They&rsquo;re calling on the devout to observe Easter weekend from home.&ldquo;We have to take responsibility for our actions and make sure we keep each other safe,&rdquo; said Cardinal Blaise Cupich.Mayor Lori Lightfoot echoed that call at a Good Friday news conference.&ldquo;I implore all Chicagoans and faith leaders to&hellip;celebrate separately,&rdquo; she said.And on the South Side, aldermen came together in their own personal protective equipment to implore Chicagoans in their communities to stay home from any in-person Easter celebrations.&ldquo;If we do this now, we can celebrate many birthdays and Easters and Christmases to come,&rdquo; said 21st Ward Alderman Howard Brookins.The clear message: to stop as many new COVID-19 infections as possible.

<h3 id="at-via-crucis-pope-francis-prays-for-those-serving-the-suffering">At Via Crucis, Pope Francis Prays for Those Serving the Suffering</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.ncregister.com/images/editorial/Pope_WayofCross_041020.jpg" alt="img">
Pope Francis during Via Crucis on Good Friday, April 10, 2020. (Vatican Media.)</p>
<p>At Via Crucis, Pope Francis Prays for Those Serving the Suffering</p>
<p>With Italy under lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, this was the first time in decades that the Via Crucis was not held at the Colosseum, a Roman amphitheater associated with the Christian martyrs.</p>
<p>Catholic News Agency</p>
<p>VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis prayed for those who are serving the suffering as he presided at the Stations of the Cross in a deserted St. Peter’s Square on Good Friday evening.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the Stations, the pope prayed: “O God, eternal light and day without sunset, fill with your goods those who devote themselves to your praise and the service of those who suffer, in the countless places of humanity’s sorrow. Through Christ our Lord. Amen.”</p>
<p>The official booklet for the ceremony suggested the pope would then offer a short reflection, but instead he simply imparted his apostolic blessing.</p>
<p>With Italy under lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, this was the first time in decades that the Via Crucis was not held at the Colosseum, a Roman amphitheater associated with the Christian martyrs.</p>
<p>The pope had asked the chaplaincy at the “Due Palazzi” House of Detention in Padua, northern Italy, to prepare the meditations for this year’s Stations of the Cross. Contributors included parents whose daughter was murdered, the child of a man sentenced to life imprisonment, a magistrate, a prisoner’s mother, a corrections officer and a priest acquitted after eight years in the justice system.</p>
<p>The reflections, which were written in the first person but did not identify their authors by name, were read out as the small group carrying the cross processed around the Egyptian obelisk at the center of St. Peter’s Square, which was lit by lines of small fires.</p>
<p>Among those who carried the cross were two medical professionals helping to lead the fight against COVID-19 in Rome. Esmeralda Capristo, an internist, and Paolo Maurizio Soave, an anesthesiologist, are treating coronavirus patients at the Gemelli University Hospital and the Columbus Covid 2 Hospital.</p>
<p>After the first eight stations, the group bearing the cross moved to a fan-shaped area in front of St. Peter’s Basilica. The 12th Station, “Jesus dies on the cross”, took place before the Crucifix of San Marcello, which is credited with liberating Rome from plague in 1522.</p>
<p>The crucifix was displayed on March 27, when the pope gave his Urbi et Orbi blessing amid a torrential downpour, as well as on Palm Sunday and at the Solemn Celebration of the Lord’s Passion.</p>
<p>At this evening’s ceremony the miraculous crucifix stood facing Pope Francis, who led the Stations from a platform beneath the facade of St. Peter’s.</p>
<p>The introduction to the meditations, which were compiled by chaplain Fr Marco Pozza and journalist Tatiana Mario, said: “Accompanying Christ on the Way of the Cross, with the raw voices of those who live behind the walls of a prison, is an opportunity to view the great battle between life and death, to discover how the threads of good and evil inevitably intertwine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It continued: “Contemplating Calvary from behind bars is to believe that an entire life can be played out in a few moments, as happened to the good thief.”</p>
<p>The Holy See Press office released a message Friday from Pope Francis thanking members of the parish of &ldquo;Due Palazzi&rdquo; for composing the meditations.</p>
<p>“Thank you for sharing a piece of your story with me,” the pope wrote. “God tells of Himself and speaks to us within a story. He invites us to listen attentively and mercifully. I want to thank you also because you have scattered your names not in the sea of anonymity, but of the many people linked to the prison world.”</p>
<p>“Thus, in the Way of the Cross, you will lend your story to all those in the world who share the same situation.”
