KUALA LUMPUR: Since the movement control order (MCO) came into force about three weeks ago, one of the main concerns, particularly among men, was their inability to get a hair cut.</p>
<p>With the Prime Minister announcing an extension of the MCO to last until April 28, many are restless thinking about their locks and how long it already is.</p>
<p>But there is light at the end of the tunnel, as Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, in announcing the MCO&rsquo;s extension, also announced that several sectors of businesses would be allowed to operate, under strict guidelines.</p>
<p>Among the sectors are haircut services and laundry services.</p>
<p>In a statement by the International Trade and Industry Ministry (MITI), it said these additional sectors are allowed to operate in a bid to protect the country&rsquo;s economy as Malaysia and the world battle the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>However these additional businesses are required to apply for permission to operate with MITI beginning April 13 from 9am.</p>
<p>Applications can be made via MITI&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.miti.gov.my">www.miti.gov.my</a>.</p>
<p>For hair related businesses, only hair cut services are allowed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, for laundry, only full laundry services are allowed to operate. Self-service laundromats are to remain close for the duration of the MCO.

PUTRAJAYA: The International Trade and Industry Ministry (Miti) will be looking into the views of the people on the move to allow hair salons to start operating during the third phase of Movement Control Order (MCO) starting on April 15.</p>
<p>Senior Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said all views of the people on the matter would be considered.</p>
<p>“It is true, there are various opinions on social media such as WhatsApp discussing the matter.</p>
<p>“I believe and was informed that Miti would be studying all views,” said Ismail Sabri, who is also Defence Minister, at a media conference after a special ministers’ meeting on the implementation of MCO at Perdana Putra here today.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin when announcing the extension of MCO phase two yesterday said several sectors would be allowed to operate after this.</p>
<p>Following the Prime Minister’s announcement, Miti issued a list of service sectors allowed to operate among them hair salons and optical shops.</p>
<p>There was a hot discussion on social media over the announcement as some members of the public were concerned over the possibility of creating new Covid-19 infection clusters in Malaysia at barber shops.</p>
<p>Consumers also shared news on social media that a barber in the United States died after being infected with Covid-19.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Fukuoka Japan, there were reports that some cases of Covid-19 clusters in the province originated from hair salons. - Bernama

<h3 id="green-light-for-some-sectors">Green light for some sectors</h3>
<p><img src="https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/04/11/640008.jpg" alt="img">
PETALING JAYA: The Federal Government will allow some industries to operate during the extended movement control order (MCO), but the health and safety of the workers remain a top priority, says Senior Minister Datuk Seri Azmin Ali (pic). He said these industries, which include non-essential and professional services, must apply online from 9am on Monday (April 13) on the International Trade and Industry Ministry’s (Miti) website <a href="http://www.miti.gov.my">www.miti.gov.my</a> for permission to operate during the MCO period.</p>
<p>The MCO was extended yesterday for the second time to April 28, as announced by Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin, in a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19, which has severely impacted economic activities.</p>
<p>The list from Miti includes industries such as automotive, machinery and equipment, aerospace, construction projects, social health services including traditional and complementary medicine practitioners, hardware and electrical shops, opticians as well as full-service laundrettes and hair salons/barber shops (haircuts only).</p>
<p>Azmin, who is also International Trade and Industry Minister, warned that permission given to these industries will be revoked immediately if the business did not comply with the stated standard operating procedures.</p>
<p>“The decision was made after we realised the need to open up more economic sectors as the Covid-19 pandemic is not only affecting the health of the people but is also affecting the economy, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs).</p>
<p>“We found that the level of compliance from the government’s decision to allow several critical manufacturing and services sectors to operate during the first phase of the MCO had been good.</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, the government continues to monitor the compliance of the conditions as stipulated by the Health Ministry and also to ensure that health screening and preventive measures are implemented for the safety of employees and customers.</p>
<p>“This step is necessary to ensure the sustainability of the country’s economy post-Covid-19, to prevent the loss of jobs among Malaysians and to ensure that the rakyat continue to have access to basic needs and critical products throughout the MCO period, ” he said.Azmin is also co-chair of a Special Cabinet Committee to Mitigate the Impact of Covid-19 on the Economy and Labour Market, which later made proposals to the Cabinet.</p>
<p>He said among the considerations the Cabinet took into account before deciding on which industries could operate were the stability of export activities, survival of SMEs, and the size of the workforce.</p>
<p>Muhyiddin stressed that the decision was not a case of easing the MCO, but one where the approved businesses must follow strict procedures.</p>
<p>“I must emphasise that while we allow some sectors to re-open, this does not mean that we are relaxing the MCO. The order is still being enforced and orders issued by authorities must be followed, ” he said.On another matter, he said there was a possibility that schools would remain closed for a while until the authorities were convinced that the Covid-19 situation was completely under control.</p>
<p>The Education Ministry has been asked to implement home-based learning initiatives to be implemented during the MCO period and possibly until school re-opens, the Prime Minister added.</p>
<p>“I have read comments from parents on Facebook and many want the school closure to be extended. Parents are worried about their children’s safety.</p>
<p>“I, too, have school-going grandchildren and like you, I worry for them. Who doesn’t love their children, more so grandchildren?” he said.</p>
<p>Muhyiddin has also directed the authorities to enhance surveillance and checks along the country’s borders to prevent illegal entries.</p>
<p>“Along our borders there are many illegal routes that can be used to enter the country.</p>
<p>“If we don’t beef up the control and surveillance along our borders, illegal immigrants can bring Covid-19 into the country.</p>
<p>“That is why I have ordered the authorities to ensure there are stricter border controls, ” he added.</p>
<p>Muhyiddin also expressed his gratitude to all frontliners, including medical workers, police, army, enforcement personnel and delivery personnel, on duty during the MCO period, describing them as “great people”.</p>
