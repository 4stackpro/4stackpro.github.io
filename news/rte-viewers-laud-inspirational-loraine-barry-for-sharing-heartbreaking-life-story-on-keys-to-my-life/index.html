Those who tuned in to watch the latest episode of RTE’s Keys To My Life were left feeling emotional after hearing Dancing With The Stars head judge Loraine Barry’s life story.</p>
<p>The new show on RTE has proved incredibly popular with viewers so far as they hear more about the lives of some of the famous faces from the telly.</p>
<p>This week, Loraine Barry took host Brendan Courtney to visit the houses that she called ‘home’ throughout what was a turbulent life.</p>
<p>The DWTS judge shared the highs and lows of her life as the pair first visited her childhood home in Cabra in North Dublin.</p>
<p>Loraine spoke about her first marriage to professional ballroom partner Andrew Sinkinson.</p>
<p>Loraine revealed that she ended the marriage after she answered a call on his phone from another woman.</p>
<p>Despite their split, Loraine was forced to keep dancing professionally with Sinkinson for over a year and a half before the pair could fully part ways.</p>
<p>From there, Loraine and Brendan travelled to Italy to visit the house she built with her second husband, Luca Baricchi.</p>
<p>The pair fell in love after becoming dance partners and moved to Italy to build a home, start a family, and open their own dance studio.</p>

<p>Loraine soon fell pregnant but tragically suffered a miscarriage.</p>
<p>The ballroom dancer revealed it wasn’t long after when her friends told her that her husband Luca had been having an affair.</p>
<p>‘My friends told me he was having an affair, he denied it. And she was my student,’ she said.</p>
<p>Loraine left Italy and moved back to London which is where her luck finally began to change.</p>

<p>Dancing With The Stars judge Loraine Barry has told of the breakdown of her two marriages and how she found out she had miscarried on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>The professional dancer was previously married twice, to Andrew Sinkinson and Luca Baricchi.</p>
<p>She said it was a “horrendous, hideous time” when Luca left her and she found out he had been in a serious accident and the woman he was</p>
<p>travelling with had died.</p>
<p>Loraine added: “I was delighted [to discover I was pregnant] and Luca was very happy but, sadly, I had a miscarriage on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>(Image: Kyran O&rsquo;Brien)</p>
<p>“We went to Dublin for Christmas and we were going to 6pm mass but I had pains in my stomach, terrible cramps.</p>
<p>“My mother said to stay at home and everyone else went to mass. We ended up in the Rotunda Hospital, it was just coming up to three months.</p>
<p>“He was coming up to 40 and I felt like he was having this crisis. He said ‘I need to leave’.</p>
<p>“My friends told me he was having an affair, he denied it. And she was my student.</p>
<p>“I got a message when I was flying on a Monday morning to say he had had an accident on a motorbike… with the girl on the back of the bike.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, she passed away and she was 30 years of age.</p>
<p>“I was in shock and everything was black. It was a horrendous, hideous time.”</p>
<p>Speaking on RTE One’s Keys To My Life, Loraine also opened about her partnership with Andrew Sinkinson that began on the dancefloor and led to them tying the knot.</p>
<p>Their relationship officially ended in 1994 after she answered a call on his phone from another woman.</p>
<p>But they remained together professionally for 18 months until Loraine was asked not to return to a dance studio by a teacher.</p>
<p>She said: “It is sad the way it ended. I can remember being in this bedroom and getting out of the bed at 4am and leaving with the car keys and driving because he got a phone call during the night and I couldn’t cope with it.</p>
<p>“Another woman, yeah. Definitely. I answered it, of course, and this was really the breaking point between us.</p>
<p>“For me, it was like everything was falling down around me and everyone wanted us to continue dancing together so I was prepared to try but it just became too difficult. I just couldn’t do it.</p>
<p>“There were times of craziness.”</p>
<p>Loraine, from Cabra in Dublin, added it was very difficult to remain dance partners after breaking up – and it was made even harder by their teachers.</p>
<p>She said: “Certain teachers didn’t want me to split up with Andrew and they wanted me to dance with him. In the end they asked me not to come back to the studio.</p>
<p>“They put so much into us as professionals and they were trying to save the partnership but I was trying to save myself.</p>
<p>“There was a fear of being a failure. Even letting your parents down because they have worked so hard to support you.”</p>
<p>Keys To My Life is on RTE One tonight at 8.30pm.

<h3 id="proud-london-bus-driver-begs-government-to-think-of-her-family">‘Proud’ London bus driver begs Government to think of her family</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.barryanddistrictnews.co.uk/resources/images/11255451/" alt="img">
A London bus driver said she was “proud to do her job” but “frightened to die” as she begged the Government to do more to help protect transport staff.</p>
<p>Lorraine, whose route covers areas of south London, said she had been up all morning writing letters to relatives, including her parents in Jamaica, as she feared she “would not have the opportunity to say goodbye to the ones that I love” if she contracted the virus.</p>
<p>“I’ve got up this morning to the news that we’ve just lost 20 bus drivers to this Covid-19,” she said in a video posted online.</p>
<p>“I want my children and my family to have the letters that I have written because I am put at risk by TfL and Khan by not providing a safe environment for me to work in.</p>
<p>“I am proud to drive a London bus, I’m proud to do my job, I’m proud to get front line services to their place of work to help people. That’s why I’m still driving.</p>
<p>Lorraine, a 62-year-old London bus driver (Tom Kearney/PA)</p>
<p>“But I’m frightened. I’m frightened that I’m going to die, because nobody in government – [Sadiq] Khan TfL will not listen to us.”</p>
<p>A total of 14 London transport workers have now died after contracting the virus, nine of them bus workers, according to the The Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT).</p>
<p>The 62-year-old added that more needed to be done about those “roaming the streets”.</p>
<p>“I’ve had people day after after day get on my bus for no reason, putting me at risk,” she said. “It’s not fair – my life matters, if it doesn’t matter to anybody else it matters to my family.</p>
<p>“I just need someone to take notice and protect us while we provide the service and put our lives before profit. Khan, TfL, I beg you, think of me and my family.”
