“Humanity will rise again,” that was South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s message in his Easter address as he called for concerted efforts in his country’s fight against COVID-19.</p>
<p>The president acknowledged the challenges that have been brought by the disease, but is confident measures put in place by his administration will help tackle it.</p>
<p>President Ramphosa called upon South Africans to make donations to a solidarity fund which he announced earlier this week, in order to help less fortunate citizens cope with the tough times.</p>
<p>“We have to expend our every effort and energy to ensure that this period of hardship does not leave our economy in ruins. We have to give support to those who need our help in any way we can. I call upon each of you to make a donation, no matter how small, to the Solidarity Fund that was established to combat the coronavirus pandemic,” the president said.</p>
<p>South Africa is one of 52 African countries that have reported cases of COVID-19. The country is the worst affected in the continent, with close to 2,000 confirmed cases and 18 deaths. 95 patients successfully recovered.</p>
<p>“This is a time of great trial for our country. We will at times find ourselves and our very faith sorely tested. Yet we know that the harshest of tests pushes us to persevere and to prevail. Working together, side by side, we will weather this storm and we shall overcome,” President Ramaphosa said.</p>
<p>In total, Africa has reported close to 11,000 COVID-19 cases, with over 500 deaths. Over 1,000 people have recovered.

<h3 id="bring-back-beer-calls-for-ramaphosa-to-reconsider-alcohol-ban">Bring back beer: Calls for Ramaphosa to reconsider alcohol ban</h3>
<p><img src="https://gcs.thesouthafrican.com/2020/04/38fb4ef7-alcohol-associations-call-for-the-sale-of-beer-during-lockdown.jpg" alt="img">
The Beer Association of South Africa (Basa), as well as other alcohol associations, have made submissions to President Cyril Ramaphosa to allow off-consumption outlets to sell beer.</p>
<p>According to SABC News, Basa CEO Patricia Pillay, says they are still supporting the government’s efforts to protect South Africans against the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Strict alcohol regulations result in job losses</p>
<p>Pillay said although they support government’s protective measures to curb the spread of the virus, it is also important to note that strict liquor regulations have resulted in many outlets shutting their doors — with several people being retrenched.</p>
<p>Pillay said businesses and depots have also been looted and social media has been flooded with incidents of homemade concoctions being sold out of pure desperation.</p>
<p>Submissions made to the president suggest the sale of beer be allowed with certain restrictions regarding good hygiene practices, social distancing, specific trading hours and restrictions on volumes that are sold.</p>
<p>We’ll keep you updated on what the president thinks of this. Even more so, Police Minister Bheki Cele, who has been on high alert about the sale of alcohol and cigarettes during the lockdown.</p>
<p>South Africans turn to home brewing of beer</p>
<p>Since Cele announced that there would be no alcohol during the nationwide lockdown, South Africans have become restless, to say the least.</p>
<p>Liquor stores, pubs, clubs and taverns have all been closed. On top of that horrific news, President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday 9 April, announced an extension of a further two weeks.</p>
<p>It was at that point that all hell broke loose. South Africans took to home brewing their own alcohol and for Cele, it was a “challenge accepted” moment.</p>
<p>Intensified law enforcement operations in the Eastern Cape saw police descend on homesteads at the start of the long Easter weekend. Freshly-brewed umqombothi was dumped and even meat was thrown out on the floor.</p>
<p>Reasons for the alcohol ban during lockdown</p>
<p>According to government and Cele himself, these are the reasons as to why alcohol should not be sold during a lockdown:

<h3 id="president-ramaphosa-leads-strong-response-to-covid-19-in-south-africa">President Ramaphosa Leads Strong Response to COVID-19 in South Africa</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cfr.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_width_xl/public/image/2020/04/South-Africa-Coronavirus-Ramaphosa-Military.jpg?h=9c000e02" alt="img">
On March 27, President Cyril Ramaphosa and Health Minister Zweli Mkhize imposed on South Africa one of the strictest lockdowns outside of China to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Among the prohibited activities: dog-walking, jogging, the sale of alcohol, and leaving a place of residence (except for emergencies). At the time restrictions were put in place, South Africa had around 1,000 cases and had just recorded its first deaths.</p>
<p>Though many at first did not heed the lockdown orders, the new rules have since been stringently enforced by the army and police. As in Kenya, there have been reports of South African security services using rubber bullets, whips, and beatings to enforce the lockdown. As of April 4, at least three deaths have been attributed to security service brutality, and the defense minister condemned the heavy-handedness of soldiers. South Africa’s record of protecting of human rights amid the coronavirus crisis has so far been mixed.</p>
<p>As of April 7, it had 1,749 cases and 13 deaths, and the health minister acknowledged that testing must be vastly expanded to contain the outbreak effectively. As of April 6, the total number of tests conducted [PDF] was 58,098, but South Africa’s National Health Laboratory service has plans to increase testing to 36,000 every day by the end of April. According to the president, about 10,000 health workers have been mobilized to visit homes and screen residents for symptoms. This effort appears to be by far the greatest in Africa.</p>
<p>Africa in Transition John Campbell and Michelle Gavin track political and security developments across sub-Saharan Africa. Most weekdays.</p>
<p>The health minister provides daily, forthright briefings that are perceived as credible. He warns that the crisis has hardly started. Social distancing and hygiene are a challenge in the huge urban townships and informal settlements outside of South Africa&rsquo;s big cities. Residents are poor, if not as poor as elsewhere in Africa, and, presumably, frightened; confrontation with the security services would seem to be all but inevitable.</p>
<p>For now, President Ramaphosa and his health minister are getting high marks. Since he became president in 2018, Ramaphosa has worked to establish his authority over the bitterly divided governing African National Congress (ANC), where the allies of discredited former President Jacob Zuma are still active in opposing his reforms. If South African opinion leaders continue to see Ramaphosa as exerting strong leadership during this crisis, it will likely strengthen his hand within the ANC, and once the crisis is over, facilitate implementation of his reform program.
