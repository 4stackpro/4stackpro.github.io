Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a book which many children and adults adore. The 1964 story follows the adventures of young Charlie Bucket, when he finally gets to meet his hero, the eccentric chocolatier Willy Wonka. But how close is the book to the 1971 movie starring Gene Wilder, and what did Dahl think of the movie?</p>
<p>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory makes a number of deviations from the original book.</p>
<p>One of these deviations was the character of Slugworth, who was a minor character in the original book.</p>
<p>Slugworth was a rival chocolatier, who had previously sent spies into the factory and caused Wonka to have to close his factory after a sweet was plagiarised.</p>
<p>Wonka then brought in Oompa Loompas to run the factory, and kept it off-limits to the public, with Slugworth and other rivals desperate to get inside.

<h3 id="locked-down-open-up-to-mel-brooks-classic-blazing-saddles">Locked down? Open up to… Mel Brooks’ classic ‘Blazing Saddles’</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2020/04/4-8-20-blazing-saddles-e1586627014995-1024x640.jpg" alt="img">
JTA — Confined by the coronavirus plague over the Passover holiday, what better way to satisfy your hankering for freedom than seeing folks frolicking in the wide-open spaces of the Old West?</p>
<p>While you’re reveling in the great outdoors, you’ll also be laughing uproariously. And surprisingly learning a few lessons with Passover overtones.</p>
<p>We’re talking about “Blazing Saddles,” the 1974 western satire by the incomparable Mel Brooks. It’s a film I first saw as a teenager, and four-plus decades later I still say it’s the funniest ever. It’s currently streaming on Hulu for viewers in the United States, and is available to rent on a host of platforms including Amazon Video, YouTube, iTunes, and more.</p>

<p>With the madcap Brooks, you know this isn’t your ordinary western. Add to the mix that one of the writers along with Brooks is the comedy legend Richard Pryor and you’ve got a 90-minute remedy for any case of the cooped-up blues.</p>
<p>“Blazing Saddles” tells the story of a ruthless scheme hatched by a conniving aide named Hedley Lamarr (played by Harvey Korman) to the inept governor (Brooks) to drive out the residents of the frontier town Rock Ridge. It’s about to be destroyed to make way for a new railroad.</p>
<p>The plan: Install a black sheriff (Cleavon Little) that the, shall we say, racially insensitive residents will find so offensive they’ll leave in droves.</p>
<p>A little Yiddish story about Sheriff Bart: When he was a little boy, his family was in a one-horse wagon train confronted by Native Americans (Brooks also plays the chief). The Native Americans are about to kill Bart’s family when the chief mutters, “No, no. Zeit nisht meshuggah,” Yiddish for “Don’t be crazy.” Then he raises his arm to the skies and exclaims, “Loze im gaym!” or “Let them go!” There’s more Yiddish, too.</p>
<p>The townspeople aren’t exactly enamored of Bart, who brings in a sidekick as deputy: an alcoholic prisoner named Jim (Gene Wilder). They even use the N word, certainly taboo even back then, but used for shocking effect by Brooks.</p>
<p>The film is suffused with the kind of Jewish humor made legendary by Brooks.</p>
<p>Asked where his comedy comes from, Brooks once told My Jewish Learning, a sister site of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, in an interview: “It comes from the feeling that, as a Jew and as a person, you don’t fit into the mainstream of American society. It comes from the realization that even though you’re better and smarter, you’ll never belong.”</p>
<p>That’s Sheriff Bart and Jim in a nutshell.</p>
<p>The amazing talents of Wilder — who played a rabbi in “The Frisco Kid” — Kahn and Korman add to the Jewish mirth.</p>
<p>As for the lessons — there’s the core principle of Judaism about welcoming the stranger. And love thy neighbor. And at least one more: In unity there is strength — see the people coming together to beat their Pharaoh.</p>
<p>Some may object to the language in “Blazing Saddles” — the use of the N word and some unflattering terms for and portrayal of gays. But lest we forget, it’s used to poke fun at the racist thugs trying to take over Rock Ridge.</p>
<p>So sit back, grab a macaroon or two and enjoy.

<h3 id="hunkered-down-at-home-here-are-10-jewish-things-to-watch--j">Hunkered down at home? Here are 10 Jewish things to watch – J.</h3>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.jweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/image.jpg?w=1280&amp;crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C805px&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
There’s a ton of Jewish content out there these days, thanks to streaming services. So whether you’re actually quarantined or just engaging in social distancing, here is a mix of 10 varied Jewish pieces of entertainment that can help you keep your Jewish up while you hunker down.</p>
<p>Comedy</p>
<p>“Crazy Ex-Girlfriend”</p>
<p>Netflix, four seasons</p>
<p>A New York lawyer follows her old boyfriend (from camp!) to Southern California, makes some oddball, new friends and learns about herself through musical numbers — dropping in many, many Jewish moments along the way. Plus, a mental-health awareness storyline emerges in Season 3 and is tackled with great care from that point until the end of the series. Extra credit: Track the Jewish references in the episodes, which range from kugel to a challenging Jewish mother to Birthright Israel to identifying the Holocaust as a driver of Jewish identification. Consume with wine and rugelach.</p>
<p>“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”</p>
<p>Amazon Prime, three seasons</p>
<p>This is the show Jews love to love, unless they’re in the group of Jews who love to hate it. What’s to disagree on? (Have you met any Jews lately?) But seriously: The portrayals of these Jewish characters thrill some and irk others on every level from casting (some of the main actors aren’t Jewish) to how observance is pictured. If you haven’t watched it yet, give it a try. Now’s your chance to see Midge twirl about in nice dresses, assess whether her jokes are (or aren’t) funny and debate why Midge would buy her brisket for a Yom Kippur break-fast (with the rabbi!) from a nonkosher butcher. You also may want to consider how the series portrays Midge’s sister-in-law, Astrid, a Jew-by-choice: Is she meant to be comic relief or a religious touchstone? You decide.</p>
<p>“The Frisco Kid”</p>
<p>Available to rent on Amazon Prime, Google Play and iTunes</p>
<p>This comedy movie classic from 1979 features Gene Wilder as a rabbi (fresh from Poland) who needs to cross the American frontier to get to a pulpit job in San Francisco. Along the way, he encounters bank robber Harrison Ford, a 36-year-old Harrison Ford! To top things off, Wilder’s Rabbi Avram Belinski finished at the bottom of his class at his yeshiva, which sets up a lot of humor, such as the rabbi happening upon a colony of Amish people, whom he takes for Jews.</p>
<p>“Broad City”</p>
<p>Amazon Prime and Hulu, five seasons</p>
<p>Comedy Central’s hilarious and raunchy series looks inside the lives of Abbi and Ilana, two (unabashedly Jewish) best friends living in New York city, with a significant dollop of Jewish cultural identification and identity discussions. Watch one over Zoom with your girlfriends while sippin’ on Manischewi-Quarantinis.</p>
<p>“Mossad 101” (Season 1)</p>
<p>Netflix</p>
<p>Using Mossad’s agent selection program as a (fictional) competition provides alternately tense and humorous encounters. Officers assess the recruits’ smarts and skills, eliminating one candidate every episode. As a scripted series, not reality TV, it’s enjoyable and moves quickly, with snappy banter and dramatic moments to set up season 2. Bonus: It may provide parents with ideas about how to frame quarantine as a competition among their children, with incentives like an extra roll of toilet paper, Purell or other “luxury” item for the winner.</p>
<p>Drama</p>
<p>“Mossad 101” (Season 2)</p>
<p>Netflix</p>
<p>Why is this in the drama category when Season 1 is listed under comedy? Because sometimes that line is hard to parse, especially in Israel. But also because Season 2 makes a marked tonal shift. Gone is the lighthearted quality of Season 1’s “contest,” clearing the path toward an intense assignment in another country with real stakes. Use this season to kick off a conversation about the Mossad, its secrecy and whether an end will always justify a means.</p>
<p>“Srugim”</p>
<p>Hulu and Amazon Prime, three seasons</p>
<p>A dramatic series about religious singles in Jerusalem — some have called it “No Sex and the City” — that sends a message we already knew: Jewish dating is complicated; might as well stay inside. A great way to virtually visit Jerusalem’s German Colony and Katamon neighborhoods. Unfortunately, not a great way to pick up some rugelach at the Marzipan Bakery near Jerusalem’s Mahane Yehuda Market.</p>
<p>“False Flag”</p>
<p>Amazon Prime and Hulu, two seasons</p>
<p>Five people suspected of having carried out a political kidnapping get swept up in the investigation and publicity surrounding the event. The government treats them as suspects, and even their families begin to treat them with suspicion. Watch it in its original Hebrew (with English subtitles, if you like) to prep you for the Apple Plus U.S. remake, which stars Uma Thurman (“Pulp Fiction”), Noah Emmerich (“The Americans”) and Kunal Nayyar (“The Big Bang Theory”).</p>
<p>“Hunters”</p>
<p>Amazon Prime, one season</p>
<p>This gritty, comic book-styled fantasy imagines a group of vigilantes (led by Al Pacino) who track down Nazis in 1970s America … and kill them. It extrapolates from realistic Nazi sadism against Jews by creating fictional “games” of concentration camp persecution and torture. And thereby launches dozens of internet and podcast conversations both in favor of the series’ creativity and in condemnation of it for not portraying history accurately, even within a fictional context. (Honestly, there’s just no pleasing us.)</p>
<p>“Transparent”</p>
<p>Amazon Prime, four seasons and a musical finale</p>
<p>This critically acclaimed series about transgender parent Maura Pfefferman (San Francisco’s own Jeffrey Tambor) and her family also provides a deep dive into what Jewish culture and identity mean to the Pfefferman family. Supporting guest stars include deli meats, the mikvah, epigenetic trauma, marijuana, a family trip to Israel and Bradley Whitford.</p>
<p>In summary, there is more streaming content now than ever before — with more being added all the time. So tune in, Netflix and kvell, kvell and Purell … and #neverforget.
