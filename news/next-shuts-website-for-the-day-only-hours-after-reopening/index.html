Daily order limit imposed by retailer because of coronavirus crisis is met by 8.30am</p>
<p>Next shuts website for the day only hours after reopening</p>
<p>Next reopened its website on Tuesday, only to shut it again less than two hours later after meeting its daily order target.</p>
<p>The clothing retailer resumed its online operations at 7am on Tuesday, almost three weeks after pulling the plug because of because of concerns about the safety of staff in its warehouses during the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>Next began taking orders for children’s clothing and small homewares after putting extra safety measures in place, including cleaning kits and staff tabards marked on the back with the message “stay 2 metres apart”.</p>
<p>However, the company rapidly closed its website until Wednesday as it said it had met its daily order limit, reflecting the reduced capacity at its sites. It stopped taking new orders just after 8am, but allowed those with items already in their online baskets about 25 minutes to finish up.</p>
<p>The relaunch of Next’s online operation came as the company’s executives said they would be waiving 20% of their salaries, during the “challenging period” of the coronavirus outbreak. If the cut covered a year’s worth of pay it would amount to a salary reduction of more than £160,000 for Next’s chief executive, Lord Wolfson. The retailer’s bosses are also deferring this year’s bonus payments which totalled £350,000 for Wolfson. However, a long-term share bonus, valued at £1.7m in the accounts, took his total haul for last year to more than £3m, his biggest payout since 2016.</p>

Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.</p>
<p>A statement on the website said: “In order to operate our warehouse safely, we are limiting the number of warehouse colleagues working at any time, and so we will limit the number of customer orders we can take each day.</p>
<p>“We have successfully tested opening and taking a limited number of orders today. Please come back again tomorrow morning.”</p>
<p>Analysts at broking firm Peel Hunt said: “Next hit this daily limit before 8.30am today, suggesting customer demand remains high as ever.” The analysts suggested that the retailer, which sells a number of other clothing brands as well as its own items, would benefit from an industry-wide effort to clear spring and summer stock that has piled up in warehouses during the high street shutdown.</p>
<p>However, Next has predicted that disruption stemming from the outbreak could wipe £1bn off this year’s sales.</p>
<p>Next closed its online operation in late March after concern about the safety of workers in its warehouses and criticism of the continued operation of online stores selling goods considered non-essential.</p>

<p>The high street chain River Island and the luxury fashion retailer Net-A-Porter have also stopped making online deliveries while Asos has come under fire for poor conditions at its Barnsley warehouse.</p>
<p>Next said it had asked for volunteers from its staff to return to work this week and consulted with the Usdaw union on how to select those suitable. About 3,000 volunteers have come forward so far.</p>
<p>The company said it would not be using workers with a temperature, those classified as vulnerable because of health conditions, or who lived with someone vulnerable, or anyone who needed to take public transport to work.</p>
<p>Each member of staff returning to work will receive special training, a process which is expected to take at least several days during which time the number of orders being processed will gradually ramp up.

<h3 id="next-relaunches-its-website-to-take-online-orders-again---what-shoppers-need-to-know">Next relaunches its website to take online orders again - what shoppers need to know</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.swindonadvertiser.co.uk/resources/images/9789150/" alt="img">
Next has relaunched its website after temporarily closing for a fortnight due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The clothing and homeware retailer recently listed a number of its 16 UK-based warehouses for sale, in order to raise funds, after hundreds of its stores temporarily closed amidst the nationwide lockdown.</p>
<p>When is the online store reopening?</p>
<p>The Next website will begin to take orders again on Wednesday (April 15), now that several new safety measures have been implemented in the company’s warehouses and distribution centres.</p>
<p>New safety measures include additional walkways and one-way systems to help keep staff at a safe distance from one another.</p>
<p>Usdaw, the union for retail workers which has been working during the pandemic to ensure staff safety, has supported Next’s reopening of its online stores, warehouses and distribution centres due to the safety measures in place.</p>
<p>Next also has the support of its staff, with over 3,000 employees agreeing to return to work.</p>
<p>Why did the online store close?</p>
<p>The retailer was one of the first companies to temporarily close its shop and warehouse doors in an attempt to stop the spread of coronavirus among shoppers and staff, when the Government lockdown was announced in March.</p>
<p>Upon closing last month, the company addressed the decision on the Next website stating: &ldquo;We have listened carefully to our colleagues in our warehouses and distribution operations. It is clear that many increasingly feel they should be at home in the current climate.”</p>
<p>What you can buy and purchasing restrictions</p>
<p>The reopening of the website will be a gradual process, with only a small range available to shoppers initially. Set limits will also be placed on the number of items one shopper can purchase in a single day.</p>
<p>Next will start by selling childrenswear and selected homeware items, for delivery in 3 days.</p>
<p>A statement from Next explains: “In order to operate our warehouse safely, we are limiting the number of warehouse colleagues working at any time, and so we will limit the number of customer orders we can take each day.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, before the relaunch, shoppers can browse the site and add any wanted items into a ‘favourites wishlist’.</p>
<p>Raising funds</p>
<p>The government’s lockdown measures have brought about financial insecurity to several companies nationwide, and Next is no different.</p>
<p>In a desperate attempt to raise much needed cash, the company has announced that it will sell its head office in Leicester, along with three warehouses.</p>
<p>These properties would then be leased back to Next as part of a mitigation strategy, which could raise up to £100 million for the company.
