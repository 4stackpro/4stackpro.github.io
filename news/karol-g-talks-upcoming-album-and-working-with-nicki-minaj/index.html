Karol G On The Magic Of &ldquo;Tusa,&rdquo; Working With Nicki Minaj And New Album</p>
<p>The international superstar is focused and determined to keep women first in reggaeton.</p>
<p>Karol G&rsquo;s devoted intentions have kept her ahead of the history books.</p>
<p>As Women&rsquo;s History Month comes to a close, the reggaeton titan solidified her position just weeks prior on Internation Women&rsquo;s Day as Spotify included her in their list of the Top 10 Most-Streamed Female Artists. Others included were Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande in addition to iconic women of color like Nicki Minaj. But Karol&rsquo;s presence on the list proves just how she&rsquo;s been able to bridge the gap between Latin and pop music as the only woman on the list who primarily performs in Spanish.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something Karol, born Carolina Giraldo Navarro, has done since coming up in the male-dominated reggaeton scene. While plenty of her hits over the years have earned a coveted spot in the hearts of millions, it was her recent recording with Nicki Minaj that reminded everyone of her power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I grew up listening to her and we were sitting at the table across from each other,&rdquo; Karol says of &ldquo;Tusa&rdquo; and its insanely popular video that has 669 million views and counting on YouTube. &ldquo;That was an iconic moment for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The song&rsquo;s title is Colombian slang for heartache after a breakup. On the regal reggaeton bop, Karol has Minaj rapping in Spanish as they promise to one another to eliminate those feels on the dance floor. The Tusa-terminators made history in late 2019 with the release as the song is the first collaboration by women to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart.</p>
<p>On the all-genre Hot 100 chart, &ldquo;Tusa&rdquo; impressively peaked at No. 42. Amid the coronavirus outbreak, self-quarantines in Panama were recently singing the song together from their balconies.</p>
<p>For Karol, success like this has been over a decade in the making since signing her first contract in 2006 under her G stage name. At that time, reggaeton music was reigning over the globe thanks to Puerto Rican rapper Daddy Yankee&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gasolina&rdquo; setting the movement ablaze in 2004.</p>
<p>The música urbana genre was very much a man&rsquo;s world with a few women who were able to rise to the level of Yankee like Ivy Queen, someone Karol cites as an influence. &ldquo;With the urbano music I wanted to do, there were not a lot of women,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I love urbano rhythms. They&rsquo;ve always fascinated me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the early steps of her career, Karol took advantage of the art of collaboration with Nicky Jam on 2013&rsquo;s &ldquo;Amour de Dos,&rdquo; Ozuna on &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; in 2016 and a budding rapper by the name of Bad Bunny on 2017&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ahora Me Llama.&rdquo; Her method was mindful and direct as she gained new fans in every pocket of reggaeton&rsquo;s wide-ranging cloth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had a big audience and following,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;The way I got my opportunity as an artist and was able to be heard more was, in part, thanks to them.&rdquo; Later that year, Karol&rsquo;s debut album Unstoppable landed at No. 2 on the Top Latin Albums chart.</p>
<p>As she became the feature queen in her own right, Karol dropped &ldquo;Mi Cama&rdquo; in 2018 which led to her winning the gramophone for Best New Artist at the Latin Grammy Awards that year. &ldquo;I love to sing in reggaeton, but it&rsquo;s not the only thing I do,&rdquo; she says about her diverse palette. The spirited 2019 release of Ocean showcased the vastness of her artistry with urbano, reggae, and pop influences.</p>
<p>With &ldquo;Tusa&rdquo; previewing her third album, VIBE VIVA spoke with Karol about her musical journey so far and what&rsquo;s coming next.</p>
<hr>
<p>VIBE: On physical copies of Unstoppable, there&rsquo;s the #GirlPower stamp. What inspired you to include it?</p>
<p>Karol G: I have that tattooed on one of my arms as well because for me, it was a frustration that people in the media were telling me, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a woman. You don&rsquo;t have anything to do here. You can&rsquo;t enter here.&rdquo; There are women that can achieve things around the world. That&rsquo;s where my motivation comes from: to show that we, and myself as a woman, can do it. That was important for me to put on the album to show my support for this movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mi Cama&rdquo; became one of your biggest hits without a featured artist. What&rsquo;s the story behind that song?</p>
<p>I loved that song because it has the attitude that I feel right now. It&rsquo;s a song about a woman talking to her ex-boyfriend who left her for someone else. It has the attitude to keep going, to keep dancing, or perrear (a twerk-like dance associated with reggaeton). In Mexico, I was in a press conference and a female reporter said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t respect how you as a woman are singing about your bed making noise. You have to think about the children.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t music for children.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a song that&rsquo;s exaggerated. I&rsquo;m not swearing on it. I always tell that story at my shows and people love it.</p>
<p>How did you feel to win the Latin Grammy for Best New Artist?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the top five moments in my career. I dreamed of that moment since I was a little girl. When I was nominated, that was huge. I didn&rsquo;t think I was going to win. When I won, my mind went blank. I took my dad on stage with me because he&rsquo;s been supporting me since the beginning. After winning the grammy, my mindset has been what else I can do in my career that&rsquo;s even bigger.</p>
<p>You have recorded a lot of music with your fiancé Puerto Rican rapper Anuel AA. How do you like working with him?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a super team. We complement each other well. We understand each other well because we&rsquo;ve enjoyed many great moments together. We&rsquo;ve gotten to travel together. We did a tour together. It&rsquo;s a beautiful thing. We keep each other focused and motivated with our feet on the ground.</p>
<p>What do you think about the reaction and all the memes around &ldquo;Tusa&rdquo;?</p>
<p>I felt in my heart the song would be successful, but I never thought that it would be a global hit. It opened doors for me in markets where I&rsquo;ve never had songs hit before. It&rsquo;s charting in countries that don&rsquo;t speak Spanish like France, Italy, and Sweden. Seeing all the memes from the people has been muy brutal (Puerto Rican slang for &ldquo;beyond awesome&rdquo;). It&rsquo;s been incredible to see so many men connecting with it. To see all the people dancing and singing to it has been a surprise. I hope my next single will be like that, but for now, it&rsquo;s nice to enjoy what&rsquo;s happening with &ldquo;Tusa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking of men, many gay men been bumping &ldquo;Tusa&rdquo; too. I was wondering if you had a message for your fans in the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
<p>I love having part of my following from that community. I love people who can go out into the world and be fearless. I&rsquo;m very proud of that because the world really lacks people like that: people with personality, attitude, and a strong will. That&rsquo;s something I admire very much from that community. They have a beautiful energy.</p>
<p>What are your plans for the rest of this year?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy because I&rsquo;m working on a lot of music. I&rsquo;ve gotten great invitations to work on projects with other artists. Right now I&rsquo;m collaborating with artists in the Latin and Anglo markets. There are songs that are coming out very soon. It&rsquo;s a year for expanding and globalizing my name. We have a tour in Latin America and one in Europe again. We&rsquo;re going to end the second semester of the tour in the US with the release of my next album.</p>
<p>What do you see for the future of women in reggaeton music?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s things I hope to evolve a little more, but I feel like we knocked over the door. That we&rsquo;ve come through and people are hearing us. People are coming to our concerts. Artists are inviting us to their shows. We&rsquo;re here. I try to stick up for myself more as a human being. We&rsquo;re all talented in our own ways. I feel like women are demonstrating that. It&rsquo;s an era where women are taking chances and going for bigger things.

<p><img src="https://mui.today/__export/1585602941261/sites/mui/img/2020/03/30/f608x342-1895_31618_0_jpg_423682103.jpg_402218074.jpg" alt="img">
La hermana de Karol G presume de ser la mejor en esto</p>
<p>Por: Johen Velasco 30 de Marzo 2020 · 18:03 hs</p>
<p>Verónica Giraldo, hermana de la cantante Karol G es una colombiana de 32 años de edad, amante de los perros y los días de playa, que durante las últimas dos semanas ha incrementado su actividad en redes sociales debido a la cuarentena.</p>
<p>Quizás por este motivo Verónica ha publicado un viejo vídeo del pasado cumpleaños de Karol G, donde se le puede ver participando en el conocido juego de fiesta ‘la silla’, el cual consiste en bailar alrededor de un círculo de sillas hasta que la música se detenga y corresponda sentarse.</p>
<p>En el vídeo se puede ver también Karol G y Anuel AA participando en este divertido juego, sin embargo para Verónica pasar a la siguiente ronda del juego sería una dura tarea por la que tuvo que esforzarse más que el resto, pero al final ganó.</p>
<p>Tal y como comentó Verónica junto a la publicación en su cuenta de instagram, “Yo siempre lucho por mi SILLA @warri0rprincess te gane .. Un poco de humor a todo esto&hellip; familia unida, familia muy feliz.. LOS AMO Y EXTRAÑO ESTOS MOMENTOS”. Y es que ha dejado demostrado que sabe pelear por &lsquo;la silla&rsquo; mejor que Karol G.</p>
<p>Por su parte varios de los seguidores de Vero comentaron mensajes positivos sobre la nostálgica publicación: “amo ese video es muy bueno”, “Uy si cojo la silla por qué la cojo, te quiero”, “Jajaja como olvidar ese momento de alegría, I Love You”.
