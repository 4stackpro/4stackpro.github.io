Karol G On The Magic Of &ldquo;Tusa,&rdquo; Working With Nicki Minaj And New Album</p>
<p>The international superstar is focused and determined to keep women first in reggaeton.</p>
<p>Karol G&rsquo;s devoted intentions have kept her ahead of the history books.</p>
<p>As Women&rsquo;s History Month comes to a close, the reggaeton titan solidified her position just weeks prior on Internation Women&rsquo;s Day as Spotify included her in their list of the Top 10 Most-Streamed Female Artists. Others included were Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande in addition to iconic women of color like Nicki Minaj. But Karol&rsquo;s presence on the list proves just how she&rsquo;s been able to bridge the gap between Latin and pop music as the only woman on the list who primarily performs in Spanish.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something Karol, born Carolina Giraldo Navarro, has done since coming up in the male-dominated reggaeton scene. While plenty of her hits over the years have earned a coveted spot in the hearts of millions, it was her recent recording with Nicki Minaj that reminded everyone of her power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I grew up listening to her and we were sitting at the table across from each other,&rdquo; Karol says of &ldquo;Tusa&rdquo; and its insanely popular video that has 669 million views and counting on YouTube. &ldquo;That was an iconic moment for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The song&rsquo;s title is Colombian slang for heartache after a breakup. On the regal reggaeton bop, Karol has Minaj rapping in Spanish as they promise to one another to eliminate those feels on the dance floor. The Tusa-terminators made history in late 2019 with the release as the song is the first collaboration by women to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart.</p>
<p>On the all-genre Hot 100 chart, &ldquo;Tusa&rdquo; impressively peaked at No. 42. Amid the coronavirus outbreak, self-quarantines in Panama were recently singing the song together from their balconies.</p>
<p>For Karol, success like this has been over a decade in the making since signing her first contract in 2006 under her G stage name. At that time, reggaeton music was reigning over the globe thanks to Puerto Rican rapper Daddy Yankee&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gasolina&rdquo; setting the movement ablaze in 2004.</p>
<p>The m√∫sica urbana genre was very much a man&rsquo;s world with a few women who were able to rise to the level of Yankee like Ivy Queen, someone Karol cites as an influence. &ldquo;With the urbano music I wanted to do, there were not a lot of women,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I love urbano rhythms. They&rsquo;ve always fascinated me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the early steps of her career, Karol took advantage of the art of collaboration with Nicky Jam on 2013&rsquo;s &ldquo;Amour de Dos,&rdquo; Ozuna on &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; in 2016 and a budding rapper by the name of Bad Bunny on 2017&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ahora Me Llama.&rdquo; Her method was mindful and direct as she gained new fans in every pocket of reggaeton&rsquo;s wide-ranging cloth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had a big audience and following,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;The way I got my opportunity as an artist and was able to be heard more was, in part, thanks to them.&rdquo; Later that year, Karol&rsquo;s debut album Unstoppable landed at No. 2 on the Top Latin Albums chart.</p>
<p>As she became the feature queen in her own right, Karol dropped &ldquo;Mi Cama&rdquo; in 2018 which led to her winning the gramophone for Best New Artist at the Latin Grammy Awards that year. &ldquo;I love to sing in reggaeton, but it&rsquo;s not the only thing I do,&rdquo; she says about her diverse palette. The spirited 2019 release of Ocean showcased the vastness of her artistry with urbano, reggae, and pop influences.</p>
<p>With &ldquo;Tusa&rdquo; previewing her third album, VIBE VIVA spoke with Karol about her musical journey so far and what&rsquo;s coming next.</p>
<hr>
<p>VIBE: On physical copies of Unstoppable, there&rsquo;s the #GirlPower stamp. What inspired you to include it?</p>
<p>Karol G: I have that tattooed on one of my arms as well because for me, it was a frustration that people in the media were telling me, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a woman. You don&rsquo;t have anything to do here. You can&rsquo;t enter here.&rdquo; There are women that can achieve things around the world. That&rsquo;s where my motivation comes from: to show that we, and myself as a woman, can do it. That was important for me to put on the album to show my support for this movement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mi Cama&rdquo; became one of your biggest hits without a featured artist. What&rsquo;s the story behind that song?</p>
<p>I loved that song because it has the attitude that I feel right now. It&rsquo;s a song about a woman talking to her ex-boyfriend who left her for someone else. It has the attitude to keep going, to keep dancing, or perrear (a twerk-like dance associated with reggaeton). In Mexico, I was in a press conference and a female reporter said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t respect how you as a woman are singing about your bed making noise. You have to think about the children.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t music for children.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a song that&rsquo;s exaggerated. I&rsquo;m not swearing on it. I always tell that story at my shows and people love it.</p>
<p>How did you feel to win the Latin Grammy for Best New Artist?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one of the top five moments in my career. I dreamed of that moment since I was a little girl. When I was nominated, that was huge. I didn&rsquo;t think I was going to win. When I won, my mind went blank. I took my dad on stage with me because he&rsquo;s been supporting me since the beginning. After winning the grammy, my mindset has been what else I can do in my career that&rsquo;s even bigger.</p>
<p>You have recorded a lot of music with your fianc√© Puerto Rican rapper Anuel AA. How do you like working with him?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a super team. We complement each other well. We understand each other well because we&rsquo;ve enjoyed many great moments together. We&rsquo;ve gotten to travel together. We did a tour together. It&rsquo;s a beautiful thing. We keep each other focused and motivated with our feet on the ground.</p>
<p>What do you think about the reaction and all the memes around &ldquo;Tusa&rdquo;?</p>
<p>I felt in my heart the song would be successful, but I never thought that it would be a global hit. It opened doors for me in markets where I&rsquo;ve never had songs hit before. It&rsquo;s charting in countries that don&rsquo;t speak Spanish like France, Italy, and Sweden. Seeing all the memes from the people has been muy brutal (Puerto Rican slang for &ldquo;beyond awesome&rdquo;). It&rsquo;s been incredible to see so many men connecting with it. To see all the people dancing and singing to it has been a surprise. I hope my next single will be like that, but for now, it&rsquo;s nice to enjoy what&rsquo;s happening with &ldquo;Tusa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking of men, many gay men been bumping &ldquo;Tusa&rdquo; too. I was wondering if you had a message for your fans in the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
<p>I love having part of my following from that community. I love people who can go out into the world and be fearless. I&rsquo;m very proud of that because the world really lacks people like that: people with personality, attitude, and a strong will. That&rsquo;s something I admire very much from that community. They have a beautiful energy.</p>
<p>What are your plans for the rest of this year?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy because I&rsquo;m working on a lot of music. I&rsquo;ve gotten great invitations to work on projects with other artists. Right now I&rsquo;m collaborating with artists in the Latin and Anglo markets. There are songs that are coming out very soon. It&rsquo;s a year for expanding and globalizing my name. We have a tour in Latin America and one in Europe again. We&rsquo;re going to end the second semester of the tour in the US with the release of my next album.</p>
<p>What do you see for the future of women in reggaeton music?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s things I hope to evolve a little more, but I feel like we knocked over the door. That we&rsquo;ve come through and people are hearing us. People are coming to our concerts. Artists are inviting us to their shows. We&rsquo;re here. I try to stick up for myself more as a human being. We&rsquo;re all talented in our own ways. I feel like women are demonstrating that. It&rsquo;s an era where women are taking chances and going for bigger things.

La hermana de Karol G presume de ser la mejor en esto</p>
<p>Por: Johen Velasco 30 de Marzo 2020 ¬∑ 18:03 hs</p>
<p>Ver√≥nica Giraldo, hermana de la cantante Karol G es una colombiana de 32 a√±os de edad, amante de los perros y los d√≠as de playa, que durante las √∫ltimas dos semanas ha incrementado su actividad en redes sociales debido a la cuarentena.</p>
<p>Quiz√°s por este motivo Ver√≥nica ha publicado un viejo v√≠deo del pasado cumplea√±os de Karol G, donde se le puede ver participando en el conocido juego de fiesta ‚Äòla silla‚Äô, el cual consiste en bailar alrededor de un c√≠rculo de sillas hasta que la m√∫sica se detenga y corresponda sentarse.</p>
<p>En el v√≠deo se puede ver tambi√©n Karol G y Anuel AA participando en este divertido juego, sin embargo para Ver√≥nica pasar a la siguiente ronda del juego ser√≠a una dura tarea por la que tuvo que esforzarse m√°s que el resto, pero al final gan√≥.</p>
<p>Tal y como coment√≥ Ver√≥nica junto a la publicaci√≥n en su cuenta de instagram, ‚ÄúYo siempre lucho por mi SILLA @warri0rprincess te gane .. Un poco de humor a todo esto&hellip; familia unida, familia muy feliz.. LOS AMO Y EXTRA√ëO ESTOS MOMENTOS‚Äù. Y es que ha dejado demostrado que sabe pelear por &lsquo;la silla&rsquo; mejor que Karol G.</p>
<p>Por su parte varios de los seguidores de Vero comentaron mensajes positivos sobre la nost√°lgica publicaci√≥n: ‚Äúamo ese video es muy bueno‚Äù, ‚ÄúUy si cojo la silla por qu√© la cojo, te quiero‚Äù, ‚ÄúJajaja como olvidar ese momento de alegr√≠a, I Love You‚Äù.
