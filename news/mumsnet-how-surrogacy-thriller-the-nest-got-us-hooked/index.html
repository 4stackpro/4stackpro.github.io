At first, it seemed like just another twisty drama. But Nicole Taylor’s series, which concludes tonight, has proved a gripping, intriguing look at class, ambition and mistakes</p>
<p>There are always shows that take you by surprise. Nicole Taylor’s five-part drama The Nest, which concludes tonight, is one of them. When this surrogacy thriller kicked off, it had the look of another enjoyably glossy slice of hokum. In the vein of Gold Digger, Doctor Foster or Flesh and Blood, it seemed as if it would be the kind of programme you watch as much for the characters’ lifestyle choices – in particular the sleek loch-side house that protagonists Dan (Martin Compston) and Emily (Sophie Rundle) Doherty live in – as for the actual plot.</p>
<p>We couldn’t have been more wrong. Taylor, who wrote Three Girls and film Wild Rose, has always been an ambitious and subtle writer, and the house that the Dohertys live in isn’t simply a nice bit of property porn but rather a symbol of their privilege in a rapidly changing Glasgow. Similarly, as the drama has twisted and turned, shifting our sympathies from one character to the next, so it has become increasingly impossible to predict how it will end.</p>
<p>With Dan and Emily seemingly happy to accept their baby despite the murky circumstances of her birth (even Taylor isn’t averse to the old “mixed-up embryos” plot twist), the biggest question remains the one over Doddy’s death. Was it a gang killing, as hinted at by last night’s bleak (and clever) ending in which social worker James (James Harkness) was arrested for having accessed private information and then handed those details over to a local Mr Big? Or could Dan or teen surrogate Kaya (the magnificent Mirren Mack) be more involved than we know?</p>
<p>What about Dan’s Mr Fix-It, the sinister Souter – how far might he be prepared to go to protect the man he clearly views as both surrogate son and investment? And what of journalist Eleanor (Katie Leung)? Is she, as she claims, simply trying to protect the vulnerable Kaya, or does she have another axe to grind?</p>

<p>Will we find out why Kaya stabbed a pregnant woman to death at age 11 – and do we need to? A large part of The Nest has centred around the idea of redemption, and it’s clear that Kaya knows the awfulness of her crime and deeply regrets it. Do we really need to know more than that she is “Scotland’s Mary Bell”?</p>
<p>Can Hilary (Fiona Bell) save her marriage and reconcile with her son or will she continue to put her brother’s needs above her own family?</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest question of all remains: can Kaya – whose last solid pillar, James, has just been removed from her life – manage to find the stability she so desperately craves, particularly when her malevolent mother (a scene-stealing Shirley Henderson) is edging ever closer?</p>
<p>Whatever happens, one thing will be clear: Taylor’s clear-eyed script will continue to contrast the glittering Glasgow of Dan Doherty’s property empire with the precarious lives of those scrabbling around its edges. As the series has progressed, it has become increasingly obvious that this is not so much a thriller about surrogacy as it is a fierce commentary on aspiration, class and success – on who gets to have ambitions in life and who doesn’t.</p>
<p>When James was arrested at the end of last night’s episode, he didn’t give us the stock TV villain’s justification but something more interesting and believable. Here was a man trying to make a difference, trying to provide for his daughter and help people start again; but he was also barely making enough money to get by, he was worried that he couldn’t provide for his child and increasingly concerned that he would lose custody of her. Seeing an easy way to make money on the side, he took it, and justified it by thinking of those he set up as “druggie scum”.</p>

<p>That notion that some people know better than others (or rather that some people believe they do) looms large over The Nest. We see it in the uncomfortable relationship between Dan and Hilary, who raised him from when he was a “wee bampot” and who he has attempted to repay by picking up her sons’ school fees and covering her mortgage.</p>
<p>Yet with that good deed comes a certain expectation of subservience. It’s an attitude that threatens her marriage and her relationship with her elder son, Jack. Similarly, when Emily, who tries to wear her middle-class privilege lightly but doesn’t always succeed, learned that the baby Kaya delivered was the result of an embryo implantation mix-up, her immediate reaction was to try to find “her” baby, the “real” baby; whereas Dan instinctively understood that the baby Kaya gave birth to was the baby that they were meant to raise. For the Emilys of this world, Taylor suggested, love can be conditional: if things don’t work out, you pack up your emotions and think about walking away.</p>
<p>Nowhere is the discordance between those who assume life will provide for them and those who have to fight for every crumb more obvious than in the character of Kaya. In a lesser series, Kaya would be reduced to psychopath or avenging angel, little more than a plot device to remind the middle classes of the perils of trusting those not among their own. Not here, however.</p>
<p>If there is a driving force behind Taylor’s drama, it is a furious awareness that the Kayas of this world make people uncomfortable, and that we prefer to ignore them rather than look at why they act as they do. We dismiss them, refusing to acknowledge that they might have dreams and desires of their own. Taylor, aided by a lovely, subtle performance from Mack, shows us repeatedly how very unfair that is. Kaya might be damaged, difficult and struggling to overcome a terrible past, but she is also warm, caring and desperate, above everything, to be loved.</p>
<p>Will she achieve the happy ending she longs for? The odds are stacked against her, yet despite everything, I can’t help hoping that she does. It would be an intriguing conclusion to a show that has consistently defied our expectations.</p>
<p>• The Nest concludes tonight, 9pm, BBC One.

Review: Finale of BBC One&rsquo;s The Nest - and why it deserves a second series</p>
<p><em>Spoiler alert</em> Halfway through this intelligent, gripping and questioning drama, Martin Compston posted a split-screen image of himself on Twitter with the caption: “One bench, two jobs, 17 years apart and both in my home town.”</p>
<p>By Aidan Smith Monday, 13th April 2020, 7:32 pm Updated Monday, 13th April 2020, 10:04 pm</p>
<p>L-R Dan (MARTIN COMPSTON), Emily (SOPHIE RUNDLE), Kaya (MIRREN MACK) - (C) Studio Lambert - Photographer: Mark Mainz Copyright: Other 3rd Party</p>
<p>In the Ken Loach film Sweet Sixteen, the Greenock-born actor was a troubled teenager who decided his best escape was to steal heroin and flog it to buy a caravan for his mum when she got out of jail.</p>
<p>Nicole Taylor’s series concerned another troubled teen, Kaya (marvellous Mirren Mack), who was dubbed Scotland’s Mary Bell for the fatal stabbing, aged 11, of her pregnant aunt. She decided her best escape was to carry a baby for Glasgow property kingpin Dan Docherty (Compston) and his wife Emily.</p>

<p>What a tangled web Taylor weaved, stretching from a sink estate to a property-porn dreamhome. Who was exploiting who? What’s a baby worth? Who were we supposed to feel most sorry for? If Docherty could break out of poverty and into middle-class respectability via crime, why couldn’t Kaya when her “offence” seemed like a good deed?</p>
<p>Confirming just how tangled surrogacy can be, this was how the radio’s phone-in rattled and hummed when news of the Dochertys’ £70,000 splash broke: “Paying for a baby shouldn’t be allowed &hellip; that means everything’s for sale now &hellip; women have a right to do whatever they want with their bodies in the male patriarchy &hellip; if that’s what feminism is, renting out your womb, it’s a disgrace.”</p>
<p>Apart from the final ten minutes when there was probably no avoiding the clutter of explanatory chat, Taylor kept all of her plates spinning, along with all of our emotions. Almost every character dipped in and out of favour, although some like Kaya’s mother (creepy Shirley Henderson) didn’t get back in. The only one who was consistently noble was Liz Ewing’s social worker. The only one who was consistently an erse was the newspaper editor, a lazy relic who called his female reporters “wee lassies”.

She&rsquo;s currently starring as Emily in BBC One surrogacy thriller The Nest.</p>
<p>And on Monday, Sophie Rundle unveiled her new pink hair after dying it in &lsquo;on a whim&rsquo; while in quarantine, admitting that she thought no one would see her.</p>
<p>The Bodyguard actress, 31, appeared on This Morning alongside co-star Mirren Mack (who plays Kaia in The Nest) via video link from her home to talk about the finale of The Nest.</p>
<p>New &lsquo;do: On Monday, Sophie Rundle, 31, unveiled her new pink hair after dying it in &lsquo;on a whim&rsquo; while in quarantine, admitting that she thought no one would see her</p>
<p>After pointing out the new colour of her hair, Eamonn Holmes asked: &lsquo;Was it a home kit? And did it go right or did it go wrong?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sophie admitted: &lsquo;It was such a whim. And I was like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in quarantine, no one&rsquo;s gonna see me, I&rsquo;ll dye my hair pink&rdquo; and then I remembered that I&rsquo;d agreed to come on national breakfast television, so&hellip;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s lovely! It&rsquo;s really lovely! We love it!&rsquo; insisted Eamonn as Sophie and Mirren burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Sophie had taken to Instagram a few days earlier to show off her new locks, but the pink seemed to be a less vibrant shade than the hot pink hue displayed during her This Morning appearance.</p>
<p>TV debut for the &lsquo;do: The actress appeared on This Morning alongside co-star Mirren Mack (who plays Kaia in The Nest) via video link from their homes to talk about the finale of The Nest</p>
<p>Spontaneous! After pointing out the new colour of her hair, Eamonn Holmes asked: &lsquo;Was it a home kit? Did it go right or did it go wrong?&rsquo; to which Sophie admitted: &lsquo;It was such a whim&rsquo;</p>
<p>Oh no! &lsquo;And I was like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in quarantine, no one&rsquo;s gonna see me, I&rsquo;ll dye my hair pink&rdquo; and then I remembered that I&rsquo;d agreed to come on national breakfast television, so&hellip;&rsquo; she admitted</p>
<p>Sophie is engaged to fellow actor Matt Stokoe, 31, who is best known for his roles in best known for his roles as Alex in Misfits.</p>
<p>The couple - who met making the TV costume drama Jamestown - live together in South London and share an adorable puppy, named Buddy.</p>
<p>Matt acted alongside fiance Sophie in the thriller Bodyguard, where he played crime boss Luke Aikens.</p>
<p>Pretty in pink: Sophie had taken to Instagram a few days earlier to show off her new locks</p>
<p>Starring roles: Most recently, the actress starred as Ann Walker in Gentleman Jack (pictured with co-star Suranne Jones who played Anne Lister)</p>
<p>In 2019 the couple launched their own production company, which has completed its first film, Rose.</p>
<p>In May 2019, Sophie let slip that they were engaged during an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, saying:</p>
<p>She revealed: &lsquo;We got engaged a couple of weeks ago. The whole wedding thing is weird, though.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Everyone expects you to be desperate to be a princess for the day… that&rsquo;s really not my scene.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Looking good: Her pink tresses seemed to be a less vibrant shade than the hot pink hue displayed during her This Morning appearance</p>
<p>A star: Sophie starred as Ada Shelby in the BBC Two historic crime drama series Peaky Blinders</p>
<p>Versatile: Sophie played rookie policewoman Kirsten McAskill in BBC series Happy Valley</p>
<p>In an interview with Daily Mail in August 2019, Sophie admitted: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve never felt glamorous in my life. I&rsquo;m very confident on set, but red carpets and designer clothes make me feel very exposed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t get into acting because I thought I was impossibly good-looking, I was just a kid who loved telling stories.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some actors lead these rock-star-style lives. I like gardening and putting Ikea furniture together. I&rsquo;m a DIY nut!&rsquo;</p>
<p>What a CV! Sophie appeared in the critically acclaimed six-part thriller Bodyguard</p>
<p>Talented: She is currently gracing the nation&rsquo;s screens alongside Martin Compson and Mirren Mack in five-part psychological drama The Nest (pictured)</p>
