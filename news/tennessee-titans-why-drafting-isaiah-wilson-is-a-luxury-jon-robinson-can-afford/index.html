NASHVILLE — With the 29th pick in the 2020 NFL Draft, the Tennessee Titans select(ed) Georgia offensive tackle Isaiah Wilson.</p>
<p>Fans will hate it, (most) media were caught off guard by it and GM Jon Robinson knows it’s a luxury that his team can afford.</p>
<p>“(Wilson)’s a big man, I mean, at 6-foot-seven, 350 (pounds), and almost 36-inch arms, he’s a tough guy to get out of the way of,” Robinson told media Thursday night. “He’s got excellent power to move the line of scrimmage in the run game, and he’s tough to get around in the pass game. I thought I saw some blocks at the highest level in the SEC where he gets up to level two, and he forces linebackers – if he gets his paws on him, they’re usually done for. But he certainly impacts the path that they take to the back.”</p>
<p>The immediate push-back on the pick will be the contract of veteran Dennis Kelly, whom Tennessee brought back as one of the team’s unrestricted free agents. It should also be noted that there was an attempt by Robinson to trade out of the 29th selection.</p>
<p>“There were other positions that we were looking at, but felt that Isaiah (Wilson) was really just the right player for us,” said Robinson. “We talked a little bit, we had a little bit of action in there at 29, it kind of fizzled out late. But, we’ll get back in the ring tomorrow night and keep punching at this thing.”</p>
<p>Acquired by trade in Robinson’s first year at the helm, Kelly received a three-year, $17.25M contract less than two months ago. The assumption was that the long-time swing tackle would be the immediate solution on the right side of the Titans line with starter Jack Conklin departing for big money in Cleveland. Wilson, though, presented well for Robinson and coach Mike Vrabel at February’s combine, has the tape of an AP All-SEC second team player and fits perfectly with a Tennessee offense that is built to punish.</p>
<p>Wilson’s presence will immediately push Kelly for the starting gig in 2020.</p>
<p>“I think the best part of my game right now is that I am physical and I enjoy beating people up,” Wilson told Nashville media after being drafted. “I enjoy running the ball, I enjoy trying to essentially break another man’s will. That is what I enjoy about the game.”</p>
<p>With an offensive line of Taylor Lewan (6′-7″, 309), Rodger Saffold (6’-5”, 323), Ben Jones (6’-3”, 308), Nate Davis (6’-3”, 316) and Kelly (6′-8″, 321) and a running back in Derrick Henry that stands 6’-3” and clocks in at 247, Tennessee’s offense did not lack for size with the addition of Wilson. There is a brutality, though, that the Georgia product plays with that further entrenches that thumping mindset Vrabel and Robinson want to grow further. As a technician, the new Titan needs refinement and will not fill an immediate starting need.</p>

<p>Two things help soften the lack of impact: a clear path to Jadeveon Clowney and a cornerback class that has depth well into Draft Days 2 and 3.</p>
<p>“Right there, kind of at the end (of the first round), there was a little bit of a run (on corners),” said Robinson. “We were watching that, but we feel like there’s still some players at that position group. We’ll see how long they last tomorrow and the rest of the weekend. Again, I think the depth of that position group is pretty good for the next two days. But our board, it came off kind of how we had it stacked, if you will, with the players that were selected tonight.”</p>
<p>Robinson might as well have started chomping on a cigar like Colonel John “Hannibal” Smith and told us how much he loves when a plan comes together.</p>
<p>Needs at corner and edge still exist. Tennessee would do well to secure both sooner rather than later. The greatest requirement for Robinson and Vrabel in this Draft, however, was to substantially improve the team’s depth. Wilson’s presence gives them about as high quality an alternative as possible and, potentially, an upgrade.</p>
<p>Acquiring a defensive back (or two), a supplemental running back for Henry and someone to give Clowney a damn physical or a price point reality check are all that stand between the Titans’ most complete squad of the Robinson era.</p>

<p><img src="https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2019/09/05/94eb48b3-b1b4-42fd-9dfc-6abd1d4baf99/thumbnail/1200x675/70c3533156b34b99c9ce5b5d526ec0ca/isaiah-wilson.jpg" alt="img">
The Titans selected Georgia offensive lineman Isaiah Wilson with the No. 29 overall pick in the first round of the 2020 NFL Draft. The CBS Sports NFL Draft team breaks down the pick below, including a grade for the pick, how it affects fantasy leagues and more on Wilson, including his strengths and weaknesses, his NFL comp and more.</p>
<ol start="29">
<li>Tennessee Titans: B+</li>
</ol>
<p>Pete Prisco: I think this is a good pick. This is a massive right tackle on a team that needs a massive right tackle. This kid is a mauler in the run game and he&rsquo;s perfect for what the Titans want to do.</p>
<p>Fantasy impact</p>
<p>Dave Richard: I get the pick by the Titans &ndash; Isaiah Wilson fills a need at right tackle. He&rsquo;s a good run blocker with massive size. It&rsquo;s a great pick for Derrick Henry&rsquo;s stock. Enough to take him in the top five overall? No. But still a good pick.</p>
<p>NFL Draft profile</p>
<p>NFL comp: La&rsquo;el Collins</p>
<p>Best trait: Size, length, brute strength</p>
<p>College Height Weight Hand size Arm length Wingspan Georgia 6-6 4/8 350 10 2/8 35 4/8 84 3/8</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>Gigantic but moves like he&rsquo;s much smaller</p>
<p>Effective on combo blocks</p>
<p>Strong anchor</p>
<p>Enough athleticism to recover if initially beaten</p>
<p>Brute strength in pass protection and for run game</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>Not always on time with his punches</p>
<p>Some speed-to-power rushers can get underneath him and drive him back</p>
<p>Speed rushers will give him some problems around the corner</p>

Brett Carlsen/Associated Press</p>
<p>STRENGTHS</p>
<p>—Mammoth prospect at 6&rsquo;6&rdquo;, 350 pounds with 35 ½&rdquo; arm length.</p>
<p>—Dominated in the run game at Georgia as a two-year starter.</p>
<p>—Young prospect who left after his redshirt sophomore year and showed continual improvement during his two years starting.</p>
<p>—Hits like a boxer when edge-rushers try to come around the corner on him; excellent length and power make his long arm hard to beat.</p>
<p>—Hands are big and strong; if he gets his hands on you, it&rsquo;s lights out.</p>
<p>—Has the power to sit down and absorb bull rushes.</p>

B/R Fantasy Expert Matt Camp Gives His Picks for Keep or Release After Week 2 Does Hines Ward Deserve Your 2019 Pro Football Hall of Fame Vote? Right Arrow Icon</p>
<p>WEAKNESSES</p>
<p>—He&rsquo;s not overly quick, flexible or agile in space.</p>
<p>—Plays with a tall, straight-leg pass set that defenders can get leverage under.</p>
<p>—Hard for him to move off his path, which opens the door to counters from dynamic pass-rushers.</p>
<p>—Surrounded by a lot of talent at Georgia that helped him cover up mistakes and often kept the best pass-rusher from going head-to-head with him.</p>
<p>OVERALL</p>
<p>Wilson is a polished but raw prospect, which might sound like an oxymoron but is true in his case. He&rsquo;s ready to play right tackle in the NFL right now, but he has developmental potential to continue better learning how to use his traits and gifts. A Day 1 starter at right tackle is expected with Pro Bowl potential in his future.</p>
<p>GRADE: 87</p>
<p>PRO COMPARISON: Orlando Brown Jr./Cody Ford
