When I traveled in Europe, specifically England, Germany, France and the Netherlands, I noticed an intense difference in the way dogs were treated and integrated into society compared to the United States. Quite simply, dogs were everywhere: restaurants and buses and performance venues and countless other places.</p>
<p>This is obviously not the case in the United States, and it got me wondering why European dogs and American dogs behave so differently. In Europe dogs tend to be welcome in most public spaces and they are calm, relaxed and quiet there. In the United States, however, pet dogs aren’t welcome in most public spaces, and often struggle in the public places where they are allowed. Dogs are dogs no matter where they are born, and the differences in behavior often come down to an individual dog’s temperament as well as socialization and training received as a puppy.</p>
<p>But dog behavior isn’t all about the dogs. A lot of it has to do with us. As big as the differences might be between the behavior of American dogs and European dogs, there are even bigger differences in how Americans relate to dogs we encounter in public. Our behavior has a lot to do with why our dogs might have more behavioral challenges, and the good news is there’s something we can do about it.</p>
<p>Give your dog some space</p>
<p>One small thing that we can do that will have a big impact on our dogs is to admire them from a distance instead of getting in their face.

Just like humans, dogs have a lot of personality. Each breed — there are more than 300 of them — exhibits a combination of traits, like playful or energetic or sensitive. And with a growing number of dedicated doggo-clothing brands, why not dress a dog by its personality?</p>
<p>That’s what we did with these nine dogs. For the March issue of The New York Times for Kids, in your paper this Sunday, March 29 (and the last Sunday of every month), we talked to their owners and used descriptions from the American Kennel Club to figure out their temperaments. Then we brought them to a studio in Brooklyn and asked a stylist to dress each one in the best of canine fashion according to their inner doggies.</p>
<p>While The New York Times for Kids is normally only found in the print edition, we decided to share this article here because we all need a little fun right now.

<h3 id="second-dog-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-as-owners-warned-not-to-abandon-pets">Second dog tests positive for coronavirus as owners warned not to abandon pets</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/images/MW-IC682_dogzer_ZG_20200320061556.jpg" alt="img">
The Hong Kong government has urged people not to abandon their pets and to stop kissing them after a second dog tested positive for coronavirus, but stressed that the animal had not shown any symptoms of the disease.</p>
<p>A German shepherd living in the Pok Fu Lam area on Hong Kong Island was sent for quarantine along with another mixed-breed dog from the same residence on Thursday after their owner was confirmed as being infected, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said in a statement.</p>
<p>Though the shepherd tested positive for the virus, no such result was obtained from the mixed-breed dog, and “neither dog has shown any signs of disease,” the AFCD said, adding it will continue to monitor both dogs and conduct repeated tests on the animals.</p>
<p>The new case comes after an elderly 17-year-old Pomeranian, which had tested “weak positive” during repeated tests for the virus, died two days after it was released from quarantine disease-free. The AFCD said the dog’s owner wasn’t willing to allow an autopsy to determine the cause of death.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong animal-welfare authority stressed that there is currently no evidence that pets can be a source of the virus or that they can get sick from it. “Under no circumstances should [owners] abandon their pets,” it said.</p>
<p>The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) said that infectious disease experts and multiple international and domestic human and animal health organizations, all agree there is no evidence at this point to indicate that pets become ill with Covid-19 or that they spread it to other animals, including people.</p>
<p>These include the Paris-based World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the U.S.’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which have also both stated that there is no evidence that companion animals such as cats and dogs can spread the virus. “Therefore, there is no justification in taking measures against companion animals which may compromise their welfare,” the OIE said.</p>
<p>However the AVMA said that “out of an abundance of caution, it is recommended that those ill with Covid-19 “limit contact” with animals until more information is known about the virus. The AFCD also reminded pet owners to use good hygiene practices and urged them to avoid kissing their pets.</p>
<p>Some animal-welfare experts have suggested the Pomeranian’s death could have been caused by the stress of being quarantined and separated from its owner, while others have noted its age. “The dog likely died from causes other than Covid-19 as it had never displayed any clinical signs of illness,” The College for Veterinary Medicine at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign said in a post on its website.</p>
<p>Vet diagnostic company IDEXX IDXX, +0.59% said thousands of dogs and cats have been tested for Covid-19, and so far, none have tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>“Our pets can be a source of comfort for us, and not another source of concern, during this evolving Covid-19 environment,” said Dr. Jim Blacka, a veterinarian with IDEXX’s Companion Animal Commercial Business. “Data from IDEXX shows no cases to date of the novel coronavirus in thousands of dog and cat samples tested, which is good news for pets and the people who care for them,” he added.</p>
<p>The AFCD said it “strongly advises” that mammalian pet animals including dogs and cats from households with persons infected with Covid-19 or those who have had close contacted with others infected with the virus, should be quarantined in government facilities.
