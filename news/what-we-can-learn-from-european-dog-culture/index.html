When I traveled in Europe, specifically England, Germany, France and the Netherlands, I noticed an intense difference in the way dogs were treated and integrated into society compared to the United States. Quite simply, dogs were everywhere: restaurants and buses and performance venues and countless other places.</p>
<p>This is obviously not the case in the United States, and it got me wondering why European dogs and American dogs behave so differently. In Europe dogs tend to be welcome in most public spaces and they are calm, relaxed and quiet there. In the United States, however, pet dogs aren’t welcome in most public spaces, and often struggle in the public places where they are allowed. Dogs are dogs no matter where they are born, and the differences in behavior often come down to an individual dog’s temperament as well as socialization and training received as a puppy.</p>
<p>But dog behavior isn’t all about the dogs. A lot of it has to do with us. As big as the differences might be between the behavior of American dogs and European dogs, there are even bigger differences in how Americans relate to dogs we encounter in public. Our behavior has a lot to do with why our dogs might have more behavioral challenges, and the good news is there’s something we can do about it.</p>
<p>Give your dog some space</p>
<p>One small thing that we can do that will have a big impact on our dogs is to admire them from a distance instead of getting in their face.

<h3 id="dogs-at-least-love-coronavirus-quarantine---the-new-york-times">Dogs, at Least, Love Coronavirus Quarantine - The New York Times</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/27/opinion/27horowitz/27horowitz-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
Next to me on the couch, one of my dogs twitches his feet and curls his lower lip in his sleep. His tail thumps on a soft pillow. An “urph” — maybe a stifled bark — escapes his mouth and he wakes himself up, looking at me accusingly. “That was you!” I tell him.</p>
<p>As a writer and dog-cognition researcher, I can — and do — spend the greatest part of the day observing dogs, talking to dogs and hanging out beside my dog while working. And now, in this extraordinary time, many more of us find ourselves working at home with our dogs full time. Good for us — and great for the dogs.</p>
<p>Quarantine, and even social distancing, is meant to impose an isolation that most of us, as a highly social species, work hard throughout our lives to avoid. Even the most introverted of us need company — some touchstone of a shared existence through time. In reflecting on our changed society, the isolation of the elderly and the sick seems especially cruel. In many places, older residents quarantined in nursing homes cannot have visitors, and are suffering not just from potentially fatal infections but also from the loss of the company of their family members and the comfort of their presence and touch — a biological urge.</p>
<p>Our drive to keep animals, dogs in particular, strikes me as similar in nature: Their simple presence, and their willingness to be touched, is viscerally satisfying. Time spent reading on the couch is massively improved by a dog’s head resting on my leg; a warm, snuffling muzzle directed at me is instantly calming. Social media abounds with images of dogs (some bemused, some wagging their tails so hard as to sprain them) alongside their isolated persons: Dogs are now our proxy for other humans.

<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/26/magazine/26kids-dog/26kids-dog-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
Just like humans, dogs have a lot of personality. Each breed — there are more than 300 of them — exhibits a combination of traits, like playful or energetic or sensitive. And with a growing number of dedicated doggo-clothing brands, why not dress a dog by its personality?</p>
<p>That’s what we did with these nine dogs. For the March issue of The New York Times for Kids, in your paper this Sunday, March 29 (and the last Sunday of every month), we talked to their owners and used descriptions from the American Kennel Club to figure out their temperaments. Then we brought them to a studio in Brooklyn and asked a stylist to dress each one in the best of canine fashion according to their inner doggies.</p>
<p>While The New York Times for Kids is normally only found in the print edition, we decided to share this article here because we all need a little fun right now.
