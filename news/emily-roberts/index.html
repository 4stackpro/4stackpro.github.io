<p>Craft supplies, artwork and toys have an important place this summer in teacher Emily Roberts&rsquo; home office in Centertown — and she&rsquo;s picked up an office mate.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Jefferson City School District teacher cut shapes out of green and pink construction paper and glued them together to make lily pads with pink flowers. As she did so, she explained the steps and encouraged her second-grade summer school students through a video chat as they followed along.</p>
<p>Roberts&rsquo; fifth-grade daughter, Ava, sat next to her and completed her own summer school activities on her Chromebook.</p>
<p>Summer school this year began June 3, and it will end June 30. JC Schools is using Launch, a virtual learning program based in Springfield Public Schools that partners with school districts statewide to offer students access to the program.</p>
<p>All Launch partner districts are charged a one-time joining fee based on K-12 size, according to the Launch website. JC Schools paid $300 per course. As of May 20, students were enrolled in 2,485 courses at a total expense of $745,500, JC Schools Communications Director Ryan Burns said. There has been some fluctuation in enrollment, so the amount could change.</p>
<p>The courses are aligned to Missouri Learning Standards and created by Springfield Public Schools curriculum specialists, teachers and digital developers.</p>
<p>For teachers, students and parents, it&rsquo;s a whole new experience.</p>
<p>Roberts&rsquo; students smiled and proudly showed off their completed lily pads, a project tied to the elementary summer school &ldquo;national park adventure&rdquo; themed curriculum. This week&rsquo;s national park was the Everglades, so Roberts screen-shared a video of lily pads and crocodiles at the Everglades for her students to view before they created their own lily pads.</p>
<p>Launch&rsquo;s elementary school curriculum includes several reading, writing, math, art and P.E. activities each day from which students can choose. Other subjects, such as science and social studies, are built within these subjects.</p>
<p>For example, one assignment included a map of Yellowstone Lake and Old Faithful and asked questions such as &ldquo;Is Old Faithful north, east, south or west of Yellowstone Lake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The students can watch videos and read virtual books about national parks and wildlife, and then complete activities that complement what they learned, such as wildlife-themed matching games or vocabulary assignments. The art activities include craft tutorials tied to the curriculum, and the P.E. activities include video tutorials such as yoga and dance while teaching students about health and science.</p>
<p>Students can complete the assignments at any time, allowing them to work at their own pace. The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education requires that six hours worth of assignments are offered to students. However, students do not have a time requirement. Roberts&rsquo; daughter and her students typically spend about two or three hours on schoolwork each day, she said.</p>
<p>Teachers are required to be available for at least three hours a day to answer parents&rsquo; and students&rsquo; questions. Roberts said she typically works from 8:30 a.m.-3:30 p.m. with breaks in between.</p>
<p>Roberts holds a virtual class meeting every day where they do crafts or take turns sharing something, such as the crafts they made before the meeting or which animal from the national park was their favorite.</p>
<p>She has 25 students in her class, but only about eight show up to the meetings. Some of the students&rsquo; parents work all day, so the students complete their work in the evening. Roberts has talked to other teachers — elementary, middle and high school — who said this is the case for their classes, too.</p>
<p>Six of Roberts&rsquo; students have not logged in at all — mostly students whose parents work full time outside of the home, she said. One of the parents has not responded, and the others said they&rsquo;ve been busy.</p>
<p>Roberts&rsquo; class is made up of students in four schools in the Jefferson City School District. Launch tries to put students and teachers in the same district together, but some students in other classes have teachers and classmates in different districts.</p>
<p>Although Launch is easier to navigate than the virtual learning programs they were using during the spring, it took some time for parents and children to get used to the switch, Roberts said.</p>
<p>While they&rsquo;re not in Roberts&rsquo; class, one Jefferson City parent and her children have experienced several challenges.</p>
<p>Jessica Green&rsquo;s second-grade daughter, Londyn, was accidentally registered to two teachers&rsquo; classes, and assignments haven&rsquo;t shown up for her, Green said. She&rsquo;s been completing assignments on iReady instead, a program the district used during the spring semester that is available to students through June 30.</p>
<p>There have been some general difficulties with the program: Springfield Public Schools didn&rsquo;t send paper workbooks needed to complete some of the assignments until about a week after summer school started, and the log-in information, which includes the website, user-name and password, went to almost everybody&rsquo;s junk email folder, causing many families to not see it.</p>
<p>Green didn&rsquo;t see the log-in information until the night of the first day of summer school, so her children missed out on the first day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think there wasn&rsquo;t a chance maybe for things to be tested to make sure they were working correctly prior to actually launching the summer school,&rdquo; Green said.</p>
<p>Things began to run more smoothly once they were able to video chat with their teachers and classmates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was nice to be able to see a couple of other classmates, and the teachers are really good about communicating with you via text, email or just by phone in general — they are very much available to offer their assistance when they can,&rdquo; Green said.</p>
<p>iReady is more challenging than Launch, Green said, because the questions are based on each student&rsquo;s individual skill level. While the Launch curriculum is fun, she said she hopes it&rsquo;ll get more challenging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The national park theme is great, but I don&rsquo;t really know if she&rsquo;s actually learning or if it&rsquo;s more of just kind of here for a little bit of fun,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Green&rsquo;s children have been independent with their work for summer school and during the spring semester. On Thursday, Green helped them log in, and they sat at their coffee table, practicing basic math and watching a video about Yellowstone National Park, eyes glued to their screens. Green worked from home alongside them, listening to a conference call in her pajamas.</p>
<p>During the spring semester, Green&rsquo;s children were completing paper packets and iReady lessons. Since online learning is more stimulating and interactive, her children prefer it to the paper packets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Launch program gets them more into the technical side of things and gets them used to utilizing technology for their learning,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They prefer to be using the Launch program because it&rsquo;s computer-based. When they do the packets, my kids get kind of bored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first couple days of summer school, parents and students had trouble learning how to use the program, so Roberts used Launch&rsquo;s screen-sharing option to teach them. Now, students can easily navigate the program themselves without help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have some parents send me pictures of the kids laying in their bed at night with their Chromebooks, working away, and they&rsquo;re like, &lsquo;We just never thought we&rsquo;d see them do this and here they are loving it and working through it. We don&rsquo;t have to help them.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>The screen-sharing option also makes it easier to teach students than the programs used during the spring semester, Roberts said.</p>
<p>During the spring semester, teachers and students were using multiple separate platforms such as Google Meet, Google Classroom and iReady. With Launch, the courses are built in a learning management system called Canvas where each app is built into the program, making it easier to navigate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Canvas is just a really wonderful learning management system that&rsquo;s kind of set up for success for students,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Everything is kind of utilized through this one educational platform, and it just makes it so easy for students to understand, and they know exactly what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ava hasn&rsquo;t needed any help using Launch — a different experience from the spring semester, where she asked Roberts many questions about how to use the programs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s just really loving it,&rdquo; Roberts said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s engaging with her class, and she really likes the work. It&rsquo;s very fun and exciting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roberts, who has a specialist degree in online education and develops online courses for Lincoln University, said she believes the closure during the spring semester made many school districts realize they needed a better online learning method like Launch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought we had something good going with all the Google things we use, but you don&rsquo;t realize until you&rsquo;re forced to realize that you&rsquo;re not prepared to support students online — and who knows what the fall is going to look like?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We need to make sure we are able to support students and parents online way better than we did during the closure.&rdquo;

<h3 id="lockdown-history-project-reporter-emily-roberts-shares-her-experience-of-the-last-few-months">&ldquo;Lockdown History Project: Reporter Emily Roberts shares her experience of the last few months&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.basingstokegazette.co.uk/resources/images/11438892/" alt="img">
WE WERE meant to be in Cyprus, but our flights had been cancelled, so we were on the Isle of Wight instead having booked a last-minute break when Boris announced the lockdown measures.</p>
<p>Although I knew it was coming, I was still unprepared for the shock and fear I felt. It had all suddenly become very real.</p>
<p>The holiday was strange, as cafes, restaurants and attractions were beginning to close. But we made the most of it.</p>
<p>Returning from our break we were immediately thrust into our new life at home, with my husband working from the living room table as I entertained our three-year-old son Freddie either in the garden or in the same room my husband was attempting to work. We have no spare space, so this was the only option. It seemed inconceivable initially, but we managed.</p>
<p>At the weekends and evenings, I did what work I still had, although that had dwindled.</p>
<p>The hardest part was trying to explain to Freddie what was happening and why his whole world had changed. He always asks lots of questions, and it was tough to create a balance between telling him enough to satisfy his curiosity and terrifying him. Sometimes I didn’t get it quite right. The second week he said he didn’t want to go out for a walk because of the germs. No amount of reassurance could persuade him otherwise so we spent that day at home.</p>
<p>Some conversations I had with him were heart-breaking. As I put him to bed one evening, he said: “Mummy, when all these germs have gone, can go close to Grandma and Grandad again?”</p>
<p>“Yes darling, of course you can,” I replied.</p>
<p>“When will that be, on Monday?” he asked.</p>
<p>“No, not Monday, we don’t know when, but one day. Hopefully soon,” I responded.</p>
<p>“But I can’t wait any more Mummy, I just can’t wait any more to go close to them.”</p>
<p>Worried that my voice would betray my emotion, I didn’t speak but instead gave him a cuddle in the dark, as tears stung my eyes.</p>
<p>The anxiety and panic I’ve felt during lockdown have been hard to manage at times. On occasion, it’s overwhelming. Initially I thought my husband and I would be fighting over who did the weekly shop, desperate to get out of the house. I was wrong. Trips to the supermarket became stressful as I found myself tense and angry trying to dodge people ignoring social distancing rules. I wanted to scream at them to get out of the way, and returned home feeling harassed. My fear wasn’t related to catching Covid myself, but passing it on to someone vulnerable. I couldn’t bear the thought that someone else might die because I hadn’t been careful enough.</p>
<p>With time, I’ve been able to gain perspective, and I no longer feel anxious and stressed as much. But I still have late night panics that someone I love will catch it and the worst happens.</p>
<p>I’ve also realised with true clarity what is important in my life: human interaction and sharing experiences with people I love.</p>
<p>Singing with my friends in choir; having a family BBQ; watching my nieces and nephews play with Freddie. I don’t think I took this for granted before, but I will definitely have a new appreciation when we are able to do all those things again.</p>
<p>There have been numerous events cancelled that I should have been enjoying - a concert, festival, theatre show, singing performance and - the most disappointing - plans to celebrate my Dad’s 70th birthday.</p>
<p>But my disappointment hasn’t been missing the actual events, it’s seeing the people I would have shared them with.</p>
<p>Sunshine, a weekly zoom quiz with my family, chats with friends and neighbours, online yoga, books and Freddie making me laugh have all lifted my spirits.</p>
<p>We’ve still had fun and made memories together. From making a ‘friend’ for Freddie out of large cardboard boxes and newspapers which he then demanded join us for a walk, to sleeping in a tent in the garden. There are many times I can look back on and smile. But there was often an underlying sadness, a type of grief at missing my normal life and not being able to spend time with those closest to me.</p>
<p>When Boris announced we could go for a walk with another person, my relief that we were over the worst was still tinged with sadness.</p>
<p>Nothing had changed for Freddie, who still couldn’t see his cousins and grandparents. I couldn’t celebrate with him. I couldn’t tell him it was all over, as I long to do.</p>
<p>The same applied to another very close family member who has an underlying health condition. I can’t breathe that sigh of relief and let my shoulders finally relax, until the risk is gone for everyone.

Ich will nichts Festes,</p>
<p>will mich auch nicht binden.</p>
<p>Ich bin nicht verliebt, und ich liebe es .</p>
<p>Einige meiner Freunde haben ja Mitleid mit mir</p>
<p>und bieten mir an:</p>
<p>Hey, wir finden schon einen Mann für dich!</p>
<p>Und ich nur:</p>
<p>Hey, Girls, macht halblang,</p>
<p>ich arbeite hart daran, Single zu bleiben</p>
<p>(das wollt ihr doch nicht kaputt machen).</p>
<p>Ich höre es doch bei den Pärchen,</p>
<p>wie sie sich fetzen und den ganzen Tag anschreien.</p>
<p>Diesen ganzen Scheiß würde ich gerne von mir fernhalten.</p>
<p>Also bitte keine Vorwürfe,</p>
<p>dass ich so erholt aussehen, weil ich gut geschlafen habe.</p>
<p>Rosen sind rot und Veilchen blau</p>
<p>Ich brauche keinen Mann, nein, ich brauch mehrere.</p>
<p>Und ich kann meine Beine ausstrecken,</p>
<p>weil ich alleine im Bett bin.</p>
<p>Und ich werde nicht aufgehalten von irgendeinem Scheiß,</p>
<p>den irgendjemand gesagt hat.</p>
<p>Und ich will auch nicht heiraten,</p>
<p>und schon gar kein Kind.</p>
<p>Hör mir auf mit dem Beziehungsscheiß!</p>
<p>Es gibt so viele Fische im Meer,</p>
<p>da könnte ich Tage lang angeln.</p>
<p>Sowas nenn ich „Synergie“</p>
<p>Und wenn es dann nachlässt, ist es mir auch recht.</p>
<p>Das ist ganz schön hart, so viel Auswahl zu haben.</p>
<p>Oder vielleicht sind diese Speed-Dating-Apps auch nicht genug.</p>
<p>Oh, wahrscheinlich habe ich gerade die Liebe meines Lebens nach links gewischt,</p>
<p>ach herrje &hellip; so ein Pech.</p>
<p>Also geh mir weg mit dem Beziehungsscheiß!</p>
<p>Original Songtext auf Englisch</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna settle, I don&rsquo;t wanna commit</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not in love and I love it</p>
<p>Some friends pity me</p>
<p>They say, &ldquo;Girl we gon&rsquo; find you a man&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I say, &ldquo;Pretty please&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tryna stay single as hard as I can&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cause I hear them fighting and yelling all day</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna keep all of that shit at bay</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t blame me</p>
<p>(For looking well rested after a goodnight&rsquo;s sleep)Roses are red and violets are blue</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need a man, no, I need a few (I need a few)</p>
<p>And I spread my legs &lsquo;cause I&rsquo;m alone in my bed</p>
<p>And I won&rsquo;t be kept up by something that somebody said</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna settle, I don&rsquo;t wanna commit</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want a relationshit</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t wanna settle, I don&rsquo;t wanna commit</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not in love and I love itI don&rsquo;t wanna marry and I don&rsquo;t wanna kid</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want a relationshit</p>

<h3 id="history-center-pivots-to-help-hungry">&ldquo;History Center pivots to help hungry&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.ajc.com/rw/PortalConfig/np-ajc/assets-one/ajc/images/logo-ogimage.png" alt="img">
Fresh-from-the-farm produce is arriving at the doors of some hungry metro Atlantans with help from an unexpected source: the Atlanta History Center.</p>
<p>The center for years has offered school children and other visitors a glimpse into life on a mid-19th-century Georgia farm — down to the cotton, sorghum and other crops in the field.</p>
<p>But since the pandemic, Smith Farm, a historic site on the center’s Buckhead campus, has shifted to producing fresh vegetables to be given to households that lack adequate food.</p>
<p>As of mid-May, about 120 pounds of greens, sweet potatoes, and pumpkins have been delivered by the center to the nonprofit Concrete Jungle for distribution.</p>
<p>Emily Roberts, the history center’s director of urban agriculture, came up with the idea last year and swung into action as the pandemic’s potential became clear and the center closed to the public on March 13.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to come up with a way to contribute,” she said. “Everyone is doing what they can to respond to an increasing number of people who need food and a decrease in the amount of food coming into places like food banks and food pantries.”</p>
<p>Katherine Kennedy, executive director of the Concrete Jungle, said the history center’s donations are a big help. The nonprofit has launched a new home-delivery program for the elderly, chronically ill and others who are in need and sheltering in place.</p>
<p>“We are feeding 270 families a week, so we’re distributing a lot of food,” she said.</p>
<p>Roberts is a great farmer with top-of-the-line growing practices, Kennedy said.</p>
<p>“The food she gives us is clean, perfect, no chemicals,” she said. “It’s really, really amazing stuff.”</p>
<p>Fresh veggies aren’t the only thing the history center is donating to the families Concrete Jungle helps.</p>
<p>To go with the produce deliveries, the center has pitched in nearly 100 packets of okra seeds that Roberts collected from previous harvests. She said she hopes families will use the seeds to start their own vegetable gardens.</p>
<p>Sheffield Hale, CEO of the history center, said the project with the Concrete Jungle fits well with the center’s mission to connect people, history, and culture to make a better city.</p>
<p>“We do a lot of things off our campus, in the community,” Hale said. “This is the first time it’s something consumable and delicious.”</p>
<p>In the past, the vegetables grown at Smith Farm, formerly Smith Family Farm, have primarily been used for cooking demonstrations and other history center events. What wasn’t used was taken to the center’s staff breakroom for sharing.</p>
<p>Roberts said planting continues at Smith Farm and could yield a total of about 500 pounds of fresh vegetables for donation this year.</p>
