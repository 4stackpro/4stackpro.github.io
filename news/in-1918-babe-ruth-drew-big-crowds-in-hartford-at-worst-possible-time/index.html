It would be hard to imagine a bigger story, yet it was buried in the middle of page 7 of The Hartford Courant on Sept. 21, 1918. The headline:</p>
<p>Spanish grip has spread over the city. Estimated that 500 cases are now being treated in Hartford.</p>
<p>“The spread of the disease is regarded as phenomenal by physicians,” the story explained. “It is believed that the first case did not antedate a week ago. In this short time, practically the whole city has been exposed to the contagion.”</p>
<p>More prominently displayed on the first sports page that same day, with pictures:</p>
<p>“Ruth and Fisher in Sunday game.”</p>
<p>The third week of September 1918 was indeed an exciting time for Hartford and its sports fans. The Red Sox had wrapped up a championship season, shortened by The Great War, on Sept. 11 when Babe Ruth defeated the Cubs, 2-1, in Game 6 of the World Series at Fenway Park. And as the pandemic that would kill more Americans than the Civil War was storming through Connecticut, so was Ruth, age 23 and already baseball’s biggest attraction, a man who could not possibly have grasped the concept of social distancing.</p>
<p>The Babe lived to draw crowds, and his postseason tour drew 5,000 fans to the Hartford Baseball Grounds on Sept. 15, and 3,000 more when he returned on Sept. 23.</p>
<p>There is no indication that anyone thought to cancel these games, staged to benefit Hartford’s soldiers fighting in Europe, and Ruth didn’t disappoint.</p>
<p>“It was right in that week of the 15th to the 22nd that the numbers exploded around Boston,” said Skip Desjardin of West Hartford, author of the book, September 1918: War, Plague and the World Series, “so the timing of 500 cases in Hartford by the end of the week matches what was happening next door, making it as the worst possible time to be pressed up against other fans at a ballgame. But who could resist going out to see Ruth?”</p>
<p>The first strain of the deadly influenza, which in those days was also called “the grip,” came through in the spring, and Ruth, that once-in-a-century combo of pitching and hitting prowess, got seriously ill, his fever hitting 104 in May. When a doctor treated his sore throat with too much silver nitrate, his larynx swelled and he nearly died. But he recovered to go 13-7 with a 2.22 ERA and tie for the American League lead with 11 home runs as he transitioned from hurler to slugger and led the Red Sox to the Series, winning two games on the mound.</p>
<p>By autumn, another strain was back in the United States, spreading from the ports – Boston, where Camp Devens was the site of an horrific outbreak, and New London, Connecticut, among them – and the soldiers who were gathering to go overseas.</p>
<p>“As the World Series was played in Boston on Sept. 9-11, by that time, we know what’s going on – it’s spreading,” said Randy Roberts, professor of history at Purdue and coauthor with Johnny Smith of War Fever: Boston, Baseball and America In The Shadow Of The Great War. “And clearly, what is shown by this barnstorming tour is that people weren’t paying attention. We shouldn’t have been in large crowds.”</p>
<p>Barnstorming was a way of life for star players of the era. The only way for many fans to see them was in exhibition games played in places where there were no major league teams. During this trip, Ruth told reporters that Hartford was his favorite city to visit on such tours, and while he may have said that everywhere he went, he did make numerous appearances there between 1918 and 1945.</p>
<p>James H. Clarkin, owner of the Hartford Senators, journeyed to Boston on Sept. 9 as the Red Sox and Cubs were arriving from Chicago to finish the World Series, with designs on getting both teams to go to Hartford and play a series of games, offering a guarantee of $1,000 to each team and a cut of the gate. Because attendance was low – only 15,000 on hand at Fenway to watch Ruth win the deciding game – the players shares were to be reduced and they nearly went on strike to cancel the Series. Ultimately, they played, but the winners share was $1,100 and the idea of making a few more bucks on the side was appealing. Most players were heading into the army. Ruth, his catcher, Sam Agnew, Ray Fisher of the Yankees and a handful of other major leaguers signed on. Money was raised to buy athletic equipment for Hartford’s soldiers overseas, and a ball Ruth hit for a triple during the World Series was auctioned off for $195. Ruth, The Courant reported, received $350 for the game on Sept. 15, and probably the same for his second appearance.</p>
<p>On Sept. 14, three days after the end of the World Series, Ruth agreed to play first base at New Haven’s Lighthouse Grounds for the “Colonials,” and he hit a home run in a loss to a team of all-stars from the Negro Leagues. That night, he arrived in Hartford in a car draped with the American Flag and was ushered into the Hotel Bond, where a large crowd gathered for a reception. Out of character, he went to bed early.</p>
<p>The next day, the game was moved to 4 p.m. to give out-of-town fans time to arrive, and extra trolleys were added to the line. Ruth pitched a shutout against a semipro team from Chicopee, Massachusetts, called the Fisk Red Tops, who had Red Sox pitcher Dutch Leonard on the mound. Ruth pitched a complete game to win 1-0 and narrowly missed the home run everyone came out to see when his long drive hit the top of a Bull Durham sign in center field for a double.</p>
<p>Three days later, Dr. John T. Black of the state’s board of health warned that the Spanish Flu was on its way to Connecticut, and declared, “it’s the patriotic duty of anyone taken with the disease to isolate himself or herself. Public gatherings held indoors should be avoided.”</p>
<p>On Sept. 20, Hartford reported 13 cases of the Spanish Flu. “None are considered serious,” The Courant reported, “and all were probably due to contagion from the soldiers from Camp Devens (in Boston) who were in the city a week ago. … Local doctors fear it will spread as it has done in other cities.” The state was also being overspread by the outbreak that began in New London.</p>
<p>“We weren’t sure how you caught the thing,” Roberts said. “It was addressed differently in different cities. There was no national standard.”</p>
<p>By Sept. 21, there were 500 cases in Hartford.</p>
<p>“Theaters and public meeting places are particularly places of danger at the present time,” The Courant reported that morning. “Wherever people are crowded together, as in the trolley cars and similar places, all are likely to be exposed and a large percentage of cases will result. It may even be necessary to close the theaters and other amusement places if the epidemic grows as it has in the past few days.”</p>
<p>Ruth and the major leaguers in his traveling troupe played in Springfield, Massachusetts, then returned to Hartford on Sept. 22. Roughly 3,000 came, many presumably having jammed the trolley cars to get out to the ballpark in the South End, to see the doubleheader. A fence was opened allowing children to surge into the park and crowd the outfield.</p>
<p>Another Red Sox star, “Bullet Joe” Bush, pitched for one team and Ruth pitched for the other. Bush won, 1-0. Shortstop Larry Kopf of New Britain, who was playing for Cincinnati in the majors, played in the first game, but sat out the second game. “He had taken ill with what he thought was the Spanish influenza,” according to The Courant.</p>
<p>“Certainly there were people at the game who’d already been infected,” Desjardin said, “either by having been themselves or in contact with someone who’d been in the thick of things in Massachusetts. Or New London. … People in Hartford likely didn’t yet know enough to avoid crowds.”</p>
<p>Ruth satisfied the nation’s “work or fight” order by accepting a position at Bethlehem Steel in Pennsylvania, though his primary role was to play for the company team. He played one game Sept. 25, two days after his appearance at Hartford, then left. The Baltimore Sun reported he had again contracted the Spanish Flu, but recovered.</p>
<p>The worst for Connecticut came in the coming weeks. According to Connecticuthistory.org, local officials finally began canceling public events, such as fairs and football games, churches, schools and war bond drives, urged the wearing of cotton muslin masks in October, but more than 5,000 flu-related deaths were recorded in the state that month. Eventually, the pandemic would claim 9,000 lives, or one percent of the state’s population. There were 675,000 deaths in the United States.</p>

<h3 id="today-in-baseball-history-hank-aaron-breaks-babe-ruths-home-run-record---hardballtalk">Today in Baseball History: Hank Aaron breaks Babe Ruth&rsquo;s home run record - HardballTalk</h3>
<p><img src="https://mlb.nbcsports.com/wp-content/themes/nbcsports-2015/favicon.ico" alt="img">
This is one of those entries that doesn’t require a bunch of explanatory background. If you’re reading this site you like baseball and if you have an even passing acquaintance with baseball history you know that on April 8, 1974, Hank Aaron hit his 715th career home run, passing Babe Ruth, who had led in that category since he laid down his bat for good early in the 1935 season. UPDATE: I had that wrong. As reader Richard Mann reminds us, “Actually, Ruth’s mark of 714 had stood since 1935, but he’d held the MLB record since 1921, when he passed Roger Connor’s record of 138.”</p>
<p>You probably also know how stressful and harrowing it was for Aaron in the months and years before he passed Ruth.</p>
<p>Aaron received around a million pieces of correspondence in the early to mid 70s, and a great many of them were filled with threats, hate, and racism from people who did not want to see a black ballplayer break baseball’s most notable record. A few years ago Emory University presented an exhibit of many of those letters entitled “He Had a Hammer: The Legacy of Hank Aaron in Baseball and American Culture,” and the examples presented were odious. To this day, Aaron will remind you of that side of American culture, and will remind you that it still exists, even if a lot of us want to pretend it’s ancient history.</p>
<p>Separate and apart from all of that, Aaron’s approach to Ruth’s record was surrounded by controversy.</p>
<p>Aaron had finished the 1973 season with 713 homers, one shy of The Bambino. The Braves were scheduled to begin the 1974 season on the road in Cincinnati and, as the season approached, the team announced that they would not play Aaron in that series so that he would not tie or break the record until the Braves’ could get back to Atlanta. The media took issue with it and, as was so often the case, Commissioner Bowie Kuhn followed what the media told him he should do and told the Braves that he expected Aaron to play at least two of the three games in Cincinnati. Aaron hit a homer in his first at bat on Opening Day at Riverfront Stadium. He had tied Ruth.</p>
<p>Braves manager Eddie Matthews decided to keep his former teammate out of the lineup for the second game of the season. Kuhn, worried that he might sit on Sunday too, called Mathews and gave him a direct order to start Aaron in Sunday’s game or face “serious penalties.” Which, my God, could you imagine Rob Manfred doing that today? The press would probably eat him alive. In the event, it didn’t matter: Aaron struck out twice and grounded out on Sunday and the Braves headed home to Atlanta.</p>
<p>On April 8, 53,775 people filled Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. One person who was not there: Bowie Kuhn who, according to the New York Times, “had a previous commitment in Cleveland.” My God, Kuhn was the worst. The Commissioner’s absence notwithstanding, it was the largest crowd in the stadium’s short history at that point.</p>
<p>In the fourth inning Al Downing of the Los Angeles Dodgers served one up and, for the 715th time in his career, Aaron smacked it out. Vin Scully has the call:</p>
<p>I’ll never not be shocked to see those two fans greet Aaron as he rounded second base at the 45-second mark. If that happened today they’d be tackled and tased before they got into fair territory. Even then, given all of the death threats Aaron had received — including one that said he’d be shot between the eyes before he crossed home plate if he got to 715 — it had to be a jarring and frightening sight. Nevertheless, talking about it ten years ago, Aaron cast it as kids being kids. Which it basically was. The two fans were 17 year-olds Britt Gaston and Cliff Courtenay. They were both arrested while trying to leave the field but were released a few hours later when one of their fathers bailed them out. The trespassing charges were dropped the next day.</p>
<p>You know the rest, of course. Aaron would finish the season in Atlanta, go back to Milwaukee for two seasons as the Brewers’ DH and end his career with 755 home runs. That record would stand until 2007 when Barry Bonds passed it. Controversially, of course, but we’ll leave that for another day. Aaron has spent decades in the Braves’ front office and, as a close friend of Bud Selig’s going back to the days when Selig was a minority owner of the Braves in the early 60s, he has often been called on for counsel and advice by Major League Baseball.</p>
<p>The only thing that stinks even a little bit about Aaron’s career and legacy: people probably focus on the home runs too much. Yes, he broke Ruth’s record and yes that homer he hit 46 years ago today was easily the most famous moment of his career, but in some ways it has served as a distorting factor, causing some to think fo Aaron as just a great power hitter when, in fact, he was so much more.</p>
<p>As Joe Posnanski wrote for this site back in 2014, “Henry Aaron’s singular achievement is that he was great EVERY SINGLE YEAR from 1955 to 1973. That’s 19 consecutive seasons without anything resembling a down season . . . In those 19 seasons, Aaron created 100 runs or more run 18 times. Nobody else in baseball history had 100 runs created 18 times in a career.” Aaron is also the all-time leader in total bases with 6,856, which is 700 more than second-place Stan Musial. It’s a record that will likely never be broken. Mike Trout could perfectly replicate his first nine seasons starting now and he’d still be over 1,800 total bases shy of Aaron’s career mark. Aaron hit for average. He hit for power. He got on base. He did it all. He was the Home Run King, yes, but he is also one of the few players whose inclusion on a very short list of “the greatest players of all time” could not be argued.</p>
<p>But sure, the homers were nice too.</p>
<p>Also today in baseball history:</p>
<p>1969: Expansion teams the Kansas City Royals, the Montreal Expos, the San Diego Padres, and the Seattle Pilots all make their regular season debuts and all win.</p>
<p>1975 – Frank Robinson makes his debut as the Cleveland Indians player-manager. He’s baseball’s first black manager. He wins the game, in part, because he penciled himself in as DH that day and homered in his first at bat.</p>
<p>1987 – The Dodgers fire long time team vice-president Al Campanis two days after he appeared on ABC “Nightline” news show and said that blacks “may lack some of the necessities” to be a field manager or general manager in major league baseball.</p>
<p>1989 – Jim Abbott, a pitcher who was born without a right hand, makes his major league debut for the California Angels. He will finish the season 12-12 with a 3.92 ERA and go on to pitch for ten seasons in the bigs for the Angels, Yankees, White Sox, and Brewers. He hrew a no-hitter against the Cleveland Indians in 1993.</p>
