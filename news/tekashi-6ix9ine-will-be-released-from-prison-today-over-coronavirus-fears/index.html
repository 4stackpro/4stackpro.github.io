Tekashi 6ix9ine will not be serving the rest of his prison sentence behind bars after requesting to be released to home to avoid contracting coronavirus because he is classed as a &lsquo;vulnerable&rsquo; inmate.</p>
<p>Tekashi - real name Daniel Hernandez - is currently serving a 24-month sentence after pleading guilty to nine charges including conspiracy to murder and armed robbery. As he had already served 13 months of his two-year sentence in a jail, he was due to be released from an upstate New York prison in August 2020.</p>
<p>However it now looks likely a judge will accept an appeal to get him out of a penitentiary as COVID-19 confirmed cases surpassed 84,000 in New York and deaths 2,220.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It’s a foregone conclusion, he’s getting released,&rsquo; attorney, Dawn Florio, said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The rapper - real name Daniel Hernandez - was due to be released from an upstate New York prison in August 2020 but is expected to be released four months early on Thursday</p>
<p>Tekashi&rsquo;s attorney wrote a letter to the courts on Sunday night, explaining why the Gummo rapper was at a high risk for contracting coronavirus.</p>
<p>He disclosed that 6ix9ine had been diagnosed with bronchitis and sinusitis late last year and had been hospitalized to treat both ailments.</p>
<p>Additionally, attorney Lance Lazzaro said that Hernandez had been experiencing shortness of breath and was not being allowed to see a doctor by prison officials.</p>
<p>Tekashi is currently serving a 24-month sentence after pleading guilty to nine charges included to conspiracy to murder and armed robbery</p>
<p>Judge Paul Englemeyer said he lacked the legal authority to make such a decision. But the judge suggested Hernandez and his legal team reach out to the Bureau Of Prisons directly.</p>
<p>The judge said if he had known Tekashi - who suffers from asthma - had health issues and to expect a worldwide pandemic, the court would have let him serve his final four months at home.</p>
<p>However in an email the BOP stated they did &lsquo;not have any authority or oversight of his case as he is not in a BOP facility&rsquo;. &lsquo;If the Court orders a compassionate release for him, that information will be provided to the US Marshals Service and the GEO facility for processing,&rsquo; the email read.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He could do it today, or later, we’re just waiting on the judge’s decision,&rsquo; Florio continued to Rolling Stone Wednesday.</p>
<p>Englemeyer gave prosecutors until 5pm Wednesday to make a case for why the musician should stay in prison. United States Attorney Geoffrey Berman replied: &lsquo;The Government does not oppose the defendant’s motion for compassionate release.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Based on what [Engelmayer] wrote this morning, it seems likely he’s going to grant it,&rsquo; Lazzaro added. &lsquo;I believe the judge will, at some point, approve my motion for compassionate release. I don’t want to put words into the judge’s mouth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Prosecutors have recommended he go free by Thursday due to the coronavirus outbreak that has hit New York State prisons</p>
<p>The rapper is currently incarcerated in New York state, where prisons and jails have become a hotbed for the virus.</p>
<p>Rikers Island has also had its own coronavirus outbreak to deal with.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, 167 inmates and 137 staff members had tested positive for coronavirus.</p>
<p>Rikers Island&rsquo;s chief physician issued a grim warning Tuesday about the coronavirus pandemic, as he advocated for the release of as many &lsquo;vulnerable&rsquo; inmates from the prison as possible.</p>
<p>Chief Physician Ross MacDonald said the current effects of the virus on jails could bring about &lsquo;a crisis of a magnitude no generation living today has ever seen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>MacDonald was responding to a letter made by district attorneys across the city that was directed toward Mayor de Blasio, asserting he was not considering the public&rsquo;s safety when considering some inmate releases.</p>
<p>Cases of the disease at NYC&rsquo;s Rikers Island lead de Blasio to release 300 nonviolent, elderly inmates at high risk of contracting COVID-19.</p>
<p>That move came after a New York City Department of Corrections officer died of the disease.</p>
<p>In the city, 278 people had died by Wednesday and there were 47,439 cases.

<h3 id="6ix9ine-could-be-released-from-prison-any-day-now-amid-coronavirus-worries">6ix9ine Could Be Released From Prison Any Day Now Amid Coronavirus Worries</h3>
<p><img src="https://remezcla.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1021309802.jpg" alt="img">
While hundreds of prisoners are being forced to carry out their sentences in the increasingly unsafe Rikers (along with hundreds of other correctional facilities around the country), it seems as though 6ix9ine could be given the privilege of serving the remainder of his sentence from home. According to XXL, the “Gummo” rapper could be released from prison any day now, as concern about the spread of Coronavirus has changed the judge’s mind about potentially releasing the rapper early.</p>
<p>6ix9ine was recently sentenced to 24 months, and with time-served, was expected to be in prison until August.</p>
<p>People on social media were quick to point out that the internet may soon be subjected to his insufferable online presence.</p>

<h3 id="50-cent-and-jim-jones-exchange-shots-over-6ix9ines-possible-release">50 Cent and Jim Jones Exchange Shots Over 6ix9ine&rsquo;s Possible Release</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/rksm6kvt8ygfbw908ak8/50-cent-jim-jones" alt="img">
50 Cent has reignited another beef.</p>
<p>After it was reported that 6ix9ine could be released from prison as soon as April Fools&rsquo; Day, Fif took to Instagram to take shots at another alleged Nine Trey Blood gang member: Jim Jones.</p>
<p>The hip-hop mogul shared a screenshot of a years-old Instagram Live broadcast that 6ix9ine filmed following his jail release in an unrelated case. 50 captioned the post: &ldquo;Now individual 1 ya gonna have to tell everybody how you were on tape in court on the phone coaching Mel,to super duper violate shorty but the Feds never picked you up and the charges were Rico &amp; conspiracy Confidential informant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As you can see, 50 never mentioned Jones by name, but the &ldquo;indivdiual 1&rdquo; title is an obvious reference to the &ldquo;We Fly High&rdquo; rapper. In 2018, TMZ released a transcript of a conversation between 6ix9ine&rsquo;s former manager Kifano &ldquo;Shotti&rdquo; Jordan, Mel Murda, and an unidentified person who many believed was Jones. During the eventual trial, it was ultimately confirmed that it was indeed Jones on the other end of the call. According to the transcript, the three blasted 6ix9ine for trying to distance himself from Tr3way, and suggested they retaliate with violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now he gotta get violated,&rdquo; Jones said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah super violated. Super duper,&rdquo; Mel responded. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t no much he could really do unless he roun around with 100 armed securities all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jones apparently caught wind of 50&rsquo;s comments, and decided to respond with his own Instagram post. And just like Fif, Jones doesn&rsquo;t mention any names, but it&rsquo;s clear who he&rsquo;s referencing when he mentions the &ldquo;so-called real ones&rdquo; (50) and the &ldquo;rats&rdquo; (6ix9ine).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Melly said he doin super fine You have to watch out for these so call real ones thts routing for rats to come home and And wanna see real n<em><strong>as go to jail,&rdquo; Jones captioned the post. &ldquo;Any n</strong></em>a th needs to try n tarnish another mans name for personal gain has to b a hoe why else would he have my dick so far down his throat lol 😂 pause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>50 eventually shot back at Jones, sharing a screenshot of Jones&rsquo; post, with a caption aimed at the rapper. &ldquo;I learn something new everyday,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;See i looked out for this guy when he needed help. I made a call to get him his deal but people forget. being a good judge of character is detrimental to success and people change so you have to watch them. if you stay on point you will peep the change.&rdquo;
