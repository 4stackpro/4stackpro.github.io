In the desperate search for ammunition to fend off the Covid-19 pandemic, a decades-old tuberculosis vaccine, given in huge numbers around the world, is gaining newfound attention.</p>
<p>Researchers in Australia and the Netherlands are testing the idea that the vaccine, known as BCG — short for bacille Calmette-Guérin — could have broad power to boost the immune system against the novel coronavirus. In the United States, a research group in Boston hopes to test the vaccine in frontline health workers for the same purpose.</p>
<p>The interest stems from multiple studies over a number of years that point to the vaccine as having what are known as “off-target” benefits.</p>
<p>advertisement</p>
<p>While the vaccine, used in many low- and middle-income countries, isn’t considered to be highly effective against its primary goal, TB, it seems to help the immune system fend off various pathogens, including one that causes leprosy. The question is whether the virus known as SARS-CoV-2 is among them.</p>
<p>Not everyone is convinced.</p>
<p>advertisement</p>
<p>A leading TB researcher, Madhukar Pai, has warned that the BCG vaccine is unlikely to be the magic bullet some people seem to think it may be. Pai, director of McGill University’s International TB Center, wrote a blog post over the weekend arguing that people may be ascribing almost magical powers to the vaccine.</p>
<p>“I think the idea is 100% worth investigating,” Pai said in an interview with STAT. “That’s why my piece was not against further research. My piece was saying: Right now we’re nowhere close to anything for a policy based on ecological studies that are full of holes.”</p>
<p>The World Health Organization seems to agree. On Sunday it published a scientific brief examining the evidence surrounding BCG. It concludes that there currently is no proof the vaccine protects against the new coronavirus. “In the absence of evidence, WHO does not recommend BCG vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19,” it stated.</p>
<p>Still, some researchers are hopeful.</p>
<p>Denise Faustman, director of immunobiology at Massachusetts General Hospital, has been studying BCG for years as a therapy for type 1 diabetes. She has a stash of the vaccine — which is not used in the United States for tuberculosis prevention — and wants to see if it could benefit frontline health workers. She is seeking institutional permission to quickly mount a trial at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital.</p>
<p>“The goal is to enroll rapidly over a two-month period, about 4,000 high-risk health care workers. And then the goal will be to watch them … to see if we can get a signal,” Faustman said.</p>
<p>The word has gotten around among health workers in Boston. Faustman’s phone is ringing off the hook. “Certainly the people who want in the trial are calling every five minutes [to ask], ‘How do I get in this trial?’” she said. “We have hundreds of phone calls right now of ‘Why can’t I get this?’”</p>
<p>In some respects, the notion of using a vaccine designed to prevent infection with one pathogen to protect people from another, unrelated bug seems counterintuitive. You wouldn’t expect a flu shot to offer any protection against Covid-19, for instance.</p>
<p>But years of research has suggested the immune system boost that BCG confers applies far more broadly than to just Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which causes TB. Children vaccinated with it in low- and middle-income countries around the world have been seen to have lower death rates from other respiratory infections, for instance.</p>

<p>Faustman is enthusiastic about the vaccine, hoping it will be shown to offer protection and could be used as a tool to safeguard critical health workers until a vaccine specifically developed to ward off Covid-19 infection is available. “That’s our goal.”</p>
<p>Pai agrees the study is worth doing. “Is there a signal to do additional research? I think the answer is yes. We’ve known that BCG has these non-specific effects against multiple [diseases],” he said.</p>
<p>But he also argues that proponents of using the vaccine to protect against Covid-19 are wrongly trying to ascribe differing death rates around the globe to a country’s use or non-use of BCG.</p>
<p>Pai and his group at McGill compiled the data everyone is making these inferences from, an online resource called the BCG World Atlas. It lists whether a country uses BCG, when the program was introduced or discontinued, and when it is given, among other things.</p>
<p>A number of studies, most of which have not yet gone through peer review, have suggested lower Covid-19 case numbers or death rates in some countries can be attributed to their use of BCG — drawing from the BCG Atlas.</p>
<p>“Suddenly everybody and their brother has found the atlas and then taken their Covid data from the WHO or from Johns Hopkins University or wherever, overlaid the two and run regression models and [said] ‘Oh, look here. BCG works,’” Pai said.</p>
<p>That kind of approach is flawed, he said, and doesn’t factor in that different outbreaks around the world are at different stages. That’s important because countries that have seen transmission more recently haven’t experienced the explosion of deaths seen in countries like Italy, Spain and the United States. Likewise, many low- and middle-income countries are not testing for Covid-19 in large numbers; their low case and death rates are more likely the result of under-reporting than of the BCG vaccine, Pai said.</p>
<p>The WHO’s statement also challenged the studies attempting to draw conclusions based on countries where BCG had been used. And it, too, pointed out that a run on the vaccine could create real damage. “BCG vaccination prevents severe forms of tuberculosis in children and diversion of local supplies may result in neonates not being vaccinated, resulting in an increase of disease and deaths from tuberculosis,” the global health agency said.</p>
<p>Pai worries that low- and middle-income countries that use BCG may buy into the untested hype around the vaccine and assume their populations have protection that they may not have. Only clinical trials can answer this question, he said.</p>
<p>“It would be dangerous for policymakers to assume protection from BCG and not act,” Pai said in his blog post in Forbes. “Researchers and journalists need to be responsible as well, and not raise false hopes based on weak evidence. And countries should not hoard BCG vaccines for Covid-19, since the BCG supply chain is weak, and really necessary to protect children in [low- and middle-income countries] from childhood TB.”

<h3 id="how-a-100-year-old-vaccine-for-tuberculosis-could-help-fight-the-novel-coronavirus">How a 100-year-old vaccine for tuberculosis could help fight the novel coronavirus</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200409070241-01-bcg-vaccine-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) As researchers scramble to find new drugs and vaccines for Covid-19, a vaccine that is more than a century old has piqued researchers&rsquo; interests. The Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine &ndash; which was first developed to fight off tuberculosis &ndash; is being studied in clinical trials around the world as a way to fight the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis and Covid-19 infection are two very different diseases &ndash; TB is caused by a type of bacteria while Covid-19 is caused by a virus, for starters. But the BCG vaccine might help people build immune responses to things other than TB, causing &ldquo;off-target effects,&rdquo; according to Dr. Denise Faustman, director of immunobiology at Massachusetts General Hospital and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words, in clinical trial format, people started picking up positive benefit from getting the vaccine that had nothing to do with tuberculosis,&rdquo; she said. Faustman has studied how the BCG vaccine affects people with Type 1 diabetes for many years. She is interested in how its off-target effects change the immune system in beneficial ways for people with autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes.</p>
<p>Though the exact mechanism for these off-target effects of the BCG vaccine isn&rsquo;t clear, it&rsquo;s believed that the vaccine can cause a nonspecific boost of the immune response.</p>
<p>There is currently no vaccine or treatments approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the novel coronavirus. While hopeful that the BCG vaccine will prove to be effective against Covid-19 &ndash; as with any of the treatments and vaccines under development &ndash; Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, admits the concept is a bit unconventional.</p>

KYODO NEWS - 6 hours ago - 17:41 | All, World, Coronavirus</p>
<p>A tuberculosis vaccine is drawing global attention as it may be effective in preventing infection with the new coronavirus, but a lack of evidence so far has prompted medical communities and the World Health Organization to advise against its administration.</p>
<p>Two clinical trials are being conducted to gauge the effectiveness of the Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine, which is usually administered to infants, the WHO said, adding it will evaluate the evidence when available.</p>
<p>In a scientific brief released Sunday, the WHO expressed concern that &ldquo;diversion of local supplies may result in neonates not being vaccinated, resulting in an increase of disease and deaths from tuberculosis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Medical groups in Japan, where infants undergo BCG vaccination, have also warned against using the vaccine to prevent adults from contracting the pneumonia-causing virus, with the case of one person who developed side effects reported in the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this point we can neither deny nor affirm (the effectiveness of the BCG vaccine in preventing coronavirus infection), and naturally cannot recommend it,&rdquo; the Japanese Society for Vaccinology said in a statement on April 3, citing the lack of scientific evidence.</p>
<p>The Japanese Society for Turberculosis and Nontuberculous Mycobacteriosis has also warned there can be &ldquo;serious side effects&rdquo; when the BCG live attenuated vaccine is administered to the elderly and people with weak immune systems.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a study by a team of Japanese researchers has shown an inverse correlation between the number of vaccinated people and the number of COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>The team led by neuroscientist Tsuyoshi Miyakawa at Fujita Health University in Aichi Prefecture, central Japan, looked at COVID-19 infection and death rates in 136 countries and regions after dividing them into those where childhood BCG vaccination is required, was required in the past and was never required.</p>
<p>The research found that the number of coronavirus cases and deaths per million people was significantly associated with national BCG vaccination policies.</p>
<p>The prevalence and mortality rate of COVID-19 was highest in countries that never administered the BCG vaccine such as the United States and Italy, followed by countries that used to vaccinate in the past, including Germany and Australia.</p>
<p>Countries such as Japan and Russia that currently administer the vaccine had the lowest rates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The BCG vaccine is believed to strengthen part of the immune system,&rdquo; Miyakawa said. &ldquo;Our study supports the theory that the vaccine may be effective against the novel coronavirus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A medical research institute in Australia announced in late March a plan to start a clinical study of the BCG vaccine&rsquo;s effectiveness with the approval of the WHO, enrolling approximately 4,000 health care workers. The Netherlands and Germany also have similar plans.</p>
<p>In Japan, where infant BCG vaccination is almost universal, some adults are increasingly demanding it for themselves.</p>
<p>Japan BCG Laboratory, which produces and sells the BCG vaccine, said shipments have almost tripled since late March compared with past years. The company has expressed concern, saying in a statement last week that &ldquo;if the situation continues, it will impact the supply for infants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Its concern was shared by the Japan Pediatric Society, which said on April 3 that infants have priority with regard to the vaccine and demand should be evidence-based.</p>
<p>The health ministry has also said an adult developed serious side effects earlier this month including fever, hives and blood in the urine after the BCG vaccine was administered incorrectly.</p>
<p>The vaccine is usually administered as a &ldquo;stamp&rdquo; injection with multiple needles pricking the skin, but there have been cases in which it was injected subcutaneously.</p>
<p>The ministry said it is possible that the doctor &ldquo;did not fully understand&rdquo; how to administer the vaccine.
