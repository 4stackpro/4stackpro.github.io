<p>The rest who resigned are three MLAs from BJP, one from All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) and one Independent.</p>

<p>Subhaschandra, who is among the three BJP MLAs who quit Wednesday, has tendered his resignation from membership of the Manipur Legislative Assembly.</p>
<p>The seven Congress MLAs, who had earlier crossed over to the BJP, are facing anti-defection cases under the Tenth Schedule of Indian Constitution in the Speaker&rsquo;s Tribunal as well as in the High Court of Manipur.</p>
<p>One Congress MLA who joined the BJP-led government was disqualified from the membership of Manipur Legislative Assembly recently reducing the strength of the house to 59. Assembly election in Manipur was held in 2017.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.thewire.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/12163734/maxresdefault_live-800x400.jpg" alt="img">
Imphal: The High Court of Manipur on Monday restrained seven Congress MLAs who defected to the BJP, from entering the Assembly till Speaker Yumnam Khemchand Singh finally disposes of the pending anti-defection cases against them.</p>
<p>These seven lawmakers had helped the formation of the BJP-led government in the state after the Assembly election in 2017, in which the Congress emerged as the single largest party.</p>
<p>Following the high court order, they might not be able to cast their votes in the Rajya Sabha elections that are to be held on June 19.</p>
<p>After hearing the disqualifications against the seven MLAs filed by the leaders of the Congress, the court ordered that they are to be restrained from entering the House.</p>
<p>The court said that the disqualification petitions were filed against them before the Speaker in November 2018 but he did not decide on the matter within a reasonable time.</p>
<p>Earlier in March, the Supreme Court, in a rare move, invoked its plenary powers and ordered forthwith the removal of T.H. Shyamkumar who was the state’s forest minister.</p>
<p>Shyamkumar had also won the election on a Congress ticket but became a minister in the BJP-led government.</p>
<p>The plea of his disqualification was also pending with the Speaker since 2017. Khemchand later disqualified him from the Assembly.

<p><img src="https://nenow.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/manipur_assembly11.jpg" alt="img">
Manipur Assembly Speaker Yumnam Khemchand Singh on Saturday dismissed the objection pleas of seven MLAs.</p>
<p>The speaker fixed June 17 next for further proceedings of the case and fixed June 12 next for the respondents to file comments.</p>
<p>The disqualification of the seven MLAs was sought on the ground that they had switched sides to the BJP even though they had been elected as Congress candidates in the Assembly elections of 2017.</p>
<p>The seven MLAs had filed an objection report on the ground of maintainability of the disqualification case filed against them before the Speaker Tribunal by some Congress MLAs and private parties under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution.</p>
<p>The respondent MLAs had prayed either for rejecting the disqualification petitions as not maintainable since the petitions have not been filed in terms of the provisions of the Members of Manipur Legislative Assembly (disqualification on ground of defection) rules, 1986 or to pass an order as deemed fit in accordance with law.</p>
<p>During the hearing of the case H S Paonam, senior advocate, appearing for the respondents submitted that the disqualification of a member of the Legislative Assembly under the Tenth Schedule is a serious matter.</p>
<p>Hence, the petitions presented before the Tribunal seeking disqualification must strictly comply with the provisions of the Members of Manipur Legislative Assembly (disqualification on ground of defection) Rules, 1986, otherwise the same are liable to be rejected as not maintainable.</p>
<p>The lawyer further stressed the relevant provisions of the Members of Manipur Legislative Assembly (disqualification on ground of defection) Rules, 1986, as contained in Rule 6(5), 6(6) and Rule 7(1), 7(2) and 7(3) and also to the provisions contained under Order VI, Rule 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p>The respondent counsel further contended that the provisions under Rule 6 and Rule 7 of the Members of Manipur Legislative Assembly (Disqualification on Ground of Defection) Rules, 1986 are mandatory and their non-compliance renders the petitions untenable.</p>
<p>As the petitioners rest their case solely on newspaper clippings, undated, uncertified and manufactured letters without source and its authenticity, the same are liable to be dismissed, contended the lawyer further.</p>
<p>Heaving heard counsels of both parties at length the Speaker Tribunal had reserved its order on May 8 with a direction to the petitioners and the respondents to submit written arguments on or before May 16.</p>
<p>Subsequently the written arguments of both the petitioners and respondents were filed on May 16 last.</p>
<p>On perusing the preliminary objections filed by the respondent MLAs, the Speaker Tribunal dismissed the same and asked the respondents to file written replies by June 12 adding that the case will proceed as fixed.</p>
<p>The Speaker Tribunal also held that the petitioners can also file rejoinder to any to the written comment on or before June 16 and posted the matter on June 17 for further proceedings.</p>
<p>It may be mentioned that the seven MLAs – Oinam Lukhoi, Ksh Biren, Paonam Brojen, Sanasam Bira, Ngamthang Haokip, Ginsuanhau Zou and Yengkhom Surchandra – got elected from Congress ticket but defected to BJP after the 2017 Assembly election of Manipur.

<p><img src="https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2020/6/2/w600X390/Struggl1_photo_I.jpg" alt="img">
By Express News Service</p>
<p>NEW DELHI: BJP chief JP Nadda has begun the much-awaited organisational appointments by designating the party unit chiefs in Delhi, Chhattisgarh and Manipur. He is soon likely to unveil the new office bearers, with party circles anticipating the induction of a few new national general secretaries.</p>
<p>Nadda on Tuesday appointed Adesh Kumar Gupta to lead the party’s Delhi unit. The BJP chief has gone back to the party’s traditional strategy to consolidate the trading community in the national capital, with MP Manoj Tiwari having failed to swing the Poorvanchali voters in the Assembly elections.</p>
<p>Gupta had earlier been mayor of the north municipal corporation. With an Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) background, he has the onerous task of putting a new lease of life into the faction-ridden party unit in the city. Incidentally, Nadda also has an ABVP background.</p>
<p>In Chhattisgarh, Nadda has given the responsibility to lead the party’s state unit to former Union Minister Vishnu Deo Sai. He is a tribal leader and is seen as an experienced hand. He replaced Vikram Usendi, who had been holding the post since March last year.</p>
<p>The BJP was routed in the 2018 Assembly elections and since then, the saffron outfit has been experimenting with leadership changes to regain confidence. The BJP chief also appointed S Tikendra Singh as the Manipur unit chief. He replaces Kshetrimayum Bhabananda Singh.</p>
<p>With Nadda yet to constitute the national executive and the national council after his election as the party chief’s post, he is likely to complete the necessary formalities soon, which may see a new national office bearers taking charge under his leadership. There are anticipations that there could be exchange of the resources between the party and the government to allow Nadda to build a new team of the saffron outfit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;35 out of 75 in first year&rsquo;</p>
<p>The government in first year of its second term has initiated tangible action on 35 of 75 points promised in its manifesto for the 2019 LS elections, stated a PPRC report.

Naga People’s Front (NPF) MLA Awangbow Newmai of Tamei assembly constituency was sworn in as a minister in the BJP-led coalition government in Manipur on Friday.</p>

<p>Chief minister N Biren Singh and his cabinet colleagues were present at the oath taking ceremony.</p>

<p>The newly sworn in minister Awangbou whose portfolio is yet to be announced, was elected from Tamei constituency for the second term in the 11th Manipur legislative assembly elections in 2017 on NPF ticket.</p>
<p>He was elected from the same constituency in 2007 assembly elections as an Independent MLA.</p>
<p>52-year-old Awangbow who is a resident of Takou village in Tamei sib-division has master degree in Anthropology from North Eastern Hill University.</p>
<p>He was the president of Naga Students Union, Shillong unit in 1990.</p>

<h3 id="between-letter-and-spirit-of-law">&ldquo;Between letter and spirit of law&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.telegraphindia.com/derivative/THE_TELEGRAPH/1774334/2X1/image60c92a75-6499-44f9-ad2c-12f189899a71.jpg?v=43" alt="img">
A dark and ambiguous shadow has fallen between the letter and the spirit of law in Manipur. On the one hand, the government has been on a spree of silencing dissent in the media under the cover of the Covid-19 emergency, arresting at least five people for remarks on social media deemed critical of it. Much has been written about these arrests, prompting a coalition of nine human rights organizations to jointly appeal to the National Human Rights Commission to intervene. On the other hand, beyond these immediate knee-jerk responses, there has also been a more sustained and systematic crushing of the spirit of law by deliberate misinterpretation.</p>
<p>More than three years after several Congress MLAs defected to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, the case of their disqualification remains unresolved. On May 8, the matter came up again before the tribunal of the Manipur legislative assembly Speaker, Y. Khemchand Singh, but the Speaker reserved his “preliminary observations” ruling that there is more to be heard from both sides. Earlier, on March 28, the Speaker had had to disqualify the first of eight Congress defectors, the former forest minister, Thounaojam Shyamkumar, after the Supreme Court intervened and banned the latter from continuing as minister or entering the premises of the Manipur legislative assembly. The apex court also urged the Speaker to do the needful before the court’s next review of the case on March 30.</p>
<p>Manipur’s assembly elections had yielded a hung verdict, with the Congress emerging as the single largest party with 28 MLAs in the house of 60. The BJP had 21 MLAs. Immediately after the election results were declared, Shyamkumar defected to the BJP. For reasons that were not fully explained, the governor, Najma Heptulla, broke tradition and invited not the party with the most MLAs but the BJP to stake claim to form the next government. The BJP managed to form the government enlisting the support of all non-Congress MLAs, leaving the Congress licking its wounds with 27 MLAs left in its camp. For his help, Shyamkumar was rewarded with a cabinet berth. In the weeks that followed, seven more Congress MLAs followed Shyamkumar’s footsteps and joined the BJP. Unlike Shyamkumar, however, the seven continued to sit in the Opposition benches but voted with the ruling party in assembly motions, including a Rajya Sabha election.</p>
<p>The Congress filed for action, first against Shyamkumar and then against the seven other deserters, under the 10th Schedule. In Shyamkumar’s case too, no tangible action was forthcoming even after the Manipur High Court reprimanded the Speaker, calling his inaction shameful. The Opposition then took the matter to the Supreme Court. In a January ruling, the court prodded the Speaker to dispose of the case. However, three months later, when it became apparent that the Speaker had no intention of heeding the advice, the Supreme Court dropped its bombshell, putting a ban on Shyamkumar using its extraordinary power under Article 142. Is the case of the seven other Congress defectors also headed towards a similar conclusion?</p>
<p>Few have explained this relationship between the letter and the spirit of law better than the mythologist, Devdutt Pattanaik. The author uses the Ramayana and the Mahabharata to illustrate this equation. In the age of innocence and truth that Rama belonged to, it was possible for him to insist on a strict adherence to the letter of the law in the faith that this would guarantee the spirit of the law. By contrast, in the age of experience and lost innocence that the Mahabharata was set in, crafty interpretations of the letter of law often created dichotomy between letter and spirit. Duryodhana is cited as an example. This prince often crushed the spirit of the law by using the letter of the law. After winning Draupadi in a dice game from the Pandava brothers, he decided to exercise his right of possession to humiliate her and his rival cousins by disrobing her in public. Significantly, Krishna is known for similar breaches of the letter of laws, but always to the end of preserving their spirit.</p>
<p>There is also another kind of law-breaker. These are people in power for whom what they say or do becomes law, both in letter and spirit. In Pattanaik’s own analogy, Ravana qualifies to be in this category. In the context of the current imbroglio in Manipur, it would be difficult to decide which of these analogies is the closest.</p>

Biren Singh became chief minister with support from eight dissident Congress MLAs and eight others from the Naga Peoples Front (NPF) and the National Peoples Party (NPP). Biren Singh became chief minister with support from eight dissident Congress MLAs and eight others from the Naga Peoples Front (NPF) and the National Peoples Party (NPP).</p>
<p>When Nongthombam Biren Singh was sworn in as Manipur’s first BJP chief minister on March 15, 2017, the future didn’t exactly look propitious. Biren Singh was a BJP greenhorn, who had defected from the Congress the year before. The 2017 assembly elections had thrown up a hung assembly, with the Congress garnering 28 seats against the BJP’s 21 in a house of 60 seats.</p>
<p>Bucking convention, the governor invited the BJP to form the government. Biren Singh became chief minister with support from eight dissident Congress MLAs and eight others from the Naga Peoples Front (NPF) and the National Peoples Party (NPP). He inherited a state in chaos. The tribal hill areas of the state were in ferment. The abrupt announcement of seven new districts just ahead of the assembly elections had left the administrative machinery in disarray. The nine “tribal martyrs” who died during the protest against three “anti-tribal bills” passed by the Manipur assembly in 2015 remained unburied in Lamka, Churachandpur.</p>
<p>Luckily for Biren Singh, the dysfunction in the state had, by then, induced widespread outrage-fatigue. People longed for a return to normalcy. Expectations were low. Soon the new government struck a deal with the agitating tribal bodies and the “tribal martyrs” were buried. Projecting a new, optimistic face, the government orchestrated grand-looking reception programmes at all district headquarters. Special packages were announced. With the slogan, “go to the hills”, cabinet meetings were held at hill district headquarters. A day was earmarked each month when the chief minister personally attended to the problems of the hill people in his office.</p>
<p>Contrary to the dour and lethargic Ibobi, who had been chief minister for three straight terms till 2017, Biren Singh exudes urgency and action. His social media savvy engenders feelings of proximity with the people. That he was a footballer, a BSF trooper and a journalist before he joined politics make for good optics. The government cracked down on bandhs and highway blockades and restored a semblance of order. The apprehensions relating to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) were subdued since the state government had successfully persuaded the Centre to extend the Inner Line Permit (ILP) regime to Manipur. The anger of the Naga groups regarding the creation of new districts was assuaged by the CM’s regular meetings in hill district headquarters, even without a resolution on the matter.</p>
<p>In his governance style, Biren Singh projects an action-oriented visage combined with the image of a saviour-figure who brooks no dissent or criticism. Major government initiatives carry his personal imprimatur, mirroring the governing style of Narendra Modi-Amit Shah duo at the Centre.</p>
<p>Under the Biren Singh government, people have been hounded for critical comments made on social media. However, there is no visible outrage. Disdain for the rule of law, a crucial feature of authoritarian regimes, has gained ground: Power has started to trump the law.</p>
<p>Biren Singh’s genius, however, lies not in his administrative innovations, most of which are more symbolic than substantive anyway. It lies in mastering the Machiavellian art of augmenting his own power in the face of opposition. His government is a rickety coalition which includes NPF, a party that aspires for Nagalim. There was always opposition from within, with factions led by more senior members of his party lobbying for a leadership change. Yet, he seems to grow stronger with every crisis. His political instincts are most exemplified by his successful co-option of Manipur’s titular king, Leishemba Sanajaoba, the BJP’s nominee for the lone Rajya Sabha seat. Even Machiavelli would have approved of these tactics.</p>
<p>Biren Singh likes to say that he brought the valley and hills of Manipur together. This has an odd ring to it. Because, Biren Singh was a co-author of the hated bills in the first place, being a member of the committee that drafted it. His critics saw this two-facedness in the government’s current project of building a memorial park for the erstwhile Meitei king, Chandrakirti Singh at Chivu in Churachandpur district, near the Indo-Myanmar border. The tribals, especially the Zo tribes, remembered Chandrakirti as Meitei king in whose hands Goukhothang Guite, a tribal chief, died after his “treacherous” capture near Chivu in 1872. To resurrect this wounded past at this time, and in this manner doesn’t sound like a good way to bridge the hill-plain divide. How Biren Singh manoeuvres through these historical mine-fields will have a bearing not only on his political career, but on Manipur itself.</p>
