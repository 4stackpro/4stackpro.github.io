<p>英國接招合唱團（Take That）在90年代紅極一時，為西洋音樂圈吹起男孩偶像團體旋風，雖然過去經歷Robbie Williams單飛以及樂團解散的風波，不過重組復出後，仍持續以3人形式在樂壇走跳。而他們近年早已重修舊好，最近接招合唱團的線上演唱會更與Robbie Williams上演接招大合體！</p>
<p>接招合唱團的創團成員包括Gary Barlow、Howard Donald、Jason Orange、Mark Owen和Robbie Williams，1990年組成之後風靡全球，但團體僅短短5至6年的時間，就因Robbie Williams決定單飛，於是1996年宣布解散。直到2005年接招合唱團宣布重組，並於2010年迎來Robbie Williams短暫回歸；目前創始成員們保持良好關係，而團體則以Gary Barlow、Howard Donald、Mark Owen 3人的編制進行活動。</p>
<p>團體中的主要唱作人Gary Barlow今年4月為疫情展開線上節目「The Crooner Seesion」，邀請音樂人合唱演奏經典歌曲，其中便找了Robbie Williams一起演唱兩人2010年的破冰之作〈Shame〉，隔空合體令人感受滿滿回憶。</p>
<p>這次接招合唱團為音樂相關慈善機構「Nordoff Robbins」和「Crew Nation」募款，幫助全球的音樂相關工作人員，於5月29日展開線上演唱會。團員們先是在各自的家中隔空合唱了〈Greatest Day〉、〈Shine〉兩首歌曲，接著與Robbie Williams連線，上演接招合唱團經典合體。</p>
<p>接招合唱團與Robbie Williams接連唱了〈Back For Good〉、〈The Flood〉、〈Pray〉、〈Never Forget〉等經典歌曲，期間他們現場變裝、換布景，從各自的家中躍上虛擬舞台，重現90年代的男孩魅力。另外還有〈Everything Changes〉、〈Rule The World〉兩首限定歌曲，只開放給播出平台Meerkat Music的會員收看。</p>
<p>這是自2018年接招合唱團在選秀節目《X Factor》決賽表演以來，Robbie Williams首度與Take That合體演出，就差Jason Orange一人，接招合唱團的原始陣容就能全員到齊。</p>
<p>接招合唱團對於這次線上表演表示：「和Robbie聚在一起很開心，這是我們與老朋友首次在線上演出，很高興能參與獨特的節目，也很高興能幫助Nordoff Robbins和Crew Nation這兩個慈善機構。」Robbie Williams也補充說：「真的很期待再次與男孩們表演，這是我的榮幸。如果現在不能實際去體育館（表演），那我們就自己把體育館的舞台作出來！」</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Robin-Williams.jpg" alt="img">
Robin Williams will always be remembered as one of the greatest improv comedians that ever lived. During his lifetime, the celebirty earned two Emmys, four Golden Globes, and five Grammys.</p>
<p>The comedic legend also won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in Good Will Hunting and received three Academy Award nominations for his starring roles in Good Morning, Vietnam, Dead Poets Society, and The Fisher King. His beloved voiceover work as the Genie in Disney’s Aladdin will be a never-ending reminder of his impeccable talent.</p>
<p>Williams managed to retain his classic good looks from back in the early days of television’s Mork and Mindy. The brown hair, long nose, kind eyes, and gentle smile created his iconic style.</p>
<p>In 2002, Williams appeared on the popular improv comedy show, Whose Line is it Anyway. Strangely, those iconic looks had disappeared, and he was almost unrecognizable.</p>

<p>Comedian Drew Carey hosted the British spinoff from 1998 to 2007. Series regulars included Wayne Brady, Colin Mochrie, and Ryan Stiles. There was always a fourth player who was a different guest star each week.</p>
<p>The cast would act out scenes, create characters, or sing on cue from prompts given by the host. Sometimes the audience would offer suggestions, and the comedians would improvise the situation on the spot.</p>
<p>The games varied each episode with season favorites that included “Scenes from a Hat” and “Helping Hands.”</p>
<p>Williams guest star appearance</p>
<p>Williams knack for situational comedy made him a perfect fit for Whose Line is it Anyway? He appeared on the show only once in 2000 during Season 3. He fit into the troupe flawlessly, and even though he was the most famous actor on the stage, he came off as just one of the guys.</p>
<p>Williams’ portrayal of an Italian chef had the audience roaring with laughter. His one-liners were incessant, and the chemistry he developed with the cast was undeniable.</p>
<p>Despite William’s hilarious performance, there was a glaring change to his appearance. His classic good looks and brown wavy hair had been replaced with an extremely blonde short cut. He looked so different that at first glance he appeared to be an entirely different person.</p>
<p>Why the change in looks?</p>

<p>During the taping of the episode, Williams was working on the motion picture One Hour Photo. In the thriller, he plays a troubled film processing clerk obsessed with his customer’s photos. His character has balding short bleach blonde hair and wears wire-rim glasses.</p>
<p>The creepy persona matches his disturbing role in this very non-comedic role.</p>
<p>Williams was so convincing playing Sy Parrish that people forgot it was him they were watching. Not only did he change his hair color, but he was asked to shave his arms and upper chest to get the look the director was going for.</p>
<p>It seems extreme, but Williams was up for the challenge to create a multi-dimensional character that was unlike anything he had ever done before.</p>
<p>Williams untimely death</p>
<p>In 2014 per Variety, much to the shock and dismay of fans around the world, Williams died by suicide, dying at the age of 63. It was later discovered that he had a long history of battling anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>Before his death, he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease, which later the coroner revealed was Lewy body dementia, which is an incurable brain disorder with an apparent risk of suicide. William’s health and demeanor quickly deteriorated and for months before his death friends and family were worried about his morale.</p>
<p>Sadly, he lost his fight but will never be forgotten as the man that made so many people smile helping them to get through their own hard times.

<p><img src="https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTczMDMyNzIyMTExOTMxNjI4/gettyimages-93754988.jpg" alt="img">
Robin Williams brought joy to countless people over the course of his career. However, before he had audiences laughing at films like Aladdin and Mrs. Doubtfire, or touched hearts with performances in Dead Poets Society and Good Will Hunting, he had his breakthrough role with a guest appearance on Happy Days.</p>
<p>In February 1978, Williams played the oddball alien Mork from Ork in an episode of the hit sitcom. The role provided a showcase for his talents and was a key step on his way to stardom — but it took a series of twists and turns, and some desperation on the part of Happy Days producers, for Williams to get the opportunity in the first place.</p>
<p>READ MORE: Robin Williams&rsquo; Non-Stop Mind Brought Joy to Millions. But for Him, It Brought Endless Pain</p>
<p>Garry Marshall&rsquo;s son came up with the idea to have an alien on &lsquo;Happy Days&rsquo;</p>
<p>The movie Star Wars (later known as Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope) came out in 1977. Among the film&rsquo;s many fans was Garry Marshall&rsquo;s son, who asked his father why a spaceman couldn&rsquo;t also stop by Happy Days, the hit show Marshall had created. A visit from outer space didn&rsquo;t quite fit in with a sitcom that took place in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the 1950s, but Marshall decided to make his son happy.</p>
<p>The episode &ldquo;My Favorite Orkan&rdquo; was written for the fifth season of Happy Days. It featured Richie Cunningham, played by Ron Howard, Henry Winkler&rsquo;s always cool Fonzie and others on the show meeting inquisitive and uninhibited alien Mork from Ork. Mork traveled to Earth to take Richie back to his home planet as a specimen for further study. When Richie seeks help escaping his would-be abductor, a battle between the Fonz and Mork ensues (Richie later comes to believe the entire experience was a dream).</p>
<p>In a 2006 interview, Howard related that the network had disliked the episode and didn&rsquo;t want to produce it. Though Howard himself had appreciated the fantastical story idea, he admitted, &ldquo;It was an episode that didn&rsquo;t read so great.&rdquo; Only Marshall&rsquo;s insistence made it possible to go ahead. Even then, the script continued to have its detractors. Anson Williams, who played Richie&rsquo;s friend Potsie on the show, told The Hollywood Reporter that it &ldquo;was like the worst script in the history of Happy Days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a tough search to find the right person to play Mork</p>
<p>Many actors seemed to agree with the negative take on the script&rsquo;s quality because it proved nearly impossible to find someone to play Mork. Some performers, like Dom DeLuise, were offered the part but turned it down. Another person was hired but quit, and the role was still uncast just a few days before the episode was scheduled to tape.</p>
<p>Stories vary as to how Williams came to the attention of Happy Days. Per Anson, Marshall&rsquo;s lack of success in finding an actor for Mork led to him ask the cast, &ldquo;Does anyone know a funny Martian?&rdquo; Al Molinaro, whose character Al Delvecchio ran the diner on Happy Days, suggested Williams, with whom he&rsquo;d taken an improv class. This recommendation was backed up by Ronny Hallin, who was the show&rsquo;s casting director and Marshall&rsquo;s sister.</p>
<p>In a version of the story told by Marshall, &ldquo;Ronny told me about this funny guy, Robin, who performed on the street,&rdquo; he told Page Six. &ldquo;People would put money in his hat.&rdquo; When Marshall was hesitant to bring in someone with this background, Hallin convinced him by saying, &ldquo;The hat&rsquo;s pretty full!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever the means by which he first came to Marshall&rsquo;s attention, Williams was brought in for an audition and easily won the part. Marshall later explained to the Los Angeles Times, &ldquo;I will never forget the day I met him and he stood on his head in my office chair and pretended to drink a glass of water using his finger like a straw.&rdquo; (Mork, being an alien, doesn&rsquo;t drink like a human, and instead of sitting in a standard earthly manner he inserts himself headfirst into chairs, a trait Williams displayed during this episode of Happy Days.)</p>

<p>The cast was blown away by Williams&rsquo; performance</p>
<p>On Wednesday Williams came to the set of Happy Days. Taping was set to occur on Friday evening, and normally a guest star would have started rehearsing with the cast on Monday. Yet this late arrival didn&rsquo;t keep him from mesmerizing everyone around him with his talent. &ldquo;He started improvising instantly,&rdquo; Howard later said of Williams&rsquo; performance. &ldquo;It was the most exhilarating thing.&rdquo; In 2015, Winkler revealed to The Guardian how he&rsquo;d felt at the time: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the presence of greatness and my job here is to get out of his way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Williams had attended Juilliard and been seen on TV in a revival of Laugh-In and The Richard Pryor Show, but nothing he&rsquo;d done previously could match the reaction to his appearance on Happy Days. Marshall shared with People what took place once the show finished taping: &ldquo;At the end of the episode, 300 people in the audience stood up and applauded, which is not usually done. It didn&rsquo;t take a genius to know he could do his own show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the episode aired there was a deluge of fan mail for Williams. In September 1978, just a few months after Mork made his Happy Days debut, he was starring in the sitcom Mork &amp; Mindy, in which his alien character carried out a new mission to explore life on Earth. That popular show ran for four seasons. Williams also stopped by Happy Days again for the episode &ldquo;Mork Returns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Williams, who died on August 11, 2014, left behind an impressive body of work. However, the opportunity to play Mork from Ork on Happy Days remains an important moment in his career. &ldquo;You know, it&rsquo;s weird,&rdquo; Williams told ET Online. &ldquo;Even after I won an Academy Award, it was a week later there were still people going, &lsquo;Mork!'&rdquo;

The last few months have been hard on everyone. The coronavirus lockdown has meant the nation is getting used to a new &lsquo;normal&rsquo; way of living. For Ayda Field, this means facing the reality that her mother, Gwen, cannot live with her following her cancer diagnosis shortly before COVID-19 hit.</p>
<p>Gwen had to move out of the family home to limit her exposure to anyone who could be a potential carrier of the virus – and it&rsquo;s something the whole family are struggling with. But while Ayda misses the daily contact with her mother, she is relishing spending more time with her husband Robbie Williams and their four children Teddy, seven, Charlie, five, Coco, one, and baby Beau.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s even managed to launch a new podcast, Postcards From the Edge. As she talks with HELLO! about her experiences of life during a global pandemic, Ayda has shared an intimate peek into her private camera roll sharing some of her favourite lockdown photos.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re very, very lucky because we&rsquo;ve got a really big property and on the back of our land is kind of this mini-hike. During quarantine it was a real safe haven, on so many different levels because there was nobody there so it felt safe to go and explore with the kids – we&rsquo;d just hike up the hill, look out at the city and it was really nice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was a really fun moment. It was us with Rob after not seeing him for almost a month. It was a celebratory time in the midst of a weird time, like holding onto what really matters. It was so nice being together as a family and breathing fresh air. We got so excited by that picture that we cleared some dirt on our land and we created a meditation trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the really cool things that&rsquo;s happened to us as a family is that we&rsquo;ve all got into meditating. Teddy will now go, &lsquo;Hey let&rsquo;s meditate.&rsquo; We regularly go on the trail, whether it&rsquo;s with the kids or after we tuck them in at night. Sometimes we have an off day, it&rsquo;s weird in quarantine; there are some days you feel positive and other days where you just have this indiscernible heaviness. So when Rob and I are feeling that we go, &lsquo;Ok, let&rsquo;s go to the meditation trail.&rsquo; We&rsquo;ll play one of the guided meditations and we&rsquo;ll just sit up there and that just washes everything away and it just feels better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ayda and Robbie welcomed baby Beau via surrogate (Image: Ayda Field)</p>
<p>Ayda and Robbie welcomed their fourth child, Beau, via surrogate in February. But it was a bittersweet moment because it was the first time Ayda&rsquo;s mother, Gwen, had not been present at the birth of one of her grandchildren. Gwen, who suffers from Parkinson&rsquo;s and Lupus, was diagnosed with Stage 2 Cervical Cancer in January. &ldquo;It was a very bizarre time,&rdquo; Ayda said. &ldquo;I knew I was welcoming another child via surrogate so it was this high and low mixture. (Gwen) couldn&rsquo;t be there for the birth because she had to go straight into chemo and that was very sad for me. She&rsquo;s been there for the birth of all of my children whether it be via me or via surrogate, she&rsquo;s been there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During lockdown, Ayda has noticed more than ever the importance of staying active – something she&rsquo;s very happy has rubbed off on daughter Teddy. &ldquo;I think for Rob and for myself, for mental health, I just think it&rsquo;s so important, especially in quarantine to have that outlet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughter, I&rsquo;m so impressed, for a couple of years now I&rsquo;ve tried to get them to go on walks with me and we&rsquo;ll get about five minutes in and they&rsquo;ll go, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t do it,&rsquo; and I feel like mean mum going, &lsquo;Come on, you can do it.&rsquo; But in quarantine, my daughter decided that she wanted to go on a hike every morning before school. So she completely, self-motivated, she likes to be at the top of the mountain and have peanut butter toast, and take a deep breath before she starts her day. I just felt like, as a parent, it was so rewarding to give her that gift of exercise and nature and well-being and self-care.</p>
<p>Ayda and Robbie have also been keeping their kids entertained with &ldquo;lots of arts and crafts&rdquo;, she revealed during an episode of (Staying) At Home With the Williamses. &ldquo;Charlie in particular loves to paint and draw. Teddy likes dancing and making up songs, so we have a piano in the playroom and she just plays and makes up songs and you sometimes sing with her. Coco we throw in a playpen that&rsquo;s in the playroom and we just let her smash stuff. Beau, pretty much just sleeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ayda&rsquo;s first outing was to a poppy field (Image: Ayda Field)</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was taken in a poppy field. It was the only time we left the house and my friend told me about this poppy field that was off the beaten track that nobody was at. I remember being really nervous because we were driving to this place and I saw people on the street and I thought, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going to stop if there are people.&rsquo; Then we went off this dirt path, up this hillside and there was nobody there. We just sat and had a picnic with the kids. It was the only time we went outside of our four walls which felt really awesome, and it was nice to be breathing fresh air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We bought this house for the garden and never have I been happier because it has been our absolute saving grace. We have a veggie patch and we grow veggies. When the lockdown happened it was really hard for us to get fresh vegetables and avocados and even eggs so I thought, &lsquo;I want to expand on this and be in a position where we have chickens to lay eggs and we grow more vegetables.&rsquo; All the citrus we eat is grown on our land. The other day we went picking at our orange and lemon trees and we picked fruit and we made ice lollies. We&rsquo;ve always picked our own fruit but I have to say the softer side of quarantine is really enjoying those moments with the kids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Picking fruit and veg isn&rsquo;t the only pastimes Ayda and her family use their expansive garden for. She added: &ldquo;We like to have movie nights in the garden with the kids - we have a removable screen so we put it outside, and we have couches and pillows. This was my birthday so we made it look really nice and we had a movie night. We have even camped in our garden. We have a tent and we pitched it up when the weather was nice and we did a staycation. We got a fire pit and we did smores and we slept in the tent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re so blessed. I just think, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s use it to the fullest and love every tree and flower and hillside.&rsquo; Let&rsquo;s be out there. Coco runs around, we splash in the pool, we chase each other. It&rsquo;s pretty awesome. Rob and I still pinch ourselves, we look out at it and think, &lsquo;Wow, we get to live here.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s almost like we&rsquo;re squatting in someone else&rsquo;s home. At least we really enjoy it. We&rsquo;re not the kind of people who don&rsquo;t use it at all. We love this garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ayda made the difficult choice to move Gwen out of her home (Image: Ayda Field)</p>
<p>But these highs have had one very big low which came hand in hand: Ayda was forced to make the difficult decision to move her mum Gwen (who played a part in her new podcast, Postcards from the Edge, which was recorded before the pandemic hit) out of her home over COVID-19 fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re used to seeing each other every day and I had to make the tough decision, it was a really tough decision, to move her out of my house. My kids didn&rsquo;t understand why they couldn&rsquo;t see Nana Gwen, and even when she comes to visit in the garden I won&rsquo;t let them get close, they have to wear masks, they can&rsquo;t touch her, the dogs can&rsquo;t run-up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very weird because when you know something could just take your mother out you do everything you can, so I had to move her out. She lives with her boyfriend and I have food delivered to her and I try to keep her as safe as I possibly can but you can only do so much. I just love that my mum is in a happy relationship and she&rsquo;s enjoying being in love, she&rsquo;s really carved out a positive place in what is a very dark situation and I look up to her for that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how this story ends with my mum. I pray that she beats cancer and then we can face Parkinson&rsquo;s and Lupus and I can somehow, miraculously keep her on this planet with me for another 15 years. COVID is just awful because it&rsquo;s this invisible thing that could just take her out in a second, there&rsquo;s no way she&rsquo;d be able to withstand that. But she&rsquo;s so brave and so positive and she supersedes my expectations on handling this. But not knowing how this story ends is very scary.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="film-o-sebi-sovraži-čeprav-ga-je-upodobil-robin-williams">&ldquo;Film o sebi sovraži, čeprav ga je upodobil Robin Williams&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://siol.net/media/img/57/88/0ce027c7d9fc8ad7ad5a-planet-tv.jpeg" alt="img">
V soboto ob 21.30 si boste lahko na Planetu ogledali komično dramo Zdravnik s srcem (Patch Adams) z nepozabnim Robinom Williamsom. Scenarij je nastal na podlagi knjige zdravnika Patcha Adamsa in njegovih pogledov na življenje. Čeprav je film postal uspešnica in je bil nominiran celo za oskarja, pravi Patch Adams s filmom ni bil preveč zadovoljen.</p>
<p>V filmu Zdravnik s srcem, ki je nastal na podlagi resnične zgodbe o nevsakdanjem zdravniku Patchu Adamsu, je v glavni vlogi zaigral Robin Williams. Ustvarjalci filma so po besedah pravega Patcha Adamsa obljubili, da bodo del zaslužka namenili njegovi neprofitni zdravstveni organizaciji Gesundheit! Institute. To pa se kasneje naj ne bi zgodilo, zato je Adams odkrito priznal, da sovraži ta film.</p>
<p>Pravi Patch Adams in igralec Robin Williams:</p>
<p>Leta 2017 je Patch Adams v enem izmed intervjujev dejal, da po izidu filma o sebi ni prebral nobenega pozitivnega članka.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pisali so le o neumnih in nepomembnih zadevah. Otroci, ki jih zdravim, so jokali, ker so menili, da ne poznajo osebe, o kateri berejo. Vedel sem, da bo imel film tak vpliv in da bom izpadel zabavni zdravnik. Predstavljajte si, kako plitvo to izpade v primerjavi s tem, kdo sem v resnici.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ne glede na vse pa je Williams za upodobitev zdravnika z nekoliko drugačnim pristopom prejel nagrado zlati globus, izkazal pa se je tudi s svojo dobrodelnostjo. Navkljub praznim obljubam resničnemu Patchu Adamsu, je Robin Williams skupaj z ostalo igralsko zasedbo tesno sodeloval z arizonsko fundacijo Make-A-Wish, ki izpolnjuje želje otrokom, ki se zdravijo za rakom. Ti otroci so nastopili tudi v filmu, v prizorih v pediatričnem oddelku bolnišnice.</p>
<p>Pravi Patch Adams pa je kljub nezadovoljstvu s filmom priznal, da je bil navdušen nad Robinom Williamsom, saj naj bi bil prav on tisti, ki je na snemanju celotno filmsko zasedbo spravljal v smeh z improvizacijo, ko je prišlo do nesporazumov in trenj.</p>
<p>Komična drama Zdravnik s srcem (Patch Adams) z Robinom Williamsom bo na sporedu v soboto ob 21.30 na Planetu.</p>
<p>Ponovitev bo v nedeljo ob 15.35, po animiranem filmu Paranorman.</p>

Cels are transparent pieces of celluloid that are used during the animation process, and Zac Williams revealed to People that he and Olivia June own several from Aladdin. The 1992 Disney classic, in which Robin Williams played the Genie, is easily one of the actor’s most infamous performances. It’s also definitely one of the few that would be age appropriate for a baby to engage with. But it sounds like both parents have been very mindful about how to integrate elements of Robin Williams’ life and career into their son’s life. Zac Williams said they’ve decided to go about the process gradually:

<p>Details of the competition:</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>

If an Entrant fails to answer their phone, is driving, or if any fault occurs immediately prior to or during the call and it is not possible to re-establish contact with the Entrant, they will forfeit their chance to win and another entry will be selected at random. The Producer’s decision is final. Unsuccessful Entrants will not be contacted.</p>
