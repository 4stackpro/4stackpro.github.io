<p>The Prince of Wales is now out of self-isolation, following his diagnosis of coronavirus.</p>
<p>Prince Charles, 71, spent seven days self-isolating in Scotland after testing positive and displaying mild symptoms.</p>
<p>The Duchess of Cornwall, 72, was tested and did not have the virus, but will self-isolate until the end of the week.</p>
<p>A Palace official said the prince was in good health and was following the government&rsquo;s restrictions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clarence House has confirmed today that, having consulted with his doctor, the Prince of Wales is now out of self-isolation,&rdquo; a spokesman said.</p>
<p>Prince Charles, who is known as the Duke of Rothesay in Scotland, spent his seven days of quarantine at his Birkhall home on the royal Balmoral estate.</p>
<p>According to government guidelines, anyone with symptoms should self-isolate for seven days, while everyone living in their household should self-isolate for two weeks.</p>
<p>Buckingham Palace previously said the Queen last saw her son, the heir to the throne, on 12 March, and was &ldquo;in good health&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It comes as the total number of people who have died with the virus in the UK reached 1,408 in the latest total for deaths up to 17:00 BST on Sunday, including a further 159 people in England, six in Scotland, 14 in Wales and one in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>More than 9,000 people who have tested positive for coronavirus are being treated in hospitals across England, according to NHS England&rsquo;s Sir Simon Stevens.</p>
<p>The prime minister - who became the first world leader to announce he had the virus - has continued to lead the country&rsquo;s response to the pandemic, carrying out meetings over video link while self-isolating in his Downing Street flat.</p>
<p>On Monday, a No 10 source confirmed Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser, has developed symptoms of the virus and was self-isolating at home.

<h3 id="prince-charles-is-one-of-the-uks-most-successful-living-artists-here-are-15-of-his-works">Prince Charles is one of the UK&rsquo;s most successful living artists. Here are 15 of his works.</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.insider.com/5e7badc52ff839143a342668?width=1200&amp;format=jpeg" alt="img">
Though he describes himself as an &ldquo;enthusiastic amateur,&rdquo; Prince Charles is said to be one of the most successful living artists in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>His paintings were first exhibited in Windsor Castle in 1977, next to the work of his other artistic relatives, Queen Victoria and the Duke of Edinburgh.</p>
<p>The prince favors outdoor scenes and only paints in watercolor. One of his favorite places to paint is the Queen&rsquo;s estate at Balmoral.</p>
<p>The Daily Telegraph reported that from 1997 to 2016, copies of his watercolors had earned an estimated £2 million, and the proceeds were donated to his charity, The Prince of Wales&rsquo;s Charitable Fund.</p>
<p>Prince Charles started painting in the 1970s after he was inspired by Robert Waddell, his art master at Gordonstoun School in Scotland.</p>
<p>He works exclusively in watercolor, and his paintings were first exhibited in Windsor Castle in 1977. They were displayed alongside works from Queen Victoria, herself an avid watercolorist, and the Duke of Edinburgh, a painter and designer, whose sketches helped create the stained-glass windows in the Private Chapel of Windsor Castle.</p>
<p>Following his first exhibition, Prince Charles continued to show his work, which became hugely popular in the UK and abroad. Though he modestly refers to himself as an &ldquo;enthusiastic amateur,&rdquo; he made an estimated £2 million from the sales of copies of his watercolors from 1997 to 2016, making him one of the country&rsquo;s best-selling living artists, The Daily Telegraph reported in 2016.</p>
<p>The prince, who has donated all profits from his artwork to The Prince of Wales&rsquo;s Charitable Fund, prefers to paint outdoor scenes, favoring mountains, streams, and the surrounding areas of the Queen&rsquo;s estate at Balmoral. His works have been featured on stamps in the UK and even on a Swiss ski pass.</p>
<p>Take a look at some of the prince&rsquo;s paintings.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall are isolating at Birkhall, their residence on the Balmoral estate</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales has tested positive for coronavirus, Clarence House has announced.</p>
<p>Prince Charles, 71, is displaying mild symptoms &ldquo;but otherwise remains in good health&rdquo;, a spokesman said, adding that the Duchess of Cornwall, 72, has been tested but does not have the virus.</p>
<p>Charles and Camilla are now self-isolating at Balmoral.</p>
<p>Buckingham Palace said the Queen last saw her son, the heir to the throne, on 12 March, but was &ldquo;in good health&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The palace added that the Duke of Edinburgh was not present at that meeting, and that the Queen was now &ldquo;following all the appropriate advice with regard to her welfare&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A Clarence House statement read: &ldquo;In accordance with government and medical advice, the prince and the duchess are now self-isolating at home in Scotland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tests were carried out by the NHS in Aberdeenshire, where they met the criteria required for testing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not possible to ascertain from whom the prince caught the virus owing to the high number of engagements he carried out in his public role during recent weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Image copyright PA Media Image caption Buckingham Palace releases a photograph of the Queen speaking to the prime minister from Windsor Castle</p>
<p>The duke and duchess arrived in Scotland on Sunday. Charles had been displaying mild symptoms over the weekend and was tested by the NHS in Aberdeenshire on Monday.</p>
<p>The results came through on Tuesday night, showing he was positive.</p>
<p>Charles is still working, is up and about and in good spirits.</p>
<p>The 71-year-old heir to the throne last saw the Queen briefly on the 12 March. Three days earlier, mother and son had more protracted contact during the Commonwealth Day Service.</p>
<p>It is important to re-emphasise the Queen is in good health. She moved to Windsor last week, with the Duke of Edinburgh who came from his usual residence at Sandringham in Norfolk.</p>
<p>Given their ages, 93 and 98 respectively, there will be particular care taken that they are not jeopardised by this virus.</p>
<p>Prince Charles and Camilla will be following governmental advice and isolating separately. It&rsquo;s not a huge house but certainly big enough to isolate yourself within it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got a small staff with them - and it&rsquo;s expected Charles will now be in Scotland for a couple of weeks recovering from the symptoms.</p>
<p>The prince&rsquo;s last public engagement was on 12 March - the same day he last saw the Queen - when he attended a dinner in aid of the Australian bushfire relief and recovery effort.</p>
<p>However, Charles has also been working from home over the last few days, and has held a number of private meetings with Highgrove and Duchy of Cornwall individuals, all of whom have been made aware.</p>
<p>A number of household staff at Birkhall - the prince&rsquo;s residence on the Balmoral estate - are now self-isolating at their own homes.</p>
<p>A palace source said the prince has spoken to both the Queen and his sons - the Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex - and is in good spirits.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had been informed about the prince&rsquo;s positive test result on Tuesday morning and he wished him &ldquo;a speedy recovery&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The spokesman added the PM&rsquo;s weekly audience with the Queen was now taking place by telephone.</p>
<p>Figures released from NHS England show there were 28 deaths over the latest recorded 24-hour period, bringing the coronavirus death toll in England to 414.</p>
<p>There have also been 22 deaths so far in Scotland, 22 in Wales and seven in Northern Ireland, according to the latest available figures.</p>
