Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jacinda Ardern&rsquo;s handling of New Zealand&rsquo;s coronavirus outbreak has been praised</p>
<p>A comedian has apologised to New Zealandâ€™s prime minister after she tried to bake a cake in her likeness and produced a calamitous result.</p>
<p>Laura Daniel baked the cake, meant to resemble Jacinda Ardern&rsquo;s face, during an episode of the TV programme Seven Sharp, which aired earlier this week.</p>
<p>Daniel challenged host Hilary Barry to a bake-off competition.</p>
<p>Both were tasked with baking an iconic Kiwi cake in 120 minutes without using flour.</p>
<p>Barry, an experienced baker, made pavlova in the shape of Mount Cook, the highest mountain in New Zealand, which she appeared pleased with.</p>
<p>Daniel, on the other hand, baked a lolly cake supposed to look like Ms Ardern, using a picture on the front of her autobiography for inspiration.</p>
<p>As images of the finished article show, the cake was hardly a dead ringer for Ms Ardern.</p>
<p>Reflecting on her cake catastrophe in an Instagram post, Daniel said she realised the wisdom of the phrase &ldquo;donâ€™t bake your heroes&rdquo;, but &ldquo;wanted to try anyway&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iâ€™m deeply sorry Jacinda Ardern,&rdquo; Daniel wrote. &ldquo;I truly tried my best with what I had availableâ€¦ itâ€™s made from another NZ icon lolly cake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prime minister later commented in the post: &ldquo;ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The cake promoted amusement and ridicule on social media, where people poked fun at Danielâ€™s crude creation.</p>
<p>One person described the cake as &ldquo;truly haunting&rdquo;, while another wrote, apparently sarcastically, &ldquo;spitting image&rdquo; alongside a thumbs-up emoji.</p>
<p>Baking at home has increased in popularity during New Zealandâ€™s lockdown, imposed by Ms Ardern to prevent the spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p>Ms Ardernâ€™s handling of New Zealandâ€™s coronavirus outbreak has received widespread praise in the media.</p>

<p>Her response to the coronavirus pandemic was swift, involving the closure of New Zealandâ€™s borders to foreigners on 20 March before the introduction of strict social-distancing measures on 26 March.</p>
<p>All but essential businesses and services were closed and stay-at-home orders were issued nationwide as part of the four-stage lockdown.</p>
<p>Currently, there are around 1,400 known cases and nine deaths from the outbreak in New Zealand, a country of almost five million people.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Ms Ardern signalled the country was approaching a position where she may be able to lift some restrictions on life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are promising signs our go-hard-and-go-early elimination strategy is working and the lockdown is breaking the chain of community transmission,&rdquo; Ms Ardern said.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the prime minister said she and other ministers would take a 20% pay cut for the next six months to show solidarity with those affected by coronavirus. Government leaders in other countries, including those in Singapore and Ecuador, have reduced their pay for similar reasons.

Video</p>
<p>When comedian Melanie Bracewell found herself facing weeks of self-isolation as New Zealand went into a coronavirus lockdown, she decided to make videos of herself doing impressions of the country&rsquo;s prime minister.</p>
<p>Her clips on TikTok have now been watched by thousands across the world, and garnered her many fans - including Ms Ardern herself.</p>
<p>Ms Bracewell says her impressions are not parody - but a homage to someone &ldquo;she&rsquo;s very proud of&rdquo; for steering the country through a pandemic.</p>
<p>New Zealand and Ms Ardern&rsquo;s government have been praised for swiftly stemming the coronavirus outbreak, with relatively few cases and deaths.</p>

<h3 id="coronavirus-jacinda-ardern-rejects-donald-trumps-argument-for-defunding-world-health-organisation">Coronavirus: Jacinda Ardern rejects Donald Trump&rsquo;s argument for defunding World Health Organisation</h3>
<p><img src="https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/x/2/t/k/4/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.202abe.png/1586930202279.jpg" alt="img">
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she did not agree with US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s stated reasons for defunding the World Health Organsation, and said it would be key in the fight against coronavirus.</p>
<p>Trump announced on Wednesday that he would suspend American funding to the WHO as the US &ldquo;reviewed&rdquo; its role in the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>The US is the largest single funder of UN-organised body, spending between $400 and $500m a year - over ten per cent of the total budget.</p>
<p>GETTY IMAGES &ldquo;At a time like this where we need to be sharing information where we need to have advice that we can rely on the WHO has been doing that,&rdquo; Ardern said.</p>
<p>Trump said the WHO had failed to contain the virus within China because of &ldquo;political correctness&rdquo; and had pushed back against travel bans.</p>

</ul>
<p>He said the organisation had &ldquo;failed in its basic duty and it must be held accountable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Asked if these arguments had merit on Wednesday, Ardern simply responded &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</p>
<p>She said the position of New Zealand was that the WHO was incredibly important.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At a time like this where we need to be sharing information where we need to have advice that we can rely on the WHO has been doing that,&rdquo; Ardern said.</p>
<p>New Zealand spent just over $2m supporting the WHO at the last budget.</p>
<p>Health Director General Dr. Ashley Bloomfield worked at the WHO in Geneva in 2011 on non-communicable diseases.</p>
<p>He said on Wednesday that the WHO would be key in fighting coronavirus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The global response to this pandemic will require a strong World Health Organisation so it behoves all of us I think to - and New Zealand I know will continue to play its part supporting the organisation both globally and in our region in the Pacific.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Trump&rsquo;s move has come under widespread fire, the WHO have been criticised by many for its response to Covid-19, particularly over whether it was too trusting of China.</p>
<p>Japanese deputy prime minister Taro Aso said it had close enough ties to China that some people were describing it as the &ldquo;Chinese Health Organisation&rdquo;. It has also come in for criticism from Taiwan.</p>
<p>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said it was &ldquo;not the time&rdquo; to over-examine the WHO response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once we have finally turned the page on this epidemic, there must be a time to look back fully to understand how such a disease emerged and spread its devastation so quickly across the globe, and how all those involved reacted to the crisis. The lessons learned will be essential to effectively address similar challenges, as they may arise in the future,&rsquo; Gutterres said in a statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now is not that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it is not that time, it is also not the time to reduce the resources for the operations of the World Health Organisation or any other humanitarian organisation in the fight against the virus.&rdquo;
