SANDUSKY, Ohio — Easter definitely has a different vibe this year. Although we&rsquo;re not having our traditional family gatherings as everybody continues physical distancing to slow the spread of coronavirus, there are still ways to have fun.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not having an Easter egg hunt at your house, Cedar Point is offering a virtual option that your kids will love.</p>
<p>The park&rsquo;s virtual egg hunt features a picture of the GateKeeper roller coaster with WindSeeker, Wicked Twister and the Giant Wheel in the background (see below). The picture contains 150 eggs, which is in honor of Cedar Point&rsquo;s 150th anniversary season in 2020.</p>
<p>Can you find all of them? See if your kids can help, too!</p>

<p>RELATED: Cedar Point suspends billing for season passholders on monthly payments amid &lsquo;uncertainty around park opening&rsquo;</p>
<p>Did you find all 150?</p>
<p>Now that you solved that one, here&rsquo;s ANOTHER Easter egg challenge from the CP Food Blog Facebook page (it&rsquo;s a bit tougher, too):</p>
<p>Cedar Point, which was originally scheduled to open this year on May 9, has delayed the start of the 2020 season due to coronavirus concerns. Although no official opening date was given, officials are hopeful to open by &ldquo;mid-May or as soon thereafter as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cedar Point has also temporarily suspended all monthly billing for season passholders on payment plans. The billing process will resume once the park opens.</p>
<p>2020 at Cedar Point will feature a new boat ride, multiple new food locations and more. You can see all of the planned additions for this season HERE.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae729d6db2adef56517b031f282f014be27000de/0_297_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=ca730288072cef1b6204c9ebe82e66e0" alt="img">
It is Easter Sunday and I want to hide some eggs. Not for the kids, who are too old for this, but for me, and for the maintenance of a fiction that inside some smelly pre-teens are three five-year-olds, standing on the brink of reason, tethered to their first age of wonder by the discovery of sweets in unexpected places. For as long as there are offspring in this house who will still eat chocolate, I will still hide chocolate eggs.</p>
<p>The truth is, even when they do stir themselves to find the eggs, they don’t even eat them, it is like the coins at the bottom of a Christmas stocking, eggs in bulk are somehow engineered to be hoarded rather than used, a prototype for money.</p>
<p>I am very well aware of the risks of the enterprise, especially in a freakishly well-insulated house, in the unseasonal heat. I once had a boyfriend’s parents to stay for Christmas, because the dad was recovering from an operation on his colon, and I put a mid-sized chocolate Santa on their pillow as a welcome, only they unaccountably didn’t find the Santa, which melted overnight, and they thought … well, it is obvious what they thought.</p>
<p>The house is small and without nooks. There are at least two people in it who won’t let me rootle about in their rooms, unsupervised. There is a dog who is a tenacious finder and who isn’t allowed to eat chocolate. There is a rabbit, who would immediately expire if he ingested silver foil, because rabbits are pathetic. It’s like a Rubik’s Cube: how are you supposed to hide things in these conditions? Where would they never look? “Inside the dishwasher,” said my Mr. “Oh, oh, wait, I’ve never seen any of them use the washing machine. I don’t think they know we have a washing machine. What about the laundry basket? The tumble drier? Behind the deodorant? With the mop? Inside the vacuum cleaner!” “Do you think this hunt is getting a bit passive aggressive?” “No, better, underneath the crap on their own floors. We could hide gold bullion underneath the crap on their own floors.”</p>

<h3 id="easter-egg-surprise-for-all-in-west-kerry-parish">Easter egg surprise for all in west Kerry parish</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.rasset.ie/00141afd-1600.jpg" alt="img">
It is a very special Easter Sunday for a small community in west Kerry where somebody has left €500 in the local shop to buy an Easter egg for every single child in the parish of Baile an Fheirtéaraigh.</p>
<p>The kind donor, who wishes to remain anonymous, also left instructions in O’Connor’s shop in Baile an Fheirtéaraigh to gift Easter eggs to the elderly and the vulnerable cocooning in the parish.</p>
<p>Nikki and Colm O’Connor, who run the shop in Baile an Fheirtéaraigh, said the they were &ldquo;gobsmacked&rdquo; when the person came in and made the request.</p>
<p>Nikki said: &ldquo;A customer we know, who lives locally, came in to the shop and said they wanted to give every child and every person living on their own an egg for Easter because of the way things are now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are isolated and alone. She said she wanted to bring a smile to people’s faces on Easter Sunday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she said she wanted to remain strictly anonymous and did not want any credit for it. There are only about 500 people living in our parish, so it’s the talk of the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the help of neighbours, more than 250 Easter eggs are being delivered around the parish. A volunteer dressed in a panda costume is surprising the young and old at their doorsteps.</p>
<p>The Dalby family were blown away by the kind and unexpected visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It’s magic. The gesture of just walking in to a shop and wanting to buy eggs for the children and the vulnerable in our community is really special.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It’s a tremendous lift for everyone in the parish as we try to deal with this lockdown. It&rsquo;s so considerate and we have no idea who is behind it,&rdquo; said Douglas Dalby.</p>
<p>In her mid-70s and cocooning alone, Mary Uí Chatháin said seeing the panda with an Easter egg for her at her front door lifted her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I’m on my own but my son and my daughter-in-law help me, delivering messages and that. This is a lovely thing to do for people like me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It’s nice to know that somebody is still thinking of you when you are cornered away. It&rsquo;s a really wonderful gesture,&rdquo; said Mrs Uí Chatháín.
