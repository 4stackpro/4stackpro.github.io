<p>RIP Sushant Singh Rajput: Ex-gf reacts to the tragic news | Photo Credit: BCCL</p>
<p>The sudden demise of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput has left everyone in a state of shock and disbelief.</p>
<p>The actor reportedly committed suicide on Sunday. As per the preliminary investigation, he was found hanging at his Bandra residence.</p>
<p>His demise on Sunday came as a shock to the entire film fraternity and also people from other walks of life. Bollywood is shellshocked as this is the fourth death of a famous personality in the past two months.</p>
<p>The tragic news comes less than a week after his manager Disha Sailan committed suicide by jumping off her 14th-floor apartment in Mumbai. According to reports, she was rushed to a hospital in Borivali, where she was declared dead.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old actor started his Bollywood journey with &lsquo;Kai Po Che!&rsquo; in 2013. He attained stardom with stellar performances in &lsquo;Kai Po Che!', &lsquo;MS Dhoni: The Untold Story&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Detective Byomkesh Bakshy’.</p>
<p>Before entering Bollywood, Sushant Singh Rajput earned fame by starring as Manav Deshmukh in the popular TV series &lsquo;Pavitra Rishta&rsquo;. His work in the series received wide appreciation and the actor was also awarded three major television awards.</p>
<p>His co-star in the series was Ankita Lokhande, who also happened to be the actor&rsquo;s ex-girlfriend. Needless to say, the untimely demise came as a shock to her.</p>
<p>On being contacted by India TV over the telephone, the actress simply said &lsquo;What!&rsquo; and hung up the call.</p>
<p>Ankita and Sushant dated for many years and sadly broke up the year they had announced their marriage. After dating her, Sushant Singh allegedly dater his Raabta co-star Kriti Sanon. More recently, the actor was in the news for his relationship with actress Rhea Chakraborty, with many media houses claiming the two had been dating for a long time.

The ‘Shakti’ actor, while talking to an entertainment portal, said that Sushant’s on-screen mother, Usha Nadkarni, has been crying since she heard the news.</p>
<p>“Aai (Usha Nadkarni) can&rsquo;t stop crying. Manju Shah (Swati Anand), everyone is shattered after hearing the news. All Pavitra Rishta actors were discussing and everyone is asking why? I spoke to Ankita (Lokhande). She is also devastated and everyone is speechless as to how this happened. She was devastated and is unable to believe the news. Everything was good, Chichore was a hit, his new film was coming Bechara, which looked good, why Sushant why. I was watching the teasers of Bechara yesterday. He was so good,” Parag Tyagi told ETimes.</p>
<p>Ankita had shared a cryptic post on her Instagram story before the news of Sushant&rsquo;s suicide hit the internet. The Manikarika&rsquo; actress has deleted the post.</p>
