April 5 marks the 15th anniversary of MS Dhoni &lsquo;s first international century, an innings of great significance for Indian cricket. As a flamboyant 23-year-old from Ranchi wreaked havoc on Pakistan&rsquo;s bowlers with a 123-ball 148 under the scorching Visakhapatnam sun, India finally found a wicketkeeper-batsman who could set the world on fire., an integral part of Team India at the time, speaks to Arani Basu and recalls the day that set the tone for Dhoni&rsquo;s fairytale career&hellip;I distinctly remember that match in Visakhapatnam. It was the second ODI of that series. In a video that went viral, I am seen hurling abuses at MS after an edge off Shahid Afridi &lsquo;s bat goes between Dhoni and Rahul Dravid at first slip. People assume it&rsquo;s from the Vizag match, but that incident is from the fourth ODI in Ahmedabad. However, I must admit I am not proud of my behaviour.I had been hit for six by Afridi off just the previous ball. There was the usual pressure of an India-Pakistan match. Suddenly, I created a chance and it was missed. I lost my cool. That wasn&rsquo;t the only incident where a player has lost his cool in that manner. Both Dravid and Dhoni were fine with me after the game but that doesn&rsquo;t justify my behaviour.The video is still popular because it has Dhoni in it. It&rsquo;s like that old picture of me presenting an award to Virat Kohli when he was a kid. The picture is famous because it has Kohli in it, not because of me. I know someday my kids will eventually watch that video clip and I&rsquo;ll have to explain why I behaved that way!(Getty Images)Coming back to the Visakhapatnam knock, Dhoni&rsquo;s innings is of great significance for Indian cricket. That innings got the team to believe that we too could have a prolific wicketkeeper-batsman. Dhoni didn&rsquo;t have a great time in his initial matches. But when a confident man like him gets an opportunity and cashes in, then it&rsquo;s hard to pull him back. Unwavering self-confidence is Dhoni&rsquo;s strength. That innings was like he had tasted blood and he yearned for more. He hardly ever batted at No. 3 after that innings but he had made a statement that day. We lost all the remaining four matches in that series but we discovered Dhoni.Dhoni wasn&rsquo;t the best wicketkeeper around when he first came in. All those who played before him were really good. He was certainly not a Kiran More or a Nayan Mongia. So it&rsquo;s not that he was miles ahead of his contemporaries as a wicketkeeper, but he made for a better package. His discipline, passion, composure and confidence made him different.It was also the time the team wanted to relieve Dravid of wicketkeeping duties in One-day cricket. I remember we tried out Dinesh Karthik for a year after Parthiv Patel. DK was an exceptional talent with sound technique. But Dhoni did what DK and Parthiv couldn&rsquo;t — make the most of his opportunities. Dhoni may not have been the best-looking batsman or a sound wicketkeeper but he certainly was the best wicketkeeper-batsman. He worked hard on his game, knew what work for him and grew as an impeccable wicketkeeper. I don&rsquo;t see anyone coming close to the impact he has had as a wicketkeeper-batsman except for Rishabh Pant. Pant&rsquo;s journey – though it is still early days – reminds me a lot of Dhoni.I didn&rsquo;t play for India between 2005 and 2009. A lot had changed in Indian cricket in that time. When I made a comeback, Dhoni was leading India. However, it was not that we were not on talking terms during that period. Dhoni had offered me Test cricket again in 2009, which I declined. Looking back, I do regret that decision a bit.Make no mistake, Dhoni is one of the legendary captains of contemporary cricket. I don&rsquo;t know much about the era of Mike Brearley, Imran Khan or Arjuna Ranatunga but whatever cricket I have seen over the last 22 years, Dhoni and Sourav Ganguly are the two defining captains in contemporary cricket. Dhoni knew how to get the work done and knew who could do it for him.In the later stages of my career, I played with him at Chennai Super Kings. There have been suggestions recently that he is overly passionate when it comes to CSK. Yes, he is very passionate about CSK but that doesn&rsquo;t mean he is any less passionate when playing for India. I would rather say that it&rsquo;s a good thing that an IPL captain is so attached to his franchise. Dhoni and Rohit Sharma are the two best captains in IPL because they are passionate about their jobs.Leading an IPL team is not an easy job as it may seem to a lot of people. Unlike national teams, you get just two months to build a team and get it to perform. Captaining in T20s is tougher than Tests and ODIs. You have to remain calm and know your players really well to make decisions when the game moves so fast. Dhoni&rsquo;s calm is the template and Rohit has also grown in the same manner.And now when everyone discusses his future and talks about how a good IPL season could help his cause, I have two questions: 1) Has Dhoni been dropped after the World Cup? 2) Is KL Rahul your long-term option as a keeper-batsman? The day somebody could answer these two questions together, you&rsquo;ll know the significance of MS Dhoni.

<h3 id="kevin-pietersen-asks-virat-kohli-to-stop-supporting-ms-dhoni">Kevin Pietersen asks Virat Kohli to Stop Supporting MS Dhoni</h3>
<p><img src="https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/20200404130057/GettyImages-1159557868.jpg" alt="img">
Indian Captain Virat Kohli and former England batsman Kevin Pietersen had a fun chat on Instagram live. The duo talked about a lot of things ranging from their playing together for RCB to Kohli’s nickname. The viewers also witnessed a cute banter between the two on Kevin being former Indian skipper MS Dhoni’s first test wicket.</p>
<p>There has been an ongoing trolling between MS Dhoni and Kevin Pietersen since 2011. The incident that happened was that Dhoni had Kevin caught behind the stumps during a test match in England in 2011. Since then Mahi refers to Pietersen as his first test wicket.</p>
<p>KP’s clarification to Virat Kohli</p>
<p>Kevin Pietersen brought up this issue during the live chat with Kohli on Thursday. He gave clarification on how he wasn’t out after a close DRS call. The England star also described Mahi’s bowling as ‘filth’.</p>
<p>Pietersen mentioned, “A lot of people told me, I am Dhoni’s first test wicket. I referred it &amp; I was given not out remember?”</p>
<p>However, Kohli was up for backing his former captain and gave a fitting reply to the England all-rounder.</p>
<p>Kohli replied,” Yeah, I know. Look the thing is, MS has a point, It came upon the stump mics and nothing came on the hotspot so he has a point.”</p>
<p>To this, a frustrated KP added, “Oh, you stop backing him.”</p>
<p>Here watch this hilarious conversation between KP and Virat Kohli:</p>
<p>MS Dhoni trolled on-air commentator Kevin Pietersen</p>
<p>This was not the first time this incident was brought into the limelight. Dhoni himself had once trolled Pietersen on the same.</p>
<p>It happened during a match between MS Dhoni’s Rising Pune Supergiant and Mumbai Indians in IPL 2017. Kevin Pietersen was preforming his commentary duties in that match. In between the match, KP requested on mic fielder Manoj Tiwari to give a message to his skipper MS Dhoni.</p>
<p>Kevin said, “Can you do me a favor? Can you just whisper MS that I’m a better golfer than him.”</p>
<p>Manoj Tiwari passed on this message to Dhoni who further replied to KP in his usual comical self.</p>
<p>Dhoni answered in the stump mic, “He is still my first Test wicket.”</p>
<p>Check a video of this banter:

Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni form the core of Wasim Jaffer&rsquo;s all time ODI XI. (Twitter Photo)</p>
<p>Former India batsman Wasim Jaffer picked his all-time ODI team and picked four Indian players including MS Dhoni as its skipper.</p>
<p>Jaffer picked Sachin Tendulkar and Rohit Sharma as the opening pair. The number three spot was bagged by West Indian Vivian Richards and current Indian skipper Virat Kohli was given number four spot.</p>
<p>South African versatile batsman AB De Villiers and England all-rounder Ben Stokes was given chance to boost the middle-order batting.</p>
<p>Dhoni was named as skipper and wicket-keeper batsman while bowling attack included former Pakistan pacer Wasim Akram, former Windies pacer Joel Garner, and former Australian pacer Glen McGrath.There is a tie between two great bowlers Saqlain Mushtaq and Shane Warne for the one spinner&rsquo;s spot.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Australia&rsquo;s most successful captain Ricky Ponting has been picked as 12th man by Jaffer in his ODI side. Ponting captained Australia to two consecutive World Cup titles in 2003 and 2007.
