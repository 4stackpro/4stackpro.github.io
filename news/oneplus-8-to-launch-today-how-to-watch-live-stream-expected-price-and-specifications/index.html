OnePlus 8 series launch event is set for today. At the event, the OnePlus 8 Pro and OnePlus 8 phones are expected. The company is hosting a global online event, wherein it will reveal prices, availability, and specification details of the two phones. According to leaks, the OnePlus 8 Pro is expected to sport a quad camera setup at the back, while the OnePlus8 is tipped to come with triple rear cameras. The phones will be powered by the Snapdragon 865 SoC, and support 5G. The company has also confirmed 120Hz display refresh rate on the two phones.</p>
<p>OnePlus 8 Pro, OnePlus 8: Live stream link, expected price</p>
<p>OnePlus 8 Pro and OnePlus 8 launch event will begin at 8:30pm IST today. The event will be live streamed on the OnePlus official website and via YouTube as well. As per leaks, the OnePlus 8 Pro is rumoured to be priced between EUR 919 and EUR 929 (roughly Rs. 76,000-76,900) in Europe for the 8GB RAM + 128GB storage configuration, while its 12GB RAM + 256GB storage model could be priced between EUR 1,009 and EUR 1,019 (roughly Rs. 83,500-84,400).</p>
<p>The OnePlus 8 launching price tag is said to start between EUR 719 and EUR 729 (roughly Rs. 59,500-60,400) for the 8GB RAM + 128GB storage option in Europe. However, the top-end 12GB RAM + 256GB storage variant of the OnePlus 8 is rumoured to be priced between EUR 819 and EUR 829 (roughly Rs. 67,800-68,700).</p>
<p>In a recent interview, CEO Pete Lau has confirmed that the OnePlus 8 series of phones won&rsquo;t cost more than $1,000 (roughly Rs. 76,400). This suggests that the most expensive OnePlus 8 series phone will still be cheaper than the base Samsung Galaxy S20 5G option that starts at $999.99 (roughly Rs. 76,400). The India price of the two phones should fall in the same range, barring government taxes and duties.</p>
<p>OnePlus has also announced that it will host an online pop-up event for OnePlus fans in Europe, but there are no details regarding any such event in India. Also teased to launch alongside the smartphones are the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z headphones. You can watch the live stream of the event in the embedded video below:</p>
<p>OnePlus 8 Pro, OnePlus 8: design (rumoured)</p>
<p>Lau has teased that OnePlus 8 series would be thinner and lighter compared to the previous-generation OnePlus phones. It is set to offer its fifth-generation matte-frosted glass finish on the new smartphones, and while the design will be attractive, the phone will also be comfortable to grip. The OnePlus 8 Pro is leaked to come in Onyx Black, Glacial Green, and Ultramarine Blue colour options, while the OnePlus 8 is tipped to come in Glacial Green, Interstellar Glow, and Onyx Black models. More options may become official at launch.</p>
<p>Leaked renders suggest that the OnePlus 8 Pro will have a quad camera setup at the back and a hole-punch display. The cutout will be placed on the top left of the screen, and there will be little to no bezels on all sides of the display. The camera module will be positioned in the top centre of the back panel, with three sensors aligned vertically and one on the side. The phone is also seen to include laser autofocus and a dual-tone flash.</p>
<p>The OnePlus 8, on the other hand, is leaked to sport triple rear sensors at the back. Apart from the lack of one sensor, the design of the OnePlus 8 is similar to that of the Pro variant.</p>
<p>OnePlus 8 Pro, OnePlus 8: Specifications (rumoured)</p>
<p>The company has been teasing few features of the phone running up to the launch. The OnePlus 8 series is confirmed to offer 5G support, come with a 120Hz Fluid Display, and be powered by the Snapdragon 865 SoC. The OnePlus 8 phones will offer UFS 3.0 flash storage just like the predecessors, but with added software additions like Turbo Write and Host Performance Booster (HPB) to ramp up read and write speeds even more.</p>
<p>The phones are also teased to incorporate LPDDR5 RAM, bringing faster transfer rate while reducing power consumption. The two phones can reach a transfer rate of 6,400Mbps at a bandwidth as high as 51.2GB/s. LPDDR5 also brings 45 percent lower power consumption when compared with the previous LPDDR4 generation.</p>
<p>Coming to leaks, the OnePlus 8 Pro is tipped to feature a 6.78-inch QHD+ Super AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate. It is expected to offer 8GB and 12GB RAM options. Internal storage options will include 128GB and 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage. As for cameras, the OnePlus 8 Pro quad rear setup is tipped to include two 48-megapixel cameras, one 8-megapixel camera, and a fourth 5-megapixel sensor. Up front there will be a 16-megapixel selfie camera.</p>
<p>The phone is expected to pack 4,510mAh battery with 30W Warp Charge 30T and Warp Charge 30 Wireless wireless charging support as well. The company recently made the latter official ahead of the big launch event today. Furthermore, it will also support 3W reverse wireless charging and IP68 water and dust resistance.</p>
<p>The vanilla OnePlus 8 is rumoured to feature a smaller 6.55-inch full-HD+ Super AMOLED display with 90Hz refresh rate. It has a triple camera setup with a 48-megapixel main sensor, a 16-megapixel secondary sensor, and a 2-megapixel tertiary sensor. Up front, the phone is listed to sport a 16-megapixel selfie camera just like the OnePlus 8 Pro. The phone packs a smaller 4,300mAh battery with 30W Warp Charge 30T support.</p>

<h3 id="why-the-iphone-9-and-oneplus-8-are-needed-now-more-than-foldable-phones">Why the iPhone 9 and OnePlus 8 are needed now more than foldable phones</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5ef0585ea85feb83774e66b19e150e6c-1200-80.jpg" alt="img">
Around this time of year we’re usually eager to see the big, flashy flagship phones that were introduced at MWC finally reach the public. But this is no ordinary year, and the outbreak of Covid-19 hasn’t just caused the cancellation of MWC 2020 and other tech shows, and messed with phone releases – it’s disrupted lives all over the world.</p>
<p>Which makes the iPhone 9 and OnePlus 8 far more important phones for consumers than premium flagships, including the foldable phones the industry has been championing as the next generation of handset technology. Even if the Samsung Galaxy Fold 2 comes out later this year as rumored, average consumers probably won&rsquo;t be lining up to buy it. After all, the first Galaxy Fold cost $1,980 / £1,900 / AU$2,900 launch price.</p>
<p>It’s no secret that both the iPhone 9 and OnePlus 8 are expected to be revealed in this week, and they couldn’t come at a better time. With the slowdown in economic activity resulting in higher unemployment and interrupted cash flows for many consumers, affordability has suddenly become a lot more important - and if you can get cutting-edge features at a discount, that’s even better.</p>
<p>The iPhone 9 and OnePlus 8 represent two approaches to solve this problem: Apple&rsquo;s new iPhone has the potential to offer essential features at low cost, while OnePlus looks set to create a true budget flagship with 5G connectivity.</p>
<p>(Image credit: Future)</p>
<p>The iPhone 9: Apple’s return to affordability</p>
<p>The iPhone 9 will supposedly take after the iPhone SE as a phone that forgoes top-end features for the essentials: one rear camera, one front camera, Touch ID, a higher-end A13 chipset, and access to iOS, all in a smaller 4.7-inch display format with, yes, huge top-and-bottom bezels.</p>
<p>The iPhone 9, as rumored, would already have fit the needs of plenty of people – and if it hovers close to the iPhone SE launch price of $399 / £379 / AU$679 it would certainly be a solid option for those looking for affordable functionality, and for folks who just need a device to hold them over until the economy picks up again.</p>
<p>While the iPhone 8 has met this need, it’s been on the market for two and a half years, and it wasn’t even much of an upgrade over the previous year’s iPhone 7. The iPhone 9 may pack some of the software enhancements of the subsequent generations, like the iPhone 11 line’s spectacular night photography mode.</p>
<p>The OnePlus 8: affordable 5G</p>
<p>(Image credit: Future)</p>
<p>Assuming the OnePlus 8 isn’t much pricier than its predecessor – the OnePlus 7T cost $599 / £549 (around AU$937) at launch – it could be the first budget flagship released in 2020, since the Samsung Galaxy S20 line didn’t include a cheaper model.</p>
<p>If the OnePlus 7T and OnePlus 7 are anything to go by, the new phone will have top-end specs at a discount: one leak suggests 8GB or 12GB of RAM with 128GB or 256GB of storage, putting it solidly on par with other flagship phones.</p>
<p>Given the OnePlus 8 is suspected to be 5G-capable, it could be the cheapest 5G phone in many markets, too. That means the OnePlus 8 is a bit of a bit safer investment for folks who don’t want to have to trade in the phone they buy this year just to connect to a 5G network in 2021 or later.</p>
<p>Sometimes, progress means staying in place</p>
<p>It’s not that we’re unexcited about foldables and other cutting-edge technologies; we just know they’re suddenly a lot less important than the phones that will get us all through 2020.</p>
<p>OnePlus’s strategy of keeping its budget flagship models low-cost happens to be suited for this moment, while Apple’s long-awaited iPhone 9 couldn’t launch at a better time. Regardless, both phones are the best we could get at this moment – and until more phones launch in this mid-range/budget flagship niche, we could see these two become a lot more popular through the end of the year and beyond.

<h3 id="oneplus-8-8-pro-full-specs-leak-price-to-start-at-around-rs-60000">OnePlus 8, 8 Pro full specs leak, price to start at around Rs 60,000</h3>
<p><img src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202004/OnePlus_8_Pro_1-647x363.png?dYrGOYv5E0tdx88DOz_m9BsDCqwtdK7l" alt="img">
Much like its predecessors, the OnePlus 8 series phones have been the subject of countless leaks and rumours in the lead up to their launch. However, the two phones &ndash; OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 8 Pro &ndash; have now received their biggest leak to date, with their entire spec sheet and price tags also being revealed.</p>
<p>With the new leak, we now have a better idea of what the two will bring to the table, and also how they will differ from each other in price, internals and features. The new information comes courtesy of a European retailer giving us a hint about what the price of the devices could be in India when they are officially launched on April 14.</p>
<p>OnePlus 8, OnePlus 8 Pro: Leaked price</p>
<p>The company has been steadily increasing the prices of its phones in the last few years, and if the leak is anything to go by, the trend is set to continue this year too. However, the jump is being said to be the biggest this year.</p>
<p>The leak claims the OnePlus 8 will start a price of Euro 719 (approx Rs 60,000) for the 8GB RAM and 128GB storage mode, with the 12GB RAM+256GB storage variant being made available for Euro 819 (approx Rs 68,000)</p>
<p>The OnePlus 8 Pro is also expected to become quite a bit expensive, with the entry 8GB RAM+128GB storage entry variant likely to start retail at Euro 919 (approx Rs 75,000). The top-end variant with 12GB RAM and 256GB storage is tipped to be more expensive, and retail for Euro 1,009 (approx Rs 83,000).</p>
<p>If these prices do end up being true, it would represent a significant jump for OnePlus devices in India, with the OnePlus 7T being launched in India at price closer to the Rs 40k mark, while more expensive OnePlus 7T Pro announced in India at Rs 53,999.</p>
<p>OnePlus 8, OnePlus 8 Pro: Leaked specs</p>
<p>As for the specs, OnePlus&rsquo; new phones have already been confirmed to come with a Snapdragon 865 SoC, paired to up to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage on both models. However, today&rsquo;s leak reveals that the 256GB option will not be available in all color variants.</p>
<p>On the outside, the OnePlus 8 will come with a 6.55-inch FullHD+ 90Hz Fluid AMOLED display, with an aspect ratio of 20:9 and a pixel density of 402ppi. The OnePlus 8 Pro is tipped to get a 6.78-inch QHD+ 120Hz Fluid AMOLED panel, with a pixel density of 513ppi and an aspect ratio of 19.8:9.</p>
<p>The cameras are in line with previous leaks which claimed the device will get a triple camera setup, comprising of 48-megapixel primary lens sat next to a 16-megapixel lens and 2-megapixel camera. On the other hand, the OnePlus 8 Pro will sport a quad-camera setup comprised of a 48-megapixel lens, an 8-megapixel lens and a 5-megapixel unit.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the main lens on the OnePlus 8 will be an IMX586 sensor, while the primary lens on the 8 Pro will be a Sony IMX689. The leak also claims the OnePlus 8 Pro will feature 3D Audio Zoom and have a flicker sensor in tow.</p>
<p>Apart from this, there will also be wireless charging support on the OnePlus 8 Pro, with the two phones also supporting WiFi 6, NFC, Bluetooth 5.1, and USB-C connectivity.
