WEST HAM have opened talks with Alexis Sanchez&rsquo;s agent over a proposed move for the Manchester United flop, according to reports.</p>
<p>The Chile striker, 31, is currently in limbo, with loan club Inter Milan seemingly rejecting the chance to sign him permanently.</p>
<p>West Ham have reportedly enquired about Sanchez&rsquo;s situation amid reports Inter do not want to make his loan move permanent</p>
<p>That looks to have paved the way for Sanchez to return to Old Trafford - although United are said to be desperate to sell the £505,000-a-week ex-Arsenal man.</p>
<p>West Ham are now looking to make the most of the situation, albeit by offering Sanchez - due a £1.1million loyalty payment from United in July - a much smaller pay packet.</p>
<p>Sport Witness cite reports in Italy which say Inter view keeping Sanchez - who has scored just once since joining Antonio Conte&rsquo;s side last August - as &ldquo;unthinkable&rdquo;.</p>
<p>With the world transfer market set to take a marked downturn in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the Irons could land Sanchez on the cheap.</p>
<p>The report claims that agent Fernando Felicevich has received a call from Hammers hierarchy requesting &ldquo;information&rdquo; on Sanchez&rsquo;s situation.</p>
<p>Although it is further reported that, so far, that is the extent of the interest.</p>
<p>Even if Sanchez were to cut his wages in half, a player on £250,000-a-week would be out of the Hammers&rsquo; price range.</p>
<p>Forward Andriy Yarmolenko is thought to be the club&rsquo;s highest paid player on around £115,000 a week.</p>
<p>If a move to London does not materialise then Sanchez could be on his way back to South America.</p>
<p>His former club Colo Colo and Argentina giants River Plate are both said to be weighing up a possible £17m move for the forward.

<h3 id="jose-mourinhos-worst-signings-with-chelsea-manchester-united-real-madrid-and-inter-milan">Jose Mourinho&rsquo;s worst signings with Chelsea, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Inter Milan</h3>
<p><img src="https://talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/04/TALKSPORT-MOURINHO-FLOPS.jpg?strip=all&amp;quality=100&amp;w=1200&amp;h=800&amp;crop=1" alt="img">
Jose Mourinho has managed some of the top clubs in Europe and enjoyed success at nearly every club he has been at.</p>
<p>He has won eight league titles in four different countries and won the Champions League with two different clubs.</p>
<p>AFP or licensors 13 Jose Mourinho has spent more than £1billion on transfers</p>
<p>In 2017, he became the first manager to spend £1billion on transfers but not all of those have been entirely successful.</p>
<p>During his career at Porto, Chelsea (twice), Inter Milan, Real Madrid and Manchester United there have been some questionable decisions.</p>
<p>Mourinho is now the manager of Tottenham, and only had one transfer window, so there is plenty of time to add to this.</p>
<p>Here at talkSPORT.com, we have made an XI out of the worst signings made during his career so far.</p>
<p>Jason Cundy can’t understand why Tottenham even appointed Jose Mourinho - They chose someone Chelsea and Man United sacked in identical fashion</p>
<p>Goalkeeper – Emiliano Viviano</p>
<p>Mourinho has worked with some outstanding goalkeepers during his career including Petr Cech, Iker Casillas and David De Gea.</p>
<p>Viviano was signed by Inter in 2009 while Mourinho was manager as part of a co-ownership deal also involving Brescia and Bologna.</p>
<p>He never played a game for Inter and joined Palermo in 2011.</p>
<p>Getty Images - Getty 13 Emiliano Viviano never played a game for Inter Milan</p>
<p>Right-back – Khalid Boulahrouz</p>
<p>The versatile defender, nicknamed the ‘Cannibal’, signed for Chelsea in 2006 for a staggering £8.5million.</p>
<p>He was quickly dropped from the side due to poor performances and was sold to Stuttgart two years later for only around half the fee they paid.</p>
<p>13 Khalid Boulahrouz never lived up to his ‘Cannibal’ nickname</p>
<p>Left-back – Fabio Coentrao</p>
<p>The defender cost Real Madrid £27m in 2011 from Benfica and they signed him to a massive six-year deal. That price made him the second most expensive defender ever at the time.</p>
<p>He certainly did not live up to that tag and his Madrid career was plagued by injury and inconsistency.</p>
<p>His worst moment came in 2012 when he was sent off from the substitutes bench for insulting the referee in a game against Getafe.</p>
<p>13 Fabio Coentrao failed to impress with Real Madrid</p>
<p>Centre-back – Papy Djilobodji</p>
<p>Signed by Mourinho in his second spell at Chelsea, the Senegalese defender cost around £2.7m from Nantes.</p>
<p>He clearly was not up to scratch as he made just one substitute cup appearance before being sent on loan to Werder Bremen.</p>
<p>Just a year after they signed him, Sunderland, for some reason, paid £8m for the defender and were lumbered with him until 2018 when he was sacked for breaching his contract and failing a fitness test.</p>
<p>Getty Images - Getty 13 Papy Djilobodji was sold to Sunderland after failing to impress at Chelsea</p>
<p>Centre-back – Tal Ben Haim</p>
<p>Initially signed as a back-up in 2007, Ben Haim found himself as a first team regular thanks to injuries to John Terry and Ricardo Carvalho.</p>
<p>Mourinho unexpectedly left Chelsea just months after Ben Haim joined and he did not get on with his replacement Avram Grant.</p>
<p>The Israeli claimed he was signed to be a first-choice player… even though he was really fourth choice.</p>
<p>Getty Images - Getty 13 Jose Mourinho left shortly after signing Tal Ben Haim</p>
<p>Central midfield – Steve Sidwell</p>
<p>A strange move from Mourinho in 2007. Sidwell signed as a free agent from Reading and insisted he was not there to make up the numbers but felt he could compete with Frank Lampard and Michael Essien.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, he struggled to establish himself in the side and was sold the next season.</p>
<p>Getty Images - Getty 13 Steve Sidwell was a surprising signing for Chelsea</p>
<p>Central midfield – Nuri Sahin</p>
<p>The Turkish ace was signed from Borussia Dortmund to Real Madrid in 2011 for around £8.5m but failed to show any of the qualities that made him a success in the Bundesliga.</p>
<p>He made just four LaLiga appearances before being sent out on loan to Liverpool and then back to Dortmund.</p>
<p>13 Nuri Sahin barely played for Real Madrid</p>
<p>Right midfield – Ricardo Quaresma</p>
<p>Mourinho signed the midfielder from Inter Milan in 2008 from Porto but he was less than complimentary about him</p>
<p>“He is a great talent, but the joy I have at seeing the way Ibra works for and with the team I do not yet have with Quaresma.</p>
<p>“He will have to learn, otherwise he won’t play, and I am sure he’ll change and become more tactically disciplined. He likes kicking the ball with the outside of his foot, but if you ask me about him in a few months’ time, we’ll be talking about a different Quaresma.”</p>
<p>Mourinho managed to offload him to Chelsea on loan following a disastrous season.</p>
<p>AFP - Getty 13 Ricardo Quaresma was disappointing for Inter Milan</p>
<p>Left midfield – Alexis Sanchez</p>
<p>On paper it was a good signing for Manchester United. Sanchez had been a star for Arsenal and Barcelona and to get him on a swap deal for Henrikh Mkhitaryan seemed like a good bit business.</p>
<p>His base salary was believed to be £350,000-a-week, and up to £500,000-a-week with bonuses, but he scored just five times in 45 appearances.</p>
<p>Sanchez is currently out on loan at Inter Milan and even though Mourinho was sacked by United more than a year ago, they are still paying the price for this woeful move.</p>
<p>Getty Images - Getty 13 Alexis Sanchez endured a torrid time in Manchester</p>
<p>Striker – Mateja Kezman</p>
<p>Kezman was signed by Chelsea in 2004 for £5.3m from PSV but scored just four goals in 25 games before being sold by the club.</p>
<p>He moved to Atletico Madrid after making little impact at Stamford Bridge.</p>
<p>13 Mateja Kezman spent just one season at Stamford Bridge</p>
<p>Striker – Andriy Shevchenko</p>
<p>The Blues had long been pursuing Shevchenko and eventually landed their man for £30.8m in 2006.</p>
<p>He failed to show the prolific goalscoring record he had shown for AC Milan and Dynamo Kiev earlier in his career.</p>
<p>He netted just nine goals in 48 Premier League games for the club before eventually rejoining Kiev.</p>
<p>Getty Images - Getty 13 Andriy Shevchenko struggled to score at Chelsea

<h3 id="man-utd-chief-ed-woodward-has-alexis-sanchez-concern-over-antoine-griezmann-transfer">Man Utd chief Ed Woodward has &lsquo;Alexis Sanchez concern&rsquo; over Antoine Griezmann transfer</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/67/750x445/1265182.jpg" alt="img">
Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward will be concerned Antoine Griezmann could potentially turn out like Alexis Sanchez has if he joins the Old Trafford club, claims transfer expert Ian McGarry. United are once again linked with a move for Griezmann after missing out on the France international two years ago.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old has struggled in his first season at Barcelona since his £107million arrival from Atletico Madrid, scoring just eight goals in 26 La Liga appearances. Griezmann is the same age Sanchez was when he left Arsenal for United in January 2018 in a swap deal that saw Henrikh Mkhitaryan head in the opposite direction. The Chilean immediately became the highest paid player at United at the time, earning a reported £400,000-a-week. However, Sanchez was a shadow of the player that had previously lit up the Premier League with Arsenal in his first 18 months at United.

<p>Man Utd news: Ed Woodward is concerned Antoine Griezmann could turn out like Alexis Sanchez</p>
<p>The forward was sent out on loan to Inter Milan this season but is set to return to Old Trafford in the summer, with a permanent deal at the San Siro unlikely. So United are wary over splashing out on a 29-year-old again in the shape of Griezmann with the potential the transfer does not pay off. McGarry said on the Transfer Window podcast: &ldquo;The one thing that both Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, although he wasn&rsquo;t in charge at the time when Alexis Sanchez was signed, and Manchester United will be looking at is once bitten twice shy, &lsquo;we don&rsquo;t want to get to the point where we&rsquo;re putting a player on big wages like we did with Sanchez only to find out he doesn&rsquo;t settle, he&rsquo;s not happy and he we end up with a player who simply doesn&rsquo;t perform to his potential&rsquo;. &ldquo;So my advice to Ed Woodward would be to just have a check with Antoine about his dog situation now and ensure that he&rsquo;s got plenty of space to walk his dogs if indeed he has any and you&rsquo;ll avoid yourself any further potential upset with regards to the player&rsquo;s wellbeing, both mentally and socially.&rdquo; DON&rsquo;T MISS</p>
