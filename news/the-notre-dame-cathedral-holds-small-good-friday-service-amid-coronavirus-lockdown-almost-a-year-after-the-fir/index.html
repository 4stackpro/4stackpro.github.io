(CNN) Nearly a year after a massive blaze devastated the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, only seven people attended a special televised Good Friday service at the 850-year-old church.</p>
<p>The ceremony began Friday morning, with Paris Archbishop Michel Aupetit entering the cathedral and presenting an important relic, the Crown of Thorns of Christ, which survived the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A year ago, the cathedral was destroyed. Today the country is ravaged by a pandemic. There&rsquo;s always a message of hope, and this celebration at the heart of the cathedral will be the sign of our hope,&rdquo; Aupetit told CNN affiliate BFMTV before the service,.</p>
<p>The 40-minute Good Friday service also featured classical musician Renaud Capuçon playing the violin. Actors Philippe Torreton and Judith Chemla, who also sang, delivered readings of Christian texts.</p>

<p>The small group, some wearing masks and hazmat suits, held the ceremony in a secured part of the cathedral in front of a large cross and under a hole in the cathedral&rsquo;s roof.</p>

<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/10/world/10virus-friday1/10virus-friday1-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
Pope Francis usually joins tens of thousands of faithful at Rome’s Colosseum for a traditional Good Friday procession that solemnly evokes the Stations of the Cross leading up to Christ’s crucifixion.</p>
<p>But on this Good Friday, like Christians all around the world, Francis is staying at home, where he will preside over a ceremony in front of an empty St. Peter’s Square.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic is forcing Christians to forgo the usual processions and sacred church services. Instead, national lockdowns have relegated participation for the faithful to following along on television or livestreams.</p>
<p>In Jerusalem, few people stopped to kneel outside the often-packed Church of the Holy Sepulcher, built on the site where the faithful believe Jesus was crucified, buried and rose from the dead. In Spain, where deaths have surpassed 15,000, the elaborate platforms carrying religious statues in processions are gone, as are the crowds they typically draw.

Good Friday remembers the death of Jesus (Picture: Joe Raedle/Getty)</p>
<p>The Easter weekend is here and offers a time of reflection and repentance to those of Christian faith.</p>
<p>The period is one of the most religious in the calendar and commemorates the life, death and resurrection of Jesus.</p>
<p>Lent this year began on 26 February and saw Christians fast or abstain from indulgences for the past 40 days.</p>
<p>Good Friday, Easter Sunday and Easter Monday all fall within the last week of Lent – known as the Holy Week – and here’s what you need to know about the first of those days.</p>
<p>What is Good Friday?</p>
<p>Good Friday sees Christians remember the trial and death of Jesus on the cross.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, Jesus was arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane after being betrayed by Judas.</p>
<p>Jesus was made to carry his own cross (Picture: Francis G. Mayer/Getty)</p>
<p>He had spent the previous evening, Maundy Thursday, with his 12 disciples at the Last Supper.</p>

<p>Following his arrest, Jesus taken to the House of Annas where he was interrogated, flogged and sentenced to death.</p>
<p>He was then made to carry his own cross to the site of his execution where he was then crucified.</p>
<p>How did Good Friday get its name?</p>
<p>With the day being observed as one of sorrow and penance, it’s hard to understand why it would come to be known as Good Friday.</p>
<p>There are many theories behind the etymology, a popular one being the term good adapted from the word god – thus God’s Friday.</p>
<p>However the most accepted derivation of the name come from the obsolete adjective good, which often described something that was regarded as holy or pious by the Church.</p>
<p>This is apparent in the Christian greeting of ‘good tide’ at Christmas or on Shrove Tuesday.</p>
