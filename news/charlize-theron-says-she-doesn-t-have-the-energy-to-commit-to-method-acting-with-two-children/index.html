She won an Oscar for her intense portrayal of the serial killer Aileen Wuornos in 2003&rsquo;s chilling Monster.</p>
<p>Yet Charlize Theron says her days of going all in with method acting are over in an interview with the Mirror published Saturday.</p>
<p>The 44-year-old actress revealed that she doesn&rsquo;t have the energy for such intensive performances when she has &lsquo;two kids to raise&rsquo; and &lsquo;dog s*** to pick up in the backyard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Focusing on her family: Charlize Theron, 44, says her days of going all in with method acting are over due to the strains of family life in an interview with the Mirror published Saturday; pictured in February</p>
<p>Though Charlize rose to stardom thanks to her commitment to early performances, the experience was always freighted with anxiety for her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You worry, s***, this worked for Marlon Brando,&rsquo; she said, even if it didn&rsquo;t fill her with the same fulfillment.</p>
<p>Now, once the camera&rsquo;s are off, she&rsquo;s back to being the regular Charlize.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I go to my trailer, I take my make-up off and I go home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Too much: &lsquo;I don’t know how people stay in ­character. I’m too lazy. I’ve got two kids to raise and I have dog s*** to pick up in the backyard,&rsquo; she said of her daughters Jackson, eight, and August, four; shown with Jackson in 2015</p>
<p>Letting go: &lsquo;I learned pretty early on, the more I let go, the better — which, in the beginning, was harder for me — but now I’m very disciplined about it&rsquo;; pictured in 2018</p>
<p>Having two adopted daughters, Jackson, eight, and August, four, makes it difficult to bring her work home at the end of the day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don’t know how people stay in ­character. I’m too lazy. I’ve got two kids to raise and I have dog s*** to pick up in the backyard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don’t know how you do that in ­character. It’s exhausting. It’s so f***ing exhausting,&rsquo; she continued.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I learned pretty early on, the more I let go, the better — which, in the beginning, was harder for me — but now I’m very disciplined about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now, Charlize has adopted an early rise schedule to stay in tune with her children.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I get up with them at 5:30 a.m. every day. I make them breakfast and pack their lunches. On weekends, we hang out with family and friends. I’ll cook lasagne or steak,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>Top of her game: Despite her abandonment of method acting, Charlize was still praised for her engrossing performance as Megyn Kelly in 2019&rsquo;s Bombshell</p>
<p>Unrecognizable: The actress won an Oscar for her chilling performance as serial killer Aileen Wuornos in 2003&rsquo;s Monster</p>
<p>Even if she has sworn off some of the Hollywood orthodoxy, there hasn&rsquo;t been any diminishment in Charlize&rsquo;s talents.</p>
<p>The actress was lauded for her role in last year&rsquo;s Bombshell, about former Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes&rsquo; campaign of sexual harassment at the news network.</p>
<p>Theron starred as the controversial anchor Megyn Kelly and wowed audiences and critics with her engrossing performance, in which she was nearly unrecognizable thanks to impressive makeup and facial prosthetics.</p>
<p>She also had to lower her voice to approximate Kelly&rsquo;s tone.</p>
<p>Committed: Charlize recounted damaging her vocal cords after adopting a lower voice to mimic Kelly in Bombshell; pictured with John Lithgow as Roger Ailes</p>
<p>&lsquo;Megyn speaks really fast and in a very deep register. I had to take three weeks off because I busted my vocal cords. I relate to Megyn’s ambition and drive,&rsquo; she explained.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I relate to that and also how those qualities can be turned on you so quickly if you step a little out of place.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The bottom line is sexual harassment is not an easy ­conversation to have, nor is it an easy choice to come forward and speak out, because you’re probably going to get ostracized and pay a huge price,&rsquo; she continued.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But thank God, we’ve had women strong enough to make that decision and to put themselves out there, because without that, I don’t think this conversation would be happening now. I want all women to be safe. That was ultimately what the story is about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Charlize was nominated for an Academy Award for the performance, though she lost out on the big night to Renee Zellweger for her portrayal of another real-life figure, Judy Garland.</p>
<p>Fan of the baddies: Though she has played plenty of lead roles, the actress has also carved out a specialty playing villains; still from Monster</p>
<p>Having a blast: &lsquo;I’ve built a career on playing people you don’t like,&rsquo; she said of her role in 2017&rsquo;s The Fate Of The Furious</p>
<p>Though she has played plenty of lead roles, the actress has also carved out a specialty playing villains, like her deceptive executive in 2012&rsquo;s Prometheus and the cyberterrorist Cipher in 2017&rsquo;s The Fate Of The Furious.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I’ve built a career on playing people you don’t like.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For me, it’s a very personal connection that I have to find with the person I’m playing. It has to make sense. I have to get to a place where I can say &ldquo;This makes sense. This emotional human in front of me, I relate, I understand.&quot;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Charlize will next be seen in the upcoming ninth installment of the Fast &amp; Furious series, which is expected to premiere in 2021.

She’s been spotted out and about with her daughters in recent days even as businesses in Los Angeles have shut down due to coronavirus fears.</p>
<p>Charlize Theron stepped out again Friday for a quick trip to the grocery store to stock up on essential supplies.</p>
<p>The 44-year-old Bombshell star showed off a sporty look as she shopped with her young daughters Jackson, eight, and August, three.</p>
<p>Charlize Theron, 44, stepped out with her daughters Jackson, eight, and August, three, on Friday as they stocked up on groceries in Beverly Hills</p>
<p>Charlize covered up on the chilly day in a black down North Face coat over a charcoal T-shirt and matching leggings.</p>
<p>The Long Shot star wore a sleek pair of black Nike trainers and covered up her blonde pixie cut with a black North Face trucker hat while rocking a makeup-free look.</p>
<p>Jackson mirrored her mother’s sporty style with a salmon sweatshirt, lavender shorts and pink and blue Nike athletic shoes.</p>
<p>August wore a cute silver jacket with black pants and multicolored tennis shoes as Charlize did her best to carry her into the grocery store.</p>

<p>Charlize revealed last year to Daily Mail that Jackson, who was introduced as a boy, was actually a transgender girl</p>
<p>Charlize adopted Jackson, who was born in South Africa, in 2012, and she adopted the US-born August in 2015, shortly after her split from fellow actor Sean Penn.</p>
<p>Jackson was originally introduced to the world as a boy, but Charlize revealed last year that she’s actually a transgender girl.</p>
<p>She told Daily Mail: &lsquo;I thought she was a boy, too. Until she looked at me at three years old and said, &ldquo;I am not a boy!&quot;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So there you go! I have two beautiful daughters who, just like any parent, I want to protect and I want to see thrive.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They were born who they are and exactly where in the world both of them get to find themselves as they grow up, and who they want to be, is not for me to decide,’ she said.</p>

<p>The Tully star has high profile roles coming up in the comic book adaptation The Old Guard, as well as the Fast &amp; Furious sequel F9, slated for 2021</p>
<p>Charlize seems to have slowed down her acting pace a bit recently, but she had high profile roles coming up in the comic book adaptation The Old Guard, which has already completed principal photography, as well as the Fast &amp; Furious sequel F9, which is slated to arrive in theaters next year.</p>
<p>It’s unclear if the coronavirus pandemic will push the release date back, as nearly all film and television productions have been indefinitely shuddered.</p>
<p>She was also announced to reprise her starring role in the John Wick–like action thriller Atomic Blonde 2, though the film hasn’t begun production yet.</p>
<p>In addition to acting, Charlize is continuing to expand her role as a film producer.</p>
<p>She’ll be producing both The Old Guard and Atomic Blonde 2, as well as the horror film Two Eyes Staring, a remake of a Duth movie which she’ll star in. Dr. Strange’s Scott Derrickson is expected to direct.</p>
<p>The actress and producer had a banner 2019 with roles in the critically approved comedy Long Shot, the Addams Family animated film and the Oscar-nominated Bombshell</p>
<p>The Oscar winner received renewed award buzz last year for her performance as former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly in the dramedy Bombshell, about former Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes’ campaign of sexual harassment and misconduct toward his female anchors and employees.</p>
<p>The movie, which also starred Nicole Kidman, Margot Robbie and John Lithgow, earned Academy Award nominations for Charlize’s lead portrayal of Kelly, as well as a supporting nod for Robbie.</p>
<p>The film only won the Best Makeup and Hairstyling award for the actors’ transformations into Kelly, Gretchen Carlson and Ailes.

<h3 id="charlize-theron-ist-genervt-ich-habe-hundescheiße-in-meinem-garten">Charlize Theron ist genervt: „Ich habe Hundescheiße in meinem Garten“</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.klatsch-tratsch.de/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/charlize-theron.jpg" alt="img">
Charlize Theron empfindet die Technik des „Method Acting“ als „kräfteraubend“. Der ‚Bombshell – Das Ende des Schweigens‘-Star mag die Schauspielmethode nicht besonders, bei der man die Charakterzüge der Figur, die man spielt, auch abseits des Filmsets beibehält.</p>
<p>Theron erklärte gegenüber der Tageszeitung ‚Daily Mirror‘, sie sei zu „faul“ und beschäftigt, um die Methode durchzuziehen. „Ich gehe zu meinem Wohnwagen, ich entferne mein Make-up und ich gehe nach Hause“, sagte sie.</p>
<p>Sie spielt gerne Menschen, die sie nicht mag</p>
<p>„Ich weiß nicht, wie Leute ihre Figur weiter spielen. Ich bin zu faul. Ich habe zwei Kinder zu erziehen und ich habe Hundesch**** in meinem Garten, die ich aufheben muss. Ich weiß nicht, wie man das in der Haut seiner Figur tut. Es ist kräfteraubend.“</p>
<p>Die südafrikanische Schauspielerin mag es hingegen sehr, eine „sehr persönliche Bindung“ zu ihren Charakteren aufzubauen und sie als Personen zu „verstehen“, wie sie weiter berichtete: „Ich habe eine Karriere darauf aufgebaut, Menschen zu spielen, die man nicht mag. Für mich ist es eine sehr persönliche Bindung, die ich mit der Person, die ich spiele, aufbauen muss. Es muss Sinn ergeben.“</p>
<p>Der Hauptfokus der 44-Jährigen sind ihre beiden Kinder. Deshalb dreht sich ihr Terminkalender komplett um August und Jackson.</p>
<p>„Ich stehe jeden Tag mit ihnen um 5:30 Uhr auf. Ich mache ihnen Frühstück und packe ihr Mittagessen ein. An den Wochenenden verbringen wir Zeit mit Familie und Freunden. Ich koche Lasagne oder Steak“, so Theron. Ein ganz normaler Familienalltag also…
