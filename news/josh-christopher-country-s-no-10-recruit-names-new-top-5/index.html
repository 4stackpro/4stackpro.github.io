One of the top recruits in the 2020 class took to social media to announce a new top five that poked fun at an elite program.</p>
<p>Josh Christopher, a five-star player from the state of California, announced the five finalists in his recruitment. The move comes just a few months after Christopher first announced his top five.</p>
<p>There’s only one change this time around and fans of that program won’t be happy with what he did to their logo. The five-star recruit crossed off Kentucky and substituted the Wildcats with USC.</p>
<p>The other four programs that remained on the list were: Arizona State, Michigan, Missouri, UCLA and USC. John Calipari and company can’t be happy to see their logo scratched out.</p>

<p>Juwan Howard and the Wolverines remain the favorites to land the top recruit, according to 247Sports’ Crystal Ball Predictions.</p>
<p>Christopher is the No. 10 overall recruit in the 2020 class and the No. 5 recruit from the state of California. He’s also the No. 3 shooting guard in the class.</p>
<p>He holds 21 offers in all, but the Wolverines are the overwhelming favorites in his recruitment so far.</p>
<p>The big winner on Tuesday night are the Trojans, who entered the top five of an elite recruit.

<h3 id="davids-bridal-guess-christopher--banks-furloughing-employees-cutting-expenses">David’s Bridal, Guess?, Christopher &amp; Banks furloughing employees, cutting expenses</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets1.chainstoreage.com/styles/primary_articles_short/s3/2020-03/Workforce_management_5.jpg?itok=KZM6Uj6Q" alt="img">
More retailers are furloughing employees and taking other measures to shore up liquidity as they extend store closings amid the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>Below are business updates from David&rsquo;s Bridal, Guess? and Christopher &amp; Banks.</p>
<p>David’s Bridal</p>
<p>The nation’s largest wedding-gown retailer emphasized that it continues to guarantee on-time delivery of all orders to meet customer event dates. David&rsquo;s Bridal&rsquo;s e-commerce activities will continue to operate normally, and the company said it has more than 300,000 dresses in stock in the U.S ready to ship immediately, and its distribution and fulfillment operations remain open.</p>
<p>Due to the uncertainty in the length of these closures and the timing of our ability to re-open our stores, David&rsquo;s Bridal will be:</p>
<p>• Executing a substantial reduction in expenses, capital expenditures and inventory commitments;</p>
<p>• Significantly reducing the salaries of the executive management team and board of directors as well as reducing the salaries of senior corporate and field employees; and</p>
<p>• Implementing a furlough program that will affect the vast majority of store employees and over 50% of the corporate workforce.</p>
<p>Guess</p>
<p>The apparel and accessories retailer is furloughing all of its U.S. and Canada store associates starting April 2, 2020. Store associates will receive pay for time scheduled from the beginning of the store closures through April 1 and the company will fund health insurance premiums during the furlough for all eligible associates impacted by these measures.</p>
<p>Guess is also furloughing approximately 50% of its U.S. and Canada corporate associates, and most of the associates at its distribution centers in the U.S. and Canada, starting April 2, 2020.</p>
<p>The company will fund health insurance premiums during the furlough for all eligible store employees as well as corporate and distribution center associates.</p>
<p>In other measures, Guess is:</p>
<p>• Implementing temporary tiered salary reductions for all management-level corporate employees in the U.S., ranging from 15% at lower levels to 70% for CEO Carlos Alberini and chief creative officer Paul Marciano;</p>
<p>• Deferring annual merit increases;</p>
<p>• Executing substantial reductions in expenses, store occupancy costs, capital expenditures and overall costs, including through reduced inventory purchases.</p>
<p>Christopher &amp; Banks Corp.</p>
<p>The company announced it is taking “proactive measures to conserve capital during this period of disruption” including:</p>
<p>• Implementation of furloughs for all store associates and over 60% of the remainder of its workforce. The employees on furlough will continue to receive employee benefits, including medical, dental, and vision benefits at this time;</p>
<p>• Temporary base salary reductions for corporate employees and management beginning with 20% and up to 50% for the CEO. The board has also agreed to a substantial reduction in retainer fees aligned with management;</p>
<p>• Suspension of approximately $3 million in planned capital expenditures; and</p>
<p>• Significant reduction in operating expenses</p>
<p>Customers may continue to shop through Christopher &amp; Bank’ e-commerce website. The company’s distribution center is running at limited capacity and in adherence with workplace safety, including social distancing and sanitation practices.

Pastor Christopher Ron Rhodes, 50, of 7559 Clymer-Center Road, Panama, NY., entered Jesus’ presence on March 28, 2020, at Select Specialty Care Hospital, Erie, Pa., after suffering complications from the flu on Feb. 8, 2020. He fought the good fight but took his last breath surrounded by his loving family.</p>
<p>He was born on Nov. 24, 1969 in Corry, Pa., a son of the late Ronald H. Rhodes and Rev. Jacqueline Rhodes of Clymer, NY.</p>
<p>Christopher loved the Lord and was pastor of Fentonville United Methodist Church for the past 15 years. He loved and cherished his church family. He also worked for Home Depot in Erie, Pa., and Lakewood, N.Y., for 20 years as an expeditor. He was awarded Expeditor of the Year in 2014. He was a member of Stephen Ministries. Chris was also a big sports fan. He was a very loyal Dallas Cowboys fan for 45 years. He was a founding member of the Clymer Rotisserie Fantasy Baseball leagues for 36 years, the longest running fantasy leagues in the country.</p>
<p>He enjoyed going to the movies, eating at restaurants, watching sporting events and taking trips to Gettysburg and Disney World. He enjoyed celebrating family reunions with his uncles, aunts and cousins. One of his greatest loves was helping raise Lilyanna Hamm and being her father figure. He also loved playing games and spending time with his nephews and nieces.</p>
<p>He enjoyed growing up in North Clymer, a close knit community in the country, living on the family dairy farm and spending time with his brothers and friends camping, fishing and playing wiffleball.</p>
<p>Christopher graduated from Edinboro University of Pennsylvania in 1992 with a bachelor’s degree in history. He was a four year player on the Rolling Scots football team. He was currently working on his ordination through Asbury Theological Seminary.</p>
<p>He was a graduate of Clymer Central School and loved his class of 1988. He was a member of the National Honor Society, chorus and marching band. He was also a manager for the Pirates football team for 4 years.</p>
<p>Despite being born with physical challenges, Christopher did not let that inhibit his living. Matthew 25:21 exemplifies the completeness of his life. “His lord said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant; you were faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.”</p>
<p>Christopher is survived by his former wife and caregiver, Susan Rhodes of Clymer, N.Y.; her daughter and his beloved Lilyanna Hamm; his mother, the Rev. Jacqueline Rhodes of Clymer, N.Y.; brothers: Mark (Rosetta) Rhodes of Corry, Pa., Gregory (Sharon) Rhodes of Chelsea, Mich., and Corey Rhodes of Clymer, N.Y.; nephews: Jason Rhodes, Daniel Rhodes, Mark (Megan) Rhodes II, Scott (Danielle) Rhodes and Jacob Rhodes; nieces: Jennifer Rhodes and Jo-Linda (Tanner) Propheter; and great-nephew: Lukas (Mark and Megan) Rhodes; and several uncles, aunts and cousins.</p>
<p>Christopher was preceded into Glory by his grandparents: the Rev. Alvin and Edna Rhodes, Walter and Mildred DeShazer and Hugh Damon; father, Ronald H. Rhodes; Uncle Troy &amp; Aunt Patty Chase, Uncle Donald Eschleman, Uncle Dick Poorman and Uncle Bill Craday; cousin, Billy Klingensmith, cousin, Darin Eshleman; college friends, John Snyder and Jeff Garlington’ and high school friend, Matthew Hull.</p>
<p>A celebration of life service will be held at a later date when the pandemic has subsided. He will be buried at Clymer-Center Cemetery this week.</p>
<p>In lieu of flowers please send donations to Fentonville United Methodist Church, North Clymer United Methodist Church or Samaritan’s Purse.</p>
<p>Arrangements by David J. Dengler, SPITZER Funeral Home, Clymer, N.Y.
