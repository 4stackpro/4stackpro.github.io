<p>Sushant Singh Rajput’s sudden death is yet to register among his fans and colleagues. The actor died by suicide on Sunday. Earlier this month, the actor had shared a post dedicated to his late mother on Instagram.</p>
<p>Sushant had shared a black and white collage of his picture and that of his mother’s on June 3 and wrote, “Blurred past evaporating from teardrops. Unending dreams carving an arc of smile. And a fleeting life, negotiating between the two&hellip;”</p>
<p>His rumoured girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty had dropped several red hearts in the comments section.</p>

<p>Around the release of his film Dhoni:The Untold Story, the actor had told DNA in an interview, “I wish she was alive to see me succeed in life. I am sure she would have been really happy and proud of me. And maybe I would have been a different person than what I am now. The way I looked at things then and now, they are very different and I cannot go back to doing that. It’s unfortunate. But everything that used to excite me, doesn’t excite me that much now. I don’t know why. No relationship, no success, absolutely nothing&hellip; If she was alive, probably it wouldn’t concern her, but just because something has changed inside me, everything has become so insipid. It takes a lot out of me to force myself to get overly excited about things and probably this is the reason why I like acting so much. Because it helps me get away from myself.”</p>

<p>He had earlier written a few poems in her memory. One of the poems read, “As long as you were, I was. Now just in your memories I come alive. Like a shadow, Just a flicker. Time doesn’t move here. It’s beautiful, It’s forever…” He also wrote, “Do you remember? You promised that you would be with me forever, and I promised you that I would keep smiling no matter what. It seems we both were wrong mother…”</p>
<p>Sushant was last seen in Nitesh Tiwari’s Chhichhore, which went on to become a blockbuster with collection of over Rs 100 crore at the domestic box office. He was also seen in Drive, which released on Netflix.</p>

वीडियो डेस्क। मशहूर एक्टर सुशांत सिंह राजपूत ने मुंबई में अपने घर में फांसी लगाकर जान दे दी है। वे 34 साल के थे. सुशांत बॉलीवुड के बेहद लोकप्रिय एक्टर थे। एक बार सुशांत सिंह की गर्लफ्रेंड अंकिता लोखंडे ने उन्हें सरेआम थप्पड़ जड़ दिया था। पिछले 5 साल से लिव इन रिलेशनशिप में रह रहे सुशांत और अंकिता किसी पार्टी में एक क्लब में साथ गए और वहां सुशांत ने कुछ ज्यादा ही शराब पी ली. सुशांत शराब के नशे में वहां मौजूद फीमेल फ्रेंड्स के साथ डांस करने लगे। अंकिता ने उन्हें कंट्रोल करने की कोशिश की लेकिन वह नहीं संभले। सुशांत और उनकी फीमेल फ्रेंड्स की बात जब आगे बढ़ने लगी तब अंकिता ने सुशांत को सभी के सामने तमाचा जड़ दिया। सुशांत अब इस दुनिया में नहीं हैं। सुशांत ने मौत का गले क्यों लगाया इस बात का अभी तक पता नहीं चला है।

Sushant Singh Rajput turned 34 today. And probably the first one to shower him with love on the occasion is his girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty. Needless to say, Rhea&rsquo;s birthday wish has found a place in the gossip columns. More than the adorable birthday wish for Sushant, her post has grabbed our attention for the fact that they have finally made their &ldquo;hush-hush affair&rdquo; Insta official.</p>
<p>Rhea, who has been reportedly dating Sushant for a year, took to Instagram to wish him a happy birthday. In her post, Rhea called Sushant a &ldquo;supermassive black hole&rdquo; and we wish we knew what that meant!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy birthday to the most beautiful &ldquo;supermassive black hole&rdquo; that is known to mankind! Shine on you crazy diamond @sushantsinghrajput #boywithagoldenheart #rheality,&rdquo; read Rhea&rsquo;s caption.</p>
<p>The actress shared two pictures with her boyfriend on the handle. In the first picture, the lovebirds can be seen sitting together on a bench at the park. While Rhea is making a weird face with her arm resting on his shoulder, Sushant is happily enjoying the moment with his lady love.</p>
<p>The second photo shows Rhea and Sushant on a boat against the backdrop of a sea, and it seems to have been clicked on a holiday.</p>
<p>Rhea and Sushant were holidaying together in Paris, Italy and Ladakh last year, glimpses of which went viral on social media thanks to several fan clubs. The couple shared solo photos of themselves from the vacations and ensured that they do not put out any picture where they are seen together. Except for one photo with their close friends.</p>
<p>Speaking of Sushant Singh Rajput, he has been tight-lipped about his relationship status to the extent of saying that he is single. At the India Today Mind Rocks Delhi 2019, the Chhichhore actor had said, &ldquo;I am single. I am not in a relationship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhea and Sushant have also been spotted by the paparazzi several times.</p>
<p>It was in May last year when a source close to Sushant Singh Rajput revealed that they are dating each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sushant is currently seeing Rhea Chakraborty. They have known each other for a while and they hit it off really well in the last few weeks. In fact, things moved from one thing to the other quite quickly and now, they are already dating each other,&rdquo; the source had said.</p>
<p>Talking about their hush-hush affair, the source added, &ldquo;Rhea and Sushant have been spending a lot of quality time nowadays. They are still calling each other &lsquo;good friends&rsquo; but the reality is that they are already seeing each other. When Sushant is not in town, he is chilling at his Lonavala house, Rhea also accompanies him sometimes. They are keeping their relationship hush-hush for now before taking it to the next level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Rhea, Sushant Singh Rajput has been linked with Kriti Sanon and Sara Ali Khan. But looks like Sushant has found his true love in Rhea Chakraborty.</p>

<p><img src="https://crickettimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Sushant-Singh-Rajput-Disha-Patani.png" alt="img">
The Indian film industry has lost yet another actor as Sushant Singh Rajput committed suicide at his residence in Mumbai, on Sunday (June 14).</p>
<p>While the Bollywood industry is still reeling with the passing away of Irrfan Khan and Rishi Kapoor, it has to now deal with yet another loss. Sushant was just 34 years old and was much loved for his performances on the small screen as well as in movies.</p>
<p>According to ANI, Sushant committed suicide at his Bandra residence by hanging himself, Additional Commissioner of Police (ACP) Dr Manoj Sharma confirmed. “Sushant Singh Rajput has committed suicide, Mumbai Police is investigating. Police has not found any note yet,” said DCP Pranay Ashok, spokesperson Mumbai Police.</p>
<p>Ever since the news of Sushant’s demise surfaced, social media has been flooded with messages of condolences from his fans and friends from all over the world. The actor’s co-star from ‘MS Dhoni: The Untold Story’ Disha Patani also reacted to the actor’s untimely demise. Disha didn’t write anything but uploaded an emoji of a broken heart.</p>
<p>💔 — Disha Patani (@DishPatani) June 14, 2020</p>
<p>In the movie, Disha played the role of Dhoni’s first girlfriend Priyanka Jha. Sushant and her introduction took place when the former was in the aeroplane during the home series against Pakistan. The duo had a friendly chat after which Disha said that Sushant would be having a great game next time.</p>
<p>In the very next ODI in Vizag, the Jharkhand-born Dhoni announced himself to the world and scored a sparkling century. Sushant and Disha’s relationship kept flourishing, but fate had some other plans for them. When Dhoni was away for the tour of Pakistan, Disha met with a car accident.</p>
<p>Her car was run over by a massive vehicle. On returning, Sushant’s friends were reluctant to give him the news. But when he got to know about the development, he got down from the car, sat on the road and cried. However, he shed the disappointment and moved ahead in his life.
