<p>Photo ops with politicians only went so far. State and local officials decided which companies got coveted licenses to operate and whether to treat the businesses in their backyards more like partners or adversaries. Cannabis firms needed real political clout.</p>
<p>In April 2018, former House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, joined the advisory board of Acreage Holdings, another cannabis firm.</p>
<p>Four months later, Former L.A. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa joined MedMen’s corporate board. Villaraigosa, a Democrat who has since left the board, declined to comment.</p>

<p>MedMen also hired lobbyists in Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, California, Nevada and New York, according to state disclosure databases.</p>
<p>Even with allies, in cannabis, everything was still harder. In one television appearance, Bierman spoke of navigating “the most arduous retail zoning restrictions known to man.”</p>
<p>Indeed, MedMen and its peers had to contend with layers of unique, untested regulations that, at times, were being enforced by people with active grudges against the industry.</p>
<p>“In some states, the city controls it and then the county has a say and then the state, and then the feds have their say in how you make it,” complained a former MedMen executive. “They’re all making the rules and changing them in real time. If I could tell you one story I could tell you a million.”</p>
<p>Take windows.</p>
<p>The former executive pointed to Florida, where MedMen first opened locations in Key West, Sarasota and West Palm Beach.</p>
<p>State law forbids cannabis shops from advertising, but in this new and controversial industry, the ban raised a whole slew of questions, the former executive said. “What is advertising? Is it the sign above your door?” As it turns out, no, the stores could have signs. But windows presented a problem. Passersby could look in from the streets and see MedMen branding inside. MedMen retooled its store concept to accommodate the law, removing visible branding from its interiors.</p>
<p>“This is a challenge for anyone.”</p>
<p>But then, the former executive recalled, regulators complained that “dispensing activity” taking place at the register—customers paying and staff handing them red bags with weed inside—remained visible from the outside. So, MedMen frosted its windows. Once the store interiors were hidden, they hung up MedMen-branded shirts for sale inside.</p>
<p>It turned out that frosted windows ran afoul of local police departments. So, the executive recalled, MedMen obtained permission from the state to restore its transparent windows. Regulators dropped their complaint about visible dispensing activity at the register but made MedMen take down its branded T-shirts.</p>
<p>It was determined that employees could still wear the shirts while working.</p>
<p>“It’s Kafka,” the former executive said. “It happens because the rules and regulations just don’t make sense.”</p>
<p>Then, there are the complications involved in financing a cannabis business.</p>
<p>Because of its legal status, institutional investors have, by and large, continued to shy away from it. Despite the growing number of states that have liberalized their cannabis laws and begun regulating their own markets, it remains on Schedule 1, the federal government’s list of banned narcotics. An Obama-era Justice Department policy officially discouraged prosecution of state-regulated marijuana activity, but former Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded that policy in 2018, raising the prospect of a renewed federal crackdown. The feared crackdown has not materialized, but Sessions’ rescission underscored the precariousness of the industry’s position.</p>
<p>Most banks will not even allow pot firms to open accounts out of fear of federal money-laundering laws. Those that offer their services do so quietly. Though MedMen has found banks to work with, a company spokesman told Yahoo News in 2018 that none of them wanted to be identified in the press.</p>
<p>It does not help, either, that cannabis firms face higher federal tax rates than others thanks to a provision of the tax code designed to prevent drug dealers from taking business deductions.</p>
<p>Las Vegas-based cannabis investor Leslie Bocskor said such restrictions often push cannabis operators to seek less savory sources of financing than they otherwise would need to. “We’ve created a gray market for money,” he said, “in the same way that we had a gray market for cannabis.”</p>
<p>Just providing customers a normal payment experience can be an ordeal. Rolling Stone reported that, for a time before MedMen went public, its stores accepted credit cards. It cloaked the practice from the card companies, which do not want to serve pot businesses, by registering under the name of an obscure corporate subsidiary. Now, the company no longer accepts credit, advertising that it takes debit cards and cash instead.</p>
<p>Because of federal securities law, those companies that manage to shimmy through this obstacle course and grow large enough to seek financing in the public markets have to go abroad to do so. Bocskor lays some of the blame for MedMen’s troubles at the feet of its unusual foreign IPO. Being forced to go public in Canada, rather than on an American exchange, he argues, hobbles companies by forcing them to navigate an unfamiliar regulatory landscape. He said it also makes the stock less accessible to U.S. investors, who can be uncomfortable with foreign markets.</p>
<p>“It’s not specific to MedMen,” Bocskor said. “This is a challenge for anyone.”</p>
<p>Chapter 6 Bad Comedown</p>
<p>MedMen’s headquarters sits in an industrial space on an unglamorous drag in Culver City, a section of L.A. inland from Venice Beach. Across the street are manufacturers of military-grade electronic components and protective equipment for industrial workers.</p>
<p>One cannabis executive who visited the headquarters in its prime was struck by the super high-end sports cars in the first two parking spots outside the entrance—out of place in both the neighborhood and in this still-modest industry.</p>
<p>Other hints of MedMen’s grand designs only became apparent inside, where the decor, all red metal and glass, betrayed Bierman’s ambitions to mimic tech startups.</p>
<p>In the go-go days of 2018, the office featured free snacks and other Silicon Valley-style perks. “It wasn’t over the top,” one former employee said. “Other than the kombucha machine. I found that a little strange.”</p>
<p>“They would ask themselves at times, ‘Are we a marijauana company or a tech company?’”</p>
<p>As MedMen raised ever more money, the headquarters grew more crowded, another departure from leanly staffed peers.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t believe it,” said another cannabis executive who visited the bustling headquarters. “What do all these people do?”</p>
<p>Two former executives said the firm maintained a small “culture group,” whose job it was to guide the company culture.</p>
<p>MedMen also regularly had a masseur visit the premises to pamper staffers, though one former employee said a peek at the man’s schedule revealed he sometimes would only have one session of 30 or 45 minutes booked per day.</p>
<p>There was a therapist on staff, called a “performance improvement expert”—who happened to be Bierman’s personal marriage counselor—at a salary of more than $300,000 a year, according to allegations later made in court and denied by MedMen.</p>
<p>The firm had also invested heavily in IT, building its own in-house point-of-sale system, MyMedMen.</p>
<p>“They would ask themselves at times, ‘Are we a marijauana company or a tech company?’” recalled the person, who viewed the expenditures as wasteful distractions from the firm’s core business, pointing to the founders’ lack of experience in the tech industry. “It was nuts. It was literally nuts.”</p>
<p>The market suspended its disbelief. In October of 2018, MedMen announced a deal to purchase PharmaCann, an Illinois-based retailer with operations in several states, for nearly $700 million in stock. It was to be the largest-ever cannabis acquisition in the U.S., and the move played well with investors.</p>
<p>But by the end of the year, the spending and the bravado began to catch up with Bierman. In the second half 2018 alone, MedMen lost more than $130 million according to its disclosures.</p>
<p>In November, two MedMen subsidiaries were hit with a class-action lawsuit in a Los Angeles court alleging labor law violations. At the time, a MedMen spokesman told Marijuana Business Daily, “We offer competitive compensation and strive to cultivate a thriving work environment.” The case remains ongoing.</p>
<p>In December, the city of West Hollywood announced that MedMen’s flagship, which had been operating on a temporary permit, would not receive a permanent license to sell marijuana, placing the store in a state of semi-permanent legal limbo.</p>
<p>In the first week of 2019, two early investors in MedMen sued Bierman, Modlin and the company. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants were improperly preventing them from cashing in their shares. They also accused the founders of abusing the business’s complex corporate structure to engage in “rampant, brazen self-dealing.”</p>
<p>A company spokesman described the allegations as “frivolous claims” and said that the plaintiffs had already profited on their investments.</p>
<p>Later that month, the company’s outgoing CFO filed a more sensational suit. In his complaint, James Parker claimed that Bierman and Modlin breached his contract by forcing him out of the company in response to his attempts to professionalize its finances and uphold his fiduciary duties to shareholders.</p>
<p>Parker also alleged in his complaint that Bierman, in private, called Los Angeles City Councilman Herb Wesson a “midget negro” (a spokesman for Wesson declined to comment) and called a marijuana activist a “fat, black lesbian”; that the founders threw around terms like “cunt,” “retard” and “pussy-bitch” and were intoxicated at corporate events; that Bierman told him to go up to an employee’s hotel room and tell the employee to “take his fist out of his boyfriend’s ass, and tell him to get to work.”</p>
<p>Parker’s vivid portrait of the workplace environment was only the beginning.</p>
<p>The complaint alleged that he was ordered to pay a Canadian firm hundreds of thousands of dollars so it would buy MedMen stock, to prop up its price when it was “under attack,” and to pay private intelligence firms to dig up dirt on MedMen’s perceived enemies.</p>
<p>His complaint alleged that the founders were not fully transparent about non-arm’s-length transactions with related entities and that they ordered the opening of a “sham office” in Vancouver to fool Canadian regulators.</p>
<p>The complaint alleged that Bierman spoke of falsifying his personal brokerage statement, with Modlin’s help, to apply for a home mortgage. Parker also alleged that Bierman asked him to donate to a Nevada politician because Bierman had personally maxed out and promised the politician more contributions. And the complaint alleged that company funds were used to pay for personal furniture for Modlin to indirectly reimburse a contribution Modlin made to the same Nevada politician.</p>
<p>Campaign-finance records show that the only Nevada candidate to receive maximum contributions from Parker, Bierman and Modlin is Sisolak, who presided over “MedMen Day” weeks before his election as Nevada’s governor. Representatives for Sisolak did not respond to requests for comment.

<h3 id="cory-booker-praises-extraordinary-girlfriend-rosario-dawson">&ldquo;Cory Booker Praises ‘Extraordinary’ Girlfriend Rosario Dawson&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.nbcboston.com/2019/09/Cory-Booker-Rosario-Dawson.jpg?fit=1200%2C675" alt="img">
As Sen. Cory Booker continues his presidential campaign, he caught up with NBC10 Boston in New Hampshire.</p>
<p>Booker spoke to the station after a meet-and-greet event at the Bagel Mill in Peterborough, discussing the 2020 race as well as his relationship with actress Rosario Dawson.</p>
<p>A preparatory Google search of his latest policy positions and activity on the campaign trail turned up was a slew of headlines about him and Dawson, who was quoted as saying she is &ldquo;absolutely in love&rdquo; with the senator.</p>
<p>Booker laughed when this was mentioned to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a great experience to be dating someone more famous than you are,&rdquo; Booker said. &ldquo;She is an extraordinary woman who has transformed my life, and you know, it&rsquo;s just weird to be running for president at a time that I&rsquo;m the happiest I&rsquo;ve ever been in my personal life, as well. So I&rsquo;m excited to win the presidency and perhaps have one of the more extraordinary significant others that has ever been with a president.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It sounds like wedding bells could be ringing some day soon for those two.

<h3 id="cory-booker-exits-presidential-race-but-he-still-has-girlfriend-rosario-dawsons-vote">&ldquo;Cory Booker exits presidential race, but he still has girlfriend Rosario Dawson’s vote&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/13d3bff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2784x1462+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F96%2F4b%2F33478a37429da233f4bc525873f9%2Fhttps-delivery.gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1180351727.jpg" alt="img">
After Sen. Cory Booker dropped out of the presidential race Monday, his girlfriend, Rosario Dawson, declared her continued love and support.</p>
<p>The actress took to Twitter to praise the New Jersey lawmaker hours after he became the latest Democratic candidate to announce that he’d be suspending his campaign, further narrowing the once-crowded field leading up to the 2020 election showdown with President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>“Cory, you continue to inspire me everyday,” Dawson, whose screen credits include “Rent,” “Sin City,” “Jane the Virgin” and Netflix’s “Defenders” franchise, tweeted in response to Booker’s announcement. “On this journey you and your remarkable team have represented the best in us and I know you will continue to. Thank you. I see you. I love you.”</p>
<p>Cory, you continue to inspire me everyday. On this journey you and your remarkable team have represented the best in us and I know you will continue to. Thank you. I see you. I love you. https://t.co/b5sWCw88g0 — Rosario Dawson (@rosariodawson) January 13, 2020</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The couple have been romantically linked since January 2019, and their Washington-Hollywood connection has been of special interest since Booker declared his presidential bid and “universal love” platform last February: His potential election would have made him the second bachelor-president in U.S. history. The first unmarried president was James Buchanan.</p>
<p>Booker, 50, and Dawson, 40, first met in 2017 at a fundraiser for former Maryland Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ben Jealous, but had been involved in other relationships at the time. During a March 2019 CNN town hall, Booker revealed that he had to muster up the courage to ask for her phone number and called her an “incredible girlfriend” as he shook off speculation about a wedding in the White House.</p>
<p>She also confirmed the romance to TMZ that month. Since then, Dawson has appeared at Booker’s campaign-trail events, and the two have made repeat cameos of the lovey-dovey variety on each other’s social media accounts.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>But Dawson’s effusive praise didn’t hold much of a candle to Trump’s immediate burn of the former Democratic hopeful. POTUS took to Twitter to troll Booker on Monday, writing: “Really Big Breaking News (Kidding): Booker, who was in zero polling territory, just dropped out of the Democrat Presidential Primary Race. Now I can rest easy tonight. I was sooo concerned that I would someday have to go head to head with him!”

<p>Sen. Cory Booker and girlfriend Rosario Dawson are choosing to spend the coronavirus pandemic apart.</p>
<p>“We are so many thousands of miles apart. It’s so challenging,” Dawson told Entertainment Tonight recently, adding that she’s looking after her high-risk parents.</p>
<p>“That was sort of the dedication during this quarantine to take care of [my dad], while [Cory] was still in D.C. working on the stimulus package.”</p>
<p>The “Briarpatch” actress, 40, revealed that she and Booker, 50, had planned the “longest vacation ever” this month, but had to postpone indefinitely.</p>
<p>“He’s been campaigning the whole year and it was just only a couple of months since we started dating. So we’ve not really had a really good chunk of time together because of our work and our family and all the other things,” she explained to the outlet.</p>
<p>“It ended up being what was supposed to be our longest time together, [is] now our longest period apart from each other. So, that’s definitely been really challenging.”</p>
<p>Booker dropped out of the presidential race in January, but when he was still campaigning in October, he discussed potentially getting engaged to Dawson, though that seems unlikely given their physical separation, which she said has no end in sight.</p>
<p>“We just gotta make really careful decisions about moving … Both of my parents are high risk, so I just want to do anything and everything we can in this next year or year and a half, whatever period it is, of just being as safe as possible,” Dawson, who came out as a member of the LGBTQ community in January, told ET.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to think about when we are going to be flying again and doing anything that was planned. Like plans, what are those? We’re just taking it every day at a time.”</p>
<p>Page Six exclusively reported that Dawson and Booker began dating in December 2018, though they didn’t confirm the relationship themselves until a few months later.

“You know those charity dances where you have to dance for, like, 30 hours straight? I could totally do that,” she says, not at all out of breath, before running backstage to give out hugs and motivational speeches.</p>
<p>“I am fa-reaked out! Y’all look so beautiful!” Dawson tells her runway walkers: kids, grandmas, actual models, friends and bare-chested female dancers in gold body paint. All around Dawson and Studio 189 co-founder Abrima Eriwah is a rainbow of skin tones and gender identities and jubilant patterned fabrics reflecting the collection’s inspiration: They called it “Heritage” to mark the 400th anniversary of the first slave ships departing Africa for Virginia.</p>

<p>Were Dawson a politician instead of a longtime activist who’s dating a guy who’s running for president, these would be her constituents. She’s doing the Elizabeth Warren selfie line, except she’s the one who wants pictures with everyone.</p>
<p>Fantasia was there, along with Jay-Z protegee Young Paris, Black Lives Matter co-founder Opal Tometi, and a packed house of some 800 people. But not Sen. Cory Booker, or “noted boyfriend of Rosario Dawson,” as New York magazine’s feminist website the Cut likes to call him.</p>
<p>Their first anniversary was Oct. 14, and the year has been a mishmash of convoluted schedules. In September, the senator from New Jersey was prepping for the third Democratic debate in Houston during her fashion show. And by the time he took the debate stage, Dawson was already back in Albuquerque on the set of “Briarpatch,” the neo-noir anthology series for USA network that she stars in (as an investigator having an affair with a senator!) and which just wrapped a 3½ -month shoot.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“I laugh because it’s like, ‘Okay, you’re flying and connecting through here. Maybe we can meet at the airport hotel,’ ” Booker said in an interview last week, calling in from the campaign trail. “It has made for great adventures of, you know, making seven hours together be magical.”</p>
<p>Dawson is also working on several social justice documentaries; voicing Wonder Woman in an animated feature; promoting the big-budget movie “Zombieland: Double Tap”; and working as a board member for Voto Latino, the voting rights organization she co-founded with María Teresa Kumar 15 years ago. Not to mention her personal obligations as a single mother of an adopted teenage daughter and the Hollywood success story in a big Puerto Rican family from New York’s Lower East Side.</p>
<p>As recognizable as Dawson is — she’s starred as Claire Temple in the Netflix Marvel universe and gets mobbed by fans — it is interest in her relationship with Booker that is currently dominating her story. He’s the only unmarried Democratic presidential candidate and potentially the first modern bachelor president. She’s the young Jane Fonda of the Afro-Latinx world (or, perhaps, labor leader Dolores Huerta if she’d also starred in “Sin City” and the movie version of “Rent”). They are the rare power couple capable of fascinating political analysts, Hollywood gossips and your mother.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Until now, they’ve rarely been seen together in public. Instead, Booker has gushed about her on talk shows, and they drop little windows into their relationship on Dawson’s Instagram, through cute videos or screenshots of text messages she posted of Booker’s buddies congratulating him for having a girlfriend who was a clue in last Sunday’s New York Times crossword puzzle.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s debate in Ohio is the first Dawson has managed to attend. Booker arrived holding her hand. She stayed until the end, documenting it on Instagram. It seems to be part of a new phase of openness in their relationship.</p>
<p>“I’m in love! I am absolutely in love, and it is so exciting,” Dawson said last month, while sitting barefoot in a gown on her hotel bed during a 24-hour trip to the Toronto Film Festival.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Because “Briarpatch” wrapped in late September, she’s been home in Los Angeles and Booker has come to her. He kissed her on the red carpet of her “Zombieland: Double Tap” premiere on Thursday.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>When the Daily Mail wrote in a headline that Dawson had joined her presidential candidate boyfriend at the premiere of the sustainable agriculture documentary “The Need to Grow,” Booker corrected it on Twitter, “Actually, I joined her.”</p>
<p>“It’s just lazy,” Dawson says in a later phone call. “Like, I narrate that movie and I’m a producer on it.”</p>
<p>All this togetherness, Dawson says, is just a function of her having some free time. But it certainly can’t hurt Booker’s flagging poll numbers; he’s averaging 1.4 percent in national surveys.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>There’s an expectation for political partners to be quietly supportive in the background. There’s no playbook for when a politician starts dating a vocal activist and Hollywood star who’s as famous, if not more famous.</p>
<p>Dawson says she’s planning to ride around Iowa in an RV next month with him. “RV tours are my jam,” she says. “I think there’s no way of making that happen without quote-unquote ‘joining him on the campaign trail.’ It’s going to show up like that no matter what, but I’m just trying to spend time with my boyfriend.”</p>
<p>Flash back to the 2016 election: Booker was a freshman senator who&rsquo;d endorsed Hillary Clinton and was a possible VP pick. Dawson was a vocal Bernie Sanders surrogate, stumping for him around the country. She also got arrested in the &ldquo;Democracy Spring&rdquo; protests at the Capitol, calling for reform of voting laws and removing money from politics.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“I don’t know what it would be for, but I could see myself getting arrested again in the near future, if that’s what draws people’s attention to something. For me, it’s always on the table,” says Dawson, who has said that running for office is on her bucket list.</p>
<p>Indeed, Dawson was so far left in 2016 that many people believe that after Sanders lost the primary, she voted for Jill Stein. “No, I didn’t!” she says. “It’s on my Wikipedia and it keeps getting proliferated, but it’s not true.”</p>
<p>She was at the Democratic convention, she saw the infighting, she got sad, and mad. And she says she’s still upset anyone would think she’d do something to have put Donald Trump in office.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Dawson’s mom, Isabel Celeste, also stumped for Sanders and says that when she first met Booker, she told him, “You know, you don’t get my vote.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>But after getting to know him, she’s convinced: “He’s young, he’s hard-working, he’s stoic, he’s amazing, he’s probably going to marry my daughter and shut the front door.”</p>
<p>It seems as if Dawson and Booker, then, are a case of opposite Democrats attract. Some clickbait-y blind items have circulated on the Internet insinuating that their relationship is fake. If this were for show, honestly, she’d be a little edgy for his presidential brand. Toward the left side of progressive. Has been arrested for social justice and expects to do it again.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>And then there’s that celebratory video for her 40th birthday that she posted on Instagram this May of herself topless and outdoors, looking at palm trees as birds chirped in the background. She showed nothing but her back and confidence and excellent complexion, and yet she inspired a slew of incredulous responses on conservative media and Twitter wondering whether Cory Booker’s “actress girlfriend” had gone nuts.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>These two seem to take it in stride. She’s 40. He’s 50. They’ve both lived public lives for a long time. “I think that’s actually pretty cool,” says Dawson. “I don’t need to make that legitimate for anybody else.”</p>
<p>Like most couples who’ve been together for a while, their origin story is evolving. Though Booker has said that Dawson didn’t give him the time of day when they first met at a summer 2018 fundraiser for Ben Jealous, a mutual friend who was running for governor of Maryland, he tells it a little differently this time.</p>
<p>“There was no love connection there,” he says. “I think it was the places of life we were in. I was probably dating somebody when we first met.”</p>
<p>Dawson’s last known boyfriend before dating Booker — the most earnest man in politics — was comedian Eric André, perhaps best known for finding inventive ways to appear fully nude on his Adult Swim talk show.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Then in October 2018, Dawson and Booker ran into each other again. “I mean, gosh, that night we talked for hours and hours,” says Booker. At the end of the night, he says, “I had trouble asking for her phone number. . . . I think I said something really stupid like, ‘Uh, how would I get in touch with you?’ And she mercifully said something like, ‘Oh, you want my phone number?’ And my insides were like, ‘Hell, yeah!’ ”</p>
<p>Was he really the dork he says he was?</p>
<p>“A million and one percent,” says Dawson. “He’s so charming and so confident and so capable, but it’s not like that translates to being some super-smooth kind of guy. That’s not his style. What wins me over with him is definitely the dad jokes.”</p>
<p>They live on opposite coasts, but Booker says that almost immediately they started seeing each other once a week. The couple knew that Booker’s schedule would become insane once he declared on Feb. 1 and that Dawson’s would become immovable once she started “Briarpatch.”</p>
<p>But then Dawson’s dad, Greg Dawson, got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at the beginning of the year, and she oriented all the time she could toward caring for him and flying back for his chemo appointments.</p>
<p>Rosario Dawson says that his tumor has shrunk dramatically and that she’s both glad she was able to be his advocate and furious at how byzantine the health-care system is.</p>
<p>Her 16-year-old daughter, Isa, meanwhile, spent most of the summer with her in New Mexico, which didn’t leave a ton of time for Booker. Dawson says they went two months without seeing each other. But they’ve made up for it with FaceTime, which they try to do twice a day. He’s gotten in the habit of sending her music every morning, and he just finished reading David Benioff’s World War II novel “City of Thieves” to her over the phone. Dawson says he’s the only partner she’s ever spoken to every day, multiple times a day. They both enjoy pointing out that they are vegan.</p>
<p>She calls him CAB and forgets that he doesn’t like it when she uses that around other people.</p>
<p>“Not everybody has good initials,” she says. “He’s my anchor. He’s my guy, you know. He’s very presumptuous. My initials are R-I-D. But he calls me RIB.”</p>
<p>“Look, both of us, you know, we’ve had relationships,” says Booker, “but I’m not sure if I’ve ever fully given myself over to a relationship as much as I have with her and allowed myself to be as vulnerable.”</p>
<p>Dawson says that she was trying to explain to a younger cousin how you know you’re in love, and she could only describe how she feels about Booker. “For my whole life, I’ve always felt like, even when I got into a relationship, I was trying to be the center of the storm and everything was just this maelstrom out there,” she says. “But for the first time, I feel like I have someone in the center of the storm with me.”</p>
<p>Dawson was about 7 years old when she started marching with her family for housing rights, homelessness rights, women&rsquo;s rights, LGBTQI rights. Her mother, Isabel Celeste, would push Rosario and her younger brother Clay, who is now a writer and DJ, around in a shopping cart lined with pillows.</p>
<p>“I would have a staple gun and sticks and poster board,” Isabel Celeste says, “and they would have magic markers, and they would make banners for people, so they’d have something to march with.” Dawson’s great-grandmother and grandmother marched in support of unionizing female garment workers.</p>
<p>They were a young family; Isabel Celeste was 17 when she had Rosario, who has no relationship with her biological father. When Rosario was little, her mother married Greg Dawson, a carpenter who raised her.</p>
<p>Living conditions grew unbearable in the only Lower East Side apartment they could afford, so they moved into an abandoned building around the corner that didn’t have electricity or running water but at least was clean.</p>
<p>Growing up, Dawson was the performer of the family, according to her uncle Gustavo Vasquez, who is a comic-book artist: “She would dress up like Madonna did with the bows and patterns.” And, he says, she seemed to absorb the creative energy of the artists who were also squatting in their building. Still, no one in the family had ever been in show business, and had she not been sitting on her stoop at age 15 at the exact time director Larry Clark and writer Harmony Korine walked by, Dawson wouldn’t be, either.</p>
<p>They asked her to do a screen test, put her in their 1995 film, “Kids,” about New York City youths grappling with HIV/AIDS, and her life changed. She still lived at home, though, even after Spike Lee cast her in “He Got Game.”</p>
<p>As an actress, Dawson has always veered toward genre, whether it’s because she grew up devouring comic books with her uncle Gus or because those are the roles she’s offered. “I’ve had indie films where I’ve either been the lead or a co-lead,” she says. “But usually I’m a co-star.”</p>
<p>“Briarpatch,” her USA show, which premieres in January, may be the meatiest role she’s had. It’s based on a hard-boiled crime novel from prolific author (and World War II veteran) Ross Thomas. Creepy hotel. Small-town Texas villains who turn out to be terrifying. Exploding cars. Zoo animals run amok. Alan Cumming.</p>
<p>And at the center is Dawson’s character, Allegra Dill, a woman from a Texas border town who comes home from Washington, D.C., to investigate her sister’s murder. Allegra also happens to be having sex with her boss — a U.S. senator.</p>
<p>Andy Greenwald, the well-known TV critic who adapted Thomas’s book into the series and is the “Briarpatch” showrunner, says he couldn’t believe it when he heard Dawson was interested in the role.</p>
<p>“I feel like people have been asking her to be the lead in a TV show for a decade,” Greenwald says. “And she said no every time.”</p>
<p>Dawson has done an 18-episode guest arc on Jane the Virgin. But she’s never had her own series. “It’s the commitment,” she says. Unlike most TV shows, “Briarpatch” is a 10-episode series like “True Detective.”</p>
<p>Being No. 1 on the call sheet is a huge responsibility, and Dawson did not take it lightly. The No. 1’s mood can make or break everyone’s experience on a production. Greenwald says Dawson made a point to be “relentlessly optimistic and positive” no matter what was going on with her daughter or her dad’s cancer or Booker being so far away — though he did come to the set once, driving three hours out of his way while in New Mexico for a fundraiser.</p>
<p>Back what seems like a lifetime ago, in Dawson&rsquo;s hotel room at the &ldquo;Briarpatch&rdquo; premiere at the Toronto Film Festival in September, Dawson grabbed a bottle of water and began adding an inky, green substance to it from a dropper.</p>
<p>“Have you had chlorophyll water?” she asks. She’d been using it to treat her altitude sickness in New Mexico. “It’s the difference between me having migraines and then throwing up or me being able to sleep and function and actually have extra energy,” she says.</p>
<p>She’d been having a great time in Toronto. The news was getting her a little annoyed, though. She’d told a reporter she wanted to work on voter registration vs. stumping for candidates this election, and suddenly there were articles saying she didn’t endorse Booker. A month earlier Page Six had published its third article about how Booker’s “actress girlfriend” wasn’t attending his campaign events. (Dawson posted it to her Instagram with the caption, “I made it!”)</p>
<p>“It’s important for me to maintain my own space and my own character and personality and career and professionalism,” she says. No one’s accusing Booker of being neglectful if he doesn’t come to some of her events. “I’m like, ‘I call B.S. on this.’ I don’t need to be on his arm to be supportive of him and vice versa.”</p>
<p>“Both of us are feminists,” Booker said in a later interview, “and both of us find it a double standard that they don’t ask me the same questions that they ask her. You know, I have an incredibly successful, self-made woman as my girlfriend who is managing a business, nonprofit work, a career. And when she has her big moments, nobody says, ‘Hey, where’s your boyfriend?’ ”</p>
<p>Plus, there’d been reasons, even beyond work and time, that she’d been laying low. She and Booker get harassed sometimes when they go out in public. Sometimes her daughter is with them. She’s been in relationships with other actors before, but this is a level of intense scrutiny, coupled with fear, that she’d never experienced before. A pipe bomb, she pointed out, had been intercepted on the way to Booker’s New Jersey office last year.</p>
<p>She wants to find more meaningful acting projects, produce more documentaries, maybe go back to college and learn about “regenerative farming and soil practices to capture carbon.” She’ll also continue to grow Voto Latino, which registered 200,000 voters last year and their leadership seminars have produced some elected officials.</p>
<p>She and Booker have talked about kids, and are seriously think about it. She adopted Isa at age 12, and together they’ve grown. “I feel very much like I checked the mom box in this lifetime.” And as much as she loves babies, “I don’t know that I have to be the one to actually push them out.”</p>
<p>Still, she finds all the speculating she gets from strangers, and her mother, amusing. “People go, ‘Oh, my God, if you guys became the first family, then you can be pregnant in the White House!’ I’m like, ‘Slow down.’ There’s a lot of time between here and then.”</p>
<p>Booker’s poll numbers are improving, and he qualified for the fifth Democratic debate in November, but this field is fraught and full.</p>
<p>For the first time in a while, though, she has a little breathing room just to be.

Rosario Dawson missed her boyfriend Sen. Cory Booker&rsquo;s debate night.</p>
<p>The actress, 40, wasn&rsquo;t able to tune into the second round of Democratic debates Wednesday night due to work.</p>
<p>In response to a follower asking if she was watching television live, she responded, &ldquo;I wish! I’m filming in New Mexico so missing tonight’s debate as well&hellip;! Enjoy!!!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another tweet, she confirmed she was working on the crime series &ldquo;Briarpatch,&rdquo; which is also set to star Edward Asner and Alan Cumming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just jumped on my phone to see how goes but will watch later when I wrap around 2amish&hellip;!&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>Dawson confirmed in March that she and Booker were dating, saying, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a wonderful human being, it&rsquo;s good to spend some time together when we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The senator later opened up to Ellen DeGeneres about the difficulties of dating during a presidential campaign because &ldquo;people are watching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, she was visiting me in D.C., and then she left to the airport, and she got ambushed at the airport,&rdquo; Booker told Degeneres about the now-famous TMZ video in which Dawson was asked about their relationship. &ldquo;I suddenly get this little video from her saying &lsquo;I got TMZ’d! I don’t have makeup on,&rsquo; this and this and that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said she survived the TMZ ambush well, adding, &ldquo;She’s just an incredible human being.&rdquo;</p>

“It’s the first time I felt like I had to be responsible about my choice of love, which is a challenging thing to do,&rdquo; Dawson told Bustle</p>
<p>Rosario Dawson Has Found &lsquo;Her Person&rsquo; with Boyfriend Cory Booker — but She Had to Be Sure She Wanted It</p>
<p>“He’s here!” the Briarpatch and Daredevil actress and mom-of-one told Bustle this week — meaning Booker, a New Jersey senator, is able to spend more time with his girlfriend since he’s no longer criss-crossing the country to see voters.</p>
<p>Get push notifications with news, features and more.</p>
<p>In fact, on the day of Dawson’s Bustle interview earlier this month, Booker, 50, was not too far away getting lunch.</p>
<p>“It’s the first time I felt like I had to be responsible about my choice of love, which is a challenging thing to do,” Dawson, 40, told the outlet of her romance with the politician, whom she began dating in the fall of 2018.</p>
<p>“If you fall in love, you fall in love,” she said. “But there’s another aspect I had to consider: what this meant in [putting] a microscope on my family and particularly on my daughter,” Isabella, whom she adopted six years ago.</p>
<p>Indeed, Dawson’s coupling with Booker pulled her into the spotlight of the political press and lent some celebrity to his campaign. But theirs wasn’t an election-season fling.</p>
<p>“In each other I think we found our person,” she told Bustle.</p>

<p>In a Washington Post profile in October, both she and Booker talked about their relationship: how they met, how they fell for one another and how they found time together despite their schedules.</p>
<p>“Look, both of us, you know, we’ve had relationships,” Booker told the Post, “but I’m not sure if I’ve ever fully given myself over to a relationship as much as I have with her and allowed myself to be as vulnerable.” (He has said he’s even wrote her love poems.)</p>
<p>Dawson said then: “For my whole life, I’ve always felt like, even when I got into a relationship, I was trying to be the center of the storm and everything was just this maelstrom out there. But for the first time, I feel like I have someone in the center of the storm with me.”</p>
<p>She told the Post she was “absolutely in love” with Booker — but you’d hardly have guessed there might be wedding bells in their future when they first met in the summer of 2018.</p>
<p>“There was no love connection there,” Booker said.</p>
<p>But it didn’t take long for that first flame-out of a meeting, when they were both at a political fundraiser for a mutual friend, to be replaced by a spark a few months later.</p>
<p>Meeting again that October, “We talked for hours and hour,” Booker told the Post in the fall.</p>
<p>Image zoom From left: Sen. Cory Booker and Rosario Dawson Araya Diaz/Getty</p>
<p>Given their very different — and very busy — schedules, their time together has ebbed and flowed. Still, even apart they have kept in close contact, according to the Post: That has included two FaceTime calls a day (when possible) and romantic gestures such as him sending her music every morning and reading David Benioff’s “City of Thieves” to her over the phone.</p>
<p>According to her new Bustle profile, Booker and Dawson are preparing to vacation together.
