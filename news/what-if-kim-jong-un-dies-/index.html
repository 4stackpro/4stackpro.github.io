Improvements in U.S.-North Korean relations would still largely be up to Washington.</p>
<p>Is North Korean leader Kim Jong-un dangerously close to death, recuperating from a cardiovascular procedure, or running the country in a business-as-usual fashion? A single-sourced report recently sparked an international rumor mill about the health of the 36-year-old Kim. While the South Korean government was quick to denounce the report, the U.S. intelligence community is closely monitoring developments related to Kim’s health.</p>
<p>Due to tightly controlled information, speculating about the inner workings of the Kim dynasty is a favorite pastime for North Korea watchers. But it also distracts from the more critical question: will a change of authority at the top suddenly produce a North Korea more amenable to Washington’s unflinching denuclearization demand?</p>
<p>The realistic answer is no, it won’t. And it’s past time for Washington to adjust policy to deal with that reality.</p>
<p>While Kim Jong-un undoubtedly calls the shots in his country—the North Korean government, after all, has been a family dynasty ever since North Korea was created in the aftermath of World War II—personalities are not the only drivers of state behavior. Balance-of-power dynamics, regional politics, diplomatic relationships, and core security interests are more important than individuals.</p>
<p>Assume for a moment that the world wakes up to news of Kim Jong-un’s death. How would the Workers Party and Kim’s inner circle react? Outside of assembling a smooth transition to ensure continuity of government and jousting behind the scenes between competing power centers, North Korea’s foreign policy, its perception of its security environment, and the value it attaches to its nuclear deterrent are unlikely to change.</p>
<p>North Korea post-Kim would be in the very same position as it was when Kim Jong-un was the center of authority. The country will still be the metaphorical “shrimp among whales,” an economic basket case hemmed in by far wealthier neighbors to the east and west and tightly limited by international sanctions. The North Korean economy would still be struggling for air, looking paltry in comparison to South Korea, whose per capita GDP ($42,246) is 42 times larger than the North Koreans’ $1,298 per person. The North Korean leadership will remain almost completely dependent on China for political cover, trade, and supply chains.</p>
<p>The threat environment for Pyongyang will hardly be any different either. The United States and the U.N. Security Council will continue to push and prod for North Korea’s complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization regardless of whether Kim Jong-un is dead, alive, or incapacitated. In fact, with Kim out of the picture, Washington may be even more insistent and aggressive on this demand. Kim or no Kim, the U.S. and U.N. sanctions that have capped North Korea’s exports and negatively impacted practically every individual funding stream for the regime will remain intact—a development a future North Korean government will likely interpret as a continuation of a deliberate U.S. strategy to foment regime change.</p>
<p>To summarize, the strategic environment that has constrained North Korea’s freedom of movement and blocked the normalization of U.S.-North Korea relations for the past seven decades won’t disappear with Kim Jong-un. North Korea will have as much incentive to surrender its nuclear deterrent in a post-Kim world as it does today: none whatsoever.</p>
<p>Kim Jong-un is not the only North Korean military or political official who believes dismantling or surrendering Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons arsenal would be a foolish, if not suicidal, mistake for its security and regime stability. Whether Washington likes it or not, the Hermit Kingdom will remain a nuclear state.</p>
<p>The United States has two choices to manage the reality it now faces. It can continue on the current course and pile more pressure on Pyongyang, returning tensions to the “fire and fury” days of 2017 for no gain and risking a violent regional conflict.</p>
<p>Or it can do the prudent thing by going back to the drawing board, reassessing the basic assumptions that have underwritten two decades of failed U.S. policy on North Korea, and tailor its strategy to more realistic and achievable objectives. Those objectives include what many in the Beltway have totally opposed exploring: dropping the demand for up-front denuclearization; improving the U.S.-North Korea bilateral relationship; negotiating an arms reduction mechanism both sides could live with; and support rather than hinder the current South Korean government’s noble quest for inter-Korean reconciliation. Given its overwhelming conventional and nuclear superiority, Washington can deter Pyongyang from attacking the U.S. indefinitely.</p>
<p>The conventional Washington paradigm on North Korea has been a systemic failure across the board. This will remain the case regardless of whether Kim Jong-un, his sister, or a North Korean field marshal is the ultimate authority. The sooner persistent but stale assumptions are discarded, the sooner the U.S. can settle on a policy that will safeguard U.S. interests and lessen the probability of conflict.

<h3 id="the-unanswered-questions-surrounding-kim-jong-un">The unanswered questions surrounding Kim Jong-un</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.newstatesman.com/sites/default/files/styles/homesection_image/public/blogs_2020/04/gettyimages-1152948850.jpg?itok=q3h0_i_h" alt="img">
On Monday the US National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien confirmed that the US was “keeping a close eye” on rumours suggesting that Kim Jong-un was gravely ill. These had begun following reports from North Korean defectors in South Korea that he had undergone heart surgery on 12 April, after which the North Korean leader had missed the “Day of the Sun” commemorations of his grandfather’s death on 15 April last week.</p>
<p>The rumours were played down by the South Korean authorities, who suggested that he was “touring provincial areas”, and by Donald Trump, who at his White House briefing yesterday called the rumours of Kim’s ill health “fake news”. Yet still several unanswered questions remain.</p>
<p>Question one: where is Kim Jong-un? The North Korean leader has now not been seen in public since, it is believed, 11 April. His absence at the unusually low-key 15 April commemorations was particularly striking as his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, was the country’s founder and revered as a near-deity there. With rumours swirling about his health - there have been reports of panic buying within North Korea - one might expect a healthy Kim to quash them by making an appearance.</p>
<p>Conversely, when Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, died the news was covered up for two days as China brokered the succession. There have reportedly been signs of activity at a North Korean military facility used to train for parades. Also watch for any signs of changed flight activity between Beijing and Pyongyang.</p>
<p>Question two: does South Korea know something it is not sharing publicly? Chad O’Carroll, CEO of the Korea Risk Group, reports that Seoul last week briefed reporters on North Korean missile tests hours after the fact. Typically such tests are announced instantly. O’Carroll also finds it odd that the briefing included details of standard North Korean air activity, about which they only rarely talk. “Something seems to be up,” he concludes.</p>
<p>Question three: is the US government, contrary to Trump’s comment, in fact still taking the illness rumours seriously? Aircraft Spots, a Twitter account monitoring air traffic, on Wednesday tracked multiple US surveillance flights over North Korea. Such flights, reports Vice, are not uncommon but are not usually trackable - suggesting the US government may be trying to pressure the North Korean leadership into revealing what is happening by making them visible.</p>
<p>Question four: is China preparing for a humanitarian crisis? A well-placed source has said that China is buying up large quantities of rice and cooking oil through commodity-trading front companies, despite it having no obvious additional domestic requirements for these food supplies. This is, to stress, just one source and the claim has not been verified. But if correct it might suggest Beijing is preparing for a possible refugee crisis should the regime in Pyongyang collapse.</p>
<p>If Kim Jong-un is incapacitated or dies, such action would indeed be prudent. Kim Yo-jong, Kim’s sister and his close ally, would be the natural successor. But it is uncertain whether this patriarchal military dictatorship would accept a female leader. On the other hand, the North Korean system is built on near-religious veneration of the family of Kim Il-sung (on which, read this 2018 profile of the Kim dynasty by our commissioning editor Gavin Jacobson) which might dissolve should, say, an army general stage a coup. A potentially disastrous power struggle within this nuclear-armed state cannot be discounted.</p>
<p>To be clear: nothing about this is confirmed. And as O’Carroll notes, there have been no signs of regime commotion in Pyongyang or Dandong, the main border crossing between North Korea and China. Kim may be well, or ill but recovering. But he is overweight and known to live unhealthily. And something does indeed seem to be up. If North Korea’s leader is so ill that he can no longer control the regime, or if he dies or is already dead, the world will be presented with another enormously destabilising event at the very moment when it can least afford it.
