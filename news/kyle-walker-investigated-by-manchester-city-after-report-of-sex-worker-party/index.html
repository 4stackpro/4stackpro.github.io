<p>Manchester City has launched an investigation into right back Kyle Walker after he allegedly hosted a party with a friend and two sex workers amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>ESPN&rsquo;s Rob Dawson reported Walker is facing &ldquo;disciplinary procedures&rdquo; based on the actions alleged in a report by Richard Moriarty and Daniel Hammond of The Sun, which noted he invited the group to his home for a &ldquo;three-hour sex session&rdquo; one day before his Instagram post about COVID-19 safety measures.</p>
<p>Walker released an extended statement about the situation, per Dawson:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to take this opportunity to issue a public apology for the choices I made last week which have resulted in a story today about my private life in a tabloid newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand that my position as a professional footballer brings the responsibility of being a role model. As such, I want to apologise to my family, friends, football club, supporters and the public for letting them down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are heroes out there making a vital difference to society at the moment, and I have been keen to help support and highlight their amazing sacrifices and life-saving work over the past week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My actions in this matter are in direct contrast to what I should have been doing regarding the lockdown. And I want to re-iterate the message: Stay home, stay safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sky Blues also released a statement, which read in part: &ldquo;Manchester City FC are aware of a story in a tabloid newspaper regarding the private life of Kyle Walker in relation to a breach of the UK lockdown and social distancing rules.&rdquo; The club said it will review the allegations in the &ldquo;coming days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fellow Premier League player Jack Grealish of Aston Villa was fined and disciplined by the club after releasing an apology saying he was &ldquo;deeply embarrassed&rdquo; after breaching lockdown recommendations and being involved in a traffic accident.</p>
<p>Walker has made 29 appearances for City across all competitions during the 2019-20 season, which is delayed indefinitely because of the coronavirus.

<h3 id="ian-ladyman-lockdown-beyond-kyle-walker-and-jack-grealish-they-could-learn-from-sergio-aguero">IAN LADYMAN: Lockdown beyond Kyle Walker and Jack Grealish. They could learn from Sergio Aguero</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/05/20/26840102-0-image-a-49_1586115383067.jpg" alt="img">
Perhaps the most revealing segment of the behind-the scenes documentary about Manchester City was the three minutes examining Sergio Aguero&rsquo;s life away from the field.</p>
<p>Essentially, he doesn&rsquo;t really have one. Separated from the mother of his son, Aguero spends his hours away from training holed up in a plush but rather empty flat.</p>
<p>With young Benjamin visiting just once a month from Argentina, Aguero watches mafia and action movies in a cinema room designed for a family and occasionally hangs out with team-mate Nicolas Otamendi.</p>
<p>Sergio Aguero has been one of the Premier League&rsquo;s best strikers for nearly a decade</p>
<p>But his personal sacrifices means he only sees his son Benjamin from Argentina once a month</p>
<p>&lsquo;Most of the time I am on my own,&rsquo; Aguero says, staring blankly into the camera. In some ways it&rsquo;s a little sad. No way, perhaps, for a man in the prime of life to spend his hours.</p>
<p>But the point is that Aguero sees it as a sacrifice worth making. What is a few years of relative loneliness and disconnection in exchange for a career at the top of the game?</p>
<p>Aguero is the leading goalscorer in City&rsquo;s history and has played 97 times for Argentina. That, effectively, is the trade-off. That&rsquo;s what the dedication brings you when the alternative is to be Kyle Walker or Jack Grealish.</p>
<p>Neither player has Aguero&rsquo;s gifts but both men are hugely talented all the same. Walker, a club-mate of Aguero&rsquo;s, is an athletic full-back, Grealish a clever midfielder for Aston Villa admired by more successful clubs.</p>
<p>Kyle Walker has been caught in a lockdown scandal after inviting two women to his home</p>
<p>Walker urged his 1.7million Instagram followers to stay home and protect the NHS, but also paid for two escorts to visit his Cheshire home in the middle of of a nationwide lockdown</p>
<p>But faced with the lockdown over the last two weeks, it proved beyond them. Grealish went to a house party and pranged his car on leaving. Walker invited two young women to his home. An article on Sunday in The Sun described the girls as &lsquo;escorts&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Both men have apologised but had little choice. Grealish was called out by witnesses on social media, while one of Walker&rsquo;s guests ran straight to the newspapers once she had stuffed his £1,000 in her purse.</p>
<p>Had they not been rumbled so spectacularly, we can presume these would not have been one off indiscretions. Young single men were not designed to spend long days and nights stuck at home on their own. Especially not those used to the endorphin rush of match day and the energy-sapping days of training.</p>
<p>These are athletes accustomed to routine. So this is a challenging time for footballers and even more so for those who do not have the distraction and comfort of family life.</p>
<p>Jack Grealish broke the lockdown rules by going to a house party before pranging his car</p>
<p>Grealish and Walker could both learn so much from Aguero&rsquo;s dedication to the game</p>
<p>But at the same time, Walker and Grealish are not alone. We are all going through the mill at this time. Each of us has it tough in our own way and how we respond will tell us much about ourselves.</p>
<p>Speaking to someone who would know this week, Grealish — the Villa captain — was described as a &lsquo;bit stupid&rsquo;. That is a shame because his football speaks of intelligence. Walker, meanwhile, has a good reputation in the game but is said to have lost his way off the field.</p>
<p>Ultimately, both are responsible for their choices and the ones players make at the top of the game often make the difference between the great and the merely very good.</p>
<p>Aguero cannot have imagined when he fathered Benjamin 11 years ago that he would end up in an apartment on his own watching Goodfellas on repeat. He could have taken the easy path at any time. In Argentina, they are desperate for him to return to Independiente.</p>
<p>But the best centre forward of the Premier League era made a lifestyle choice just as, in recent days, Walker and Grealish have made theirs. Aguero stuck around and endured the challenges of life in England because he felt it was worth it.</p>
<p>He knows he can sit in the sun another day. Just like the rest of us.</p>
<p>Do top players truly care about lower leagues?</p>
<p>Buried in the long statement provided by the PFA on behalf of Premier League captains after Saturday&rsquo;s meeting was an expressed concern about the future of clubs further down the league ladder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Many clubs require an increase in funding just to survive,&rsquo; the players said. &lsquo;We believe in our football pyramid and stress the need for solidarity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is interesting because it points to a question routinely asked by football fans across the country.</p>
<p>Why is a greater portion of the Premier League&rsquo;s vast wealth not distributed to ensure the health of the game further down the leagues?</p>
<p>The reason is because the majority of the cash drawn in at the top level goes straight to the players and their agents.</p>
<p>So if the Premier League&rsquo;s elite performers really do care about Oldham and Carlisle and Leyton Orient and Newport, they are going to have to earn less.</p>
<p>Not just now. But for the long term. We wait&hellip;</p>
<p>Lower league clubs face an uncertain time because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic</p>
<p>Capello was the real Calamity</p>
<p>In a Guardian interview, former England boss Fabio Capello refers to goalkeeper David James as &lsquo;Calamity&rsquo;. Not once but four times.</p>
<p>For those sleeping at the back, it&rsquo;s a play on Calamity Jane and Capello thinks it&rsquo;s funny. But it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>James played for his country 53 times and doubtless tried his damndest each and every time.</p>
<p>And what of Capello? He oversaw an England team blessed with players such as Rio Ferdinand, Wayne Rooney, Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard and never came within a country mile of winning a thing.</p>
<p>Calamitous? Yes, I would say so.

<h3 id="manchester-city-confirma-processo-a-kyle-walker-por-festa-com-prostitutas">Manchester City confirma processo a Kyle Walker por festa com prostitutas</h3>
<p><img src="https://imagens.publico.pt/imagens.aspx/1456350?tp=UH&amp;db=IMAGENS&amp;type=JPG&amp;share=1&amp;o=BarraFacebook_Publico.png" alt="img">
O futebolista do Manchester City Kyle Walker terá quebrado a obrigação de confinamento devido à covid-19 numa festa com prostituas, noticiou hoje a imprensa britânica, tendo o clube instaurado um processo disciplinar.</p>
<p>“Os futebolistas são modelos a seguir a nível mundial e o nosso pessoal e jogadores trabalharam para apoiar os incríveis esforços do sistema nacional de saúde (NHS) e outros trabalhadores chave (&hellip;). Estamos decepcionados por ver as acusações, tomámos nota da rápida declaração e desculpas de Kyle e vamos abrir-lhe um processo disciplinar interno nos próximos dias”, declarou o um porta-voz do clube à BBC.</p>
<p>A situação em torno do defesa de 29 anos dos “citizens” foi revelada por um jornal sensacionalista, que levou o jogador a pedir “desculpas públicas pelas decisões tomadas que deram lugar a uma história” sobre a sua vida privada.</p>
<p>“Há heróis que marcam uma diferença vital para a sociedade neste momento e eu quero ajudar, apoiar e destacar os seus incríveis sacrifícios e o seu trabalho para salvar vidas. As minhas acções neste assunto contrastam directamente com o que deveria ter feito”, lamentou Walker, num comunicado divulgado no mesmo jornal que publicou a história, no qual insistiu na mensagem “fica em casa, mantém-te a salvo”.</p>
<p>Kyle Walker assumiu que a sua condição de futebolista profissional implica “a responsabilidade de ser um modelo a seguir”, pelo que pediu desculpas à família, amigos, clube, adeptos e publico em geral “por os decepcionar”.</p>
<p>Este é o segundo caso de violação de confinamento e distanciamento social no futebol inglês, depois de o capitão do Aston Villa, Jack Grealish, ter sido fotografado num acidente rodoviário, horas depois de publicar um vídeo a convencer as pessoas a ficar em casa.</p>

<p>O novo coronavírus, responsável pela pandemia da covid-19, já infectou mais de 1,2 milhões de pessoas em todo o mundo, das quais morreram mais de 65 mil. Dos casos de infecção, mais de 233 mil são considerados curados.</p>
<p>Depois de surgir na China, em Dezembro, o surto espalhou-se por todo o mundo, o que levou a Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS) a declarar uma situação de pandemia.</p>
<p>O continente europeu, com cerca de mais de 642 mil infectados e mais de 47 mil mortos, é aquele onde se regista o maior número de casos.
