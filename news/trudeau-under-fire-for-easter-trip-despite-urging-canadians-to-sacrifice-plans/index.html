<p>Despite repeatedly urging Canadians to stay home for Easter amid the coronavirus pandemic, even if it meant not seeing their families, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is defending the decision to go see his.</p>
<p>The pandemic forced Canadians across the country to abandon hopes of travel to see loved ones and also came amid warnings from public officials for people not to travel to cottages unless that is already their primary residence — and really, just not to leave their homes at all.</p>

<p>But shortly after calling on Canadians to “stay home” and “Skype that big family dinner,” Trudeau crossed the provincial border from Ottawa into Quebec to visit his wife and three children at Harrington Lake.</p>
<p>Harrington Lake is the name of a federally designated heritage building maintained by the National Capital Commission that serves as the country residence of Canadian prime ministers.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>While only a half-hour drive from Ottawa, getting to the residence requires crossing the provincial border into Quebec, something police recently set up checkpoints in a bid to limit.</p>
<p>Trudeau defended the travel when questioned by journalists on Tuesday at his daily briefing.</p>
<p>“After three weeks of my family living up at Harrington and me working here, I went to join them for Easter weekend. We continue to follow all the instructions from public health authorities,” he said.</p>
<p>“Yes, but did somebody tell you this was OK?” asked the journalist.</p>

<p>“All over social media, people are wondering why this exception was OK for you, why it was OK for you to go see your family at the cottage.”</p>
<p>“My family has been living there for three weeks,” Trudeau repeated. “This is where my wife and my children live.”</p>

<p>Speaking on background, a government official said the prime minister should be considered an essential worker and, therefore, allowed to cross the border into Quebec.</p>

<p>The official also suggested the travel should be viewed as the prime minister travelling between his work location and a new primary residence for his family.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>But the Trudeaus live at the 22-room Rideau Cottage in Ottawa’s New Edinburgh neighbourhood — that was where Sophie Grégoire Trudeau completed her quarantine after being diagnosed with COVID-19.</p>
<p>That diagnosis came on March 12, and her quarantine ended on March 28.</p>
<p>It’s also the neighbourhood where his children have for years attended school — not in Quebec.</p>

<p>It is not clear why Grégoire Trudeau and the Trudeau children have decided to live there or why they chose not to come back to Ottawa for Easter.</p>
<p>Unlike from Ottawa into Gatineau, non-essential travel from Gatineau into Ottawa is not restricted — however, it is possible that had the family returned to Ottawa, they might not have been allowed to go back to their country residence afterwards.</p>
<p>Ontario Premier Doug Ford urged Ontarians not to travel to cottages over the Easter weekend.</p>
<p>“Please, this long weekend, do not go to your cottage. We can’t stress that enough,” Ford said last week.</p>
<p>Quebec Premier Francois Legault was asked about Trudeau’s trip by journalists on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>Specifically, one asked him whether he worried the visit set a bad example.</p>
<p>“What do you say to Quebeckers who say well, if Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did that, I’ll do the same thing?” the journalist asked.</p>
<p>“No comment,” Legault responded.</p>

<p>Trudeau isn’t the only leader facing questions about his Easter travel, either.</p>
<p>Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, his wife and five children flew to Ottawa on Friday ahead of the Saturday wage subsidy bill vote on a nine-seater government aircraft along with the Green Party’s Elizabeth May.</p>
<p>The close confines of a small aircraft raised questions about why he would bring his wife and children with him when physical distancing cannot be realistically practised on board.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Scheer said the flight was scheduled to go from Vancouver to Ottawa and stopped to pick up the whole Scheer family in Regina.</p>
<p>Scheer defended the move as requiring less travel than if he had to fly back and forth every time the House of Commons sits, and his spokesperson said the family will now be based in Ottawa until June.</p>

<h3 id="lilley-trudeaus-cottage-visit-mocks-us-and-the-rules-he-sets">LILLEY: Trudeau&rsquo;s cottage visit mocks us and the rules he sets</h3>
<p><img src="https://postmediatorontosun.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/13x069_64dc_9-e1586807455340.jpg" alt="img">
Justin Trudeau showed once again on Easter weekend that he doesn’t play by the same rules as everyone else, not even the rules he tell us to follow.</p>
<p>It was just last Friday that the PM was telling the whole country during his daily address that you couldn’t go see family for Easter.</p>
<p>“This weekend is going to be very different. You’ll have to stay home. You’ll have to Skype that big family dinner and the Easter egg hunt,” Trudeau said, standing outside of Rideau Cottage on the grounds of Rideau Hall in Ottawa.</p>
<p>That statement was followed up by this one.</p>
<p>“During the long weekend, we will all have to stay home. We cannot have gatherings for dinner and we’ll have to be creative to organize an Easter egg hunt inside the house,” Trudeau said.</p>
<p>So what did he do this weekend?</p>
<p>He got in his motorcade, with his full entourage, on Saturday afternoon and drove to the PM’s summer residence at Harrington Lake. From one cottage to the other, it is about 27 kilometers, it crosses a provincial boundary and goes through at least three municipalities.</p>
<p>In other words, Trudeau did exactly the opposite of what he, his own medical experts and the premiers of Ontario and Quebec have been saying. Ontario’s Doug Ford and Quebec’s Francois Legault have told people not to go to the cottage and to stay in our primary residence.</p>
<p>This is all part of flattening the curve we are told and making sure we don’t spread the virus. Quebec has even imposed travel restrictions within the province and for more than a week now, people trying to cross from Ottawa into Gatineau have been turned back unless they are essential workers.</p>
<p>No visiting the cottage, no shopping, no visiting family, no going on a drive through Gatineau Park. If you don’t live there, you are turned back.</p>
<p>Trudeau lives by different rules, though.</p>
<p>In normal times I would get this. I don’t begrudge him the fact that he travels with a big entourage; I get that being PM carries risks most of us can’t dream of. That said, these are not normal times.</p>
<p>Most of us would have loved to have visited family this weekend but we didn’t. We stayed home.</p>
<p>My parents are a short drive away and yet I have not seen them since they got back from Florida more than three weeks ago and I won’t see them soon.</p>
<p>Health officials warn against visiting anyone that you don’t already live with.</p>
<p>We are told time and again, including by Trudeau, that these are the sacrifices we have to make to fight COVID-19. On Saturday — just before he hopped in the motorcade and broke all the rules — Trudeau invoked the sacrifice of the men at Vimy Ridge to encourage us all to follow the rules.</p>
<p>Then he went to the cottage to see his wife and kids who have been living there for weeks and guess what, they had a big Easter egg hunt outside and posted it on social media.</p>
<p>At times like this, we need leaders who will lead by example; this weekend, Trudeau was not that leader.</p>
<p>He was showing he doesn’t follow the rules he sets for the little people and by posting the photos online, he and his family were openly mocking us.

<h3 id="ipolitics-am-pm-trudeau-resumes-daily-covid-19-briefings-following-two-day-easter-break">iPolitics AM: PM Trudeau resumes daily COVID-19 briefings following two-day Easter break</h3>

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau holds a press conference to give an update from self isolation at Rideau Cottage in Ottawa to give an update on the government&rsquo;s response to COVID-19 outbreaks on Mar. 17, 2020. Andrew Meade/iPolitics</p>
<p>ALSO TODAY: House health, Senate internal economy committees hold remote meetings — Ottawa Board of Trade hosts virtual town hall</p>
<p>After taking a two-day break to spend the Easter long weekend with his family, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is set to resume what has, over the course of the last four weeks, become his daily mid-morning routine. This, of course, refers to him emerging from Rideau Cottage to deliver an on-camera update on the ongoing push to limit the spread of the coronavirus while simultaneously providing emergency aid to individuals, businesses and industry sectors as a result of the country-wide shutdown. (11:15 AM EDT)</p>
<p>Among the issues about which he can expect to be questioned when he opens the floor to the media assembled outside the residence:</p>
<p>A hot-off-the-presses report from the Star’s Tonda MacCharles with new details on the decision to donate personal protective gear — including masks and gowns — that, as per the story, “was on the verge of expiry” to China in the weeks before the outbreak hit Canada.</p>
<p>An edict from Ottawa advising the provinces “not to claw back Canada Emergency Response Benefits from people on social assistance who have lost low-wage work due to the COVID-19 crisis,” as outlined by the Star’s social justice reporter Laurie Monsebraaten.</p>
<p>The latest developments on the sweeping ban on non-essential travel between Canada and the United States, which is currently set to expire on April 21 and is now, as per the Globe and Mail, the focus of cross-border discussions over whether to extend it “for at least another few weeks.”</p>
<p>Alberta Premier Jason Kenney’s comments to CBC News, in which he hinted that he might circumvent Canadian federal health regulators by authorizing the use of medications, tests and treatments that have gotten the green light from “a highly credible regulator … like the European Union, Australia or the United States” instead of waiting “for Health Canada to catch up.”</p>
<p>Trudeau may also get a question or two on his aforementioned decision to join his family at his other official residence by Harrington Lake, where they’ve been ensconced since his wife, Sophie, wrapped up her 14-day stint in self-isolation after testing positive for the virus last month.</p>
<p>As CBC News notes, “Quebec’s public health officials have asked Ontarians not to go to their country residences across the provincial border,” although a PMO spokesman insisted that the Trudeau family “continue to follow all public health guidelines.”</p>
<p>Those same topics will undoubtedly come up during the daily noon-hour media availability with ministers and senior public health officials. (noon)</p>
<p>UPDATE: With less than a week to go before the House is set to return to regular programming, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has booked a mid-morning spot in the Commons Foyer to explain the rationale behind his party’s push for “regular accountability sessions to get the best results for Canadians.” (10 AM)</p>
<p>Also on the political agenda today:</p>
<p>The House HEALTH committee assembles — via video conference, of course — for its weekly briefing session on Canada’s response to the pandemic, which will include virtual appearances by University of Ottawa professor Amir Attaran and Canadian Institutes of Health Research president Michael Strong , as well as senior officials representing the departments of agriculture and agri-food, citizenship and immigration, employment and social development and industry (2 – 4 PM)</p>
<p>committee assembles — via video conference, of course — for its weekly briefing session on Canada’s response to the pandemic, which will include virtual appearances by , as well as senior officials representing the departments of agriculture and agri-food, citizenship and immigration, employment and social development and industry (2 – 4 PM) On the Senate side, INTERNAL ECONOMY members hold their first remote get-together since the Upper House signed off on a proposal to allow several committees to meet during the current hiatus. (6 PM)</p>
<p>OUTSIDE THE PRECINCT</p>
<p>Middle Class Prosperity Minister and capital-area MP Mona Fortier teams up with Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson and Ontario heritage minister Lisa McLeod at a “virtual town hall meeting”organized by the Ottawa Board of Trade, during which she’ll highlight “measures brought forward by the government to support Canadians and businesses impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak.” (8 AM EDT)</p>
<p>FRESH FROM iPOLITICS</p>
<p>HOT OFF THE WIRES</p>
<p>AT COMMITTEE</p>
<p>Due to the parliamentary shutdown, all House and Senate committees are currently suspended, and are not expected to resume regular meetings until April 20.</p>
