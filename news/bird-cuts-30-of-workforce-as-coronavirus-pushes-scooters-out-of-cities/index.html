Dockless scooter companies charged into cities in 2018, promising a mobility revolution with cheap, clean rides and billions of dollars in venture capital backing. Yet they soon faced roadblocks, including shaky business models, safety concerns and fast-moving city regulators. At the start of 2020, cash-losing operators were shrinking their headcounts and vehicle fleets.</p>
<p>Now as governments around the world fight to slow the spread of the coronavirus, the companies are facing a deeper existential challenge. The two largest, Lime and Bird, drastically reduced fleets by mid-March.</p>
<p>Santa Monica-based Bird began major layoffs Friday, cutting 30% of its workforce “due to the financial and operational impact” of the pandemic, according to an internal memo from Chief Executive Travis VanderZanden. “We just raised hundreds of millions from investors,” VanderZanden wrote, “but given all the uncertainty, we needed to ensure a cash runway to last through the end of 2021.”</p>
<p>Several other start-ups, including Wheels and Uber-owned Jump, say they’re looking at how to keep operating as people are ordered to stay at home and rider demand plummets. The appeal of sharing a high-touch vehicle with an unknown number of strangers has succumbed to the fear of viral transmission.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Lime CEO and co-founder Brad Bao wrote in a blog post on March 21 that the startup is “winding down or pausing” service in all markets but South Korea. Prior to the pandemic, the company operated nearly 120,000 scooters in 30 countries across the Americas and Europe. Bird announced it is removing its fleets in six U.S. cities: Sacramento; San Francisco; San Jose; Portland, Ore.; Miami and Coral Gables, Fla. It had already pulled vehicles from 21 European cities.</p>
<p>Jump has paused electric bike and scooter rentals in most of its European markets and trimmed the size of its fleets across the U.S. It stopped service entirely in Sacramento at the city’s request. Lyft Inc. has continued to operate its network of mostly docked bikeshare systems in eight U.S. markets. So far, it’s kept dockless scooters available for rent in all urban markets but Miami. Every company with vehicles in circulation said that they have heightened their handlebar sanitation protocols and are encouraging riders to do the same.</p>
<p>The sudden disappearance of scooters and e-bikes comes after months of industry turbulence. Bird and Lime have struggled to raise money from investors, and both cut staff starting late last year. The companies, once singularly focused on growth, have realized their problematic business plans need rethinking.</p>
<p>Last year, talks of an acquisition of Bird or Lime by Uber didn’t pan out. Some industry watchers said the eye-popping valuations of each — in 2019, Bird and Lime hit $2.5 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively — were a factor. The Information reported Thursday that layoffs are now imminent at Lime, as it seeks emergency funding at a valuation of just $400 million. (A Lime communications officer denied that layoffs are coming.) Uber and Lyft, both of which went public in 2019, conducted layoffs in their own micromobility divisions late last year, and both recently pulled dockless vehicles from several markets.</p>

<p>Wheels and Lime say ridership was rising before the start of widespread social distancing. The decisions to reduce urban fleets now have been motivated largely by a sense of responsibility for the health of their riders and workers who maintain the vehicles, Lime and Bird say. The economics of the business is also an undeniable factor, said David Spielfogel, Lime’s chief policy officer. “If everyone is sheltering in place and not moving around, the business is no longer sustainable,” he said. Tourists, which generate significant scooter ridership in many cities, have also vanished from most markets. While there may be ways for Lime to generate revenue during the crisis, that’s not a priority while people are at home, and “governments are trying to get the virus under control,” Spielfogel said.</p>
<p>Many investors, already skeptical about the viability of the e-scooter business, say the current situation could be the nail in the industry’s coffin. “I’ve heard a number of people compare the plight of the scooter companies to Uber and Lyft. Like them, scooters are seeing plummeting usage,” says Aaron Michel, a partner at the early-stage venture capital firm 1984 Ventures, which has no investments in the micromobility space. “Unlike Uber and Lyft, though, the verdict was pretty much in on the scooter industry before the virus arrived.” Companies without major backers will go under, he expects, while deeper-pocketed businesses will pare back to bare minimums.</p>
<p>Emily Castor Warren, a principal and director of policy at the transportation planning firm Nelson\Nygaard and a former director of policy at both Lyft and Lime, agreed that the pandemic could be a death knell for scooter businesses with large overhead costs, especially those that were already in an uncertain financial position. “I think it’s pretty dire,” she says. “If these lockdowns persist, they’re going to have to, at the very least, undertake major layoffs to core teams, because the one cost they can’t bring down to zero is salaries for headcount and real estate for their offices.”</p>
<p>The short-term outlook may not be so precarious for every micromobility company. Wheels, a startup that operates dockless electric minibikes in 17 cities in Europe and the U.S., raised $50 million in October in a funding round led by DBL Partners.</p>
<p>The company announced on March 27 that it will roll out vehicles with self-cleaning handlebars and brake levers that can be used for delivery services and other essential uses, while its shared bikes are suspended until the end of March. The company has partnered with NanoSeptic, which has developed the self-cleaning surface. The technology uses mineral nano-crystals that continuously oxidize organic contaminants.</p>
<p>Scooter operator Spin hasn’t felt the same capital pressure as some of its peers — it’s owned by the Ford Motor Co. Until this week, Spin was the sole scooter provider to maintain normal operations — in its case, serving 66 U.S. cities and 12 college campuses—but it changed course on Tuesday. The company will retain scooters only in Austin; Baltimore; Denver; Detroit; Los Angeles; Portland, Ore.; San Francisco; Tampa; and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>“We have made the decision to pause our operations, as of today, in all other cities due to significant demand drop off as communities combat the fast-spreading virus,” the company’s co-founders wrote in a Medium post. “This pause will remain in effect until further notice.” Spin’s communications staff couldn’t clarify which specific markets would be losing vehicles, and Ford’s communications team rebuffed multiple requests for interviews with executives.</p>
<p>Molly Turner, a lecturer in business and public policy at UC Berkeley and an advisor to technology startups including Spin, said the cities the company is continuing to serve may indicate where it’s had the greatest financial success to date. The markets Spin is pulling out of may show “where scooters weren’t a viable business or didn’t have enough penetration to succeed without the special partnerships or promotions that are impossible right now,” she says.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>That may be the case for all companies in question, as travel right now, no matter the mode of transportation, has come to a near standstill. Several scooter operators, including Jump, Lime, Spin and Wheels, are considering opportunities to partner with local governments or essential service providers as a way to continue operations, as residents avoid buses, trains and other public transit under shelter-in-place mandates. New York City saw ridership on its Citi Bike system jump 67% in mid-March, after Mayor Bill de Blasio announced social distancing guidelines. On March 21, ridership on the city’s subway, the nation’s largest mass transit system, was down 87% from the same time last year.</p>
<p>Some investors view the decline in transit use as one reason for optimism about the midterm prospects for micromobility. Assuming commuters remain skittish about crowding into buses and subway cars after the shelter-in-place orders lift, scooter and e-bike companies could take the opening to push for looser regulations and the reversal of the scooter bans ordered in some world cities, says Bradley Tusk, a co-founder and managing partner of Tusk Ventures and an investor in Bird. “With warming weather, better needs, and arguments for legalization and less saturated markets, [and] with companies like Lime contracting, there’s a legitimate opportunity over the next 3-6 months,” he wrote in an email.</p>
<p>An additional upside could come in selling or leasing scooters and e-bikes directly to riders, says Niko Bonatsos, managing director at General Catalyst, an early-stage venture capital fund that hasn’t invested in dockless rentals. “Right now we hate each other and can’t stand each other’s company, and getting an Uber or grabbing someone else’s shared scooter might not be the best idea,” he said. “But if you have your own bike, now is the time to use it.” Bird offers a monthly leasing program, as does the electric moped startup Zebra.</p>
<p>For cities that have come to value shared micromobility services as a sustainable transportation option, subsidizing them may be the only way to secure their existence long-term, Castor Warren says. Some traditional docked bikeshare systems, including those in Boston, Chicago, and Washington, D.C., are owned by local governments but operated by Lyft. “In that model the city has more ability to ensure continuity of operations and ensure that service will be provided to the public, because they’ve extended their own resources, even if the bottom falls out of the economy,” she says.</p>
<p>Such a scenario would prove what skeptics have said about dockless scooters and ride-hailing companies from the start. History has shown that establishing a new transportation service often requires massive subsidies from investors or governments.</p>
<p>For now, even though they may be allowed to continue to operate in many cities, the scooter companies are going it alone. Says Turner: “They’re not getting a bailout from Congress.”</p>

<h3 id="印度人的-wemo-scooterbounce-推出共享機車用科技紓解印度的壅塞交通">【印度人的 WeMo Scooter】Bounce 推出共享機車，用科技紓解印度的壅塞交通</h3>
<p><img src="https://buzzorange.com/techorange/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/Bounce.jpg" alt="img">
【為什麼我們要編譯這篇文章】印度是全世界塞車最嚴重的國家之一，班加羅爾居民平均每年「塞」了 246 小時。為了解決交通問題，印度新創提出共享機車與共乘等方案。意外的是，共享機車竟促進居民搭乘大眾交通運輸工具。印度的經驗，能給全球怎樣的交通解決方案？（責任編輯：郭家宏）</p>
<p>據衛星導航公司 TomTom 統計，有印度矽谷之稱的班加羅爾，是全世界交通最紊亂的城市。其壅塞程度平均每人每年塞車 246 小時，相當每年有 10 天在車陣和廢氣中度過，不只生活品質差，也造成環境的負擔。</p>
<p>像班加羅爾這樣的城市，最需要智慧城市的轉型去應付過多人口和車潮所產生的外部成本。而有印度矽谷之稱的班加羅爾，剛好有足夠的創新能量解決這個痛點。</p>
<p>Bounce 推出共享機車，提升居民搭大眾交通運輸工具的頻率</p>
<p>創立於 2014 年，Bounce 是一間出租共享機車的新創，在班加羅爾擁有超過 1.7 萬台電動和汽油機車。用戶可以透過 App 的地圖中尋找機車並租賃，一小時租金大約 6 元，租還地點沒有限制，服務內涵類似台灣的 WeMo Scooter 和 GoShare。</p>
<p>CTO 兼共同創辦人的 Varun Agni 受 CNN Business 訪問時表示，一開始創立 Bounce ，只是想做通勤大眾運輸化和提供可負擔的移動選項這兩件事，但沒想到舒緩交通居然是現在最大的副產品，幾乎半數人的起終點會在地鐵站，這項服務促使民眾選擇大眾交通運輸。</p>
<p>現在 Bounce 在印度超過 30 個城市中營運，在班加羅爾每天有超過 12 萬的騎乘次數。Agni 表示，預計將在 2020 年底前將電動車的比例增加至半數。</p>
<p>Quick Ride 推出共乘服務，減少車流量又增添社交新意</p>
<p>印度空氣品質研究網站 Urban Emissions Info. 指出，交通是造成班加羅爾空汙的最大元兇。而在班加羅爾有間新創 Quick Ride，用雲端配對共乘的服務減少城市中的車流和碳排放，達成永續通勤的目標。</p>
<p>欲共乘的使用者只要在 Quick Ride 的 App 上輸入欲前往的地點，系統自動與「順路」的駕駛配對後，共乘者前往接送地點上車，費用則是以里程計算，到達目的地下車後自動於共乘者的帳戶扣款。這種方法不但使駕駛省下每日通勤的燃料費用，也讓共乘者有更方便的通勤方式，同時每天還可以認識新朋友，跨大日常的社交圈。</p>
<p>截至今日，Quick Ride 在印度 9 個城市營運，共協助完成超過 3,800 萬次共乘，預防了超過 79,000 噸的二氧化碳產生。</p>
<p>企業與 Quick Ride 合作，為員工創造永續通勤環境</p>
<p>印度許多企業已經和 Quick Ride 透過免費的合作，鼓勵員工選擇共乘作為通勤的方式，以此建立公司永續的形象。舉例來說，知名國際顧問公司 Capgemini 的印度辦公室在 2017 年發起了 #CAReToShare 的員工共乘活動，截至 2019 已有超過 70% 的員工連署支持共乘。</p>
<p>Capgemini 資深總監 Vijay Chandramohan 表示，這項合作和活動的主旨，是在為員工創造更方便的日常通勤的同時，也試著減少我們城市的污染。</p>
