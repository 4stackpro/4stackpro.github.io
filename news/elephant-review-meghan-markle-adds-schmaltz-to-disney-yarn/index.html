Last autumn, before she and her husband made it into their current Californian lockdown, Meghan Markle recorded the narration for this lavish new documentary from the Disneynature production unit, streaming on Disney+, her fee being a donation to the Elephants Without Borders conservation charity working in Botswana. The film shows the annual, dramatic migration of an elephant herd across the Kalahari in search of food and drinking water, moving from Botswana’s Okavango Delta in its dry season, heading for the Zambezi and the Victoria Falls: the last being an awe-inspiring phenomenon which Meghan matches with her own spectacular torrents of schmaltz. She takes to Disney-narration like an anthropomorphic duck to water. “For elephants, family is everything! In this tight-knit group, someone always has your back!”</p>
<p>The film is directed by Mark Linfield, Vanessa Berlowitz and Alastair Fothergill, veterans of the BBC Natural History Unit, and they get some great scenes and striking moments, working in the immersive, intimate nature-doc tradition pioneered by David Attenborough. But they are also giving us something in the somewhat silly Disneyfied tradition of The Lion King and The Jungle Book, with a cutesy narrative sneakily fashioned in the edit, and everything but Elton John belting out Circle of Life on the soundtrack. The heroes are the herd’s ageing 40-year-old matriarch Gaia, her younger sister Shani and one adorable little baby elephant: “Meet Jomo!” coos Meghan.</p>
<p>As for the others in the herd, they do not have names, and it takes an effort of will to remember that the main three don’t really have names either, unless you speak elephant. “Jomo” “Shani” and “Gaia” are the exotic human names that the directors have given them. There are some making-of-featurette-style scenes over the closing credits, but we don’t get shots of Mark, Vanessa and Alastair arguing in the production office about appropriate names for two mama elephants and a lovable kid. “Elspeth, Mavis and Brian?” — “Nah, not elemental and African enough.” “Nala, Sarabi and Simba?” — “I think it’s been done.”</p>
<p>And so Gaia, Shani, Jomo and the gang set off on their epic quest, and there are some undoubtedly striking overhead shots of the network of water-holes (some treacherously dry) as they lumberingly schlep across the colossal plain. The herd leader’s instinct-memory for where to go is part of an unbroken chain of knowledge stretching back for millennia, and Linfield occasionally shows this with little subliminal speeded-up sequences showing hallucinatory flashes of desert and sky.</p>
<p>There are some fascinating scenes and set-pieces: especially a little calf having to be rescued from one pool’s churned-up mud, and the elephants getting water by tearing the bark from the Baobab trees. But again and again, Meghan is given outrageously unverifiable things to say, such as: “Gaia remembers these birds leading her mother to the water….” And Shani later supposedly “…looks back on all the lessons she learned from Gaia.” You expect that this film, like an episode of The Office or Parks and Recreation, is suddenly going to include a shot of Gaia telling on off-camera interviewer: “Mmm, yeah, I totally remember my mom being led by those birds over to this water…”</p>
<p>Once the target has been achieved, a dry season rolls around, and the elephants must turn around and head home. All the while, they are concerned about meanie carnivore-predators, such as the crocodiles who hang out in precisely those shallow waters where elephants like drinking, and of course lions, whose Disney-royal glamour status this film warily concedes. It’s a technically impressive work with some lovely images — and a bit of a sugary taste.</p>
<p>•Elephant is released on Disney+ on 3 April.

<h3 id="elderly-asian-elephant-is-euthanized-at-the-national-zoo">Elderly Asian elephant is euthanized at the National Zoo</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bu2QX7vZB5LrxegcoRTeEX67uWY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/M5Y6CARYUEI6VIP7YSGB2WNEUE.jpg" alt="img">
Her keepers called her “the queen.”</p>
<p>Her euthanasia was done with drugs, the same kind used to put down a pet, and took place in the elephant barn, out of sight of her compound mates Bozie, 45, and Shanthi, 44, the zoo said.</p>
<p>She was first sedated at about 8:15 a.m., and after she laid down, the euthanasia drugs were administered. She died around 9:15 a.m., her longtime keeper Marie Galloway said.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Bozie and Shanthi were then permitted to have some time with her body. They were curious but did not dramatically react, the zoo said.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“I feel like it was completely right,” said Galloway, an elephant manager who had been Ambika’s keeper for 33 years. “For me personally, it was similar to when my mother died at 88 . . . comfortably at home. Ambika went much the same way.</p>
<p>“The time was right. Her discomfort was evident. She appeared to be tired and in pain. . . . She’s a very social elephant. She’s an elephant’s elephant, and a people’s elephant. She loves her interaction. And to see that disappearing . . .</p>
<p>“So we gave her a gift of peace from that. She was comfortable and relaxed the entire way through.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Keepers and veterinarians wore masks and gloves.</p>
<p>“We brought her into one of the stalls where we planned to do it,” Galloway said. “She was eating bok choy the whole time and a little bit of celery, and we used that to keep her in place. It was just the right spot for her to go down without hitting walls.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Ambika often slept standing up. And when she was given the initial sedation, “we expected that she would try very hard to stay in a standing position,” Galloway said.</p>
<p>“She set her legs and pressed her head against the bollards in front of her,” she said. “You could see her just wanting to lay down . . . a little tremor went through her body and she just gave in to the wish to lay down and went down.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Blood samples were taken, and the zoo’s chief veterinarian, Don Neiffer, gave the euthanasia drugs.</p>
<p>“Once that stuff is given, the vets confirm that she indeed has passed,” said senior curator and elephant specialist Bryan Amaral.</p>
<p>“We look for breaths and of course we look for heartbeat,” he said. “At that point everybody can have a few quiet moments with her.”</p>
<p>Galloway said: “It went as well as it possibly could. She was surrounded by her whole team of keepers.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“The hard part for us was not hugging each other,” because of the virus restrictions.</p>
<p>Ambika was a cautious elephant and not a matriarch. But she “was very wise,” Galloway said. “She knew a lot about how to be an elephant. . . . She was able to teach by example.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Her roughly 6,500-pound remains were removed from the zoo late Friday night with a front end loader and a truck and taken to a facility where a necropsy, an autopsy for an animal, was underway Saturday.</p>
<p>The remains were to be “disarticulated” and incinerated. “It’s a huge job,” Amaral said. No ashes will be kept for sentimental reasons.</p>
<p>It was the second euthanization of an animal at the zoo this month. An American bison named Zora had to be put down March 3 after she thrashed in a stall and broke her left hind leg. She was 7 and had been at the zoo for six years.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Ambika, one of seven elephants the zoo had, had been ailing in recent months.</p>
<p>She had been treated for osteoarthritis a decade ago, but the staff was able to ease her pain and slow the progression of the disease, the zoo said.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>She received anti-inflammatory drugs, analgesics and joint supplements. But she also began to develop lesions on her footpads and nails.</p>
<p>For those, she got foot baths, pedicures and antibiotics. But the lesions could not be controlled and got worse, the zoo said.</p>
<p>“Last week, her keepers noticed that her right-front leg, which bore the brunt of her weight, developed a curve that weakened her ability to stand,” the zoo said in a statement.</p>
<p>Given those factors, as well as her age, physical and social decline, and poor quality of life, the staff decided to euthanize her, the zoo said.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“We were at a point where we knew this was the best option for her,” Amaral said.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Ambika was captured in India at 8 and worked for years as a logging elephant. She came to the zoo in 1961, during the administration of President John F. Kennedy.</p>
<p>“It’s sad in a lot of ways,” Amaral said. “They don’t get much sweeter than she was. . . . It’s the end of an era, 59 years at the National Zoo. . . . Seventy-two years for an elephant is a pretty good run.

<h3 id="amacimbi-harvester-killed-by-elephant">Amacimbi harvester killed by elephant</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/07/ele.jpg" alt="img">
Thupeyo Muleya, Beitbridge Bureau</p>
<p>A woman (58) from Lukange community in Beitbridge East was trampled to death by an elephant while two other villagers watched helplessly on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Elisa Chivalaula died while harvesting mopani worms (mashonzha/amacimbi) in a bushy area near Dite. She was in the company of Ouma Moyo (36) and Selina Ndou (70).</p>
<p>It is reported that the women got into trouble after running into a herd of elephants.</p>
<p>The police officer commanding Beitbridge District Chief Superintendent Tichaona Nyongo said the matter was being treated as sudden death.</p>
<p>“Indications are that on Saturday, 28 March, she left her homestead intending to go and harvest mopane worms in a bush about 7km from her homestead in the company of Ouma Moyo (36) and Selina Ndou (70) both from the same village,” he said.</p>
<p>“While harvesting the mopani worms they found themselves in the midst of a herd of elephants and prompting them to run away in different directions.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, one elephant caught up with the now deceased and trampled her to death in full view of Ndou who was hiding behind the bushes”.</p>
<p>The matter was reported at the ZRP Dite Police Base leading to the recovery of the badly injured body. No foul play was suspected and post mortem was waived by a local magistrate.</p>
<p>“As police we urge people to be highly vigilant as they move around in the bushes, especially during the time of harvesting these mopani worms. Precious lives are lost as a result of fatal attacks by wild animals and snakes,” said Chief Supt Nyongo.</p>
<p>The incident occured a few months after a six-year-old boy from Chituripasi in Beitbridge East was attacked and killed by an elephant while his sister watched helplessly. The boy was coming from school in the company of his elder sister and another minor when they came across the jumbo.</p>
<p>The elder sister fled to the other side of the road while the now deceased tried to flee to the nearest homestead, resulting in him being fatally attacked.
