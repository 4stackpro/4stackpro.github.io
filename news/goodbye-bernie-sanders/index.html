<p>(CNN) Bernie Sanders made the unthinkable seem possible, briefly &ndash; that a democratic socialist could capture a major US party nomination. But in the the end, Democrats didn&rsquo;t want his &ldquo;revolution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Vermont senator, who folded his Democratic campaign Tuesday , built a vibrant progressive movement advocating the biggest role for the state since the 1960s, in health care, education, business and environmental policy. He gave voice on the left, as Donald Trump did on the right, to voters alienated by globalization and the school of free market economics defined by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher.</p>
<p>Sanders ran against what he branded as corrupt party elites, thrilling northern liberals and younger voters. But rival Joe Biden&rsquo;s victory suggests that the &lsquo;establishment&rsquo; remains the party&rsquo;s best hope of winning in November, uniting votes from African Americans, working class whites, suburban women and more educated voters. Moderates and not liberals took back the House for Democrats in the 2018 midterms, so party leaders will be relieved Sanders is out.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say Sanders didn&rsquo;t change the party. Democrats need his millions of voters to embrace Biden, if they are to beat Donald Trump. So, a Biden administration would likely be slightly more liberal on issues like financing college, providing health care and reining in Wall Street excess than the Obama White House.</p>
<p>Though a terse and rumpled character, there is no doubting the sincerity of Sanders&rsquo; lifelong beliefs. As he shuffles out of the race, taking his Brooklyn-accented speeches on millionaires and billionaires with him, he may find satisfaction that his principles have fresh resonance. One outcome of the coronavirus pandemic will likely be a reinvigorated role for the state in taking care of the common welfare of the people. It might not go as far as Sanders might like, but that&rsquo;s his campaign in a nutshell.</p>
<p>No one points a finger like Bernie Sanders. Farewell to the Vermonter and his tireless finger jabs. (Which you can still catch in the Senate, if it ever reopens.) Above, Sanders at a campaign rally on March 8 in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not me, Us&rsquo;

<h3 id="bernie-sanders-suspends-his-presidential-campaign">Bernie Sanders suspends his presidential campaign</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.politico.com/a7/39/04f9c7bc4056aa183139a978b280/200408-bernie-sanders-msm-773.jpg" alt="img">
Sanders said that while Biden will be the nominee, he will stay on the ballot to collect delegates for the convention, &ldquo;where we will be able to exert significant influence over the party platform.”</p>
<p>As recently as Monday, his team told aides it was looking for a regional delegates coordinator, according to an internal email.</p>
<p>By dropping out of the race, Sanders is forgoing any effort to soldier on purely as a movement candidate for his progressive agenda. That prospect — though appealing to many of his most ideological supporters — appeared to dim recently amid the deadly coronavirus outbreak, which has shut down campaign rallies, delayed upcoming primaries and consumed the public’s attention.</p>
<p>“Bernie has put his heart and soul into not only running for president, but for the causes and issues he has been dedicated to his whole life. So, I know how hard a decision this was for him to make — and how hard it is for the millions of his supporters — especially younger voters — who have been inspired and energized and brought into politics by the progressive agenda he has championed,” said Biden in a statement. “Bernie has done something rare in politics. He hasn’t just run a political campaign; he’s created a movement.“</p>
<p>Sanders’ withdrawal marks the culmination of one of the most dramatic turnarounds in presidential primary history, with the Vermont senator on the losing end. A month and a half ago, Sanders appeared in control of the nominating contest, coming off early victories in New Hampshire and Nevada.</p>
<p>But Biden’s victory in South Carolina led rank-and-file voters, and a number of former rivals for moderate support in the Democratic primary, to coalesce around the former vice president, who drubbed Sanders in 10 of 14 states on Super Tuesday and nearly all of the states that came later in March, including a three-state sweep — Arizona, Florida and Illinois — as well as the critical general-election state of Michigan. His withdrawal came a day after the Wisconsin primary, whose result has not yet been announced but was expected to be bad for Sanders.

Bernie Sanders Leaves 2020 Presidential Race</p>
<p>MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:</p>
<p>Bernie Sanders dropped out of the presidential race today. Here&rsquo;s the Vermont senator speaking to supporters via livestream video.</p>
<p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
<p>BERNIE SANDERS: I wish I could give you better news, but I think you know the truth. And that is that we are now some 300 delegates behind Vice President Biden, and the path toward victory is virtually impossible.</p>
<p>KELLY: Sanders indicates there his departure means former Vice President Joe Biden is now the presumptive Democratic nominee. Let&rsquo;s bring in NPR&rsquo;s Asma Khalid.</p>
<p>Hey, Asma.</p>
<p>ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Hi there.</p>
<p>KELLY: So this was not unexpected given the clear delegate lead that Joe Biden holds. But how did Bernie Sanders explain his decision today?</p>
<p>KHALID: Well, you&rsquo;re right, I should say, Mary Louise. This was not unexpected, and that&rsquo;s in part because the Sanders campaign had said itself a few weeks ago that he would be reassessing things. And that came after a series of pretty crippling losses he had in early March. You know, the way that he explained things today is - I should point out, he would have needed at least 64% of the remaining delegates in order to become the nominee. And while that&rsquo;s not mathematically impossible, it is rather unlikely just given the momentum that he&rsquo;s had in this race and the fact that, frankly, he was not able to broaden the base of progressive supporters that he&rsquo;s had. So I think, you know, today what we heard from him was an acknowledgment of that numerical reality, especially as the coronavirus pandemic has also just upended the entire campaign. And he said in this particular moment, he did not feel like he could continue on in good consciousness.</p>
<p>KELLY: He did also speak about what he had accomplished with his campaign, what he feels he has accomplished. Give us some more detail on that.</p>
<p>KHALID: He did. You know, he talked about the ideas that he has long championed now being a part of the more mainstream conversation in the Democratic Party, things like a $15 minimum wage, universal health care.</p>
<p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
<p>SANDERS: It was not long ago that people considered these ideas radical and fringe. Today, they are mainstream ideas, and many of them are already being implemented in cities and states across the country.</p>
<p>KHALID: And he also talked about the backbone of his coalition. These are young people.</p>
<p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p>
<p>SANDERS: Please also appreciate that not only are we winning the struggle ideologically, we are also winning it generationally. The future of our country rests with young people.</p>
<p>KHALID: And, you know, Mary Louise, he has had, I would say, a rather large policy influence in the Democratic Party. You know, how many Democratic debates focused on health care specifically around his ideas around &ldquo;Medicare for All?&rdquo; And, you know, though he was conceding here in these livestream remarks, he was also touting those ideological gains that he&rsquo;s made.</p>
<p>KELLY: One big question now, of course, is whether Sanders supporters will shift their support to Joe Biden. Did Sanders endorse Biden today?</p>
<p>KHALID: Well, he did not explicitly use those words I endorse Biden. But he has long said that he would support whoever the nominee is. And he reiterated that desire to unify, you know, the entire Democratic Party behind a candidate who could beat Donald Trump. He called Joe Biden himself a very decent man. But Sanders also said something that kind of was unusual. It caught my ear. He said he&rsquo;s going to stay on the ballot for upcoming primaries. The thought is that he&rsquo;d continue to accumulate delegates, which he could then use at the Democratic National Convention to influence the party&rsquo;s platform and rules. But again, you know, I think he has made it pretty clear throughout this campaign cycle that he would stand behind whoever was the likely nominee.</p>
<p>KELLY: What has been the reaction from the Biden camp to the fact that Sanders says he&rsquo;s going to stay on the ballot, he will keep accumulating delegates?</p>
<p>KHALID: Well, Biden praised Sanders as a whole. They didn&rsquo;t even acknowledge that. He said that he had, you know, touted these ideas for a long time, that he had not just created a political campaign, he had created a movement. And a lot of this is around the focus that, you know, they&rsquo;re aware of what happened in 2016. They don&rsquo;t want a repeat of that. They want to unify the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>KELLY: NPR&rsquo;s Asma Khalid reporting there on the news today, Bernie Sanders dropping out of the 2020 presidential race.</p>
<p>Thank you, Asma.</p>
<p>KHALID: You&rsquo;re welcome.</p>
