<h3 id="ontario-emergency-alert-gets-some-hilarious-reactions-on-twitter">Ontario Emergency Alert Gets some Hilarious Reactions On Twitter</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.narcity.com/u/2020/04/04/424f1d3ce7f46aede051ab7c81ae4e71.jpeg_1200x630.jpeg" alt="img">
If you live in Ontario, you might have received a little surprise on your phone or TV. An Ontario emergency alert was sent out to remind people to stay home and only go out if necessary. In typical fashion, people had some hilarious reactions to it.</p>
<p>The alert was sent out on April 4 at around 2:00 p.m. It told people that now is the most important time to stay home and follow the strict guidelines put in place by the government.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone but essential workers need to stay home,&rdquo; the alert reads, &ldquo;only go out if absolutely necessary to pick up groceries, prescriptions or go to a medical appointment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The message received by Ontarians also warned them about the &ldquo;devastating effects&rdquo; that not social distancing can have, saying that it can &ldquo;endanger lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ontario has started to crack down on people who refuse to follow guidelines for social distancing. In Toronto, bylaw officers have been ticketing people who don&rsquo;t keep their distance from each other.</p>
<p>Like any emergency alert though, this one garnered some truly hilarious reactions from people who were not expecting it to come. Some of them even began mistakenly referring to it as an amber alert on Twitter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Petition to start every emergency alert with 30 seconds of smooth jazz so I know to brace myself for the scary loud noise. I’m all for the emergency measures, but I’d love to be eased into it to avoid panic-stabbing myself while slicing an apple.&rdquo; wrote @reidskii.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just heard the amber alert sound go off somewhere in the house and my dad yell in a very distressed tone &lsquo;WASH YOUR HANDS. WASH YOUR HANDS&rsquo;&rdquo; tweeted @mimitchi.</p>
<p>There were also people who helpfully reminded others that this was not technically an amber alert, as those are only issued for missing children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;AMBER Alert? You mean an EAS or Emergency Alert System are used for emergencies such as weather, civil &amp; national alerts. Amber Alerts are enacted when a child is in danger or kidnapped by an unknown stranger or a deranged parent,&rdquo; wrote @KWilds91.</p>
<p>Whatever kind of alert it is, it&rsquo;s probably good for everyone to be taking it seriously at this point.

<h3 id="after-2-year-old-goes-missing-amber-alert-takes-7-hours">After 2-year-old goes missing, Amber Alert takes 7 hours</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.13wmaz.com/assets/WMAZ/images/40439ed1-f2b2-4179-b30d-649100cc9212/40439ed1-f2b2-4179-b30d-649100cc9212_1140x641.jpg" alt="img">
MACON, Ga. — Amber Alerts are crucial resources for law enforcement when a child is missing and considered in danger, but when a 2-year-old Macon boy was allegedly abducted early Wednesday by a man who allegedly killed three people, the Georgia Amber Alert system didn&rsquo;t work the way it was supposed to.</p>
<p>The system is supposed to get the alert out fast. In this case, it took more than seven hours to get that first Amber Alert sent.</p>
<p>To issue an Amber Alert, law enforcement has to go through several steps.</p>
<p>First, a local agency notifies the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and gives them information about the case.</p>
<p>Then, the GBI sends it to the state communications center run by Georgia State Patrol (GSP).</p>
<p>From there, a GSP dispatcher notifies the Georgia Emergency Management Agency (GEMA) and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) to send out the Amber Alert broadcast.</p>
<p>GEMA is responsible for getting the alert on TV and radio broadcasts.</p>
<p>NCMEC pushes the alert to mobile phones, according to Georgia State Patrol.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s went wrong overnight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could have been a substantial help to us had it been put out in a timely manner,&rdquo; said Bibb Sheriff David Davis.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t, though.</p>
<p>The alleged shooting happened around 9:30 P.M, the abduction happened sometime after that.</p>
<p>Davis says his agency alerted the GBI around 12:30 a.m.</p>
<p>The GBI says they got the information to state patrol around 1 a.m., but state patrol didn&rsquo;t send the alert until around 8 a.m. Wednesday morning, more than 7 hours later.</p>
<p>By then, Davis says, the suspect accused of kidnapping the 2-year-old may not have even been in Georgia anymore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By 8:00, 8:30, he was probably substantially out of Georgia,&rdquo; said the Sheriff.</p>
<p>Two-year-old King Crockett was found safe in Florida Wednesday afternoon, when Florida Highway Patrol spotted the suspect, Caesar Crockett&rsquo;s vehicle in their state.</p>
<p>They managed to get King to safety, but Caesar refused to leave his car. He was in an armed standoff with Florida law enforcement.</p>
<p>We spoke with the toddler&rsquo;s family Wednesday afternoon before the child was found safe.</p>
<p>Amber Smith and Libby Rutland both wanted to know why it took so long to issue that alert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it was any other kid, it goes suddenly,&rdquo; said Smith. &ldquo;Why was the delay so much with our relative?&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to an emailed statement from state patrol, the answer is simple. Their dispatcher who was supposed to notify GEMA and NCMEC to push the alert never did that. GEMA and NCMEC weren&rsquo;t informed until the morning.</p>
<p>GSP called it &ldquo;a major error on the part of the dispatcher&rdquo; and said that dispatcher is now being investigated and could face internal discipline.</p>
<p>State patrol stressed this was their mistake, no other agencies are at fault.</p>
<p>State patrol also said they&rsquo;re working with the GBI to improve the notification process and adding training for communications staff to stress how serious Amber Alerts are.</p>
