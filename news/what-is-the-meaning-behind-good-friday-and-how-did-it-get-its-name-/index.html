Good Friday remembers the death of Jesus (Picture: Joe Raedle/Getty)</p>
<p>The Easter weekend is here and offers a time of reflection and repentance to those of Christian faith.</p>
<p>The period is one of the most religious in the calendar and commemorates the life, death and resurrection of Jesus.</p>
<p>Lent this year began on 26 February and saw Christians fast or abstain from indulgences for the past 40 days.</p>
<p>Good Friday, Easter Sunday and Easter Monday all fall within the last week of Lent – known as the Holy Week – and here’s what you need to know about the first of those days.</p>
<p>What is Good Friday?</p>
<p>Good Friday sees Christians remember the trial and death of Jesus on the cross.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, Jesus was arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane after being betrayed by Judas.</p>
<p>Jesus was made to carry his own cross (Picture: Francis G. Mayer/Getty)</p>
<p>He had spent the previous evening, Maundy Thursday, with his 12 disciples at the Last Supper.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Following his arrest, Jesus taken to the House of Annas where he was interrogated, flogged and sentenced to death.</p>
<p>He was then made to carry his own cross to the site of his execution where he was then crucified.</p>
<p>How did Good Friday get its name?</p>
<p>With the day being observed as one of sorrow and penance, it’s hard to understand why it would come to be known as Good Friday.</p>
<p>There are many theories behind the etymology, a popular one being the term good adapted from the word god – thus God’s Friday.</p>
<p>However the most accepted derivation of the name come from the obsolete adjective good, which often described something that was regarded as holy or pious by the Church.</p>
<p>This is apparent in the Christian greeting of ‘good tide’ at Christmas or on Shrove Tuesday.</p>

<h3 id="passover-good-friday-and-easter-how-to-celebrate-virtually-during-the-covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic">Passover, Good Friday and Easter: How to celebrate virtually during the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.whas11.com/assets/WHAS/images/06adffe4-324c-414c-92ca-c4fda5aae722/06adffe4-324c-414c-92ca-c4fda5aae722_1140x641.jpg" alt="img">
The week leading up to Easter Sunday is considered the Holy Week. This year, many will not be able to have traditional celebrations because of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Governors, city leaders across Ketuckiana, and the country have asked that all in-person religious services be postponed, until it&rsquo;s deemed safe to continue them. This means, celebrations and services will have to be done virtually or not at all.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to keep your faith and celebrate together at home as a family or individually from home:</p>
<p>Zoom, the tool many are now using for business meetings and school lessons, is one option. The company is allowing users to sign up and host video conferences for free, and is a fairly easy-to-use tool, even for the technologically-challenged. It&rsquo;s also a good option if you have a large group that normally gathers together for Passover, as it can hold probably more people than those dining room tables can.</p>
<p>FaceTime is another good option for iPhone and Mac users, especially if you typically have a more intimate Seder or will only have a few people calling in.</p>
<p>Google Hangouts also has a video chat tool that can connect up to 25 users together at one time, no matter what kind of phone or computer they&rsquo;re on. This option might be a bit more involved than Zoom technically, though, so this explainer sheet from Google is helpful.</p>
<p>Both Zoom and Google Hangouts offer multiple ways for users to join the video call, including the ability to just send participants meeting codes or links.</p>
<p>Facebook Live. If your church is doing a live via, make sure you have your notifications turned on. You&rsquo;ll get the alert when the pastor starts the live stream. Anyone hosting a live event should: Post notifications about it days in advance and start the live at least 5-10 minutes early. Let the stream be something scenic to give as many people as possible time to join before you actually begin the service.</p>
<p>House Party App which is good for large group chats. The greatest feature with this app is the ability for people to jump in and out of conversations. As long as you are friends with the host, users can enter and leave conversation no matter how many people are there.</p>
<p>Skype The Skype video chat app, group video calling for up to 50 people is available for free on just about any mobile device, tablet or computer.</p>
<p>What celebrations are part of Holy Week?</p>
<p>Passover</p>
<p>Passover 2020 starts at sundown on Wednesday, April 8th and ends at sundown on Thursday, April 16th. It&rsquo;s celebrated by the Jewish community locally and across the world.</p>
<p>What is Passover?</p>
<p>First of all, Passover in Hebrew is Pesach. Second of all, it&rsquo;s called Passover because the Angel of Death &ldquo;passed over&rdquo; the doorsteps of all the Jews in Egypt when the 10th plague, the killing of the first born, happened. So the angel passed over the homes, that&rsquo;s where we get Passover from. It&rsquo;s a celebration of the redemption by God from slavery in Egypt as we wandered into the desert to go to the promised land.</p>

<p>What is the significance of the holiday and how do you celebrate?</p>
<p>The service is called Seder which includes a Seder plate. There are six different places for six different items&ndash; so eggs, bitter herbs, lamb shank bone, charoset, which is a mixture of apples and honey and nuts, lettuce and then parsley or some kind of green to dip in salt water. The holiday lasts eight days, and Seders are often held on the first two nights. Each item on the Seder plate is representative of something having to do with the Passover story.</p>
<p>The Jewish Federation of Louisville have some resources to help you celebrate Passover virtually.</p>

<p>Maundy Thursday</p>
<p>Maundy Thursday, also called Holy Thursday or Sheer Thursday, the Thursday before Easter, observed in commemoration of Jesus Christ’s institution of the Eucharist during the Last Supper, according to Encyclopaedia Britannica online.</p>
<p>Good Friday</p>
<p>Good Friday occurs two days before Easter Sunday in the United States. It is the day when Christians commemorate Jesus Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion, which plays an important part in the Christian faith, according to the website Time and Date.</p>
<p>Getty Images/iStockphoto</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important day to Christianity, because it represents the sacrifices and suffering in Jesus&rsquo; life. Traditionally, some churches organize a prayer vigil on Good Friday for various causes, such as for cancer patients or for the American troops who have been sent to the middle-east. Some Christians may attend special church services or prayer vigils. The candles are often extinguished and statues, paintings and crosses may be draped in black, purple or gray cloth. Some Catholics treat Good Friday as a day of fasting, while others observe a partial fast involving the exclusion of meat.</p>
<p>Easter</p>
<p>Easter celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ on the third day after his crucifixion. Traditionally, many churches hold a service at sunrise on Easter Sunday. Some churches hold regularly scheduled Sunday services themed around the meaning of Easter.</p>
<p>Many church leaders have been honoring the call to stop in-person services and will have those services online, Facebook or on YouTube.</p>

<p>Easter has become known for boxes of chocolate eggs stacked like colourful fortresses on shop floors, but what is the story behind the Christian holiday?</p>
<p>As we prepare to spend the April bank holiday at home while the UK lockdown continues, it’s the perfect time to teach children about the true meaning of Easter.</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to know about the history of Good Friday and Easter Sunday - and why we celebrate today.</p>

<p>Easter Sunday, also known as Resurrection Sunday, is a Christian holiday that celebrates Jesus Christ rising from the dead.</p>
<p>The holiday has been celebrated across the world by Christians for millennia and it is considered the most important religious event among Christians.</p>
<p>According to the bible, specifically the Gospel of John in the New Testament, Jesus was resurrected three days after the date of his burial, which took place on a Friday afternoon, after he was crucified by the Roman cavalry around 30 AD.</p>
<p>Christians believe Jesus’ body was found by one of his followers, Mary Magdalene, who upon visiting his tomb found it empty.</p>
<p>She was later visited by an angel who explained that Jesus had risen from the dead.</p>
<p>Good Friday is also celebrated as a Christian bank holiday, prior to Easter Sunday, to commemorate Jesus’ burial.</p>
<p>How and why do we celebrate Easter?</p>
<p>Followers of Christianity often celebrate with church services, featuring Holy Communion or baptisms, hymns, lighting candles, and Easter lilies to name a few.</p>
<p>Additionally, due to England’s long history with christianity, in the form of Catholicism and Protestantism, and the Queen’s role as head of the Church of England, the holiday tradition has remained even among those of us who don’t follow the religion.</p>
<p>As a result, the Easter holiday has developed a range of more modern traditions, such as decorating eggs, making nests and chicks out of craft materials and gifting each other with chocolate eggs.</p>
<p>Additionally many businesses across the UK are required by the government to stop operating or to reduce their trading hours on this day, to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>How do we commemorate the Easter story?</p>
<p>There are several traditions which commemorate the Easter story, such as rolling easter eggs and dyeing boiled eggs a symbolic red.</p>
<p>Rolling easter egg down nearby hills is a symbolic re-enactment of rolling the stone away from Christ’s tomb. With the current lockdown in place, you can opt to roll your egg down some sloped indoor surfaces instead, such as stairs.</p>
<p>Dyeing hard boiled eggs the colour red, is meant to symbolise the blood of Christ. Additionally the egg’s can be hollowed out and kept as a keepsake. The hard shell represents Jesus’ closed tomb and the hollow interior represents the empty tomb after his resurrection.</p>
<p>Another way Christians commemorate Easter, is by eating fish on Good Friday. Christians believe since Jesus died for our sins by sacrificing his flesh on Good Friday, followers should avoid consuming meat on this day.</p>
<p>While fish is the flesh of an animal used for consumption and is therefore a meat by definition, in many religions, such as Christianity, fish is not considered a meat.</p>
<p>What Easter events can I stream at home?</p>
<p>Due to the coronavirus pandemic, this Easter Sunday shall be like no other.Just like many establishments across the country, Churches have also been forced to close their doors as the nation remains on lockdown, and many have since announced they will be holding Easter services online.</p>
<p>One such church is Canterbury Cathedral.</p>
<p>Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has announced today he will broadcast his service to his some 1,500 followers from an iPad in his family home.</p>
<p>You can watch the broadcast live on Sunday, on the Church of England’s Facebook page or website, or tune into BBC Radio 4 from 9am to follow the service.</p>
<p>Additionally, Christians who are also followers of the celebrity world, will be delighted by a star-studded service from the Houston-based Lakewood Church, owned by televangelist Joel Osteen.
