She talked to a leading daily about how they have kept themselves in self-isolation in their house. Shriya revealed, “Andrei began to develop a dry cough and fever. We rushed to a hospital, but the doctors were overwhelmed and urged us to leave. Chances are that even if he doesn’t have COVID-19, he will get it if he stays here, the doctors told us. So, we decided to go home and self-isolate ourselves and get treatment at home. We slept in different room and maintained a safe distance from each other. Thankfully he is feeling better now. So I hope the worst is behind us.”</p>
<p>The Drishyam actoress says she is missing India during the trying times. She said, “Though things are getting better here, I miss India. I don’t know when I’ll be able to come home again. My parents are in Mumbai and I’m constantly on video-call with them. My mum has shared some of her recipes and I’ve learnt to make them. But now I’m running out of spices and garam masala. So I’m worried that I won’t be able to eat desi food soon.”</p>
<p>Shriya also revealed that thousands have lost their jobs there, a lot of people are stranded in hotels, away from their loved ones. At the same time, many don&rsquo;t have a roof over their heads. Well, we hope things get better soon.
