NEW DELHI: Bhilwara in Rajasthan, recently labelled as an emerging hotspot for coronavirus, has now stopped reporting fresh cases. Thanks to strict implementation of lockdown by the state administration, strategic containment plan or healthcare workers stretching working hours, testing and serving the infected.</p>
<p>A week ago, 12 out of 18 cases in the state were from Bhilwara. The district was worst hit in Rajasthan, with 27 cases, and was glaring at the national tally too. But since the last five days, the district has not reported a single case, and in fact, 17 have recovered from the deadly disease.</p>
<p>However, two persons have died due to co-morbidities, while seven patients are nearing recovery, with 11 already discharged. The first case in Rajasthan was reported on 2 March.</p>
<p>Cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba in his recent meetings with state representatives said they can explore adopting the Bhilwara model of administration in controlling the spread of covid-19.</p>
<p>At the national level, testing for covid-19 is being considered low, but the Rajasthan government claims to have screened nearly five crore people and tested one crore 17 lakh households so far.</p>
<p>“Currently 34 places are under curfew in Rajasthan. Things were also controlled with imposition of curfew. 2 km area of a person found covid-19 positive is sealed and checks are done,&rdquo; said chief minister Ashok Gehlot, adding that out of the total number of positives in Rajasthan, nearly 30-32 are the evacuees from Iran at Jaisalmer and Jodhpur.</p>
<p>Gehlot, however, expressed concerns over cases with no history of either travel or contact with a covid-19 patient.</p>
<p>“People with travel history or any contact with positive patients are being isolated and checked. We sealed the borders the day we got to know about the case of the doctor in Bangar Hospital being positive with the virus in Bhilwara and it is becoming a learning ground for us,&rdquo; said the chief minister, adding that after that event, 22 lakh families from villages, nearly 10 lakh households in the city were tested, thus stopping the virus from further spreading.</p>
<p>According to the Rajasthan government, healthcare workers, home guards, police personnel, government officials and every other individual related to the screening of covid-19 patients are still working without any leaves.</p>
<p>“We are now on a war-footing level and working in a 6-part process beginning with the imposition of curfew, coordination work of police surveying colonies where the visitors of Bangar Hospital, where it all began, might be staying,&rdquo; said Harendra Mahawar, superintendent of police, Bhilwara.</p>
<p>The police reached out to more than 5,000 people who were consulted by the covid-19 positive doctor at Bangar Hospital. The officials also screened patients of in-patient department (IPD) and out patient department (OPD). Nearly 6,000 people were identified and put under isolation in just two days to break the chain of contamination.</p>
<p>“We worked simultaneously on precaution and treatment. Both were done together to control the outbreak. We are regularly tracking the patients even after we release them. Lockdown has played a major role in breaking the chain,&rdquo; Dr Mushtaq Khan, Chief Medical and Health Officer (CMHO) said.</p>
<p>The administration has acquired 42 hospitals with dedicated beds for positive patients, 1,551-bed quarantine facilities readied at hotels and other such establishments. Besides, places have been identified where, if needed, an infrastructure of 10,000-15,000 beds can be instantly set up.</p>
<p>Confirming that the state has extended the lockdown for some more days, Bhilwara district magistrate Rajendra Bhatt said people will get all essential items and everything they need at their doorstep.</p>
<p>“No shop, dairy or medical store will be open. If people want something, they will directly call us, whether it is medicine, food or anything else. For this, at least 4-5 control rooms of several departments are being operated and we are fulfilling demands. It is a necessary step to control the outbreak and bring out a total covid-19-free Bhilwara in the coming days,&rdquo; said Bhatt, adding that screening of people will continue till the cases come to zero.</p>
<p>Bhatt said 25-30 lakh screenings have been done in the past few days and daily reports are being sent to authorities.</p>
<p>“We sealed the city and later the whole district boundaries were strictly sealed. The population of the city has been screened at least 3 times now and people having normal cough and cold due to weather change (influenza-like illness), who were in thousands, were also checked and surveyed,&rdquo; said Bhatt, adding that those with symptoms were put under isolation or quarantine.</p>

Bhilwara model to be applied across Rajasthan: Minister</p>
<p>Jaipur, April 7 (IANS) The rise in coronavirus cases in the state would be controlled on the basis of the Bhilwara model, Rajasthan Health Minister Raghu Sharma said, here on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The state government was taking all measures to prevent the community spread of Covid-19, he added.</p>
<p>In Bhilwara, the administration applied a systematic multi-phased approach to tackle the coronavirus infection and was successful in containing its spread, said Sharma.</p>
<p>He said the Covid-19 preventive action was being taken in consultation with local representatives, senior doctors, epidemiologists and officials of various departments.</p>
<p>With this, we would be able to control the epidemic in Ramganj and other cities as well, he added.</p>
<p>However, on the Ramganj situation, the minister said the geographical conditions of the area was different. &ldquo;The population density in the walled city of Jaipur is high and maintaining social distancing is a challenge,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>On rise in Covid-19 cases in cities, like Jaipur, Jodhpur, Tonk, Jhunjhunu, Churu, Bikaner and Kota, he said officials and health workers were keeping greater vigilance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Intensive screening is being done and the health department'&lsquo;s surveillance team has surveyed over 12.5 lakh families comprising 5.37 crore people,&rdquo; the Minister said and added, the government had decided to do intensive sampling for prevention of spread of Covid-19 infection.</p>
<p>Of the 328 Covid-19 cases, 37 have turned negative from positive and 32 of them have been discharged.</p>
<p>Wishing all the healthcare workers on the World Health Day, the Minister said, &ldquo;he salutes their spirit. With their hard work, dedication and sacrifice, we have been able to keep the people safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The department would boost the facilities for health workers according to the World Health Organization theme &lsquo;&lsquo;Support Nurses and Midwives&rdquo;, the Minister said.</p>

(MENAFN - IANS)</p>
<p>Jaipur, April 7 (IANS) Bhilwara has become a global role model by breaking the corona chain with efforts made by the state government which include screening of 5 crore people and testing lakhs of households still date, said Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot.</p>
<p>He added that the first case in Rajasthan was reported on March 2, 2020 and strict measures were taken in the state on the very first day. &ldquo;We sealed the borders the day we found a doctor being corona positive in Bhilwara and it is becoming a learning ground now. 22 lakhs families from villages, nearly 10 lakh households in the city were tested and hence Bhilwara set an example against corona in India,&rdquo; said Gehlot.</p>
<p>The city has now recorded 17 recoveries with 11 discharged out of the 27 patients who reported positive. &ldquo;We are working on a war-footing in a 6-part process beginning with the imposition of curfew, coordination work of police surveying colonies where the visitors at Bangar Hospital, where it all began, might be staying,&rdquo; said Harendra Mahawar, SP, Bhilwara.</p>
<p>In India, a few hotspots of COVID-19 were listed as the epicentres of coronavirus out of which Bhilwara emerged in the list of 10 major spots. With 27 cases, the district was considered the worst hit in Rajasthan and for a few days, at the national level too.</p>
<p>Mahawar added that more than 5,000 people were listed who consulted the COVID-19 positive doctor of Bangar Hospital. Patients of IPD and OPD were also screened.</p>
<p>To break the chain of contamination, nearly 6,000 people were identified and put under isolation in only 2 days. Patients from almost 19 districts and 4 states were in the hospital when a sudden rise of positive patients was reported. Every single individual was put in strict isolation and a curfew was imposed within 15 minutes without affecting the supply of food &amp; other essentials. CLG members, community leaders, and religious gurus were asked to motivate the public to stay home.</p>
<p>The Rajasthan CM said that things were controlled with the imposition of curfew and today, 34 places are under curfew in Rajasthan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two km area of a person found COVID-19 positive is sealed and checks are done. Today, out of total number of positives in Rajasthan, nearly 30-32 are the evacuees from Iran at Jaisalmer &amp; Jodhpur. People with travel history or any contact with positive patients are being isolated and checked. The only worry is of people who are coming out positive and have no history of either travel or contact,&rdquo; Gehlot added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Officials of the Central government are in touch with Chief Secretary DB Gupta and they mention Bhilwara in their video conferencing,&rdquo; he said</p>

<p>Rajendra Bhatt, District Magistrate, Bhilwara said, &ldquo;We have deployed corona fighters in villages who are led by the corona captain, the SDM. They submit daily reports on the screenings in rural areas and if there is any sign of community spread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have extended a total shutdown for a few more days and people will get everything they need at their doorstep. No shop, dairy, medical store will be open.
