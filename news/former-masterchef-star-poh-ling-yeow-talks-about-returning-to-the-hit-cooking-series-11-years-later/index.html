Poh Ling Yeow has spoken about returning to MasterChef 11 years after she first appeared on the hit Channel 10 cooking series.</p>
<p>In an interview with The Project on Monday, the 47-year-old chef and artist revealed she &lsquo;forgot how horrible it was&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It definitely was not like riding a bike. That first episode&hellip; we walk in and are just rudely greeted by Gordon [Ramsay]!&rsquo; she recounted of her return.</p>
<p>Comeback queen: Poh Ling Yeow (pictured) has spoken about returning to MasterChef 11 years after she first appeared on the hit Channel 10 cooking series</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is not the first thing you want to see the first time you come back into the kitchen after 10 years.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, it was really hard. I forgot how horrible it was to run around and get your equipment. That&rsquo;s the thing - it&rsquo;s so stressful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Poh admitted it wasn&rsquo;t all bad, and said she wanted to return because of &lsquo;that feeling&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Bringing back memories: In an interview with The Project on Monday, the 47-year-old chef and artist revealed she &lsquo;forgot how horrible it was&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s just this magical sort of electricity that comes from you getting thrown into something where you feel so utterly petrified, and at the end of it, you manage to pull something out of your bum!&rsquo; she added.</p>
<p>After being told she was the early favourite to win this year&rsquo;s series by an impressed Gordon, 53, Poh said it was &lsquo;really flattering&rsquo; but also &lsquo;very embarrassing&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And she confessed that although she&rsquo;d been through the experience previously, she was no wiser coming back into the competition.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was really hard. I forgot how horrible it was to run around and get your equipment. That&rsquo;s the thing - it&rsquo;s so stressful,&rsquo; she confessed. Pictured when she first appeared on the show in 2009</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing&rsquo;s changed. I really thought that 10 years of experience was going to make me calmer and more methodical, but I am just as chaotic and nutty in there!&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>She added: &lsquo;If not more, because I&rsquo;m older and more forgetful, and I actually think I should get a little bit of a handicap, you know?!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Poh first appeared on MasterChef back in 2009, and came runner-up behind Julie Goodwin, before appearing as a mentor on last year&rsquo;s season.

<h3 id="much-less-self-conscious-poh-still-has-burning-masterchef-ambition">&lsquo;Much less self-conscious&rsquo;: Poh still has burning MasterChef ambition</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8748514164793553%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_296%2C$y_194/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/6876fe3bb41f11bcea1b06ba56aec29958e66aed" alt="img">
Media personality, cookbook author, visual artist, professional cook – and famous enough to require only the singular moniker – you wouldn’t think Poh has much left to achieve, let alone prove. But, after coming second in season one, one of the things she has not yet done is actually win MasterChef. And it turns out that – behind the huge smile and the giggle – she’s highly competitive.</p>
<p>Loading</p>
<p>“I think it comes from being a migrant, actually.” (Poh is Malaysian-born Chinese, migrating to South Australia when she was nine.) “I always felt like I didn’t fit in. As a child, I had shocking image problems. I hated the way I looked. I was terrible at sport.” But nor was she content to simply disappear into the background. She wouldn’t say she was devious, exactly: “But I did have to be industrious in how I got attention,” she says with a laugh. Usually, that was with creativity. “So even though I wasn’t paying attention in class and I hated geography I knew the teacher liked pretty pictures, so I would draw maps. I had no idea what was in those maps, but they looked great! I had to make good with what I had.”</p>
<p>Now she’s drawing on those same skills. “Whenever I’m in a challenge I’ll always think of ways to stand out that are a little bit different. I don’t always cook the best meal. Instead I’m thinking: how can I introduce a more interesting process or technique?”</p>
<p>In that respect Poh epitomises the success of MasterChef Australia itself. No version of the franchise has quite reached the heights of the Australian one. And Poh believes that’s precisely because the local edition is as much about creativity and rule breaking as it is perfection.

<h3 id="youre-the-favourite-gordon-ramsay-crowns-his-masterchef-winner-on-day-one">&lsquo;You&rsquo;re the favourite&rsquo;: Gordon Ramsay crowns his MasterChef winner on day one</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.newidea.com.au/media/86577/gordon-preview.jpg" alt="img">
&lsquo;No, I am gonna tell you. I&rsquo;m gonna tell you straight,&rsquo; he said confidently.</p>
<p>Commenting to viewers, Poh admitted: &lsquo;A lot is going on right now. Gordon Ramsay&rsquo;s in front of me telling me I&rsquo;m the crowd favourite, and I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;No! What? I don&rsquo;t need this extra pressure!&quot;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Gordon told her, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got to get your hands on that trophy. Poh. No pressure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Poh laughed and told him to, &lsquo;Go away, now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Gordon laughed as he moved to the next contestant, &lsquo;Head down and get a grip, girl!&rsquo;
