<p>Who is Rochelle Humes?</p>
<p>Rochelle is a 31-year-old singer and television presenter, originally from Barking, England.</p>
<p>Born Rochelle Wiseman, she has been married to JLS singer Marvin Humes since 2012.</p>
<p>She started her pop career in the S Club 7 spin-off group, S Club Juniors in 2001.</p>
<p>The multi-talented star then went on to forge a successful pop career with girl group The Saturdays.</p>
<p>Her parents divorced when she was three-years-old and she was raised by her mother and her uncle, English football manager Paul Ince.</p>
<p>The star has two sisters who share an uncanny resemblance to her.</p>

<p>How many children does Rochelle Humes have?</p>
<p>Rochelle has revealed she is expecting her third child with husband Marvin.</p>
<p>The TV star posted the news on her Instagram over the Easter weekend, telling followers: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a baby bunny in my oven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rochelle shared a photo of their ultrasound scan alongside a pair of knitted boots and a board that read: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re eggspecting. Baby Humes. October 2020.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The couple already have two daughters, Alaia-Mai (born May 20, 2013) and Valentina Raine (born March 10, 2017).</p>
<p>After the birth of Valentina, Rochelle announced that she would be trying the latest health fad of eating her placenta in pill form.</p>
<p>She also had the umbilical cord shaped into the word &ldquo;love&rdquo; and framed.</p>
<p>Rochelle posted the first ever photos of her daughters on Instagram in January 2020, delighting fans with the first snaps of her children&rsquo;s faces.</p>
<p>Opening up about her decision to share photos after six years of strict privacy, Rochelle wrote: &ldquo;Our girls. I think it would be weird for me to post this without saying anything&hellip; But we’ve made the choice to share a little bit more of our family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alaia is aware of social media now (gulp) and she often asks why her cousins and other family are featured but not her and to be honest, we don’t really have the answer&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Who&rsquo;s her husband Marvin Humes?</p>
<p>Rochelle and Marvin began dating in March 2010 and moved in together three months later.</p>
<p>Former JLS singer Marvin, 35, proposed to Rochelle on the Caribbean island of Antigua on New Year&rsquo;s Eve in 2011.</p>
<p>The couple then married in a lavish ceremony at Blenheim Palace in 2012.</p>
<p>Marvin rose to fame with boyband JLS alongside bandmates Aston Merrygold, Oritsé Williams, and JB Gill.</p>
<p>JLS auditioned for The X Factor in 2008 and eventually lost out to Alexandra Burke in the final.</p>
<p>The band went on to have a string of hit singles including Beat Again and Everybody in Love.</p>
<p>The group split in 2013 and then Marvin launched his presenting career including hosting BBC One&rsquo;s The Voice UK with Emma Willis between 2014 and 2016.</p>

<p>Who are her sisters Sophie and Lili ?</p>
<p>The television presenter is known for sharing stunning snaps of herself and her lookalike sisters, Sophie and Lili Piper, on her social media accounts.</p>
<p>But very few know she was reunited with her long lost you younger sister, Lili, 24, after 23 years by Love Island 2017 winner Kem Cetinay.</p>
<p>Speaking on the Happy Mum Happy Baby podcast, she revealed: &ldquo;Two years ago, I was at our management’s Christmas Party and Love Island’s Kem was there.</p>
<p>“He was chatting away and said, ‘I got to talk to you… as soon as I became a celeb I promised my friend Lili that I would talk to you as she’s your sister from your dad&rsquo;s side.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since meeting up the pair have been inseparable, with Lili even joining Rochelle on her family holiday.</p>

<p>Rochelle&rsquo;s other half sister medical PA Sophie Piper from Essex, 21, starred on Love Island in January 2020, searching for her perfect man.</p>
<p>The Love Island star was apparently in talks to be on the 2019 series, but plans for her to head into the villa didn&rsquo;t work out.</p>
<p>Rochelle and Sophie also share half- brother Jake Piper, 23, from their father.</p>

<p>What happened to The Saturdays?</p>
<p>Rochelle joined S Club 8 when she was just 12.</p>
<p>She later formed a new group with her old bandmate Frankie Bridge and became The Saturdays.</p>
<p>Created in 2007, they released their debut single If This Is Love a year later.</p>
<p>The other girls that made up the group were Una Healy, Mollie King and Vanessa White.</p>
<p>Over the course of the next seven years, The Saturdays had 13 top 10 singles - including Missing You, Ego, Higher, Notorious, Issues and All Fired Up.</p>
<p>Their debut album Chasing Lights reached platinum status and they hit the top of the charts with What About Us, a collaboration with Sean Paul.</p>
<p>The band went on a hiatus in 2014, and despite Frankie saying the group would reform by 2016, a reunion looks unlikely now.</p>
<p>Band member Vanessa White has quit the band forever and both Una Healy and Mollie King are seeking solo pop career success.</p>
<p>Rochelle revealed that while she was a member of The Saturdays she was ordered to lose weight by one of their management team.</p>

<p>What TV shows does Rochelle Humes present?</p>
<p>After The Saturdays announced their hiatus in 2014, Rochelle went on to forge a successful TV career.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s since scored high-profile prime-time ITV gigs including Ninja Warrior UK, a brief stint on The Xtra Factor and The Next Great Magician.</p>
