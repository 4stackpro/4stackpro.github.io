Unfortunately for some shareholders, the Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd (KLSE:DAYANG) share price has dived 47% in the last thirty days. Zooming out, the recent drop wiped out a year’s worth of gains, with the share price now back where it was a year ago.

All else being equal, a share price drop should make a stock more attractive to potential investors. In the long term, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, but in the short term prices bounce around in response to short term factors (which are not always obvious). The implication here is that long term investors have an opportunity when expectations of a company are too low. Perhaps the simplest way to get a read on investors’ expectations of a business is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E implies that investors have high expectations of what a company can achieve compared to a company with a low P/E ratio.

View our latest analysis for Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd

Does Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd Have A Relatively High Or Low P/E For Its Industry?

Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd’s P/E of 6.23 indicates relatively low sentiment towards the stock. We can see in the image below that the average P/E (15.3) for companies in the energy services industry is higher than Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd’s P/E.

Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd’s P/E tells us that market participants think it will not fare as well as its peers in the same industry. While current expectations are low, the stock could be undervalued if the situation is better than the market assumes. You should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.

How Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios

Probably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. Earnings growth means that in the future the ‘E’ will be higher. That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.

Notably, Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd grew EPS by a whopping 47% in the last year. And earnings per share have improved by 2.5% annually, over the last five years. With that performance, I would expect it to have an above average P/E ratio.

Don’t Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank Deposits

It’s important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. So it won’t reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.

Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.

Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd’s Balance Sheet

Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd has net debt worth 24% of its market capitalization. This could bring some additional risk, and reduce the number of investment options for management; worth remembering if you compare its P/E to businesses without debt.

The Bottom Line On Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd’s P/E Ratio

Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd trades on a P/E ratio of 6.2, which is below the MY market average of 14.1. The company hasn’t stretched its balance sheet, and earnings growth was good last year. If it continues to grow, then the current low P/E may prove to be unjustified. Given Dayang Enterprise Holdings Bhd’s P/E ratio has declined from 11.7 to 6.2 in the last month, we know for sure that the market is more worried about the business today, than it was back then. For those who prefer to invest with the flow of momentum, that might be a bad sign, but for deep value investors this stock might justify some research.

Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. If the reality for a company is not as bad as the P/E ratio indicates, then the share price should increase as the market realizes this. So this free visualization of the analyst consensus on future earnings could help you make the right decision about whether to buy, sell, or hold.
