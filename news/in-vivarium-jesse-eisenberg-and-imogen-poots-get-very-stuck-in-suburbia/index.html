Gemma (Imogen Poots) and Tom (Jesse Eisenberg) are pretty ordinary. She’s a cheerful kindergarten teacher; he’s a genial gardener. They want to buy a starter home, somewhere to live peacefully, maybe start a family.</p>
<p>So they do what any reasonable young couple would do: They talk to a real estate agent. The agent is odd and creepy but promises he has the perfect place for them. Soon, they’re living in a newly built suburban community, full of rows of simple houses built to starter-home specifications: picket fence, a yard in the front and back, cheerful but soulless.</p>
<p>Before long, something very strange occurs, as they suddenly discover they can’t get away. They seem to be alone in their new neighborhood, filled with look-alike, rubber-stamp homes. And then one day a baby shows up in a box.</p>
<p>Rating: 3.5 out of 5 vox-mark vox-mark vox-mark vox-mark vox-mark</p>
<p>Eerie and surprising, Vivarium takes a common cinematic theme — “the suburbs will eat your soul” — and turns it into high-concept horror, anchored by great performances from Eisenberg and Poots. Director Lorcan Finnegan brings a stylized sensibility to Garret Shanley’s screenplay, which gleefully injects surreality into Tom and Gemma’s new life. Time moves at a confusing pace. Their child doesn’t act like a child. The clouds look so perfect that they’re unnerving. Nothing changes, and everything changes.</p>
<p>The film’s title refers to a particular kind of enclosed natural space in which creatures are kept under observation, allowed to live their lives but without the same kind of freedom they might have in the wild. (A terrarium is a type of vivarium; an aquarium is as well.) It’s where an animal’s natural habitat is simulated but not allowed to flourish untended — an experiment of sorts.</p>
<p>Tom and Gemma’s new house is painted green; each room inside is a different jewel tone in shades of green, blue, and brown that recall natural settings. (There’s a painting hanging on one wall, and it’s of the house itself.) It’s almost as if they’re contained in a terrarium of their own. So that, coupled with the title, is a clue to Vivarium’s familiar judgment, albeit done with a spin: that polite, middle-class, suburban society, with all its accoutrements, is a trap. Not because things like houses, children, and routine are themselves a trap, but because the demands they make can drown out things like individuality and a flourishing existence.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more beneath the Twilight Zone-like surface of Vivarium, if you scratch at it, from ideas about malevolent forces keeping us in a social experiment to some funny but chilling acknowledgement that children, sponge-like, grow up to be like their parents. But though it verges on the overstuffed at times, Vivarium is dirty, sinister, hair-raising, and thoroughly entertaining — and completely worth a watch if you’re feeling a little, well, trapped.</p>
<p>How to watch it: Vivarium is available to digitally rent or purchase on iTunes, YouTube, Amazon, Vudu, and Google Play.

<h3 id="vivarium--resistance-reviews-binge-jesse-eisenberg-on-vod-in-creepy-sci-fi-flick-and-powerful-true-story-of-world-war-ii">‘Vivarium’ &amp; ‘Resistance’ Reviews: Binge Jesse Eisenberg On VOD In Creepy Sci-Fi Flick And Powerful True Story Of World War II</h3>
<p><img src="https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/vivarium-and-resistance-review.jpg?w=1024" alt="img">
Jesse Eisenberg was Oscar nominated for his performance as Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network, so maybe it’s appropriate that he has a year’s worth of feature film work debuting on the same day that you can access right through the Internet. It is highly unusual for an actor to see two new movies opening against each other, but that is exactly what is happening for Eisenberg in these unprecedented times as the weird and eerie sci-fi/horror mash-up Vivarium, and Resistance, an inspiring story of a rescue of thousands of orphans from the clutches of Nazi Germany in the late 1930s, are available for home viewing through various platforms beginning Friday. So are they worth the price to watch at home? Here’s my take.</p>
<p>Deadline</p>
<p>I saw Vivarium in May during Critics’ Week at the Cannes Film Festival. The description of the film, about a young couple who get sucked into a nightmarish suburban neighborhood from which there is no escape, was intriguing enough for me to make the long walk to the Miramar screening room and brave the lines to check it out (it also had the distinction of being the only English-language film chosen for that particular Cannes sidebar). What I discovered was a bit disappointing, essentially a fairly one-dimensional story that would be a lot better (and shorter) if it was an episode of The Twilight Zone, which probably is where this idea belongs rather than stretched out to a 97-minute feature length.</p>
<p>Lorcan Finnegan who cooked up the story with its screenwriter Garret Shanley, directs this odd tale of unmarried couple Tom (Eisenberg) and Gemma (Imogen Poots) who want to find a house to move into and stumble upon a very strange real estate agent named Martin (Jonathan Aris). He shows them a home, simply identified as #9, in a pea soup green neighborhood with rows of identical houses but no sign of life anywhere around them. Realizing it is not for them, they set to leave but discover Martin has just disappeared.</p>
<p>‘Vivarium’: First Look At Sci-Fi Pic With Jesse Eisenberg &amp; Imogen Poots</p>
<p>An attempt to drive out of there ends in frustration as they just go around in circles, always landing right back in front of #9. Eventually a box with food and household items appears, and then another with a baby in it. For Tom and Gemma, this is all turning into some Kafkaesque nightmare from which there is no escape. Time passes, the baby is now 10 and looks like an identical offspring of Martin, and just as bonkers creepy. He makes the kid in The Omen look like a Boy Scout by comparison. Stuff happens. Eisenberg, and the always-welcome presence of Poots do their best to keep straight faces throughout this thing, but much of it defies credibility — which I suppose makes sense in some way.</p>
<p>‘Vivarium’ XYZ Films</p>
<p>Vivarium is clearly trying to say important things about the way we succumb to conformity in the deadening age in which we live, and taken on that level there is a little food for thought here. The production design is abstract and just right for the film which was obviously made on a low budget, and Finnegan knows how to build atmosphere so fans of this kind of thing may want to visit, but others I am afraid will just be scratching their heads.</p>
<p>The other Eisenberg entry this week is more worthwhile, if at times unflinchingly hard to watch. Resistance is a true story, largely unknown even to those in France where it takes place, and stars Eisenberg as none other than a young Marcel Marceau. That is right, Marcel Marceau, perhaps the most famous mime who ever lived. But this is not about his later life in show business but rather the heroic things he did in 1938 and ’39, when he helped lead 10,000 orphans to safety from invading Nazis during the French resistance.</p>
<p>It is an inspiring and powerful if at times harrowing tale of how Marcel (then known by his birth name Marcel Mangel) pulled off this feat with the help of a group of others in the Jewish Boy Scouts, forced to outwit the Nazi officers and one in particular — the evil Klaus Barbie (played with horrifying intensity by Matthias Schweighofer) — who was determined to stop the exodus. One pulse-pounding scene finds Barbie confronting Marcel and suggesting his big fake moustache was meant to parody Hitler, but instead is convinced that it is all part of his Charlie Chaplin impression in order to entertain the children.</p>
<p>‘Resistance’ IFC Films</p>
<p>Resistance, effectively written and directed by Jonathan Jakubowicz, not only follows Marcel but other characters caught up in the resistance efforts, with an excellent ensemble cast including Edgar Ramirez, Geza Rohrig, Bella Ramsey and Clemence Posey, the latter as Emma and serving as a bit of a romantic interest for the young man. A sequence near the beginning of the film in which the cold-blooded nature of the enemy is shown in no uncertain terms, as well as Barbie’s scenes of torture and murder in an empty swimming pool at the Hotel Terminus, are presented in chilling fashion, so be warned. But for the most part this is a story of the courage of a person we later would come to know in a much different light after the war, a little-known aspect of the man who entertained so many without uttering a single word.</p>
<p>Eisenberg is very convincing, even naturally resembling Marceau, and also acquits himself convincingly in scenes where his mime talents are showcased. Opening and closing scenes that bookend the film feature Ed Harris in a cameo as General George S. Patton addressing his troops to praise the wartime heroism of “a man named Marcel.” The ending is very moving, and this is one of Eisenberg’s finest performances.</p>
<p>Saban Films is releasing Vivarium in all U.S. media. IFC Films has Resistance. Check out my video review of both films above with scenes from each.</p>

<h3 id="vivarium-review-jesse-eisenberg-and-imogen-poots-star-in-a-creepy-suburban-brain-bender">‘Vivarium’ Review: Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots Star in a Creepy Suburban Brain Bender</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/vivarium.jpg" alt="img">
A superb Poots carries this sometimes shaky, but never boring, &ldquo;Twilight Zone&rdquo;-like thriller, which seems readymade for the age of self-isolation.</p>
<p>With a nifty premise torn out of “The Twilight Zone” and a superb performance from Imogen Poots, “Vivarium” offers either the sort of horrifying distraction you might need right now, or a shattering window into the darkest parts of yourself you just don’t care to see. In the tradition of the best “Twilight Zone” episodes, how you interpret this clever little B-movie is up to you, and that’s both the fun and the frustration of “Vivarium.”</p>
<p>Gemma (Imogen Poots) and Tom (Jesse Eisenberg, menacing as he comes undone) are a young couple looking to settle down in a new home, but not exactly looking to have children. After a fruitless search to find that perfect place, they meet up with an instantly creepy real-estate salesman, Martin (Jonathan Aris), an automaton straight out of “The Stepford Wives,” to Yonder, a housing tract where all the identical, pale-green starter homes and their white picket fences look copy and pasted on a seemingly endless horizon of astroturf.</p>
<p>Martin leads Gemma and Tom to their new home-to-be in Yonder, “Number 9,” an arbitrary designation given that every other prefabricated house flanking it looks exactly the same, filled with furniture more soulless than the showrooms of IKEA or CB2. (Cinematographer MacGregor and production designer Philip Murphy conjure a candy-colored dreamland from hell.) Gemma and Tom are immediately onto Martin’s creepy wavelength, but go along with what they believe to be a sick joke. “This house is forever,” Martin tells them, an adage stretched to terrifying dimensions once he vanishes, leaving Gemma and Tom alone, and stunned, with no escape from Yonder. Hours of driving in circles yield no way out of an Escherian suburban nightmare that appears to defy the parameters of space and time.</p>

<p>Isolated and seemingly alone in their new eternity, Tom and Gemma are now two characters in search of an exit where there is no exit. To get the attention of whoever put them there, or maybe whoever could save them, they burn Number 9 to the ground, only to find, upon waking soot-covered curbside the next morning, that it’s been completely restored, and they’ve been left with a box of vacuum-sealed food. And there’s another box: inside it, a baby, with a foreboding caveat courtesy of Yonder: “Raise the child and be released.”</p>
<p>Popular on IndieWire</p>
<p>As days bleed into months, that child grows up in a blink into a precocious adolescent boy, but he’s no kid, if he’s even human. His throaty, genderless voice oscillates between parroting Martin’s high-pitched speech, and the voices of Tom and Gemma in their manic panic. It’s unsettling stuff. When the kid isn’t screeching bloody murder demanding his corn flakes, he’s glued to the tube, watching disturbing, black-and-white fractal simulations play out on the screen: never-ending patterns of sameness that echo the dire, endlessly repeating prison of Yonder. An increasingly frittered Tom, now at rock bottom, seems to believe the only way out is through the ground, and he toils away his days smoking halved cigarettes while Gemma begins to tacitly accept her new role as “mother.” To say anything about what happens next would suck the grim power out of “Vivarium,” which has plenty of scary, grand guignol tricks up its sleeve in the final act.</p>
<p>Saban Films/screenshot</p>
<p>Still, the movie suffers from the malady of many classy new horror films, from the single-location chiller “The Lodge” to the upcoming satanic panic horror “Saint Maud”: A fascinating premise starts to sputter as the movie runs out of juice, even if the search for new ideas is compelling to watch from the start. What is the overarching metaphor here? One of a government leaving its citizens for dead to fend for themselves, or another of the death sentence of dreary suburban life?</p>
<p>Neither is subtle, or an astonishing new wrinkle. But director Lorcan Finnegan’s film still delivers stylish thrills on its own terms, especially in a late sequence (even as the film starts running on empty in the conceptual ideas department) that plunges Gemma down a “Being John Malkovich”-like rabbit hole of alternate, yet concurrent, realities — brain-bending windows into what life for their Yonder neighbors might look like. And it isn’t pretty.</p>
<p>Poots has been shouldering many standout indie films for the past decade, sneaking in unexpected work in “Green Room,” “Knight of Cups,” and “The Art of Self Defense,” recently in the holiday horror remake “Black Christmas” and in a National Theatre Live performance of “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” as the dotty and bemused Honey. Poots is neither of those things in “Vivarium,” a showcase for her muscular acting gifts as a woman taking charge in a situation of peril. It’s fascinating to see Poots’ modulations as Gemma is at first petrified in disbelief at, then at the threshold of brainwashed by, her conundrum. Her final come-to as she confronts the reality of awful events makes Poots ideal Final Girl material. “I’m not your fucking mother” is the most badass kiss-off line in any recent horror movie.</p>
<p>But this is 2020, so of course Finnegan and his writer Garret Shanley (with whom he also developed the story) can’t help but slap the film with the most hopeless ending this side of “The Vanishing,” but it doesn’t feel unearned. Instead, you’re reminded of the all-time “Twilight Zone” chillers that left you pondering and unsettled in your living room, questioning how well you knew the people sitting next to you. Given the current state of things, you’ll have to experience “Vivarium” in much the same way.</p>
<p>Grade: B</p>
<p>“Vivarium” is available on VOD and digital beginning Friday, March 27.</p>
