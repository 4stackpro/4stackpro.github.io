The clip opens with Narduwar explaining how Pharrell helped him land the interview, a point Hov was quick to bring up when the two finally met. “Pharrell was calling [me] a hundred times,” he told Nardwuar. “He said your knowledge is extensive and he knows I appreciate people no matter what you do&hellip;if you good at your craft, he knows I’m excited by that type of s**t. He wanted me to meet you so here we are.”</p>
<p>A hip-hop fan account on Twitter uploaded a throwback clip on Thursday (April 23) from an interview Jay-Z did with Nardwuar back in 2009 at the Pemberton Music Festival in British Columbia, Canada.</p>
<p>To start the interview off, Nardwuar asked Hov to introduce himself to his audience. “Who are you?” he posed.</p>
<p>“I’m a young man from [the] Marcy projects who really made that thing that they say [is] the American Dream come true,” Hov said, philosophically. “I’m not supposed to be here speaking to you, you know? There’s a lot of people that come from where I come. There’s a lot of skilled people who come from where I come who are not here right now.”</p>
<p>“You are Jay-Z,” Nardwuar supplied in response, which threw Hov off.</p>
<p>“Oh, I thought you meant who am I. I thought it was a deeper question. My name is Jay-Z, yes,” a confused Hov said, with an awkward chuckle.</p>
<p>“Jay-Z thought Nardwuar was trying to be deep,” the Twitter user captioned the clip with a crying emoji.

<h3 id="lil-cease-says-biggie-thought-jay-z-was-a-better-mc">Lil Cease Says Biggie Thought JAY-Z Was A Better MC</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.hiphopdx.com/2020/04/200425-Biggie-827x620.jpg" alt="img">
Smoke DZA chopped it up with Lil Cease during a recent Instagram Live session where, naturally, the subject of The Notorious B.I.G. came up. At one point, they started talking about JAY-Z and Biggie’s relationship with the billionaire Hip Hop mogul.</p>
<p>Cease, who was a member of Junior M.A.F.I.A. and Biggie’s cousin revealed Biggie always thought Hov was the superior MC.</p>
<p>“Once Big met him at the Palladium, and they bonded on some g-shit ’cause they respected each other as men and they respected each other as artists,” Cease said. “Big wasn’t afraid to tell him … Big thought [JAY-Z] was doper than him. Big used to say, ‘Yo, that nigga nicer than me.’</p>
<p>“These are straight facts. When JAY-Z said that line on ‘Dead Presidents,’ ‘Niggas take a freeze off my kneecap, niggas believe that?’ Big was like, ‘Yo, he got me.'”</p>
<p>Cease thought Biggie was “buggin&rsquo;” though and explained he found Big’s content more relatable.</p>
<p>“I adapted to Big’s shit because it was more my lane,” he continued. “Jay was digging in the books saying some other shit. I had to go get a dictionary like, ‘The fuck is he talkin’ bout?’ You know what I’m saying? We wasn’t tappin’ into it ’cause we was some young, bad ass kids. But I adapted to Big ’cause I feel like Big was just more direct.”</p>

<h3 id="kanye-west-joins-billionaire-club-tout-riches-greater-than-jay-z-diddy--dr-dre">Kanye West Joins Billionaire Club, Tout Riches Greater Than JAY-Z, Diddy &amp; Dr. Dre</h3>
<p><img src="https://urbanislandz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kanye-West-435.jpg" alt="img">
Kanye West says he is a billionaire three times over, and Forbes better put some respect on his name.</p>
<p>Kanye West has been making great music for decades now. When he is not in the booth spitting his own rhymes, he is behind the soundboard making someone else’s work come to life. The prolific musician has long been lauded as one of the top rappers in the history of the music, and when he tried his hand in fashion, he quickly dominated that industry as well.</p>
<p>With all Kanye’s successes across industries, it wasn’t all too surprising when the rapper made a recent statement about his net worth reaching the big ‘B’ like his longtime friend Jay-Z. Kanye was not pleased with Forbes, the popular magazine known to calculate celebrities’ net worth when they published their recent list of billionaires in March. The Yeezy sneaker brand owner was left off of the list that included the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, who ‘Ye once asked for a billion dollars due to personal debt, his longtime friend JAY-Z, his favorite president, Donald Trump and his sister-in-law, Kylie Jenner.</p>
<p>‘Ye reportedly sent in some documents to Forbes that same day to verify that he was, in fact, a billionaire. According to Forbes, Kanye is worth close to $1.3 billion. As to why he was left off the issue, let’s just say the rapper believes someone at Forbes is slipping on the arithmetic. As a matter of fact, Kanye still did not agree with the numbers even after Forbes confirmed his billionaire status. “It’s not a billion,” West reportedly texted Forbes. “It’s $3.3 billion since no one at Forbes knows how to count.”</p>
<p>Prior to the global pandemic that we’re all currently facing, Kanye’s Yeezy brand was worth a whopping $3 billion, according to Bank of America Corp., so maybe he is not just reaching as Forbes suggests. Regardless of the numbers, at least they can both agree on one thing – Kanye West is a billionaire.
