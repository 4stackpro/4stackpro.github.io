bollywood</p>
<p>Updated: Jun 16, 2020 02:57 IST</p>
<p>2020’s first half can surely be termed ‘highly disappointing’ on all counts, and movie business, too, is no different. Going by numbers, the industry’s overall net collections [in the first half] has been around Rs 780 crore with films such as Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior (almost Rs 280 crore), Baaghi 3 (Rs 97 crore), Shubh Mangal Zyaada Saavdhan (close to Rs 63 crore) and Malang (Rs 60 crore).</p>
<p>In comparison, 2019’s first half saw Bollywood make a whopping Rs 2,400 crore, buoyed by hits like Uri: The Surgical Strike, Bharat, Gully Boy, Kabir Singh, Kesari, Total Dhamaal, De De Pyaar De, Kabir Singh. Apparently, last year, the overall box office collections [in the first half] witnessed a 10-12 per cent growth as compared to 2018 when the figures were around Rs 2,200 crore.</p>
<p>“It has been nothing less than a disaster. Movie business did extremely well in 2018 as well as 2019, and so, the expectations were of a fantastic first half. But everyone knows what has transpired,” says trade analyst Taran Adarsh, adding: “Also, don’t forget that in the process, we have lost out on a lucrative summer vacations period due to the pandemic, so the film business is in real doldrums.”</p>
<p>Except one or two successes, the first half of the year saw some big disappointments such as Street Dancer 3D, Love Aaj Kal and Chhapaak. “Except for Tanhaji and the above-average Baaghi 3, nothing did well in the first quarter [of 2020] as well. I feel the business in that period also could have been a little better,” says trade expert Komal Nahta, who puts the total losses for the industry in the last two-and-a-half to three months [including the exhibition sector] at Rs 3,000 crore.</p>
<p>Interestingly, last year’s first half also saw Hollywood hits such as Avengers Endgame (Rs 373 crore) and Captain Marvel (Rs 85 crore). “It would be unfair to look at the ‘first half’ of the year because the second quarter doesn’t even exist because the theatres have been shut. But it’s been extremely bad. Thankfully, however, things are getting back to normal and people would want to go out and experience movies too,” says exhibitor-distributor Akshaye Rathi.</p>
<p>Although talks suggest that the movie theatre sector may get permissions to re-open around mid-July, experts raise a “fundamental” point. “What will theatres run when government gives them green signal? Almost 12-14 films, including the ones that have already been announced, would have gone to the OTT platforms. So, where will the new content come from at that point?” says Nahta. But Rathi remains confident. “Mark my words, the exhibition sector will rise like a tsunami.”</p>
<p>Nolan moves ahead!</p>
<p>With his much-talked-about biggie, Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s date with the box office has moved to July 31, from July 17. But experts and exhibitors continue to be gung-ho about the Hollywood master’s next offering, saying such a film “could be the correct kind of product that can attract people back to theatres in a big way.” As Rathi puts it: “Whenever we reopen, we really need quality, big-screen films such as Tenet from Hollywood, and Sooryvanshi/’83 from Bollywood to get people back in theatres. There has to be some magnetic appeal in them.”

<h3 id="netflix-and-chill-makers-of-janhvi-kapoors-gunjan-saxena-may-recover-rs-10-crore-from-ott-deal">&ldquo;Netflix and chill: Makers of Janhvi Kapoor’s Gunjan Saxena may recover Rs 10 crore from OTT deal&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2020/06/gunjan-saxena-770x433.jpg" alt="img">
The three-month long closure of theatres due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown has resulted in many films skipping theatrical release and going straight to digital platforms. But is taking the direct OTT route viable?</p>
<p>It may be so for Janhvi Kapoor’s Gunjan Saxena - The Kargil Girl, which is the newest addition in the list of films that have taken the direct OTT route.</p>
<p>According to film trade analyst, Komal Nahta, Netflix has bought the premiere rights of the film for Rs 50 crore.</p>
<p>He added that Gunjan Saxena The Kargil Girl has been made at a budget of around Rs 40 crore. This means that makers of the film will get a Rs 10 crore profit.</p>
<p>Mark-up of more than Rs 10 crore for Gunjan Saxena</p>
<p>Along with the streaming rights, Zee Studios and Dharma Productions for their film have garnered Rs 9-10 crore from sale of audio and satellite rights, said Nahta.</p>
<p>The satellite right is with Zee, sister company of Zee Studios.</p>
<p>Now, if we add up revenue of rights for digital premiere, audio and satellite, Zee Studios and Dharma will earn a mark-up of Rs 19-20 crore, explained Nahta.</p>
<p>Digital premieres cap the amount of collection a movie makes</p>
<p>While going the digital way has been a profit-making deal for the makers of Gunjan Saxena, especially with theatres showing no signs of opening, a theatrical release would have meant more profits.</p>
<p>The fact that digital is an added revenue source for movies explains that for any film box office business is the primary and the biggest way to earn money.</p>
<p>In an earlier interview, Karan Taurani, Vice President, Elara Capital had said, “Many OTT’s don’t end up paying a mark-up of anything more than 20-25 percent to a producer which caps his income.”</p>
<p>Plus, small and medium-sized films have also scored a century or two at the box office.</p>
<p>Take the example of movies like Uri: The Surgical Strike and Kabir Singh. “These films could have never surpassed Rs 250 crore collection had they not released in cinemas,” Taurani had added.</p>
<p>While Uri was made at a budget of Rs 44 crore, Shahid Kapoor-starrer Kabir Singh’s budget stood at Rs 68 crore.</p>

<p>While experts say direct to digital release caps the amount of collection a movie makes even for some small and medium size movies, it has become need of the hour as holding a film for long is not viable for many producers.

<h3 id="ott-debut-of-shoojit-sarkars-gulabo-sitabo-may-script-a-new-story">&ldquo;OTT debut of Shoojit Sarkar&rsquo;s &lsquo;Gulabo Sitabo&rsquo; may script a new story&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2020-06/13/full/1591992123-4675.jpg" alt="img">
Shoojit Sarkar’s Gulabo Sitabo, which premiered on on Friday, is expected to garner far more viewers and do better financially for producers on the over-the-top (OTT) platform than in cinema halls, said trade analysts tracking the development.</p>
<p>The movie had to take the OTT route first for release rather than the conventional theatrical release due to the lockdown induced by the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.</p>
<p>Theatres are expected to open in July as part of the government’s Unlock 1.0 programme. Trade analyst Komal Nahta told Business Standard he expected more viewers to tune into Amazon Prime to watch the film, owing to the hype around its release.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: IT companies jittery over Donald Trump&rsquo;s plan to suspend H-1B visa</p>
<p>“The movie is ordinary, but it will do much better on OTT, thanks to the hype built on the social media. Also, Amazon Prime has released the film in 15 languages in 200 countries, implying it is not looking for audiences in India alone,”</p>
<p>he said.</p>
<p>Amazon Prime has 17 million subscribers in India, according to estimates. Based on monthly active users, Jio and Hotstar have a share of 35.5 per cent and 30.3 per cent, respectively. Amazon Prime has a share of 14.8 per cent.</p>
<p>KPMG has pegged the OTT market in India at over 325 million users, saying it will touch 550 million users in 2-3 years. Digital media expert Shrenik Gandhi, who is co-founder of Mumbai-based White Rivers Media, said success of the film would depend on the number of paid subscribers on Prime.</p>
<p>“Typically, some content on an OTT platform is free. The question is how many users would be willing to switch from free to paid to get access to content, such as the premiere of this film,” he said. Amazon Prime declined to share figures on the viewership of Gulabo Sitabo on the first day of its release.</p>
<p>But experts said compared to movie goers of not more than 0.6-1.2 million in cinema halls, depending on an average ticket price of Rs 50-100 per person, millions of viewers would watch Gulabo Sitabo on Prime.</p>
<p>The first movie to take the OTT route instead of a theatrical release was Nawazuddin Siddiqui’s Ghoomketu, which premiered on Zee5 on May 22.</p>
<p>It garnered over 23 per cent share of the 80 million monthly active users on the platform, a clear indication of the trend in Covid times, said experts.</p>
<p>Gulabo Sitabo, according to analysts, was made with a budget of Rs 40-45 crore and Prime bought the streaming rights for Rs 60-65 crore, helping producers make over Rs 20 crore.</p>
<p>Nahta said had the movie been released in theatres, it would not have had a domestic box-office collection of over Rs 60 crore. This means the producers would have recovered only Rs 30 crore, as 50 per cent of its collections would have to be shared with the exhibitors.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: Covid-19 relief: GST Council eases compliance for small businesses</p>
<p>That apart, producers would also have had to spend an additional Rs 10 crore in promotions. So, the total budget for the movie would have been Rs 50-55 crore, eating into profits further.</p>
<p>However, because of its deal with Amazon, the makers of Gulabo Sitabo not only make a neat upside but can also encash the lucrative satellite rights separately. But, after an OTT launch, the value the producers may get from broadcasters for a TV premiere is far lower, some experts have warned.</p>
<p>The decision of Sarkar to go to an OTT platform first, despite strong resistance from exhibitors some of whom have threatened “retributive measures”, has already led to many others joining the bandwagon, said experts.</p>
<p>According to industry sources, at least 12 to 15 other movies (apart from Shankuntala Devi starring Vidya Balan, and Tamil film Penguin) in Hindi and various regional languages are in the final stages of signing up with by the end of the month.

’गुंजन सक्सेना-द कारगिल गर्ल&rsquo; ओटीटी पर होगी रिलीज- इस शख्स ने सबसे पहले की थी यह भविष्यवाणी! News oi-Salman Khan</p>
<p>इंडस्ट्री के अंदरूनी सूत्र और शीर्ष व्यापार विश्लेषकों में से एक, कोमल नाहटा ने पहले ही अपने वीडियो में भविष्यवाणी की थी कि फिल्म &lsquo;गुंजन सक्सेना-द कारगिल गर्ल&rsquo; को जल्द ही सीधे ओटीटी पर रिलीज किया जाएगा और यह वीडियो उन्होंने 24 अप्रैल 2020 में अपने यूट्यूब चैनल पर जारी किया था। अपने अन्य वीडियो में, नाहटा ने विस्तृत आंकड़ों के साथ समझाया, क्यों निर्माता जल्द ही जान्हवी कपूर अभिनीत फिल्म के लिए डिजिटल रिलीज का विकल्प चुनने जा रहे हैं।</p>
<p>केआरके ने उड़ाया &lsquo;गुलाबो सिताबो&rsquo; का मजाक तो निर्देशक ने दिया मुंहतोड़ जवाब- वायरल हुए ट्वीट्स</p>
<p>सिनेमा हॉल फ़िलहाल फिर से खुलने की शून्य जानकारी के साथ बंद हैं और सिनेमा प्रेमियों की सुरक्षा के कारण भी सिनेमाघरों पर असर पड़ेगा, जो लॉकडाउन हट जाने के बाद भी एक महत्वपूर्ण अंतर के साथ मुनाफे में कटौती का कारण बनेगा।</p>
<p>कहना गलत नहीं होगा कि कोमल नाहटा के विशेषज्ञ ज्ञान ने हमें हमेशा इंडस्ट्री की सटीक की जानकारी प्रदान दी है। और, यह एक अन्य उदाहरण है जहां उन्होंने निश्चित रूप से हमें उन खबरों से रुबरु करवाया जो हाल ही में सुर्खियां बटोर रही थी।</p>
<p>उनका यूट्यूब चैनल सोशल मीडिया पर सबसे आकर्षक हैंडल में से एक है और युवाओं के बीच ख़ासा लोकप्रिय है। बात करें जाह्नवी कपूर की इस फिल्म की तो इसको लेकर वो काफी समय से इंतजार में थीं।</p>
<p>इस फिल्म के लिए जाह्नवी ने काफी ज्यादा मेहनत कर रही हैं। एक रियल लाइफ कैरेक्टर को जीने के लिए उन्होने लंबी तैयारी की है।
