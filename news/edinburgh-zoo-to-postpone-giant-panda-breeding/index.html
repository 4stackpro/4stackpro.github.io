Tian Tian, also known as Sweetie, is understood to have been approaching her hormonal peak, and was bulking up on bamboo in preparation for a breeding attempt.</p>
<p>Plans were in place for her to be artificially inseminated for the seventh time since arriving in Scotland from China in 2011.</p>
<p>Keepers at the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) attraction were monitoring the 16-year-old animal’s hormones and behaviour.</p>

<p>But they said vets had been instructed to respect social distancing advice and provide emergency care only.</p>
<p>Darren McGarry, head of living collections at Edinburgh Zoo said today]: “We will not attempt giant panda breeding this year.</p>
<p>“Giant pandas can only become pregnant during a short period, usually over a few days in spring.</p>
<p>“Although the artificial insemination process is routine, it requires a specialist support team and the veterinary guidance at the moment is for vets to respect the social distancing</p>
<p>advice and provide emergency care only.</p>
<p>“These are unprecedented times and we fully support these measures.”</p>
<p>Tian Tian and male Yang Guang – meaning Sunshine – arrived at Edinburgh Zoo in 2011 on a ten year loan from China, for which the RZSS pays £600,000 a year.</p>
<p>Staff have been trying to assist Tian Tian to produce an historic cub in Scotland but efforts have so far failed.</p>
<p>Panda reproduction is a notoriously tricky process, however, with females only ovulating once a year.</p>
<p>Tian Tian has been artificially inseminated since 2013, using samples from Yang Guang, whose testicles were removed in November 2018 due to the presence of tumours.</p>
<p>Mr McGarry added: “We will discuss the next steps with our colleagues in China, though it is too soon to say what these may be.”

<h3 id="zoo-livestreams-endangered-red-pandas-having-breakfast-to-cheer-you-up">Zoo livestreams endangered red pandas having breakfast to cheer you up</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/60/34/98/1000x563_cmsv2_56969144-98c3-5c6d-a585-76abf8614479-4603498.jpg" alt="img">
It&rsquo;s not every day you can sit down to breakfast with some adorable red pandas. But with many of us stuck inside during lockdown, one British zoo came up with the idea of hosting a virtual zoo day to cheer everyone up.</p>
<p>Chester Zoo is in Cheshire, England and is the spot conservationists chose to livestream a group of red pandas enjoying themselves in the trees. It was all to raise awareness of the furry species, who are listed as vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) red list of threatened species.</p>
<p>Although it is estimated around 10,000 red pandas remain, the Red Panda Network says there may only be 2,500 left in the wild. Chester Zoo conservationists say the population has seen a 40 per cent decline in just 50 years.</p>
<p>The zoo is part of a Europe-wide breeding programme for the species. Luckily, so far, the current pandemic &ldquo;has not been affecting this programme, as all good progressive zoos are continuing to care for their animals as normal&rdquo;, assistant PR Manager of the zoo, John Brown, tells Euronews Living. The zoo was lucky enough to have two cubs born last June, the rare twins were named Huo Hu, meaning ‘Firefox’, and Tiang Tang, meaning ‘Heaven’.</p>

<p>Interesting facts about red pandas</p>
<p>There is a lot people don&rsquo;t know about red pandas, for example, the breed is so unique that taxonomists even created a new mammal family for the species, the Ailuridae. They are the original panda species, having been discovered around 50 years before the giant panda. Even the name &lsquo;panda&rsquo; was originally created for just them. They are mostly vegetarian, with a diet that is 98 per cent bamboo.</p>
<p>Red pandas spend most of their time in trees, and more than half of each day sleeping. When it gets really cold, red pandas wrap their tails around themselves and go into a deep sleep, reducing their metabolic demands and lowering both their core temperature and respiration rate.</p>
<p>Their natural habitat is in the mountainous regions of Nepal, India, Bhutan, Myanmar and southern China, where habitat loss, illegal wildlife trade and poaching are threatening their existence.</p>

<h3 id="river-safaris-giant-panda-forest-is-closed-temporarily-for-mating-season">River Safari&rsquo;s Giant Panda Forest is closed temporarily for mating season</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.timeout.com/images/105631230/image.jpg" alt="img">
UPDATE: Looks like mating season is in full swing for our pandas as they go into a love lockdown. JiaJia and KaiKai are receiving all the medical and professional help they can from the team at Wildlife Reserves Singapore. KaiKai also has unlimited access to videos of pandas er, getting it on and a personal trainer to build up strength in his hind legs for when its time to do the deed. Well-wishers can leave their messages of encouragement to the pandas at the video link below. Let&rsquo;s hope KaiKai stops getting distracted by food – though we fully understand the feeling.</p>
<p>The Giant Panda Forest enclosure will be closed for now to give JiaJia and KaiKai their privacy.</p>
<p>When it&rsquo;s time, it&rsquo;s time. The Singapore River Safari pandas are gearing up for mating season. According to Speaker of the Parliament and also deputy chairman of the Wildlife Reserves Singapore, Tan Chuan Jin in a post on Instagram, JiaJia (that&rsquo;s the female panda) is &ldquo;about to become fertile&rdquo; and is looking to get together with her male counterpart KaiKai for some one-on-one time. This is also the sixth time these pandas are trying for a baby. So here&rsquo;s hoping we&rsquo;ll get little panda babies soon cos we all need a bit of good news these days.</p>
<p>In 2015, Kai Kai and entered the mating season for the first time. But despite his best efforts, the natural mating procedure and the artificial insemination method were unsuccessful. This year, the zoo is taking a more natural approach – it&rsquo;s letting the pandas get busy on their own. But it seems that KaiKai is unsure of what to do with his &lsquo;equipment&rsquo; so the team at River Safari is helping him with that. This includes showing KaiKai videos of other pandas mating. Thankfully for KaiKai, the IMDA won&rsquo;t be reviewing his watch history.</p>
<p>Tan Chuan Jin also brought up how the current situation has affected various attractions in Singapore including the Zoo and other wildlife reserves in Singapore as he&rsquo;s noticed lesser visitors. Looking at how the zoos around the world have adapted during these times, let&rsquo;s hope Wildlife Reserves Singapore will follow suit and allow those at home to sneak a peek at what&rsquo;s happening at the parks via webcams.</p>
