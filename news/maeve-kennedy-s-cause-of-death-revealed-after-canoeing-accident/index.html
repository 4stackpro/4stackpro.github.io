New details are being revealed in regards to the canoeing accident involving Robert F. Kennedy&rsquo;s granddaughter and her 8-year-old son.</p>
<p>Just days after Maeve Kennedy Townsend McKean&rsquo;s body was recovered, the chief medical examiner confirms to E! News that her cause of death is drowning, and the manner is an accident.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon, Maryland Natural Resource Police also confirmed they had located the body of Maeve&rsquo;s son Gideon. The morning-son duo was reported missing last Thursday after a canoeing accident in Chesapeake Bay.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Washington Post, Maeve&rsquo;s husband David McKean said children were kicking a ball back and forth in a yard before the ball went into the water. He said his wife and son &ldquo;popped into a canoe to chase it down. They just got farther out than they could handle and couldn&rsquo;t get back in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maryland Natural Resource Police believe the two individuals onboard the canoe &ldquo;appeared to be overtaken by the strong winds.&rdquo; In a powerful Facebook post, Maeve&rsquo;s husband remembered his wife and son for their unforgettable qualities.

<p>The body of Maeve Kennedy McKean, granddaughter of assassinated presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy, has been found in Maryland.</p>
<p>The 40-year-old and her eight-year-old son were last seen on Thursday evening riding in a canoe off Chesapeake Bay.</p>
<p>After an extensive search operation, police said on Monday that her body had been found in water about 2.5 miles (4km) south of where they had set off.</p>
<p>Officials will continue looking for her missing son, Gideon, on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Mrs McKean was the daughter of Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the former Maryland lieutenant governor. She worked as a public health and human rights lawyer and was executive director of Georgetown University&rsquo;s Global Health Initiative.</p>
<p>She had been staying with her family at her mother&rsquo;s house in Shady Side, Maryland, when she went missing.</p>
<p>Her husband, David McKean, said in a Facebook post that they had been &ldquo;self-quarantining&rdquo; there away from their usual residence in Washington DC in order to give their children more space.</p>
<p>He said his wife and son had disappeared after attempting to retrieve a ball they had been playing with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They got into a canoe, intending simply to retrieve the ball, and somehow got pushed by wind or tide into the open bay,&rdquo; he wrote on Friday. &ldquo;About 30 minutes later they were spotted by an onlooker from land, who saw them far out from shore, and called the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Police said last week that their canoe &ldquo;appeared to be overtaken by the strong winds&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Officials also confirmed an overturned boat matching its description had been found on Thursday evening, hours after they went missing.</p>
<p>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mrs McKean - with her cousin, Congressman Joe Kennedy at a DC rally - is part of the Kennedy political dynasty</p>
<p>Boats, helicopters and underwater sonar technology has been used to help locate the pair.</p>
<p>Kathleen Kennedy Townsend paid tribute to her daughter last week, following news that the rescue operation had become a recovery one.</p>
<p>In a statement, she said her daughter had been &ldquo;vivid&rdquo; and had dedicated her life to society&rsquo;s most vulnerable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heart is crushed, yet we shall try to summon the grace of God and what strength we have to honour the hope, energy and passion that Maeve and Gideon set forth into the world,&rdquo; she said in a statement.</p>
<p>Congressman Joe Kennedy, Mrs McKean&rsquo;s cousin, also paid tribute.</p>
<p>Skip Twitter post by @RepJoeKennedy We love you Maeve. We love you Gideon. Our family has lost two of the brightest lights. Grateful for the prayers. Hold your loved ones tight. — Rep. Joe Kennedy III (@RepJoeKennedy) April 4, 2020 Report</p>
<p>David McKean, announcing the family accident on Friday, described his wife as his &ldquo;everything&rdquo; and said his young son was both &ldquo;brave&rdquo; and &ldquo;deeply compassionate&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible to sum up Gideon here. I am heartbroken to even have to try,&rdquo; he wrote on Facebook. &ldquo;I used to marvel at him as a toddler and worry that he was too perfect to exist in this world. It seems to me now that he was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Kennedy family, an American political dynasty, has been beset by a series of tragedies.</p>
<p>Mrs McKean&rsquo;s grandfather, New York Senator Robert F Kennedy, was assassinated in 1968. His death came less than five years after his brother, President John F Kennedy, was also shot dead.

Maeve Kennedy Townsend McKean and her son Gideon have been missing after taking out a canoe on April 2.</p>
<p>Maeve Kennedy Townsend McKean, 40, and her son Gideon Joseph Kennedy McKean, 8, have been missing in Chesapeake Bay, near Annapolis, Maryland, since April 2. The canoe they were last seen has been recovered by search and rescue teams.</p>
<p>Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Maeve Kennedy&rsquo;s mother, said that authorities were now conducting a &ldquo;recovery&rdquo; mission rather than a rescue mission. The two missing people are now presumed dead.</p>
<p>“With profound sadness, I share the news that the search for my beloved daughter Maeve and grandson Gideon has turned from rescue to recovery,” Kathleen Kennedy Townsend said in a statement.</p>

<p>David McKean, Maeve’s husband, told The Washington Post that his family was at a waterfront house, owned by his mother-in-law Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, in Shady Side, Maryland on Thursday, April 2.</p>
<p>McKean said after one of the children kicked a ball into the water, Maeve and Gideon “popped into a canoe to chase it down.</p>
<p>“They just got farther out than they could handle and couldn’t get back in.”</p>
<p>The US Coast Guard said in a statement issued on Friday, April 2 that they were continuing to search for “two canoers last sighted ten miles south of Annapolis near Herring Bay, Maryland, Thursday evening.</p>
<p>“The missing canoers have been identified as a 41-year-old woman and her 8-year-old son.</p>
<p>The statement said that the Coast Guard Sector Maryland National Capitol Region command center “received a report from Maryland State Police members that two individuals were seen struggling to return to shore in a canoe near Herring Bay and not seen again by the reporting individual.”</p>
<p>Both a helicopter and boat crew were launched to assist in the search which continued into Friday.</p>

<p>Anne Arundel County Fire Department separately said in a statement: “At 4:30 pm [on April 2], our 911 Center received a call from a concerned citizen. From the Columbia Beach community pier, the caller stated he saw two people in a small canoe or kayak drifting in the bay.</p>
<p>“A water rescue assignment was dispatched to the area bringing marine resources to the area. Firefighters arrived at the pier and confirmed the sighting of two people in a small vessel several miles from the pier drifting south in the Chesapeake Bay. Boats and helicopters began a search of the Chesapeake Bay.</p>
<p>“At 7 pm, the kayak and a paddle were recovered east of Rockhold Creek in Deale, MD by United States Coast Guard and the Fireboat from the City of Annapolis Fire Department. At 7:30 pm, the search was called off due to darkness.”</p>
<p>The statement added that Maryland Natural Resources Police are the lead investigating agency for the incident, and Anne Arundel Country Fire Department Dive Team and Marine Division are currently assisinting in the search.</p>
<p>In a press conference on April 3, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan said: &ldquo;A former Maryland lieutenant governor&rsquo;s daughter, Maeve, and her 8-year-old grandson, Gideon, went missing after canoeing yesterday afternoon on the South River here in Anne Arundel County.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An intensive search has been underway since late yesterday which has included teams from Maryland Natural Resources Police, Maryland State Police, US Coast Guard, and the Anne Arundel County Fire Department.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reached out to and spoke with Lt. Gov. Townsend this morning and on behalf of the people of Maryland I expressed our most heartfelt sympathies and prayers to her and to her entire family during this difficult time.”</p>
<p>Maeve McKean serves as executive director of the Georgetown University Global Health Initiative. She is the eldest of Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the former Lieutenant Governor of Maryland, and David Townsend&rsquo;s four daughters.</p>
<p>Maeve&rsquo;s maternal grandparents are Senator Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Skakel. She is a grandniece of President John F. Kennedy.</p>
<p>In a statement shared on April 2, the Kennedy family said: “At this time, our family asks for privacy and that everyone keep Maeve and Gideon in their prayers.&rdquo;</p>
