<p>First Lady Melania Trump on Thursday thought she was tweeting a simple “Be Best”-themed puzzle for kids who are stuck indoors — but Twitter was amused for all the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>Along with the word search puzzle, featuring positive adjectives like “thoughtful,” “kind” and “caring,” Trump, 49, shared her latest advice while many Americans are under stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>Get push notifications with news, features and more.</p>
<p>“Hello children!” she wrote. “While you stay home to help keep yourself &amp; others healthy, you can practice your skills with this #BeBest Word Search &amp; other activities.”</p>
<p>Trump critics took her tweet in another direction.</p>
<p>“Somebody asked her to make a list of words that don’t describe her husband,” TV host Samantha Bee’s Full Frontal Twitter account wrote.</p>
<p>“She literally made a list of all the qualities her husband lacks, and formed them into a puzzle,” another user responded. “So creative.”</p>
<p>Referencing a headline-grabbing part of President Donald Trump‘s Thursday coronavirus briefing, Star Wars‘ Mark Hamill tweeted at the first lady: “While you stay home to keep yourself &amp; others healthy, can keep your husband occupied with puzzles &amp; other activities so he won’t keep telling people to take deadly untested drugs or to try injecting themselves with disinfectant?”</p>

<p>The Trumps have sometimes starkly differed in their social media use. Where she trends toward typical commemorations, statements of unity and periodic updates about her work in the White House’s East Wing, the president is a near-constant user — posting defenses of himself, threatening or praising other world leaders and attacking his rivals in personal terms.</p>
<p>This has opened up the first lady to criticism that she is hypocritical because her “Be Best” initiative promotes anti-bullying, despite her husband’s behavior.</p>
<p>What’s more, in December, the first lady used Twitter to express her disapproval over a joke made about her 14-year-old son, Barron, at an impeachment hearing about the president.</p>
<p>But days later, President Trump tweeted mockingly about the teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg.</p>
<p>Mrs. Trump’s spokeswoman said at the time, “It is no secret that the President and First Lady often communicate differently — as most married couples do.”</p>
<p>Earlier this month, when Mrs. Trump asked Americans to wear face masks in public at the request of federal health officials, others noted the president’s dismissal of the preventative measure.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I’m going to be doing it,” he said seconds after announcing the plan in early April.</p>
<p>The first lady has sometimes fanned the flames for her own criticism as well.</p>
<p>While visiting a migrant detention center in 2018 along the Mexico border — where children had been separated from their families while crossing into the U.S. — she wore an olive jacket with the words “I REALLY DON’T CARE, DO U?” across the back.</p>
<p>She later said the message was aimed at “left-wing media.”</p>

<p>Melania Trump may be on damage control early Friday after shocking comments from President Donald Trump sent the wrong message about exploring the possibility of injecting disinfectants as a way to kill off COVID-19.</p>
<p>The First Lady of the United States released a message and tried to continue to provide an uplifting spirit for millions of Americans who are hoping for a light at the end of a very long quarantine tunnel.

<h3 id="us-green-card-ban-embarrassing-says-melania-trump-attorney">US green card ban ‘embarrassing’ says Melania Trump attorney</h3>
<p><img src="https://workpermit.com/sites/default/files/44827129602_24ea392f65_z.jpg" alt="img">
Fortunately, the “ immigration ban” by Donald Trump is very much limited in scope. People wishing to gain entry to the US on a Green Card may face delays of 60 days. However, it is uncertain how much difference it will make to many people. The main part of the process in applying for a Green Card is to apply initially in the US, not at the US Embassy or Consulate. In addition due to coronavirus , US visa processing is suspended at US Embassies and Consulates anyway. They are not accepting new appointments. Therefore unless this ban continues for a lot longer than 60 days it may not make a huge amount of difference to many people.</p>
<p>There are a number of exclusions to the ban as well. Temporary non-immigrant workers such as L1 visa, E2 visa, H1B visa and a number of other groups of migrants are excluded from the partial immigration ban. From a practical point of view even without the new immigration ban it is difficult if not impossible to obtain a new visa at an Embassy or Consulate, and it is difficult and expensive to find flights to the US.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump’s recent limited 60-day US green card ban has been described as ‘embarrassing’ by the attorney who helped secure US citizenship for First Lady Melania Trump and her parents Viktor and Amalija Knavs, plus a green card for Melania’ sister, Ines. Trump signed an executive order enforcing the ban on April 22, 2020.</p>
<p>Michael Wildes blasted Donald Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, calling it embarrassing. The US President insists that the controversial measure will ‘protect American jobs amid the COVID-19 pandemic.’</p>
<p>Trump’s plans initially caused confusion when he tweeted: “In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!”</p>
<p>It was unclear what Trump’s temporary ban on US immigration would mean until the President clarified his position on April 21, stating that the 60-day ban would apply to the processing of applications for new immigrants at Embassies and consulate wishing for Green Cards to the US.</p>
<p>Wildes hits out</p>
<p>In a YouTube video obtained by DailyMailTV, Wildes lashed out at Trump during a web chat with former Hollywood actor turned relocation specialist Andy Newton-Lee.</p>
<p>When asked how he thought Trump was dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, Wildes said: “Embarrassing, embarrassing, I think it’s embarrassing, but I think we have to not criticize, we have to step up and all hands on deck are needed, whether it’s the medical professionals in our hospitals and our first responders in people’s homes.”</p>
<p>“I’m also a mayor in a small city in New Jersey where I live. But now is not the time for us to judge, history will judge the way we respond as a nation,” Wildes added.</p>
<p>The high-profile attorney said he would hold back on any further criticism until the pandemic passes, adding: “We have an opportunity in November to elect somebody different if we don&rsquo;t feel that the president ought to continue that trust, but right now he is our president in the midst of a COVID-19 campaign.</p>
<p>“It’s our job, you, me, others to make sure that those people with accents in this country feel the same sense of hospitality that our founding documents and parents have envisioned and that we realize that it’s that golden experiment, that regeneration of America’s dream and immigration is a huge part of that DNA that will help right this ship. I can judge, but it’s not for me to say, right now it’s for me to do,” Wildes said.</p>
<p>US work visas</p>
<p>During the web chat, Newton-Lee asked Wildes about the current situation for people based overseas in the entertainment industry seeking to obtain US work visas.</p>
<p>Wildes described the US entertainment industry as ‘ground zero’ in helping to reshape society, saying that foreigners – including acting professionals hoping to find work in America – should not lose hope.</p>
<p>“Don&rsquo;t give up on this beautiful country it will take a little while to get back into place personally, but they are moving US visa applications,” Wildes said.</p>
<p>Wildes believes that the entertainment industry will be instrumental in helping to heal America, saying: “Our doors are open for business, America will need people in the entertainment space.”</p>
<p>Immigration important for America’s future</p>
<p>The high-profile attorney argues that immigration is important to the future of America. “We will defeat this disease because of our immigrant doctors, vaccines and medical support. I’ve done stacks of O-visas for hundreds of people in the science and medical professions.”</p>
<p>The former federal prosecutor, who has also served two terms as Mayor of Englewood, New Jersey, was appointed to the District Appeals Board of the Selective Service System for the State of New Jersey and was a member of the New Jersey Governor’s Blue Panel on Immigration, according to a Daily Mail report.</p>
<p>Partial Green card ban</p>
<p>Trump has said that the partial ban on the processing of US green cards at US Embassies and Consulate will run for 60 days and could be extended following an evaluation, after the 60-day period has elapsed. While the ban does not extend to those seeking temporary status in the US or a temporary work permit, the State Department has pretty much ceased processing US visa applications at Consular posts. US Consulates and Embassies around the world have suspended in-person visa appointments, which are a requirement of US visa processing.</p>
<p>Trump did not specify whether the ban applies to immediate family members of people who are already US citizens or hold a permanent status.</p>
<p>Coronavirus in the US</p>
<p>As of April 23, 850,116 coronavirus cases had been reported in the US – the highest in the world. The death toll is nearing 50,000 (47,737) – again, the highest in the world. More than 4 million tests for coronavirus have reportedly taken place in America, while 84,058 people are reported to have recovered from the disease.</p>
