President Trump&rsquo;s incorrect assertion Monday that he has &ldquo;total&rdquo; authority over when states lift or relax coronavirus mitigation rules &ldquo;caught his aides off guard and prompted them to study whether Trump would have such authority in a time of emergency like the ongoing pandemic,&rdquo; The Washington Post reports. Trump continued pushing the idea Tuesday, suggesting that disobeying his orders to reopen the economy would be akin to &ldquo;mutiny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Governors from both parties noted pointedly on Tuesday that they have and will retain the authority to lift social distancing rules they put in place. By his press conference Tuesday night, Trump largely reversed course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be speaking to all 50 governors very shortly and I will then be authorizing each individual governor of each individual state to implement a reopening, and a very powerful reopening plan, of their state at a time and in a manner as most appropriate,&rdquo; Trump said. &ldquo;The day will be very close,&rdquo; and in some states &ldquo;maybe even before the date of May 1.&rdquo; He added that &ldquo;the governors will be very, very respectful of the presidency,&rdquo; but they &ldquo;are responsible, they have to take charge, they have to do a great job,&rdquo; or he might &ldquo;close &lsquo;em up and start all over again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trump outlined a vision in which workers would be tested, perhaps on a weekly basis, and governors would test travelers arriving at their states&rsquo; borders,&rdquo; The Associated Press reports. &ldquo;But the U.S. is nowhere near having that kind of infrastructure.&rdquo; Atypically, Trump ended the press conference without letting federal health officials field questions.</p>
<p>Earlier Tuesday, Trump appeared to threaten to withhold federal assistance from states that don&rsquo;t obey him, oddly placing himself in the role of Capt. William Bligh.</p>
<p>Tell the Democrat Governors that &ldquo;Mutiny On The Bounty&rdquo; was one of my all time favorite movies. A good old fashioned mutiny every now and then is an exciting and invigorating thing to watch, especially when the mutineers need so much from the Captain. Too easy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 14, 2020</p>
<p>One official told the Post that &ldquo;Trump is frustrated that the governors are getting so much credit and no blame while he gets all the blame and none of the credit,&rdquo; specifically complaining about New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D). Trump tweeted Tuesday that Cuomo has been &ldquo;begging&rdquo; for supplies but &ldquo;now he seems to want Independence! That won&rsquo;t happen!&rdquo; Peter Weber

April 13 (UPI) &ndash; Pitbull has released an uplifting new song to raise money for COVID-19 relief.</p>
<p>The 39-year-old rapper and music producer shared the single &ldquo;I Believe That We Will Win (World Anthem)&rdquo; on Monday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what spreads faster than any virus? Is fear / And when it comes to fear, you can either forget everything and run, or you can face everything and rise,&rdquo; Pitbull says at the beginning of the track.</p>
<p>Pitbull said on Monday&rsquo;s episode of Good Morning America that he released &ldquo;I Believe That We Will Win&rdquo; to help keep people motivated and promote positivity amid the coronavirus pandemic. The song&rsquo;s title comes from a popular sports chant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What better message than that? Than &lsquo;I believe that we will win,'&rdquo; Pitbull said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to keep people motivated, gotta keep people positive, because stress and fear &hellip; fear is either you forget everything and run or you face everything and rise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you believe in yourself and you believe that you can do this, you can believe you can fight through this, you believe that you&rsquo;re strong enough to do this &hellip; what better record, what better message?&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re getting some #MondayMotivation from @pitbull! He wants his new single &ldquo;I Believe That We Will Win&rdquo; to keep people motivated and spread a positive message amid coronavirus. https://t.co/g9fdkXd9zB pic.twitter.com/Wi1knrUXJL— Good Morning America (@GMA) April 13, 2020</p>
<p>Pitbull had teased the song at the end of March.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s show the world, how powerful it is when we come together to fight for one cause - that&rsquo;s called life,&rdquo; he said on Instagram.</p>
<p>In a post last week, Pitbull asked fans to submit videos of themselves for the &ldquo;I Believe That We Will Win&rdquo; music video and said proceeds from the song will go toward coronavirus relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I Believe That We Will Win&rdquo; is Pitbull&rsquo;s first new song of 2020. He released his 11th studio album, Libertad 548, in September.
