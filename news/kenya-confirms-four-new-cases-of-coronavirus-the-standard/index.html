Kenya confirms four new cases of coronavirus as number hit 126</p>
<p>Four more people have tested positive for coronavirus bringing the national tally to 126, Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe () said. Speaking at Afya House during the daily update on the status of the coronavirus, Kagwe said 372 people had been tested in the last 24 hours where four tested positive. He said three out of the four were Kenyans while one is a Pakistani national.</p>

<p>In terms of gender, Kagwe said three new cases are male while one is a female, adding that two of them travelled from Malawi and Pakistan and the other two contracted the disease locally. Kagwe said out of 2050 in mandatory quarantine, the government tested 1,866 people while 184 individuals are yet to be tested. He said 1,781 are being monitored in contact tracing with 1,100 being discharged on the expiry of 14 days.</p>

<p>Another 672 people are being monitored on the government’s follow-up programme. Kagwe said the few cases reported today mean that government directives such as the dusk to dawn curfew have gotten positive impact on containing the virus.</p>

<p>“Kenya is lucky that the numbers are not increasing exponentially. We believe the measures taken like the curfew and social distancing are having this effect,” the CS said. He also said that those the number of confirmed positive cases rank the highest in quarantine facilities within the country, which poses a high rate of transmission especially from those who have not taken the guidelines seriously. “We have instructed medical teams to extend quarantine period for another 14 days, in facilities where quarantines breached protocols and went partying.”CS Kagwe pleaded with the youth to step up in the fight against coronavirus, as they make up a large part of society.</p>

<p>“The youth are the biggest component of our society and they are largely mobile; they have the energy, Let them unleash this energy to fight coronavirus disease,” he advised. Kagwe said the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) is conducting research to ensure that the country manufactures its own testing kits.</p>

<h3 id="kenya-has-freed-nearly-5000-inmates-via-newly-adopted-skype-court-sessions">Kenya has freed nearly 5000 inmates via newly adopted Skype court sessions</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180809154441-kenya-prison-reform-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) Kenya is decongesting its prisons to prevent overcrowding as a way to curtail the spread of coronavirus in the country.</p>
<p>In the past month, the East African country has released 4800 prisoners in different parts of the country, according to Anne Amadi, the chief registrar of the judiciary in Kenya.</p>
<p>Many of the sessions leading to the release of these prisoners were held virtually through Skype and Zoom, she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We prioritized getting a lot of people out of prison, especially petty offenders. Those who are in prison for a short term and those who have been there for a long time but have just about six months and below to go,&rdquo; she told CNN.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As of Friday last week, we managed to decongest the prison by about 4800 inmates from different parts of the country. All our 39 high court stations have released people. Most of them, a good number, through Skype or Zoom,&rdquo; she added.

DP: I&rsquo;m not tending cabbages, Uhuru and I are drawing coronavirus plan</p>
<p>Deputy President William Ruto has broken his silence on the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>In a tweet on Friday, he said President Uhuru Kenyatta and him are working on practical strategies to deal with Covid-19.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All options are on our cards,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>He downplayed a previous picture of him in a garden, saying he is &ldquo;not tending Sugoi cabbages&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Kenyan politicians have been criticised for being too quiet on the pandemic.</p>
<p>The Deputy President has also been missing when President Uhuru gave updates to the nation on the state of the virus in Kenya.</p>
<p>As cases rise, it is uncertain what further measures will be put in place.</p>
<p>Industrialisation Cabinet Secretary Betty Maina on Friday said the country will locally produce 60 million masks as citizens are urged to wear the masks regularly.</p>
<p>They will retail at Sh20, the CS added.</p>
<p>Deputy President Ruto said there should be no panic.</p>
<p>Kenyans are anxious there may be a looming lockdown as confirmed cases and deaths rise.</p>
<p>By April 3, 2020, some 122 cases had been confirmed in Kenya and the death toll hitting four.</p>
<p>The latest casualty was a six-year-old boy who died at the Kenyatta National Hospital.</p>
<p>Health CAS Dr Mercy Mwangangi said the boy, however, had underlying health problems.</p>
<p>In his tweet, Ruto went on, &ldquo;There should be no panic. We will pull through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He urged Kenyans to comply with the advisories as reviewed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kenya’s fight against coronavirus pandemic got a major boost after the World Bank approved emergency funding of Sh5 billion.</p>
<p>The funds, said the World Bank in a press statement, will enhance the country’s capacity to manage Covid-19 crisis. It will cover costs related to tests, quarantine, isolation and treat people affected by the deadly virus that has so far claimed three lives in Kenya.</p>
<p>Other areas to be financed by the kitty include medical waste disposal, risk communications and community engagement, as well as strengthening the country’s capacity to provide safe blood.</p>
<p>“This facility will assist Kenya in its efforts to prevent, detect and respond to the threat posed by COVID-19 and strengthen national systems for public health preparedness,” said Carlos Felipe Jaramillo, the World Bank Country Director for Kenya.</p>
