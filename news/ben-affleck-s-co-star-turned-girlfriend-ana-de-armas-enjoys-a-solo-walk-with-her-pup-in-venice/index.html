<p>Alone time: While Ben Affleck&rsquo;s girlfriend Ana de Armas has been quarantining with her co-star turned lover at his Pacific Palisades home, she soaked in the fresh air with just her beloved Maltese pup on Friday</p>
<p>She paired the monochromatic ensemble with a pair of black sandals and styled her dark tresses in laid-back waves.</p>
<p>Despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, the Blade Runner 2049 actress, opted against Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti&rsquo;s advisement to wear a face mask.</p>
<p>Last month, she and her Oscar-winning beau began isolating together following their two romantic getaways to Costa Rica and Cuba.</p>

<p>&lsquo;They seem to have a great time together,&rsquo; a source told People. &lsquo;They order delivery food and groceries and only leave the house for walks around the neighborhood with their dogs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ben looks incredibly happy. They are flirty and goofy. Ana always has a huge smile around him,&rsquo; the insider added.</p>
<p>A source previously told the magazine that they had an &lsquo;instant connection&rsquo; while filming the movie.</p>

<p>Entertaining guests: Meanwhile, boyfriend Ben Affleck was spotted having a friend over during quarantine</p>
<p>&lsquo;They had great chemistry right from the start,&rsquo; the source said of Affleck and de Armas, who play a couple in the movie from Fatal Attraction director Adrian Lyne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ben always seemed very relaxed and happy around Ana, but at the time there were no signs of romance. He was very focused on making a fantastic movie.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Though Ana has been making trips back and forth from Ben&rsquo;s home to her own Los Angeles residence, they&rsquo;ve been spending the majority of their time together.</p>
<p>Quarantining together: Ben Affleck is frequently seen on PDA-filled dog walks with his girlfriend Ana de Armas, who he met filming the upcoming thriller Deep Water last year</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Us Weekly reported that Ben and his ex-wife Jennifer Garner have been discussing how best to introduce his new woman to their son Samuel, 8, and daughters Violet, 14, and Seraphina, 11.</p>
<p>Jennifer is reportedly hesitant about introducing de Armas to the children too quickly, which Ben is &lsquo;understanding&rsquo; of.</p>
<p>So far, he has agreed to &lsquo;work with Jennifer to prepare the kids&rsquo; to meet Ana.</p>
<p>As for the Peppermint star, she&rsquo;s been quietly dating Cali Group chairman John Miller since May 2018.

<h3 id="ben-affleck-is-working-with-matt-damon-again-is-the-former-batman-vying-for-an-oscar">Ben Affleck Is Working With Matt Damon Again; Is the Former Batman Vying for an Oscar?</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ben-Affleck-and-Matt-Damon-640x465.jpg" alt="img">
Back in the 1990s, it was hard to think of Ben Affleck or Matt Damon without the other coming to mind. Most notably, the duo co-starred and co-wrote the screenplay for 1997’s Good Will Hunting. Their Academy Award win for Best Original Screenplay cemented their intertwining careers and longtime friendship.</p>
<p>While they still cross paths every now and then, Affleck and Damon have fostered very distinctive careers. Damon went on to land arguably his most famous role as Jason Bourne. And Affleck became a respected director in his own right. Now Affleck and Damon are coming back together for a new movie. And fans couldn’t be more excited.</p>

<p>Ben Affleck and Matt Damon have a long history</p>
<p>Affleck and Damon go back way further than Good Will Hunting. In fact, the two stars are childhood friends who reunited when they each found themselves pursuing showbiz careers. And even before their Oscar win, the actors shared a few notable credits — including School Ties and Glory Daze — in the first half of the 1990s.</p>
<p>After their joint Academy Award win, Affleck and Damon became known for their real-life friendship and behind-the-scenes collaborations. They both appeared in a number of films directed by Kevin Smith, most notably as co-leads of 1999’s Dogma. And the stars created TV series like filmmaking documentary Project Greenlight and short-lived reality show The Runner.</p>
<p>Ben Affleck is rebuilding his career post-Batman</p>
<p>While Damon has starred in recent flops like Downsizing and Suburbicon, he most recently appeared in the Oscar-winning hit Ford v Ferrari. However, Affleck is in a much more dire place right now. In the past few years, he ended his run as Batman after the disappointing performance of 2017’s Justice League.</p>
<p>Then the very next year, he and Jennifer Garner finalized their divorce. A recovering alcoholic, Affleck has also struggled to maintain his sobriety since 2017. He has since opened up about grappling with anxiety and depression. So the upcoming reunion with Damon might actually be coming at the perfect time.</p>
<p>Since 2007, Affleck has directed critically acclaimed hits Gone, Baby, Gone, The Town, and Best Picture-winning Argo. But that level of success eluded him with 2016’s Live By Night, the last film he had such creative control over. After the modest success of 2020’s The Way Back, working with Damon again could put Affleck back on top and maybe on the Oscar stage.</p>
<p>Could he be hoping for another Oscar win?</p>
<p>The actors and writers behind Good Will Hunting are back together on The Last Duel. Based on the book The Last Duel: A True Story of Trial by Combat in Medieval France, the film stars Damon and Adam Driver as two friends who must fight to the death. Affleck will take on a supporting role in the film.</p>
<p>Damon and Affleck are co-writing the screenplay with Nicole Holofcener (Can You Ever Forgive Me?). But the film — directed by the legendary Ridley Scott — halted production due to the coronavirus pandemic. So, while The Last Duel was earmarked for a late 2020 release, its date may change. Yet, another Affleck-Damon collaboration could be what the stars need now.</p>
<p>Besides the novelty of the stars working together again, The Last Duel boasts the filmmaker behind Alien and Gladiator. With Scott and recent Oscar nominee Adam Driver also involved, the period drama could be positioned to be a big award season player. It depends on whether Scott and his team will be able to complete and release in time to qualify.
