(CNN) America, listen: We&rsquo;re in the coronavirus era now . By today, a good portion of the population will have been cooped up in their homes for several weeks, talking to their houseplants and reminiscing about what it was like to go to restaurants. And if the cabin fever doesn&rsquo;t get to them, surely the global cloud of human suffering will. That doesn&rsquo;t make for a jocular vibe.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take this opportunity to clarify something: April Fools&rsquo; Day pranks are not funny right now. Don&rsquo;t do them.</p>
<p>Many people have been pretty clear that April Fools&rsquo; Day is all but canceled this year, seeing that pretty much every day for the past few weeks has felt like a terrible prank.</p>
<p>Even Google, which traditionally shares April Fools&rsquo; Day pranks and jokes across its platforms, is abstaining from such tomfoolery this year, according to a Business Insider report</p>
<p>And if you still think something like a coronavirus prank may be a big laugh, keep in mind a few things that could happen: You could get arrested. You could endanger other people&rsquo;s lives. And, at the very least, your friends and family will know just how unfunny you really are.</p>
<p>Thinking of pretending you have coronavirus? In the US, a man who allegedly coughed in the direction of a grocery clerk and said he had the virus was charged with making a terrorist threat in the third degree, according to the New Jersey Attorney General&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>Looking to cause a scene? A Missouri man who filmed himself licking items on a Walmart shelf while saying &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s afraid of the coronavirus&rdquo; was charged with making a terrorist threat in the second degree, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.</p>
<p>Another woman in Pennsylvania is facing criminal charges after intentionally coughing on grocery store produce, CNN reported last week. The store had to throw out $35,000 worth of food as a caution.</p>
<p>Even local officials in different countries have asked citizens not to pull any coronavirus pranks this year.</p>
<p>In Thailand, the Attorney General&rsquo;s office warned people against spreading fake news, the country&rsquo;s English-language newspaper Nation Thailand reported</p>
<p>And in India, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh announced on Twitter that legal action would be taken against people pulling coronavirus stunts on WhatsApp and other social media platforms.</p>
<p>Your messy attempt at a prank may not earn you a criminal record, but consider what will actually happen if you hop onto Facebook and say, &ldquo;Hey ma, I&rsquo;ve got coronavirus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only will your loved ones worry about you, you&rsquo;ll send anyone who&rsquo;s had contact with you in the last two weeks into apoplexy. You may even get health officials poking around asking questions, or end up taxing already-suffocating medical resources with your foolery.</p>
<p>Be sure to tell the exhausted health care worker who has to deal with you that it was &ldquo;just a joke.&rdquo; They&rsquo;ll find it hilarious.</p>
<p>April Fools&rsquo; Day pranks have always been a dicey endeavor, but they&rsquo;re going to be even more difficult to pull off if you can&rsquo;t even get close to someone. No, that&rsquo;s not a challenge.</p>
<p>Social distancing bubbles are sacred now. We&rsquo;re literally being tasked with keeping each other healthy. Is that enough to sacrifice for whatever scheme you&rsquo;ve cooked up in your self-isolated sopor?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a better April Fools&rsquo; Day prank this year: Stay very far away from people, wash your hands, and don&rsquo;t pluck at the few fragile little threads holding together our collective sanity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be a hit.

<h3 id="dont-even-think-about-doing-an-april-fools-day-joke">Don&rsquo;t Even Think About Doing an April Fool&rsquo;s Day Joke</h3>
<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-92568725-1585668992.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.610xh;0.00160xw,0.135xh&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">
.</p>
<p>Unfortunate but unsurprising news for the members of the Ha Ha Hive out there: April Fool&rsquo;s Day is canceled and if you pull a prank online or in person you are guilty of a misdemeanor and have to Venmo me $5,000. At his daily informercial yesterday, President Trump got up after a rousing speech from the founder of MyPillow, yelled at a couple reporters for reminding him of things he actually said with his actual mouth, and then announced that April Fool&rsquo;s Day would be canceled this year, with no postponement currently under consideration. It&rsquo;s a tough but necessary blow to the prank economy. If you have access to Ryan Reynolds and George Clooney, please check in on them at this difficult time.</p>
<p>The move does have its detractors, though. Some say that the aggressive fun of lying to friends and associates for comedy reasons is just what the country needs to lift morale. Indeed, there are many reports of internal conflicts about the move in the Trump administration. Reportedly Jared Kushner argued that lying is the administration&rsquo;s most popular initiative and coming out against it, even for a day, would hurt their uncredibility. Nevertheless, for the first time the president made a decision with the public good in mind and outlawed April Fool&rsquo;s Day 2020.</p>
<p>Honestly, I&rsquo;m glad about this. The fact is there&rsquo;s no April Fool&rsquo;s joke powerful enough to counteract the present. Your scientists have tried and your scientists have failed. Ashton Kutcher was flown in from his secret wealthy person bunker and locked in a lab, but the results don&rsquo;t look great.</p>
<p>Woe to the person who thinks they have the solution! What are you going to do, tweet &ldquo;Rihanna&rsquo;s album is out! April Fool&rsquo;s!&quot;? The public will rise up upon you like a wall of fire and you will experience a cancellation so strong it will show up on a seismograph. Rolling on to Facebook, chuckling to yourself, and having the Tia and Temerity to type &ldquo;Zoom introduces new filter that keeps your face neutral even when you roll your eyes.&rdquo; Nope. No thank you. Keep the fiction in books, dearie. Put up or shut up 2020.</p>

<p>The only April Fool&rsquo;s Day joke I want to receive is from my landlord: &ldquo;Hi, rent is due. April Fool&rsquo;s! Can you imagine? OMG, have a great day and don&rsquo;t worry about sending me any money for a while. Also, I heard a rumor Rihanna&rsquo;s album came out? Huge if true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So many people like to terrorize their officemates with April Fool&rsquo;s jokes. What are you going to do now, Chad? Trick you Golden Retriever into thinking it&rsquo;s Friday? Really? You can play a prank on your kids if you want, but you should probably take into account that after you deceive your children, you have to live in the same space as them 24 hours a day for the foreseeable future. What&rsquo;s the plan, Chad?! You gotta think about April 2; you gotta think about April 10. You gotta think about the forty-first of Augtober. This is not a time for jokes. Well, except for these jokes, which are telling you explicitly that they are untruths and also are being brought to you in the month of March. So, to clarify: me=uncanceled, everything else=canceled. It&rsquo;s the law!</p>

<p>Actually, you know what? Why stop at canceling April 1? Let&rsquo;s cancel the whole month of April. Tax Day already got moved and Chromantica is postponed; let&rsquo;s just stay in March until we&rsquo;re able to touch each other&rsquo;s hands again. If we stop time, no one will age (this is science), none of the weird things we tweet will count, and Rihanna will eventually have to release that album. Once that happens, we can begin again!

<h3 id="april-fools-day-at-home-here-are-9-lighthearted-pranks">April Fools’ Day at home: Here are 9 lighthearted pranks</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.spokesman.com/photos/2020/03/31/Clooney_3EFJkMo_t1200.jpg?298603a24e8d51915fce203907ff2746e482a5a6" alt="img">
With the arrival of April Fools’ Day and a need for laughter, here are a few lighthearted pranks to keep the spirit up in a coronavirus quarantine:</p>
<p>Replace framed photos</p>
<p>The premise is simple if not requiring a little dexterity to not get caught: Replace all the existing framed family photos in your home with celebrities, historical figures or pop culture characters of your choosing. The payoff might not always be immediate if housemates fail to discover the swapped photos, but even that only makes the slow-burning revelation that much better.</p>
<p>Lamp shade insects</p>
<p>Make paper cutouts or order fake assortments of insects and attach them to the inside of a lamp shade. After turning the lamp on, the silhouettes of the chosen bugs will spread across the shade and leave an uneasy surprise for anyone unlucky enough to notice first.</p>
<p>Airhorn door stopper</p>
<p>In the event of being quarantined with an airhorn, this is a timely way to put it to use. Tape the airhorn to the wall with the top of the cannister facing toward the door handle so whoever opens it gets to experience one of the most alarming door stoppers ever.</p>
<p>Jellybeans in the ice dispenser</p>
<p>This simple gag exchanges crushed and cubed ice for a stream of jellybeans. Fill the ice dispenser with the preferred jellybean type and observe a surge of sweets occupy the unsuspecting person’s cup.</p>
<p>Cardboard cutout of a celebrity in the shower</p>
<p>This is a minimal setup for a maximum reward. Greet the next housemate who uses the shower with a cardboard cutout of any given public figure and listen to the shock ensue.</p>
<p>Chaotic candy bowl</p>
<p>On the morning of April Fools’ Day, debut a bowl that contains a mix of M&amp;Ms, Skittles and Reese’s Pieces. This, as expected, will become the ire of taste buds throughout the house. We cannot guarantee a safe reaction from housemates after this trick has been employed.</p>
<p>Googly-eye food</p>
<p>One of the more wholesome tactics in this list, attach googly eyes to all of the contents in your fridge. The next person who looks for a bite to eat will see a dozen pair of eyes staring right back.</p>
<p>Bubble wrap under a rug</p>
<p>If there happens to be spare bubble wrap lying around unpopped, fit it beneath a rug that hosts a lot of foot traffic. You’ll know when it works when you hear the double-barreled reaction of the bubble wrap bursting and someone yelping.</p>
<p>Frozen toothbrush cup</p>
<p>The night before April Fools’ Day, take your housemates’ toothbrush cups, fill it with water and stow them in the fridge. In the morning, they’ll wake up to their own toothbrush icicle. The most harm this trick does is the bad breath the trick-doer might endure in the morning.</p>
<p>Happy April Fools’ Day!
