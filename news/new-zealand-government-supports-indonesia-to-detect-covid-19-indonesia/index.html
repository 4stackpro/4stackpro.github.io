New Zealand has stepped up its support for Indonesia in its efforts to tackle COVID-19 by increasing the capacity, quantity and quality of COVID-19 testing.</p>
<p>The New Zealand Government will provide NZ$150,000 to the Ejikman Institute for Molecular Biology, in the Ministry of Research and Technology, to contribute to the COVID-19 response efforts.</p>
<p>President Joko Widodo assigned the Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology as one of Indonesia’s reference laboratories for COVID-19 testing on 13 March 2020. Since then, the number of COVID-19 samples referred to the Institute has increased exponentially. Within days, the Institute has produced and disseminated 20,000 Viral Transport Medium (VTM) to 95 health facilities across Indonesia.</p>
<p>VTM is an important medium for transporting swabs of suspected COVID-19 patients from hospitals or health care facilities. During this pandemic, the VTM’s have been in short supply and are critical for increased testing capacity.</p>
<p>“Our contribution will enable the Eijkman Institute to continue producing and distributing 100,000 VTMs and provide supplies for accurate and reliable Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis to detect the cases of COVID-19 in Indonesia,” said New Zealand Ambassador to Indonesia, Dr. Jonathan Austin.</p>
<p>Professor Amin Soebandrio, PhD, the Chair of the Eijkman Institute said, “It is critical to continuously deliver accurate and reliable diagnosis for COVID-19 cases in Indonesia by producing VTM, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal flocked swabs and RNA extraction kits.”</p>
<p>“New Zealand has a long history of supporting Indonesia, and has always stepped up to assist in times of crises. We remain committed to support Indonesia as it works through the implications of this pandemic”, said New Zealand Ambassador Dr. Jonathan Austin.</p>

<h3 id="ardern-optimistic-as-new-zealand-records-lowest-number-of-covid-19-cases-for-two-weeks">Ardern optimistic as New Zealand records lowest number of Covid-19 cases for two weeks</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65c3e0b403f061ec2635f23149f1f2b266aeec4a/0_43_5472_3284/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=351c1d21deac91ef11aaaec6821efe92" alt="img">
New Zealand has recorded its lowest number of new coronavirus cases in a fortnight, one day after testing a record number of people.</p>
<p>There were 50 new confirmed or probable cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand on Wednesday, with 4,098 tests for the virus processed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The number of new cases dropped from 54 on Tuesday and 67 on Monday. New Zealand’s government announced a strict national lockdown a fortnight ago that requires everyone except essential workers to stay home at all times, unless they are accessing vital services or walking for exercise.</p>
<p>Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, said while the country “might see bumps along the way,” she was encouraged that the country might be “turning a corner” in quashing the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>“I have cautious optimism, but now is the time to stay the course,” she told reporters at parliament in Wellington on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In total, 1,210 total cases have been reported in New Zealand with 282 of those people now recovered from the virus. One person has died of the coronavirus since the pandemic began.</p>
<p>There are 12 people in hospital, four of them in intensive care and two of those in a critical condition.</p>
<p>New Zealand’s approach in invoking early, restrictive shutdown measures has been widely praised. But two weeks into a lockdown of at least four weeks, officials warned against complacency as arrests rose over breaches of the rules.</p>
<p>A total 76 people were caught by officers violating the stay-at-home restrictions in the previous 24 hours alone, said police commissioner Andrew Coster on Wednesday, adding that a total of 367 breaches had been recorded by the police so far.</p>
<p>Eight officers had been forced into self-isolation after people claiming to have Covid-19 had spat on them in “incredibly distressing” incidents, Coster said.</p>
<p>“You end up with people who don’t know whether they’re at risk,” he added.</p>
<p>While the restrictive measures have been widely supported in New Zealand, heads of industry urged MPs on Wednesday for more clarity on a roadmap for how businesses would exit the lockdown.</p>
<p>Phil O’Reilly, the former chief executive of Business New Zealand, told meeting of the parliamentary committee scrutinising the government’s actions on Covid-19 that firms understood officials could not yet say when the most restrictive shutdown measures would end. But lifting them without warning would cause “all sorts of confusion”, he said.</p>
<p>“Business is not saying tell us a date,” he said. “They’re saying tell us a pathway.”</p>
<p>Chris Roberts, representing the tourism sector, New Zealand’s biggest export earner, said he expected an NZ$12bn drop in tourist spending over the next six months. Most companies had “zero” income and would need government support beyond its wage subsidy scheme, he added.</p>
<p>But halfway through the country’s month-long lockdown, attention was mostly fixed on surviving the next two weeks. Ardern, speaking at her daily news conference, was asked how her life had changed during the shutdown.</p>
<p>“I miss people,” she said. “This is nothing against any of the fine people in this room,” she added, referring to the reporters she briefs daily. “But I am used to having a lot of contact with the public.”</p>

<h3 id="coronavirus-government-extends-new-zealands-state-of-national-emergency-during-covid-19-crisis">Coronavirus: Government extends New Zealand&rsquo;s state of national emergency during COVID-19 crisis</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/04/coronavirus-government-extends-new-zealand-s-state-of-national-emergency-during-covid-19-crisis/_jcr_content/par/video/image.dynimg.1280.q75.jpg/v1586224687257/peeni-henare-CREDIT-NEWSHUB-081219-1120.jpg" alt="img">
The Government has extended New Zealand&rsquo;s state of national emergency for a further seven days as the country&rsquo;s COVID-19 case total climbs to 1160.</p>
<p>The announcement was made via the Civil Defence National Emergency Management Agency&rsquo;s Twitter on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The state of national emergency to support the COVID-19 response will be extended a second time, for a further seven days,&rdquo; the agency said. &ldquo;This is an extension to the state of national emergency only and does not change the Alert Level 4 lockdown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a statement issued on Tuesday afternoon, Civil Defence Minister Peeni Henare said the extension has been declared &ldquo;to support the COVID-19 response&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the advice of the Director of Civil Defence Emergency Management and after consultation with the Prime Minister, I consider the State of National Emergency should remain in place to support the COVID-19 response,&rdquo; Henare said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The powers activated by the state of national emergency enable Civil Defence emergency management professionals to carry out critical work during this time, including managing roads, traffic and public places [and] providing first aid, food, shelter and accommodation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use of these powers have included the requisitioning of a carpark so it can be used as a community-based assessment centre, and to support NZ Police to prevent people from doing non-essential activities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Government first declared a state of national emergency in response to the COVID-19 crisis on March 25. Although it lasts for just seven days, it can be extended as many times as the Government deems necessary. The declaration provides authorities with increased power to be used &ldquo;when necessary&rdquo;.</p>
