<p>People are remembering quotes and dialogues from his last movie Chhichore, which was ironically about his Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s character encouraging his son to fight suicidal thought and teaching him how to accept failure. Netizens are urging, anyone who is dealing with suicidal thoughts, depressive feelings or anxiety must reach out to their loved ones. People must vent out their feelings to not be pushed towards something as scary as suicide. Take a look at some of the #MentalHealthMatters tweets:</p>
