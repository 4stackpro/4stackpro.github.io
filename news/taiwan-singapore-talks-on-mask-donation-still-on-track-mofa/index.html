<h3 id="singapore-gets-stricter-on-enforcement-to-curb-spread-of-virus">Singapore gets stricter on enforcement to curb spread of virus</h3>
<p><img src="https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/04/12/640904.jpg" alt="img">
SINGAPORE: Singapore will start imposing fines on first-timers who flout social-distancing rules, while those who aren’t wearing masks may be barred from entering some premises which provide essential services, as the spread of Covid-19 (coronavirus) in the city-state showed few signs of abating.</p>
<p>The government has closed beaches, and some areas of parks and nature reserves, saying &ldquo;tougher measures” are necessary as safe-distancing measures aren’t being strictly followed. It is also making it mandatory for commuters to wear masks on public transport even after the end of a partial lockdown period.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In theory, we could keep most places open, so long as safe distancing measures are strictly adhered to,” Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday. &ldquo;But increasingly we see that this is hard to achieve.”</p>
<p>The country reported its highest daily increase of infections Thursday with more than 200 of the 287 new cases linked to foreign worker dormitories, where inhabitants often stay in cramped conditions. The number of new cases were at 198 on Friday and 191 on Saturday, with many infections as yet unlinked to known clusters.</p>
<p>Singapore has banned social gatherings and shuttered most workplaces till at least May 4 as part of measures to slow the pace of infections. Schools are also closed, and only those providing essential services are allowed to remain open during what it’s calling a &ldquo;circuit breaker” period. Starting Sunday, people visiting various markets, convenience stores, pharmacies and shopping malls will have to wear masks, or be denied entry, authorities said in a statement.</p>
<p>The government, which has distributed masks to each household, will make it compulsory to wear them on public transport after the partial lockdown is over and buses and trains become crowded again, according to Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will minimise transmission in public transport during post-CB period when safe distancing is compromised,” Khaw said in a Facebook post on Saturday. &ldquo;To prepare for this, we will get commuters to wear masks, now, when using public transport.”</p>
<p>Khaw didn’t say how long it will remain mandatory for the masks to be used.</p>
<p>Enforcement officers will impose a fine of S$300 even on first-time offenders who violate circuit breaker rules, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli wrote in a Facebook post. There are still too many people not taking the circuit breaker measures seriously, Masagos said on Saturday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We issued more than 3,000 stern warnings today, and more fines,” he wrote. &ldquo;Stiffer penalties are clearly needed.”</p>
<p>The government has repeatedly asked senior citizens to stay at home, with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong making a &ldquo;special appeal” to them on Friday to remain indoors for their own safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am one of you, so I know how you feel,” the 68-year-old leader said. &ldquo;But please understand: We are telling you to stay at home for your own safety. Older people are more vulnerable to the virus. If we catch Covid-19, it is a serious matter. Our chances of dying are much higher.”</p>
<p>Singapore will set up two floating accommodations to temporarily house healthy foreign workers starting next week, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore said Saturday. Foreign workers will go through health checks including swab tests before boarding, and the government will arrange for their daily essential needs while a medical facility will be set up nearby on land.</p>
<p>The facilities housing thousands of foreign workers have emerged as one of Singapore’s biggest challenges in its fight to stem the coronavirus. With the new cases, those groups now account for about a quarter of all infections.</p>
<p>There are more than 284,000 foreign workers in the construction sector, according to June 2019 data published by the manpower ministry. That accounts for nearly 5% of Singapore’s population of 5.7 million. - Bloomberg</p>

<h3 id="233-new-covid-19-cases-in-singapore-7-new-clusters-including-mbs-restaurant-and-mcdonalds">233 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore, 7 new clusters including MBS restaurant and McDonald&rsquo;s</h3>
<p><img src="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12635782/16x9/991/557/a9bbe000b7d2a7ea7f2cea002c57aa42/GH/black-tap-restaurant-mbs.png" alt="img">
SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 233 new COVID-19 cases on Sunday (Apr 12), taking its total number of cases to 2,532.</p>
<p>Of the new cases, 51 are linked to known clusters while 15 are linked to earlier cases. The remaining 167 have no links to earlier cases, pending contact tracing, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in its daily update.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Seven new clusters were found, including one linked to the Black Tap restaurant at Marina Bay Sands, another linked to fast food chain McDonald&rsquo;s, and others linked to foreign worker dormitories Tuas View Dormitory and 85 Kallang Dormitory.</p>
<p>Black Tap - a restaurant known for its burgers and milkshakes - is linked to eight cases, while McDonald&rsquo;s is linked to five infections.</p>
<p>Tuas View Dormitory and 85 Kallang Dormitory have six and five infections respectively.</p>
<p>The remaining clusters are linked to Acacia Lodge at Bukit Batok Street 23 (15 cases), as well as 36 Woodlands Industrial Park E1 (20 cases) and a Kenyon/UBS construction site at 9 Penang Road which has eight cases.</p>
<p>Acacia Lodge is one of the latest foreign worker dormitories to be gazetted as an isolation area, meaning residents will have to be quarantined in their rooms.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>On Sunday, MOH said that 32 more cases have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 560 have fully recovered.</p>
<p>Of the 976 patients who are still in hospital, most are stable or improving, while 31 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.</p>
<p>There are 988 cases who are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19 being isolated and cared for at community facilities. The death toll still stands at eight.</p>
<p>MORE CASES REPORTED AT FOREIGN WORKER DORMS</p>
<p>More cases have also been reported at existing clusters, include numerous foreign worker dormitories.</p>
<p>Thirty additional cases were linked to the S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, which now has a total of 365 confirmed cases - the biggest cluster in Singapore.</p>
<p>Seven additional cases were linked to the cluster at Westlite Toh Guan dormitory, which now has 76 cases.</p>
<p>Five more cases were linked to Toh Guan Dormitory, taking its total to 45, while 17 more cases were linked to Sungei Tengah Lodge, which now has 80 cases.</p>
<p>One additional case was linked to Tampines Dormitory, taking its total to 51. Four more cases were linked to Kranji Lodge, which now has 13 confirmed cases.</p>
<p>Ten additional cases were linked to Cochrane Lodge I and six additional cases to Cochrane Lodge II, taking their totals to 32 and 17 respectively.</p>
<p>Eight additional cases were linked to Shaw Lodge, which now has 16 cases, and four additional cases were linked to Cassia @ Penjuru, which now has nine cases.</p>
<p>Two more cases were linked to a cluster at 31 Sungei Kadut Avenue and 21B Senoko Loop, which now has 11 cases.</p>
<p>Four more cases were linked to a construction site at Project Glory, which now has 46 cases.</p>
<p>Four additional cases were linked to renovations sites at the National University Hospital, which now has 20 confirmed cases.</p>
<p>Mustafa Centre was linked to four additional cases, taking its total to 82.</p>
<p>One additional case was linked to wedding venue The Orange Ballroom, which now has five cases.</p>
<p>NUMBER OF IMPORTED CASES HAS COME DOWN TO ZERO</p>
<p>MOH also gave an overview of the trend in daily COVID-19 cases based on different transmission types.</p>
<p>The number of imported cases rose around mid-March due to a large number of returnees, but has since come down to zero, said the ministry.</p>
<p>The number of cases in the community increased following a wave of new imported cases but has seen some moderation in recent days. This is in light of safe distancing measures put in place earlier, said MOH.</p>
<p>However, the number of work permit and dormitory-related cases has increased sharply and this is likely to go up, &ldquo;especially as we undertake more aggressive testing in dormitories&rdquo;, said MOH.</p>
<p>Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. As of noon on Saturday, MOH has identified 28,140 close contacts who have been quarantined. Of these, 12,088 are currently quarantined, and 16,052 have completed their quarantine.</p>
<p>Authorities further tightened circuit breaker measures on Saturday, recommending that commuters wear masks on public transport and closing all beaches.</p>
<p>Markets will also refuse entry to people not wearing face masks and food outlets will face fines if their workers do not wear masks or face shields.</p>
<p>During the circuit breaker period, which lasts from Apr 7 to May 4, Singaporeans are to leave their homes only for essential activities such as buying food and groceries.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Friday appealed to older Singaporeans to stay at home for their own safety during the &ldquo;circuit breaker&rdquo; period.</p>
<p>The country on Saturday confirmed its eighth death due to complications from the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>Case 1142, a 90-year-old Singaporean man, died from complications due to COVID-19 infection on Saturday morning.</p>
