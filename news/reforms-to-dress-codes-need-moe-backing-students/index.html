Reforms to dress codes need MOE backing: students</p>
<p>By Sherry Hsiao / Staff reporter</p>
<p>More than 2,300 students have signed a petition urging the Ministry of Education (MOE) to ensure that schools do not penalize students for dress code violations, as the ministry prepares new guidelines, organizers said yesterday.</p>
<p>The petition was launched on Wednesday by the Taichung Child and Youth Representative, the KH Student Union and the National Students’ Rights Seminar in Taiwan, and has been backed by more than a dozen groups, including the Taiwan Youth Association for Democracy, the Humanistic Education Foundation and the Taiwan Alliance for Advancement of Youth Rights and Welfare.</p>
<p>“On President Tsai Ing-wen’s (蔡英文) first day in office in 2016, the Ministry of Education held a news conference to say that schools cannot use attire as reason to penalize students,” the organizers said.</p>

<p>“However, over the past four years, most schools have still applied ‘roundabout penalties’ for dress code violations by assigning community service or campus service or by other means,” they said.</p>
<p>The ministry last week proposed new guidelines that, if approved, would no longer allow schools to assign “public service” to students who break the dress code, the groups said.</p>
<p>The draft also states that at least one-third of dress code committee members at senior-high schools should be students and calls for schools to review their dress code policies every three years, they said.</p>
<p>The groups said that they hope the ministry could ensure that if the new guidelines are passed, schools will actually follow them.</p>
<p>The petition has five demands: immediate implementation of the new guidelines; clear indication of which alternative measures schools can take if the code is contravened; supervision of schools following the guidelines’ implementation; assurance that student representatives have real influence over dress-code policy decisions; and the inclusion of student opinions in the formation of dress policies at the elementary-school level.</p>
<p>A dozen lawmakers — including Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Fan Yun (范雲), Taiwan People’s Party Legislator Lai Hsiang-ling (賴香伶), New Power Party Legislator Chiu Hsien-chih (邱顯智) and independent Legislator Freddy Lim (林昶佐) — have signed the petition, organizers said.</p>
<p>Students and group representatives yesterday gathered outside the Affiliated Senior High School of National Taiwan Normal University in Taipei before the ministry’s K-12 Education Administration was scheduled to hold a meeting to explain the proposed guidelines to students.</p>
<p>The dress code policy is a human rights issue, Taichung Second Senior High School Student Association president Yeh Tsung-yi (葉宗益) said, urging officials to “give students back the rights they deserve.”</p>
<p>Several schools have recently adopted distance learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic, said Fan, who was there in support of the students.</p>
<p>The lack of a dress code for distance learning shows that it has “nothing to do with learning outcomes,” she said.

<h3 id="right-time-to-close-schools-now-says-education-minister-ong-ye-kung">&lsquo;Right time&rsquo; to close schools now, says Education Minister Ong Ye Kung</h3>
<p><img src="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12606732/16x9/991/557/9ebfef332ddbe5510542665a62359c36/Jg/ong-ye-kung-apr-3-covid-19.jpg" alt="img">
SINGAPORE: School will be suspended for about a month from next Wednesday (Apr 8) as Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced on Friday stricter measures to curb the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Students across all levels, from primary school to universities, including those in special education schools, will shift to full home-based learning until May 4, the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) said in a joint press release.</p>

<p>All pre-schools, kindergartens and student care centres will also be closed, but will provide limited services for children of parents who have to work and cannot find caregivers.</p>
<p>Education Minister Ong Ye Kung said that everyone should try to stay home but schools will remain open for parents who are unable to stay home to look after their children. These include parents in essential services, such as healthcare workers, and those from vulnerable families.</p>
<p>“We do expect a fair number of children from more vulnerable families having to come to school, so I think (we can) take this opportunity, mobilise resources we have, let’s see what we can do to especially help this group of children,” he said.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Classes are currently set to resume on May 5, but MOE and MSF will continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 situation to assess if these measures need to be prolonged.</p>
<p>School-based mid-year examinations will be cancelled, said MOE.</p>
<p>National examinations will proceed as planned and with the necessary precautionary measures in place. These include the mid-year GCE O- and A-Level Mother Tongue Language examinations in June, year-end examinations and Primary School Leaving Examinations.</p>
<p>Mr Ong said that while he had received many requests from parents to close schools earlier, it is now time to do so and &ldquo;for the right reasons&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we are implementing a national circuit breaker policy and schools are an important part of it. It will help us move towards a position where we can enhance safe distancing, cut down on social interactions significantly and reduce transmissions,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>TRIAL TO PREPARE SCHOOLS FOR HOME-BASED LEARNING</p>
<p>Schools had tried out home-based learning in a staggered fashion this week, which has prepared students and teachers for the coming full implementation, the ministries added.</p>
<p>That process helped to solve many teething problems, said Mr Ong.</p>
<p>MOE loaned out nearly 4,000 digital devices to those who did not have them, and parents who had to work could still send their children to school, where they have proper supervision and safe distancing, he said.</p>
<p>After the trial, MOE is also confident that the curriculum can be covered and there is no need to &ldquo;claw back&rdquo; from the June holidays, he said.</p>
<p>Schools will continue to provide instructions and support for students to access a range of both online and hard copy home-based learning materials, so that learning continues uninterrupted.</p>
<p>Students can rely on the ongoing support of their teachers and other school personnel who will continue to work from home or from school, said authorities.</p>
<p>Mr Ong stressed that learning from home can be similar to going to school, and teachers will log on and take attendance online.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can even have a flag-raising ceremony and say the pledge, then go through the assignments&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>INSTITUTES OF HIGHER LEARNING</p>
<p>In recent months, institutes of higher learning have moved to online learning and stepped up safe distancing measures on their campuses.</p>
<p>Autonomous universities will go &ldquo;100 per cent online&rdquo; including for exams, said Mr Ong, adding that some universities have decided to defer credits to take the pressure off their students.</p>
<p>For new students starting at polytechnics and Institutes of Technical Education soon, they will need to go to campus to get themselves registered for online learning. They are to go to school in small groups, he said.</p>
<p>Having a lot of online learning is &ldquo;far from ideal&rdquo;, but he encouraged students to use the time at home to read widely and explore areas they are interested in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to learn outside of the syllabus, read widely &hellip; find what subjects, what areas you&rsquo;re passionate about,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So, stay safe, stay home, stay curious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PRE-SCHOOLS TO SERVE PARENTS IN ESSENTIAL SERVICES</p>
<p>Pre-schools will stay open only to serve parents in essential services, and who cannot find alternative caregivers for their children, said authorities.</p>
<p>Parents should try to keep their children at home during this period, said Minister for Social and Family Development Desmond Lee.</p>
<p>Priority will be given to healthcare workers, children of low-wage or daily wage workers, as well as children from vulnerable families with no support. Parents should contact their children’s schools for help, he said.</p>
<p>Many pre-schools have home-based learning resources to support parents and the Early Childhood Development Agency is consolidating them to a single website, he said, adding that the link will be shared next week.</p>
<p>The minimum attendance requirements for pre-school and student care subsidies will also be waived in April.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All subsidies for pre-school and student care will continue to be disbursed during this period,&rdquo; said Mr Lee.</p>
<p>Private education institutions should move to home-based learning or suspend classes, said authorities. ​​​​​​​</p>
<p>STRICTER MEASURES</p>
<p>Mr Lee announced earlier on Friday that workplaces, except for essential services and key economic sectors, will close from next Tuesday. He urged everyone to stay at home as much as possible.</p>
<p>People should go out only to do essential things such as to buy food or to exercise at the park, while keeping a safe distance from others, he said.</p>
<p>These measures are being rolled out after more local cases of COVID-19 were detected in Singapore last week, with about half of the cases unlinked.</p>
<p>Globally, the number of coronavirus cases has soared above 1 million and reported deaths have exceeded 50,000.</p>

<h3 id="moe-urged-to-extend-academic-year">MoE urged to extend academic year</h3>
<p><img src="https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/02TR008A1-1.jpg" alt="img">
It is important for the govt to consider how classes should resume post-MCO</p>
<p>by S BIRRUNTHA/ pic by MUHD AMIN NAHARUL</p>
<p>THE Education Ministry (MoE) is urged to consider extending this year’s academic calendar for both schools and higher learning institutions due to the Movement Control Order (MCO).</p>
<p>Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs social policy research manager Wan Ya Shin said public school students are three weeks behind in their lessons and not all have access to digital learning.</p>
<p>“This reflects the issue of a digital divide in our nation — the divide between the urban and rural, as well as socio-economic status.</p>
<p>“The MoE has provided a digital learning platform, but the problem is that not every student has access to the Internet or has a device to access the digital platform,” she told The Malaysian Reserve yesterday.</p>
<p>Wan stressed that a digital learning platform is a good alternative to a physical classroom, however, it is important for the authorities to ensure that everyone has access to the platform.</p>
<p>“The digital divide also exists among students in higher education institutions. Although anecdotal evidence would suggest that most of the students in higher education have access to a mobile phone or laptop, this might not be the case for all.</p>
<p>“Therefore, it would be good for the MoE to consider the possibility of extending the academic calendar year, if not this would leave the underprivileged at a disadvantage,” she added.</p>
<p>Wan also said it is important for the government to consider how classes should resume post-MCO, as social distancing would still be necessary to avoid the risk of students being infected.</p>
<p>She added that if the government decides to extend the academic year, a plan is needed on how to mitigate the risks students might face in the classroom.</p>
<p>“Besides that, hygiene and sanitisation in schools need to be increased to ensure that our children are protected,” she said.</p>
<p>Previously, The Higher Education Ministry said all institutions of higher education must begin the second semester for the current academic year between April 27 and June 1.</p>
<p>The decision was made following the extension of the MCO to April 14.</p>
<p>“With the MCO extension, the first semester of the 2020/2021 academic year is expected to begin in mid-October 2020,” the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, private learning institutions are given the freedom to choose their own commencement dates based on their academic calendars.</p>
<p>MoE has also announced that major examinations such as Form Three Assessment (PT3), Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) and Sijil Tinggi Pelajaran Malaysia (STPM) have been rescheduled following the extension of the MCO.</p>
<p>The ministry said in a statement that the decision was made after reviewing the current situation and ensuring that all curriculum subjects were completed within the timeframe.</p>
<p>With that, PT3 which is scheduled to begin on Sept 28 to Oct 6, will have its Bahasa Melayu and English papers moved to Sept 28 and Sept 29 this year.</p>
<p>The SPM written exams scheduled from Oct 5 to Oct 14 (Phase One) and Nov 2 to Nov 19 (Phase Two) have been moved to Nov 16 until Dec 7.</p>
<p>For STPM, its second semester exams have been moved from the original date of May 6, 12, 13 and 14 to Nov 18, 19, 23 and 24. The third semester exam will remain on Nov 3,4,5,9and10.</p>
<p>However, the examination dates for Ujian Penilaian Sekolah Rendah, Sijil Tinggi Agama Malaysia and SPM repeat papers are retained.
