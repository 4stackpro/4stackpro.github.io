<p>Sushant Singh Rajput was widely praised for his performance in MS Dhoni&rsquo;s biopic. | Photo Credit: BCCL</p>
<p>Key Highlights Sushant Singh Rajput portrayed the role of MS Dhoni in his biopic &lsquo;MS Dhoni: The Untold Story&rsquo; At the trailer launch of the movie, Dhoni recalled how Sushant kept asking too many questions to know him better Dhoni had praised Sushant&rsquo;s work as he didn&rsquo;t get much time to spend with him</p>
<p>Given the craze of Bollywood and cricket in India, when the two merge, one can only expect a huge success. The producers have shown a special interest in biopics of cricketers and other sportspersons over the years. Sushant Singh Rajput, the late Bollywood actor, had massive shoes to fill as he was signed to portray the role of Mahendra Singh Dhoni in his biopic ‘MS Dhoni: The Untold Story’.</p>
<p>Given Dhoni’s fan following, Sushant had a huge responsibility on his shoulders. But he did complete justice to the role as he toiled hard for 10 months under the watchful eyes of former Indian wicket-keeper Kiran More – who helped Sushant get a taste of what it would be like to train like Dhoni. While Sushant did not spend much time with Dhoni, he got hold of the Ranchi superstar’s mannerisms by watching his videos.</p>
<p>At the trailer launch of the movie, Dhoni was asked whether there was pressure on him since a movie on him was being released. In his reply, Dhoni said there was more pressure on Sushant and lauded the actor for doing an excellent job despite not getting much time to spend with him.</p>
<p>“It was more difficult for him because he has to convince the public about what he was feeling inside while playing my role. For this, he asked a lot of questions from me like - how did you feel at that time, how do you feel now? I told him – yaar tum sawaal he poochhte rehte ho (you keep asking questions), Dhoni said.</p>
<p>Dhoni also praised Sushant for learning all the cricket shots, especially his trademark ‘helicopter shot’ which he said looked like a replica in the movie.</p>
<p>“In reality, we spent a lot less time together. But the kind of effort he has put in the film because one of the essential parts was cricket. Of course, all of us play cricket but when you have to show it on screen, you have to learn certain things, especially cricket shots. He has hit the helicopter shot in the movie and it’s exactly like a replica. So Sushant has put a lot of effort,” Dhoni added.</p>
<p>At the same event, when asked whether there was pressure to play Dhoni’s character in the film, Sushant said, “In the year 2006-07, after a lot of difficulties, I and my family were able to meet MS Dhoni. I also clicked a photo with him and my family. He is one of the very few persons I have enormous respect for. I look up to him so to get an opportunity to get to know his inside story, up close and personal, gave me a lot of excitement, not pressure. Very honestly, there are films in your career which you do with full honesty and you end up being a good actor but there are very rare films that you do and end up becoming a good human being.”</p>
<p>The cricket, as well as the Bollywood fraternity, was left in a state of shock as Sushant committed suicide at his Mumbai residence on Monday. Just 34, Sushant was one of the most talented actors in the industry with several superhit films to his name.

<p>In Photos: From Maanav in Pavitra Rishta to Annirudh in Chhichhore, roles that defined Sushant Singh Rajput 1 12 Tracing Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s life in films Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s tryst with the camera began with a chance sighting. Ekta Kapoor&rsquo;s casting team spotted him in a play by Nadira Babbar&rsquo;s theatre company and invited him to audition for a show. It set the ball rolling on the then-aspiring hero&rsquo;s career. A look: Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil (2008) Sushant made his television debut as Preet Juneja on this show. The character was killed early on, but was brought back as a spirit for the series finale, owing to his popularity. Pavitra Rishta (2009) The next year, he landed the lead role of Manav Deshmukh in the hit show, widely considered to be his breakout role and a stepping stone to films. While working on this Ekta Kapoor production, he also met his future girlfriend, Ankita Lokhande, who played the female lead. Kai Po Che! (2013) After participating in two dance-based reality shows— Zara Nachke Dikha 2 and Jhalak Dikhhla Ja 4—Sushant auditioned for this Abhishek Kapoor directorial, and bagged one of the three lead roles alongside Rajkummar Rao and Amit Sadh. His portrayal of former district-level cricketer Ishaan Bhatt, who falls prey to politics in the selection process, in the critical and commercial success earned him raves. Shuddh Desi Romance (2013) Sushant followed it up with this Maneesh Sharma-directed Parineeti Chopra and Vaani Kapoor co-starrer. The romance comedy-drama was set in Jaipur and revolved around youngsters’ take on love and live-in relationships. PK (2014) In Rajkumar Hirani’s satirical comedy-drama led by Aamir Khan and Anushka Sharma, Sushant had a brief yet notable role. Detective Byomkesh Bakshy (2015) Dibakar Banerjee’s mystery thriller featured the actor in the titular role, a character created by Bengali writer Sharanindu Bandopadhyay. Set in the Kolkata of the 1940s, the film was reportedly to get a sequel with Sushant reprising his role. MS Dhoni: The Untold Story (2016) Neeraj Pandey’s biographical drama that traces the journey of the eponymous former Indian skipper-wicket keeper saw Sushant take on another titular role. The film, which also featured Kiara Advani and Disha Patani, secured for Sushant his first Filmfare Best Actor nomination the following year. Raabta (2017) In Dinesh Vijan’s directorial debut, a reincarnation-themed romance actioner, Sushant was paired opposite Kriti Sanon and the duo played star-crossed lovers. The film featured Jim Sarbh, Rajkumar Yadav and Varun Dharma in supporting roles. Kedarnath (2018) The actor reunited with Abhishek ‘Gattu’ Kapoor to headline Sara Ali Khan’s launch vehicle. The inter-faith love story was set against the backdrop of the pilgrim site and revolved around a Muslim boy who falls in love with a rich Brahmin girl. Sonchiriya (2019) Co-written and directed by Abhishek Chaubey, the film is set in the Chambal ravines of 1975 and tells the story of a group of dacoits. It also featured Manoj Bajpayee, Bhumi Pednekar, Ranvir Shorey and Ashutosh Rana. Chhichhore (2019) Sushant followed it up with one of the biggest successes of his career with this Nitesh Tiwari-directed campus comedy-drama. The film won five Filmfare nods, including Best Film and Best Director. It was also Sushant’s last theatrical release.</p>
<p>A disarming smile when he would get smacked in the face by the hard, leather ball. An actor who had a parallel world of books, which seemed to give him immense peace of mind. And if more release was needed, he would turn to his cars. He had quite a few of them — the Maserati Quattroporte was his favourite. That’s the Sushant I knew, the one whose cricketing skills I had to sharpen for the movie, ‘MS Dhoni: The Untold Story’.Before I started preparing him for the role of Dhoni — we trained together for nine months — I had warned him that discipline would be non-negotiable. Discipline is an overworked word in sport, but without Sushant’s unwavering focus, he couldn’t have done justice to Dhoni’s character.I was clear that he would have to report on time for practice and carry his own kit. I had him agree to another condition — he would have no spot boys and security guards at nets.We would practise at the Chandrakant Pandit Coaching Clinic in, daily from 7 to 9 am.Facing the leather ball was never going to be easy for someone who had been brought up on tennis-ball. Training him in wicketkeeping was more challenging. Even someone as prodigiously talented as Sachin Tendulkar might not be comfortable if abruptly asked to do the job behind the stumps.So we eased him into wicketkeeping drills. First, we made him do basic catching drills with the tennis ball before making him wear the keeper’s pads and polish the art of neat collections.He would be hit frequently on the fingers, chest, face and legs, but not once did he whine.If you watched the movie, he was slimmer as young Dhoni and had to look heavier later. Sushant managed to achieve both. He had to sweat buckets to raise his fitness levels. Everybody knows Dhoni has naturally-built strong thighs. To get Sushant’s legs to that level, we engaged Rajesh Sawant, the then U-19 fitness trainer who passed away three years ago.I was witness to Sushant’s complete transformation as a cricketer. Like we did with his wicketkeeping, we tried making him comfortable with the bat. We started giving him throwdowns before unleashing fast bowlers at him.The batting drills became progressively tougher. We made him bat on uncovered wickets with unpredictable bounce. Once a delivery cut through the grill of his visor leaving him with a bloodied nose.Each day, he would joyously give me a count of his bruises, but he never stopped training.It took him roughly three months of rigorous practice — sometimes against the bowling machine — to execute the helicopter shot, considered the toughest in the sport. It was surprising, for I hadn’t seen many cricketers look comfortable playing it. I remember a shoot in Jamshedpur where he was demonstrating the helicopter shot – it was as though he had been practising it all his life.Once we were training at’s Bandra-Kurla Complex indoor facility. Sachin had accompanied his son Arjun for a net session. Sushant was batting at the adjacent net. Sachin was curious to know who this man was. Sachin was stunned when he learned he was Sushant. “He’s batting like an accomplished batsman,” he beamed., the former India pacer who was also around, told me: “Man, you’ve turned him into a cricketer.” I can’t express in words how nice I felt that day.As his stint with me was coming to an end, I could see another makeover in him. The way Sushant would communicate with people, carry his kit, wear his pads and gloves…he had gotten into the skin of Dhoni’s character. The actor had become a cricketer.I may have worked on fine details like changing his stance and his grip, but in nine months Sushant had become Dhoni in flesh. Spending considerable amount of time with Dhoni had its wondrous effects too.I can’t believe such a warm person — that’s the Sushant that will stay with me — has left us so abruptly. To say I’m shocked is not the word.

<p>Updated: Jun 14, 2020 22:29 IST</p>
<p>M S Dhoni’s close friend and co-producer of his biopic, Arun Pandey, on Sunday recalled the unforgettable moments they both spent with Sushant Singh Rajput when the lead actor constantly battled the “enormous pressure” of replicating the iconic cricketer’s magic on the big screen.</p>
<p>While it is almost impossible to gauge what goes in the mind of enigma that Dhoni is, Sushant left no stone unturned to do justice to his character.</p>
<p>Whether it was spending nine months with former India wicket-keeper Kiran More to learn the tricks of trade or tirelessly trying Dhoni’s trademark helicopter, Sushant gave his all and in the end, his on-screen performance was well accepted by the Indian captain’s legion of fans.</p>

<p>“He was very concerned during the making of the movie about whether he would be able to live Dhoni’s life on the big screen. He was under a lot pressure before the movie release (in 2016),” Pandey told PTI.</p>
<p>“He use to say it often to me that ‘I hope I am able to deliver, else Mahi’s millions of fans will not forgive me ever’. But the hard worker that he was, I was sure that he would a fine job and he did,” Pandey, who is yet to come to terms with Sushant’s shocking death, said.</p>
<p>Sushant spent months with the cult cricketer to prep up for his role and Pandey said the actor’s penchant for detail helped him immensely in playing Dhoni in reel life.</p>
<p>“One day he was practising the helicopter shot and he suffered a strain. We thought he would take some rest and comeback after a while but he said “there should not be delay because of me” and was back practising that shot in a week’s time,” recalled Pandey.</p>

<p>Such was his dedication that by the end of the movie shoot, Sushant became more than a decent cricketer, something Dhoni also acknowledged.</p>
<p>“He used to ask a lot of questions to Mahi, the little things that make the difference. The fact they both had a Bihar connection also helped them develop a bond,” said Pandey.</p>
<p>Pandey would never forget the time when he and Dhoni relived their cricketing days through Sushant. Dhoni, who used to play for Air India, stayed in Delhi for a significant period.</p>
<p>“I always cherish the time when Mahi and I took Sushant to his Air India Colony house in Delhi. He went with us as Mahi recollected his old days and things like where he used to sit and eat, Sushant would do the same to feel the character.</p>
<p>“There was a spot in the house where Mahi used to lie down on the ground and Sushant did that too. He always felt very lucky to be playing Dhoni’s character.”</p>
<p>Now that he is gone too soon, Pandey said the slight possibility of a sequel to Dhoni’s biopic goes out of the window.</p>
<p>“There were no plans for a sequel and with him not being us, I don’t think it is even a possibility. The news of him passing away is unbelievable.</p>
<p>“I never expected him to do something like this, he was so full of life. Before the lockdwon, we had a gym session together and we were in regular touch.</p>
<p>“But this can happen with anyone and just shows that why it is very important to not lose your old self when you reach the top,” added Pandey.

Kiara’s role in Dhoni’s movie started when the former was working as an intern at a hotel. It was there where Sushant met her for the first time and Kiara asked him for his Identity Card.</p>
<p>From there on, their relationship flourished and eventually they tied the knots in the movie. The movie ends with Dhoni’s six off Nuwan Kulasekara to win India the World Cup after 28 years. As far as the real Dhoni is concerned, he has been happily married for nearly a decade and has a daughter in Ziva, who was born in 2015 before India’s campaign in the World Cup.

<p>Actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death should be investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Jan Adhikar Party chief Pappu Yadav demanded on Monday.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput, who dropped out of an engineering college to pursue a career in Bollywood and delivered several hit films over the past decade, was found dead in his apartment in Mumbai on Sunday. He was 34.</p>
<p>Dattatreya Bargude, an assistant commissioner of Mumbai Police, confirmed the actor’s death and said that no “note” was found at his residence.</p>
<p>“I cannot imagine how this happened. I request the government to launch a CBI inquiry. I think there is a deep conspiracy behind his death. Sushant cannot commit suicide,” Pappu Yadav told reporters.</p>
<p>“I want a CBI inquiry in the matter. Sushant was a workaholic and good man, not the kind of person that would commit suicide. He rose from the bottom. Made Bihar proud. Now the state of Bihar is in mourning,” he added.</p>
<p>Yadav also claimed that it could be a case of homicide.</p>
<p>Rajput was born in Bihar’s capital of Patna and was the youngest of five children of a government employee. He completed his schooling in Delhi before securing a seat in an engineering college in the Capital in 2003.</p>
<p>He dropped out of the course to pursue acting professionally three years later and joined the Barry John Acting School.</p>
<p>The actor landed his first role in the Hindi serial, Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil, in 2008 but gained popularity the next year with his character in the popular soap, Pavitra Rishta.</p>
<p>He debuted in Bollywood in 2013 with the movie Kai Po Che!, adapted from a novel by Chetan Bhagat but became a household name with the success of MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, a biopic on the World Cup-winning Indian cricket captain, in 2016.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput was last seen in Nitesh Tiwari’s Chhichhore in 2019 and also acted in the thriller Drive that was released on Netflix the same year.</p>

Dhoni or Kohli: Who&rsquo;s more hot for b&rsquo;day girl Disha Patani? | Courtesy: dishapatani | virat.kohli | Photo Credit: Instagram</p>
<p>Key Highlights Disha Patani rose to stardom from her movie MS Dhoni: The Untold Story In one of the interviews for the movie, Disha gave Dhoni a Perfect 10 on hotness quotient In the same interview, Disha picked Virat Kohli the Indian cricketer for &lsquo;Perfect Date&rsquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the birthday of Bollywood actress Disha Patani – one of the most followed entertainment celebrities at present – who turns 28 years old on June 13. Over the years, Disha has done many movies which have earned her the stardom she enjoys today, but she truly rose the through ranks after her movie MS Dhoni: The Untold Story came out in 2016 with Sushant Singh Rajput. While the movie is based on the real-life of former India captain MS Dhoni, in one of the interviews, Disha proved how much of a fan she is of the Jharkhand-born wicket-keeper batsman.</p>
<p>In an interview for Bollywood Hangama for the promotion of the movie, Disha rated some of the Indian cricketers on the basis of their &lsquo;Hotness Quotient&rsquo;. The names of Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni, Yuvraj Singh, Rohit Sharma, Ravindra Jadeja opped up, and there was a clear winner for the actress.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how the ratings went:</p>
<p>Virat Kohli: 9</p>
<p>MS Dhoni: 10</p>
<p>Yuvraj Singh: 8</p>
<p>Rohit Sharma: 8</p>
<p>Ravindra Jadeja: 8</p>
<p>In the same interview, when a question over &lsquo;perfect date&rsquo; came up, Disha was quick to pick the current India captain Virat Kohli.</p>
<p>When Jasprit Bumrah bowled over Disha Patani:</p>
<p>Disha is surely a big cricket fan. In another one of her interviews, she picked the &lsquo;biggest match-winner&rsquo; in Indian cricket and in doing so, she went on to snub the superstars Dhoni and Kohli. To the surprise of many, the player that had bowled over the famous actress was India&rsquo;s &lsquo;Yorker King&rsquo; Jasprit Bumrah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had to pick a matchwinning player, it would be Jasprit Bumrah. He is one of the finest players we have. It will be a proud moment for all of us on February 2, while Bumrah takes down the Kiwis,&rdquo; Dish had said in a promotional interview for her movie Malang.</p>
<p>Malang was, in fact, the last movie that Disha featured in. She does have a couple of new projects in the form of Ek Villain 2 and Radhe but the proceedings for those movies have been halted due to the Coronavirus pandemic. In these times of lockdown, Disha has been a regular on social media, sometimes posting her workout videos and sometimes just candid pictures.
