<p>Opinion: Behind the ridicule of golf being deemed an &lsquo;essential service&rsquo; is the assumption that it poses a great risk of community spread of COVID-19. It doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>A golfer pushes her clubs while playing at the Dobson Ranch Golf Club in Mesa on April 1, 2020. Gov. Ducey&rsquo;s &ldquo;stay at home&rdquo; order to slow the spread of COVID-19 classify some businesses like golf courses as &ldquo;essential&rdquo; during the coronavirus pandemic. (Photo: Michael Chow/The Republic)</p>
<p>In the fight against the spread of the novel coronavirus, there are plenty of villains — people who have symptoms but still choose to go out and reckless individuals who congregate in big crowds come to mind.</p>
<p>I don’t count golfers, or the golf courses that cater to them, among them.</p>
<p>Yet many Arizonans apparently do. Granted, most of the vilification is in the form of ridicule — as in, how is golf considered an “essential activity” that’s allowed to continue amid the pandemic? We’ll circle back to that question in a minute.</p>
<p>But behind the disdain is the underlying assumption that golf poses as much a risk of COVID-19 community spread as bars, dine-in restaurants and other businesses that have been forced to shutter.</p>
<p>It doesn’t.</p>
<p>Golf can be played with social distancing</p>
<p>Not when you consider that in general, no more than a foursome plays at any one hole and players are just about always practicing physical distancing, except when they await their turn to tee off. There’s little, if any, sharing of equipment during play.</p>
<p>About the only interaction players have outside the group may be with a beverage-cart operator (that has been largely suspended). Or a player from an adjoining hole who hit a wayward shot.</p>
<p>Looking for the other side of the story? Subscribe today for access to even more opinions.</p>
<p>Most, if not all, golf courses that remain open have taken steps to ensure safe play, from limiting players’ contact with employees — requiring pre-payment by credit card, for instance — to aggressively sanitize golf carts and rental clubs.</p>
<p>Many courses have halted the practice of shared carts; some make exceptions for spouses and other family members. Anecdotally, more golfers are heeding the encouragement to haul their clubs using hand-pulled carts — in essence, walk the course.</p>
<p>Operations such as Papago in Phoenix and Ocotillo in Chandler have removed rakes (used to smooth sand traps after play). Many have even taken away golf ball washers. Courses, public or private, now require or encourage players to keep the flagstick in the cup rather than removing it to putt. Many have installed foam to prevent balls from touching the cup to prevent contamination.</p>
<p>And with the forced closure of dine-in food or drink service, the customary &ldquo;19th hole&rdquo; celebration in the clubhouse is on pause.</p>
<p>Is golf essential? Yes, in some ways</p>
<p>Golf is not less essential than going for a walk along a green belt in your neighborhood, which is permitted. (Photo: Thomas Hawthorne/The Republic)</p>
<p>Critics contend that golf is a nonessential need and unworthy of continue operation. Further muddying the assessment was the lumping of golf courses with hair salons and manicure shops by Gov. Doug Ducey&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>It’s an understandable debate, although it must be noted that hair and nail salons pose far more of a health risk — not just to the willing customer but also to hesitant workers who may have no good choice in the matter — given that social distancing is next to impossible. Golf is no fair comparison. (Ducey has since redefined hair and nail salons as nonessential services that must close shop.)</p>
<p>Is golf an essential activity? It’s certainly no less essential than recreation, going for a walk along a green belt in the neighborhood or taking your family to the park, all of which remains permitted.</p>
<p>If the idea is to make accommodations for activities to maintain physical and mental well-being — without endangering the general public — then, yes, golf is essential.</p>
<p>Golfers should continue to hit the greens</p>
<p>I’ve played golf on occasion in some charitable events or with friends, but I&rsquo;m hardly one with stakes in the game. If anything, I find the description of golf as “a good walk spoiled” both amusing and apt.</p>
<p>And if there’s demonstration that hitting the greens correlates to community spread of COVID-19, we shouldn’t hesitate to shut down courses, every last one of them.</p>
<p>Till then, golfers deserve a mulligan. Let them to play through.</p>

Opinion: Seen And Remembered: Our Essential Workers</p>

<p>Nurses, doctors, paramedics, technicians and other hospital workers earn the gratitude of the world right now. They risk their lives for others — what genuine heroes do.</p>
<p>But, there are many other people we might overlook who are also essential in these extraordinary times.</p>
<p>I took a run the other morning. It was still and quiet, but I was surprised to see how many people were up, about, and still working in a city in which &ldquo;nonessential workers&rdquo; have been told to stay at home.</p>
<p>I saw bus drivers and taxi drivers, who may have taken some of those hospital workers to their 14-hour shifts, along with stock workers and cashiers who work in stores, so we can still buy food, milk, bread and coffee. I saw truck drivers steering rigs with pictures of fruits, vegetables and meats painted on their sides. Long trucks pulled up at pharmacies to bring in medicines, soap and candy. Delivery service vans, their drivers balancing boxes in their arms.</p>

<p>I passed a few stores that weren&rsquo;t shuttered, and saw bakers and cooks in the windows, rolling out pizza or pita dough, slicing sandwiches and stirring soups to be picked up or delivered to people who have been stuck inside, and may feel anxious, edgy and hungry.</p>
<p>I saw security guards on patrol in front of office buildings and theaters, and maintenance workers, wearing dark green, gray and blue informs, often with their names sewn over their hearts, in masks and gloves in front of buildings, ready to unplug toilets and unstick elevators. I saw sanitation workers, in dark blue uniforms, roll out trash bins to lift them into the backs of trash trucks. I waved at the people at work in convenience stores and, yes, the liquor shop. I saw police officers on the street, and construction workers, in boots, masks and gloves, still digging into those streets to keep the city&rsquo;s power and plumbing running. I heard a rumble from under a grate along the street from the subway, and thought about people riding those trains to many of the jobs I&rsquo;d just seen.</p>
<p>Essential workers are all around us, including those people who have disinfected the very studio I&rsquo;m in today, and the remarkable engineering crew on the other side of the control room glass.</p>
<p>These days, we are surrounded by essential, extraordinary people.

COMIC: Grocery Workers Are Essential, And Feeling The Strain</p>
<p>Enlarge this image Sarah Mirk for NPR Sarah Mirk for NPR</p>
<p>From produce clerks to personal shoppers to warehouse stockers, millions of grocery workers across the U.S. are keeping food on the shelves throughout this pandemic for those of us hunkering at home. Their work is essential — needed and valued — and yet, many say they don&rsquo;t feel safe.</p>
<p>Just this week, workers at Amazon and Instacart demanded better protections, including paid sick leave and ready access to personal protective supplies, such as hand sanitizer and wipes.</p>
<p>Visual journalist Sarah Mirk checked in with a sampling of grocery workers from across the nation to hear more about their experiences on the job in recent weeks and what they say needs to change.</p>
