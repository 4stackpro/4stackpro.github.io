Popular TV presenter and actress Dineo Langa (nee Moeketsi) has been dumped from The Queen, allegedly after asking for a three-month break to shoot a movie. The actress, who has been with the Mzansi Magic soapie since its inception four years ago, was allegedly sent a letter by Ferguson Films informing her that she should not bother to report for duty after the lockdown. “She is distraught. She thought the Fergusons are family.</p>
<p>More than just the loss of her job, she feels a sense of betrayal because when she asked for the time off, they agreed. Then, boom, the letter of severance arrived during the lockdown,” said a well-placed source. The Queen is owned and produced by veteran actors Connie Ferguson and her husband Shona. According to sources close to the production, Cindy Mahlangu, who plays the character of Siyanda, and Zenande Mfenyane, who plays Goodness Mabuza, are also on their way out for various reasons. But insiders said it was Langa’s exit that was going to ruffle feathers because she was leaving under controversial circumstances.</p>
<p>The Queen’s show runner, Lauren Nell, confirmed that Langa was released to shoot a movie. Nell said that scripts had to be rewritten to accommodate her request. “She was scheduled to return in April, but due to the lockdown everything has changed. All cast and crew contracts end at the end of May,” she said in an SMS response. But sources close to the production said the producers changed their mind after giving Langa the green light to shoot her movie, and they instead ordered her not to come back after the lockdown.</p>
<p>T hey said Langa interpreted the letter to mean that she was no longer part of the soapie as a result of the three m o n t h break she was granted. “How do you do that to an actress who simply wanted to expand her portfolio with a role in a movie? What should other actors do when offered roles? “Do you see what this is? “The Fergusons go up and down in their expensive cars – and we wish them well – but why can’t an actor succeed outside their fold? I don’t understand this,” said another source.</p>
<p>In a leaked letter last week, the Fergusons asked actors if they could work for free as part of their response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Nell said Mfenyane was shooting with The Queen before lockdown, but had decided to take some time off work until further notice “due to personal reasons”. Sunday World reported last month that Mfenyane was on her way out because she was allegedly pregnant.</p>
<p>The actress denied the pregnancy and that she was leaving the soapie. About Mahlangu’s future at the Mzansi Magic soapie, Nell said: “The character of Siyanda comes in and out to serve specific story arcs. She was still shooting with The Queen before lockdown, and will return to complete her arc.” However, Nell could not confirm that all the three actors will be part of the soapie’s new season, which is to be confirmed after contract negotiations between the Fergusons and MultiChoice. The mass exodus at The Queen started with the exit of Rami Chuene, who played the popular character of Gracious “T-Gom” Mabuza.

The Queen star joined her hubby Solo for a freestyle session this week and showed she&rsquo;s got proper pipes for the people!</p>
<p>In the session, posted to Solo&rsquo;s Instagram page on Thursday, Dineo laid down a verse for Solo to kick off from and then shut it all down with a powerful performance at the end.</p>
<p>“I just want to know. Don&rsquo;t you sugar coat. Say it all if you want. Could you tell it like it is. Pretty little fears. Music to my ears,” she sang, really getting into it.</p>
<p>Solo was also feeling it, calling the freestyle “dope”.</p>
<p>When it was all done, the couple encouraged all their followers to stay indoors and wash their hands.

The Queen’s reign as DStv’s highest-rated soapie could be over.</p>
<p>Connie Ferguson, who runs Ferguson Films with her husband, Shona, told the Sunday Times: “We will not be able to deliver that content by the end of May. There’s so much going on behind the scenes. We are thinking about how we’re going to survive as a company, but not only that, we are thinking how are we going to help our people.”</p>
<p>Last week Ferguson Films sent cast and crew of the drama series a memo outlining measures the company would take in view of the extension of the national lockdown.</p>
<p>The Fergusons had planned to extend filming by four weeks to complete the fourth season. However, the contracts of the cast and crew expire at the end of May and with the uncertainty, no renewals can be done.</p>
<p>Dineo Langa, who plays Kea in The Queen, said even though she had additional income from voiceover work she’d still feel the pinch if there was a salary cut.</p>
<p>“It’s bittersweet — you understand that it’s imperative but at the same time everything you’re committed to financially looks you in the face with a very grim look.”</p>
<p>Shona, who is executive producer, said staff would receive their full salaries for April, and there were ongoing discussions with Mzansi Magic.
