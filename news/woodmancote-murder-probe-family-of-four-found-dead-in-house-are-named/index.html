<p>Four members of a family found dead at a house in West Sussex have been named by police.</p>
<p>The bodies of Kelly Fitzgibbons, 40, and Robert Needham, 42, were found alongside their children Ava Needham, four, and two-year-old Lexi Needham.</p>
<p>A murder investigation began after police were called to Duffield Lane in Woodmancote near Chichester on Sunday.</p>
<p>Detectives are &ldquo;not seeking anyone else in connection with the matter&rdquo; and described it as an &ldquo;isolated incident&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A post-mortem examination has not yet taken place and police have not commented on the nature of their deaths.</p>
<p>The body of a pet dog was also found at the house, police said.</p>

<p>Local resident and district councillor Roy Briscoe said he lived in the same lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were a young couple, with two young children. We can&rsquo;t believe what happened,&rdquo; he told BBC Radio Sussex.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really is saddening. The whole lane is in shock really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ch Supt Westerman said it was a &ldquo;a very, very difficult situation to have to deal with, particularly when children are involved&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Police family liaison officers had been deployed to support the family, while detectives carry out house-to-house enquiries, speak to witnesses and carry out forensic investigations, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Importantly, we will be speaking to the family to understand what has gone on and get to the bottom of what has happened,&rdquo; he added.

<h3 id="woodmancote-murders-residents-shock-as-family-of-four-and-dog-found-dead-in-west-sussex-village">Woodmancote murders: Residents&rsquo; shock as family of four and dog found dead in West Sussex village</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/31/12/2.53253094.jpg" alt="img">
Residents have spoken of their shock after a family of four and a dog were found dead in a small village in West Sussex.</p>
<p>Officers went to a house in Woodmancote, near Chichester, at 6.45pm on Monday evening after receiving a call from someone who was concerned about the family&rsquo;s wellbeing.</p>
<p>When police arrived they found the bodies of two adults and two children. All four are believed to be from the same family.</p>
<p>Police said they are treating the deaths as murder but are not yet looking for any suspects.</p>
<p>Woodmancote residents have spoken of their shock.</p>
<p>Villager Ian Richardson said: “I have never heard anything like that before, really.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we consider ourselves a low crime area.”</p>
<p>Mr Richardson said he didn&rsquo;t know the people who lived in the house, although Woodmancote is generally a close community, he added.</p>
<p>Chief Superintendent Jerry Westerman said: “This is believed to be an isolated incident contained to one property and in these early stages of the investigation we are not seeking anyone else in connection with the incident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Local residents can expect to see an increased police presence in the area as our enquiries continue. Specialist officers have been deployed to support the investigation and we’re urging anyone with any information to get in touch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our thoughts are with the family at this incredibly difficult and challenging time.”
