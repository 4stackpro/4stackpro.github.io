To weather the COVID-19 crisis, teams will need resilience. But with the new work-at-home protocols, can leaders really do anything remotely to increase their people’s ability to deal with adversity ? Yes, say the authors, who draw on their studies of resilience among U.S. Navy recruits to offer strategies. It all comes down to two things: people (and enhancing three protective qualities they need) and perspective (which leaders should help their team members broaden).</p>
<p>Christoph Burgstedt/Science Photo Library/Getty Images</p>
<p>We’ve made our coronavirus coverage free for all readers. To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter.</p>
<p>To make it through the current crisis and return to a new normal, you and your team will need to be resilient. The good news is that leaders can help create the conditions that make this possible. We’ve done multiple studies with U.S. Navy recruits that show how this can best be done—and, recently, in studying how leaders are responding to the crisis, we’ve come across valuable stories of how they can achieve this even when team members are working remotely. The key is to focus on two things: people and perspective.</p>
<p>People: Know your team’s resilience factors</p>
<p>Three “protective or facilitative factors” (as psychologists call them) predict whether people will have resilience: high levels of confidence in their abilities, disciplined routines for their work, and social and family support. Ideally, you’ll already have a good sense of how your team members stack up on these—especially the first two. But some factors may be weakened during this crisis. One of the first things you can do is establish a “resilience inventory dashboard,” by checking in individually with your reports and asking directly how comfortable they feel telecommuting, how they plan to schedule their work days, and how you might support them with any life or family commitments. To address such commitments, the managing partner at one law firm recently went to all the lawyers at the firm one-by-one to ask about their situations, and asked particularly if they needed to take care of any elderly or at-risk people. Then he redistributed caseloads and paralegal support to help out those who were in danger of being overwhelmed.</p>
<p>The many new challenges your reports are facing may shake their confidence, but you can boost it by actively conveying your faith in them. One mechanical engineer who was doubting her ability to telework told us how much it helped her confidence to have her manager simply tell her that he respected the decisions she made and the work she produced, and that any mistakes she made would just be tools for improvement.</p>
<p>Doing their jobs from home will probably require new routines and test your people’s ability to focus. Think about how you can help your team adjust. One loan-processing manager called for more-frequent quality checks while his reports were getting used to working remotely, for instance. Though that may seem like micromanaging, an underwriter on the team told us it reassured him and helped his group “slow down and not rush” despite being under extreme pressure. Leaders might also suggest time-blocking and other personal productivity strategies to encourage disciplined work habits.</p>
<p>Leaders can also strengthen their teams by displaying compassion. We’ve seen thoughtful managers do this by giving their reports their time, showing concern, helping them get the office equipment and supplies they need to do their jobs at home, and by making special accommodations for individuals who are at high risk because they have underlying health conditions like diabetes. It’s especially important to demonstrate that you genuinely care about your team as not just employees but people. Before broader organizational work-at-home mandates were implemented during the COVID-19 outbreak, a manager at a large oil and gas company proactively got permission from upper management to have her team telework and discussed the transition plan with each team member. One of her reports, highlighting the manager’s personal concern for each individual, said that her actions helped him feel “like a vital, contributing member of our company.”</p>
<p>If your people rate high on the resilience factors, that’s great, but you can’t assume they’re out of danger. Very resilient people are geared toward action and what they can control, and as result they may “panic-work” and burn out during times of crisis. You will need to take measures to maintain their resilience, too. Try to focus their energy on strategic initiatives.</p>
<p>People: Foster resilience-oriented conversations</p>
<p>A large body of research shows that the most effective way to increase resilience at work is through customized individual coaching. The results from a field experiment we did with approximately 400 U.S. Navy recruits in 2015 also point to its power. In it we asked recruits to rate their resilience at the beginning of boot camp and then (midway through the boot camp) had half of them take part in a one-on-one peer coaching session—what we called a “guided conversation”—while the other half were left to their own devices. In the guided conversations, recruits were asked to share positive experiences, compare challenges and how they were dealing with them, and imagine their future as navy sailors. The recruits who had these conversations saw a highly significant 20% increase in resilience, while the control group saw a change of less than 1%.</p>
<p>As a manager, you might have guided conversations with each direct report yourself, but these can be time-consuming, and the power differential between you and your reports may make these discussions lopsided. So we recommend encouraging your team members to have guided conversations among themselves on a regular basis. You might go as far as assigning pairs and requiring scheduled video chats. Similar to the recruits in our study, your team members can discuss successful experiences, problems and how they’re tackling them, and what they’ve learned during the crisis that they can still apply when things get back to normal. This last step, we believe, is essential. People need to be reminded that things will stabilize—and envision who they will be after the adversity has passed.</p>
<p>Perspective: Ask questions</p>
<p>Neuroscience suggests that the fear and anxiety we experience because of COVID-19 will naturally narrow our ability to see our future and envision creative solutions to our problems. But there are questions leaders can ask to counter this effect.</p>
<p>First, you can help your team members face down reality. Accepting things as they are is key to building resilience. As Admiral Jim Stockdale, who was held captive during the Vietnam war, famously noted, the optimists among his fellow prisoners (those who expected to be rescued quickly) didn’t survive: “I think they all died of broken hearts.” So ask your direct reports what plans they have in place for working remotely longer than anticipated. While they might not feel comfortable thinking about such things, they will weather the crisis better if you help them plan constructively.</p>
<p>You can also remind people that they can rely on and collaborate with others. Ask them, Who on your team or within your organization or within your network might be able to help you? There is power in reminding them they’re not alone, and in building a network of support during adversity. (The colleagues lending a hand will benefit as well, because helping others is one of the things that increases people’s resilience, psychologists believe.)</p>
<p>Perspective: Find learning opportunities</p>
<p>In a different longitudinal study, involving about 200 U.S. Navy recruits during training in 2015, we found that when the recruits viewed their unsuccessful experiences as learning opportunities—rather than a string of failures—it also built their resilience. In his book Crucibles of Leadership Robert J. Thomas described an approach he called “reframing the tension”: focusing the learning opportunities lying within the adversity rather than despite the adversity. That’s what college professors are doing today. Denied the ability to teach in the classroom, they’re quickly becoming experts at online instruction and learning. Is it possible that after this crisis universities will be more ready and able to take entire degree programs online while still maintaining high quality?</p>
<p>Another thing you can do is help your direct reports recognize special talents or skills that might be especially useful during the crisis. For example, as your team moves to telecommuting, do you have a particular member who is superb at dealing with distraction? You could have that person provide virtual training to the others. As each member sees how his or her special skills contribute to the good of the team, the group’s confidence and social support will grow.</p>
<p>Resilient teams will learn how to improvise in these new modes of working together. Since that will require constant adjustments, we recommend that you borrow from agile processes and have a daily virtual “standup” meeting. However, we suggest you focus not only on tasks but also on relationships: Use the meeting to increase the team’s sense of connection. For instance, you might share ideas about team hand-offs and how to ensure that they don’t become drop-offs. You can lead discussions on how well things are working, what processes can be improved, and the like. Highlighting what the team is learning during the adversity will collectively strengthen it in all three critical protective factors: confidence, disciplined routines, and support.</p>
<p>Any crisis is also an opportunity to build resilience among your reports. If you successfully implement the tactics we offer here, you just may find that they not only bounce back from these difficult times but emerge much stronger as people and as a team.

The conventional wisdom holds that climate change is a problem for international organizations, big governments, and global corporations to solve. Only those major players can make a dent in global greenhouse gas emissions, the thinking goes, and only they can pool the necessary resources. Given the monumental scale of the coming climate crisis, anything short of such high-level mobilization seems inconsequential, even futile.</p>
<p>It is true that nothing short of a massive, globally coordinated push can reduce emissions enough to slow down climate change in the decades ahead. That is why international organizations, national governments, and companies are spending some 95 percent of their climate-related investment on carbon emission reductions. But those efforts will serve to prevent only the worst-case scenarios. The fact is that climate change has already done a great deal of damage and that more harmful effects will be impossible to avert altogether.</p>
<p>Reducing emissions is just half

<h3 id="nfo-stocks-offer-buying-opportunity-on-earning-resilience">NFO stocks offer buying opportunity on earning resilience</h3>
<p><img src="https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/04/14/642813.JPG" alt="img">
PETALING JAYA: The earning resilience and high dividend yields of number forecast operators (NFOs), coupled with the recent fall in their share prices, make the stocks an appealing option for investors at the moment.</p>
<p>UOB Kay Hian Research, which maintained its “buy” call on the sector despite the recent extension of the movement control order (MCO), noted that NFO stocks now featured the highest dividend yield among companies listed on Bursa Malaysia.</p>
<p>The sector, it noted, offered sustainable yields of up to 7.4% from financial year 2021 (FY21) onwards.</p>
<p>“This quantum of high dividend yield is particularly attractive, given the sector’s earnings resilience and the capital market’s eventual hunger for high yielders, ” it said in a note.</p>
<p>It added that the depressed share prices of NFO stocks also presented a buying opportunity, given that Berjaya Sports Toto (BToto) and Magnum Bhd ’s share prices have fallen some 15.4% and 20.2%, respectively, from their year-to-date peaks.</p>
<p>The fall in share prices were initially on the back of concerns about detrimental policy changes after the formation of the Perikatan Nasional coalition government, and later, the financial contagion impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, we believe the shortfall in earnings is only short term and should not be misconstrued as investors’ falling confidence in NFO’s business resilience, ” it said.</p>
<p>The research house, which maintained its “overweight” stance on the gaming sector and NFO sub-sector, also sees the possibility of the government allowing NFOs to have more special draw days after the current MCO-related restrictions are lifted.</p>
<p>This, it believes, it possible given the government’s need to raise tax revenue.</p>
<p>The number of special draw days had previously been cut down to eight days from 22 in the two previous Budgets.</p>
<p>“If this materialises, the incremental profits to the NFO operators would not be significant. “Nevertheless, it would validate the NFO operators’ existence and importance to government revenues, ” the research house said.</p>
<p>On the flipside, it noted that owing to the MCO, the NFOs have suspended their operations to comply with the order, causing a loss of 19 draw days.</p>
<p>UOB Kay Hian research said it had cut FY20 and FY21 earnings forecasts by 16% and 7%, respectively, but expects swift recovery post-MCO.</p>
<p>“We expect earnings to normalise once the MCO is lifted, given the NFOs’ resilient earnings and inelastic consumer base, ” it said, noting that ticket sales were still intact before the MCO was implemented.</p>
<p>It said FY21 earnings, however, were reduced to factor in the long-term impact of the extended MCO on the economic and consumption recovery.</p>
<p>The research house prefers Magnum for its pure exposure to the segment with a longer-term potential catalyst of U-Mobile monetisation, and has maintained its “buy” call on both BToto and Magnum.
