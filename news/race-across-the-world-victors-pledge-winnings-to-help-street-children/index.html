<p>The winners of the BBC&rsquo;s Race Across the World have pledged £10,000 to help the street children they came across as they travelled through South America.</p>
<p>On Sunday, viewers saw uncle and nephew Emon and Jamiul Choudhury win the 54-day race by just 20 seconds.</p>
<p>They pipped husband and wife Rob and Jen in a nailbiting finish.</p>
<p>Emon and Jamiul immediately promised half of the £20,000 prize to charities after seeing children sleeping rough in Sao Paulo, Brazil.</p>
<p>They have since also reportedly decided to give £5,000 to Emon&rsquo;s family orphanage in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We decided at Sao Paulo that if we were to win, we&rsquo;d donate at least half of the money to help the kids of Sao Paulo and of Brazil,&rdquo; Emon told BBC Breakfast on Monday.</p>
<p>Image caption The five pairs of contestants set off from Mexico City on a 15,000-mile quest</p>
<p>&ldquo;It just feels like the right thing to do. The trip itself was an amazing experience. You can&rsquo;t put a figure on the experience that we had, and we believe the money will go such a long way to help so many people in the areas that we visited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Architecture graduate Jamiul added: &ldquo;It was a life-changing experience. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a price that could be put on everything that we experienced. I guess it shows you that there&rsquo;s a bigger world out there and it puts into perspective how minuscule we are in a wider world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emon, 35, from Bradford and Jamiul, 25, from Oldham, took part after reuniting 10 years after Emon left the family following his refusal to settle into an arranged marriage.</p>
<p>The 15,000-mile race took the contestants from Mexico City to the most southerly city in the world, Ushuaia in Argentina, with a budget of £1,400.</p>
<p>It came down to a frantic finale as the leading two pairs dumped their backpacks and scrambled to be first to reach the summit of a hill.</p>
<p>Sunday&rsquo;s episode was watched by an average of 3.3 million viewers on BBC Two.</p>
<p>The second series of the show was a hit with viewers and critics.</p>
<p>Skip Twitter post by @TobyonTV Emon and Jamiul donating half their winnings to a charity for disadvantaged children in South America is the perfect ending for a show which showcases humility &amp; generosity #RaceAcrossTheWorld #RATW — Toby Earle (@TobyonTV) April 26, 2020 Report</p>
<p>The BBC has been forced to halt production of a celebrity edition of the contest due to the coronavirus pandemic, but has opened applications for the next regular series, saying it will return &ldquo;as soon as it is safe to do so&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id="no-fly-zone-will-race-across-the-world-be-the-last-travel-tv-of-its-kind">No fly zone: will Race Across the World be the last travel TV of its kind?</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2025df5ddd067fd1c2b71187f93bc281221d8e90/0_0_4375_2625/master/4375.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=f295c2030919a3cb514036a0c6d96060" alt="img">
Millions watched the show in which five couples dashed down Latin America, but such programmes may need to function differently post-pandemic</p>
<p>No fly zone: will Race Across the World be the last travel TV of its kind?</p>
<p>Jumping into a turquoise infinity lake at the top of a Oaxacan mountain, Dom and his sister, Lizzie, are awestruck. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything as beautiful as that in my entire life,” Dom says. “I’d have been gutted if we’d missed this.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, two rivals in their adventure, the married couple Jen and Robbie, are hot, sweaty and weighed down by their giant rucksacks on the outskirts of Mexico City. They have mistakenly travelled to a metro station, rather than an international bus terminal 100km (62 miles) away. “Oh my God,” fumes Jen. “Where’s the bloody bus station? We’re LOST.”</p>
<p>Anyone who has strapped on a backpack and boarded a 6am long-haul flight will have nodded in recognition all the way through the latest series of Race Across the World (BBC Two). As the contestants soon found out, that is the thing with travel: sometimes you accidentally discover a hidden wonder of the world, other times you are sunburnt and on the edge of a breakdown at a ticketing booth.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was this sense of holiday deja vu – alongside the heartwarming displays of kindness from strangers – that made more than 4 million people watch the five couples, unaided by smartphones or air travel, race 25,000km through Latin America.</p>
<p>Halfway through the series’ broadcast, the Covid-19 pandemic spread rapidly, prompting most countries to lock down and suspend international travel. With each following episode, Race Across the World took on a bittersweet quality, as journeying so freely – and being within touching distance of strangers! – instantly looked as if it were from another era. While only one couple took home the £20,000 prize in Sunday’s episode (no spoilers ahead), the greater prize for all the contestants was being among the last people – for a while, at least – able to explore the world on a whim.</p>

<p>“It’s pretty crazy watching the race back now,” says Dom, back home in the UK. Lizzie agrees: “It definitely makes it seem more epic than we ever realised before.” They add that the show – and those 28-hour bus rides – unwittingly prepared them for life in isolation: “We are both quite used to waiting now – but at least we have the comfort of our phones, TV, beds and proper meals. We’re still bickering every day, though …”</p>
<p>Tim Harcourt, the show’s executive producer, says: “Watching the show back now, it reminds me that we all took our freedom to travel for granted. But I hope the series serves as inspiration that’s especially needed during these times. Families and young people especially are tapping into these shared experiences and discovering the world the only way they can at the moment – through exciting, adrenaline-filled travel TV.”</p>
<p>With holidays cancelled, weddings and festivals postponed and people having no idea when they will be allowed to leave their home towns, Harcourt is right in that viewers are looking to TV to transport them across continents and cultures.</p>
<p>Historically, travel on TV has been a form of escapism or inspiration. In the late 60s and 70s, bright, magazine-like shows such as Holiday and Wish You Were Here…? promoted the wave of cheap charter flights and package holidays in Europe. In the 00s, things shifted to reality TV competitions such as Shipwrecked and Coach Trip.</p>
<p>These shows are broadcast alongside celebrity travelogues from stalwarts such as Michael Palin, Joanna Lumley and Billy Connolly, through to Jack Whitehall, Russell Howard and Sue Perkins. Channel 4’s successful Travel Man series – which has been running since 2015 – announced a change in presenter from Richard Ayoade to Joe Lycett last year. But with most on-location TV grounded like the airlines, what does the future hold for our armchair travels on screen?</p>
<p>Foodie jet-setters can still torment themselves by watching the final series of The Trip – in which Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon eat in fancy restaurants around Europe, doing Marlon Brando impressions – which aired on Sky earlier this month, mid-quarantine.</p>
<p>Josh Hyams, a producer on The Trip to Greece, is in the early stages of developing another travel series. He says: “When I watch The Trip again, it feels like glimpsing back to an easier and less complicated time. Coronavirus has rendered making a travel show like this impossible for the moment.</p>
<p>“I hope that, once the virus has passed, we can rely on travel shows coming back as before. However, the problem will always be whether one can get insurance that covers a production for any outbreak or delays. That will determine when a show will be able to come back.”</p>
<p>The BBC’s Pilgrimage: The Road to Istanbul also experienced a similar strange shift in world-changing events midway through transmission. But its executive producer, Caroline Matthews, believes the timing of the series’ broadcast – in which seven celebrities walked the Sultan’s Trail from Serbia to Turkey – and its theme of peaceful contemplation struck a chord with viewers in lockdown: “I saw on Twitter that quite a few people have been commenting on the mindfulness and spirituality that’s kind of been resonating with everybody at the moment because we’re going through such tough times,” she says.</p>
<p>Matthews says they would have expected to be in the development stage for the fourth series – which films in September – but this has been put on hold. “We do have a slight advantage in that a pilgrimage is all about physical distancing and isolation by its nature.”</p>
<p>On the issue of the need to be mindful about bringing a cast and crew into remote areas in future, she adds: “We have a skeletal crew – the minimal amount of people to deliver the show, anyway. We’re just going to have to be more creative and resourceful in how we film – splitting into smaller groups and a lot more self-shot. We always use local runners, crew and drivers, too.”</p>
<p>Producers will no doubt be looking to the travel industry for guidance, as it tries to work out how it can function after the pandemic. Fiona Reece, the founder of the PR and content agency Travel Tonic, says: “There’s still a huge appetite for exploration, but I think, post-corona, people might feel nervous about travelling again. There’s nothing on television that really exists to give people advice on how to book, where would be safe to travel to. I think this crisis has really highlighted the need for advice on TV shows again, like we used to see with Holiday or Wish You Were Here..?”</p>
<p>Reece believes the focus will be on UK-based holidays: “Some people will want to go back to their favourite places, such as Devon and Cornwall, but others will want to go where they can escape the crowds. I think there’s going to be much more interest in remote places, plus glamping, camping and road-tripping in camper vans to explore the British Isles.”</p>
<p>Matthews is also looking at filming on home turf again: “When lockdown is lifted, we’ll start work on locations. At the moment, we’re looking at pilgrimages abroad and in the UK. Maybe this is where we all fall back in love with the UK again.”</p>
<p>As for Race Across the World, plans for the first celebrity version were postponed in March, but Harcourt remains optimistic: “We haven’t started casting for the next series, but I am confident we will be ready to go as soon as travel restrictions are lifted for one of the routes we want.</p>
<p>“Travel TV is a window on the world that awaits us all. The effort to overcome this crisis needs to be a team like those trying to win Race Across the World – we need good communication, patience, risk aversion, foresight and planning, coupled with a bit of luck.”</p>
<p>Race Across the World: Revealed is on BBC Two on 3 May at 8pm; series’ one and two are available in full on BBC iPlayer</p>

<p>Race Across The World fans have been left devastated after Jo and Sam dropped out of the race in tonight’s final.</p>
<p>The two were left standing as one of the final four couples, alongside Jen and Rob, Jamiul and Emon and Lizzie and Dom, and although many fans had highly tipped them to become the winners of this year’s series, Jo and Sam were left with no choice but to leave after they blew their budget.</p>

<p>On day 48 of the competition, in Mendoza, Argentina, the mother and son duo were seen inside the hotel, where they called the rest of the couples to join them as they announced the news.</p>
<p>‘We’ve run out of money,’ Sam told the others.</p>
<p>‘We realised we couldn’t go on to the final leg,’ Jo then responded.</p>
<p>Sam later explained: ‘So we were at this in ranch, it was beautiful, we had moments riding horses what she wanted to do the whole trip, and finishing it somewhere beautiful on a horse, riding off into the sunset, that’s what we did,’ as a flashback to Jo and Sam riding horses was then shown.</p>
<p>‘The last seven weeks have been incredible,’ Jo interjected. ‘We’ve done so much.’</p>
<p>Jo and Sam spent some time on a ranch in Argentina (Picture: BBC)</p>
<p>‘These are what are important, these wonderful experiences with Sam.’</p>
<p>A tearful Lizzie then said: ‘We really want to finish the race for you guys.’</p>
<p>‘It’s been so wonderful,’ Jo replied.</p>
<p>Fans across social media were distraught at this news, with one tweeting: ‘Can’t believe Jo &amp; Sam won’t make the final leg #RaceAcrossTheWorld.</p>
<p>‘Really wanted them to win.’</p>
