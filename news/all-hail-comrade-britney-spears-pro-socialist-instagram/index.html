<p>This week:</p>
<p>The Good Fight: Still great!</p>
<p>Britney Spears, Instagram hero.</p>
<p>The best thing on Quibi.</p>
<p>Trying to recover from the Schitt’s Creek finale.</p>
<p>A very important Sex and the City discovery.</p>
<p>Comrade Britney Will Save Us All</p>
<p>Welcome to 2020, where BRITNEY SPEARS is the voice of reason.</p>
<p>Using the word “quarantine” when talking about the pop superstar is a little dark, considering the legal shackles that have been on Spears for over a decade. Her career and finances have been under the control of a conservatorship since 2008, but suspicions over the extent and healthiness of those constraints escalated in recent years, culminating in the #FreeBritney movement. In some fans’ eyes, life is a quarantine for Britney Spears.</p>
<p>That said, the singer’s Instagram account has long been a salve for the Britney Army, an unfiltered outlet to witness Spears be, for better or worse, her earnest, dorky, down-to-earth self.</p>
<p>Mostly, her feed has been filled with the innocuous posts we’re used to: photos of outfits she likes, exercise routines and dance videos, #TBTs, or nature shots, usually with corny, goofy captions. But lately they’ve been dotted with rare acknowledgments of real-world news, and, when parsed, packed with surprisingly progressive political messages.</p>
<p>A recent meme-style post—a truly great one, at that—promoting social distancing, for example, would be ruled a rudimentary celebrity PSA had it not followed several more conspicuous posts.</p>
<p>Amidst fairly frequent posts sending positive vibes to everyone in self-isolation, she reposted a poem from Brooklyn-based artist Mimi Zhu with a glaring socialist message.</p>
<p>Zhu’s poem was a call for connection that included a plea for the government to enact wealth distribution programs in the wake of the coronavirus and encouraged striking. Spears posted it with the caption, “Communion goes beyond walls.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t long before “Comrade Britney Spears” became a viral meme and the “Oops!&hellip;I Did It Again” singer became a Marxist hero. (“Work Bitch” suddenly takes on deeper meaning.)</p>
<p>Whether or not any sly political messaging was her intent, it’s been refreshing that Spears’ Instagram feed has been consistently clarifying, inspirational, and wholly reasonable—especially as her fellow celebrities lose their minds, flailing with embarrassing and tone-deaf attempts at using their platforms during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Anyway welcome to the new reality, where we’re at home losing our minds and shaving our own heads, and it’s Britney Spears who’s the one getting us through the crisis.</p>
<p>Nicole Richie Is the Best Quibi</p>
<p>The fact is that Nicole Richie is a comedic genius. I don’t know how! I don’t why! It shouldn’t make sense!</p>
<p>The Simple Life last aired 13 years ago—I recoiled in horror at that number and it made me throw out my back—yet we still conjoin Richie and the Coach bag to Paris Hilton, and an era of barely ironic worship of celebrity vapidity.</p>
<p>Most neglect the fact that, even then, the socialite heiresses were very much playing the part, and as such exhibited a canny sense of comedy, particularly what was so funny about them. So maybe it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Richie, now a Hollywood and fashion multi-hyphenate, would prove to be reliably hysterical each time someone takes a chance on her.</p>
<p>She was great in a guest arc on the geek-spy-comedy-thriller Chuck, and stole every single scene of Tina Fey’s return to NBC, Great News. She sent-up the “Nicole Richie” of it all brilliantly in guest spots on Camping and Grace and Frankie, and now she’s doing it again on, uhhh, Quibi.</p>
<p>In Nikki Fre$h, she plays a version of herself whose latest whim is to be an eco-conscious trap queen, making rap music in celebration of plants. It’s absurd, but so specifically absurd—it’s not far-fetched that a celebrity might take up this venture—that you can’t help laughing. It’s the best performance in the best new show on the brand-new streaming service.</p>
<p>Is it worth subscribing to Quibi just for it? Luckily, the company is offering a free trial to new users, which means I don’t have to be mean and truthfully answer that question.</p>
<p>Still Crying Over the Schitt’s Creek Finale</p>
<p>The series finale of Schitt’s Creek aired this week. It was, like everything to do with this show, wonderful.</p>
<p>I’m the first to admit that I tend to be hyperbolic about these things, but I legitimately cried real, continuous tears for the entire last 15 minutes of the episode. (Once the Jazzagals stood to sing while the grooms walked down the aisle, I was done.) What a blessing that, at this time specifically, they were exclusively tears of joy.</p>
<p>How unexpectedly resonant, this celebration of a family who, once disaster forced them to be essentially trapped with each other, grew to become the best versions of themselves. How hopeful and necessary to watch and see that there are happily ever afters to be had in the time ahead, once we all get through this. And to be reminded that a world of love, sans judgement, is one we can have and deserve.</p>
<p>In any case, somewhere in the midst of saying goodbye to this show, co-creator and star Dan Levy, who plays Daniel Rose, shared this tweet from his mother, and I got choked up all over again.</p>
<p>I Couldn’t Help But Wonder&hellip;What the Hell?</p>
<p>I am a white gay in his thirties and therefore, as contractually obligated, have seen every episode of Sex and the City a number of times so high there is no safe space in which I would ever be comfortable admitting it into. And I am a person who has his own newsletter.</p>
<p>That context is necessary to explain the extent of my shock, confusion, and delight for what may ultimately rank as one of the most ludicrous inconsequential details of the season’s run to be brought to my attention. My friend Becca was in the midst of a quarantine rewatch when she noticed a scene in which Miranda and Steve are in bed and Steve is reading a book titled Aquarium Owner’s Guide.</p>
<p>I have roughly 750 questions.</p>
<p>What to watch this week:</p>
<p>Insecure: I am very secure about recommending the new season!</p>
<p>Killing Eve: Still killing it!</p>
<p>Run: Don’t walk to this next great series from the producers of Fleabag!</p>
<p>Mrs. America: I don’t have a joke here. It’s just very good.</p>
<p>What to skip this week:

<h3 id="how-britney-spears-is-maintaining-her-close-relationship-with-her-sons-while-in-quarantine">How Britney Spears Is Maintaining Her ‘Close Relationship’ With Her Sons While In Quarantine</h3>
<p><img src="https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/britney-spears-rex-ftr-1.jpg" alt="img">
Britney Spears’ sons Sean, 14, and Jayden, 13, are currently in quarantine with their dad Kevin Federline — but she’s in constant communication with them over FaceTime!</p>
<p>Britney Spears, 38, isn’t letting quarantine stop her from her mama duties! The pop star has been regularly talking to her sons Sean Preston, 14, and Jayden James, 13, who are currently at home with their dad Kevin Federline, 42. “Britney is in constant communication with on the phone and via FaceTime with her boys but they primarily are spending their time with Kevin and his family which is really regular life for them,” a source tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. “[Sean and Jayden] very active boys and like to play sports and skateboard and do those types of things,” the insider added.</p>
<p>The quarantine has been hard on both Britney and the kids, but both parties have been making time for each other and catch up. “Like all teenage boys, they’re doing the best they can being cooped up but they do see their mom when they can,” the source dished, also noting the former couple’s custody arrangement. “They’ve been living primarily with Kevin most of the time anyways, so there’s really no change as far as custody is concerned. But they love their mom of course and have a great, close relationship with her. There’s just more stability and consistency at Kevin’s house.”</p>
<p>Britney and Kevin tied the knot in 2004, but divorced just three years later in 2007. Since their split, Britney has been under a legal conservatorship. As for custody, the exes came to a new agreement in Sept. 2019 that gave her 30 percent unsupervised custodial rights compared to their prior arrangement that saw them share the boys 50/50.</p>
<p>Despite not being able to be with her kids, Britney has been keeping a positive attitude on social media with uplifting posts and workout routines! “If you want to conquer the anxiety of life …. live in the moment and breathe !!! Especially take time to smell the roses,” she wrote on a caption of a rose on Friday, April 10. She went on to thank healthcare workers and essential workers. “To all the workers who have put so much time and dedication to helping us through the Coronavirus, I want to say thank you to all of you — your help and dedication means so much to all of us, and we love you!” she said in a selfie video shot that same day.

<h3 id="there-seems-to-be-a-special-tone-why-britney-spears-is-a-five-star-film-critic">&lsquo;There seems to be a Special Tone&rsquo;: Why Britney Spears is a five star film critic</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c8ff10f9d7b0ff0e4ecf76609426b990d5e767c/0_3_2616_1569/master/2616.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=45b6b83ff5a57c4d52d63818117ddd1c" alt="img">
The singer and sometime actor has embarked on a new lockdown career as a movie pundit. And, so far, she’s reading the public mood perfectly</p>
<p>The coronavirus crisis hasn’t been kind to performers. On a practical scale, schedules have been wiped and income reduced to zero. But psychologically, it also means that the planet’s biggest extroverts have been robbed of an outlet. They have all this pent-up desire for approval, and nowhere to put it.</p>
<p>Until now, this has largely manifested itself in slightly cringey iPhone videos uploaded to the internet. But now Britney Spears, that bold pioneer, has opened up a whole new avenue of quarantined expression. That’s right, she has become a film reviewer.</p>
<p>The first fruits of Britney’s side-hustle appeared last night, as she posted her review of the Robert Downey Jr film Dolittle on Instagram. It reads:</p>
<p>This movie is a must see !!! @RobertDowneyJr is so genuine you fall in love with him … the animal characters are hilarious and there seems to be a Special Tone throughout the whole movie which I find hard to find these days 🤔🤔🤔😘. So if you watch this movie and you’re as enamored as I was with his jackets and clothing … don’t get lost like I did 😂 just remember he’s a man who can speak to animals and he’s brilliant 🦜🐳🦁🐷🐻🦋💕 !!!!! Pss … how long has it been since you’ve seen what you’ve wanted to see … I can’t even count how many movies I’ve watched in this quarantine so far 🙄🙄🙄😅😅😅 !!!!!”</p>
<p>Now, it’s easy to mock Spears for this. The capitalisation of “Special Tone”. The term “I find hard to find”. The implication that the plot was slightly too complex for her. The fact that she is posting a critical rave for a film that not only contains a climactic scene where Robert Downey Jr frantically pulls a bagpipe from a dragon’s bum, but is currently on schedule to be the biggest commercial flop of the year.</p>
<p>After all, Britney’s assessment of the film is quite the outlier. Compare her Dolittle rave with the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw review, which called the film “horribly inert”. Or Empire, which deemed it “lacklustre”. Or Total Film, which described it as “lifeless and dead-eyed”. Or NPR, who decided it was less a film and more “a crime scene in need of forensic analysis”. Perhaps Britney was expecting less of Dolittle. Perhaps she uses a different set of criteria to evaluate cinema. Perhaps she watched the wrong film by accident. We may never know.</p>
<p>However, take a look at Rotten Tomatoes and you’ll find that her view is much more closely aligned to the public than the critics. The professionals gave Dolittle a miserable 15%. The general public, on the other hand, awarded it a mighty 76%. And Britney’s post – essentially “nice animals, good clothes, bit confusing in places” – reads exactly like a 76% review. In layman’s terms, this means that Spears has her finger on the pulse of public opinion. She understands what we want, and she always has, because she is one of us.</p>

<p>And, don’t forget, Dolittle is a flop. Far fewer people went to see it than anticipated, so there’s a real chance that Spears’ praise will inspire hundreds of thousands to seek it out. It might even dig the film out of the mire a little. For a successful actor such as Spears (no, really; her 2002 film Crossroads made its budget back five times over, making it a much hotter commercial property than Dolittle) to reach down and help an underdog like this shows a lot of class.</p>
<p>Now we just have to sit back and wait to see what she reviews next. Will she continue to buck the critical trend, by slagging off Uncut Gems or embracing Playmobil: The Movie? Will she maintain her dedication to focusing on underperforming releases, by reviewing UglyDolls or The Goldfinch? How on earth will she use emojis to convey the Special Tone of Colour Out of Space or The Hunt? Either way, she has to review more films. Her public demands it.
