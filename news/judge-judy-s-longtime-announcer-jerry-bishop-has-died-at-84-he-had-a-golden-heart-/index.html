<h3 id="judge-judys-salary-heads-to-appeals-court">Judge Judy&rsquo;s Salary Heads to Appeals Court</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2016/03/watch-judge-judy-online-free.jpg" alt="img">
Judy Sheindlin has made it clear that she intends to end Judge Judy after its 25th season in syndication, but a legal fight over her mammoth $47 million-a-year salary could spur a major showdown before a California appeals court. On Wednesday, court papers were filed indicating a battle between Rebel Entertainment and CBS subsidiary Big Ticket Entertainment is far from over.</p>
<p>Rebel has been pursuing Big Ticket over profits to the show for many years. Rebel is the successor-in-interest to the talent agency that packaged Judge Judy in the 1990s. Although CBS, Big Ticket and Sheindlin don&rsquo;t think much of Rebel&rsquo;s work, the entity is contractually owed a 5 percent share of net profits for Judge Judy. The problem for Rebel, according to its lawyers, is that Sheindlin&rsquo;s salary eats those profits. A 2016 suit claimed that the production company shouldn&rsquo;t be deducting her inflated salary as a production cost.</p>
<p>Two years ago, the defendants scored a summary judgment win on this issue. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Joanne O&rsquo;Donnell pointed to how Judge Judy was the only first-run syndicated television show to experience year-to-year ratings growth during its tenure. &ldquo;Plaintiff has presented no evidence that the salary was negotiated in bad faith or is unreasonable in light of the undisputed &lsquo;resounding success&rsquo; of Judge Judy and the fact that without its namesake star the show could not continue,&rdquo; she wrote.</p>
<p>Since then, the case has continued to explore other controversies, including money from the Sheindlin-created series Hot Bench, but Rebel has been eager to revisit that big 2018 ruling over Sheindlin&rsquo;s salary. Recently, Rebel and Big Ticket came to a settlement, but as made clear in a filing on Wednesday, the terms of the deal really just put all other issues to bed in order to fast-track the appeal over the salary deduction.</p>
<p>Now that Judge Judy is headed to an appeals court, Hollywood should tune in.</p>
<p>In most instances, the interests of profit participants for a television series are aligned. But what happens when they are not — say when a showrunner gets fired or an actor departs, and the ongoing producers look to derive all the spoils of the series?</p>
<p>This Judge Judy case presents an analogous situation — or at least, allegedly. What Rebel is essentially claiming is that CBS and Sheindlin colluded with each other to convert the show&rsquo;s profits into the show&rsquo;s star&rsquo;s salary. (CBS and Sheindlin are currently facing a separate lawsuit for doing something similar to the sale of old episodes).</p>
<p>On appeal, Rebel will seek to revive a claim that Big Ticket breached contract and an obligation for fair dealing in what Judge Judy decided to pay Sheindlin. Rebel will assert that at the very least, this is an issue for a jury. Meanwhile, if past court papers are any indication, Big Ticket will argue that compensation for a show&rsquo;s talent is at the discretion of producers. Almost needless to say, the eventual decision could become quite meaningful for others in entertainment.

<h3 id="nj-courts-may-soon-need-help-from-judge-judy--editorial">N.J. courts may soon need help from ‘Judge Judy’ | Editorial</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nj.com/resizer/rGGvkm9BWPUTrldWxs8SRQBvxak=/1280x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-advancelocal.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4YYGYEKOYFAAXIRARWLVNH23JU.jpg" alt="img">
Just when we’re going to need her the most, “Judge Judy” is about to retire.</p>
<p>Judge Judith Sheindlin’s popular syndicated TV program is going out of production after next season. It’s a shame, since there will be a wealth of material for her ersatz courtroom to grab from landlord-tenant and small-claims court dockets. Disruptions from coronavirus shutdowns will lead to many, many disputes over who needs to pay whom.</p>
<p>This is another one of the ways that New Jersey needs to prepare for when the gloves come back off (maybe), civil courts reopen and people can move around more-or-less freely. Expect an onslaught of these lawsuits, unless steps are taken to resolve some of them before plaintiffs line up to knock on Sheindlin’s fake bench. (She’s hinted that she may return to TV in a new format, but let’s not count on that.)</p>
<p>One example, ripped from the headlines: A group of 27 Gateway Regional High School seniors paid $5,000 to rent a house in Wildwood for May 8-11, the scheduled weekend of their prom.</p>
<p>While the prom hasn’t been scrubbed, it’s likely to be. Even if it isn’t, transient rentals have been barred for now in the shore town. A parent has complained that the kids can’t get a refund; that the owner has only offered the house on an alternate date.</p>
<p>One has to feel for these students, who have been paying toward the rental fee since December. Just as compelling is the landlord’s plight. Owners of income-producing shore property have been largely unable to get there to do off-season maintenance. Potential renters who want to see accommodations in person have been shut down, too.</p>
<p>If the landlord gives the Gateway money back, he still has to continues to paying tax and mortgage bills. Even if the homeowner and the students agree on a new date, it’s likely to be a weekend later in the season that normally carries a higher rental price.</p>
<p>Then, there are cases where restaurant owners are heading to court because their business interruption insurance won’t pay for shutdown-related expenses. One suit has already been filed in Monmouth County. Some policies specifically exempt pandemics, but the operators argue that they’ve closed their doors because the government forced them to, a condition that’s usually covered.</p>
<p>Also, Ticketmaster quietly “clarified” its refund policy for live events the other day. If a show is canceled, buyers can still get their money back. But, now, it’s “no refunds” if the event is “postponed” instead — even if no new date has been announced. And, many tours are on “indefinite” hiatus. Imagine how money sits in limbo from fans who’d already secured tickets for coming outdoor performances at Lincoln Financial Field, MetLife Stadium, etc.</p>
<p>One way to resolve some disputes is to require refunds unless an event is rescheduled immediately to a date certain, so far in advance that it’s unlikely to be postponed again. Beyond the Ticketmaster trenches, one Camden County high school has moved a 50-year reunion scheduled for this Saturday to Oct. 24. Attending students may have to show up wearing masks, but at least they’ll have some idea whether or not they can go on the new date.</p>
<p>It’s good to start hearing post-epidemic planning, so let’s act now to keep the courts from being overwhelmed. While individual amounts at stake may be small, they represent money that unemployed high-school parents and owners of shuttered small businesses can ill afford to keep in suspended animation. If needed, call some retired judges back to hear cases. If really needed, admit Judge Judy to the New Jersey bar.</p>
