<p>Even though international treaties and the apex court have batted for the right of prisoners to healthcare, recent cases have shown that governments will show no leniency when it comes to activists</p>
<p>By Srishti Ojha</p>
<p>While the outbreak of Covid-19 has posed a threat to people all around the world, for prisoners staying in closely confined spaces in jail—where social distancing is a distant dream—it has been particularly trying. Since the pandemic began, measures for their protection have been taken not only for containment of the virus but for preserving their human rights. However, in some cases, this has been denied despite the prisoner being on the verge of death.</p>
<p>The Executive Director of WHO, Michael J Ryan, at the beginning of the pandemic had stated that prisoners cannot be forgotten. Though they may be serving sentences, they deserve no less protection under the law than others and it’s only possible to beat this situation when no one is left behind, he said. UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet had warned that neglecting prisoners during the pandemic was potentially catastrophic as physical distancing and self-isolation are practically impossible.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court too recently took cognisance of the issue and directed states to consider releasing prisoners. This has come as a ray of hope for them. High-powered committees were formed by states to determine the prisoners who could be released and they accordingly started doing so. It was reassuring to see that such high regard was being given to the fundamental and human rights of prisoners by the government.</p>
<p>However, there have been several recent cases where these principles were not adhered to. These include cases of several activists arrested for their alleged involvement in the Elgar Parishad and Bhima Koregaon cases and booked under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA).</p>
<p>The UN has clearly mentioned in its principles that prisoners shall have access to health services available in the country without discrimination on the grounds of their legal situation. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights too states that all prisoners should be treated with respect due to their inherent dignity and value as human beings. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights further states that prisoners have a right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.</p>
<p>And yet, in the arrests of activists, this has been flouted with impunity. The most blatant example of this is the case of Varavara Rao, the 80-year-old Telugu poet who has been in jail since August 28, 2018 for his alleged involvement in the Elgar Parishad case and found Covid positive. His family claimed that they were shocked to find him lying in a hospital bed where he was admitted in a pool of urine, and they were not even allowed to change the sheets. He is nearly blind and on the verge of death, his lawyer claimed.</p>
<p>But the National Investigation Agency (NIA) still believes that the poet is “trying to take advantage of Covid-19”. It filed a 172-page affidavit before the Bombay High Court arguing that he was taking advantage of his situation in seeking bail from court. Though he is in JJ Hospital in Mumbai now, the government had rejected his bail plea five times in the last two years.</p>
<p>Anand Teltumbde and Vernon Gonsalves, the two accused in the Bhima Koregaon violence, were also in close contact with Rao in Taloja Jail and sought to be tested for the coronavirus. They urged the Bombay High Court to direct their release on humanitarian grounds, given that they suffer from chronic health problems and their continued imprisonment endangered their lives. The Court noted that some inmates of Taloja Jail had already tested positive and directed jail authorities and the NIA to respond to the petition.</p>
<p>In addition, Shoma Sen, a 61-year-old academic, who sought bail on grounds of multiple ailments, was also denied bail along with Rao. The NIA gave the same reason while challenging the bail plea of Sudha Bharadwaj, a 52-year-old legal activist and another accused in the Elgar Parishad case when she asked for interim bail on the ground that she suffered from two severe co-morbidities.</p>
<p>All this was done in spite of the recommendation of a high-powered committee for Maharashtra to release prisoners, including those above 60 years and/or those with underlying medical conditions which puts them at a much higher risk.</p>
<p>In addition, Sharjeel Imam, arrested for his alleged inflammatory remarks on CAA and the NRC protests last year, tested positive while lodged in Guwahati Central Jail. This came after activists Akhil Gogoi, Bittu Sonowal and Dhairjya Konwar who were lodged with Imam tested positive. All were booked by the NIA on charges of sedition and under UAPA provisions.</p>
<p>The denial of bail to select prisoners has been criticised by many. Acclaimed author Arundhati Roy has been concerned about the Koregaon accused being found Covid positive and the courts refusing bail to them. She recently wrote a letter to Delhi University professor GN Saibaba who was convicted for his alleged links to Maoists and is in jail. In the letter, she speaks of how immensely cruel it is to keep a man who is certified with 90 percent disability in prison, and how during Covid, a life sentence could so easily become a death sentence.</p>
<p>Advocate Sagar Ashok Shahani of Bombay High Court told India Legal: “The rights of a prisoner cannot be curtailed just because he is in custody. The Supreme Court has time and again reiterated the importance of the fundamental rights of prisoners whilst they are in custody. In Charles Sobhraj vs The Suptd., Central Jail, Tihar, the Court has stated: ‘Imprisonment does not spell farewell to the fundamental rights of the prisoners and as such, they ought to be protected with certain reasonable restrictions’.”</p>
<p>Though attempts were made to stop prisons from becoming fertile grounds for Covid-19, reports of several positive cases have shown that all efforts to curb the virus have failed. But the reluctance of the government and courts to grant bail to undertrials is surprising considering there is a strong chance of over-crowded prisons teeming with more cases.</p>
<p>A source from Tihar Jail told India Legal that though not large in number, Covid positive cases have been found there. They are not being sent to hospitals but are being treated in a separate isolation ward in the prison itself, he revealed.</p>
<p>Advocate Ajay Verma, former convenor, National Forum for Prison Reforms, told India Legal that an important step had been taken by the Supreme Court when on March 23, it had directed the formation of high-powered committees which would make undertrials and convicted prisoners eligible to be considered for interim release. Courts in many states have been positive in implementing the apex court’s order. Courts also consider medical illness as a reason for release, even in cases under the NDPS where bail is otherwise barred.</p>
<p>Verma said that protocols have been followed by Delhi prisons. These include isolation wards for prisoners who test positive, emergency cases being sent to hospitals if required and extra precautions for inmates over 55 years. Rapid tests were being conducted on all new entrants before lodging them in jail so that others could be protected, as per ICMR guidelines. Two jail hospitals have been equipped with oxygen concentrators.</p>
<p>International treaties and covenants have conferred upon prisoners the right to healthcare and the right not to contract diseases in prison. The UN Human Rights Committee in 1993 said there has to be a positive obligation towards persons who are particularly vulnerable because of their status as persons deprived of liberty.</p>
<p>In India, the responsibility of protection of human rights of citizens has been assigned to the superior judiciary, including the Supreme Court and High Courts, by the Constitution. Article 21 preserves a prisoner’s right to life and human dignity and Article 14 enshrines the right to equality and equal protection of law.</p>
<p>In the landmark Parmanand Katara vs Union of India (1989), the Court had said that the State has an obligation to preserve life whether it is an innocent person or a criminal liable to punishment under the law. Supreme Court Justice VR Krishna Iyer had said: “Bail is the rule, and jail is the exception.” This has time and again been reiterated by the Court.</p>
<p>In the present cases, jail has become the norm for many prisoners and their rights have been completely ignored even if their life is under threat. Is this what is expected from a just and egalitarian society?

<h3 id="mr-mathrubootham-is-back-with-a-bang">&ldquo;Mr. Mathrubootham is back with a bang&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/dwf8lf/article32352062.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16-SM-Mathru-Converted" alt="img">
Respected Madam/ Sir,</p>
<p>Surprise! Surprise! Pleasant surprise! Mr. Mathrubootham has returned like MGR with new audio in superhit film Kaavalkaran. Whether people in your esteemed office are already running away shouting old man has returned, escape escape!? One hundred percent this is the truth. Don’t put lies morning itself. All editors in India are lying worse than Charles Sobhraj. You also please don’t start ok? Ok.</p>
<p>Last one month what happened to Mr. Mathrubootham? Has he vanished from face of the earth? Whether he has shifted to overseas? Maybe he has joined Madras underworld? Wrong wrong, thousand times wrong.</p>
<p>Suddenly one story is coming to mind. Shall I tell? I will tell. This is very old story. Back during Bank of India days when I was manager in Periyakottai branch. Or maybe Alapatti branch? Memory is going. So, I am sitting in the manager cabin and enjoying executive experience. Just two-three months after promotion. Nice luxury feeling. Ceiling fan is working. Two-three nice paperweights on table. One money-plant type plant in the corner. Chair means with cushion and all. Every five minutes peon coming to ask manager you want anything saar? I will say nothing nothing. After five minutes again he will come and ask. I will say no thanks. After two-three weeks I told him if he steps inside my office again I will throw paperweight what nonsense is this? Manager cabin or Guruvayoor temple for people to come and go anytime?</p>
<p>Suddenly one day one man is walking quickly into branch and coming directly to my cabin. I said, excuse me, what is the matter. He said, sir, myself local industrialist, planning to build big house. Whether any house loan is available? I said, welcome sir, you are in Bank of India branch, relax and enjoy. We are giving house loan like vegetable shop is giving sambar vegetables. You please give me all details. He sat for 45 minutes and gave full details of family, business, education, house plan and elevation, number of bedrooms, etc. I thought shabaash Mathrubootham, you will easily meet monthly target with this customer.</p>
<p>In between ennamo noises are coming from outside market. I said, sir, let me go and check. He said, excuse me, I am a busy businessman, no time to see market circus. You please give loan details. Then, while I am telling interest rate, he suddenly stood up and said, very good, Bank of India is my final choice. My office will contact in two-three days. He took my visiting card and left.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later another visitor is in my cabin. It is SI from local police station. What happened I asked? He said someone has stolen necklace from nearby jewellery shop and run off. Did you see one man? I said, what man? He said, man is wearing blue check shirt. I said, one businessman came wearing blue check shirt, but he was businessman. He said, thief is wearing green pants. I said, businessman is also wearing green pants but must be coincidence. Then SI said, he is carrying one manja pai, necklace is inside. I said, businessman is also carrying one manja pai. SI said bloody fool, whether any businessman will carry manja pai? I said, thank you for information, but man left just 10 minutes ago. SI got very angry. I said, sir please sit and relax, shall I get tea and bajji? He said, ok.</p>
<p>Madam/ Sir, this is one and only interaction between Mr. Mathrubootham and underworld.</p>
<p>But I forgot to tell main story. What happened for one month? For one month we are staying in neighbour Dr. Shankaramenon’s flat. Poor fellow is getting middle of the night heart trouble. Whether children can come from abroad? Never. Because of Corona. So both of us decided to take care of old friend.</p>
<p>Madam/ sir, what and all adventure happened in Dr. Shankaramenon’s house. I will write in next letter ok? Ok.</p>
<p>Yours in criminal conspiracy,</p>
<p>J. Mathrubootham

<h3 id="its-our-economy-not-her-genes-thatll-influence-kamala-harris-view-of-india">&ldquo;It’s our economy, not her genes, that’ll influence Kamala Harris’ view of India&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://d2c7ipcroan06u.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/re.png" alt="img">

<p>The excitement Joe Biden’s choice of Kamala Harris as his running mate has caused in India is understandable. She is half-Indian. Also, half-Jamaican and now a full American, but never mind. The big question is, because of her Indian origin, will she favour her ‘mother’ country, or be hostile to it to prove she is more American than Americans? This week, we are arguing why this is such a vacuous and nonsensical debate.</p>
<p>Whenever somebody with such a globalised genetic mix becomes famous, we Indians are quick to pronounce that the better half of her came from us, especially if the other parent hails from a smaller nation. As for Sunita Williams earlier, and now Kamala Harris. If it’s an Indian immigrant, whatever generation, anybody powerful, rich and famous is ours.</p>
<p>Montek Singh Ahluwalia would forgive me for using a line too brilliant to be repeated anonymously: In a cricket match, he said, there are batsmen and bowlers. But some spectators just jump in on the pitch whenever somebody scores a hundred. We Indians are often like that, he said.</p>
<p>I was in Class 9 at the humble Sanatan Dharma Higher Secondary School in Panipat in 1968 when Har Gobind Khorana won his Nobel Prize in medicine, and we claimed him as our own immediately. Our science teacher walked into the class beaming that morning claiming that “Har Gobind” wasn’t just his old school buddy, he (the teacher) was the brighter of the two, but couldn’t go to America due to family limitations. Khorana had been naturalised as an American in 1966.</p>
<p>We Indians are a large gene pool and we happily scatter it across the world. Which is a wonderful thing. But we become foreign then. Should Britain see Rishi Sunak and Priti Patel as Indians first? Or Bobby Jindal, Nikki Haley, Nisha Biswal and Richard Verma in America? However, it doesn’t stop so many of us in India from continuing to believe and insinuate passionately that the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, is a ‘bloody’ Pakistani.</p>
<p>The presumption that a naturalised foreign citizen will be inclined towards you, and have all her old beliefs of religion, caste, ethnicity and nationalism endorsed on her new passport, is very much a small-nationality complex. It is odd that the large, nuclear-powered nations of the subcontinent also wallow in it.</p>
<p>Many Pakistanis and Indians both think Ilhan Omar wants Kashmir to go to Pakistan because she’s Muslim. Or emphasise on Barack Obama’s middle name, Hussein. This also leads to a Moeen Ali or Monty Panesar being called ‘gaddar’ (traitor) in Pakistan or India respectively for their betrayal of getting our batsmen out. Of course, we prefer Charles Sobhraj to be French.</p>
<p>Good Journalism matters, more so in a crisis Coronavirus, economy, tension with China are events unrivalled in recent times. They demand clear, fair &amp; questioning reporting, writing &amp; pictures. ThePrint consistently brings you the stories that matter, from where they happen. We can sustain this only if you pay for what you read &amp; watch. SUBSCRIBE NOW</p>
<p>Also read: Kamala Harris is vocal on Kashmir, ‘unbreakable bond’ with India &amp; loves her idli-sambhar</p>
<p>This obsession with who is pro- or anti-India is particularly pronounced when it comes to American public figures. So, just as Kennedy was our best friend, Nixon was the worst enemy. And in which box would you put Bill Clinton? We will pick up this thread again soon.</p>
<p>From the late 1980s to the early 1990s, when India’s relations with the US were still taut and distant, New York Congressman Stephen Solarz emerged as the true champion of better ties with India. He was immediately hailed as a friend of India, or pro-India. It was variously attributed to his Indian immigrant voter base or his Jewish faith (India loves Israel loves India). Similarly, some, at various points of time have been called pro-Pakistan.</p>
<p>It was then that some of us got a tutorial from late Prof. Stephen P. Cohen. All of you err, he said, when you call Steve Solarz pro-India or someone else anti-India. “They are none of that,” he said. “They are pro-America.” It is just that one thinks better ties with India are good for the US and the other might prefer Pakistan.</p>
<p>That’s the test we need to apply to Kamala Harris now. It is OK for us all to carry stories and videos on her fine masala dosa-making skills, idli-sambar love, or as we notice on Tam-Brahm Twitter, Mylapore and Besant Nagar in Chennai fighting over who owns her. But to think that her view on India will be coloured by her DNA is nonsense.</p>
<p>The best thing about democracy is that by the time leaders reach a level where they begin to matter to you, there is enough spoken, printed and analysed about them to know where they are coming from.</p>
<p>There is no need, in that case, for reporters to keep chasing her Indian uncle with the same question: What will inform her approach to India, her origin or her commitment to human rights? She has spoken, written and acted enough on liberal, human rights issues. At the same time, she was the attorney general of California and tough as nails with criminals, many of them Black.</p>
<p>Also read: ‘Why did it take so long?’ Kamala Harris’ uncle in Delhi says not surprised by VP nomination</p>
<p>Once we make a new beginning, as we must, presuming Harris to be an American like any other, we can take this argument forward. And pick up that Bill Clinton thread. Was he a good American president for India or not? The answer is, both. In fact, in the long succession of post-Cold War US Presidents, he was the worst yet, in his first term, and the best, in his second.</p>
<p>His first term began while the dust had still not settled on the fall of the Berlin Wall. India, at that time, was going through a prolonged political and economic crisis. Between 1989 and 1991, we were already on to our fourth prime minister in P.V. Narasimha Rao.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1991, we were in the IMF’s darbar to borrow, and mortgaging our gold reserves. The Punjab insurgency was at its bloodiest, and Kashmir picked up too. The fightback by the Rao government was determined, if brutal. It brought a big push-back from the Western human rights community. The first Clinton Administration was caught up in it. That’s when even the accession of Kashmir to India was questioned.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, there was pressure from the non-proliferation lobby to get India off the nuclear kerb, ending with a widely popular belief that in the winter of 1995, Rao had wanted to carry out nuclear tests, but he was thwarted by Clinton. Remember, however, Clinton was still there, in his second term, when India did finally test, under Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 1998.</p>
<p>How that played out in India-US ties is very well documented, especially with the two key negotiators, Jaswant Singh and Strobe Talbott, writing books about it. From having threatened and ‘stopped’ India, to now easing it into the responsible nuclear weapons club, all happened under Clinton.</p>
<p>In 1999, he got the Pakistanis to behave on Kargil, and made a visit to the subcontinent where he spent no more than a few scores of minutes in Pakistan. All he did on that short stopover was to remind the Pakistanis, somewhat menacingly, that lines on the map of the subcontinent could no longer be redrawn in blood. Now, that wasn’t the Clinton of his first term.</p>
<p>What changed between Clinton’s two terms? Did he sit under some oak equivalent of the Bodhi Tree for his enlightenment? What changed was India’s economy, and thereby its global stature. The Rao-Manmohan reform began in the summer of 1991. From a perennial concern, India had transformed into a global opportunity. It was India that changed, not Clinton. He was still doing what he thought was best for America.</p>
<p>That is the lesson now. For India to have its stature and respect in global power capitals, it has to focus back on its economy, internal cohesion and external security. Our country has slipped back on all three in the past three years. Fans of the Modi government will contest this, but even they will concede that the economy has been in a free-fall for three years. What it looks like next January will influence Kamala Harris’s view on India, not her genetics. That is, if the Biden ticket wins.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.livelaw.in/h-upload/2020/07/25/378841-himachal-pradesh-high-court.jpg" alt="img">
The Himachal Pradesh High Court has observed that the Courts while granting bail should give a choice to the accused to either furnish surety bonds or give a cash deposit.</p>
<p>Choosing between sureties and deposits, accused is the Queen and let her be, Justice Anoop Chitkara said while granting bail to an accused. The judge also observed that the lawyers have duty to apprise the accused of the existence of the provision of a cash deposit in the Code of Criminal Procedure (Section 445 CrPC)</p>
<p>Abhishek Kumar Singh, accused of committing a white-collar crime, had approached the High Court seeking bail. During the course of hearing, the counsel for the accused in the event this bail petition is allowed, then such release should be on cash security instead of surety bonds because the accused does not know anyone who resides nearby to stand as surety. In the current situation, no one from West Bengal can travel to furnish surety bonds, he contended.</p>
<p>The court noted that the sole purpose of a bond is to ensure presence of accused to attend the trial. The purpose of a cash bond is not to enrich the State&rsquo;s coffers but to secure the accused&rsquo;s presence, it added. In this regard, the judge further said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The right to life guaranteed by Article 21 of India&rsquo;s Constitution includes the right to live with dignity. Begging or pestering before someone to stand as a surety, comes at the cost of pride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The court then surveyed precedents and summarized the principles of law relating to the choice of the accused to furnish surety bonds or secure recognizance by cash deposit as follows:</p>
<p>The object of requiring an accused to give security for his appearance in Court is not to secure the payment of money to the State. The principal purpose of bail is to secure that the accused person will return for trial if he is released after arrest, this consideration is not lost sight of in the provisions of section 445 of the Code. [Charles Shobhraj v. State, 1996 (63) DLT 91, Para 6 &amp; 7]. The discretionary power exercised by the Magistrate or the ::: Downloaded on - 06/08/2020 17:53:05 :::HCHP High Court of H.P. 15 Court, as the case may be, under sections 441 Cr.P.C., 1973 and 445 Cr.P.C., is mutually exclusive and not concurrent. [Endua @ Manoj Moharana v. State, 2018(72) Orissa Cri. R.611, Para 9]. A reading of the entire chapter which deals with the provisions relating to bail, does not say that when a person is released on bail, the Court can also insist upon him to give cash security. [Afsar Khan v. State by Girinagar Police, Bangalore, 1992 Cr.LJ 1676 (7), Para 7]. Court cannot demand cash deposit as a condition of bail. [Rajballam Singh v. Emperor, AIR 1943 Patna 375, Para 2]. e) The offer to make cash surety must come from the accused. [Sagayam @ Devasagayam v. State, 2017(3) MLJ (Cri) 134, Para 40]. If the accused wants to deposit any sum of money, it is open to the Court to accept the same. [State of Mysore v. H Venkatarama Kotaiyah, 1968 CrLJ 696, Para 4]. The Magistrate is not bound to accept cash, but may permit an accused person to deposit a sum of money. [R. R. Chari v. Emperor, 1948 AIR(All) 238, Para 4]. Cash deposit in lieu of execution of a bond by the accused is an alternative system of granting bail and can be stated to be no less efficacious than granting bail of certain amount with or without surety or sureties of the like amount. [Gokul Das v. The State of Assam, 1981 CrLJ 229, Para 14]. The cash deposit is equally efficacious as other system in view of Section 445 CrPC. [Maha Ahmad Yusuf v. State of U.P., 2015 (5) R.C.R.(Criminal) 13, Para 6]. This provision is meant for the benefit of the person who is required to execute a bond in case where he may not be able to find a surety. [Niamat Khan v. Crown, 1949 LawSuit (Nag) 42, Para 4]. The accused is a foreign national and is not able to furnish a local surety. The same does not debar her from being admitted to bail. [Shokhista v. State, 2005 LawSuit (Del) 1316, Para 5]. It is not the mandate of the Code that the Magistrate should insist on cash security additional to personal bond with or without sureties. [Parades Patra v. State of Orissa, 1994 (1) Crimes (HC) 109, Para 10].</p>
<p>The court further observed that the Cash surety improves the possibility of the accused&rsquo;s attendance.</p>
<p>We are already late in encouraging deposits in place of sureties. Cash surety improves the possibility of the accused&rsquo;s attendance because she is aware that her money is safe and accruing interest on FD. It is further likely to motivate her not to default even once, in contrast to the handing over of cash to stock sureties, with hardly any assurance of its refund. Given the advent of online identification, the pragmatic approach is that while granting bail with sureties, the Court should give a choice to the accused to either furnish surety bonds or give a fixed deposit, with a further option to switch over to another, impliedly informing the accused of the existence of her right under S. 445 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Choosing between sureties and deposits, accused is the Queen and let her be.</p>
<p>Advocate has onerous duty to apprise the accused of the existence of the provision of a cash deposit</p>
<p>The court further said:</p>
<p>An Advocate is an officer of the Court and a vigilant watcher of the interest of her client. Owing allegiance to the Constitution of India and being a professional, it&rsquo;s her onerous duty to apprise the accused of the existence of the provision of a cash deposit in the statute.</p>
<p>The court also observed that the bond amount must be reasonable. It said:</p>
<p>The Court has a formidable task of performing the tight rope locomotion by embarking on determination of the cash surety in consonance with the accused&rsquo;s monetary status. It should not be such as to precipitate the misery on the poor accused and deprive her of personal liberty despite being admitted to bail</p>
<p>The bench then disposed of the bail plea with the following direction:</p>
<p>Given above the petitioner shall be released on bail in the FIR mentioned above, subject to his furnishing a personal bond of Rs. One Lac only (INR 1,00,000/-), and shall either furnish two sureties of a similar amount to the satisfaction of the Chief Judicial Magistrate/Ilaqua Magistrate/Duty Magistrate/the Court exercising jurisdiction over the concerned Police Station where FIR is registered, or the aforesaid personal bond and fixed deposit(s) for Rs. One Lac only (INR 1,00,000/-), made in favour of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Reckongpeo, Kinnaur, H.P., from any of the banks where the stake of the State is more than 50%, or any of the stable private banks, e.g., HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, etc., with the clause of automatic renewal of principal, and liberty of the interest reverting to the linked account. Such Fixed Deposit need not necessarily be made from the account of the petitioner. If such a fixed deposit is made manually, then the original receipt has to be deposited. If made online, then the copy attested by any Advocate has to be filed, and the depositor shall get the online liquidation disabled. It shall be total discretion of the petitioner to choose between surety bonds and fixed deposits. During the trial&rsquo;s pendency, it shall be open for the petitioner to apply for substitution of fixed deposit with surety bonds and vice-versa. Subject to the proceedings under S. 446 CrPC, if any, the entire amount of fixed deposit along with interest credited, if any, shall be endorsed/returned to the depositor(s). The Court shall have a lien over the deposits until discharged by substitution, and otherwise up to the expiry of the period mentioned under S. 437-A CrPC, 1973</p>
<p>Sr Advocate Rajiv Jiwan, Advocates Anubhuti Sharma and Ragini Dogra assisted the Court as Amicus Curiae and Ms. Kalyani Acharya as Research Assistant. Advocate Vinod Chauhan appeared for the petitioner and Additional Advocate Genera Nand Lal Thakur for the state.</p>

<h3 id="june-25-1975july-25-2020-reflections-on-a-prison-in-delhi">&ldquo;June 25 1975/July 25 2020: Reflections on a Prison in Delhi&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Home &gt; 2020 &gt; June 25 1975/July 25 2020: Reflections on a Prison in Delhi | Uma (&hellip;)</p>
<p>These days news reports of arbitrary arrests, jails and jail conditions are a reminder of the sudden and dramatic imposition of the Emergency in 1975, when there was no recourse to legal remedy of any kind — no vakil, no daleel and no appeal — which became shorthand for the suspension of civil rights. Those who went to jail just stayed there until the end of the Emergency, when Indira Gandhi was swept out of power in the general elections of 1977. Despite substantial differences between then and now, the similarities are also striking. There had been widespread unrest in the years before the imposition of the Emergency. Students then, as now, were often on the roads for various reasons, especially in Gujarat, Bihar and Delhi. Women too had led the hugely successful anti-price rise movement, and thousands were on the streets in the years and months before June 1975 when the dramatic unseating of Mrs G triggered off panic in the establishment, leading to the declaration of the Emergency. A detailed recounting of those 19 months I will leave for another moment. Here, I want to recall the focus on jails in the months and years following the 1977 elections, a natural consequence of the new way state power was understood and sought to be checked by students, teachers, media persons, lawyers, judges and the intelligentsia. In Bengal the Bandi Mukti Morcha prepared lists of people in jail and campaigned for their release, making it an election issue first, and then ensuring that the newly elected state government released the prisoners without delay.</p>
<p>The civil and democratic rights movement in post-independent India was born in the aftermath of the Emergency. One of the issues taken up in Delhi was conditions in Tihar Jail. A jail reforms committee was set up by the PUCL &amp; DR,(People’s Union for Civil Liberties and Democratic Rights) and that is when I first stepped into a jail. It is the only time in my memory of Delhi when a jail reforms committee emanating from civil society was given official recognition and allowed to visit the jail to further the work of the committee. The team comprised Sudesh Vaid, Arun Shourie (then with the Indian Express), Gobindo Mukhoty (senior Supreme Court lawyer), and I.</p>
<p>Then, as now, it wasn’t easy to get into jail, so we worked through our links with the highest echelons of power. We worked through Leila Fernandes, George Fernandes’s wife, whom we had access to through common contacts. After some delays the permission came through, and so the team landed up in Tihar jail, the date of which I cannot remember, but it was some time in 1978-79. The Delhi jail, in my child’s memory, was located in what is now the Bahdur Shah Zafar Marg, and I recall seeing it as my family went past it seated in a tonga (the only working means of transport in Delhi in 1948-49), on our way to Minerva theatre to see S.S. Vasan’s Chandralekha. Tihar on the other hand was a way off from Sudesh and me, located as we were in north Delhi, so we co-ordinated with Arun Shourie, who gave us a ride in his car. We went to the Express office and drove for what appeared to be many miles to reach the gates of Tihar, firmly barred to the outside world with huge gates, and Mukhoty saheb met us there. We may have got permission through the highest quarters, but the jail is a jail, is a jail! Orchestration of what we could, or rather should, see was complete and comprehensive: we were taken to the jail superintendent’s office and given the jail ‘schpeel’: what a challenge it was to administer a bunch of lawbreakers and criminals, etc, etc, etc. High tea accompanied this account as we settled down to polite conversation on both sides, while we sussed out the possibilities of a &ldquo;real&rdquo; jail visit into the barred premises behind another iron gate. As the conversation proceeded, a very impressive looking Sikh gentleman, an epitome of gentleness and dignity served us the tea. When he left us we were told that he was serving a sentence for a murder, perhaps of his wife. That was lesson number one: &ldquo;criminals&rdquo; look and are like everyone else, like you and me – that includes their feelings too.</p>
<p>Finally, the polite conversation ended and we were let in through another set of gates. Years later, Srilata Swaminathan described her time in jail during the Emergency as being periodically marked by the clanging of gates — the opening and shutting — as each jail was barred from other spaces by a set of gates. She told us it was a sound that still haunted her. However, the significance of the association between the clanging of gates and confinement did not occur to me then. All I was aware of was that Tihar Jail had been the site of many famous arrestees of the Emergency, such as George Fernandes and C.G.K. Reddy (charged in what was known as the Baroda Conspiracy Case), many young student activists (such as Vijay Pratap, Sudhir Goel and Jasbir Singh; Sudhir and Jasbir had been badly tortured in police custody), socialists who were Lohiavadis, and a number of women political prisoners, including the two maharanis, the rajmata of Gwalior and the maharani of Jaipur – the latter wrote her memoirs, A Princess Remembers, some time later, which has a segment on her jail time. Since we were itching to go into the actual jail — the cells and barracks — we were finally allowed entry. Tihar had a special segment for women prisoners, which was a jail within the jail – corresponding to Minakhi Sen’s description of the women’s jail in her book, Jailer Bhitar Jail. While the two men went off into the compound leading to the main barracks and cells, Sudesh and I were led to the women’s prison.</p>
<p>I remember it as a fairly large barrack of sorts, which at that time housed about 30 women convicted for various crimes, including petty crimes. My recall is that there were a few murder convicts, but I do not recall anyone there in a 498A (dowry murders and cruelty clauses) type of case, obviously because dowry related crimes were not a specific category at that time. (The women’s jails across the country are swarming with such cases now.) As the women looked at us curiously — hardly anyone got into the jail, and the women’s jail at that — the women who were eager to engage us in a conversation then took over from the official guides allotted to us. They pointed out various spaces to us: the cells, the loos and the bathing area; where they could walk at specified times, which was carefully separated from where and when the men were let out. And then, as women do, we got into a free-wheeling conversation. The women were quite engaging, and so we got to know who was there for what offence. As part of this chatter, a young woman, just out of girlhood was pushed forward towards us and introduced as someone imprisoned for pickpocketing. Her friends then boasted that she was so deft at picking pockets that the unsuspecting victim would be totally unaware of what hit him or her. We, as urban genteel middle class women, teachers at that, scoffed at this claim, and so the young woman offered to give us a demonstration. Of course we wanted to see this for ourselves, so the young woman proceeded to pick our pockets. As the demonstration was given, and even as we knew she was going to pick one of our pockets, we felt not a thing till she triumphantly brandished what she had lifted. We exclaimed half in horror while she looked quite satisfied at this demonstration of her skills — and we all laughed good humouredly!</p>
<p>This was a set up and carefully steered visit, so we got no stories of torture, mis-management, corruption and violence. We said goodbye to the women and they called out to ask us if we would come again, and we said we would try, which of course did not happen as the Janata government itself fell before a second jail visit could be made. As we joined Mukhoty saheb in the general part of the prison, he was talking to a very young boy, an adolescent at that, and he was patting his back and saying, &ldquo;I would have done precisely that, main bhi aisa hi karta&rdquo;, which astounded the young undertrial for sure. Mukhoty saheb was known to be a very emotional man, so the statement was completely in character though it was ‘irresponsible’ by everyone else’s standards.</p>
<p>As we were leaving we finally got a taste of the power dynamics in jail. While being escorted towards the exit gates, we had to go past an anteroom of sorts where what we saw was quite a sight (for my naïve and law abiding eyes). It was the notorious criminal Charles Sobhraj, famed for his career of cheating, stealing and killing. I’m not sure that he was there as a convict or an undertrial, but whatever he was, he was lording over the place. (If you go online for Tihar jail you will find many accounts of Charles Sobhraj, including accounts of his exploits, some given even by jailors! He seems to be the most ’famous’ of the inmates of Tihar, and that tells us something about ourselves.) He had been given this private space where he and his then partner, who was probably also in the jail, were seated quite cosily in something of a clinch. For the jail staff still accompanying us this was not anything unusual, so we all just pretended not to see. Sobhraj’s money power needed no apology, it was there for all to see.</p>
<p>It was difficult to pretend not to have absorbed at what we saw next. On our way out of the main gates we had to go past the mulakat hall, and it was mulakat time. There were crowds of inmates on one side and literally hundreds of ‘visitors’, (family members) on the other. In those days there was only a single grilled barricade, unlike the two parallel barriers that we now see in some jails. This single ‘wall’ had one-inch-square grills of strong but thin wires, which also had larger open squares — I’m, not sure for what. But the sight was unforgettable. Desperate women, children and old men trying to speak to each other across the barricade, which one could hardly hear as everyone was desperately shouting over the din in order to be heard. Some leaned on their toes, others crouched, so that there were at least three layers of men and women across the barricade. Fingers reached out through the wired wall, clutching at each other on the other side to feel the touch of the other person: a child’s finger kissed, a gesture made, a small display of human emotion that the ‘criminals’ and their loved ones were denied. Forever afterwards that is what the prison is to me — a space drained of humanity that the yoga classes Kiran Bedi introduced cannot rewrite.</p>
<p>And so, now, as Covid rages, I think of all the people we know who are in jail in various cases — such as Bhima Koregaon, anti-CAA protests, or the Delhi riots cases of today – whose loved ones cannot visit them. While the rest of us are ’locked in’ with our families, the state has locked these prisoners away from their families, with no visits, not even phone calls in many cases. There is anxiety and anguish all around. In the less than two minutes call allowed to the 81 year old Varavara Rao his daughter has reported with extreme anguish that all she could glean from the call was that he was in a state of acute medical distress but a vengeful state is beyond the reach of decency so all bail pleas are just rejected without even a pretence of consideration. And now he has the Covid. If Varavara Rao were to die in jail it would be tantamount to serving a death sentence upon him without even a trial.</p>
<p>We have not just locked up people; indeed, we have locked out humanity. This is what I will remember the time of the Covid for.

<p><img src="https://assets.telegraphindia.com/telegraph/d69a4fb6-804e-4a72-a1a6-d2b583ff554f.jpg" alt="img">
The Serpent: New BBC drama recounts the capture of serial killer Charles Sobhraj, at one time Interpol’s most wanted man The BBC has made an eight-part TV drama on Sobhraj in a co-production with Netflix</p>
<p>| | Published 23.01.20, 08:32 AM</p>
<p>Remember Charles Sobhraj? He was the Indian origin serial killer who was locked up in Tihar Jail from 1976 to 1997 and who has been described variously as a thief, fraudster, psychopath, and as someone who was “devilishly handsome” with a “cunning and cultured personality” but who “used his attractiveness to his advantage in his criminal career”. The BBC, which has made an eight-part TV drama on Sobhraj in a co-production with Netflix - as it did with Dracula - sums up: “Charles Sobhraj was the chief suspect in the unsolved murders of up to 20 young western travellers across India, Thailand and Nepal through 1975 and 1976. A master of disguise, having slipped repeatedly from the grasp of authorities worldwide, by 1976 serial killer Sobhraj was Interpol’s most wanted man and had arrest warrants on three different continents.”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The drama is called The Serpent after one of the nicknames Sobhraj was given. He was also called “the Bikini Killer” because of the attire of one of his many victims. “Inspired by real events, The Serpent tells the remarkable story of how Sobhraj was captured,” the BBC reveals. Sobhraj, now serving a life sentence in Nepal, was born Hatchand Bhaonani Gurumukh Charles Sobhraj on April 6, 1944, in Saigon to a Sindhi father, Sobhraj Hatchand Bhaonani, and a Vietnamese woman, Tran Loang Phun. But after his parents split up, he was adopted by his mother’s new boyfriend, a French army lieutenant stationed in French Indochina, and brought up in Paris, where he began his life of crime at an early age. Sobhraj will be played by the internationally renowned Tahar Rahim, who was cast in The Looming Tower, a drama about the Al Qaeda attack on the World Trade Center, as Ali Soufan, a Muslim Lebanese-American FBI agent. In 2010, Rahim attracted attention in Cannes in Jacques Audiard’s A Prophet in which he played a young French man of Algerian descent, sentenced to six years in prison for attacking police officers. “I am thrilled to play Charles Sobhraj in The Serpent, a role I have dreamed of portraying since I read a book about him when I was seventeen years old,” said Rahim, who has been made up to look uncannily like Sobhraj did during the latter’s court appearances in India over 40 years ago.</p>
<p>Jenna Coleman, best known in Britain for playing Queen Victoria and being an assistant to Dr Who, looks unrecognisable and chilling even playing the role of Marie-Andrée Leclerc, Sobhraj’s partner in crime. She said the story “intoxicated me into the dark seductive world of Charles Sobhraj”, adding: “I’m so looking forward to delving into hippie trail depths and bringing to life this unfathomable real life story.”

The walk, the smile, the charisma and the arrogance reeked of Sobhraj.

He was caught by Pakistani rangers near Kasur and claimed he had crossed over the border in an inebriated state. The Pakistani police initially charged him for trespassing but later accused him of being an Indian terrorist. He spent 22 years in jail, from 1991 till his death in 2013. Various mercy petitions were filed on his behalf but all got rejected. Even the intervention of the Government of India wasn’t enough to get him freed. He was killed by prison inmates, some say as retaliation towards the hanging of Afzal Guru. The film is told from the viewpoint of Sarbjit’s sister. Randeep’s physical transformation for the film boggles the mind. The gradual degradation of a prisoner rotting in jail for 22 years is brought before our eyes through Hooda&rsquo;s intense portrayal. While we express our horror at the ravaged body, we also rejoice that his mind retained its sanity, its positivity despite all hardships.
