When Paige Spiranac first opened up about personal and professional hardships on her “Playing A Round” podcast, she never could have imagined the influx of responses that have since poured in.</p>
<p>“At the very beginning, I didn’t think that I would have those responses. I knew there were certain things that I definitely wanted to talk about, like never being accepted in the golf industry, and then the nude picture was something I wanted to discuss,” Spiranac told The Post recently.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know how any of that would be accepted by other people, but as those episodes have come out, the response has been overwhelming.”</p>
<p>With over 2.3 million Instagram followers and counting, fans have embraced Spiranac’s transparency both on and off the golf course. Earlier this year, the 26-year-old recounted one of the most difficult parts of her past, grappling with a nude photo scandal, and the anxious emotions that followed.</p>
<p>“When I talked about the nude picture, I got thousands and thousands of messages from men and women who could relate or guys who didn’t know how this made women feel,” Spiranac said.</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect that response, I was shocked by it. It was overwhelming in such a positive way and it made me realize that even though telling these stories is really difficult, they do make an impact and so it’s worth it in the end.”</p>
<p>The topics on Spiranac’s show are sometimes planned, but when she and co-host Josh Temple “start talking, we never stick to anything.”</p>
<p>“It takes so many twists and turns, which is really fun ’cause we kinda just let the conversation flow,” Spiranac explained.</p>
<p>Among the topics Spiranac has discussed is fitting into the golf community.</p>
<p>“Golf is a very male-dominated sport and being a young female, it’s hard to find people you connect with, and since there’s not a lot of women, the women are also very competitive with each other and so it can be a very toxic environment at times,” she said.</p>
<p>Though Spiranac struggled when she played professionally — “it’s very lonely out on the road, you don’t really have anyone there” — she hopes by speaking candidly about her own experiences, it opens a door to further conversations.</p>
<p>“I want to speak out about it because I get messages from people saying, ‘I don’t feel comfortable being a woman going to a golf course,’ or ‘I don’t feel comfortable ’cause I look different than everyone else going to a golf course,’ and so I want to bring attention to that and not a lot of people in golf are talking about it,” she said.</p>
<p>While Spiranac has endured criticism in the past for her ensembles, it has not deterred her passion for the game.</p>
<p>“I think that golf is getting a lot better, I will say that,” she said. “I also want to focus on that side of it and not, ‘Golf is horrible, golf is all of these things,’ because golf is so great and that’s why I continue to play it.”</p>
<p>As the podcast episodes keep rolling, Spiranac hopes to converse with other guests who “have an interesting story” to share.</p>
<p>“I think we just want people with interesting stories and something to say,” she said.

<p>Paige Spiranac says she’s been overwhelmed by the support she’s received - from men and women - after opening up about a horrifying nude photo ordeal recently.</p>
<p>Speaking on her new podcast Playing-A-Round, the professional golfer recently revealed how she felt ‘violated’ when compromising photos of her were circulated online.</p>
<p>‘NEED TO STOP’: Female athletes expose disgusting side of sport shutdown</p>
<p>The 26-year-old said she sent a photo to the man she was dating, who then forwarded it on to other friends.</p>
<p>The divisive golfer also took aim at the ‘elitist’ nature of golf, lifting the lid on some of the sexist treatment she’s received throughout her career.</p>
<p>Spiranac hasn’t been able to live up to the hype on the golf course, but has amassed a staggering Instagram following of over 2.1 million people.</p>
<p>She often comes in for criticism for her social media activity, however she says she was ‘shocked’ by the positive response to her new podcasts.</p>
<p>“When I talked about the nude picture, I got thousands and thousands of messages from men and women who could relate or guys who didn’t know how this made women feel,” Spiranac told the New York Post on Thursday.</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect that response, I was shocked by it. It was overwhelming in such a positive way and it made me realise that even though telling these stories is really difficult, they do make an impact and so it’s worth it in the end.</p>
<p>“At the very beginning, I didn’t think that I would have those responses. I knew there were certain things that I definitely wanted to talk about, like never being accepted in the golf industry, and then the nude picture was something I wanted to discuss.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know how any of that would be accepted by other people, but as those episodes have come out, the response has been overwhelming.”</p>

<p>Spiranac’s ‘horrible’ ordeal after photo circulated</p>
<p>If it wasn’t bad enough that Spiranac’s photo was shared to her partner’s friends, she then started receiving messages from complete strangers who had seen it.</p>
<p>“It was horrible,” Spiranac said. “Just getting these random messages from people you don’t know and they’ve seen you in such a vulnerable way. It was disgusting.”</p>
<p>The American golfer broke down in tears on the podcast as she recounted how the person she sent the photo to blamed her for the ordeal.</p>
<p>“When I finally confronted the guy and said, ‘I can’t believe you did this to me’, he said — and I’ll never forget this — ‘You are the sl*t who sent it to me’,” she said. “He said, ‘You deserve this’.”</p>
<p>“I would wake up every single day, I would check my phone and be like, ‘Am I going to be on TMZ today?</p>
<p>“That was the worst part. I was constantly stressed out that someone was going to see it and someone was going to get it and that it was going to get out.”</p>
<p>Spiranac’s years-long battle with trolls</p>
<p>Spiranac also broke down in tears at a press conference before a tournament in 2016 after receiving online threats that more photos would be published online.</p>
<p>“I think it’s really important…people need to see how much it actually does affect me, and the things they call me,” Spiranac said at the time.</p>
<p>Her invitation to play at Dubai Ladies European Tour events in 2015 and 2016 sparked global headlines that kicked off a challenging period in her life.</p>
<p>One of the top players in women&rsquo;s golf, Laura Davis, commented at the time: “If she&rsquo;s here for any other reason than she&rsquo;s a great golfer, then it&rsquo;s a little bit pointless.”</p>
<p>“People seem to think I got where I am because of the clothes that I wear. That&rsquo;s unfair to me and unfair to all of my accomplishments,” Spiranac said.</p>
<p>“I probably do more community service than any other professional golfer. For people to say: &lsquo;You only show some cleavage, that&rsquo;s why you have what you have,&rsquo; is unfair.</p>
<p>“That&rsquo;s the injustice that we face every day as women and I see it a lot in golf.”</p>
<p>The 24-year-old has now taken some time away from golf to focus on a media career and her anti-bullying charity work.</p>
<p>She is an ambassador for Cybersmile, educating young people about the dangers of cyber-bullying.

<h3 id="paige-spiranac-im-a-golf-outcast-because-of-my-cleavage">Paige Spiranac: I’m a golf outcast because of ‘my cleavage’</h3>
<p><img src="https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/30920-paige-.spiranac-maind.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="img">
Paige Spiranac is proud of who she is and how she dresses, and won’t apologize to the golf community for it.</p>
<p>“It’s like my whole life I’m trying to find a place where I can fit in and that I feel comfortable and that I feel at peace with myself and I haven’t found that. Golf is the absolute worst place for me to be because I am the exact opposite of everything that a golfer should encompass, should be, and I’m not,” the 26-year-old Instagram sensation recently shared on her “Playing A Round” podcast, according to News.com.au.</p>
<p>She continued, “I’m not refined, I’m raw and real and I wear what I want and I have always been so different and golf is not that way.”</p>
<p>Spiranac, who starred at San Diego State and previously competed in the Omega Dubai Ladies Masters in December 2016, also vented her frustrations over golf’s “hypocrisy.”</p>
<p>“I feel like everyone in golf is just playing this part of this perfect golfer when in reality it’s nothing like that,” she explained, also addressing the backlash she endured over her outfit choices, which she regularly shares with her 2.2 million Instagram followers.</p>
<p>“I wear a tank top and I’m the s–t and I’m the w—e and I’m the one that’s ruining the game,” she said.</p>
<p>see also Golfer relives the hell of &lsquo;horrible&rsquo; nude photo scandal Paige Spiranac may be an open book to her 2.1&hellip;</p>
<p>Spiranac said her offer to help a charity was recently rejected and claimed they told her that her reputation was the reason why.</p>
<p>“I wanted to help this charity out and I wanted to give them free golf clubs,” she said. “The guy wrote back and said, ‘We would love to but, because of the way our board members view you, you can’t help out.’</p>
<p>“I want to give back to these kids who don’t have anything, because I grew up not having anything, and I can’t even f–king do that because of my cleavage. We bond over having a common interest and we all love the same thing … I don’t understand why it matters if you’re wearing a polo (shirt) and I’m not wearing a polo. If a guy on tour wears shorts instead of pants, the world’s not going to end. In golf, people make all of these problems so serious and it’s not serious.”</p>
<p>Spiranac has long been candid about the criticism she’s endured, telling the Guardian in January 2018, “People seem to think I got where I am because of the clothes that I wear.”</p>
<p>“That’s unfair to me and unfair to all of my accomplishments,” she told the outlet. “I probably do more community service than any other professional golfer. For people to say, ‘You only show some cleavage, that’s why you have what you have,’ is unfair. That’s the injustice that we face every day as women and I see it a lot in golf.”</p>
<p>While Spiranac has had to overcome a series of tribulations in recent years, including a nude photo scandal, she learned to embrace her body and sent a message to haters in 2018 with a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit shoot.</p>
<p>“I took back my body. I took back my sexuality,” she said at the time.
