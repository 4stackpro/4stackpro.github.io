(CNN) The US is monitoring intelligence that suggests North Korea&rsquo;s leader, Kim Jong Un , is in grave danger after undergoing a previous surgery, according to a US official with direct knowledge.</p>
<p>A second source familiar with the intelligence told CNN that the US has been closely monitoring reports on Kim&rsquo;s health.</p>
<p>Kim recently missed the celebration of his grandfather&rsquo;s birthday on April 15, which raised speculation about his well-being. He had been seen four days before that at a government meeting.</p>
<p>Another US official told CNN Monday that the concerns about Kim&rsquo;s health are credible but the severity is hard to assess.</p>
<p>National Security Adviser Robert O&rsquo;Brien said the US is &ldquo;keeping a close eye&rdquo; on reports about Kim&rsquo;s health.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re monitoring these reports very closely,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Brien said during an interview with Fox News Tuesday. &ldquo;As you know, North Korea is a very closed society,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Later on Tuesday, a US defense official said that the US military assessment is that while they are examining reports regarding Kim&rsquo;s poor health, the evidence at this point does not suggest he is incapacitated.</p>
<p>Daily NK, an online newspaper based in South Korea that focuses on North Korea, reports that Kim reportedly received a cardiovascular system procedure on April 12.</p>
<p>Kim received the cardiovascular system procedure because of &ldquo;excessive smoking, obesity, and overwork,&rdquo; according to the news site, and is now receiving treatment in a villa in Hyangsan County following his procedure.</p>
<p>After assessing that Kim&rsquo;s condition had improved, most of the medical team treating him returned to Pyongyang on April 19 and only part of them remained to oversee his recovery situation, according to the news site. CNN is unable to independently confirm the report.</p>
<p>A South Korean source told CNN Monday that the country&rsquo;s top leaders are very much aware of reports about Kim&rsquo;s health status but cannot independently verify details published by Daily NK. The source acknowledged that Kim&rsquo;s issues related to weight and smoking are well known but made clear they are waiting for more information.</p>
<p>South Korea&rsquo;s Presidential Blue House said in a statement provided to reporters that they have nothing to confirm on reports about Kim&rsquo;s health and that &ldquo;no unusual signs&rdquo; have been detected inside North Korea.</p>
<p>South Korea&rsquo;s Unification Ministry and Defense Ministry have given a &ldquo;no comment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The National Security Council and Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment when reached by CNN on Monday. CNN has also reached out to the CIA and the State Department for comment.</p>
<p>In the meantime, US officials have been reaching out to North Korean experts &ndash; particularly those who have studied the Kim regime &ndash; to talk about contingency planning, a third source familiar with the communications told CNN.</p>
<p>Still, the situation remains murky as gathering intelligence out of North Korea is notoriously difficult &ndash; one of the most challenging targets for US intelligence.</p>
<p>North Korea tightly controls any information surrounding its leader, who is treated almost like a deity within the country. His absences from official state media often spark speculation and rumors about his health. North Korea has no free press and is often a black hole when it comes to the country&rsquo;s leadership. Analysts are heavily reliant on scanning state media dispatches and watching propaganda videos for any semblance of a clue.</p>
<p>Kim last appeared in North Korean state media on April 11. April 15 &ndash; North Korea&rsquo;s most important holiday, the anniversary of the birth of the country&rsquo;s founding father, Kim Il Sung &ndash; came and went without any official mention of Kim Jong Un&rsquo;s movements.</p>
<p>Experts are unsure of what to make of Kim&rsquo;s absence from any festivities celebrating his grandfather. When North Korean leaders have not shown up to these important celebrations in the past, it has portended major developments. But it has also turned out to be nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There have been a number of recent rumors about Kim&rsquo;s health (smoking, heart, and brain). If Kim is hospitalized, it would explain why he wasn&rsquo;t present on the important April 15th celebrations,&rdquo; said Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation and former CIA deputy division chief for North Korea. &ldquo;But, over the years, there have been a number of false health rumors about Kim Jong-un or his father. We&rsquo;ll have to wait and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim Jong Il&rsquo;s absence from a parade celebrating North Korea&rsquo;s 60th anniversary in 2008 was followed by rumblings that he was in poor health. It was later revealed he had a stroke, after which his health continued to decline until his death in 2011.</p>
<p>Kim Jong Un disappeared from the public eye for more than a month in 2014, which also prompted speculation about his health. He returned sporting a cane, and days later South Korean intelligence said that he had a cyst removed from his ankle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to be wrong on this one,&rdquo; said John Delury, a professor of international relations at Yonsei University in Seoul.</p>
<p>Still, with concerns about Kim&rsquo;s health mounting, the state of US-South Korean relations has US officials worried, sources tell CNN.</p>
<p>On Monday, President Donald Trump said the two countries have a &ldquo;great relationship,&rdquo; but added he wants them to pay more for the US presence in the country. The two countries have missed multiple deadlines for those negotiations. And now in-person negotiations are hindered because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<h3 id="kim-jong-uns-train-possibly-spotted-at-north-korean-resort">Kim Jong-un&rsquo;s train possibly spotted at North Korean resort</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4ea25d4e4abacb1299731119ac80ac2cb3c3a86/0_270_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=940a033a5dcd73620e727d8272b65b01" alt="img">
As rumours persist that ruler is in poor health, satellite images emerge showing train parked at Wonsan’s ‘leadership station’</p>
<p>A special train possibly belonging to the North Korean ruler, Kim Jong-un, has been spotted at a resort town, according to satellite images reviewed by a Washington-based North Korea monitoring project, amid conflicting reports about Kim’s health and whereabouts.</p>
<p>The monitoring project, 38 North, said in its report on Saturday that the train was parked at the “leadership station” in Wonsan on 21 April and 23 April. The station is reserved for the use of the Kim family, it said.</p>
<p>Though the group said it was probably Kim’s train, Reuters has not been able to confirm that independently, or whether he was in Wonsan.</p>
<p>“The train’s presence does not prove the whereabouts of the North Korean leader or indicate anything about his health but it does lend weight to reports that Kim is staying at an elite area on the country’s eastern coast,” the report said.</p>

<p>Speculation about Kim’s health first arose due to his absence from the anniversary of the birthday of North Korea’s founding father and Kim’s grandfather, Kim Il-sung, on 15 April.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Kim missed another national holiday, North Korea’s Military Foundation Day, further fuelling speculation about his health.</p>
<p>According to a report in Newsweek, US intelligence has seen no sign of unusual military activity in the reclusive regime but are continuing to monitor the situation closely.</p>
<p>Newsweek quoted a senior unnamed Pentagon official as saying: “We have observed no indications or received any additional information to make a conclusive assessment on the status of North Korean leadership or health of Kim Jong-un.”</p>
<p>But the official went on to say the presence of the train in Wonsan and Kim’s absence from recent events leant credibility to reports of his ill-health. Kim’s status meant North Korea could conceivably delay announcing his death to ensure security measures were in place, the official said.</p>
<p>North Korea’s state media last reported on Kim’s whereabouts when he presided over a meeting on 11 April.</p>

<p>China has dispatched a team including medical experts to North Korea to advise on Kim, according to three people familiar with the situation.</p>
<p>A third-generation hereditary leader who came to power after his father’s death in 2011, Kim has no clear successor in a nuclear-armed country, which could present major international risk.</p>
<p>Kim’s sister, Kim Yo-jong, has recently emerged as a powerful force within the regime, while others being mentioned by international observers include premier Kim Jae-ryong, who conducted a number of site visits around the country on Friday.</p>
<p>On Thursday the US president, Donald Trump, played down reports that Kim was ill. “I think the report was incorrect,” Trump told reporters, but he declined to say if he had been in touch with North Korean officials.</p>
<p>Trump has met Kim three times in an attempt to persuade him to give up a nuclear weapons programme that threatens the US as well as its Asian neighbours. While talks have stalled, Trump has continued to hail Kim as a friend.</p>
<p>Reporting from inside North Korea is notoriously difficult because of tight controls on information. A Trump administration official said days of North Korean media silence on Kim’s whereabouts had heightened concerns about his condition.</p>
<p>The US State Department did not immediately respond to questions about the situation on Saturday.</p>

<p>Daily NK, a Seoul-based website that reports on North Korea, cited one unnamed source in North Korea on Monday as saying that Kim had undergone medical treatment in the resort county of Hyangsan north of the capital, Pyongyang.</p>
<p>It said that Kim was recovering after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure on 12 April.</p>
<p>Since then, multiple South Korean media reports have cited unnamed sources saying that Kim might be staying in the Wonsan area.</p>
<p>On Friday the local news agency Newsis cited South Korean intelligence sources as reporting that a special train for Kim’s use had been seen in Wonsan, while Kim’s private plane remained in Pyongyang.</p>
<p>Newsis reported Kim may be sheltering from Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>Kim, believed to be 36, has disappeared from coverage in North Korean state media before. In 2014 he vanished for more than a month and North Korean state TV later showed him walking with a limp.</p>
<p>Speculation about his health has been fanned by his heavy smoking, apparent weight gain since taking power and family history of cardiovascular problems.
