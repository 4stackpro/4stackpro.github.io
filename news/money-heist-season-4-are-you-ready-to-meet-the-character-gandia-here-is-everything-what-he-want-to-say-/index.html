<p>Our Review: 3.8/5</p>
<p>Mitta is one of the best Tamil web series to watch in recent times. It is a dark comedy show that will leave you on your wit’s end but keep you thinking at the same time. The story revolves around four characters and takes you on a roller coaster ride. The character of Sathu’s girlfriend is who sparks all the commotion and leaves people in a state of a pickle.

<p>If you want to watch some light-hearted comedy but with a strong message behind it, American Mappillai is one of the best shows that you can binge-watch. This does have a very strong message behind it but at the same time, you wouldn’t feel anything too much in your face.</p>
<p>The story revolves around the life of Ganesh who is being constantly nagged by his father to get married. Tired of his father’s constant persistence about that, he decides to tell his father that he is gay. The unique thing about this show is the connection with colour.
