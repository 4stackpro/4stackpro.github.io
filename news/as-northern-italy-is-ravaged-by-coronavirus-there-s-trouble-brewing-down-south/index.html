(CNN) Four weeks into a nationwide lockdown , very few Italians are still singing from their balconies or banging pots and pans in solidarity. Instead, flags were lowered to half-staff this week for the nearly 15,000 coronavirus victims including doctors, nurses and health care professionals who have perished since February 23.</p>
<p>The lockdown, which was originally scheduled to end Friday, April 3, has now been extended to beyond Easter, and Italians from north to south are nearing a breaking point just as the draconian measures have begun to show signs of stopping the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p>Italy&rsquo;s wealthy northern provinces have taken the brunt of the coronavirus outbreak with more than 75% of overall cases and deaths north of Tuscany, in the center of the country, per the Italian Civil Protection agency.</p>
<p>More than 10,000 health care workers in the northern provinces have been infected with the virus, according to the Italian Doctor&rsquo;s Federation, as a lack of proper protective gear made contagion inside healthcare facilities a contributor to the rampant spread. Some of the best health structures in all of Europe are in northern Italy, but they were pushed to near collapse with the sheer number of Covid-19 patients in need of urgent care.</p>
<p>Had the initial infection cluster started in the poorer southern regions, which do not have the same strong infrastructure, no one disputes that the crisis would have been even worse.</p>
<p>But the southern regions are struggling, too. The so-called &ldquo;mezzogiorno&rdquo; is where organized crime syndicate hubs are based and where unemployment hovers around 20% for adults and up to 50% for those under 24 during the best of times, according to figures from the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT). Even with the outbreak in some southern communities affecting &ldquo;only&rdquo; a few thousand, the facilities are stretched and care for non-Covid patients has been severely compromised.</p>
<p>With a huge part of the southern population working in the so-called &ldquo;black economy&rdquo; off the books, a whole segment of people lost jobs for which they cannot legally claim unemployment benefits. Those who do have legitimate employment have been given a path to ask for the suspension of some bills, but black economy workers &ndash; of whom there are an estimated 3.7 million, according to ISTAT &ndash; have no such outlet for relief.</p>
<p>Almost every grocery store in Italy now has a cart at the front where people who can still afford groceries are encouraged to donate items for those who cannot. In apartment blocks across the country, there are continuous reports of care packages deposited in front of the doors of people who have lost their jobs by neighbors and police officers.</p>
<p>One law enforcement official in Palermo donated his entire monthly salary, around $2,100, to buy groceries for everyone at a grocery store he was in last week, Palermo police confirmed to CNN.</p>
<p>But for all the kindhearted compassion this virus has inspired, there are at least as many troubling signs that as the pandemic subsides, the worst could be yet to come. Police in the southern province of Puglia say that a food delivery truck was hijacked on the main highway near the port town of Bari last week, Bari police confirmed to CNN.</p>
<p>The driver was unharmed, but when the truck was found, every single item was gone. Many grocery stores now have security guards out front when new merchandise is unloaded to stop people from running up to grab basic supplies like boxes of pasta and cans of tomatoes.</p>
<p>A few days after the Puglia hijacking, police were called after 20 people filled their carts at a Lidl supermarket in Palermo on the island of Sicily, and refused to pay. Col. Michele Monti responded to the call and told CNN that while he viewed it as an &ldquo;isolated incident&rdquo; the message was clear. &ldquo;If this situation continues without the help of the government, we won&rsquo;t be able to feed our children,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was a message that they wanted to be understood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The incident ended peacefully. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t violent, and the 20 people filled their carts said they didn&rsquo;t want to pay so we intervened and they calmly left without the food,&rdquo; Monti told CNN. &ldquo;We here in Palermo also activated ourselves after this. We knew that many people, for their own dignity, wouldn&rsquo;t have asked for help but would need it. We know that a lot of this need was being hidden, so it was our initiative to support everyone.&rdquo; They have prepared care packages, left food at door steps and made sure high-risk people have medicine they need so they don&rsquo;t have to leave their homes.</p>
<p>Palermo Mayor Leoluca Orlando told CNN that he has petitioned the government in Rome for a &ldquo;survival income&rdquo; to give to citizens left behind without the desperate help they need. The municipality now lists places where people who need basic supplies and food can go for help and several companies prepare care packages in lieu of giving cash handouts to ensure people are buying food.</p>
<p>Orlando is concerned that his city government will not have the means to compete with a far greater source of help for the needy. He and others warn that organized crime groups are waiting in the wings to exploit the situation by offering help in exchange for new recruits as foot soldiers when the crisis is over. He points a number of private Facebook groups including one called National Revolution, now calling for mass protests in the streets and sharing details about easy-to-break-into shops. &ldquo;The mafia is fanning the flames and will soon ignite this fire,&rdquo; he told CNN, after he wrote about his fears on his blog. &ldquo;We need to quell it before it leads to violence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On a recent post by the National Revolution group, anonymous vigilantes call for everyone to gather in the streets of Palermo to protest that rents, mortgages and other utility bills have not been suspended for those who work in the black economy and who cannot prove they&rsquo;ve lost their jobs.</p>
<p>Anti-mafia prosecutor Federico De Raho told CNN that social unease is the breeding ground for social unrest. &ldquo;The Camorra, &lsquo;Ndrangheta and Mafia are all there to offer services to those who are suffering, giving them what they need in order to demand to be paid back later with interest,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We have seen this in other emergency situations, these criminal groups are there to exploit the situation. This will be no different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De Raho also says these groups are promoting violence against authorities and encouraging disgruntled and vulnerable people, especially petty criminals, to organize themselves to stage break-ins and wreak other havoc. He says that when the country eventually comes out of the lockdown, the criminal groups will be there to loan money and fill the vacuum left by the over-extended state. &ldquo;If the state does not intervene with the right economic support at the right time, the businesses will have no option but take help where they can get it. The mafias are there ready to invest their money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has promised around $440 million in food vouchers to those in need, and a further $4.5 billion in aid to regional mayors to help vulnerable people in their communities. But the consortium of Italian mayors has complained that the $4.5 billion had already been earmarked to be delivered in May before the pandemic swept Italy, and that it cannot now be retargeted as part of the crisis support.</p>
<p>As the pressure from the pandemic calms in the north, there are still concerns that it could explode in the south if disgruntled people start defying the lockdown in greater numbers, which would add even more misery to an already miserable situation for everyone.

<h3 id="bodies-are-being-left-in-the-streets-in-an-overwhelmed-ecuadorian-city">Bodies are being left in the streets in an overwhelmed Ecuadorian city</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200403111850-01-guayaquil-ecuador-coronavirus-0402-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) The streets of Ecuador&rsquo;s western city of Guayaquil are deserted, with few residents in sight &ndash; and a few dead, as bodies are being left in the streets of this overwhelmed place.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic is overloading the public services in the country&rsquo;s most populous city to a point of collapse. Hospitals have no beds left to accept sick patients, and morgues, cemeteries and funeral homes are straining. With no place left to put them, some residents say they have no choice but placing them outside.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear how many of the deceased are dying because of Covid-19. Many families say their loved ones had symptoms of the virus, while others only know the ill were unable to be treated at Guayaquil&rsquo;s overwhelmed hospitals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have been waiting for five days,&rdquo; Fernando Espana said in a video obtained by Reuters on March 30, as he complained about the struggles to have authorities come pick up his family member.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are tired of calling 911 and the only thing they tell us is to wait, they are working to solve this,&rdquo; he continues as he moves the camera through a window to show a black plastic-wrapped shape inside the home, with two fans blowing on it.</p>
<p>A coffin containing the body of a person who is supposed to have died from Covid-19 lays wrapped in plastic and covered with cardboard, outside a block of family apartments in Guayaquil on April 2.</p>
<p>The smell is too much to take. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the odor from the body that one can no longer handle,&rdquo; Espana&rsquo;s neighbor, Glenda Larrea Vera says in the same video, from across the street and behind a mask. &ldquo;And we also have neighbors that are elderly. I have my mother who is 80 who is also having respiratory problems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Video surveillance from last week obtained by CNN shows a motorcyclist abandon a body in the street. Hours later, a group of people, dressed in special hazmat suits are seen picking up the deceased, then driving off in a vehicle.</p>
<p>In another video obtained by CNN, a group of people remove a body from a car. Covered in face masks, they wrap the body in a what appears to be a black tarp when a police vehicle approaches minutes later. A conversation takes place and the group puts the body back into the car. Police tell CNN they could not offer details about the video.</p>
<p>National figures show that Ecuador&rsquo;s authorities have collected more than 300 bodies from private homes in the city &ndash; which has 2.99 million residents, according to the CIA Factbook &ndash; between March 23-30.</p>
<p>The city is on the Guayas River and is the nation&rsquo;s major port. Brittanica.com calls it the country&rsquo;s most economically important city.</p>
<p>Jorge Wated, head of a joint military task force created to deal with Ecuador&rsquo;s coronavirus crisis, in a televised interview on Wednesday said that his task force had gone from &ldquo;taking away 30 deceased per day to 150&rdquo; over the past three days. Wated added that this was &ldquo;independent of the hard work reactivated by the private funeral homes and graveyards in the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Men with protective suits load a coffin into a car in front of a Guayaquil hospital.</p>
<p>Guayaquil&rsquo;s mayor Cynthia Viteri has desperately begged for help from the national government in a video posted to her Twitter account last week. &ldquo;What is happening in the country&rsquo;s public health system? They are not taking away the dead from houses, they&rsquo;re leaving them on the sidewalks, they&rsquo;re falling in front of hospitals. No one wants to pick them up,&rdquo; she said, adding later, &ldquo;we need to know the causes of why people are dying in their homes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happens with our sick too?&rdquo; she adds. &ldquo;The families roam throughout the city knocking on doors so they can be taken care of or that a public hospital receives them where there are no more beds and they close the door and leave them outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With hospitals beyond capacity, some people are dying as they wait for medical care. One Guayaquil woman died in a wheelchair at a hospital while waiting to be seen in an emergency room. According to a hospital source who asked not to be identified, there were no beds available and her body was left out for almost four hours before it was taken away. The cause of death has not been determined.</p>
<p>As of Friday, Ecuador&rsquo;s National Service of Risk and Emergency Management Department reports 3,368 confirmed coronavirus cases and 145 fatalities nationwide, of which 102 are registered deaths in Guayas province, where Guayaquil is located. But some citizens are concerned that confirmed positive cases of infection are higher than what is being reported by the Ecuadorian government, and they are demanding action, something happening in other countries too as delays and lack of testing cause frustrations.</p>
<p>Relatives wait outside of a hospital for information on family members infected with Covid-19 in Guayaquil on April 1.</p>
<p>President Lenin Moreno during an address to the nation Thursday called for transparency at all levels of government regarding the numbers caused by the crisis. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to tell the truth,&rdquo; Moreno said, adding that in &ldquo;both the number of cases and deaths, the records fall short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wated, the task force chief, has said that experts expect between 2,500 and 3,500 deaths in the coming months in Guayas alone.</p>
<p>Several containers have arrived in Guayaquil to serve as temporary morgues to accommodate the influx of bodies, and authorities say they plan to create space for &ldquo;dignified burials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But for now, some of the living in Guayaquil remain trapped in a nightmare, with no way to mourn their loved ones, not even through a proper burial.

<h3 id="can-an-old-vaccine-stop-the-new-coronavirus">Can an Old Vaccine Stop the New Coronavirus?</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/03/science/03VIRUS-BCG-promo/03VIRUS-BCG-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
A vaccine that was developed a hundred years ago to fight the tuberculosis scourge in Europe is now being tested against the coronavirus by scientists eager to find a quick way to protect health care workers, among others.</p>
<p>The Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine is still widely used in the developing world, where scientists have found that it does more than prevent TB. The vaccine prevents infant deaths from a variety of causes, and sharply reduces the incidence of respiratory infections.</p>
<p>The vaccine seems to “train” the immune system to recognize and respond to a variety of infections, including viruses, bacteria and parasites, experts say. There is little evidence yet that the vaccine will blunt infection with the coronavirus, but a series of clinical trials may answer the question in just months.</p>
<p>On Monday, scientists in Melbourne, Australia, started administering the B.C.G. vaccine or a placebo to thousands of physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists and other health care workers — the first of several randomized controlled trials intended to test the vaccine’s effectiveness against the coronavirus.
