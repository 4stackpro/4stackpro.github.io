IT might be Easter Saturday today, but there&rsquo;s still plenty of time to get an Easter shop in if you&rsquo;re planning a Sunday roast.</p>
<p>Tesco is keeping its doors open on Saturday and Monday over the Easter weekend - here&rsquo;s everything you need to know.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s everything you need to know about Tesco opening hours over the Easter weekend Credit: AFP or licensors</p>
<p>Is Tesco open over Easter?</p>
<p>Opening hours at Tesco will depend on the type of store you&rsquo;re visiting.</p>
<p>The supermarket has limited its general opening hours with stores closing at 10pm to help stop the spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p>On top of that, the Easter weekend means even more changes to opening times.</p>
<p>The majority of locations will be open except on the Sunday when stores in England and Wales will be shut.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the opening hours for the weekend:</p>
<p>Saturday - April 11</p>
<p>Tesco Extras and Metro stores will be open 6am - 10pm</p>
<p>Tesco Express stores will open for their usual hours.</p>
<p>Easter Sunday - April 12</p>
<p>Tesco, Tesco Extra Superstores and Metro stores will be closed in England, Wales and Northern Ireland</p>
<p>Tesco Extra Superstores and Metro stores will be open in Scotland from 8am - 8pm</p>
<p>All Express convenience stores will be open for their usual hours.</p>
<p>Easter Monday</p>
<p>Superstores and Metro stores in England and Wales will be open from 8am - 6pm.</p>
<p>Northern Ireland Tesco Extras will be open 10am - 7pm.</p>
<p>Scotland&rsquo;s Tesco Extra Superstroes will be open 8am - 8pm.</p>
<p>All Express convenience stores are open usual hours.</p>
<p>While Tesco has confirmed that these are its typical opening hours, it says that some hours may vary by store, so you need to check the store locator.</p>
<p>Is Tesco doing home delivery?</p>
<p>Home delivery is operating as normal over the Easter break, but coronavirus means you might struggle to get a slot.</p>
<p>Each store has a limited number of delivery slots which are available on a first come, first serve basis. Because of recent increased customer demand, Tesco says its slots are being booked up faster than normal.</p>
<p>Lots of stores also offer Click+Collect slots which may be suitable for you if you’re still looking to place an order.</p>
<p>You can also book a slot in advance and add a few items to your basket to secure it, which you can go back and update later.</p>
<p>At the time of writing there were no delivery slots available before April 27.</p>
<p>When are the Easter holidays 2019?</p>
<p>Good Friday falls on April 10 this year, while Easter Monday is on April 13.</p>
<p>Most schools have broken up for the holidays, but dates vary in different areas so you should check your school or council&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>It is not yet clear whether schools will open after the Easter break or if they will remain closed because of coronavirus.</p>
<p>When are the bank holiday dates for 2020?</p>
<p>Here is the full list of upcoming 2020 bank holidays in England and Wales.</p>
<p>Friday, April 10 (Good Friday)</p>
<p>(Good Friday) Monday, April 13 (Easter Monday)</p>
<p>(Easter Monday) Monday, May 8 (Early May Bank Holiday)</p>
<p>(Early May Bank Holiday) Monday, May 25 (Spring Bank Holiday)</p>
<p>(Spring Bank Holiday) Monday, August 31 (Summer Bank Holiday)</p>
<p>(Summer Bank Holiday) Friday, December 25 (Christmas Day)</p>
<p>(Christmas Day) Monday, December 28 (substitute Boxing Day)</p>
<p>Dates in Scotland and Northern Ireland vary.</p>

<p>As supermarket chain Asda reduces its opening hours at some stores due to the Coronavirus lockdown, it&rsquo;s worth double checking opening times over the Easter break.</p>
<p>Despite some branches across the UK being open for shorter periods, Asda has added thousands more slots to its online delivery service after going on a hiring spree last month.</p>
<p>Now the chain has an additional 300,000 slots a week to its website asda.com - the equivalent of around 40,000 a day, making it easier for shoppers to get what they need, when they need it.</p>
<p>Stores across the UK are also operating priority hours for NHS workers every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 8am to 9am.</p>
<p>Easter 2020 opening times</p>
<p>Saturday 11 April - All stores operating normal opening hours from 8am to 8pm.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All stores operating normal opening hours from 8am to 8pm. Easter Sunday 12 April - Asda stores in England and Wales will be closed. All stores in Scotland will operate normal opening hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asda stores in England and Wales will be closed. All stores in Scotland will operate normal opening hours. Easter Monday 13 April - Most stores will open from 8am to 8pm.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Asda advises all customers to check opening times for their local store by using the online store locator tool.</p>
<p>To help its most vulnerable shoppers, Asda has also rolled out a new volunteer shopping card that allows customers to top up cards with credit.</p>
<p>The cards can then be used by helpers and volunteers to shop for others in store or online without the need to share bank details or cards.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a helpful way for many who are self-isolating to get their shopping done in a fuss-free and manageable way.</p>
<p>Why the volunteer card is a good idea?
