<p>The prime minister’s plane, also used by royalty, is getting a new paint job costing £100,000 plus</p>
<p>The RAF VIP plane used by Boris Johnson and senior members of the government to travel around the world is to have its grey livery repainted red white and blue in a makeover estimated to cost more than six figures.</p>
<p>The Union Jack-inspired paint job for the Voyager aircraft comes two years after the prime minister complained about the dullness of its former colour.</p>
<p>When foreign secretary, Johnson said: “What I will say about the Voyager, I think it’s great, but it seems to be very difficult to get hold of,” before adding: “And also, why does it have to be grey?”</p>
<p>Downing Street confirmed that a Johnson-inspired makeover was under way, while defence sources added that the plane is being repainted at a specialist secure hangar run by Marshall Aerospace near Cambridge.</p>
<p>David Cameron commissioned the £10m aircraft – dubbed “Cam Force One” – when he was prime minister but to reduce costs and deflect public criticism the plane was intended to have a dual civilian and military use.</p>
<p>But repainting it in the colours of the national flag suggests that it will be increasingly used for globe trotting by Johnson during the rest of his time as prime minister.</p>
<p>Andy Netherwood, a former RAF pilot and defence commentator, said: “The issue is project creep. If it really is an all-over shiny paint scheme then it’s starting to look – operationally and politically – much more like Air Force One for Boris.”</p>
<p>Currently the Voyager also provides air-to-air refuelling for other RAF planes when it is not being used by the prime minister, other senior ministers or members of the royal family, particularly for trips outside Europe.</p>
<p>It is based on an Airbus A330 with a first class cabin for the prime minister or leading VIP on the flight, with club class seating for business delegates and conventional economy class seating at the rear, used typically by press.</p>
<p>Tony Blair had planned to buy a plane towards the end of his time as prime minister, but the plans were scrapped by Gordon Brown in 2008 to save money. Ministers took scheduled flights or chartered planes if they wanted to take along a large delegation.</p>
<p>The scheme was revived by Cameron, although by the time he was first able to use the plane in July 2016, the prime minister was on his way out of a job as a couple of weeks before he had been defeated in the Brexit referendum and resigned.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Royal Air Force said: “An RAF Voyager is currently in Cambridgeshire for pre-planned works.”

<p>A huge four-propeller RAF plane is set to soar through the skies of Humberside on Wednesday morning while doing training exercises.</p>
<p>The air force said one of its A400M Atlas planes would be flying in the region as part of a &ldquo;necessary, routine flight&rdquo; and was not linked to RAF support for the fight against coronavirus.</p>
<p>The A400M Atlas was made by Airbus and made its maiden flight in 2009.</p>
<p>It is a military transport aircraft and can carry 37 tonnes worth of cargo and can even perform aerial refuelling.</p>
<p>The RAF said the aircraft would be operating in the region as part of &ldquo;essential training&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It will be operating from the air force&rsquo;s Brize Norton base in Oxfordshire and will also be operating in the vicinity of Gatwick.</p>
<p>An RAF spokesperson said on the Brize Norton Twitter page: &ldquo;This morning our A400M aircraft will be operating in the vicinity of Gatwick and Humberside, whilst engaged in essential training.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are necessary, routine, flights and not connected with RAF support to the UK&rsquo;s fight against coronavirus.&rdquo;

<p>The UK Government has extended the Royal Air Force (RAF) deployment to support the French counter-terrorism operation in Mali.</p>
<p>The mission, which is currently ongoing in the Sahel region of West Africa, is supported by the RAF with three Chinook CH-47 helicopters and 100 personnel.</p>
<p>The troops and the aircraft are working with the French Armed Forces (FAF) based in Gao, Mali.</p>
<p>Since 2018, RAF Odiham personnel are conducting non-combat roles.</p>
<p>Chinooks are used for logistic operations such as transporting French troops to bases in Mali and delivering support equipment to required locations.</p>
<p>To date, the RAF has completed more than 2,000 flying hours, moving 13,000 passengers and 1,100t of equipment in adverse weather conditions.</p>
<p>Presently, the Chinooks are flown by aircrew from 18(B) Squadron supported by select RAF and British Army personnel.</p>
<p>French forces with international partners operate in the region to counter threats from terrorist groups, including Al-Qaeda and Islamic State.</p>
<p>Launched by France, the coalition aims to coordinate international activity in Sahel and support its long-term stability.</p>
<p>UK Minister for the Armed Forces James Heappey said: “West Africa is as important to the UK as it has ever been and we have many friends and allies in the region who share our desire to promote peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>“Combating extremism in the Sahel is vital for the security of the wider region and the UK will play its part tackling the declining security situation.”

Court rules RAF liable for damages after motorist’s ravine crash</p>
<p>Share this article: Share Tweet Share Share Share Email Share</p>
<p>Cape Town – The Road Accident Fund (RAF) has been found liable for damages a Port Elizabeth woman suffered after she swerved into a ravine, allegedly to avoid a head-on collision, seven years ago. According to court papers in the high court in Grahamstown, the woman argued that she was driving between Schauderville and Malabar in 2013 when an oncoming car entered her lane. She said she had to take evasive action in order to avoid a frontal collision, which left her having to swerve off the road and into a ravine. In its plea, the RAF denied that an unknown motor vehicle entered her lane, and alleged instead that she had attempted to overtake a vehicle travelling in front of her, and in so doing entered the path of an oncoming vehicle. A court initially found that she had not presented sufficient evidence for a finding in her favour and absolved the RAF, with costs.</p>
<p>The woman appealed to the high court, where both she and the RAF relied on the evidence of one witness each.</p>
<p>The woman’s witness submitted in an affidavit that: “On June 3, 2013 at about 9pm, I was driving behind (the appellant) in my vehicle. We were travelling from Schauderville to Malabar, when I witnessed an unknown vehicle cutting a corner and the driver had to swerve out of the way to avoid the head-on collision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The unknown vehicle then corrected itself. (The appellant) had to swerve again to correct her vehicle and an accident then occurred. The accident was the sole cause of the unknown vehicle who was in the wrong lane.”</p>
<p>The RAF’s witness, who was the appellant’s witness’s passenger, told the court that prior to the collision, the appellant was driving behind them.</p>
<p>As they approached a bridge under the N2 freeway, the appellant tried to overtake their vehicle, the witness said.</p>
<p>The high court found, however, that his version, in evidence, differed from his affidavit, and he went on to make more statements.</p>
<p>“Apart from the improbabilities attaching (the RAFs witness’s) evidence, his evidence must also be rejected as not being credible and as being unreliable in the light of the irreconcilable differences in the various statements he made.</p>
<p>“In his fourth statement, for instance, he stated that his initial affidavit, which supported the version of the appellant to a large extent, had been read back to him before he signed it,” Deputy Judge President of the Eastern Cape High Court, Judge David van Zyl, found.</p>
<p>Judge Van Zyl upheld the woman’s appeal with costs; and found the RAF to be solely liable for any damages the woman may prove.</p>
<p>The RAF did not respond to requests for comment by deadline.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/resources/images/11488245/" alt="img">
A MOBILE testing team has been deployed to the town to help out with the testing unit at Reading Football Club.</p>
<p>Eight personnel from 606 (Chiltern) Squadron of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force were called on to support Operation RESCRIPT - the military support to the UK’s response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>READ MORE: Reading Station less empty as shops reopen following lockdown closures</p>
<p>On Friday, the team left RAF Benson to complete training with British Army colleagues from the fourth Battalion Princess of Wales’ Royal Regiment, alongside RAF Reserve colleagues from a squadron based at RAF Brize Norton.</p>
<p>Following training on the task and the equipment they would be using, the team rehearsed numerous scenarios to ensure that they could provide the essential service.</p>
<p>They join other personnel from the Squadron who have been supporting Operation RESCRIPT in a variety of roles.</p>
<p>Squadron leader Andrew Bucknell, the officer commanding of 606 Squadron, explained: &ldquo;In total, 606 Squadron has mobilised 25 personnel in support of Operation RESCRIPT.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our personnel come from all regions in the UK and have a diverse range of skills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our troops have been involved in varied tasks ranging from providing air liaison officers to guarding key installations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This task of providing mobile testing teams is certainly one none of our team expected to be doing when they joined up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have engineers, drivers, suppliers and chefs amongst those that have deployed as part of the testing team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I’m delighted that we are able to assist and that our personnel are living up to our Squadron motto of being ‘steadfast in support’&quot;.</p>
<p>After five years as an RAF Reserve, SAC Alice Noakes is proud to be called upon to support the UK during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The RAF supplier said: “After several weeks of waiting and looking forward to getting involved, I am excited to finally get the call.</p>
<p>READ MORE: Many &lsquo;still too concerned&rsquo; to visit shops in Reading</p>
<p>&ldquo;This deployment is very different to my civilian job, where I am an administrator for an engineering company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been exciting having to adapt to the challenge, learn new skills and having to put them into practice straight away in order to fulfil my responsibilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 606 Squadron team are being led by flight sergeant Andrew Fuller, who is &ldquo;very proud&rdquo; of the attitude and flexibility that his personnel have shown, particularly deploying at short notice.</p>
<p>He said: “We were told that we were being put on 48 hours’ notice to move last Wednesday and since then things have moved very quickly. &ldquo;The team has taken in a lot of information during some very intense training and have been very adaptable as plans were finalised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have had to work long hours to get up to speed on the processes but everyone has taken everything in their stride.&rdquo;

<h3 id="raf-lawyers-back-in-court-as-legal-battle-still-rages">&ldquo;RAF lawyers back in court as legal battle still rages&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://citizen.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/iStock-176810772-320x213.jpg" alt="img">
Lawyers in Limpopo have gone to court after the Judge President moved to strike all cases involving the Road Accident Fund (RAF) from the roll.</p>
<p>The battle between the fund and 103 private attorneys, whose contracts it earlier this year tried to terminate, continues to rage.</p>
<p>The High Court in Pretoria earlier this month delivered judgment on three separate applications to review a decision taken by the RAF to terminate the services of its panel attorneys from 1 June, in favour of its inhouse team to settle claims. This is a bid to cut costs.</p>
<p>The court ordered the attorneys be allowed to stay on for at least six months, so the RAF could “reconsider its position and retain the social responsibility net in place protecting the public”.</p>
<p>But the RAF has since launched an application for leave to appeal.</p>
<p>Judge President Ephraim Makgoba of the Limpopo division issued a directive on 8 June saying “with effect from Monday until further notice, there shall be no RAF matters placed on the roll”.</p>
<p>These arrangements were “due to the impasse which is still prevailing between the RAF and its panel attorneys”.</p>
<p>This prompted the Amalgamated Lawyers Association to on Saturday file an urgent application to suspend Makgoba’s directive pending a review.</p>
<p>“The directive does not even have a cut-off date as to for how long will this unfairness persist, save to say that it’s intended to give space to the RAF to put its house in order,” advocate Hulisani Munzhelele argued in the papers.</p>
<p>Munzhelele suggested the directive reflected a double standard and said it was “unheard of in the SA legal system that the court can descend into the arena of litigation … to accommodate a party whose house is not in order.”</p>
<p>“Banks are obtaining default judgments every day against defendants whose financial houses are not in order. The [Judge President] has never come to their rescue in this manner,” he claimed.</p>
<p>“The only difference between poor defendants who are pursued every day by the banks and the RAF is that the RAF is rich and able to communicate with judge presidents.”</p>
