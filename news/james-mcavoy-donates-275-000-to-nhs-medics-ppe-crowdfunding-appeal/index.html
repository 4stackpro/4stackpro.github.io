The actor James McAvoy has donated £275,000 to a crowdfunding campaign set up to by a group of doctors to raise money to buy vital protective equipment for NHS staff treating coronavirus.</p>
<p>The Scottish star of the X-Men movies and Atonement gave the money to support the efforts of concerned NHS medics who launched a page on Thursday appealing for money to buy personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks, visors and gloves because they feel they are “going to war without armour and protection”.</p>
<p>The campaign has raised more than £440,000, surpassing the initial target of £200,000, which has now been extended to £500,000.</p>
<p>One of the medics behind the project, Dr Salaj Masand, said: “We are overwhelmed and speechless at the trust and faith people have put into us to deliver this. The number of very generous donations from everyone doubled our target within three days.”</p>
<p>McAvoy’s donation was “mindblowing”, he said, and would mean an order for 75,000 masks and 75,000 visors can be placed immediately rather than having to wait for enough donations to filter through.</p>
<p>“This is a global catastrophic event and an extremely tough time for governments across world, no different from ours. There is a worldwide shortage of PPE [that’s] likely to go on for months,” he said. “The government is doing all it can but the NHS needs all the help it can get. We are also competing with the commercial market who are trying to sell the same PPE for extraordinary prices.”</p>
<p>He said the situation was urgent and that time was of the essence, noting that one of the doctors behind the crowdfunding campaign has tested positive for coronavirus. The campaign was working with the government, which had been inundated with offers of inadequate equipment at inflated prices from private companies.</p>
<p>“That is why we raised the capital ourselves and hope to help government distribute these supplies in best possible way,” he said.</p>
<p>The doctors say in their appeal: “Unfortunately current hospital supplies are not sufficient and while we are reassured the government is doing everything it can, healthcare workers on the frontline are risking themselves daily without adequate protection to care for sick patients. Healthcare workers on the frontline without PPE is the equivalent of going to war without armour and protection.”</p>
<p>McAvoy said on Instagram: “Money donated today will save lives … Help us to help the government to help the NHS.”</p>
<p>The Guardian revealed on Friday that the Department of Health had rejected high-level medical advice about providing NHS staff with certain protective equipment during an influenza pandemic because stockpiling it would be too expensive.</p>
<p>Documents show that officials working under the then health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, told medical advisers three years ago to reconsider a formal recommendation that eye protection should be provided to all healthcare professionals who have close contact with pandemic flu patients.

<h3 id="james-mcavoy-donates-275000-for-protective-equipment-for-nhs-workers">James McAvoy donates £275,000 for protective equipment for NHS workers</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.newsshopper.co.uk/resources/images/11207460/" alt="img">
James McAvoy has donated £275,000 to a campaign to provide protective equipment for NHS staff, according to its founders.</p>
<p>Four doctors have raised over £555,000 since launching crowdfunding initiative Masks For NHS Heroes.</p>
<p>They wrote: “Unfortunately, current hospital supplies are not sufficient and while we are reassured the government is doing everything it can, healthcare workers on the frontline are risking themselves daily without adequate protection to care for sick patients.</p>
<p>“Healthcare workers on the frontline without PPE (personal protective equipment) is the equivalent of going to war without armour and protection.”</p>
<p>As well as the donation, Scottish actor McAvoy, 40, made a video in support of the campaign.</p>
<p>The X-Men star said: “NHS staff are heroes. We must do all that we can to protect them, support them and thank them.</p>
<p>“Nurses and doctors have described a lack of personal protective equipment.</p>
<p>“Caring for people with Covid-19 without access to proper masks, goggles, gowns and gloves puts themselves and others at risk.</p>
<p>“That’s why I’m supporting the efforts of four NHS doctors … to plug this urgent gap….Thank you NHS.”</p>

<h3 id="londons-cyrano-with-james-mcavoy-is-headed-to-bam">London’s ‘Cyrano,’ With James McAvoy, Is Headed to BAM</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/03/arts/03cyrano-bam-item/merlin_166149543_631d71da-4b48-4b45-9b7c-219d746ca8f3-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
The Jamie Lloyd Company’s West End revival of “Cyrano de Bergerac” is coming to the Harvey Theater of the Brooklyn Academy of Music for a limited run in May. Directed by the theater company’s namesake, Jamie Lloyd, the adaptation by Martin Crimp is a postmodern take on the Edmond Rostand love story, featuring beatboxing, silver-tongued characters in street clothes.</p>
<p>“It’s not the most difficult role I’ve played onstage but I would say it’s the trickiest,” said James McAvoy, who plays the title role and was nominated for a best actor Olivier Award for it on Tuesday. “While its themes and narrative are universal, Rostand sets it in a heightened world where language and oratory ability are as powerful as weapons.”</p>
<p>The classic version follows Cyrano, played by McAvoy, who is smitten with Roxane, played by Anita-Joy Uwajeh, but convinced he is too unattractive to win her affection. Instead, he helps the better-looking but inarticulate Christian, played by Eben Figueiredo, find the words to woo her. As the audiences will discover, the love triangle in this production has a modern twist to it.</p>
<p>(The production also received Olivier nominations for best revival, best director and for best supporting actress, for Michele Austin.)
