(CNN) The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States topped 101,000 on Friday as infections quickly spread to new areas of the country.</p>
<p>As of Friday evening, the US has at least 101,242 known cases of coronavirus and 1,588 people have died , according to CNN&rsquo;s tally of cases reported by health officials.</p>
<p>More than two months have passed since the first case of coronavirus was reported in the country and the US has become the epicenter of the global pandemic, overtaking China and Italy. The virus has hit New York and Washington especially hard but a new wave of coronavirus hot spots is already emerging.</p>
<p>Chicago, Detroit and New Orleans are seeing a rapid increase of cases and officials there and in many other cities say they don&rsquo;t have enough medical resources.</p>
<p>Mayors from 213 cities across the country have said they do not have, and have no way of acquiring adequate equipment and supplies to protect first responders, according to a survey released Friday.</p>
<p>Long lines of cars were seen at the three testing sites in New Orleans on Friday. Within two hours, one of the sites had reached its 250-test daily capacity.</p>
<p>In Michigan, where the number of cases skyrocketed to nearly 3,000 from fewer than 350 a week ago, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said 468 police officers are under quarantine while the police chief and 39 police officers have tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>Health care workers prepare their supplies Wednesday at a coronavirus drive-thru testing site at Michigan&rsquo;s Henry Ford West Bloomfield Hospital.</p>
<p>Hospitals in Chicago and New Orleans are preparing for a spike in cases but the city&rsquo;s convention centers will soon become medical facilities to treat thousands of coronavirus patients, similar to New York City.</p>
<p>Latest developments around the country</p>
<p>• A 15-minute coronavirus test approved: The The US Food and Drug Administration authorized a test Friday using the same technology that powers some rapid flu tests.</p>
<p>• Record number of US deaths in a single day: At least 402 coronavirus-related fatalities were reported on Friday. Only four states &ndash; Hawaii, Rhode Island, West Virginia and Wyoming &ndash; have not reported any deaths.</p>
<p>Defense Production Act implemented: President Donald Trump has invoked the President Donald Trump has invoked the Defense Production Act , to compel General Motors to produce more ventilators due to increased hospitalizations.</p>
<p>$2 trillion stimulus package approved: Trump has signed Trump has signed the historic legislation on Friday. It&rsquo;s key elements include sending checks directly to individuals and families, a major expansion of unemployment benefits and financial assistance for small businesses.</p>
<p>Navy hospital ships deployed: The USNS Mercy, a 1,000-bed The USNS Mercy, a 1,000-bed Navy hospital ship , arrived Friday at the Port of Los Angeles to treat non-coronavirus patients from area hospitals. A second Navy hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, is expected to reach the New York area next week for the same purpose.</p>
<p>Trump says the US will obtain 100,000 ventilators in next 100 days</p>
<p>As parts of the US face a looming shortage of life-saving devices, President Trump said the administration would procure 100,000 ventilators in the next 100 days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We delivered thousands, as you know, to New York, and they didn&rsquo;t know they got them, and we also had thousands put in a warehouse and that was also for New York,&rdquo; Trump said during a coronavirus briefing Friday afternoon. &ldquo;So we have to make sure that when we deliver things, they get distributed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo days ago said his state needed another 30,000 ventilators on top of the 7,000 it had. New York has been &ldquo;shopping literally around the globe&rdquo; for them, he said Friday.</p>
<p>President Trump on Friday morning tweeted that thousands of federally delivered ventilators had been found in &ldquo;New York storage,&rdquo; and that the state &ldquo;must distribute them now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cuomo told CNN Friday that this was &ldquo;incorrect and grossly uninformed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The state does have ventilators in a stockpile, and they all haven&rsquo;t been delivered because &ldquo;the hospitals aren&rsquo;t at their apex&rdquo; yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t need them today. You need them when you hit the (projected) apex, which is 30,000. We&rsquo;re not there yet,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Michigan hospitals preparing for &lsquo;worst-case scenario&rsquo;</p>
<p>A prominent Detroit-area hospital system acknowledged on Friday that it&rsquo;s preparing for hard life-and-death decisions after a letter was circulated online detailing who would be able to receive lifesaving resources if there&rsquo;s not enough equipment.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Henry Ford Health System told CNN the &ldquo;letter is part of a larger policy document developed for an absolute worst-case scenario.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not an active policy within Henry Ford, but it is part of our emergency response planning,&rdquo; the spokesman said, noting none of the system&rsquo;s hospitals are at capacity with coronavirus patients.</p>
<p>The letter, addressed to patients and their families in the event it is sent, says patients with the best chance of improving would be the first priority. It also says patients treated with a ventilator or ICU care may have those treatments stopped if they do not improve over time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry Ford is one of America&rsquo;s great health care systems, and what they put out is honest,&rdquo; Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan told CNN&rsquo;s Jim Sciutto on Friday. &ldquo;&hellip; Everybody is doing everything we can to stop it, but you would be irresponsible as a health system CEO if you weren&rsquo;t planning for that eventuality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are going into a war with no protection,&rsquo; nurse says</p>
<p>Nurses at an upstate New York facility are being told to use one surgical mask for five days because of a shortages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like we are going to war with no protection,&rdquo; said Kelley Cabrera, an emergency nurse who works in the Bronx.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We just feel like we&rsquo;ve been abandoned, we are being told to do things that are very dangerous,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Kious Jordan Kelly , an assistant nurse manager at Mt. Sinai Hospital who suffered from asthma, died at a New York City hospital less than a week after testing positive for the virus.</p>
<p>His sister Marya Sherron didn&rsquo;t know he was sick until he was hospitalized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found out he was sick and in the ICU at the same time,&rdquo; Sherron said. &ldquo;He told me that he&rsquo;s ok and not to tell our parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kelly texted his sister, saying he couldn&rsquo;t talk because he wasn&rsquo;t able to breathe.</p>
<p>The coronavirus crisis has &ldquo;turned our frontline professionals into true American heroes,&rdquo; Mt. Sinai said in a statement Tuesday. &ldquo;Today, we lost another hero &ndash; a compassionate colleague, friend and selfless caregiver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cuomo: New York may be 21 days away from a peak in cases</p>
<p>The rate of new coronavirus cases is slowing in New York, but it still may take 21 days for the Empire State to hit the apex, Cuomo told reporters Friday in New York City.</p>
<p>The number of new cases is now doubling roughly every four days, down from what had been every two days, Cuomo said.</p>
<p>The state and its National Guard already are assembling four 1,000-bed temporary, overflow hospitals in existing buildings, including at Manhattan&rsquo;s Javits Convention Center</p>
<p>New York Bellevue Hospital Center created a makeshift morgue using tents and refrigerated trucks. At Elmhurst Hospital Cente r in Queens, 13 patients died from coronavirus within 24 hours this week.</p>

<p>Several health officials and experts say the fight against coronavirus is still beginning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are in for a bumpy ride for the next 12 to 18 months,&rdquo; Dr. Ashish Jha, the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said Thursday. &ldquo;If we are aggressive now about stopping things, shutting down, building up a test regime, we can then open up again &hellip;. and most places can go back to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But only when we are ready. And we are nowhere near ready now,&rdquo; he said.

<p><img src="https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2020/03/01/coronavirus-image-1_wide-4b50897d9eef3e42c41dcf8015172617e821fa07.jpg?s=1400" alt="img">
As Testing Quickly Ramps Up, Expect More U.S. Coronavirus Cases</p>

<p>Updated at 10:21 p.m ET</p>
<p>As labs across the United States quickly ramp up their ability to test for the novel coronavirus, public health officials are anxiously awaiting results that could start to reveal its secret movements around the country.</p>
<p>New cases of the coronavirus were identified in at least four states on Sunday: New York, Rhode Island, California and Washington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We now have 75,000 tests available out there in the United States, and over the next week that will expand radically,&rdquo; said Alex Azar, secretary of health and human services, on ABC&rsquo;s This Week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right now, it&rsquo;s important that we test people who have any type of respiratory illness — respiratory symptoms — that is unidentified,&rdquo; Azar said.</p>
<p>He said more than 3,600 people have been tested so far nationwide. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which provides testing and also confirms positive test results from state labs, says it has run fewer than 500 tests.</p>
<p>More testing is sure to find more people with the virus — at least, those people who have been sickened by it. This surge in testing won&rsquo;t be able to tell how many people are infected but not showing symptoms.</p>
<p>Scott Becker, the head of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, says that more than 40 public health labs should be able to test for the virus by the end of the weekend.</p>
<p>Over the next week, he added, that number should grow to more than 100 labs, as the CDC sends out more test kits.</p>
<p>Initially, limited testing capacity meant the CDC didn&rsquo;t advise testing sick people unless they had a history of travel to affected countries or contact with a known COVID-19 case. And test kits sent to labs around the country had a problem with one ingredient that resulted in delays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly do wish that the testing was available sooner. There was this very unfortunate challenge in the production process and it did put us a few weeks behind,&rdquo; Becker told NPR.</p>
<p>He noted that the availability of more testing and expanding who is eligible for that testing means that &ldquo;we are going to start to see more and more cases pop up across the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a much greater understanding of what&rsquo;s going on with the virus here in America,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Washington state reported the first death from coronavirus on Saturday: a man in his 50s with preexisting health conditions but no history of travel.</p>
<p>Officials reported a second death on Sunday, which they believe is connected to an apparent outbreak in a nursing care center in Kirkland, Wash. There, at least two people have tested positive and more than 50 residents and health care workers are reportedly ill with respiratory symptoms. &ldquo;Additional positive cases are expected,&rdquo; according to the local department of health.</p>
<p>On Sunday, it reported two more cases in two additional medical centers. Both were men with underlying health conditions who were in critical but stable condition.</p>
<p>A genetic analysis of viral strains from Washington state suggests that the virus has been circulating there for about six weeks, and the outbreak might involve hundreds of people, according to Trevor Bedford, a scientist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle who studies virus evolution.</p>
<p>Possible community spread has also been reported in California, where officials found the virus in a person with no relevant travel history or exposure.</p>
<p>So far, there are more than 70 known cases of the coronavirus in the U. S., and most of them are people repatriated from China or the Diamond Princess cruise ship.</p>
<p>Worldwide, the virus has been reported in more than 50 countries, with Mexico recently reporting its first cases. There have been more than 85,000 cases with about 6,000 of those outside China. More than 2,800 people with the virus have died.</p>

<h3 id="us-becomes-the-first-country-to-reach-100000-confirmed-coronavirus-cases">US becomes the first country to reach 100,000 confirmed coronavirus cases</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/03/18/USAT/6d629c6c-f93f-4344-a67f-4dfe7dbe02c3-XXX_TH_Seattle_coronavirus_2020_238.JPG?crop=2841,1599,x0,y135&amp;width=2841&amp;height=1599&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" alt="img">
The U.S. on Friday became the first country to record 100,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>As testing expands rapidly across the nation, the U.S. is seeing huge daily spikes in the number of reported cases. There were about 10,000 cases in the country as recently as a week ago, according to the Johns Hopkins University dashboard.</p>
<p>But the number broke six figures on Friday shortly after 6 p.m. ET, up from 83,300 a day earlier. That number is expected to rise steadily in the coming days and weeks, and health officials say the number of cases is likely higher due to lack of testing.</p>
<p>Since the country&rsquo;s first reported death on Feb. 29, at least 1,544 have died in the U.S. Around the globe, more than 26,000 people have died.</p>

<p>Cases have been reported in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. New York has by far the most reported cases, followed by New Jersey, California, Washington and Michigan.</p>
<p>While the U.S. has the most confirmed cases of the new virus, the U.S. has also conducted more coronavirus tests than any other country.</p>
<p>The CDC has not published an official count of nationwide coronavirus tests, but Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House&rsquo;s coronavirus response coordinator, told reporters on Tuesday that the U.S. had conducted more than 370,000 tests. By Friday, the COVID Tracking Project, an online effort started by two journalists to track the number of tests conducted in the U.S., said that more than 620,000 tests had been completed.</p>
<p>The U.S., with a population of about 329 million, is not leading the world in the number of tests conducted per capita. South Korea, a country of about 51 million, had tested more than 370,000 people as of Friday, according to health officials. Italy, which has a population of 60 million and has reported the most coronavirus-related deaths, had tested more than 390,000 people, according to health officials.</p>
<p>About 95% of testing in the U.S. is being done in commercial labs, and the $2.2 trillion stimulus package approved earlier in the day will require those labs to report total testing numbers, Birx said in a White House press briefing Friday. Since the bill was passed today, Birx said she expects the commerical lab data &ldquo;tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the U.S. attempts to expand testing capabilities, medical professionals are stretched thin and supplies are in high demand. New York for instance, has asked for 30,000 ventilators, a request that President Donald Trump questioned.</p>
<p>States and cities across the country have instituted shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders in an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19. Public gatherings have been largely banned around the world as authorities try to persuade people to follow the protocols.</p>
<p>How did the coronavirus start?</p>
<p>As with SARS and MERS, the new coronavirus has its origin in bats, and scientists suspect the virus was initially transmitted to another animal – an &ldquo;intermediary host&rdquo; – before it spread to humans. In the case of SARS, that host was a civet cat. For MERS, it was a camel.</p>
<p>Early reports of the new coronavirus emerged in December 2019 and have been linked to a market in Wuhan, China. Scientists suspect that an animal spread the virus to a person at that market, and that that person spread the virus to other people. The intermediate host may have been a domestic animal, a wild animal or a domesticated wild animal, according to the World Health Organization.</p>

<p>How is the coronavirus spread?</p>
<p>Scientists think the virus spreads mainly from person to person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. People are thought to be the most contagious when they are the sickest, but some spread might be possible before people show symptoms, according to the CDC.</p>
<p>A person can get the virus by touching a surface that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose or eyes, according to the CDC.</p>
<p>How do I get a coronavirus test?</p>
<p>If you have symptoms and want to get tested, the CDC recommends calling your state or local health department or a medical provider.</p>
<p>At this time, the CDC recommends that clinicians prioritize testing hospitalized patients and symptomatic healthcare workers. Second-level priority includes patients in long-term care facilities with symptoms, patients 65 years of age and older with symptoms, patients with underlying conditions with symptoms and first responders with symptoms.</p>
<p>Not sure if you should get tested? The CDC website features a &ldquo;self-checker&rdquo; to help you make decisions about seeking medical care. The feature is not intended for the diagnosis or treatment of COVID-19 and is intended only for people in the U.S.</p>
<p>8 strains of the coronavirus are circling the globe. Here&rsquo;s what clues they&rsquo;re giving scientists.
