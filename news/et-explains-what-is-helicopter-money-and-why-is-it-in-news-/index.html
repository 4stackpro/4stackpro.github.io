What is helicopter money?</p>
<p>This is an unconventional monetary policy tool aimed at bringing a flagging economy back on track. It involves printing large sums of money and distributing it to the public. American economist Milton Friedman coined this term. It basically denotes a helicopter dropping money from the sky. Friedman used the term to signify &ldquo;unexpectedly dumping money onto a struggling economy with the intention to shock it out of a deep slump.&ldquo;Under such a policy, a central bank &ldquo;directly increase the money supply and, via the government, distribute the new cash to the population with the aim of boosting demand and inflation.&rdquo; Why is helicopter money in news now?</p>
<p>With the coronavirus-hit economy falling deeper and deeper into a chasm with each passing day, Telangana chief minister KC Rao today said helicopter money can help states comes out of this morass. He asked for the release of 5% funds from GDP by way of quantitative easing (QE).QE, a policy followed all over the world, is the only way to deal with the situation, Rao said. &ldquo;To counter (economic crisis) this we need a strategic economic policy. RBI should implement quantitative easing policy. This is called Helicopter Money. This will facilitate the states and financial institutions to accrue funds. We can come out of the financial crisis. Release 5 percent of funds from the GDP through Quantitative Easing Policy,&rdquo; he suggested. Is helicopter money the same as quantitative easing?</p>
<p>Quantitative easing also involves the use of printed money by central banks to buy government bonds. But not everyone views the money used in QE as helicopter money. It sure means printing money to monetise government deficits, but the govt has to pay back for the assets that the central bank buys.It&rsquo;s not the same as bond-buying by central banks &ldquo;in which bank-owned assets are swapped for new central bank reserves.&ldquo;Helicopter money is also different from a central bank directly financing the debt of a government. Is Japan deploying helicopter money?</p>
<p>According to some analysts, the yield curve control that Japan is resorting to is basically a type of helicopter money only. That is because this strategy lets the government spend more without having to worry about bond yields jumping.BoJ, however, rejects the allegation on the basis that the &ldquo;BoJ still buys bonds from the market and does not directly underwrite debt from the government, something that could undermine confidence among investors.&ldquo;The line, however, is blurred as BoJ buys roughly the same or bigger amount of bonds issued by the government.</p>
<p>With no quick escape in sight for Covid-ravaged economies, authorities the world over are going back to the drawing board to find strategies to deal with this nightmare.One such strategy doing the rounds is ' helicopter money &lsquo;. It basically means non-repayable money transfer from the central bank to the government. It seeks to goad people into spending more and thereby boost the sagging economy.Here we attempt to answer a few relevant questions about helicopter money.

Hyderabad: The Telangana government on Saturday decided to extend the lockdown in the state till April 30 to contain the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Noting that the state shares a long border with Maharashtra, where the virus spread is rapid, Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao said tough steps are needed to ensure that Telangana is protected.</p>
<p>“The state cabinet decided to continue the lockdown in the state till April 30. It will definitely be implemented in a tough manner,&rdquo; Rao told reporters on Saturday night.</p>
<p>Observing that there is a fall in revenues of both the state and central governments against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, Rao said a policy of Quantitative Easing (QE), which is followed all over the world, is the only way to deal with the situation.</p>
<p>Explaining the issue, he said if funds are pumped into the society, there is a possibility of getting some relief and reviving the system.</p>
<p>“There are demands made to the government for support from different sections,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Rao said he explained the issue in detail to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a video conference.</p>
<p>Rao also urged Modi to increase the FRBM (Fiscal Responsibility and Budgetary Management) limit to five per cent from the existing three.</p>
<p>He suggested that a task force with the prime minister as chairman and cabinet ministers as members be set up to come out with an action plan on helping farmers and the policy to be implemented on the economic situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To counter (economic crisis) this we need a strategic economic policy. RBI should implement quantitative easing policy. This is called Helicopter Money. This will facilitate the states and financial institutions to accrue funds. We can come out of the financial crisis. Release 5 percent of funds from the GDP through Quantitative Easing Policy,&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
<p>“Bring a policy by which farmers would pay half the wages for labourers and the other half would be from the MGNREGA funds. With this, we will be able to support farmers during difficult times,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Appealing to the people to cooperate with the government in the fight against the deadly disease, he said there could be a possibility of lifting the lockdown after April 30 in a phased manner if things improve.</p>
<p>“If not fully, at least, we may get a situation to lift in a phased manner and move ahead. Therefore, I request all to cooperate,&rdquo; Rao said.</p>
<p>Referring to the concerns of students with regard to annual exams, he said a decision would be taken about class 10 exams, which came to a halt midway.</p>
<p>The cabinet has decided to promote students of class 1 to 9 to the next class, the chief minister said.</p>
<p>According to a media bulletin on COVID-19, two fresh deaths and 16 positive cases were reported in the state on Saturday.</p>
<p>With two fresh deaths, the death toll due to coronavirus rose to 14 in the state.</p>
<p>The number of active positive cases in the state mounted to 393 after the addition of 16 new cases on Saturday, the bulletin said.</p>
<p>Fifty-one people were cured/discharged from hospitals on Saturday. With this, the number of people discharged went up to 96.</p>
<p>During the lockdown, the chief minister said the food processing industry should be allowed to function to ensure that farmers are not put to losses and that there was no difficulty in supply of essential commodities, an official release, issued earlier in the day, quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>He lauded the Centre for extending required support to states in containing the spread of coronavirus.</p>

<h3 id="us-needs-more-helicopter-money-to-cushion-coronavirus-impact-says-anthony-scaramucci">US needs more &lsquo;helicopter money&rsquo; to cushion coronavirus impact, says Anthony Scaramucci</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106481435-1586411930276gettyimages-629906144.jpeg?v=1586412025" alt="img">
The U.S. needs more &ldquo;helicopter money&rdquo; to help its economy recover from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, said Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge fund investor who briefly served as President Donald Trump&rsquo;s White House communications chief. Helicopter money refers to a last resort type of monetary stimulus, which involves printing large sums of money and distributing it to the public to encourage people to spend more and thus, boost the economy. &ldquo;I think they need to put up more helicopter money,&rdquo; Scaramucci, founder and co-managing partner of Skybridge Capital, told CNBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Capital Connection&rdquo; on Thursday. He added that his firm&rsquo;s calculations showed that each adult should get $3,000 and each child $1,500. That would be more than the $1,200 and $500, respectively, already announced as part of a $2 trillion fiscal stimulus package.</p>
<p>In addition to fiscal measures, the U.S. Federal Reserve has cut interest rates close to zero and pledged to purchase assets &ldquo;in the amounts needed.&rdquo; Those are moves that have injected a lot of money into the economy, said Scaramucci. &ldquo;The Fed has injected in the last three weeks about $1 trillion dollars,&rdquo; he said. That has helped investors to become more bullish, Scaramucci said, adding it could pave the way for financial markets to recover from here on.</p>
