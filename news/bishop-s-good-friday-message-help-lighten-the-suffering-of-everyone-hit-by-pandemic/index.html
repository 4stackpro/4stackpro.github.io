MIRI: Christians must reach out to help lighten the suffering of all those hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, says head of the Miri Catholic Diocese, Bishop Richard Ng.</p>
<p>In his Good Friday message to the 90,000 Catholics in the Miri Diocese, he said it is vital to extend our time, financial and material resources and personal presence to help everyone who is suffering due to the outbreak, regardless of their race and religion.</p>
<p>“Being caring and charitable, as reflected by the life of Jesus Christ, is what Christians should emulate.</p>
<p>“Good Christians make good citizens, ” he said Friday (April 10).</p>
<p>Christians throughout the country are commemorating Good Friday in a solemn atmosphere made even more profound by the restrictions on mass gatherings.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in churches everywhere having to celebrate mass without the usual crowd of parishioners.</p>
<p>Bishop Ng said though the pandemic has resulted in a lot of hardship and suffering, it presents a time for everyone to ponder and reflect on life, and more importantly to renew their relationship with God, their families and their loved ones.</p>
<p>“Good Friday marks the crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ. It is a day of sorrow and atonement for sins.</p>
<p>“This suffering will culminate in Easter Sunday where we celebrate the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p>“During this Covid-19 outbreak, we cannot gather for Good Friday as a big crowd.</p>
<p>“We do live-streaming of our mass via social media &hellip; this actually presents an opportunity for parishioners to have a closer personal reflection with God in their homes and turn to God for help, and to family and loved ones for solace.</p>
<p>“The harsh time we are going through can be a time for reconciliation and renewal.</p>
<p>“There are many out there who are disabled, home-bound, homeless, lonely, isolated, and those who have run out of cash and food.</p>
<p>“Reach out and help all the needy regardless of race and religion, ” said Bishop Ng.</p>
<p>Miri Catholic parishioners are distributed over 11 urban and rural parishes in a land area one-third the size of Sarawak.</p>
<p>Good Friday is a public holiday in Sarawak, as well as Sabah.</p>
<p>Bishop Ng and the priests are celebrating mass in their private chapels but this would be broadcast via social media.</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s movement control order that bars mass gatherings is part of its intensive effort to stop the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Sarawak has recorded 13 deaths and more than 300 infections so far.

Good Friday is regarded as one of the most important festivals among the Christian community across the globe. This festival is celebrated during the auspicious week as part of the Paschal Triduum on the Friday before Easter Sunday. This day marks the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. In Christianity, Jesus&rsquo; crucifixion is one of the most important events mentioned in the Holy Bible. Crucifixion of Christ was the end of a bunch of events in the Holy Week such as Jesus&rsquo; return to Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, Jesus washing his disciples&rsquo; feet and Jesus&rsquo; last supper on the Maundy Thursday. It is a popular belief among Christians that in death, Christ took away all sins of the humankind and his crucifixion redeemed them. This year Good Friday is on April 10 whereas Easter is on April 12. The essence of Good Friday is the victory of good over evil. If you are wondering on how to send your greetings to your friends on this day, here are all the wishes, messages, images and status that you can share on this Good Friday:</p>
<p>May the love of Jesus grow stronger in your heart by each passing day. May you always be surrounded by love and care od our Lord. Heartfelt Good Friday greetings to you!</p>
<p>On Good Friday, May we start the day by fasting and praying, so that we can bring Lord&rsquo;s mercy and forgiveness on mankind.</p>
<p>Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God, trust also in me. -Jesus Christ</p>
<p>He bore it all in silence because He held us dear, May He receive our regards, May our Prayers He hears, Wishing you a Happy Good Friday!</p>
<p>May we never forget the true meaning of Easter- &lsquo;For when He was on the cross, I was on His mind.&rsquo;</p>

<h3 id="pm-praises-frontline-workers-in-good-friday-message">PM praises frontline workers in Good Friday message</h3>
<p><img src="https://loopnewslive.blob.core.windows.net/liveimage/sites/default/files/2020-04/NB1uGN5r7G.jpg" alt="img">
Prime Minister Dr Keith Rowley has called for unity among Trinidadians and Tobagonians inspired by the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>In his Good Friday message to the Christian community, Dr Rowley urged the public to reflect on the lessons Christ died trying to teach. This, as he acknowledged the frontline workers risking their lives to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>He said: “Let us hold on to that message of love and compassion as we go through our difficult, personal challenges and those of our nation knowing that the light Jesus promised will be there at the end, after this our nation’s very dark hour.”</p>
<p>“As Prime Minister, I see that love every day in the selflessness and commitment demonstrated in the on-the-job performances of our health, sanitation, security and essential workers, who hold to their duties in the face of the Covid-19 Virus pandemic.”</p>
<p>Dr Rowley noted that the frontline workers are setting the tone for the celebration of the joy of Easter and Jesus’ resurrection, which symbolises that brighter days are ahead.</p>
<p>He also remarked that through this COVID-19 pandemic, observers foresee a new world order filled with compassion as part of God’s plan to redeem the world.</p>
<p>As he wished members of the public a joyous day, the Prime Minister recalled how Christ died for everyone’s sins remembering him according to the Gospel, as a charismatic wanderer who preached and appealed for unity with God.</p>
<p>He said: “The story of his death on earth, which we commemorate today, is a tragic one, from which many lessons have been learnt over the past two thousand years.”</p>
<p>“It tells first of the support, then the indifference of his disciples, some even falling asleep during his darkest hour. Later, one will kiss him, then betray him. Others will desert and deny him in those final moments of that hour.”</p>
<p>“Jesus we are reminded was wrongfully accused; his enlightened message, which pointed to love, compassion, and a higher consciousness for all humanity was deliberately distorted and mocked by his accusers.”</p>
<p>Dr Rowley said despite his humiliation and mob trial that led to Christ&rsquo;s nailing on the cross, the world&rsquo;s saviour showed temperance and forgiveness.</p>
<p>He added: “His call to us, to love our neighbour and even our enemies as we love ourselves, may be more significant today than any other period in modern history.”</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the world turns, let us go forward with unity and confidence as Trinidadians and Tobagonians, inspired by what both the tragic death and the resurrection of Jesus Christ have shown us, and the belief that whatever challenge confronts our nation, ultimately there will be success and better days ahead.&rdquo;
