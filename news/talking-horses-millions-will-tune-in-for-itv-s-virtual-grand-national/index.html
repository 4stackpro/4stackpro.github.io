Around lunchtime on Saturday, somebody somewhere will hit “enter” on their keyboard and, a fraction of a second and many millions of calculations later, it will generate the result of the 2020 Virtual Grand National. A few hours after, many millions of viewers – more, perhaps, than might have watched the real thing – will tune in to ITV to watch as the computer’s thought processes get the full CGI treatment and its calculation becomes (virtual) reality.</p>
<p>If algorithms are not your thing, think of it as the rolling of a 100-sided dice, with Tiger Roll’s name on about 16 of the faces and the other 39 virtual horses distributed around the remaining 84 faces in proportion to the computer’s idea of their chance. Poor old Double Shuffle, at 100-1, is only there once, but in the unlikely event that his name does come up, it should guarantee a healthy return for NHS Charities Together, which will receive all bookmakers’ profits on the virtual race.</p>
<p>Talking Horses: roll up for our answer to the Grand National mystery Read more</p>
<p>If the ever-popular Tiger Roll is the virtual “winner”, there are unlikely to be any profits to distribute (though his backers could, of course, choose to do the decent thing and pass on their winnings here). And the bookies accepting bets on the race, of course, include firms who received a letter from Claire Murdoch, the NHS’s head of mental health services, just three months ago, which accused them of “leaving the NHS to pick up the pieces” of lives damaged by problem gambling.</p>
<p>So it is only fair to report that at a moment of national crisis when we are all in need of diversion, not just on Saturday but probably for many weeks to come, the bookmakers seem to have thought quite carefully about how to approach the Virtual Grand National and the interest it will generate.</p>
<p>“There’s of risk of that happening [a losing race for the bookies] if Tiger Roll wins, and we’ve made NHS Charities Together aware of that,” Gary Follis, of the Betting and Gaming Council, which represents all the major firms offering odds on the race, said this week. “But of course there’s no guarantee of that happening.</p>
<p>“We’ve developed a set of rules around this and there’s going to be no marketing to new customers, it’s only going to be promoted among the current customer base, and there’s also going to be guidelines around the treatment of any new customer who signs up as a result of this. Like any Grand National, there will always be new customers, though probably considerably fewer this time around, but we’re looking at ways to put them into a separate database, so that they don’t receive any follow-up marketing or cross-promotion of other products.</p>
<p>“It’s about a bit of light relief during coronavirus and to raise money for the NHS. I think we’ve been beaten up often enough that the penny is dropping that we’ve got to be whiter than white on this, so it hasn’t been difficult to get members to agree to that.”</p>
<p>Nearly 10m viewers tuned in to watch Tiger Roll win his second Grand National 12 months ago and an even bigger audience would have been anticipated this time around to see Gordon Elliott’s chaser attempt to become the modern Red Rum with a third successive victory.</p>
<p>ITV declined to speculate on possible viewing figures on Friday, but the strict lockdown means that it is at least possible that this year’s virtual race will pull in more viewers than an actual National ever could, and if the trailers are any guide, it promises to be quite a show.</p>
<p>Little touches which add to the experience include CGI fence-repair teams who jog on to patch up the obstacles for lap two, virtual mud, CGI crowds in the stands and around the track and even a virtual ambulance following the field to check on the condition of fallen riders. The developers have even created what they describe as a “flocking algorithm” to account for how horses run around bends.</p>
<p>It is very clever stuff, and promises to offer a welcome respite from grimmer realities outside the front door. And when all is said and done, the virtual prizes have been handed out and the actual bets settled, it may also leave us cherishing the real Grand National a little bit more.

<h3 id="2020-virtual-grand-national-how-does-the-race-work-and-when-is-it-on">2020 Virtual Grand National: how does the race work and when is it on?</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.racingpost.com/favicon.ico" alt="img">
Virtual Grand National: computer-simulated race to be shown on ITV1 at 5pm on Saturday</p>
<p>The real Grand National has sadly been cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, but on Saturday millions will tune in to ITV to watch its replacement: a computer-simulated running of the nation&rsquo;s favourite race. Here&rsquo;s the information you need to know:</p>
<p>How does it work?</p>
<p>The Virtual Grand National is a computer-simulated version of Aintree&rsquo;s world-famous steeplechase, designed by Inspired Entertainment.</p>
<p>They used computer-generated imagery (CGI) to recreate, as accurately as possible, all aspects of the race such as the course layout and National fences.</p>
<p>The simulation itself is made up of mathematical algorithms using data taken from the horses&rsquo; previous performances. The race&rsquo;s outcome uses a number of factors such as age, weight, form and weather conditions but also contains details such as fallers, unseated riders and collapsing fences.</p>
<p>The Virtual Grand National will attempt to recreate the famous Aintree race</p>
<p>Data on all of the 40 runners from this year&rsquo;s race have been added and the computer has generated odds.</p>
<p>The three previous Virtual Grand Nationals have been strikingly accurate, with Tiger Roll completing the virtual-real life double in 2018.</p>
<p>Virtual Grand National winners (real life result)</p>
<p>2019 Rathvinden (third)</p>
<p>2018 Tiger Roll (won)</p>
<p>2017 Cause Of Causes (second)</p>
<p>How can I watch the race?</p>
<p>The Virtual Grand National will be broadcast live on ITV1 at 5pm on Saturday. Coverage will be led by Nick Luck with Alice Plunkett and Richard Pitman on as pundits. Stewart Machin will be commentating.</p>
<p>The broadcast will also feature a race of champions, a simulation of previous Aintree greats being tested in an epic clash between 40 famous race winners.</p>
<p>Can I bet on it?</p>
<p>Yes. Bookmakers are keen to support the race and on Wednesday it was revealed that they would be donating any profits taken on the race to the NHS.</p>
<p>While the race has been pre-recorded, producers Carm Productions have vowed to ensure the result will not leak out to the betting market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the Virtual Grand National show is pre-recorded, we insist on strict levels of confidentiality from everyone involved in the production process,&rdquo; the company said in a statement.</p>

<p>39 Kimberlite Candy, Richie McLernon, 16-1, 10-4</p>
<p>40 Walk In The Mill, James Best, 16-1, 10-4</p>
<p>Has a virtual race been used as a replacement before?</p>
<p>Yes, but not since the 1967-68 season. Racing was suspended then due to the outbreak of foot and mouth and the BBC broadcasted two computer-simulated races.</p>
<p>The King George VI Chase was simulated in an electric computer centre and commentated by Peter O&rsquo;Sullevan on the BBC.</p>
<p>The video below, broadcast by British Pathe, details the process of the computer-generated running of the 1967 Massey Ferguson Gold Cup, now traditionally known as the Caspian Caviar Gold Cup.</p>

THE Virtual Grand National is just a couple of days away!</p>
<p>Here is your ultimate guide to the final field of 40.</p>
<p>4 Tiger Roll will bid for a third straight victory in the Grand National</p>
<ol>
<li>Tiger Roll/Davy Russell</li>
</ol>
<p>What can you say that’s not already been said?</p>
<p>A wonderful servant to connections, he’s won the last two runnings of this race.</p>
<p>Not quite at his brilliant best at Cheltenham last time but still needs utmost respect back at his favourite course.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Bristol De Mai/Daryl Jacob</li>
</ol>
<p>Supremely talented at his beloved Haydock and not too shabby at Cheltenham either.</p>
<p>Has to carry a big weight here and this test on good to soft ground may not suit him as well as others.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Aso/Charlie Deutsch</li>
</ol>
<p>Ran the race of his life in last year’s Ryanair but that seems to have left its mark.</p>
<p>Too high in the weights and unproven at this distance makes him easily left out.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Elegant Escape/Jonjo O&rsquo;Neill Jnr</li>
</ol>
<p>Former Welsh Grand National winner loves a slog but this is bound to go too fast for him.</p>
<p>Not as good as he once was and could struggle.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Anibale Fly/Barry Geraghty</li>
</ol>
<p>Once classy enough to finish second in a Gold Cup, he’s become inconsistent and erratic.</p>
<p>However, he gets the services of Barry Geraghty and will like the ground, so all is not lost.</p>

<ol start="6">
<li>Top Ville Ben/Tommy Dowson</li>
</ol>
<p>A much improved performer this term but is undoubtedly overburdened and would much rather this was run at Wetherby.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Beware The Bear/Jerry McGrath</li>
</ol>
<p>Winner at the Cheltenham Festival last year, he’s often been one to think hard about the game.</p>
<p>Has a chance if putting it all together, but it’s a big ‘if’.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Peregrine Run/Kevin Sexton</li>
</ol>
<p>Has a big question mark over his stamina but can be given a chance at a mammoth price.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Jett/Sam Waley-Cohen</li>
</ol>
<p>Sam Wayey-Cohen takes the reins here, which is a plus straight away as he knows the course like the back of his hand.</p>
<p>Likely to have a willing partner who may just fade in the closing stages.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Alpha Des Obeaux/Richard Johnson</li>
</ol>
<p>Old boy who’d have a chance in his heyday but will probably struggle now.</p>
<p>That said, Richard Johnson is aboard and he can’t be discounted.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Total Recall/Paul Townend</li>
</ol>
<p>Rediscovered some of his spark this season and as a former Hennessy winner we know he’s on a good mark.</p>
<p>However, never stayed this far and could struggle at the business end.</p>
<p>4 Magic Of Light (left) was second in last year&rsquo;s race Credit: EPA</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>The Storyteller/Keith Donoghue</li>
</ol>
<p>Produced a fine performance at Cheltenham so we know he’s in good heart.</p>
<p>That was over hurdles, though, and he needs to jump better back over fences.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>Magic Of Light/Robbie Power</li>
</ol>
<p>Second in the contest last year, star mare has a big chance once again as she clearly loves the track.</p>
<p>She jumps very well and must have fine prospects of going one better.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>Talkischeap/Tom Cannon</li>
</ol>
<p>Very strong stayer and would have big prospects if he jumped a little better.</p>
<p>As it is, he’ll enjoy the ground and has a big chance.</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>Yala Enki/Bryony Frost</li>
</ol>
<p>Another strong stayer who had some very fine form in the book earlier in his career.</p>
<p>Has rediscovered some form for Paul Nicholls but needs a little more now.</p>
<p>A record sixth win for trainer Nigel Twiston-Davies 👀</p>
<p>Ballyoptic wins the bet365 Charlie Hall Chase! #ITVRacing pic.twitter.com/1hhJsnvMBc — ITV Racing (@itvracing) November 2, 2019</p>
<ol start="16">
<li>Ballyoptic/Sam Twiston-Davies</li>
</ol>
<p>Needs soft ground to be seen at his best and won’t get that here.</p>
<p>Won the Charlie Hall earlier in the season and has claims for the Twiston-Davies clan.</p>
<ol start="17">
<li>Burrows Saint/Rachael Blackmore</li>
</ol>
<p>Irish Grand National winner from last season has stamina in spades and will be going longer than most.</p>
<p>Has the services of Rachael Blackmore and holds outstanding claims for Gold Cup-winning trainer Willie Mullins.</p>
<ol start="18">
<li>Definitly Red/Brian Hughes</li>
</ol>
<p>Smart chaser who comes here following a convincing win at Kelso.</p>
<p>One of the stronger challengers from the north but may struggle to stay.</p>
<p>A wonderful finish to the @DoncasterRaces feature! Ok Corral battles gamely to fend off Fingerontheswitch to plunder the big prize for @sevenbarrows under Derek O’Connor&hellip; pic.twitter.com/QxzB2EayWe — At The Races (@AtTheRaces) January 25, 2020</p>
<ol start="19">
<li>Sub Lieutenant/JJ Slevin</li>
</ol>
<p>Front-runner who’s smart at his best but this is surely too tough.</p>
<ol start="20">
<li>Ok Corral/Derek O&rsquo;Connor</li>
</ol>
<p>SkyBet Chase winner has plenty of stamina and should have more to come given he’s so lightly raced.</p>
<p>Derek O’Connor has been booked and he must have a good chance, though Nicky Henderson has never won the race.</p>
<ol start="21">
<li>Tout Et Permis/Sean Flanagan</li>
</ol>
<p>Galloping grey should have exploited lower marks over hurdles this season and this is far too hard.</p>
<ol start="22">
<li>Vintage Clouds/Danny Cook</li>
</ol>
<p>Haydock specialist destroyed them in the Peter Marsh and relishes a slog.</p>
<p>May not get that here and could just be tapped for toe.</p>

<ol start="23">
<li>Crievehill/Tom Bellamy</li>
</ol>
<p>Rapid improver this term but has reached his ceiling and probably won’t stay.</p>
<ol start="24">
<li>Lake View Lad/Henry Brooke</li>
</ol>
<p>Done well up north and has performed well at Cheltenham, but this isn’t likely to suit this heavy-ground mud lover.</p>
<ol start="25">
<li>Jury Duty/Mark Enright</li>
</ol>
<p>Probably should have won last time out and doesn’t appear to be the weapon he once was.</p>
<p>Respected for Gordon Elliott but might just find a few too strong.</p>
<ol start="26">
<li>Pleasant Company/David Mullins</li>
</ol>
<p>Second in this two years ago was a fine effort and we know he stays well.</p>
<p>Not as good last year and could struggle now he’s another year older.</p>

<ol start="27">
<li>Acapella Bourgeois/Danny Mullins</li>
</ol>
<p>A fine front-runner in his youth has rediscovered some of his old zest of late.</p>
<p>Could go well at a big price.</p>
<ol start="28">
<li>Shattered Love/Lisa O&rsquo;Neill</li>
</ol>
<p>Mare with plenty of ability but hasn’t fired in the last couple of seasons.</p>
<p>Owners have a much better chance with Tiger Roll.</p>
<ol start="29">
<li>Any Second Now/Mark Walsh</li>
</ol>
<p>Won a Grade 3 in fine style last time and has been targeted at this ever since.</p>
<p>Has very strong claims if staying the distance.</p>
<ol start="30">
<li>Potters Corner /Jack Tudor</li>
</ol>
<p>Welsh National winner loves a stamina test and may not necessarily need heavy ground to be seen at his best.</p>
<p>Jack Tudor takes the ride and we’ve seen how good he is.</p>
<ol start="31">
<li>Dounikos/Luke Dempsey</li>
</ol>
<p>Pulled-up in three of his last four starts, including in this race last year, and surely faces too big an ask here.</p>
<ol start="32">
<li>Kildisart/Nico de Boinville</li>
</ol>
<p>Ran a huge race at the Cheltenham Festival and gets in off a nice weight here.</p>
<p>Has it to prove over this trip but has a chance if he gets it.</p>
<p>🗣️“It was John Gosden – he congratulated her and told her to pass it on to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David Bridgewater says Ultima winner The Conditional will be aimed at the Ladbrokes Trophy again next season plus reveals an interesting story regarding John Gosden! ⬇️https://t.co/g5Ff7v8P4o pic.twitter.com/jLu1dAm0TA — Racing TV (@RacingTV) March 18, 2020</p>
<ol start="33">
<li>Death Duty/Gavin Brouder</li>
</ol>
<p>Couldn’t get to grips with a fine jumper last time out after a long absence and is certainly best watched in these tougher waters.</p>
<ol start="34">
<li>Ramses De Teillee/Tom Scudamore</li>
</ol>
<p>Fine stayer with plenty of exceptional form over hurdles this season.</p>
<p>Has run well in the Welsh National before but probably needs softer ground.</p>
<ol start="35">
<li>Valtor/James Bowen</li>
</ol>
<p>Decent on his day but has plenty to prove, even under James Bowen.</p>
<p>4 Valtor will run in the Virtual Grand National for Nicky Henderson Credit: PA:Press Association</p>
<ol start="36">
<li>Saint Xavier/David Maxwell</li>
</ol>
<p>Has some good form this term but it would be some achievement if David Maxwell were to win this on his first attempt.</p>
<ol start="37">
<li>Warriors Tale/Harry Cobden</li>
</ol>
<p>Won the 2018 Grand Sefton Chase over these fences, form which would give him a shout.</p>
<p>However, has stamina to prove and is coming into this out of form.</p>
<ol start="38">
<li>Double Shuffle/Jonathan Burke</li>
</ol>
<p>Very little form to suggest he has a chance in this.</p>
<ol start="39">
<li>Kimberlite Candy/Richie McLernon</li>
</ol>
<p>Has got a very low weight and that gives him a huge chance considering he improved markedly to win Warwick’s Classic Chase last time.</p>
<p>Has all the hallmarks of a Grand National winner and might just the one to put it up to the market principals.</p>
<ol start="40">
<li>Walk In The Mill/James Best</li>
</ol>
<p>Loves Aintree and finished fourth in the race last year.</p>
<p>A year older and wiser now and his Becher Chase victory suggests he’ll produce another big run.
