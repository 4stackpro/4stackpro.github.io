<p>Quarantine has Drake even more in his feelings than usual. He’s reaching out to his ex Rihanna over multiple Instagram Lives, posting videos of rain clouds, and Monday morning he shared a heartfelt tribute to his family — including his son, Adonis Graham. The rapper posted several photos of his son, one of his parents, and one with he and Adonis’s mother, Sophie Brussaux. “I love and miss my beautiful family and friends and I can’t wait for the joyful day when we are all able to reunite,” he wrote at the end of a long, inspirational note about perseverance. “Until then please keep your lights on.” This is the first time the world is seeing Drake’s son after Pusha T revealed Adonis’s existence in the 2018 diss track “The Story of Adidon.” And, frankly, I think we’re all feeling like we need to see a paternity test. At 2 years old, Adonis has fair skin, long, curly blonde hair, and eyes bluer than the Caribbean Sea Drake likes to think he’s bred from. But even though Adonis doesn’t look exactly like his dad (yet), sharp-eyed fans immediately realized that Lil’ A looks just like Drake’s mom, every grandmother’s dream. Although we expected Drake to unveil his progeny in an over-the-top music video for an unrelated song, we did desperately need some more quarantine gossip.</p>
<p>Update, 4:30 p.m. ET: Sophie Brussaux is sitting back, laughing at everyone who says Adonis doesn’t resemble his dad. She posted her own #sonreveal on Instagram with a lot more Adonis content, including a Photoshopped family pic where she and Drake have blonde hair just like the 2-year-old. “All this time you thought @champagnepapi was dark-haired … but Adonis’s parents are really blonde,” she joked at the end of her caption. Thank goodness Brussaux followed up with more pics of Adonis. Drake should know better than to unleash an adorable baby on millions of people stuck at home, thinking about their impact on the world. Not today, biological instincts, not today.

<h3 id="louis-vuitton-designer-virgil-abloh-revamped-drakes-185-million-custom-private-plane-social-distancing-co-abloh-engineering">Louis Vuitton designer Virgil Abloh revamped Drake&rsquo;s $185 million custom private plane: &lsquo;Social Distancing c/o Abloh Engineering&rsquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.insider.com/5e82489792e1915f4065ec46?width=1200&amp;format=jpeg" alt="img">
Drake made sure to let everyone know he&rsquo;s &ldquo;social distancing&rdquo; — by unveiling his private, converted Boeing 767-300F, newly redesigned by Louis Vuitton Menswear Creative Director and Off-White founder Virgil Abloh.</p>
<p>CargoJet reportedly gave Drake the plane for free last year in exchange for publicity, according to TMZ, though this hasn&rsquo;t been confirmed by either the rapper or the company. The plane is worth about $185 million and can seat 30 people.</p>
<p>Abloh shared a behind-the-scenes look at his redesign process on Instagram, captioning the photo, &ldquo;The tail number is a problem and the FBO (fixed-base operator) is a whole other story&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Abloh is known for his industry-spanning artistic collaborations, having worked with brands like Ikea, Supreme, and even Evian.</p>
<p>Critics have called out Drake&rsquo;s apparent wealth-flaunting during the global pandemic</p>
<p>“SOCIAL DISTANCING” c/o ABLOH ENGINEERING A post shared by champagnepapi (@champagnepapi) on Mar 28, 2020 at 6:40pm PDT Mar 28, 2020 at 6:40pm PDT</p>
<p>After Drake shared his own post about the plane&rsquo;s revamp on Instagram — with the caption &ldquo;&lsquo;SOCIAL DISTANCING&rsquo; c/o ABLOH ENGINEERING&rdquo; — he became the latest celebrity to be criticized for flaunting their wealth during the pandemic. Over the weekend, billionaire Hollywood mogul David Geffen deleted his Instagram account entirely after being criticized for a post about social distancing aboard his $590 million superyacht.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear whether Drake is actually self-isolating aboard his private plane or simply referencing a viral tweet that imagined how social distancing might be inspiring his songwriting.</p>
<p>The redesigned plane wasn&rsquo;t the only reveal Drake made on Instagram this weekend. Soon after showing off his plane, Drake posted the first photos of his &ldquo;secret&rdquo; son, Adonis, who was born in 2017. The caption seemingly referenced the difficulties of social distancing and being away from family, ending with the rapper noting, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait for the joyful day when we are all able to reunite. Until then please keep your lights on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drake, who has a net worth of around $150 million, is known for his lavish lifestyle. Aside from owning a 12,500-square-foot, $8 million mansion in Los Angeles, he also has another sprawling 35,000-square-foot home, which was built on land he purchased in Toronto in 2016 for $6.7 million. He&rsquo;s also an avid car collector, with an extensive (and expensive) car collection that almost rivals Kylie Jenner&rsquo;s famously pricey fleet.

<h3 id="drake-shares-first-pictures-of-his-toddler-son-adonis-on-instagram">Drake shares first pictures of his toddler son, Adonis, on Instagram</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200330064440-drake-son-instagram-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) Canadian rapper Drake has shared his first pictures on social media of his two-year-old son, Adonis Graham.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Plan&rdquo; hitmaker took to Instagram Monday with an emotional post about missing his family and friends as the coronavirus lockdown restrictions continue to affect billions across the globe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is most important for you right now is to connect to your own inner light,&rdquo; he captioned a series of pictures of his loved ones, including the curly-haired toddler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will create the biggest opening of all. Trust that you have all of the power within to make this happen, and in order to do that connect to the people and things that bring you a lot of joy. When the mind starts to move into overthinking or fear, shift your attention right away to something bright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 33-year-old musician, whose real name is Aubrey Graham, went on to urge his 64.5 million followers to &ldquo;break free of the wheel of suffering and panic and open up to your own light&rdquo; in his philosophical message, adding: &ldquo;We are powerful manifestors.&rdquo;</p>
