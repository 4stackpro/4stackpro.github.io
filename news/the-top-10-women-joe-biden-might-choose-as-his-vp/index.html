(This is the second edition of our biweekly power rankings of politicians most likely to be chosen as Joe Biden&rsquo;s Democratic running mate in 2020.)</p>
<p>And one of the first big decisions Biden has to make in that race is who he will pick as his vice presidential nominee &ndash; a process that he has signaled is already underway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have to start now deciding who you&rsquo;re going to have background checks done on as vice presidential candidates and it takes time,&rdquo; Biden said last week of the VP vetting process.</p>
<p>While the veep pick always matters &ndash; less in terms of the electoral map than for what it says about how the potential president goes about making big decisions &ndash; there&rsquo;s little question that this choice for Biden is a hugely high-stakes move. Biden will be 78 years old if/when he is sworn in as president in January 2021 &ndash; by far the oldest person who has ever been elected to a first term.</p>
<p>To his credit, Biden has been open about his age as a factor in the race and the importance it puts on VP pick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[O]ne of the ways to deal with age is to build a bench &ndash; to build a bench of younger, really qualified people who haven&rsquo;t had the exposure that others have had but are fully capable of being the leaders of the next four, eight, 12,16 years to run the country,&rdquo; Biden said last week at a virtual fundraiser.</p>
<p>So, who will Biden pick? We know it will be a woman &ndash; he pledged that at the last Democratic debate last month &ndash; but which one? Below my rankings of the 10 female politicians most likely to be that pick as of right now. (You can see my initial VP rankings here .) Don&rsquo;t see your pick? Don&rsquo;t think your favorite is ranked high enough? Never fear! We do this every two weeks! Stay tuned!</p>
<p>New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Michelle Lujan Grisham: The New Mexico governor isn&rsquo;t well-known nationally &ndash; despite serving three terms in the House before being elected to her current job in 2018. She&rsquo;s on the list because she&rsquo;s one of the highest-ranking Latina elected officials in the country &ndash; and she represents an area of the country (the Southwest) that is : The New Mexico governor isn&rsquo;t well-known nationally &ndash; despite serving three terms in the House before being elected to her current job in 2018. She&rsquo;s on the list because she&rsquo;s one of the highest-ranking Latina elected officials in the country &ndash; and she represents an area of the country (the Southwest) that is growing like crazy . (Previous ranking: 10)</li>
</ol>
<p>Stacey Abrams</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Stacey Abrams: If political Twitter picked the VP nominee, Abrams, who nearly won the Georgia governorship in 2018, would be the overwhelming No. 1 choice. Her 2018 race made her a star and her work on voting rights issues since then has kept her in the national spotlight. The biggest problem for Abrams? Experience. The highest office she has ever held is the state House. And Biden has repeatedly said that experience matters a huge amount to him; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to be able to turn and say to your vice president, &lsquo;This is your responsibility.&rsquo; Because the job is too big anymore for any one man or woman,&rdquo; : If political Twitter picked the VP nominee, Abrams, who nearly won the Georgia governorship in 2018, would be the overwhelming No. 1 choice.

(Previous ranking: 7)</li>
</ol>
<p>Florida Rep. Val Demings</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Val Demings: The Florida House member barely missed my : The Florida House member barely missed my original Top 10 but the more I thought about her, the more I thought Demings deserved a spot on the list. Here&rsquo;s why: Prior to coming to Congress, Demings was the first female police chief in Orlando, Florida. In her relatively brief time in the House &ndash; she was first elected to the 10th District in 2016 &ndash; she has rapidly become a rising star. Demings was one of seven House Democrats chosen by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) to serve as managers during the Senate impeachment trial of Trump. (Previous ranking: Unranked)</li>
</ol>
<p>Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Tammy Baldwin: If you believe that Wisconsin is the Midwestern state that Trump must win in order to claim a second term, well then picking a popular senator from the state makes a lot of sense for Biden. (Baldwin won reelection with 55% in 2018.) Plus, Baldwin would be a historic pick: The first : If you believe that Wisconsin is the Midwestern state that Trump must win in order to claim a second term, well then picking a popular senator from the state makes a lot of sense for Biden. (Baldwin won reelection with 55% in 2018.) Plus, Baldwin would be a historic pick: The first gay vice presidential nominee for either major party. (Previous ranking: 8)</li>
</ol>
<p>Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Tammy Duckworth: Duckworth is my dark horse candidate to make Biden&rsquo;s eventual final three. Why? She&rsquo;s from the Midwest (Illinois). She would be an historic pick as the first Asian American to appear on a national ticket for a major party. And her personal story &ndash; the Blackhawk helicopter she was piloting during the Iraq war was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade and Duckworth lost both legs and the full use of her right arm in the incident &ndash; is incredible. (Previous ranking: 6)</li>
</ol>
<p>Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Elizabeth Warren: The Massachusetts senator drops two spots this week because she doesn&rsquo;t fit two of Biden&rsquo;s stated criteria for his second-in-command. One, at 70, Warren is younger than Biden but not exactly of a different generation. Second, Biden said in New Hampshire last month that he wanted a VP with &ldquo;some correlation between their views and mine,&rdquo; specifically mentioning support for &ldquo;Medicare for All&rdquo; as a non-starter. While Warren waffled somewhat in her support for Medicare for All, she was definitely a vocal supporter of a government-run program for much of her presidential bid. (Previous ranking: 3)</li>
</ol>
<p>Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Catherine Cortez Masto: The Nevada senator isn&rsquo;t getting nearly as much buzz as some of the three people ranked above her on this list, but that may wind up being a good thing since early buzz isn&rsquo;t always an indicator of future success. (Remember vice presidential nominee Julián Castro in 2016?) And Cortez Masto has a very powerful advocate in former Senate Majority Leader (and Biden longtime colleague) Harry Reid. The Nevada senator isn&rsquo;t getting nearly as much buzz as some of the three people ranked above her on this list, but that may wind up being a good thing since early buzz isn&rsquo;t always an indicator of future success. (Remember vice presidential nominee Julián Castro in 2016?) And Cortez Masto has a very powerful advocate in former Senate Majority Leader (and Biden longtime colleague) Harry Reid. According to Mediaite , Reid recently told Biden that Cortez Masto is his pick for VP and Biden responded that she was in his top three. (Previous ranking: 5)</li>
</ol>
<p>Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Amy Klobuchar: Klobuchar has been in the news a lot of late &ndash; for reasons she&rsquo;d rather not be: Her husband was diagnosed with coronavirus. Thankfully : Klobuchar has been in the news a lot of late &ndash; for reasons she&rsquo;d rather not be: Her husband was diagnosed with coronavirus. Thankfully he returned home from the hospital late last month and the Minnesota senator has spoken about her husband&rsquo;s battle the virus. Depending on how dominant coronavirus is an issue in November, that sort of personal experience might matter to voters (and hence to Biden). Klobuchar also still has her Midwestern roots, record of winning easily in a swing-ish state and centrist politics working in her favor. (Previous ranking: 2)</li>
</ol>
<p>Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Gretchen Whitmer: It was lost on absolutely no one that the Michigan governor was : It was lost on absolutely no one that the Michigan governor was one of the first guests on Biden&rsquo;s new podcast &ndash; and that on it he praised her as an &ldquo;outstanding governor&rdquo; and &ldquo;one of the most talented people in the country in my view.&rdquo; Whitmer&rsquo;s pragmatic politics are a nice fit with Biden&rsquo;s and her age &ndash; she&rsquo;s 48 &ndash; would make a clear generational bridge for Biden. Plus, Whitmer&rsquo;s profile has soared of late as she battles coronavirus in her state, and attacks from Trump on the job she is doing. (Previous ranking: 4)</li>
</ol>
<p>California Sen. Kamala Harris

<h3 id="dear-joe-biden-here-is-how-you-can-earn-our-support--alliance-for-youth-action-ifnotnow-justice-democrats">Dear Joe Biden, here is how you can earn our support | Alliance for Youth Action, IfNotNow, Justice Democrats</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/223f4970b75a5ea903ceb81765d8669f6e7d1119/0_341_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=34b8539fc29110649cfb50e3eb79fd8f" alt="img">
Dear Vice-President Joe Biden,</p>
<p>We write to you as leaders from a diverse array of organizations building political power for young people in the United States. We are all deeply committed to ending a presidency that has set the clock back on all of the issues that impact our lives.</p>
<p>While you are now the presumptive Democratic nominee, it is clear that you were unable to win the votes of the vast majority of voters under 45 years old during the primary. With young people poised to play a critical role deciding the next president, you need to have more young people enthusiastically supporting and campaigning with you to defeat Donald Trump. This division must be reconciled so we can unite the party to defeat Trump.</p>
<p>‘I know what&rsquo;s at stake’: can Biden win over skeptical Sanders supporters? Read more</p>
<p>Messaging around a “return to normalcy” does not and has not earned the support and trust of voters from our generation. For so many young people, going back to the way things were “before Trump” isn’t a motivating enough reason to cast a ballot in November. And now, the coronavirus pandemic has exposed not only the failure of Trump, but how decades of policymaking has failed to create a robust social safety net for the vast majority of Americans.</p>
<p>The views of younger Americans are the result of a series of crises that took hold when we came of political age, and flow from bad decisions made by those in power from both major parties. For millions of young people, our path to a safe and secure middle-class life is far more out-of-reach than it was for our parents or grandparents. We grew up in a world where “doing better than the generation before us” was not a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p>Instead, we grew up with endless war, skyrocketing inequality, crushing student loan debt, mass deportations, police murders of black Americans and mass incarceration, schools which have become killing fields, and knowing that the political leaders of today are choking the planet we will live on long after they are gone. We’ve spent our whole lives witnessing our political leaders prioritize the voices of wealthy lobbyists and big corporations over our needs. From this hardship, we’ve powered a resurgence of social movements demanding fundamental change. Why would we want a return to normalcy? We need a vision for the future, not a return to the past.</p>
<p>We’ve spent our lives witnessing our political leaders prioritize the voices of wealthy lobbyists and big corporations over our needs</p>
<p>New leadership in November is an imperative for everything our movements are fighting for. But in order to win up and down the ballot in November, the Democratic party needs the energy and enthusiasm of our generation. The victorious “Obama coalition” included millions of energized young people fighting for change. But the Democratic party’s last presidential nominee failed to mobilize our enthusiasm where it mattered. We can’t afford to see those mistakes repeated.</p>
<p>Young people are issues-first voters. Fewer identify with a political party than any other generation. Exclusively anti-Trump messaging won’t be enough to lead any candidate to victory. We need you to champion the bold ideas that have galvanized our generation and given us hope in the political process. As the party’s nominee, the following commitments are needed to earn the support of our generation and unite the party for a general election against Donald Trump:</p>
<p>Policy:</p>
<p>Climate change: Adopt the frameworks of the Green New Deal and make specific commitments around achieving a just transition to 100% clean energy by 2030 for electricity, buildings and transportation; restart the economy by committing to mobilizing $10tn in green stimulus and infrastructure investments over 10 years that will create tens of millions of good jobs of the future; and commit to take on and prosecute the fossil fuel executives and lobbyists who have criminally jeopardized our generation.</p>
<p>Gun violence prevention: Take an intersectional, comprehensive approach to preventing gun violence with the goal of reducing gun deaths by 50% in 10 years. In addition to the policies laid out in your plan, you should also include the following from the Peace Plan for a Safer America: call for a federal licensing program; hold the gun industry accountable by directing the IRS to probe the NRA’s not-for-profit status. Expand federal funding and resources for community-based violence intervention programs. Adopt Julián Castro’s People First Policing Plan and acknowledge that police brutality is gun violence.</p>

<p>Immigration: Commit to immediate executive actions to expand Daca and other policies to protect people from deportation and hold Ice and CBP accountable. Executive actions must also close the vast and cruel web of detention camps and not replace it with a practice of tagging people with electronic monitors or surveillance sold by big-money corporations. Commit to ending the collaboration between local police and Ice and the use of racial profiling by deportation agents and local police that pulls people into the deportation pipeline. Commit to providing guaranteed access to counsel for all while making immigration courts independent and free of political manipulation. Commit to repealing the 1996 immigration reform laws and creating citizenship pathways for all undocumented people without harmful provisions. Amid the current Covid-19 pandemic, it is clear that all people, including undocumented immigrants, must be included in any healthcare reform as viruses do not discriminate on the basis of immigration status.</p>
<p>Healthcare: Support the Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act to allow the government to manufacture generic versions of drugs and dramatically lower prescription drug prices. Support Medicare for All, especially in light of the coronavirus pandemic. Champion the repeal of the Hyde amendment and people’s ability to access abortion care regardless of their income or zip code.</p>
<p>Criminalization: Champion comprehensive reform of our criminal legal system. Incentivize states to cut their incarcerated population by 50% while supporting massive investment in housing, drug treatment, diversion, education and health programs. End the war on drugs and support the equitable legalization of marijuana based on proposals laid out by Senator Booker, Senator Warren, Senator Sanders, Secretary Castro and others.</p>
<p>Education: Support free undergraduate tuition for public colleges, universities and vocational schools for all students, regardless of income, citizenship status or criminal record. Provide economic relief to 45 million Americans and stimulate the economy by addressing the student debt crisis and canceling the entire $1.7tn in student loan debt.</p>
<p>Wealth tax: Support an annual tax on the extreme wealth of the wealthiest 180,000 households in America who are in the top 0.1% based on proposals laid out by Senator Sanders, Senator Warren and Tom Steyer.</p>
<p>Foreign policy: Commit to seek congressional approval on any authorization of war and support repeal of 2001 and 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force.</p>
<p>Democracy: Support the elimination of the filibuster and the expanding of the supreme court. Call for the adoption of strong anti-corruption reforms laid out by Senator Warren and Senator Sanders. Champion a voting system that works for all Americans. Every citizen should be automatically registered to vote, get to cast their ballot in a secure, accessible way that fits their needs, and never have their right to vote taken away for any reason. Get big money out of politics and make the passage of HR 1 a top priority.</p>
<p>Personnel and future administration:</p>
<p>Commit to appointing progressive elected officials who endorsed Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren as transition co-chairs, such as representatives Ro Khanna, Pramila Jayapal, Ayanna Pressley or Katie Porter.</p>
<p>Pledge to appoint zero current or former Wall Street executives or corporate lobbyists, or people affiliated with the fossil fuel, health insurance or private prison corporations, to your transition team, adviser roles or cabinet.</p>
<p>Appoint a trusted progressive to lead the White House presidential personnel office to ensure that the entire administration is free of corruption and staffed with public servants committed to advancing a progressive agenda.</p>

<p>Commit to put trusted voices on issues of importance to our generation on your campaign and transition team’s policy working groups, such as Governor Inslee’s policy team on climate; Senator Warren’s policy team on financial regulation; Aramis Ayala, Bryan Stevenson and Larry Krasner on criminal justice; Bonnie Castillo of National Nurses United and Dr Abdul El-Sayed on healthcare; and Mary-Kay Henry, Sara Nelson and Senator Sanders’ policy team on jobs and the economy.</p>
<p>Commit to appointing advisers, such as Joseph Stiglitz, to your national economic council and office of management and budget who believe in the principles of the Green New Deal and a rapid transition to a 100% clean and renewable energy economy.</p>
<p>Appoint a national director of gun violence prevention in the White House who will oversee the policy platform, coordinate across agencies and incorporate a survivor-centered approach. Commit to appointing an attorney general who will re-examine the Heller decision.</p>
<p>Appoint a DHS secretary committed to holding Ice and CBP agents accountable and dismantling Ice and CBP as we know them.</p>
<p>Create a White House commission to represent the voices and needs of immigrants who can work together to ensure that executive actions and legislative solutions address the needs of immigrant communities.</p>
<p>Calling for solutions that match the scale, scope and urgency of the problems we are facing is not radical</p>
<p>Create a taskforce on young Americans at the White House focused on the many issues unique to the next generation’s health, wellbeing and economic stability. The leadership of the office should directly report to the president and work regularly with the domestic policy council, national economic council and office of public engagement. Taskforce representatives from each agency should be appointed by and report to respective secretaries and taskforce leadership and focus on policy and administrative action that directly affects every aspect of young people’s lives. This office should engage directly with young people across the country and ensure representation from youth movement leaders in its ranks.</p>
<p>In addition to these policy and personnel commitments, you and your campaign must demonstrate a real passion and enthusiasm for engaging with our generation and its leaders. It’s not just about the policies and issues, but also about how you prioritize them, how you talk about them and how you demonstrate real passion for addressing them. You must demonstrate, authentically, that you empathize with our generation’s struggles.</p>
<p>Calling for solutions that match the scale, scope and urgency of the problems we are facing is not radical. If nothing else, this moment of crisis should show that it is the pragmatic thing to do. We want results and we’re leading some of the movements that will help deliver them.</p>
<p>The organizations below will spend more than $100m communicating with more than 10 million young members, supporters and potential voters this election cycle. We are uniquely suited to help mobilize our communities, but we need help ensuring our efforts will be backed up by a campaign that speaks to our generation. Our generation is the future of this country. If you aim to motivate, mobilize and welcome us in, we will work tirelessly to align this nation with its highest ideals.</p>

<p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106141713-15690135554782019-09-13t000048z_1400696501_hp1ef9d001c2d_rtrmadp_3_usa-election-debate.jpg?v=1569013622" alt="img">
Senator Bernie Sanders joins former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren onstage before the start at the 2020 Democratic U.S. presidential debate in Houston, Texas, U.S. September 12, 2019.</p>
<p>Progressive groups that haven often been aligned with Sen. Bernie Sanders are pushing Joe Biden to keep Wall Street executives and business leaders from being part of his administration if he wins the presidency.</p>
<p>While the former vice president has said he has not started speaking with possible members of his potential cabinet, he recently told donors that he has been discussing with his advisors who he would ask to join his administration. Biden is currently in the process of considering candidates to be his vice presidential running mate.</p>
<p>After Sanders dropped out of the race Wednesday, several progressive groups signed a letter to Biden calling on him to pledge that he will not appoint leaders on Wall Street and K-Street, or those in the fossil fuel and health care industries to campaign advisory roles or to cabinet posts.</p>
<p>The letter, which can be found here, also calls on Biden to assign people who endorsed Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, another progressive, to be co-chairs of his prospective transition team. The groups also urge him to appoint advisors such as Joseph Stiglitz, a Columbia University professor who is an advocate for the &ldquo;Green New Deal,&rdquo; to his National Economic Council. Stiglitz was reportedly on a list of advisors being pushed to Hillary Clinton by Warren in 2014 before the former secretary of State ran for president.</p>
<p>The groups signing the letter to Biden include Justice Democrats, Sunrise Movement and NextGen Action.</p>
<p>The progressive groups who spoke with CNBC said that if Biden does not follow these guidelines, he could suffer from low voter turnout in the general election and end up losing to Trump. One group is putting together opposition research against business leaders who are backing Biden&rsquo;s campaign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He needs to earn our trust,&rdquo; Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for Justice Democrats, told CNBC. &ldquo;Personnel is policy, it&rsquo;s where the rubber meets the road in terms of your values and commitments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biden, for his part, seems to be trying to appeal to many of Sanders&rsquo; supporters. He rolled out a plan on Thursday that would lower the Medicare eligibility age to 60 from 65, while also bolstering his student debt forgiveness plan hours after the Department of Labor released new data showing 6.6 million people filed initial jobless claims last week as the economy reels from the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Our Revolution, a 501(c)(4) organization founded by Sanders himself that backed his 2020 run for president told CNBC it is opposed to executives from the finance industry of becoming policy advisors to Biden now that he is the apparent nominee. The group did not sign the letter, but is looking into approaching his campaign. Sanders has been openly opposed to leaders in the finance industry playing any role in campaigns and in administrations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s certainly not what we want to see,&rdquo; said Paco Fabian, Our Revolution&rsquo;s campaigns director. &ldquo;I think it just increases the probability that their policy positions are the ones that get implemented and not the ones the folks on the progressive spectrum would be pushing for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At some point we probably will,&rdquo; when asked if they plan to reach out to the Biden campaign. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t figured out the best way to do that and the main issues we are going to engage with the Biden campaign on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another group has started putting together opposition research on a host of Biden donors who work on Wall Street. The Revolving Door Project, which is part of the progressive think tank the Center for Economic and Policy Research, has put together a research packet on Mark Gallogly, the co-founder of investment firm Centerbridge Partners, said the group&rsquo;s executive director, Jeff Hauser.</p>
<p>Gallogly has been helping Biden with fundraising for part of the election cycle and some donors have been privately discussing the idea of him being one of his economic advisors if he makes it into the White House. The opposition research cites reporting from CNBC, the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, and Politico among others. It focuses on Gallogly&rsquo;s ties to Biden and reports on his firm&rsquo;s business ties to Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Hauser noted that Jeffrey Zients, a former economic advisor to President Barack Obama who became the president of the Cranemere Group, and Tony James, the executive vice chairman at Blackstone, are two Biden supporters they are looking to do research on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect progressives have their own sort of critiques on how government works but less on revolvers, which they&rsquo;ll pick up from the research we do,&rdquo; Hauser said.</p>
<p>NextGen America, a super PAC founded and funded by billionaire Tom Steyer that has an army of grassroots get-out-the-vote activists, believes that in order for Biden to appeal to young voters he&rsquo;s going to have to make some compromises.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to work our ass off to get young people to the polls in November. You can throw all the money and time into that problem, but if you don&rsquo;t have a willing partner it&rsquo;s not going to be as effective as it could be,&rdquo; said Ben Wessel, the group&rsquo;s executive director.</p>
<p>A Biden spokesman did not return a request for comment.
