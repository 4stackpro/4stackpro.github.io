<h3 id="money-heist-season-4-will-la-casa-de-papel-its-release-on-netflix">Money Heist Season 4: Will ‘La Casa De Papel’ It’s Release On Netflix?</h3>
<p><img src="https://thebuzzpaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/960x0.jpg" alt="img">
Money Heist Season 4:</p>
<p>Money Heist the Spanish show revolves around a group of thieves who previously looted Spain’s royal mint. Now they are trying to rob the bank of Spain. So far, we have 3 seasons of La Casa de Papel and the fourth is the way. However, the release date has been announced, but there are rumours that it may be postponed.</p>
<p>What is the scheduled release date for Money Heist Season 4?</p>
<p>April 3, 2020, is the release date for the fourth season of Money Heist. It was officially announced by Netflix on December 8, 2019. A trailer and a teaser have been released since then. Now we just wait for the fourth season to launch. However, rumours on the network say it could be postponed.</p>
<p>The rumour of postponing the launch of the program is not authentic at first. As far as I know, it may be a hoax. Furthermore, no official announcement has been made about this laxity. Therefore, we still trust the previously announced date.</p>
<p>The release date was expected to be postponed due to the widespread corona epidemic and the fact that the world is closed. However, this could not affect the release of Money Heist as the show had already been filmed and was now ready for release.</p>
<p>Expected Plot:</p>
<p>Okay, guessing the plot can be a little confusing. First of all, it’s about Naomi, will she live or die? The next one we saw in the trailer. It confuses us more and more and it gets more and more confusing. Increasing heirs to what they’re doing? Well, all of these questions will be answered in due course.

<h3 id="who-is-alba-flores-aka-nairobi-on-la-casa-de-papel-fun-facts">Who Is Alba Flores, a.k.a. Nairobi on La Casa de Papel? Fun Facts</h3>
<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/albaflores-1585760363.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0.0983xh&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">
Season 4 of La Casa de Papel, a.k.a. Money Heist, hits Netflix on April 3.</p>
<p>Fans are on the edge of their seats after season 3&rsquo;s ending, which left us with a major cliffhanger about a fan favorite character, Nairobi. But who is the actress who plays her?</p>
<p>Ahead, meet Alba Flores, who opens up exclusively to OprahMag.com about how creator Álex Pina created the role of Nairobi especially for her. And as always: Beware of spoilers ahead.</p>
<p>La Casa de Papel, a.k.a. Money Heist, broke records last year when it became Netflix&rsquo;s most-watched non-English series. Three seasons have led viewers like me to become more and more attached to each character in the story of a gang of robbers who rebel against their government by pulling off intricate, high-level bank heists. If you ask any fan who their favorite character is, they will all likely have impassioned responses, from the nerdy teddy bear that is the crew&rsquo;s leader, El Profesor, to the eccentric yet lovable Berlin.</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s no question that there&rsquo;s a particularly rabid fan group behind one specific character: Nairobi. Even Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny recently crooned about the single mom-turned-bank heister in his hit single, &ldquo;Perreo Sola,&rdquo; with a lyric—loosely translated from Spanish—about wanting a &ldquo;bad girl&rdquo; like Nairobi.</p>
<p>In a cast portraying misfits who are quick to draw their guns on each other amidst temper tantrums, it&rsquo;s actress Alba Flores who brings to life the character who is the heart of this squad—and the only truly cool-headed person of the group. And that&rsquo;s exactly what made season 3&rsquo;s cliffhanger ending all the more stressful as we waited for months for season 4 to learn: Is Nairobi still alive?</p>
<p>In an interview at Netflix&rsquo;s headquarters in Madrid, Spain last fall, Flores was coy with me about season 4 details, of course. But she did say: &ldquo;If you’re going to watch it, keep your tissues close to you. This season is tough—tougher than you think it will be at the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said,&lsquo;If you like it, I can write a role for you.&rsquo; And that’s how Nairobi was born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Madrid native shared a surprising tidbit with me: In the original script of La Casa de Papel, there actually wasn&rsquo;t a Nairobi. I know, I know. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine the Money Heist cast without sweet, motivational Nairobi, but Flores explains that after working together on another Netflix hit, Vis a Vis, Álex Pina, creator of La Casa de Papel, offered to write a role for her for his new show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were writing the script for La Casa de Papel, and they realized that there was just one female character, Tokio. And they thought, &lsquo;This is not going to work,'&rdquo; Flores said. &ldquo;So he called me and asked if I wanted to come be on his new TV show and offered to send me the script for the first two episodes. He said, &lsquo;If you like it, I can write a role for you.&rsquo; And that’s how Nairobi was born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Money Heist has since become an international smash hit, and Flores admits she&rsquo;s still adjusting to exactly how, um, dedicated viewers are.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have fans around the entire world, from Spain to the U.S. to Thailand. There are people that have tattooed my face on their body!&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;I was recently in the street and a teenage girl came to me and said, &lsquo;Please take a picture with me&hellip;I&rsquo;m so excited that I’m going to get your face tattooed on my arm.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Think about it for a few days, please! Not even my mother is going to do that!&rsquo; So somewhere, this girl has Nairobi&rsquo;s face on her arm forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But fame isn&rsquo;t new to the actress—who was born into a family well-known in Madrid—and La Casa de Papel is far from her first foray into TV and movies. Ahead, a few more fun facts about Alba Flores to read up on after you binge-watch Money Heist.</p>
<p>Where is Alba Flores from?</p>
<p>Given her character&rsquo;s name on Money Heist and her portrayal of a Romani woman on Vis a Vis, many fans often wonder about Flores&rsquo;s nationality in real life. The actress was born and raised in Madrid, Spain, the daughter Antonio Flores, a noted composer and musician with Romani roots. And her grandmother, Lola Flores, was a renowned flamenco singer and dancer nicknamed &ldquo;La Faraona,&rdquo; known for her over-the-top on-stage persona.</p>
<p>Flores in Vis a Vis, aka Locked Up. Netflix</p>
<p>What other movies or TV shows can I watch her in?</p>
<p>Even before La Casa de Papel, Flores depicted another fan favorite character: Saray Vargas de Jesús, a Romani woman facing a five-year prison sentence in the series Vis a Vis, or Locked Up, another Netflix hit. Before then, she portrayed a Moroccan servant in the local Spanish drama series El tiempo entre costuras, as well as the police drama Cuéntame, before joining the cast of Vis a Vis in 2015.</p>
<p>Does Alba Flores have a partner?</p>
<p>From her social media, it&rsquo;s clear the actress keeps her private life just that—private—so we don&rsquo;t know much about her relationship status. But while she admitted in our interview that she&rsquo;s a bit of a &ldquo;workaholic,&rdquo; she did share that in her personal life, she likes to find time for yoga and small theater projects with friends.</p>
<p>Where can I find Alba Flores on Instagram?</p>
