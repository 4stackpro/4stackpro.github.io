A brother to Group I winner Sunlight was one of three yearlings to fetch $1 million or more at the revamped Easter Yearling sale.</p>
<p>The annual sale is being conducted online because of social distancing protocols during the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>There would usually be hundreds of people at the Inglis sales complex at Riverside adjacent to Warwick Farm racecourse.</p>
<p>The sale is a litmus test for other auctioneers around the world who are looking at options to hold their own digital sales as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.</p>
<p>While down on last year, the first session was still buoyant with 105 lots sold for $32.4 million at an average of $309,310.</p>
<p>There were 257 yearlings catalogued for the first day but several vendors, including powerhouse Arrowfield Stud, elected to sell privately.</p>
<p>The first million dollar-plus yearling was a So You Think half-brother to Classique Legend out of Pinocchio.</p>
<p>The $1.1 million colt from Tyreel Stud was bought by Legend Racing&rsquo;s Bon Ho who races horses in Hong Kong and Australia.</p>
<p>The colt is the first progeny of So You Think to reach seven figures at auction and his sale comes days after another son, Quick Thinker, won the Australian Derby.</p>
<p>Ho also bought a sister to multiple Group One winner More Joyous for $500,000.</p>
<p>The brother to Sunlight, by Zoustar out of Solar Charged was sold by Widden Stud to Hawkes Racing, for $1.1 million.</p>
<p>Widden&rsquo;s Antony Thompson said interest in the stud&rsquo;s draft was high but obviously affected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had around 50 or 60 parades at the stud compared to 150 or 160 we would have at Riverside,&rdquo; Thompson told Inglis TV.</p>
<p>Kitchwin Hills sold the highest-priced filly on the first day of the sale with a filly by I Am Invincible out of Srikandi knocked down to Andrew Williams Bloodstock for $1 million.

<h3 id="inglis-australian-easter-yearling-sale-to-be-held-as-virtual-auction---horse-racing-news">Inglis Australian Easter Yearling Sale To Be Held As Virtual Auction - Horse Racing News</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.paulickreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/download-128x41.png" alt="img">
The circumstances of the past few weeks have required Inglis and its clients to show extreme versatility in terms of planning for the 2020 Australian Easter Yearling Sale.</p>
<p>Following further significant consultation with vendors, it has been agreed the Easter Sale will now take the format of a virtual auction with online bidding.</p>
<p>As a result, the sale format will be as follows:</p>
<p>– Day 1 of the auction will start at 10 a.m. on Tuesday April 7</p>
<p>– Day 2 of the auction will start at 10 a.m. on Wednesday April 8</p>
<p>– Inglis auctioneers will be present on the rostrum at Riverside Stables auctioneering each lot. Rather than a leader parading a yearling on the stage, a video of that particular yearling will be displayed on the big screens at Riverside and online</p>
<p>– All bidding will take place as online bidding – as has been available at physical Inglis auctions for more than a decade – or telephone bidding with an approved Inglis staff member. Buyers are encouraged to use the user-friendly online bidding platform, but for those who need to bid over the phone, it will be necessary to complete an appointment of agent form before the sale.</p>
<p>– The sale will be hosted on the Inglis home page – inglis.com.au. An online bidding example page is included in this release.</p>
<p>– As was previously the case, all prospective buyers must be pre-registered and have credit approval pre-authorized. To do these things, visit inglis.com.au/biddingateaster. Registrations processed since the announcement that the Inglis Easter Yearling Sale would go online remain valid.</p>
<p>– A test auction will still take place Friday April 3, between 2 p.m.-3 p.m., for all registered bidders. This will include auctioneer audio and yearling videos.</p>
<p>“We have tremendous faith in our digital platform that has served us so well for many years and is a format we will continue to use not only for our twice-monthly Inglis Digital auctions but for future yearling or breeding stock sales when required, but in this instance a majority of vendors wanted a virtual auction with online bidding, rather than a fully digital auction, and we&rsquo;re lucky enough to be in a position to facilitate that,&rsquo;&rsquo; Inglis managing director Mark Webster said.</p>
<p>“We have a mandate to achieve optimum results for our vendors and there is an overwhelming feeling the best way to realize that is with a virtual sale.</p>
<p>“We have been extremely encouraged by the response to the online Easter Sale, particularly in this past week, from both domestic and international participants and with five days remaining before the first lot is offered, I expect buyer registration to increase even more.</p>
<p>“These are hugely trying circumstances to hold a sale of any description but I am exceptionally proud having seen significant amount of international press in recent days highlighting the fact Inglis technology can and will facilitate this Easter Sale when it appears no other jurisdiction around the world has the facility or capability to hold a major bloodstock sale at the moment.</p>
<p>“Buyers still have five days to inspect these yearlings across Australia and New Zealand so I would urge those who are yet to see the yearlings to get to as many as possible in coming days.</p>
<p>“We absolutely appreciate the support of our vendors and as challenging as this situation is for our clients, there are certainly going to be many positive stories – and champion racehorses – to come from next week&rsquo;s Inglis Australian Easter Yearling Sale.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
