According to rough estimates, there are around 40,000 ventilators currently available in India. (File photo: PTI)</p>
<p>As coronavirus cases climb in the country, an India Today investigation has laid bare a grim reality &ndash; stockpiling and price-gouging of ventilators.</p>
<p>The devices pump oxygen into failing lungs. Critical Covid-19 patients may need them for survival.</p>
<p>HOARDING SHOOTS UP DEMAND</p>
<p>When India Today probed Kamlesh Maurya, the business head of Delhi&rsquo;s Medikam Enterprises, he admitted that soaring demands are prompting distributors like him to increase their prices of portable refurbished respirators.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Demand is high. There&rsquo;s no availability of ventilators,&rdquo; he told India Today&rsquo;s undercover reporter. &ldquo;If you are fine with buying different brands, it will cost you more (than the regular price). If I have to ask for price quotations from the dealerships, it will be in the range of six lakh (rupees).&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same device would normally cost half the amount, he acknowledged.</p>
<p>Maurya claimed the price hikes have taken place in less than a week because of a scramble induced by coronavirus fears &ndash; and not because of medical emergencies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Companies have run out of stock now. People are ready to pay six-seven lakh rupees (per refurbished machine). Life is more important than money,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Earlier, a brand-new piece would cost seven lakh rupees,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>WELL-OFF STOCKPILING VENTILATORS</p>
<p>Naman Jain of Teerthanker Mahaveer Traders in Delhi disclosed how high-ranking officials and housing societies are stockpiling portable ventilators, just in case.</p>
<p>An assistant commissioner of police, he insisted, was one of his customers who he said had recently bought three machines at a premium price.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean he bought them for no immediate use?&rdquo; the reporter asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing (of that sort). Just for safety purposes,&rdquo; Jain replied. &ldquo;We, the vendors here, collectively had 6,000 ventilators, out of which 700-740 were Trilogy (portable Philips ventilators). Now only 11-12 are left,&rdquo; Jain said.</p>
<p>He revealed how apartments in a housing society pooled their money to buy 10-12 devices. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s gone to housing societies, most of them in Noida. A hundred houses buying ten of them, just in case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A new BiPap machine, a type of ventilator, would normally cost around Rs 2.25 lakh, Jain said. &ldquo;Now a used device is selling over Rs 1.5 lakh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much would an old device otherwise cost?&rdquo; asked the reporter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Around 60,000-85,000 rupees,&rdquo; the distributor replied.</p>
<p>Gursharan at Imperial Gases and Surgical Pvt Ltd in Delhi&rsquo;s Kotla area confessed that his company is also going to sell ventilators at premium because of high demands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those who wanted to take it individually should have taken it before. They are making inquiries now for personal use when the demand has peaked,&rdquo; said Gursharan, wearing a mask. &ldquo;As soon as we begin to run out of stock, we will increase the rates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no guarantee about availability, he added. &ldquo;They may be sold out while we are talking. We are getting many calls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gursharan demanded cash payment for supplying life-saving machines.</p>
<p>VIOLATING GOVERNMENT BAN?</p>
<p>In Ghaziabad bordering Delhi, Gajendra Singh of YMG Healthcare admitted that authorities have prohibited the sale of ventilators to private entities and individuals in order to prevent stockpiling.</p>
<p>But he still offered the devices at a premium price.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had 20 (ventilator) monitors. I gave preference to our existing clients, who made inquiries,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a game of demand and supply. More demand and less supply increase the prices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Singh, his company has received orders for supplying five mini ventilators at Rs 84,000 per piece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can pick them up from Nangloi (in Delhi) for 3.70 lakh (rupees).&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to rough estimates, there are around 40,000 ventilators currently available in India.</p>
<p>This month, the central government banned export of ICU medical devices, including ventilators, and sanitizers in order to deal with the shortages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this coronavirus spreads, the requirement (for ventilators) will shoot up to two lakh,&rdquo; Singh said. &ldquo;This is a war-like situation for the government. If it comes to know that I have the stocks and I have committed sale, they will not allow me to sell them to anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The distributor admitted that all companies dealing in manufacturing and sale of ventilators have been told to restrict their supplies only to the government. &ldquo;They are not to be sold to any private entity/individual. The Ghaziabad administration has told me that my supplies will only go to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we will get it, right?&rdquo; the reporters probed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I wouldn&rsquo;t have called you or spoken with you (if I didn&rsquo;t want to sell),&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>DISTRIBUTORS ENCOURAGING STOCKPILING</p>
<p>At Delhi&rsquo;s Najafgarh, Manish Dhankhar, director of UM Healthcare India, promised supplies of new ventilators for home use in the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People do take advantage of the situation. The government is asking for support. But will the government come forward to support tomorrow?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it wrong to stock up ventilators for private use?&rdquo; investigated the reporter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. You have to save yourself first. No government will support you,&rdquo; replied Dhankar, justifying the sale of ventilators to individual buyers for no medical reasons.</p>
<p>He demanded Rs 3.92 lakh for five portable units, with 50 per cent in advance.

<h3 id="a-california-rocket-maker-will-start-producing-simple-ventilators">A California rocket-maker will start producing simple ventilators</h3>
<p><img src="https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ventilator-virgin-orbit-coronavirus-health-oxygen-lungs-covid.jpg?quality=75&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1400" alt="img">
It’s not rocket science, but it could save your life.</p>
<p>Richard Branson-backed Virgin Orbit, with a factory nestled up to the airport in Long Beach, California, builds rockets to launch satellites from planes.</p>
<p>Now, with the coronavirus sweeping the globe, the company is stepping up to manufacture a simple ventilator on its own dime, driven by a windshield-wiper motor. Physicians at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) say it could provide a stop-gap solution.</p>
<p>“This one is going to basically be for all the patients who need a ventilator but do not need a top-line ventilator,” Dr. Govind Rajan, the director of clinical affairs at the UC Irvine Medical Center, says. “That will free up all these top-line ventilators for the sickest of the sick.”</p>
<p>A ventilator is a machine that effectively breathes for a patient; in this case, while their immune system fights off a viral infection for which medical science has few alternate treatments. The world’s supply of these machines is under heavy strain, especially as critical patients may spend weeks using the devices even as new cases arrive in hospitals.</p>
<p>Modern ventilators can get fairly complicated, incorporating sensors to monitor the patient and multiple settings to configure the machines to specific health needs. Ford and GM are re-tooling their production lines to manufacture machines like these, but it will take time: By the end of April, Ford says it will have produced 1,500 ventilators.</p>
<p>In contrast, New York City officials say their health system, the hardest hit in the US, will need 10 times as many—15,000 ventilators—by early April, when epidemiologists forecast the outbreak there to peak. As the virus continues to exact its toll, the demand for these machines is likely to keep rising.</p>
<p>To help alleviate the pressure, a group of physicians and biomedical device experts hopes to start producing “bridge” ventilators in the coming weeks. These are simpler devices, akin to the handheld “ambu” bags used by paramedics to give oxygen to patients over brief periods of time, while in transit or before they have been intubated.</p>
<p>Rajan says the device was inspired by the start of his career in India decades ago, when doctors facing ventilator shortages would train family members to use handheld respirators to breathe for sick loved ones.</p>
<p>Just over a week ago, he and a team including Brian J.F. Wong, a UCI plastic surgeon who works in medical device development, and Thomas Milner, a University of Texas, Austin, biomedical engineer, kickstarted the the Bridge Ventilator Consortium. The ad hoc group is working to address the equipment shortages with an open source design that relies on parts that can be sourced at stores such as Home Depot or AutoZone.</p>
<p>Govind Rajan Rajan and Wong’s idea for hacking an Ambu bag.</p>
<p>The collaboration with Virgin Orbit began after CEO Dan Hart reached out to California state government with an offer to help, and was in turn connected to the consortium. Now, Virgin Orbit is confident it can produce the devices to offer a consistent, one-size-fits-all ventilation solution. The final devices are expected to cost between $200 and $500 each, compared to the $20,000 to $30,000 price of sophisticated ventilators.</p>
<p>“We’re not doctors and we’re not medical device manufacturers, what we do have is a lot of really smart engineers and a brand new, state-of-the-art factory,” Will Pomerantz, a Virgin Orbit vice president, told Quartz.</p>
<p>Like many aerospace companies, Virgin Orbit is considered an “essential business,” but the company has asked all employees who can telework to do so, and reconfigured its factory floor and procedures to allow employees to do their jobs in lower proximity.</p>
<p>Medical devices are typically produced in specially designed facilities to ensure safety and sterilization. Virgin Orbit is used to precision manufacturing and even has its own clean-room facilities for mounting satellites on their rockets, though they will need emergency regulatory waivers to allow their new devices to jump into the fray.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Rajan was on a call with the White House ventilator task force, and says the ball is moving to get approval in Washington. Tonight, he is on-call at the Intensive Care Unit, where he expects to treat more patients with Covid-19.

<p><img src="https://d2c7ipcroan06u.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ventilator.jpg" alt="img">

<p>New Delhi: As the novel coronavirus wreaks havoc across the globe, infecting more than 600 people in India, the Narendra Modi government has asked medical device manufacturers to assess the availability of ventilators in India and boost their production, ThePrint has learnt.</p>
<p>Covid-19 is known to affect the respiratory system of the patients who are then required to be put on ventilator, which is a medical device used to assist with breathing.</p>
<p>At a meeting Tuesday, the government asked device makers in India to collate all information about the available stock of ventilators by 1 April, as well as their scope to manufacture additional machines.</p>
<p>The meeting was chaired by Ravinder, Joint Secretary, Technical Committee for Ventilators, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPITT), under the Ministry of Commerce.</p>
<p>The government has informed the manufacturers that the Andhra Pradesh MedTech Zone (AMTZ), an Andhra government initiative, will provide financial assistance to the tune of Rs 40 crore for large-scale manufacturing of ventilators. “AMTZ, under technical supervision of the Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India and assisted by the World Bank, invites proposals from leading med tech champions,” said the proposal letter, a copy of which was accessed by ThePrint.</p>
<p>The AMTZ will also provide a team of 25 medical technology experts and biomedical engineers free of cost to each manufacturing partner for the first three months for starting operations at the earliest.</p>

<p>India’s capacity to produce ventilators</p>
<p>“Every country across the globe is busy assessing the available stock of working ventilators. It is like assessing the military equipment before starting a war. We can produce around 5,500 units locally every month with the present set of manufacturers,” said Rajiv Nath, who heads the Association of Indian Medical Device Industry (AIMED), the lobby of medical device makers in India.</p>
<p>Nath, also the managing director of Hindustan Syringes and Medical Devices, represented the industry at the meeting Tuesday.</p>
<p>AIMED has contacted seven of the nine major manufacturers, who have confirmed that the current production capacity is 5,500-5,750 pieces per month. The production last month was approximately 2,700 pieces.</p>
<p>What is a ventilator and why do Covid-19 patients need it?</p>
<p>A ventilator is used when the breathing centre of the brain is unable to control respiration. The machine resembles an octopus, with several pipes coming out of the main equipment.</p>
<p>“In case of Covid-19, reports confirm that one-third of patients develop acute respiratory distress syndrome,” said Judish Raj, an industry veteran and founder of Hyderabad-based Sithara Adept Technologies, which manufactures medical devices.</p>
<p>“A ventilator is used when lungs are filled with fluid. Such patients find it very difficult to be oxygenated in a normal way. The only way to manage is to put the patient on ventilator assistance,” Raj said.</p>
<p>The additional pressure from the ventilator pumps oxygen into the bloodstream, and takes out carbon dioxide from the lungs.</p>

<p>The ventilator market in India</p>
<p>According to the estimates shared by Medikabazaar, a B2B online platform for medical supplies and equipment, the total ventilator market in India is valued at around Rs 500 crore.</p>
<p>“Of the total market, 75 per cent is imported equipment, with the market leaders being GE Maquet and Draeger. The remaining 25 per cent machines are Indian-manufactured,” said Jitesh Mathur, senior vice-president, Medikabazaar.</p>
<p>The Union health ministry’s data shows there are only 8,432 ventilators in the public sector in India. Chennai-based medical device maker Trivitron Healthcare adds that there are about 40,000 ventilators across the country — mostly in the private sector.</p>
<p>“There is a pressing need of ventilators in India and a huge disparity in their availability in various states. For instance, Mumbai alone has 800 to 1,000 ventilators, while states such as Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh have 1,500 and 1,800 respectively. The city of Bengaluru, has approximately 400 ventilators, whereas Kerala has 5,000,” said Sudip Bagchi, president, Trivitron Healthcare.</p>
<p>Other industry players gave similar estimates. Vineet Acharya, managing director of Life Line Biz, said: “Even if I share extremely conservative estimates, our industry has supplied more than 50,000 ventilators to hospitals in the last five years. We can safely assume that they are working ventilators.”</p>
<p>According to Acharya, ventilators manufactured in India costs Rs 5-7 lakh, while a foreign machine with same features will cost between Rs 11 lakh and Rs 18 lakh.</p>
<p>India’s requirement</p>
<p>While the Indian Council for Medical Research, the country’s apex body in this field, predicts that India may need thousands of ventilators if the coronavirus scenario worsens, experts say the number may run into several lakhs.</p>
<p>“Considering the phenomenal requirement of ventilators in developed nations such as Italy, India would need 80-100 times the available number of ventilators to prepare for a worst case scenario,” said Raj, who is also a medical device consultant at the Karnataka-based Kaynes Technology, a contract manufacturing firm.</p>
<p>“If there are 40,000 ventilators in the country, India needs to prepare for 40 lakh, considering the worst case scenario,” he added, based on an average stay of 21 days for a coronavirus patient on ventilator, as against an average patient’s stay of two days.</p>

<p>Govt to airlift imported components</p>
<p>The ventilator industry might be confident of producing over 5,000 pieces per month, but it is dependent on imports, mainly from Europe, for some raw materials and components. And that is a problem at present.</p>
<p>For instance, the essential electronic parts coming from China and the European Union are taking over 10 days to reach due to poor air-freight connectivity.</p>
<p>“The entire process of development of ventilators depends on the availability of various raw materials, tools and parts that are manufactured in different parts of the world. Any disruption to the supply chain, or the unavailability of any part would bring the entire procedure to a halt,” Bagchi said.</p>
<p>The manufacturers raised the issue at the meeting with government officials.</p>
<p>“We have asked the industry to prepare a list of components which need to be imported. We will send a cargo plane to airlift the raw material and components from these countries as an emergency requirement,” said a government official who was part of the meeting, which was also attended by representatives of the Ministry of Civil Aviation.</p>
<p>Nath from AIMED confirmed this. “We will soon submit the list of components,” he said.</p>
<p>Industry starts building capability to increase production</p>
<p>Meanwhile, several manufacturers have started diverting resources towards the production of ventilators from other components such as X-Ray machines and infusion pumps.</p>
<p>“The companies which are already involved in making health technology products might find it a bit easier to manufacture ventilators, owing to the fact that they have required equipment, trained staff, protocols, skills and expertise,” said Bagchi.</p>
<p>However, for companies in a different business domain, it might be difficult to churn out sophisticated breathing equipment like a ventilator, as it would mean major factory upgrades, and re-fitting assembly lines.</p>
<p>“If the government is ready to help us in importing the components, we can immediately jack up the production,” Life Line Biz’s Acharya said.</p>
<p>Speaking to ThePrint, an official from a multinational electronics company said every order for an ICU ventilator is being imported as the demand of them is very less in India. “While the government has reached out to us to understand the stock availability, it is a lockdown situation across the globe and our supplies are also significantly disrupted.”</p>
<p>The official added: “Moreover, our manufacturing cities are also struggling to source several components from other parts of the world so they are not operating fully. Several products are stuck for custom clearances.”</p>
