New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo gave an emotional update during his Wednesday coronavirus briefing about his younger brother, CNN&rsquo;s Chris Cuomo, who announced his COVID-19 diagnosis a day prior.</p>
<p>Reiterating that the news personality is isolated at home and &ldquo;doing fine,&rdquo; the governor used his brother has an example of how &ldquo;anyone&rdquo; can get coronavirus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no superhero who is immune to this disease,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Anyone can get it. No one can be protected from it. I couldn&rsquo;t protect my own brother &hellip; And with all he knows and as smart as he is, he couldn&rsquo;t protect himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger Cuomo, a CNN anchor, revealed his diagnosis Tuesday on Twitter: &ldquo;Sooooo in these difficult times that seem to get more difficult and complicated by the day, I just found out that I am positive for coronavirus. I have been exposed to people in recent days who have subsequently tested positive and I had fever, chills and shortness of breath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gov. Cuomo also addressed his brother&rsquo;s diagnosis in a press conference Tuesday, saying coronavirus is &ldquo;the great equalizer&rdquo; – anyone can get it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he told me he had the coronavirus, it scared me,&rdquo; the New York governor said Wednesday. &ldquo;It frightened me. Why? Because we still don&rsquo;t know&hellip; And I deal with all sorts of stuff and I&rsquo;ve seen all sorts of things&hellip; Why? Because we&rsquo;re talking about my brother. This is my best friend. I talk to him several times a day, basically spent my whole life with him. It is frightening on a fundamental level &hellip; because there is nothing I can do. And this situation is the same for everyone.. So yes, I&rsquo;m frightened for my brother; I&rsquo;m worried for my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gov. Cuomo also praised his younger sibling, who continued to work Tuesday after the diagnosis, anchoring his CNN show from his basement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a gutsy, courageous thing to do,&rdquo; Cuomo remarked. &ldquo;And we talked about it and in some ways this can be very instructive to many people, because everyone wants to know what happens if you get coronavirus&hellip; So what&rsquo;s the positive? (He can) show the country what it means to have coronavirus. And that information can be helpful to people. That&rsquo;s why he did the show last night: &lsquo;OK, I have coronavirus but here I am, I&rsquo;m doing my show. I didn&rsquo;t fall over, I didn&rsquo;t collapse, it&rsquo;s not a death sentence.&rsquo; Kudos to him. My pop would be proud. I love you, little brother.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="cnns-chris-cuomo-hosts-show-from-basement-after-testing-positive-for-coronavirus">CNN’s Chris Cuomo hosts show from basement after testing positive for coronavirus</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.graytvinc.com/images/0331_Chris_Cuomo_700.jpg" alt="img">
CNN anchor Chris Cuomo completed his Tuesday night show from his basement after announcing earlier in the day he had tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>CNN anchor Chris Cuomo has tested positive for coronavirus and is in quarantine at home. (Source: CNN/file)</p>
<p>Cuomo said in the broadcast he hopes to serve as a cautionary tale for viewers that the best medicine is prevention.</p>
<p>“Brace yourself,” he told viewers, “not for a hoax. But for the next few weeks of scary and painful realities. This is a fight. It’s going to get worse. We’re going to suffer.”</p>
<p>Cuomo revealed in a tweet on Tuesday he’s been experiencing coronavirus symptoms. He said he had been exposed to people who had tested positive.</p>
<p>“We will all beat this by being smart and tough and united!” Cuomo said in his Twitter post.</p>
<p>“I knew it was just a matter of time, to be honest, because of how often I was exposed to people,” the 49-year-old newsman said on his SiriusXM radio show Tuesday.</p>
<p>He’s quarantining in the basement of his Long Island home, where he will continue doing his prime-time show, hoping his wife and children don’t catch Covid-19. CNN says he doesn’t need any other network personnel with him to do his show.</p>
<p>Some competitors, including Sean Hannity and Geraldo Rivera of Fox News Channel, and Joy Reid and Ali Velshi of MSNBC, sent best wishes to Cuomo through social media.</p>
<p>Andrew Cuomo, 62, and the CNN anchor are sons of the late New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, and that teasing big brother-little brother dynamic often enlivens their appearances together. The governor called him his best friend.</p>
<p>“He is going to be fine,” he said. “He’s young, in good shape, strong — not as strong as he thinks he is, but he will be fine.”</p>
<p>The state of New York has been particularly hard hit during the coronavirus pandemic, with more than 1,200 deaths, most of them in the New York City metropolitan area, according to the Associated Press.</p>
