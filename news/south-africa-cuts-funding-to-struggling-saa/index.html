The South African government told specialists appointed to try to save struggling carrier South African Airways (SAA) that it was not able to give additional funds for rescue efforts.</p>
<p>State-owned SAA entered a form of bankruptcy protection in December and is fighting for its survival after suspending a large number of domestic and international flights over the global coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>SAA’s business rescue team said in a letter to affected parties on Tuesday: “On 14 April 2020, the business rescue practitioners received a response from government … that government is unable to provide additional funding to sustain the business rescue process.”</p>
<p>“Neither will lending guarantees be provided in respect of the business rescue process,” the letter from rescue experts Les Matuson and Siviwe Dongwana added, saying they were still assessing the impact of the development on the business rescue process.</p>
<p>SAA, which has not turned a profit since 2011, has been a consistent drain on public resources in a country with huge poverty and unemployment.</p>
<p>It has received more than 20 billion rand ($1.1 billion) in bailouts in the past three years.</p>
<p>The public enterprises ministry said in a statement it was still exploring options for SAA.</p>
<p>A copy of Finance Minister Tito Mboweni’s speaking notes, circulated by the National Treasury during a briefing earlier on Tuesday, said part of the government’s fiscal response to the COVID-19 crisis included closing SAA.</p>
<p>Mboweni declined to elaborate when questioned by reporters.</p>
<p>SAA’s rescue practitioners have been consulting trade unions for weeks on potential job cuts.</p>
<p>Last month they warned that without drastic measures the airline’s “situation will deteriorate to such an extent that it will threaten the very likelihood of the company being rescued.”

SAA&rsquo;s business rescue practitioners are assessing the impact of the government turning down a request for R10bn in extra funding.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the business rescue practitioners received a letter from the ministry of public enterprises stating that the government would not support an extension of the foreign currency borrowing limit to permit foreign financing of the business rescue plan.</p>
<p>The ministry said the government was unable to provide additional funding to sustain the business rescue process, or for a care and maintenance budget as proposed by the business rescue practitioners.</p>
<p>“It is for this reason that we as the business rescue practitioners are providing the necessary and critical update to all the affected parties.</p>
<p>“We are assessing the impact of this development on the business rescue process and will communicate any decisions to be made in due course,” the practitioners, Siviwe Dongwana and Les Matuson, said in a note to creditors on Tuesday.

<h3 id="saa-could-face-liquidation-as-state-funding-dries-up">SAA could face liquidation as state funding dries up</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.moneyweb.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/shutterstock_1194907507-555x370.jpg" alt="img">
South African Airways has been denied any further funding by its government owner as the national carrier looks for ways to recover from the coronavirus crisis and a local form of bankruptcy protection.</p>
<p>The airline’s administrators, who were put in charge in December, were told by the state to instead source cash from available resources, according to a letter they sent to affected parties and to Bloomberg News dated April 14.</p>
<p>“We are currently assessing the impact of this development on the business-rescue process and will communicate any decisions to be made,” they said in the letter.</p>
<p>South African Airways, which began operations in 1934, has racked up R26 billion in losses over the last six years and has depended on a series of state bailouts to keep operating. The grounding of all of its passenger flights, aside from charters to repatriate stranded citizens, due to the coronavirus lockdown have further decimated its revenue stream.</p>
<p>Read: Treasury ups the ante on its economic policy response</p>
<p>Finance Minister Tito Mboweni has long advocated shutting off funding for the airline, and earlier Tuesday cited the carrier’s closure as a way to save funds as the country deals with the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. Even before the Covid-19 outbreak ground global travel to a halt, the administrators had cut routes and started consultations with more than 4 700 employees about job losses.</p>
<p>“All options are now blocked to any form of real continuation of the airline,” said Peter Attard Montalto, head of capital markets research at Intellidex. “Basically the only option now is liquidation.”</p>
<p>The development is a blow to the ambitions of Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan, who has been keen to keep the airline running to both preserve jobs and act as a flagship carrier for the country. However, he told the business-rescue practitioners that the virus had strained the government’s finances and he couldn’t accede to their request to extend foreign borrowing limits by 10 billion rand, according to a second letter seen by Bloomberg News.</p>
<p>SAA’s external debt is guaranteed by the state in the event of the carrier’s collapse.</p>
<p>“We are of the firm conviction that South Africa needs a viable and sustainable set of airlines,” the Department of Public Enterprises, which falls under Gordhan, said in a statement. “We must urgently determine the operating and business model for a rescued airline, with a sustainable financial model.”</p>
