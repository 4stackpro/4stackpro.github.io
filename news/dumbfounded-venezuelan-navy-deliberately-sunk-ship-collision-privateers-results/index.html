RCGS Resolute號日前遭委國軍艦衝撞，傷害輕微。（圖片取自「Columbia Cruise Services」網站）</p>
<p>2020-04-04 08:25:01</p>
<p>〔即時新聞／綜合報導〕加勒比海域近日發生一起離奇事故，一艘委內瑞拉海軍船艦因故衝撞民間郵輪，卻因民船防護力太強，委軍艦反而船身破裂，進水下沉。</p>
<p>德國船務公司「Columbia Cruise Services」旗下的郵輪「RCGS Resolute」號，週二停泊於國際海域上期間遭遇委內瑞拉軍艦，委軍要求改變航向引發雙方對峙，後來衝動越演越烈，委軍艦甚至開火，並多次用船身衝撞RCGS Resolute右側。</p>
<p>請繼續往下閱讀&hellip;</p>
<p>委軍沒料到的是，RCGS Resolute是一艘破冰船，為了減低撞擊冰山的傷害，在設計上非常堅固，所以當下受到委軍衝撞時傷害非常小，甚至沒有影響到其航行能力，反倒是委軍艦承受重大損傷，開始進水下沉，結果船上32名船員只能棄船，登上RCGS Resolute號逃生。</p>
<p>委內瑞拉當局承認確有此事，但說法與上述有極大出入，表示衝突是發生在委內瑞拉海域，指控RCGS Resolute上載有雇傭兵，要對委內瑞拉發動攻擊，但當時RCGS Resolute上連乘客都沒有。</p>

<h3 id="video-emerges-of-venezuelan-navy-ship-firing-on-and-colliding-with-cruise-ship-before-sinking">Video Emerges Of Venezuelan Navy Ship Firing On And Colliding With Cruise Ship Before Sinking</h3>
<p><img src="https://api.thedrive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/23523523f.jpg?quality=85" alt="img">
In a follow-up to our report on the absolutely bizarre incident in which the Venezuelan patrol vessel ANBV Naiguatá (GC-23) fired on and smashed into the cruise ship RCGS Resolute off the Isla La Tortuga in the Caribbean Sea, we now have video of the incident. The patrol ship ended up sinking itself after smashing into the Resolute. Apparently, the Venezuelan Navy crew were unaware that the cruise ship has a reinforced hull that allows it to venture into partially frozen waters—a feature that also makes it a poor target for battering another ship into. You can and should read all about this strange ordeal and the equally odd geopolitical connections behind it in this past piece of ours.</p>
<p>The video, which the Venezuelan Navy released and is heavily edited, shows a Venezuelan seaman firing an AK-47 at the ship and then the two ships impacting, with the patrol boat quickly taking on water. The incident occurred in the early hours of March 30th, 2020, and the cruise ship, which was supposedly undergoing repairs at the time, was clearly making little if any speed through relatively calm waters.</p>
<p>The exact circumstances that led to the incident remain murky. Resolute&rsquo;s operator, Columbia Cruise Services, has already released a statement accusing the Venezuelan Navy of attempting to illegally seize the ship in international waters. Then, when the cruise ship&rsquo;s captain refused to divert to a Venezuela port, Naiguatá attempted to physically block it from leaving the area, which apparently resulted in the collision, according to the company. All 44 crewmen aboard the patrol vessel were rescued after the ship sunk. The Venezuelan Navy says Naiguatá was conducting a maritime traffic control operation at the time and claims it was the Resolute that deliberately turned into its patrol boat. However, if the Venezuelan ship had been the one that turned into the path of the cruise ship the positioning could have largely been the same. The Resolute is significantly larger and less maneuverable than the Naiguatá, as well. The official video notably does not show the full sequence of events.</p>

<p>In addition, there does not appear to be a readily available explanation from Venezuelan authorities of why the offshore patrol vessel had approached the cruise liner in the first place, let alone fired on it. Resolute had stopped in international waters off the coast of Venezuela so the crew could make repairs, according to Columbia Cruise Services. After the incident, she sailed on, as planned, to her destination, Willemstad, Curaçao Satellite imagery shows an oil slick, in international waters, in the area of the altercation, which could have been from the sinking Naiguatá. The oil also could have moved further out to sea since the collision.

<h3 id="cruise-ship-sunk-venezuelan-navy-ship-after-being-fired-at-and-rammed-dont-mess-with-resolute">Cruise ship sunk Venezuelan Navy ship after being fired at and rammed. Don’t mess with RESOLUTE.</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.maritimebulletin.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GC233.jpg" alt="img">
Master of cruise ship saved people he was responsible for, from a very bad possible outcome, be the ship seized by Venezuela.</p>
<p>Apr 2 UPDATE: Cruise ship with 35 maintenance crew on board (no passangers) was positioned outside Venezuelan territorial waters, when she was approached by NAIGUATA and ordered to sail to Puerto Moreno on Isla De Margarita. Warning shots were fired, Master of RESOLUTE (RESOLUTE indeed!) refused to obey and maintained her course. From RESOLUTE owner statement:</p>
<p>… the navy vessel approached the starboard side at speed with an angle of 135° and purposely collided with the RCGS RESOLUTE. The navy vessel continued to ram the starboard bow in an apparent attempt to turn the ship’s head towards Venezuelan territorial waters. While the RCGS RESOLUTE sustained minor damages, not affecting vessel’s seaworthiness, it occurs that the navy vessel suffered severe damages while making contact with the ice-strengthened bulbous bow of the ice-class expedition cruise vessel RCGS RESOLUTE and started to take water…</p>
<p>NAIGUATA sank, but RESOLUTE, as it came out, didn’t flee, she “…remained for over one hour in vicinity of the scene and reached out to MRCC Curacao, and sailed away only after receiving the order to resume passage full ahead by the MRCC and that further assistance is not required”.</p>
<p>So, there’s nothing much else left to talk about, except to laugh and to applaud RESOLUTE Master. Not many – if any – similar cases in naval history, when defenceless passenger ship sunk Navy battleship, and went away with it.</p>
<p>Apr 1 UPDATE: I’ve been correct in my assumption, that the decision to flee was justified, or so it seems, judging from updates published by local sources. According to Curacao media and their information, ANBV NAIGUATA did attempt to seize cruise ship and take her to Margarita Island, east of Tortuga, under a dubious pretext of “violation of Venezuela territorial waters”. Ships navigating in these waters enjoy the right of free passage, so it looks like an attempt to hijack cruise ship. That explains this strange leg in ship’s track and unexplainable Tortuga approach.</p>
<p>Captain of cruise ship is to be commended for his exceptional personal bravery and seamanship skills. He saved his crew from a very harsh ordeal, and called all fire on himself, because he’s to be the main target of Venezuelan wrath and lawsuits and so on.</p>
<p>Why did Venezuela decide to seize cruise ship? I guess, mainly for monetary reasons, though authoritarian regimes are absolutely unpredictable, when it comes to their lawless acts and reasons behind such acts.</p>
<p>Venezuela Navy Patrol Ship ANBV NAIGUATA (GCG-23) sank after collision with cruise ship RCGS RESOLUTE early in the morning Mar 30 northwest of La Tortuga island, Venezuela, Caribbean. Patrol ship was patrolling whatever she was patrolling, cruise ship was on Buenos Aires – Willemstad Curacao run, berthing there same day. According to Venezuelan Military command, RCGS RESOLUTE “in a cowardly and criminal manner fled collision site and didn’t try to rescue the crew of sinking ship”. All 44 crew of ANBV NAIGUATA were rescued, details unknown.</p>
<p>It is not known if there were passengers on board of cruise ship. Here’s the problem – Master of cruise ship could be so scared of possible Venezuela respond to collision, that he decided to flee. However cowardly or criminal his actions may look, he has his point, being afraid of Venezuela, inevitable arrest of the ship and following repercussions. Much more so if the ship had tourists on board. Venezuela is notorious for seizing absolutely innocent merchant ships and crews, and treating them like criminals. What should Venezuela do in this case, is anyone guess, but fair and impartial investigation seems highly unlikely outcome. One more issue – cruise ship was steaming towards port of destination, no dire straits or restricted fairways, and how did Navy ship manage to be hit by passenger ship, is anyone’s guess, too. It tells a lot about Venezuela Navy seamanship.</p>
<p>All in all, this story may be considered as a story with happy end. Nobody died, cruise ship with dozens of crew and probably, passengers, avoided very unpleasant arrest with unpredictable results, the only loss being Navy ship. No big deal, I’d say. One Navy ship more or one less, who cares? Master will be punished if found guilty, in Curacao or anywhere else, but one thing is for sure as of now – he already saved people he was responsible for, from a very bad possible outcome, be the ship seized by Venezuela.</p>
