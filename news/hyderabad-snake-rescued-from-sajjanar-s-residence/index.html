By | Published: 4:54 pm</p>
<p>Hyderabad: Cyberabad Police Commissioner V.C.Sajjanar had an uninvited guest at his residence in the form of a snake on Saturday early morning.</p>
<p>The five-foot long snake had sneaked into the Commissioner’s house from the garden in the premises.</p>
<p>Spotting the snake, fearing that it may be killed by others who fear it can harm them, Sajjanar immediately alerted R.Venkatesh Naik (32), a police constable attached to the Hussaini Alam police station.</p>
<p>Naik is considered to be an expert in catching and handling snakes in the police department. He is such an expert that the department considers him an ‘In-house snake catcher.’</p>
<p>Venkatesh rushed to the commissioner’s residence and rescued the snake, which he safely kept in the bag he brought with him.</p>
<p>“He promised that he would hand it over to Nehru Zoological Park authorities for its safety,” an official said.</p>
<p>The commissioner rewarded Venkatesh Naik for the good work he has been doing in rescuing snakes and then giving them new life.</p>
<p>In a public appeal, Sajjanar later said that one should not get scared when they see snakes. Instead they should alert the snake society or any person who would rescue it and hand it over to people who would take care of them.</p>

<h3 id="snake-venom-evolved-for-prey-not-protection">Snake venom evolved for prey, not protection</h3>
<p><img src="https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2020/venomoussnake.jpg" alt="img">

<p>It is estimated that every year, over 100,000 human deaths can be attributed to snakebite from the world&rsquo;s 700 venomous snake species—all inflicted in self-defense when the snakes feel threatened by encroaching humans. However, a new piece of research concludes that snake venom did not evolve as a defense mechanism.</p>
<p>Senior Lecturer Dr. Wolfgang Wüster, a world-renowned expert on snake venom evolution at Bangor University&rsquo;s School of Natural Sciences explained:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know that snake venom is used primarily for foraging; for overpowering and killing prey. However, we also know that snakes use their venom in self-defense—that&rsquo;s why so many people get bitten, and sometimes killed, by venomous snakes worldwide. We wanted to investigate whether defense was a driver in venom evolution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To provide efficient defense from a predator, the snake venom would need to provide sufficient instant pain to deter the predator and enable the snake to escape, much as a bee-sting hurts immediately.</p>
<p>A new paper published in Toxins reveals that surprisingly few venomous snake bites cause immediate pain, implying that the venom make-up has not evolved for a defensive primary purpose.</p>
<p>Bangor University student Harry Ward-Smith tested this hypothesis under Dr. Wüster&rsquo;s supervision. He gathered online survey responses from reptile keepers, herpetologists and fieldworkers, as part of his undergraduate degree in Zoology with Herpetology.</p>
<p>His survey, which gained nearly 400 responses world-wide, asked people working with snakes about the time-course of pain after bites they had sustained.</p>
<p>The results of around 600 experiences revealed that only a minority of bites and species regularly cause rapid, severe pain. Moreover, where early pain evolves during snake evolution, it is likely to be lost again in descendant lineages.</p>
<p>Dr. Kevin Arbuckle, Senior Lecturer in Biosciences (Evolutionary Biology) at Swansea University&rsquo;s Department of Biosciences and a co-author of the paper commented:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our results suggest little evidence for widespread evolution of venoms driven by their use in defense, though interesting exceptions likely exist such as the defensive use of venom &lsquo;spitting&rsquo; in some cobras, and these specific cases deserve further study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Wüster added: &ldquo;Even though we might have expected defending your life to be more important than feeding, it turns out that natural selection for diet does seem to be the main driver of venom evolution in snakes&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry Ward-Smith said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud to be in the minority of scientists who published their undergraduate work, writing this up took a lot of work even after graduating.</p>
<p>I hope studies like this start to encourage further research into the function and natural ecology of snake venom, particularly rear-fanged venomous snakes which we still know so little about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry Ward-Smith 24 from Wimbledon, London chose to study Masters in Zoology with Herpetology at Bangor University because it is the only degree in the UK which specialized in herpetology. He added that a bonus of studying at Bangor was that much of the UK&rsquo;s best white-water kayaking was within striking distance in Snowdonia.</p>
<p>Since graduating Harry has radio-tracked the Green Cat Snake within the Sakaerat Biosphere Reserve, Thailand and taught at further education in the UK. He is now considering further research opportunities, quite possibly a Ph.D. in the near future.</p>

<h3 id="wildlife-sos-rescues-cobra-snake-found-inside-scooter">Wildlife SOS rescues Cobra snake found inside scooter</h3>
<p><img src="https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2020-03/28/I_374cb100-7image_story.jpg" alt="img">
(MENAFN - IANS)</p>
<p>New Delhi, March 28 (IANSlife) Amidst the COVID-19 crisis, a large venomous cobra snake was found to have taken refuge inside a scooter parked at the Sarai Kale Khan bus station in Delhi. The owner of the scooter, who is a priest from a nearby temple was shocked when he suddenly heard loud hissing from inside his scooter.</p>
<p>Confronted by the cobra, he panicked and contacted the authorities who requested the Wildlife SOS team to coax the four-foot-long cobra snake out of the scooter and safely extricate the venomous reptile.</p>
<p>Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder and CEO of Wildlife SOS said, &ldquo;At this difficult time when Corona Virus crisis has resulted in a nationwide lockdown, it&rsquo;s important for us to help each other. It&rsquo;s essential to remain sensitive to the plight of people and animals during this unprecedented health crisis. We are grateful to the Police, Forest Department and the Delhi Government for permitting the operation of the rescue hotline (+91-9871963535) despite the nationwide lockdown.</p>
<p>Keeping with health and safety guidelines, all rescue staff have access to gloves, face masks, alcohol-based hand sanitizers and other requisite equipment to stay safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wasim Akram, Deputy Director-Special Projects, Wildlife SOS said &ldquo;when our hotline received a frantic call about a cobra at the Sarai Kale Khan bus station, we knew this was a critical call. Our team rushed to the location to help the public and removed the snake safely&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his nationwide speech said, &ldquo;People should be compassionate towards animals as they too have been impacted during this lockdown. Animals are finding it difficult to seek out food and water sources during this difficult time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Wildlife SOS team are working round the clock to provide essential service and protect the community and wildlife in distress.</p>
