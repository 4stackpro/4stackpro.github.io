SINGAPORE - NTUC FairPrice has closed its FairPrice Finest supermarket in Bedok Mall after one of its staff tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday (March 31).</p>
<p>In a statement on Wednesday, FairPrice said the store will be closed for three days for deep cleaning and will reopen on April 4.</p>
<p>The employee worked in the back end of the store replenishing stock and has minimal contact with customers, FairPrice said.</p>
<p>The employee has been quarantined and is being monitored by medical personnel, while all other staff who work in the store have been put on leave of absence.</p>
<p>The employee last worked on March 25, and was on leave on March 26 before visiting a doctor on March 27 with a fever. The employee is now on medical leave.</p>
<p>FairPrice said it is extending help to the affected staff and is assisting the authorities with contact tracing.</p>
<p>It also apologised for causing inconvenience to customers. A notice outside the supermarket directed customers to the nearest outlet at Block 212 Bedok North Street 1.</p>
<p>FairPrice said that it has stepped up its cleaning regime since the Covid-19 outbreak. Surfaces that are touched frequently - railings, trolleys, baskets and checkout counters - are cleaned every four hours.</p>
<p>Staff and suppliers have their temperatures taken at least twice a day and hand sanitisers are available for customers to use.</p>

<h3 id="sporeans-spotted-standing-at-least-1-metre-apart-while-queueing-at-bedok-mall">S’poreans spotted standing at least 1-metre apart while queueing at Bedok Mall</h3>
<p><img src="https://mothership.sg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bedok-mall-queue.jpg" alt="img">
Besides keeping up personal hygiene, the added precautionary measure that all Singaporeans are urged to take is to maintain social distancing.</p>
<p>A few announcements were made on Friday (Mar. 13) by the Multi-Ministry Taskforce Committee for Covid-19 with regard to social distancing.</p>
<p>Social distancing measures put in place</p>
<p>To set an example, the three key people of the committee were seated about one-metre apart from each other at the press conference yesterday.</p>
<p>In a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19 in Singapore, some entertainment outlets such as cinemas as well as eatery outlets will also have to ensure sufficient gaps between patrons from now on.</p>
<p>Apparently, some people are already practising social distancing in Singapore.</p>
<p>After all, it is neither rocket science nor new.</p>
<p>Keeping at least one-metre while queuing at Bedok Mall</p>
<p>A day before on Mar. 12, Ho Ching, the wife of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, already noticed some socially responsible Singaporeans keeping a safe distance from one another in a long queue at a linkway in Bedok Mall.</p>
<p>Here’s the photo:</p>
<p>Perhaps they were queueing for one of these promotions by the mall?</p>
<p>Ho Ching: No human tailgating</p>
<p>In the post, Ho also said that a safe distance during this period would be a two-metre gap and one should maintain this distance as they move forward in the queue.</p>
<p>One should not “tailgate” another in the queue as well, added Ho.</p>
<p>Social distancing difficult in some places</p>
<p>Some Singaporeans, however, find that maintaining such a distance will be difficult during peak hours and at crowded public areas such as the MRT stations, supermarkets and coffee shops.</p>
<p>Clearly, many still observe that social distancing is lacking in most places. Here are some comments:</p>
