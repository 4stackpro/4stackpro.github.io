‘Stranger Things’ Star Dacre Montgomery Becomes The Fantastic Four’s Human Torch In Cool Fan Art</p>
<p>New artwork imagines Stranger Things star Dacre Montgomery joining the Fantastic Four as the Human Torch.</p>
<p>With Marvel Studios now owning the rights to the Fantastic Four thanks to their parent company’s acquisition of Fox, we’ll soon be seeing the Human Torch grace the silver screen alongside the likes of Spider-Man and Captain Marvel. Marvel head honcho Kevin Feige is currently hard at work trying to integrate the Fox properties like X-Men and Fantastic Four into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, something that could take quite some time do as it’s an unprecedented task. Hopefully, the Marvel boss takes all the time he needs as history has shown that hastily working on and producing a bad Fantastic Fouris movie is the last thing fans want.</p>
<p>While we don’t know who Marvel’s Kevin Feige has in mind for The Human Torch, one name that keeps on coming up from fans is Stranger Things star Dacre Montgomery. When taking a look at his resume, it becomes increasingly clear that Dacre Montgomery would make a fantastic Human Torch for the eventual Fantastic Four film. Digital artist bobby_art recently took to Instagram to show us exactly what the Stranger Things star would like as the Human Torch in a brand new piece of fan art that you can check out below.</p>
<p>In the fan art, the Stranger Things star is rocking the Fantastic Four suit and had his eyes brimming with fire, a common prelude to the character’s “Flame on!” catchphrase. In the hit Netflix series, Dacre Montgomery plays a suave but jock-like character called Billy Hargrove. Eventually, the bully becomes a pawn of the show’s main villain, allowing Dacre Montgomery’s character to get a taste of his own medicine. The character of Human Torch could easily fit that bill as the Fantastic Four member loves to joke around and has a cocky attitude but is empathetic to others when the time comes.</p>
<p>Do you think Stranger Things star Dacre Montgomery should play the Human Torch? Do you want to see a Fantastic Four film? Comment below and let us know!</p>
<p>During Marvel Studios’ Hall H presentation at San Diego, a Fantastic Four film was not included in the Phase 4 slate. However, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige quickly confirmed a Fantastic Four project is being developed towards the end of the presentation.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for the latest news regarding Dacre Montgomery, Stranger Things and the future of the Fantastic Four characters in the MCU.</p>

The real reason 1994&rsquo;s Fantastic Four was never released</p>
<p>In the annals of superhero movie history, there&rsquo;s no story quite so involved and weird as that behind the infamous 1994 starring vehicle for Marvel&rsquo;s first family, The Fantastic Four. A cheap, slapdash production, it&rsquo;s one of those finished films that was never released, although bootleg copies have cropped up online in recent years. If your face is ever in need of strenuous and repeated palming, you can even watch the entire hot mess for free on YouTube, and gaze upon what passed for a Marvel film only 14 years before the MCU was inaugurated with Iron Man.</p>
<p>If you know anything about the picture, you&rsquo;ve probably heard that it was thrown together simply so that the studio could retain the rights (which otherwise would have reverted to Marvel), and that it was never even meant to be released. As it turns out, though, this may not necessarily be the case. Many of those involved with its production — including director Oley Sassone, whose eventual career highlight would be directing several episodes of Xena: Warrior Princess — insist that the flick was made with every intention of being released to theaters, and that its fate came down to one man whose name Marvel fans will surely recognize.</p>
<p>We took a deep dive to get to the bottom of what really happened to The Fantastic Four, the first attempt at bringing one of the most stubbornly unadaptable comic properties of all time to the screen, and to find out the real reason the film was never released.</p>

Actors who would be perfect for Marvel&rsquo;s Fantastic Four reboot</p>
<p>At long last, the Fantastic Four are coming to the MCU. Cornerstone heroes since their debut in the 1960s, the Four promise to bring even more science, magic, and drama into the cinematic mix. Will the Thing and the Hulk exchange tailoring tips? Could the old Avengers Tower, stripped of its insignia, become the Four&rsquo;s iconic Baxter Building? The questions are limitless — and soon to be answered.</p>
<p>Casting the Four correctly will be crucial. Their status within Marvel&rsquo;s decade-spanning history is one thing, but there&rsquo;s also the matter of their previous movies, and oh, what a rocky road it&rsquo;s been for the Four on film. Whoever puts on the bright blue jumpsuits will need to wipe away memories of the decent-to-bad 2000s movies, the utter trainwreck that was 2015&rsquo;s attempt, and the 1994 production so infamously awful that it never even saw an official release. What titans of cinema could accomplish this feat in a MCU reboot? We have some ideas. Here are our picks for the Four, their friends, and their foes, from the big green goddess to the rider of the spaceways.
