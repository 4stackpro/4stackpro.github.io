Sushant Singh Rajput’s suicide was a major blow to the already grieving Bollywood. After losing its gems like Irrfan Khan, Rishi Kapoor and Wajid Khan, no one was ready to take another mighty bow in the form of SSR. While he was always academically inclined and acting was never his childhood passion, he ultimately found himself ditching the Standford University scholarship and making his way to the city of dreams, Mumbai. RIP Sushant Singh Rajput: Keerthy Suresh, Dulquer Salmaan and Other South Celebs Shocked to Hear About The Bollywood Actor’s Demise, Offer Condolence On Twitter.</p>
<p>Narrating details about how he arrived in Mumbai, Sushant in his earlier conversation with Hindustan Times said, “I felt the need to meet a girl, and that led me to Shiamak Davar’s group. My life went into a spin from that point on. Instead of heading to Stanford University from where I had a scholarship offer, I dropped out of college and landed in Versova, in a 1RK (room kitchen) that I shared with six others.”</p>
<p>Crediting Shah Rukh Khan for helping him in his early days as a student, Sushant reminisced the impact DDLJ had his on his life. And mind you, it wasn’t acting related. “I was a huge fan of Shah Rukh Khan. I remember watching Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (DDLJ) and thinking now here’s a cool dude. He is a great performer, but that’s not what impacted me most: Shah Rukh helped me sort out my confusion about who I should be. This was in the early ’90s and the economy was just opening up – we were seeing Coke cans for the first time, international brands were coming in, and I was fascinated…yet confused. I didn’t know whether to embrace the West or be loyal to our culture. At this point came DDLJ, I was in Class VI, and Raj showed me that it was cool to have a beer, but then he also waited for Simran’s dad’s approval. There was a balance. It was the perfect marriage of an aspiring India and an India trying to hold on to its culture,” he explained in his same interaction. Sushant Singh Rajput, Aged 34, Commits Suicide; Twitterati Shocked To Hear About The Death Of Bollywood Actor.</p>
<p>Elaborating on how he was a shy performer, Sushant also recalled the times he would dance on Kabhie Khushi Kabhi Gham song behind closed doors. “While preparing for engineering entrance exams, I’d sometimes take a break and stand in front of the mirror and lip-sync to Suraj Hua Maddham. I used to do these things but not with the ambition of becoming an actor. It was just for fun. Honestly, even if I would’ve been offered a role back then, I would’ve refused because I was a complete introvert. The lip-syncing and posing would happen only in front of the mirror, with just me in the audience,” he said.

<p>Sushant rose to fame as a boy-next-door in Ekta Kapoor’s Pavitra Rishta. Later he took his big plunge and signed Kai Po Che with Rajkummar Rao and Amit Sadh. His last release, Chhichhore was a huge hit at the box office but this was clearly not his last release. Sushant was waiting for Dil Bechara, an official remake The Fault in our Stars to hit the screens.</p>

We live in a TV era where the male actors get very few opportunities to portray roles that are meaty enough and challenging. Of course, it is the fairer s*x that usually takes away the best of roles, and the limelight.</p>
<p>But what about the talented men who have stood their ground and have taken away all the appreciation from critics and well as viewers with their cross-dressed avatar?</p>
<p>Well, it is not easy for a man to get into the shoes of a woman, and display the characteristics of a lady, being dressed up as one… Here we are bringing out a compilation of such men who have entertained the masses with their ‘womanly’ looks…</p>
<p>Ali Asgar, Kiku Sharda and Sunil Grover in Comedy Nights with Kapil</p>
<p>Undoubtedly Comedy Nights with Kapil (Colors) is one of the most popular programs of Indian television. Apart from the antics of Kapil Sharma or the vast celebrity presence, what has clicked excellently with the audience are the roles of Gutthi, Palak and Dadi. These roles of women are enacted by none other than Sunil Grover, Kiku Sharda and Ali Asgar. These three men cross-dressed as women, have made the audience laugh with their style, sheer screen presence and attitude.
