<p>(CNN) Carol Barr, wife of US Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky, died suddenly in their Lexington home Tuesday night, according to the congressman&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congressman Andy Barr&rsquo;s wife Carol passed away suddenly tonight at the family home in Lexington. During this tragic time, we respectfully ask for privacy for Congressman Barr and his family to grieve Mrs. Barr being called home to heaven,&rdquo; Mary Rosado, Barr&rsquo;s chief of staff, wrote in a statement.</p>
<p>Carol Barr was 39 and is survived by two daughters &ndash; Eleanor and Mary Clay.</p>
<p>According to a press release from Fayette County Coroner Gary W. Ginn, the 39-year-old&rsquo;s cause of death, determined from preliminary autopsy findings, was Mitral Valve Prolapse (Floppy Valve Syndrome). The manner of death was natural, according to the release.</p>
<p>The heart has four valves to make sure blood is pumped in the right direction. One of those valves, the mitral valve, can become damaged so that it can&rsquo;t direct the flow of blood properly. Sometimes people are born with this condition, other times it results from heart disease or infections. If the prolapse becomes very severe, the heart can no longer pump blood properly, leading to death.</p>

LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) — U.S. Rep. Andy Barr expressed “profound grief” Wednesday over the unexpected death of his 39-year-old wife at their home in Kentucky the night before. His initial statement provided no details about a cause.</p>
<p>Eleanor Carol Leavell Barr died in Lexington, the Republican congressman&rsquo;s chief of staff, Mary Rosado said in a statement. The Fayette County coroner was called to the family’s home following the announcement of her passing, WKYT-TV reported.</p>
<p>“In this moment of profound grief and heartbreak, we are so grateful for the gift and blessing of Carol’s life, for her strong faith in her Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, for the comfort of fond memories and her victory in heaven and for all those who have surrounded Carol’s family, the girls and I with beautiful expressions of love, compassion and sympathy,” Barr&rsquo;s statement said. He also asked for prayers for his daughters.</p>
<p>U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement he and his wife are “stunned and heartbroken” by the news, and send their “sincere condolences to Andy, their family and his staff at this terribly painful time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Condolences for her passing flowed in through the night from other Kentucky politicians, including Gov. Andy Beshear and U.S. Sen. Rand Paul.</p>
<p>Barr, who went by Carol, grew up in the state, attended the University of Kentucky, and married Andy Barr in 2008. The couple went on to have two children. She had worked for Pfizer, and as the executive director of Lexington’s Henry Clay Center for Statesmanship.</p>
<p>Rep. Barr represents Kentucky&rsquo;s 6th district, which includes the cities of Lexington, Richmond, and Frankfort.</p>

Congressman Andy Barr says he&rsquo;s been working to help hospitals and businesses here in the state, but he may be called to the capitol to cast his vote for a federal coronavirus bill.</p>
<p>Barr says he supports the legislation and is only concerned that it won&rsquo;t get the relief Kentuckians need soon enough.</p>
<p>He says he believes there are three components that will help the commonwealth most: a one-time rebate check given to middle class workers and families who earn a certain amount of money, low interest loans for small businesses that are keeping its employees on the payroll and a 500 billion dollar lending program provided to larger companies.</p>
<p>Barr also says the bill works to support the heroes working in hospitals in getting them more PPE and he recognizes that local governments are hurting, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I received a letter from Mayor Linda Gorton today emphasizing that Lexington is going to be cash strapped as a result of the lack of economic activity and therefore the tax base is coming down, so part of this federal legislation will assist state and local governments as well,&rdquo; Barr said.</p>
<p>Barr commented on the president&rsquo;s goal to reopen the country by Easter, saying he&rsquo;s been speaking with medical experts who say it&rsquo;s too soon to know when things will go back to normal.
