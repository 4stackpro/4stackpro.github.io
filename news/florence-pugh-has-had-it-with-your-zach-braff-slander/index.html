Florence Pugh and Zach Braff have been dating for at least a year, and fans of the former remain mad about it.

<p>Florence Pugh and Zach Braff have been dating for at least a year, and fans of the former remain mad about it. Possibly because the two make an unlikely couple — what with the sizable age gap and apparent divergence in social circles — and possibly because much of the country is bored stuck at home with nothing but an internet connection and the ingredients for fluffy coffee. Whatever the reason, Pugh is asking nicely and at length for everyone to shut the hell up about it.</p>
<p>Pugh posed a video to her Instagram on Wednesday telling her followers that the comments on a photo she’d posted days before of Braff on his birthday received so much hate, she had to turn off the comments on her page, and she is not having that. “Within about eight minutes of the photo being posted, I had about 70 percent of the comments hurling abuse and being horrid and basically bullying someone on my page,” she said. “I will not allow that behavior on that page,” she added, emphasizing that her platform was created to spread positivity — like through her cooking and singing — and that anyone who exhibits such behavior is welcome to unfollow her.</p>
<p>Pugh continued, “I do not need you to tell me who I should or should not love and I would never in my life — ever ever — tell anyone who they can or cannot love. It is not your place, and really it has nothing to do with you.”</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time Pugh has addressed fans’ making fun of her boyfriend. In December, someone responded to an Instagram comment Braff left on Pugh’s page with “You’re 44 years old.” Which was true (until this week!) and riled up Pugh enough to get her to retort, “And he got it.”</p>
<p>Anyway, acceptance is important.

<h3 id="florence-pugh-gets-support-from-ariana-grande-on-zach-braff-relationship">Florence Pugh gets support from Ariana Grande on Zach Braff relationship</h3>
<p><img src="https://micky.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screenshot_59.jpg" alt="img">
Little Women star Florence Pugh is not alone in fighting against hateful online comments.</p>
<p>Pugh recently received support from fellow celebrity Ariana Grande after the former received a deluge of negative comments on her Instagram for posting about her 45-year-old boyfriend, Zach Braff.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old The Falling actress posted a photo of Braff in her account to honor him on his birthday. Captioned with good wishes, Pugh did not expect the post to be filled with criticisms and bullying from people.</p>
<p>The young English actress decided to speak against the hateful comments by posting again on her account a 3-minute video.</p>
<p>She said, “I am 24 years old. I do not need you to tell me who I should and should not love. And I would never in my life ever, ever tell anyone who they can and cannot love. It is not your place. And really, it has nothing to do with you.”</p>
<p>Grande reposted Pugh’s video</p>
<p>One of the many who has seen Pugh’s video was Grande, who left comments on the post to affirm everything that the Outlaw King star had said. The “7 Rings” singer also reposted Pugh’s video on her Instagram story via a screenshot.</p>
<p>Grande wrote in the story post, “Beautifully worded and deeply appreciated. Sharing special, personal life things that make u happy on the internet can be truly traumatic.”</p>
<p>Grande, who has always been open about her relationships in the past, now resonates with Pugh’s sentiments. According to her post, she is done with posting on the Internet about her personal life, especially about her relationships to protect her loved ones and herself.</p>
<p>Grande also quoted Pugh’s line: “Being hateful is not trendy.”</p>
<p>The 26-year-old pop star also wrote lines of praises and appreciation for Pugh for expressing her thoughts perfectly and for doing so for the world to know.</p>
<p>Grande has reportedly been dating Dalton Gomez, a Los Angeles real estate agent. However, the “Thank U Next” songstress has never confirmed the news on her social media accounts.</p>
<p>Pugh and Braff relationship timeline</p>
<p>It is not the first time that Pugh has received negative comments for her 21-year gap relationship with Braff. The two have also been very lowkey about their relationship, rarely making an appearance on each other’s social media accounts.</p>
<p>According to People, the friendship of the two dated way back in 2018. Pugh and Braff then got to work together in a 2019 short film by the latter. The couple also shares common friends and hang out together with family.</p>
<p>Pugh is set to appear as Yelena Belova in the upcoming film Black Widow which will premiere on Nov. 6, 2020.</p>

<h3 id="zach-braff-says-anne-hathaways-dad-almost-fought-him">Zach Braff Says Anne Hathaway&rsquo;s Dad Almost Fought Him</h3>
<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/zach-braff-is-seen-in-hollywood-on-june-23-2014-in-los-news-photo-1586442718.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.392xh;0,0.0426xh&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">
Zach Braff says Anne Hathaway’s dad was almost ready to throw hands during the 2012 Les Misérables movie premiere.</p>
<p>Gerald Hathaway was fully ready to fight him but backed down once he realized it was a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>It’s wild celebrity story time, so buckle up: Apparently, Zach Braff—aka J.D. on Scrubs and Florence Pugh’s boyfriend—is out here saying that Anne Hathaway’s dad (Gerald Hathaway) almost threw hands at him at the premiere of Les Misérables back in 2012. It’s a hella-weird story to unearth rn, but it has so many twists and turns that you have no choice but to be entertained by it. Without further ado, let’s drive right in!</p>
<p>Zach gave all the juicy details on this almost brawl during his and Donald Faison’s Fake Doctors, Real Friends podcast. “I know Anne Hathaway as an acquaintance,” he began. “I’m walking toward her to say congratulations [and] her father stands up and gives me this look.” According to Zach, Mr. Hathaway’s look was alarmingly on par with, “‘I’m going to kill this motherf*cker. He’s got the balls to crash my daughter’s premiere? I’m going to strangle him!’”</p>
<p>So&hellip;exactly what prompted the hostility? Well, Anne’s dad confused Zach with Anne’s ex-boyfriend Raffaello Follieri. Raffaello and Anne dated from 2004 to 2008, but they broke up just a few months before he was sentenced to four years in prison for wire fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy. And honestly&hellip;this mix-up makes total sense when you look at Zach and Raffaello.</p>
<p>For reference, here’s Zach:</p>

<p>And here’s Raffaello:</p>

<p>“I got within 10 feet of [Gerald] and his face just f*cking broke,” Zach continued. “[He] sighed with a breath of relief realizing it was me and not the ex-boyfriend.” Poor Zach!!!</p>
<p>The good news here is that Zach and Anne’s dad did not* get into any sort of altercation (because that would be a shitty thing to do at a movie premiere). I bet Anne’s relieved too.
