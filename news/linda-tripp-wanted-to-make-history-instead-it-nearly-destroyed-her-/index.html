Instead, she became a supporting player in Clinton’s impeachment, stuck forever in the role of the duplicitous harpy who betrayed then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky by secretly recording their conversations.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“Central casting couldn’t have cast a better villain,” she told the podcast “Slow Burn” in 2018. “The entire country had decided who I was, and it was evil incarnate.”</p>
<p>Unfair? Of course it’s unfair. History is a narrative written by the winners, and Clinton was acquitted and thrived. Thanks, in part, to the #MeToo movement, Lewinsky has been able to transform her image from oversexed intern to a more accurate and nuanced characterization: a naive young woman swept up in an affair with a powerful man — in fact, the most powerful man in the world.</p>
<p>But Tripp’s legacy is frozen in time: a big, brash caricature of a woman with bad highlights and questionable motives. That image was sealed in popular culture by actor John Goodman, who dressed in drag to play her on “Saturday Night Live.” How did it feel to be the most hated woman in America? “Feels like high school,” Goodman-as-Tripp giggled.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>But it all started with a book proposal.</p>
<p>The New Jersey native had spent two decades as a secretary for the military, following her Army husband around the globe. After their separation in 1990, she landed the most glamorous job of her life — working at the White House.</p>
<p>It was a blissful two years, despite her divorce. Then, Clinton defeated Bush and the gang from Arkansas descended on the executive mansion. Tripp, a career civil servant, stayed on to work for White House counsel Bernard Nussbaum and deputy counsel Vince Foster. She didn’t like them, but they liked her work: After two years, she was transferred to the Pentagon’s public affairs office — a job with higher pay and prestige because she was now a political appointee.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Tripp always maintained that she was never motivated by politics, that she was just deeply troubled by Clinton’s behavior toward women. Armed with little more than suspicions, she approached her friend Lucianne Goldberg, a literary agent known in conservative circles as a vocal critic of Clinton. A proposal was written for a book focused on Clinton and a ghostwriter was secured, but the book was never completed or sold.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Then in 1996, fate handed her the proof she needed: Monica Lewinsky. The former White House intern, still in the midst of her two-year affair with the president, was transferred to the Pentagon in an effort to limit their contact. At 46, Tripp was 24 years older than Lewinsky, but the two became close. Although some co-workers described Tripp as abrasive and overbearing, others said she was a maternal figure, nurturing and understanding. Lewinsky began to share details of her tortured affair with a married man — and not just any married man.</p>
<p>After a year of listening to Lewinsky — they talked up to a dozen times a day — Tripp was contacted by a Newsweek reporter digging into allegations about Clinton’s womanizing. Unnerved, Tripp went back to Goldberg, shared what she knew about Lewinsky and again pitched a book. Goldberg encouraged Tripp to secretly tape her conversations, and the trap was set: Tripp recorded 22 hours of Lewinsky’s confessions and encouraged the young woman to save a blue Gap dress with a stain of presidential semen instead of having it cleaned — just in case she needed evidence of the affair.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>In January 1998, Tripp called independent counsel Ken Starr and, soon after, agreed to wear a wire to meet Lewinsky at a local hotel, where FBI agents confronted the unsuspecting former intern.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>After the betrayal was fully revealed, Lewinsky told the grand jury: “I’m really sorry for everything that’s happened. And I hate Linda Tripp.”</p>
<p>While politicians debated whether Clinton’s infidelity was America’s business or just his wife’s, the impeachment centered, properly, on the question of perjury: Did the president lie under oath? But Tripp was more fixated on the sex and defended her actions based on her moral code: The president was damaging the reputation of the Oval Office.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Reporters dug into her background and discovered her parents had divorced because of her father’s blatant philandering. The reasons for Tripp’s own divorce were not clear.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most shocking to Washington insiders were Tripp’s secret recordings. It’s hard enough to know whom to trust in this most transactional of cities, but taping was next-level betrayal. The fact that, as a woman, Tripp had broken the confidence of a friend who had trusted her with the most intimate details of her life was beyond the pale. And it was against the law: Maryland, where Tripp lived, doesn’t allow recordings without both parties’ consent. She was investigated, but the case was eventually dropped.</p>
<p>In 1999, Tripp defended herself in a CNN interview, saying she had “no choice” but to tape the conversations. “How would I prove I was telling the truth?” Tripp said on “Larry King Live.” “All I can say is Monica made choices, the president made choices, and I was forced to make choices.”</p>
<p>By the late 1990s, Tripp had become a hero to Clinton’s conservative critics, and she remained so for the rest of her life. On the last day of Clinton’s presidency, she was fired from her Pentagon job because, as a political appointee, she had refused to resign.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>And then she disappeared from the landscape. She remarried and moved to Middleburg, Va., where she ran a holiday store called “Christmas Sleigh.” She lost weight and became chic and polished, almost unrecognizable from the woman in the headlines. And that was pretty much it until 2018, the 20th anniversary of the scandal.</p>
<p>Last July, she delivered remarks at an event for National Whistleblower Day on Capitol Hill, where she said her actions were motivated not by left or right politics but by right and wrong.</p>
<p>“We’re different,” she told the group. “We’re compelled to act. There comes a point where it’s no longer a choice. And despite the hardships and the personal pain — not only to us but to our families — when asked most of us say we would do it all again. You know, in my case, had the circumstances been similar and had the sitting incumbent been a Republican, I would’ve acted no differently at all.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>That summer, she also sat down for the “Slow Burn” interview. She said she feared for her life and believed the Clintons would have her killed.</p>
<p>And her betrayal of Lewinsky?</p>
<p>“Even though I believed it was the right thing, I couldn’t face her, because I knew she would never in a million years understand,” Tripp said. “I kept holding on to thinking that had that been my daughter, I would want to have had someone stop it — kind of like ripping a Band-Aid off a wound. It has to be done. It’s not something you enjoy, but you do what you have to do. But there was no enjoyment in it. None.”</p>
<p>Tripp died this week not of coronavirus but of cancer, according to media reports. When news of her condition went public, Lewinsky tweeted: “No matter the past, upon hearing Linda Tripp is very seriously ill, I hope for her recovery. I can’t imagine how difficult this is for her family.”</p>
<p>And no, Tripp never did write the book that started it all. History will remember her, just not in the way she ever hoped or imagined.

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Linda Tripp, whose secretly taped conversations with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky provided evidence of an affair with President Bill Clinton that led to his impeachment, died Wednesday. She was 70.</p>
<p>Tripp’s death was confirmed by attorney Joseph Murtha, but he provided no details. She had been treated for breast cancer in 2001.</p>
<p>Tripp was a 48-year-old divorced mother of two living in Columbia, Maryland, when she became a controversial national figure as the Clinton impeachment investigation unfolded in 1998. For some she was a heroine who stood up for the rule of law; for others, she was a schemer for profit who betrayed a friend while posing as a motherly confidant.</p>
<p>As news broke that Tripp was near death, Lewinsky tweeted: “no matter the past, upon hearing that linda tripp is very seriously ill, i hope for her recovery. i can’t imagine how difficult this is for her family.”</p>
<p>Lewinsky was 22 when she worked as a White House intern in summer 1995. That November she and Clinton began their affair, which continued after she was hired for a West Wing job. Reassigned to the Pentagon in April 1996, Lewinsky met Tripp and they became friends.</p>
<p>Tripp provided nearly 20 hours of recorded conversations with Lewinsky to special counsel Ken Starr, who had been investigating a potpourri of allegations against the president since his appointment in 1994. His blockbuster report, which included a graphic account of the sex scandal, became a bestseller.</p>
<p>Tripp first told the lawyers of Paula Jones about the Clinton-Lewinsky affair in advance of their deposition of the president. Jones had sued Clinton in 1994 for sexual harassment while working for the state of Arkansas in 1991 during Clinton’s governorship; her attorneys were looking for evidence of Clinton affairs to support her claim.</p>
<p>Clinton denied during the 1998 deposition for the Jones lawsuit that he had “sexual relations” with Lewinsky. His denial became central to an article of impeachment charging perjury. A second article charging obstruction of justice stemmed from allegations of encouraging perjury by witnesses and other wrongful actions.</p>
<p>The House impeached Clinton in December 1998. After a five-week trial in the Senate, senators rejected both articles on Feb. 12, 1999.</p>
<p>While defending the taping as necessary to protect herself if her credibility were questioned, Tripp also consulted with a New York literary agent before beginning her secret recordings. Her initial concerns proved warranted when officials and pundits questioned her motives and attacked her character.</p>
<p>Tripp soon became a recognizable member of the wide cast of characters in the impeachment drama, so much so that actor John Goodman appeared as Tripp several times on “Saturday Night Live.”</p>
<p>At the time of the scandal Tripp had been a career civil service employee, and since 1994 she had worked for the Pentagon arranging tours of U.S. military bases for select civilians. Before that she had spent a year working on Clinton’s transition team and had been a confidential assistant in the office of the White House counsel in George H.W. Bush’s administration.</p>
<p>In 1997 Tripp played a role in another Clinton scandal when she provided support for Kathleen E. Willey, a White House staffer who alleged that the president had kissed and fondled her in a White House office.</p>
<p>Having been executive assistant to White House deputy counsel Vince Foster, she also provided testimony in Starr’s investigation of Foster’s 1993 suicide.</p>
<p>In January 2001, Tripp lost her Pentagon job and nearly $100,000 annual salary when the Bush administration came into office.</p>
<p>She then sued the Defense Department, alleging that a Pentagon official released confidential personal information about her to The New Yorker magazine in 1998. As part of a settlement reached in November 2003, she received more than $595,000, a retroactive promotion and retroactive pay at a higher salary for the final three years of her employment.

<h3 id="linda-tripp-key-figure-in-clinton-impeachment-dies-aged-70">Linda Tripp, key figure in Clinton impeachment, dies aged 70</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4224861&amp;origw=1440" alt="img">
Linda Tripp, whose secretly recorded conversations with White House intern Monica Lewinsky led to the 1998 impeachment of president Bill Clinton, has died aged 70.</p>
<p>Tripp was working as a public affairs specialist at the Pentagon where she reportedly became friends with Ms Lewinsky, who previously was a White House intern.</p>
<p>She made secret tapes of conversations with Ms Lewinsky about her affair with Mr Clinton and passed them on to an independent prosecutor.</p>
<p>The investigation, led by Kenneth Starr, ultimately led to Mr Clinton’s impeachment. He was acquitted by the US Senate and remained in office.</p>
<p>Her death was confirmed by lawyer Joseph Murtha who said she died on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tripp’s son-in-law Thomas Foley told the New York Post that Tripp’s unspecified illness was unrelated to the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Tripp was a secretary in the White House counsel’s office in the early years of Mr Clinton’s presidency before she was transferred to the Pentagon’s public affairs office and befriended Lewinsky, 24 years her junior. As the two became close and Lewinsky revealed her past sexual relationship with Clinton, Tripp began clandestinely recording their private telephone conversations in which Lewinsky documented her affair with the president in graphic detail.</p>
<p>Tripp ultimately turned over hours of those tapes to Mr Starr, who was investigating potential wrongdoing by Clinton, the former Arkansas governor, stemming from the failed Whitewater real estate venture in the Ozarks.</p>
<p>Tripp was granted immunity from illegal wiretapping charges in exchange for the recordings. – Agencies
