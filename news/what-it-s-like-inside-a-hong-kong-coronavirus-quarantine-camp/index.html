(CNN) If you&rsquo;d asked me a month ago what I thought I&rsquo;d be up to on my 30th birthday, being confined to a government quarantine center in Hong Kong wasn&rsquo;t near the top of the list.</p>
<p>But the coronavirus pandemic has derailed a lot of plans &ndash; and even in a city that&rsquo;s grown used to upheaval, the recent sudden shift in response to a surge in Covid-19 cases has been startling.</p>
<p>For me, it&rsquo;s meant going from planning holidays and parties, to being escorted from my apartment by hazmat-suited health care workers and driven to a quarantine facility for two weeks of isolation. For everyone else, it&rsquo;s meant a speedy reassessment of how to respond to a global crisis , on both a personal and societal level &ndash; and a new understanding of just how strict the measures to fight coronavirus might have to be.</p>
<p>Holiday camp turned quarantine camp</p>
<p>Life in quarantine &ndash; with its regimented meals, temperature checks and PPE-wearing staff &ndash; feels like an odd mix of being in school, at camp, and in prison. My facility, in Lei Yue Mun Park, is normally a leafy holiday village in the east of Hong Kong Island. Now, some 100 temporary single-room homes have been constructed in neat rows on an outdoor sports pitch, surrounded by high yellow barriers, housing anyone who the health department decides needs to be isolated after coming into contact with a person who has tested positive for coronavirus.</p>
<p>This holiday park is one of several facilities being used as coronavirus quarantine centers in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Since March, that number has surged. Until recently, Hong Kong &ndash; which had been fighting the spread of the virus since January &ndash; appeared to have it under control, with fewer than 10 new cases being recorded each day. It seemed as though the city&rsquo;s swift public health measures had worked, infection rates were staying low, and the mask-wearing, hand-sanitizing population could relax a bit.</p>
<p>But relaxing is not the way to control contagion. Almost as soon as revelers started packing bars, restaurants and hiking trails again, the whispered rumors started growing louder &ndash; of infected Hong Kongers fleeing Europe and the US, of symptomless spreaders, of a colleague&rsquo;s sore throat, a friend&rsquo;s dry cough. Soon, the rumors were borne out by numbers: infections rose from 95 cases on March 1st, to 317 on March 22nd. A long-dreaded &ldquo;second wave&rdquo; of the outbreak seemed to be bearing down on the city.</p>
<p>I ended up being covid-exposed after two friends tested positive. I had no major symptoms, which meant I couldn&rsquo;t get tested myself. But the health department thought I was at enough risk to be taken away for proper isolation and monitoring, while my mildly-symptomatic friends were taken to hospital for tests and treatment, and anyone who&rsquo;d had briefer contact with them self-isolated at home.</p>
<p>Not that everything about the quarantine process went smoothly. After being told to pack my bags for a long stay, I ended up self-isolating for a week, with no information about how or when I would get picked up. While quarantined friends sent videos of their journeys, rooms and meals, my daily calls to authorities were met with the same answer &ndash; there was a list, I was on it, but there had been a lot of positive cases recently, and there was no way of knowing how long I would have to wait, sorry.</p>
<p>And self-isolation was made more complicated by my roommate, who risked infection just by staying in our apartment &ndash; not only was I isolating from my friends and colleagues, I had to stay away from her as much as I could too. We ended up only emerging from our bedrooms to pick up food deliveries, wore face masks and rubber gloves on the way to and from the bathroom, and disinfected everything we touched.</p>
<p>A hazmat-suited medical worker takes Tara to the quarantine bus, to the surprise of passers-by.</p>
<p>So by the time the health department minibus arrived outside my apartment block to take me away two Fridays ago, it was a relief to open the door to a hazmat-suited worker. He stuck a thermometer in my ear in front of my wide-eyed neighbors, and attracted stares from passers-by as we walked down the road. The minibus already had two passengers on it, and picked up another on the way to the camp, which felt like a surprisingly lax approach to social distancing guidelines.</p>
<p>Health workers prepare to take passengers off the bus and into the quarantine camp.</p>
<p>After such a long period of waiting and uncertainty, and a late evening drive across Hong Kong, entering the camp itself felt more like the opening of a film than real life. We passed through security checkpoints manned by more PPE-wearing staff, had another temperature check, then were ushered off the bus into a waiting room for our quarantine welcome briefing. In Cantonese and English, we were told we&rsquo;d get three meals a day, which we could pick from a menu; that we needed to take our temperature at 8am and 4pm; that we could message one phone number if we had questions or requests, and call another number if we had health issues, or developed coronavirus symptoms. Oh, and that we would all remain at the camp for two weeks &ndash; which meant I would only emerge from isolation at midnight on my birthday. It was an unexpected development; but given everything else, that kind of thing didn&rsquo;t feel important anymore.</p>
<p>A tour of Tara&rsquo;s quarantine room.</p>
<p>The camp was nothing like what I&rsquo;d expected. Videos from other facilities forwarded between WhatsApp groups showed bare rooms in fixtureless unused apartment blocks, leaky toilets, and barred windows. But when we were led through the barriers to the rows of identical little huts, and given the keys to our temporary one-room homes, it felt like a first night in a cozy university dorm. The room&rsquo;s new furniture still had its Ikea labels on, and everything smelled of disinfectant. A welcome pack containing noodles, shampoo, shower gel, and toothpaste sat on a desk next to a kettle and hairdryer. Almost as soon as I&rsquo;d unpacked, a WhatsApp message asked me to pick the week&rsquo;s food options from the huge menu &ndash; a mix of Asian and Western dishes, with vegetarian options, for free. And a sign on the back of the door even addressed the occupants as &lsquo;campers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Instructions for quarantine camp inmates</p>
<p>Another surprise was the freedom to walk around outside between the rows of huts &ndash; while wearing a mask, of course &ndash; to get fresh air and exercise, rather than spending two weeks boxed into a single room. Inmates can even talk to each other, although there are signs around the camp telling us to &ldquo;avoid gatherings&rdquo; to &ldquo;prevent the spread of novel coronavirus&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s sound advice (that we could have all probably used a few weeks ago).</p>
<p>Sound advice &ndash; social distancing is encouraged to prevent the spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p>Other camp inhabitants who were exposed to coronavirus include bar staff, a flight attendant, and a retired couple living in one of the double-sized rooms opposite mine. There&rsquo;s capacity for around 130 people, and about half of the rooms were occupied at my last count, although there are arrivals and departures most days.</p>
<p>After more than a week of quarantine living, things have settled into a surprisingly normal routine. Meals are brought around on trollies and carts, and deposited on trays outside our doors. (They&rsquo;re usually rice, noodle or pasta-based, with some kind of meat or vegetable sauce, and occasional surprises like dumplings &ndash; pretty bland, but mostly edible.) Care packages from outside are allowed, so friends and colleagues have sent snacks, drinks and an internet booster to shore up the shaky wifi. Prior to now, I&rsquo;d already been working from home for three months &ndash; so doing the same from a quarantine camp hasn&rsquo;t made much of a difference. Hong Kong apartments are small enough that living out of one room doesn&rsquo;t feel like a hardship, and while spot temperature checks and calls from the camp doctor can be annoying, they&rsquo;re all for the good of my health &ndash; and everybody else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Breakfast time &ndash; meals are left outside our rooms three times a day.</p>
<p>Friends in the US and UK have found all of this baffling. If they thought they were covid-positive, they&rsquo;d be unlikely to get tested, and would be told to self-isolate at home unless they actually needed to go to hospital. By comparison, getting housed in a government facility because you <em>might</em> have a <em>chance</em> of catching the virus seems like an overabundance of caution. But it&rsquo;s a testament to how serious the Hong Kong government is about clamping down on cases imported from overseas, and pushing back on local complacency. Anyone who tests positive gets hospitalized, even if they show no symptoms and aren&rsquo;t a high-risk case &ndash; and they stay in hospital until they return two negative tests. Quarantine measures go even further &ndash; now, anyone arriving in Hong Kong from abroad must self-isolate at their home or in a hotel for two weeks, monitored by a tracking bracelet.</p>
<p>And the top-down efforts have been matched by Hong Kong residents changing their own behavior &ndash; face mask-wearing, hand sanitizing, working and learning from home, and various methods of social distancing have been a normal feature of life here since January. Now, the uptick in infections from a couple of weeks ago appears to be falling again. While Hong Kong&rsquo;s response may seem heavy-handed to outsiders, and sometimes confusing and impenetrable to the people caught up in it, something is clearly working. This combination of decisive government action and wider social pressure could serve as a model for other countries facing a post-lockdown future &ndash; but, as the rest of the world joins Hong Kong&rsquo;s reality of the past few months, it&rsquo;s hard to know how many of these changes will become our new normal.</p>
<p>Despite having the longest and most unusual quarantine experience of my friends, I feel very lucky &ndash; I haven&rsquo;t tested positive, I&rsquo;m not in hospital, camp conditions are good, and I&rsquo;ve received endless messages of support from family, friends and colleagues. The watchword of the global coronavirus response has been isolation; but I haven&rsquo;t felt isolated at all, and it seems like the people of Hong Kong have gained collective strength from experiencing all of this together. So, I might be spending my birthday alone; but thanks to the power of mass video calls, I won&rsquo;t be spending it lonely. And being able to leave quarantine and head back home at the end of it will be the best gift of all.

<h3 id="saudi-arabia-declares-ceasefire-in-yemen-over-coronavirus">Saudi Arabia declares ceasefire in Yemen over coronavirus</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191119145502-yemens-huthi-rebels-generic-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) The Saudi-led coalition fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen has declared a two-week ceasefire in a bid to stem the spread of the coronavirus in the war-torn country, according to the state-run Saudi Press Agency (SPA).</p>
<p>The ceasefire in the five-year conflict was set to begin Thursday, according to coalition spokesman Col. Turki al-Malki. SPA said the move was prompted by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres&rsquo; call for a pause of hostilities in the country in order to counter the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p>The coronavirus has now infected more than 1.5 million people and killed over 88,000 worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>Malki also said the temporary ceasefire would pave the way for talks between the Saudi-backed government in Aden, and Iran-backed Houthi rebels based in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa.</p>
<p>The ceasefire would create the environment for the UN &ldquo;to hold a meeting between the legitimate government and the Houthis, and a military team from the (Saudi-led) coalition under the supervision of the UN envoy to discuss his proposals on the steps and mechanisms to implement a permanent ceasefire in Yemen,&rdquo; said Malki, according to SPA.</p>

<h3 id="wuhan-lockdown-lifted-as-city-reemerges-from-coronavirus-crisis">Wuhan lockdown lifted as city reemerges from coronavirus crisis</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200407155858-wuhan-crowds-train-station-0408-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) China has ended its lockdown of Wuhan, the original epicenter of the coronavirus crisis , as the city reemerges from a deadly outbreak that is now raging across the globe.</p>
<p>But even as Wuhan reopens its borders after 76 days, some restrictions within the city will remain in place, and officials warn that the threat of further infections remains far from over.</p>
<p>The metropolis of 11 million, where the coronavirus was first detected in December, had been sealed off from the outside world since January 23 in an unprecedented effort to contain the outbreak.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, healthy residents and visitors will finally be allowed to leave Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, with trains and flights resumed and highway entrances reopened.</p>
<p>Wuhan&rsquo;s railway authority estimated more than 55,000 passengers will leave Wuhan by train Wednesday, with about 40% bound for the Pearl River Delta region, a major manufacturing hub in China, according to state broadcaster CCTV.</p>
<p>The easing of travel restrictions on Wuhan is the latest milestone in China&rsquo;s fight against Covid-19. The country reported nearly zero new local infections in recent weeks, leading to similar restrictive measures being lifted for other parts of Hubei province late last month.</p>
<p>Luo Ping, an epidemic control official in Wuhan, told CCTV Sunday that the lifting of the lockdown marks a &ldquo;full restart&rdquo; of the city&rsquo;s economic and social activities from their previous &ldquo;suspension.&rdquo; But he warned the city faces an arduous task preventing imported cases and a recurrence of local infections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After work and production resumed, the movement of people increased and so did the risk of cross-infections from mass gatherings. Some residents have dropped their guard and don&rsquo;t wear masks when they go on the streets,&rdquo; he told the broadcaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reopening of Wuhan does not mean the all-clear, neither does it mean a relaxing of epidemic prevention and control measures (within the city),&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Passengers wear facemasks as they form a queue at the Wuhan Wuchang Railway Station in Wuhan, early on April 8, as they prepare to leave the city for the first time in more than ten weeks.</p>
<p>A city brought to a halt</p>
<p>Wuhan, a sprawling industrial hub on the banks of the Yangtze River, reported more than 50,000 infections and over 2,500 deaths, accounting for 77% of all coronavirus deaths across China, according to the National Health Commission.</p>
<p>As the outbreak swept the city, much of Wuhan was brought to a halt by strict epidemic control measures &ndash; some of which would later be introduced throughout the world as the virus spread to more than 200 countries and territories, infecting more than 1.4 million people worldwide</p>
<p>For more than two months, public transport in Wuhan was suspended, businesses were shut and millions of residents were confined to their homes and residential communities &ndash; not even allowed to go outside for grocery shopping.</p>
<p>The draconian measures apparently worked. By mid-March, the number of new infections had slowed to a trickle from thousands per day at its worst in February. In a major show of confidence, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Wuhan on March 10, praising the city and its people for being &ldquo;heroic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People stand near the Yangtze River in the city of Wuhan, on April 6. In recent weeks, officials have gradually eased some of the lockdown measures, allowing a limited number of residents to leave their residential compounds for a short time.</p>
<p>A degree of normalcy amid restrictions</p>
<p>Over the past two weeks, life in Wuhan has gradually gained some semblance of normality.</p>
<p>Residents with a government-assigned green QR code on their mobile phones &ndash; meaning they&rsquo;re healthy and safe to travel &ndash; have been allowed to go back to work as long as their employers issue them a letter.</p>
<p>In residential communities where no new cases have been reported for 14 days, one person per household with a green QR code can leave the compounds two hours per day.</p>
<p>On March 25, public buses started to resume service; three days later, underground trains began running too. Businesses and shops gradually reopened, and cars and pedestrians returned to the city&rsquo;s once-deserted streets.</p>
<p>Luo, the Wuhan official, told CCTV that 10,641 large-scale factories and businesses in the city have reopened as of April 3, accounting for 91.4% of the total.</p>
<p>On Monday, there was even a long line outside the Wuhan Blood Center, following a call from the municipal government for citizens to donate their blood, the state-run People&rsquo;s Daily reported. The center received 874 donors in a day, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>But officials warned that the restrictions on residential communities will remain in place after the lockdown is lifted on Wednesday.</p>
<p>To leave their compounds, residents still need to produce a green QR code and a letter from their employer, Luo said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For now, we still call on citizens to remain vigilant on the epidemic, don&rsquo;t go out unless it&rsquo;s necessary, and wear masks and properly protect yourself when you do,&rdquo; he told CCTV.</p>
<p>A community volunteer uses her mobile phone near a barrier separating a residential compound in Wuhan on April 2.</p>
<p>Threat of a return of the virus</p>
<p>Chinese health experts have also urged the public to continue to practice caution.</p>
<p>Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told the state-run Health Times on Thursday that China had not seen the end of the epidemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;China is not near the end, but has entered a new stage. With the global epidemic raging, China has not reached the end ,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>With the number of global infections continuing to surge, a growing number of cases have been imported back to China from overseas &ndash; many of them Chinese students and workers eager to return home.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, 698 imported coronavirus cases have been reported by Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>Concerns have also been growing in recent weeks over asymptomatic carriers.</p>
<p>In China, only patients showing symptoms and positive results in nucleic tests are included in the official tally of confirmed cases. Asymptomatic patients who have tested positive are monitored and placed under quarantine until they develop symptoms or turn negative in later tests.</p>
<p>Amid mounting public concerns, China started to announce a separate daily number of asymptomatic carriers last week. Since then, dozens of new asymptomatic carriers have been found in Wuhan everyday, with 673 currently under medical observation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although for now, it seems that the infectiousness of asymptomatic cases are relatively low, they are still infectious and we should be vigilant,&rdquo; Yang Jiong, a respiratory expert at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, told the Health Times on Monday.</p>

<p>Burying the dead</p>
<p>Apart from the easing of travel restrictions, there is another sign that Wuhan is starting to move on from the crisis: It has finally started to bury the dead.</p>
<p>For months, residents in Wuhan had been unable to bury their loved ones, as the government banned all funerals and closed cemeteries on January 25. The remains of thousands of people who died both from coronavirus and other causes were stored at funeral homes. Families were told to await government advice on when they could be collected.</p>
<p>Many would not get to see the body of their loved ones before cremation. To curb the spread of the virus, all bodies of confirmed and suspected coronavirus patients were taken directly from hospitals to funeral homes for cremation, according to a notice issued by the National Health Commission.</p>
<p>Like everything else in the city, the normal process for dealing with grief was put on hold.</p>
<p>In late March, Wuhan residents were finally able to retrieve the ashes of their relatives from funeral homes and find them a resting place, reported the state-run Changjiang Daily, citing an official from the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>The news came just ahead of the Ching Ming, also known as Tomb Sweeping Day, the most important Chinese festival for honoring the dead.</p>
<p>Funeral ceremonies are still not permitted. It is not clear what rituals family members are allowed to observe when laying their loved ones to rest.
