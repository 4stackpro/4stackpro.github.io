The brutality of the journalist, which was roundly condemned by the Kenya Editors Guild (KEG) and Kenya Union of Journalist (KUJ).</p>

<p>Police brutality ushered in the coronavirus curfew for Coast and Eldoret residents as cops descended on hapless citizens two hours before the deadline.</p>
<p>Not spared were media personnel with Nation Media Group television cameraman Pater Wainaina being clobbered by a police officer, as he struggled to perform his duties.</p>
<p>The brutality on the journalist, which was roundly condemned by the Kenya Editors Guild (KEG) and Kenya Union of Journalist (KUJ), came as a shocker as the crew were recording the new measures the police and Coastguard had effected at the Likoni Channel.</p>
<p>“I was actually doing my work and the brutality meted on me by the policeman caught me surprise. I did not provoke him, and it was uncalled for,” Mr. Wainaina said.</p>
<p>Coast regional police boss Rashid Yakub apologised for the incident, terming it unfortunate and uncalled for.</p>
<p>“Please advise the journalist to record a statement at the Central Police Station in Mombasa, get an Occurrence Book (OB) number so that we can take appropriate action against this officer. We do not condone such incidents, and his actions have no place in the force,” Mr. Yakub said.</p>

<p>Churchill Otieno, the president of Kenya Editors Guild said that this wasn’t an officer of the law, but a criminal.</p>
<p>“We demand that he is immediately disarmed and prosecuted in a court of law. The public have a right to timely, accurate information hence journalists must be allowed to work,” Mr. Otieno said.</p>
<p>The KUJ Secretary General Eric Oduor said that this was another unfortunate incident which showed police’s low value for the work journalists do.</p>
<p>“This is a matter we shall revisit and report it to Independent Police Oversight Authority (Ipoa) and the Inspector General (IG) Hillary Mutyambai for action. We will go for these specific police officers caught assaulting journalists. This is a classic case where will use to settle this. We have the footage of the said officer, and we will want action taken,” Mr. Oduor said.</p>
<p>The Police officers also went on another brutality spree, beating up hundreds of ferry users who were lining up to get into the ferries at the Likoni Channel.</p>
<p>The officers who were armed with batons beat the commuters after they crowded and tried to force themselves towards the Likoni Channel.</p>
<p>The commuters complained they were getting late as the curfew time was approaching.</p>
<p>The officers hurled teargas canisters at the crowd as they mercilessly beat up the people seriously injuring them.</p>
<p>Women who were caught in the melee were left with tears after they were beaten and frogged marched by the irate officers.</p>
<p>A stampede occurred as the hundreds of the pedestrians were forced back to the line that has stretched past PCEA church and meandered within Kizingo streets.</p>
<p>During the better part of the day, police have been forcing commuters to line to allow them maintain the 1.5m social distance once they get into the ferries.</p>
<p>The measure has been announced by the government in its effort to deal with the spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Coast regional commissioner John Elungata said there will be no ferries at night.</p>
<p>Mr Elungata said that ferries will be available as from 5.30am to 6pm in the evening.</p>
<p>During peak hours, he said three ferries will be available to carry pedestrians only and the fourth vessel to ferry vehicles only.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, police officers lobbed teargas at harmless wananchi who were rushing home along Kenyatta Street in Eldoret town at around 6pm.</p>
<p>The officers were patrolling the streets asking people to go home.</p>
<p>Most of them were caught unawares as the officer threw teargas canisters unprovoked.

<h3 id="matiangi-should-resign-over-police-brutality--nelson-havi">Matiang’i should resign over police brutality — Nelson Havi</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/ureport-uploads/FILE-1585381779.jpg" alt="img">
SUMMARY “We condemn the actions of the individual police officers who have assaulted suspects. &ldquo;The Cabinet Secretary for Interior and Coordination of National Government who was declared to have contravened Article 10 of the Constitution should take personal responsibility and resign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Law Society of Kenya (LSK) president Nelson Havi has strongly condemned the brutality of police in enforcing the 7pm-5am curfew saying Interior CS Fred Matiang’i should resign.</p>
<p>Through a statement, Havi stated that the CS should take responsibility having contravened Article 10 of the Constitution.</p>
<p>The LSK president argued that the penalty for not adhering to a curfew is a fine of nor more than Sh1000 or imprisonment for not more than three months.</p>
<p>“We condemn the actions of the individual police officers who have assaulted suspects. The Cabinet Secretary for Interior and Coordination of National Government who was declared to have contravened Article 10 of the Constitution should take personal responsibility and resign.</p>
<p>“The penalty for contravening a curfew is a fine of not more than Ksh 1,000 or imprisonment for not more than 3 months, or to both,” he said.</p>
<p>Adding: “The National Police Service has no right or justification whatsoever substituting the penalty with corporal punishment. Their action amounts to aggravated assault.”</p>
<p>On Friday, several videos of police assaulting Kenyans who failed to comply with President Uhuru Kenyatta’s directive were shared online.</p>
<p>In Mombasa, police used batons and whips on innocent Kenyans way before the curfew started and Havi has now asked all Kenyans who underwent any form of brutality to document their incidences and forward them to LSK.</p>
<p>See Also: Kenyans heap praises on cop who enforced the curfew without using a rod</p>
<p>“Members of the public are requested to document all incidences of aggravated assault by the police and forward the same to the Law Society of Kenya.</p>

<p>“We will take action against the said officers and or their superiors in charge of the commands where the offenses are being committed,” he said.</p>
<p>Further, LSK will move to court on Monday to challenge the curfew, which it terms as unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The body argued that the recent occurrences will only spread COVID-19 in the name of instilling terror on those who have contravened the curfew.</p>

<h3 id="govt-urged-to-deal-with-police-brutality-during-curfew---kbc">Gov&rsquo;t urged to deal with police brutality during curfew - KBC</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.kbc.co.ke/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AUKOT.jpg" alt="img">
Thirdway Alliance Kenya party leader Dr. Ekuru Aukot has called on the government to urgently take action against police officers involved in police brutality against Kenyans during this time of curfew.</p>
<p>Dr. Aukot said officers seen in photos and videos beating and brutalising people prior to the start of the curfew hour should be identified and prosecuted.</p>
<p>In a statement to newsrooms, Dr. Aukot said through their brutal and violent action, the police are spreading the virus that Kenyans are trying to control.</p>
<p>He said it is inhuman for the law enforcement officers to unleash violence on already suffering Kenyans in an attempt to reduce the spread of Coronavirus.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Amani National Congress (ANC) party leader Musalia Mudavadi has condemned the brutality meted on members of the public by police officers enforcing the order since the curfew took effect.</p>
<p>He said there is a gap between policy formulation and policy implementation. Mudavadi said curfew should only be used in cases where the government is dealing with a hostile environment in a sudden and disruptive situation.</p>
<p>The government imposed the curfew in new guidelines aimed at combating the spread of the novel Coronavirus which has so far claimed a 66-year-old patient in Kenya.</p>
<p>Several human rights groups have also condemned the use of excessive and unnecessary force by the police since the country imposed the curfew Friday.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Youth Congress has also strongly condemned the use of brutal force by the police.</p>
<p>Raphael Obonyo the Convener says the gruesome and painful manner in which citizens are being treated is frustrating, overwhelming and hurtful and a gross human rights violation that undermines human dignity and the very objective of the curfew which is to ensure national security and public health.</p>
<p>“There is no possible justification for this kind of treatment. Reports of police abuse should be promptly investigated and those responsible should be appropriately disciplined or prosecuted. Police should respect the rights of those they arrest for violating curfew and other public health regulations to combat COVID-19. Moments of a crisis like this require that authorities and citizens work together and fight the common enemy and not each other.” He said.</p>
<p>Adding that: “Most important and as we fight the pandemic, we must stand united against all forms of human rights violations. “We begin to die the day we remain silent about things that matter”
