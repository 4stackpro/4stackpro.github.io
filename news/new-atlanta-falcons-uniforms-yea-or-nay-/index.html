The Atlanta Falcons were scheduled to release their new uniforms next week, but a Tuesday night Twitter leak pushed that date up a few days. So the team turned their new red, black and white creations loose on the world.</p>
<p>Your thoughts?</p>
<p>Nobody ever likes new uniforms; everybody wants some version of the old uniform back, which they probably hated at the time it was new.</p>

<p>The primary change is a large ATL on the front of the jerseys. Since the logo is a key part of the Mercedes-Benz Stadium seating design, that wasn’t changing, nor were the colors themselves. But the fonts of the numbers are different, and the pairing of jersey and pants — all white for away games, all black for home — is new as well.</p>
<p>The helmets are matte black, with a larger logo:</p>

<p>“As you know, part of our promise as an organization is to listen and respond,” Falcons owner Arthur Blank wrote in announcing the new uniforms. “Time and again, we’ve heard you ask for new uniforms over the years, and in the spirit of our core values, we’ve listened to you and responded with what I know will be an exciting new era of Falcons football.”</p>
<p>Naturally, the Falcons’ rivals leaped right onto the pile-on bandwagon:</p>
<p>The Falcons fired back with a solid Cam Newton-based reply:</p>

<h3 id="atlanta-falcons-to-unveil-new-uniforms-on-april-14-which-might-have-leaked-early">Atlanta Falcons To Unveil New Uniforms On April 14, Which Might Have Leaked Early</h3>
<p><img src="http://content.sportslogos.net/news/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-07-at-5.31.35-PM-200x200.png" alt="img">
Atlanta Falcons To Unveil New Uniforms On April 14, Which Might Have Leaked Early</p>
<p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers aren’t the only NFC South team unveiling new uniforms this month, as the Atlanta Falcons announced on Tuesday evening they’ll follow suit on April 14.</p>
<p>For the first time in 17 years, it&rsquo;s time for a change. pic.twitter.com/G892ZHuPNX — Atlanta Falcons (@AtlantaFalcons) April 7, 2020</p>
<p>“It’s the first time in 17 years that we’re changing them, which is remarkable to me because I didn’t realize it was quite that long,” owner and CEO Arthur Blank said in an interview with team reporter Matthew Tabeek. “I think it is a look that fans will feel, experience, see and hopefully wear and is one that’s more in keeping with a contemporary look and feel that our fans are looking for. A little more flair.”</p>
<p>Atlanta’s last significant uniform update came ahead of the 2003 season, when the Falcons introduced a new logo and all-black uniforms that featured a unique sleeve design and piping down the side of the jersey and pants. That look has remained intact in the seasons since, though team promoted its red alternate jersey with white pants to the primary set just one year later.</p>
<p>Atlanta has been working closely with the NFL, Nike and Falcons players to create the new look, which may have also leaked in the replies to the tweet announcing the unveiling date. The photos appear to be from the dressing room of an official team photoshoot, and included three new uniforms (black, red and white), as well as the Falcons’ 1966 throwback jersey.</p>
<p>The number font on the potential leaks pull inspiration from the updated wordmark that was at the top of the letter Blank sent to season ticket holders in January announcing the looming changes and includes a contrasting side shadow.</p>
<p>Every jersey features a new side panel design, but the red jersey is the most notable because the body features a red-to-black gradient effect that transitions into black pants, reminiscent of the uniforms the NBA’s Atlanta Hawks wore from 1995-99 and Texas Tech’s 2014 alternate football uniform.</p>
<p>A matte black helmet sitting on the table in the studio, meanwhile, shows an oversized logo on the side and a gray facemask — something Atlanta hasn’t worn since the 1983 season, when the team still donned red helmets.</p>
<p>“I think the level combinations is one of the things that struck me about the tops and bottoms, the way they could be combined and put together provides a lot of options,” Blank said in the aforementioned interview. “The players had a lot of input in the uniforms. You know, they have to wear them. Beyond that, they’re young and they’re hip and they get it. They want to wear something that looks good on them. I think the uniforms will good on them and even better on our fans.”</p>

<h3 id="georgia-great-todd-gurley-going-to-look-fresh-in-new-atlanta-falcons-uniforms">Georgia great Todd Gurley going to look fresh in new Atlanta Falcons’ uniforms</h3>

It’s been 17 years since the Atlanta Falcons made a significant uniform change. On Wednesday, the team released their new Nike-designed uniforms.</p>
<p>The new look will feature an all black ensemble for home games with white jerseys and white pants on the road. The helmet retains the familiar logo but will change to a matte finish. Several of the uniforms will showcase ‘ATL’ on the front of the jersey.</p>
<p>There will be eight different color combinations, including the current 1966 throwback version, and a new “Rise Up” alternate uniform.</p>
<p>For our team.</p>
<p>Our fans.</p>

<p>The Falcons finished 7-9 last season. During the off-season, Atlanta signed former Georgia running back and past NFL Offensive Player of the Year Todd Gurley to a one-year contract. In addition, the team traded for former South Carolina tight end Hayden Hurst. On offense, the team should be well-stacked with Matt Ryan at quarterback, Alabama alums Julio Jones and Calvin Ridley at wide receiver and five former first rounders on the offensive line. The Falcons currently have five draft picks in the upcoming draft, including the No. 16 pick in round one.
