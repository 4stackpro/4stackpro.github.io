<p>(CNN) On Sunday, Queen Elizabeth gave a rare address, broadcast on the BBC, in light of the coronavirus pandemic. The British monarch drew on what she called the &ldquo;fellow feeling&rdquo; which an empathetic approach to dealing with a common struggle can foster. She praised &ldquo;heartwarming&rdquo; stories of care from around the world, and expressed a hope that &ldquo;in the years to come, everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holly Thomas</p>
<p>Her words marked a rare contrast to the nation-focused battle-talk which has characterized the much of the response to the pandemic so far. Though she as a figurehead has the luxury of expressing support rather than addressing practical enforcement or policy, by promoting a spirit of compassion, the Queen also sidestepped the problematic habit of many world leaders who have relied on &ndash; and sometimes abused &ndash; war-like language.</p>
<p>Just hours before the Queen&rsquo;s address, for instance, the US Surgeon General warned that the upcoming phase of the coronavirus pandemic in America was going to be its &ldquo;hardest and saddest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is going to be our 9/11 moment, our Pearl Harbor moment,&rdquo; Vice Admiral Jerome Adams said in an interview on Fox News.</p>
<p>Adams&rsquo; invocation of Pearl Harbor followed a trend set by so many world leaders during the Covid-19 pandemic. President Donald Trump has referred to himself as a &ldquo;wartime president,&rdquo; promising &ldquo;total victory&rdquo; against the &ldquo;invisible enemy.&rdquo; French President Emmanuel Macron told his country &ldquo;we are at war,&rdquo; as he announced the closure of its borders. In mid-March, attempting to persuade the British public of the seriousness of the coronavirus&rsquo; threat, Prime Minister Boris Johnson &ndash; himself now in intensive care in stable condition battling the disease &ndash; said it was necessary to act like a &ldquo;wartime government,&rdquo; in order &ldquo;win the fight&rdquo; against a &ldquo;deadly enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Prince Charles will appear on a podcast to go out in lieu of Easter Sunday’s celebrations as his mother posted the Maundy money because the traditional service was cancelled due to coronavirus.</p>
<p>Charles was announced as one of the readers on the Westminster Abbey Easter Sunday podcast.</p>
<p>The heir to the throne will read one of the gospel passages on the podcast which will be released on 12 April, as churches adapt to new ways to meet with buildings closed.</p>
<p>The prince will read John 20: 1-18, which recounts Mary Magdalene finding Jesus’ tomb empty on the morning he had risen.</p>
<p>Charles recorded the reading at Birkhall in Scotland earlier this week, Westminster Abbey said, and will be included alongside an address, anthems and prayers.</p>

<p>The Dean of Westminster, the Very Reverend Dr David Hoyle said: “Whilst the Abbey is closed, in the precincts, the life of prayer for the community of priests and lay people who live here continues. In Holy Week, we enter more and more deeply into God’s radical commitment to our shared humanity in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>“We reflect each day on suffering, on death and on our hope. We pray for those around us for whom those things are a very vivid reality in this national crisis. We are immensely encouraged that His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales joins us as we greet the Risen Christ who shines as light in this darkness.”</p>
<p>It comes as the Queen had to post the Maundy money this year to the 188 recipients, because of the closure of churches to tackle the spread of coronavirus.</p>

<p>Every year Her Majesty carries out the tradition of distributing money to people to recognise their contributions to their communities and churches.</p>
<p>The special coins, which are legal tender but not in circulation, are usually given out at the Maundy Thursday service, which this year she was due to attend in St George’s Chapel in Windsor.</p>
<p>It forms the first part of her duties during Easter Court, but as all church buildings are closed to stop the spread of coronavirus, this year’s service was cancelled.</p>
<p>Each year, the number of coins and the number of recipients matches her age. She will turn 94 on 21 April and has given the gift to 94 men and 94 women.</p>

<p>In a letter to recipients, she said: “This ancient Christian ceremony, which reflects Jesus’s instruction to his disciples to love one another, is a call to the service of others, something that has been at the centre of my life. I believe it is a call to service for all of us.</p>
<p>“It is one of my most rewarding duties as Sovereign to observe this highly significant ceremony at such an important point in the Christian calendar.</p>
<p>“I know that you, as a Recipient of this year’s Maundy Gift, will be as deeply disappointed as I am that it is not going ahead, while understanding the necessary decision in the current circumstances.”</p>
<p>She said she did not want the circumstances to prevent them receiving the gift, and that they and their families were in her thoughts.</p>

<h3 id="the-symbolic-significance-of-the-queens-turquoise-brooch-from-her-televised-address">The Symbolic Significance of the Queen’s Turquoise Brooch From Her Televised Address</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5e8e3ea4ac720b00089fd06d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/queen-elizabeth-brooch-lede.png" alt="img">
It’s fairly unusual for Queen Elizabeth to wear turquoise jewelry, so when she sat for a national address Sunday evening—only her fourth during her 68-year reign—her diamond and turquoise brooch was yet more evidence that she is living through an usual time. The gem’s blue tone stood out against her emerald green crepe dress, its diamond-encrusted filigrees gently catching the light in the queen’s Windsor Castle sitting room.</p>
<p>The brooch itself is one she’s only seldom worn since inheriting it in 1953; she didn’t wear it at all in public until 2014, when she wore it on a visit to Derbyshire. It came into her possession along with much more jewelry that her paternal grandmother, Queen Mary, passed on to her when she died at the age of 85. The Queen Mary jewels are nearly only spotted on special occasions. Mary gave the queen the tiara she wore for her wedding, and the diamond jubilee necklace she’s worn to processions through the years. The tiara that Meghan Markle wore when she married Prince Harry also came from Mary’s collection. Though she’s provided the emblems for the family’s happiest moments, Mary’s reign also coincided with some of the most difficult events in world history—including a pandemic flu that may be the closest historical comparison to what we are now living through.</p>

<p>Mary, the queen consort to King George V, whose reign stretched from 1910 to 1936, was an avid collector of jewels, art, and decorative objects, a habit she picked up from her parents, the British princess Mary Adelaide and the German Duke of Teck. When Mary married George in 1893, her parents gave her some of their jewels, including a turquoise and diamond tiara and parure that had been commissioned by her mother in the 1850s. The brooch the queen wore on Sunday is one of a pair given to Mary as a wedding present by her father- and mother-in-law, the Prince and Princess of Wales, who would later become King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra. Mary was photographed wearing it later in life, and when she died in 1953, the Teck tiara and parure were given to her son Prince Henry, the queen’s second cousin, and his wife, the Duchess of Gloucester. The duchess wore the tiara to formal events before her death in 2004 at the age of 102, and it was later seen on her daughter-in-law, Birgitte. The brooches, however, remained with the queen.</p>
<p>When dressing and selecting jewelry for a moment like this, the queen and her dresser, Angela Kelly, often think about the history of the pieces she wears and the symbolism of the colors they select. Turquoise has long been considered a color of healing and peace. But this piece’s connection to Queen Mary might hint at an even deeper message from the Queen about the current pandemic. In 1892, Mary had been engaged to marry George’s older brother, the Duke of Clarence, when he fell ill with the flu and died at Sandringham. Mary and George later wed at the suggestion of Queen Victoria, but soon grew to be genuinely close.
