Alec Baldwin’s wife pregnant again</p>
<p>Hilaria Baldwin is pregnant again. The 36-year-old yoga instructor announced Monday that she and her husband, actor Alec Baldwin, are expecting their fifth child together.</p>
<p>“Just got the great news that all is well and all is healthy with this little munchkin,” she said in a video playing the baby’s heartbeat. “Here we go again.”</p>
<p>Hilaria Baldwin has four children with Alec — Carmen, 6, Rafael, 4, Leonardo, 3, and Romeo, 1 — and has previously suffered two miscarriages. Alec Baldwin, the Emmy-winning actor and son of CNY’s Carol M. Baldwin, also has a daughter, 24-year-old model Ireland Baldwin, with his ex-wife Kim Basinger.</p>
<p>Coronavirus inspires new ‘The Office’-type comedy</p>
<p>ET reports “The Office” producers Ben Silverman and Paul Lieberstein (a.k.a. Toby) are working on a new workplace comedy series inspired by the coronavirus pandemic. The show will feature office workers talking over Zoom and other methods of communication while staying home, with a “wunderkind boss who, in an effort to ensure his staff’s connectedness and productivity, asks them all to virtually interact and work face-to-face all day.”</p>
<p>There’s no word yet on a cast, but Ryan (B.J. Novak) called himself a “wunderkind” when he was briefly a corporate boss at Dunder Mifflin — could it be a TV spinoff?</p>
<p>“With the brilliant Paul Lieberstein at the helm, we think we have a series that not only brings humor and comfort during this troubling time but will also be an inventive and enduring workplace comedy for years to come,&rdquo; Silverman said in a statement.</p>

<h3 id="alec-baldwin-joins-aussie-actors-in-live-streamed-reading">Alec Baldwin joins Aussie actors in live streamed reading</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.limelightmagazine.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/8c01d4d9-orphans-joanmarcus3.jpg" alt="img">
On Sunday, Golden Globe-winning actor Alec Baldwin will make his Australian theatre debut, albeit virtually. Baldwin, and Australian actors Andrew Henry and Aaron Glenane will perform together in a world-wide live streamed reading of Lyle Kessler’s 1983 black comedy Orphans.</p>
<p>“It is just one of those things that you don’t know if you don’t ask. The whole industry can be about set-backs at a lot of moments, but this is just one where we were a bit fearless, we asked the question and it paid off for us,” says Henry, who came up with the idea of approaching Baldwin.</p>

<p>The renowned American actor, who played the role of Harold in Orphans on Broadway in 2013, accepted with alacrity. “I love this play and I am excited to, finally, be playing Australia!” he said.</p>
<p>Baldwin’s numerous credits include the 1992 Broadway production of A Streetcar Named Desire, for which he received a Tony nomination, and films such as Beetlejuice, Glengarry Glen Ross, The Aviator, Blue Jasmine, Still Alice, Mission Impossible: Fallout and The Cooler for which he received an Oscar nomination.</p>
<p>Presented by Red Line Productions – the independent company which runs Sydney’s 60-seat Old Fitz Theatre in Woolloomooloo – the play reading will also include lifetime member of the Actors Studio Judy Jerome, who will read out the stage directions and descriptions.</p>
<p>All four performers will be connected from their homes around the globe by Canvas Collective, a streaming production house in Sydney, which will broadcast the reading via the Red Line Productions Facebook page and via YouTube.</p>
<p>Orphans tells the story of two grown-up orphan brothers who live in a grim house in North Philadelphia. Violent older brother Treat (Henry) is a petty thief who goes out each day, robbing people to provide the means for he and his brother Phillip (Glenane) to survive. One day, he returns home with a well-dressed man from Chicago with a suitcase full of money. Harold (Baldwin) is not the businessman they imagine him to be, but over time he becomes the surrogate father that the boys have always longed for.</p>
<p>Asked how the reading came about, Henry, the Artistic Director of Red Line Productions, says: “When you are cooped up in a house you come up with some wild ideas, really! The short version is that like every other theatre on planet Earth we were hit hard with [COVID-19]. Rushing to try and put on a show at the Fitz, and what we would consider our normal tasks, don’t really exist at the moment and we also aren’t set up to be able to create huge online content. So, basically, I reached out to the writer and asked him how he’d feel if we did a reading of Orphans, if Alec would play Harold.”</p>
<p>“I wanted a good news story, and at the moment it doesn’t matter who you are in the world, you are affected by this [pandemic] so we went, well, Alec played the role in 2013, [Aaron and I] did it at the Old Fitz in 2015, so maybe there’s a way that our mutual love of this play about being basically trapped in a house could be a way that we could connect.”</p>

<p>The play’s writer Lyle Kessler talked to Baldwin who not only agreed to take part in the reading but suggested that they live stream it to the US, Canada and the UK as well as Australia.</p>
<p>“I knew that he had the same love of the play as I did,” adds Henry. “I said to him this is what has happened to our theatre company, which is not a unique story, but this our way of offering something for us to throw our hat in the ring to get through.”</p>
<p>As Henry points out, actors and theatre companies do play readings all the time. And that is exactly what they will present here. “It’s not a performance. That being said, we have all done the play and being live it will have the immediacy of the theatre, and we have got a great [streaming] company that will connect us all,” says Henry.</p>
<p>“They are going to be doing some live fixing of it so when it is just two actors in a scene it will show them on the screen, and then when the other actor enters it will show the three of them, and there will be a bit of intercutting between our living rooms.”</p>
<p>The 90-minute live stream will take place in Australia on Sunday April 12, at 11am Sydney time. At the same time, it will screen in New York (April 11 at 9pm), Los Angeles (April 11 at 6pm), Montreal and Toronto (April 11 at 9pm), and London (April 12 at 2pm). Other countries and regions will need to convert to their local time.</p>
<p>The screening is free, though there is an option to buy a ticket – at a wide range of prices – as a way to help support the survival of Red Line Productions. “We’ve had more people book tickets to this show than would be a whole season of people in our little 60-seat theatre already, which is lovely,” says Henry.</p>
<p>“This is not going to make a fortune. [Tickets] are only there if people have the means because it is free and everyone is struggling at the moment, but that’s the commerce that we are in. If you can pay, great; if you can’t, then don’t stress. If people don’t [have the means], they shouldn’t think twice and just tune in anyway as Orphans is a visceral and wild story that we are so excited to share.”</p>
