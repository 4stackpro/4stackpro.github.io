UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaks and takes questions during a press conference in Downing Street regarding the coronavirus outbreak, on March 9, 2020. in London, England.</p>
<p>U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has spent a second night in an intensive care unit in hospital, but his condition is stable, according to officials.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Prime Minister&rsquo;s condition is stable and he remains in intensive care for close monitoring. He is in good spirits,&rdquo; Downing Street said in a statement Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>Johnson was admitted to the unit in St. Thomas&rsquo; Hospital, London, on Monday evening after his coronavirus symptoms worsened.</p>
<p>It was announced on March 27 that Johnson had tested positive for the coronavirus, but he wasn&rsquo;t admitted to hospital until Sunday for &ldquo;tests&rdquo; due to persistent symptoms of the virus, including a cough and fever.</p>
<p>Speaking at the government&rsquo;s daily press conference Tuesday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is deputizing for Johnson, said the prime minister had been &ldquo;receiving standard oxygen treatment and breathing without any assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not required any mechanical ventilation or noninvasive respiratory support. He remains in good spirits and in keeping with clinical practice his progress continues to be monitored closely in critical care,&rdquo; Raab said.</p>
<p>The U.K. reported its largest daily rise in deaths so far on Tuesday, with 786 fatalities reported, taking the overall death toll to 6,159 people. The sharp rise in deaths (up from 439 reported Monday) has been partly attributed to a lag in data collection from the weekend, Sky News reported. To date, 55,242 people in the U.K. have tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>Officials said there are tentative signs that the spread of the virus is slowing. The government&rsquo;s Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance said Tuesday that it was &ldquo;possible that we&rsquo;re beginning to see&hellip; the curve flattening.&rdquo; He said it would be another &ldquo;week or so&rdquo; before there could be any certainty of that, however.</p>
<p>Johnson was the first world leader to contract the coronavirus and his admission to intensive care has shocked many. On Tuesday, he was sent best wishes from leaders in Europe, and President Trump, who called him a &ldquo;very good friend.&rdquo;

<p>The prime minister has spent a second night in intensive care with coronavirus. According to the latest update on Tuesday evening, he was &ldquo;stable&rdquo; and &ldquo;in good spirits&rdquo;, but being closely monitored. Here we show you what goes on inside an intensive care unit, and hear from one survivor what a bad case of the disease can feel like.</p>
<p>Downing Street has confirmed that given Boris Johnson&rsquo;s illness, the review into the UK&rsquo;s coronavirus restrictions planned for next Monday will now take place at a later date. The curbs on personal freedom, the economy and more were initially imposed for three weeks. The government&rsquo;s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said on Tuesday the UK &ldquo;could be moving in the right direction&rdquo;, but it would be another &ldquo;week or so&rdquo; before he could be sure.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the first patients have been admitted to the new Nightingale Hospital in east London - although an NHS spokesperson stressed limits had not been reached at other sites in London. See how the 4,000-bed facility was built in just nine days. The NHS is also setting up a hotline to offer psychological support and other advice to healthcare staff. And cat owners are being told to keep their pets indoors during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The number of coronavirus hospital deaths in the UK rose to 6,159 on Tuesday, but a reminder for you of why we need to be cautious with those day-to-day numbers.</p>
<p>Around the world</p>
<p>The Chinese city of Wuhan - where coronavirus first emerged - has finally been released from lockdown. Train, road and rail connections have been re-established, and limits on economic activity and individual movement have been eased. Ordinary residents of Wuhan have been offering advice to others now going through what they have endured. But China&rsquo;s claims of success in the fight against coronavirus have raised eyebrows - here&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>In the US, Tuesday brought the highest daily death toll so far, with a jump of 1,736. The nation&rsquo;s total now stands at more than 12,000. The family of singer-songwriter John Prine - known for songs such as Angel from Montgomery and Sam Stone - has confirmed his death from the disease. New York remains the epicentre of the US outbreak, but the state&rsquo;s governor says it appears to be nearing the peak. Twitter founder Jack Dorsey has pledged $1bn to help deal with the pandemic.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the world, EU member states are arguing over how to tackle the economic fallout - southern nations like Italy and Spain think those further north, especially Germany and the Netherlands, are not doing enough. France, meanwhile, has tightened its social distancing rules as the death toll passed 10,000.</p>

<p>Festivals and furlough</p>
<p>Coronavirus is changing so much of our everyday lives. Social distancing is turning centuries-old religious festivals into virtual experiences. It has also made teachers out of the nation&rsquo;s parents, as children have been forced to stay away from the classroom. Our education reporter Hannah Richardson looks at whether we should be lowering our expectations of home-schooling. Finally, the pandemic has left many workers in a new world - furlough. Hear from some of those in that position who are feeling everything from guilt to gratitude.</p>
<p>Have Brits stranded abroad got home yet?</p>
<p>By Cherry Wilson, BBC News</p>
<p>So far, about 2,000 British nationals from seven countries have been brought back on flights organised by the Foreign Office. It&rsquo;s not free though - passengers have to pay for a seat, which has cost people up to £1,000. Luke Wallwork and his girlfriend Chiara paid about £250 each to get back from Peru. The 23-year-old, from Liverpool, believes it was down to the pressure UK tourists put on the government that finally made them take more action. &ldquo;The response we got in the first week was that you&rsquo;re kind of on your own,&rdquo; he says.</p>

<p>What the papers say</p>
<p>Fears of a power vacuum at the top of government feature prominently on the front pages. The Daily Telegraph says the prime minister&rsquo;s de facto deputy, Dominic Raab, is facing a situation &ldquo;without recent historical precedent&rdquo;. Cabinet sources tell the paper senior ministers also have &ldquo;differing views&rdquo; on whether to extend the current lockdown. The Sun quotes another unnamed government figure who suggests Mr Raab is &ldquo;heavily constrained&rdquo; as the prime minister&rsquo;s stand-in and needs &ldquo;collective responsibility on anything substantial&rdquo;. For the Guardian, the UK is facing a &ldquo;crisis of authority&rdquo; just as it grapples with &ldquo;some of the most fraught political calls any peacetime government has had to make&rdquo;. Meanwhile, according to the Times, British biotech companies could soon be asked to work together to produce a finger-prick antibody test that could provide a possible route out of the lockdown.</p>

<h3 id="boris-johnson-moved-to-intensive-care-foreign-minister-deputized">Boris Johnson Moved to Intensive Care; Foreign Minister Deputized</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/06/world/06virus-britain/06virus-britain-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
LONDON — Prime Minister Boris Johnson was moved into intensive care on Monday, a worrisome turn in his 10-day battle with the coronavirus and the starkest evidence yet of how the virus has threatened the British political establishment and thrown its new government into upheaval.</p>
<p>The government said the decision was a precaution and that he had been in good spirits earlier in the day. But with Mr. Johnson’s aides releasing few details about his condition, the nation kept a tense vigil on Monday night, hoping for the best and experiencing, together, the frightening mysteries of this disease.</p>
<p>In a sign of how grave the situation had become, Downing Street said in a statement on Monday that Mr. Johnson had asked the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, to deputize for him “where necessary.” The pound fell against the dollar after investors reacted to the news.</p>
<p>After noting earlier in the day that the prime minister was still getting official papers, Mr. Johnson’s aides said he had been moved to the intensive care unit in case he needed a ventilator to help his recovery. Not every patient in critical care is ventilated, medical experts said, but many are — or are at least given oxygen. The prime minister remains conscious, officials said.
