Image caption Senator John Le Fondre said everyone had the power to reduce the spread of the virus by simply staying at home</p>
<p>Jersey residents will go into lockdown on Monday morning as island health authorities try to curb coronavirus.</p>
<p>From 08:00 BST, only essential workers will be allowed to leave home for more than two hours a day.</p>
<p>Restrictions were previously put in place for those with underlying health conditions and for the over 65s.</p>
<p>Chief Minister John Le Fondre said: &ldquo;This is not advice. This is an instruction, which will be backed by powers of enforcement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;We cannot stop the virus, so we must manage its impact over the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those who do not follow these restrictions will be putting these people at risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jersey&rsquo;s coronavirus restrictions:</p>
<p>Leave your home only to shop for basic necessities, but as infrequently as possible, daily exercise and for medical reasons advised by a healthcare worker</p>
<p>When you do need to leave your home it should be for no more than two hours a day</p>
<p>All non-essential shops to be closed - a list of exceptions will be published on gov.je</p>
<p>Public gatherings of more than two people, other than from the same household, will be banned</p>
<p>Only family members from the same household should exercise and play together</p>
<p>Parents and guardians should only take their children food shopping if there is absolutely no option to leave them at home</p>
<p>You must not have visitors, such as friends and family, in your home</p>
<p>The majority of schools will remain closed until further guidance is issued to parents</p>
<p>Those schools that have remained open to care for the children of critical workers will remain open</p>
<p>Funerals should only be attended by the immediate family, and people from different households must observe social distancing</p>
<p>Senator Le Fondre urged those with children and young people to ensure they followed the restrictions.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;There is evidence that young people are super-spreaders. If they are not staying home, they are putting the lives of their older relatives at risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The measures are expected to be in place through to the end of April.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the number of positive tests is still relatively low, Dr [Ivan] Muscat (Jersey&rsquo;s deputy medical officer for health) has advised the government that now is the right time to impose further restrictions on our community,&rdquo; said Minister for Health Richard Renouf.</p>
<p>He said the advice followed &ldquo;significant delays&rdquo; in receiving test results from the UK and confirmed the island was working on introducing its own testing.</p>
<p>Second death</p>
<p>Deputy Renouf said: &ldquo;Without timely results showing us what social distancing is doing to the spread of the infection, there is a risk that the measures are not working as well as they could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Earlier, Health and Community Services announced the second death in Jersey relating to coronavirus.</p>
<p>It involved a patient aged in their 70s who had &ldquo;significant underlying long-term health conditions&rdquo; and had been under their care for &ldquo;some time&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While they were being treated, the patient contracted Covid-19 and subsequently died,&rdquo; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>At 16:00 BST, there were 61 other positive diagnoses of the virus in the island after more than 700 tests were completed, with 101 awaiting results.

<p><img src="https://news.images.itv.com/image/file/2169212/img.jpg" alt="img">
More roles have been added to Jersey&rsquo;s critical workers list, which means their children can go to a nursery, school or a childminder.</p>
<p>It allows parents to continue their essential work without having to worry about childcare.</p>
<p>Schools in Jersey have closed to reduce the spread of coronavirus, and are only open, along with a small number of nurseries and childminders, to look after the children of critical workers.</p>
<p>Initially, only Government services had access to the limited number of school and nursery places offered for critical workers.</p>
<p>Now a number of other roles have been added they include people who work in:
