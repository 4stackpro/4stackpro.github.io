Emergency responders in Georgia responded to a busy road to remove an alligator spotted sunning itself in the middle of traffic. Photo courtesy of the Bibb County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office</p>
<p>April 13 (UPI) &ndash; Emergency responders in Georgia teamed up to relocate a large alligator that decided to block traffic by taking in the sun in the middle of a busy road.</p>
<p>The Bibb County Sheriff&rsquo;s Office said officers from its animal enforcement unit worked together with deputies and Macon-Bibb firefighters when the gator was reported sunning itself Saturday in the middle of Joe Tamplin Industrial Boulevard in Macon.</p>
<p>The sheriff&rsquo;s office shared video showing the responders lifting the alligator out of the road.</p>
<p>The traffic hazard alligator was safely relocated to Bond Swamp, the sheriff&rsquo;s office said.

<h3 id="gator-mating-season-is-here-this-is-what-you-need-to-know">Gator mating season is here. This is what you need to know</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.wtsp.com/assets/WTSP/images/b8c576b9-3137-4c9e-b3db-b340c77ed138/b8c576b9-3137-4c9e-b3db-b340c77ed138_1140x641.jpg" alt="img">
TAMPA, Fla. â€” Social distancing walks are one of the few things you can leave your house to do during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great way to get out of your house and get some exercise.</p>
<p>But, if you&rsquo;re taking a walk here in Florida, you&rsquo;re going to want to start paying attention. Alligator mating season is upon us.</p>
<p>Alligators are more aggressive during their mating season. During mating season in June 2018, a 12 and a-half-foot gator pulled a woman into a Florida pond and killed her.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, deadly alligator attacks on humans remain rare. According to Florida Fish and Wildlife, the likelihood of a Florida resident being seriously injured during an unprovoked alligator incident in Florida is roughly only 1 in 3.2 million.</p>
<p>According to Florida Fish and Wildlife, courtship between two gators begins in early April.</p>
<p>Mating will then occur in May or June. Around late June or early July, the female gator will begin to deposit on average 32 to 46 eggs in her nest. Those nests are built out of soil, vegetation, or debris.</p>
<p>Incubation for the eggs requires approximately 63-68 days, and hatching occurs from mid-August through early September.</p>
<p>FWC says that alligators become sexually mature by the time they reach seven feet in length; however, females can reach maturity at just 6 feet long.</p>
<p>A female could take from 10 to 15 years to mature. A male could take eight to 12 years.</p>
<p>So what should you do if you come across an alligator on your walk?</p>
<p>The FWC says people should never feed alligators and to keep their distance if they see one. People can also stay safe by only swimming in designated swimming areas and keeping pets away from the water and on a leash at all times when they&rsquo;re out.</p>
<p>You can read more about living with alligators on FWC&rsquo;s website.</p>

<h3 id="alligators-millions-b-sample-positive">Alligator&rsquo;s Millions B sample positive</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-975599/8a0976f3b0ed17969b33b64319d765a98350354d-16x9-x0y75w800h450.jpg?imwidth=1024" alt="img">
A second sample has confirmed the prohibited substance altrenogest in the swab taken from Alligator Blood after he won the Magic Millions 3YO Guineas at the Gold Coast.</p>
<p>Trainer David Vandyke will now face a stewards&rsquo; inquiry at a date to be set.</p>
<p>If he is found guilty of presenting horse to race with a prohibited substance it is likely he would face a fine but Alligator Blood would be disqualified from first place in the January 11 race and the $1.1 million first prize would be forfeited.</p>
<p>Alligator Blood has since won two races in Melbourne including the Group One Australian Guineas.</p>
<p>The swabs from those races have been cleared clear and prize money has been paid.</p>
<p>Vandyke says he has been informed the B sample taken from Alligator Blood had come back positive and he now faced an inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This presents a challenging time. Since moving to Queensland in May 2016 this is the first irregularity that I have had in this state,&rdquo; Vandyke said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my hope that the inquiry will shed light on how altrenogest entered Alligator Blood&rsquo;s system and help prevent any similar incident occurring in racing again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Queensland Racing Integrity Commission sent the B sample from the Magic Millions for testing after an analysis of the A sample last month showed an irregularity to altrenogest which is illegal in male horses.</p>
<p>Commonly marketed as Regumate, altrenogest is used in mares to regulate their cycles but is among substances prohibited on race day.</p>
<p>The irregularity was confirmed on Tuesday by an interstate laboratory.</p>
<p>Stewards have offered Vandyke the opportunity to give his submissions in writing or at a steward&rsquo;s inquiry to be held via telephone or video conference because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>While race-day Inquiries are being held on race day at the track observing social distancing, non-race-day steward&rsquo;s inquiries are being held remotely.
