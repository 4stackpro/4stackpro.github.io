<p>In Photos: From Maanav in Pavitra Rishta to Annirudh in Chhichhore, roles that defined Sushant Singh Rajput 1 12 Tracing Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s life in films Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s tryst with the camera began with a chance sighting. Ekta Kapoor&rsquo;s casting team spotted him in a play by Nadira Babbar&rsquo;s theatre company and invited him to audition for a show. It set the ball rolling on the then-aspiring hero&rsquo;s career. A look: Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil (2008) Sushant made his television debut as Preet Juneja on this show. The character was killed early on, but was brought back as a spirit for the series finale, owing to his popularity. Pavitra Rishta (2009) The next year, he landed the lead role of Manav Deshmukh in the hit show, widely considered to be his breakout role and a stepping stone to films. While working on this Ekta Kapoor production, he also met his future girlfriend, Ankita Lokhande, who played the female lead. Kai Po Che! (2013) After participating in two dance-based reality shows— Zara Nachke Dikha 2 and Jhalak Dikhhla Ja 4—Sushant auditioned for this Abhishek Kapoor directorial, and bagged one of the three lead roles alongside Rajkummar Rao and Amit Sadh. His portrayal of former district-level cricketer Ishaan Bhatt, who falls prey to politics in the selection process, in the critical and commercial success earned him raves. Shuddh Desi Romance (2013) Sushant followed it up with this Maneesh Sharma-directed Parineeti Chopra and Vaani Kapoor co-starrer. The romance comedy-drama was set in Jaipur and revolved around youngsters’ take on love and live-in relationships. PK (2014) In Rajkumar Hirani’s satirical comedy-drama led by Aamir Khan and Anushka Sharma, Sushant had a brief yet notable role. Detective Byomkesh Bakshy (2015) Dibakar Banerjee’s mystery thriller featured the actor in the titular role, a character created by Bengali writer Sharanindu Bandopadhyay. Set in the Kolkata of the 1940s, the film was reportedly to get a sequel with Sushant reprising his role. MS Dhoni: The Untold Story (2016) Neeraj Pandey’s biographical drama that traces the journey of the eponymous former Indian skipper-wicket keeper saw Sushant take on another titular role. The film, which also featured Kiara Advani and Disha Patani, secured for Sushant his first Filmfare Best Actor nomination the following year. Raabta (2017) In Dinesh Vijan’s directorial debut, a reincarnation-themed romance actioner, Sushant was paired opposite Kriti Sanon and the duo played star-crossed lovers. The film featured Jim Sarbh, Rajkumar Yadav and Varun Dharma in supporting roles. Kedarnath (2018) The actor reunited with Abhishek ‘Gattu’ Kapoor to headline Sara Ali Khan’s launch vehicle. The inter-faith love story was set against the backdrop of the pilgrim site and revolved around a Muslim boy who falls in love with a rich Brahmin girl. Sonchiriya (2019) Co-written and directed by Abhishek Chaubey, the film is set in the Chambal ravines of 1975 and tells the story of a group of dacoits. It also featured Manoj Bajpayee, Bhumi Pednekar, Ranvir Shorey and Ashutosh Rana. Chhichhore (2019) Sushant followed it up with one of the biggest successes of his career with this Nitesh Tiwari-directed campus comedy-drama. The film won five Filmfare nods, including Best Film and Best Director. It was also Sushant’s last theatrical release.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput was known as someone perennially brimming with ideas and young energy. So, many didn&rsquo;t bat an eyelid while reading his last post on Instagram. Shared with a picture of his late mother on June 3, the post seemed like an inconspicuous observation in line with the general mood across social media feeds&hellip; until Sunday afternoon, when news of the actor’s suicide broke.A student of metaphysics and spirituality, Sushant was a stickler for perfection when it came to his craft. He passed up six films and devoted six months to Shekhar Kapur&rsquo;s futuristic sci-fi romantic drama, Paani, which revolved around water wars. Prep for the 34-year-old actor meant reading and re-reading the script, understanding the character, his back story, where he was coming from and where he was headed. Talking to Mirror (September 14, 2015), he had pointed out that he could have sixpack abs but not for show, “because this guy lives in the Lower City, where everybody fights to get something to eat and then, there&rsquo;s no water”. It was only when he realised thatwould go on the floors before Paani, that he shifted focus to the biopic, spending 18 months ‘becoming’ the titular character with former Indian wicketkeeper Kiran More. “Complete immersion is important, more so when you&rsquo;re playing a real-life living character. Viewers must feel you are him and not pretending to be him,&rdquo; he had reasoned, admitting that there were times when he felt like he was talking like Dhoni.During that interview, he was asked what if he could fast forward to 2040, when Paani unfolds, and he looked horrified, “I wouldn&rsquo;t even jump a year ahead, forget 25 years. I’m a control freak, which is why I can&rsquo;t sleep at night for longer than four-five hours. My friends insisted that I consult a doctor, who told me that I was excited and restless for no particular reason, which is why I couldn&rsquo;t sleep. Also, I was afraid that if I did, I would lose control.”Sushant was a National Olympiad winner in physics, and having grown up in a large family, had learnt the value of money early on, when he couldn’t pursue his dream of going to Stanford University. Instead, he took the All India Engineering Entrance Exam (popularly known as AIEEE) and came seventh, securing a seat in the prestigious Delhi College of Engineering. However, he dropped out in the final year. “If I had waited another six months, I could have come to Mumbai with a degree. I take time to make decisions, but once it is made, there are no regrets or uncertainty,” he had pointed out.Starting out with TV soaps like Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil and Pavitra Rishta, he made a smooth transition to films with Abhishek Kapoor’s!, for which he bagged a Filmfare Award for Best Debut. With just 10 releases, his filmography is short but varied, with films like, Detective Byomkesh Bakshy, PK, Kedarnath and his last release, Chhichhore, in which Sushant played a doting dad trying to revive his son from a coma caused by a suicide attempt.Around the release of the Abhishek Chaubey-directed dacoit drama,, the actor had told Mirror that he has 12 films in the pipeline. “It’s for me to decide what to do next…There is no film that I want to do that I can’t do,” he had stated confidently. His last film, Dil Bechara, an official adaptation of The Fault In Our Stars, was gearing up for a direct-to-digital release.Two years ago, the actor had flown down to National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to train as anto play one in a film, which he later opted out of, but not before buying a piece of land on the moon and promising to come up with his own space film. Then, as a part of his 50-dreams-to-realise list, he wanted to send kids for workshops at Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and NASA. He would regularly study constellations in the sky from the terrace of his Pavana home, also going fishing, boating and swimming in the lake close by. But he had clarilifed that both the Bandra apartment and this holiday home were rented. “The only property I own is on the Moon, besides the Maserati, which was a childhood dream,” he had informed.During the lockdown, the actor was learning how to code for his love of computer games. He even listed down tried-and-tested methods to optimise Return of Investment on time, advising fans to get seven hours of sleep, meditate regularly, journal, exercise, optimise digital time and practice intermittent fasting to upgrade their quality of life. His words, &ldquo;If you give me more money and fame, I will keep it because I am smart, but if I don’t get it, I won’t worry because I have enough already,” spoken during an interview, resonate as we bid him adieu.Last year, he had confided that for his 33rd birthday on January 21, he had wanted to fly to Norway and paint the Northern Lights. It was one of the many things on his 150-to-do list that remained incomplete.

<h3 id="from-guru-dutt-to-sushant-singh-rajput-a-look-at-suicides-in-indian-cinema">&ldquo;From Guru Dutt to Sushant Singh Rajput: A look at suicides in Indian cinema&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/715_-/2020/06/pjimage-24-1592161163.jpg" alt="img">
Image Source : INSTAGRAM From Guru Dutt to Sushant Singh Rajput: A look at suicides in Indian cinema</p>
<p>The curse of suicide has haunted the showbiz since time immemorial with the likes of iconic actor-director Guru Dutt, South star Silk Smitha, actor Jiah Khan and now Bollywood star Sushant Singh Rajput giving up on life in the Indian film industry known for being harsh and demanding of its stars.</p>
<p>Known for films like &ldquo;Kai Po Che!&quot;, &ldquo;MS Dhoni: The Untold Story&rdquo;, &ldquo;Chhichhore&rdquo;, Rajput was found hanging at his Bandra home, the police said on Sunday.</p>
<p>He was 34.</p>
<p>Rajput’s last screen appearance was Nitesh Tiwari’s 2019 film &ldquo;Chhichhore&rdquo;, where he played the role of a father who conveys a message of hope and affirmation to his son who has attempted to kill himself.</p>
<p>And his last social media post, dedicated to his late mother who died in 2002 when he was a young teen, was on June 3, a foretelling perhaps on what to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blurred past evaporating from teardrops.Unending dreams carving an arc of smile. &ldquo;And a fleeting life, negotiating between the two,&rdquo; he wrote on Instagram post with a black and white photograph of his mother.</p>
<p>Rajput’s sudden death comes days after his former manager, 28-year-old Disha Salian, ended her life by jumping from a high rise building on June 9.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such devastating news.My deepest condolences to Disha&rsquo;s family and friends. May your soul rest in peace,&rdquo; he had said, mourning her death.</p>
<p>Guru Dutt</p>
<p>Guru Dutt, known for black-and-white classics like &ldquo;Kaagaz Ke Phool&rdquo;, &ldquo;Baazi&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Pyaasa&rdquo;, was found dead on October 10, 1964 in his bed in his rented apartment at Pedder Road in erstwhile Bombay. He was 39.</p>
<p>The filmmaker, whose real name was Vasanth Kumar Shivashankar Padukone, was said to have been mixing alcohol and sleeping pills.</p>
<p>Dutt&rsquo;s death may have been suicide or just an accidental overdose. His son, Arun Dutt, considered the death to be an accident.</p>
<p>Vijaylakshmi</p>
<p>Actor Vijaylakshmi, who reached the iconic status of a sex symbol in Tamil cinema during her time, as Silk Smitha died at the age of 33 as the result of a suspected suicide in 1996. She appeared in over 200 films, including &ldquo;Vandichakkaram&rdquo;, &ldquo;Moondru Mugam&rdquo;, a most sought after actor at a time was said to be neck deep in controversies.</p>
<p>She was immortalised on screen in the 2011 film &ldquo;The Dirty Picture&rdquo;, starring Vidya Balan as Silk. The Milan Luthria-directed film, which showed the highs and lows of the dancing star, was inspired by the actor&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Nafisa Joseph</p>
<p>Former Miss India and video jockey Nafisa Joseph was found hanging at her residence in Versova in 2004 at the age of 25.</p>
<p>Joseph, who won the Miss India title in 1997, had worked as a model and had been involved in activities related to animal rights.</p>
<p>In 2006, model-turned television actor Kuljeet Randhawa, known for starring in high-school drama &ldquo;Hip Hip Hurray!&quot;, suspense serial &ldquo;Kohinoor&rdquo; and crime thriller drama &ldquo;Special Squad&rdquo;, allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself in her single room apartment in suburban Juhu. She was 25.</p>
<p>Kunal Singh</p>
<p>Kunal Singh, best known for starring opposite actor Sonali Bendre in the 1999 Tamil romance film &ldquo;Kadhalar Dhinam&rdquo;, was found hanging from the ceiling fan in his Mumbai apartment in 2008. He was 30.</p>
<p>Jiah Khan</p>
<p>British-American actor Jiah Khan, best known for films like &ldquo;Nishabd&rdquo; with megastar Amitabh Bachchan and &ldquo;Ghajini&rdquo; with Aamir Khan, was found hanging at her Mumbai residence on June 3, 2013 by her mother Rabiya Khan. Khan was 25.</p>
<p>It was deemed a suicide and reconfirmed as a suicide in 2016 following an extensive investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and a hearing at the Bombay High Court.</p>
<p>Khan&rsquo;s mother blamed her boyfriend, actor Sooraj Pancholi, for her death. He was charged with abetting Khan&rsquo;s suicide. The case has not yet been settled.</p>
<p>Kushal Punjabi</p>
<p>Last year, actor Kushal Punjabi, who appeared in films such as &ldquo;Kaal&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lakshya&rdquo; as well as the reality show &ldquo;Fear Factor&rdquo;, was found hanging in his Bandra apartment.</p>
<p>He was 42.</p>
<p>Punjabi, whose body was found by his parents in the wee hours of December 27, left behind a suicide note in which he said nobody should be held responsible for his death.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l110_13241592203114.jpg" alt="img">
A talented actor with a charming personality and an infectious smile, Sushant Singh Rajput bid an early adieu as he passed away on Sunday at age 34. The late actor had some tremendous ambitions. In fact, on a fine day in September last year, Rajput documented a bucket list of 50 dreams that he wanted to achieve. Sadly, they will remain unfulfilled.</p>

<p>Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput committed suicide at his home in Mumbai. The actor was 34.</p>
<p>The news has sent shockwaves through the film industry and comes a few days after his former manager Disha Salian reportedly killed herself.</p>
<p>According to reports, the award-winning actor was found hanging from his ceiling in his Bandra residence in Mumbai.</p>

<p>Singh is a self-made star who has acted in films including &lsquo;Shudh Desi Romance&rsquo; and &lsquo;Chhichhore&rsquo;. His close friend in Dubai Raza Beig, CEO of Splash, expressed his deep shock.</p>
<p>“He was one of my closest friends. We have hung together in Dubai a lot. I still can’t believe that he has gone,” said Beig.</p>
<p>Singh was living alone in his residence during the lockdown. According to Mumbai Police, the reason for his suicide is yet to be confirmed and post mortem reports are awaited.</p>
<p>Singh Rajput was a self-made star who was a perfect antidote to the nepotism charge plaguing Bollywood.</p>
<p>The Patna-born outsider was a young actor who made it through merit alone. He didn’t have powerful industry connections, nor was he born into an acting dynasty, but rather chose to make a mark through a clutch of meaningful films. His career catalogue is lean but rich with content-driven films.</p>
<p>The actor, who made ripples in Bollywood through director Abhishek Kapoor’s ‘Kai Po Che!’, has acted in several good films including &lsquo;Detective Byomkesh Bakshi&rsquo; (2015) and &lsquo;MS Dhoni: The Untold Story&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Instead of being prolific and acting in myriad projects, Rajput belonged to the new breed of actor who believed in quality than quantity.</p>
<p>Apart from a few creative misfires like his recent Netflix film &lsquo;Drive&rsquo; and re-incarnation drama &lsquo;Raabta&rsquo;, the actor has always shone in lead hero roles.</p>
<p>CELEBS MOURN SINGH</p>
<p>Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar expressed his shock in a tweet. &ldquo;Honestly this news has left me shocked and speechless&hellip;I remember watching #SushantSinghRajput in Chhichhore and telling my friend Sajid, its producer how much I’d enjoyed the film and wish I’d been a part of it. Such a talented actor&hellip;may God give strength to his family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actor Aftab Shivdasani also tweeted his shock. &ldquo;Sushant nooo!! that’s the most disturbing news!!! Broken&hellip; so so so sad.. why? Why end such a young and beautiful life that too suicide??!! So so heartbroken..&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dancer Mukti Mohan tweeted: &ldquo;This is so unsettling&hellip;Can&rsquo;t believe such a happy dancing soul is not among us now. #SushantSinghRajput You rest in peace in your mother&rsquo;s lap my friend. Heartiest condolences to all his loved ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Actor Mohammed Zeeshan Ayub tweeted: &ldquo;Still can’t believe the news&hellip;.so so so painful to hear this&hellip;can’t say anything&hellip;it’s to much to handle..just rest in peace my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The actor&rsquo;s last Instagram post, put up a week ago, was a tearful ode to his late mother.

<p><img src="https://2tjkwj41v8oc2lfdtr39exre-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/pavitra-rishta_social.jpg" alt="img">
Ekta Kapoor’s Pavitra Rishta marked Sushant Singh Rajput and Ankita Lokhande’s grand debut in the showbiz industry.</p>
<p>The ongoing lockdown, which was imposed over a month ago to combat COVID 19 pandemic, is like the two sides of a coin. While it has emerged as the need of the hour and a chance to reconnect with the loved ones, this lockdown has also brought the economy to a standstill. In fact, all the movie releases and shootings have also been suspended, leaving the fans looking out for means for entertainment during the lockdown. Amid this crisis situation, television producers have decided to re-run several popular shows for the audience.</p>
<p>After the grand comeback of shows like Ramayan, Mahabharat, Hum Paanch, Shrimaan Shrimati, Circus, Dekh Bhai Dekh etc, another popular show has made its way back to the television screens. We are talking about Sushant Singh Rajput and Ankita Lokhande starrer Pavitra Rishta which had ruled the TRP charts during its run. The announcement was made by Ekta Kapoor who shared a video from the show on Instagram and wrote, “#pavitrarishta back! credit: @balajitelefilmslimited… Dekhiye #PavitraRishta Mon-Fri, dopahar 3 baje, @zeetv par..”</p>
<p>Take a look at Ekta Kapoor’s post for Pavitra Rishta:</p>
<p>To recall, Pavitra Rishta marked the acting debut of both Sushant and Ankita. In fact, the family drama also opened ways for a Bollywood debut for Sushant. While Sushant and Ankita’s chemistry won a million of hearts, the duo also began dating each other during the show and became one of the most talked about couples of Indian television until the called it quits in 2016.
