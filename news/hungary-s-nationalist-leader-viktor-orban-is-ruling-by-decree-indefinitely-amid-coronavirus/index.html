Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban (C) votes with other representatives about the government&rsquo;s bill on the protection against the new coronavirus COVID-19 at the plenary session of the Hungarian Parliament in Budapest, Hungary on March 30, 2020.</p>
<p>Hungary&rsquo;s Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been granted the right to rule by decree for an indefinite period of time, and these new sweeping powers are raising concerns in Europe.</p>
<p>The Hungarian parliament approved a bill Monday that allows Orban to rule the country by decree, meaning that he does not need to consult with other lawmakers to make decisions. The legislation, which came into force Tuesday, has been justified as an emergency response to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>As a result, the bill criminalizes any attempts to stop the Hungarian government fighting the outbreak, including the spreading of false information, which could be punishable with a prison sentence of up to five years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Hungarian government&rsquo;s primary concern during the coronavirus pandemic is the protection of human lives,&rdquo; a spokesperson for the Hungarian government told CNBC via email Tuesday.</p>
<p>However, the bill has sparked criticism elsewhere in Europe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Covid-19 requires adequate responses. But they must not endanger rule of law, disempower democratic institutions or put fundamental rights at risk. We need to overcome this together, not rule through decrees,&rdquo; Michael Roth, Germany&rsquo;s minister for European affairs, said Monday.</p>
<p>Orban has been in the spotlight over recent years for his government&rsquo;s increasing oversight of the judiciary, media and foreign universities.

<h3 id="eu-warns-hungary-over-coronavirus-power-grab">EU warns Hungary over coronavirus power grab</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.dw.com/image/52961672_304.jpg" alt="img">
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday warned European Union nations that action taken to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus should be &ldquo;limited&rdquo; and &ldquo;strictly proportionate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The head of the EU&rsquo;s executive arm issued a statement a day after Hungary&rsquo;s far-right Prime Minister Viktor Orban was granted sweeping powers to rule by decree without a time limit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is of utmost importance that emergency measures are not at the expense of our fundamental principles and values,&rdquo; said Von der Leyen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any emergency measures must be limited to what is necessary and strictly proportionate. They must not last indefinitely &hellip; governments must make sure that such measures are subject to regular scrutiny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hungarian lawmakers passed the bill on Monday with 137 votes against 52 in the lower chamber, where Orban&rsquo;s Fidesz party holds a two-thirds majority. President Janos Ader later signed it into law.</p>
<p>Orban said his government needed the right to pass special decrees under emergency rule in response to the outbreak of the coronavirus SARS-COV-2.</p>

<p>Just 16 deaths so far</p>
<p>Hungary had 492 confirmed cases as of Tuesday, and 16 people have died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The draft also includes the introduction of jail terms of up to five years for people who spread &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; about the virus or measures against it, raising anxieties about freedom of the press in Hungary.</p>
<p>Opposition politicians, human rights groups, and Europe&rsquo;s leading human rights organization the Council of Europe have denounced the bill due to the lack of a time limit.</p>
<p>Orban has gradually expanded his powers since taking office in 2010. The 56-year-old leader has had frequent clashes with human rights groups and EU institutions.</p>
<p>Hungary previously prolonged a state of emergency for several years when it extended measures instituted in 2015 over the fear of mass migration, despite a decrease in the number of migrants coming to Hungary.

<p>It is time to kick Hungary out of the European Union and NATO. The country entered the Western alliance in the aftermath of the Cold War as a fledgling democracy, but has since reverted to autocracy.</p>
<p>Hungary crossed what should be a red line on Monday, as the country’s Parliament granted Prime Minister Viktor Orbán the power to rule by decree indefinitely. Opposition parties tried to set a time limit on those powers, but Orbán’s ruling Fidesz party pushed through his motion without restriction.</p>
<p>The measure’s putative rationale was to strengthen the government’s hand in fighting the coronavirus, which has infected 447 Hungarians and killed 15. But Orbán can cite the law to justify any measure on any subject. It is worth noting that in 2015 he declared a state of emergency to stave off the flow of refugees entering his country, and those emergency powers—which included shutting down media outlets critical of his policies—are still in force.</p>
<p>All of these steps violate the tenets of the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights. As the charter puts it, the whole point of the European Union was to build “a peaceful future based on common values,” including “freedom, equality,” as well as “the principles of democracy and the rule of law.” This includes the freedom “to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority.”</p>
<p>Last week, anticipating the bill’s passage, the EU’s justice commissioner, Didier Reynders, said the union’s members would assess whether the Hungarian law violates their rule-of-law standards. Clearly it does, and appropriate steps should be taken if these standards—and the EU itself—are still to have any meaning.</p>
<p>Orbán’s steps also violate the precepts of NATO. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is principally a security alliance, originally joining the United States and the Western European powers to deter and fend off an attack by the Soviet Union. However, Article 2 of the 1949 Washington Treaty—which created NATO—states that the members “will contribute toward the further development of peaceful and friendly international relations by strengthening their free institutions.”</p>
<p>Moreover, the treaty’s Membership Action Plan—signed in 1999, as several central and Eastern European countries (including Hungary) petitioned to join NATO—stated the point much more firmly and set forth some rules, which Orbán is now breaking.</p>
<p>“Future members,” the document stated, “must conform to basic principles embodied in the Washington Treaty such as democracy [and] individual liberty.” Aspirants, it added, “would also be expected … to demonstrate commitment to the rule of law and human rights.”</p>
<p>Again, Orbán is violating these principles and expectations.</p>
<p>Ironically, in the 1980s, as Timothy Garton Ash has written, Orbán was a leader of Hungary’s democratic movement, forcefully demanding the withdrawal of Soviet troops and pushing for human rights, free markets, and a civil society. Those days are long over.</p>
<p>This isn’t a matter of mere nomenclature. Members of the EU receive bountiful economic rewards. Members of NATO receive the security guarantee of the Washington Treaty’s Article 5, pledging all members that “an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.”</p>
<p>The true democracies of the EU, such as they are, shouldn’t give up a single euro to the coffers of Hungary as long as Orbán rules by decree. Nor should the democracies of NATO pledge to give up a drop of blood to preserve his reign.
