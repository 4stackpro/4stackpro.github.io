(CNN) The coronavirus pandemic has challenged Christian churches to find socially distant ways to launch Holy Week on Palm Sunday.</p>
<p>Also known as Passion Sunday, the day recounts the biblical story of Jesus&rsquo; triumphant arrival in Jerusalem before his crucifixion, with palm leaves and clothing laid in his path. It comes on the last Sunday of Lent and first day of Holy Week.</p>
<p>Before the deadly pandemic&rsquo;s social distancing guidelines altered life across America, Christians often celebrated with processions and the distribution of palm leaves.</p>
<p>Palm Sunday during the pandemic will be different than this 2017 procession at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem&rsquo;s Old City.</p>
<p>So faith leaders throughout the country have come up with new ways to observe the holy day &ndash; from streaming video and audio to fronds dipped in bleach to volunteers in protective garb handing out sanitized palms to passing cars.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be an entirely palmless Sunday.</p>

<h3 id="a-complete-guide-to-celebrate-palm-sunday-at-home">A complete guide to celebrate Palm Sunday at home</h3>
<p><img src="https://aleteiaen.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/web3-christ-entrance-jerusalem-art-painting-at005-public-domain-18.jpg?quality=100&amp;strip=all" alt="img">
In order to keep Palm Sunday holy in a worthy manner, Aleteia, in collaboration with Magnificat magazine, offers you this home celebration of the Word of God.</p>
<p>How to carry out the blessing of the palms:</p>
<p>Prepare the palms for the blessing ahead of time.</p>
<p>If you have a yard:</p>
<p>The twigs of any tree or shrub may be suitable, as long as they are green and bear leaves. Indeed, the first leaves of spring or evergreen branches symbolize new life triumphing over death. In order of preference, you can choose branches of the following species: palm, olive, citrus, boxwood, yew, other evergreen species, willow, forsythia, any of the prunus genus (plums, peaches, etc.), Japanese cherry.</p>
<p>For those who do not have a garden:</p>
<p>If there are only two or three of people, perhaps small sprigs of a beautiful green plant will do.</p>
<p>Otherwise, with a clear, thick black line, draw on sheets of paper (or on cardboard) a palm branch which, if possible, should be painted green.</p>
<p>If the media is strong enough to stand up afterwards, the palm can be cut out with scissors. Everyone takes their leaf or palm for the Blessing.</p>
<p>At the end of the celebration, a small procession can be organized to put a blessed branch on each crucifix in the house. In the absence of branches, a small piece of the blessed paper or cardboard can be used instead.</p>
<p>Instructions for the Reading of the Passion according to St. Matthew:</p>
<p>This Reading is particularly beautiful and engaging. In order to do it justice, you should make an effort to read it relatively slowly, in a strong voice and with good diction.</p>
<p>You should distribute the roles for the reading ahead of time.</p>
<p>The roles are designated throughout the reading with the following letters:</p>
<p>X = Christ; N = Narrator; V = Voice; C = Crowd.</p>
<p>If there are only three readers, the Narrator (N) will also read the Crowd (C).</p>
<p>If there are only two readers, the Narrator (N) will also read the Crowd (C), and the Voice (V).</p>
<p>The reader should, with measure, give appropriate intonation to the words according to the dramatic development of the reading.</p>
<p>Ideally, each reader should prepare their part of the reading ahead of time.</p>
<hr>
<p>General guidelines:</p>
<p>If you’re alone, it is better to simply read the readings and prayers of this Sunday’s Mass in your missal and/or to follow the Mass on television.</p>
<p>This celebration requires the presence of at least two people.</p>
<p>It can take place from Saturday evening (Sunday vigil) to Sunday evening.</p>
<p>However, Sunday morning remains the most appropriate time.</p>
<p>This celebration is particularly suitable for use with family, friends and neighbors. However, in order to respect quarantine measures, you should verify whether it is allowed to invite neighbors or friends. In any event, if you do so, you should ensure that all safety guidelines are strictly followed.</p>
<p>Set up the needed number of chairs in front of a prayer corner, respecting the distance of one yard between each.</p>
<p>A simple cross or crucifix must always be visible in the background.</p>
<p>Light one or more candles, placing them on non-flammable stands (such as candlesticks or small porcelain plates). Don’t forget to blow them out at the end of the celebration.</p>
<p>Flowers are not used to adorn the prayer corner. It will give us all the more joy to put them back on the Vigil of Easter.</p>
<p>Designate a person to lead the prayer. In order of priority, they could be: a deacon, an instituted lay person (lector, etc.), or the father or mother of the family.</p>
<p>The leader also determines the length of the moments of silence.</p>
<p>Designate various readers for the readings.</p>
<p>Prepare the Universal Prayer (see a model below) in advance and select someone to lead it.</p>
<p>You may also prepare appropriate songs.</p>
<hr>
<p>PALM SUNDAY OF THE PASSION OF THE LORD</p>
<p>Celebration of the Word</p>
<p>“Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.”</p>
<p>All are seated. The leader of the celebration reads:</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters,</p>
<p>This [morning], on this Palm Sunday,</p>
<p>we are prevented from participating in</p>
<p>the celebration of the Eucharist.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we know well that when we gather</p>
<p>to pray in His name,</p>
<p>Christ Jesus is present in our midst.</p>
<p>We believe that when we read Scripture in the Church,</p>
<p>it is the Word of God itself that speaks to us.</p>
<p>His Word is then real food for our lives.</p>
<p>That is why, coming together,</p>
<p>in communion with the whole Church, we listen to His Word.</p>
<p>Pause</p>
<p>Palm Sunday invites us to pass from</p>
<p>anguish to hope, from fear to self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>This, step by step we advance towards the truth of Easter.</p>
<p>In these trying days, we become aware, sorrowfully,</p>
<p>of our limitations and fragility.</p>
<p>However, let there be no doubt:</p>
<p>what Jesus said yesterday to Saint Paul,</p>
<p>He says today to all of us:</p>
<p>“My grace is sufficient for you,</p>
<p>for power is made perfect in weakness.”</p>
<p>Pause</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, all rise and make the Sign of the Cross, saying:</p>
<p>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</p>
<p>BLESSING OF THE PALMS</p>
<p>Take in hand the branches you have prepared (or their substitute), and raise them up, waving them and singing the Sanctus to a familiar melody, in English or Latin.</p>
<p>Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts.</p>
<p>Heaven and earth are full of your glory.</p>
<p>Hosanna in the highest.</p>
<p>Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.</p>
<p>Hosanna in the highest.</p>
<p>Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus Dóminus Deus Sábaoth.</p>
<p>Pleni sunt caeli et terra glória tua.</p>
<p>Hosánna in excélsis.</p>
<p>Benedíctus qui venit in nómine Dómini.</p>
<p>Hosánna in excélsis.</p>
<p>Still holding the branches, hold them out in front of you. The leader of the prayer, with hands joined, says the prayer of blessing.</p>
<p>Increase the faith of those who place their hope in you, O God, and graciously hear the prayers of those who call on you, that we, who today hold high these branches to hail Christ in his triumph, may bear fruit for you by good works accomplished in him. Who lives and reigns for ever and ever.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>GOSPEL</p>
<p>All stand, and the reader reads the Gospel of the Palms.</p>
<p>The Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Matthew (21:1-11)</p>
<p>When Jesus and the disciples drew near Jerusalem and came to Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them, “Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find an ass tethered, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them here to me. And if anyone should say anything to you, reply, ‘The master has need of them.’ Then he will send them at once.”</p>
<p>This happened so that what had been spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled:</p>
<p>Say to daughter Zion,</p>
<p>“Behold, your king comes to you,</p>
<p>meek and riding on an ass,</p>
<p>and on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.”</p>
<p>The disciples went and did as Jesus had ordered them.</p>
<p>They brought the ass and the colt and laid their cloaks over them, and he sat upon them.</p>
<p>The very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, while others cut branches from the trees and strewed them on the road. The crowds preceding him and those following kept crying out and saying:</p>
<p>“Hosanna to the Son of David; blessed is the he who comes in the name of the Lord; hosanna in the highest.”</p>
<p>And when he entered Jerusalem the whole city was shaken and asked, “Who is this?”</p>
<p>And the crowds replied, “This is Jesus the prophet, from Nazareth in Galilee.”</p>
<p>At the end of the Gospel, all acclaim the Lord once again singing the second part of the Sanctus, in English or latin.</p>
<p>Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.</p>
<p>Hosanna in the highest. (Bis)</p>
<p>Benedíctus qui venit in nómine Dómini.</p>
<p>Hosánna in excélsis.(Bis)</p>
<p>All lay down their palms in an appropriate place and then sit down. The prayer leader speaks, inviting all to reflect.</p>
<p>O Jesus, during this celebration of the Palms,</p>
<p>we have just commemorated your triumphant entry into Jerusalem,</p>
<p>and we have just united the impulse of our hearts and the sound of our voices</p>
<p>to acclaim you, united in one heart and one mind with your Church.</p>
<p>Yes, we want you to triumph, you who come in the name of the Lord,</p>
<p>O Jesus, our brother and our God.</p>
<p>Grant us the grace never to lose sight of the truth of Easter,</p>
<p>the truth you’re going to teach us throughout your Passion.</p>
<p>This Easter truth is this:</p>
<p>Christian triumph always passes through a cross,</p>
<p>and through the gift of his life for love,</p>
<p>until the very end.</p>
<p>Pause</p>
<p>Now, let us prepare ourselves to open our hearts</p>
<p>to the Passion of the Lord, observing a moment of silence.</p>
<p>Still seated, all bow their heads and close their eyes to reflect with greater concentration. All are silent for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>The prayer leader marks the end of the period of silence, then invites the participants to stand, and says:</p>
<p>As the Lord entered the holy city, the children of the Hebrews proclaimed the resurrection of life. With them, we sing</p>
<p>Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.</p>
<p>Hosanna in the highest. (Bis)</p>
<p>Benedíctus qui venit in nómine Dómini.</p>
<p>Hosánna in excélsis. (Bis)</p>
<p>The reader for the first reading remains standing while the others sit down.</p>
<p>FIRST READING</p>
<p>A reading from the book of the Prophet Isaiah (Is 50:4-7)</p>
<p>The Lord God has given me a well-trained tongue, that I might know how to speak to the weary a word that will rouse them. Morning after morning he opens my ear that I may hear; and I have not rebelled, have not turned back. I gave my back to those who beat me, my cheeks to those who plucked my beard; my face I did not shield from buffets and spitting.</p>
<p>The Lord God is my help, therefore I am not disgraced; I have set my face like flint, knowing that I shall not be put to shame.</p>
<p>The word of the Lord.</p>
<p>Thanks be to God.</p>
<p>If possible, it is preferable for the psalm to be sung. When the celebration is held by a family, the response may be simply said or sung after the reader has read the stanza.</p>
<p>PSALM 22</p>
<p>R/ My God, my God, why have you abandoned me? (Ps 21:2a)</p>
<p>All who see me scoff at me;</p>
<p>they mock me with parted lips, they wag their heads:</p>
<p>“He relied on the Lord; let him deliver him,</p>
<p>let him rescue him, if he loves him.” R/</p>
<p>Indeed, many dogs surround me,</p>
<p>a pack of evildoers closes in upon me;</p>
<p>they have pierced my hands and my feet;</p>
<p>I can count all my bones. R/</p>
<p>They divide my garments among them,</p>
<p>and for my vesture they cast lots.</p>
<p>But you, O Lord, be not far from me;</p>
<p>O my help, hasten to aid me. R/</p>
<p>I will proclaim your name to my brethren;</p>
<p>in the midst of the assembly I will praise you:</p>
<p>“You who fear the Lord, praise him;</p>
<p>all you descendants of Jacob, give glory to him;</p>
<p>revere him, all you descendants of Israel!” R/</p>
<p>SECOND READING</p>
<p>A reading from the letter of Saint Paul to the Philippians (Ph 2:6-11)</p>
<p>Christ Jesus, though he was in the form of God, did not regard equality with God something to be grasped. Rather, he emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, coming in human likeness; and found human in appearance, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.</p>
<p>Because of this, God greatly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend, of those in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>
<p>The word of the Lord.</p>
<p>Thanks be to God.</p>
<p>GOSPEL</p>
<p>Glory and praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>Christ became obedient to the point of death,</p>
<p>even death on a cross.</p>
<p>because of this, God greatly exalted him</p>
<p>and bestowed on him the name which is above every name.</p>
<p>Glory and praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ!</p>
<p>The reading is done according to the roles determined ahead of time.</p>
<p>The letters designating the various readers are as follows:</p>
<p>X = Christ; N = Narrator; V = Voice; C = Crowd.</p>
<p>[The shorter form (27:11-54) is indicated by brackets.]</p>
<p>If young children are present, they may be seated.</p>
<p>The Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ according to Matthew 26:14–27:66</p>
<p>N One of the Twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and said,</p>
<p>V “What are you willing to give me if I hand him over to you?”</p>
<p>N They paid him thirty pieces of silver, and from that time on he looked for an</p>
<p>opportunity to hand him over.</p>
<p>On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples approached Jesus and said,</p>
<p>V “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?”</p>
<p>N He said,</p>
<p>X “Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, ‘The teacher says, “My appointed time draws near; in your house I shall celebrate the Passover with my disciples.”’”</p>
<p>N The disciples then did as Jesus had ordered, and prepared the Passover.</p>
<p>When it was evening, he reclined at table with the Twelve. And while they were eating, he said,</p>
<p>X “Amen, I say to you, one of you will betray me.”</p>
<p>N Deeply distressed at this, they began to say to him one after another,</p>
<p>V “Surely it is not I, Lord?”</p>
<p>N He said in reply,</p>
<p>X “He who has dipped his hand into the dish with me is the one who will betray me. The Son of Man indeed goes, as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed. It would be better for that man if he had never been born.”</p>
<p>N Then Judas, his betrayer, said in reply,</p>
<p>V “Surely it is not I, Rabbi?”</p>
<p>N He answered,</p>
<p>X “You have said so.”</p>
<p>N While they were eating, Jesus took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and giving it to his disciples said,</p>
<p>X “Take and eat; this is my body.”</p>
<p>N Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying,</p>
<p>X “Drink from it, all of you, for this is my blood of the covenant, which will be shed on behalf of many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you, from now on I shall not drink this fruit of the vine until the day when I drink it with you new in the kingdom of my Father.”</p>
<p>N Then, after singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. Then Jesus said to them,</p>
<p>X “This night all of you will have your faith in me shaken, for it is written:/ I will strike the shepherd,/ and the sheep of the flock will be dispersed;/ but after I have been raised up, I shall go before you to Galilee.”</p>
<p>N Peter said to him in reply,</p>
<p>V “Though all may have their faith in you shaken, mine will never be.”</p>
<p>N Jesus said to him,</p>
<p>X “Amen, I say to you, this very night before the cock crows, you will deny me three times.”</p>
<p>N Peter said to him,</p>
<p>V “Even though I should have to die with you, I will not deny you.”</p>
<p>N And all the disciples spoke likewise. Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples,</p>
<p>X “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”</p>
<p>N He took along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to feel sorrow and distress. Then he said to them,</p>
<p>X “My soul is sorrowful even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me.”</p>
<p>N He advanced a little and fell prostrate in prayer, saying,</p>
<p>X “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet, not as I will, but as you will.”</p>
<p>N When he returned to his disciples he found them asleep. He said to Peter,</p>
<p>X “So you could not keep watch with me for one hour? Watch and pray that you may not undergo the test. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”</p>
<p>N Withdrawing a second time, he prayed again,</p>
<p>X “My Father, if it is not possible that this cup pass without my drinking it, your will be done!”</p>
<p>N Then he returned once more and found them asleep, for they could not keep their eyes open. He left them and withdrew again and prayed a third time, saying the same thing again. Then he returned to his disciples and said to them,</p>
<p>X “Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Behold, the hour is at hand when the Son of Man is to be handed over to sinners. Get up, let us go. Look, my betrayer is at hand.”</p>
<p>N While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, accompanied by a large crowd, with swords and clubs, who had come from the chief priests and the elders of the people. His betrayer had arranged a sign with them, saying,</p>
<p>V “The man I shall kiss is the one; arrest him.”</p>
<p>N Immediately he went over to Jesus and said,</p>
<p>V “Hail, Rabbi!”</p>
<p>N and he kissed him. Jesus answered him,</p>
<p>X “Friend, do what you have come for.”</p>
<p>N Then stepping forward they laid hands on Jesus and arrested him. And behold, one of those who accompanied Jesus put his hand to his sword, drew it, and struck the high priest’s servant, cutting off his ear. Then Jesus said to him,</p>
<p>X “Put your sword back into its sheath, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword. Do you think that I cannot call upon my Father and he will not provide me at this moment with more than twelve legions of angels? But then how would the Scriptures be fulfilled which say that it must come to pass in this way?”</p>
<p>N At that hour Jesus said to the crowds,</p>
<p>X “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to seize me? Day after day I sat teaching in the temple area, yet you did not arrest me. But all this has come to pass that the writings of the prophets may be fulfilled.”</p>
<p>N Then all the disciples left him and fled.</p>
<p>Those who had arrested Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled. Peter was following him at a distance as far as the high priest’s courtyard, and going inside he sat down with the servants to see the outcome. The chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin kept trying to obtain false testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death, but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally two came forward who stated,</p>
<p>C “This man said, ‘I can destroy the temple of God and within three days rebuild it.’”</p>
<p>N The high priest rose and addressed him,</p>
<p>V “Have you no answer? What are these men testifying against you?”</p>
<p>N But Jesus was silent. Then the high priest said to him,</p>
<p>V “I order you to tell us under oath before the living God whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.”</p>
<p>N Jesus said to him in reply,</p>
<p>X “You have said so. But I tell you:/ From now on you will see ‘the Son of Man/ seated at the right hand of the Power’/ and ‘coming on the clouds of heaven.’”</p>
<p>N Then the high priest tore his robes and said,</p>
<p>V “He has blasphemed! What further need have we of witnesses? You have now heard the blasphemy; what is your opinion?”</p>
<p>N They said in reply,</p>
<p>C “He deserves to die!”</p>
<p>N Then they spat in his face and struck him, while some slapped him, saying,</p>
<p>C “Prophesy for us, Christ: who is it that struck you?”</p>
<p>N Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. One of the maids came over to him and said,</p>
<p>V “You too were with Jesus the Galilean.”</p>
<p>N But he denied it in front of everyone, saying,</p>
<p>V “I do not know what you are talking about!”</p>
<p>N As he went out to the gate, another girl saw him and said to those who were there,</p>
<p>V “This man was with Jesus the Nazorean.”</p>
<p>N Again he denied it with an oath,</p>
<p>V “I do not know the man!”</p>
<p>N A little later the bystanders came over and said to Peter,</p>
<p>C “Surely you too are one of them; even your speech gives you away.”</p>
<p>N At that he began to curse and to swear,</p>
<p>V “I do not know the man.”</p>
<p>N And immediately a cock crowed. Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken: “Before the cock crows you will deny me three times.” He went out and began to weep bitterly.</p>
<p>When it was morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death. They bound him, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate, the governor.</p>
<p>Then Judas, his betrayer, seeing that Jesus had been condemned, deeply regretted what he had done. He returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, saying,</p>
<p>V “I have sinned in betraying innocent blood.”</p>
<p>N They said,</p>
<p>C “What is that to us? Look to it yourself.”</p>
<p>N Flinging the money into the temple, he departed and went off and hanged himself. The chief priests gathered up the money, but said,</p>
<p>C “It is not lawful to deposit this in the temple treasury, for it is the price of blood.”</p>
<p>N After consultation, they used it to buy the potter’s field as a burial place for foreigners. That is why that field even today is called the Field of Blood. Then was fulfilled what had been said through Jeremiah the prophet, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the value of a man with a price on his head, a price set by some of the Israelites, and they paid it out for the potter’s field just as the Lord had commanded me.</p>
<p>Now [Jesus stood before the governor, who questioned him,</p>
<p>V “Are you the king of the Jews?”</p>
<p>N Jesus said,</p>
<p>X “You say so.”</p>
<p>N And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he made no answer.</p>
<p>Then Pilate said to him,</p>
<p>V “Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you?”</p>
<p>N But he did not answer him one word, so that the governor was greatly amazed.</p>
<p>Now on the occasion of the feast the governor was accustomed to release to the crowd one prisoner whom they wished. And at that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas. So when they had assembled, Pilate said to them,</p>
<p>V “Which one do you want me to release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus called Christ?”</p>
<p>N For he knew that it was out of envy that they had handed him over. While he was still seated on the bench, his wife sent him a message, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man. I suffered much in a dream today because of him.” The chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas but to destroy Jesus. The governor said to them in reply,</p>
<p>V “Which of the two do you want me to release to you?”</p>
<p>N They answered,</p>
<p>C “Barabbas!”</p>
<p>N Pilate said to them,</p>
<p>V “Then what shall I do with Jesus called Christ?”</p>
<p>N They all said,</p>
<p>C “Let him be crucified!”</p>
<p>N But he said,</p>
<p>V “Why? What evil has he done?”</p>
<p>N They only shouted the louder,</p>
<p>C “Let him be crucified!”</p>
<p>N When Pilate saw that he was not succeeding at all, but that a riot was breaking out instead, he took water and washed his hands in the sight of the crowd, saying,</p>
<p>V “I am innocent of this man’s blood. Look to it yourselves.”</p>
<p>N And the whole people said in reply,</p>
<p>C “His blood be upon us and upon our children.”</p>
<p>N Then he released Barabbas to them, but after he had Jesus scourged, he handed him over to be crucified.</p>
<p>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus inside the praetorium and gathered the whole cohort around him. They stripped off his clothes and threw a scarlet military cloak about him. Weaving a crown out of thorns, they placed it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying,</p>
<p>C “Hail, King of the Jews!”</p>
<p>N They spat upon him and took the reed and kept striking him on the head. And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the cloak, dressed him in his own clothes, and led him off to crucify him.</p>
<p>As they were going out, they met a Cyrenian named Simon; this man they pressed into service to carry his cross.</p>
<p>And when they came to a place called Golgotha—which means Place of the Skull—, they gave Jesus wine to drink mixed with gall. But when he had tasted it, he refused to drink. After they had crucified him, they divided his garments by casting lots; then they sat down and kept watch over him there. And they placed over his head the written charge against him: This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.</p>
<p>Two revolutionaries were crucified with him, one on his right and the other on his left. Those passing by reviled him, shaking their heads and saying,</p>
<p>C “You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself, if you are the Son of God, and come down from the cross!”</p>
<p>N Likewise the chief priests with the scribes and elders mocked him and said,</p>
<p>C “He saved others; he cannot save himself. So he is the king of Israel! Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now if he wants him. For he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”</p>
<p>N The revolutionaries who were crucified with him also kept abusing him in the same way.</p>
<p>From noon onward, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon. And about three o’clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice,</p>
<p>X “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?”</p>
<p>N which means,</p>
<p>X “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</p>
<p>N Some of the bystanders who heard it said,</p>
<p>C “This one is calling for Elijah.”</p>
<p>N Immediately one of them ran to get a sponge; he soaked it in wine, and putting</p>
<p>it on a reed, gave it to him to drink. But the rest said,</p>
<p>C “Wait, let us see if Elijah comes to save him.”</p>
<p>N But Jesus cried out again in a loud voice, and gave up his spirit.</p>
<p>(Here all kneel and pause for a short time.)</p>
<p>N And behold, the veil of the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth quaked, rocks were split, tombs were opened, and the bodies of many saints who had fallen asleep were raised. And coming forth from their tombs after his resurrection, they entered the holy city and appeared to many. The centurion and the men with him who were keeping watch over Jesus feared greatly when they saw the earthquake and all that was happening, and they said,</p>
<p>C “Truly, this was the Son of God!”]</p>
<p>[End of the short form: The Gospel of the Lord.]</p>
<p>N There were many women there, looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him. Among them were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph, who was himself a disciple of Jesus. He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus; then Pilate ordered it to be handed over. Taking the body, Joseph wrapped it in clean linen and laid it in his new tomb that he had hewn in the rock. Then he rolled a huge stone across the entrance to the tomb and departed. But Mary Magdalene and the other Mary remained sitting there, facing the tomb. The next day, the one following the day of preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate and said,</p>
<p>C “Sir, we remember that this impostor while still alive said, ‘After three days I will be raised up.’ Give orders, then, that the grave be secured until the third day, lest his disciples come and steal him and say to the people, ‘He has been raised from the dead.’ This last imposture would be worse than the first.”</p>
<p>N Pilate said to them,</p>
<p>V “The guard is yours; go, secure it as best you can.”</p>
<p>N So they went and secured the tomb by fixing a seal to the stone and setting the guard.</p>
<p>No acclamation is used at the conclusion of the reading of the Gospel.</p>
<p>All are seated.</p>
<p>The leader repeats slowly, as if it were a deep and far-off echo:</p>
<p>“Truly, this was the Son of God!”</p>
<p>All observe two minutes of silence for personal meditation.</p>
<p>Then, all rise and profess the faith of the Church by saying the Apostles’ Creed:</p>
<p>I believe in God,</p>
<p>the Father almighty,</p>
<p>Creator of heaven and earth,</p>
<p>and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,</p>
<p>who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,</p>
<p>born of the Virgin Mary,</p>
<p>suffered under Pontius Pilate,</p>
<p>was crucified, died and was buried;</p>
<p>he descended into hell;</p>
<p>on the third day he rose again from the dead;</p>
<p>he ascended into heaven,</p>
<p>and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty;</p>
<p>from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.</p>
<p>I believe in the Holy Spirit,</p>
<p>the holy catholic Church,</p>
<p>the communion of saints,</p>
<p>the forgiveness of sins,</p>
<p>the resurrection of the body,</p>
<p>and life everlasting. Amen.</p>
<p>UNIVERSAL PRAYER</p>
<p>All remain standing for the universal prayer which has been prepared beforehand. Or, they may use the following Intercessions,separating the intentions with an intervening moment of silence:</p>
<p>The prayer leader says:</p>
<p>Jesus, King of the ages, enters Jerusalem,</p>
<p>and He walks towards his death; let us implore him:</p>
<p>R/ Forget our sins, and have mercy on us!</p>
<p>Jesus, son of David, your hands are tied</p>
<p>as if you were a thief. R/</p>
<p>Jesus, son of David, you will be thrown</p>
<p>out of town like a prophet. R/</p>
<p>Jesus, son of David, you will be</p>
<p>sacrificed like a lamb. R/</p>
<p>Jesus, Savior, you desired to suffer</p>
<p>for the guilty when you were innocent. R/</p>
<p>Jesus, Savior, you came doing good,</p>
<p>come and heal the suffering in hospitals. R/</p>
<p>Jesus, Savior, you consoled Martha and Mary,</p>
<p>come support those who are in mourning without being able</p>
<p>to accompany their deceased loved ones. R/</p>
<p>Jesus, Son of man and Son of God, bring the dead into the heavenly Jerusalem. R/</p>
<p>Each participant may freely add an intention, to which all respond:</p>
<p>R/ Forget our sins, and have mercy on us!</p>
<p>At the end, the leader introduces to the Lord’s Prayer:</p>
<p>United in the Spirit and in the communion of the Church,</p>
<p>we dare to pray as the Lord Jesus himself</p>
<p>taught us:</p>
<p>All say or sing the Our Father:</p>
<p>Our Father…</p>
<p>Continuing immediately with:</p>
<p>For the kingdom…</p>
<p>Then the leader invites those present to share a sign of peace:</p>
<p>We have just joined our voices</p>
<p>with that of the Lord Jesus to pray to the Father.</p>
<p>We are sons and daughters in the Son.</p>
<p>In the love that unites us with one another,</p>
<p>renewed by the word of God,</p>
<p>we can exchange a gesture of peace,</p>
<p>a sign of the communion</p>
<p>we receive from the Lord.</p>
<p>All then exchange a greeting of peace from a distance: for example, by bowing deeply towards each other in turn; or, as a family, by blowing each other a kiss.</p>
<p>All sit down.</p>
<p>SPIRITUAL COMMUNION</p>
<p>The leader says:</p>
<p>When we can’t receive sacramental communion</p>
<p>for lack of a Mass,</p>
<p>Pope Francis urges us to practice spiritual communion,</p>
<p>also called “communion of desire.”</p>
<p>The Council of Trent reminds us that this</p>
<p>“consists in an ardent desire to feed on the Heavenly Bread,</p>
<p>with a living faith that acts through charity</p>
<p>and that makes us participants in the fruits and graces of the Sacrament.”</p>
<p>The value of our spiritual communion</p>
<p>depends therefore on our faith in the presence of Christ in the Eucharist</p>
<p>as a source of life, love and unity,</p>
<p>and our desire to receive Communion in spite of our inability to do so.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I now invite you to bow your head,</p>
<p>to close your eyes and recollect yourselves.</p>
<p>Silence</p>
<p>Deep in our hearts,</p>
<p>may a burning desire arise within us to unite ourselves with Jesus,</p>
<p>in sacramental communion,</p>
<p>and then to bring His love to life into our lives,</p>
<p>loving others as He loved us.</p>
<p>All remain in silence for 5 minutes for a heart-to-heart conversation with Jesus Christ. A hymn of thanksgiving may be sung.</p>
<p>All stand.</p>
<p>The leader says the closing prayer, in the name of all:</p>
<p>Through the intercession of St. N.</p>
<p>[patron saint of the parish, diocese or country],</p>
<p>and of all the saints of God,</p>
<p>May the God of perseverance and courage</p>
<p>grant us to manifest throughout our lives</p>
<p>the spirit of sacrifice, compassion and love</p>
<p>of Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>Thus, in the communion of the Holy Spirit,</p>
<p>we will give glory to God,</p>
<p>the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p>for ever and ever!</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>FINAL BLESSING</p>
<p>All together facing the cross, each with their hands joined in prayer, invoke the Lord’s Blessing:</p>
<p>May the Lord let his face shine upon us</p>
<p>and come and save us. Amen.</p>
<p>All make the Sign of the Cross.</p>
<p>Then parents may trace the Sign of the Cross on their children’s foreheads.</p>
<p>To conclude the celebration, one of the following Marian antiphons may be sung, or some other familiar hymn to the Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>Ave, Regina cælorum</p>
<p>Ave, Domina Angelorum,</p>
<p>Salve radix, salve, porta, Ex qua mundo lux est orta.</p>
<p>Gaude, Vírgo gloriosa, Super omnes speciosa;</p>
<p>Vale, o valde decora</p>
<p>Et pro nobis Christum exora.</p>
<p>Hail, Queen of Heaven!</p>
<p>Hail, sovereign of the angels!</p>
<p>Hail, root of Jesse!</p>
<p>Hail, door through which the Light of the world arose.</p>
<p>Rejoice, glorious Virgin, who prevails over all in beauty!</p>
<p>Hail, O most beautiful one,</p>
<p>and pray to Christ for us.</p>

<p>To continue to sanctify this Sunday, it would be good to reconnect with the venerable tradition of Sunday vespers by celebrating, towards the end of the afternoon, the office of the Liturgy of the Hours that you will find here, or we can take this Sunday’s Evening Prayer, which can be found here.</p>
<p>You can also take a quarter of an hour in a quiet place to meditate on the Gospel of Palm Sunday while contemplating an Icon.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>For Holy Week, we will offer you increasingly rich formulas, to help you continue to celebrate, despite everything, the special seasons of our Christian life, for the glory of God and the salvation of the world.</p>

<h3 id="defiant-pastors-vow-to-host-palm-sunday-mass-during-coronavirus-pandemic">Defiant pastors vow to host Palm Sunday mass during coronavirus pandemic</h3>
<p><img src="https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/tony_spell.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="img">
Defiant Christian megachurches across the country have vowed to flout social distancing guidelines and host Palm Sunday mass — with one Texas pastor complaining that “Satan’s trying to keep us apart.”</p>
<p>While most churches will host online-only services for the holiday, a few renegade pastors in Ohio, Texas, Louisiana, Florida and California have made it clear they are hoping to pack their churches with congregants, and global coronavirus pandemic be damned.</p>
<p>“We’re defying the rules because the commandment of God is to spread the Gospel,” said Louisiana pastor Tony Spell.</p>
<p>Spell, 42, plans to hold three services at his 1,000-member Life Tabernacle megachurch in a Baton Rouge suburb on Palm Sunday. He’s already received six misdemeanors for defying state orders against assembling in large groups.</p>
<p>The pastors claim the lockdowns infringe on their religious rights.</p>
<p>“Satan’s trying to keep us apart, he’s trying to keep us from worshipping together. But we’re not going to let him win,” Kelly Burton, pastor at Lone Star Baptist Church in Lone Star, Texas, wrote in a post on Facebook.</p>
<p>The church has been searching for creative ways around the state’s orders against convening in groups larger than 10 people and has been hosting mass in its parking lot — services it calls “Church on the Lot.” It plans to do so again for Palm Sunday.</p>
<p>The Ohio megachurch Solid Rock, which has been hosting 1,000-person masses, plans to open its doors for holiday service, as well.</p>
<p>The church said it would offer a “scaled back” service.</p>
<p>“Fortunately, our facility is large enough that we are able to easily ensure that everyone who is physically in the facility is practicing the physical distancing; we are providing additional cleaning and hand sanitizing stations; and we are holding some services outside to allow for more distance.”</p>
<p>Although Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s mandatory “stay at home” order excluded churches, he scolded pastors on Saturday for continuing with mass, the Journal-News reported.</p>
<p>“Any pastor who brings people together in close proximity to each other, a large group of people, is making a huge mistake,” DeWine said. “It is not a Christian thing to do.”</p>
