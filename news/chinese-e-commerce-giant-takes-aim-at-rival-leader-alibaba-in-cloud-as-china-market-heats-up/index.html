JD.com is one of the biggest e-commerce and logistics company in China. Zhang Peng | LightRocket | Getty Images</p>
<p>BEIJING – JD.com, a major Chinese e-commerce company, is looking to become the technology platform of choice for U.S. customers in a cloud computing market dominated by Alibaba. JD is best known in China for its claim to one-day or next-day delivery service, which helped drive a year-on-year increase of 18.6% to 362 million annual active customer accounts in 2019. Bernstein analysts also upgraded the stock to &ldquo;outperform&rdquo; on March 17, noting how JD&rsquo;s in-house logistics network kept operating throughout the Lunar New Year and the coronavirus&rsquo; hit to the economy. The Beijing-based company is now trying to build on that delivery and retail network with a new line of business in technology services, which covers logistics, advertising and cloud computing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From last year, our new clear direction at JD was to serve the company based on the foundation of supply chain (development),&rdquo; Bowen Zhou, chair of JD&rsquo;s technology committee and president of JD Cloud &amp; AI, said in an interview with CNBC on March 20. That&rsquo;s according to a CNBC translation of his Mandarin-language remarks. &ldquo;When we look at the direction of our future operations, technology and services is a core engine of growth,&rdquo; Zhou said. Development of those products and services will also help JD achieve its international goals. Zhou said JD aims to work with Fortune 500 companies that want to grow their operations in China, as well as help U.S. and European technology companies&rsquo; products enter China.</p>
<p>Competition in cloud</p>
<p>At least in cloud computing, it&rsquo;s a tough road ahead as JD isn&rsquo;t even close to having the same market share as Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu have, according to Canalys analysis published March 18. China is the world&rsquo;s second-largest market for cloud infrastructure services, of which Alibaba Cloud accounts for 46.4% of total spend, followed by Tencent Cloud at 18% and Baidu AI Cloud at 8.8%, as of the fourth quarter, the analysis showed. For all of last year, cloud infrastructure services spend in China increased 63.7% to top $10.7 billion, according to Canalys. But JD is seeing growth. Net revenues from services surged 43.6% in the fourth quarter to 20.97 billion yuan ($3 billion), faster than the 24.5% growth in the albeit far greater sum of 149.7 billion yuan in net product revenues.</p>
<p>Zhou stressed that for JD, technology services sold to clients are based on applications for the company&rsquo;s own operations, and cover artificial intelligence, big data, cloud, devices and &ldquo;exploration&rdquo; of new applications. JD Cloud and AI officially became one of the company&rsquo;s major business lines on March 5, joining JD Retail, JD Logistics and JD Digits, highlighting the emphasis this company is putting on the segment. JD Logistics broke even last year on an operating income basis, while JD Digits is a research and fintech arm that was spun-off in 2017. Some businesses are already betting on JD&rsquo;s mix of technology, retail and supply chain systems. JD.com is backed by technology giant Tencent, and the online retailer received a $550 million investment from Google in 2018. JD also has a strategic alliance with Walmart, which invested $500 million together with JD in the Chinese company&rsquo;s affiliate Dada, which runs an online fresh produce delivery platform. For Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu, their stakeholders are primarily investment firms, according to public records.</p>

<h3 id="jack-ma-foundation-and-alibaba-foundation-donation-arrives-in-laos-to-combat-covid-19">Jack Ma Foundation and Alibaba Foundation Donation Arrives in Laos to Combat Covid-19</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png" alt="img">
Total donation recipient countries in Asia increased to 23</p>
<p>Covid-19 test kits donated by the Jack Ma Foundation and the Alibaba Foundation arrived in Vientiane at Wattay International Airport on Saturday March 28. They will be distributed across the country by the Ministry of Health of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR).</p>
<p>Dr Boufeng Phoummalaysith, Vice Minister of Health of the Lao People&rsquo;s Democratic Republic (PDR), took receipt of the donation in a ceremony at the Ministry’s office today. Also present to witness this private philanthropic initiative were Mr. Wang Qihui, Counselor of the Economic and Commercial Office of the Chinese Embassy in Laos, and senior government officials of the Lao PDR, including Mr. Somchith Inthamith, Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce, and Ms. Phongsamouth Anlavan, Acting Director General Asia Pacific and Africa Department.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hope this donation will help Laos in the battle against Covid-19. It is a challenge to source and transport medical supplies to where it is needed the most, but we are working hard to get it done,&rdquo; said the Jack Ma Foundation.</p>
<p>The donation to Laos is part of the two foundations’ pledge to deliver medical supplies to 10 Asian countries announced on March 21. These 10 countries include Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Maldives, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Collectively, the 10 nations will receive a total of 1.8 million masks, 210,000 test kits and 36,000 units of protective clothing, as well as essential medical equipment that include ventilators and forehead thermometers.</p>
<p>To date, the two Foundations have donated medical supplies to 23 Asian countries totaling 7.4 million masks; 485,000 test kits; 100,000 sets of protective clothing along with other medical equipment.</p>
<p>These donations are among a number of aid initiatives from the Jack Ma Foundation and Alibaba Foundation to support the areas of the world most affected by the Covid-19 crisis. This includes sourcing and delivering various types of medical supplies to countries and regions across Asia, North America, Latin America, Europe and Africa.</p>
<p>The Foundations have published and distributed a handbook detailing learnings and best practices from the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, for treating Covid-19 patients: <a href="https://covid-19.alibabacloud.com/">https://covid-19.alibabacloud.com/</a></p>
<p>More initiatives and donations are expected to be announced over the coming days and weeks.</p>

<h3 id="alibaba-explains-development-of-facial-biometric-access-control-system-for-people-wearing-masks">Alibaba explains development of facial biometric access control system for people wearing masks</h3>
<p><img src="https://d1sr9z1pdl3mb7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/30121812/alibaba.jpg" alt="img">
Alibaba has trained an “eye recognition” algorithm along with a mask detection model to perform biometric identification of people wearing respiratory masks, in a process the company has detailed in a blog post.</p>
<p>When government officials put “Ten Strict” control measures into place in Hangzhou city’s Yuhang district on February 3 to prevent the spread of COVID-19, officials were faced with the challenge of how to monitor and enforce a limitation on people leaving their homes to purchase necessities. With most entry and exit records maintained manually, errors and omissions could render the measures ineffective. An automatic access management record with facial recognition, however, would have to identify individuals wearing masks.</p>
<p>The Alibaba Cloud Intelligent database vector team developed the technology, and provided it for free to certain organizations.</p>
<p>During the feature extraction portion of the registration process, two different sets of features are captured; one for the full face, and one for the area around the eyes and forehead. In testing on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, the company’s AnalyticDB eye recognition algorithm scored 99.18 percent accuracy. It also scored 93.4 percent against the cfp_fp dataset, and 94.2 percent matching the agedb dataset. Mask detection is performed prior to facial recognition, so that the correct feature set can be matched.</p>
<p>The system performs vector searches, which is supported by both AnalyticDB for MySQL and AnalyticDB for PostgreSQL. The company says that in real-world applications, AnalyticDB can respond to queries of billion of vector data entries within 100 milliseconds. It is used in security projects in multiple cities. Alibaba provides facial recognition for Shanghai’s smart city system.</p>
<p>The facial recognition and eye recognition, and mask detection models, as well as the community resident management solution have all been made open-source by Alibaba, and the company has provided the systems and the AnalyticDB database engine free of charge to organizations running access management applications in support of pandemic containment.</p>
