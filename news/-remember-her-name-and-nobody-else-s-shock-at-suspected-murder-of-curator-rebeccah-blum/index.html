<p>Blum: © and courtesy of Emma Blum. Fletcher: © the artist</p>
<p>Rebeccah Blum, a noted arts curator, and Saul Fletcher, a British photographer, have died in Berlin. Although it has not yet been officially verified, multiple media sources reported Blum, 53, was murdered by Fletcher, 52, at his Berlin flat. He is believed to have subsequently committed suicide at Blum’s country home in Brandenburg, west of Berlin. Their bodies were discovered on 22 July.</p>
<p>Fletcher, whose friends say suffered from serious mental health issues, and Blum had been in an on-off relationship for many years. Berlin authorities confirmed that they are not seeking anyone else in conjunction with the case, and Blum&rsquo;s daughter confirmed her mother&rsquo;s death on social media.</p>
<p>Blum, the mother of two children, was born in 1967 and was raised close to Philadelphia. She studied art history in Washington DC before moving to San Francisco to work in an art gallery, supporting herself with restaurant work.</p>
<p>Blum moved to the German city of Düsseldorf in 1992, at the age of 25, before settling in Berlin in 1995, where she co-founded the non-profit arts organisation Base e.V. and the independent publishing platform txt.de. Blum became a director of the ScheiblerMitte gallery Aurel Scheibler in 2007 before founding her own art management firm, Blum Fine Art Management. As a freelancer, she supported the Berlin office of publisher Verlag der Kunst amid countless other projects.</p>
<p>The Berlin-based Mexican artist Julieta Aranda, a friend and colleague, says in an Instagram post that she pays tribute to Blum on behalf of the Berlin artistic community. Aranda remembers “a woman with a name, a profession, a rich life and a precious smile that we want to share with everyone. We are here to express our condolences and sorrow, to pay respect to her achievements and to honour her memory, as the brilliant woman she was and as a dear friend for many. We want to recall her name, and firmly condemn the brutality that took her life away, a too well known violence that needs to stop.”</p>
<p>Emma Blum, 22, one of Rebeccah’s two daughters, used Instagram to remember a committed mother, a ceaselessly inventive cook and an adventurous and enthusiastic lover of life “who supported me through every crisis, who raised me and loved me unconditionally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love her so much and I miss her so terribly,” Blum’s daughter wrote. “She was just taken from me, without warning and in such a violent way by one of the people she loved. I can never forgive this and I can never forget this. I want her name to be remembered and nobody else’s.”</p>
<p>Fletcher was born in 1967 to a working class family in the village of Barton-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire, and spent his early adulthood ferrying coal on cargo ships in Hull harbour. His earliest photographs, made after he joined an amateur photography club, were of North Lincolnshire&rsquo;s docks.</p>
<p>After moving to London in the early 1990s, he set up a makeshift studio in Crouch End and began to explore a form of carefully constructed portraiture, of himself and others. He supported himself by assisting the photographer Juergen Teller.</p>
<p>Fletcher moved to Berlin around the turn of the millennium. Those close to him remembered a warm but erratic man who often seemed happy and content but, at the depths of depression, would rarely leave the confines of his home or studio, where much of his work was created.</p>
<p>Most of his photographs used the walls of his studio as a canvas or backdrop for self-portraits. He would arrange found objects, vegetation, dead animals, Polaroids, paintings, drawings or pages torn from his notebooks, before photographing the composition, or himself in the midst of the composition, with an obsessive repetition.</p>
<p>After gaining representation from New York’s Anton Kern Gallery, Fletcher gained critical recognition for shows at London’s Courtauld Gallery; the Atlanta Contemporary Art Center; the Hessel Museum of Art, New York; MUMOK, Vienna; and the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, among others. He gained some populist fame for his visual work for the London-based alt rock band Placebo and, recently, a friendship with the actor Brad Pitt.</p>
<p>Fletcher’s last solo exhibition, titled Four Loom Weave, went on show at Anton Kern Gallery, New York, in Autumn 2018. Fletcher told the Financial Times at the time: &ldquo;I use whatever I have to hand, trying to create something, trying to make something good out of something bad.”</p>
<p>Fletcher’s most recent artwork, titled Don’t Let the Darkness Get You Down, is part of the exhibition Untitled 2020 on show at Punta della Dogana, Venice, until 13 December 2020.

<p><img src="https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/AP_080911011155.jpg?w=1024" alt="img">
Editor’s Note: ARTnews has issued an apology to the family of Rebeccah Blum regretting that the original version of this article covering the shocking news of Blum’s murder hadn’t been more respectful of her and her many accomplishments. Read a separate obituary of Blum, published on July 29, 2020, here.</p>
<p>Saul Fletcher, a British-born, Berlin-based artist, is the subject of an investigation “on the suspicion of murder” of Rebeccah Blum, a well-regarded Berlin-based curator who was found dead last week before Fletcher reportedly committed suicide. Blum’s death was confirmed this week by her daughter, Emma Blum.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to ARTnews, a spokesperson for the Berlin Public Prosecutor’s Office confirmed the news. The statement added, “According to the present state of knowledge, [Fletcher] first killed the woman you named [Rebeccah Blum] and then committed suicide. Investigations into the causes of death and the circumstances of the crime are still ongoing.”</p>
<p>The spokesperson did not provide further details about the investigation, including those that have been circulating in the press surrounding the story, which was first reported by the Daily Mail.</p>
<p>Rebeccah Blum, who was in a romantic relationship with Fletcher, was a well-regarded independent curator in Berlin. She had previously worked as director at ScheiblerMitte, an outpost of Berlin’s Aurel Scheibler gallery. She also ran a fine art management services, Blum Fine Art Management, and an editing service focused on German-to-English translation, Wordsmith. She also worked for over 10 years as the European representative for David Nolan Gallery in New York. Read a full obituary for Blum.</p>
<p>“I love her so much and I miss her so terribly,” Emma Blum, her daughter, wrote on Instagram. “She was just by taken from me, without warning and in such a violent way by one of the people she loved. I can never forgive this and I can never forget this. I want her name to be remembered and nobody else’s.”</p>
<p>The three galleries that represented Fletcher at the time of his death—Anton Kern Gallery in New York, Knust Kunz Gallery Editions in Munich, and Grice Bench in Los Angeles—provided to ARTnews a joint statement regarding the reports: “We are devastated, appalled, and shocked by the tragic loss of Rebeccah Blum and Saul Fletcher. We are all grief-stricken and confused. We offer our deepest condolences to their families and together are offering our support and help.”</p>
<p>Fletcher first came to prominence in the late 1990s when he began showing with New York’s Anton Kern Gallery. His work has appeared in major international exhibitions as well, including the 30th Bienal de São Paulo in 2012, the 4th Berlin Biennale in 2006, and the 2004 Carnegie International in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Update, July 30, 2020: This article has been updated to include a statement from the Berlin Public Prosecutor’s Office confirming that Saul Fletcher is a suspect in the investigation into Rebeccah Blum’s murder.

<p><img src="https://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/E00E5D8D-E329-45DD-BEF0-3A1903924E30-e1596057278854.jpeg" alt="img">
Rebeccah Blum, a curator, translator, editor, and mother, died in Berlin on July 22. She was murdered by her former partner, British-born photographer Saul Fletcher, who subsequently committed suicide at Blum’s country home. Blum was 53 years old.</p>
<p>Born in 1967, Blum grew up outside of Philadelphia. In 1985 she headed to American University in Washington, DC, to study art history under feminist luminaries like Norma Broude and Mary Garrard, who cemented her interest in gender parity in the art world. After completing her studies, Blum worked at an art gallery and various restaurants in San Francisco.</p>
<p>In 1992, she relocated to Düsseldorf. Three years later, she moved to Berlin where she co-founded and chaired arts non-profit art Base e.V., a rhizomatic entity that held online exhibitions as early as 1995. In 1997, Blum played an integral role in the formation of txt.de, a marketing platform for independent publishers. The ethos of these projects reflected her belief in non-hierarchical collaboration and her penchant for curatorial experimentation and play, not to mention her prescience.</p>
<p>Blum became a director at Berlin-based gallery Aurel Scheiblerin 2007. At the gallery’s ScheiblerMitte outpost, she curated and co-curated several exhibitions, including a show of work by French-American video artist Michel Auder in 2009. She went on to co-found and direct SATELLITE BERLIN, a nonprofit platform committed to forging fruitful connections between artists and scientists, and launched her own eponymous art management firm, Blum Fine Art Management. Blum, who was fully bilingual in German and English, simultaneously built a career as a freelance editor and translator. She worked on monographs, exhibition catalogues, magazines, and more for Anton Kern Gallery, David Noland Gallery, and Hatje Cantz, among other clients. Blum returned to school in 2017 for a Master’s in Management of Cultural and Nonprofit Organizations at University of Kaiserslautern. She graduated this June and was gearing up for a new chapter professionally. Blum was also in the process of writing a book about the art world, her 22-year-old daughter Emma told Hyperallergic.</p>
<p>“She was the most animated person,” Emma continued. “When she told a story, she would get up from the table to gesture with her hands — she told it with her whole body.” Emma described an exuberant woman, someone who laughed easily, made jar after jar of chutney and marmalade, packed her house with art, and was surrounded by friends. Fletcher, Emma explained, was her mother’s on-and-off partner for eight years before he killed Blum and himself.</p>
<p>Posts commemorating Blum have been circulating on Instagram — an effort that is imperative in light of the coverage of her death, pieces that have glossed over her personhood to instead laud Fletcher’s art career or sensationalize his personal connections.</p>
<p>Berlin-based gallery ChertLüdde captioned an image of a beaming Blum, “She was a beautiful person who dearly deserves to be remembered as such, a Woman with a name, a profession, a rich life and a precious smile that we want to share with everyone.” The caption went on to express that the gallery “firmly condemn[ed] the brutality that took her life away, a too well known violence that needs to stop.”</p>
<p>Jane Rosenzweig, a close friend of Blum’s since their freshman year of college, portrayed Blum as someone who loved beautiful things, the type of person to pack a picnic on a whim. “Everyone felt this magnetic pull toward her because she was so special, so loving, so curious. She wanted to understand everything; that’s how she was in every interaction,” she told Hyperallergic. “We can’t measure what we’ve lost.”

<h3 id="rebeccah-blum-well-regarded-berlin-based-independent-curator-is-dead">&ldquo;Rebeccah Blum, Well-Regarded Berlin-Based Independent Curator, Is Dead&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Rebeccah-Blum.jpg?w=1024" alt="img">
Rebeccah Blum, an independent curator based in Berlin who ran a namesake art management firm, has died. The news was confirmed by her daughter Emma Blum in an Instagram post.</p>
<p>In her Instagram post, Emma Blum wrote, “I want to take a moment to talk about my mom. Rebeccah. The person who supported me through every crisis, who raised me and loved me unconditionally. The amazing cook, who could open the fridge and magically make a dish out of something nobody would ever expect to taste good. Who, when she told a story, would sometimes get up, gesturing all over the place, so animated and excited in what she had to tell. I miss her silly ways and the conversations we had in the evening while cooking together. She taught me card tricks and games, took me to the forest to go mushroom hunting.”</p>
<p>Emma Blum’s post continued, “I love her so much and I miss her so terribly. She was just by taken from me, without warning and in such a violent way by one of the people she loved. I can never forgive this and I can never forget this. I want her name to be remembered and nobody else’s.”</p>
<p>Rebeccah Blum was found dead last week. Several media outlets reported the death as a murder-suicide committed by British-born photographer Saul Fletcher. In a statement sent to ARTnews, a spokesperson for the Berlin Public Prosecutor’s Office confirmed the news. The statement added, “According to the present state of knowledge, [Fletcher] first killed the woman you named [Rebeccah Blum] and then committed suicide. Investigations into the causes of death and the circumstances of the crime are still ongoing.”</p>
<p>Rebeccah Blum was well-known in the Berlin art scene. Prior to starting her Berlin-based firm, Blum Fine Art Management, she had been a director at ScheiblerMitte gallery in Berlin (an adjunct exhibition space of Aurel Scheibler in the downtown area of the German capital), joining the enterprise when it opened its space in the city in 2006. Among the exhibitions mounted at ScheiblerMitte, which staged its last presentation in 2011, were solo shows of work by Joe Zucker, Anthony Goicolea, and Michel Auder. Oftentimes, the exhibitions were the artists’ first in Berlin. She also worked on the gallery’s production of its exhibition catalogues and contributed texts on the work of Ad Reinhardt, Alice Neel, and others.</p>
<p>Among Blum’s curatorial credits at ScheiblerMitte was a 2009 group exhibition titled “Shadow/Existence” that Blum organized with Jennifer Bork. The show included work by Jonathan Bragdon, Tom Chamberlain, Öyvind Fahlström, Neil Gall, Nico Glaenzel, Mark Lombardi, Alexander Schellow, David Schutter, Jorinde Voigt, and Michael Wutz.</p>
<p>In the press release to the “Shadow/Existence,” Blum and Bork wrote, “[Chaos and order] alternate rhythmically yet form a whole that refers to the ambivalence of all that is. ‘Shadow/Existence’ addresses this ambivalence in its notion of presence and absence. Oneʼs own shadow cannot exist alone but requires a source of light and an object. It is not representational and not present yet carries the trace of presence within.”</p>
<p>Blum also operated Wordsmith, an editing service focused on German-to-English translation and the production of texts in those two languages. According to the company’s website, clients included the Goethe Institute, Satellite Berlin, the Vitra Design Museum, and the publisher Hatje Cantz, for which she translated some of the essays for an exhibition catalogue of Stephan von Huene.</p>
<p>Blum also worked as the European representative for New York’s David Nolan Gallery for over 10 years. During her tenure at David Nolan, she helped coordinate exhibitions with the gallery’s Europe-based artists at the New York location and worked in the gallery’s art fair booths.</p>
<p>In an email to ARTnews, the gallery’s owner, David Nolan, said, “Rebeccah excelled at explaining art to clients and curators. She was a great communicator and a very warm person that always put the artists and clients at ease. I could trust her totally to choose works from an artist’s studio and make studio visits and liaise for me with dealers and others in our complicated contemporary art world.”</p>
<p>Nolan said that one of the artists whom Blum introduced him to was Berlin-based artist Jorinde Voigt, whom he first met in 2009 and has represented for around 10 years. Nolan subsequently included Voigt in the gallery’s summer exhibition in 2010 and has since mounted six solo shows of Voigt’s work, including one this past spring.</p>
<p>Nolan added, “I will remember her for her honesty, humor, and intelligence. A lovely person who was the most loyal friend one can be fortunate enough to know.”</p>
<p>Update, 7/30/20 2:05 p.m.: This article has been updated to include confirmation from the Berlin Public Prosecutor’s Office that Blum is believed to have been murdered by artist Saul Fletcher.

Art Industry News is a daily digest of the most consequential developments coming out of the art world and art market. Here’s what you need to know on this Tuesday, July 28.</p>
<p>NEED-TO-READ</p>
<p>Artist Saul Fletcher and Curator Rebeccah Blum Die in Apparent Murder-Suicide – The Berlin-based artist and freelance curator died last week in an apparent murder-suicide. According to local media, Fletcher’s daughter called police to report that he had confessed to the murder of a woman who is believed to be curator and former Aurel Scheibler director Rebeccah Blum. (Blum’s identity has not been confirmed by law enforcement, but was affirmed by Fletcher’s galleries.) Fletcher was later found dead on his property just outside Berlin. He was represented by Anton Kern, Grice Bench in Los Angeles, and Knust Kunz Gallery in Munich at the time of his death. (ARTnews)</p>
<p>Debate Erupts Online Over the Met’s Labeling of a Religious Artifact – The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York posted what it described as “a sixth-century amulet from Egypt” on Twitter over the weekend. But some followers say it is in fact a piece of tefillin, the leather boxes and straps used in Jewish prayer, and are asking for a correction. The debate has sparked conversation about how museums catalogue religious objects; the Met has not yet commented on the matter. (Jewish Telegraphic Agency)</p>
<p>A Report Says the Trade of Illicit Antiquities Has Been Overstated – A new report from the American research organization RAND suggests that the actual size of the trade in illicit antiquities may be “much smaller” than widely believed. Perhaps more controversially, the report blames “bloggers, journalists and advocacy groups” who pen sensational headlines for perpetuating the distortion. ln a recent op-ed on Artnet News, antique trade organization head Erika Bochereau argued that a recent study into the illicit trade of antiquities in Germany was based more on suspicion rather than scientific research. (The Art Newspaper)</p>
<p>French Photographers Petition Macron for Relief Measures – More than 400 photographers and photojournalists have signed an open letter urging French president Emmanuel Macron to launch specific measures to aid the sector in the wake of a speech in May in which he pledged to inaugurate a major program of public commissions. The signatories are calling for a kind of “photographic new deal” to employ photographers to document France during this historic moment. (TAN)</p>

<p>Uccello Painting Sold Under Duress Heads to Sotheby’s – A work by Italian Renaissance artist Paolo Uccello is heading to Sotheby’s “From Rembrandt to Richter” sale with an estimate of £600,000 and £800,000. Battle on the Banks of a River belonged to the Jewish collector Friedrich Gutmann, who died in a concentration camp in 1944. The profits of the sale will be split, as per an agreement, between Gutmann’s heirs and the new owners of the painting, who bought it unaware of its dark past. (Guardian)</p>
<p>Phillips’s Editions Sale Nets $5.4 Million – Phillips’s editions and works on paper sale raked in $5.4 million across 232 lots. The top seller was Pablo Picasso’s Portrait de jeune fille, d’après Cranach le Jeune (Portrait of a Young Woman, After Cranach the Younger), which sold for $590,000 after a competition among four bidders. (Art Market Monitor)</p>
<p>Eva Chimento Closes Her Gallery – Los Angeles’s Chimento Contemporary will close after five years in business and 45 exhibitions. Owner Eva Chimento will join Telluride Gallery of Fine Art in Colorado as director. (Press release)</p>

<p>Police Confiscate Roman Vases Found in Seafood Shop – Spanish authorities have seized 13 Roman amphorae from a seafood shop in Alicante.

<h3 id="nobody-asked-for-this-all-the-tv-and-movie-reboots-and-sequels-of-2020">&ldquo;Nobody asked for this: All the TV and movie reboots and sequels of 2020&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/08/reboots-index.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="img">
Everything old is new again — but is it fresh?</p>
<p>Hollywood has announced an excessive amount of reboots, re-imaginings, revivals, sequels and spinoffs — but only time will tell if they’ll offer anything new.</p>
<p>Each week, it seems, bring news of another revival, from nostalgic ’90s cartoons such as “Beavis and Butt-Head” to ’80s sleeper hits including “Dirty Dancing.”</p>
<p>The coronavirus has delayed many of the productions, so it might be a while before any of them hit the small and big screens. In the meantime, here’s an exhaustive list of everything slated to make a comeback soon, whether we asked for it or not.</p>
<p>Movies</p>
<ol>
<li>“Dirty Dancing”</li>
</ol>
<p>Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer called this sequel “one of the worst kept secrets in Hollywood,” after rumors first swirled in July. Jennifer Grey has been confirmed to star in the new movie, which will be directed by Jonathan Levine. “It will be exactly the kind of romantic, nostalgic movie that the franchise’s fans have been waiting for and that have made it the biggest-selling library title in the company’s history,” Feltheimer said.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>“Twister”</li>
</ol>
<p>Universal Pictures is rebooting “Twister” with “Top Gun: Maverick” helmer Joseph Kosinski set to direct. Not much else is known about the reboot of the 1996 blockbuster, which stars Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>“Scarface”</li>
</ol>
<p>Say hello to another remake. “Call Me By Your Name” director Luca Guadagnino will take on the “Scarface” remake, the fourth director to attempt the project, with a script by the Coen brothers. So far, there’s no word on who will play Tony Montana, but Guadagnino said it will be a modern-set remake.</p>
<p>“The truth of the matter is cinema has been remaking itself throughout its existence. It’s not because it’s a lazy way of not being able to find original stories. It’s always about looking at what certain stories say about our times,” he told Variety. “Hopefully ours, 40-plus years later, will be another worthy reflection on a character who is a paradigm for our own compulsions for excess and ambition. I think my version will be very timely.”</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>“Pirates of the Caribbean”</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s a pirate’s life for Margot Robbie, who will star in a female-led version of “Pirates of the Caribbean.” It’s still in the early development stages at Disney, so few details are available. However, there’s another “Pirates of the Caribbean” reboot in the works from Ted Elliott and “Chernobyl” creator Craig Mazin.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>“Don’t Tell Mom the Babysitter’s Dead”</li>
</ol>
<p>The 1991 cult classic is being reimagined with a present-day retelling centered on a black family. Treehouse Pictures will adapt the diverse remake, directed by Bille Woodruff, with a script from Chuck Hayward.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>“Scream”</li>
</ol>
<p>This one looks familiar. Both Courteney Cox and David Arquette are set to reprise their characters in yet another “Scream” film from Spyglass Media Group, directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>“Matilda”</li>
</ol>
<p>Ralph Fiennes is set to star as Miss Trunchbull in Netflix and Working Title’s movie “Matilda.” There are also rumors “Killing Eve” star Jodie Comer will be involved with the project, which is based on the stage musical adapted from the beloved Roald Dahl book. The streaming giant has plans in motion for many of the author’s other writings, including “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” “The BFG” and more.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>“Legally Blonde 3”</li>
</ol>
<p>Nearly two decades after Elle Woods graced the halls of Harvard, Reese Witherspoon will be back as sorority girl-turned-powerhouse lawyer, with Mindy Kaling and “Parks and Recreation” writer Dan Goor writing the screenplay.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>“Wolfman”</li>
</ol>
<p>Ryan Gosling will star in a new take on the cult classic horror, which is his own original pitch to Universal Studios. The script, set in present times, was penned by Lauren Schuker Blum and Rebecca Angelo based on Gosling’s idea. Leigh Whannell is rumored to direct the movie with Blumhouse producing.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>“Knight Rider”</li>
</ol>
<p>A present-day take on the 1980s classic action series, “Knight Rider” will now be a movie thanks to Spyglass Media Group and Atomic Monster’s James Wan and Michael Clear. No word on whether David Hasselhoff will be attached to the project.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>“Peter Pan”</li>
</ol>
<p>Disney is slated to remake its 1953 animated classic into yet another live-action remake from “Pete’s Dragon” director David Lowery — with Jude Law reportedly in talks to play Captain Hook. Milla Jovovich’s daughter Ever Anderson will play Wendy and Alexander Molony will star as Peter Pan.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>“Tron”</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t call it a sequel. Disney’s third “Tron” movie, which follows 1982 film “Tron” and the 2010 sequel “Tron: Legacy,” is set to star Jared Leto with Garth Davis to direct. It’s still in development, but the Wrap reported it won’t be a direct sequel to the films.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>“Pinocchio”</li>
</ol>
<p>Tom Hanks could potentially reunite with “Forrest Gump” director Robert Zemeckis for the live-action remake. The actor is said to be in talks to take on the role of Pinocchio’s toy creator, Geppetto.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>“Candyman”</li>
</ol>
<p>The upcoming reimagining of “Candyman” from director Nia DaCosta will revisit Chicago’s Cabrini-Green, exploring the gentrification of the housing projects seen in the original. The film’s release date has been delayed by the coronavirus, but is set to debut on Oct. 16, 2020.</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>“Bill &amp; Ted”</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s been delayed multiple times thanks to COVID-19, but “Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music” will bring back Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter as the titular characters this fall. The film will debut on premium video on demand and in select movie theaters on Sept. 1.</p>
<ol start="16">
<li>“American Pie”</li>
</ol>
<p>The film franchise is getting remade for Gen Z. The female-centric “Girls’ Rules,” which is slated for a digital release on October 6 before arriving on Netflix shortly after, will focus a group of seniors at East Great Falls who “decide to finally harness their girl power and band together to get what they want their last year of high school,” according to the synopsis.</p>
<p>TV</p>
<ol>
<li>“Ren &amp; Stimpy”</li>
</ol>
<p>Over two decades after ending, “The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show” is returning with all-new episodes on Comedy Central. Billy West, the voice of Stimpy, and several of the original writers are slated to return.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>“Animaniacs”</li>
</ol>
<p>Another blast from the past: A Steven Spielberg-produced reboot of “Animaniacs” is slated to premiere on Nov. 20 on Hulu with 13 new episodes. Yakko, Wakko and Dot, as well as Pinky and the Brain, will return for the show, which already was greenlit for a second season, set to premiere in 2021.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>“Beavis and Butt-Head”</li>
</ol>
<p>Comedy Central is Reboot Central. The network will debut “Beavis and Butt-Head” courtesy of original series creator Mike Judge, with two new seasons already ordered up. “It seemed like the time was right to get stupid again,” said Judge.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>“Daria” spinoff “Jodie”</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s more where that came from on Comedy Central, which will air “Jodie,” a spinoff of MTV’s iconic “Daria,” with Tracee Ellis Ross voicing the main character and executive producing. The show will begin with Jodie graduating from college and entering the workforce.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>“A League of Their Own”</li>
</ol>
<p>From big screen to small screen, Amazon has ordered a TV adaptation of “A League of Their Own” co-created and executive produced by “Broad City” alum Abbi Jacobson and Will Graham. Jacobson will also star in the hourlong series based on the early years of women’s professional baseball.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>“Who’s The Boss?”</li>
</ol>
<p>Tony Danza and Alyssa Milano have signed on to reprise their roles as father-daughter duo Tony and Samantha Micelli in this sequel, which is in development at Sony Pictures Television. It will take place 30 years after the events of the original series and center around Tony Micelli’s relationship with Samantha Micelli, now a single mother living in the original show’s house.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>“The Weakest Link”</li>
</ol>
<p>Say hello — not goodbye — to “Weakest Link,” hosted by Jane Lynch. The comeback is helmed by NBC, which greenlit 13 episodes. Production is slated to begin later this year. “I’ve been a longtime fan of this game-changing quiz show since it first debuted,” said Lynch. “Each time the phrase ‘You are the Weakest Link. Goodbye,’ passes my lips, it will be with great reverence and delight.”</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>“Saved by the Bell”</li>
</ol>
<p>A reboot of the beloved late ’80s sitcom is headed to NBC Universal’s Peacock streaming network. A new trailer confirmed some of the original cast members, including Mario Lopez and Elizabeth Berkley Lauren, will return to Bayside High as adults.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>“Chucky”</li>
