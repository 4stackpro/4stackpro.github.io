<p>Saturday Kitchen Live has been forced to explain itself as furious viewers moaned the show was not properly social distancing its guests.</p>
<p>The cooking show, which by its nature usually airs live on Saturday morning, today decided to run a pre-recorded episode featuring Girls Aloud star Kimberley Walsh, which was filmed before coronavirus lockdown guidance came into effect.</p>
<p>Host Matt Tebbutt told the camera: &ldquo;Good morning. Now before you settle down to watch this episode of Saturday Kitchen, we need you to know we recorded this show as an Easter treat before the lockdown, before government guidelines on how to stay safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saturday Kitchen is back live next Saturday and I&rsquo;ll be here live on BBC1 every weekday from 10am starting this Easter Monday with a brand new show, Daily Kitchen Live.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack Monroe will join me to help give you the most up-to-date advice on what to cook now to stay healthy and make the best possible tasty dishes. I hope you enjoy this show, and happy Easter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But despite Matt&rsquo;s warning, some sleepy-headed viewers were a little slow to catch on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was this show pre recorded or live?? Social distancing is clearly not in place here&hellip;..&rdquo; tweeted one at the show&rsquo;s official account.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just thinking this has bern filmed before the social distancing measures kicked in?&rdquo; said another.</p>
<p>A third demanded to know: &ldquo;Is this actually live? Or recorded pre social distancing???&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has #SaturdayKitchen given up on social distancing? Or is this a repeat?&rdquo; wrote another.</p>
<p>And a fifth commented: &ldquo;Whoever made this decision to broadcast this is an idiot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One joker replied: &ldquo;Absolutely, was watching Indiana Jones last night, defying the stay at home advice. Fuming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other viewers cottoned on straightaway, but felt the show had proved how much has changed in the last few weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tuned into @SaturdayKitchen a few minutes late &amp; thought it had all just been a terrible dream&hellip; Then I realised it was a pre-record from back in the glory days when we were allowed to be near each other. What a miserable realisation,&rdquo; one pointed out.</p>
<p>A weary Matt kept repeating throughout the show that there would be no live vote as the episode had been pre-recorded, meaning special guest Kimberley&rsquo;s food heaven or food hell would be &ldquo;decided by fate&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Matt will return to live cooking from Easter Monday, when he and Jack Monroe launch their very first Daily Kitchen show, which seeks to help those in lockdown discover new meals and kitchen tips.</p>
<p>The programme will air weekdays from 10-11am.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s latest venture with BBC marks a new chapter in her life as she moves on from her infamous legal battle with Katie Hopkins in 2017.</p>
<p>The aftermath of Jack&rsquo;s triumphant case saw Hopkins sell off her Â£1million Devon home and instead rent after the humiliating court case wiped out her finances.</p>
<p>*Saturday Kitchen Live returns next weekend at 10am on BBC1

Kimberley Walsh makes incredible Twix piÃ±ata cake for husband&rsquo;s birthday â see it here The Girls Aloud singer shared the recipe on her Instagram stories</p>
<p>Kimberley Walsh delighted fans on Thursday when she shared the recipe to her husband&rsquo;s favourite cake, which she was making to mark his birthday.</p>
<p>The singer filmed the whole process and showed it to her more than 600,000 followers via her Instagram stories over two days. On Wednesday, Kimberley baked the cake and on Thursday the mother-of-two decorated it - and we have to say, the end product looks amazing.</p>
<p>With the help of her youngest son Cole, Kimberley showed how she cut her cake in half, made cream cheese frosting for the inside, made chocolate icing and then decorated it using her husband Justin&rsquo;s favourite chocolate bar â Twix.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really easy birthday cake idea on my stories I made for Justin&rsquo;s birthday if anyone has a #lockdown birthday cake to make and needs some inspiration&hellip; Happy Birthday Daddy we love you more than cake,&rdquo; she captioned the picture of the finished treat.</p>
<p>Her celebrity friends were quick to congratulate the star on her baking abilities, with Alexandra Burke commenting: &ldquo;Love this!!!!&rdquo; and Olympic star Samantha Quek writing: &ldquo;Thatâs awesome!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>MORE: These are the best celebrity birthday cakes you&rsquo;ll ever see</p>
<p>Kimberley and the kids have been keeping themselves busy during the lockdown â and not only in the kitchen. On Wednesday, the singer shared a video which showed her and her two sons working out together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shout out to @thebodycoach for working out with us all every morning! This is pretty much how it goes down in our household, slightly chaotic yes but we get it done. Itâs great to have a bit of routine and something to focus on to set us up for the day. Especially on those days where I zero motivation but know I need to find some for the kids. Also love knowing my family and friends are all doing it at the same time @salsheps @joeshepp11 #pewithjoe #lockdown #stayhome.&rdquo;
