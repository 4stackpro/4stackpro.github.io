<p>Local fans of Fox TV’s Lego Masters competition show probably know that builders Tyler and Amy Clites have been demonstrating their creative flair and collaborative skills there for the past two months. The couple, who live in Myakka City, have weathered all sorts of on-air challenges, bringing them to the finale this coming Wednesday, April 15, at 9 p.m. as they attempt to gain the title of Lego Masters—along with the trophy and the $100,000 prize that comes with that distinction.</p>
<p>The shows were taped October through December, but we can’t tell you the final outcome. We did, however, talk to the couple about their Lego building approach and skills—and even gained a tip or two for those of you who may have more time at home on your hands than usual just now.</p>
<p>Tyler’s been building with Legos since he was 2 years old, turning especially serious as a teen; he now has a position of creative director with BuildBetterBricks.com, where he does product photography and works on instructions for those crafting their own Lego skills. But Amy says, “My husband definitely brought me into the Lego world” since they married a year and a half ago. (By the way, the two connected online through eHarmony before meeting in person on the bridge at Nathan Benderson Park for the first time; she’s from Lakewood Ranch and he’s from Brandon.) How do they work as a team?</p>
<p>“We are planners,” says Amy. “We love organization. We start bouncing ideas off each other; one might have the original spark. The idea is half the battle. Then we both break it down as to how we are going to build. On the show, you have a certain amount of time to create the challenge, so we also have to check in regularly on time to see where we stand.”</p>
<p>“It’s quite intense,” Tyler adds of the experience, “with a lot of cameras and lights and people asking you questions.” But, “We’re both able to focus under pressure,” says Amy.</p>

<p>Biggest challenge for the pair? “The megacity challenge,” says Tyler, “because we like things with personality and character, and it was hard for us to get passionate about buildings.” One of their favorites? “The storybook challenge,” Amy replies. “I was worn out by that time, but then we saw all the kids there [the show brings guests on during each episode). I work with kids in my piano studio at home, and that got my energy back up. That challenge gave us a lot of options for character designs.” Tyler also liked the “space smash” challenge, for which the couple created a green monster with tentacles. He was intrigued by the idea of “building something that ultimately would be destroyed,” he says.</p>
<p>Any suggestions for at-home builders? From Tyler: “Think outside the box and generate new ideas with the pieces that you have; use them in new ways. If you’re working as a pair or more, mash two words together like ‘scary’ and ‘food’…then imagine, what would scary food be?”</p>
<p>From Amy: “It can help creativity to put some limits on yourself. Maybe you set a two-hour time limit and decide to create something from ancient history”—for example, a pyramid or a Trojan horse.</p>
<p>And, in case you’re wondering if the stress of designing and building in competition under time constraints ever sparked any marital spats, the answer is a resounding no. “We were blessed to never have any arguments,” Tyler says. “We’re very like-minded and work well together.” Amy agrees. “We found how we complement each other’s strengths.” That’s a prescription not only for Legos but for married life.

<h3 id="lego-masters-portland-area-team-mark-and-boone-compete-in-a-star-wars-challenge-with-a-surprise-climax">‘Lego Masters’: Portland-area team Mark and Boone compete in a ‘Star Wars’ challenge with a surprise climax</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/-EckDIBBde5IkYI9i3RRKob3jR4=/1280x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-advancelocal.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HIQNGUIM3NBDJIDOX2U5KCES3E.jpg" alt="img">
Wednesday’s “Lego Masters” semifinal episode saw the remaining three teams, including the Portland area duo of Mark Cruickshank and Boone Langston, geek out over “Star Wars” themed challenges. But the general joy over creating builds inspired by the blockbuster science fiction franchise came with the pressure of knowing this competition would determine which teams would make it to next week’s finals, where the top team will win the $100,000 grand prize.</p>
<p>The “Star Wars” atmosphere was thick in the air, as the teams were asked to first build droids, and then to recreate memorable scenes from “Star Wars” movies. Adding to the “Star Wars” of it all were guest appearances by R2-D2, BB-8 and C-3PO.</p>
<p>As teams Mark and Boone, Sam and Jessica and Tyler and Amy set to work, Arnett checked in on how Mark, who’s from Oregon City, and Boone, who’s from Troutdale, were doing in their droid building. In what’s become a running theme, Arnett asked Boone if he had a droid song. Boone belted out a brief ditty that included the line, “These are not the droids you’re looking for.”</p>
<p>(How to watch: “Lego Masters” airs Wednesday nights at 9 p.m. on Fox. No cable or antenna? Live stream “Lego Masters” on Hulu + Live TV; you can also catch up with episodes you missed on Hulu)</p>
<p>Mark and Boone, who have done very well so far, seemed confident that their technical skills would serve them well, as they made motorized elements to give their droid motion. But the judges, Jamie Berard and Amy Corbett, were also looking for personality, and said they didn’t see much of that in Mark and Boone’s Imperial repair droid.</p>
<p>In the first challenge, Tyler and Amy won for their droid, who served blue milk and Wookiee cookies, and balanced a tray on its head. As winners of the challenge, Tyler and Amy got to have first choice from a selection of memorable scenes from “Star Wars” movies. The two chose the At-At Assault on Hoth, from “The Empire Strikes Back.”</p>
<p>Mark and Boone, who finished second in the first challenge, chose the Endor Imperial Bunker scene, from “Return of the Jedi.” Sam and Jessica decided on the Battle of Crait, from “The Last Jedi.”</p>
<p>With eight hours to make their builds, the teams went to work. Boone was nervous about their AT-ST Walker, and with good reason. As Boone was moving it, the AT-ST fell apart, and Boone and Mark scrambled at the last minute to re-assemble the AT-ST and complete their build.</p>
<p>All three teams did builds good enough to impress the judges. But when it was time to name the winner, Mark and Boone’s Endor Imperial Bunker was the top, as the judges praised its details, including the Ewoks’ simple weapons, and the “gorgeous” landscape work.</p>
<p>When it was time to name which two teams would move on to the finals, Arnett said that “Star Wars” fans have learned to love good surprises. This one? “Nobody is going home today!” he announced. Which wasn’t just a surprise, but good news for Tyler and Amy, who finished in the bottom, and would otherwise be out of there.</p>
<p>All three teams are moving on to next week’s final round, and the competition for the $100,000 grand prize and the title of Lego Masters.</p>

<p>If you’ve been following the reality show competition Lego Masters on Fox TV, you know that Myakka City couple Tyler and Amy Clites have fared well in the competition so far with their creative and complex Lego designs. We can’t tell you whether they make it to the finals next week, but we can tell you that they’re on tonight’s semifinals show (that’s today, Wednesday, April 8, at 9:01 p.m. EST on Fox), where host Will Arnett and guests BB-8, C-3PO and R2-D2 are challenging contestants to build their own droids and replicate iconic scenes inspired by—you guessed it—the Star Wars movie franchise.</p>
<p>And we’re planning to talk with the couple later this week about their love of Legos, their time spent on the show, and perhaps even offer a few tips for those of you building with Legos at home. Stay tuned.
