When the current season of Fortnite debuted, one of the most curious elements was the appearance of Deadpool. The Marvel anti-hero was present in various elements of the game — you could find him hidden away in a bathroom in the main battle pass menu — but you couldn’t actually play as him. That changes today, however, with the debut of a new Deadpool skin.</p>
<p>The skin is available to everyone who purchased this season’s battle pass, and it’s pretty easy to unlock; all you have to do is find two pistols hidden in the menu screens. Once you do that, simply head into a match and change into the Deadpool skin at any of the phone booths littered across the island.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s more to it than just the skin. There are other unlockables like Deadpool’s katanas, and there’s an alternate version of the costume with the mask removed. Perhaps the most fun addition, though, is that the yacht in the northeastern part of the map has been transformed into a Deadpool party boat, complete with giant balloons and a helicopter landing pad.</p>
<p>Deadpool is far from the first comic book character to make it into Epic’s long-running battle royale, joining the likes of the Avengers, Batman, and Harley Quinn. Today’s update is the first major addition to the Fortnite island since mid-March, when Epic added helicopters to the game, along with a much-welcome redesigned cosmetics locker.

<h3 id="deadpool-spotted-walking-the-streets-of-doncaster-village-to-spread-cheer-during-lockdown">&lsquo;Deadpool&rsquo; spotted walking the streets of Doncaster village to spread cheer during lockdown</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2-prod.examinerlive.co.uk/news/local-news/article18028447.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Deadpool-3.jpg" alt="img">
A man decided to dress up as Deadpool and walk around a Doncaster village to try and spread some cheer while residents are stuck inside during the coronavirus lockdown.</p>
<p>Dean Ashbridge has become a local celebrity in the village of Edlington as he has helped to put a smile on children&rsquo;s faces on his walks through the street.</p>
<p>The 45-year-old has lived there for 14 years and got the idea after somebody suggested it after he went to the shop in just his mask at first to raise a smile.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;I had actually been out to the shop in just my mask at first just to raise a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then somebody suggested dressing up as Deadpool for the kids, so I tried the first night to see what reaction I would get and it just exploded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had been building my suit a while and I was supposed to attend my first comic con which was cancelled so I thought why waste it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I use Deadpool just because he&rsquo;s just a little bit different to your average superhero and it appeals to my humour and personality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I started planning a route and people where asking me to visit their street so I kept going.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also draw pictures to hand out if possible for birthdays and such. I&rsquo;ve done a few messages to kids separated from their parents or kids upset they missed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Residents have been documenting pictures of Dean, also known as Dean Pool, on Facebook to show him walking through the streets waving and spreading cheer.</p>
<p>Dean added: &ldquo;The reaction had been more than I could imagine and its been a shock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do it because I use the local food bank and other facilities so just wanted to give a little back and it&rsquo;s my way of doing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I keep saying I will out there as long as the village want me to be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great feeling, I was a nursery nurse in the village and giving the kids something to do and look forward to is fun.&rdquo;
