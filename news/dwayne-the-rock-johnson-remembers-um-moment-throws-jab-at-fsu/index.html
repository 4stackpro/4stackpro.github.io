Dwayne Johnson has been removed from the Miami-Florida State rivalry for the past 26 years, but the former Hurricanes defensive tackle (1990-94) couldn&rsquo;t seem to help swiping at the Seminoles when the opportunity arose. Also known as &ldquo;The Rock,&rdquo; his ring name in the WWF and WWE, Johnson responded to a tweet Saturday afternoon that featured him sacking Florida State quarterback Charlie Ward on Oct. 9, 1993.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The moment when I silenced all 79,560 rabid Seminole fans by sacking Heisman Trophy winner, QB Charlie Ward,&rdquo; Johnson said in the tweet. &ldquo;It was also in this moment, Charlie decided he wanted to play in the NBA over the NFL. You&rsquo;re welcome, Knicks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yes, this was my only sack of the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the play, a 1st-and-10 at Miami&rsquo;s 39-yard line, Ward lines up out of the shotgun with two receivers to his right and one isolated left while two in the backfield flank him on each side. After backfield empties, Ward holds while looking for an open target, turning left at the wrong time as Johnson slams him head on, back into the Seminoles&rsquo; own territory.</p>
<p>Johnson and Miami fell 28-10 to Florida State at Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee, Florida, with the annual installment of the rivalry taking place via a noon kickoff on ABC. Under legendary head coach Bobby Bowden (1976-09), the Seminoles earned the 1993 national championship by going 12-1 and winning 18-16 over Nebraska in the Orange Bowl.</p>
<p>A two-sport star in basketball and football with the Seminoles from 1990-94, Ward won the 1993 Heisman Trophy, as Johnson alluded to. He took his talents to the NBA rather than the NFL, though, selected by the New York Knicks with the No. 26 overall pick in the 1994 NBA Draft.</p>
<p>A part of the 1990 recruiting class, Johnson chose Miami as a Freedom (Pa.) High product. He played defensive tackle from 1990-94, earning a national championship his sophomore season in 1991 when the Hurricanes went 12-0 under former head coach Dennis Erickson (1989-94) and won 22-0 over Nebraska to take the Orange Bowl.

<h3 id="the-rock-and-wwe-are-working-on-a-movie-about-ric-flair">The Rock and WWE are working on a movie about Ric Flair</h3>
<p><img src="https://s33079.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ric-Flair-The-Rock-scaled.jpg" alt="img">
Ric Flair was on Sirius XM’s Busted Open Radio this week to talk about his life and career and ESPN’s re-airing of his 30 for 30 special. The special will air on Sunday at 5:30 pm eastern as the lead-in to the WrestleMania 32 encore.</p>
<p>Dave Lagreca and Mark Henry put over Flair’s influence on them as they grew up as wrestling fans and Henry put over Flair’s influence on pop culture.</p>
<p>Henry said, “Ric I think that you should go down in history. This is another thing to add to your list of accolades. I think that you are probably the greatest crossover entertainer in the history of our planet. There’s nobody in music, nobody in Hollywood or pro wrestling, Olympic sports or professional sports that have touched more mediums at the same time than you have. Do you realize that?”</p>
<p>Flair says he is starting to realize that and that is why a movie is in the works on his life and career.</p>
<p>Flair said, “I’ve talked to Dwayne [Johnson] and Dany Garcia and Hiram Garcia and they’re gonna collaborate for all this stuff and make a movie with the WWE with me with Sue Levinson, who now is with WWE and is doing a fabulous job and Sue’s got a great background.” Flair continued, “As soon as everything gets rolling again, I’m going to make that movie. I am looking forward to that because I’ll have a lot of input and I’ve got a TV show coming out again when Hollywood gets going. This will actually come up first about my life in the 80s.”</p>
<p>Flair joked that the TV show about his life might not be suitable for prime time. He said, “It’ll probably come out at 1 in the morning, rated XXR. They told me the names will be changed to save the innocent … How do you fly to Tokyo in your robe and back, by Ric Flair…”</p>
<p>Flair was among the names that were scheduled to be brought in by WWE for WrestleMania weekend in Tampa. Plans have changed now due to restrictions on travel and social distancing. There is no word yet on when the Flair movie will be released but perhaps, we’ll hear more details once production starts.</p>

<h3 id="wwe-news-the-rock-reveals-what-he-whispered-to-stone-cold-steve-austin-following-wrestlemania-19-match">WWE News: The Rock Reveals What He Whispered To ‘Stone Cold’ Steve Austin Following ‘WrestleMania 19’ Match</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Steve-Austin-The-Rock.jpg" alt="img">
Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson recently posted a video on his official Instagram account where he discussed his legendary rivalry with “Stone Cold” Steve Austin. As quoted by Sportskeeda, Johnson discussed their three WrestleMania matches, and revealed what he whispered in Austin’s ear following their emotional encounter at WrestleMania 19.</p>
<p>According to Johnson, he told “The Texas Rattlesnake” how much he appreciated him for helping his own career throughout the years. He also said that the pair had an emotional moment between friends after Johnson hit his opponent with three Rock Bottoms. The match gave off the impression that both men were intense rivals, but Johnson’s words suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>“That moment, in front of 55,000 people, you can actually see me… when you watch it back. I’m sitting up, and I sit next to him, and he’s laying there in front of everybody. And I whispered to him, ‘I thank you so much for everything that you’ve done for me. And, I said ‘I love you.’ He said ‘I love you too.’ I hit him on the chest and I left, left him in the ring. That was it, he retired that night.”</p>
<p>The match marked the first time that Johnson ever beat his longtime rival at WWE’s biggest show of the year. While Austin’s retirement undoubtedly influenced the booking decision, it was a historic match in Johnson’s career as well. “The Rattlesnake” was forced to bow out of in-ring competition afterwards as the result of a neck injury, though he continues to make appearances as an on-air personality from time to time, and currently hosts his own show on the WWE Network.</p>
<p>The match also marked the end of an era for both men, as WWE’s Attitude Era was built around them and their rise to super stardom. Their paths frequently crossed and their feuds captivated the WWE Universe, so Johnson was an appropriate opponent for Austin’s swansong. Furthermore, they were still the biggest names in WWE at the time as well.</p>
<p>The chances of Austin returning to the ring are small, but Johnson might have another match in him. Even though he’s claimed that he’s retired, there have been rumors of him having a WrestleMania match against Roman Reigns at a future pay-per-view.</p>
<p>Both superstars are related in real life, so the familial element coupled with the cross-generation aspect would make for an iconic match in its own right. Now it remains to be seen if Johnson will be tempted to return.
