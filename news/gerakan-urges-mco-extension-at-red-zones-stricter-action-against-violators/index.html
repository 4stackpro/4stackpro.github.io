Gerakan president Datuk Dominic Lau speaks to the press during a press conference at the Bayan Baru Wet Market March 11, 2019. — Picture By Sayuti Zainudin</p>
<p>KUALA LUMPUR, April 23 — Gerakan president Datuk Dominic Lau Hoe Chai has urged Putrajaya to take sterner action against those who break the law under the movement control order (MCO) and to also extend the restrictions in red zone areas, if active cases are still reported on April 28.</p>
<p>This comes after a new cluster was reported in Pengerang, Johor where 15 people tested positive for Covid-19 yesterday and an increase in the number of people violating the MCO.</p>
<p>“The rate of recovery for Covid-19 patients is showing us that we have the virus under control as the percentage of those recovered is at 62.4 per cent as of yesterday.</p>
<p>“However, there are still active clusters in Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, Sarawak and Pahang, including 15 new cases in the Pengerang cluster.</p>
<p>“Due to this, we at Gerakan hope the government will consider stricter action against those who go against the MCO,” Dominic said in a statement this afternoon.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said a new cluster was discovered in Pengerang, where the index patient (first detected) was initially diagnosed with dengue.</p>
<p>He then decided to travel interstate to Selangor to visit relatives and friends before returning to Johor where his condition started to deteriorate.</p>
<p>He was then admitted to the hospital and is currently in critical state. Dr Noor Hisham advised Malaysians again not to travel or visit friends and relatives.</p>
<p>Earlier yesterday, Senior Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri said that the total number of people arrested for breaking MCO stood at 17,725, of which 1,236 have been charged in court.</p>
<p>Dominic said the increasing numbers of violators show that the government&rsquo;s efforts aren’t effective enough and better measures need to be made to stop people from going out during the MCO.</p>
<p>“The continued increase in MCO violators is something we must give serious consideration to. The government should find a more effective way to stop these people from flouting the law during phase three of the MCO.</p>
<p>“One of the ways we can do this is to stop these people from getting their Bantuan Prihatin Nasional money,” Dominic added.</p>
<p>Dominic also said Putrajaya should extend the MCO at all red zones if cases are still reported on April 28, which is the last day of the MCO.</p>
<p>“To avoid more clusters popping up, Gerakan proposes that the MCO be extended at all red zones, while those wanting to return to the city must adhere to the highest hygiene standards in order to avoid the virus from spreading again.”</p>

<h3 id="mco-extended-to-phase-4-april-29-to-may-12--pm">MCO extended to Phase 4, April 29 to May 12 – PM</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.paultan.org/image/2020/04/PM-Tan-Sri-Muhyiddin-Yassin-Bernama-1200x800.jpg" alt="img">
In Local News / By Anthony Lim / 23 April 2020 11:19 pm / 9 comments</p>
<p>On March 18, the government announced the implementation of a movement control order (MCO) in a bid to arrest the spread of the global pandemic known as Covid-19. In Malaysia, the move entailed movement restrictions and the closing of businesses except for those providing essential services. The MCO was initially set to end on March 31, but was extended to a stricter phase two on April 1, until April 14.</p>
<p>The MCO continued with the announcement of an even tighter phase three, which began on April 15 and was set to end on April 28. This has now been extended to a fourth phase, again by two weeks, from April 29 to May 12. Prime minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin announced the extension in his live Ramadan address to the nation earlier tonight.</p>
<p>As it was before, no surprises with the latest extension, even if fatigue and some element of economic anxiety is starting to set in. This is because we’re still not out of the woods yet, despite the control measures and excellent work by the health ministry having reduced the number of new Covid-19 cases daily to double digits in the past week.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the threat remains, and so the decision to continue with the MCO is being taken to reduce new cases to a minimum and completely prevent the spread of this epidemic, the PM said. He added that during phase four, the government will evaluate the latest data provided by health ministry to determine the next steps.</p>
<p>“I do not rule out the possibility that the MCO will be extended after this. You might not be able to celebrate Hari Raya in your hometown,” he said in his speech, hinting that a further fifth phase was possible.</p>
<p>However, he said that if the number of cases continue to see a significant decline, the government may relax control over several sectors, including the social sector. “This is to enable people to enjoy a more comfortable life. The National Security Council (NSC) is developing a comprehensive plan on this,” he said.</p>
<p>Muhyiddin said that the government is studying ways to gradually revive the economy. This includes developing comprehensive short-term, medium and long-term recovery plans to ensure economic activity can be revived quickly after the MCO ends. This will be drawn up by the finance ministry and the economic planning unit, together with the prime minister’s department.</p>
<p>The focus, he said, was to identify measures and initiatives that will stimulate short- and medium-term economic growth, and encourage the confidence of the people and investors to revitalise the country. “Among the initiatives being planned are building the capacity and skills of the people, promoting domestic spending, enhancing the resilience of industries including SMEs, and fostering a more positive investment environment for the future,” he explained.</p>
<p>The PM said that despite the extension to the MCO, companies in certain sectors will be allowed to operate, but will be subject to stringent compliance with regards to employee safety, social distancing and workplace hygiene. Businesses that have been given permission to reopen in phase three include workshops and service centres, although some questions related to movement around the process still remain open-ended.</p>
<p>He said that the government will consider opening up some sectors and other sub-sectors, again subject to strict compliance. Detailed guidelines and conditions will be issued to investors and the corporate sector as to how to go about restarting their companies’ operations.</p>
<p>Additionally, he said that with the dramatic decline of new Covid-19 cases, the government has decided to relax some measures with regards to interstate travel, reiterating that which was mentioned yesterday by senior minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob.</p>
<p>The primary involves the relaxation of movement for IPTA (public university) and IPTS (private university) students, for them to be allowed to return to their homes. Muhyiddin said that the process for getting these students home is currently being planned by the government, with the advice of the health ministry.</p>
<p>He said that since the number of students involved is huge, with almost 100,000 in the equation, the government will have to plan movement carefully to ensure all is in order and there is no risk of infection. Before being allowed home, all of these students will have to undergo testing to ascertain that they have no Covid-19 symptoms, he added.</p>
<p>He also said that the government is exploring the possibility of allowing those who went back to their hometowns before the MCO was enforced to return to Kuala Lumpur and other major cities, with the granting of a one-time travel authorisation for this purpose. However, since this movement is expected to involve a huge number of people, authorities will need to gather all data possible and study the best way to regulate movement.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Ismail Sabri had said that to facilitate this, the specific group will have to make applications online via the ‘Gerak Malaysia’ app from April 25, and that the matter would be then studied. If it is allowed, movement will likely happen after May 1, he added.</p>
<p>Measures already in place for the MCO remain, with a slight revision to the operating time for public transport during the fasting month. As before, the operating hours for all supermarkets, restaurants doing takeaways and petrol stations as well as bank ATMs are from 8am to 8pm. Food delivery services can operate only from 8am to 8pm daily.</p>
<p>Limited operation hours for public transport (LRT/MRT and stage buses) will continue, although with an additional hour being added in the evening for the month of Ramadan. This is from 6am to 10am and from 4pm (previously, 5pm) to 10pm daily, while taxis and ride-hailing vehicles will be permitted to operate from 6am to 10pm.</p>
<p>The number of essential services has been expanded from 10 to 15, although the 10 km cap on travel distance from home to get food and necessities remains, as does the one-person-per-car rule. The police, meanwhile, won’t be letting up in its efforts to maintain tighter control measures that were introduced in phase three, and will continue to arrest those who violate the MCO.

<h3 id="prospect-of-mco-extension-looms">Prospect of MCO extension looms</h3>
<p><img src="https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/04/23/653847.jpg" alt="img">
PETALING JAYA: The people must prepare to stay home longer with the prospect of phase four of the movement control order (MCO) looming, as the government prepares standard operating procedures (SOPs) to cater for Ramadan, say government sources.</p>
<p>Although there has yet to be an official announcement, the government’s preparation for a Ramadan under MCO signals the possibility of a phase four.</p>
<p>The MCO, which began on March 18, is now in its third phase which will end on April 28.</p>
<p>As the first three phases were in two-week stages, phase four is likely to be another two weeks.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin is expected to give a special Ramadan speech to the nation tonight to address the worries of Muslims fasting during the MCO.</p>
<p>Business sectors are already bracing for an extended MCO and are making arrangements to cushion the impact. Business owners say they intend to continue operating at below 50% of their capacity.</p>
<p>Senior Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri said the government was not only looking at allowing students who had been stuck at hostels in higher learning institutions due to the MCO to go back to their hometowns, but it was also discussing the possibility of allowing those who went back to their hometowns during the first few days of the MCO to return to the towns and cities.</p>
<p>“For the early stages, they can apply to the police through the online application Gerak Malaysia, a collaboration between the police and Communications and Multimedia Ministry, from April 25 onwards,” he said.</p>
<p>But he cautioned that the possibility of letting people come back to the cities from their hometowns would only be decided on once the authorities had the complete data.</p>
<p>Religious authorities, under the purview of Religious Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Dr Zulkifli Al-Bakri, are also formulating fatwa (a formal ruling on a point of Islamic law) to ensure that Muslims are not in doubt about fasting during the MCO.“The National Fatwa Council met on April 21 and we discussed issues that needed to be decided regarding fasting during MCO amid a pandemic.</p>
<p>“We decided that a swab test for Covid-19 does not invalidate a patient’s fast.</p>
<p>“We also discussed if frontliners could be exempted from fasting while on duty,” said Zulkifli in an interview, adding that all decisions were based on the advice of the Health Ministry.</p>
<p>He said frontliners who found it difficult to fast while on duty, be they medical or security personnel, had a right not to fast, but it must be replaced at another time.</p>
<p>“For Covid-19 patients on medication, he or she need not fast but must pay it back when he or she is well again.</p>
<p>“For suspected or positive cases where they do not have symptoms and do not have to take medication, including those being isolated at home or in quarantine stations, then if health permits, he or she should fast during Ramadan.</p>
<p>This was debated among the clerics in Al-Azhar University and doctors were consulted,” said Zulkifli.</p>
<p>Some government agencies such as the Federal Territory Islamic Affairs Department (Jawi) have also launched soup kitchens and food banks to assist underprivileged groups during Ramadan.</p>
<p>The latest is the RM2.16mil It’am Kitchen in selected mosques for pre-dawn and breaking of fast meals, which will then be delivered to deserving groups in accordance with the SOP of authorities, said Jawi.</p>
<p>The announcement by Senior Minister Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof yesterday that most applications from construction companies to continue operations during the MCO had been rejected was yet another indication of a potential extension to the MCO.</p>
<p>“The government received 19,000 applications from companies in the construction industry to operate during the MCO. Of these, 1,856 were approved while 7,387 applications were not,” he said.</p>
<p>Fadillah added that smaller contractors could restart their work for house renovation, but they must apply for permission from the authorities.</p>
