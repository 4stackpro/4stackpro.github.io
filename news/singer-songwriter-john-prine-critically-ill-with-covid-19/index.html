<p><img src="https://ww2.kqed.org/app/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/Prine.hed_-1020x574.jpg" alt="img">
The songwriter John Prine has been hospitalized for COVID-19 symptoms and &ldquo;his situation is critical,&rdquo; according to a statement from the Prine family.</p>
<p>Prine, 73, was admitted to a hospital on Thursday last week, and was put on a ventilator Saturday evening, the statement reads.</p>
<p>Prine&rsquo;s wife, Fiona, announced that she had tested positive for the coronavirus on March 17. At the time, John&rsquo;s test had come back &ldquo;inconclusive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Read the statement from the family below.</p>
<p>Prine&rsquo;s hospitalization comes four days after fellow songwriter Jackson Browne tested positive for the coronavirus. Earlier on Sunday, country singer Joe Diffie died due to coronavirus symptoms.</p>
<p>Prine&rsquo;s latest album, released in 2018, is The Tree of Forgiveness. &ldquo;I think everybody needs a little forgiveness, I would think,&rdquo; Prine told KQED at the time. &ldquo;And I think the person who&rsquo;s hardest to forgive is probably yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prine underwent hip surgery in February, and remarked that he was &ldquo;looking forward to being back on the road,&rdquo; a reference to his near-constant tour schedule.</p>
<p>Prine has also won two previous bouts with cancer: once in 1998 for throat cancer, and once in 2013 for lung cancer.</p>
<p>Prine and wife Fiona reside in Nashville.

<p>Legendary singer-songwriter John Prine, a part-time Gulfport resident, is hospitalized in “critical” condition after suddenly developing symptoms consistent with the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The news, posted to his social media Sunday evening, said he’s been intubated and has been receiving care since Thursday.</p>
<p>“His situation is critical,” Prine’s family stated. “This is hard news for us to share. But so many of you have loved and supported John over the years, we wanted to let you know, and give you the chance to send on more of that love and support now. And know that we love you, and John loves you.”</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Prine’s wife Fiona announced she had tested positive for COVID-19 and had isolated herself from her husband, who has a history of health issues. In the late ’90s, he had a tumor surgically removed from his neck. He again battled cancer in 2013, this time of the lung. And last year, he canceled a handful of tour dates after doctors advised him he was at risk of a stroke.</p>
<p>Fiona said in her posts that John’s tests had come back “indeterminate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“There’s a chance he may not have this virus, and we are working really, really hard and being really diligent about all of the protocols,&rdquo; she said in her post. “So far, he’s fine. He’s always got a little something going on, but he’s 73 years old and he may have some issues, but he may not have this virus and I want to keep it that way.”</p>
<p>On Sunday, after sharing the news of her husband’s condition, she wrote: “I am scared and sad and I am hopeful.”</p>
<p>The news of Prine’s condition came hours after country singer Joe Diffie, 61, died from complications related to the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Discovered by Kris Kristofferson in the early 1970s, Prine was often compared to Bob Dylan for his evocative lyrics and storytelling. Several of his songs became hits for other artists, including Angel From Montgomery (Bonnie Raitt) and You Never Even Called Me By My Name (David Allan Coe).</p>
<p>Starting in the ’90s, Prine would vacation in Pinellas County, visiting friends to fish, until he finally broke down and bought a small bungalow near the water in Gulfport.</p>
<p>“I never thought about buying a place,” Prine told the Tampa Bay Times in 2005. “We usually rent a house when we come here. But (Gulfport) is such a neat neighborhood.”</p>
<p>Prine’s music has enjoyed a resurgence in recent years, with a generation of performers professing their respect for his songcraft. At recent concerts at Ruth Eckerd Hall in Clearwater, he’s welcomed surprise guests like Jason Isbell and Sturgill Simpson. In 2018, The Tree of Forgiveness, his first new album in 13 years, debuted at No. 5 on the Billboard chart.</p>
<p>Last year he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and headlined his own music festival in the Dominican Republic. And in January, he received the Grammys’ Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>
<p>He last performed locally in December at Ruth Eckerd Hall, where he acknowledged numerous Tampa Bay friends shouting to him from the stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for your yelps,” he told them. “You make me feel right at home.”</p>
