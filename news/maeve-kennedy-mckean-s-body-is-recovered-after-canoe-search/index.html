<p>The body of Maeve Kennedy McKean, granddaughter of assassinated presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy, has been found in Maryland.</p>
<p>The 40-year-old and her eight-year-old son were last seen on Thursday evening riding in a canoe off Chesapeake Bay.</p>
<p>After an extensive search operation, police said on Monday that her body had been found in water about 2.5 miles (4km) south of where they had set off.</p>
<p>Officials will continue looking for her missing son, Gideon, on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Mrs McKean was the daughter of Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the former Maryland lieutenant governor. She worked as a public health and human rights lawyer and was executive director of Georgetown University&rsquo;s Global Health Initiative.</p>
<p>She had been staying with her family at her mother&rsquo;s house in Shady Side, Maryland, when she went missing.</p>
<p>Her husband, David McKean, said in a Facebook post that they had been &ldquo;self-quarantining&rdquo; there away from their usual residence in Washington DC in order to give their children more space.</p>
<p>He said his wife and son had disappeared after attempting to retrieve a ball they had been playing with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They got into a canoe, intending simply to retrieve the ball, and somehow got pushed by wind or tide into the open bay,&rdquo; he wrote on Friday. &ldquo;About 30 minutes later they were spotted by an onlooker from land, who saw them far out from shore, and called the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Police said last week that their canoe &ldquo;appeared to be overtaken by the strong winds&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Officials also confirmed an overturned boat matching its description had been found on Thursday evening, hours after they went missing.</p>

<p>Boats, helicopters and underwater sonar technology has been used to help locate the pair.</p>
<p>Kathleen Kennedy Townsend paid tribute to her daughter last week, following news that the rescue operation had become a recovery one.</p>
<p>In a statement, she said her daughter had been &ldquo;vivid&rdquo; and had dedicated her life to society&rsquo;s most vulnerable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heart is crushed, yet we shall try to summon the grace of God and what strength we have to honour the hope, energy and passion that Maeve and Gideon set forth into the world,&rdquo; she said in a statement.</p>
<p>Congressman Joe Kennedy, Mrs McKean&rsquo;s cousin, also paid tribute.</p>
<p>Skip Twitter post by @RepJoeKennedy We love you Maeve. We love you Gideon. Our family has lost two of the brightest lights. Grateful for the prayers. Hold your loved ones tight. — Rep. Joe Kennedy III (@RepJoeKennedy) April 4, 2020 Report</p>
<p>David McKean, announcing the family accident on Friday, described his wife as his &ldquo;everything&rdquo; and said his young son was both &ldquo;brave&rdquo; and &ldquo;deeply compassionate&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible to sum up Gideon here. I am heartbroken to even have to try,&rdquo; he wrote on Facebook. &ldquo;I used to marvel at him as a toddler and worry that he was too perfect to exist in this world. It seems to me now that he was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Kennedy family, an American political dynasty, has been beset by a series of tragedies.</p>
<p>Mrs McKean&rsquo;s grandfather, New York Senator Robert F Kennedy, was assassinated in 1968. His death came less than five years after his brother, President John F Kennedy, was also shot dead.

<h3 id="kennedy-family-remembers-maeve-mckean-son-as-search-is-suspended">Kennedy family remembers Maeve McKean, son as search is suspended</h3>
<p><img src="https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/maeve-kennedy-missing-search-web-split.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="img">
Kennedy family members filled social media with loving tributes to Maeve Kennedy McKean and her 8-year-old son as authorities carried on the grim search for their bodies Saturday.</p>
<p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo also mourned the deaths of his ex-wife’s niece and her son in his daily briefing on the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>David McKean posted an exceptionally heartfelt and detailed note on Facebook just hours after his wife and son disappeared canoeing in the Chesapeake Bay.</p>
<p>“It has been more than 24 hours, and the chances they have survived are impossibly small,” David McKean wrote Friday. “It is clear that Maeve and Gideon have passed away.”</p>
<p>McKean, 40, was the granddaughter of former US Attorney General Sen. Robert F. Kennedy. She and her husband, along with their three children – Gideon, Toby, 2, and Gabriella, 7 — were self-quarantining from the coronavirus at a home near her mother’s waterfront property in Shady Side, Maryland.</p>
<p>McKean, a human rights lawyer and the executive director of the Georgetown University Global Health Initiative, and Gideon went missing around late Thursday afternoon after they took a canoe to retrieve a ball that the kids had been playing with in the front yard, David McKean said. The Coast Guard began searching for the pair Friday after discovering the capsized canoe miles away.</p>
<p>McKean’s mother, former Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, talked frankly about the depth of her grief and thanked the public for “all the outpouring of love and prayers.”</p>
<p>“My heart is crushed, yet we shall try to summon the grace of God and what strength we have to honor the hope, energy and passion that Maeve and Gideon set forth into the world,” Kennedy Townsend said in a statement, according to CNN.</p>
<p>In tributes on social media, McKean was depicted as a cherished member of the Kennedy family.</p>
<p>“Maeve was a sister to me growing up. I cannot imagine my childhood, or my adulthood without her. She will live in a special place in my heart forever, brightened by Gideon’s sweet smile,” her cousin, Kick Kennedy, daughter of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., wrote on Instagram.</p>
<p>US Rep. Joe Kennedy III tweeted: “We love you Maeve. We love you Gideon. Our family has lost two of the brightest lights. Grateful for the prayers. Hold your loved ones tight.”</p>
<p>Cuomo, who was married to Kerry Kennedy, McKean’s cousin, called the tragedy “emotionally taxing.” The governor and his ex-wife have three daughters.</p>

<p>“The most difficult level is the human level, it is for me, anyway,” he said. “My daughters’ cousins have a tragedy. They can’t hug each other, they can’t be with each other to grieve together.”</p>
<p>David McKean posted photos of his wife cuddling with their children, running in a race, and smiling alongside him and their friends.</p>
<p>“You could hear Maeve’s laugh a block away—and she laughed a lot,” David McKean wrote. “She was magical—with endless energy that she would put toward inventing games for our children, taking on another project at work or in our community, and spending time with our friends.”</p>
<p>The father described Gideon as wise beyond his years — an avid reader, yet “incredibly social, athletic, and courageous.”</p>
<p>“He was deeply compassionate, declining to sing children’s songs if they contained a hint of animals or people being treated cruelly,” David McKean wrote. “He hated if I accidentally let a bad word slip.”</p>
<p>Both mother and son inherited the Kennedy work ethic and athleticism, McKean said.</p>
<p>“She once landed in DC after a 30-hour trip home from Asia, and then took a cab straight to the pool to play with our kids,” he recalled of his wife.</p>
<p>Gideon “played every sport he could, complaining to me that even though he was often playing six days a week, there was still that seventh day, and why hadn’t I signed him up for something else,” his father wrote.

April 6 (UPI) &ndash; Maryland police said Monday that they have recovered the body of Maeve Kennedy Townsend McKean who went missing Thursday along with her son while they were canoeing on the Chesapeake Bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a days-long search that involved aviation and underwater imaging solar technology, authorities recovered missing person Maeve Kennedy Townsend McKean,&rdquo; the Maryland Natural Resources Police said in a statement, adding they will continue to search for her 8-year-old son, Gideon Joseph Kennedy McKean.</p>
<p>Her body was discovered at around 5:30 p.m. Monday by a dive and rescue team about 25 feet underwater and approximately 2.5 miles south of her mother&rsquo;s Shady Side home where she and her son had departed from last week.</p>
<p>In a Facebook post a day after their disappearance, David McKean said the family was self-quarantining at the house and had ventured out onto the lake in a canoe to retrieve a ball that one of them had kicked into a nearby cove.</p>
<p>He said a bystander had called the police about 30 minutes later after seeing them far out to shore.</p>
<p>McKean was the granddaughter of former Attorney General and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy&rsquo;s and daughter of former Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend.
