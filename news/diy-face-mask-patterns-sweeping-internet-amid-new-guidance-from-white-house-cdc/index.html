Because of supply shortages, despite that guidance from the president, advising Americans in coronavirus hot spots to wear some form of facial protection, N-95 masks and even basic surgical masks need to be reserved for first responders and those on the front lines. Do it yourself personal protection has proven a somewhat effective alternative and you&rsquo;ll find lots of options.</p>
<p>While it’s a grim reality outfitting America with personal protective equipment, leave it to the internet to give that new DIY trend a life of its own.</p>
<p>Delving into the depths of the internet with that newfound free time, your browser fills with literally thousands of options.</p>
<p>Everything from a professional looking mask, to those that fall short of hitting the mark.</p>
<p>If you’ve never worked with patterns – most are easy to read, easy to understand and relatively easy to put together with minimal sewing skills. Potentially the most important question you’ll have to ask yourself: do I want polka dots or paisley?</p>
<p>Important note: putting one of these DIY masks together is an effort not necessarily geared to prevent the wearer from getting sick, but to prevent that person from passing any potential coronavirus onto someone else. As the world learned just recently, a large percentage of those who are spreading this aren’t showing many of the hallmark symptoms and may not even know they’re sick.</p>
<p>Experts tell us the choice of fabric, however, does make a big difference in terms of the level of protection.</p>
<p>A woven fabric is ideal and so called quilter’s cotton got high marks in testing based on its high thread count and tighter weave. But, because the idea is that some is better than none, in a pinch, feel free keep it simple and use what you have on hand.</p>

<p><img src="https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/img/YIOGtMOR35JdbtizSIxksgkRWCo=/756x567/2020/04/04/f77c88b1-9905-4b21-8c6e-5b9680888503/01-homemade-face-mask.jpg" alt="img">

<p>For the most up-to-date news and information about the coronavirus pandemic, visit the WHO website</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Friday new recommendations for individuals to voluntarily wear cloth face coverings in public, especially in crowded places where risk of person-to-person transmission is high. Before the revision in the CDC&rsquo;s official suggestion &ndash; which said the general public did not need to wear face masks &ndash; there&rsquo;s been a growing grassroots desire to make face masks at home out of common materials like cotton fabric, elastic and sometimes a filter material. If you&rsquo;re exploring making your own face mask for personal use, we&rsquo;d like to provide some helpful resources and information before you begin.</p>
<p>The main issue at hand is the severe shortage of N95 masks, which help protect medical professionals like doctors and nurses from acquiring the coronavirus. Surgical masks, which are not proven to effectively block out the tiniest particles that can transmit the respiratory virus, are also in short supply. Stores such as Amazon and Target have stopped selling N95 masks to the public in response to the shortage.</p>
<p>Homemade masks come in a variety of patterns and styles, so you&rsquo;ll want to know the different options available to you &ndash; and some hospitals recommend certain designs over others. We&rsquo;ll also explain the materials you need to make a mask, where to buy premade masks and where to donate extra masks you make.</p>
<p>Now playing: Watch this: Keep in touch with loved ones while keeping your distance</p>
<p>Remember that there&rsquo;s no strong evidence that homemade masks and face coverings can keep you from acquiring the coronavirus, but we do lay out some potential benefits below to wearing something on your face when you leave the house.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that homemade and hand-sewn face masks should be used in combination with appropriate social distancing on walks and in stores, and that thorough hand-washing is still the most advocated medical advice for healthy people to avoid acquiring the virus.</p>
<p>ButtonCounter.com</p>
<p>Face mask vs. face covering: What&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
<p>The CDC stresses the use of &ldquo;face coverings&rdquo; in its recommendation, not necessarily &ldquo;face masks.&rdquo; So what&rsquo;s the difference? A face covering can be any cloth that covers the nose and mouth, including a scarf or bandana wrapped around the face.</p>
<p>A face mask refers to a more specific shape that usually involves material that&rsquo;s more fitted to the nose, mouth and skull, as through the use of ear straps.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that &ldquo;face covering&rdquo; is used to differentiate coverings from surgical and N95 respirator masks that are so critically low in hospitals in New York and the rest of the country.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what the CDC says: &ldquo;Cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials at low cost can be used as an additional, voluntary public health measure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How homemade face masks can help</p>
<p>Homemade face mask patterns were available online before the coronavirus pandemic began. Most of them are intended to block out large particles such as dust; air pollution from cars, factories or ash; and allergens such as pollen.</p>
<p>Non-N95 face masks or coverings may not be able to block the smallest particles, but there are some benefits to wearing one, in addition to following other precautions:</p>
<p>May block large particles ejected from sneezing and coughing</p>
<p>Might help protect others from your sneezes and coughs if you acquired the virus but are otherwise asymptomatic and in public</p>
<p>Could encourage more mindful behavior, including avoiding touching one&rsquo;s mouth, nose and eyes</p>
<p>Peace of mind</p>
<p>Where can I buy face masks if I don&rsquo;t make my own?</p>
<p>We recommend washing any face masks you buy to sterilize them before use.</p>
<p>Where to find face mask patterns to make yourself</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re searching for patterns, look for one that goes above the nose and under the chin for maximum coverage. It should ideally fit snugly around your face. Sites such as Joann, a fabric and craft store, and Pinterest have patterns you can make, with how-to guides included.</p>
<p>Some patterns show a folded design. Others are shaped more like N95 or surgical masks.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re volunteering to make face masks for a health care center or hospital that has requested them (more below), visit the hospital&rsquo;s website &ndash; some point to patterns they prefer for you to use.</p>
<p>Joann</p>
<p>Materials you&rsquo;ll need to make a face mask at home</p>
<p>To start a DIY face mask, you&rsquo;ll want these supplies on hand:</p>
<p>Cotton fabric</p>
<p>Elastic</p>
<p>A sewing kit or sewing machine</p>
<p>A nonporous yet breathable material to go between the fabric (this may be detailed in a pattern)</p>
<p>Some designs call for filter material, which is added in an effort to block smaller particles</p>
<p>After you&rsquo;re finished making the mask, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to sterilize it by throwing it in the washing machine or boiling it in water. Then let it air dry in an area with good airflow or that the sun hits, like in front of a window.</p>
<p>What if I can&rsquo;t sew?</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know where to begin when it comes to sewing, there&rsquo;s a no-sew face mask option. Instead of sewing the fabric together, you can use fabric glue and an iron. The iron is used to fuse the fabric and glue together. You&rsquo;ll also need to use the iron to create pleats in the fabric for a thicker mask.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have any of those materials, you can use a scarf and a couple of hair ties or rubber bands to quickly make a face covering &ndash; again, this is intended for personal use.</p>
<p>Now playing: Watch this: Coronavirus lockdown: Why social distancing saves lives</p>
<p>What to do if your ears get raw</p>
<p>If the elastic straps start to rub your ears painfully, you can make a headband with buttons. In this case, the elastic straps would go around the buttons, rather than your ears, making it potentially more comfortable to wear.</p>
<p>You can also use an S ring hook to attach the straps &ndash; take the straps and place them around each U of the ring. When you&rsquo;re ready to wear the mask, the S ring should be located on the back of your head. This can also help the mask fit better around your face since the ring would help pull the straps snug.</p>
<p>Where you can donate the masks you make</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to donate homemade face masks, there are multiple options, including Joann and hospitals and organizations on this list.</p>
<p>You can also search the internet for local face mask donations near you. Make sure that you find out how these groups prefer to receive your face masks, and maintain social distancing and smart practices while you drop them off.</p>
<p>To help you further cope with coronavirus in your area, here are the new CDC guidelines and everything to know about homemade face masks and coronavirus, which face masks can help protect you from coronavirus and how to help kill coronavirus in your home and car after you&rsquo;ve gone outside.</p>

<h3 id="using-blue-shop-towels-in-homemade-face-masks-can-filter-particles-2x-to-3x-better-than-cotton-3-clothing-designers-discover-after-testing-dozens-of-fabrics">Using blue shop towels in homemade face masks can filter particles 2x to 3x better than cotton, 3 clothing designers discover after testing dozens of fabrics</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.insider.com/5e8630ff14f18f0e2923c16d?width=1200&amp;format=jpeg" alt="img">
Lindsay Medoff, the CEO of Suay Sew Shop, a 30-employee boutique Los Angeles clothing manufacturer, wants the armies of people sewing homemade surgical masks to add a specific blue shop towel inside them.</p>
<p>Medoff and two friends were appalled by the dozens of mask patterns calling for cotton, a highly breathable, permeable fabric, and became obsessed with finding a fabric better suited for the job. They built a lab that could test particle filtration down to 0.3 microns and tested every fabric they could find, from coffee filters to industrial materials.</p>
<p>They discovered that by adding two blue shop towels and using a design that produces a tighter-fitting mask, they could make a mask that could block up to 95% of the particles they could test, while the cotton masks blocked 20% to 60% of the particles.</p>
<p>These are not meant to replace the N95 masks worn by healthcare workers — they&rsquo;re designed to be an alternative to the cotton masks that many people are making and wearing for quick trips to the grocery store.</p>
<p>The women are sewing 200,000 masks and giving them — and a design — away, as well as raising money to pay their workers their full wages.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re also raising money to get their mask tested with the actual COVID-19 pathogen to see whether their design could be validated as a safer solution during the mask shortage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is ordinary people taking their power back,&rdquo; Medoff said.</p>
<p>Visit Business Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>The US boutique clothing manufacturing industry is abuzz as sewing shops retool themselves into surgical-mask-making factories, like something out of a World War II &ldquo;it&rsquo;s up to you&rdquo;-style poster.</p>
<p>Lindsay Medoff, the CEO and owner of Suay Sew Shop, a 30-employee boutique manufacturer in Los Angeles, has eagerly jumped on board. But when she got a mask pattern from an ER-doctor friend of hers a couple of weeks ago, she was appalled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They sent me a pattern that looked like [it was] from Etsy,&rdquo; she told Business Insider. &ldquo;I thought, &lsquo;What do I do with this?'&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suay&rsquo;s fashion niche is industrial upcycling, a big fashion trend these days. The company takes unsold clothing items from major brands, such as Patagonia down vests, and crafts them into new clothing, recycling 85% or more of the materials.</p>
<p>But the mask instructions circulating on the internet are not geared toward professional, industrial production. Pro shops use digital instructions, not the kind of paper patterns people buy from fabric shops like JoAnn, Medoff said.</p>
<p>Medoff called her best friend from high school, Chloe Schempf, who also sews and previously had a career designing displays for fashion brands like Urban Outfitters and Free People. Today she&rsquo;s a full-time mom living in rural Michigan, where her husband&rsquo;s veterinary practice is. (Her husband, Dr. Ray Harp, is a cast member on the long-running National Geographic show about country vets, &ldquo;The Incredible Dr. Pol.&quot;)</p>
<p>Schempf had dusted off her sewing machine to join the troops of homemade-mask makers, but when she looked at the instructions, she had another surprise.</p>
<p>No one seemed to be thinking about the fabric that the instructions called for: cotton, and cotton fill for the filter.</p>
<p>How could a highly breathable cotton weave be the right material to filter microscopic pathogenic particles?</p>
<p>Then Schempf saw that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was telling healthcare workers unable to get proper gear to use a bandana as a last resort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The recommendation of a bandana made me ill,&rdquo; Schempf said. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t understand how we can go from a 2020 N95 mask to a 1918-era cotton mask with a variable filtration of 20% to 60%.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3 women set up their own mask-testing shop</p>
<p>Clothing is all about choosing the right fabric for the right use. We don&rsquo;t use insulated down-filled fabric for a swimsuit or a T-shirt jersey knit for a winter coat.</p>
<p>So Schempf, Medoff, and Medoff&rsquo;s business partner, Heather Pavlu, a co-owner of Suay Sew Shop, became obsessed with finding a less permeable fabric for masks.</p>
<p>Suay Sew Shop&rsquo;s Heather Pavlu testing mask particle filtration in the lab she and her friends built. Suay Sew Shop &ldquo;We spent a few days researching and brainstorming any material that could filter: coffee filters, batting, window shades, Swiffer, interfacing, etc., all the way to more technical materials that are available to specialized industrial sectors like aviation, oil refinery, medical fields,&rdquo; Schempf said.</p>
<p>They bought a $1,400 particulate-counter device from Grainger that measures filtration ability down to 0.3 microns and spent another 10 sleepless days testing all the fabrics they could find.</p>
<p>They wanted a material they could buy as easily as cotton but that balanced filtration with breathability — they discovered that HEPA vacuum-cleaner bags, for instance, had great filtration but were too suffocating to wear.</p>
<p>The ideal material turned out to be stretchy blue shop towels made from a polyester hydro knit.</p>
<p>Inserting two of these towels into an ordinary cotton mask brought filtration up to 93% of particles as small as 0.3 microns, the smallest their machine could test. Meanwhile, the cotton masks filtered 60% of particles at best in their tests, Schempf said.</p>
<p>Polyester hydro knit towels are readily available at hardware and automotive stores. The two brands they tested were ToolBox&rsquo;s shop towel and ZEP&rsquo;s industrial blue towel. Interestingly, Scott&rsquo;s pro shop towels, which are also made with a hydro knit fabric, didn&rsquo;t work as well, Schempf said.</p>
<p>The team is continuing to test other brands.</p>
<p>ToolBox shop towels. Harbor Freight Having found the material, they worked on a design. &ldquo;The fit has a lot to do with your protection,&rdquo; Schempf said. &ldquo;You can have a great mask, but if you aren&rsquo;t getting a tight fit, it won&rsquo;t protect you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pavlu said she sewed &ldquo;at least 15 types of the patterns that were being spread on the internet&rdquo; before the team realized they were going to have to design a new mask themselves.</p>
<p>So Pavlu tracked down and rented a PortaCount Respirator Fit Tester 8040 machine, and the team tested things like how a wire nose clamp could help create a high-filtration, one-size-fits-all mask.</p>
<p>They are putting the final tweaks to their mask design and plan to release the design for free to the public next week. The instructions will be good for home sewers and pros, available on Suay&rsquo;s website and its GoFundMe page.</p>
<p>200,000 masks from an industrial material</p>
<p>During their tests, they discovered another material that filtered exceptionally well: cleaning towels made from a plastic called polypropylene, used to clean industrial machines.</p>
<p>Suay Sew Shop&rsquo;s homemade fabric-testing lab. Suay Sew Shop Suay bought a big supply of it. But the team can&rsquo;t recommend this fabric to the public. The supply is dwindling, Medoff said, because the industrial makers of the material are now dedicating themselves to manufacturing medical-protection supplies.</p>
<p>Still, Suay has enough to make 200,000 masks and has already sewn thousands, Medoff said.</p>
<p>The team also discovered the mask held 95% of its filtration abilities after up to three machine washes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are calling them semi-disposable at this point and are continuing testing after six, seven, 10 washes,&rdquo; Pavlu said.</p>
<p>The next step is to test this mask and the shop-towel version to see whether they actually block the COVID-19 pathogen, which is a smaller particle than their equipment can test.</p>
<p>They are curious and hopeful about their masks, but they don&rsquo;t have any proof that they will protect healthy people from getting the virus any better than an ordinary cotton mask.</p>
<p>Health experts have said that while surgical-style masks like these aren&rsquo;t likely to protect a healthy person from getting the virus, if people with COVID-19 wear them — especially along with following social distancing — that could help minimize the spread.</p>
<p>Schempf said she found a lab in Kansas City making COVID-19 testing kits that was willing to test their masks, but the testing fee is $40,000. She&rsquo;s started a GoFundMe to raise the money and to fund mask-production efforts in her area of rural Michigan.</p>
<p>How masks can help</p>
<p>Medoff said that the shop-towel masks and the ones from polypropylene fabric that her staff is making are not foolproof safety measures. The logic is that if even cotton masks are useful, then ones made of less permeable material can only help.</p>
<p>Suay is in full production and giving the masks away to anyone who needs them, including medical professionals, nursing-home workers, hospice-care workers, people caring for an ill relative, and grocery-store workers — people who are &ldquo;risking their lives&rdquo; on the front lines, she said.</p>
<p>Suay Sew Shop&rsquo;s masks. Suay Sew Shop</p>
<p>Many of these people break down in tears when they get these masks, she said.</p>
<p>Because she&rsquo;s paying her workers their full wages to sew the free masks, she&rsquo;s asking for donations via a GoFundMe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is by community, for community,&rdquo; Medoff said. &ldquo;This is ordinary people taking their power back.&rdquo;
