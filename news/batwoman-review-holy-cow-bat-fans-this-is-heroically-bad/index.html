It is a rare thing, in these high-quality, high-stakes, immaculately professionalised TV times, to see someone on screen who can only 80% act. But now, like only semi-convincing buses, two such performers have come along at once in Batwoman (E4), the CW’s new entry into the Arrowverse. One of them is Dougray Scott, whom you may 80% remember from his villainous roles/substantial cameos in about 80% of things since the mid-90s. He plays Jacob Kane, the brother of Martha Wayne and the head of the Crows, the private-security-firm-cum-army that has taken over the job of protecting Gotham City since Batman disappeared three years before we arrive in the story.</p>
<p>More problematically, the other 80-per-center is Ruby Rose, who plays Jacob’s daughter Kate Kane. By the end of episode one, she has broken into cousin Bruce’s bat cave and taken on his mantle. Her 80% covers all the scenes that do not require her to be superheroic. What made her so good in her breakthrough part, as Stella in Orange Is the New Black – her flair for comedy, the perpetual ironic glint in her eye and her ability to turn seductive at a moment’s notice – is great here for the connective tissue (the back story with the girlfriend she lost when the police training academy expelled her for being gay, the banter with comic book baddies and so on). What she can’t muster is the full-hearted saviour-of-Gotham approach needed in other scenes, or the emotional gush that Kate’s daddy issues and survivor’s guilt (from the childhood car crash that killed her mother and her twin sister) periodically require. And that is before she is further hampered by the addition of Kate’s famous red hair, via a wig so preposterous it should come with a warning: fatally injurious to the suspension of disbelief.</p>
<p>Everyone involved, of course, might fare better if they had a decent script, proper lighting, well-choreographed fight scenes and sets that didn’t look as if they had been nailed together from whatever was left after Michael Keaton left the building in 1989. But you know what? Sometimes good enough is good enough. Sometimes a dead twin sister whose body was never found and a mad lady villain in an equally preposterous blond wig who knows the kind of details about a titular heroine’s life that only her missing twin sister could know is all the twist you can handle. Sometimes a gender flip is enough sophistication and sufficient justification for another foray into this, that or the other verse. If Batwoman were Watchmen quality, no one would have the mental bandwidth at the moment to deal with it.</p>
<p>Maybe when things improve a bit, or we get used to a new normal, it will be possible to care about the fact that Batwoman’s plot is ridiculously slight, that her character is woefully underdeveloped and overtly presented as the real Batman’s stand-in, rather than an opportunity to interrogate gender expectations, narrative norms and a variety of other fertile issues offered by the premise. (And that is to say nothing of a fight back against the hate that poured out towards it when the casting of Rose, a lesbian, was announced.)</p>
<p>For now, thought, pure and perfect trash is what we need – and Batwoman provides. Add it to a list that should already comprise Gossip Girl (get it under your belt before the joyfully anticipated new generation sequel arrives), the remakes of V and Melrose Place and anything else starring Kate Cassidy. Oh – and Revolution, which stars Billy Burke, who is him from that thing, and Elizabeth Mitchell, who is her from that other thing, as part of a group of people getting used to a world with – because of … umm … particles! – no electricity. No one knows about this two-series wonder, but now you do. You can thank me later.</p>
<p>For the few who can still cope with complexity, nuance and scripts in which people don’t stop every five minutes to cry: “You’re all I have left!” at each other – or wonder aloud to themselves whether the new Batperson is also male (Kate’s ex Sophie has to turn away from a meeting to say: “He?” with a thoughtful frown) – there are plenty of other places to go. There are Netflix binges to have and archival box sets to watch on BBC iPlayer. For the rest of us, there is hokum – and thank God for that.

Batwoman, E4, review: An action-packed way to pass the time — but nothing more</p>
<p>Ruby Rose stars in the latest addition to the Batman storyline as Kate Kane, Bruce Wayne&rsquo;s cousin</p>
<p>By Emily Baker Sunday, 29th March 2020, 10:00 pm Updated Sunday, 29th March 2020, 10:01 pm</p>

<p>Batwoman, Sunday, 9pm, E4 ★★★</p>
<p>Extraordinary times call, you would think, for extraordinary television. Whoever was scheduling this weekend’s offering didn’t seem to get the memo. All Round to Mrs Brown’s on BBC One? No, thank you. And so I ventured away from the Big Five channels in the hope that Batwoman on E4, shipped over from American network The CW, would do the trick.</p>
<p>The Orange Is The New Black star and all-round smokeshow Ruby Rose takes on the character of Batwoman, known to us originally as Bruce Wayne’s cousin, Kate Kane. While most comic book-based shows like to plunge us right into the action, dealing with the whys and wherefores later, Batwoman went back to the beginning, laying out the superhero’s original story.</p>

<p>I could not possibly tell you what it was, though, because the plot of this 40-minute show moved so quickly and with little explanation as to who anyone was or why they were involved. It meant that you were constantly guessing about what was happening.</p>
<p>After 20 minutes of frustration, I decided to just let the action wash over me and started to enjoy things a whole lot more. The fight scenes got the balance of crash-bang-wallop with impressive acrobatics, the tie-ins with the original Batman franchise didn’t feel too forced and, crucially, Rose was a dominating presence on screen.</p>
<p>Introducing a villain reminiscent of The Joker or Harley Quinn was a smart move, although we didn’t learn much about her, other than that she likes to quote from Alice in Wonderland.

<h3 id="batwoman-broke-batmans-big-rule-fixing-her-show-in-the-process">Batwoman broke Batman&rsquo;s big rule, fixing her show in the process</h3>
<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/batwoman-1549374929.jpg?crop=0.998xw:0.755xh;0.00160xw,0.0529xh&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">
Batwoman spoilers follow.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d think being a playboy vigilante who dresses up as a bat would be quite freeing, but Batman still likes to play by the rules, at least, when it comes to killing. Aside from Zack Snyder&rsquo;s version and a few comic book exceptions, it&rsquo;s widely accepted that the Dark Knight is against murder – and that mantra has been passed on to his extended Bat-Family too.</p>
<p>For most of Batwoman&rsquo;s first season, Kate Kane refuses to cross that line. No matter how bad things might get, Batman&rsquo;s successor always knew that killing was wrong, and her refusal to give into this impulse is what set her apart from criminals like her sister, Alice.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even caped crusaders have their limits, and in episode 15, Batwoman is forced to confront hers when she&rsquo;s goaded into murdering Dr August Cartwright upon learning he desecrated her mother&rsquo;s corpse.</p>
<p>The CW</p>
<p>Moments after Kate strangles him to death in a fit of rage, her sister Alice then bounds in with Jacob and boldly declares: &ldquo;Congratulations, Daddy. Now both your daughters are killers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So begins a shocking downward spiral which forces Batwoman to confront her own morality and question what it means to be a hero. Even when we later learn that Alice deliberately set these events in motion, it doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that Kate still took a life, something which goes against what the cape should stand for.</p>
<p>Speaking to EW, showrunner Caroline Dries explained why this surprise moment will be so pivotal to the show moving forward:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was important to me because I was trying to figure out Kate&rsquo;s own morality and who Kate was. There&rsquo;s this assumption, because she&rsquo;s wearing the Batsuit, Kate follows Batman&rsquo;s rule book and is gonna follow the Bat-code: Batman doesn&rsquo;t kill people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I was like, a code is something that evolves through your own personal journey and Kate hasn&rsquo;t been on her journey yet. We&rsquo;re on the journey with her. So Kate doesn&rsquo;t really know what her code is until she hits those lines in the sand that she doesn&rsquo;t know if she wants to cross or not. We&rsquo;re watching her develop her own code.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The CW</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t easy. At first, Kate is broken by what she did, and even teams up with Alice, temporarily. While that particularly complicated development in the siblings&rsquo; relationship is solved by the end of episode 16, it&rsquo;s clear that Batwoman&rsquo;s indiscretion will continue to impact the rest of the show moving forward.</p>
<p>When EW asked how Kate&rsquo;s friends will react to the news, actor Camrus Johnson explained how his character would immediately compare her actions to Batman&rsquo;s:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Batman had a code for a reason, and Luke looks up to Batman. He trusts Batman&rsquo;s rules, and he knows that if Batman succeeded for this long and stood by these rules, then everyone should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the thing, though. Batwoman isn&rsquo;t Batman, and Kate Kane isn&rsquo;t Bruce Wayne. Sure, they might be cousins, but they&rsquo;re also two completely separate, unique characters&hellip; who just so happen to dress up like bats and fight crime in Gotham.</p>
<p>Batwoman has sometimes struggled to escape the long shadow of Bruce&rsquo;s cape, both as a show and as a character, but by breaking Batman&rsquo;s cardinal rule, Kate&rsquo;s journey is now distinctly separate to his, and to the rest of the Arrowverse too.</p>
<p>Oliver Queen in particular has killed his fair share of people over on Arrow, and while guilt did eventually sink in, his journey was all about transforming his family&rsquo;s legacy for the better.</p>
<p>Jack Rowand The CW</p>
<p>Kate, on the other hand, has to deal with the impossibly high standards set by her cousin, and this unique contrast will help shape her future in ways no other Arrowverse show has explored thus far.</p>
<p>All too often, these characters casually take lives without question, and that&rsquo;s something big-screen versions of Batman are guilty of too. Most recently, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice introduced us to a Darker Knight than usual, one who murdered multiple people in one particularly brutal sequence alone.</p>
<p>Snyder defended this decision in a video clip which was later posted on Reddit, saying: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cool point of view to be like &lsquo;my heroes are still innocent… My heroes didn&rsquo;t commit any atrocities&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s cool. But you&rsquo;re living in a f**king dream world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, assuming that vigilantes like Batman would never kill might be naive, but to gloss over the inner turmoil this would create is pretty naive too. Thankfully, The CW&rsquo;s Batwoman seems keen to avoid this pitfall, exploring the ramifications of Kate&rsquo;s decision in a far more meaningful and significant way.</p>
<p>Batwoman airs on Sundays at 8/7c on The CW in the US. E4 will premiere the show in the UK on March 29.</p>
