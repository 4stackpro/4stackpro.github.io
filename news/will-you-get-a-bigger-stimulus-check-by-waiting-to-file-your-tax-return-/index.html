As you&rsquo;ve probably heard, the government is pumping huge amounts of cash into the U.S. economy with economic stimulus checks that will be sent to American adults soon. This is part of a larger plan to counter the coronavirus-induced meltdown that is pushing us into a recession. (For a full explanation of the stimulus checks, see Your 2020 Stimulus Check: How Much? When? And Other Questions Answered.)</p>
<p>When the IRS is ready to calculate the amount of your check, they will need to know your tax filing status, how many &ldquo;qualifying&rdquo; children you have (generally, 16 years old or younger), and your adjusted gross income (AGI). If you&rsquo;ve already filed your 2019 return, the IRS will look at that return to get the necessary information. But if you haven&rsquo;t filed your 2019 return when the IRS is ready to send your payment (your return isn&rsquo;t due until July 15 this year), they&rsquo;ll pull your 2018 return for the data they need.</p>
<p>That gives you an opportunity to influence the amount of your check if you haven&rsquo;t filed your 2019 return yet. Using our Stimulus Check Calculator, you can get an estimated stimulus payment amount using both your 2018 and 2019 returns (a best guess for 2019 will do in a pinch). If your check will be higher using your 2018 return, then you can simply hold off on filing your 2019 return until July 15 (or until you receive your stimulus payment). That way, the IRS will be forced to use your 2018 return to calculate your payment.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example: Nicholas got a promotion and a big raise last year. As a result, his AGI jumped from $80,000 in 2018 to $95,000 in 2019. He is single with no children. Using his 2018 return, Nicholas would get a $950 stimulus check. However, if he used his 2019 return, he would only get $200. By waiting to file his 2019 return, he could increase his stimulus check by a whopping $700!</p>
<p>SEE ALSO: 11 Coronavirus Stimulus Measures That Could Help You in 2020</p>
<p>Will You Have to Pay Back the Difference?</p>
<p>In the example above, would Nicholas have to pay back that $700 somehow? We don&rsquo;t know that yet. The stimulus checks are actually just advanced payments of a new tax credit for the 2020 tax year. If your stimulus check is less than the 2020 credit amount, the law allows you to claim the difference next year when you file your 2020 tax return. However, the law doesn&rsquo;t say what to do if the stimulus check is more than the 2020 credit.</p>
<p>Back in 2008, when we had a similar stimulus check program, there was no mechanism for paying back any &ldquo;extra&rdquo; stimulus check money. The IRS hasn&rsquo;t said yet if they&rsquo;ll repeat that approach this time around, but we&rsquo;re keeping an eye out for guidance addressing the situation. Stay tuned!</p>
<p>Delayed Refunds</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a potential drawback to delaying your 2019 return&ndash;you also delay any refund due. In late March, the average refund for this filing season is slightly below $3,000. If you&rsquo;re getting a 2019 refund, you have to decide if the extra money you&rsquo;d get in your stimulus check by waiting to file is worth the delay in getting your refund.</p>

<h3 id="will-you-get-a-stimulus-check-if-you-receive-social-security-or-disability-or-didnt-file-a-tax-return">Will you get a stimulus check if you receive Social Security or disability, or didn’t file a tax return?</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.wthr.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2019/04/12/social_security_cards_web_970.jpg?itok=qZ0_coKu" alt="img">
WASHINGTON (TEGNA) - A $2.2 trillion relief package passed the Senate Wednesday night. President Donald Trump signed the legislation Friday.</p>
<p>The bill would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per individual adults and $2,400 for married couples and an additional $500 for each eligible child.</p>
<p>The full amount will be available for individuals making less than $75,000 and couples making less than $150,000 annually. The amount a person receives will phase out if they earn more, ending for those earning more than $99,000 annually.</p>
<p>Some of the top questions that have been received: Will I get a stimulus check if I receive Social Security or if I’m on disability? What about those who did not file tax returns in 2018 or 2019?</p>
<p>News outlets, including the Associated Press, are reporting that U.S. citizens receiving Social Security as well as retirees are eligible for the money.</p>
<p>As far as those who did not file tax returns, the answer is a bit more unclear.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a break down the answers to these questions from Fortune and Kiplinger Magazines.</p>
<p>Will Social Security beneficiaries receive checks?</p>
<p>According to Fortune Magazine, the proposed bill includes language that allows people who receive Social Security – many of whom are retired and do not file taxes – to receive money from the stimulus package.</p>
<p>In such cases, the government would access their data through the Social Security Administration to determine their rebate.</p>
<p>Will those on SSI receive checks?</p>
<p>Steven Wamhoff with the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy think tank told Fortune Magazine that the current bill excludes recipients of Supplemental Security Income (SSI), a federal welfare program granted to elderly and disabled people who are often living in poverty and not required to file tax returns.</p>
<p>What if I didn’t file a tax return for 2018 or 2019?</p>
<p>Some people did not file tax returns for 2018 or 2019 because their income did not reach the filing requirement threshold.</p>
<p>According to Kiplinger Magazine, the IRS can pull information from a 2019 Social Security Benefit Statement or Social Security Equivalent Benefit Statement if it does not have your tax returns from these years to calculate your stimulus check amount.</p>
<p>But what does this mean for those who did not receive Social Security or other retirement benefits in 2019?</p>
<p>Kiplinger reports that it is unclear right now what will happen in the situation but, at this point, there is a chance that you could receive a stimulus check.</p>
<p>Kiplinger does recommend, though, that people in this position may want to file their 2019 tax returns quickly. You can still file a return even if you will not get a refund and do not owe any tax.</p>
<p>For the stimulus checks in 2008, the IRS told people to file a return showing just $1 of income and at least $1 of adjusted gross income – even if you did not have it.</p>
<p>Those who get their return in before the IRS starts processing their stimulus payments should get a check.</p>
<p>What happens if I don’t get a check now?</p>
<p>Kiplinger reports that those who don’t get a check now won’t lose out on the money – they’ll just have to wait until next year to get it.</p>
<p>As the bill is written right now, checks that will be sent now are actually just advanced payments of a new refundable tax credit for the 2020 tax year.</p>
<p>If you do not get a stimulus payment in 2020, you can claim it next year as a refund or reduction of the tax you owe if you file a 2020 tax return by April 15, 2021.</p>
<p>Will the money I get be taxed later?</p>
<p>No. The check you receive is really just an advanced payment of a tax credit for the 2020 tax year, according to Kiplinger. It won&rsquo;t be included in your taxable income.</p>
<p>And no, you will not have to repay the money.

<h3 id="faq-on-stimulus-checks-unemployment-and-the-coronavirus-plan">F.A.Q. on Stimulus Checks, Unemployment and the Coronavirus Plan</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/27/business/26virus-qa/26virus-qa-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
Are there changes to the rules if my employer repays some of my student loans?</p>
<p>Yes. Some employers do this as an employee benefit. Between the date the bill is signed and the end of 2020, they can offer up to $5,250 of assistance without that money counting as part of the employee’s income. If the employer pays tuition for classes an employee is taking, that money will also count toward the $5,250.</p>
<p>Retirement Accounts</p>
<p>Which retirement account rules are suspended?</p>
<p>For the calendar year 2020, no one will have to take a required minimum distribution from any individual retirement accounts or workplace retirement savings plans, like a 401(k). That way, you aren’t forced to sell investments that may have fallen in value, which would lock in losses. If you don’t need the money now, you can let the investments sit and hope that they recover.</p>
<p>This change would not affect old-fashioned pensions.</p>
<p>What if I have to take money out of my I.R.A. or workplace retirement plan early?</p>
<p>You can withdraw up to $100,000 this year without the usual 10 percent penalty, as long as it’s because of the outbreak.</p>
<p>You will also be able to spread out any income taxes that you owe over three years from the date you took the distribution. And if you want, you could put the money back into the account before those three years are up, even though the rules may normally keep you from making a contribution that large.</p>
<p>This exception applies only to coronavirus-related withdrawals. You qualify if you tested positive, a spouse or dependent did or you experienced a variety of other negative economic consequences related to the pandemic. Employers can allow workers to self-certify that they are qualified to pull money from a workplace retirement account.</p>
<p>Can I still borrow from my 401(k) or other workplace retirement plan?</p>
<p>Yes, and you can take out twice the usual amount. For 180 days after the bill passes, with certification that you’ve been affected by the pandemic, you’ll be able to take out a loan of up to $100,000. Usually you can’t take out more than half your balance, but that rule is suspended.
