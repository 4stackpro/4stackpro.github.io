Puerto Rican trap singer and long time LGBT+ ally Bad Bunny got a full drag makeover and twerked with himself in his new music video.</p>
<p>The video for his song ‘Yo Perreo Sola‘ was released on Friday, March 27, and sees the artist, known off-stage as Benito Ocasio, make multiple outfit changes including several incredible drag looks.</p>
<p>The song’s title means “I twerk alone”, and at one point Bad Bunny can be seen twerking with himself.</p>
<p>‘Yo Perreo Sola’ explores themes of sexual harassment that women face in Latin America and around the world.</p>
<p>At one point, a neon sign in the video reads “ni una menos”, meaning “not one more”, a slogan used by feminists to protest gender-based violence.</p>
<p>The very end of the video shows a black screen with the words “si no quiere bailar contigo, respeta, ella perra sola”, which translates as “if she doesn’t want to dance with you, respect her, she’ll twerk alone”.</p>
<p>i will exterminate any male species that comes close to me at the club when yo perreo sola comes on — val (@benitoist) March 27, 2020</p>
<p>Bad Bunny has been vocal about LGBT+ rights since bursting onto the music scene in 2016, calling out reggaeton star Don Omar for making anti-gay comments, saying: “Homophobia in this day and age? How embarrassing, man.”</p>
<p>Last month, the artist paid a touching tribute to a trans woman murdered after she used a women’s bathroom in a McDonald’s in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Homeless and frequently sneered at online for her hunchbacked appearance and black tresses, Alexa Negrón Luciano was shot in February.</p>
<p>Performing on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on February 27, Bad Bunny shrugged off blazer to reveal a slogan t-shirt which read in Spanish: “They killed Alexa, not a man with a skirt.”</p>
<p>In an interview with the LA Times earlier this month, Bad Bunny was asked to define his sexuality.</p>
<p>He said: “It does not define me.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, I don’t know if in 20 years I will like a man. One never knows in life.</p>
<p>“But at the moment I am heterosexual and I like women.”

<h3 id="bad-bunny-finds-gold-in-the-past-while-j-balvin-is-trapped-in-the-future">Bad Bunny Finds Gold in the Past, While J Balvin Is Trapped in the Future</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/27/arts/26balvinbunny1/26balvinbunny1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg" alt="img">
This richness stands in contrast to the approach of the Colombian reggaeton superstar J Balvin, who just released his sixth album, the affable but slightly numbing “Colores.” Balvin was a key player in the Colombian reanimation of reggaeton in the late 2000s and early 2010s, and has become perhaps the genre’s most visible star thanks to his wide-ranging collaborations (with Beyoncé and Cardi B, among others). His mechanisms are straightforward and legible — if Bad Bunny has been the tastemaker ambassador, Balvin has been the glossy centrist. Both were guests during the Super Bowl halftime show in February, a sign of their increased visibility on bigger and bigger stages.</p>
<p>“Colores” — every track is named for a color — is a shiny reaffirmation of the steps that have made the reggaeton revival part of the broader global pop conversation over the past few years. The production is buoyant and polished, using reggaeton as a skeleton for ambitiously scaled club-pop. Sometimes there are left-field flourishes, like the kazoo-ish buzz running through “Amarillo,” or the ethereal whistles on “Arcoíris,” a collaboration with the Nigerian Afrobeats progressive Mr. Eazi.</p>
<p>But by and large, these are polite songs, and familiar, too. Balvin is a sweetly elegiac singer — see especially “Azul,” where he stretches out soft vowels like taffy — but his rapping is largely blank.</p>
<p>What makes these songs really travel is Balvin the hypercolor character — a dazzler in outrageously rare sneakers, chicly proportioned clothes, hair whatever color will be popular next month. His album art is by Takashi Murakami, that empty aesthete signifier who favors exuberant simplicity. And so it is with Balvin.

<h3 id="review--bad-bunnys-yhlqmdlg">Review | Bad Bunny’s ‘YHLQMDLG’</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.independent.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bad-bunny.jpg?resize=1200,630" alt="img">
Music Review | Bad Bunny’s ‘YHLQMDLG’ Sophomore Record Has Lethal Production, Smooth Vocals</p>
<p>Latin star Bad Bunny (a k a Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio) has blossomed into an international treasure and one of the most versatile artists of this generation. His sophomore entry, Yo Hago Lo Que Me Da La Gana (YHLQMDLG), is 20 tracks of pure lethal production overlaid with smooth vocals, and it rarely loses any energy. The opening tune, “Si Veo A Tu Mamá,” is an ode to a past lover and the intimacy of memories that would strike him if he ever ran into her mother. Even while reflecting on heartbreak, Bad Bunny keeps an upbeat momentum.</p>
<p>On his debut record, 2018’s X 100pre, Bad Bunny implemented cultural influences to make statements about corrupt, historical moments that deserve a spotlight. In his recent performance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, the musician made the most of each element in his outfit, wearing both a skirt and shirt that read “Mataron a Alexa, no un hombre con falda” (“They killed Alexa, not a man in a skirt”), to represent the wrongful death of a transgender Puerto Rican named Alexa Negrón Luciano.</p>
<p>Throughout YHLQMDLG, Bad Bunny remains consistent with raising awareness in the current political climate but also drops pure club bangers with hits such as “Safaera” and “Yo Perreo Sola.” Bad Bunny truly does what he wants; he challenges the social norm of what it means to be a man and does so while creating fun music for people to blast and dance to.</p>
