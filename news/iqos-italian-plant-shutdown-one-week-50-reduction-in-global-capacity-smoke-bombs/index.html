Philip Morris International believes there are adequate inventories of finished goods for an extended period</p>
<p>Philip Morris International Inc. (&ldquo;PMI&rdquo;) (NYSE: PM) announced today that it will implement a temporary suspension of its operations at Philip Morris Manufacturing &amp; Technology Bologna S.p.A., Italy (&ldquo;MTB&rdquo;) due to the ongoing situation regarding COVID-19. In agreement with social partners, the Company has decided to suspend production for a period of one week, out of an abundance of caution and to support the government’s efforts to limit propagation of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The Company will monitor the situation closely with a view to restarting operations as soon as possible, subject to government requirements.</p>
<p>Although several governments have mandated production facilities to temporarily suspend their operations, currently for periods from one to two weeks, PMI does not currently expect out-of-stock situations in any major operating income markets and believes consumers still have adequate access to its products.</p>
<p>As part of its ongoing business continuity plans, there are adequate inventories of PMI finished goods, on average across all markets, of over two months for heated tobacco units (&ldquo;HTUs&rdquo;), over three months for tobacco heating devices, and over one and a half months for cigarettes, based on sales trends recorded prior to the situation generated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although MTB accounted for approximately 50% of HTU production as of February 2020, PMI’s other HTU facilities currently remain operational, with an annual installed capacity of approximately 70 billion units. The above-mentioned government-mandated production suspensions affect approximately 20% of PMI’s cigarette-production capacity worldwide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this unprecedented global situation, our primary concern remains the health and safety of our colleagues, their families, and the communities in which we operate,&rdquo; said Jacek Olczak, PMI Chief Operating Officer. &ldquo;We have therefore decided to temporarily suspend operations at our facility near Bologna. We are committed to doing our part and have taken a number of steps over the last two months to protect our people and ensure continuity of supply to our customers and consumers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PMI has implemented a number of measures to protect employees in its manufacturing facilities and offices around the world, including: asking office-based employees to work from home, limiting business travel, canceling large in-person gatherings and events, restricting access to factories to essential workers, implementing temperature screening where permitted, enhancing cleaning and sanitization protocols, compartmentalizing activities, and enforcing personal protective equipment use, personal hygiene and social distancing.</p>

<p>Philip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free Future</p>
<p>Philip Morris International (PMI) is leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smoke-free future and ultimately replace cigarettes with smoke-free products to the benefit of adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, society, the company and its shareholders. PMI is a leading international tobacco company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, as well as smoke-free products and associated electronic devices and accessories, and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside the United States. In addition, PMI ships a version of its IQOS Platform 1 device and its consumables authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to Altria Group, Inc. for sale in the United States under license. PMI is building a future on a new category of smoke-free products that, while not risk-free, are a much better choice than continuing to smoke. Through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation, PMI aims to ensure that its smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements. PMI&rsquo;s smoke-free IQOS product portfolio includes heat-not-burn and nicotine-containing vapor products. As of December 31, 2019, PMI estimates that approximately 9.7 million adult smokers around the world have already stopped smoking and switched to PMI&rsquo;s heat-not-burn product, available for sale in 52 markets in key cities or nationwide under the IQOS brand.

<p><img src="https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20200313005204/en/132893/23/logo_PMI.jpg" alt="img">
LAUSANNE, Switzerland&ndash;(BUSINESS WIRE)&ndash;Philip Morris International Inc. (PMI) (NYSE: PM), a leading international tobacco company with a diverse workforce of around 73,500 people who hail from every corner of the globe, is committed to being a great employer. Demonstrating this corporate responsibility, PMI CEO André Calantzopoulos has today named Silke Muenster as its first chief diversity officer, reporting directly to him. Transitioning from her current role as vice president, Market Research at PMI, Muenster’s new position will be effective March 15, 2020, and based in the company’s operating center in Lausanne, Switzerland.</p>
<p>Focused on leading an industry-wide transformation to deliver a smoke-free future, PMI strives to be environmentally and socially responsible while maintaining operational excellence. The company has made clear its ambition to increase the representation of women in management roles across the organization to 40 percent by 2022, based on evidence that shows that companies with diversity in the workplace achieve better results and have more satisfied employees at every level. Right now, women make up 36 percent of management roles—an increase of 6 percentage points since year end 2014.</p>
<p>Calantzopoulos said: “To achieve our ambitions, we are driving toward an organization with broader perspectives, increased creativity and productivity. Silke Muenster has been a senior leader and a leading advocate for an inclusive workplace, demonstrating her ability to inspire change and action since joining PMI—anyone who knows her knows her directness, courage and forthright manner; she will challenge the senior management team to see things from a new perspective and push harder to make progress. In her new role, she will be responsible for galvanizing and building upon our Inclusion &amp; Diversity efforts, including PMI’s global EQUAL-SALARY certification, which we were the first multinational to achieve in 2019. Working with Melissa Whiting, vice president, Inclusion &amp; Diversity, Silke will bring acumen, energy and accountability to this all-important function, ensuring we recruit, hire, train and retain a high-performing diverse workforce globally.”</p>
<p>Muenster joined PMI in 2011, where she was director, Market and Consumer Research until 2012 when she became vice president, Market Research. At PMI, she is known for being incredibly proactive regarding I&amp;D—she is a coach and mentor to other women, has built a women’s network at the company and has already been working closely with SVP, People &amp; Culture, Charles Bendotti and Whiting on strategies and tactics to increase diversity and inclusion. Prior to her time at PMI, she spent 12 years in leading research roles at the Coca-Cola Company, four years at Apollinaris &amp; Schweppes and four years at Marbert Kosmetik. She began her career at Research International after earning her degree in mathematics from Ruhr University Bochum in Germany.</p>
