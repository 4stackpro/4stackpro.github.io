(CNN) Officials all over the country can&rsquo;t stop emphasizing the importance of practicing social distancing to slow down the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Now leaders in Leon County, Florida, are giving people an interesting visual to help them maintain the proper distance from others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a reminder that during COVID 19, please remember to keep at least 1 large alligator between you and everyone else at all times,&rdquo; Leon County said on Facebook</p>
<p>To slow the spread, officials are enforcing stay-at-home orders and urging citizens to practice social distancing.</p>

<h3 id="nature-reclaims-the-city-alligator-strides-through-deserted-shopping-center-in-south-carolina">Nature reclaims the city: Alligator strides through deserted shopping center in South Carolina</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/05/07/26823666-0-image-a-21_1586069262371.jpg" alt="img">
An alligator ignored suggestions to stay at home duting the coronavirus pandemic, and was seen walking around outside a shopping center in South Carolina.</p>
<p>Although there is no state-wide stay-in-order in place, there were few people around at Barefoot Landing in Myrtle Beach to scare the animal away on Wednesday</p>
<p>Clifford Sosis captured video of the alligator walking around the usually-busy shopping area - outside a Christmas ornaments store.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It appears nature is already beginning to reclaim this little bit of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina,&rsquo; Sosis can be heard saying in the video.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is a real-life gator hanging out in the middle of this otherwise busy — or usually busy — shopping center. I guess he is planning on going to Christmas Mouse. Pretty crazy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>An alligator approaches a promenade at Barefoot Landing in Myrtle Beach on Wedneday</p>
<p>The alligator is taking advantage of no stay-at-home order being in place in South Carolina</p>
<p>South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster has been reluctant to order a shelter-in-place measure for the state, but did direct all non-essential businesses to close last Wednesday.</p>
<p>And with many residents staying at home, the animal had free rein of the area.</p>
<p>The next day, Folly Beach Public Safety in South Carolina also got reports of an alligator hanging out on a beach.</p>
<p>Other states have reported animals roaming around in areas normally inhabited by humans, who are now practicing social distancing to avoid of coronavirus</p>
<p>The following day, public safety officials in South Carolina also got reports of another alligator hanging out on a beach</p>
<p>Gov McMaster has also encouraged social distancing and closed a limited amount of outdoor public spaces.</p>
<p>South Carolina is one of nine states throughout the country with no state-wide stay-at-home order in place.</p>
<p>As of April 4, South Carolina has more than 1,900 confirmed cases of coronavirus, including 40 deaths, according to the state&rsquo;s health department website.

<h3 id="baby-alligator-drugs-guns-discovered-in-florida-arrest">Baby Alligator, Drugs, Guns Discovered in Florida Arrest</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/z8xzyftb4jyxigbmflzh/alligator" alt="img">
A baby alligator, heroin, cocaine, and guns were found in a stolen car Florida police were tracking. Authorities subsequently made an arrest.</p>
<p>Seminole County Sheriff Dennis Lemma said that a deputy checked on the car’s plates, found out it was stolen and followed it, NBC-affiliated WPTV reports. That’s when the pet alligator and drugs were discovered.</p>
<p>Exotic pets have been a hot conversation topic recently, particularly following the popularity of Netflix’s docu-series Tiger King, which stars private zoo operator Joe Exotic. In a new interview on Lights Out with David Spade, Exotic’s first partner, John Finlay confirmed that seven alligators and one crocodile that burned alive inside the G.W. Exotic Animal Park in 2015 were once owned by Michael Jackson—something that hadn’t been brought up in Tiger King.</p>
<p>“The building can be replaced, the equipment can be replaced, but Michael Jackson&rsquo;s alligators cannot be replaced,” Exotic said at the time.</p>
<p>Florida is known for its strange alligator-involved incidents. In mid-December, it was discovered that a man had been eaten by an alligator over the summer after having died from a meth overdose. He was found in a canal in Fort Meade in June and was originally thought to have drowned.</p>
<p>That same month, an 11-foot alligator broke into a home in Clearwater, Florida. The animal entered the home by breaking a ground-level kitchen window, knocking over four bottles of red wine in its path.
