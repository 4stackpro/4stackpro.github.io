<p>It is now seventy years on from the commencement of the formal hostilities we know as the Korean War. But there is still plenty we get wrong about the conflict, the people who fought in it, and its continuing legacy.</p>
<p>For our Summer 2020 issue, “Korea: 70 Years On,” we asked four distinguished scholars what they see as the biggest myths and misconceptions about the war.</p>
<p>General Douglas MacArthur inspects U.S. Army troops, February 21, 1951. USIA</p>
<p>Myth/Misconception: More Than MacArthur – U.S. Intelligence Failures in Korea</p>
<p>The narrative that General Douglas MacArthur’s strategic genius won the war in the Pacific against Japan – beating overwhelming odds – remained potent after that conflict. So when President Truman directed him to lead U.S. forces to drive out the North Korean invaders, MacArthur was eager to prove it again: planning for the dramatic amphibious assault at Inchon which proved to be a stunning success.</p>
<p>MacArthur moved quickly from Inchon to complete the destruction of North Korean military units and unify the Korean peninsula, rejecting all intelligence indicating a significant Chinese intervention. His reckless race to the border left his command vulnerable to a massive surprise attack by Chinese “volunteers” which drove United Nations forces back below the 38th Parallel.</p>
<p>MacArthur’s flawed strategy is one of the main lessons that Americans have taken from the Korean War. But it represents only a small part of the story. There were other serious U.S. intelligence failures in Korea – before and after autumn 1950.</p>
<p>In August of that year, the president nominated Lieutenant General Walter Bedell Smith as Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). His assignment was to reform an overall intelligence community that had given no warning of a potential North Korean invasion, nor anticipated several previous international crises. Smith devoted two months to learning what problems he would face as both the head of CIA and the leader of the intelligence community. He concluded that one of his most immediate challenges was to gain control of a rapidly expanding range of paramilitary activities and other covert operations.</p>
<p>John Limond Hart concluded that “nearly every Korean agent he had inherited had either invented his reports or worked in secret for the communists&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Korea, the U.S. Army had launched a range of covert operations including sabotage, paramilitary attacks, and collection of intelligence on enemy movements. As commander of the Far East region, MacArthur had forbidden the CIA to function in his area. In January 1951, Smith flew to Tokyo and used the surprise Chinese intervention to persuade the imperious general to accept CIA activities in Korea. Training bases were quickly created, and large numbers of Korean agents recruited.</p>
<p>For Smith, gaining control of covert operations now involved two separate but related problems. The Joint Chiefs of Staff pressed hard to win authority over all covert operations in the combat zone. After a long bureaucratic battle, the NSC decided in October 1951 that the CIA would control all covert operations in Korea, but the military would provide the funds, equipment, and personnel for these operations under CIA direction. Army personnel were to be involved in the recruitment, training, and operations of these agents, and they had a role in making initial mission reports.</p>
<p>The DCI’s second problem was the zealous work of Frank Wisner, an OSS veteran who since 1948 had been in charge of covert operations at the CIA’s Office of Policy Coordination. His principal activity had been operations in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. By early 1951, “Wisner’s operations had multiplied fivefold since the start of the war,” asserts Tim Weiner in his book, Legacy of Ashes. He “was hiring hundreds of college kids every month, running them through a few weeks of commando school, sending them overseas for half a year, rotating them out, and sending more raw recruits to replace them.”</p>
<p>Wisner moved quickly to take advantage of the opportunity to function in Korea. One of his recruits was Donald Gregg, who would later serve as U.S. ambassador to South Korea. He later reflected – as reported by Weiner – that he “took tough Korean farm boys plucked from refugee camps, brave but undisciplined men who spoke no English, and tried to turn them into instant American intelligence agents. … It was swashbuckling of the worst kind.&rdquo; We would drop them into North Korea on poorly conceived missions, “and we’d never hear from them again.”</p>

<p>The results of these amateurish policies only got worse. During the spring and summer of 1952, Albert Haney, CIA station chief in Seoul, sent over 1,500 Korean agents into North Korea. His replacement, John Limond Hart, was suspicious of Haney’s highly positive reports to Washington. He investigated and found that Haney had used 200 American agents, none of whom spoke Korean, to recruit and manage the recruits. These agents had hired South Korean contractors to do their work. In his book, The CIA’s Russians, Hart concluded that “nearly every Korean agent he had inherited had either invented his reports or worked in secret for the communists. Every dispatch the station had sent to CIA headquarters from the front for the past eighteen months was a calculated deception.”</p>
<p>The full story of the CIA’s disastrous covert operations in Korea may never be known. The records of many subsequent reviews and investigations have been destroyed or covered up. After the war, Colonel James G.L. Kellis wrote a personal letter to President Dwight Eisenhower disclosing how this fiasco in Seoul had been covered up by the CIA and misrepresented in testimony before Congress by Allen Dulles, Wisner’s boss during the war and then CIA director. Kellis, who had served as Wisner’s director of paramilitary operations, wrote that before his testimony Dulles had been alerted that the “’CIA’s guerrillas’ in North Korea were under the control of the enemy.” Tim Weiner concludes: “The inability to penetrate North Korea remains the longest-running intelligence failure in the CIA’s history.”</p>

<p>Myth/Misconception: North Korea is a Crazy State (with Nuclear Weapons)</p>
<p>Seventy years after the start of the Korean War, North Korea is close to acquiring the game-changing capability to target the U.S. homeland with a nuclear weapon. Should war again break out on the Korean peninsula, the threat is real. The North became a nuclear weapon state in 2006, and in the subsequent years, it not only has developed and tested an intercontinental ballistic missile, but also (per U.S. intelligence) mastered the ability to miniaturize a warhead to fit atop it.</p>
<p>The vulnerability of the United States to nuclear attack is the precipitant of the current crisis with North Korea. In 2017, President Trump tweeted, “It won&rsquo;t happen,” and called North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un “a madman.”</p>
<p>President Trump also characterized North Korea as a “rogue” state – a unilateral American political term, without standing in international law, that entered the U.S. foreign policy lexicon after the Cold War. The policy lumped a disparate group of adversarial states – the Kim family’s North Korea, as well as Saddam’s Iraq, Qaddafi’s Libya, and the Ayatollahs’ Iran – whose regimes pursued weapons of mass destruction and supported terrorism.</p>
<p>The “rogue” designation has carried an important connotation—that these are essentially crazy states. As during the lead up to the Iraq War in 2003, the imputation of irrationality has been central to the argument for preventive military action to deny “rogue” regimes nuclear weapons. In 2017, when North Korea was conducting nuclear and long-range missile tests and Washington and Pyongyang were trading threats (such as Trump’s “fire and fury” tweet), then National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster asserted that “classical deterrence theory” does not “apply to a regime like the regime in North Korea.”</p>
<p>Yet North Korea’s leadership is not irrational. Its policies, which include the strategic use of brinkmanship, are based on an inner logic whose paramount interest is regime survival.</p>
<p>President Trump has characterized North Korea as a “rogue” state – a unilateral American political term, without standing in international law, that entered the U.S. foreign policy lexicon after the Cold War.</p>
<p>Though North Korea is not a crazy state, it is not an ordinary country. The North’s estimated GDP of $40 billion is dwarfed by South Korea’s $1.7 trillion. The country’s estimated caloric intake per capita of 2100 calories a day is below the 2500 recommended by the United Nations. The consequences are startling: the average five-year-old boy in North Korea is now nine centimeters shorter than his counterpart in the South.</p>
<p>North Korea’s long-running economic crisis has played out against the backdrop of two changes of leadership – Kim Il-sung, the founder of the North Korea state, to his son, Kim Jong Il, in 1994, and then to his grandson, Kim Jong-un, in 2011. North Korea’s dynastic rule is essentially a family cult. And yet North Korea – by many socio-economic indicators a failed state – is on a possible trajectory by the early 2020s to acquire a nuclear stockpile one-half the size of Britain’s or France’s arsenal!</p>
<p>In March 2018, then-CIA Director Michael Pompeo asserted that “the thing that is most dangerous” about North Korea’s advancing nuclear and missile capabilities is “the character who holds the control over them today.” The surprise Singapore summit between President Trump and “Dear Leader” Kim Jong-un in June 2018 changed the psychology of the nuclear crisis with North Korea. The initiation of a diplomatic track pushed off consideration of a U.S. military option. Kim Jong-un was now Trump’s partner in diplomacy, not the “madman” of his tweets.</p>
<p>Though the summit meeting yielded a joint statement in which the Kim regime pledged its commitment to “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” North Korea and the United States have contending definitions of denuclearization. For Pyongyang, denuclearization would essentially require the end of the U.S. nuclear umbrella for South Korea and Japan, as well as the end of the bilateral security agreement between Washington and Seoul. For Washington, it entails the transformational goal of “CVID—complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization” of North Korea. But after the U.S-led wars of regime change in Iraq in 2003 and Libya in 2011, zero nuclear warheads will simply not be on the table as long as the Kim family rules in Pyongyang.</p>

<p>As CIA Director Gina Haspel has observed, North Korea values its nuclear deterrent “as essential to … regime survival.” For North Korea, the war did not end in 1953. In addition to its deterrent function, the nuclear program is also the North’s sole essential bargaining chip—an asset to monetize through negotiations with the United States and South Korea.</p>
<p>After three summit meetings, long on ceremony and short on substance, nuclear diplomacy is stalled. If it can be revived, which it should as a matter of urgency, a key goal would go beyond North’s current moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile testing to achieve a more fundamental goal—the verified cessation of the production of weapons-usable fissile materials to cap the current arsenal, thereby preventing a bad situation from getting worse.</p>
<p>The price for such an agreement would be significant U.S. sanctions relief. The U.S. narrative would be that a freeze agreement is an incremental step toward the aspirational goal of denuclearization.</p>
<p>A former senior U.S. official once quipped: problems have solutions; dilemmas have horns. North Korea’s nuclear challenge poses a dilemma because it is embedded in the broader question of the North’s societal evolution. For the United States, managing this tension (as it works toward a negotiated freeze of North Korea’s program) will require Washington to decouple the nuclear issue from the question of regime change and rely on internal forces as the agent of societal change.</p>

<p>Myth: A Sino-North Korean Blood Alliance?</p>
<p>China’s intervention in the Korean War on October 19, 1950, saved Kim Il Sung’s regime. Yet it also has become a symbol of what has come to be called a Sino-North Korean blood alliance.</p>
<p>New research on the motivation and rationale behind China’s strategic decisions substantially weaken this argument. During the Korean War, Beijing and Pyongyang clashed over both China’s intervention and armistice negotiation, with both parties always prioritizing their own interests.</p>
<p>Before and after the founding of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in October 1949, Mao Zedong ardently opposed Kim’s desire to unify the Korean Peninsula by force. His reasoning was that the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea in June 1949 removed a security threat from the Korean Peninsula. An invasion would bring U.S. or Japanese forces back to a historic gateway for invasions of Northeast China.</p>
<p>Rapid intervention of the U.S after June 25, 1950 and its announcement of the deployment of the 7th Fleet to the Taiwan Straits seriously threatened the political foundations of the newly established PRC regime. Rumors that there would be a “regime change (Biantian Sixiang),” specifically the downfall of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) regime and the reinstatement of Chiang Kai-shek, became widespread. There was also a strong feeling that China couldn’t hold a candle to the U.S. militarily.</p>
<p>In these circumstances, Mao sought a rapid North Korean victory. On July 2, 1950, he made early intervention by Chinese troops – even without the support of Soviet air cover – a condition for China’s entry into the war. Stalin took a negative position on the matter, however, and Mao did not get his wish.</p>
<p>After the UN’s successful Inchon Landing on September 15, 1950, Mao informed Stalin and Kim Il Sung that China would not send troops. But by October 5, pressure from Stalin and the promises of direct Soviet involvement led Mao to change his mind. Yet Stalin reneged on his promises in an October 11 meeting with Zhou Enlai. Soviet air power would not come for “at least two or two and a half months,” – and would not “participate jointly in the ground operations of Chinese forces.” Even tanks and artillery offered by Stalin could not be used for six months.</p>
<p>During the Korean War, Beijing and Pyongyang clashed over both China’s intervention and armistice negotiation, with both parties always prioritizing their own interests.</p>
<p>Predictably, Mao informed Stalin the next day that China would halt the implementation of its plan to enter Korea. Yet a CCP Politburo meeting the very next day reversed this decision. Why? Fraternal feelings for North Korea?</p>
<p>Hardly. Mao explained that the possibility of securing the northern part of North Korea without fighting with the U.S forces was the deciding factor: “The U.S. and its puppet troops, concerned [by the intervention of China], would stop their advance northward and, thus, we would be able to protect the areas north of the Pyongyang-Wonsan front.” He added that “we could extend China’s defensive line from the Yalu River to the Tokchon-Yongwon line…and it will be very beneficial to us as well.” The concept of a blood alliance was absent from the beginning.</p>
<p>Armistice negotiations – and continuation of the war – created more significant disagreement between Mao and Kim.</p>
<p>With the failure of the Fifth Campaign on May 21, 1951, Mao proposed to wage guerilla warfare against the UN forces from the 38th parallel to the Pyongyang-Wonsan line, but Stalin insisted on strengthening a defensive line along the 38th parallel. Worse still, Peng Dehuai, commander-in-chief of the People’s Volunteer Army, expressed reservations about defending the Pyongyang-Wonsan line.</p>
<p>As securing a victory against UN forces became virtually impossible and risks for utter defeat grew, Mao decided to pursue an armistice negotiation on May 30. Only then did Mao inform Kim, who came to Beijing to discuss future military actions. And after negotiations began on July 10, Mao steadily pressured Kim to offer concessions. All main issues, except prisoners of war, were agreed in late November.</p>
<p>As peace loomed, Mao shifted attention to economic development. In February 1952, Mao began to draft the “First Five-Year Plan” to launch on January 1, 1953. He also requested Soviet aid for it. To Mao’s dismay, Stalin remained silent.</p>

<p>Others were punished for Mao’s ambitions and Stalin’s obduracy. Mao understood that Stalin was determined to continue the conflict in order to bind America’s hands and feet in Asia. So on April 22, Mao demanded negotiators take a hardline stance on the last issue to protract the talks for few months.</p>
<p>Yet the North had been badly damaged in the war, and Kim Il Sung wanted to accept U.S. conditions and end the conflict quickly. But Mao insisted that China and North Korea must continue the war. His change in attitude was, of course, well-received by Stalin, who subsequently promised massive aid for Chinese economic development. The unsettled issue of prisoners of war was simply a pretext for Mao to continue the war against the wishes of his ally.</p>
<p>For the most part, Mao’s key strategic decisions during the war gravely damaged North Korea’s interests. China’s decisions aimed to maximize its own position, and the ties of brotherhood or sympathy toward North Korea did not play a significant role. When ideology collided with national interests, Mao usually prioritized the latter. The evidence confirms that the widely-accepted concept of Sino-North Korean blood alliance is certainly a myth.</p>

<p>Myths: The Invasion Was a Shock / North Korean Troops Were Ideologues</p>
<p>It has been 70 years since the beginning of the Korean War. Perhaps it is still a “forgotten war,” but the two Koreas have become the center of world attention, albeit for different reasons.</p>
<p>The Republic of Korea, aka South Korea, is regarded as a mecca of 21st Century popular culture. The world has embraced K-Pop, K-Movie (including Academy Award winner Parasite), K-soap opera, Samsung mobile phones, Hyundai cars and K-test kits for coronavirus.</p>
<p>The Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea, aka North Korea, is called the “Hermit Kingdom.” It is known for its nuclear weapons, human right abuses and its young leader, Kim Jong Un.</p>
<p>Korea was divided into South and North in 1948. This partition set in motion what we know as the Korean War – one of the most tragic conflicts in the history of the peninsula. Korean War historiography developed as a part of the Cold War historiography. It has traditionalists, revisionists and post-revisionists. The opening of primary sources in China and Russia since the early 1990&rsquo;s has helped create new studies on the Korean War, introducing new aspects of the conflict. It has also helped us see uniquely Korean aspects of the war that go beyond viewing it merely as a proxy war between superpowers.</p>
<p>What common misconceptions of the Korean War still linger? Let me dispel two key myths.</p>
<p>First, we remember 2020 as the 70th anniversary of the Korean War.</p>
<p>But the conflict did not start on June 25, 1950. And the invasion that is being remembered this year did not come as a shock to Koreans.</p>
<p>The typical narrative of the Korean War is that shelling by the Korean People&rsquo;s Army (KPA)&lsquo;s field artillery on that day 70 years ago was a tactical move that surprised the Korean people. This is wrong. The invasion made the Korean people feel not shock, but desperation. It was the misery of knowing that conventional war had finally arrived.</p>
<p>Historians such as Allan Millett define the Korean War in three stages: a first war was from 1948 to June 25, 1950; a second war was from June 25, 1950 until the intervention of Chinese Volunteer Forces in late 1950; and a third war from that intervention to the armistice on July, 1953. Historian Bruce Cumings&rsquo; excellent insight about the trajectory of the conflict is key: the Korean Peninsula was already in a state of war long before June 25, 1950, and battling internal problems including pro-Japanese collaboration, land reform and other issues.</p>
<p>The conflict did not start on June 25, 1950. And the invasion that is being remembered this year did not come as a shock to Koreans.</p>
<p>To extend this point further: The Korean people had already suffered many casualties and conflicts for two years before June 25, 1950. Hundreds of thousands of Koreans lost their lives in diverse conflicts after the 1948 partition, including the Yeosu-Suncheon Rebellion in October 1948, the Jeju uprisings in 1948 and 1949, and numerous conflicts near the 38th Parallel.</p>
<p>Survivors remember the Yeosu-Suncheon rebellion as a greater nightmare than the Korean War itself. More than three thousand people, including young children, died in it. Sixty thousand people, including more young children, died during the Jeju uprisings. Neither one of these events was conflict on a small scale. Nor did they have a smaller death toll than many battles in the Korean War. So the KPA invasion in June 1950 was no surprise. Not in the least.</p>
<p>The second myth is about North Koreans. Films, novels and newspapers are filled with images of the KPA as ideological robots – armed with weapons from the Soviet Union and brainwashed by Kim Il Sung&rsquo;s dictatorship and Marxism.</p>
<p>“A letter to special someone far away&rdquo; – a document from the National Archives collection (RG 242) of captured writings by North Korean soldiers. National Archives and Records Administration &ndash; Photo by Yee Rem Kim</p>
<p>Again, this is a serious misconception. It is true that most of commanders&rsquo; positions in the KPA were filled by veterans of the Korean Volunteer Army – soldiers with firm ideological beliefs who had fought with Mao&rsquo;s Army against the Chinese Nationalists in China. These high-ranking officers had rich experiences before they entered the KPA, where they developed ambitions and made political connections.</p>
<p>But most of the KPA was comprised of young Korean recruits. They were ordinary sons of poor peasant families who wanted middle class jobs. How do we know? You can find their letters to their parents, and application forms, including their family and education background and personnel notes in National Archives Record Group 242 in the U.S. National Archives.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army captured these documents and sent them to Washington DC when they advanced north to Pyongyang and beyond. These primary sources are a window into the personal stories and backgrounds of young KPA soldiers. What did they want from their lives? What were their dreams? Marxism and Leninism were new to them, and they did not care about ideology. These ordinary young soldiers regarded the KPA as a job to feed their families.</p>
<p>The Korean War is not ended. The Korean Peninsula is the final stage of the Cold War. Recent denuclearization talks are significant because they give a voice to forgotten ordinary victims. They reveal people as human beings, outside the politicization of history. Unfortunately, Cold War rhetoric still dominates in films, novels, scholarship and media about the Korean War. It is time to focus on the stories of human beings, without using an ideological lens.</p>

<p><img src="https://assets.americanrifleman.org/media/3626854/men-guns-of-korean-war-2020-f.jpg?preset=socialShare" alt="img">
by Mark A. Keefe - Friday, June 12, 2020</p>
<p>Today, it is called the “Forgotten War.“ But the Korean War, which began on June 25, 1950, and lasted until July 27, 1953, will not be forgotten by those who fought it, and it will not be forgotten here.</p>
<p>When the North Korean People‘s Army crossed the 38th Parallel on June 25, 1950, it took the Western world by surprise. Backed by T-34 tanks, the North Korean People&rsquo;s Army rapidly overwhelmed and overran the Republic of Korea (ROK) forces. The Republic of Korea forces had no tanks or heavy weapons for political reasons.</p>
<p>Men of the 24th Infantry Division pictured at the 38th Parallel in April 1951.</p>
<p>Following a United Nations Security Council resolution, American troops, primarily from the 24th Infantry Division, were flown into Korea and engaged in combat against the North Koreans by July 1950.</p>
<p>Those first American troops had been on garrison duty in Japan, and they included my father-in-law, Joe Kocik. They did not have the arms and equipment to hold against the North Koreans. Seoul was lost.</p>
<p>A U.S. Soldier inspects an abandoned SU-76 self-propelled gun in November 1950. He is armed with an M1 Garand.</p>
<p>They and the remnants of the ROK army were forced into a perimeter south to a peninsula that came to be known as the Pusan Perimeter.</p>
<p>The small arms used by the Americans in the early battles of the Korean War, including in Gen. Douglas MacArthur’s brilliant landing at Inchon in September 1950, were the same guns used to win World War II against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.</p>
<p>A Soldier from the 25th Infantry Division reads a letter from home in April 1951. At his side is the M1 Garand.</p>
<p>As the Marines landed at Inchon and the Eighth Army, including the 1st Cavalry Division, attacked out of the Pusan Perimeter, it resulted in the near destruction of the North Korean People’s Army.</p>
<p>The war took a turn when Chinese communist forces came across the Yalu River from in October 1950, pushing United Nations forces back into South Korea.</p>
<p>A United States Marine takes aim with his M1 Garand during the Korean War.</p>
<p>The standard service rifle for American troops during the Korean War was the “U.S. Rifle, Caliber .30, M1,” better-known as the M1 Garand. Due to the rapid mobilization of the Army and Marine Corps, guns were pulled out of storage, stripped of their cosmoline and put back into the hands of American troops.</p>
<p>Because of the demand created by the Korean War, M1 Garand production had to be ramped up at Springfield, Harrington &amp; Richardson and International Harvester, creating a collection of M1s known as the &ldquo;Post-WWII Garands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A U.S. Soldier takes aim from behind cover with his M1A1 Carbine</p>
<p>A firearm that has become iconic in the imagery of the Korean War is the “U.S. Carbine, Caliber .30, M2.” Although semi-automatic-only M1 Carbines were issued during the war, the M2 Carbine, as manufactured by Inland Division of General Motors and Winchester, included conversion parts that allowed for select-fire operation.</p>
<p>In addition to purpose-built M2 Carbines, many M1 Carbines were upgraded to a select-fire configuration, like this known example used by Medal of Honor recipient Alford L. McLaughlin. These lightweight, compact carbines entered the battlefields of Korea, where they offered much more firepower in their select-fire configuration than the semi-auto-only M1 had offered during WWII.</p>
<p>A Soldier of the 2nd Infantry Division equipped with an M1 Carbine in Yongsan.</p>
<p>The M2 carbine had gone through a series of upgrades to get to the configuration that is well-known during the Korean War, which included a barrel band with a bayonet lug, round bolt, low wood, a flip safety and a fully adjustable rear sight.</p>
<p>Perhaps most iconic of the M2 Carbine is the 30-round detachable magazine, with its distinct banana curve, which was no doubt appreciated, due the M2’s high cyclic rate and the limited capacity of the 15-round magazines that were primary issue for almost all of WWII.</p>
<p>This Soldier from the 7th Infantry Division shown in April 1951 has an M2 Carbine equipped with the distinctive 30-round magazine.</p>
<p>The Model of 1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, which had been heavily modified by the U.S. Ordnance Department over the years into its M1918A2 configuration, was the standard squad automatic weapon today.</p>
<p>Designed by John Moses Browning for the United States before World War I, it picked up weight and features from its original role as a “machine rifle.”</p>
<p>A Soldier of the 25th Infantry Division shown with an M1918A2 BAR in 1952.</p>
<p>The wooden buttstock had been replaced with a synthetic one, guides had been added to the magazine well, the rear sight changed to a simpler design and a bipod was added, as well as a new flash hider.</p>
<p>The fire-control components had been changed to fire at two cyclic rates, “slow“ and “fast.&rdquo; Despite the horrific climate experienced by the troops during the Korean War, the M1918A2 BAR performed well.</p>
<p>A United States Marine takes an opportunity to clean up outside Changjang-Ni in February 1952. His BAR is within arm&rsquo;s reach.</p>
<p>Although declared obsolete, the M1928A1, M1 and M1A1 Thompson submachine guns were present, but they had been officially superseded by the M3 “Grease Gun.” There is anecdotal evidence that some Thompsons were taken off Communist dead and put back into service with American combat troops.</p>
<p>It was because of the Korean War that the M3A1 submachine gun went into production at Ithaca. The company is better-known for its shotguns, but it became the only maker of the M3A1 &ldquo;Grease Gun&rdquo; during the Korean War.</p>
<p>A Marine fires his M3 &ldquo;Grease Gun&rdquo; in the battle for Seoul in 1950.</p>
<p>When it came to machine guns, the U.S. Military used the same guns that won WW II. They included the Browning belt-feds, with the big boy of them all being the Browning .50 BMG M2 air-cooled machine gun, used both on vehicles and on its ground tripod.</p>
<p>There was also much use made of the Browning M1919A4 on its M2 tripod, as well as the M1919A6 with its bipod and buttstock, which entered combat service in 1944.</p>
<p>U.S. Marines man a defensive line in December 1951. The troops in the foreground are behind a Browning M1919A4 machine gun, while the Marine in the background is armed with a Browning Automatic Rifle.</p>
<p>The water-cooled, tripod-mounted Browning M1917A1 also played a role as perhaps the most ideal machine gun for stopping the human-wave attacks of the North Koreans and, later in 1950, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army.</p>
<p>Its water-cooled configuration meant it could fire continuously for long periods of time without requiring barrel changes, unlike many of the lighter, air-cooled machine guns of the time.</p>
<p>A Soldier from the 25th Infantry Division mans a water-cooled M1917A1 machine gun during the Korean War.</p>
<p>After the Chinese entered the war, perhaps the most grueling task of any Soldier or Marine during the war came in North Korea at places like the Chosin Reservoir, as well as the retreat that followed. You can read about the guns used in the Chosin Reservoir battle here.</p>
<p>It was the most severe test of American troops and their arms. As United Nation’s forces were pushed back out of North Korea and the lines eventually stabilized—despite repeated offensives from both sides—there was considerable use of sniper rifles.</p>
<p>A sniper from the 1st Cavalry Division is shown in March 1951 with an M1D Garand, complete with an M81 or M82 riflescope in a Griffin &amp; Howe mount.</p>
<p>These included both the sniper versions of the M1 Garand rifle, both the M1C and, in more numbers, the M1D, but the Springfield Model of 1903 was also used.</p>
<p>The standard sniping rifle of the WWII U.S. Army was the M1903A4, which was a Model 1903A3 Springfield with a turned-down bolt handle, a Redfield Junior mount and a Weaver scope. The Marine Corps also clung to the Model 1903 during the Korean War, using M1903A1 rifles topped with Unertl scopes.</p>
<p>A Soldier from the U.S. 89th Tank Battalion takes cover behind a Sherman tank in 1951. His M1 rifle is equipped with a flash hider.</p>
<p>Among UN forces, British snipers used the excellent Lee-Enfield No. 4 Mk I(T) sniper rifle, Our Australian allies used versions of the Lithgow No. 1, Mark III with Heavy (H) barrels to great effect. You can read the account of one Australian sniper Ian Robertson here, as it demonstrates exactly how effective these rifles were.</p>
<p>Many of the United Nations troops used American arms—including the British use of the Garand—but those from Luxembourg and Belgium brought a new rifle to the battlefield. The Fabrique Nationale FN-49 or ABL, designed by Dieudionne Saive, was the forerunner of the FN FAL, and an excellent rifle in its own right.</p>
<p>U.S. Marines armed with M1 Carbines are shown holding the recovered flag from the U.S. Consulate in Seoul, South Korea on September 27, 1950.</p>
<p>For handguns, the Americans relied on the U.S. Model 1911A1 pistol in .45 ACP, although there is evidence of limited use of M1917 and Smith &amp; Wesson Victory revolvers being used as well. When it came to our allies, guns such as the Browning Hi Power and even the Enfield No. 2 revolver in .380/200 were used.</p>
<p>Regardless of the firearms they carried, it was the bravery and determination of our troops and their allies that fought the forces of Communism to a standstill and an armistice that remains in place to this day.</p>
<p>To those veterans of the “Forgotten War,” we salute you. You are not forgotten. We appreciate your service, valor and sacrifice. We remember.</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Gloucester-Soldier-Small-e1589970305652.jpg?fit=1200%2C911&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
The town of Gloucester, in southwest England, received a surprise gift from Paju in South Korea last week: 1,000 sets of personal protective equipment, or PPE.</p>
<p>Given that South Korea has effectively managed the novel coronavirus pandemic at a cost of only 263 lives, while the United Kingdom is struggling with a death count of 35,422, British officials were emotive in their responses.</p>
<p>“I am struggling to find the words that sufficiently express my gratitude,” Gloucester Mayor Colin Organ wrote in a letter to his Paju counterpart, Mayor Choi Jong-whan.</p>
<p>“I am deeply touched by the spirit and generosity of our friends in Paju,” added British Ambassador to Seoul Simon Smith.</p>
<p>“This is such an unexpected and generous gift across time and place,” said Edward Gillespie, Lord Lieutenant of Gloucestershire, the country which surrounds Gloucester. “Friends in need will never forget this. Massively appreciated.”</p>
<p>“Paju has been through challenging times coping with Covid-19. However, we are coming close to a stabilized situation,” Paju Mayor Choi Jong-whan said in a video message sent to Gloucester. “As a token of our commitment to sharing the pains of the novel virus, to the citizens of Gloucester, I am sending you protective clothing filled with the sincerity of the people of Paju.”</p>
<p>Gloucester, a medieval market town in southwest England, is separated from Paju, a city between Seoul and the DMZ, by more than 8,000 miles. However, the gift of PPE is the latest landmark in a relationship forged between Gloucester and Paju that dates back to the 1950-1953 Korean War.</p>
<p>Surprise attack</p>
<p>In April 1951, the sector just south of Paju’s Imjin River was held by a battalion of soldiers from Gloucestershire. There was an operational lull in a ferocious war that had broken out in June 1950 and sucked in forces from the free world and China, fighting, respectively, on the sides of South and North Korea.</p>
<p>But with the winter over, the campaigning season had returned. After dark on April 22, Chinese forces unleashed a surprise attack, a massive offensive across a 30-mile front.</p>
<p>South of the Imjin, intense midnight combat, fought at traumatically close range, surged across the rugged hills and ridges. Cut off from the rest of the United Nations force, the Gloucester men, outnumbered 9-1, were gradually cut down as they battled to hold the Chinese “human wave.”</p>
<p>As the sun sank on April 24, the decimated battalion was surrounded but still defiant as it dug in for a back-to-back defense of the summit of Hill 235. It would be their last stand. After fighting to the last round, the Gloucester soldiers were overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Subsequently dubbed “The Battle of the Imjin River” after the key geographical landmark nearby, intelligence analyses would show that the Gloucester men had held the key breakthrough point against what would prove to be the largest Chinese offensive of the war.</p>
<p>With the Chinese Peoples Volunteers Army being largely reliant upon porter logistics, they could only sustain an offensive for one week, at most. That made the stand made by the British soldiers at the shock, outset of the Chinese offensive, of strategic significance.</p>
<p>The overall battle remains the bloodiest action fought by British troops since World War II.</p>
<p>A small British Korean War memorial has been carved into the base of Hill 235 since the 1950s. However, a brand new memorial – built at a cost of almost US$1 million, all collected in donations from Paju citizens – was put in place in 2014.</p>
<p>Since then, a suspended footbridge for hikers that crosses a dramatic valley in the rear of the old British positions has been named “The Heroes of Gloucester” bridge.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Gloucester, a NATO base outside the city is named “Imjin Barracks” and a lane in the town has been dubbed “Paju Walk.” A Celtic cross, hand-carved of North Korean granite by the Gloucester battalion commander while in a POW camp, hangs in Gloucester Cathedral.</p>
<p>Addressing the handful of surviving veterans of the epic action, Choi said in his video message – filmed at the memorial: “You contributed much to the Republic of Korea when you participated in the war as young soldiers … now, with the passage of time, you have become legendary soldiers.”</p>

<p>Looking ahead</p>
<p>With this year marking the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War, Gloucester VIPs and serving British Army units had been scheduled to join Seoul and Paju dignitaries at the memorial this year.</p>
<p>However, Covid-19 put paid to these plans. Instead, the revisit has been put back to April 2021 – the 70th anniversary of the battle.</p>
<p>“We hope that we will roll the whole 2020 visit forward a year, to be there on the 70th anniversary of the battle itself,” Chris Ryland, chairman of the Soldiers of Gloucester Museum, told Asia Times. “It will be the whole combination of military and civilians, and we are hoping to do a live TV link of the ceremony back to the UK.”</p>
<p>Paju and Gloucester hope to extend their ties to areas such as school exchanges and sports. Meanwhile, the Paju PPE, which arrived in Gloucester last week, is being put to specific use, Ryland – who said he was “bowled over” by Paju’s gift – explained.</p>
<p>“We are making sure if goes to care workers in care homes for the elderly who are from the generation of the soldiers that fought in the Korean War,” he said. “It connects to their needs.”</p>

<p>Mask diplomacy</p>
<p>While the Paju-Gloucester interaction was a city-city affair, at the national level, South Korea is extending mask diplomacy to its oldest friends around the world: Korean War veterans who are now in their 80s and 90s, making them highly vulnerable to Covid-19.</p>
<p>Seoul announced last week that it would be sending gifts to Korean War veterans still alive in the 22 “sending states” that made up the UN Command which helped defend South Korea in the 1950-1953 war.</p>
<p>The UN Command was led by the United States, which deployed the largest contingent of troops in the war, followed by the UK. South Korea’s Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs estimates that there are 400,000 UN Command veterans still alive around the world, in nations as distant as Columbia and Belgium, Australia and Turkey, Ethiopia and Thailand.</p>
<p>The first shipment of masks was dispatched to the US on May 8 by South Korean Air Force transport plane. About 500,000 masks are going to the US and 40,000 to the UK. Distribution is being overseen by the Korean diplomatic missions in the countries.</p>
<p>In total, one million masks will be supplied worldwide, “to express our gratitude to Korean War veterans,” said Kim Eun-gi, the Chairman of Seoul’s Korean War 70th Commemoration Committee, in televised remarks.
