<p>World concern for Covid-19 Focuses on Cuba&rsquo;s Interferon</p>
<p>27 de marzo de 2020, 11:4</p>
<p>Havana, Mar 27 (Prensa Latina) Cuba&rsquo;s Recombinant Human Interferon Alpha 2B is currently a hope for the world, which shows its concern about the lethality and spread of the coronavirus, SARS-Cov-2, which causes Covid-19 disease.</p>
<p>Amid the fight against this disease, declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, more than 45 countries requested this drug produced in Cuba for its proven antiviral properties.</p>
<p>Since its introduction more than three decades ago in the national health system, this medicine has shown its efficacy and safety in the therapy of viral diseases such as Hepatitis B and C, Herpes zoster (popularly called shingles) and HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>Its choice by the Chinese medical authorities to fight the novel coronavirus is due to the fact that these viruses generally decrease the natural production of interferon in the human body and the Cuban drug is capable of supplying such deficiency, strengthening the immune system of patients afflicted by the aforementioned respiratory ailment.</p>
<p>Interferon Alpha 2B received in 2012 the National Technological Innovation Prize, granted by the Ministry of Science, Technology and the Environment and the National Prize, Granma newspaper states.</p>

<h3 id="covid-19-medicine-indias-communist-ruled-kerala-to-get-coronavirus-wonder-drug-interferon-from-cuba">COVID 19 medicine: India&rsquo;s Communist-ruled Kerala to get coronavirus wonder drug Interferon from Cuba</h3>
<p><img src="https://data.ibtimes.sg/en/full/34494/coronasur-indians-burn-effigy-coronavirus-monster.jpg" alt="img">
The only Communist-ruled state in India - Kerala, which has a high number of coronavirus (COVID 19) cases is expected to receive the &lsquo;wonder drug&rsquo; from Cuba that can cure the deadly Wuhan virus.</p>
<p>If all goes as per the plans of the Kerala-state government, the local authorities will import the widely touted &lsquo;wonder drug&rsquo; Interferon from Cuba in a few days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We discussed the possibility of importing the medicine from Cuba, in the Cabinet meeting today. We will approach the Drug Controller for this,&rsquo;&rsquo; Kerala-based news magazine - The Week reported quoting the Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.</p>
<p>The Cuban &lsquo;wonder drug&rsquo; has been making headlines in the past few weeks, especially after it emerged that the coronavirus cure - developed jointly by Cuba and China, has proved its efficacy in treating critical cases in Wuhan - the epicenter of coronavirus outbreak in China.</p>
<p>The drug, called Interferon Alpha-2B Recombinant (IFNrec) was brought to China by the Cuban Medical Brigades, who since January have been assisting the Chinese in containing the deadly virus that till now has infected over 6.5 million people across the globe. Also known as the Wuhan virus, the COVID 19 strain has killed more than 30,000 and has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>The use of Interferon Alpha-2B Recombinant &ldquo;prevents aggravation and complications in patients reaching that stage that ultimately can result in death,&rdquo; a recent Yale University Press Blog feature written by the University of Glasgow&rsquo;s Helen Yaffe said citing Cuban biotech expert Luis Herrera Martinez.</p>
<p>Yaffe, who spoke to Newsweek called the treatment a potential &ldquo;wonder drug&rdquo; against the new coronavirus (COVID 19) and revealed that at least 15 countries were in touch with Cuba to get hold of the possible COVID 19 medicine.</p>
<p>Coronavirus in India</p>
<p>India now has over 1,000 cases, however, the number is expected to rise as the country is yet to take up mass testing. The Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi has ordered a completely shut down the country and citizens have been asked to stay indoors.</p>
<p>The South Indian state of Kerala reported the first coronavirus case in the country on January 30 and as of March 28, there were 182 confirmed COVID 19 cases and more than 1,15,000 people were put under isolation.

<h3 id="south-african-mayor-incorrect-about-covid-19-vaccine">South African mayor incorrect about Covid-19 ‘vaccine’</h3>
<p><img src="https://africacheck.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cuba_incorrect.png" alt="img">
Experts stressed that misinformation during the coronavirus crisis would only work against efforts to slow the spread of the pandemic.</p>
<p>He appears to have been referring to interferon alpha-2b, a drug used to treat the symptoms of diseases caused by some earlier strains of coronavirus. But it’s not a vaccine that would prevent Covid-19.</p>
<p>Mzwandile Masina, mayor of the City of Ekurhuleni, said he would use emergency funds “to procure the vaccine Inferon B from Cuba” to help fight the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>Explainer: Interferon alpha-2b has been used to treat some earlier strains of coronavirus, but it’s not a vaccine that would prevent people from getting Covid-19.</p>
<p>South Africa went into lockdown on 27 March 2020, as the government tries to control the spread of the new coronavirus. There are now more than 900 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the country, with two deaths.</p>
<p>When president Cyril Ramaphosa announced the lockdown he said “immediate, swift and extraordinary action is required if we are to prevent a human catastrophe of enormous proportions”.</p>
<p>But the City of Ekurhuleni’s executive mayor, Mzwandile Masina, had another solution to the pandemic. In his 18 March state of the city address, he proposed using the municipality’s emergency funds “to procure the vaccine Inferon B from Cuba”.</p>
<p>Masina did not respond to our numerous requests for evidence of a “vaccine”. So Africa Check went looking.</p>
<p>Currently no vaccine for Covid-19</p>
<p>Vaccines are a treatment to prevent disease, explains the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Vaccines contain the same germs that cause disease … But they have been either killed or weakened to the point that they don’t make you sick.”</p>
<p>The CDC adds: “A vaccine stimulates your immune system to produce antibodies, exactly like it would if you were exposed to the disease. After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first.”</p>
<p>According to the World Health Organization, there are still “no specific vaccines or treatments for Covid-19”.</p>
<p>“Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat Covid-19,” says the organisation.</p>
<p>Infectious disease specialist Dr Evan Shoul, who practices at Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg, told Africa Check that in the best case scenario a candidate vaccine for Covid-19 is expected in 12 to 18 months.</p>
<p>‘Interferon B’ not a vaccine</p>
<p>Masina referred to “Inferon B” as a vaccine in his speech but an official transcript of the address mentions “Interferon B”.</p>
<p>He also tweeted a photo a few hours before delivering the speech, captioned “Interferon B”, of boxes of interferon alpha-2b. This is a man made form of an interferon, a substance produced in various forms by the human immune system. Interferon alpha-2b is a cytokine.</p>
<p>“That’s a chemical produced by the white blood cells, your immune cells, that helps to protect you against infection including viruses,” said immunologist Dr Elizabeth Mayne, who works at South Africa’s National Health Laboratory Service and the University of the Witwatersrand.</p>
<p>But interferon alpha-2b, according to Mayne, is “definitively not a vaccine”. “There is no good scientific data to show that it will protect you from getting the infection.”</p>
<p>Drug being produced by Cuba</p>
<p>The day before Masina made his claim, Cuba’s foreign affairs ministry released a statement that “there is no preventive vaccine or specific treatment, at this time, for the new coronavirus”.</p>
<p>It said, however, that it was producing interferon alpha-2b “in addition to another group of drugs that are included in protocols for treating patients with this disease and the complications that may arise”.</p>
<p>Interferon alpha-2b and other interferons have been used to treat previous strains of coronavirus because of their ability to boost cells’ natural defence mechanisms. They were used during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars-CoV) outbreak. Sars-CoV is a coronavirus that has been shown to share similarities with the 2019 coronavirus.</p>
<p>But the treatment can have serious side effects. The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists has said: “Almost all patients experience adverse effects at some time during the course of interferon alfa therapy.”</p>
<p>Mayne described the common side effects as: “All of the things that make you feel pretty miserable when you have the flu: the tiredness, the fatigue, not wanting to eat, things like that”. The side effects of interferon therapy mean that “a lot of people actually can’t take it”.</p>
<p>No data to support use of interferons</p>
<p>The online medical tool BMJ Best Practice has stated at time of writing (archive here) that while substances such as interferon alpha are being used to treat the new coronavirus, “there are no data to support their use”. The website is a collection of recommendations compiled by expert medical editors and based on published, peer-reviewed studies.</p>
<p>Current and future clinical trials may show that interferon treatment is effective. But Milpark Hospital’s Shoul said there was no reason for Ekurhuleni to buy the drug, and that it was unlikely to be useful.</p>
<p>Instead, he advised people to follow guidelines from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases. It was important “to have one focal point for information” to make sure that people do not receive conflicting information and become unsure of what to trust.</p>
<p>Mayne had a similar message. “Any misinformation in a crisis is going to be counterproductive,” she said. “It confuses people, and it diverts time away from what we should be concentrating on, which is reinforcing the NICD guidelines.”</p>
<p>Conclusion : Interferon alpha-2b is not a vaccine for the new coronavirus.</p>
<p>South African mayor Mzwandile Masina said in his state of the city address that there was a “vaccine” for Covid-19 called interferon alpha-2b.</p>
<p>This is incorrect – the drug is not a vaccine that would prevent Covid-19. It has been used to treat previous strains of coronavirus. While it is being considered as a possible treatment for the new virus there are no definitive results from clinical trials.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization says there are currently “no specific vaccines or treatments for Covid-19.” Possible vaccines and drug treatments are being tested in clinical trials.</p>
<p>It’s important that we only get information on Covid-19 and its treatments from credible sources. These include the World Health Organization and, in South Africa, the Department of Health, the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and the official government Covid-19 portal.</p>
