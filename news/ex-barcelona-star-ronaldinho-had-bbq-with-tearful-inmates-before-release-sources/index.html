After serving 32 days for being accused of an adulterated passport he has now been placed into house arrest. (1:17)</p>
<p>Inmates were in tears as they held a barbecue to say goodbye to Ronaldinho this week after the former Brazil star was placed on house arrest following 32 days in a Paraguayan prison, sources have told ESPN.</p>
<p>Ronaldinho and his brother Roberto Assis, who is also his business manager, were incarcerated in Paraguay since March 6 for attempting to enter the country with falsified passports, even though residents of Brazil do not need passports to enter their landlocked neighbour.</p>

<p>They had been denied bail three times previously but on Tuesday a judge granted them house arrest in exchange for a bail payment of $1.6 million.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a significant bail in cash to guarantee they will not flee,&rdquo; judge Gustavo Amarilla said.</p>
<p>The 2002 World Cup winner will be placed under police custody at a four-star hotel in the Paraguayan capital, Asuncion. A date for a new trial has not yet been set because of delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The decision was relayed via a video call due to the health crisis and they will be allowed to receive visits in the hotel. Sources told ESPN they have already arranged for their mother to come and see them as soon as the borders re-open.</p>
<p>Once the news reached the inmates at the detention unit in Asuncion, sources have explained how they hastily arranged a goodbye barbecue for Ronaldinho and his brother.</p>
<p>The former Barcelona forward had become a popular figure at the facility. Sources told ESPN he was &ldquo;loved&rdquo; by his fellow prisoners at the jail, where daily activities included playing football with the inmates and the employees and attending a carpentry course.</p>

<p>He has promised to return to visit them before he heads back to Brazil, although it is unclear when that will be possible. The probe into the falsified passports has expanded into an investigation into possible money laundering.</p>
<p>According to the prosecution, at the centre of the operation is Dalia Lopez, the businesswoman who arranged Ronaldinho&rsquo;s visit and who met him on arrival at the airport in Asuncion before he was detained.</p>
<p>A source familiar with the case told Reuters in March that the &ldquo;hypothesis is that the false documents used by the brothers were eventually going to be used for some commercial means or investments that were not legal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As part of the wider investigation, Ronaldinho and his brother had their mobile phones confiscated so that investigators could review files and messages on the phones. The phones were returned last week.</p>
<p>The lawyer who represents the brothers has called their detention &ldquo;arbitrary, abusive and illegal&rdquo; and sources close to Ronaldinho have said he has been caught up in a &ldquo;political game&rdquo; and remain hopeful that he and his brother will soon be allowed to return home to Brazil.

<h3 id="brazil-legend-ronaldinho-staying-at-a-four-star-hotel-while-he-remains-under-investigation-for-fraud">Brazil legend Ronaldinho staying at a four-star hotel while he remains under investigation for fraud</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/08/18/26964850-0-image-a-12_1586365459947.jpg" alt="img">
Barcelona and Brazil legend Ronaldinho has been ordered to stay under house arrest - but will reside in a presidential suite at a luxurious four-star hotel after being released from prison in Paraguay.</p>
<p>He remains under investigation for passport fraud following his and his brother Roberto&rsquo;s arrest on March 6 after allegedly entering Paraguay on fake passports that said they had Paraguayan citizenship.</p>
<p>They were facing a jail term of six months, but after reportedly paying a £1.3million bond, the 40-year-old has been put on house arrest at the Palmaroga hotel in the country&rsquo;s capital of Asuncion.</p>
<p>Ronaldinho has been ordered to stay under house arrest at the four-star Palmaroga hotel</p>
<p>The news comes after the former Brazil star was released from prison this week</p>
<p>He remains under investigation for passport fraud following his and his brother arrest in March</p>
<p>And it appears only the best places in the city will do for the Brazilian, with the hotel&rsquo;s presidential suite boasting its own balcony, 55 inch smart TV, as well as a whirlpool bath and spacious kitchenette.</p>
<p>Ronaldinho will also be receiving five-star room service, while his brother is believed to be in the executive suite, which is located two doors down from the presidential suite.</p>
<p>The hotel&rsquo;s luxuries do not end their however, as built on its rooftoop is a beautiful swimming pool, while the bar serves vintage cocktails for guests.</p>
<p>The four-star Palmaroga Hotel is among the best in Paraguay&rsquo;s capital city of Asuncion</p>
<p>And Brazil legend Ronaldinho will be staying in the hotel&rsquo;s £87-per-night presidential suite</p>
<p>The coronavirus crisis has meant that those communal areas are said to be out of action for the time being.</p>
<p>And the financial impact of the pandemic has also been shown, with the cost of the presidential suite for a night around £87-per-night, three times lower than the suite&rsquo;s usual price with discounts being offered due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>The hotel as a whole is part of a 19th century building, and offers incredible views of the Bay of Asuncion.</p>
<p>The former Barcelona and AC Milan star will also be receiving excellent room service</p>
<p>The hotel&rsquo;s rooftop has a stunning swimming pool and has great views of the Bay of Asuncion</p>
<p>Ronaldinho and his brother were granted permission to stay at the hotel for the mean time by judge Gustavo Amarilla, with his case still being decided and the player&rsquo;s lawyers attempting to appeal the decision to jail him.</p>
<p>It had been argued that he should be spared from facing prison due to his high-profile status as a former footballer, with his legal team saying his detention was &lsquo;arbitrary, abusive and illegal&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Ronaldinho, who last played for Brazilian outfit Fluminense in 2015, denied using a forged passport, with the former World Cup winner insisting he didn&rsquo;t know he had committed an offence.</p>
<p>Most of the communal spaces however appear to be closed due to the coronavirus crisis</p>
<p>His own lawyer Adolfo Marin said the former player had been &lsquo;stupid&rsquo; and criticised the courts for not taking into account his mistake.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The courts have not taken into account the fact that Ronaldinho didn&rsquo;t know he was committing a crime, because he didn&rsquo;t understand he had been given false documents. He is stupid.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Despite his fall from grace, Ronaldinho has been making the most of his time behind bars and was seen taking part in a football competition and helping his side win.</p>
<p>He recently turned 40 and had to spend his birthday in prison, but the prisoners ensured he still had a smile on his face as they baked him a cake and prepared him a barbecue.</p>
<p>At the height of his career, Ronaldinho was one of the most gifted players in world football</p>
<p>His period in jail was a huge fall from grace for the Brazil legend, who won the 2002 World Cup</p>
<p>He has struggled to stay away from the limelight as his career began to wind down - and mostly for the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>In 2015, he and his brother were convicted of illegally building a fishing trap at Lake Guaiba without proper licensing in a permanent preservation area.</p>
<p>The pair were handed a £6.9m fine in 2018 which so far remains unpaid, leading Brazil&rsquo;s Superior Court of Justice to seize Ronaldinho&rsquo;s passport. And financial worries came to light after he was stopped from selling 57 of his properties due to the outstanding debts.</p>
<p>And in 2018 he was dubbed sexist by some after he reportedly married two wives, with one of them leaving the former star, citing aggression and opened a legal case to take one third of his earnings from 2012 to 2018 after the pair failed to reach a separation agreement in private.</p>
<p>At the height of his football career he won one Ballon D&rsquo;or and two FIFA World Player of the Year awards, clinching two LaLiga titles and a Champions League crown with Barcelona, and also lifted the World Cup with Brazil in 2002.

Ronaldinho avoided a slide tackle with the ease of a man sidestepping a turd</p>
<p>Nostalgia</p>
<p>Share</p>
<p>We’re in lockdown and there’s no football to keep us entertained, so Tom Victor is watching back old games to search for the kind of insignificant moments we usually write about on a Monday morning. First, a moment of Ronaldinho genius from October 2005.</p>
<p>When Ronaldinho wants to run a game, there’s no stopping him. You can only wait it out and attempt to salvage something once he’s got bored of leaving you flailing.</p>
<p>Deportivo La Coruna discovered this when the Brazilian maestro spent more than an hour making the Riazor his own personal playground.</p>
<p>The hosts clawed their way back to earn a 3-3 draw they may well be satisfied with, but Manuel Pablo will be having nightmares about Barca’s No.10 for years to come.</p>
<p>The Spain full-back has challenged himself against some of the world’s best before, keeping Kaka quiet in Depor’s sensational Champions League comeback against AC Milan last year, but this was another challenge altogether.</p>
<p>Ronaldinho had already got inside the defender’s head once to turn a 1-0 deficit into a 2-1 Barcelona lead, turning stasis into kinesis so abruptly it was barely possible to notice the shift.</p>
<p>And we’d seen another clue in the way he converted the penalty to put Barca 3-1 up, blasting the ball high into Jose Molina’s net with the fury of a man upset that the ball and the responsibility that came with its position on the spot might consider forcing him to break stride.</p>
<p>However, it was a moment after all of this which really let Manuel Pablo know who was in charge.</p>
<p>Ronaldinho rarely needs a second invitation to let loose with disrespect, but when Manuel Pablo went to ground there was never likely to be another outcome.</p>
<p>The full-back’s slide is the act of a man who has had enough. He’s going in for ball or man, and he doesn’t matter which he takes: after the earlier embarrassment, he’s piling in with the force of a truck and letting the laws of physics decide who or what he makes contact with.</p>
<p>If he’s timed it right, ball and man will both come into contact with his boot, and for neither to do so would be a sign of his target reacting quicker than any man realistically could.</p>
<p>What he doesn’t consider, though, is that Ronaldinho’s mind doesn’t believe in such limits.</p>
<p>The simplicity of Ronaldinho’s skill is the worst part for Manuel Pablo. What he imagines as a surefire way to stop his opponent is viewed by the Brazilian as the most minor of inconveniences; to avoid the challenge is akin to stepping out of your way while walking down the street so as to avoid stepping on a dog turd.</p>
<p>The escape itself won’t have bothered him as much as how easy it was to make, and even the attempted recovery from the defender feels accelerated as if Ronaldinho is dragging him along by a string tied to his heels. Immediately, the Depor man has gone from having command of his decisions to not even having any self-control to lose.</p>
<p>The pursuit feels permanent, as if he can only ever be in a state of chasing. The time for approaching any challenge head-on is long gone, so distant it’s hard to even conceive of what it might look like were it to present itself again. Ronaldinho is in charge of the direction of play, and you’re lucky if he’s even generous enough to give you a clear view.</p>

<p>• • • •</p>
<p>When you’ve been to carefully and devastatingly put to the sword, it’s hard to focus on much beyond the immediate embarrassment.</p>
<p>Once the reflex wears off and you’re allowed to give up the chase, attention will naturally turn to making sure you don’t suffer the same fate again. This means time spent attempting to make sense of the original embarrassment, and therein lies the issue: you can prevent others doing the same to you, but whether Ronaldinho repeats the trick is down to the whims of Ronaldinho alone.</p>
<p>If Manuel Pablo wants any consolation, all he can do is remind himself he wasn’t the first to be left scrambling for his lost pride, and he certainly won’t be the last.</p>
