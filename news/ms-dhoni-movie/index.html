<p>Sushant Singh Rajput was widely praised for his performance in MS Dhoni&rsquo;s biopic. | Photo Credit: BCCL</p>
<p>Key Highlights Sushant Singh Rajput portrayed the role of MS Dhoni in his biopic &lsquo;MS Dhoni: The Untold Story&rsquo; At the trailer launch of the movie, Dhoni recalled how Sushant kept asking too many questions to know him better Dhoni had praised Sushant&rsquo;s work as he didn&rsquo;t get much time to spend with him</p>
<p>Given the craze of Bollywood and cricket in India, when the two merge, one can only expect a huge success. The producers have shown a special interest in biopics of cricketers and other sportspersons over the years. Sushant Singh Rajput, the late Bollywood actor, had massive shoes to fill as he was signed to portray the role of Mahendra Singh Dhoni in his biopic ‘MS Dhoni: The Untold Story’.</p>
<p>Given Dhoni’s fan following, Sushant had a huge responsibility on his shoulders. But he did complete justice to the role as he toiled hard for 10 months under the watchful eyes of former Indian wicket-keeper Kiran More – who helped Sushant get a taste of what it would be like to train like Dhoni. While Sushant did not spend much time with Dhoni, he got hold of the Ranchi superstar’s mannerisms by watching his videos.</p>
<p>At the trailer launch of the movie, Dhoni was asked whether there was pressure on him since a movie on him was being released. In his reply, Dhoni said there was more pressure on Sushant and lauded the actor for doing an excellent job despite not getting much time to spend with him.</p>
<p>“It was more difficult for him because he has to convince the public about what he was feeling inside while playing my role. For this, he asked a lot of questions from me like - how did you feel at that time, how do you feel now? I told him – yaar tum sawaal he poochhte rehte ho (you keep asking questions), Dhoni said.</p>
<p>Dhoni also praised Sushant for learning all the cricket shots, especially his trademark ‘helicopter shot’ which he said looked like a replica in the movie.</p>
<p>“In reality, we spent a lot less time together. But the kind of effort he has put in the film because one of the essential parts was cricket. Of course, all of us play cricket but when you have to show it on screen, you have to learn certain things, especially cricket shots. He has hit the helicopter shot in the movie and it’s exactly like a replica. So Sushant has put a lot of effort,” Dhoni added.</p>
<p>At the same event, when asked whether there was pressure to play Dhoni’s character in the film, Sushant said, “In the year 2006-07, after a lot of difficulties, I and my family were able to meet MS Dhoni. I also clicked a photo with him and my family. He is one of the very few persons I have enormous respect for. I look up to him so to get an opportunity to get to know his inside story, up close and personal, gave me a lot of excitement, not pressure. Very honestly, there are films in your career which you do with full honesty and you end up being a good actor but there are very rare films that you do and end up becoming a good human being.”</p>
<p>The cricket, as well as the Bollywood fraternity, was left in a state of shock as Sushant committed suicide at his Mumbai residence on Monday. Just 34, Sushant was one of the most talented actors in the industry with several superhit films to his name.

How Sushant Singh Rajput trained for MS Dhoni - The Untold Story: WATCH</p>
<p>While it is almost impossible to gauge what goes in the mind of the enigma that Dhoni is, Sushant left no stone unturned to do justice to his character.</p>
<p>Whether it was spending nine months with former India wicket-keeper Kiran More to learn the tricks of trade or tirelessly trying Dhoni&rsquo;s trademark helicopter, Sushant gave his all and in the end, his on-screen performance was well accepted by the Indian captain&rsquo;s legion of fans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was very concerned during the making of the movie about whether he would be able to live Dhoni&rsquo;s life on the big screen. He was under a lot of pressure before the movie release (in 2016),&rdquo; Pandey told PTI.</p>
<p>MS Dhoni: The Untold Story actor Sushant Singh Rajput commits suicide in Mumbai; no suicide note found</p>
<p>&ldquo;He used to say it often to me that &lsquo;I hope I am able to deliver, else Mahi&rsquo;s millions of fans will not forgive me ever&rsquo;. But the hard worker that he was, I was sure that he would do a fine job and he did,&rdquo; Pandey, who is yet to come to terms with Sushant&rsquo;s shocking death, said.</p>
<p>Sushant spent months with the cult cricketer to prep for his role and Pandey said the actor&rsquo;s penchant for detail helped him immensely in playing Dhoni in reel life.</p>
<p>Gone too soon my friend, says Kiran More who trained Sushant Singh Rajput for MS Dhoni biopic</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day he was practising the helicopter shot and he suffered a strain. We thought he would take some rest and come back after a while but he said &ldquo;there should not be a delay because of me&rdquo; and was back practising that shot in a week&rsquo;s time,&rdquo; recalled Pandey.</p>
<p>Such was his dedication that by the end of the movie shoot, Sushant became more than a decent cricketer, something Dhoni also acknowledged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He used to ask a lot of questions to Mahi, the little things that make the difference. The fact they both had a Bihar connection also helped them develop a bond,&rdquo; said Pandey.</p>
<p>Pandey would never forget the time when he and Dhoni re-lived their cricketing days through Sushant. Dhoni, who used to play for Air India, stayed in Delhi for a significant period.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always cherish the time when Mahi and I took Sushant to his Air India Colony house in Delhi. He went with us as Mahi recollected his old days and things like where he used to sit and eat, Sushant would do the same to feel the character.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a spot in the house where Mahi used to lie down on the ground and Sushant did that too. He always felt very lucky to be playing Dhoni&rsquo;s character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that he is gone too soon, Pandey said the slight possibility of a sequel to Dhoni&rsquo;s biopic goes out of the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were no plans for a sequel and with him not being us, I don&rsquo;t think it is even a possibility. The news of him passing away is unbelievable. I never expected him to do something like this, he was so full of life. Before the lockdown, we had a gym session together and we were in regular touch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this can happen with anyone and just shows why it is very important to not lose your old self when you reach the top,&rdquo; added Pandey.

Dhoni or Kohli: Who&rsquo;s more hot for b&rsquo;day girl Disha Patani? | Courtesy: dishapatani | virat.kohli | Photo Credit: Instagram</p>
<p>Key Highlights Disha Patani rose to stardom from her movie MS Dhoni: The Untold Story In one of the interviews for the movie, Disha gave Dhoni a Perfect 10 on hotness quotient In the same interview, Disha picked Virat Kohli the Indian cricketer for &lsquo;Perfect Date&rsquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the birthday of Bollywood actress Disha Patani – one of the most followed entertainment celebrities at present – who turns 28 years old on June 13. Over the years, Disha has done many movies which have earned her the stardom she enjoys today, but she truly rose the through ranks after her movie MS Dhoni: The Untold Story came out in 2016 with Sushant Singh Rajput. While the movie is based on the real-life of former India captain MS Dhoni, in one of the interviews, Disha proved how much of a fan she is of the Jharkhand-born wicket-keeper batsman.</p>
<p>In an interview for Bollywood Hangama for the promotion of the movie, Disha rated some of the Indian cricketers on the basis of their &lsquo;Hotness Quotient&rsquo;. The names of Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni, Yuvraj Singh, Rohit Sharma, Ravindra Jadeja opped up, and there was a clear winner for the actress.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how the ratings went:</p>
<p>Virat Kohli: 9</p>
<p>MS Dhoni: 10</p>
<p>Yuvraj Singh: 8</p>
<p>Rohit Sharma: 8</p>
<p>Ravindra Jadeja: 8</p>
<p>In the same interview, when a question over &lsquo;perfect date&rsquo; came up, Disha was quick to pick the current India captain Virat Kohli.</p>
<p>When Jasprit Bumrah bowled over Disha Patani:</p>
<p>Disha is surely a big cricket fan. In another one of her interviews, she picked the &lsquo;biggest match-winner&rsquo; in Indian cricket and in doing so, she went on to snub the superstars Dhoni and Kohli. To the surprise of many, the player that had bowled over the famous actress was India&rsquo;s &lsquo;Yorker King&rsquo; Jasprit Bumrah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had to pick a matchwinning player, it would be Jasprit Bumrah. He is one of the finest players we have. It will be a proud moment for all of us on February 2, while Bumrah takes down the Kiwis,&rdquo; Dish had said in a promotional interview for her movie Malang.</p>
<p>Malang was, in fact, the last movie that Disha featured in. She does have a couple of new projects in the form of Ek Villain 2 and Radhe but the proceedings for those movies have been halted due to the Coronavirus pandemic. In these times of lockdown, Disha has been a regular on social media, sometimes posting her workout videos and sometimes just candid pictures.

<p>Deeply saddened. My heart goes out to Sushants family at this time. Reminiscing and cherishing every moment of our Dhoni shoot. Can’t believe this.. gone too too soon 💔 — Kiara Advani (@advani_kiara) June 14, 2020</p>
<p>Here’s the Instagram post</p>
<p>Kiara made her debut with Fugly in 2014 and has made quite a name for herself. She was recently seen in the web-series ‘Guilty’, which has been streaming on OTT platform Netflix. Kiara’s role in Dhoni’s movie started when the former was working as an intern at a hotel. It was there where Sushant met her for the first time and Kiara asked him for his Identity Card.</p>
<p>From there on, their relationship flourished and eventually they tied the knots in the movie. The movie ends with Dhoni’s six off Nuwan Kulasekara to win India the World Cup after 28 years. As far as the real Dhoni is concerned, he has been happily married for nearly a decade and has a daughter in Ziva, who was born in 2015 before India’s campaign in the World Cup.
