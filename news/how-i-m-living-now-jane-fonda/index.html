With the novel coronavirus keeping the star at home in Los Angeles, Fonda opens up about shifting her Fire Drill Friday activism online, enjoying her alone time and bingeing &lsquo;Curb Your Enthusiasm&rsquo; after a bad experience with &lsquo;Tiger King.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With production grinding to a halt in the face of the novel coronavirus, the entertainment industry has found itself navigating uncharted territory. To offer a better sense for how, The Hollywood Reporter is running a regular series that focuses on how Hollywood&rsquo;s top writers, actors, directors, executives and more are living and working in these challenging times.</p>
<p>Jane Fonda was in production on the last season of Grace &amp; Frankie and at the beginning of her national Fire Drill Fridays tour when coronavirus concerns shut both projects down. Stay-at-home orders have not stopped the star&rsquo;s climate protests, however, as she&rsquo;s moved her Fire Drill Friday rallies online via Zoom and will launch her first youth-centered event this week with support from Norman Lear, Chelsea Handler, Marisa Tomei, Piper Perabo and Amber Valetta. Quarantined at her home in Los Angeles with her assistant and dog, Fonda tells THR of how she&rsquo;s keeping busy with exercise, writing and virtual activism, all while keeping her signature red coat close by.</p>
<p>So, what does your day look like now?</p>
<p>I get up, I live in a small community that has a small gym, and I go to the gym with gloves and a mask and wipes and I work out for an hour. And then I come back and I either participate in Zoom meetings, of which there have been many, or I will write articles for various magazines, write my blog or some social media. And then I either read or I work on Fire Drill Friday stuff.</p>
<p>What’s been the easiest adjustment during this time? And the hardest?</p>
<p>Well, the easiest adjustment is to be quiet and alone — I&rsquo;ll be upstairs, my assistant will be downstairs. I&rsquo;m used to being upstairs on my own because I like that and I do a lot of writing, so that&rsquo;s been very easy. What&rsquo;s hard is not being able to go see my young grandson, Leon, and to not see my friends and to go to the movies.</p>
<p>What’s the best advice you’ve given or received about staying sane right now?</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t gotten any, people are asking me for advice! I kind of roll with things, you know. I&rsquo;ve been doing a lot of filming, videoing and posting requests for support for domestic workers, tip workers, nurses, things like that, and I urge my friends to do the same to support the people who are the most vulnerable right now. We out here in Hollywood, in California, in this business, above-the-line people, are very blessed. Most people aren&rsquo;t like that and so we have to help them and support them and fight for them.</p>
<p>What have you learned about yourself in this period?</p>
<p>That I am resilient, that I have a lot of inner resources, and one of them is that I don&rsquo;t mind being alone. And that I don&rsquo;t get bored — I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever been bored in my life.</p>
<p>The older demographic is known to be most vulnerable to the coronavirus — has that factored into your movements and how you&rsquo;re coping?</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m 82 and a half, I don&rsquo;t want to get the virus, but I&rsquo;m not any more or less careful than the people that I see and my friends that tell me what they&rsquo;re doing. I&rsquo;m disturbed to hear that a young child died recently of it — in other words, nobody is immune.</p>
<p>What are you watching, reading, playing or listening to as a reprieve?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reading a must-read book called Democracy in Chains by Nancy MacLean. It&rsquo;s a very important book. I watch Rachel Maddow and Chris Hayes religiously, that&rsquo;s my news. I read two papers every day, The New York Times and the L.A. Times — in my hand, materially, I need to hold the pages. I do that every morning before I work out. I watch Curb Your Enthusiasm, I watch Better Things, I watch Homeland. I started to watch Tiger King and was disgusted.</p>
<p>What have become your go-to comfort foods during the quarantine?</p>
<p>Tapioca pudding. Didn&rsquo;t expect that, huh?</p>
<p>How would you describe your coronavirus era wardrobe?</p>
<p>Sweatpants, sweatshirts, yoga pants, pullovers. That&rsquo;s kind of it.</p>
<p>In these times, what cause is most important to you?</p>
<p>The climate crisis and what we need to do to prepare for it. Of course, a lot of what we have to do to prepare is what we should have done to prepare for this pandemic. COVID-19 overlaps with what we need to do in the face of the climate crisis — a very strong, robust health care system with equipment and the ability to foresee pandemics when they&rsquo;re coming and have emergency standby shelters and equipment and things like that. [Pandemics] are going to be coming, there&rsquo;s no question of, &ldquo;Are they going to come?&rdquo; There&rsquo;s going to be more as the Arctic ice sheet melts and more and more insects and animals come out from where they usually live because of deforestation and shorter, warmer winters and earlier springs and everything is being disrupted. Vectors, things that carry diseases, are going to be coming into contact with humans much more than before. The SARS, the MERS, Ebola, AIDS and now COVID-19, all of them are related to climate change. So, the hope is that with all these bailouts that are happening, they can do two things at once because we don&rsquo;t have the time to do them separately: deal with the pandemic and deal with the other pandemic, which is the climate crisis.</p>
<p>And what’s atop your to-do list once this is all over?</p>
<p>Keep doing what I&rsquo;m doing, only Fire Drill Fridays will become in-person rather than virtual.</p>
<p>What is the setup of your virtual Fire Drill Fridays going to be? Will they be similar to those in Washington and Los Angeles?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be as close to those as we can do. The first Friday of every month we do a much more produced virtual rally; we&rsquo;re going to have a greenscreen and we&rsquo;re going to have images and we&rsquo;re going to focus on what&rsquo;s been planned for Earth Day on April 22. This is the 50th anniversary, and the young people had been planning to do things for the three or four days all around Earth Day. Of course, everything now has to be rethought, so we&rsquo;re going to be talking with some of the young climate leaders — members of the Sunrise Movement, for example — and others about what they&rsquo;re planning, what they&rsquo;re asking people to do to support them. They&rsquo;re calling on [California] Gov. [Gavin] Newsom to combat the climate crisis and protect public health with the same level of urgency that he&rsquo;s combating the COVID crisis; he&rsquo;s providing real leadership up against the coronavirus and many lives are going to be saved because of his leadership. Now, we want him to also be a climate leader and save millions more lives here in California and around the world by stopping any new fossil fuel expansion and starting a phase-out, a gradual phase-out.</p>
<p>Without being able to protest and rally, what&rsquo;s the best way for people to have their voices heard right now?</p>
<p>Calling our elected officials, and they don&rsquo;t necessarily have to be the people who represent us. But calling senators and members of the House of Representatives, demanding that the next go-around, the next bailout — there&rsquo;s going to be a fourth bailout — doesn&rsquo;t ignore the climate crisis and does better for workers, including nurses and doctors and equipment. That&rsquo;s one thing that we talked about last Friday and that we&rsquo;ll talk about again in the Fridays to come. Calling and emailing, but calling especially, elected officials is really important. Let them know what&rsquo;s on your mind and that you&rsquo;re going to work against them if they don&rsquo;t demand what you&rsquo;re doing. People can go on the Fire Drill Friday website and you&rsquo;ll see things that you can do.</p>
<p>Have to ask — are you still wearing your signature red coat, even though you&rsquo;re at home?</p>
<p>Yes I am.

<h3 id="jane-fonda-will-not-stop-rallying-for-the-planet">Jane Fonda Will Not Stop Rallying For the Planet</h3>
<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/elm040120fobcover0004a-1584567491.jpg?crop=1xw:0.399788285109386xh;center,top&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">

<p>Last Labor Day weekend, Jane Fonda was sitting around in Big Sur with pals Rosanna Arquette and Catherine Keener feeling “very depressed that I wasn’t doing enough about the climate crisis.” She’d already stopped using single-use plastics, started driving an electric car, and cut back on meat, but she still yearned to make a bigger impact.</p>
<p>“When you’re famous, you have this incredible potential platform, but how do you use it?” Fonda says. And then she realized, “I have to put myself on the line.” So she called up Annie Leonard, the executive director of Greenpeace USA, and told her she was going to camp out in front of the White House. “She said, ‘Well, that’s great that you’re willing to do that, but it’s illegal,’ ” says Fonda, laughing over a hummus platter one February weekend afternoon at The Wing in Los Angeles, where she’s filming the seventh and final season of Netflix’s Grace and Frankie. Fonda was undeterred, but “didn’t want to be some aging movie star moving to DC” and butting in on existing activists, so she reached out to environmental organizations and students who, inspired by Greta Thunberg, had been protesting on Fridays, wondering where the adults were. Someone told her to “see if the students will welcome you, and if they do, go every Friday,” Fonda says. “So right away, I went to DC.”</p>
<p>She was greeted with open arms, and for 14 weeks beginning in October, Fonda and a diverse coalition of groups staged weekly protests in front of the Capitol to pressure leaders to address climate change. She dubbed her movement “Fire Drill Fridays,” and soon Fonda and a host of famous friends, including co-star Lily Tomlin and Ted Danson, were arrested and herded into police vans, wrists ziptied.</p>

<p>Long ago, Fonda made an important calculation about her celebrity: People were going to watch her, and she could use their attention to promote her agenda. For decades, she’s spoken out against the status quo and made headlines for agitating against authority, be it opposition to the Vietnam War or social inequality. Her mug shot from a Cleveland jail in 1970, fist raised and hair shagged, became an iconic symbol of people power and feminism.</p>

<p>Even the Jane Fonda workout—her quintessential-1980s exercise videos that became a global aerobics phenomenon—was created to raise funds for an organization she helped start with her then-husband, political activist Tom Hayden, to end corporate control of the economy. Inspired by Lyndon LaRouche, an infamous fascist hatemonger who used his computer business profits to pay for antigay protests, Fonda tried to think of what business she could start to fund the causes she cared about. She thought about starting a restaurant, but after someone advised her not to go into an industry she didn’t understand, she thought, “There’s only one thing I understand, and that is working out.” With her bouncy ringlets and tiny leotard-clad figure, Fonda showed people how to target their inner-thigh muscles—while raising $17 million to fight poverty, racial injustice, and corporate malfeasance.</p>
<p>Despite her long history of fighting for change, Fonda says it is only now as an octogenarian that she senses her strength as an activist. She’s been frank—in her memoir My Life So Far and in a 2018 HBO documentary, Jane Fonda in Five Acts—that it’s taken her a long time to feel she’s fully present and living her life for herself. Married to three different powerful men over the decades—French director Roger Vadim, who directed her in the 1960s sci-spoof Barbarella; Hayden; and media mogul Ted Turner—Fonda says she often felt unsure of herself and preferred to follow others. “I always felt like the student,” she says. “This is the first time that I am the leader.”</p>
<p>After her fourth arrest this fall, the endlessly glamorous actress had to spend the night in jail. While Fonda is matter-of-fact in saying she’s far more fortunate than most—“I’m white and I’m famous and I think orders came down from the attorney general to handle me with kid gloves”—it isn’t easy spending the night in jail when you’re in your eighties. She used her red coat to soften the metal of her bunk and managed to sleep through the sounds of fellow inmates sobbing, screaming, and rattling the bars of their cells. “It’s very hard in life to find a way to align your body with your deepest values, and that’s what civil disobedience can do,” says Fonda, building to a rapturous crescendo when she describes the way her renewed purpose makes her feel. “Even though you’re being handcuffed and put in a situation where you have absolutely no control, it’s like stepping in to yourself. I have chosen to put myself in this position where I lose all power because of something I believe in. And it’s incredible.”</p>
<p>Her resolve is greater than ever. She expanded Fire Drill Fridays, first to the West Coast, with a protest held in front of L.A.&lsquo;s City Hall in February, and now, to the entire nation—virtually. In March, during the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, Fonda announced that she would be moving Fire Drill Fridays online starting April 3. (Text Jane to 877877 for more info.)</p>
<p>Prior to the national mandate for social distancing and isolation, Fonda had planned to take a two-year hiatus from acting to tour the country and get out the climate vote. She says she’s a good messenger because, well, she’s old. “I’m 82, which is very useful because people say, ‘Well, gosh, if she can do it, I can do it, too.’&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="breast-cancer-survivor-jane-fonda-82-embodies-resilience-and-strength-as-elle-magazines-april-cover-model">Breast Cancer Survivor Jane Fonda, 82, Embodies Resilience And Strength As Elle Magazine’s April Cover Model</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets.survivornet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/02101200/Screen-Shot-2020-04-02-at-10.10.34-AM-1200x630.png" alt="img">
Jane Fonda is 82-years-old and on the cover of Elle. She is a breast cancer survivor and a thriver. Whatever you think about Fonda, it’s a remarkable reminder about resilience.</p>
<p>Fonda announced to fans that she is the face of Elle’s Earth Day issue, which focuses on women fighting for climate justice. Dressed in a black and grey power suit, Fonda is channeling the strength and power of both a cancer survivor and environmental rights activist.</p>
<p>The actress revealed in 2010 that she experienced a breast cancer scare after doctors discovered a small, non-invasive tumor. Fonda underwent a procedure at the time, and her representative declared her “cancer-free.” In 2016, Fonda had a mastectomy before the Golden Globe Awards.</p>
<p>Related: When Should You Consider a Mastectomy?</p>
<p>Fonda’s cancer battle didn’t stop there. In 2018, while speaking to The Today Show, Fonda addressed bandages on her face by explaining she had a cancer taken away from her lip.</p>
<p>“Well, the world is falling apart, what’s a lip?” Fonda asked. “Yeah, they did (biopsy it.) I’m going to be fine, thanks.”</p>
<p>Breast Cancer And Considering A Mastectomy</p>
<p>Fonda isn’t the only celebrity to go through a mastectomy, other familiar faces like Elle’s Editor-In-Chief Nina Garcia, Angelina Jolie, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and others have all opened up about their experiences with the procedure.</p>
<p>A mastectomy is a procedure which removes either one or both breasts. It’s usually done to treat breast cancer, but other women have the surgery to prevent a breast cancer diagnosis if there’s history of the disease in their family. However when considering a mastectomy, there are a few factors to weigh in the decision.</p>

<p>“Depending on the size and other features, such as family history, a patient may opt for more aggressive surgery,” Dr. Elizabeth Comen, a medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, tells SurvivorNet.</p>
<p>In addition to risk factors, there are a few surgery options patients should keep in mind while approaching physicians for breast cancer treatment.</p>
<p>Dr. Ann Partridge explains when women should consider a mastectomy during breast cancer treatment</p>
<p>“When I talk to a woman who comes to me and she has breast cancer, I evaluate what the standard options for treatment for her are, which typically include cutting out the cancer — which is either a lumpectomy if you can get it all with just a little scooping around of the area that’s abnormal or a mastectomy for some women meaning taking the full breast because sometimes these lesions can be very extensive in the breast,” Dr. Ann Patridge, a medical oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, explains to SurvivorNet.</p>
