Residents in Mornington, Victoria, mark Anzac Day 2020 with a special driveway ceremony</p>
<p>Posted</p>
<p>Karon Baker broke down in tears when her local Anzac Day dawn service was cancelled this year. By 6:30am this morning, she couldn&rsquo;t wipe a proud smile off her face.</p>
<p>Clutching flags and candles, Ms Baker and about 25 neighbours proudly stood in their driveways for their own dawn service in Mornington, south of Melbourne,</p>
<p>As Prime Minister Scott Morrison delivered his address at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, Ms Baker&rsquo;s son and bagpiper Angus summoned the residents of Tira Court out of their homes with a stirring rendition of Amazing Grace.</p>
<p>A home sound system was brought onto the street, allowing socially distancing residents to listen to the national service together on the radio.</p>
<p>A small cross with the words &ldquo;Lest we Forget&rdquo; was placed next to a corkboard where residents could pin pictures of friends and loved ones who had served.</p>
<p>Ms Baker said she didn&rsquo;t believe in God, but to her, Anzac Day felt like the closest thing to a religious experience.</p>
<p>One of her sons is serving in the army, while another retired injured. Her father served in the British Armed Forces, and both her grandparents were also veterans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless you&rsquo;re an army mum, you won&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they take their oath, you&rsquo;re taking that oath with them. When they put on that uniform you&rsquo;re doing it too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You live and breathe the army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A court unites people&rsquo;</p>
<p>A few doors up from Ms Baker&rsquo;s house, Kylie Donnelly placed photos of her grandfathers, who both served in New Guinea, alongside a chalk-drawn poppy on her driveway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just very proud of them, that they represented our country,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Both women say there is something special about the tight-knit community in their court — a place where many of the residents have lived next to each other for two decades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We always wave as we pass, we&rsquo;ve watched each other&rsquo;s kids grow up and celebrated their achievements,&rdquo; Ms Baker said.</p>
<p>Adds Ms Donnelly: &ldquo;A court unites people, especially if there&rsquo;s people and dogs&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Despite its success, it is likely Tira Court won&rsquo;t be the venue of another Anzac Day service.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s likely to be one of the most memorable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When everyone in the street came out, it warmed my heart,&rdquo; Ms Baker said.</p>
<p>Next year, many hope to return to their normal local venue in Mornington, Memorial Park, or travel to the Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne.</p>

<h3 id="politicians-take-note-this-anzac-day-coronavirus-is-a-pandemic-it-is-not-a-war--paul-daley">Politicians, take note this Anzac Day: coronavirus is a pandemic. It is not a war | Paul Daley</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24f4d6d24fc8bb5a2b4165d736d43a123714a62b/0_173_5191_3115/master/5191.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=dd63070d59de69881a75e1aaf82a9739" alt="img">
Our politicians have been insisting this Anzac Day will be “unlike any other”.</p>
<p>Yes, isolation will prevent most from attending traditional services. Commemoration, as with so much else today, will be largely virtual – a matter of mind over place, imagination over reality.</p>
<p>But in essence there’ll be little difference today about the way Australia does Anzac, with its long reliance on the dominance of belief over history in national creation mythology.</p>
<p>For weeks we’ve been told Australia is at war with Covid-19 – we even had “our Dunkirk moment” one federal minister said, unable to emphasise the gravity of spending $130bn on wage subsidies without a nod to (British) military/civilian historical enterprise.</p>
<p>How Spanish flu nearly ripped apart Australia&rsquo;s fledgling federation | Paul Daley Read more</p>
<p>So, hold your breath for a barrage of speeches where politicians conflate the Australian experience of endurance (though not the ultimate failure) at Gallipoli with the mitigation of the biggest public health and economic threat the world has seen since the Spanish flu pandemic a century ago.</p>
<p>The prime minister foreshadowed it: “This year &hellip; we will still remember the sacrifice of those who gave so much for us at Gallipoli and on many fronts, as we ourselves give what we can to protect Australian lives while we face this terrible virus.”</p>
<p>This is a public health and economic cataclysm. It is not a war.</p>
<p>Those at the vanguard of resisting the coronavirus are not Anzacs. They are nurses, doctors, police, ambos, orderlies, cleaners, delivery drivers, supermarket workers and public servants. Today, as they did 100 years ago when the world was in the grip of the Spanish flu (killing 50 million globally including some 13,000 Australians), they work for the national interest, many putting their lives at risk.</p>
<p>How will we remember them? Hopefully with more respect and dignity than Australia did under Billy Hughes, hell-bent on forging a white Australian story of national genesis out of the ashes of the first world war despite having so much other continental history, Indigenous and other, to drawn on.</p>
<p>Where are the memorials to the dead of the last big pandemic, to those who saved so many and died in the process?</p>
<p>The Australian landscape is dotted with monuments to Anzac’s 62,000 dead. “Sacred places,” historian Ken Inglis called them.</p>
<p>But where are the memorials to the dead of the last big pandemic, to those who saved so many and died in the process?</p>
<p>Eclipsed by proximity of the pandemic to the end of the first world war and by the nationalist fervour to narrate a foundation myth from blood “sacrifice” (Hughes had urged men to “fight for White Australia”) the pandemic’s dead were neither commemorated nor memorialised.</p>
<p>Battlefield death, for all its inflated, airbrushed “glory”, and its undeniable waste, found a rarefied embrace in national narrative where pandemic stoicism, bravery and death were relegated as prosaic and unworthy of commemoration.</p>
<p>Mary Sheehan, nurse and historian of Spanish flu, says, “I’ve also thought that other factors besides the war were worth considering to explain the collective memory loss [about Spanish flu]. One is the insidious, invisible nature of the disease, in comparison to other natural disasters like floods and bushfires; the pandemic was not a sudden dramatic event like these disasters, no traditional heroes emerged, and it did not leave a visible legacy of destruction – except, of course death, and rises in the number of single parents and orphans.</p>
<p>As the Royal Australian Historical Society notes of the Spanish flu pandemic, “After the emergency was declared over in September 1919, individuals, families and communities recovered and focused on building a post-war world. Unlike the numerous [Australian] memorials to the Anzacs who served and died over 1914–18, however, there are relatively few monuments to the victims and volunteers of 1919.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, historian Peter Hobbins writes, “Compared with the Anzac memorials that peppered our towns and suburbs in the decades after the Great War, few monuments mark the impact of pneumonic influenza &hellip; Nevertheless, its stories of suffering and sacrifice have been perpetuated in other ways, especially within family and community memories. A century later, these stories deserve to be researched and commemorated.”</p>
<p>There are fewer than a dozen public Australian monuments to the dead of that pandemic. It is overshadowed in historiography by obsession with Anzac.</p>
<p>Patrick Hodgson, whose doctoral thesis considers the pandemic’s impact in Queensland, also contemplates a national “forgetting” of the Spanish flu.</p>
<p>“Despite the Australian authorities’ penchant for military sacrifice as the defining symbol of nationhood, public memorialisation of civilians – even those who sacrificed their lives in helping others during the pandemic – has long been regarded as lacking sufficient worthiness”, he writes.</p>
<p>“At a time when the devastation of World War One was being rewritten into a myth of glorious sacrifice on which a nation could at last stand proud, Australia’s 13,000 to perhaps 20,000 influenza deaths and the many more who were incapacitated by the 1918-1920 pandemic, or who heard their state’s call to a mission of mercy, have left virtually no mark on the Australian landscape or in public memory.”</p>
<p>In Queensland there is, Hodgson points out, only one recorded memorial to a flu victim. The monument at Tambo is dedicated to Reginald Barry “who worked unceasingly to save those people in Tambo stricken with pneumonic influenza and by the end of the epidemic contracted the disease himself and died”.</p>
<p>Some 3,000 civilian nurses volunteered during the first world war at field and base hospitals in Australia and elsewhere. About 2,500 were in the Australian Army Nursing Service and about 154 were mentioned in official despatches, seven were awarded the Military Medal for gallantry and 25 died, all from illness.</p>
<p>Australia’s leaders, its media and some historians persist in talking up the big Anzac game | Paul Daley Read more</p>
<p>Hodgson recounts the experience of nurse Rosa O’Kane of Charters Towers. She died of influenza in 1919 and “was eulogised for her ‘heroic bravery in the time of danger’ &hellip; [and] considered to be on ‘active service’ whilst tending to the influenza ravaged soldiers at the Woodman Point Quarantine Station in Western Australia when she succumbed to the disease. The eulogising of O’Kane was not so much for her self-sacrifice during a civil emergency but for her fighting, in a gender-appropriate way, for King and Country. Considered a war death, she was buried with full military honours and her story quietly written into the Anzac mythology.”</p>
<p>O’Kane’s story reminds us of the discretionary power of Anzac mythology to cherry-pick from history and human experience, and of the enormous public resources that support it. (On that score, and in this time of such national austerity, never has there been a more apt moment to abandon the federal government’s absurd decision to spend another $500m on an unnecessary expansion of the Australian War Memorial).</p>
<p>By all means we should remember the dead of Anzac. But the commemorations shouldn’t overshadow the contributions of more worthy contributors or be conflated with the experience of those who are today stoically, without grandiosity, helping to stave off a civil health and economic emergency.</p>
<p>This is not wartime.</p>

news, national, The Land, Dorrigo, Anzac Day, Vivian Hoskins</p>
<p>In Dorrigo some people said it was the most personal and moving Anzac commemoration since the years of the Vietnam War. Perhaps it was self isolation and distancing from others; an absence of crowds, noise, parades and speeches. People had time to think, to remember, to be alone and all of this before the light came. At the NSW northern tablelands&rsquo; town&rsquo;s monument, veterans and families of veterans stood well apart for The Ode, Last Post, Reveille and The Silence. Private layings of wreaths, flowers and rosemary followed and the remembrance ended with the piping of The Lament. But, it was away from this formal ceremony, in the streets and lanes of the town and on country roads that a far different and deeply moving keeping of Anzac Day was privately observed Under heavy trees, in front of a lattice gate, an elegant pyramid of glass, dimly lit; perhaps a treasured remnant from days of conservatories or black-tie parties. And further along, battered, rusted and with a permanent lean to the left, a Tilley lantern, smelling of kerosene, in need of a wick trim but its link with war-time not lost on those who had been there. In a well-lighted street two tiny handmade lanterns burned near a banner of the Australian flag: Lest We Forget and an image of three diggers wearing slouch hats. We wtinessed at the edge of the main road, near a caravan park, a young couple, perhaps travellers, with a white-haired, excited daughter, all three animated and waiting for the sun to come over Dome Mountain. In front of them was a gaggle of slim, white dinner candles from goodness knows where, at odd angles but no less authentic than the Eternal Flame. On a country road, surrounded by trees and at the road gate a farmer, beside his half-lit ute, standing &ldquo;at ease&rdquo;, (a faint suggestion of military training years before), alone and hardly noticeable in the dim light; a reminder of generations of young men and women from farms and country towns who went off to war. And to one side, homemade but important to him, a cluster of Flanders poppies. Further along a group of neighbours stood at the roadside, well-organised with recorded music, flags and all the trappings of Anzac, carved poppies on white pegs, each bearing the name of a loved one from some distant conflict and one woman neatly clad in dressing gown and winter pyjamas. Elsewhere in driveways, lanes, front gates, gardens and at cattle grids flames burned in memory and recognition; some ornate and carefully made, others simple, humble, and a few just tea candles on bare earth. Some had an honour guard of relatives, comrades in arms or children; some burned alone. None was greater or lesser than the other. In the spirit of the day all were equal&hellip;and deep. And, amid all of this, and half a lifetime from the parades and milling crowds, the noise of bands and old men with medals and wheelchairs a certainty emerged: &lsquo;They&rsquo; would never be forgotten. Amen.</p>
