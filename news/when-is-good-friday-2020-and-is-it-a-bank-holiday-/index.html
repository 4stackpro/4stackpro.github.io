EASTER is a Christian celebration centring around Jesus&rsquo; death on Good Friday and resurrection on Easter Sunday.</p>
<p>It is also a time when friends and families gather to celebrate the holidays, but with the Government&rsquo;s directive to lock down the country following the outbreak of coronavirus, many are wondering whether Good Friday will still be a bank holiday.</p>

<p>When is Good Friday?</p>
<p>The date for Good Friday changes every year as Easter is always determined by the Moon.</p>
<p>In 2020, Good Friday falls on April 10.</p>
<p>Easter falls on the first Sunday following the Paschal Full Moon - the first Full Moon after the spring equinox.</p>
<p>In 2020 the spring equinox fell on March 20, with the first Full Moon after this date on April 8.</p>
<p>So then Easter Sunday is calculated as April 12, meaning Good Friday lands on April 10.</p>

<p>Is Good Friday a bank holiday?</p>
<p>Good Friday before 1871 was always celebrated as a common holiday.</p>
<p>Since 1871, it was declared an official bank holiday.</p>
<p>This year, Good Friday falls on April 10 - the first day of a long bank holiday weekend.</p>
<p>And Brits should still be enjoying days off work - but keeping to the Government&rsquo;s guidelines.</p>
<p>Good Friday is followed by Easter Sunday on April 12, and Easter Monday on April 13, which is also a bank holiday in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but not in Scotland - making it a long weekend for many.</p>
<p>Despite the coronavirus pandemic resulting in a lockdown in the UK, the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) responsible for the Government&rsquo;s policy for holidays has said Brits should observe the Good Friday bank holiday as usual.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for BEIS said rules surrounding bank holidays should apply as usual.</p>
<p>If workers who might not usually work on bank holidays are asked to do so, employers must make sure the workers are still entitled to their statutory holiday due them for the year.</p>

<p>What is Good Friday?</p>
<p>Good Friday is a Christian holiday which marks the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>According to Christianity, it is when Jesus died to resurrect three days later, which is celebrated on Easter Sunday.</p>
<p>Christians believe Christ came to earth in order to sacrifice himself so sinners would be redeemed.</p>
<p>Several Christian denominations including Roman Catholic, Anglican, Methodist and Orthodox mark the day with church services which are sometimes solemn, as they reflect on the suffering Christ went through in order to save mankind, according to the Bible.</p>
<p>This year, as a result of the Government&rsquo;s directive of a lockdown and for Brits to practice social distancing due to the spread of coronavirus, churches will remain shut for the Easter celebrations.</p>
<p>Many churches across the UK are holding online services using Zoom, Facebook and other media channels.

<p>Easter Monday comes after a weekend of Christian celebrations remembering the death of Jesus on the cross on Good Friday and his return to life on Easter Sunday.</p>
<p>According to Christianity, Jesus was crucified on Good Friday, sacrificing himself to save mankind from sin.</p>
<p>After his resurrection, it is believed that Jesus remained on earth for 40 days after his resurrection, appearing to several people encouraging them to spread the Gospel to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>According to newvision.co.org Easter Monday is the beginning of the Easter Octave for Roman Catholics.</p>
<p>On this day it’s common to douse people in water, representing the new life of baptism, and play games with Easter eggs.</p>
<p>But it’s a popular break for a lot of people as it gives families the chance to jet off for a long weekend – but that won’t be happening in 2020.

<h3 id="easter-2020-your-state-by-state-guide-to-retail-trading-rules">Easter 2020: Your state-by-state guide to retail trading rules</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.smartcompany.com.au/content/uploads/2020/04/woman-fixing-clothes-on-the-rack-3965548.jpg" alt="img">
The annual Easter holiday period is right around the corner (at the end of this week, in fact), but with many Australian businesses already closed due to coronavirus restrictions, there’s understandably a different mood in the air.</p>
<p>Cafes and restaurants across the country have switched to takeaway and delivery options only, while a growing number of retailers are temporarily closing their doors to keep staff and customers safe.</p>
<p>Despite the restrictions, it’s still important for business owners to be aware of the public holiday trading rules and regulations at this time of the year, and the penalty rates that apply if your business is still open.</p>
<p>Easter trading hours 2020</p>
<p>Retail trading hours for the Easter period vary by state, however, most of the states do have exemptions for small businesses, which means they can continue to trade over the extended break (as long as the coronavirus restrictions also allow it).</p>
<p>Here are the upcoming public holidays business owners should be aware of:</p>
<p>Good Friday, April 10;</p>
<p>Easter Saturday, April 11;</p>
<p>Easter Sunday, April 12; and</p>
<p>Easter Monday, April 13.</p>
<p>Victoria</p>
<p>In Victoria, Good Friday is a restricted trading day, which means only exempt businesses business can open.</p>
<p>Exempt shops are those with 20 or fewer staff members employed in their shop, or 100 or fewer people employed across the entire business. There are certain types of businesses that are also exempt, and can therefore trade, including chemists, petrol shops, restaurants, cafes, takeaway outlets, service providers and hire outlets.</p>
<p>Victoria also observes public holidays on Easter Saturday, Easter Sunday and Easter Monday, however, there are only trading restrictions in place for Good Friday.</p>
<p>New South Wales</p>
<p>New South Wales follows similar trading guidelines to Victoria, with the four Easter days treated as public holidays.</p>
<p>Trading restrictions are in place on Good Friday and Easter Sunday, which means non-exempt businesses cannot open.</p>
<p>Under usual circumstances, supermarkets in NSW would need to adhere to restricted trading on Good Friday, however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government is allowing supermarkets to operate all day, provided their staff have freely elected to work that day.</p>
<p>Queensland</p>
<p>Queensland has a complicated set of trading hour laws that mean retailers in one part of the state must observe different rules to others.</p>
<p>Independent retail shops that aren’t food and grocery retailers must close on Good Friday, with the state government advising that owners and operates of businesses that predominantly sell food or groceries are allowed to open their businesses from 7am on permitted trading days this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>For an overview of the various trading hour restrictions across the state for non-exempt shops, click here.</p>
<p>South Australia</p>
<p>Like Queensland, South Australia has a set of complex retail trading rules that determine which businesses can trade and when.</p>
<p>The rules are based on locations, the size of shops and the retail category, and there is a lengthy list of exempt retailers.</p>
<p>However, the SA government has made a number of changes to the trading rules this year, in response to COVID-19, and these new guidelines are summarised here.</p>
<p>Western Australia</p>
<p>In Western Australia, small retail shops are exempt from most retail trading restrictions over Easter, and a small retail shop is defined as being “owned by up to six people who operate no more than four retail shops, in which up to 25 people work at any one time”.</p>
<p>Specialty retail shops are also exempt from most trading restrictions, including pharmacies, newsagents, and hardware, boating and craft shops.</p>
<p>Non-exempt retailers must close on Good Friday, but the trading restrictions don’t cover restaurants, cafes, takeaway food shops and short-term markets.</p>
<p>Tasmania</p>
<p>Small retailers are able to trade without restrictions in Tasmania over Easter.</p>
<p>Good Friday and Easter Monday are observed as public holidays, as well as the Tuesday after Easter Monday, which this year falls on April 14. However, Easter Saturday and Easter Sunday are not considered public holidays.</p>
<p>Australian Capital Territory</p>
<p>The Australian Capital Territory observes the four days between Good Friday and Easter Monday as public holidays. There are currently no trading restrictions in place for the Easter period.</p>
<p>Northern Territory</p>
<p>The Northern Territory observes Good Friday, Easter Saturday and Easter Monday as public holidays, however, Easter Sunday is not considered a public holiday.</p>
<p>There are currently no trading restrictions in place across the Easter period.</p>
<p>Penalty rates</p>
<p>For retailers that do trade over the Easter public holidays, it is important to remember penalty rates do apply.</p>
