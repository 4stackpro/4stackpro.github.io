Local streets will be quiet, as tin rattlers for the Good Friday Appeal have been told to stay home.</p>
<p>It will be the first Easter in decades that Shepparton&rsquo;s CFA members have not spent their long weekend trawling the streets collecting funds for the Royal Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</p>
<p>Due to COVID-19 the appeal has been limited to an online fundraiser and virtual tins have been set up so people can donate to the cause via their local community group.</p>
<p>Shepparton CFA Good Friday Appeal manager Anthony Deith said the team had set up a virtual tin.</p>
<p>“There&rsquo;s no door-knocking or rattling at the intersections like we normally do but that doesn&rsquo;t mean people can&rsquo;t donate,” Mr Deith said.</p>
<p>“We have set up a virtual donation tin on the Good Friday Appeal website, which will add to the Shepparton town tally,” he said.</p>
<p>Last year the local brigade raised more than $30 000 for sick children.</p>
<p>Mr Deith said it would be amazing if under the circumstances they could beat that total.</p>
<p>“It&rsquo;s quite personal, for a number of us at the brigade have had kids who had to go to the children&rsquo;s hospital,” he said.</p>
<p>“It&rsquo;s a really worthwhile cause.</p>
<p>“It will be a lot harder to raise funds this year, not being out and about, but we are really urging locals to spare whatever they can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Donating online is nearly as simple as dropping money in a tin — it can be completed in minutes and only takes a few quick clicks.</p>
<p>To donate to children in need head to the Shepparton CFA Facebook page or find the CFA&rsquo;s virtual tin online at <a href="http://www.goodfridayappeal.com.au">www.goodfridayappeal.com.au</a>

<p><img src="https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-969157/30c9f1a69abf368b91b0b3a72fd69a745a20a6f4-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1024" alt="img">
The annual Good Friday Appeal for the Royal Children&rsquo;s Hospital has raised $18.2 million after the Victorian government threw it a lifeline.</p>
<p>Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews announced on Friday his government would make up the shortfall between what was raised this year and last year&rsquo;s total, which was $18 million.</p>
<p>The final total raised was $18.2 million, organisers said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The total is something all Victorians should be proud of, especially under such trying circumstances,&rdquo; Good Friday Appeal executive director Anne Randall said in the statement late on Friday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is incredible to see the community continuing to rally together - virtually - and raise funds for children in need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The appeal relied this year on a &ldquo;virtual tin shake&rdquo; in place of volunteers in public collecting in-person donations.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday evening Mr Andrews said the state could not watch the appeal fall short this year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Good Friday Appeal supports the neediest kids - kids that are sick - and their families, every year, and we can&rsquo;t leave the kids short this year,&rdquo; he told Channel 7.</p>
<p>At 8pm on Friday the donation tally was at nearly $7.2 million.</p>
<p>Donations help the hospital care for children like Quinnie Westwood, the face of this year&rsquo;s campaign.</p>
<p>Quinnie was born unable to breathe and had kidney failure, before undergoing surgery at age two to get her grandfather&rsquo;s kidney.</p>
<p>The youngster is now six years old and despite the challenges faced since birth, including having to take anti-rejection medication, she makes her parents proud of how far she has come.</p>
<p>As well as patient care, donations go towards equipment, technology, research and training.</p>
<p>This year marks the 150th year for the Royal Children&rsquo;s Hospital.

As the Good Friday Appeal wraps up for 2020, Victorians have revealed their generosity by digging deep in the name of our kids.</p>
<p>Good Friday Appeal director Anne Randall, said it was “heartening” to see the generosity of so many Victorians.</p>
<p>“I am stunned at the generosity of the community,” she said.</p>
<p>“With everything that is happening in the world at the moment, one thing won’t change and that is the commitment we all have to kids’ health.”</p>
<p>WOW Victoria - a record $18.2m was raised for this year&rsquo;s Appeal through community donations and an unprecedented top up by @DanielAndrewsMP and the Victorian Government.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a tough year and you still came through for the kids!</p>

<p>Virtual tins shook and ­tallies ticked over online on Friday as the appeal went digital due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>At 9.30pm, $9,640,437 had been given by Victorians.</p>
<p>And in an unprecedented last-minute gesture, Premier Daniel Andrews pledged to top up the fund for the Royal Children’s Hospital to a record $18.2 million — up from $18.145 million last year.</p>

<p>He made the shock announcement on Friday night, stating the state government could not “leave the kids short”.</p>
<p>“On behalf of the government, I can commit that we will fill the gap on whatever was raised last year — just over $18 million — and whatever is raised this year,” he said.</p>
<p>“We can’t have the kids go without the things that they need. The Good Friday Appeal is very special to us and it’s ­important we take this step.”</p>
<p>The government’s generous donation stunned organisers.</p>
<p>Good Friday Appeal chairman Penny Fowler — also chairman of the Herald and Weekly Times, publisher of the Herald Sun — thanked the Premier for the huge gesture.</p>

<p>“This is incredible news,­ ­another record for the Good Friday Appeal,” she said.</p>
<p>“Thank you so much to the Premier and his government. This year has been tough for everyone … we have been so grateful for the community’s ongoing willingness to support the Appeal. Thank you for helping our children.”</p>
<p>Significant donations were also handed over by the RCH Auxiliaries, raising $1.5 million; Woolies chipping in $790,340; the Elisabeth Murdoch College donating $96,385.93; and the CFA contributing more than $156,000.</p>
<p>media_camera Hasti Momeni says a big thank you to all who donated. Picture: Alex Coppel</p>
<p>The 15th Herald Sun/Transurban Run for the Kids was cancelled but supporters of the event, including major sponsor Transurban, still raised a staggering $670,000. Many who had registered opted to donate their entry fee.</p>
<p>Hasti Momeni, 12, is one of the many children the Appeal will benefit this year.</p>
<p>The year 7 student from Pascoe Vale was born with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, and has been in and out of the RCH since she was a month old. Her mum, Masoumeh Khadamati, said: “I always say, if we weren’t here we wouldn’t get this sort of medical treatment. They’re amazing.”</p>
<p>The face of this year’s campaign, Quinnie Westwood, 6, and long-time patient Libby Kurc, 16, are just two of many grateful for the work of the RCH and the Appeal years on.</p>
<p>Libby, born with Pierre Robin Syndrome, has been wheeled into surgery at the RCH 36 times.</p>
<p>“The hospital saved her life. From the moment they took her from my arms they cared for her and they made her who she is,” mum Ruth Kurc said.</p>
<p>Outgoing director of the Appeal, Anne Randall, said the tally was something “all Victorians should be proud of”.</p>
<p>This year’s funds raised will go towards patient and family-centred care, new equipment, research and training.</p>
<p>VICTORIANS KEEP GIVING</p>
<p>This year’s Good Friday Appeal has already seen Victorians dig deep, even against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Donations are continuing to stream in for the biggest fundraiser of the year for the Royal Children’s Hospital.</p>
<p>At 3pm the Good Friday Appeal had raised a total of $6,402,106 — which will help kids just like Marcus Sian.</p>
<p>The youngster is in awe of his new-found abilities.</p>
<p>As the Good Friday Appeal - Special Edition starts on Channel 7 and 7plus, the 7pm tally is $6,402,106.</p>

<p>Marcus contracted a rare disease known as transverse myelitis when he was eight months old, which left him with paralysis in parts of his body.</p>
<p>“By the time we got to the Royal Children’s Hospital he was paralysed from the neck down and was virtually a ragdoll,” Mum Jessica Sian says.</p>
<p>“It was the most terrifying time.”</p>
<p>But thanks to an innovative team of surgeons at the RCH, Marcus can now walk, run and play on his own.</p>
<p>media_camera Six-year-old Marcus Sian has Transverse Myelitis. Picture: Alex Coppel</p>
<p>“He’s turned into a very, very different child,” Ms Sian says.</p>
<p>“He’s walking literally everywhere on his own, everywhere. He can run, he can ride his bicycle, he’s learning to play tennis at school.</p>
<p>“This time last year he wasn’t able to stand steady on his own. We wouldn’t have dreamt of him being able to ride a bike or play tennis.</p>
<p>“We wouldn’t have come this far without that surgery and everything else the hospital has done.”</p>
<p>The Good Friday Appeal, which supports the RCH, ensures children like Marcus continue to receive the care they need.</p>
<p>Director of the Appeal, Anne Randall, said the support of the community in uncertain times was heartwarming.</p>
<p>“We understand that everyone is living through challenging and uncertain times. To receive these messages of support and inquiries from people on how they can donate this year, makes us extremely grateful and we say a heartfelt thank you to all Victorians.”</p>
<p>Another incredible fundraiser - thank you to the Warburton Advancement League for raising $13,364 through their Eastern 80 bike ride in February.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve raised over $50,000 in five years for the kids of @RCHMelbourne!</p>

<p>VIRTUAL TIN SHAKERS INTRODUCED</p>
<p>This year’s Good Friday Appeal fundraiser has gone digital, but money can still be donated in support of the Royal Children’s Hospital.</p>
<p>A new initiative, called the Virtual Tin Shake will instead beam into the homes of Victorians in lieu of the usual sound of tins rattling on the streets.</p>
<p>The fund, which was inspired by the CFA, was set up to ensure the unwavering generosity of people across the state can still be felt by those who need it most.</p>
<p>Donations can still be made towards a town or area goal, as well as to the overall campaign.</p>
<p>Director of the Good Friday Appeal, Anne Randall, last week said the new-look fundraiser would “support all those in regional areas who would normally donate by putting coins in a Good Friday Appeal collection tin.”</p>
<p>“We really value the enormous contribution everyone makes to the health and wellbeing of our children,” she said.</p>
<p>The Virtual Tin Shake is off to a flying start with a total of $267,835 already donated to the cause by midday.</p>
<p>More than 6000 separate donations have been made, and 664 “tins” started by organisations, groups and individuals across the state.</p>

<p>As well as mum Georgie, dad Sam, older brother Harry, 6, and Lucy’s grandmother Janne — who put her life on hold to help out — friends, neighbours and strangers have come ­together for her. A local cafe even held a fundraiser.</p>
<p>But there’s also the many doctors, nurses and specialists after a cancer diagnosis.</p>
<p>It also takes a special child to attract such a following.</p>
<p>“She’s the captain,” Sam Lazzari says, looking at four-year-old Lucy. That much is clear as Lucy sits on her dad’s knee when we meet at the Royal Children’s Hospital.</p>
<p>The family are in the middle of a four-night stay to see if Lucy is ready to begin chemotherapy again.</p>
<p>She was diagnosed with a very rare bilateral Wilms ­tumour last October — a diagnosis which meant Lucy had tumours growing on each of her kidneys.</p>
<p>DONATE TO THE GOOD FRIDAY APPEAL</p>

<p>Usually bubbly and energetic, Lucy kept getting ­fatigued, and that started the alarm bells ringing.</p>
<p>“For about two months leading up to Lucy being diagnosed, she was just constantly unwell,” Mr Lazzari says. “Then she started to lose a bit of weight.</p>
<p>“She wasn’t eating, she had no appetite and she wanted to lie down all the time, as sitting up was so uncomfortable. She was just so out of sorts.”</p>
<p>Then she got a fever, but nothing could have prepared them for what was to come.</p>
<p>Ms Lazzari took Lucy to their local GP in Newtown, Geelong, and the doctor sent Lucy straight to Geelong Hospital for an X-ray and further testing. There, she was given the preliminary diagnosis of a Wilms tumour.</p>
<p>“They didn’t even have to say cancer. I knew,” said Ms Lazzari, who has herself ­battled cancer.</p>
<p>Lucy and family were transferred to the Royal Children’s Hospital in Melbourne, where her treatment began.</p>
<p>Doctors soon found Lucy had double trouble.</p>
<p>“On her left kidney there was an 18.5cm tumour, and they found lesions on her right kidney too. That was on the Thursday – on the Friday she had her port put in and started chemotherapy that night,” Mr Lazzari says.</p>
<p>“The moment it was bilateral, it was all hands on deck.”</p>
<p>Six weeks of treatment later, scans revealed Lucy’s ­tumours had shrunk, so she got the green light for surgery.</p>
<p>media_camera Lucy, 4, at home with her older brother Harry, 6. Picture: Alex Coppel</p>
<p>“It took eight hours. They removed her left kidney and found three tumours on it, and four on her right kidney,” Mr Lazzari says. “The right one was cherrypicked, stitched up and clamped (to preserve it).”</p>
<p>Since October, Lucy has also undergone eight lifesaving blood transfusions.</p>
<p>“Those blood transfusions are liquid gold,” her mum said.</p>
<p>“We can’t thank everyone enough. She was brought back to life. We are so grateful for those blood donors out there.”</p>
<p>Finally, after four nights in ICU and four nights on the ward post-surgery, the Lazzaris were allowed to return home.</p>
<p>Lucy has two more rounds of chemotherapy ahead of her — ending 26 weeks of treatment — and then regular three-monthly check-ups.</p>
<p>But she is back home, surrounded by so many who care.</p>
<p>“It really takes a village to get through a challenge like this. And we feel we’ve got the most incredible village out there,” Ms Lazzari says.</p>
<p>Lucy is one of the many children who enter the RCH each year. The Good Friday Appeal helps ensure they can receive the care they need.</p>

<p>ORLANDO’S ‘MARATHON’ AGAINST RARE CONDITION</p>
<p>Normal is not a word Orlando Gulizia’s family knows.</p>
<p>Their life has never been normal, and probably never will be.</p>
<p>In the last three years their life has consisted of doctors rooms, hospital beds, surgery, scans, and watching their youngest child – the cheeky one – deteriorate before their eyes.</p>
<p>“Prepare for a marathon, not a sprint,” was how it was put to parents Anna Surace and John Gulizia.</p>
<p>Orlando, 3, has a rare sub-form of paediatric brain cancer which to this day has not been diagnosed.</p>
<p>And although he has now been in remission for a year, the reality of that diagnosis – or lack thereof – meant Orlando was a regular at the Royal Children’s Hospital from the time he was 17-months-old.</p>
<p>media_camera Orlando Gulizia is a cheeky three-year-old. Picture: Alex Coppel media_camera The youngster had malignant tumours of central nervous system, and is now one year in remission.</p>
<p>The youngster had started to have absentee seizures and one day his parents couldn’t bring him out of the trance, prompting a trip to the emergency department and scans which revealed he had a 10mm growth on his brain.</p>
<p>“They advised us that it’s quite common for children to have abnormal growths in their brain which can cause seizures. With regular monitoring and medication they go on to live a normal life,” Mr Gulizia said.</p>
<p>So home again the family went, under the premise they would be back in a few months for an MRI and check-up.</p>
<p>But when the MRI came around, their world was shattered.</p>
<p>“I knew that there was something wrong,” Ms Surace said.</p>
<p>“I just knew that there was something wrong.”</p>

<p>THOMAS KEEPS FIGHTING</p>
<p>For a boy who has spent more than 600 days straight in hospital, young Thomas Collins is as happy as can be.</p>
<p>He’s a boy who has to be kept in the “plastic bubble” of his hospital room, but who laughs like he is having the most fun in the world.</p>
<p>He’s a boy who has learnt to physically push away his Dad so not to burn the man’s skin with the residue of chemotherapy, but with who he still shares the strongest of bonds.</p>
<p>media_camera Thomas Collins plays with his dad at the hospital. Picture: Alex Coppel</p>
<p>Thomas was born with a rare condition called severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a disorder that means his little immune system is as weak as they come.</p>
<p>SCID is caused by a mutation in groups of genes responsible for fighting off infection.</p>
<p>It’s meant Thomas and his parents Morgan and Leah Collins, who are originally from Brisbane, have spent most of their time in and out of hospitals as their two-and-a-half year old underwent endless testing.</p>
<p>“When he was six months of age he started getting infections, like colds and diarrhoea,” Mr Collins recalls.</p>
<p>“It took about seven months of repeated sickness and emergency departments … But he never got better, he just got sicker and sicker.</p>
<p>“All the tests that they were running he kept coming back negative.</p>
<p>“We got transferred to the Queensland Children’s Hospital where they had all the teams – they ran all the tests.</p>
<p>“Thomas was very unwell.”</p>

<p>EASTER SPIRIT NEEDED</p>
<p>The Good Friday Appeal has long held a place in the hearts of Victorians.</p>
<p>The tradition spans almost 90 years — a day to dig deep for the state’s littlest patients and raise money for the Royal Children’s Hospital.</p>
<p>Whether it be dropping change into tins at a local CFA branch, calling in to the Telethon or stopping at an intersection, making a donation to the hundreds of volunteers usually lining the streets of towns and cities, near and far.</p>
<p>It’s a day to be thankful for the world-class care we are so lucky to have on our doorstep and the medical superheroes who work magic inside the walls of the RCH.</p>
<p>But this year it looks a little different.</p>
<p>Amid the biggest battle of a generation, the coronavirus pandemic, the appeal has had to change and adapt.</p>
<p>The cause is just as important — if not more so — but there has been no media walking the wards, speaking to ­patients and their families and telling the stories of the little fighters inside.</p>
<p>There has been no tin-rattling by friendly volunteers on the streets.</p>
<p>media_camera Lucy in her bedroom at home. Picture: Alex Coppel</p>
<p>There will be no fanfare at the RCH on Friday and Friday evening’s Channel 7 telethon, hosted from 7pm by Jane Bunn and Peter Mitchell, will also take on a new look.</p>
<p>And despite the setbacks, the generosity of Victorians will still be felt.</p>
<p>The 15th annual Herald Sun/Transurban Run for the Kids, which was also called off due to virus fears, still raised a staggering $670,000 for the appeal as supporters rallied.</p>
<p>Major sponsor Transurban donated $100,000 of that total when the race was cancelled.</p>
<p>Race director Steve Moneghetti said he was inspired by the generosity of Victorians in trying circumstances.</p>
<p>“The Royal Children’s Hospital is a pretty special place and people still want to show their support,” he said.</p>
<p>“Though we didn’t get out there on the day and participate in a mass event, I think they found a way to show their support and loyalty to the hospital in other ways.”</p>
<p>Transurban group executive Henry Byrne said the company was proud of its contribution and would work to ensure next year’s race was bigger and better than ever.</p>
<p>“Never has there been a more important time to ­support the Royal Children’s Hospital,” he said.</p>
<p>Last year the appeal raised $18.17 million.</p>
<p>More than 600 children are treated at the RCH and in the community each day, thanks to the continued dedication of surgeons, doctors, nurses, staff and volunteers.</p>
<p>Please, dig deep and give what you can.</p>
<p>DONATE TO THE GOOD FRIDAY APPEAL</p>
<p>media_camera Maddox Ropati-Tui, 6, was diagnosed at birth with cystic fibrosis. Picture: Alex Coppel</p>
<p>LITTLE BATTLES WON AT HOME</p>
<p>Maddox Ropati-Tui has a hidden “superpower” — that’s what the youngster calls the port-a-cath buried in his chest.</p>
<p>The six-year-old, from South Yarra, was born with cystic fibrosis, a disease which affects the lungs and can make it hard to breathe.</p>
<p>It’s meant he’s needed regular treatment at the Royal Children’s Hospital since birth — from clearing mucus from his tiny lungs to getting vital medicine via the port-a-cath.</p>
<p>“As a new mum it added to the whole learning of everything,” Maddox’s mum Teuila says.</p>
<p>“You’re learning to be a new mum and learning about this medical condition and what our life would be like. It was our new normal.”</p>
<p>media_camera Maddox is spending more time out of hospital. Picture: Alex Coppel</p>
<p>But thanks to a new wave of at-home care by a team called Hospital in the Home, Maddox is spending more time with his mum and less time in hospital.</p>
<p>“We’re lucky,” Ms Ropati said. “Maddox has his port flushed every five weeks or so, and they visit us daily with the nurse. Whether he’s at school or when he was at daycare, I didn’t have to be there.</p>
<p>“And that service has enabled me to go back to work — that was lifesaving.”</p>
<p>Dr Penelope Bryant is the medical lead of the Hospital in the Home team.</p>
<p>She says being able to provide care to kids in a familiar environment, where possible, is always better.</p>
<p>“Their quality of life in general is just better – they’re laying with pets, outside playing basketball and with their siblings,” she said.</p>
<p>“We know that parents say their kids are just happier at home, the family is able to function better at home — the holistic look at the child (is better).</p>
<p>“It’s about trying to think a little bit outside the box.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to challenge ourselves and families. There are always new patients where we’re saying, ‘Why couldn’t we look after this child at home?’”</p>
<p>The mobile service has meant Maddox was able to start playing rugby for the first time – something that would not have been possible between regular hospital visits.</p>
<p>“That was the first sport he ever asked me to play,” Ms Ropati said.</p>
<p>“I thought, I can’t wrap him in cotton wool. He’s the strongest kid I know. He’s a happy kid, and just fearless.</p>
<p>“It’s amazing. I can’t speak highly enough (of Hospital in the Home). A ‘thank you’ will never be enough.”</p>
<p>media_camera Scarlett can now zip up and down on her scooter. Picture: Alex Coppel</p>
<p>Teaching a three-year-old how to move her muscles via videolink isn’t always easy, as there are distractions and difficulties.</p>
<p>But for Scarlett Khoo, it’s meant she can now zip up and down the footpath on her bright green scooter.</p>
<p>Scarlett has a rare disease known as transverse myelitis — an inflammation of the spinal cord, which interrupts the messages nerves send throughout her body — which has left her left arm paralysed.</p>
<p>She developed the disease at just 18 months after contracting the common childhood virus hand, foot and mouth disease.</p>
<p>“It’s a very rare condition,” Scarlett’s mum Felicity Khoo says. “She had the hand, foot and mouth disease about three or four days before her left arm was paralysed.</p>
<p>“She woke up and was just sitting there and her whole left arm was just limp.”</p>
<p>After a few trips to the Royal Children’s Hospital, Scarlett was finally diagnosed with the debilitating disease.</p>
<p>Her left arm still hasn’t recovered, stopping her from reaching up to her parents or lifting toys.</p>
<p>But last year surgeons operated on Scarlett’s shoulder to try and bring back more function to her arm.</p>
<p>“She lost most of her biceps muscle (due to the disease) — so they moved the triceps nerve to the deltoid muscle,” Ms Khoo said.</p>
<p>“She had no shoulder movement — she can’t lift up her arms high.”</p>
<p>It could take up to 18 months to tell if the procedure is successful.</p>
<p>It’s been a long road for the toddler, but she’s been helped all the way by a special rehabilitation team who have made it their mission to ensure she has been able to enjoy a normal childhood.</p>
<p>The team at the RCH have taught Scarlett how to grip the handlebars of her scooter properly — which she now races around on.</p>
<p>And she has regular telehealth sessions (telecommunication consultations) where all allied health teams — from physiotherapists to occupational therapists — can teach Scarlett new exercises or make changes to her rehab based on her physical surroundings.</p>
<p>Dr Olivia Lee is one of the 45-strong team of rehab consultants who provide such care to children from the hospital. They can be stroke patients, car crash victims or kids with rare conditions.</p>
<p>“As a team we work to get them back to a new normal,” Dr Lee says.</p>
<p>“From in hospital to in the community and at home … every kid has a different dream and with this disability we don’t want that dream to go.</p>
<p>“It’s based on looking at what their daily needs are.</p>
<p>“We have always tried to manage kids and support them in the community — with telehealth we’re able to troubleshoot their needs.”</p>
<p>Dr Lee said many children who required rehab were patients for life, meaning teams “watch them grow” and deal with all stages of home, school and even work life.</p>
<p>“We look at how to maximise function to be able to participate,” she said.</p>
<p>Scarlett will continue to see teams of specialists throughout her childhood, but her family is getting back to a new normal at home.</p>
<p>“She needs a lot of telehealth encouragement and entertainment,” Ms Khoo said.</p>
<p>“And we are still waiting for the surgery to work. It’s trial and error … to see whether it will be better for her, to see if she can gain some function.</p>
<p>“She will never recover fully, but otherwise she is a typical three-year-old.”</p>
<p>media_camera Kirra Wright has defied the odds. Picture: Alex Coppel</p>
<p>Five years ago Kirra Wright was learning to walk again. Today she is aiming for gold.</p>
<p>The 11-year-old’s goal is to compete at the 2024 Paralympic Games in Paris.</p>
<p>And despite having had a stroke at age two, and three major brain surgeries, she’s full of the grit and determination needed to get there.</p>
<p>Kirra is a state and national cross-country runner and a budding long jump contestant, and is being mentored by Olympian Brooke Stratton.</p>
<p>She has a chest of medals to her name, and is already running ahead of her older peers. But it hasn’t always been so positive for the Grade 6 pupil.</p>
<p>“She had a stroke when she was two in 2010 and had a 20-minute seizure,” Kirra’s mum Kylie Portelli says.</p>
<p>“We rushed her by ambulance to the Royal Children’s Hospital.</p>
<p>“It turned out that it was a brain AVM (arteriovenous malformation). That’s when her vessels, capillaries, arteries — all the major things in her brain — are clustered together like spaghetti. And because there was so much pressure it burst,” she said.</p>
<p>The two-year-old was rushed in for a marathon 12½ hours of surgery.</p>
<p>Ms Portelli and Kira’s dad Byron Wright feared the worst. But the surgery was a success and their little fighter bounced right back.</p>
<p>In 2012, and then again in 2015, Kirra had to undergo further procedures to remove more of the AVM.</p>
<p>“The bad one was 2015 because neurosurgeons had to go in deeper — a surgeon even told us that she wouldn’t be able to walk, her speech would be affected,” Ms Portelli said.</p>
<p>But Kirra again defied the odds.</p>
<p>Since then she had also had to manage a diagnosis of epilepsy and lives with cerebral palsy, but it hasn’t stopped her from reaching for the stars. And it’s patients like Kirra that make Dr Olivia Lee’s job so fulfilling.</p>
<p>“The key is finding a team in the community to support the family,” Dr Lee said.</p>
<p>“Whether it’s children who love sport, who want to get competitive.</p>
<p>“We used to have many individual programs, as well as group programs and transition programs. And we have peer groups.</p>
<p>“But we also have sports groups to help children find their place in the community.</p>
<p>“Rehab is all these little components — whatever the goals are.”</p>
<p>Ms Portelli said Kirra was a reflection of the support she continues to receive — both in and out of hospital.</p>
<p>“What makes her special is not just her persistence, but she’s had the support networks who say ‘Never give up’,” Ms Portelli said.</p>
<p>“Rehab has been absolutely amazing for Kirra. I said to her, ‘The sky’s the limit and life’s what you make it’.</p>
<p>“She’s come a long way from that kid in the hospital.”</p>
<p>WHAT THE GOOD FRIDAY APPEAL MEANS TO US</p>
<p>DAN ANDREWS, PREMIER OF VICTORIA</p>
<p>“The Royal Children’s Hospital is the best in the world for lots of reasons. One of them is that every Victorian owns a piece of it, and every Victorian contributes to its outstanding work every year through the magnificent Good Friday Appeal.”</p>
<p>media_camera Lord Mayor of Melbourne Sally Capp. Picture: AAP</p>
<p>SALLY CAPP, LORD MAYOR OF MELBOURNE</p>
<p>“To all the doctors, nurses and staff at The Royal Children’s Hospital – our city thanks you. Your work is always vital but everyone in our community understands the even greater sacrifices you are making during this COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>It is a selfless act to leave your families to take care of other people when they need it most.</p>
<p>The Good Friday Appeal is the time to show our thanks and gratitude by donating to help raise funds to allow The Royal Children’s Hospital to continue its crucial work.”</p>
<p>BRENDAN FEVOLA, EX-CARLTON, BRISBANE LIONS FULL-FORWARD</p>
<p>“The Royal Children’s Hospital is very close to my heart for many reasons. I first encountered the Royal Childrens as a young Carlton player in the early 2000s. I hated peak hour and would often kill half an hour by dropping into the hospital and visiting the kids. I would buy Carlton Packs and hand them out. I was always blown away with the resilience of these kids, how something so small would bring so much happiness, they would always have a smile on their face, despite what they were going through.</p>
<p>Little did I know that years on, I would find myself back there needing the care for my own child. When Leni was only a couple of months old, we found a small lump in her groin. It ended up being an infected gland and she needed surgery immediately. The team at the Royal Childrens were amazing.”</p>

<p>“In these troubled and uncertain times we should be more grateful than ever to the amazing staff at the RCH who are saving the lives of our children and doing everything in their power to care for them and ease their suffering. The love and joy that emanates from the RCH even in the toughest times is why it is the world’s best.”</p>
<p>TINA ARENA, AUSTRALIAN SINGER/SONGWRITER</p>
<p>“My son Gabriel has been to The Royal Children’s Hospital a few times and it just reminds you how essential our hospitals are. Gabriel was born in Paris, and I was so run down I had given him whooping cough. At seven weeks old he was hospitalised at the Hospital Necker, which is the RCH equivalent in Paris. Just the gift of medical staff there is something I will never forget. The Royal Children’s Hospital appeal is vital. And this year more than any other year it’s vital. We absolutely have to continue to raise money for them, they are an institution we all should be proud of.”</p>
<p>STEPH CHIOCCI, COLLINGWOOD AFLW CAPTAIN</p>
<p>“With what’s going on in the world we can’t forget our own, and the children that are in need. To the doctors and nurses, a big thank you. I don’t know how they do it. They’re the unsung heroes – we would be nothing without them. The Good Friday Appeal is much bigger than the individual.”</p>
<p>media_camera Comedian Joel Creasey.</p>
<p>JOEL CREASY, COMEDIAN</p>
<p>“I’ve absolutely loved being part of the Good Friday Appeal. The work the RCH does year-round is astounding. My younger sister is a Type 1 diabetic and</p>
<p>I remember visiting the children’s hospital in Perth when she was diagnosed and being amazed at the compassion of the staff. This year has only highlighted even more the importance of our medical workers and there is no better time to say thank you.”</p>
<p>GORGI COGHLAN, AMBASSADOR FOR RONALD MCDONALD HOUSE</p>
<p>“It is so important to support the Good Friday Appeal when families with sick children need so much help – even though we are facing our own problems and challenges.”</p>
<p>media_camera Dannii Minogue.</p>
<p>DANNII MINOGUE, AUSTRALIAN SINGER/SONGWRITER</p>
<p>“When our children are sick, life is stressful. When our children are in hospital, each minute can be life-changing. Kids need help, even during extremely challenging times such as the recent fires and this pandemic. Please donate if you can.”</p>
