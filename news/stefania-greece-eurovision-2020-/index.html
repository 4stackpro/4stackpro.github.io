The Eurovision 2020 slogan #OpenUp celebrates The Netherlands’ progressive values and its long history of welcoming the world to its shores. Rotterdam — among the world’s busiest ports — has played a central role in building those bridges. It was a gateway for Dutch explorers, but also the port of call for people arriving in Europe, often for the very first time. So it’s fitting, and somehow touching, that Greece decided to send Stefania — a Dutch singer of Greek descent — to sing at the Eurovision Song Contest in The Netherlands.</p>
<p>Stefania, who previously represented the Dutchies at Junior Eurovision, would have flown the flag of Greece — her mother’s country of birth. She’d have represented her Greek roots, but she would have been singing at home in the Netherlands — a powerful combination that would stir hearts and plenty of applause. The 17-year-old was set to sing “Superg!rl“, a song that encourages “teenagers to believe in themselves and go after their dreams.”</p>
<p>Thankfully she’ll have the chance to fulfil her Eurovision dream at Eurovision 2021 — Greece confirmed her for the gig immediately after ESC was cancelled.</p>
<p>Scroll down for the”Supergirl” lyrics</p>
<p>Greece in Eurovision 2020: Stefania “Superg!rl”</p>
<p>Stefania is a Dutch-born singer and actor, with Greek ancestry. She’d been on our radar since July as a potential act for Eurovision 2020. Stefania rose to fame in 2014, when she participated in the Dutch version of The Voice Kids. After wowing judges with her audition performance of Alicia Keys’ “No One”, she made it as far as the Battle round before being eliminated. She also sang as part of the Dutch children’s choir Kinderen voor Kinderen. In 2016, Stefania represented The Netherlands at Junior Eurovision in Malta, as part of the three-piece girl group Kisses. Their upbeat song “Kisses and Dancin’” placed eighth in the contest.</p>
<p>More recently, Stefania has turned her efforts to her solo pop career. Stefania recently released “Turn Around”, a sophisticated contemporary pop track. Stefania has also been working on her pop career in Greece. Last year, she performed at the Mad VMA music awards, as part of an all-girl cover of Daddy Yankee’s “Con calma”. The video of the performance has clocked up over 2.5 million views, inspiring comments from fans wanting Stefania for Eurovision.</p>
<p>What do the “Supergirl” lyrics mean?</p>
<p>The official announcement of the song spells out the meaning rather clearly: “‘Superg!rl&rsquo;” narrates Stefania’s own story since, as a young woman, she has had to find the power to combine her obligations as a student with her dream of singing.”</p>
<p>“We came up with a story with surrealistic elements,” says music video producer Kostas Karydas. “We followed a young woman who finds the strength to embrace her special abilities in a society that perceives her as an outcast. It is a journey to explore her inner strength.”</p>
<p>The “SUPERG!RL” music video brings that story to life. Filmed in four different locations around Athens, it shows Stefania to be a young woman who uses her talents for good — seeking to help those in need and to bring joy to her classmates — first in secret, but later with an openness and confidence that we can all learn from.</p>
<p>The video starts with Stefania cast as a supernatural being — floating above her bed and brushing her teeth and curling her hair using the powers of telepathy. She knows what’s inside of her, even if she has to shut if off when Mom comes knocking on the bathroom door. As she sings: “I got the power, climb up the tower, save all humanity on zero hour.”</p>
<p>A queen with a good heart, she exacts revenge on bullies harassing a classmate and saves another student from slipping on a Fyffes banana peel in the hallway. When the crowds begin to swarm — a reality Stefania understands all too well — she evacuates to contemplate her situation. Her self-contemplation coincides with the discovery of love, and she and her aforementioned classmate share secrets on a park bench. Stefania learns that the greatest power may well be love — and she pleads with her pal to open his heart: “Na-na-nothing can stop me, no-nobody can hold me down, standing in the light, it’s a new world, let me be your supergirl.”</p>
<p>She ultimately presses on — perseverance is a superpower in all of us — and heads to the dance studio where she continues to work and werk it out. During the bridge she spots a helpless kitty cat in distress and unleashes her power to fly above her peers and save it. Sometimes you have to reveal your gifts publicly in order to do what is right.</p>
<p>“SUPERGIRL” lyrics – Stefania (Greece ESC 2020)</p>
<p>Written and composed by: Dimitris Kontopolous / Sharon Vaughn / Gabriel Russell / Pavlos Manolis</p>
<p>Keep the phone booth, don’t need a super car</p>
<p>No x-ray vision to show them who we are</p>
<p>I got the power, climb up the tower</p>
<p>Save all humanity on zero hour</p>
<p>Na-na-nothing can stop me, no-nobody can hold me down</p>
<p>Standing in the light, it’s a new world, let me be your supergirl</p>
<p>Na-na-nothing can stop me, no-nobody can hold us down</p>
<p>Fighting in the dark over true love, let me be your supergirl</p>
<p>I’m your supergirl</p>
<p>Fighting from the heart</p>
<p>I’m your supergirl, supergirl, unana</p>
<p>In this crazy world, crazy world, unana</p>
<p>I’m your supergirl, supergirl, unana</p>
<p>Fighting from the heart, from the heart, unana</p>
<p>There’s no wonder it takes a woman</p>
<p>To be a hero more than a human</p>
<p>To overflow your heart with electricity</p>
<p>Find through the shadows your true identity</p>
<p>Na-na-nothing can stop me, no-nobody can hold me down</p>
<p>Standing in the light, it’s a new world, let me be your supergirl</p>
<p>Na-na-nothing can stop me, no-nobody can hold us down</p>
<p>Fighting in the dark over true love, let me be your supergirl</p>
<p>I’m your supergirl</p>
<p>Fighting from the heart</p>
<p>I’m your supergirl, supergirl, unana</p>
<p>In this crazy world, crazy world, unana</p>
<p>I’m your supergirl, supergirl, unana</p>
<p>Fighting from the heart, from the heart, unana</p>
<p>Fly, give me a signal and I’ll fly</p>
<p>On a supersonic high</p>
<p>Like a hero in the sky</p>
<p>I will stand by your side</p>
<p>I’m your supergirl, supergirl, unana</p>
<p>In this crazy world, crazy world, unana</p>
<p>I’m your supergirl, supergirl, unana</p>
<p>Fighting from the heart</p>
<p>I’m your supergirl, supergirl, unana</p>
<p>In this crazy world, crazy world, unana</p>
<p>I’m your supergirl, supergirl, unana</p>
<p>Fighting from the heart</p>
<p>I’m your supergirl</p>

<h3 id="stefania-sings-supergrl-live-during-dimitris-kontopoulos-unplugged-acoustic-session">Stefania sings “Superg!rl” live during Dimitris Kontopoulos unplugged acoustic session</h3>
<p><img src="https://wiwibloggs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stefania-supergirl-acoustic-qsessions-dimitrius.png" alt="img">
She’s the 17-year-old star who Greece handpicked for Eurovision 2020. And while she’ll have to wait another year to take her turn on that vast stage, Stefania has been keeping busy by making an unplugged version of her 2020 song “Superg!rl”. This also serves as her first live performance of the upbeat and uplifting pop number.</p>
<p>Stefania has done so as part of #Qsessions — an initiative from Greek songwriter and producer Dimitris Kontopoulos. Q, of course, is for quarantine. The maestro behind some of our favourite Eurovision hits wants to keep y’all entertained during lockdown, so he’s been collaborating with some of his beloved Eurovision alums and, in the case of Stefania, a soon-to-be ESC darling.</p>
<p>Writing on Instagram, Stefania said: “Thank you @dimitriskontopoulos for inviting me to your #Qsessions. I would have never imagined that the first time I would sing SUPERG!RL live would be under these circumstances! But don’t forget… ‘nothing can stop us, nothing can hold us down’ #Supergirl #Eurovision #Greece @eurovisionERT @arcade.music @sharon_vaughn.”</p>
<p>Stefania sings “Superg!rl” acoustic version</p>
<p>The video sees Dimitris performing on the keyboard, while a guitarist strums alongside his pooch. Meanwhile, young Stefania — shimmering in purple — delivers angelic vocals. Flowing from deep verses to soaring chorus, she shows that she’s got the chops to tackle this song — and whatever she dreams up for the next edition of Eurovision.</p>
<p>Demy (Greece 2017)</p>
<p>“Poses Hiliades Kalokairia” was the second extended play by Greek singer Demy, who you’ll remember from Eurovision 2017 in Kyiv.</p>
<p>Both the album and the single topped the Greek Albums Chart. Some of you may also have twerked to the dance remix, which is most definitely on our playlists.</p>
<p>Sakis Rouvas (Greece 2004 and 2009)</p>
<p>Sakis Rouvas — one of the few Eurovision artists to have performed at Eurovision multiple times and serve as host — proves that he’s much more than a pop star.</p>
<p>In this performance he lets the emotions flow while he hits each and every note. At times his eyes are shut and he is lost in the moment. 12 points to you Sakis!</p>

<h3 id="shell-be-back-greece-confirms-stefania-as-their-eurovision-2021-representative-following-eurovision-2020-cancellation">She’ll be back! Greece confirms Stefania as their Eurovision 2021 representative following Eurovision 2020 cancellation</h3>
<p><img src="https://wiwibloggs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/stefania-greece-eurovision-2020.jpg" alt="img">
Following the devastating and unprecedented cancellation of Eurovision 2020, silver linings have been popping up around the continent in the shape of Eurovision 2021 confirmations. The latest has come from Athens, with ERT confirming that Stefania will take to the stage for Greece at Eurovision 2021.</p>
<p>In response to the cancellation of the contest, ERT writes:</p>
<p>“ERT has already assessed the very positive reception from Greek and European audiences towards this year’s selection of the talented Stefania Liberakakis, as well as the cooperation we have had with her. ERT intends to continue this cooperation over time, as the EBU’s final decisions become known.”</p>
<p>This decision is not only significant for Greece, but also for Dutch audiences, as Stefania was born and raised in The Netherlands.</p>
<p>She has already competed on the Dutch edition of The Voice Kids and for The Netherlands at Junior Eurovision 2016 with the girl group Kisses. It seems only right that Stefania still has the chance to represent one of her countries onstage in her other home country.</p>
<p>Stefania has not yet responded to the cancellation of Eurovision, but we expect her to do so in due course, as she is set to appear on Dutch television this evening, for an interview with Eva Jinek.</p>
<p>What do you think? Are you pleased to hear that Greece has decided to hold onto their representative? Let us know in the comments!
