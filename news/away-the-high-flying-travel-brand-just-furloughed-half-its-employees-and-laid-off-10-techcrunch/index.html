Pretty much everyone is getting socked by the COVID-19 shutdown. Among the latest to say so in a public way is Away, the trendy, five-year-old, New York-based travel brand that has raised roughly $180 million from investors over the years, including a $100 million round last year that pegged the company’s valuation at $1.4 billion — nearly three times where it was valued a year earlier.</p>
<p>With travel down nearly 100% as the coronavirus makes its way across the U.S. and world, the company has seen sales of its product fall off a cliff, say company founders Steph Korey and Jen Rubio in a new Medium post. Specifically, they disclosed today, sales of their luggage, bags and interior organizers have fallen by more than 90% over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>The company, which began as a direct-to-consumer brand, first took steps to reduce its burn rate by shuttering its now 10 retail stores, while paying its retail teams “during what we hoped would be short-term closures.”</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, given that human capital is typically a company’s biggest cost center, that strategy didn’t go far enough, so the company is having to furlough “about half” of its team and it’s laying off another 10%, it says.</p>
<p>“This was a devastating decision and one we considered only as a last resort,” say Korey and Rubio in their post. “The pride we once had in the creation of so many opportunities for people is now fear, frustration, and concern for a large number of people who didn’t deserve this outcome. Many of these are people we personally hired, and many more are friends.”</p>
<p>The founders are also suspending their own salaries, they add, and they say senior leadership at the company has agreed to reduced salaries.</p>
<p>Away is doing this exactly the right way, by the way. Rubio and Korey say those laid off will receive a minimum of eight weeks of severance and will see their healthcare coverage through the end of June.</p>
<p>The company says it has also waived the vesting cliff on equity and extended the exercise period of stock options so affected employees don’t have to make decisions surrounding their equity while they’re frantically figuring out next steps for themselves.</p>
<p>They also note that owing to government assistance, its furloughed employees — many of whom work in customer support — should continue to receive 100% of their wages and benefits until they can resume work full time.</p>
<p>Away was described by some former employees as having a toxic culture in The Verge late last year, owing in part to CEO Korey’s management style. Soon after, Korey apologized and stepped aside. But weeks later she announced through The New York Times that, on second thought, she wasn’t going to give up her role at the company, a position she currently shares with Stuart Haselden, who agreed to join the company from Lululemon Athletica when Korey first stepped away.</p>
<p>Whether the two continue to share this role is another question and one that presumably depends on how long the current downturn lasts.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Away is smart to do everything in its power for employees whom it can no longer pay — and to get ahead of employee leaks about the layoffs by posting the news itself to Medium.</p>
<p>It’s not the first company to do so, of course. Last week, as one example, the CEO of the personalized stationery startup Minted, Mariam Naficy, also posted on Medium her letter to employees about layoffs at the company and precisely what former staffers could expect in the way of severance. It’s easy to imagine many others adopting the same playbook as the current state of affairs wears on.</p>
<p>They should. In both cases, the founders came across as savvy and compassionate on the whole. Their handling of a bad situation also stands in stark contrast to how some other startups have handled layoffs — and how they will be remembered for it when all is said and done.

<h3 id="prestigious-scientific-panel-tells-white-house-coronavirus-wont-go-away-with-warmer-weather">Prestigious scientific panel tells White House coronavirus won&rsquo;t go away with warmer weather</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200406144729-coronavirus-mask-california-0318-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) A prestigious scientific panel told the White House Tuesday that it doesn&rsquo;t look like coronavirus will go away once the weather warms up. President Trump has claimed that &ldquo;when it gets a little warmer [the virus] miraculously goes away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In their letter to the White House, members of a National Academy of Sciences committee said data is mixed on whether coronavirus spreads as easily in warm weather as it does in cold weather, but that it might not matter much given that so few people in the world are immune to coronavirus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is some evidence to suggest that [coronavirus] may transmit less efficiently in environments with higher ambient temperature and humidity; however, given the lack of host immunity globally, this reduction in transmission efficiency may not lead to a significant reduction in disease spread without the concomitant adoption of major public health interventions,&rdquo; according to the letter.</p>
<p>The letter noted, for example, that a study of the outbreak in China showed that even under maximum temperature and humidity conditions, the virus spread &ldquo;exponentially,&rdquo; with every infected person spreading it to nearly two other people on average.</p>
<p>Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, who is not a member of the NAS committee, said, &ldquo;Although we can hope weather will make some contribution to the reduction in transmission, we can&rsquo;t rely on it alone. We have to continue to employ social distancing and other measures to reduce transmission.&rdquo;

Video</p>
<p>Some dairy farmers are having to throw away thousands of litres of fresh milk due to disruption to the supply chain caused by coronavirus.</p>
<p>There is concern that some dairy farms may go out of a business, which could result in a milk shortage when demand returns after the pandemic.</p>
<p>The National Farmers&rsquo; Union has called for a crisis meeting with the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs &ldquo;to take immediate steps to ensure the sustainability of the dairy sector&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs says it has already put some measures in place to support the sector and would continue to work closely with farmers and the NFU.</p>
<p>The BBC spoke to one farmer based in the West Midlands.</p>
