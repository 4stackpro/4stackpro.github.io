<p>The crossword entry OCHS has appeared in the New York Times Crossword a total of 155 times, clued at times as the 1960s protest singer Phil OCHS, as the New York Times publishers Adolph OCHS or Arthur OCHS Sulzberger or as the Baron from the opera “Der Rosenkavalier.”</p>
<p>The protest song writer Mr. OCHS — who preferred to be called a “topical” singer — was the subject of a clue that stumped many solvers in the Wednesday, Aug. 21, crossword by Samuel Donaldson. He was known for his fiery and sometimes bitingly satirical songs protesting the Vietnam War, including “I Ain’t Marching Anymore” and “Draft Dodger Rag.” He also wrote songs about the civil rights issues of the early 1960s.</p>
<p>Mr. OCHS was born in El Paso on Dec. 19, 1940, and grew up in a nonpolitical, middle-class family. He formed his pacifist political beliefs while in college at Ohio State University, where he was majoring in journalism. “Phil started out singing at open mikes and passing the hat,” according to his brother, Sonny Ochs. “By 1964 he was well enough established to release his first album, ‘All the News That’s Fit to Sing.’ His second album, ‘I Ain’t Marching Anymore,’ was released in 1965, and by 1966 he was able to sell out Carnegie Hall for his solo concert.”</p>
<p>Multiple issues triggered an emotional downward spiral for Mr. OCHS: He felt that he had never achieved the fame he believed he deserved, an injury during a mugging destroyed part of his vocal range and he struggled for years with bipolar disorder and alcoholism. Mr. OCHS died by suicide in 1976 at the age of 35.

<p>Join Michelle Shocked on a wild adventure with her Les Chocolats, among the rumba traditions deeply embedded in Cuba, and emerged with a pitch-perfect synthesis of her bete noir, Copyfight for the debut of her forthcoming Musical Chairs: A Comparsa for Artist Rights.Intrepid does not begin to describe it. Michelle Shocked has returned from a wild adventure among the rumba traditions deeply embedded in Cuba, and emerged with a pitch-perfect synthesis of her bete noir, Copyfight (think Moby Dick, but instead of a giant whale, Google and Amazon) and rumba idioms nurtured in the private solars and public calles of Cuba. Were talking guaguanco, yambu, mozambique, son, changui, guaracha and yes, even a little boogaloo. Recall, please, the romance of Ry Cooders Buena Vista Social Club drifting across your latte at Starbucks in the 90s. Or Paul Simons Graceland coalescing international resistance against South African apartheid in the late 80s.Now open your minds and hearts, come listen to Michelle share her new studio effort, Musical Chairs: A Comparsa for Artist Rights, and hear her describe, first-hand, the fast-growing underground movement for sustainability for indepen&hellip; (read more)</p>

<p>Sonia Stein - Rockwood Music Hall</p>
<p>February 09, 2020 - New York</p>
<p>London based songstress Sonia Stein is an exciting new pop voice. Despite a restless upbringing of traversing across continents (Berlin, Poland, America) the music Sonia Stein creates is beautifully anchored. Quietly determined she creates the sort of songs that are full of drama and emotional complexities describing &lsquo;One Of Those Things&rsquo; as being about, &lsquo;The stage of denial about the end of a relationship with someone or something. You hold onto it out of comfort and fear, hoping if you wait a little longer, some semblance of what you had in the first place will show up again. ' Produced by Liam Howe (FKA Twigs, Adele, Jessie Ware) the slow-burn R&amp;B-tinged songs on her debut EP &lsquo;One Of Those Things&rsquo; feature four songs of exquisite balladry through to the delicious pop of later track &lsquo;Do You Love Me&rsquo;.Her songs unfurl themselves delicately, slowly creeping up on you when you least expect it. Like a sort of quiet devastation, these are songs that work their way into your subconscious and never let go.</p>

<p>Amuse presents Antigone - St Ignatius of Antioch</p>
<p>February 11, 2020 - Manhattan</p>
<p>Amuse Singers is thrilled to present the NY premiere of James Kallembachs haunting oratorio Antigone as part of our 2019-2020 Season. This visionary work for womens ensemble and cello quartet interpolates scenes from the Sophocles play with the writings of Sophie Scholl and the WWII White Rose resistance movement. Antigones exploration of unrest and the individual at odds with the state is as timely as ever, and it is a striking example of a necessary and ongoing commitment by womens ensembles to contribute to the currently underrepresented body of womens choral literature. The program also includes Joshua Shank&rsquo;s arrangement of Saro and Mary Montgomery Koppel&rsquo;s Mother of Exiles. All works were originally commissioned by the vanguard and visionary Boston-based women&rsquo;s ensemble, Lorelei. The concerts will take place on Sunday February 9 at 4 pm at St Johns Episcopal Church at 139 St. Johns Place in Brooklyn, and on Tuesday February 11 at 7:30 pm at St. Ignatius of Antioch at 552 West End Avenue in Manhattan. Advance tickets are $18 and can be purchased at <a href="http://www.amusesingers.org">www.amusesingers.org</a>. Tickets at the door are $25/$20 for students and seniors.</p>

It’s easy to hear this as one of those happy little “Kumbaya” sing-a-longs, but Staples is lacerating, calling out the world for, essentially, not understanding the universality of sadness and misery. This microbe is coming for everybody. She cries out for opening hearts and minds, and closing doors. “I gave up on hating you / Just for hating me” is a powerful, resonant line that speaks to everything. COVID-19 doesn’t care about race, or gender, or religion or social status. Staples, with her hushed, yet fervent delivery, delivers the goods. And the urgency builds with the instrumentation. “I need you / And you need me / We’re all in it together / And we got to get it right.”

<p>&ldquo;The Transfiguration of Benjamin Banneker&rdquo; by Theodora Skipitares - La MaMa</p>
<p>Through February 02, 2020 - NY</p>
<p>This production of magical puppetry, drumming and dance celebrates a pioneering African American astronomer who lived in Maryland from 1731 to 1806 and became one of his era&rsquo;s most outstanding engineers and astronomers. Theodora Skipitares is regarded as an outstanding master of giant puppet plays and no world premiere by her should be missed. Benjamin Banneker was a free man whose father and grandfather were formerly enslaved and whose grandmother was an English indentured servant. He taught himself mathematics and astronomy and became an outstanding scientist of his time, but is barely recognized for his groundbreaking discoveries. The play features dance, animated film, live music, puppetry and a multi-generational cast. Skipitares imagines that if Banneker were alive today, his passion for astronomy could have driven him into the Space Program. Part Two of the play considers how the development of the American space program interacted with the struggle for civil rights, centering on the case of Edward Dwight, Jr., who was selected to be the first African American astronaut trainee in 1961 but was not chosen by NASA to fly into space. Dwight resigned from the Air Force &hellip; (read more)</p>

<p>Guercino: Virtuoso Draftsman - The Morgan Library &amp; Museum</p>
<p>Through February 02, 2020 - Manhattan</p>
<p>Giovanni Francesco Barbieri, known as Guercino (15911666), was arguably the most interesting and diverse draftsman of the Italian Baroque era, a natural virtuoso who created brilliant drawings in a broad range of media. The Morgan owns more than twenty-five works by the artist, and these are the subject of a focused exhibition, supplemented by a handful of loans from public and private New York collections, to be held at the Morgan in the autumn of 2019. The exhibition will include sheets from all moments of the artist&rsquo;s career. His early awareness of the work of the Carracci in Bologna is documented by figures drawn from everyday life as well as brilliant caricatures; two drawings for Guercino&rsquo;s own drawing manual are further testament to his interest in questions of academic practice. Following his career, a range of preparatory drawings includes studies made in connection with his earliest altarpieces as well as his mature masterpieces, including multiple studies for several projects, allowing the visitor to see Guercino&rsquo;s mind at work as he reconsidered his ideas. The Morgan&rsquo;s holdings also include studies for engravings, as well as highly finished landscape and figure drawing&hellip; (read more)</p>
<p>Illusions of the Photographer: Duane Michals at the Morgan - The Morgan Library &amp; Museum</p>
<p>Through February 02, 2020 - Manhattan</p>
<p>Contemplative, confessional, and comedic, the art of Duane Michals exerts an appeal that transcends the conventional audience of photography. Since the early 1960s, Michals has worked past what he sees as the limitations of the camera: he writes in the margins of his prints, creates sequences of images that explore intangible human dilemmas (doubt, mortality, desire), and derives poetic effects from technical errors such as double exposure and motion blur. Illusions of the Photographer combines a full career retrospectivethe first on Michals to be organized by a New York City museumwith an artist&rsquo;s-choice show, as Michals plumbs the Morgan&rsquo;s vaults for treasures both revered and long-forgotten.</p>

<p>February 04, 2020 - New York</p>
<p>Michael Daves was born in 1977 in the southern empire of Atlanta, Georgia. He grew up playing bluegrass in that grand old tradition of staying up late &amp; singing real loud. As a young, impressionable-type person, he spent his free time at the venerable Freight Room, Atlanta&rsquo;s answer to the Opry. There he learned at the footlights of the masters: Dallas Burell, Del McCoury, John Hartford, Norman Blake, and many others, as well as family friends Whit Connah and Barbara Panter. Although he&rsquo;s since moved north, the humid south remains, lodged in his heart and sinus cavities.</p>
<p>Brother Roy - Rockwood Music Hall</p>
<p>February 04, 2020 - New York</p>
<p>Brother Roy is New York City&rsquo;s rock and roll missionary. It&rsquo;s impossible not to immediately like the guy when you walk into the bar. He looks like that guest who no one invited and was the last one to leave the party. But there&rsquo;s something timeless about his gruff croon accompanied by an unrelenting pulse on an old battered piano. You can&rsquo;t help but listen. He lists Harry Nilsson, The Beatles, The Band, Bob Dylan, Neil Young as some of his biggest influences. These are high standards to live up to, and many have tried and failed. But with a refreshing honesty, dedication, and healthy dose of self-deprecating humor, Brother Roy has managed to find a voice for himself in a genre so beloved that it might as well be a religion.</p>

<p>Pasquale Grasso - Solo Guitar - Cafe Bohemia</p>
<p>February 04, 2020 - New York</p>
<p>The best guitar player Ive heard in maybe my entire life is floating around now, Pasquale Grasso - Pat Metheny Vintage Guitar MagazineBorn in Italy and now based in New York City, the 30-year- old guitarist has developed an astounding technique and concept informed not by jazz guitarists so much as by bebop pioneers like Powell, Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie and the classical-guitar tradition. His new digital-only EP series, available beginning in June from Sony Masterworks, showcases Grasso in the solo-guitar format, where his intensive studies of both mid-century jazz and classical meld into a signature mastery that is, remarkably, at once unprecedented and evocative.</p>

Following the release of her bilingual folk debut deux visions in 2015, the French-born Vermont native took some time to regroup and reassess where she fits in the world.

<p>February 05, 2020 - New York</p>
<p>Singer-songwriter and music producer William Fitzsimmons&rsquo; latest record, &ldquo;Mission Bell&rdquo; is a chronicling of the tumultuous last year of his life, particularly of the separation from his second wife. An initial version of the album was originally recorded in Fitzsimmons&rsquo; home studio in the summer of 2017 but was subsequently abandoned during the course of, and as a result of, the separation.In 2018 William traveled to Nashville, TN to start recording the album over from square one. Working with producer Adam Landry (Deer Tick, Los Lobos, k.d. Lang, Vanessa Carlton), Fitzsimmons spent a month&rsquo;s time rebuilding the lost record, with contributions from friends, including Abby Gundersen and Rosie Thomas. The resulting 11-song album tells the story of a decade-long marriage destroyed and eventually rebuilt from the ground up.</p>

<p>Carter Burden Gallery Announces New Exhibitions by Re-Emerging NYC Artists - Carter Burden Gallery</p>
<p>Through February 05, 2020 - New York</p>
<p>Carter Burden Gallery presents three new exhibitions: Reconfigured in the East Gallery featuring Marilyn Church and Basia Goldsmith; Small Disturbances in the West gallery featuring Andrea Lilienthal; and On the Wall featuring Robert Petrick. The reception will be held January 9, 2020 from 6 - 8 p.m. The exhibition runs from January 9 through February 5, 2020 at 548 West 28th Street in New York City. The gallery hours are Tuesday - Friday, 11 a.m. - 5 p.m., Saturday 11 a.m. - 6 p.m. Marilyn Church presents large acrylic paintings of abstracted figures in Reconfigured. Although she occasionally strays into what seems like total abstraction, the figure has been a continuous theme throughout her career. The impact of the stories of victims and those charged, first fascinated her as a court room artist. A sense of intense emotion resonates in her works. Now, freed from any prescribed boundaries of subject matter, her work is based on improvisation, dream images and intuition.

<p>Sherman Ewing - Rockwood Music Hall</p>
<p>February 06, 2020 - New York</p>
<p>Sherman Ewing&rsquo;s music is his own unique mix, and suggests a maturity, despite his 40 young years, that come from developing a multi-dimensional sound. That sound can be traced back to his native Minnesota, a virtual rock and roll holy land of the midwest, home to wide ranging musical progeny, such as Bob Dylan, Prince, and Paul Westerberg. But his music also has traces of a New York street wise and weary artist, owing to the fact that he has called New York City and Brooklyn his home these past 17 years.</p>

<p>February 06, 2020 - New York</p>
<p>2 sets, 8PM and 10PM.Visit Eventbrite for early and late show tickets.About Mara Kaye:Mara Kaye is that rare cross-species phenomenon, a Blues Amphibian. When others &ldquo;sing the blues&rdquo; as if offering an unusual small plate at the tapas bar, Mara has so immersed herself in the idiom that she goes down to the bottom and doesn&rsquo;t need air until the show is over. She&rsquo;s a modernist rather than a museum piece: her creations can be darkly mournful, savagely vengeful, or gleefully erotic, but they are always leavened with Brooklyn spice. Think 1928 Bessie Smith or 1937 Billie Holiday leavened with street smarts. Her heart is in her music, and there is no pretense, no distance, as audiences from here to Russia, at Joe&rsquo;s Pub and Brooklyn dives have found out.- Michael Steinman, Jazz LivesAbout Jon-Erik Kellso:Trumpeter Jon-Erik Kellso has been leading The EarRegulars featuring guitarist Matt Munisteri and various guest artists at the Ear Inn on Sunday nights since 2007.

<p>Strawberry Blonde - Rockwood Music Hall</p>
<p>February 07, 2020 - New York</p>
<p>Strawberry Blonde formed in the basement of the SUNY Purchase Conservatory of Music in 2015, where Alex Frondelli (drums), Sean Power (bass), Carey Ozmun (trumpet/keys), Sam Barna (guitar), and Liam Connors (vocals/guitar) met while attending college. The band has drawn comparison to Foxing, The 1975, American Football, and Bon Iver with their eclectic mix of pulsating R&rsquo;n&rsquo;B-informed rhythms, layers of dreamy guitars, intricate horn arrangements, and powerfully introspective pop vocals. Their debut EP &ldquo;Better Still&rdquo; saw release in 2016, and the song &ldquo;Another Dream&rdquo; appeared in the film &ldquo;All Those Friendly People&rdquo; alongside the likes of Basement, Joyce Manor, and Funeral Suits. Their sophomore EP &ldquo;Calling&rdquo; released in January 2019, described by Jonathan Adams of HeavyBlogIsHeavy.com as sitting &ldquo;on the stitch between math-rock and indie-pop, perhaps meeting in that indie middle ground to find its cohesive sound.&rdquo;</p>

<li>The year that punk was born. With only hours left to spare it also produced a baby boy in the suburbs of Cork, Ireland, born with his ears piqued to the murmurs and clatter around him.As he grew the soundtrack changed. Nirvana on the Walkman. Leonard Cohen on his sister&rsquo;s stereo. The surge of bands and songwriters emerging from the 1990&rsquo;s Cork music scene. Later it became snippets of eavesdropped New York conversation. Tales of woe on the radio. The sights and sounds of tours across Europe.All of it gets woven into a tapestry of words. Then melody. Harmonies added in the studio. Electricity, sincerity, and humor on the stage. At the core of every Niall Connolly song is the story, one that unfolds a layer with each listen.</li>

<p>March 11, 2020 - New York</p>
<p>Age Limit: 18 and OverLife is a struggle. Even when things go our way, it&rsquo;s a constant swim against the tide, kicking against the current in the hope we&rsquo;ll eventually find the shore. That&rsquo;s the premise behind Dave Hause&rsquo;s fourth album, Kick. Kicking was the first thing he saw his newborn twins do and it&rsquo;s something he himself has been doing all his life. His career as a musician has spanned two decades, and his songs have always been a quest for personal survival about pushing through against the odds but his perspective shifted dramatically after the November 2016 election. This installment, out April 12th on Rise/BMG, finds Hause carrying on in the voice and tradition of classic American songwriters by tackling topics of hope, depression, global warming, a crumbling democracy, and growing old. These complex notions weave together with a joyous sing-along cadence that creates a soundtrack for the broken American dream.</p>

Examining how and why artists investigated the expressive capacities of line, color, and texture, Taking Shape highlights a number of abstract movements that developed in the Middle East, North Africa, and West Asia, as well as the Arab diaspora. Across these regions, individual artists and artist collectives grappled with issues of authenticity, national and regional identity, and the decolonization of culture. Drawn from the collection of the Barjeel Art Foundation based in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, the exhibition features nearly 90 works by a diverse group of artists such as Etel Adnan, Shakir Hassan Al Said, Kamal Boullata, Huguette Caland, Ahmed Cherkaoui, Saloua Raouda Choucair, Rachid Korachi, Mohamed Melehi, and Hassan Sharif, among others. On view are works produced by artists from countries including Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine, Qatar, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, and United Arab Emirates.

<p>In 2002, a small, timeworn leather trunk was discarded for garbage on a sidewalk in Lower Manhattan; it was found replete with the cherished keepsakes of a 19th century New York City woman. Thus began visual artist Stacy Renee Morrisons self-proclaimed love affair with Sylvia DeWolf Ostrander, whose early life parallels that of Gertrude Tredwell, who lived at 29 East 4th Street.For almost two decades, Ms. Morrison has been on an obsessive quest to weave together Sylvias life in the 19th century through the personal belongings she left behind and to re-imagine it in todays world through art and fashion.This is the first time Sylvias trunk and its treasured contents will be exhibited in public. On display, an invitation to a ball honoring the Prince of Wales in 1860, letters from the Civil War, Sylvias journals, mourning jewelry made of human hair, paper dolls, and other ephemera. Photographs and screen-printed clothing illustrate Sylvias life in the present as the artists muse.Stacy Renee Morrison is a visual artist who often forgets what century it is.

<h3 id="the-beatles-worst-album-is-actually-pretty-damned-great">&ldquo;The Beatles’ ‘Worst’ Album Is Actually Pretty Damned Great&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1588917157/200507-fleming-let-it-be-anniversary-tease_nxcq9a" alt="img">
Fifty years ago, on May 8, 1970, the Beatles, creators of the rock and roll LP as art form, released their final record, one whose title served as reminder, admonishment, and plain good advice to let the past be the past.</p>
<p>In a catalogue with a solid half-dozen albums that can make a case for the best the medium has produced—with some fun dark horses to stump for—Let It Be is almost universally cited as the group’s worst long-player. Having said as much once, I received death threats from assorted baby boomers whose Facebook profiles were littered with peace signs, but so it goes, one supposes, when the Beatles are on the dissecting table.</p>
<p>The irony is that I have always loved Let It Be, from the first time a friend played it for me when I was 15. I had been digging the early stuff hard—“She Loves You,” “I Want to Hold Your Hand,” “Please Please Me” and its winsome raucousness. He cued up the lo-fi urban folk of “Two of Us,” with that singular blend of Everly Brother harmonies and Nick Drake languor, prompting me to ask who this was. I wasn’t even sure at first. “Never mind who it is,” he said. “Just listen.”</p>
<p>That was a perfect way to get around the usual critical brickbats that dog Let It Be. Romanticists who prefer the Beatles’ run to end with a flourish of grandeur rather than the nuts-and-bolts realities of life—and artistic life—take comfort that Abbey Road, released in the autumn of 1969, was really the Beatles’ last album, given that Let It Be had been cut earlier that year and shelved. The band didn’t take a sanguine view of their potential product in Let It Be, with Lennon terming the results of the sessions “the shittiest piece of shit” his kickass beat combo had ever recorded.</p>
<p>Not that they were his band so much at that point. Paul McCartney had been funneled—though naysayers would say he usurped the position—into the unenviable role of musical director, chief cheerleader, leading energy source, old salt taskmaster.</p>
<p>It may well have been time for the Beatles to die—at least for a little while—and take up their second life as a band whose music would never really know past, present, and future again, matriculating to a place in the world’s storehouse of art that might as well have the word “timeless” carved into the door. I would argue, though, that Let It Be the record and Let It Be the film—as honest a rock ’n’ roll movie that has ever been made—were invaluable with that incising. One should sleep on neither, and spend time with both.</p>
<p>Let It Be is the lone Beatles album without a linear identity, which makes for freshness, if you can abide disjointedness in your art. Every other record, no matter how diversified, has an overarching theme. Beatles for Sale is autumnal, copper-sunned. Please Please Me is the studio version of a stage show. The White Album, which contains a solid two-dozen styles, is what we’d today call a flex, asserting, “Look at all that we can do.” Help! is the forced ebullience of the road. Revolver is Edwardian electro-futurism. Sgt. Pepper translates to Make Believe Day.</p>
<p>With Let It Be, we have the musical analogue of King Solomon deploying his blade, cleaving the Beatles-baby into two thematic halves—one would veer toward garage-rock primal, the other Wagnerian production thanks to producer Phil Spector, who was brought in, as Lennon said, to clean those shitty tapes. Regular producer George Martin hit the road for a spell, cheesed off by what George Harrison had previously called the rot that had set in. There was rot, yes—but attempts to freshen the house had not been entirely forsaken. They just hadn’t been worked out yet.</p>
<p>Spector, sophisticated as he may have been with his Wall of Sound, was also an early rock ’n’ roll guy. While the Stones and the Who were busy feasting on the blackest rhythm and blues they could find—which the Beatles also loved—the quartet from Liverpool had a major thing for pop and symphonic pop. Their tastes were as Catholic as tastes got for a rock ’n’ roll band in a time of overladen machismo, when you could be termed a sissy for adoring the Shirelles or the Ronettes, with whom Spector worked so memorably. Sometimes, Spector is straight up in your face, as with “The Long and Winding Road,” but that’s because he’s the post-production guru, not the man in the room. To be honest, most of the time I don’t really notice him. I notice the Beatles.</p>
<p>Opener “Two of Us” documents what for me is the finest sound there is, the one I wish to hear the most in this world, which I hope I will still be able to hear in the one after it: Lennon and McCartney singing in duet. They never did it as much as you’d think—you hear it on “If I Fell,” a portion of “The Ballad of John and Yoko,” the final verse of “Hey Jude.” Normally when they sang together it was with one doing the lead vocal, the other the harmony, but in a manner that it was hard to tell who handled the latter. That’s pretty damn rare, but that’s how well they interwove and how suited they were for each other as vocalists while working in completely different timbres.</p>
<p>I didn’t know they were singing about themselves when I first heard this song, with it’s lines of “You and me chasing paper / Getting nowhere”—a reference to their ongoing contractual and management squabbles—but what I heard while I listened with my friend was the sound of friendship. In one outtake, mid-verse, McCartney jokes, “Take it, Phil,” to his partner, referencing the two-part harmonies of the Everly Brothers, real-life brothers, as these men were Beatles’ brothers.</p>
<p>I’m not sure that is very different, especially if the tightness of the sound is any indication. The song is new, the song is old. It’s like what Dylan did on The Basement Tapes in that manner. Time laps time. Past, present, future pull up in a dead heat, three aside. No wonder, for a moment, I didn’t know exactly who this band was when I heard the first notes of the album, even if I’d been listening to them probably six hours a day at that point.</p>
<p>Even in their originals on Let It Be, there’s a lot of old-school rock.</p>
<p>The title cut, for instance, isn’t very far removed from something we could easily imagine Sam Cooke having written had he lived. The partial reason for the reach into the past is because of what was a lousy—or desperate, anyway—plan on McCartney’s part: setting up shop on a soundstage in Twickenham Studios and having a camera crew film the group early in the morning—despite the Beatles always being a late-night working band. Michael Lindsay-Hogg directs, but we might better say he allows us to witness. This is not what the Beatles did or were meant to do, so they turned to a musical palliative; meaning, going through scads and scads of covers, trying to “get it together,” in the parlance of the time.</p>
<p>“ In the unduly neglected “Let It Be” film of these proceedings, McCartney tries to rally Lennon by saying, starkly, that what they’re now dealing with is fear. This may be the most honest comment by a group member on film. ”</p>
<p>In the unduly neglected Let It Be film of these proceedings, McCartney tries to rally Lennon by saying, starkly, that what they’re now dealing with is fear. This may be the most honest comment by a group member on film. The Beatles, he says, are terrified. To get his argument across, he references an early club residency circa 1961. On the first night, the band was awful, couldn’t overcome their nerves. On the second night, they were a little better, though there was still nobody there, which was almost irrelevant. But each evening they progressed, and soon enough, in Beatles Toppermost of the Poppermost fashion, they had the audience—a big one—by the balls, and the audience loved it. Lennon looks distant as McCartney does his memory lane bit, a man who has all but left already, save in bodily form.</p>
<p>The Beatles are indeed frightened, at a loss for next moves. Anyone who has ever been in a band, either at the level of downing some beers and blasting away in a basement on a Friday night or if you’ve conquered the world, understands band spats, band-based anxiety. Being in a band is a series of incongruities the collective works to pave over, to make congruous.</p>
<p>For the Beatles, that required a calming of nerves and a reacquisition of swagger. So they turned to 1950s rock. They went so far as to encode it in new songs they were writing (“I’ve Got a Feeling,” “Dig It”) and in the old songs they’d already written which they ripped from their dusty songwriting notebooks with volcanic intensity. To wit: the churning, scorching, rip-snortin’ guitar fest that is “One After 909.” If you go back to the March 5, 1963, session when the band tried again and again to cut a master take of the tune—which didn’t happen—with Lennon making fun of George Harrison for a guitar solo that sounded like it was played with an elastic band, then consider the Let It Be version. You’ll struggle to process the gulf. That was Gerry and the Pacemakers stuff—pleasing, but twee—in 1963; Cream in their full-bore guitar glory might be intimidated with the sonic pasting the 1969 Beatles give “One After 909.”</p>
<p>Let It Be the film, which joined its album counterpart with a release on May 13, 1970, has long been stashed behind a Kafkaesque veil of intrigue, as if state-suppressed by the official Beatles brand. If you read about it in reference books, it’s treated like the Star Club recordings of 1962—a curio at best, or maybe just crap. The upcoming Peter Jackson film is going to put the smiley face on these sessions, but I’d argue they were never about highs or lows, nor ennui or ambivalence; they were a search for direction, which is perhaps the common denominator of any band that has ever been, for however long it has existed.</p>
<p>Lennon ducked into a theater after the Beatles were no more to see Let It Be for the first time, weeping as he watched. This was not a sentimental man. If you cite “Imagine,” I will respond by saying that that was more a business move—and a trite one—than anything this person truly carried with them in life. Let It Be, though, is a wallop of honesty. It’s a great film, the purest film about making music with your mates.</p>
<p>There is flab at times on the musicianship. The band attempt to play themselves into shape, tighten the grooves. When they smoke, they could burn down a forest in mere seconds, as when we see them up on the Apple roof in late January. They hadn’t a clue how to end these sessions, so once more they went to what they knew, where they could discover something new: the gig. The Beatles were the ultimate giggers.</p>
<p>Malcolm Gladwell will try to tell you this is what made them, but it wasn’t. The songwriting gifts Lennon and McCartney entered this world with is what carries the Beatles’ day, then and now, and forever, I should think. You can try all you want, but you’re not going to be able to learn what they knew, what was even more a part of who they were than their DNA. You work to hone what you have—but if you’re not born with it, you’re not writing “Let It Be.”</p>
<p>Usually when we hear “Let It Be,” it’s the single version. McCartney could have sung in the Baptist Church, which may seem an odd quality for a white northern English lad, but he excelled at working up to a spiritual froth, one reason Cavern compere Bob Wooler heard “The Hippy Hippy Shake” and thought it’d be perfect for McCartney—it’s the Soul Stirrers with overt secularism. The guitar solo on the single version of “Let It Be” is downright anodyne, though. It’s not very far off from the clumsy soloing back in spring 1963 with the shelved “One After 909.” But listen to the album version—the solo will rip your head off.</p>
<p>This was a unit that was not going to be able to sustain itself because John Lennon, for a variety of reasons, was now a passenger. Part of that was his own diminished drive, so far as Beatles matters went. But this was not a person equipped to be a passenger in the band he started, any more than, say, Aaron Rodgers would be a willing backup in the NFL. There were always times when one of the two chief Beatles drove the bus and the other sat a few seats back. Lennon dominated A Hard Day’s Night and Rubber Soul; McCartney could claim Revolver and Sgt. Pepper. Lennon will have his moments in these sessions and on the Let It Be album—he plays some of the best lead guitar work of his life on “Get Back,” for instance. But he’s like that employee who’s given two weeks’ notice.</p>
<p>I think the people who vet these historical matters are lazy when they say that Let It Be isn’t much of a record, because what they want to do is maintain this narrative of: here is a band fizzling out, which will rally one last time—as if they were duty-bound to do so—with Abbey Road. I don’t hear fizzle, though. Nor do I see it in Let It Be the film. There’s not necessarily happiness so much as spiritedness; the solidarity to a shared love of rock and roll remains, but that doesn’t mean that one doesn’t see the door and feel a tug to walk through it.</p>
<p>I love the stories of the early days, the band trying to make it, cutting Please Please Me in 585 minutes, veins bursting out of necks in a mad hunt for fame and recognition, but I don’t think the Beatles were more alive then than they were when they were trying to quell their anxiety as film cameras rolled.</p>
<p>It’s really not that different from being on that concert stage, in that empty hall, back in 1961, when the directive was to make something be, rather than let it have its space. Both are central to life. Which is why Let It Be will always be central to the Beatles. You can dig it if you want, and you don’t even have to ask nicely.
