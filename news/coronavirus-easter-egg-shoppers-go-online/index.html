<p>Upmarket chocolate retailer Hotel Chocolat closed all its UK stores three weeks ago. The firm was forced to &ldquo;turn on a sixpence&rdquo; reorganising the warehouse to make it safe for staff. But it has paid off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it turns out, we&rsquo;ve sold more Easter eggs than last year,&rdquo; says boss Angus Thirlwell.</p>
<p>Online sales of Easter eggs are surging as UK consumers turn to the internet during the coronavirus lockdown.</p>
<p>Thorntons too said it had seen &ldquo;a significant increase in online orders&rdquo; since the lockdown started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Demand is four times higher than average - and we have received approximately one million visitors to our site this week,&rdquo; they added.</p>
<p>Easter is big business in Britain. In 2019, consumers spent £1.1bn on buying items to celebrate the festival, according to research firm Mintel, with £206m of that spent on Easter eggs alone.</p>
<p>But with the coronavirus lockdown preventing families and friends from meeting up to celebrate and Easter egg hunt activities cancelled, the usual opportunities for buying and sharing the traditional treats are limited.</p>
<p>Image copyright Thorntons Image caption Thorntons opens its website for just two hours each days to accept new customer orders</p>
<p>Facing the surge in online traffic, Thorntons has decided to open its website at 09:00 each day for just one or two hours for customer orders, before closing it again.</p>
<p>Hotel Chocolat is taking a different approach. Rather than have its staff waste time searching for products in the warehouse to fulfil orders, the chocolate maker has reduced the range of products that people can purchase online.</p>
<p>Instead, the retailer has created themed bundles and pre-packs the items into boxes the moment they come off the production line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve created 30 new products from scratch,&rdquo; said Mr Thirlwell, adding that customers had been much less demanding about their packages during the lockdown than they would typically be.</p>
<p>Discounting in supermarkets</p>
<p>In contrast, aisles fully stocked with Easter eggs have been widely discounted in supermarkets across the UK in the last two weeks, which is unusual for the run-up to the Easter holiday weekend.</p>
<p>In Tesco, almost all branded Easter eggs are selling on two-for-one deals, while Sainsbury&rsquo;s lifted its three-item limit per customer on Easter eggs several days before it eased restrictions on other food products.</p>
<p>Image caption Supermarkets have been heavily discounting Easter eggs in stores</p>
<p>The BBC asked Tesco and Sainsbury&rsquo;s about their Easter egg sales, but the supermarkets declined to comment.</p>
<p>Chocolate manufacturer Kinnerton Confectionery makes many of the branded Easter eggs sold in these supermarkets, and it too has seen demand move online.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With travel restrictions extending over Easter, consumers have turned to order Easter eggs online for home delivery to their loved ones,&rdquo; Julia Catton, marketing and innovation director at Zertus UK, the parent company for Kinnerton Confectionery and several other chocolate brands, told the BBC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of our major customers have increased their online range to help customers, but this has been further hampered by limitation of home delivery slots in many retailers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kinnerton itself set up a new online shop to allow customers of its Nomo vegan and &ldquo;free-from&rdquo; chocolate range to make direct orders if they couldn&rsquo;t get the products from supermarkets.</p>
<p>However, according to US market research firm IRI, overall Easter confectionery sales for the week ending 28 March were down 17% year-on-year.</p>
<p>Ms Catton added: &ldquo;The next few days will be important for Easter egg sales to see if demand improves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other analysts also feel that there will be a significant impact on Easter spending, and that not everyone is buying Easter eggs.</p>
<p>Independent retail expert Kate Hardcastle says consumers will have to decide between the must-haves and nice-to-haves: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just not front-of-mind focus for anyone, and it&rsquo;s also an extra cost for a lot of families they just can&rsquo;t afford.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mintel is running a weekly survey tracking the impacts of coronavirus on consumer spending in the UK. It says that in the last week, almost a quarter of British consumers increased the shopping they are doing online.</p>
<p>But in the last seven days, it also found that 46% of consumers have cut back on non-essential spending.</p>
<p>Despite this, Hotel Chocolat&rsquo;s Angus Thirlwell says that his business is seeing consumer behaviour it&rsquo;s never seen before in its 27-year-history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of people using online food shopping for the first time. People are asking for help in making orders on the online chat and calling customer service,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Hotel Chocolat is also seeing customer messages that show a shift in consumer habits, says Mr Thirlwell: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing messages like, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s something to keep your strength up&rsquo;, or &lsquo;Thinking of you&rsquo;, sent to key workers, and families saying &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s some chocolate so we can FaceTime eating chocolate together&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chocolate does play an important part in keeping morale up.&rdquo;

Archbishop of Canterbury among those who will broadcast to worshippers online</p>
<p>Churches and cathedrals across the UK are preparing to hold Easter services online as Christians face the most important festival of their year under lockdown.</p>
<p>The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will lead a service on Sunday broadcast from an iPad in his kitchen. Usually he preaches to 1,500 worshippers in Canterbury Cathedral.</p>
<p>Welby will say: “After so much suffering, so much heroism from key workers and the NHS, we cannot be content to go back to what was before as if all is normal. There needs to be a resurrection of our common life.”</p>
<p>He will acknowledge that “many people right across the country are anxious about employment, food, are isolated from loved ones and feel that the future looks dark. People right across the globe feel the same uncertainty, fear, despair and isolation. But you are not alone.”</p>
<p>Welby’s wife, Caroline, will read a lesson, and they will be joined online by Rose Hudson-Wilkin, the bishop of Dover, and 10-year-old Theodore Levings, who will lead prayers.</p>
<p>The service will be broadcast live on BBC Radio 4 and streamed on the Church of England’s Facebook page and website from 9am.</p>
<p>Acts of worship have been streamed from clergy homes since the Church of England closed all its churches, even to priests and for private prayer, as part of the coronavirus lockdown.</p>
<p>According to the C of E, more than 2 million people have tuned in to national streamed services, and additional large audiences have watched more than 3,000 services streamed from local churches.</p>
<p>The Church of Scotland is streaming a service led by its moderator, the Right Rev Colin Sinclair, on Easter Sunday morning and is inviting people to join a prayer at 7pm, in both English and Gaelic, broadcast on its website. Local churches will be holding acts of worship online.</p>
<p>The Catholic church in England and Wales has also reported high numbers of people joining online services. Sunday mass at Plymouth Cathedral usually attracts up to 650 worshippers, but 2,200 people tuned in for last week’s Palm Sunday service. Those joining weekday online masses have doubled to 700 on some days. Weekly evening prayer, usually attended by about a dozen worshippers, is attracting between 200 and 400 people.</p>
<p>Mark O’Toole, the Catholic bishop of Plymouth, said: “This period of isolation has given us the confidence to embrace new platforms to communicate God’s message of love and hope. This is sorely needed at this time.”</p>
<p>Anglican cathedrals are finding creative ways to celebrate Holy Week. At Bristol, nearly 40 choristers have joined a special “quirentine” multi-track performance of This Joyful Eastertide, recorded in isolation from one another.</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest Bristol Cathedral choir take part in a ‘quirentine’.</p>
<p>Lincoln Cathedral has been illuminated in purple and white – and blue in support of the NHS on Thursday – before turning dark for Good Friday when the church enters a period of mourning. It will be lit in gold on Easter Sunday to celebrate the resurrection.</p>
<p>Salisbury Cathedral has created a virtual Holy Week pilgrimage. Those wishing to pray or reflect can activate a different window of music, reading and prayer each day.</p>
<p>Passion plays, depicting the crucifixion of Jesus, which were due to be performed in at least 10 locations across the UK, involving thousands of amateur performers, have been cancelled. Last year, more than 20,000 people watched The Passion of Jesus in Trafalgar Square in London.</p>
<p>Prerecorded reflections from faith leaders, rehearsal clips and interviews will instead be streamed on Friday, along with a screening of the 2019 Trafalgar Square performance.

<h3 id="family-history-inscribed-on-easter-eggs">Family History, Inscribed on Easter Eggs</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/09/science/00TIES-EASTER/00TIES-EASTER-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
“Well, the chicken sure as hell won’t recognize it now!” Baba says, wiping away my tears with the same cloth she uses to clean up the broken egg. “You’ll make more.” At the time, I don’t understand the full meaning of her words. It’s evening and we don’t make any more eggs that day. My egg is gone.</p>
<p>But over the next 30 years, in the weeks leading up to Easter, we will settle ourselves around her table to make dozens of pysanka. One year, I will knock over the candle with the sleeve of my hoodie and the newspaper will catch fire. Beating out the flames with a wet tea towel, Baba will crush all of our pysanka and we will have nothing to show for ourselves that year. Whether I was a brooding teenager, working on my university degree, or struggling through an abusive relationship, our spring ritual never changed.</p>
<p>When Baba is in her late 80s, we convene at her table, still blistered from The Great Pysanka Fire of ’83. The eggs that I’ve picked up at the store, she laments, are not as large as the ones her chickens used to lay. But at least we don’t have to clean them. Baba has laid out old newspaper, wax and kiskas that she has unclogged and refurbished. She lights the candle and we begin. She pulls her kiska around the egg. I can see the line veering off to the right; the two ends will never connect. The points of her stars are uneven, like the ones I’d made as a child.</p>
<p>“I’m finished. I can’t see,” she says, setting down her egg and kiska. She won’t pick them up ever again. She rubs her eyes, but the cataracts that block her vision can’t be wiped away.</p>
<p>“Just paint it so the chicken doesn’t recognize it,” I say. I melt the wax from one of my pysanka to reveal golden suns and sprigs of wheat layered onto a backdrop of geometric red and white stars. Baba picks it up and turns it over in hands that are bent from arthritis.</p>
<p>“Knowledge and growth,” she nods, pointing out the symbolism of this pattern.</p>
<p>By her mid 90s, Baba must move off the farm and into a nursing home. Open flames are not permitted there because many people have oxygen tanks. But I continue the ritual without her. As the snow melts, I carefully pack the pysanka into cartons and bring them to her for inspection. She picks up an egg and gently rolls it between her fingers as she asks about the fall harvest. It is spring. She feels the egg more than she looks at it now. I know that I am slowly losing her, but the pysanka still bond us.</p>
<p>Baba passed away two winters ago, at 101 years old. Before the coffin closed, I placed two pysanka near her folded hands — one of hers and one of mine.
