Sir Elton John has had some very well known relationships in his life. He has been married twice and has had relationships with both men and women, many highly publicised, before coming out as gay. Now he is settled down with two children with his long-term husband, David Furnish.</p>
<p>In the late 1960s, before Elton John was a big name as a performer, he was engaged to secretary Linda Woodrow.</p>
<p>Linda has since spoken about their relationship, saying she was devastated about their break-up, which happened a month or so before his first big hit Your Song.</p>
<p>She told the Daily Mirror: “We were a month away from the wedding when he drunkenly woke me up and told me it was off.</p>
<p>“Then he called his stepfather to come and get him. He walked out and that was it.</p>

<h3 id="elton-john-had-a-specific-person-in-mind-when-he-sang-the-btch-is-back">Elton John Had a Specific Person in Mind When He Sang ‘The B*tch Is Back’</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/elton-john-and-taupins.jpg" alt="img">
When Elton John broke through with his first top-10 hit, “Your Song,” listeners got a classic love song with a tender message. Bernie Taupin, John’s lyricist for the past six decades, penned lyrics that anyone of any age could sing along to without embarrassment.</p>
<p>That innocence wouldn’t stick for long in the career of the great songwriting duo. By the time John started his run of No. 1 hits in America, the themes and lyrics were much wilder. “I Think I’m Gonna Kill Myself,” from John’s Honky Chateau (1972), offers a perfect example.</p>
<p>The trend continued with Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (1973), which featured “Jamaica Jerk-Off” on the first side. In early 2020, Taupin looked back on that album with amusement. “It is a pretty blue record,” he told the Los Angeles Times. “I was a young kid, a horny 23-year-old, among a lot of other horny twenty-somethings.”</p>
<p>When fans picked up Caribou (1974) the following year, Taupin and John had one of their most audacious song titles to date. It came right up front as the opening track of the album: “The B*tch Is Back.”</p>
<p>The song title came from Bernie Taupin’s wife, Maxine</p>

<p>Songwriters get ideas from all sorts of places. For example, Taupin wrote “Tiny Dancer” for his wife, Maxine, whom he married in 1971. While she wasn’t a “seamstress for the band,” she did know her way around a thread and needle.</p>
<p>“When we were touring and Elton and I were shopping, we would often go to tourist stores,” Maxine Taupin told The Hollywood Reporter in 2019. “[Elton] would buy these little round patches that I would sew on his denim jacket and his jeans.”</p>
<p>That may have been the extent of her sewing, but she had plenty more to offer John and her husband as far as the songwriting process went. In fact, Taupin said she originally came up with the title to “The B*tch Is Back.”</p>
<p>“Everyone knows [that] came from something I said,” she told THR. While she and her husband were visiting John at the end of a tour, the phrase apparently just jumped out of her mouth.</p>
<p>Maxine Taupin was referring to Elton John himself as ‘the b*tch’</p>

<p>If you’ve ever read the tales of a band on tour in the ’70s, you know how wild things could get — and much can go wrong in the way of travel, personnel, etc. And the Taupins found John at the end of one of those tours in the early part of the decade.</p>
<p>“[Elton] was telling us about what went on, how exhausted he was and this happened and this didn’t and just on and on and on,” Taupin told THR. “I looked over at Bernie and rolled my eyes and said, ‘Oh, the bitch is back.’ And we all just started laughing hysterically.”</p>
<p>John would adopt it as something of a theme song. “This is a song not referring to anyone in the audience, but mainly to me,” he told an audience in 1974 before launching into the track. “I’m a b<em>tch, I’m a b</em>tch, oh, the b*tch is back,” he sang. And despite the problems some DJs had playing the song, it still reached No. 4 on the Billboard charts that year.</p>

<h3 id="revisiting-rare-1970-footage-of-elton-john-revealing-how-he-wrote-tiny-dancer">Revisiting rare 1970 footage of Elton John revealing how he wrote ‘Tiny Dancer’</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/faroutmagazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Revisiting-rare-1970-footage-of-Elton-John-revealing-how-he-wrote-Tiny-Dancer.jpg?fit=800%2C601&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
Elton John’s career is full of high watermarks and, quite rightly, ‘Tiny Dancer’ sits right up there on the top table with the best that the Rocketman has created throughout his remarkable career</p>
<p>The pièce de résistance featured as the first track on Elton’s 1971 record Madman Across The Water but is creation was formed the year before the release of the album. However, we have dug around in the Far Out archives and stumbled upon this astonishing footage from the year previous which was shot just after the writing of ‘Tiny Dancer’. The astounding video shows John sitting by a piano, talking through the track and his creative process as well as showcasing it for the very first time in public.</p>
<p>This archival video is remarkable in every sense, allowing a fresh insight into such a beloved track straight after its conception. One undeniable addition that makes this footage even more special is seeing how enthusiastic Elton is about the song and, more poignantly, watching his desire to show off his latest masterpiece to the world.</p>
<p>“These are all lyrics and I just sift through them,” John says about the words provided to him by his long-time collaborator Bernie Taupin. He then nonchalantly adds: “There’s one here I did just the other day called ‘Tiny Dancer,’ which is about Bernie’s girlfriend. I looked through all them and this is the one I fancied doing, mainly because I knew Bernie would like me to do this one.”</p>
<p>The iconic artist then explains in detail his creative process in transferring Taupin’s lyrics into songs: “Look at the words,” he says, reading off the first verse of the song straight from the original manuscript. “As soon as you get to the word ‘ballerina’ you know it’s not going to be fast. It’s going to be gentle and sort of quite slow.” John then begins to play an early version of the tune which deviates slightly from the one we all know and love, but you can hear the key elements which are still there.</p>
<p>Check out the archival footage, below.</p>
