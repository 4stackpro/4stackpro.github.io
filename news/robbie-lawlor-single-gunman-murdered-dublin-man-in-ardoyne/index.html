<p>A single gunman murdered a 36-year-old Dublin man in north Belfast on Saturday, police have said.</p>
<p>Robbie Lawlor was shot multiple times outside a house on Etna Drive in Ardoyne at about 11:50 BST.</p>
<p>Mr Lawlor was a suspect in the murder of a 17-year-old in County Louth in January. It is understood he was a senior figure in a feuding criminal gang.</p>
<p>Three men and a teenager have been arrested over the killing.</p>
<p>The men are aged 27, 30 and 33, while the teenager is 17 years old.</p>
<p>Image copyright PACEMAKER Image caption Forensic teams at the scene of the killing on Etna Drive on Saturday</p>
<p>Three were detained on Saturday - the fourth was arrested on Sunday.</p>
<p>The police have described the killing as &ldquo;brutal&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On Sunday evening, PSNI Det Supt Jason Murphy said the murder weapon had not yet been recovered, although two properties, one in west Belfast and one in Crumlin, were searched.</p>
<p>Mr Murphy said he did not believe Mr Lawlor was in Ardoyne on Saturday &ldquo;by accident&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe he had some reason to be there and key lines of enquiry for me, at this stage, are to establish why he was there and what his connection to the address is,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Mr Lawlor was well known to gardaí (Irish police) for his involvement in serious and organised crime, according to RTÉ (the Irish broadcaster).</p>
<p>RTÉ said he had more than 100 previous convictions and had been warned by gardaí that his life was in danger before he travelled to Belfast.</p>
<p>He was also a suspect for at least three other gangland murders.</p>
<p>Det Supt Murphy said he was keen to hear from anyone who was in Etna Drive between 11:00 and 12.30 BST on Saturday, and who may have witnessed the shooting or the gunman escaping.</p>
<p>He also appealed for help in tracing the movements of a VW Sirocco car, registration YLZ 7052.</p>
<p>Image copyright PAcemaker Image caption A car was found burnt out near the crime scene</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it was in Estoril Park on Friday and was burnt out in Kingston Court immediately after the murder yesterday,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Neighbours had previously described how they tried to save Mr Lawlor.</p>
<p>One man said he &ldquo;heard four big bangs and ran outside to see what was happening&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He said he saw him &ldquo;stumbling out of the garden&rdquo; and that he ran over to help him after he collapsed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried doing CPR but I couldn&rsquo;t save him,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Another witness said she ran to help but that Mr Lawlor was already dead so she put a sheet over him to &ldquo;give him some dignity&rdquo;.

<p>&ldquo;Not only did they carry out this callous murder leaving a family experiencing their worst nightmare, but they did not care that children and other members of this north Belfast community were placed at risk.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="keane-mulready-woods-murder-suspect-shot-dead-in-belfast">Keane Mulready Woods murder suspect shot dead in Belfast</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.irishexaminer.com/remote/media.central.ie/media/images/k/KeaneMulreadyWoodsMurderVictimJan2020_large.jpg?width=648&amp;s=ie-992323" alt="img">
The chief suspect in the murder and dismemberment of 17-year-old Keane Mulready Woods was gunned down in Belfast on Saturday.</p>
<p>Said to be one of Ireland’s most feared underworld figures, father-of-three Robbie Lawlor, 35, from Coolock in Dublin, was shot dead at Etna Drive, a residential area in the Ardoyne.</p>
<p>He had been in hiding since the murder in January of Keane Mulready Woods, which shocked the nation due to the victim’s age and the brutality of his killing.</p>
<p>Social media was awash with videos purporting to show rival organised crime figures celebrating Mr Lawlor’s demise, while speculation was rampant that he had been in Belfast to collect a debt when he was killed.</p>
<p>PSNI Detective Superintendent Jason Murphy said: “I do not believe that Robbie was in the Ardoyne yesterday by accident. I believe he had some reason to be there and key lines of enquiry for me at this stage are to establish why he was there and what his connection to the address is.”</p>
<p>Four men, aged between 17 and 33, were arrested on suspicion of murder and are being questioned in the Serious Crime Suite in Musgrave police station, Belfast.</p>
<p>One has since been released.</p>
<p>Two properties, one in west Belfast and one in Crumlin, were also searched as part of the murder inquiry, the PSNI said.</p>
<p>Det Supt Murphy appealed for anyone in possession of recording footage that could assist the inquiry to make it available.</p>
<p>“Anyone who has CCTV, dashcam or mobile phone footage recorded in the area of Etna Drive and Kingston Court is also asked to make it available to my investigation team,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr Lawlor was said to be infamous among the underworld, shocking even the most hardened criminals with the level of violence he was prepared to use. He was a suspect in a number of murders, and had amassed more than 100 convictions.</p>
<p>A video uploaded to social media showing Mr Lawlor being accosted by a group of men shortly after his release from custody in December, was thought to be one of the catalysts in the escalation in violence between feuding gangs in Dublin and Drogheda, leading to the murder of Mr Mulready Woods.</p>
<p>Mr Lawlor left prison in December after a charge of assaulting his ex-partner was dropped, while a jury found him not guilty of assaulting her new partner. He was cleared of shooting the dog of his ex-partner’s mother. Gardaí told him in January that there was a serious threat to his life.
