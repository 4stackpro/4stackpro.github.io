<p>Former Sunderland goalkeeper Robbin Ruiter may not have had the best of luck on Wearside.</p>
<p>Mistakes and injuries dogged his first season at the Stadium of Light, after joining on a free transfer from FC Utrecht, while he had to play second fiddle to Scotland international Jon McLaughlin last term.</p>
<p>He returned to the Netherlands last summer, joining PSV on a free transfer, but his two seasons in the North East have clearly had a lasting effect on him and his young family.</p>
<p>So much so, that the 33-year-old took to Instagram today to post a photo of his young son watching the new series of Netflix documentary Sunderland &lsquo;Til I Die, with the caption: &ldquo;This club gets under your skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ruiter featured prominently in the first season of the series, with Sunderland&rsquo;s goalkeeping struggles under the microscope.</p>
<p>It also featured Ruiter and his family adapting to life in a new country and it is clear from his latest social media post that Sunderland still holds a strong place in their hearts.</p>
<p>However, he wasn&rsquo;t happy with the way the documentary portrayed his first season at the club when interviewed last year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last season I played a few mediocre matches, and two very bad ones, one was against Millwall, then I got a classic ball through the posts, a giant deflection. Well, those pictures were of course in the series,&rdquo; Ruiter told Voetbal International.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I had good matches in goal too, kept five clean sheets. I was on form until my injury, that would be a storyline in one of the episodes, but when I looked at the series, I did not notice it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked the makers what had happened and it turned out that they had to cut quite a bit because of the length, including in my scenes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found it&hellip;quite sour, but in retrospect, I understand that too - those crazy pictures of me fit in better with the complete picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has become a nice series, and despite everything, I have received a lot of positive reactions. On the street from supporters and on the Internet from people worldwide.&rdquo;

<h3 id="sunderland-til-i-die-is-tvs-best-show-about-failure">Sunderland ’Til I Die Is TV’s Best Show About Failure</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.newrepublic.com/c8b3e3a0ce624471fc1b82f7e133a0b69078b558.jpeg?w=1109&amp;h=577&amp;crop=faces&amp;fit=crop&amp;fm=jpg" alt="img">
In the movies, underdog sports teams always come from gritty, struggling, preferably postindustrial places. Major League wouldn’t work if it were set in Miami, instead of Cleveland. Rocky’s determination in Rocky is melded to Philadelphia: He draws his strength from the city itself, pumping his fists and jumping into the air after ascending the steps of the city’s art museum. Underdog sports teams are avatars for their downtrodden communities. They ultimately prevail by embodying the pluck and mettle of the people, taking down well-heeled, cosmopolitan competitors along the way (in Major League’s case, the Yankees). In the process, they elevate the cities they represent, which rise to reclaim the glory they lost a long time ago.</p>
<p>The first season of Sunderland ’Til I Die, Netflix’s documentary about Sunderland Association Football Club, the storied but recently relegated soccer team from England’s northeast, was intended to follow this trajectory. With an emphasis on the club’s passionate working-class supporters, a grandiloquent score, and frequent drone shots of the city and its massive stadium, it was meant to follow the team as it marched its way back to the heights (and riches) of the English Premier League. Along the way, the team would redeem the city, which has never quite recovered after the English economy moved on from cotton and coal in the last century.</p>
<p>But Sunderland’s 2018–2019 season did not work out as intended. Instead, everything that could possibly go wrong went wrong. The team’s defense was abysmal; their top scorer jumped ship during the transfer window in January. Veteran Darron Gibson started the season drunkenly bitching about the club in a pub and ended it being arrested for drunk driving. Practically everyone with us at the start of the year was gone by the end: two managers, an executive, an owner, and several players. Instead of reaching the promised land of the Premier League, Sunderland was unable even to keep its perch in the second division; it was relegated again, to England’s third division.</p>
<p>All of that chaos created something remarkable. The cameras captured nearly everything. There was no one to block access, a true feat in the hermetic world of top-flight sports, where millions of dollars are spent manicuring the images of teams and athletes. The result was an intricate portrait of the sports world’s most profound, but rarely explored, phenomenon: failure. Now back for a second season, Sunderland ’Til I Die once again hopes to capture a soccer team—and a people—on the ascent. Instead, it provides a different, but just as compelling, look at catastrophe.

Sunderland were quoted an asking price of £10million for Doncaster Rovers striker John Marquis when they looked to sign the striker last January - according to owner Stewart Donald.</p>
<p>Marquis, now of Portsmouth, was one of a host of players considered by the Black Cats as they looked to replace top scorer Josh Maja after his move to Bordeaux.</p>
<p>But Sunderland’s move for Marquis hit a stumbling block when they were quoted an asking price of £10million for the striker.
