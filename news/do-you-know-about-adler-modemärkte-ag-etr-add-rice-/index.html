Today we&rsquo;ll look at Adler Modemärkte AG (ETR:ADD) and reflect on its potential as an investment. Specifically, we&rsquo;ll consider its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), since that will give us an insight into how efficiently the business can generate profits from the capital it requires.</p>
<p>First, we&rsquo;ll go over how we calculate ROCE. Second, we&rsquo;ll look at its ROCE compared to similar companies. Last but not least, we&rsquo;ll look at what impact its current liabilities have on its ROCE.</p>
<p>Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)</p>
<p>ROCE is a measure of a company&rsquo;s yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. Overall, it is a valuable metric that has its flaws. Renowned investment researcher Michael Mauboussin has suggested that a high ROCE can indicate that &lsquo;one dollar invested in the company generates value of more than one dollar&rsquo;.</p>
<p>How Do You Calculate Return On Capital Employed?</p>
<p>The formula for calculating the return on capital employed is:</p>
<p>Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)</p>
<p>Or for Adler Modemärkte:</p>
<p>0.091 = €27m ÷ (€409m - €108m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2019.)</p>
<p>Therefore, Adler Modemärkte has an ROCE of 9.1%.</p>
<p>See our latest analysis for Adler Modemärkte</p>
<p>Does Adler Modemärkte Have A Good ROCE?</p>
<p>One way to assess ROCE is to compare similar companies. Using our data, Adler Modemärkte&rsquo;s ROCE appears to be around the 7.8% average of the Specialty Retail industry. Independently of how Adler Modemärkte compares to its industry, its ROCE in absolute terms appears decent, and the company may be worthy of closer investigation.</p>
<p>We can see that, Adler Modemärkte currently has an ROCE of 9.1% compared to its ROCE 3 years ago, which was 2.8%. This makes us think about whether the company has been reinvesting shrewdly.

<p>When considering ROCE, bear in mind that it reflects the past and does not necessarily predict the future. ROCE can be deceptive for cyclical businesses, as returns can look incredible in boom times, and terribly low in downturns. ROCE is, after all, simply a snap shot of a single year. What happens in the future is pretty important for investors, so we have prepared a free report on analyst forecasts for Adler Modemärkte.</p>
<p>Do Adler Modemärkte&rsquo;s Current Liabilities Skew Its ROCE?</p>
<p>Short term (or current) liabilities, are things like supplier invoices, overdrafts, or tax bills that need to be paid within 12 months. Due to the way ROCE is calculated, a high level of current liabilities makes a company look as though it has less capital employed, and thus can (sometimes unfairly) boost the ROCE. To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.</p>
<p>Adler Modemärkte has total assets of €409m and current liabilities of €108m. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 26% of its total assets. A fairly low level of current liabilities is not influencing the ROCE too much.</p>
<p>Our Take On Adler Modemärkte&rsquo;s ROCE</p>
<p>Overall, Adler Modemärkte has a decent ROCE and could be worthy of further research. Adler Modemärkte looks strong on this analysis, but there are plenty of other companies that could be a good opportunity . Here is a free list of companies growing earnings rapidly.</p>

<h3 id="mayor-adler-warns-hospitalizations-could-increase-if-construction-workers-dont-practice-social-distancing">Mayor Adler warns hospitalizations could increase if construction workers don&rsquo;t practice social distancing</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.kvue.com/assets/KVUE/images/0988b5a4-86c0-4bb2-8755-21f7eb3ee42a/0988b5a4-86c0-4bb2-8755-21f7eb3ee42a_1140x641.jpg" alt="img">
AUSTIN, Texas — Gov. Greg Abbott is still allowing construction to happen across Texas during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>But Austin Mayor Steve Adler said if construction workers don&rsquo;t follow social distancing practices and personal hygiene recommendations, thousands of additional patients could be hospitalized for COVID-19.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t mitigate well, if workers are passing the virus between them, then the total hospitalizations in our city could be three times higher than it would be without construction activity,&rdquo; Adler said in a Facebook Live Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Got a Minute? &ndash;April 7, 2020 Tonight, I want to talk about construction around town during the COVID-19 crisis. Posted by Austin Mayor Steve Adler on Tuesday, April 7, 2020</p>
<p>RELATED COVERAGE:</p>
<p>All construction now allowed in Austin after brief halts due to coronavirus concerns</p>
<p>The state of construction sites in Austin following &lsquo;Stay Home, Work Safe&rsquo; order</p>
<p>Adler cited a report by University of Texas at Austin researchers. The report stated that there are an estimated 50,000 construction workers in the Austin metropolitan area.</p>
<p>In the last sentence of the &ldquo;overview&rdquo; section of the report, it reads, &ldquo;Under a scenario of effective social distancing and a large construction workforce, the hospitalization risk is expected to be two to three times higher for construction workers than non-construction workers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mayor Adler presented some of the charts from the report at a press conference on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, if there&rsquo;s a low risk, if construction sites are doing all the mitigation that they can reasonably do, you can see that the number of hospitalizations is about the same even with construction as they would be if we didn&rsquo;t have construction,&rdquo; Adler said. &ldquo;And the difference here between those two bars is only how much construction site mitigation takes place, how well we&rsquo;re protecting those workers. And by protecting those workers, we protect the entire community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report also gives multiple scenarios. You can view the report in full below:</p>
<p>Adler also said Wednesday that he plans to meet with representatives in the construction industry.</p>
<p>Local health authorities have sent out recommendations for construction sites to keep their workplaces clean. But Adler said he could move to turn those recommendations into requirements.</p>
<p>The Home Builders Association of Greater Austin told KVUE in a statement on Wednesday:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The construction industry is among the most safety-conscious industries in the world. On a daily basis, even before COVID-19, the construction industry operates within strict federal, state and local safety rules and regulations (e.g., OSHA, permits, inspections).</p>
<p>There are important reasons the Department of Homeland Security determined that construction is an essential business, and they did not do so lightly. The fact that some folks don’t like that determination does not change the facts.</p>
<p>To even suggest that construction workers are more likely to become sick than your average beauty supply store worker, music producer or car wash owner, (all deemed by the City of Austin as “essential business”) is not supported by fact or science. The UT model focuses on a select 4% of the workforce that already adheres to advanced safety protocols, and includes a broad range of incorrect assumptions. Within just the first few paragraphs, the flawed assumptions are evident, beginning with the assertion that construction workers can easily migrate from one worksite to another. To use as a foundational basis that workers can unilaterally and proactively swarm to other worksites is irrational and defies logic.</p>
<p>The governor, County and City have issued clear safety protocols that limit the number of workers on a jobsite. Therefore, to support a model that contact between construction workers would “double” is wild speculation with no basis in reality. And even if you rely on the model, with the safety protocols already in place (both pre- and post-COVID-19), the risk of increased exposure should be less than for your pizza delivery.</p>
<p>There will always be bad actors. All you have to do is walk outside your door to see a wide range of people not obeying the law, but in America we punish the offenders, not everyone for the actions of a few. We received a complaint and photo of workers not abiding by the social distancing protocols, and ironically, it was a photo of City of Austin workers.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on demonizing one industry, especially one that has been determined to be an essential business, not just locally, but also statewide and nationally, we should all be working together to find the best solutions to move our City forward. The HBA has been regularly providing information about the latest in safety protocols, and will continue to do so. We support the construction industry mantra of Safety First. We will continue to work with elected officials to educate them on effective safety measures.&rdquo;</p>
