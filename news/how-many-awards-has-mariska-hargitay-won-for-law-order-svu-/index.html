Mariska Hargitay is well known for starring as Olivia Benson in Law &amp; Order: SVU — the hit primetime show that defies the laws of television when it comes to longevity. The show has been on the air for over two decades and boasts one of the most devout fan followings in existence — right up there with the NCIS devotees.</p>

<p>As for the character at the center of the show, Benson remains the woman who fans flock to. So, just how many times has Hargitay been awarded for the role? How much recognition has she gained for her run as Olivia Benson…so far? Let’s dive into Hargitay’s award wins for Law &amp; Order: SVU.</p>
<p>Mariska Hargitay won the Golden Globe in 2005 for her portrayal of Olivia Benson in ‘SVU’</p>
<p>Mariska Hargitay won the Golden Globe in 2005, yet she was nominated again four years later in the same category — Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series, Drama. In 2005, Mariska Hargitay was up against Edie Falco for The Sopranos, Christine Lahti for Jack &amp; Bobby, Jennifer Garner for Alias, and Joely Richardson for Nip/Tuck. Thus, she beat out some fierce competition. The second time she was nominated, she did not go home with the award.</p>
<p>In 2009, the Golden Globe went to Anna Paquin for True Blood; Paquin beat out Hargitay, Sally Field for Brothers &amp; Sisters, January Jones for Mad Men, and Kyra Sedgwick for The Closer. While Hargitay lost her second shot at the Globes, she made up for it with many Primetime Emmy nominations.</p>
<p>Mariska Hargitay won the Primetime Emmy in 2006, but she was nominated many times over</p>
<p>In 2006, Mariska Hargitay won the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama for Law &amp; Order: SVU. Though the show premiered in 1999, she wouldn’t go on to receive her first nomination for the part until 2004. She was then nominated every year after her first nomination in the same category until 2011. Thus, Hargitay boasts 8 Primetime Emmy nominations for SVU, and she won once.</p>
<p>Hargitay won the Gracie Allen Award 4 times for ‘SVU,’but what does the award recognize?</p>
<p>Hargitay can claim the rights to four Gracie Allen Awards for her performance in SVU: she won for Oustanding Female Actor in a Leading Role, Drama in 2004, 2009, 2014, and 2017!</p>
<p>The Gracie Allen Awards specifically recognize exemplary programming created by women, for women, and about women in all facets of media and entertainment. The awards are named after radio and television star Gracie Allen, who was a successful comedian, entertainer, entrepreneur, and activist who lived from 1895 until 1964.</p>
<p>Mariska Hargitay was nominated for the Gold Derby Award twice for ‘Law &amp; Order: SVU’</p>
<p>Though Mariska Hargitay was nominated for the Gold Derby twice for her performance as Olivia Benson, she never took home the coveted prize. Though Gold Derby originated as an entertainment award prediction website, the company soon began dishing out their own awards (three years following its founding). Though people know of the Gold Derby, it means a bit more to take home the Globe and the Emmy.

<p><img src="https://www.gossipcop.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Untitled-design-2020-04-23T140344.061.jpg" alt="img">

<p>Mariska Hargitay showed off a photo of her famous mom, Jayne Mansfield, on Instagram. It’s clear from the picture that the apple didn’t fall far from the tree when it came to the mother-daughter duo’s good looks. Though Hargitay tragically lost her mother at a very young age, it’s moments like this that help her feel connected to the Hollywood bombshell.</p>
<p>The Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit star shared a family photo of Mansfield to her Instagram page days ago. In the shot, Mansfield could be seen crouching by a few cats relaxing on a rug. The Girl Can’t Help It star was showing off her famous figure in a swimsuit, with her trademark blond locks swept back in a chic looking bun.</p>
<p>Hargitay lost her mother when she was only 3 years old. The “Face That Launched A Thousand Ships” died in a car accident in 1967. The 19-year-old driver, Ronald B. Harrison, and Mansfield’s lawyer and boyfriend, Samuel S. Brody, also lost their lives in the crash. Hargitay was in the car that day with her two older brothers, 8-year-old Mickey Jr. and 6-year-old Zoltan, who also survived the crash. The actress behind Olivia Benson revealed that she has no memory of the crash that took her mother’s life. Regardless, it’s still left a scar that Hargitay deals with to this day.</p>
<p>“The way I’ve lived with loss is to lean into it,” Mariska Hargitay told People in a 2018 interview. “As the saying goes, the only way out is through. In my life, certainly I’ve tried to avoid pain, loss, feeling things. But I’ve learned instead to real­ly lean into it, because sooner or later you have to pay the piper.” One of the ways the actress honors her mother’s memory is by remembering the details that made Jayne Mansfield such a special woman.</p>
<p>“My mother was this amazing, beautiful, glamor­ous sex symbol — but people didn’t know that she played the violin and had a 160 IQ and had five kids and loved dogs,” Hargitay said. “She was just so ahead of her time. She was an inspiration, she had this appetite for life, and I think I share that with her.”</p>
<p>That’s not the only thing Hargitay had in common with her gorgeous mother. There’s definitely a physical resemblance as well. “Someone once said about [remembering] my mother: ‘All you have to do is look in the mirror,’ ” she added. “She’s with me still.”</p>
<p>Mariska Hargitay has become a star in her own right, which often puts her in the crosshairs for unscrupulous tabloids. For instance, the National Enquirer claimed a year ago that Hargitay was leaving Law &amp; Order: SVU to pursue a film career. Gossip Cop found that claim to be untrue. We reached out to Hargitay’s rep, who confirmed our hunch that this story was full of baloney.

<h3 id="heres-how-much-mariska-hargitay-makes-from-law--order-svu">Here&rsquo;s how much Mariska Hargitay makes from Law &amp; Order: SVU</h3>
<p><img src="https://img3.looper.com/img/gallery/heres-how-much-mariska-hargitay-makes-from-law-order-svu/intro-1586269341.jpg" alt="img">
As of her 2017-18 contract that has been made public, Mariska Hargitay takes home an astounding $13 million a year for her time in front of the cameras. That&rsquo;s over half a million per episode, making her one of the highest-earning women in television (especially for a broadcast network, which generally cannot pay the kinds of seven-figure salaries subscription networks like HBO or Netflix can). It&rsquo;s also a bit of a bump up from her last reported salary, which had been around $450,000 per episode (via Yahoo! Finance). Ever since her former co-star Christopher Meloni left Law &amp; Order: SVU in 2011, Hargitay has had to fill in as the major star of the series, and has seen a general increase in her salary because of it over the past decade.</p>
<p>What does she do with it? She does have three children and lives in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, so that lifestyle comes with a hefty price tag of its own. But in addition to that, she has put that money to work for several years, with charitable contributions to sexual assault survivor outreach programs — that is, until she decided to go whole-hog and start a whole non-profit outreach charity of her own. Her time on SVU has made her the face most Americans recognize in relation to advocacy for sexual assault, and she has taken that responsibility very seriously, right down to putting her salary back into awareness and fundraising.
