Tributes have been paid to a much-loved survivor of the Hillsborough disaster who has died from coronavirus.</p>
<p>Dave Roland was famously pictured sitting on the Leppings Lane terrace at the Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield with his head in his hands following the horrific loss of life in 1989.</p>
<p>The harrowing scene followed his brave efforts to help a boy caught alongside him in the crush that claimed the lives of 96 innocent men, women and children.</p>
<p>The 65-year-old died last week, days before the 31st anniversary of the tragedy.</p>
<p>His family paid a touching tribute to him on Friday, describing him as a &lsquo;proud Scouser&rsquo; who gave joy to everyone around him.</p>
<p>Tributes have been paid to much-loved Hillsborough survivor Dave Roland, who has died from coronavirus. He was pictured sitting on the Leppings Lane terrace at the Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield with his head in his hands following the horrific loss of life in 1989</p>
<p>Mr Roland, 65, died last week, days before the 31st anniversary of the tragedy</p>
<p>His daughter, Michelle Hopwood, said: &lsquo;He was youthful, unique, kind-hearted and fun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was the ultimate Peter Pan which helped form a joyful bond with his grandchildren, always turning up in daft hats and glasses, playing board games or being competitive telling them he could do anything because he was &ldquo;the best&rdquo; at whatever the topic of conversation was.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He beamed with pride when he attended events that his grandchildren were participating in and loved to take photographs to show them off.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was known for being kind and generous to a fault.</p>
<p>After escaping the Leppings Lane crush Mr Roland and friend John Owen attempted to help victim Henry Rogers (pictured) after finding him battling for life on the Hillsborough pitch. Sadly, they were unable to save the 17-year-old</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have received so many messages from people who have explained the impact dad had on their lives, from taking so many to their first Liverpool game standing them on a box in the Kop, to pouring out words of advice which some men are now saying changed their lives, even keeping them out of prison.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Carl [Michelle&rsquo;s brother] says he is the dad he is to his daughter, because of the type of dad my dad was to us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Roland, who lived in Woolton, in south-east Liverpool, was 34 when he travelled to Sheffield to watch the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.</p>
<p>After escaping the Leppings Lane crush he and friend John Owen attempted to help victim Henry Rogers after finding him battling for life on the Hillsborough pitch.</p>
<p>Sadly, they were unable to save the 17-year-old.</p>
<p>Fresh inquests into the tragedy concluded in 2016 after two years of hearings and more than 1,000 witnesses. They jury concluded that the victims were unlawfully killed.</p>
<p>Giving evidence at the inquests Mr Roland said: &lsquo;I always remember the blazing sunshine shining down on him, so John had him in his arms and I had hold of his hand&hellip; He just went lifeless and we got pulled away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After seeing a picture of Henry in the Liverpool Echo, Mr Roland and Mr Owen traced his parents and visited them.</p>
<p>He said: &lsquo;The exact words I used, because I can remember it to this day: &ldquo;We have come to explain to you that Henry wasn&rsquo;t on his own when he died, and we thought it would be comfort for you to know, rather than not know&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Both brave survivors attended Henry&rsquo;s funeral.</p>
<p>Mr Roland (pictured), who lived in Woolton, in south-east Liverpool, was 34 when he travelled to Sheffield to watch the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest</p>
<p>Ms Hopwood said the tragedy had a significant impact on her father, who separated from wife Christine two years after the disaster, although the pair remained friends up to her death last year.</p>
<p>She told the Liverpool Echo: &lsquo;He slowly stopped attending football matches after Hillsborough, we knew it was simply too painful for him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It took a long time for him to fully talk about what he had experienced. When he did finally relay the events he revealed the horrors of being pinned against the crush barrier, seeing the faces of fear around him and trying desperately to help a young boy nearby.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dad did take great comfort from attending the Hillsborough Inquiry to give evidence in the case of Henry Rogers, a sort of closure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Giving evidence didn&rsquo;t come easy to him and going to the courthouse in support of the truth and for the families involved was so important to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget how he shook pretty much the whole car journey there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But as soon as we arrived he stepped out knowing the importance of his statement.</p>
<p>His family paid a touching tribute to him on Friday, describing him as a &lsquo;proud Scouser&rsquo; who gave joy to everyone around him. He and friend John Owen attempted to help victim Henry Rogers after finding him battling for life on the Hillsborough pitch</p>
<p>&lsquo;This was just who he was, putting others first even at the cost of causing himself upset.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Roland, who was born in Toxteth, often denied the harrowing image of the survivor sitting alone with his head in his hands on the afternoon of April 15, 1989, was him.</p>
<p>His family believe it may have brought up too many painful memories from the day.</p>
<p>When he moved home and found the jacket he was pictured wearing, Ms Hopwood said it opened up old wounds.</p>
<p>Yet, while the disaster changed his life, she said it did not define it.</p>
<p>Despite the impact it had, his love of music, football, his city and his family helped him find fun and joy in the world - and bring it to those who met him.</p>
<p>She said: &lsquo;His love of music and football was prevalent in every conversation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He would never miss a match, no matter what other occasions were on, always to be found at his favourite table in John Brodie&rsquo;s [pub in the Mossley Hill area of Liverpool].</p>
<p>&lsquo;His partner Ann shared his love of football.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was always entertaining seeing him revert to being like a child whenever he saw one of the team players - once stopping a family meal because he saw Kenny Dalglish in the same restaurant.</p>
<p>At the inquest into the disaster, jurors ruled that the victims were unlawfully killed</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was frustrated by the impact that the restrictions, as a result of coronavirus, had on football games and the pending premier league fixtures and he was so excited at the prospect of seeing Liverpool lift another trophy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Roland worked as a project manager for Doorset Technology Ltd in Speke and was planning to retire at the end of this year.</p>
<p>Fit and healthy when the pandemic broke, Ms Hopwood believes he had a false sense of &lsquo;invincibility&rsquo; - though he wore a mask and gloves as advice hardened.</p>
<p>Believing he caught the condition before society was placed on lockdown, she said he displayed no symptoms beyond tiredness until he collapsed and was taken into the Royal Liverpool University Hospital.</p>
<p>There, his situation deteriorated until his death on April 6.</p>
<p>This came despite what Ms Hopwood described as incredible and compassionate care from the NHS staff who fought to save him.</p>
<p>With Mr Roland a huge fan of David Bowie, this even extended to nurses playing his favourite songs to him on their phones while he received treatment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I could&rsquo;ve taken a picture of what the ICU staff are facing on a daily basis I fully believe it would have been enough to shock everyone to stay home,&rsquo; she added.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The images in the news do not convey the gravity of the situation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was shocked at how young the patients in ICU were, fully expecting it to be full of elderly patients, yet there is a huge sense of professionalism and calm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure the staff are exhausted and doing the best they can but what I witnessed was nothing short of care executed with pride, professionalism, calmness and compassion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was so touching to see how emotional the staff got when dad finally slipped away, we felt that the staff had been his family that week.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ms Hopwood said her father&rsquo;s last words to her were &lsquo;I Love You&rsquo; and the last message he sent was a text to say a hug &lsquo;would be wonderful&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Since his death, his family has been overwhelmed by the tributes that have poured in for him.</p>
<p>Mr Roland, who lived in Woolton, in south-east Liverpool, was 34 when he travelled to Sheffield to watch the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest</p>
<p>As well as those who knew and loved him getting in touch and sharing fond memories, the poignant image of Mr Roland at Hillsborough has been shared by thousands online.</p>
<p>While most of those who shared it did not know him, their words of support have touched his family and friends.</p>
<p>Reflecting on his life, and the impact of Hillsborough on it, Michelle concluded: &lsquo;People pass comments on how tragic his life was as a result of the disaster, which it was, however dad went on to live a full life and always had a smile on his face, always full of witty one-liners, borderline inappropriate jokes and bad dad jokes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He loved to share a daily meme on Facebook - something so many of us are missing now.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dad was always seeking something after Hillsborough which I believe he only found at the end of his life - peace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But he simply made people feel good about themselves when they were in his company, whether through what he did for them or what he said to them and in this difficult time we hope everyone can do the same to those around them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That should be his legacy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Timeline of a tragedy: How the Hillsborough disaster unfolded Beginning of the day: South Yorkshire Police asked both clubs to ensure their fans arrived between 10.30am and 2pm for the game. 2pm: The Leppings Lane turnstiles began operating smoothly, but after 2.15pm the volume of fans increased. 2.30pm: The road was closed. Fans were asked over the PA system to move forward and spread out in the space. Officers considered delayed the kick-off but did not. 2.40pm: Large crowds had built up outside the turnstiles. 2.44pm: Fans were asked to stop pushing, though crowding was already bad and the turnstiles were struggling to cope. 2.47pm to 2.57pm: Some external gates were opened to relived pressure on the turnstiles - which caused fans to rush forward and crowd the pens even more. Pressure built up, and narrow gates in two of the pens were opened. Officers thought fans were deliberately invading the pitch. 3pm: Kick-off. By this time the crush at the front of the pens was intolerable. Fans scramble into the top tier of the Leppings Lane end terrace to escape the crush 3.04pm: Liverpool player Peter Beardsley struck the crossbar of the Nottingham goal, causing fans to rush forward again. The huge pressure caused one of the crush barriers to break, making the situation even more dire for those pressed against it. 3.05pm: Ambulance staff began investigation. 3.05pm to 3.06pm: Police Superintendent Roger Greenwood decided the match had to be stopped and ran onto the pitch. 3.06pm to 3.08pm: Police called for a fleet of ambulances. 3.07pm to 3.10pm: South Yorkshire Police called for all available resources to come to the stadium. 3.08pm: Ambulance officers, under Mr Higgins, returned to the Leppings Lane end to treat a fracture victim. There were more spectators on the pitch. Some were distressed, some were angry. 3.13pm: An ambulance from St John Ambulance, the volunteer force, was driven around the perimeter of the pitch at the north-east corner. It was mentioned that there may have been fatalities. 3.15pm: The secretary of Sheffield Wednesday and the chief executive of the Football Association, Graham Kelly, went to the police control box to ask for information. Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield said there were fatalities and the game was likely to be called off. He also said that a gate had been forced, that there had been an in-rush of Liverpool supporters. This later transpired to not be correct. 3.29pm: By this time fire engines and more ambulances had arrived. One ambulance was driven onto the pitch. 3.56pm: Kenny Dalglish, the Liverpool manager, broadcast a message to all fans. He asked them to remain calm. The police had asked him to do so. Liverpool and Nottingham Forest managers Kenny Dalglish and Brian Clough on the day 4.10pm: The match was formally abandoned and many fans returned home. 4.30pm: By this time, some 88 people had been taken by ambulance to the Northern General Hospital and some 71 to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield by 42 ambulances. 5pm: The South Yorkshire coroner, Dr Stefan Popper, gave instructions for the bodies to be kept in the gymnasium until they had been photographed and identified. By the end of the evening 82 people had been declared dead at Hillsborough. 12 more were declared dead in hospital. Another person, Lee Nicol, survived for two days on a life support machine before he, too, died. The 96th victim of the Hillsborough disaster was Tony Bland. He survived until 1993, but with severe brain damage.</p>
<p>Who were the victims of the Hillsborough disaster?</p>
<p>These are the 96 victims who lost their lives as a result of the Hillsborough tragedy on April 15 1989:</p>
<p>Adam Edward Spearritt, 14. A schoolboy from Cheshire, Adam was taken to the game by his father Edward and two friends.</p>
<p>Alan Johnston, 29. A trainee accountant from Liverpool. Mr Johnston had travelled to Sheffield in a hired minibus with friends and was separated from them at the Leppings Lane turnstile due to the crowd.</p>

A landmark legal ruling allowed his family to stop life-support treatment, making him Hillsborough&rsquo;s 96th and final victim. His death was not included in the David Duckenfield trial because laws at the time meant he died too late to be covered by the indictment.</p>

<h3 id="hillsborough-mp-to-table-disaster-advocate-bill-in-parliament">Hillsborough: MP to table &lsquo;disaster advocate&rsquo; bill in Parliament</h3>

<p>Plans to create a dedicated independent advisor to work on behalf of families bereaved in major disasters are to be put forward by an MP.</p>
<p>Maria Eagle, who campaigned with the Hillsborough families for more than 30 years, is due to introduce the Public Advocate Bill in Parliament next week.</p>
<p>It would create a top-level advisor to support families and liaise with officials such as coroners and lawyers.</p>
<p>Ms Eagle said the Hillsborough families had &ldquo;been through hell&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The former justice minister worked with some of the families, who lost relatives in the 1989 football stadium disaster, as part of her work as a solicitor in Liverpool and later as a Labour MP in the city.</p>
<p>Image copyright Hillsborough Inquests Image caption Ninety-six fans died as a result of a crush at Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield</p>
<p>She said such disasters can leave families &ldquo;without a voice&rdquo; and &ldquo;feeling like they are themselves on trial&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The public advocate would work with staff to represent the interests of the bereaved, and would have full access to confidential documents, without needing to apply to the police or Home Office, Ms Eagle said.</p>
<p>If enacted, the MP said the bill would establish a &ldquo;lasting legacy&rdquo; for the Hillsborough families.</p>
<p>While it remains unclear how Parliament will sit next week as the coronavirus lockdown continues, the bill is due to have its first reading on 22 April after Prime Minister&rsquo;s Questions.</p>
<p>It was previously introduced in 2015 and again in July 2019, but did not progress under past governments.</p>
<p>The bill has been supported by the Hillsborough families and those affected by other atrocities including the 1988 Lockerbie plane bombing.</p>
<p>Liverpool FC and the Hillsborough families earlier held a minute&rsquo;s silence to mark the 31st anniversary of the disaster.</p>
<p>A full and final memorial service had been planned but was postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>Ms Eagle said: &ldquo;The planned final memorial service at Anfield had to be postponed but that day provided yet another sombre time to reflect about the loss the Hillsborough families have endured and the horrific three decades long battle they have had to wage.&rdquo;
