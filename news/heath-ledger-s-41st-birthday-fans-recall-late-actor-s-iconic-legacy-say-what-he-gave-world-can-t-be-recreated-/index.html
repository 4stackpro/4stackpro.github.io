An outpouring of love from the fans celebrates what would have been Heath Ledger&rsquo;s 41st birthday. Fans of the late actor have been posting images from his most famous movies, including &lsquo;10 Things I Hate About You,&rsquo; &lsquo;A Knight&rsquo;s Tale,&rsquo; &lsquo;Brokeback Mountain,&rsquo; and, of course, one of his most memorable performances as the Joker in &lsquo;The Dark Knight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As clichéd as it may sound, you sir, gave the world something that cannot be recreated, reimagined or even re-enacted. You took the madness with you. Thank you for the joker. From applying your make up to shooting scenes, you owned joker,&rdquo; writes on fan, on Twitter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ever think of how many great movies could have been greater if Heath Ledger had lived to be in them?&rdquo; writes another.</p>
<p>The Australian actor started his career young, with a role in a stage production of &lsquo;Peter Pan&rsquo; at the early age of 10. He moved to the United States in 1998 to more seriously pursue his acting career, landing a role in the now-iconic &lsquo;10 Things I Hate About You.&rsquo; He enjoyed a fulfilling career as a photographer, actor, and music video director, that earned him several awards. Most notably, his role as Ennis Del Mar in &lsquo;Brokeback Mountain&rsquo; earned him the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor and the Best International Actor Award from the Australian Film Institute.</p>
<p>He received a great number of posthumous awards for his role as the Joker in &lsquo;The Dark Knight,&rsquo; including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, the 2009 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture, and the 2009 BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor.</p>
<p>Heath Ledger was found unconscious in his bed on January 22, 2008, by his housekeeper, and was soon after pronounced dead by the paramedics. His death was ruled an accidental overdose of a number of drugs, mixed in with a heavy amount of alcohol. In the days leading up to his death, it had been reported that Ledger had been struggling with severe drug abuse, which is what ultimately led to his tragic passing.</p>
<p>At the time of his death, filming for &lsquo;The Dark Knight&rsquo; had been completed, though he was halfway through shooting &lsquo;The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus&rsquo; - various other Hollywood actors filled in for his role in the movie during sequences set in a more dreamlike world.</p>
<p>A documentary film depicting his life, entitled &lsquo;I Am Heath Ledger&rsquo; was released on May 3, 2017, which included footage from interviews and archival footage of the late actor.</p>
<p>In the wake of his death, one quote of his, in particular, has been making the rounds from an interview in &lsquo;The Daily Telegraph,&rsquo; &lsquo;Squaring the Ledger&rsquo; in 2007: &ldquo;When I die, my money&rsquo;s not gonna come with me. My movies will live on – for people to judge what I was as a person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over a decade after his death, his movies do indeed live on, and his performances have not been forgotten.</p>

<h3 id="heath-ledgers-heartbreaking-autopsy-and-how-sisters-final-plea-almost-saved-him">Heath Ledger&rsquo;s heartbreaking autopsy and how sister&rsquo;s final plea almost saved him</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article21721430.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Toronto-International-Film-Festival-Portrait-Session-For-Candy.jpg" alt="img">
Heath Ledger had been struggling to sleep.</p>
<p>Despite being at the pinnacle of his career, the Australia actor&rsquo;s nights were filled with the waking torment of insomnia.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d spent months immersing himself into the role of The Joker for Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s Dark Night and had recently moved into a Manhattan rental apartment after splitting from girlfriend Michelle Williams.</p>
<p>Desperate to sleep and suffering from &lsquo;walking pneumonia&rsquo;, his friend and sometimes housemate Gerry Grennell told how a tortured Heath would fitfully pace the floors.</p>
<p>(Image: PA)</p>
<p>He told People magazine: &ldquo;I would hear him wandering around the apartment and I’d get up and say, ‘Come on, man, get back to bed, you have to work tomorrow.’ He said, ‘I can’t sleep, man.’&rdquo;</p>
<p>Friends were worried about Heath&rsquo;s increasing reliance on prescription drugs. And just the night before his death on January 22, 2008, his sister Kate had begged her brother to cut some of his medications out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can’t mix drugs that you don’t know anything about,&rdquo; their father Kim recalled her saying.</p>
<p>(Image: REUTERS)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I’ll be fine,&rdquo; replied Heath. But tragically, if he had listened to his sibling the events that followed might never have happened.</p>
<p>When his housekeeper arrived the next day at 12:30pm, she found Heath lying in bed face down with his sheets pulled around his shoulders.</p>
<p>She told The Associated Press she popped in to change a light bulb before slipping back out after hearing him snoring.</p>
<p>At 3pm his massage therapist Diana Wolozin arrived but found she could get no answer from his bedroom door or his mobile phone.</p>
<p>(Image: AFP/Getty Images)</p>
<p>She decided to set up her table in his bedroom, but upon trying to wake him was horrified to discover his body was cold and unresponsive.</p>
<p>In a fit of panic she is said to have called Heath&rsquo;s good friend, actress Mary-Kate Olsen, before continuing her efforts to wake the star.</p>
<p>Realising he was dead, Diana called 911 where an operator reportedly guided her through CPR until the paramedics arrived minutes later.</p>
<p>According to CNN, medical technicians administered CPR and used a cardiac defibrillator before the Brokeback Mountain star was pronounced dead at 3:36pm.</p>

<p>Rumours immediately flew about what had caused his mysterious and sudden death, with many speculating that the darkness of The Joker and his split from Michelle had plunged him into a state of depression.</p>
<p>However, an autopsy the New York coroner found that he had died of &lsquo;acute intoxication&rsquo; after ingesting a cocktail of prescription medication. His death was ruled an accident.</p>
<p>Anti-anxiety drugs Valium and Xanax, the painkiller OxyContin, cough suppressant hydrocodone and sleep aids Restoril and Unisom were all found in his system among others.</p>
<p>And in 2017, forensic pathologist Dr Jason Payne-James said that it was the addition of OxyContin and hydrocodone that proved fatal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It just put his whole system to sleep I guess,” Kim told news.com.au of the coroner&rsquo;s findings, sharing his heartache over Heath&rsquo;s reluctance to heed Kate&rsquo;s warning.</p>
<p>(Image: FilmMagic)</p>
<p>He continued: &ldquo;It was a one-off thing. That’s what killed us, because he was warned by his sister the night before: ‘You shouldn’t mix what you’re taking for pneumonia with your Ambien.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a young guy that traveled all the time for work. Even as a two year old, he hardly ever slept. He was trying to work and travel and do everything in a short space of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He continued, &ldquo;Heath mixed a couple of drugs together with sleeping tablets and he’s gone forever.&rdquo;
