It’s 1982 all over again, as Jane Fonda brought back her iconic workout to join TikTok. For 82, she’s still got all those killer exercise moves.</p>
<p>In the early 1980’s, Jane Fonda developed a side-gig from Academy Award-winning actress to aerobics queen. She even developed the Jane Fonda Workout method, and now she’s bringing it back in 2020 all in the name of drawing attention to the climate crisis. The 82-year-old film icon joined TikTok on April 2 and wowed the world with her workout moves. Since everyone is stuck at home in self-quarantine because of the coronavirus, Jane felt the world needed to exercise along with her to save the planet.</p>
<p>Jane’s body looks amazing, as she’s wearing a tight, long-sleeved red workout top and blue workout pants The exercise guru inside Jane clearly never left her, because she totally takes command in the TikTok video. She’s seen on her side laying on a blue yoga mat inside a naturally lit room of her home, with french doors behind her, and an exquisite rug in front of her.</p>
<p>“Hello TikTok. My name is Jane Fonda and I’m going to bring back the Jane Fonda Workout during this home sequestration, so come on and do it with me. Lift up and down, lift up and down,” as she did perfectly executed leg lifts. Jane’s 1982 workout tape was revolutionary in its time, getting people to exercise along at home with her via a VCR cassette that sold 17 million copies.</p>
<p>Jane says she’s bringing back her workout sessions every Friday for the sake of planet Earth. She’s been arrested during numerous “fire drill Friday” protests bringing attention to climate change and this is her latest way to focus on the issue. In her caption Jane wrote, “Hello Tik Tok! I’m bringing back the Jane Fonda Workout to fight the climate crisis. Join #firedrillfriday 4/3 @ 11AMPT #happyathome #indoorworkout”</p>
<p>The video then cut to Jane standing in a gorgeous orange jacket with her light grey hair perfectly coiffed. She then said there’s already too many TV and online workouts available and that, “What I really want you to do is work out with me for the planet,” and begged people to pay attention to the climate crisis. So it sounds like her Apr. 3 class is going to be a one-off, but it should be spectacular!

<p>Last Labor Day weekend, Jane Fonda was sitting around in Big Sur with pals Rosanna Arquette and Catherine Keener feeling “very depressed that I wasn’t doing enough about the climate crisis.” She’d already stopped using single-use plastics, started driving an electric car, and cut back on meat, but she still yearned to make a bigger impact.</p>
<p>“When you’re famous, you have this incredible potential platform, but how do you use it?” Fonda says. And then she realized, “I have to put myself on the line.” So she called up Annie Leonard, the executive director of Greenpeace USA, and told her she was going to camp out in front of the White House. “She said, ‘Well, that’s great that you’re willing to do that, but it’s illegal,’ ” says Fonda, laughing over a hummus platter one February weekend afternoon at The Wing in Los Angeles, where she’s filming the seventh and final season of Netflix’s Grace and Frankie. Fonda was undeterred, but “didn’t want to be some aging movie star moving to DC” and butting in on existing activists, so she reached out to environmental organizations and students who, inspired by Greta Thunberg, had been protesting on Fridays, wondering where the adults were. Someone told her to “see if the students will welcome you, and if they do, go every Friday,” Fonda says. “So right away, I went to DC.”</p>
<p>She was greeted with open arms, and for 14 weeks beginning in October, Fonda and a diverse coalition of groups staged weekly protests in front of the Capitol to pressure leaders to address climate change. She dubbed her movement “Fire Drill Fridays,” and soon Fonda and a host of famous friends, including co-star Lily Tomlin and Ted Danson, were arrested and herded into police vans, wrists ziptied.</p>

<p>Long ago, Fonda made an important calculation about her celebrity: People were going to watch her, and she could use their attention to promote her agenda. For decades, she’s spoken out against the status quo and made headlines for agitating against authority, be it opposition to the Vietnam War or social inequality. Her mug shot from a Cleveland jail in 1970, fist raised and hair shagged, became an iconic symbol of people power and feminism.</p>

<p>Even the Jane Fonda workout—her quintessential-1980s exercise videos that became a global aerobics phenomenon—was created to raise funds for an organization she helped start with her then-husband, political activist Tom Hayden, to end corporate control of the economy. Inspired by Lyndon LaRouche, an infamous fascist hatemonger who used his computer business profits to pay for antigay protests, Fonda tried to think of what business she could start to fund the causes she cared about. She thought about starting a restaurant, but after someone advised her not to go into an industry she didn’t understand, she thought, “There’s only one thing I understand, and that is working out.” With her bouncy ringlets and tiny leotard-clad figure, Fonda showed people how to target their inner-thigh muscles—while raising $17 million to fight poverty, racial injustice, and corporate malfeasance.</p>
<p>Despite her long history of fighting for change, Fonda says it is only now as an octogenarian that she senses her strength as an activist. She’s been frank—in her memoir My Life So Far and in a 2018 HBO documentary, Jane Fonda in Five Acts—that it’s taken her a long time to feel she’s fully present and living her life for herself. Married to three different powerful men over the decades—French director Roger Vadim, who directed her in the 1960s sci-spoof Barbarella; Hayden; and media mogul Ted Turner—Fonda says she often felt unsure of herself and preferred to follow others. “I always felt like the student,” she says. “This is the first time that I am the leader.”</p>
<p>After her fourth arrest this fall, the endlessly glamorous actress had to spend the night in jail. While Fonda is matter-of-fact in saying she’s far more fortunate than most—“I’m white and I’m famous and I think orders came down from the attorney general to handle me with kid gloves”—it isn’t easy spending the night in jail when you’re in your eighties. She used her red coat to soften the metal of her bunk and managed to sleep through the sounds of fellow inmates sobbing, screaming, and rattling the bars of their cells. “It’s very hard in life to find a way to align your body with your deepest values, and that’s what civil disobedience can do,” says Fonda, building to a rapturous crescendo when she describes the way her renewed purpose makes her feel. “Even though you’re being handcuffed and put in a situation where you have absolutely no control, it’s like stepping in to yourself. I have chosen to put myself in this position where I lose all power because of something I believe in. And it’s incredible.”</p>
<p>Her resolve is greater than ever. She expanded Fire Drill Fridays, first to the West Coast, with a protest held in front of L.A.&lsquo;s City Hall in February, and now, to the entire nation—virtually. In March, during the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, Fonda announced that she would be moving Fire Drill Fridays online starting April 3. (Text Jane to 877877 for more info.)</p>
<p>Prior to the national mandate for social distancing and isolation, Fonda had planned to take a two-year hiatus from acting to tour the country and get out the climate vote. She says she’s a good messenger because, well, she’s old. “I’m 82, which is very useful because people say, ‘Well, gosh, if she can do it, I can do it, too.’&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="breast-cancer-survivor-jane-fonda-82-embodies-resilience-and-strength-as-elle-magazines-april-cover-model">Breast Cancer Survivor Jane Fonda, 82, Embodies Resilience And Strength As Elle Magazine’s April Cover Model</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets.survivornet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/02101200/Screen-Shot-2020-04-02-at-10.10.34-AM-1200x630.png" alt="img">
Jane Fonda is 82-years-old and on the cover of Elle. She is a breast cancer survivor and a thriver. Whatever you think about Fonda, it’s a remarkable reminder about resilience.</p>
<p>Fonda announced to fans that she is the face of Elle’s Earth Day issue, which focuses on women fighting for climate justice. Dressed in a black and grey power suit, Fonda is channeling the strength and power of both a cancer survivor and environmental rights activist.</p>
<p>The actress revealed in 2010 that she experienced a breast cancer scare after doctors discovered a small, non-invasive tumor. Fonda underwent a procedure at the time, and her representative declared her “cancer-free.” In 2016, Fonda had a mastectomy before the Golden Globe Awards.</p>
<p>Related: When Should You Consider a Mastectomy?</p>
<p>Fonda’s cancer battle didn’t stop there. In 2018, while speaking to The Today Show, Fonda addressed bandages on her face by explaining she had a cancer taken away from her lip.</p>
<p>“Well, the world is falling apart, what’s a lip?” Fonda asked. “Yeah, they did (biopsy it.) I’m going to be fine, thanks.”</p>
<p>Breast Cancer And Considering A Mastectomy</p>
<p>Fonda isn’t the only celebrity to go through a mastectomy, other familiar faces like Elle’s Editor-In-Chief Nina Garcia, Angelina Jolie, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and others have all opened up about their experiences with the procedure.</p>
<p>A mastectomy is a procedure which removes either one or both breasts. It’s usually done to treat breast cancer, but other women have the surgery to prevent a breast cancer diagnosis if there’s history of the disease in their family. However when considering a mastectomy, there are a few factors to weigh in the decision.</p>
<p>Related: Implant Reconstruction After a Mastectomy: The Options</p>
<p>“Depending on the size and other features, such as family history, a patient may opt for more aggressive surgery,” Dr. Elizabeth Comen, a medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, tells SurvivorNet.</p>
<p>In addition to risk factors, there are a few surgery options patients should keep in mind while approaching physicians for breast cancer treatment.</p>
<p>Dr. Ann Partridge explains when women should consider a mastectomy during breast cancer treatment</p>
<p>“When I talk to a woman who comes to me and she has breast cancer, I evaluate what the standard options for treatment for her are, which typically include cutting out the cancer — which is either a lumpectomy if you can get it all with just a little scooping around of the area that’s abnormal or a mastectomy for some women meaning taking the full breast because sometimes these lesions can be very extensive in the breast,” Dr. Ann Patridge, a medical oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, explains to SurvivorNet.</p>
