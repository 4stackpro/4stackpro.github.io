London (CNN) British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is receiving &ldquo;standard oxygen treatment&rdquo; and is breathing without assistance, his spokesperson said Tuesday, a day after being transferred to intensive care with coronavirus .</p>
<p>Johnson&rsquo;s condition is stable and he &ldquo;remains in good spirits,&rdquo; his spokesperson said. He has not required invasive or non-invasive ventilation and does not have pneumonia.</p>
<p>But the seriousness of the Prime Minister&rsquo;s condition at a time of national emergency, combined with the lack of a formal succession procedure for heads of government in the UK, has raised questions about who is leading the country.</p>
<p>Johnson has nominated his Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, to deputize for him &ldquo;as necessary&rdquo; but there is no recent precedent for a sitting UK prime minister becoming incapacitated for a lengthy period.</p>
<p>In its daily update to reporters, Downing Street moved to head off concerns, stressing that Raab was running the country from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office with the support of government officials.</p>
<p>Raab would chair meetings of the National Security Council if any were needed while he was deputizing for the Prime Minister, a spokesperson said. Raab, 46, and the UK&rsquo;s Cabinet have the authority and ability to respond in the PM&rsquo;s absence on military action, the spokesperson added.</p>
<p>Decisions relating to Covid-19 would be taken in the usual way through the daily morning meeting, chaired by Raab, and other ministerial groupings. But Raab would not have the power to hire and fire ministers or officials, the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Few formal powers are invested specifically in the UK prime minister and key decisions are taken collectively by the Cabinet or its sub-committees. Many statutory powers are held by individual secretaries of state. But in recent decades, holders of the UK&rsquo;s top political office have adopted a more presidential style, and the sweeping nature of the ruling Conservative Party&rsquo;s most recent election victory was attributed to Johnson&rsquo;s personal appeal with voters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Prime Minister has a team around him who ensure the work of government goes on,&rdquo; a senior Cabinet minister, Michael Gove, told the BBC earlier. He sidestepped a question about who would take decisions in the event of a nuclear attack, saying he would not discuss national security issues.</p>
<p>Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the House of Commons defense select committee, tweeted good wishes to Johnson but added: &ldquo;It is important to have 100% clarity as to where responsibility for UK national security decisions now lies. We must anticipate adversaries attempting to exploit any perceived weakness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Buckingham Palace and the Queen have been regularly updated on Johnson&rsquo;s condition, Downing Street said. The Prime Minister&rsquo;s two most senior officials, the cabinet secretary and his principal private secretary, will maintain contact with the palace on the Prime Minister&rsquo;s behalf, but the weekly audiences with the Queen would not continue for the time being.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister&rsquo;s spokesperson said that despite the lack of a formal succession procedure in the UK, there was an established order of ministerial precedence, with the top finance minister, Rishi Sunak following Raab. The &ldquo;letters of last resort,&rdquo; sealed documents written by the Prime Minister to ballistic missile submarine commanders in cases of a nuclear attack, still stand. &ldquo;The Prime Minister remains the Prime Minister,&rdquo; the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The UK lockdown will remain in place with the government &ldquo;focused on stopping the spread of the infection.&rdquo; The spokesperson said that if there were evidence that more needed to be done to slow the rate of transmission, &ldquo;we would be prepared to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump said at a Monday news conference that his administration had been in contact with Johnson&rsquo;s doctors. The Prime Minister&rsquo;s spokesperson said the government was &ldquo;grateful for all of the warm wishes the PM has received overnight&rdquo; and &ldquo;confident he is receiving the best care from the NHS. Any treatment he receives is a matter for his doctors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gove told BBC Radio 4&rsquo;s Today program earlier that Johnson was &ldquo;receiving the very best care&rdquo; at St. Thomas&rsquo; Hospital in London, after being taken into intensive care at 7 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET) on Monday. Gove later said he was self-isolating at home because a member of his family was showing coronavirus symptoms. Gove said on Twitter that he was not displaying any symptoms and was continuing to work.</p>
<p>The coronavirus has hit the top of the British government hard. The Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, said on March 27 that he had the virus, on the same day that chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, announced that he would begin self-isolation after displaying Covid-19 symptoms. Neil Ferguson, a top UK government adviser on the virus, said on March 18 he believed he had been infected.</p>
<p>Various other senior government ministers and advisers have been forced to self-isolate. Dominic Cummings, the Prime Minister&rsquo;s senior adviser, who self-isolated soon after Johnson&rsquo;s diagnosis, has not yet returned to work, Downing Street said.</p>
<p>Johnson was taken to hospital on Sunday evening. At the time, Downing Street said the decision was a precaution because he continued to suffer from a cough and a fever ten days after testing positive for the coronavirus. But his condition deteriorated on Monday, Downing Street said, and he was moved to the intensive care unit at St. Thomas&rsquo; Hospital.</p>
<p>Gove told Sky News on Tuesday morning that Cabinet ministers were not told about the Prime Minister&rsquo;s deteriorating condition until nearly an hour after Johnson was taken into intensive care.</p>
<p>Asked whether the government had been up front with the public about Johnson&rsquo;s condition, and whether the Cabinet had been taken by surprise, he replied: &ldquo;Yes we were. The [daily coronavirus] briefing that was given at 5 o&rsquo;clock was given at a time when we didn&rsquo;t know about the deterioration in the Prime Minister&rsquo;s condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were informed subsequently. The Prime Minister was admitted to intensive care at 7 o&rsquo;clock, and that information wasn&rsquo;t given to us in government &ndash; to those in the cabinet &ndash; until just before 8 o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Politicians around the world sent best wishes for the Prime Minister&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>UK Treasurer Rishi Sunak said on Twitter that his thoughts were with Johnson and his pregnant fiancée, Carrie Symonds. &ldquo;I know he&rsquo;ll be getting the best care possible and will come out of this even stronger,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Symonds has also experienced Covid-19 symptoms but said over the weekend she was &ldquo;on the mend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The leader of the UK&rsquo;s House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, said: &ldquo;I know the thoughts and prayers of everyone across the House are with the Prime Minister and his family right now. We all wish him a speedy recovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keir Starmer, the newly elected leader of the UK&rsquo;s main opposition Labour Party leader, tweeted: &ldquo;Terribly sad news. All the country&rsquo;s thoughts are with the Prime Minister and his family during this incredibly difficult time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Former Prime Minister Theresa May, who was replaced by Johnson in the country&rsquo;s Brexit crisis, wrote on Twitter said her &ldquo;thoughts and prayers&rdquo; were with Johnson and his family. &ldquo;This horrific virus does not discriminate,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron sent his &ldquo;support to Boris Johnson, to his family and to the British people at this difficult moment,&rdquo; wishing him a &ldquo;speedy recovery at this testing time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Irish leader Leo Varadkar, who has returned to work as a doctor during the outbreak, tweeted that Johnson was &ldquo;in our thoughts&rdquo; on Monday night and wished him &ldquo;a rapid return to health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>President Donald Trump said on Monday: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very saddened to hear that he was taken into intensive care this a little while ago. He&rsquo;s been a really good friend. He&rsquo;s been really something very special. Strong. Resolute.&rdquo;

<h3 id="boris-johnson-moved-to-intensive-care-unit-with-coronavirus-symptoms">Boris Johnson moved to intensive care unit with coronavirus symptoms</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200406162636-boris-johnson-december-2019-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
London (CNN) UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was moved to an intensive care unit Monday after his condition with coronavirus symptoms &ldquo;worsened,&rdquo; his office has said.</p>
<p>Johnson, 55, was first admitted to St Thomas&rsquo; Hospital in London on Sunday evening for what he said were &ldquo;routine tests,&rdquo; saying on social media that he was in &ldquo;good spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the apparent change in the leader&rsquo;s health has shocked the nation, with politicians from his party and the opposition voicing their support for the leader, as the country battles an outbreak that has killed more than 5,000 people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the course of this afternoon, the condition of the Prime Minister has worsened and, on the advice of his medical team, he has been moved to the Intensive Care Unit at the hospital,&rdquo; a Downing Street spokesperson said.</p>
<p>According to Downing Street officials, Johnson remains conscious and has been moved to the intensive care unit as a precaution, in case he requires ventilation.</p>
<p>The move strikes a sharp contrast to earlier reports on Johnson&rsquo;s condition: During his period of self-isolation, Downing Street had said that Johnson&rsquo;s symptoms were &ldquo;mild,&rdquo; and on Sunday said his hospitalization was just a &quot; precautionary step .&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prime Minister&rsquo;s spokesperson had said earlier on Monday that Johnson spent a &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; night in hospital, but would not comment on reports Johnson was given oxygen. Officials are no longer describing his symptoms as mild.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is the First Secretary of State and the most senior Cabinet minister, said Johnson had asked him to deputize for the leader where necessary.</p>
<p>Raab chaired Monday&rsquo;s regular morning coronavirus briefing and made a televised statement saying that the government will continue Johnson&rsquo;s direction in responding to the outbreak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The government&rsquo;s business will continue and the Prime Minister is in safe hands with a brilliant team at St Thomas&rsquo;s hospital. And the focus of the government will continue to be on making sure that the Prime Minister&rsquo;s direction, all the plans for making sure that we can defeat coronavirus and can pull the country through this challenge, will be taken forward,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He added there was an &ldquo;incredibly strong team spirit&rdquo; in government behind the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Johnson was moved to the intensive care unit at around 7 p.m., Downing Street said. The decision was made by the leader&rsquo;s medical team after his condition worsened over the afternoon on Monday.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom&rsquo;s death toll of above 5,000 is one of the highest in the world. The government has been scrambling to implement widespread testing as evidence grows that asymptomatic people could carry and spread the virus.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Together we will beat this,&rsquo; Johnson said</p>
<p>Johnson was hospitalized Sunday because he was still suffering coronavirus symptoms 10 days after testing positive for the virus.</p>
<p>The British leader announced on March 27 that he had been infected and was, at the time, suffering mild symptoms including a cough and fever.</p>
<p>At the time, he vowed to continue leading the nation&rsquo;s response to the outbreak and hold meetings via video-conference, saying in a video: &ldquo;Together we will beat this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>British politicians from Johnson&rsquo;s ruling Conservative Party, as well as the main opposition Labour Party, have united in their wishes for the Prime Minister&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>Treasurer Rishi Sunak said on Twitter that his thoughts were with Johnson and his pregnant fiancée, Carrie Symonds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know he&rsquo;ll be getting the best care possible and will come out of this even stronger,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Symonds has also experienced Covid-19 symptoms but said over the weekend she was &ldquo;on the mend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The leader of the country&rsquo;s House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, said Johnson&rsquo;s admission to intensive care was &ldquo;terrible news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the thoughts and prayers of everyone across the House are with the Prime Minister and his family right now. We all wish him a speedy recovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A still from a video that UK Prime MInister Boris Johnson uploaded on March 27 to announce he had been infected.</p>
<p>Keir Starmer, the newly elected leader of the main opposition Labour Party said the development was &ldquo;Terribly sad news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the country&rsquo;s thoughts are with the Prime Minister and his family during this incredibly difficult time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And former Prime Minister Theresa May, who was replaced by Johnson in the country&rsquo;s Brexit crisis, also sent her wishes to the leader on Twitter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My thoughts and prayers are with @BorisJohnson and his family as he continues to receive treatment in hospital. This horrific virus does not discriminate. Anyone can get it. Anyone can spread it. Please #StayHomeSaveLives,&rdquo; May wrote.</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron also sent his wishes. &ldquo;I send all my support to Boris Johnson, to his family and to the British people at this difficult moment. I wish him a speedy recovery at this testing time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump responded to the news during a daily press conference, and said that his administration had been in contact with Johnson&rsquo;s doctors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also want to send best wishes to a very good friend of mine and a friend of our nation Prime Minster Boris Johnson. We&rsquo;re very saddened to hear that he was taken into intensive care this a little while ago,&rdquo; Trump said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been a really good friend. He&rsquo;s been really something very special. Strong. Resolute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve contacted all of Boris&rsquo;s doctors, and we&rsquo;ll see what is going to take place, but they are ready to go,&rdquo; Trump continued. &ldquo;When you are brought into intensive care that gets very, very serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are working with London with respect to Boris Johnson,&rdquo; he concluded.</p>
<p>Last night, on the advice of my doctor, I went into hospital for some routine tests as I&rsquo;m still experiencing coronavirus symptoms. I&rsquo;m in good spirits and keeping in touch with my team, as we work together to fight this virus and keep everyone safe. — Boris Johnson #StayHomeSaveLives (@BorisJohnson) April 6, 2020</p>
<p>Before being moved to intensive care, Johnson had said he was keeping in touch with his team and thanked staff at Britain&rsquo;s National Health Service for taking care of him.
