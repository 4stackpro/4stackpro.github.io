美國調查新聞網站《The Intercept》踢爆，TikTok不允許「長相醜陋、有肢體障礙或貧窮者」的影片登上推薦頁面，嚴重歧視用戶。圖為tiktok示意圖。 圖：翻攝自tiktok</p>
<p>美國專門調查政府濫權證據的新聞網站《The Intercept》取得一份TikTok內部資料，發現TikTok會針對直播內容進行言論審查，凡是傷害中國「國家榮譽」的內容一律禁止，業者還要求管理員在設定推薦頁面時，不得列入「長相醜陋、有肢體障礙或貧窮者」的影片。</p>
<p>中國社群軟體「抖音」在全球擁有全球數億用戶，是非常受歡迎的短影片平台網站，後來衍生出國際版「TikTok」，儘管TikTok極力撇清和抖音的關係，但仍擺脫不了外界疑慮。繼美國軍方禁止內部使用TikTok後，美國1名少女阿濟茲（Feroza Aziz）在影片中談及新疆再教育營，結果影片慘遭下架，更令外界質疑TikTok打著「國際版」名號，宣稱自由開放，私底下仍將中國的言論審查搬到海外干涉外國用戶。</p>
<p>如今，外媒的報導進一步證實了此事。據內部文件顯示，TikTok要求管理員配合中國外交政策，遇到直播內容出現涉及「推廣台獨、誹謗中國公務員、事涉國家機構、天安門事件」等「威脅國家安全」的內容時，就要下架該影片。</p>
<p>更誇張的是，TikTok還要求管理員在設定頁首的推薦頁面「For You」時，移除那些「長得醜、有肢體障礙」的影片，認為「如果主角長得醜、有啤酒肚、皺紋太多、笑得不好看，這類影片一定比較不吸引人，不值得推薦給其他用戶」。</p>
<p>此外，TikTok還會檢查影片的拍攝場景，倘若牆壁有破損、背景有不適當的裝飾、或者拍攝環境太破爛老舊，這類影片不僅登不上推薦頁面，還會被刻意降低曝光度，被外媒批為「歧視窮人、歧視用戶」。</p>
<p>對此，TikTok坦承確有這些準則，目的是為了防止霸凌，但這些規則大部分已經沒有使用或是從未使用過，並強調TikTok是一個可讓用戶公開表達自我的平台。不過，據外媒調查，這份文件至少到去年底都還在使用。

Daisy Keech is social media creator who helped establish the Hype House, a Los Angeles-based TikTok creator collective, in December 2018.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Keech uploaded a video to her YouTube channel titled &ldquo;The Truth about the Hype House,&rdquo; detailing why she recently parted ways with the collective and what she learned from the experience.</p>
<p>The video elicited strong responses from members of the Hype House as well as the public.</p>
<p>Visit Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that a power struggle and legal dispute has been percolating at the Hype House, the TikTok creator collective and collab house that previously included twenty of the platform&rsquo;s most influential stars. Now, former member Daisy Keech is going public with her side of the story on her YouTube channel.</p>
<p>At the heart of the matter are two of the collective&rsquo;s most recognizable faces: 20-year-old Keech, who is no longer part of the group, and 21-year-old Thomas Petrou. In most retellings of the Hype House&rsquo;s origin story, Petrou is credited with co-founding the group in partnership with 17-year-old Chase &ldquo;Lil Huddy&rdquo; Hudson in December 2018. Per his Instagram bio, Petrou also considers himself to be the group&rsquo;s &ldquo;manager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But recently, Keech began voicing a desire to be recognized as a co-founder, too.</p>
<p>Up to this point, both parties have remained relatively quiet on the disagreement and the falling out it seemingly caused. However, in a video uploaded to YouTube on Saturday, Keech addressed the situation and why she will no longer be involved with the group.</p>
<p>In the video, Keech detailed how her friendship with Petrou and the creators of the Hype House.</p>
<p>Per Keech, her close friendship with Petrou began during his involvement with Team 10, Jake Paul&rsquo;s now-defunct YouTube creator collective. When Petrou was &ldquo;let go&rdquo; from Team 10, Keech said she hired him as her &ldquo;full-time photographer and editor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hung out almost every single day,&rdquo; she said of Petrou during this period. &ldquo;We told each other everything. He was my best friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was around this time, Keech continued in the clip, that Petrou started talking about wanting to create a collab house. After Petrou did a photoshoot for Hudson, Petrou and Keech were introduced to Hudson&rsquo;s friends and fellow creators Alex Warren and Kouvr Annon. Back then, Hudson was staying at an Airbnb rental in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>According to Keech, the five creators became fast friends and quickly began to talk more seriously about starting a collab house.</p>
<p>So, according to Keech, they started searching for houses to rent together on Zillow.</p>
<p>When the group eventually found the Spanish-style mansion that is now known as the Hype House, they pooled their resources to come up with the $46,000 deposit. Keech said she believed in the project so much that she volunteered to put down as much as she could, and in order to secure the property, she and Hudson contributed $18,000 each. Thomas, meanwhile, contributed $5,000, as did Warren and Annon.</p>
<p>Eagerly, the group moved into the space and set up social media accounts for the Hype House.</p>
<p>The collective almost immediately picked up traction online, and as their following grew, reporters including Taylor Lorenz of the New York Times reached out for interviews.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep in mind, this is my very first like, in-person interaction with the press,&rdquo; Keech said of the New York Times interview. &ldquo;There was a full-on production team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the video, Keech remembered feeling &ldquo;intimidated&rdquo; during the interview, which she characterized as her first &ldquo;in-person interaction with the press.&rdquo; But she assumed Petrou and Hudson would, &ldquo;out of integrity,&rdquo; acknowledge that the creation of Hype House had been a &ldquo;team effort.&rdquo; Instead, Keech said Petrou and Hudson &ldquo;completely took over,&rdquo; while she remained silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being 20 years old and not having like a manager there with me kind of like Chase had, like I had no idea to speak up and to say that I was a co-founder,&rdquo; Keech explained.</p>
<p>She continued, &ldquo;I know that Chase&rsquo;s manager was like, really really pushing him to speak up and to make it known that he was a co-founder, which I think is very important. It&rsquo;s very very smart of her. And I wish even that I had someone telling me to go get some recognition. Because I know that I deserved it. I put down $18,000, plus my own platform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorenz, who wrote the New York Times piece about the Hype House, acknowledged that, for the public, it can be intimidating to speak with reporters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always try to get around that by spending as much time with people as possible,&rdquo; Lorenz told Insider in a phone interview. &ldquo;I reached out to all of them. I personally gave everyone in the house my personal contact information, my phone number, you know. I gave my card out. I left a stack of cards there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lorenz was careful to review evidence, in the form of emails and text messages, indicating that Hudson and Petrou had discussed the formation of a TikTok collab house prior to Keech&rsquo;s involvement. But Keech never followed up during or after the interview to dispute their claims. That is, until Keech&rsquo;s lawyer reached out to Lorenz a month and a half later to request a correction to the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sympathetic to Daisy because I think, you know, so often women do get kind of railroaded in these situations,&rdquo; Lorenz said. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s her job to speak up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The New York Times has not offered a correction to the story, nor has Insider, who has received a similar request.</p>
<p>In the following days and weeks, the group did interviews with other media outlets when Keech was not present.</p>
<p>In an interview with YouTuber Tom Ward, Petrou and Chase were interviewed separately from the group, and told Ward they referred to themselves as the co-founders, noting that they pushed the group into existence.</p>
<p>According to Keech, she told Petrou she found it &ldquo;a little bit messed up that no one else was given credit.&rdquo; Keech said she &ldquo;defended the other co-founders&rdquo; and their right to be recognized as well. By the end of that conversation, Keech said she felt like she and Petrou had resolved the issue.</p>
<p>But, in subsequent coverage of the collective, Keech was still characterized as a member. Per Keech&rsquo;s recollection, Petrou said he failed to credit her simply because she wasn&rsquo;t present for the interviews and he agreed that she deserved recognition. But on social media, Petrou persisted in upholding the narrative that he and Hudson were the group&rsquo;s only co-founders.</p>
<p>It was, at this point, that Petrou, according to Keech, started to act &ldquo;sketchy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The group&rsquo;s business email account, for example, was tied to Thomas&rsquo;s email, and he refused to share access, according to Keech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no transparency at all,&rdquo; Keech recounted. &ldquo;We had no idea what brand deals were coming, if they were actually just a &lsquo;product for exposure collaboration,&rsquo; and we had no idea if they were paid or not. He [Petrou] claims the Hype House has made no money, yet he&rsquo;s bragging about an $8,000 Cartier bracelet he just bought, a $10,000 cat. He&rsquo;s talking about buying a new Tesla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keech went on to claim that Petrou controlled the group&rsquo;s social media accounts, and therefore, their public image.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A trend I&rsquo;m starting to notice is that he loves to have power,&rdquo; Keech said. &ldquo;He loves to be able to tell people what to do, when to do it, and how to do it. It started to feel like a fucking dictatorship in this house — in a house that he barely even paid for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keech then described another alleged incident, in which Petrou asked her to &ldquo;manipulate&rdquo; a female creator who was thinking about joining the group. Upon reflection, Keech now views the moment as a &ldquo;red flag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you just go act like you&rsquo;re her best friend that way she wants to be a part of this? Like, she needs to feel welcome and like she has friends here,'&rdquo; Keech recalled.</p>
<p>In the video, Keech cited a third incident in which &ldquo;one of the other co-founders&rdquo; found out that they&rsquo;d been denied a &ldquo;great&rdquo; press opportunity that they &ldquo;really, really&rdquo; wanted to do, because it would benefit their personal brand as well as that of the Hype House. According to Keech, Petrou ended the spat by saying, &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not your decision because I make all the decisions around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The alleged lack of group decision-making wasn&rsquo;t the only problem for Keech.</p>
<p>She also felt &ldquo;very uncomfortable&rdquo; about some of the things that were being done to and in the house, for which she was &ldquo;legally liable&rdquo; since her name is allegedly on the lease. It was then, Keech said, that she started speaking her mind more often. But gradually, Petrou began phasing her out of the group by failing to mention important dates to her.</p>
<p>In a private conversation with Keech&rsquo;s lawyer and manager Chris Young, which Keech recounted in her video, Petrou offered the following explanation for his behavior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thomas said to him, &lsquo;You know what, I&rsquo;m just more of a businessman. And girls like Daisy, she&rsquo;s just another hot Instagram model with a shelf life.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling uneasy about the future of her role in the group, Keech decided to take action. In her video, Keech described filing applications to register the group&rsquo;s name with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, over concerns that another company would succeed in doing so first and prevent the group from selling merchandise. She also motioned for the group to discuss and allocate partial ownership to each stakeholder, as a first step in creating some kind of internal structure for the business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He kept ignoring me,&rdquo; she said. I had my lawyer reach out to him multiple times. He ignored my lawyer. So, I was just really confused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keech said Petrou also appeared to be &ldquo;putting off&rdquo; important measures, such as creating a board and hosting board meetings.</p>
<p>Finally, Keech and Petrou&rsquo;s disagreements came to head.</p>
<p>In her video, Keech recalled arriving home one day to find a music video shoot underway at the Hype House. Petrou claimed he&rsquo;d notified the group of the shoot via text, but according to Keech, a date was never mentioned to her or the house&rsquo;s landlord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I go in my room and it is swarmed with people and clothing racks and I&rsquo;m like, what the hell is happening?&rdquo; Keech said.</p>
<p>According to Keech, Petrou has defended his actions by saying the rental home itself is unrelated to the Hype House as a business. Rather, it is simply a place for the talent to stay. But Keech maintained that she, Petrou, Hudson, Warren, and Annon &ldquo;went into this&rdquo; knowing they would be &ldquo;in business together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was trying to tell me the $18K that I put down for this business was just so a bunch of friends could live together and has nothing to do with the Hype House,&rdquo; Keech said. &ldquo;I just met these kids, keep in mind. I met them a week before we all moved in. We all put down a significant amount of money so we could have a big enough house for the Hype House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a final confrontation at the house, Petrou unfollowed Keech on all social media platforms. He then hosted a team meeting and asked the rest of the Hype House members to unfollow and block her as well, according to the video.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I kept believing the best in him, because I never thought in a million years he would do something like this to me,&rdquo; Keech said. &ldquo;Now I feel like from Day 1, he knew I had money and knew that we needed a big house and just used me for my money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keech ended the upload by saying she forgives Petrou.</p>
<p>Petrou and other Hype House members responded angrily to Keech&rsquo;s video on social media.</p>
<p>On his Instagram story, Petrou made two posts that appeared to be addressed to Keech.</p>
<p>In one, he seemingly called Keech&rsquo;s account &ldquo;lies on lies on lies.&rdquo; In another, he wrote about his disdain for &ldquo;fake people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Similar rebuttals of Keech&rsquo;s summary of the situation were shared by Warren and Annon on Twitter and Instagram.</p>
