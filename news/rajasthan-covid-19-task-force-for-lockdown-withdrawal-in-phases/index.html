<p>Updated: Apr 12, 2020 16:08 IST</p>
<p>Rajasthan’s Covid-19 task force has recommended the phased withdrawal of the lockdown, ideally in districts with no infections, by allowing movement of vehicles transporting goods and agricultural value chain operations with conditions.</p>
<p>The task force, headed by the additional chief secretary, was set up to suggest ways to withdraw the lockdown. The panel has submitted its report to the chief minister, and it will now be sent to the Central government.</p>
<p>O April 4, chief minister Ashok Gehlot had formed two task forces to give suggestions on the phased withdrawal of the lockdown and on bringing the economy back on track.</p>
<p>A senior official said on condition of anonymity that the 12-member task force has recommended that the lockdown should be withdrawn in phases, and not in one go, based on the number of infections in districts.</p>
<p>The panel has placed districts in four categories based on the number of Covid-19 cases – high risk, medium risk, low risk, and districts with no cases, such as Bundi, Jalore, Sirohi, Hanumangarh and Baran.</p>
<p>The report recommended allowing agricultural value chain operations (production, marketing and consumption) with conditions. The task force emphasised the need to strengthen National Agriculture Marketing (eNAM), a pan-India electronic trading portal, which connects all agricultural markets (mandis), the official said.</p>
<p>The task force also recommended allowing the transportation of goods and opening up of the services sector, including electricians, and repairs of coolers and air conditioning units, along with the supply of medicines and groceries and the continuation of banking operations, the official said.</p>
<p>In addition, food delivery services, including by restaurants, and services such as plumbers, hair salons, laundries, cobblers and tailoring should be considered for resumption, the official said.</p>
<p>“The report said schools, colleges and libraries should stay closed, and factories with labour staying in the premises and major mining operations may be allowed,” he said.</p>
<p>The task force recommended that some activities should be permitted only after the return of normalcy, such as social gatherings of more than 20 people, markets in narrow lanes, cinemas, gyms, clubs and swimming pools, the official said.</p>
<p>“The panel has suggested ensuring that those given permits are bound to follow the advisories of the health department, such as wearing masks, using sanitisers and maintaining social distancing,” he said.</p>
<p>The report also gave details of the Covid-19 situation in Rajasthan, including hotspots and growth charts for infections.</p>
<p>Rajasthan had imposed a lockdown on March 22, three days before the nationwide lockdown announced by the Central government.</p>
<p>The 12-member task force comprised officials and experts such as additional chief secretary (home) Rajeeva Swaroop, additional chief secretary (health) Rohit Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary (industry) Subodh Agarwal, director general of police Bhupendra Singh, additional director general of police (crime) BL Soni, the heads of the energy, agriculture, food and civil supply, and labour departments and health experts Ashok Pangariya, Virendra Singh and SD Gupta.

<h3 id="rajasthan-lockdown-decision-on-extending-lockdown-will-be-taken-keeping-public-health-in-mind-says-cm">Rajasthan Lockdown: Decision on extending lockdown will be taken keeping public health in mind, says CM</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.financialexpress.com/2020/03/AshokGehlot.jpg" alt="img">
While Odisha and Punjab have extended the lockdown till April 30 and May 1 respectively, other states are brainstorming on the issue.</p>
<p>Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Friday said the decision on extending the lockdown in the state beyond April 14 will be taken while keeping public health in mind. Discussing the situation through video conferencing with representatives of industrial organisations and various business associations, the chief minister said protecting the lives of people was paramount for the state government.</p>
<p>“Keeping this in mind, the decision on the lockdown will be taken,” Gehlot said. He said entrepreneurs and traders have supported the government in handling the pandemic by maintaining the supply chain of essential commodities during the lockdown period. “The government stands with entrepreneurs in this hour of crisis, and industries related to essential commodities, which were allowed to open in lockdown, will not require any kind of permission to conduct their work smoothly,” he said.</p>
<p>The chief minister took feedback from representatives of various associations such as of grocery, vegetable vendors, medicine, dairy, hotel, mining and jewelery and builders. He heard their suggestions related to the smooth supply of essential commodities and lifting the lockdown. The state’s urban development and housing (UDH) minister Shanti Dhariwal said Rajasthan was the first state to announce a lockdown after it anticipated the possibility of spread of the contagious virus and the move helped the state government in containing the disease’s community spread to a great extent.</p>
<p>Industry minister Parsadi Lal Meena, food and civil supply minister Ramesh Meena, agriculture minister Lalchand Kataria, Gaupalan minister Pramod Jain Bhaya, cooperative minister Udai Lal Anjana, health minister Raghu Sharma, chief secretary DB Gupta and other officers also attended the video conference. Prime Minister Narendra had last month announced a nationwide lockdown from March 25 to April 14 to control the spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p>While Odisha and Punjab have extended the lockdown till April 30 and May 1 respectively, other states are brainstorming on the issue.

This was before Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 25 announced a pan-India 21-day lockdown.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh unanimously extended the lockdown till May 1. His announcement came a day after Odisha said the lockdown in the state will be extended until the end of this month.</p>
