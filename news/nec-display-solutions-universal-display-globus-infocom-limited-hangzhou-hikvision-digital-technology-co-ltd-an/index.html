<p>(Washington, DC) – The International Monetary Fund should include transparency and anti-corruption measures in coronavirus-related emergency relief programs to ensure that the billions of dollars it is disbursing to dozens of countries help the most vulnerable, Transparency International, Human Rights Watch, and Global Witness said today in a letter to the IMF Executive Board.</p>
<p>“The urgent need to support countries in their efforts during the pandemic makes transparency and accountability in government spending critically important,” said Delia Ferreira Rubio, Chair of Transparency International. “The crisis requires the IMF to make funds available as quickly as possible, but it shouldn’t abandon its commitment to fighting corruption. The scale of the crisis raises the risks and dangers of the theft of public money that should be used to save lives and rebuild livelihoods.”</p>
<p>Over 90 countries have already requested emergency assistance, the highest number in the IMF’s 75-year history. Unlike with the fund’s standard programs, emergency funds are generally disbursed in lump sums, with limited, if any, transparency, conditions, or reviews.</p>
<p>In recent years, the IMF has put a renewed emphasis on combatting corruption as part of a broader recognition that resilient economies require good governance, inclusive growth, and strong social protections. In April 2018, it adopted a new framework that committed the fund to systematically address corruption risks in its surveillance and lending.</p>
<p>“The IMF’s pledge to unleash up to $1 trillion to help governments in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic holds extraordinary potential to save lives and protect the people hardest hit,” said Sarah Saadoun, business and human rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. “With lives on the line, it is critical for the IMF to maintain its commitment to stem corruption so that people can hold their governments accountable for where the money goes.”</p>
<p>Dramatic increases in the amounts and speed of spending, as well as distractions or breakdowns that interfere with oversight mechanisms, can allow powerful actors to take advantage of the crisis for their own benefit. Even at this early stage of the pandemic, there are dozens of media reports of corruption and other criminal activities related to COVID-19 spending.</p>
<p>Simon Taylor, Founder at Global Witness, said: “Recent years have seen the IMF creatively use its leverage to help drive anti-corruption reforms. The pandemic is wreaking havoc with public health and the economies of nations, so it is right for the IMF to step in to help – but we call for the Fund’s leadership to make sure that rapid disbursements do not come at the expense of basic transparency and sensible anti-corruption measures that should be required of recipient countries.”</p>
<p>Corruption’s drain on public resources always harms governments’ ability to provide adequate health care, education, and other rights, the groups said. During this crisis, it can mean the difference between life and death; adequate food or hunger; a house or homelessness. Moreover, the IMF can systematically include basic measures to reduce the risks of mismanagement and corruption without compromising the speed and flexibility the crisis demands. The organizations proposed four such measures:

<h3 id="the-federal-reserves-new-programs-must-be-transparent-to-the-public">The Federal Reserve’s new programs must be transparent to the public</h3>
<p><img src="" alt="img">
For Immediate Release</p>
<p>WASHINGTON – The Federal Reserve released details today about $2.3 trillion in new lending and asset-purchase measures intended to stabilize the economy. The announcement solidifies the central bank’s foray into decidedly new territory &ndash; including lending to small and mid-sized businesses for the first time in history and expanding corporate lending and debt buy-back programs to include riskier classes of corporate debt.</p>
<p>In response, U.S. PIRG Tax and Budget advocate R.J. Cross released the following statement:</p>
<p>“Never before, not even during the Great Recession in 2008, has the Federal Reserve directed so much money to help so many companies so quickly. Its unprecedented efforts may prove essential. But with unprecedented power comes unprecedented responsibility to inform and engage the public.</p>
<p>For the Federal Reserve, operating without much public disclosure or accountability has long been standard operating procedure. But as the Fed begins leveraging the $454 billion bailout fund in the CARES Act into as much as $4.5 trillion in lending, Americans need more transparency.</p>
<p>In particular, we need to know which corporations are benefiting from the Fed buying their debt. That transparency is essential if we want to keep the biggest bailout in U.S. history from becoming a special interest free-for-fall. It’s also essential now that the Fed is purchasing riskier forms of debt, including junk bonds that were excluded from past bailouts.</p>
<p>In these unprecedented times, a spreadsheet on a bureaucrat&rsquo;s computer is not enough to satisfy the public’s need to know. Americans must demand that all money lent and spent be disclosed online. The Federal Reserve must divulge the names of companies receiving assistance and the terms of those deals, and post that information online in a timely way for all to see.</p>
<p>It’s crucial that citizens, watchdogs and elected officials know how these historic sums of money are used. The biggest bailout in U.S. history deserves the most transparency in U.S. history. Nothing could be clearer than that.”
