A LETTER TO DARE COUNTY COMMISSIONERS How do we reopen the Outer Banks to tourism so that we maintain our quality of life?</p>
<p>By Submitted Story on April 14, 2020</p>
<p>By John Harris</p>
<p>Dear Commissioners:</p>
<p>Thank you for shouldering the tough jobs that you have. I appreciate the sacrifice that you make for the community every day. Our business is struggling like every other business on the Outer Banks. We have furloughed almost 90% of our employees. If we’re fortunate enough to receive the PPP loans, those funds can cover only part of our expenses for a limited time; they do not make us whole.</p>
<p>Outer Banks businesses need to open back up at the earliest feasible time and do what business they can. They will still need assistance but at least it will give them a shot at surviving.</p>
<p>So that leads me to the question of how do we open up the Outer Banks to property owners and visitors so we can begin rebuilding our tourism industry, the lifeblood of the Outer Banks?</p>
<p>If I put on my public safety hat only, l don’t see reopening the Outer Banks until the vaccine is available, a year to 18 months from now. If that is the case, I see the tourism industry on the Outer Banks being wiped out. I say that because the health experts talk about the virus continuing in one place or another throughout the summer and fall. As you know, we get visitors from all over the US, so the threat of the virus will continue to exist for the Outer Banks.</p>
<p>If 100% assured public safety is the only question, then we won’t open the Outer Banks until there is a vaccine. But there must be a way to open the Outer Banks to visitors as soon as the Governor lifts the “stay at home” order. We are different than many resort destinations. We are a drive-to destination, low density, and we are accessed by bridges.</p>
<p>So, let’s explore how to use those bridges to proactively let our customers on the Outer Banks. How can we do that?</p>
<p>Could we test visitors at bridges? Check temperature or a COVID-19 test? Could we ask visitors to provide certification from their doctors of tests or other certified testing? Could we set up operating guidelines for restaurants, retail businesses, outdoor businesses, vacation rentals, and other tourism service businesses to minimize the risk of spreading the virus? Possibly the Outer Banks Restaurant Association could develop guidelines for the restaurants. As a retailer, I would copy what Walmart, Dollar Tree and the grocery stores have found to work.</p>
<p>I don’t want Kitty Hawk Kites to die from the “bankruptcy virus,” and I don’t want my beloved Outer Banks to die from the “bankruptcy virus.” The tourism business bankruptcy virus will be followed by the “town and county virus,” which will be followed by the “school and public service virus.” I am so proud of what our community has done for our schools. I don’t want to see us lose ground. I remember what our schools were like in 1974 when I had the opportunity to move here.</p>
<p>I’m almost 73. I am aware that opening the Outer Banks may put people in my age bracket at increased risk. But at this point, I have been educated on how to protect myself. It’s up to me to do that. It is up to the restaurants and businesses to put the best policies and practices in place, so that they can protect their employees and their customers. But let’s open those bridges to a trickle of visitors at least. Let’s make the Outer Banks the haven it was for malaria victims in the 1800’s. It is a haven and a place to heal for everyone. Let’s find a way to let our visitors come here to heal in spirit, while providing a way for our tourism industry to endure. It’s a big challenge to balance public safety and our local economy, but we have to find a way to do it. If we don’t, we will suffer the consequences of a lower quality of life.</p>
<p>John Harris is CEO of Kitty Hawk Kites

<h3 id="collectible-seashells-pile-up-on-outer-banks-during-coronavirus-tourist-ban">Collectible seashells pile up on Outer Banks during coronavirus tourist ban</h3>
<p><img src="https://triblive.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2557706_web1_ptr-OBXshells2-041620.jpg" alt="img">
Seashells don’t normally stand a chance on Outer Banks beaches this time of year. The interesting ones get snatched up by families on spring break and end up as keepsakes or in crafts back home.</p>
<p>This year, the coronavirus pandemic prompted counties along North Carolina’s coast to close their beaches to tourists, and the seashells have been left to pile up.</p>
<p>Cape Lookout National Seashore on Monday shared a “postcard from the beach” video on Facebook showing a deep layer of shells washed up on the sand.</p>
<p>The video had been viewed more than 6,300 times by Wednesday afternoon, with many commenters lamenting the missed beachcombing opportunities.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe all those shells!!!! I need to come and pick them up,” wrote Laura Dixon.</p>
<p>Cape Lookout National Seashore via Facebook</p>
<p>“Thank you!!!! You’ve made my day!!! Day 22 of self-isolation in my home in Ohio. 46 degrees and gray,” wrote Leanna Colarich. “I cannot wait to get back to Shackleford and the Cape Lookout National Seashore.”</p>
<p>The video clip wasn’t enough for Jeremy and Cynthia Thompson.</p>
<p>“We need a live web cam so we can enjoy this all the time,” the Thompsons posted.</p>
<p>Marla Brown might have preferred to not see the video.</p>
<p>“OH! The wind, the waves, BUT………THE SHELLS!!!!!” Brown wrote. “That was just plain MEAN to tease us with THE SHELLS!!! When we can do NOTHING about them.”</p>
<p>The Outer Banks have some of America’s best beaches for shell collecting, reports the Charlotte Observer, including some prehistoric fossil shells.</p>
<p>The beaches at Cape Lookout and Cape Hatteras national seashores remain open, according to The News &amp; Observer, but park facilities are closed, including cabins, camps and restrooms.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.graytvinc.com/images/Outer+Banks+OBX+Cape+Hatteras.jpg" alt="img">
The lack of tourists on the Outer Banks during the coronavirus pandemic has been creating large piles of uncollected seashells.</p>
<p>A Facebook video posted Monday by the Cape Lookout National Seashore shows a multitude of colorful shells spread out across the beach as waves splash over them.</p>
<p>The Charlotte Observer reports that while park facilities are closed, both Cape Lookout and Cape Hatteras national seashores in the Outer Banks are open to residents.</p>
<p>The shells remain uncollected since visitors tend to gather them during the springtime.</p>
