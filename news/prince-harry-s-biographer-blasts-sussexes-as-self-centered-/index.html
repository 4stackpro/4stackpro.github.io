<p>Prince Harry’s biographer has blasted him and wife Meghan Markle as spoiled brats.</p>
<p>Writing in a new piece for Tatler magazine, Angela Levin — who spent over a year accompanying the royal on his engagements — describes Harry as once being “charismatic, intuitive and quick-witted but also restless and trouble.”</p>
<p>Levin now categorizes the behavior of the Sussexes as “increasingly self-centered,” with their recent decision to decamp to Los Angeles as proof. “Their choice of priorities smacks more of spoilt defiant teenagers than adults in their mid and late-thirties,” says Levin. “I see a Harry who has turned sour, callous even and is obviously stressed.”</p>
<p>Levin says that when Harry and the “Suits” actress were newly engaged, he assured his biographer that he had been honest in describing the realities of being a working member of the royal family. He needed Markle to know what was in store for her and how different it would be from her previous life.</p>
<p>Sadly, less than two years later the couple has quit the royal family and fled the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The biographer who, during the course of her time with the former royal had plenty of one-on-one time, believes that Harry must be devastated about leaving his family and close military ties.</p>
<p>Levin also revealed that 36-year-old duke confessed to her that he had failed to look after his mother, the late Princess Diana, who tragically died in a car accident in 1997.</p>
<p>“(He) also told me he felt he hadn’t done enough to protect his mother,” Levin writes, “something no 12-year-old could manage. He’s wanted to make amends and now focuses on protecting Meghan, making her happy…Yet his anguished expression at many engagements over the last year highlights his concern that he is not doing enough.”</p>
<p>Levin writes that Meghan has opted for the celebrity spotlight — something Harry was previously disinterested in — telling the biographer that he and older brother Prince William didn’t want to just be famous, “but instead use our role for good.”</p>
<p>Levin ends her piece by begging the royal to return to England during these dark days and worries that, “one day he needs to ask himself if his wife could ever be happy or if she’s someone who always wants more.”

<h3 id="have-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-hired-brad-pitt-and-angelina-jolies-former-bodyguard">Have Prince Harry and Meghan Markle hired Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie&rsquo;s former bodyguard?</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/03/31/22/26651588-0-image-a-66_1585689288672.jpg" alt="img">
Harry and Meghan are reportedly hiring former SAS soldiers to replace their Scotland Yard bodyguards.</p>
<p>They apparently chose from a shortlist of two firms whose staff have guarded stars including Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, Nicole Kidman, Madonna and the Ecclestone family.</p>
<p>From tomorrow, the Sussexes will no longer be working members of the Royal Family as they pursue new lives and careers in US with their ten-month-old son Archie.</p>
<p>Harry and Meghan are reportedly hiring former SAS soldiers to replace their Scotland Yard bodyguards</p>
<p>As the Daily Mail revealed this week, they have agreed to meet the bill for their own security in America. Harry and Meghan had found themselves at the centre of a row over the cost to British taxpayers of providing them with round-the-clock protection by the Metropolitan Police during their new life in California.</p>
<p>The row deepened after President Donald Trump said Americans should not be asked to contribute. The couple have decided to hire a private security team charging around £400 a day per guard, the Sun reported yesterday.</p>
<p>Experts say their annual bill could be up to £4million as they will require the use of several bodyguards a day. While a spokesman for the couple insisted they would meet the bill personally, Prince Charles may also contribute.</p>

<p>Harry and Meghan are pursueing new lives and careers in US with their ten-month-old son Archie</p>
<p>He has agreed to make a substantial contribution towards his son and daughter-in-law’s living costs for the next 12 months while they ‘get on their feet’.</p>
<p>Sources have warned that the money, which will come from his personal funds and not the Duchy of Cornwall, is not ‘inexhaustible’ and will be reviewed in a year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Royal Family are determined to put the Megxit saga behind them, the Daily Mail can reveal. While there is still sadness – and hurt – over Harry and Meghan’s decision to step down as working royals and live abroad, the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and other senior figures believe there is no more they can do to bridge the divide.</p>
<p>‘Harry and Meghan have made their decision and it is clear they have moved on, which is what everyone else is now trying to do,’ well-placed sources said. ‘There is a lot of work to do, especially given the health crisis currently faced by this country.’

<p>Britain’s Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, have no plans to ask the U.S. government for help with security costs, the couple said in a statement on Sunday in response to a tweet from U.S. President Donald Trump that the United States would not pay for their protection.</p>
<p>In January, the couple said they would step away from their royal duties and according to media reports, recently relocated to Los Angeles. Earlier on Sunday, Trump tweeted: “Now they have left Canada for the U.S. however, the U.S. will not pay for their security protection. They must pay!”</p>
<p>I am a great friend and admirer of the Queen &amp; the United Kingdom. It was reported that Harry and Meghan, who left the Kingdom, would reside permanently in Canada. Now they have left Canada for the U.S. however, the U.S. will not pay for their security protection. They must pay! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2020</p>

<p>A spokeswoman for the couple said later in a statement: “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have no plans to ask the U.S. government for security resources. Privately funded security arrangements have been made.”</p>
<p>The duchess, Meghan Markle, who married Prince Harry, the grandson of Britain’s Queen Elizabeth, in 2018, criticized Trump during his 2016 election campaign as misogynistic and divisive.</p>
<p>Last year, Trump, on being told of Meghan’s criticism, said: “I didn’t know that. What can I say? I didn’t know that she was nasty.” But he also wished her well in her new life as a British royal.</p>

<p>The couple stunned the royal family in early January with an announcement they would be stepping down from their roles as senior royals, in order to gain freedom from the intense media scrutiny that has followed them for several years.</p>
<p>They had been living for several months with their son, Archie, on Vancouver Island in Canada.</p>
<p>Britain’s Sun newspaper reported last week that the couple took a private flight to Los Angeles, but did not say when. Earlier this month, the United States and Canada agreed to close their border to non-essential travel at land crossings to ease the strain on health systems caused by the coronavirus.</p>

<p>Meghan Markle was raised in the Los Angeles area and her mother, Doria, still lives there. Walt Disney Co said last week that Meghan had narrated a nature documentary that will be released on its Disney+ streaming platform on Friday.</p>
<p>Last month, Canada said it would no longer provide security once the couple were no longer working members of the British royal family.</p>
<p>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police had been assisting London’s Metropolitan Police with security for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex “intermittently” since November, when the couple began a six-week vacation in Canada, Reuters reported in February.</p>
