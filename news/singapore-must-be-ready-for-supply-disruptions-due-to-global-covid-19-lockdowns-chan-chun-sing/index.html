SINGAPORE: Singapore needs to plan and be ready for more disruptions to its supply of food and other essentials, as lockdowns continue in exporting countries, said Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing.</p>
<p>Speaking in Parliament on Monday (Apr 6), Mr Chan noted COVID-19 has “severely diminished global production capacities and disrupted global supply chains” as countries worldwide restrict movement as well as close factories and other businesses.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Air travel restrictions have considerably diminished global air cargo capacity and connectivity, while seaport capacities are increasingly being put under stress, he said.</p>
<p>Mr Chan said Singapore has a multi-pronged strategy to deal with this “unprecedented disruption” to global supply chains, with the country’s approach to ensuring its food supply including a combination of stockpiling, import diversification and local production.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“The size of our stockpile is determined by a range of factors such as our consumption rate, the supply chain reliability, resupply rate and frequency, shelf life of the products and the cost of storage, the duration of possible disruptions and our local production surge capacities,” he said.</p>
<p>Maintaining the country’s stockpile of different items is a “dynamic task that requires constant watch over the fluid global supply landscape”, said Mr Chan, in response to a question from Tampines GRC MP Cheng Li Hui.</p>
<p>“Beyond the factors mentioned, we must also watch the rising protectionist measures by countries to secure their own supplies which compound the global supply chain disruptions,” he said.</p>
<p>Panic buying would also distort Singapore’s consumption rates and thus planning assumptions, he added.</p>
<p>Ongoing lockdowns in exporting countries would put the ability of these countries to produce and export under “increasing strain”, noted Mr Chan.</p>
<p>“For instance, while the Government has worked with Malaysia to ensure that goods, especially food and essentials, continue to flow between our countries following the implementation of Malaysia’s Movement Control Order, we cannot be certain how long this will last as the global COVID-19 outbreak continues to escalate,” he said.</p>
<p>“But we must certainly plan and be ready for further disruptions.”</p>
<p>Singapore is working with “like-minded partners” to ensure trade continues to flow, and air and seaports remain open to support global supply chains globally, said Mr Chan.</p>
<p>He pointed to recent developments such as a recent agreement with countries such as Australia, Brunei and Canada to ensuring supply chain connectivity, noting also that Singapore’s trading lines with other countries such as China and South Korea remained open.</p>
<p>At a G20 trade ministers meeting last week, participants agreed the world must work together to “maintain global productions systems and trade links, thereby engendering long term confidence in investors, businesses and consumers”, said Mr Chan.</p>
<p>“The outbreak will weigh significantly on global growth, with several major economies expected to go into recession this year. Singapore is unlikely to be an exception,” said Mr Chan.</p>
<p>“The sharp fall in external demand, along with the plunge in tourist arrivals and cutback in domestic consumption is expected to severely affect the economy,” he added.</p>
<p>Ms Cheng also asked about reports that suggested certain countries were trying to “hijack” the production of goods such as N95 masks, and what was being done to secure personal protective equipment for healthcare workers here.</p>
<p>Mr Chan’s response was that it was to the benefit of all countries that they work together to keep supply chains open, and that countries keeping their production lines only for themselves would reduce the global capacity of goods, noting few countries produced all of their goods by themselves.</p>
<p>On how the cost of goods could be kept stable during this time, Mr Chan said Singapore would have to continue to diversify its sources, so that it is not held ransom by any particular source, adding this would need to be done even outside of times of crisis.</p>
<p>Ms Cheng also asked how the “circuit breaker” measures being put into place in Singapore to curb the spread of COVID-19 - such as shutting down workplaces and attraction - would impact the economy.</p>
<p>Mr Chan said while these measures would have a “very serious impact” on the economy, it was necessary to understand why they were needed.</p>
<p>“If we all remain united, if we all take the measures seriously, and if we are successful in controlling the spread in the next one month, then we will be able to progressively resume normalcy.”</p>
<p>Not taking such measures seriously could make the outbreak worse, and require the “circuit breaker” period to be extended, inflicting further damage on the economy, said Mr Chan.</p>

<h3 id="chan-chun-sing-says-theres-no-need-to-rush-to-supermarkets-please-purchase-responsibly">Chan Chun Sing says there&rsquo;s no need to rush to supermarkets: &lsquo;Please purchase responsibly&rsquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.mothership.sg/1/2020/04/CCS-supermarket.jpg" alt="img">
There is no need to rush to supermarkets to stock up as this will &ldquo;only cause disruption to our logistics system&rdquo;, Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chung Sing announced on Apr. 3 at a press conference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please purchase responsibly&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chan urged Singaporeans to &ldquo;please purchase responsibly,&rdquo; and called for people to consider the &ldquo;more vulnerable amongst us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Singaporeans may continue to purchase essentials and groceries as usual during this period, he said. Supermarkets will also continue to operate at their usual hours.</p>
<p>He further stated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t run on the supermarkets, we will be able to get our supplies as per normal, and the stock and the shelves will be progressively restocked as usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is due to Singapore having intact supply lines and supply chains.</p>
<p>Supermarkets, wet markets, and hawker centres will remain open</p>
<p>Apart from supermarkets, wet markets, hawker centres and food establishments will also remain open.</p>
<p>The main difference is that food establishments will no longer have the option to dine-in, while takeaways and food delivery services will continue.</p>
<p>This is part of a wider range of essential services that Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said will continue to operate, amidst the closure of most workplaces beginning from Apr. 7.</p>
<p>What are some of the other essential services?</p>
<p>Apart from food related services, the other services Chan listed out were:</p>
<p>All healthcare and social services,</p>
<p>Energy,</p>
<p>Water and waste management, and environmental services,</p>
<p>All transportation, storage and logistics services,</p>
<p>All information and communication services,</p>
<p>All security operations,</p>
<p>All facilities management, and critical public infrastructure,</p>
<p>Manufacturing activities that are essential to Singapore&rsquo;s security and safety, and</p>
<p>All banking and financial services.</p>
<p>Chan also acknowledged that some other services such as hardware stores for repairs, pet supplies, and vehicle recovery will also be allowed to continue operations, albeit with core essential staff and the expectation to comply to strict safe distancing measures.</p>
<p>Chan then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the related supply chains to keep the essential services functioning will also be allowed to continue. Our agencies will proactively inform the firms that provide essential services, if they have not already done so.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="reusable-masks-will-not-be-mailed-as-not-all-households-want-them-chan-chun-sing">Reusable masks will not be mailed as not all households want them: Chan Chun Sing</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.mothership.sg/1/2020/04/reusable-masks-.jpg" alt="img">
The reusable masks allocated to each household will not be sent via post, in order to prevent wastage, according to Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing.</p>
<p>This is in line with a previous explanation given by Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong, when the Singapore government previously distributed surgical masks to households in February.</p>
<p>In a Facebook post on Apr. 4, Chan emphasised that several measures will be put in place for households to collect their masks safely from collection centres.</p>
<p>This includes implementing priority queues for seniors and spacing out collection times.</p>
<p>30 per cent of households did not collect masks, or think they needed the masks during last exercise</p>
<p>Chan explained that although the government has considered sending the masks via post, they have declined to do so for several reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, not all households may need or want the masks, so posting masks to every household will be a huge waste of resources.</p>
<p>He cited the fact that during the previous surgical mask collection exercise, more than 30 per cent of households did not collect them, or think that they needed the masks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would mean wasting more than a million precious masks,&rdquo; said Chan.</p>
<p>He also said that packing the masks according to the number of people staying in each household is a time and manpower-intensive task, and that if the government sends an individually packed mask to each individual, it would take much more effort and time.</p>
<p>Chan also said that based on past experiences, many disputes and uncertainties will occur over whether individuals in particular households actually received their items.</p>
<p>Priority queues for seniors</p>
<p>According to Chan, the government would adopt several measures to minimise the rush and queues at mask collection centres.</p>
<p>Collection times would be spaced out by blocks and precincts, in order to minimise queues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our recent experience validated our ability to complete each transaction within a few minutes,&rdquo; said Chan.</p>
<p>Priority queues would also be set up for seniors and those who may need assistance.</p>
<p>Welcomed residents to volunteer to distribute masks</p>
<p>The government would also have as many collection counters as possible, depending on the number of local volunteers.</p>
<p>In his post, Chan welcomed residents to volunteer at their local Residents&rsquo; Committees (RCs) and Community Clubs (CCs).</p>
<p>Chan also said that the government has simplified the process of collection, in order to minimise the time needed per transaction.</p>
<p>He said that residents can help by collating their family identification cards and collecting as a family, rather than turning up individually.</p>
<p>Chan also clarified that domestic helpers would also receive the reusable masks, if they are staying in Singapore with a residential address.</p>
<p>The reusable mask collection exercise will commence from Sunday, Apr. 5, until the following Sunday, Apr. 12.</p>
