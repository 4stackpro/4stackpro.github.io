<p>Its better to real than to be perfect - Michelle</p>
<p>Marini Natural&rsquo;s CEO Michelle Ntalami also came to her defense shaming those who trolled her. Ms Ntalami revealed that Betty didn&rsquo;t have to live to their expectation just because she was their role model.</p>
<p>She encouraged them to pick the good from her and leave out the bad adding that no one was perfect and it was better to be real than perfect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been seeing a lot of flake lately towards my girl. To those trolling and bashing her for her very candid video, you choosing someone to be your role model does not entail them living their life according to your expectations. Pick what you love about them and leave out what you don’t. The same goes for me. Its better to real than to be perfect, and that’s exactly what B is. That said, drink on me after Rona keep queening my ladies I got you&rdquo; said the CEO.</p>

Ivanna I’m her role model.

<p>Former Starehe Constituency Hopeful Boniface Mwangi also joined the conversation stating that the TV girl owns no one an apology for having a good time and enjoying her life.</p>
<p>“Betty Kyalo owes no one an apology for having a good time and enjoying her life. Stop projecting your hypocrisy on someone who owes you nothing.

<p>Betty Kyallo the Brand</p>
<p>“Forget about BETTY KYALO THE BRAND &amp; focus on the little girl in her , this is one of the amazing single mothers that I love appreciate and adore, Betty is in her early 30s,and despite all the judgments ,social media critics, honorable of justice Wannabees of Mr / Mrs Know All , this girl has done quite alot for herself at her age 💪, some of you screaming and making noise are already in your 40s with not even a name, a brand or a business ,forget about a family 💪. Early Last year, she had her child in hospital for over months 🙆‍♂️🙆‍♂️, but she was constantly on TV and still moving around with a strong face, not knowing she had fire burning in her” reads part of Akothee’s post.</p>
<p>The Abebo hit-maker also disclosed that Betty’s Mother got an accident at a time she was taking care of her granddaughter and ended up being admitted, making it hard for Betty to balance between work and taking care of sick family members.</p>
