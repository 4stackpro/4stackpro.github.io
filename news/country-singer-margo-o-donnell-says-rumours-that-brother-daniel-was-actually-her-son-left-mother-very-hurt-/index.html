MARGO O’Donnell has revealed how rumours that her brother Daniel was actually her son left her mother very “hurt”.</p>
<p>The country singer, 68, told how the showbiz pair were never bothered by the absurd tittle-tattle — but their mam Julia took it to heart.</p>

<p>3 Margo says rumours that Daniel was her son hurt mum Julia</p>
<p>3 In her 55-year career, Margo has sold over a million records and sang with Dolly Parton and Johnny Cash</p>
<p>Legendary songstress Margo, appears in RTE’s Keys to My Life this week, which sees her take a trip down memory lane, visiting homes she lived in throughout her life.</p>
<p>Her famous brother Daniel makes a surprise visit to the home they shared in Ballinteer, Dublin, in the late 1970s and early 1980s.</p>
<p>And Margo revealed how the pair struggled with rumours about their relationship.</p>
<p>She said: “They were saying things about me being Daniel’s mother. I would have been ten when I had him!”</p>
<p>Daniel laughed: “We’d have been in the circus, the two of us then.”</p>
<p>Margo added: “It didn’t hurt us but it did hurt Mam.”</p>
<p>BOOZE BATTLE</p>
<p>Margo also opens up about her struggles with booze and prescription drugs, telling how she began self-medicating to deal with stage fright.</p>
<p>She said: “I started drinking in 1974 and, from the very first drink, I was an alcoholic.</p>
<p>“I had a fear of the stage and I thought I’d found my crutch. There was always a reason for lifting the glass until there was no reason and it was either the glass or me.”</p>
<p>Daniel told how he did his best to intervene — but admitted helping a loved one deal with addiction is difficult.</p>
<p>He said: “I suppose we were always aware. You think, ‘Oh, if I hide this or if we don’t go there’ . . . it’s not like that.”</p>
<p>Keys to my Life looks back at Margo’s career, which began when she was just 13 in a showband.</p>
<p>The singer took to the road soon after the death of her beloved dad Francie, as she was determined to fulfil a promise to him to provide for her mother and siblings.</p>
<p>LOOKING BACK</p>
<p>In her 55-year career, she’s sold over a million records and sang with Dolly Parton and Johnny Cash.</p>
<p>But she revealed how her career was never what she wanted — but something she did out of duty to her family after Francie’s death at the age of just 49.</p>
<p>She said of her dad’s sudden death: “He wasn’t ill. One particular evening he said, ‘Margaret, I’m tired. I want you to promise me you’ll look after Mam and the wee ones’.</p>
<p>“That was the day my life changed forever. It was then I first walked out the door and got in the van with the Keynotes (band) when I was just 13. This is where Margo started.</p>
<p>“I didn’t like to be in the limelight and I didn’t like show business at all. That’s the role that we decided I would go. I didn’t have a choice. £100 a week was a lot of money. If my father had lived, I wouldn’t have done this.</p>
<p>“My dream was always marriage and settling down and kids and a nice home. That was my dream.”</p>
<p>And she told how her descent into alcoholism was spurred by the fact that she hated what she was doing for a living.</p>
<p>She said of her booze battle: “It was very dark. It was a lonely, stupid period. I was blaming Dad for having left me. Because I promise my father that day he died I’d look after my mother and my siblings.</p>
<p>“I destroyed myself by trying to carry that promise.”</p>
<p>FEARS FOR DAN</p>
<p>Margo also opened up about how she worried for her younger brother when he decided to become a musician like her.</p>
<p>She said: “I was afraid for Daniel coming into the music business. But shortly after he came with me, I could see people were coming to hear him.”</p>
<p>Daniel said of finding success like Margo: “For two people in the one family to be successful singing is like lightning striking twice.”</p>
<p>As well as her struggles with booze, Margo told how she also had to deal with being jilted by her fiance, John, who left her before their intended wedding date in 1979.</p>
<p>She said: “It was a time in my life when I needed to get things together. I had just come out of a broken relationship.</p>
<p>“If I wasn’t so modest, he left me, he jilted me. My pride was hurt. How could this fella do this to me?</p>
<p>“Then the wedding fell through. I was finding a place to find myself. I panic bought this house (in Ballinteer, Dublin).</p>
<p>“I came here and I was broken-hearted — or I thought I was. Another monkey had let me down.”</p>

<h3 id="ron-white-asks-judge-to-terminate-25k-a-month-spousal-support-to-ex-margo-rey">Ron White asks judge to terminate $25k a month spousal support to ex Margo Rey</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/26/17/27673964-0-image-a-10_1587917393006.jpg" alt="img">
Comedian Ron White is feeling the pinch amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The 63-year-old Texas born funnyman is asking a judge to stop his spousal support obligations to ex-wife Margo Rey, who he split from in 2017.</p>
<p>Ron has been paying $25,000 a month to singer Margo since November 2019 but says his income has been drastically reduced due to gigs being cancelled amid the global health crisis.</p>
<p>Comedian Ron White is asking to stop his spousal support payments to ex Margo Rey as he claims his income has been drastically reduced amid the coronavirus pandemic</p>
<p>In court documents obtained by TMZ, Ron explains &lsquo;&hellip; she continued her decades-long pursuit of being a professional singer at which she is not self-supporting. I have spent 200+ days per year traveling the country every year to do stand-up shows, and I made more than $200,000 per month doing it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now I cannot work. I have a tenth-grade education. I am 63. Margo still insists I pay her $25,000 per month. I have employees depending on me for wages and benefits. I do not even have $25,000 per month of income.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The standup comedian provided a breakdown of his income and expenses which reveals his net income is just over $300,000 with expenses totaling more than $433,000. He claims his income since the pandemic is now zero.</p>
<p>Nasty split: The former couple married in 2013 and split in 2017, with Margo claiming the comedian left her high and dry while she was in remission from cancer</p>
<p>Ron is asking the judge to terminate his spousal support obligations.</p>
<p>The former couple married in 2013 and split four years later, with Margo claiming the comedian left her penniless after she overcame cancer.</p>
<p>In court documents at the time the 53-year-old said Ron ended their relationship and canceled her credit cards with no warning. He also allegedly changed the locks to the home they were renovating.</p>
<p>The songstress said she discovered Ron had cut her off when she was attempting to pay for medical bills connected to her cancer treatment.</p>
<p>Quarantine chill: The 53-year-old singer is seen in a recent Instagram snap</p>
<p>She requested spousal support claiming that Ron&rsquo;s team cancelled 30 of her gigs - booked alongside Ron&rsquo;s - with no warning, leaving her without income.</p>
<p>During their divorce battle Ron claimed he wasn&rsquo;t officially married to Margo because she refused to sign a prenup. But the wedding went ahead anyway with Ron shelling out $100,000 for the big day.</p>
<p>He tried to get the divorce thrown out and called their October 2013 Texas wedding a &lsquo;mock marriage ceremony&rsquo; which Margo knew wasn&rsquo;t real.</p>
<p>Last year an L.A. Superior Court judge sided with Margo and declared the couple was in a common-law marriage under Texas law and had also lived together in California as husband and wife.

<p>Maqta Gateway, the digital arm of Abu Dhabi Ports, has expanded its digital logistics solution, Margo, with the addition of a new commercial offering for warehouse storage.</p>
<p>The new offering presents customers with the unique opportunity to book standard warehouses or specialised temperature controlled-storage facilities to safely store their perishable goods including food Items and medical supplies for short and medium periods of time, through simplified paper-free booking processing and remotely-managed reservations.

<p>Dr. Noura Al Dhaheri, CEO of Maqta Gateway and Head of Digitalisation Cluster at Abu Dhabi Ports, said: “We are pleased to bolster the capabilities of our highly-acclaimed Margo platform, through providing innovative solutions for customers in search of a short and medium-term storage for their goods., through a streamlined digital service that is user friendly, efficient and cost effective.”</p>
<p>“In recognition of the collective efforts to combat the COVID-19 and considering that storage of food and medical supplies are of highest priority in these pressing times, I am pleased to announce that we will be waiving Margo Warehouse’s processing fees in the interim period for such facilities following its launch.”</p>
