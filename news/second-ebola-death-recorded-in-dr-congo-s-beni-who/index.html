The Democratic Republic of the Congo has recorded a second Ebola death in days following more than seven weeks without a new case, the World Health Organization (WHO) said.</p>
<p>The DRC had been set on Sunday to mark an end to the second-deadliest outbreak of the virus on record, until a case was confirmed on Friday in the eastern city of Beni.</p>
<p>More:</p>
<p>The outbreak has killed more than 2,200 people since August 2018 in an area of the country where violence by armed groups hobbled efforts to contain it.</p>
<p>The latest victim was an 11-month-old girl, who was treated at the same health centre as the previous case, a 26-year-old electrician, said Boubacar Diallo, deputy incident manager for the WHO&rsquo;s Ebola response.</p>
<p>Officials say it is not yet clear how the electrician contracted Ebola. He had no known contacts with other Ebola patients and was not a survivor of the virus who could have relapsed, the government said on Friday.</p>
<p>Flare-ups or one-off transmissions are common towards the end of Ebola outbreaks, and a new case does not necessarily mean the virus will spread out of control again.</p>
<p>Ebola causes fever, bleeding, vomiting and diarrhoea and spreads among humans through bodily fluids. During this outbreak, it killed about two-thirds of those it infected.</p>
<p>The WHO has identified 215 people who came into contact with the electrician, including 53 health workers at three facilities the man visited before he died, Diallo said.</p>
<p>All but one of the health workers had already been vaccinated, he said.</p>
<p>Two new vaccines have helped contain the virus, though public mistrust and rebel attacks prevented health workers from reaching some hard-hit areas.</p>
<p>On Saturday, a group of angry young men threw stones at a team of WHO workers and Beni&rsquo;s deputy mayor as they attempted to decontaminate the electrician&rsquo;s home and trace his contacts, Diallo said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For them, Ebola is over,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;People here have some problems understanding how this case just came two days before the declaration of the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deputy mayor was forced to abandon his car and escape by motorbike taxi, said Kambale Sabuni, head of the police in Beni.

What An ER Nurse Learned From Ebola Outbreak And Now COVID-19 An American nurse who worked during Africa&rsquo;s Ebola outbreak compares that experience to treating coronavirus patients in a U.S. ER. One difference: she had better protective gear in the Ebola clinic.

<h3 id="new-ebola-case-in-dr-congo-sets-back-hoped-for-end-to-epidemic">New Ebola Case in DR Congo Sets Back Hoped for End to Epidemic</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.voltron.voanews.com/Drupal/01live-166/2019-09/ap_ebola.jpg" alt="img">
GENEVA - The World Health Organization says it remains committed to ending the Ebola outbreak in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo following discovery of a new case of the disease days before DRC authorities had hoped to declare the epidemic over. An Ebola epidemic is declared over after two incubation periods or 42 days have passed without a confirmed case of the disease.</p>
<p>After 52 days without a case of Ebola, a 26-year-old man died of the disease in the city of Beni. WHO Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says this is not welcome news, but adds it was not unexpected.</p>
<p>“We have been preparing for, and expecting, more cases. Unfortunately, this means the government of DRC will not be able to declare an end to the outbreak on Monday, as hoped. But WHO and all partners remain on the ground and committed as ever to working with the government, under the leadership of the government and with affected communities and other partners to end the outbreak,” he said.</p>
<p>WHO reports 3,456 cases of Ebola, including 2,276 deaths since the outbreak was declared August 1, 2018. This is the second-worst outbreak, after the historic 2014 epidemic in West Africa, which infected more than 28,000 people, killing 11,300.</p>
<p>The head of WHO’s health emergency committee, Michael Ryan, says the positive news to emerge from this setback is that the international operation tracking the Ebola epidemic was on the alert and responded quickly.</p>
<p>“Every day, we investigate 2,600 alerts across the two affected provinces still. We take thousands of samples every single week and we will continue that active surveillance right the way through. We will just have to go again for another 42 days,” said Ryan.</p>
<p>WHO reports efforts are underway to find everyone who may have been in contact with the infected person. It says everyone will be offered the protective vaccine and their health status will be monitored.</p>
<p>It says the international response team will continue to trace and track every case in North Kivu and Ituri provinces until this epidemic is brought to an end.</p>
