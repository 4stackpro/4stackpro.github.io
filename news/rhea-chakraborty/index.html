“It is Parveen Babi all over again,” Mahesh Bhatt had said about Sushant Singh Rajput’s rapidly deteriorating mental condition. He advised Sushant’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty to leave.</p>
<p>These are some of the revelations on Sushant Singh Rajput’s suicide made by writer Suhrita Sengupta, a close associate of filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt in whose company Suhrita met Sushant for the last time.</p>
<p>“Sushant had come to meet Bhatt Saab for a possible role in Sadak 2. They hit it off instantly, Sushant was a talker. He held forth on every topic under the sun. Sushant could speak on Quantam physics as well as cinema,” says Suhrita sorrowfully.</p>
<p>Bhatt Saab identified the melancholy under Sushant’s constant exuberance. “He had seen it in Parveen Babi and he knew there was nothing that would be done except medication. Rhea who stuck on in spite of Sushant’s rapid descent into depression tried her best to ensure that Sushant would take his medication. But he refused.”</p>
<p>Without medication Sushant’s depression got worse.</p>
<p>“During the last one year, he had cut himself completely from all outside contact. Rhea was with him until she could take it no longer. There came a time when Sushant began hearing voices. He began to feel people were trying to kill him. One day an Anurag Kashyap film was playing in Sushant’s home and he told Rhea, “I said no to an offer from Kashyap. Now he’s going to come to kill me.’ That’s when Rhea was too frightened to stay with Sushant any longer,” says Suhrita.</p>
<p>Rhea quit the relationship.</p>
<p>“She had no choice. Bhatt Saab told her there was nothing she could do. If she stayed on she would lose her sanity too. Rhea waited for Sushant’s sister to come to Mumbai and take charge. Sushant’s sisters tried their best to support and comfort him. But he was beyond listening to anyone. He wouldn’t take his medication,” confides Suhrita.</p>
<p>In his final months Sushant was locked away in his own mental prison, suffering intensely. Unable to let anyone reach into his dungeon of darkness as he plunged deeper and deeper into it.</p>

Sushant Singh Rajput and Rhea Chakraborty were rumoured to be dating each other for quite some time now. However, neither of them had confirmed or denied their relationship.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput, who had ruled millions of hearts, is no more with us now. The superstar, reportedly, committed suicide in his Bandra apartment. According to the media reports, he was found hanging in his room. The MS Dhoni: The Untold Story actor’s demise has sent a wave of grief and shock across the nation. In fact, the social media sites are inundated with condolence messages from Sushant’s fans and friends. Meanwhile, the Raabta actor’s last picture with his rumoured girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty has been going viral on social media.</p>
<p>To recall, the rumoured couple was clicked together by paparazzi in March this year as they were stepping out of a gym post workout. In the picture, Sushant was seen wearing a navy blue coloured t-shirt with greying brown shorts and black sneakers. The duo was papped as they were walking towards their car and left the gym together. His charming looks and the dapper personality do make it hard for everyone to believe that Sushant Singh Rajput is no more with us now.</p>
<p>Take a look at Sushant Singh Rajput and Rhea Chakraborty’s last pic together:</p>
<p>To note, Rhea and Sushant have been dating each other for quite some time. Although the two didn’t make their relationship official, their frequent appearances and chemistry spoke volumes about their love affair.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, talking about Sushant’s demise, the police has taken the matter in their control and are investigating the case. “Actor Sushant Singh Rajput has died apparently due to hanging but police can tell the exact cause of his death only after receiving post mortem report. So far, we have not found any suspicious object,” DCP Abhishek Trimukhe told ANI.</p>
