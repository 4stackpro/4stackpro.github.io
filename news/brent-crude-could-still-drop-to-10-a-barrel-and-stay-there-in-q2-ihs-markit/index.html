Oil prices on Thursday rallied more than 20% following reports of a possible deal to cut production by an enormous 10 million barrels per day, but one analyst is still predicting that Brent crude will sink to $10 a barrel.</p>
<p>The benchmark Brent crude was trading up 9.92% trading at $32.91 on Friday afternoon in Asia, while West Texas Intermediate gained up 4.82% at $26.54.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are projecting that Brent is going to drop to around $10 a barrel in April and will likely stay at that level in the second quarter,&rdquo; said Victor Shum, vice president of energy consulting at IHS Markit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is little chance of any OPEC+ deal that&rsquo;s going to save the crude oil market from the attack of the COVID-19,&rdquo; he told CNBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Capital Connection&rdquo; on Friday. &ldquo;I think any talk of big cuts is probably too little, too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oil futures have fallen more than 50% since the beginning of the year amid a Saudi-Russia price war and demand destruction because of the coronavirus pandemic.

<h3 id="oil-falls-to-20-on-largest-crude-build-since-2016">Oil Falls To $20 On Largest Crude Build Since 2016</h3>
<p><img src="https://d32r1sh890xpii.cloudfront.net/article/718x300/2020-04-01_p2zhfivtyk.jpg" alt="img">
Amid depressed prices and storage space running low, the Energy Information Administration reported a crude oil inventory build of 13.8 million barrels for the week to March 27.</p>
<p>This compares with a build of 1.6 million barrels for the previous week, which was accompanied by declines in both gasoline and distillate fuel stockpiles.</p>
<p>Last week, gasoline inventories registered a build of 7.5 million barrels, with production averaging 7.5 million bpd. This compares with an inventory decline of 1.5 million barrels for the previous week, which followed another two weeks of consecutive declines to the tune of 11.2 million barrels combined.</p>
<p>In distillate fuels, the EIA reported an inventory decline of 2.2 million barrels, which compared with a reduction of 700,000 barrels a week earlier. In the first two weeks of March, distillate fuel inventories declined by a combined 9.3 million barrels. Production of distillate fuels averaged 5 million bpd last week, which compared with 4.8 million bpd a week earlier.</p>
<p>EIA’s weekly petroleum report, usually closely watched by traders and the industry, has been eclipsed these past two weeks by the spread of the coronavirus, which has crippled global oil demand and the oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia—or, as some see it, between Saudi Arabia and Russia, and U.S. shale—which has led to a steep drop in oil prices.</p>
<p>West Texas Intermediate traded at $20.26 a barrel, with Brent crude at $25.15 a barrel at the time of writing. The benchmarks could fall further if producers fail to curb production as the world’s free storage capacity is already running low in the environment of severely depressed demand—experts estimate it at about 20 million bpd at the height of the Covid-19 crisis—and abundant supply. And while Saudi Arabia seems bent on flooding the market with more oil, Texas producers are considering production cuts.</p>

<h3 id="morgan-stanley-slashes-brent-oil-forecast-to-30">Morgan Stanley Slashes Brent Oil Forecast To $30</h3>
<p><img src="https://d32r1sh890xpii.cloudfront.net/article/718x300/2020-03-17_s2gdqkppr3.jpg" alt="img">
Morgan Stanley further cut its oil price forecast, now expecting Brent crude to average $30 a barrel during the second quarter, from $35 a barrel earlier.</p>
<p>Reuters quoted the investment bank as saying, “Temporary sell-offs to even lower levels are possible, if not likely.”</p>
<p>Barclays also revised its oil price forecast earlier this month. The UK bank now expects Brent to average $43 a barrel in 2020, with West Texas Intermediate at $40. That’s down from an earlier forecast of $59 for Brent and $54 for WTI. Even earlier, Morgan Stanley said it expected Brent crude to average $55 a barrel in the second quarter, down from $57.50 earlier, and WTI to trade at around $50 a barrel, down from $52.50.</p>
<p>For now, Goldman is the most pessimistic. The investment bank said last week we could see Brent fall as low as $20 a barrel if the oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia continues long enough.</p>
<p>It was this war, rather than the prospects of a global recession on the back of the coronavirus outbreak, that &ldquo;completely changes the outlook for oil and gas markets,&rdquo; according to Goldman analyst Daniel Courvalin, as quoted by Business Insider. &ldquo;The prognosis for the oil market is even more dire than in November 2014, when such a price war last started, as it comes to a head with the significant collapse in oil demand due to the coronavirus,&rdquo; Courvalin said.</p>
<p>International agencies are also revising their forecasts, for oil demand this time. The EIA, the IEA, and OPEC all expect demand to take a beating this year, mostly because of the coronavirus, again.</p>
<p>Worse may be yet to come, at least according to Rystad Energy.</p>
<p>“Oil prices have reacted extremely negatively and we believe &hellip; that we have not seen the bottom of the oil price just yet,” the Norwegian consultancy said, as quoted by CNBC. “The potential loss of demand in March-April may dwarf anything the World has ever seen, just when OPEC+ producers open the floodgates of new supply to the market.”</p>
