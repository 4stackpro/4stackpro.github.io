(CNN) Russian President Vladimir Putin knows how to make a very small investment for an outsized public-relations gain, and the Covid-19 pandemic has been no exception.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, a Russian An-124 cargo plane landed at New York&rsquo;s John F. Kennedy Airport carrying a shipment of medical supplies, including ventilators and personal protective equipment, to help US hospitals and communities on the front lines of the fight with coronavirus.</p>
<p>It was a from-Russia-with-love moment: The New York air traffic controller thanked the Russian pilot when the massive aircraft landed, and Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russia&rsquo;s First Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations, tweeted that the shipment was a &ldquo;gesture of solidarity with New Yorkers who are in a very difficult situation at the moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the Russian side offered Washington assistance in light of the epidemiological situation in the US, Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti reported Tuesday. &ldquo;Trump gratefully accepted this humanitarian aid,&rdquo; Peskov said, according to RIA.</p>
<p>At first, it seemed like a typically Putinesque masterstroke of public relations: Russia, once a recipient of US aid after the collapse of the Soviet Union, was now coming to the aid of the world&rsquo;s wealthiest nation. But in a statement, US State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus emphasized that the shipment was a purchase, not a donation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a follow-up to the March 30 phone call between President Trump and President Putin, the United States has agreed to purchase needed medical supplies, including ventilators and personal protection equipment, from Russia, which were handed over to FEMA on April 1 in New York City&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The Kremlin, nonetheless, cast the delivery as a humanitarian act. Russia&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry said Thursday that half of the aid sent to the US against the coronavirus was paid for by American taxpayers, and half by Russian Direct Investment Fund, Russia&rsquo;s sovereign wealth fund.</p>
<p>On the same day the Russian cargo plane landed in New York, the Russian military &ndash; which has tightly scripted the public information around its mission &ndash; released footage of its doctors and chemical/biological/radiological specialists working to sanitize Italian senior care centers using mobile spray disinfection stations and decontamination equipment. They were part of a military mission dispatched earlier by the Russian Ministry of Defense, which sent nine Il-76 aircraft with teams of virologists and epidemiologists to help Italy in its response to the pandemic.</p>
<p>So what, exactly, was Putin&rsquo;s calculation in sending aid abroad, precisely at a moment when coronavirus cases seem to be ramping up in Russia itself?</p>
<p>Russia officially has 3,548 confirmed cases of coronavirus, according to the country&rsquo;s monitoring headquarters. That&rsquo;s a relatively low figure, compared with China or the United States. But Russian authorities have signaled that they expect the situation to worsen: Russians are currently under an enforced regime of self-isolation, and Putin signed a law this week that increases penalties for violating quarantine rules. Authorities in Moscow have said they are preparing to roll out a digital enforcement tool that will use QR codes and a smartphone app to enforce the lockdown in the capital.</p>
<p>The delivery of much-needed equipment to the US, then, has come in for some criticism in Russia, where reports of protective equipment shortages have caused concern.</p>
<p>The Alliance of Doctors, a professional advocacy group, criticized the fanfare around the US shipment. &ldquo;Well, great,&rdquo; the organization said in a statement. &ldquo;We collect money all over the country to buy remedies for doctors, and our authorities sell personal protective equipment in the United States. Pure mockery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a conference call with reporters Thursday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov defended Russia&rsquo;s actions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is always criticism of this nature, but at the same time international cooperation in fighting coronavirus is a very important measure of activities of any country,&rdquo; Peskov said. &ldquo;No country can effectively fight the virus alone without international cooperation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leave aside for a moment the controversy in Russia around the shipment: Internationally, it&rsquo;s a relatively inexpensive way for Putin to build goodwill with President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Russia, after all, remains under US and European sanction over the 2014 annexation of Crimea, and relations between Moscow and Washington are abysmal. For both a Russian and international audience, then, the aid shipments send a powerful visual signal: Putin, once again, is playing the decisive man of action.

<h3 id="trump-tells-cnbc-he-spoke-to-putin-mbs-and-expects-saudis-russia-to-announce-10-million-barrel-cut">Trump tells CNBC he spoke to Putin, MBS and expects Saudis, Russia to announce 10 million barrel cut</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106376297-1580991713358gettyimages-1066780958.jpeg?v=1585838420" alt="img">
President Donald Trump told CNBC on Thursday he expects Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to announce a deal to cut oil production by 10 million to 15 million barrels.</p>
<p>West Texas Intermediate crude surged 24.67% to settle at $25.32 per barrel, for its largest single-day percentage gain in history. Given WTI&rsquo;s 59% decline this year a smaller gain, of course, now accounts for a much larger percentage move. International benchmark Brent jumped 21% to settle at $29.94 per barrel, in what was also its best day on record.</p>
<p>Trump made his comments in a telephone conversation with CNBC&rsquo;s Joe Kernen.</p>
<p>The president said in a tweet later that a production cut would be &ldquo;great for the oil &amp; gas industry,&rdquo; and that the cut could be &ldquo;substantially more&rdquo; than 10 million barrels.</p>
<p>Oil production is typically discussed in terms of barrels per day, but Trump made no reference to the time frame of the cuts. Additionally, it was not clear how the cuts would be distributed across oil-producing countries.</p>
<p>RBC commodity strategist Helima Croft said the U.S. could have to give up something in return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we know is the Saudis were looking at this through the lens of the financial crisis and believe they needed a response commensurate to 08/09,&rdquo; she said, referring to the collapse of prices during the 2008-09 financial crisis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The question is can Trump put together the package that gets them to do that?&rdquo; Croft said. &ldquo;We know there&rsquo;s an emergency OPEC meeting. They will be looking for signs that U.S. production will be curtailed. They will be watching what happens with the Texas Railroad Commission and with Canada,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia on Thursday, via its official press agency, called for an &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; meeting between OPEC and its allies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today, the Kingdom calls for an urgent meeting for OPEC+ group and other countries, with aim of reaching a fair agreement to restore the desired balance of oil markets,&rdquo; the Saudi Press Agency said.

<p>MOSCOW (AP) — President Vladimir Putin on Thursday ordered most Russians to stay off work until the end of the month as part of a partial economic shutdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Speaking in a televised address to the nation, Putin said he was extending the non-working policy he ordered earlier for this week until the end of April. He emphasized that all employees should continue earning their regular salaries during the period.</p>
<p>Putin said some essential industries will keep operating, and grocery stores and pharmacies will remain open.</p>
<p>The president emphasized that Russia’s virus-prevention strategies have bought time and helped slow down the outbreak but also warned that the number of cases will continue climbing.</p>
<p>“The threat remains, and experts believe that the epidemic is yet to reach its peak in the world, including our country,” Putin said.</p>
<p>He noted that that it would be up to regional authorities to decide which companies and organizations could keep working in their areas depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the Russian parliament empowered the cabinet to introduce the state of emergency allowing it to tighten restrictions — an authority that previously had belonged only to the president.</p>
<p>Some Kremlin critics have assailed Putin for stopping short of declaring a nationwide lockdown, opting instead for the vague non-working order.</p>
<p>Many observers pointed out that Putin’s decision to let the cabinet and regional governors decide on specific steps to counter the outbreak reflected an attempt to avoid being associated with unpopular moves and bear responsibility for the mounting number of cases.</p>
<p>Andrei Kolesnikov of the Carnegie Moscow Center interpreted Putin’s moves as an attempt to position himself as a “supreme force presiding over the political system and intervening only in some important situations.”</p>
<p>Putin argued that regional authorities must be given a free hand to handle anti-coronavirus measures because the situation varies widely across the vast country.</p>
<p>“Our country is very big, population density differs widely and there are areas where the coronavirus already is posing a serious threat like in Moscow where we haven’t been able yet to change the situation despite the measures being taken,” Putin said.</p>
<p>Moscow, which has about two-thirds of all known virus cases in Russia, has introduced a strict lockdown. Following Putin’s speech, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended it throughout April but said there was no immediate need to enforce it through electronic surveillance as earlier planned because most residents were dutifully abiding by the restrictions.</p>
<p>Sobyanin said that electronic monitoring will only apply to coronavirus patients undergoing treatment at their homes.</p>
<p>The Russian parliament strengthened punishment for lockdown violations, introducing heavy fines and prison terms of up to seven years in cases when a breach results in deaths.</p>
<p>Most other regions of Russia followed Moscow’s example, but some areas so far unscathed by the epidemic have applied more lax rules.</p>
<p>Russian officials registered 771 new cases on Thursday, bringing the country’s reported total to 3,548 with 30 deaths.</p>
<p>The Russian leader said that along with safeguarding the public’s health, it’s also important to protect people’s incomes and prevent a spike in unemployment.</p>
<p>“An efficient and stable economy is key to solving our tasks, including in the health care system,” he added.</p>
<p>But the opposition said the government has failed to offer a feasible program to support business, warning that Putin’s order would effectively kill most of the nation’s small and medium enterprises and leave many Russians starving.</p>
<p>“The people have no money to just sit at home without working, and employers have no cash,” Russia’s top opposition leader Alexei Navalny tweeted.</p>
<p>There have been broad fears that Russia’s underfunded health care system would be hard-pressed to deal with the outbreak. Medical workers across the country have complained about shortages of essential protective gear and other supplies.</p>
<p>The government has insisted that the country is well prepared and has all the necessary supplies. Moscow has sent teams of military medics to Italy to help counter the outbreak and on Wednesday delivered a planeload of medical supplies to the United States.</p>
<p>The flight follows Monday’s phone call between Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump in which they discussed cooperation to fight the outbreak. Trump hailed Russia’s move as “very nice.”</p>
<p>The Russian Foreign Ministry said the U.S. paid for half of the medical supplies while the other half of the cost was sponsored by Russia’s state investment fund.</p>
<p>Russian officials have angrily dismissed claims that the Kremlin was seeking political gains by providing medical aid to Italy and other countries. In February, Russia provided medical aid to China and later dispatched assistance to Iran, North Korea, Venezuela and various ex-Soviet nations.
