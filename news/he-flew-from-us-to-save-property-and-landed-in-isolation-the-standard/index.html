He flew from US to save property and landed in isolation</p>

<p>The nightmare started when he realised he could lose his inheritance.When Francis Mwai Njoroge learnt that somebody had hived off a portion of his three-and-a-half acre piece of land in Kiarutara, near Thika, he knew it was time to fly back home. And when he disembarked from British Airways Flight 065 at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Nairobi, on March 23, at 9.30pm, he expected to be reunited with his 83-year-old mother in a matter of hours. “When I left Kansas City in the United States of America, I expected to be back in three weeks. My estimation was that this time was sufficient to sort out the land dispute and be back to my work as a cook,” explaines 57-year-old Njoroge. He is now caught up in the pandemic warfare. Even if he was to get a flight back to the US, he would, land in a county which is now the epicentre of the virus. By yesterday, the US had recorded more than 503,177 cases, almost a third of the global 1,710,338 cases, and about 9,000 deaths. “I was thoroughly screened and tested at Kansas. When we reached London, all passengers in the plane were made to sign forms that they would self-quarantine,” Njoroge recalls.</p>

<p>However when the plane touched down at JKIA, he says that the captain announced that the Kenya government had decreed that all passengers would have to be placed in mandatory quarantine. This led to a three-hour hiatus as the passengers haggled and argued with government officials until the about 100 passengers agreed to report to Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC) in Nairobi at 11am the following day. And like a moth fluttering its way to a lamp and to destruction, Njoroge reported to KMTC clad in a T-shirt. He had some cash he hoped would cater for the cost of tests that may be required. “I was shocked to learn that I could not leave the place as I was now under mandatory quarantine. I resisted, insisting that I did not have the money to pay. But I was promised that I would be taken to a government facility where I would not pay anything.” At one point, Njoroge says that he had to plead to be allowed to go to his house in Umoja to pick medicine for high blood pressure.A day after he was moved to Kenya School of Government in Lower Kabete, he called his brother, Patrick Njoroge to bring him a change of clothes, drugs and personal effects. “I have been tested several times. During my stay, four people at the facility who tested positive were whisked to hospital for treatment,” Njoroge says. He lives in a self contained room where he does his laundry and cleans because no other person is authorised to access the facility. “I am supposed to pay Sh28,000 for the 14 days I have spent so far. I am penniless and have to rely on my relatives to send me money even for credit,” Njoroge lamented. And now it appears he might not, after all, even do what brought him here. If he is released today, he will not be able to travel to his home in Murang’a following the restriction of movement into and out of Nairobi. “I had requested permission for three weeks. I was scheduled to return to the US on April 26. This may be a tall order given that Kenya has banned international flights,” Njoroge adds.</p>

Law catches up to police, government officials and MP for flouting curfew rules</p>

<p>More than 12 police officers, a Member of Parliament and a judicial officer are among hundreds of people who have been arrested and detained for flouting curfew regulations since the period started on March 27.Some were caught taking alcohol in houses in groups, others in bars while locked inside and others on roads. Police said some of the victims have already been charged in court for flouting the set rules. At the weekend, an MP in the city was among more than a dozen revelers who were arrested from a bar in Ruai area, Nairobi for flouting the rules. The government banned bars and restaurants from operating for fear of spreading the coronavirus pandemic. Other reports said a judicial officer and a military officer were also detained in Embakasi area for flouting the rules. They were however released after explaining their presence at the premises they were.</p>

<p>Police said they also detained a city musician in Runda area for flouting the rules. He is said to have been hosting a party yesterday morning when police were called and took him to custody and those in attendance. In Embakasi, police said they were called to a private party where 18 people were enjoying and took them to custody. A national administration officer was also arrested for flouting the rules set out. He was in a bar that also had six other revelers when police struck.</p>

<p>Nairobi Police boss Philip Ndolo said they will now be taking those who flout the rules to forced quarantine. “Because they are a danger to the society and they don’t want to adhere to the laid down rules, we may be forced to take some of these people to forced quarantine,” said Ndolo.</p>

<p>He urged the city residents to take seriously the measures put in place to curb the spread of the disease. And at least ten others are under investigations or interdiction for various offences including assault on members of the public as they enforced the curfew. This has put spotlight on the service as authorities struggle to contain some of their rogue behavior that forced president Kenyatta to apologize to the public. Officials say there could be more incidents that have happened, but some senior officers have not reported them as per the law to cover up the same. Most of the officers arrested were found locked in social joints with other revelers in contravention of the law on the curfew.</p>

<p>The latest arrests happened in Makongeni area, Nairobi last week where seven police officers were arrested from a bar that they had locked themselves enjoying drinks. Police said they were among nine people who were nabbed from Maximum Bar in the area following a complaint from the members of the public. In Mwimuto, Nairobi, a police officer was arrested for alleged robbery from a shop in the ongoing curfew. The owner of the shop had locked it and went home only to find some of the equipment missing. Some of the missing items including mobile phones were recovered from the officer before he was arrested. Police authorities said the officer will be charged with burglary. President Uhuru declared a dusk to dawn curfew as part of the measures to stem the spread of the coronavirus in the country. The only persons exempted from the curfew are medical professionals, health workers, critical and essential services providers.</p>

Couple holds 30-minute wedding worth Sh80k with nine guests</p>

<p>For two months, George Lewis Kariuki and his fiancée Rachael Wanjugu have been anxious as they made final plans for their so-to-be ‘big wedding day’.April 25 was the day the lovebirds had scheduled for the event, when they would say ‘Yes I Do’ committing to a lifetime relationship. Most things went down as planned except for the date, the list of guests to witness the exchange of vows and the amount of time they took, thanks to Covid-19 crisis that has disrupted daily life across the world. PCEA Muhito church in Mukurwe-ini, Nyeri County would have been packed to capacity as friends and family witness the vows but only two seats were occupied in the church with guests keeping the one-and–half metre rule.</p>

<p>Kariuki swapped over 500-person park wedding to a nine-person ceremony after a deliberate agreement not to cancel or postpone the event as Covid-19 crisis continue wreak havoc on social activities. The wedding was held on Monday, three weeks before the scheduled date. The family had to forgo a glamorous wedding detail, from an exquisite table setting, floral arrangements, elegantly dressed maids and grooms, for a simple ceremony that lasted 30 minutes. Only nine family members and friends and the officiating priest were allowed. The initial wedding budget stood at Sh1.2 million but they spent Sh80,000 only for a ceremony that took 30 minutes. One item they had to add on their list of must have was bottles of sanitiser for their guests.</p>

<p>“It did not happen as we had wished but we had fun at the church and at the reception party. It was a simple but beautiful ceremony,” said Wanjugu. The State has restricted weddings and funerals to have only 15 people and to take just 30 minutes.</p>

<p>“We could not cancel the wedding because we were on the final stage of arrangements. Bookings for the reception venue had been done, we had already hired a photographer and our guests had invitation cards,” said Kariuki.</p>
