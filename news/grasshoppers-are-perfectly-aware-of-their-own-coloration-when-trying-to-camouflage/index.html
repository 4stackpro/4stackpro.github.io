<p>A research team from the Pablo de Olavide University of Seville, led by Pim Edelaar, from the institution&rsquo;s Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemical Engineering, has carried out an experimental study that shows that grasshoppers are perfectly aware of their own colouration when choosing the place that provides them with better camouflage. The research findings, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, show how organisms are able to adjust their environment, each according to their individual needs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is often said that to survive and reproduce, organisms have to adapt to their environments. However, it is also possible that the organism &lsquo;adapts&rsquo; the environment to itself. As an example we could take ourselves: if it is cold, we turn on the heating &ldquo;, explains Pim Edelaar, who underlines how the study shows that other organisms also have this ability to adjust their environment.</p>
<p>The study &lsquo;Experimental evidence that matching habitat choice drives local adaptation in a wild population&rsquo; focuses on grasshoppers, known for their high degree of camouflage via colours and shapes that can make them almost impossible to detect. &ldquo;One explanation for the observed camouflage could be natural selection, by which the worst camouflaged individuals would be detected and eaten by predators. In this case, the environment would determine which individuals survive and which do not (that is, natural selection operates). In contrast, what this study shows is that the individual can play a determining role in avoiding the operation of natural selection, that is, there is an adjustment in which the individual is the protagonist&rdquo;, argues the researcher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have studied a population of grasshoppers that is adapting to living on abandoned paved streets of very different colours. We have been able to verify that the grasshoppers are aware of their own colour, because they choose the type of substrate most similar to themselves, thus camouflaging themselves better, &ldquo;explains Carlos Camacho, first author of the publication.</p>
<p>To verify this thesis, the researchers changed the colour of the grasshoppers with watercolour paint (something that does not affect them more than in their colour), and then observed that they modified their use of substrate: individuals painted in dark colour moved onto the dark asphalt, and individuals painted in pale colour moved onto the pale-tiled sidewalks. &ldquo;Probably the grasshopper is able to compare the colour of its body with that of the substrate, and subsequently chooses the substrate that contrasts the least,&rdquo; says Adrián Baños, another member of the research team.</p>
<p>It is the first time that it has been demonstrated in such detail that variation between individuals affects their choice of environment. &ldquo;It is logical that this happens, but it is not easy to prove it,&rdquo; recalls Alberto Sanabria, whose Master&rsquo;s thesis was the basis of the article. &ldquo;When I was following the grasshoppers at 40ºC in the Seville summer, I didn&rsquo;t know what we were going to find, but it certainly was worth the effort and the sweat, literally,&rdquo; he adds.</p>
<p>The researchers point out that the variation between individuals is still often ignored in Biology, but that studies like this demonstrate its relevance. &ldquo;It is very easy to ignore the differences between individuals and think about the average, but it is the same as in our society: no one is equal to another and the variation between individuals should not be overlooked&rdquo;, says Pim Edelaar. &ldquo;For example, if a diverse environment becomes a homogeneous environment - for example, due to poor management - a large part of the population would not be comfortable, and could even disappear&rdquo;, he stresses.

<p>Many species have naturally evolved remarkable strategies to visually adapt to their environments for protection and predation. Researchers have studied adaptive camouflaging in the infrared (IR) spectrum, although the method is highly challenging to develop in the lab. In a new report now published on Science Advances, Mingyang Li and a research team at the National University of Defense Technology in China, developed adaptive thermal camouflage devices that bridged the optical and radiative properties of nanoscopic platinum (Pt) and silver (Ag) electro-deposited Pt films. The metal-based devices maintained large, uniform, and consistent IR tunabilities in the mid-wave IR (MWIR) and long-wave IR (LWIR) atmospheric transmission windows (ATWs). The team multiplexed and enlarged the devices, allowing flexibility for camouflaging capabilities. The technology is advantageous across a variety of camouflage platforms and in many thermal radiation management technologies.</p>
<p>Recent years have seen extensive research efforts to control the infrared (IR) features of objects for camouflage in the IR spectrum. To achieve this goal, scientists must precisely control the radiant heat emitted from an object to match the background. Based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the radiant heat of an object is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature and the emittance of the surface. For dynamic control of the temperature or thermal emittance of the object, scientists offer microfluidic networks and thermoelectric systems as possible approaches to maintain adaptive thermal camouflage. Inspired by the multiple optical and radiative properties of metals, Li et al. reported on nanoscopic platinum (Pt) film-based reversible silver (Ag) electrodeposition (RSE) devices for excellent adaptive thermal camouflage capabilities.</p>
<p>Since nanoscopic platinum films have high IR absorption and partial IR transmission, this could be transformed to absorption via the IR-absorbing gel electrolyte layer in the setup. Applying the deposition voltage in the system allowed gradual electrodeposition of silver on the nanoscopic platinum films, gradually converting the IR absorption and transmission to IR reflection to enable low-emittance states from the devices. Nanoscopic Pt films could not be dissolved, therefore, they allowed multiple cycles of Ag deposition and dissolution, in order to switch between high and low-emittance states for many cycles. Li et al. developed diverse devices with multiple structural coatings, rough and flexible substrates to form multiplexed formats to expand the camouflaging scenarios.</p>
<p>Dynamic IR responses of the device. Credit: Science Advances, doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aba3494</p>
<p>To explore the regulation of IR on the metal-based devices, the team first studied the electrical properties of the nanoscopic Pt films. They examined the spectral responses of the film, where increasing the Pt thickness showed huge decreases in IR transmittance to indicate that the IR absorption dominated the spectral response of the thin films. The scientists further examined the potential ranges of IR modulation and the cycling stability of the nanoscopic platinum films in a three-electrode reversible silver electrodeposition (RSE) film. Due to the energy favorable interface between Ag and Pt, the electrodeposited Ag film showed comparatively more uniform, coherent and fine-grained morphologies on the 3 nm Pt film. This feature allowed the scientists to convert the nanoscopic Pt film to a high IR reflective film in a short period of time. The nearly identical potentiostatic cycling curves in the system confirmed their ability to perform stable and reversible electrodeposition on the nanoscopic Pt films.</p>
<p>To assess the IR performance of the assembled devices with varying Pt thicknesses, Li et al. attached them on to a 500C hot plate and recorded their real-time MWIR (mid-wave IR) and LWIR (long-wave IR) images. The team applied a negative voltage of 2.2 V to gradually electrodeposit Ag films on the Pt surface, as the apparent temperature of these devices gradually decreased. When the researchers applied a positive voltage of 0.8 V thereafter, the electrodeposited Ag film could be completely dissolved into the electrolyte, and turned to their initial states to indicate the reversibility of the devices. The device could function steadily for up to 350 fully reversible cycles to confirm their stability and reversibility for adaptive thermal camouflage.</p>

(C and D) Apparent temperature curves (central region) of the assembled devices in the MWIR and LWIR images during the electrodeposition process.

The percentages (3, 15, 43.3, and 38.6%) shown in the figure represent the proportion of radiant energy in the range of 3 to 5 μm (MWIR), 5 to 7.5 μm, 7.5 to 13 μm (LWIR), and 13 to 25 μm, respectively. (J) Real temperature variations of device-3 (in low-emittance state) and a nonspectrally selective low-emittance surface during thermal measurements.

<p>To multiplex and enlarge the device, Li et al. constructed a three-by-three multiplexed IR switchable array and an enlarged independent device. By controlling the combined electrodeposition time of its independent pixels, the scientists generated the letters &ldquo;N&rdquo;, &ldquo;U&rdquo;, &ldquo;D&rdquo;, and &ldquo;T&rdquo; with different temperatures as LWIR images on the array. The work showed the adaptability of the complex background and large-area feasibility of the adaptive systems. The team next expanded the camouflaging scenario of the metal-based dynamic IR modulation mechanism on rough and flexible devices. During the work they replaced polished barium fluoride (BaF 2 ) substrates with rough versions and used polypropylene (PP) films to deposit the nanoscopic Pt films. Due to the micron-scale roughness of BaF 2 and poor wettability of the PP film, the team noted the requirement for thicker Pt films to form physically connected and electrically conductive films. The rough BaF 2 -based device diffusely reflected the outside thermal matrix in the setup and suppressed its own IR radiation to effectively reduce the impact from the external environment. The rough and flexible adaptive variants developed in the work highlighted the multi-substrate compatibility of the metal-based IR modulation mechanism, which expanded the camouflaging scenarios of the device.</p>

<p>Li et al. then combined the devices with structural color coatings to improve their visible compatibility so as to prevent their visible detection in daytime. For this, they used a series of visible-wavelength-scale, thick chromium oxide (Cr 2 O 3 ) layers between the BaF 2 substrate and nanoscopic Pt films. Upon depositing different thicknesses of Cr 2 O 3 layers, due to their thin-film interference effects in the visible spectrum, the &ldquo;decorated&rdquo; devices displayed various colors. The scientists noted the structural colors to shift from relatively dark to more pronounced colors in the setup. The Cr 2 O 3 layers only generated colors in the visible spectrum and therefore exerted little influence on the IR performance of the devices. The results showed the possibility of integrating simple optical designs into the adaptive systems for visible compatibility, making the devices more difficult to detect in the daytime.</p>

<p>In this way, Mingyang Li and colleagues developed adaptive camouflage devices by reversibly depositing silver on nanoscopic platinum films. The devices showed large, uniform, and consistent IR tunabilities in both mid-wave IR and longwave IR atmospheric transmission windows. The scientists easily multiplexed the devices by patterning nanoscopic Pt films or by adding conductive grids for complex background adaptability and large-area flexibility. The team achieved visible compatibility by adding a series of visible-wavelength-scale-thick Cr 2 O 3 layers. The devices developed in this work can inspire the next generation of adaptive thermal camouflage platforms that rapidly and precisely control thermal radiation and camouflage in response to multispectral detection and adaptability to complex environments. These devices will have applications across thermal radiation management techniques including energy efficient buildings, thermoregulation clothes and in smart spacecrafts.</p>

<h3 id="plants-can-camouflage-odors-to-avoid-being-eaten-study">&ldquo;Plants can camouflage odors to avoid being eaten: Study&rdquo;</h3>

Plants in dense tropical forests are able to mask their chemical scents in order to avoid being detected and eaten by insects &ndash; a key advantage in the &ldquo;information arms race&rdquo; between themselves and plant-eating herbivores, according to a new study.</p>
<p>International researchers from Europe and North America examined 28 species of insects and 20 plant species in Chamela-Cuixmala, a tropical forest reserve on the western coast of Mexico.</p>
<p>Their research &ndash; published Thursday in the journal Science &ndash; sheds light on how individual members of &ldquo;complex plant communities&rdquo; evolve to emit similar odors, a pack mentality that keeps them alive and confuses hungry herbivores.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easily distinguished odors are to the herbivores&rsquo; advantage and plants&rsquo; disadvantage,&rdquo; said Professor Phil Stevenson, a researcher at Britain&rsquo;s Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, we have an information arms race. Plants want to avoid being located and eaten so do their best to smell like other plants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thursday&rsquo;s study was the first time scientists were able to analyse the interactions between such a wide variety of plants and insects, lead author Pengjuan Zu at Massachusetts Institute of Technology said.</p>
<p>Previous attempts to understand the cat-and-mouse evolution game between plants and insects relied on the study of only individual plant species in controlled environments.</p>
<p>Read also: ‘Companion plants’ good company for young people living alone</p>
<p>This is a far cry from the ensemble of plant and insect species that coexist in real-life forests, the authors wrote.</p>
<p>To do this, Zu collected chemical odors emitted by nearly two-dozen plant species in silicon tubes, which were then brought back to Kew to be analyzed.</p>
<p>Through a combination of &ldquo;information theory&rdquo; &ndash; a technique for understanding communication patterns in humans &ndash; and existing understandings of evolutionary biology, scientists were able to construct models of these plant-herbivore communication networks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We now know that all the chemicals produced by plants carry information which has an important role in chemically camouflaging plants in a complex plant community,&rdquo; Zu said.</p>
<p>The study could also help scientists better understand how information is passed between different species in the food chain, such as carnivores and insect-eating herbivores &ndash; potentially paving the way for future research.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herbivores, consequently, have to evolve to be finer tuned with the information for locating specific plant hosts,&rdquo; Zu said. &ldquo;The information can be further shared by carnivores that hunt insect herbivores, resulting in an information chain along the food chain.&rdquo;

Dear Editor: For a small percentage of white America, it is better to share their company with a communicable disease than it is to lend support to a culture they do not understand. How else can one explain the fervent gatherings of gun wielding sycophants in front of state capitals when President Trump commands them with the simple phrase “Liberate&rdquo;? They make no effort to defend themselves against the coronavirus as they march in riot gear, holding their semi-automatic weapons and disdaining PPE. These same individuals when they see a group of peaceful protesters, station themselves on either side of the gathering and demonstrate their intolerance with handguns, AR-15s, bats, chainsaws and other weapons. Apparently, they welcome contagion and denigrate social change. It seems obvious to me, they must hate themselves, and project outward their anger and pain and frustration against people they have never met, the way an angry drunken husband kicks the neighbor’s dog. I have an answer for them. As Voltaire so eloquently put it at the end of &ldquo;Candide,&rdquo; — and maybe the Right is correct about this one thing … the answer to their troubles can be summed in one word, “Work!” Send them back to their middle management jobs, their places of actual responsibility. Only let them wear their riot gear, drape themselves in Confederate flags, or go casual in Hawaiian shirts so that we might identify them in “polite” society. Then we can show them with our patronage how much we value their philosophies. Don’t allow them to camouflage themselves in business suits and ties.

<h3 id="2021-vw-golf-variant-throws-away-its-camouflage-as-it-hides-in-plain-sight">&ldquo;2021 VW Golf Variant Throws Away Its Camouflage As It Hides In Plain Sight&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2021-VW-Golf-Variant-spy-shots-0.jpg" alt="img">
The all-new 2021 VW Golf Variant – or Estate, as it’s called on certain markets – hardly wears disguise anymore, though a keen eye for detail will notice something is not right with the taillights.</p>
<p>Volkswagen has applied stickers on the rear lights to hide their LED signature and trick people into thinking they look like the Golf Mk7 units. Their horizontal shape cannot be hidden, however, as it’s outlined by the cutouts in the tailgate, rear bumper and rear fender.</p>
<p>We’ve already seen the all-new Golf wagon wearing no camouflage but this is the first sighting of a prototype that’s not wearing white paint.</p>
<p>See Also: Picturing What The 2021 VW Golf Variant Mk8 Will Look Like Is Easy-Peasy</p>
<p>The example our photographers snapped on public roads in Germany features a milky light grey paint which is found in VW’s color palette under the name Moonstone Grey. This color appears to suit the Golf Variant better than white, which looks too utilitarian for some tastes.</p>
<p>The front end looks just like the Golf Mk8 hatchback and judging by the ‘Norfolk’ 16-inch alloy wheels we can assume this is a Life trim level. The interior will obviously look identical with the hatch, including the fully-digital dash but with the notable exception of the cargo compartment which will be much bigger.</p>
<p>The engine lineup will also be shared with the Golf hatch, which means we can expect at least four turbocharged three- and four-cylinder TSI units and two four-cylinder TDIs. Some of the petrol engines will offer optional mild-hybrid assistance; 4Motion all-wheel drive will be optional with the more powerful engines.</p>
<p>Expect a similar trim level structure too, including Golf, Life, Style and R-Line. A Golf GTD Variant will sit at the top of the lineup but it remains to be seen whether VW will offer a successor to the Golf R Variant high-performance wagon.</p>
