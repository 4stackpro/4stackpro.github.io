Michael O’Leary says business model will be in tatters if he is forced to leave middle seats empty</p>
<p>Ryanair planes won’t return to the skies if the airline is forced to leave the middle seat empty to comply with “idiotic” in-flight social distancing rules, its chief executive, Michael O’Leary, has said.</p>
<p>The boss of the no-frills carrier, which has thrived by packing its flights as full as possible with passengers lured by low prices, has previously said that blocking out the space in between seats is “nonsense” that would have no beneficial effect.</p>
<p>He doubled down on the comments on Wednesday, saying that if governments insisted on social distancing measures, then Ryanair’s business model would be in tatters and the carrier would not fly.</p>
<p>O’Leary said that Ryanair had already told the Irish government that if it imposes the restriction, then “either the government pays for the middle seat or we won’t fly”.</p>
<p>The Dublin-based carrier’s business model relies on flying as frequently as possible, stripping out costs and running an extremely high “load factor”, the aviation industry term for how full planes are.</p>
<p>“We can’t make money on 66% load factors,” he said.</p>
<p>“Even if you do that, the middle seat doesn’t deliver any social distancing, so it’s kind of an idiotic idea that doesn’t achieve anything anyway,” he added, in an interview with the Financial Times.</p>
<p>The global airline industry’s trade body, Iata, has predicted huge ramifications for airlines as a result of Covid-19, with lost revenues this year set to hit $314bn (£255bn).</p>
<p>Iata said earlier this week that any rules designed to minimise contagion in the skies would temporarily put an end to the cheap air travel model pioneered by Ryanair, forcing carriers to raise prices by 50% or go bust.</p>
<p>Ryanair’s no-frills rival easyJet has said it expects socially distanced flights to be possible in the short term, given that demand for air travel is likely to be subdued in any case, even after lockdown restrictions ease off.</p>
<p>O’Leary said European airlines should instead take their cue from Asia and impose different safety measures, such as forcing passengers to wear masks or checking their temperature at the airport.</p>

<p>Ryanair flew more than 152 million people last year, putting it at the top of the league table of European airlines, a position that gives O’Leary a particularly influential voice in the industry.</p>
<p>He sounded a more upbeat tone than some of his rivals, predicting a return to normal passenger numbers by summer 2021, provided a vaccine for Covid-19 can be developed.</p>
<p>He said the airline would be able to pick up business from rivals that collapse as a result of the pandemic, which has already forced Virgin Australia to file for bankruptcy and left Ryanair’s European rival Norwegian Air fighting for its survival.</p>
<p>Airlines including Ryanair have faced criticism for dragging their feet on giving refunds for cancelled flights, as they look to conserve cash during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Some of the industry’s biggest players are also trying to convince governments to bail them out, after air travel all but ceased.</p>
<p>• This article was amended on 23 April 2020 to clarify that the seats being blocked out would be those between the window seats and aisle seats.

<h3 id="ryanair-is-being-mean-again-but-we-dont-really-care">Ryanair is being mean again but we don’t really care</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4236343&amp;origw=1440" alt="img">
Ryanair – no stranger to controversy at the best of times – is the latest company to find itself navigating a tricky press landscape as more and more companies find themselves in hot water over their response to the coronavirus pandemic,</p>
<p>The airline’s customers are being told they won’t receive refunds until lockdown measures ease, and are being offered vouchers in place of refunds for cancelled flights. Social media is naturally ablaze with outrage over the company’s latest gambit to save pennies wherever it can, with some beleaguered patrons calling for a boycott of Ryanair altogether.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in the UK, JD Wetherspoon – a cheap and ubiquitous pub chain – is also weathering a storm largely of its own making. Wetherspoon’s chief, Tim Martin, first caused outrage by claiming it was over the top to shut pubs; and, mere days later, indicating he would not continue to pay employees after the closure of pubs was enforced, callously suggesting to his 40,000-strong workforce that they seek a job in Tesco in the meantime.</p>
<p>The internet was again awash with calls to boycott Wetherspoons. And commentators noted that what seemed like a financially prudent (if cruel and exploitative) decision for Martin may not pay dividends in the end, as former patrons refuse to return to his premises in protest when pubs eventually reopen.</p>
<p>Deluge of theorising</p>
<p>Plenty of ink has been spilled over how coronavirus will change the world for good: we will shop online more, we will move away from cities, more people will work from home, fewer people will work from home, the high street will die, the high street will thrive. Amid the deluge of theorising on how our world will be shaped by this unprecedented crisis, we have also been confronted with claims that consumers will remember how businesses behaved, and will adjust their spending habits accordingly.</p>
<p>But consumers have a short memory. And, we often believe our behaviour is guided by a stronger moral compass than it actually is. When lockdown ends, and we can travel and drink in pubs again, will our attitudes change en masse? Will Wetherspoon actually be forced to shutter its doors at the behest of a nationwide boycott? Will we all of a sudden find ourselves willing to pay more to fly with British Airways or Aer Lingus?</p>
<p>It seems unlikely. In fact, the gap between our attitudes and our consumer behaviour is getting wider, as Charlie Palmer, a strategist at advertising agency Uncommon, notes. While we are happy claiming that we want to buy more “ethical” products, or to avoid companies with a loose approach to the notion of “corporate responsibility”, we have seen little appreciable difference in our actual habits. In fact, academics have found that though our ethical considerations might be becoming more sophisticated, this rarely translates into behaviour that favours ethical companies and punishes unethical ones.</p>
<p>There is little moral equivalence between Ryanair being slow to offer refunds and Martin’s callous treatment of his already poorly paid staff. But for both companies, their value is not rooted in whether we perceive them to be good or bad moral actors but in the far simpler fact that they are cheap, accessible and largely democratising forces in their industries.</p>
<p>It is, too, much easier for the average consumer to boycott a company when we can switch to another with no financial cost, and without forsaking convenience. There aren’t plenty of alternatives to Ryanair; and Wetherspoon’s entire raison d’etre is that you’ll get much more bang for you buck than at an independent local.</p>
<p>Cheap and convenient</p>
<p>Whatever criticisms we might throw at these companies – and the thousands of others like them – the fact that that they are cheap and convenient seems to trump many other considerations when we choose where to spend our money. We need to take only a cursory glance at the current good fortunes of Amazon – widely known for its poor treatment of warehouse staff – as evidence of this.</p>
<p>Despite this, we should of course strive to alter our purchasing behaviour wherever we can – opting to support local business, buying Fairtrade where affordable, cutting down on international travel, and being mindful of the impacts of fast fashion. But it is also worth noting that it is not solely incumbent on the consumer to change the world via our purchasing habits: we probably cannot spend our way to a fairer society.</p>
<p>And though we may enjoy calls across social media to boycott whatever company finds itself in the midst of an image crisis, we would do well to remember that the impact is (for better or for worse) often minimal. Our consumer memory is short; we prioritise efficiency and cost over whatever is going on behind the scenes; and the likes of Wetherspoon and Ryanair will likely weather storms of this stripe for years to come.

<h3 id="ryanair-may-legally-challenge-eu-state-bailouts-for-national-carriers">Ryanair may legally challenge EU state bailouts for national carriers</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4237143&amp;origw=1440" alt="img">
Ryanair told Europe’s top competition official that it may go to court to stop France and other countries from “selectively gifting billions of euros to their inefficient flag carriers”.</p>
<p>Michael O’Leary, Ryanair’s chief executive, said in a letter to competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager that the European Union would be “forced into an embarrassing U-turn” on state aid if Ryanair won a legal challenge. The national programmes should be modified so that Ryanair could get a share of the bailout packages by making sure loan guarantees and other perks are available to “all EU airlines in proportion to their share of traffic in a particular country,” Mr O’Leary said in the April 9th letter seen by Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Outbreak</p>
<p>Ryanair’s intervention threatens to slow government efforts to shower billions of euros of aid on airlines across the region, after the coronavirus outbreak halted travel.</p>
<p>France and the Netherlands are readying a bailout package for Air France-KLM and Deutsche Lufthansa, the region’s biggest carrier, has discussed a rescue from Germany and other countries. Italy wants to take over bankrupt Alitalia.</p>
<p>“These are the crack cocaine junkies of the state-aid world because their first instinct is to always go to the government for state aid,” Mr O’Leary said in an interview. “We believe that any state aid in this crisis should be transparent and provided to everybody.”</p>
<p>The European Commission declined to comment other than to say it has been in contact with several airlines, including Ryanair. The Irish airline said in a statement that it is “in contact with the European Commission to ensure that it remains vigilant and blocks any aid measures that favour ‘national’ airlines.”</p>
<p>Return to normal</p>
<p>Separately, Mr O’Leary said he won’t take delivery of Boeing’s 737 Max jetliner until summer 2021 as air travel claws its way back from the coronavirus outbreak. Ryanair is one of the main customers for the Max with 210 orders. The jet had been grounded for a year after two fatal crashes by the time the pandemic hit European flights, and Mr O’Leary said on Friday that Ryanair doesn’t now want the planes until markets return to normal.</p>
<p>The carrier is banking on the collapse of weaker rivals to drive growth, Mr O’Leary said. Its flights should reach about 40 per cent of the usual schedule in the month they resume, most likely late June or early July, increasing to 60 per cent by September, the last month of the summer season, he predicted. The winter timetable may operate at more-usual levels as price wars prompt people to make up for missed summer holidays. – Bloomberg
