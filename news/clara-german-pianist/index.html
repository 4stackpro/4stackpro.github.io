<p>According to Edvard Grieg, Clara Schumann was “one of the most soulful and famous pianists of the day”. As a composer, she was admired as well. In the past five decades, the pieces she wrote were rediscovered and interpreted a lot.</p>
<p>Friedrich Wieck was a very determined man. The theologist was into music so much that he started studying the piano intensively. His first wife Marianne, a pianist and singer, probably was a big influence on him. In this constellation, they had five children, three sons and two daughters, the second of which was Clara.</p>
<p>Exploitation by Father</p>
<p>Once she was five years old, her musical talent became evident. Friedrich Wieck might have exaggerated when he started teaching her the piano intensively at this age. He wanted to introduce her to the public as a child prodigy as early as possible. In today’s world, his approach would have been seen as exploitation of a child.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Wieck may have been worried about putting too much pressure on his daughter. Different sources say he made sure Clara took long walks. Also she learned foreign languages. But music played a huge role. After only a few years in primary school, Clara was taught by private teachers. That way, more piano lessons could be built into her schedule.</p>
<p>Two years before her death, in 1894, Clara Schumann said her father had indeed been very understanding. He had always made sure she would not practice too much. People would of course call him a tyrant, “but I thank him on a daily basis.”</p>
<p>The Gender Aspect</p>
<p>When we look at Clara Schumann, the gender aspect is quite important, even though it should not be. Born 200 years ago, on September 13th, 1819 in Leipzig as Carla Wieck, she became a famous composer in spite of being a woman. Even today, so many decades later, there is a gender issue in this field. Women are absolutely underrepresented among composers, even in 2020.</p>
<p>Something happened when Carla Wieck was 8 years old. The future star composer Robert Schumann, who was then 20 years old, came to live with the Wieck family. He wanted to be taught on the piano by Friedrich Wieck. Even while Carla was still a little child, they supposedly got along very well.</p>
<p>Clara Schumann was a genius composer and pianist.</p>
<p>Once she was 16, love kicked in. Schumann, who would be one of the most respected German composers one day, just like Clara, even dedicated a composition to her. ‘Chiarina’ became part of his piano cycle ‘Carnaval op. 9’.</p>
<p>Carla Wieck Becomes Carla Schumann</p>
<p>As opposed to Carla Wieck and Robert Schumann, Friedrich Wieck was not exactly happy about the relationship they had. In fact, he took her on long concert tours and forbade any communication in letters, long before the telephone, chats and e-mails were invented. Later, Wieck brought Carla to friends of his, who were supposed to make sure she would not see Schumann.</p>
<p>But they supported the relationship. In the summer of 1837, Carla secretly became engaged with her boyfriend. At this moment in time, Carla Wieck became a star in Vienna, where she gave a series of concerts. After a long stay in Paris, she moved to Berlin in order to live with her mother. Her parents had separated shortly before.</p>
<p>Robert Schumann dedicated this piece to Carla Schumann.</p>
<p>Now Carla finally had the opportunity to see Robert Schumann. But in those days, marriage was not possible without her father’s consent. They took him to court to get the latter. Then, finally, on September 12th, 1840, Clara Wieck became Carla Schumann. The two lovers were together. Forever.</p>
<p>Famous Visitors</p>
<p>The couple’s apartment in Leipzig became a haven of love and music. Very often, the Schumanns welcomed visitors they would play their compositions for in private concerts. Many fellow composers were among them, including Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, who lived in Leipzig as well, Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner.</p>
<p>For Carla Schumann, a problem arose. Her husband wanted her at his side. She was supposed to support him and play the piano less than before. This aspect was hard to digest for her. At the same time, Robert Schumann encouraged his wife to keep on composing pieces.</p>
<p>Two daughters were born in 1841 and 1843. Another six children followed later. Seven of them survived their childhood. A reconciliation with her father Friedrich Wieck was reached. Carla Schumann kept on performing, in spite of her husband’s wishes, and contributed to the family’s income. They moved to Dresden, and later to Düsseldorf.</p>
<p>Deteriorating Health</p>
<p>Over the years, it was Carla Schumann who helped Robert Schumann to become a famous and respected composer, by interpreting his pieces on stage, apart from her own.</p>
<p>Johannes Brahms, yet another future star composer, visited the Schumanns when Robert was already very ill. Brahms fell in love with Carla Schumann. It is unclear whether they became lovers, but the letters they wrote to each other sounded that way. Only some of those letters survived.</p>
<p>At some point, Carla Schumann moved back to Berlin, and later to Frankfurt. At age 71 she gave her last concert. She suffered from chronic headaches which affected her hearing. After two strokes, she died on May 20th, 1896, at age 76.</p>
<p>Rediscovered in the 1960s</p>
<p>After her death, her work was largely forgotten. She was mainly remembered as a great pianist and as Robert Schumann’s wife who had promoted his legacy. But in the 1960s, her own compositions were rediscovered. Today, lots of interpretations of her pieces are available, along with her pieces on music sheets.</p>
<p>Clara Schumann’s face was on the 100 Deutschmarks banknote in the Federal Republic of Germany. “The lady on the 100 Marks bill” is unforgotten. She will live on forever, in her truly beautiful music.</p>
<p>In Germany she was celebrated around her 200th birthday last year, both on and off stage. In September of 2019, the Schumann Festival in Leipzig honored her. The Gewandhaus Orchestra played her Piano Concert at the Gewandhaus Concert Hall.</p>
<p>By the way: The publication you are reading, The Berlin Spectator, was established in January of 2019. We have worked a whole lot, as you can see. But there has hardly been any income.</p>
<p>As of May 7th, 2020, we made an average of 74 Euro per month since starting the project, which is far from enough.</p>

<h3 id="music--the-great-pianist-judith-jáuregui-gives-us-her-magnificent-version-of-the-romantic-soul-by-clara-and-robert-schumann-video">&ldquo;Music : The great pianist Judith Jáuregui gives us her magnificent version of &lsquo;The romantic soul&rsquo; by Clara and Robert Schumann (video)&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.explica.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/325435_judith-jauregui.JPEG" alt="img">
More romantic, impossible. Better, impossible. Yes, because the young and already established pianist Judith Jáuregui presents her latest album ‘Die romantische Seele (El alma romantica)’ this June, with music by Clara and Robert Schumann, edited by the prestigious German label ARS Produktion. With Schumann’s concerto for piano and orchestra, one of the pinnacles of the piano and orchestra repertoire recorded together with the Symphony Orchestra Camera Musicae under the direction of its owner Tomás Grau, and three pieces for solo piano, the album gathers the intense depth union of two of the most important authors in the history of music. With them the artist returns to the purest romanticism and to one of the composers who have most marked her in her career.</p>
<p>Judith Jáuregui fully expresses, with this her new magnificent album, her strong emotional and vital connection with Robert Schumann, who was already the protagonist of her first record work almost ten years ago. “Schumann’s music was one of the first musics that I met as a child, I practically started reading on the instrument with his Youth Album. So it can be said that in music, Schumann would be my mother tongue, and my first emotional language – declares Judith. Almost a decade has passed since her first album, in which the great artist has delved into other authors and times: “And now, with ‘The Romantic Soul’, I feel that I am going back to my origin,” he explains.</p>
<p>Judith Jáuregui and the Orquestra Simfònica Camera Musicae recorded ‘Die romantische Seele’ in November 2019, after completing a joint tour in the fall of that year. “It has been very nice to record with the Symphonic Orchestra Camera Musicae and its lead teacher, Tomàs Grau”, explains Judith, “since we met a few years ago playing Beethoven we connected very well. Just before recording we made a tour with the Schumann Concert through different rooms in Spain, including the National Auditorium in Madrid, so when we got to the recording we already had a breath and a created concept “.</p>
<p>“The experience was therefore fluid, from long takes and we lived it naturally, having fun to be able to make music together again. After the emotion shared with the orchestra, I also enjoyed recording the solo piano pieces, returning to the introspection and solitude of the instrument. in these works, which despite their not too large form, bear witness to the intense flame of their authors ”, the pianist concludes.</p>
<p>Orchestra and soloist perform the Concerto for piano and orchestra in A minor, Op. 54 in the first 35 minutes of the disc, a work that is completed with Judith’s interpretation of piano solos by both Robert and Clara: Quasi variazioni: Andantino by Clara Wieck, by Robert; Variations on a theme by Robert Schumann op. 20, by Clara; and finally again Robert, with, Arabeske in C major op. 18. “The first two are written in minor mode so I chose the C major from the Arabeske op. 18, the tonality of simplicity and purity, to dismiss the album with its light and hope ”, Judith points out.</p>
<p>When selecting the album’s repertoire and from her deep bond with Robert Schumann, Judith has also considered Clara’s presence essential to transmit the romantic soul. “You can’t imagine Robert without Clara, nor Clara without Robert. Hence, he wanted to unite the music of both and reflect their faithful union in a selection of works that were born from mutual inspiration.. The life and work of both represent ‘the romantic soul’, and their relationship contains the ideals of the moment: love, passion, sensitivity, intensity, respect, freedom, vitality, dedication, light, darkness, joy and also suffering. ”</p>
<p>His second job with ARS Produktion</p>
<p>‘Die romantische Seele’ is Judith’s second album with the German label ARS Produktion, after the release a year ago of ‘Pour le tombeau de Claude Debussy’, a live recording from an intimate concert in Vienna. “The collaboration has once again been extraordinary, and ARS Produktion confirms its wonderful care for sound and its artists,” says the pianist.</p>
<p>The new album is the sixth album in his career, a discography that shows his wide repertoire and collects different authors and periods: from the same Schumann, to whom he dedicated his already mentioned first album released in 2010 and was awarded Best Classical Album at the Independent Music Awards, to other composers such as Granados, Liszt, Chopin, Falla, Mompou, Albéniz, Szymanowski or Scriabin.</p>

<h3 id="pianist-david-korevaar-and-violinist-charles-wetherbee-present-virtual-recital-series">&ldquo;Pianist David Korevaar and Violinist Charles Wetherbee Present Virtual Recital Series&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cloudimages.broadwayworld.com/columnpiccloud/1250-6f1db9f7bf7cc97c9b24c6a8f4bc037d.jpg" alt="img">
As part of the Snake River Music Festival, award-winning pianist David Korevaar and acclaimed violinist Charles Wetherbee will present a series of three virtual recitals from the University of Colorado Boulder&rsquo;s Grusin Hall on June 14, 21, and 28, at 2 pm EST / 12 noon MST. Hosted by David Ginder from Colorado Public Radio, each program will be live streamed from the Dercum Center at <a href="http://www.dercumcenter.com">www.dercumcenter.com</a></p>
<p>The June 14 program, entitled Alt Wien honors the memory of Colorado ski industry pioneer Alf Tieze, and features music of Schubert and Brahms including Schubert&rsquo;s Rondo in B Minor, D. 895 and Brahms&rsquo; Sonata No. 2 in A Major, Op. 100, as well as salon favorites by Fritz Kreisler. On June 21, the duo will perform a Spanish-themed program called El fuego español! including De Falla&rsquo;s Suite Populaire Espagnole, Poulenc&rsquo;s Sonata and three of Sarasate&rsquo;s Spanish Dances, as well as the virtuoso solo violin caprice Charred in a Minute by Korine Fujiwara. The June 28 program, A Fine Romance, will feature Dohnanyi&rsquo;s Violin Sonata, Op. 21, Saint Saëns&rsquo; rarely heard Sonata No. 2, Op. 102, Clara Schumann&rsquo;s Three Romances, Op. 22 and the Romances for violin and piano by Dvorak and Amy Beach.</p>
<p>Korevaar and Wetherbee, both faculty members of the esteemed University of Colorado Boulder College of Music, have a long history of concertizing and recording together. Their recent recordings include an album dedicated to the works of Iranian-American composer Reza Vali, which AllMusic praised as &ldquo;an important release in the field of 20th century chamber music,&rdquo; a disc of three violin sonatas by Russian/German composer Paul Juon in which American Record Guide recognized the duo as &ldquo;expert, sensitive, and committed performers who bring this forgotten music to vivid life&rdquo; and Tibor Harsányi&rsquo;s A Hungarian in Paris.</p>
<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to grip America&rsquo;s concert halls and live concerts remain a thing only to be dreamed of, Korevaar has embraced the virtual recital format. In March, Korevaar set a goal of posting home YouTube recordings of the 32 Beethoven Piano Sonatas in 60 days and 41 days into the project, all 32 were up and running. As he found himself in the position of being able to expand his Beethovenian horizons, learning some new non-Sonata works and revisiting some old friends, especially among the variations sets, he is now starting on the next phase of Beethoven recording and uploading a series of the composer&rsquo;s Bagatelles, Variations, the Fantasy and Polonaise. Please visit the link below for his daily installments.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNiJdVWd0JNsLBoajLNTVG_omFYfvQF4r">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNiJdVWd0JNsLBoajLNTVG_omFYfvQF4r</a></p>
<p>As part of the 2020 Virtual Colorado MahlerFest last month, Korevaar performed Schubert&rsquo;s Piano Sonata in B-flat, D. 960 which can be viewed at: <a href="https://mahlerfest.org/mahlerfest-online/korevaar-and-schubert/">https://mahlerfest.org/mahlerfest-online/korevaar-and-schubert/</a></p>
<p>Award winning pianist David Korevaar is in demand as a soloist, chamber musician and collaborator. His active career includes appearances with the Rochester Philharmonic, Colorado Symphony, Louisville Orchestra, Japan&rsquo;s Shonan Chamber Orchestra, Brazil&rsquo;s Goiania Symphony, and with acclaimed conductors including Guillermo Figueroa, Per Brevig, Stanislaw Skrowaczewski and Jorge Mester. A passionate and committed collaborator, Korevaar is a founding member of the Boulder Piano Quartet, currently in residence at The Academy in Boulder. He is a regular guest with the Takács Quartet, and recently performed with them on the Great Performers series at Lincoln Center in New York. Korevaar&rsquo;s most recent addition to his extensive discography of over 50 titles is a highly praised disc of world premiere recordings of piano music by the largely forgotten Italian impressionist composer Luigi Perrachio. He returned to the recording studio earlier this season to record Richard Danielpour&rsquo;s The Celestial Circus for two pianos and three percussionists with pianist Angelina Gadeliya.</p>
<p>Chas Wetherbee has performed throughout the world, including Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Canada, Mexico and the United States. A native of Buffalo, New York and a graduate of Curtis, he made his debut with the Buffalo Philharmonic under Symon Bychkov, and since then has performed with the National Symphony, the Japan Philharmonic, the Concerto Soloists of Philadelphia, the Philharmonic Orchestra of Bogota (Columbia), the National Repertory Orchestra, the Orchestra Nacional de Mexico and the Virginia Symphony, among others. A devoted chamber musician, Charles is the first violinist of the Carpe Diem String Quartet, with whom he tours and performs regularly. Wetherbee also serves as the Artistic Director of the Keystone, Colorado based Snake River Music Festival.</p>

<h3 id="the-power-woman-of-classical-music-clara-schumann">&ldquo;The power woman of classical music: Clara Schumann&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.dw.com/image/39046002_304.jpg" alt="img">
In the Clara Schumann anniversary year, there are special concerts everywhere in Germany and exhibitions in Zwickau, Frankfurt, Bonn and Leipzig. In the latter city alone — her birthplace — there are some 170 events honoring Schumann in 2019. New biographies and diaries of her youth have been published, and Clara Schumann&rsquo;s compositions, long forgotten, are turning up on playbills.</p>
<p>Her image is nearly universally familiar in Germany — at least to those who were around before the euro was adopted in 2002 — as &ldquo;the woman on the 100 Deutsche Mark bill&rdquo; that was introduced in 1989. Beyond that, though, Clara Schumann left an indelible mark on music life, one still palpable today.</p>
<p>Bold at the piano, retiring in person</p>
<p>This notable person was born in Leipzig on September 13, 1819 as Clara Wieck. Her divorced father, Friedrich Wieck, was a well-known piano teacher and founder of a piano factory. He gave her tutelage in piano playing according to his own personally developed method from age five. He also had her schooled in composition and in foreign languages, complemented by long walks and physical exercise, which built the child&rsquo;s strength.</p>
<p>Even the young girl looks ambitious and self-confident in this image</p>
<p>At age nine, Clara gave her piano debut in the Leipzig Gewandhaus. Soon afterward, Friedrich Wieck had his daughter&rsquo;s opus 1 published, &ldquo;Four Polonaises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Father and daughter went on extended concert tours — first in Germany, later to Paris and other foreign destinations. Often lasting two or three months, the journeys in a coach were strenuous. Sometimes the piano had to be brought along.</p>
<p>Clara Wieck&rsquo;s playing was described as feisty and passionate. &ldquo;The girl has more strength than six boys combined,&rdquo; wrote Johann Wolfgang von Goethe after a concert in Weimar. Those who met her in person came away with a different impression. Felix Mendelssohn described her as shy and quiet. In 1838 Franz Liszt called her &ldquo;a very simple person, very well raised, no coquette, totally absorbed in her art, but in the most noble sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prominent acquaintances and first love</p>
<p>Her concert programs, which often included her own works, must have been impressive. Among her pieces was an A Minor Piano Concerto filled with cascading runs and daring leaps on the keyboard, premiered by Clara Wieck on November 9, 1835 as a 16-year-old.</p>
<p>German pianist Ragna Schirmer, who has performed original programs in the Clara Schumann anniversary year, admitted to being &ldquo;exhausted&rdquo; afterwards.</p>
<p>Trying to play in Clara&rsquo;s footsteps can leave a modern concert pianist exhausted</p>
<p>Liszt, Mendelssohn, Goethe, as well as Paganini and Chopin knew the young girl. And: Robert Schumann. She was nine years old when they first met, he a 19-year-old student of law living for a year in the Wieck household to take lessons from her famous father. Intimate friendship evolved into love when Clara was 16. When Friedrich Wieck got wind of it, he forbade any sort of contact between the two, organizing concert tours for his daughter and supervising her day and night.</p>
<p>Secretly engaged to be married in August 1837, the two fought for the right to marry in court. The court ruled in their favor, and Robert Schumann and Clara Wieck married on September 12, 1840, one day before her 21st birthday.</p>
<p>Bourgeois wife and celebrated pianist</p>
<p>Robert Schumann initially hoped his wife would discontinue concertizing and concentrate on her duties as spouse. Before long though, the couple&rsquo;s financial situation — and her determination — led to her comeback: Her first concert as Clara Schumann came in the autumn of 1840. &ldquo;I cannot refrain from my art. If I did, I&rsquo;d never forgive myself,&rdquo; she wrote.</p>
<p>Clara: the internationally celebrated pianist; Robert: the little-known composer. The couple banked completely on his compositional activities however, and because Robert needed peace and quiet in order to work, Clara had to strongly curtail her practicing. Her strongest wish was &ldquo;that Robert can completely live in and for music and his pleasure, that no care can cast a shadow on his life as an artist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite 10 pregnancies and eight live births, Clara gave at least 139 performances in their 14 years together. Those performances sometimes took the couple far afield, to northern Germany (1842), Russia (1844), Vienna (1846) and the Netherlands (1853). On tour, Robert had to deal with feelings of inferiority at the side of his famous wife. She, for her part, played his works and made them famous to an international audience.</p>
<p>The marriage seems to have been a happy and artistically productive one. The two exchanged musical ideas, Clara advised her husband in his compositional activity and Robert encouraged his wife&rsquo;s own creativity. Yet Clara seems to have absorbed society&rsquo;s attitude at the time, according to which composing was a man&rsquo;s work. Even after her &ldquo;Piano Trio&rdquo; of 1845, considered her most successful composition, she wrote: &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s a lady&rsquo;s work, always lacking in power, and here and there uninspired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A fruitful artistic partnerschaft</p>
<p>Clara Schumann&rsquo;s half-brother Woldemar Bargiel, visiting the couple in July and August 1852, reported of Robert&rsquo;s frequent spells of illness and how they affected his empathizing wife. It seemed to Bargiel &ldquo;as if Schumann and Clara had the same physical organism and every feeling of Schumann&rsquo;s flowed into her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert Schumann had suffered from spells of depression and mood swings from his teenage years. Today his condition might be described as a bipolar disorder. In their early years in Leipzig, later in Dresden (from 1844) and in Dusseldorf (from 1850), spells of illness and nervous breakdowns alternated with happier phases.</p>
<p>Plagued by hallucinations, Robert Schumann leaped into the Rhine River in a suicide attempt in early 1854, but was rescued by fishermen and taken to a clinic for the mentally ill in Endenich, near Bonn. On doctor&rsquo;s orders, his wife was only allowed to see him two days before his death on July 29, 1856.</p>
<p>The Schumann children (l. to r.): Ludwig, Marie, Felix, Elise, Ferdinand and Eugenie in a photo from 1855</p>
<p>The 37-year-old, who from that moment on appeared for the following 41 years of her life only in black, had to completely reorganize her life, relocating her children at boarding schools and with family members and resuming concert tours. From 1863-73, those tours took her 19 times to England alone.</p>
<p>Leaving her traces in modern concert life</p>
<p>A young family friend became a source of support: Johannes Brahms, who&rsquo;d met the Schumanns as a 20-year-old, one year before Robert&rsquo;s death. The story of Johannes Brahms and Clara Schumann is a love story, but also one speculated on, as the two agreed to destroy their letters to each other. What remains is correspondence revealing Clara as Brahms&rsquo;s best adviser in all matters compositional and affording a fascinating view into the nuts and bolts of the composer&rsquo;s trade.</p>
<p>After years in Baden-Baden and Berlin, Schumann was appointed &ldquo;First Piano Teacher&rdquo; at Dr. Hoch&rsquo;s Conservatory in Frankfurt on the Main. Madame Schumann gave lessons in her apartment on Mylius Street. Before long, her students were calling it &ldquo;Tears and Sighs Street&rdquo;: The Grand Dame of Music was notorious for her withering criticism. Clara was supported in her teaching by two of her daughters. Three of her sons had tragic fates: One was mentally handicapped and lived in a sanatorium, another was schizophrenic and a third addicted to opium.</p>
<p>Giving lessons on &ldquo;The Street of Tears and Sighs&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clara Schumann died in Frankfurt on May 20, 1896, 77 years old. Apart from her compositions, her most enduring influence probably rests in her concert programs, which evolved from the virtuosic but trifling pieces of her youth to complete sonatas and cycles by a canon of composers including Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Schubert and Bach — and of course Schumann, whose posthumous fame she tirelessly promoted.</p>
<p>As the 19th century&rsquo;s most important woman pianist, Clara Schumann thus contributed to the piano repertory still expected and performed today. As the publisher of her husband&rsquo;s works, she adapted the songs that Schumann once dedicated to her for piano. But one thing she nearly completely refrained from after his death: composing.
