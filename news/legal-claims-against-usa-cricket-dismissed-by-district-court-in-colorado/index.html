USA Cricket has been successful in having legal claims brought against it by American Cricket Premier League (‘ACPL’) dismissed by the District Court in Colorado.</p>
<p>The legal claims (which also included – among others – the International Cricket Council as a defendant) arose following the RFP process conducted by USA Cricket in early 2019 to identify a commercial entity for it to partner with to develop a professional T20 league in the USA and to grow the sport generally in the USA. Following a comprehensive process, USA Cricket chose American Cricket Enterprises (‘ACE’), also trading as Major League Cricket (‘MLC’), as its partner and it has been working very closely with ACE/MLC in that endeavor since then.</p>
<p>As part of that partnership, USA Cricket and ACE/MLC recently announced plans to launch a ground-breaking nationwide Twenty20 domestic tournament across 22 cities in the United States as the first step on the path towards establishing Major League Cricket, a fully professional league in the United States that will be launched subsequently. The court decision, which was announced on 12 March, emphatically dismissed all eight claims made by ACPL.</p>
<p>Iain Higgins, CEO of USA Cricket, stated, “We have been confident throughout this case that the RFP process which was followed was robust and fair to all parties and that the ultimate decision to appoint ACE/MLC as our commercial partner was in the best interests of the development of cricket in the country. ACE/MLC had an extremely comprehensive business plan with a highly credible individual and institutional investor group, allied with a deep knowledge of the American and international cricket landscape. Even when the court was presented with an inaccurate factual narrative of the RFP process, we were confident that it would agree with our arguments and are pleased that it has been unequivocal in its dismissal of this case.”</p>
<p>Higgins continued, “USA Cricket recently moved its offices to the Bay Area for the purposes of maximizing efficiency and ensuring strategic alignment with our commercial partner ACE/MLC. We have witnessed first-hand the efforts made to put together the plans to deliver a nationwide Minor League Cricket this coming season as well as the plans that are evolving in respect of the launch Major League Cricket in due course, and I am both extremely impressed and excited. As part of this, there are significant long term planning and lobbying efforts ongoing to improve facilities and develop venues across the country, all of which have been initiated by ACE/MLC and are fully supported by USA Cricket. The progress over the past few months vindicates our decision to partner with ACE/MLC in the first instance, and the dismissal of ACPL’s legal claims now allows us all to fully focus our collective efforts on these and other efforts to grow the game in this country.”

<h3 id="united-states-now-has-the-most-coronavirus-cases-in-the-world">United States now has the most coronavirus cases in the world</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2020/3/27/d7ad3cd23c734d2393115cd4f78e19ea_18.jpg" alt="img">
The United States now has the most reported coronavirus cases in the world, surpassing China and Italy, with the three countries accounting for almost half of the world&rsquo;s infections.</p>
<p>The US has registered nearly 86,000 cases, including fewer than 800 recoveries, while China counted about 81,000 cases, more than 74,000 of which had already recovered, according to data collected by the Johns Hopkins University in the US. For its part, Italy has logged more than 80,000 cases, with 10,360 recoveries and some 8,200 deaths.</p>
<p>More:</p>
<p>The US has registered about 1,300 deaths, almost a quarter of them in New York City, where hospitals are overwhelmed.</p>
<p>In China, where the virus was believed to have been transferred from wild animals to humans, the National Health Commission on Friday reported 55 new cases, including 54 it said were imported infections in recent arrivals from overseas.</p>
<p>There were no new cases reported in Wuhan, the provincial capital where the coronavirus is reported to have emerged from late last year.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump, who had until recently insisted on calling the new coronavirus the &ldquo;Chinese virus&rdquo;, tweeted on Friday that he and China&rsquo;s President Xi Jinping had &ldquo;a very good conversation&rdquo; and discussed &ldquo;in great detail the CoronaVirus that is ravaging large parts of our Planet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Economy</p>
<p>The economic damage from the pandemic was growing as a record-shattering 3.3 million US citizens applied for unemployment benefits in a single week - nearly five times the old record, set in 1982.</p>
<p>Job losses have swept across sectors from food services to retail to transportation, as nearly half of the country has closed to non-essential businesses.</p>
<p>200126061554884</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is staggering. We are only seeing the initial numbers. They will get worse, unfortunately,&rdquo; New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters, estimating that half a million people in the city would lose work.</p>
<p>But stock markets continued to climb on Friday, with Asian bourses in the green after a third straight day of rises on Wall Street.</p>
<p>Traders have taken heart from the passage through the Senate of a $2 trillion stimulus bill - the largest in US history, which will support the country&rsquo;s businesses and provide cash payouts to people.</p>
<p>The rescue plan, which is expected to be voted on in the House of Representatives on Friday, would initially dispense cheques of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child.
