The Boston Bruins are doing their part to help out former teammate Colby Cave, who&rsquo;s in a medically induced coma.</p>
<p>Cave, 25, who played for the Bruins organization from 2014-19 and is now with the Edmonton Oilers, is in a Toronto hospital after having surgery to remove a colloid cyst that was causing pressure on his brain.</p>
<p>Because Cave&rsquo;s wife, Emily, can&rsquo;t go into the room with him, members of the Bruins organization will record messages for her to play to her husband over a communication system.</p>
<p>“Hopefully that helps,” Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy told the Athletic. “Anything we can do. Every little bit helps and if we can chip in with some encouraging words, then that’s what we’re going to do.”</p>
<p>Emily had posted a heart-rending message on Instagram Wednesday about her husband&rsquo;s condition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please wake up,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;Please wake up. It’s all I can keep asking, “he’s going to wake up right?” We need a miracle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The center had played in 23 games for the Bruins and 44 with the Oilers after he was picked up on waivers in January 2019.</p>
<p>Cassidy also coached him with the American Hockey League Providence (Rhode Island) Bruins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he enjoyed his time in Providence and Boston,&rdquo; Cassidy told the Athletic. &ldquo;His wife got to know all the girls and he was very tight with the players here. They formed a good bond. Colby’s a likable guy; he’s hard not to like.”

TORONTO (AP) &ndash; Edmonton Oilers forward Colby Cave remains in a medically induced coma in a Toronto hospital after suffering a brain bleed earlier in the week.</p>
<p>The Oilers, through Cave&rsquo;s family, provided an update on Cave&rsquo;s status Thursday on their Twitter account.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;This is giving his brain time to heal &amp; rest from all he&rsquo;s been through,&rsquo;&rsquo; the team wrote in the post.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old native of Battleford, Saskatchewan, was airlifted Tuesday to Sunnybrook Hospital and underwent emergency surgery. Doctors removed a colloid cyst that was causing pressure on his brain.</p>
<p>Cave&rsquo;s wife, Emily, posted an update on Instagram on Wednesday after seeing him through a window with his parents and talking to him via a walkie-talkie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;My heart is shattered into a million pieces without my best friend,&rsquo;&rsquo; she wrote.</p>
<p>Emily Cave said the family is no longer allowed to be in the hospital because of COVID-19 rules. She said they have no idea when they will be allowed to see him again.</p>
<p>Cave scored one goal in 11 games with Edmonton this season. He has four goals and five assists over 67 NHL games with Boston and Edmonton.</p>

<p>Edmonton Oilers forward Colby Cave remains in a medically induced coma at a Toronto hospital after suffering a brain bleed earlier this week.</p>
<p>The Oilers, through Cave’s family, provided an update on his status Thursday on their Twitter account.</p>
<p>“Colby is still in a medically-induced coma,” the team said. “This is giving his brain time to heal and rest from all he’s been through.”</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>The 25-year-old native of Battleford, Sask., was airlifted to Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto on Tuesday after being admitted to a hospital in Barrie, Ont., on Monday.</p>
<p>Cave underwent emergency surgery Tuesday, with doctors removing a colloid cyst that was causing pressure on his brain.</p>
<p>“He’s as tough as they come,” Oilers captain Connor McDavid said on a video conference with reporters Thursday. “If anyone’s going to get through this it’s Colby Cave. Everyone needs to keep Colby, his wife, Emily, and the entire family in their thoughts and prayers and send out good vibes for them, because that’s all we can do.</p>
<p>“Obviously it’s devastating, Colby’s a guy who is so well liked in our dressing room,” McDavid added. “I’m sure he’s been well liked in any room he’s been in. He’s such a good guy.</p>
<p>“You just pray that he wakes up and the family’s okay.”</p>
<p>Emily Cave posted an update on Instagram on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>“We need a miracle,” she wrote. “Colby’s parents and myself, got to see him through a window and talk to him with a walkie-talkie last night. We are no longer allowed to be in the hospital because Covid-19 rules. We have no idea when we will be allowed to see him again.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>“The nurse has tied his wedding band to his ankle. I am dreaming of being able to touch you, hear your voice, squeeze your hand (3 times), and kiss you again. I love you so much, and my heart is shattered into a million pieces without my best friend.”</p>
<p>Cave’s agent, Jason Davidson, said Tuesday that his illness doesn’t appear to be linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Cave scored once in 11 appearances with Edmonton this season and added 11 goals and 23 points in 44 games with the American Hockey League’s Bakersfield Condors. He has four goals and five assists over 67 NHL games with Boston and Edmonton.</p>
<p>The 6-foot-1, 200-pound Cave made his NHL debut with Boston on Dec. 21, 2017, after getting called up from Providence of the AHL.
