<p>The “regular guy/gal and famous person date” rom-com club (see: Notting Hill, Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!) got a new member on Monday with ABC’s premiere of The Baker and the Beauty — but was it love at first sight for you?</p>
<p>Based on the Israeli series, the remake stars Victor Rasuk (Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan, How to Make It in America) as Daniel Garcia, a regular Joe who works at his parents’ Cuban bakery in Miami. On the night that his girlfriend Vanessa (Gotham‘s Michelle Veintimilla) proposes to him in extremely horrifying fashion by singing Taylor Swift’s “Love Story” in the middle of a fancy restaurant, Daniel bumps into Noa Hamilton (Dynasty‘s Nathalie Kelley), a model-turned-fashion mogul who is coming off a highly publicized split with her cheating actor boyfriend. In the bathroom, Noa overhears Daniel talking to a picture about how whether he proposes soon or not, he’s screwed either way.</p>
<p>“If you have to talk yourself into something, maybe you should just stop talking,” Noa advises Daniel. So when Vanessa pops the question, Daniel turns her down in front of everyone, and she, in turn, dumps his soup all over him before declaring to the onlookers that she can cook, has her own business and is officially on the market.</p>
<p>Outside the restaurant, Noa offers Daniel a ride, along with three wishes — and a night he’ll never forget. They start by rappelling down the side of a building to spray-paint an ad featuring Noa, whose father used her image without her approval. Then the two bond and giggle and bake dessert before heading to a nightclub for some flirty dancing.</p>
<p>Daniel’s family can’t believe he’s out with Noa, but it’s all over her social media, so it must be true. And to confirm it, Daniel puts Noa on the phone with his younger sister Natalie (Belissa Escobedo) as his second wish. (His first wish was simply for a new shirt to replace his soup-stained one.) The wholesome wish further charms Noa, whose ex wished for a threesome with her best friend for his birthday. Noa reassures Natalie that if she’s even half as charming as her brother, she’ll make friends at her new school. When Daniel grabs the phone back, Natalie insists, “Don’t talk to me. Talk to her. She likes you.”</p>
<p>But is it for real? Noa’s manager Lewis (Scandal‘s Dan Bucatinsky) warns Daniel that Noa does this after every heartbreak. She meets normal guys, takes them along for the ride and then quietly has Lewis return them to their reality. Daniel storms out of the club and heads home, where he finds a huge line outside the family bakery, thanks to Noa’s hashtags. Vanessa’s phone is also blowing up with photos of Noa and Daniel’s night out. While Vanessa goes on a rampage, looking for Daniel — seriously, someone get this woman a clue — Noa shows up at Daniel’s home. “I still owe you a wish,” she announces.</p>
<p>The cast also includes Carlos Gómez (The Glades), Lisa Vidal (Being Mary Jane, The Division) and David Del Rio (The Troop) as Daniel’s father, mother and brother, respectively.</p>

<h3 id="the-baker-and-the-beauty-star-carlos-gomez-says-the-comedy-with-latin-family-is-perfect-show-for-lockdown">&lsquo;The Baker and The Beauty&rsquo; star Carlos Gomez says the comedy with Latin family is &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; show for lockdown</h3>
<p><img src="https://cheesecake.articleassets.meaww.com/429386/uploads/3aed5390-7dc6-11ea-8304-559fd76abbe7_800_420.jpeg" alt="img">
Carlos Gomez is a face you will surely recognize, having been in projects like the original &lsquo;Charmed&rsquo;, &lsquo;24&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Glades&rsquo;, &lsquo;Madam Secretary&rsquo; and &lsquo;Law and Order True Crime: The Menedez Murders&rsquo; to name a few. However, it has been quite some time since he was part of a light hearted, more comedic project like &lsquo;The Baker and The Beauty&rsquo;. The new ABC series is a romantic comedy that takes place in Miami and follows Cuban baker Daniel Garcia (played by Victor Rasuk) and fashion icon Noa Hamilton (played by Nathalie Kelley) as they fall in love and juggle intertwining their very different lives. Gomez plays Daniel&rsquo;s father, Raphael Garcia, the patriarch of the Garcia family who owns and runs the bakery and is also a huge part of his son&rsquo;s life. Gomez was also raised in a Cuban family in Miami, so this is a very familiar story to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was born in New York but was raised in Miami, so I know this bakery, I went to it when I was a kid. The story is my parents&rsquo; story first immigrants coming to this country and trying to better themselves, working hard living the American dream, and really trying to progress. So, I can totally relate to the story,&rdquo; Gomez told MEA WorldWide (MEAWW).</p>
<p>With our world currently being turned upside down by the COVID-19 epidemic, Gomez believes &lsquo;The Baker and The Beauty&rsquo; is the perfect show to help distract us, even for a small amount of time every week. During a time like this, a show about love, family and community is something that we all need in our lives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The timing is perfect right now, because I think our country needs a little lightness, we need to laugh a little bit, we don&rsquo;t need too much drama. I think we just kinda wanna unplug and reset and figure out what is important in our lives. Now that we&rsquo;re by ourselves all of the time, who do we reach out to? It&rsquo;s usually family, good friends. It&rsquo;s a sense of trying to touch base with people that you love, and I think this show represents that very well,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Something that many might not know about the show yet is that some of the cast has extremely impressive musical backgrounds, including Gomez himself who was in the Broadway musical &lsquo;In The Heights&rsquo;. As to whether Gomez will be performing in the show, we still do not have an answer for that, however he did reveal that his on screen wife Lisa Vidal will be performing in the series.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The show kind of of reminds me of that movie &lsquo;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&rsquo;, you just fall in love with this family. Food and music are such a big part of our show. Lisa is an amazing singer, and you guys will see that on the show. I&rsquo;m a singer as well, we are both dancers and the fact that we are all Latin…all of this is part of our culture and we brought all that to the screen,&rdquo; he revealed.</p>
<p>Lisa Vidal, Carlos Gómez and Belissa Escobedo speak onstage for SCAD aTVfest 2020 - &ldquo;The Baker And The Beauty&rdquo; panel on February 28, 2020 in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
<p>It has been refreshing for Gomez to be a part of a series like &lsquo;The Baker and The Beauty&rsquo; because it doesn&rsquo;t portray Hispanics as the villains. This is something Gomez has had to deal with for the majority of his career, and while he was fantastic in those darker roles, this is a great change of pace for him. In fact, he started off his career in comedy, which was truly his bread and butter, however, it just so happened the roles he was mostly offered were quite the opposite. So to say Gomez was thrilled to be a part of this project is an understatement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I started my career, I started in comedy, I did mostly sit-coms…I was on &lsquo;Friends&rsquo;, so comedy was my thing. But then all of a sudden, every audition that I was going to or things that were written for Hispanics were bad guys. They were &lsquo;Narcos&rsquo;, drug dealers, they were this or that. You know, I&rsquo;m an actor, I&rsquo;m a character actor, so I just go out and do the work. So when I saw this project coming along, it was a true family drama with a Latin family, and they happened to be Cuban….it was like, BING, I have to do this project! I think it&rsquo;s time for the audiences to see a Latin family. What does it look like? It&rsquo;s like any other family, again, they just happened to be Latin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Make sure to tune into &lsquo;The Baker and The Beauty&rsquo; on Mondays at 10pm on ABC!</p>
