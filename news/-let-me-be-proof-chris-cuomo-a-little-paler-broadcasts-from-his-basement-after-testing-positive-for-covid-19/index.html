“I tested positive,” he said, with white drywalls, comfy beige armchairs and a forbidden staircase in the backdrop. “Scary, yes, as you might imagine. But better me than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout Tuesday’s episode of “Cuomo Prime Time,” the host shared his fears about the uncertainty that lies ahead for both him and the country, melding his own experience into the larger story consuming Americans.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>He wondered whether the tightness in his chest was the virus “or the choking concern of my inability to do what matters most,” to care for his family. He worried about infecting them and wondered how long it would be until he could embrace them again. But he was hesitant to talk at length about himself, feeling that his own story “is so small compared to what so many of us are facing.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Still, his first guest, a doctor and CNN’s chief medical correspondent, Sanjay Gupta, appeared visibly concerned for his friend and colleague, wanting to know more about his symptoms. “You just mentioned tightness in your chest,” said Gupta. “We don’t have to do it right now, but I’m going to call you,” Gupta said. “I’m going to ask you more about that.”</p>
<p>Cuomo insisted he was doing okay so far. He said he wanted the news of his diagnosis to serve as an example. If he could get it, he said, you could, too.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“We do not have the testing data to make real sense of our reality beyond what we know is the face of [coronavirus] for an overwhelming number who get sick,” says @chriscuomo. “That face is mine. I tested positive.” pic.twitter.com/NmkAyAx9KW — Cuomo Prime Time (@CuomoPrimeTime) April 1, 2020</p>
<p>“This is a fight. It’s going to get worse. We’re going to suffer. And you have to accept that not with fear, but with almost a fanatical sense of passion to fight. Because that’s the only way you’ve ever made it through anything hard in your life, and this will be no different. Let me be proof,” he said. “We have real vulnerability.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The show drew streams of well wishes and tears from loyal viewers Tuesday night. Even Tucker Carlson, Cuomo’s cable television arch nemesis of sorts, wished “Godspeed to the Cuomo family” during his Tuesday night show on Fox News, saying, “We are rooting for you.”</p>
<p>Some viewers thought Cuomo looked paler than usual. They thought he looked a little tired, wearing casual clothes as opposed to his usual suit and tie. But “watching @ChrisCuomo anchor despite being positive for #COVID19 is for some reason comforting and speaks to his character,” Matt Hughes, the town commissioner of Hillsborough, N.C., wrote on Twitter.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Sending @ChrisCuomo all good thoughts and really appreciate him opening his experience up to all of us. Get well soon. — Ben Stiller (@RedHourBen) April 1, 2020</p>
<p>All those gym hours will pay off my friend. Prayers from my family to yours @ChrisCuomo 🙏🏻🇺🇸❤️ https://t.co/4Kw1Q6vLwT — Matt Schlapp (@mschlapp) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>Cuomo didn’t miss a beat. His theme for the night centered on why the nation needed to take seriously the urgent pleas from government officials to stay home — using himself as the occasional Exhibit A — while bringing on guests who would drive that message home.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The first was Gupta, the doctor who has guided millions of CNN viewers through numerous public health crises, although none as big as this one. Gupta knows Cuomo personally, and that much was clear Tuesday. In between answering Cuomo’s questions, Gupta was also checking on his friend’s health, telling him, “I really feel for you.”</p>
<p>Cuomo described what he said has been the scariest feeling of all for him, one “that I didn’t realize until basically today.” And that was the lack of control. There is no proven medication to make the virus go away, Gupta said, leaving those fighting it unsure of how long the insidious illness will last.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“This is not where you want to be,” Cuomo said. “I mean, look, my basement is great. It’s not going to be a hardship. But I can’t go hug my kids. I can’t be with my family. I can’t go out and get anything for them. And I don’t know what’s going to come next. … I want people to avoid that — and the bittersweet thing, Sanjay, is that they can. They can avoid it.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>By staying home, the doctor and host agreed. It may be “our best, if not our only chance of avoiding long-term suffering,” Cuomo said.</p>
<p>Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) was the next guest. He said the federal government has provided only about 10 percent of the medical equipment his state requested. “I’m looking all over the world for ventilators. I’m purchasing every ventilator that I can find. … We’re going to run out of ventilators, and the federal government is not helping,” Pritzker said.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>But perhaps the most moving segment was with a young registered nurse named Carley Rice, who works in the intensive care unit with coronavirus patients at a hard-hit hospital in Albany, Ga.</p>
<p>There are days when she arrives at the hospital to find that patients she had been caring for the day before are gone, Rice said. There are days when she makes the FaceTime calls for patients to their families who are afraid that each one might be goodbye, because they can’t be there to hug their loved ones in person.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“With me being so young, I didn’t ever think I would see this amount of deaths all at one time,” Rice told Cuomo. “I mean you think about it — throughout your nursing career, you’re going to see a bunch of them. But all at one time … I don’t know how to explain the feelings that I have for it. I just … sorry.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“Sorry?” Cuomo responded. “Listen, you are the best of us. So many families are going to be given a gift by you that nobody else could. And it is so sad, and it is tragic, and it is wrong that that is put on you, but that is why we call you guys heroes.” He said he was only sorry that she had to be in this position.</p>
<p>“I’m not,” Rice said. “I was led here. This is my journey, and this is what God wants me to do, so I will do it with my faith and my head held high and do what I need to do for y’all’s family and my family and the community.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“With me being so young I didn’t ever think that I would see this amount of deaths all at one time,” a critical care nurse at a hard hit hospital in Georgia tells @chriscuomo in an emotional interview. “I don’t know how to explain the feelings that I have for it.” pic.twitter.com/TGPdHQ83Lb — Cuomo Prime Time (@CuomoPrimeTime) April 1, 2020</p>
<p>Cuomo looked as if he was going to cry.</p>
<p>In his closing argument minutes later, Cuomo also described the “added oddity” of watching his older brother, New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) — whom the CNN host called “Captain Banana Hands” — looking deeply concerned as he announced the diagnosis on live television.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The host urged people to not worry so much about tracking the frightening death toll and exponentially growing number of infections and to instead worry about the choices they’re making.</p>
<p>But mostly, he tried to describe that eerie feeling familiar to all of us.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if you agree with me, but more than anything else, this situation is just so weird. Right? Isn’t that the word that just keeps coming up?” he said. “We’re just like living a sci-fi thriller, and it turns out that fact is stranger than fiction, right? That’s the reality. So many of the traditional differences among us are disappearing. Why? Because we’re all in the same bucket, stuck in the house, sharing fears, sharing worries about providing and wellness and leadership. Feelings of doubt. Can this really be as daunting as everyone seems to think now?

<h3 id="chris-cuomo-says-hes-tested-positive-for-the-coronavirus-brother-andrew-cuomo-talks-about-diagnosis-of-my-best-friend">Chris Cuomo Says He’s Tested Positive For The Coronavirus; Brother Andrew Cuomo Talks About Diagnosis Of “My Best Friend”</h3>
<p><img src="https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/chris-cuomo.jpg?w=1024" alt="img">
CNN anchor Chris Cuomo said that he has tested positive for the coronavirus. He announced his diagnosis in a Twitter post Tuesday.</p>
<p>Cuomo made the announcement as his brother, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, was giving another press conference on the state’s response to the coronavirus crisis. The governor was interviewed by his brother on CNN on Monday night.</p>
<p>“Soooo in these difficult times that seem to get more difficult and complicated by the day, I just found out that I am positive for corona virus,” Chris Cuomo wrote. “I have been exposed to people in recent days who have subsequently tested positive and I had a fever, chills and shortness of breath. I just hope I didn’t give it to the kids and Cristina. That would make me feel worse than this illness!”</p>
<p>Cuomo anchored his show, Cuomo Prime Time, from the basement in his home on Monday. He has been quarantined and will continue to do his shows from there.</p>
<p>“We will all beat this by being smart and tough and united!” he wrote.</p>
<p>On Monday night, his brother actually joked with him about staying at home from the CNN workplace.</p>
<p>On his Tuesday show on Sirius XM’s POTUS Channel, Cuomo said, “You know, I knew it was just a matter of time, to be honest, because of how often I was exposed to people.”</p>
<p>He added, “I am fine. I am not the story. There are people who are in rough shape because of this, and we have got to deal with that.”</p>
<p>At his press conference Tuesday, Andrew Cuomo talked about how the virus was the “great equalizer” and announced that his brother had tested positive.</p>
<p>“He is going to be fine. He is young, in good shape, strong — not as strong as he thinks — but he will be fine,” he said. “But there is a lesson in this. He is an essential worker, a member of the press, so he has been out there. If you go out there, the chance that you have been infected is very high.”</p>
<p>He added: “He is really a sweet, beautiful guy. He is my best friend. My father was always working so it was always me and Chris.”</p>
<p>He recalled how his brother went to law school but “he never really had a desire to practice law.” He said when Chris Cuomo was 26 and working at a law firm, he told his brother that he wanted to be a journalist. Andrew Cuomo tried to tell him that it was “too late,” but that Chris went ahead. “He went to work for Fox TV, which is a whole separate conversation in the house, and then worked his way up and he’s at CNN and he does a beautiful job.” Andrew Cuomo joked that his brother told him that even his dog would not come downstairs.</p>
<p>The governor also talked about some of Chris Cuomo’s recent interactions and worries over their mother’s exposure to the virus.</p>
<p>“My mother was at his house [two weeks ago] and I said that is a mistake. Now, my mother is in a different situation. She is older and she is healthy, but I said, ‘You can’t have mom at the house,'” Andrew Cuomo said at his briefing. “And he said, ‘No, no — Mom is lonely. She wants to be in the house, she’s cooped up in the apartment.’ I said, ‘I feel bad that she is cooped up in her apartment too, but you bring her to your house and you expose her to a lot of things. … You could expose Mom to the virus.'”</p>

<p>He added, “Love is sometimes, needs to be a little smarter than just reactive, and we had a whole discussion. In truth, he’s informed, I am informed. Was that dangerous or not dangerous?”</p>
<p>The governor signed the executive order Matilda’s Law — named for their mother — on March 20, mandating business closures and other social distancing measures, with the aim of protecting vulnerable populations in particular.</p>
<p>“If my brother still had my mother at his house, again out of love and comfort … she would have been doing what she wanted to do. He would have been doing what he wanted to do. It would have seemed great and harmless, but now we’d have a much different situation, because if he was exposed, chances are she would have been exposed, and then we’d have been looking at a very different situation than just my brother sitting in his basement for two weeks.</p>
<p>“Luckily we caught it early enough .. This virus is that insidious, and we have to keep that in mind.”</p>
<p>Chris Cuomo, on his SiriusXM show, said that his brother’s criticism “is not a completely invalid point. I did have her here because I thought it was safer for her out East than in the city alone, and he did convince me to move her to my sister in Westchester a few weeks ago.”</p>
<p>He added, “We have that luxury where there was someone else who could take her. So thank God she is not affected by this.”</p>
<p>A number of network anchors and personalities have been doing their shows from their homes in recent days, as news outlets take greater steps at social distancing and keep the number of in-studio personnel to a minimum.

<h3 id="cnns-chris-cuomo-hosts-show-from-basement-after-testing-positive-for-coronavirus">CNN’s Chris Cuomo hosts show from basement after testing positive for coronavirus</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.graytvinc.com/images/0331_Chris_Cuomo_700.jpg" alt="img">
CNN anchor Chris Cuomo completed his Tuesday night show from his basement after announcing earlier in the day he had tested positive for COVID-19.</p>

<p>Cuomo said in the broadcast he hopes to serve as a cautionary tale for viewers that the best medicine is prevention.</p>
<p>“Brace yourself,” he told viewers, “not for a hoax. But for the next few weeks of scary and painful realities. This is a fight. It’s going to get worse. We’re going to suffer.”</p>
<p>Cuomo revealed in a tweet on Tuesday he’s been experiencing coronavirus symptoms. He said he had been exposed to people who had tested positive.</p>
<p>“We will all beat this by being smart and tough and united!” Cuomo said in his Twitter post.</p>
<p>“I knew it was just a matter of time, to be honest, because of how often I was exposed to people,” the 49-year-old newsman said on his SiriusXM radio show Tuesday.</p>
<p>He’s quarantining in the basement of his Long Island home, where he will continue doing his prime-time show, hoping his wife and children don’t catch Covid-19. CNN says he doesn’t need any other network personnel with him to do his show.</p>
<p>Some competitors, including Sean Hannity and Geraldo Rivera of Fox News Channel, and Joy Reid and Ali Velshi of MSNBC, sent best wishes to Cuomo through social media.</p>
<p>Andrew Cuomo, 62, and the CNN anchor are sons of the late New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, and that teasing big brother-little brother dynamic often enlivens their appearances together. The governor called him his best friend.</p>
<p>“He is going to be fine,” he said. “He’s young, in good shape, strong — not as strong as he thinks he is, but he will be fine.”</p>
<p>The state of New York has been particularly hard hit during the coronavirus pandemic, with more than 1,200 deaths, most of them in the New York City metropolitan area, according to the Associated Press.</p>
