(Updated at 3:35 p.m.) Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) is ordering residents to stay at home until June 10, except under a limited set of circumstances.</p>
<p>The order, announced Monday afternoon, takes effect immediately and is intended to dramatically slow the rapid spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. There are currently 86 reported coronavirus cases in Arlington County and 1,020 cases statewide, according to the Virginia Dept. Of Health.</p>
<p>Northam’s executive order follows a similar stay-at-home order from Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) this morning, and Northam’s March 23 order closing many businesses deemed non-essential.</p>
<p>“The message today is very clear: stay home,” Northam said. “As you go through your day to day activities and make decisions about what’s essential and not essential, think of those healthcare providers… what they’re going through every day to take care of sick folks across the country. I ask you to do the right thing.”</p>
<p>“We know that social distancing and frequent handwashing will help minimize the spread of this virus,” he added.</p>
<p>More from a press release:</p>
<p>Governor Ralph Northam today issued a statewide Stay at Home order to protect the health and safety of Virginians and mitigate the spread of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19. The executive order takes effect immediately and will remain in place until June 10, 2020, unless amended or rescinded by a further executive order. The order directs all Virginians to stay home except in extremely limited circumstances. Individuals may leave their residence for allowable travel, including to seek medical attention, work, care for family or household members, obtain goods and services like groceries, prescriptions, and others as outlined in Executive Order Fifty-Three, and engage in outdoor activity with strict social distancing requirements. The executive order also directs all Virginia institutions of higher education to stop in-person classes and instruction. Private campgrounds must close for short-term stays, and beaches will be closed statewide except for fishing and exercise. “We are in a public health crisis, and we need everyone to take this seriously and act responsibly,” said Governor Northam. “Our message to Virginians is clear: stay home. We know this virus spreads primarily through human-to-human contact, and that’s why it’s so important that people follow this order and practice social distancing. I’m deeply grateful to everyone for their cooperation during this unprecedented and difficult time.”</p>
<p>Under Northam’s executive order, the following will still be allowed:</p>
<p>Exercising outside while maintaining social distancing</p>
<p>Going to grocery stores, pharmacies and other essential businesses for food, drinks and other supplies</p>
<p>Seeking medical attention, social services or emergency help</p>
<p>Taking care of people, animals, or visiting family</p>
<p>Going to and from work, an educational institution or a house of worship</p>
<p>Volunteering or providing social services</p>
<p>Providing food for pickup or delivery</p>
<p>“Nothing in this Order shall limit: (a) the provision of health care or medical services; (b) access to essential services for low-income residents, such as food banks; (c) the operations of the media; (d) law enforcement agencies; or (e) the operation of government,” the executive order also said.</p>
<p>The order makes “all public and private in-person gatherings of more than ten individuals,” including “parties, celebrations, religious, or other social events, whether they occur indoor or outdoor,” a Class 1 misdemeanor, which is punishable by up to a year in jail and a fine up to $2,500. The operation of businesses deemed essential is excluded from prohibition, as is a gathering of family members who live in the same residence.</p>
<p>Local officials urged residents to take the order seriously and stay at home.</p>
<p>Take note: this is serious. Do your part. Stay home, save lives. https://t.co/kRVUWa2XJx — Rep. Don Beyer (@RepDonBeyer) March 30, 2020

Washington, D.C. joined Maryland and Virginia in enacting &ldquo;stay-at-home&rdquo; mandates Monday amid the coronavirus outbreak. They join states like New York, New Jersey, California and Washington — all among the hardest hit by the spread of COVID-19 — in locking down residents&rsquo; movements. The U.S. counts the most coronavirus cases of any country, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, with more than 153,200 confirmed cases of the virus and at least 2,828 deaths. With more than half of U.S. states now ordering residents to stay at home, more restrictions could be down the line. Here&rsquo;s what each place announced Monday:</p>

<p>Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser issued a stay-at-home order for the nation&rsquo;s capital on Monday. Those found guilty of violating the order, which is considered a misdemeanor, could be subject to a fine of up to $5,000 and face imprisonment of no more than 90 days, according to Bowser. Residents of the city are still allowed to leave their homes to perform an essential job and for essential activities such as obtaining food or medicine. People are also able to engage in certain outdoor recreational activities. &ldquo;Many people want to know how they can help right now, and for most people this is how – by staying home,&rdquo; Bowser said in a tweet about the order. Washington, D.C. has 401 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, according to the city. The capital has a population of more than 705,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>

<p>Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam issued a statewide stay-at-home order that is effective immediately. The order extends until June 10, making it one of the longest statewide mandates implemented so far. The order follows a weekend during which beaches were packed, Northam said at a press briefing. He advised residents that they should now only leave their homes for groceries, medical treatment, work or exercise. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go to the store for just one thing,&rdquo; Northam said. &ldquo;Wait until you have a list. If you&rsquo;re traveling from out of state, stay in quarantine for 14 days. Every age group needs to act responsibly and stay home.&rdquo; He said that people would not be thrown in jail for disobeying the order, but that police would be enforcing the new restrictions. Virginia has more than 1,000 coronavirus cases, almost half of which are people under 50, according to Northam.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.nbcwashington.com/2019/09/Ralph-Northam-1.jpg?resize=1200%2C675" alt="img">
What to Know Residents of Virginia must stay at home unless they are getting food, medical attention or help from law enforcement, among other essentials.</p>
<p>The state does allow residents to go outside to take care of loved ones and animals, travel to child care, exercise, travel to work and volunteer with charitable groups.</p>
<p>Those who fail to comply could face a Class 1 misdemeanor punishable by up to $2,500 and a year in prison.</p>
<p>Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam issued an executive order telling Virginians to stay at home effective immediately.</p>
<p>Northam said he issued the order because people are not following guidelines they remain in their residences. He noted large crowds of people gathering at beaches and other places over the weekend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are being very, very selfish,&rdquo; Northam said. &ldquo;You are putting all of us, especially our health care providers, at risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those who fail to comply could face a Class 1 misdemeanor punishable by up to $2,500 and a year in prison.</p>
<p>All people in Virginia must stay at home unless they are getting food, medical attention or help from law enforcement, among other essentials.</p>
<p>The state does allow residents to go outside to take care of loved ones and animals, travel to child care, exercise, travel to work and volunteer with charitable groups.</p>
<p>Also, you can leave home “due to a reasonable fear for health or safety.”</p>
<p>Additionally, stays of less than 14 nights at private campgrounds are closed as of April 1. Public beaches are closed except for exercising and fishing.</p>
<p>All institutions of higher learning in the commonwealth must stop in person classes and instruction. The commonwealth must wait to see how much money it gets from the federal government before determining if and how universities can be assisted.</p>
<p>Prisoners who are old or were sentenced before 1996 may be eligible for early release. But it needs to be determined if there is a home health plan in place for those inmates.</p>
<p>The order is in effect until June 10 and could be extended or rescinded by another executive order.</p>
<p>All restaurants must only offer takeout, delivery or drive-thru service, under an executive order that went into place March 23. Dining rooms, food courts, breweries, distilleries, wineries, tasting rooms and farmers markets must close.</p>
<p>All recreational and entertainment businesses also must remain closed, per the March 23 order. These include bowling alleys, theaters, fitness centers and race tracks.</p>
<p>Any “personal care services” that cannot adhere to social distancing also must remain closed, including barbershops, massage parlors and spas.</p>
<p>Businesses allowed to remain open include: grocery stores, pharmacies, dollar stores, electronics stores, auto part stores, liquor stores, gas stations, banks, pet food stores and laundromats.</p>
<p>All non-essential stores can remain open but are limited to having only 10 patrons at a time. They must “adhere to social distancing and increase sanitization.” Any gatherings of 10 or more people are prohibited.</p>
<p>Virginia has 18,000 hospital beds, including 2,000 in intensive care units. A field hospital has been established in a parking garage at the University of Mary Washington. An old dorm at Virginia Commonwealth University is being used as a hospital. Lonesome Pine Hospital in southwest Virginia is being used for acute and emergency care.</p>
<p>Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan also issued a stay-at-home order Monday, effective at 8 p.m.
