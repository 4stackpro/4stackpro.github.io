<h3 id="watch-david-bowies-creepy-rare-video-for-repetition-97">WATCH David Bowie’s Creepy Rare Video for ‘Repetition ’97’</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nova.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/maxresdefault-13.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<p>A music video for David Bowie’s previously unreleased 1997 redo of ‘Repetition’ has arrived online.</p>
<p>‘Reptition’ originally appeared in the late 70’s on his ‘Lodger’ album and this new video is compiled from clips of rehearsals for Bowie’s 1997 “Earthling Tour” in Hartford Connecticut by Tim Pope. The audio version of the track is also available to stream now.</p>
<p>It’s a bit creepy looking as it features slightly offset doubled images of Bowie’s face, the kind of thing in the old days you’d hit the side of the TV for to sharpen up the picture!</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>‘Repetition ’97’ is taken from ‘ChangesNowBowie’ and was set to arrive for Record Store Day April 17. Its release is now postponed with RSD until June 20.</p>
<p>The collection will still receive a digital release on the original date April 17.</p>
<p>‘ChangesNowBowie’ is an unreleased nine-track album, recorded for radio and broadcast by the BBC on David’s 50th birthday on 8th January, 1997. The broadcast featured an interview with David by Mary Anne Hobbs interspersed with specially recorded birthday messages and questions from the likes of Scott Walker, Damon Albarn, Bono, Robert Smith and many more. This mostly acoustic session was a stripped back affair featuring some of David’s favourites of his own compositions and was produced by Bowie himself, Reeves Gabrels and Mark Plati.</p>
<p>‘ChangesNowBowie’ was recorded and mixed at Looking Glass Studios in New York in November 1996. Gail Ann Dorsey (bass, vocals), Reeves Gabrels (guitars, vocals) and Mark Plati (keyboards and programming) accompanied David on the recording.</p>
<p>The cover art for the album features a stunning black and white portrait of David by renowned photographer Albert Watson, taken in New York in 1996.</p>

<h3 id="the-moment-david-bowie-performed-with-marc-bolan-just-days-before-his-death-1977">The moment David Bowie performed with Marc Bolan just days before his death, 1977</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/faroutmagazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/article-2223980-15A9AA3C000005DC-324_634x523.jpg?fit=634%2C523&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
Just seven days before the tragic death of the legendary Marc Bolan, the mercurial glam rock singer asked one of his fellow superstars to join him on stage as part of his ongoing television show Marc. That someone was the enigmatic David Bowie.</p>
<p>The pair, widely lauded as the fathers of glam rock, if not modern rock and roll as we know it, first met back in 1964 when young David Jones was on the same roster of manager Leslie Conn, as the young Mark Feld. Conn had put the pair of prospects to work on painting an office for him.</p>
<p>When he returned from lunch he found the pair missing and only half the walls painted. It was the beginning of a beautiful and mischievous relationship. They littered Carnaby Street with their hopes and dreams of becoming pop stars—it was an intoxicating mix.</p>
<p>Despite high hopes, the pair spent most of the 1960s in rags but the ’70s would see the pair on top together if only for a hideously short while. The two of them trading ideas and songs with the same affection as brothers swapping football stickers.</p>
<p>Bowie‘s song for Bolan, ‘Lady Stardust’, was not only depicting a space-age traveller but Bolan himself and with it, Bowie laid the precursor to his own alien rock star Ziggy Stardust.</p>
<p>As the rise and fall of glam rock came and went Bolan found himself in serious trouble. He had lost the vigour and verve which had made him a star, he was back to gigantic album titles, LPs which didn’t chart and off-record the star lived on a diet of cocaine and brandy.</p>
<p>As the glitter stopped falling from the sky, the party had moved on and Bolan had lost his sparkle. Bowie, on the other hand, was flying high (in so many ways) on the success of numerous progressive albums, breaking America and generally being received as a king among men wherever he went.</p>
<p>The pair reunited in early 1977 as Bowie was on his tour with Iggy Pop. Staying with Bolan at his London apartment, the pair went on to half-record a track titled ‘Madman’ which Bolan claimed was going to be the centre of his next record. The only version we have is a ferocious, vicious and seductive piece of music and sounded much like the beginning of something new and spectacular for Bolan.</p>
<p>It was the shot in the arm Bolan needed and by the summer of ’77 he was clean and back on form. With the wave of punk crashing through the streets, Bolan felt rejuvenated and engaged again, he was writing songs and was on the way up.</p>
<p>Landing the lucrative role as host of a TV variety show with TV network Granada, Bolan brought on some incredible acts like The Jam, X-Ray Spex, the Boomtown Rats, Generation X—but there was only one man for the finale, his old friend, David Bowie.</p>
<p>Although the taping had its issues, with Bolan feeling quite put out as Bowie directed and orchestrated his performance of ‘Heroes’ leaving Bolan out in the cold, the performance was an all-around success. The issues arose as Bowie became consumed by achieving the right sound and Bolan felt aggrieved by Bowie’s lack of respect. With the latter’s security then stopping Marc from even reaching the stage while Bowie continued to work. As the taping began the pair were barely speaking.</p>
<p>But as ever, one thing would save them; the music. The pair duel over their pre-dictated jam session song (which some call ‘Sleeping Next To You’ or Standing Next To You’) equals in the middle of the stage fiercely playing their guitars and enjoying the spotlight. The great reunion would end in laughter though as Bolan went to strike a move and fell off the stage and Bowie cracked up. It broke the tension and the two of them would make up later that night over dinner. Bowie was off on his worldwide tours and Bolan was determined to put himself at the centre of the music scene yet again with his new record.</p>
<p>Just a week later, Bolan and his girlfriend, Gloria Jones, went out for a night of drinking. At five in the morning, Jones crashed Bolan’s Mini GT into a tree on Barnes Common, striking the tree with enough force to kill Bolan almost instantly. He would never see is 30th birthday and never make that all important record.</p>
