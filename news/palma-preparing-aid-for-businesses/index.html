Councillor Antoni Noguera. 24-01-2020 Javier Jiménez</p>
<p>Shares:</p>
<p>Antoni Noguera, Palma&rsquo;s culture and social welfare councillor, says that once the state of alarm is lifted there will be a series of measures for business sectors affected by the crisis.</p>
<p>Noguera was responding to calls from tourism, restaurant and retail for urgent aid in the form of, for example, the immediate suspension of the payment of taxes. &ldquo;We are aware of the needs of the city and that aid will be required. Each area (of the town hall) is working on providing this for sectors such as retail, tourism, restaurants, housing, culture, social welfare, etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Businesses have drawn attention to the fact that the town hall has established grants totalling 408,000 euros for residents federations and associations. These grants are to be paid over the next few days, and yet there have been no provisions for business.</p>
<p>Noguera insists that it is &ldquo;not appropriate&rdquo; to start comparing figures. &ldquo;Everything can become very demagogic if we start to compare. A significant amount of money is being allocated to financial aid for social cohesion and the well-being of families. The town hall has a clear premise; it is together with the citizens.&rdquo;

<h3 id="very-few-stores-are-open-in-palma-because-of-covid-19">Very few stores are open in Palma because of Covid-19</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.majorcadailybulletin.com/sfAttachPlugin/32381.jpg" alt="img">
Shares:</p>
<p>Costa d’en Brossa, Carrer dels Paraires and Pas d’en Quint lie between Carrer de Sant Nicolau between Cort and Passeig del Born and are home to a number of Palma&rsquo;s chic boutiques.</p>
<p>It’s where the city’s well-heeled and affluent like to shop and is usually one of the busiest neighbourhoods in the city, but because of the State of Emergency, only two stores are open, La Pajarita delicatessen and chocolate shop and Forn del Sant Crist.</p>
<p>La Pajarita opened in 1872 and Javier Mulet who’s the co-owner, passes by the store from time to time during the coronavirus lockdown but prefers to stay in his house in Sencelles.</p>
<p>His son José was in the shop on Tuesday and spent most of his time doing end of month paperwork.</p>
<p>A few meters away, a truck has just unloaded several pallets in front of Scarpe d&rsquo;Italia, a shoe store that specialises in imported footwear which was opened by Eustaquio eleven years ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have orders that were made in September and yesterday I was notified of this delivery,” he says, adding “its next summer&rsquo;s fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>90% of Estaquio’s clientele are tourists and he admits that because there won’t be any this year he fears for the future, saying &ldquo;here we go crazy with prices&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a popular spot that costs 3,000 euros to rent and he has renewed his lease twice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have noticed that a lot of businesses are changing here; I&rsquo;ve seen eight changes in the last few months, &ldquo;he says.</p>
<p>There are no letters for him today and it’s a different postman for the second day in a row.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My usual area is Sant Francesc but we only have half the workforce so there is no regular postman,” says Bernat.</p>
<p>Relax in Palma</p>
<p>They are cleaning and disinfecting Costa d’en Brossa and were it not for the coronavirus restrictions it would be possible to check for replica gas masks from the Second World War in a store dedicated to collectors of Army paraphernalia, from weapons to uniforms to books, but on Tuesday the shop is closed.</p>
<p>Stick no bills is also closed. It specialises in postcards and travel posters and has a retro getaway poster in the window which is a reproduction of a gin advertisement that says “Relax in the city”.</p>
<p>Chopin&rsquo;s bust, which sits in the small square dedicated to the Polish composer was erected to celebrate the 180th anniversary of his arrival in Majorca.</p>
<p>Xisco crosses paths with Chopin as he delivers an Eroski order. He buzzes the intercom and the customers open the door for him, but his job is more complicated during the coronavirus lockdown</p>
<p>&ldquo;We go upstairs and leave the order at the door but we don&rsquo;t go into the houses,&rdquo; he says.

<p><img src="https://www.majorcadailybulletin.com/sfAttachPlugin/32507.jpg" alt="img">
National Police in Palma. 25-03-2020 Alejandro Sepulveda</p>
<p>Shares:</p>
<p>Between Wednesday and Thursday, there were seven arrests in Palma for disobeying the confinement measures.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night, Palma police came across a 31-year-old man who was walking along a street with three other people. He had already been reported on three previous occasions for breaching the state of alarm restrictions.</p>
<p>Around midday on Wednesday, a 24-year-old man went to a supermarket with his partner. A security guard told him to observe safety measures, but he reacted violently before running off and being apprehended by the National Police.</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening, a couple, aged 50 and 54, were walking on a street without good reason, having been sanctioned some hours before for the same reason. They were not from Palma but from what the National Police say was a &ldquo;pueblo in the Raiguer area&rdquo; of Majorca.</p>
<p>In the early hours of Thursday, the National Police detained a man and a woman, aged 34 and 31, on Calle General Riera. They were on the public way without good reason and were drinking; they had also been sanctioned earlier on.</p>
<p>A 34-year-old man who claimed that he was out shopping was detained; he wasn&rsquo;t carrying any shopping bags and didn&rsquo;t have any products on him.
