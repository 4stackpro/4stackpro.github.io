Non-banking financial companies (NBFC) are in a fix after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) asked all financial institutions to offer a three-month moratorium to borrowers. Many NBFCs may need to service their debt obligations towards banks, mutual funds and other financial institutions, they said.</p>
<p>Finance Industry Development Council (FIDC), an industry body representing NBFCs, has written to the RBI and the ministry of finance raising concerns about this. NBFCs have different sources of funding, including term loans from banks and issuance of papers to investors.</p>
<p>The RBI notification on 27 March after its monetary policy review said financial institutions are “permitted&rdquo; to grant a moratorium, meaning it is at the discretion of banks to give a moratorium.</p>
<p>“We have reasons to believe that banks would be choosy and picky in deciding which NBFC to give a moratorium. They may use different parameters, such as credit ratings, to decide the moratorium. We want RBI and finance ministry to make the moratorium mandatory for all term loans outstanding as on 1 March 2020,&rdquo; said Raman Aggarwal, co-chairman, FIDC.</p>
<p>It means banks can decide to give a moratorium to NBFCs that are rated AAA or AA, while asking others to continue repayment.</p>
<p>According to the industry body, most small- and mid-size NBFCs rely heavily on loans from banks. These companies can face issues if banks decide not to give them a moratorium and pressurize them to service their debt obligations. Some small- and mid-size NBFCs that Mint spoke to said that they have asked their lending bank to offer a moratorium. They spoke on the condition of anonymity, as they were still negotiating with their lenders and also talking to the regulator. The banks have, however, refused to provide any relief so far.</p>
<p>According to NBFCs, they cannot refuse a moratorium to their customers as many of them belong to the part of the society that will be worst affected due to the lockdown. A majority of customers that small- and mid-size NBFCs cater to are low-income earners such as drivers and small shopkeepers. Banks may also provide fresh loans to only a few high-rated NBFCs. “We have seen the same happening after the IL&amp;FS default. Banks revoked the credit line and stopped lending. We can’t take it for granted that banks will continue to lend us amid this coronavirus crisis. We want RBI and FM to ensure that NBFCs continue to get new term loans just like they did prior to the covid-19 pandemic,&rdquo; said Aggarwal.</p>
<p>According to Aggarwal, if the banks refuse a moratorium to NBFCs, it may not lead to defaults. “They will continue to meet their obligations and service their debts. But they may need to take short term loans and opt for other options that can create an asset-liability mismatch.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="why-rbi-moratorium-on-your-credit-card-dues-is-a-bad-idea">Why RBI moratorium on your credit card dues is a bad idea</h3>
<p><img src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/btmt/images/stories/rbi_banks_505x264_200220094745_030320031547_180320053348_310320115442.jpg" alt="img">
The Reserve Bank of India has allowed banks to offer a moratorium of three months on not just term but also on credit card loans for the period between March 1 and May 30. Before you go for it, you must understand moratorium doesn&rsquo;t mean waiver of your credit card bill or EMIs. It only means no repayments for the three months, but interest on your credit card dues and loan outstanding will keep accruing each month. The only respite will be that your credit score will not be hit. Since interest rate on credit cards could be as high as 40 per cent, deferring the repayments could cost you a bomb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Credit card debt is unsecured and costly. The annualised rate of interest on credit card debt can easily be in the 40 per cent range, which is a lot compared to secured debt - home loans, for example, are currently priced around 8 per cent. Those who don&rsquo;t have ongoing liquidity problems can continue their repayments since they have little to gain by paying additional interest on an already pricey debt,&rdquo; says Adhil Shetty, CEO of BankBazaar.com.</p>
<p>Credit card payment start-up CRED explains this with an example:</p>
<p>If you have Rs 1,00,000 due as on March 3, 2020 and you take advantage of the moratorium till May 31, 2020, the dues payable on June 3, 2020 could be as high as Rs 1,15,000 &ndash; Rs 1,00,000 (due amount) + Rs 15,000 (interest amount and other charges).</p>
<p>You may have to shell out the entire amount right after the end of moratorium, otherwise penalty/late payment charges will kick in. If you pay the minimum due, you may avoid the late payment charges but interest rate will be levied on the outstanding amount.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should continue paying your total due amount (or as much as is possible) within the due date to avoid interest charges at 36 - 42 per cent compounding annual interest rate,&rdquo; says Kunal Shah, founder and CEO, CRED.</p>
<p>So, if your payment is due anytime soon, you must approach your bank immediately and inquire about two things: Is the RBI moratorium mandatory for all borrowers or optional? If it is optional, you should make the payment by the due date. If it is mandatory or you are facing a cash crunch, you must check with them the details and conditions of the moratorium, especially rate of interest being applied and timing of the repayment. &ldquo;You need to see the rate of return being applied by card providers during the break. Also check if they will recover the interest immediately after May 31,&rdquo; suggests Shetty.</p>
<p>If your credit card dues are substantial and you cannot pay it off right now, instead of opting for moratorium, you may take some personal loan to clear out your dues. &ldquo;If your credit card bill may take a year or longer to pay off, do the interest math. Personal loan rates start from around 10 per cent and may be cheaper in the long run. But, you must be a smart borrower with stable income to be able to pay off one debt with another,&rdquo; says Shetty.</p>

<h3 id="coronavirus-impact-sbi-to-defer-your-emi-by-three-months">Coronavirus impact: SBI to defer your EMI by three months</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.livemint.com/img/2020/03/31/600x338/PTI30-03-2020_000065B_1585668757991_1585668773139.jpg" alt="img">
New Delhi: Customers who receive EMI payment notice at the beginning of every month can heave a sigh of relief as banks have decided to defer receiving such payments for a period of three months under the terms of a Covid 19- RBI package announced on Friday.</p>
<p>Several banks, including State Bank of India, sent tweets on Tuesday informing the customers that they have deferred payment of EMIs of housing loan, vehicle loans, MSME loans and payment of all other term loans whose installments are due after March 1 and up to May 31 by three months.</p>
<p>The system of deferment will function automatically as most banks would not raise demand for EMIs for next three months. The repayment period post the moratorium will also get extended accordingly.</p>
<p>The scheme would be available to all borrowers having standard account with the bank, meaning they have no record on default in the past.</p>
<p>However, customers who do not want to defer their EMIs and want to continue paying their loan instalment will have to inform banks that they don&rsquo;t need to utilise the moratorium on payments.</p>
<p>Banks have also issued mailers and put FAQs on their sites informing the customers about the scheme.</p>
<p>It is expected that several customers may opt out of the EMI deferment as during the the said moratorium period, interest shall continue to accrue on the outstanding portion of the term loan. The interest accrued will be added to the outstanding loan amount and the repayment schedule for such loans as also the residual tenor, will be shifted across the board by three months after the moratorium period.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bank of Baroda is providing a moratorium of 3 months on payment of a ll instalments falling due between 01.03.20 &amp; 31.05.20 for all term loans in cluding corporate, MSME, agriculture, retail, housing, auto, personal loans, etc. in pursuance of the RBI COVID-19 Regulatory Package,&rdquo; the PSU bank said in a tweet.</p>
<p>Analysts and experts tracking the sector said that simple interest rate would be calculated by banks for the three-month period in which loan repayment was due but was not paid under the moratorium. This would be added up into your EMIs at the end of three-month forbearance, raising your monthly bill.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re deferring payment of an EMI of, say ₹1,000, and the bank is charging interest at the rate 10 per cent on outstanding, you will end up paying ₹25 extra on each of the three EMIs that has not been paid during the moratorium. This additional interest may either be added up to all your future EMIs or your loan tenure could get extended at the same EMI level.</p>
<p>While the clarity has not been offered by banks, the EMI deferment would actually benefit customers to defer two instalments falling due in the months of April and May as from June regular EMI payment will start with the instalment getting higher (including principal and interest two months instalment) or if EMI is maintained at original level, the tenure of repayment gets extended as additional interest gets adjusted in all future EMIs.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank Governor Shaktikanta Das on Friday announced a three-month moratorium on EMIs of all term loans due during March 1 to May 31 and said that the repayment schedule for all those loans would be shifted by three months after the moratorium.</p>
<p>This will bring relief to all borrowers, including those who have home loans, auto loans, education loans, agricultural term loans, retail and crop loans to their names. It will also be applicable on credit card dues.</p>
<p>As of January-end, over ₹13 lakh crore of housing loans and ₹2 lakh crore of auto loans were outstanding, data with the Reserve bank of India shows.</p>
<p>Besides retail borrowers, micro, small and medium enterprises and large companies will also benefit from the RBI&rsquo;s relaxation of loan repayment.</p>
