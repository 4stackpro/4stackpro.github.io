<p>People are remembering quotes and dialogues from his last movie Chhichore, which was ironically about his Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s character encouraging his son to fight suicidal thought and teaching him how to accept failure. Netizens are urging, anyone who is dealing with suicidal thoughts, depressive feelings or anxiety must reach out to their loved ones. People must vent out their feelings to not be pushed towards something as scary as suicide. Take a look at some of the #MentalHealthMatters tweets:</p>
<p>If you are feeling stressed, talk to someone. If you are feeling anxious, talk to someone. If you feel like you have symptoms of depression, please talk to someone. Prioritise yourself.

Another one of his dialogues from Chhichore that can be used as life quote is &ldquo;Success Ke Baad Ka Plan Sabke Paas Hai &hellip; Lekin Agar Galti Se Fail Ho Gaye &hellip; Toh Failure Se Kaise Deal Karna Hai &hellip; Iski Koi Baat Hi Nahi Karna Chahta.&rdquo;</p>
