<p>While Vermont schools are awaiting guidance from the state on reopening in the fall, many have already started taking steps to prepare.</p>
<p>Rutland City Public Schools staff have been meeting to discuss health, technology needs and the possible daily schedule for students. The planning group has been piecing together ideas from other states, even internationally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other advantage is, internationally there are countries &ndash; for example Japan &ndash; where this process started much earlier, so they are further along in the reopening process. So, they&rsquo;ve been able to provide us with some insight on things that worked in reopening and things that have not,&rdquo; said Gregory Schillinger, the associate principal at Rutland High School.</p>
<p>The Rutland City Public Schools have done this through online and emailing.</p>

<p>Promotional material for fight nights presented by Randy Felion of Rutland.</p>
<p>RUTLAND — A night of mixed martial arts fighting in Rutland was canceled by its organizer on Monday after state officials had sent a cease-and-desist order.</p>
<p>Randy Felion, the owner of Fight Night Promotions, had planned to hold the event June 20, but officials said it violated the state’s prohibition on close-contact sporting events, which are banned to prevent the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p>In a letter sent Friday, the offices of the Attorney General and Secretary of State said legal action would be pursued against Felion if he did not immediately comply.</p>
<p>Get all of VTDigger&rsquo;s daily news. You&rsquo;ll never miss a story with our daily headlines in your inbox.</p>
<p>Late Monday, the Attorney General’s Office reported “it is our understanding the event has now been cancelled.”</p>
<p>Felion could not be reached for immediate comment Monday evening, nor had the company’s website been updated with cancellation information.</p>
<p>Felion told VTDigger last week that the event would feature 22 mixed martial arts fighters from Vermont and upstate New York.</p>
<p>In addition, Felion said he had already sold 40 tickets to spectators, who would have gathered to watch 11 matches take place at an undisclosed outdoor location on private property in Rutland. He planned to cap ticket sales at 40 to allow space for spectators to socially distance.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, matches were held at Rutland’s Holiday Inn every two months, an inn employee confirmed. The most recent event took place there in mid-March.</p>
<p>Fight Night Promotions has gained a following of more than 1,300 fans on Facebook since its conception a year ago.</p>
<p>VTDigger is underwritten by:</p>
<p>Felion said he has contacted the governor’s office in an attempt to gain permission for Fight Night, explaining that he planned to disinfect the cage, and that all attendees and fighters not involved in an ongoing match would socially distance and wear masks.</p>
<p>“They actually agreed with that, and told me that they really couldn’t tell me ‘no,’” Felion said last week. “They said they had to go and put it in front of people and get the OK. But even if they said ‘no,’ the guy on the phone told me there’s really nothing that they can really do. I mean, I’m gonna be doing my show on private property.”</p>
<p>Felion said interpreted the response he received from the state as a go-ahead for the event.</p>
<p>“There’s a bunch of protesting in Rutland, there’s day care open,” Felion said, adding that his child is currently enrolled in local day care. “They’re screening the kids when they come through the door, and that’s what we’re going to do.”</p>
<p>But the letter, signed by Christopher Curtis, chief of the Public Protection Division, and Lauren Hibbert, director of the Office of Professional Regulation, said Felion had not obtained permission for this event, or any others, from the appropriate offices.</p>
<p>Curtis and Hibbert outlined Scott’s executive order 01-20, which bans “high contact sports, or those which necessitate significant, longer-duration, close contact (e.g. wrestling, basketball, football).” Vermont’s state of emergency, which was set to expire June 15, was extended to July 15 on Monday.</p>
<p>Promotional material for a June 20 Fight Night in Rutland.</p>
<p>At least 64 people would have attended the June 20 event, including spectators, fighters, Felion and a cameraman, who would post the fight to YouTube. That number violated a government order limiting gatherings to 25 people.</p>
<p>Officials from the Agency of Commerce and Community Development had conveyed this information to Felion by phone and Facebook message before they sent the cease-and-desist order, the letter said.</p>
<p>Felion had until noon on Monday to tell Assistant Attorney General Ryan Kane whether he would comply by canceling future events. He did not respond to VTDigger’s request for comment Monday morning.</p>
<p>Had he refused, the Attorney General’s and Secretary of State’s offices warned they would “commence legal proceedings to compel termination of the fighting events” and “levy appropriate legal sanctions.”</p>
<p>The letter indicated that Felion may not be able to hold events in the future.</p>
<p>Other than a potential violation of the emergency executive order, past matches have been “grossly inconsistent with legal and regulatory requirements,” the letter said.</p>
<p>Felion has not registered any matches or participants with the Office of Professional Regulation, nor has he registered himself as a promoter. Both are mandated by state law.</p>
<p>Fight organizers are also required to host a health care provider “continuously present at ringside,” along with ambulance and medical personnel who must have resuscitation equipment on hand. According to the letter, Felion has never complied with these regulations.</p>
<p>VTDigger is underwritten by:</p>
<p>“Most troubling,” the letter reads, “your promotions feature child fighters who explain in promotional videos their intention to ‘choke out’ opponents.” Minors are not legally allowed to participate in professional fighting matches.</p>
<p>A violation of the emergency executive order is classified as a criminal misdemeanor and punishable by up to six months in prison, along with a fine of up to $500.</p>
<p>Felion now may be subject to administrative, civil and criminal sanctions resulting from unauthorized promoting, the letter said, and could be prohibited from registering future events.</p>

<h3 id="hope-against-cancer-calls-upon-the-people-of-leicestershire-and-rutland-to-help-beat-cancer">&ldquo;Hope Against Cancer calls upon the people of Leicestershire and Rutland to help beat cancer&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.news-medical.net/image.axd?picture=2020%2f6%2fCap4turge_e6c54cdf0f104cd7b4d0f45b0bfa90b6-620x480.jpg" alt="img">
Hope Against Cancer is doubling the size of their Clinical Trials Facility at Leicester’s Royal Infirmary - and are calling upon the people of Leicestershire and Rutland to help them do it.</p>
<p>Funding research is the only way to beat cancer, and Hope is at the forefront of giving people a better quality of life and a vastly higher chance of surviving the disease. The Hope for Life Appeal is well underway and is your chance to be part of a local movement against cancer - if you don’t want to miss out, you need to get involved.</p>
<p>The Hope For Life Appeal is aiming to raise over £1.5 million to totally redevelop and extend the Hope Clinical Trials Facility. Every year, around 5,000 people are diagnosed with cancer in Leicestershire. Thanks to organisations like Hope, of this 5,000, more people than ever are surviving. Hope For Life is the next step in making sure the number of people surviving cancer continues to rise.</p>
<p>Hope Against Cancer would like to thank a number of very generous donors across the Leicestershire and Rutland community, which has already raised an impressive £1 million towards the £1.5 million goal. The Charity reached the million-pound mark recently with help from The Randal Charitable Foundation, following a generous donation of £101,000. The Loughborough-based Foundation has a clear, unwavering vision that is to save lives, help the socially disadvantaged and improve the quality of life for those in need in the UK and around the world.</p>
<p>Opened in 2012, the Hope Clinical Trials Facility is one of the country’s leading centers for cancer trials in the last few years.</p>
<p>We’re really grateful to Hope Against Cancer for its continued support of the Facility and our research. It is the success of the center that has driven demand - and we’ve reached our full capacity as a result. Doubling the space at the Facility will mean we can offer many more patients further opportunities to take part in clinical trials, testing potential new drugs and treatments with the aim to extend lives, improve quality of life and, ultimately, improve outcomes for patients living with cancer today and in the future.” Professor Anne Thomas, clinical lead for the Hope Clinical Trials Facility at the hospital, and Professor of Oncology at the University of Leicester</p>
<p>Despite the current challenges we are all facing due to COVID-19, the charity is making great headway with Phase 1, which is happening over at the University of Leicester’s Robert Kilpatrick Clinical Sciences Building, located at the Leicester Royal Infirmary. It is here that much of the life-saving research takes place.</p>
<p>The objective for this space is to increase its capacity and to bring it to an excellent standard and an environment conducive to the researchers and the work which takes place here.</p>
<p>All main construction for phase 1 has now been completed. Phase 2 will happen at the Clinical Trials Facility and the charity and partners are being guided by the government as to when they can commence.</p>
<p>Research has shown that having clinical research in a hospital providing cancer treatment improves the overall standard of care for patients receiving treatment both in and out of clinical trials. This means a new facility could have a wider impact on all patients being treated for cancer across the system.</p>
<p>Hope is calling on people to start fundraising and help them achieve their fundraising target. In the past, local people have organised events, sporting challenges, competitions, bake sales, bike rides and a host of other activities to generate cash for the charity’s life-saving work. It is of course a challenging time but the charity has been truly impressed at the innovative way in which their supporters have continued to fundraise.</p>
<p>Nigel Rose, Hope’s CEO since 2013, is full of confidence that the people of our counties will be able to raise the required funds: “If there’s one area of the UK that can raise the money the Hope For Life Appeal is asking for, it’s the communities in Leicestershire and Rutland. Many people’s lives are affected by cancer, and it’s a testament to them that Hope is what it is today. The Hope For Life Appeal is the next step in our journey.”</p>
<p>The money raised by Hope’s supporters will not only go towards doubling the capacity of the Clinical Trials Facility but to purchasing new equipment and will be transformational for local cancer research in the future.</p>
<p>Historically, local citizens have always risen to the challenge to ensure Hope Against Cancer delivers its vital research. If you’ve been moved by the charity’s ambition and need to get this done for local cancer patients, you can add your fundraising power to the Hope For Life Appeal by visiting Hope’s social media pages here: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn or donate through the Hope for Life Appeal website: <a href="https://hopeforlife.charity">https://hopeforlife.charity</a>

In Rutland, Black Lives Matter supporters gathered in the Main Street Park for a peaceful Protest on Sunday.</p>
<p>The president of the Rutland NAACP, Tabitha Moore was the first speaker of the afternoon for the protest that was a call to action according to organizers.</p>
<p>Tables were set up for people to register to vote and learn how to become more involved.</p>
<p>After the protest in the park, people marched at Rutland High School, in support of keeping the Black Lives Matter flag up which is set to be taken down soon. It was raised with the agreement that it would fly for 400 days. The 400 days ended in May, and the Rutland City Public Schools Board of Commissioners have not agreed to continue flying it.</p>

<h3 id="pandemic-spurs-redevelopment-plan-in-downtown-rutland">&ldquo;Pandemic spurs redevelopment plan in downtown Rutland&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.graytvinc.com/images/rutland33.jpg" alt="img">
Stores and shops are opening up around Vermont but with limits set by the state to keep the coronavirus in check. Our Olivia Lyons takes a look at what&rsquo;s happening in downtown Rutland where the pandemic shutdown helped spur a redevelopment plan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to find different ways for our businesses to work and to survive,&rdquo; said Steve Peters of the Downtown Rutland Partnership.</p>
<p>Businesses in the downtown Rutland area are starting to reopen.</p>
<p>Vermont Gov. Phil Scott has approved outdoor seating for restaurants, but not all of them have space. The Downtown Rutland Partnership is generating ideas with businesses and property owners to change the layout of Center Street for the summer. This would allow the extra space for businesses to set up outside to help provide economic recovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is an urgency now and we would love to respond to that and make some changes,&rdquo; Peters said.</p>
<p>One of the proposed designs narrows the driving lane on Center Street. That would allow for the sidewalk to be extended for restaurants and stores to put tables and things outside for customers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I live, eat, drink, sleep, everything downtown Center Street,&rdquo; Lois Miller said.</p>
<p>Miller is the manager at Avanti Hair Salon and lives upstairs from the business. She supports altering the layout of the street for this summer and possibly long term. Miller would like to see something similar to Church Street in Burlington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not have a community around where you can walk around all day or night and you can sit down and dine and drink, or whatever,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I just think it would be such a benefit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the Truffle Company, business can be hit or miss these days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a difficult climate to work in,&rdquo; said Stephen Montanez of the Truffle Company. &ldquo;I know, talking with a lot of other business owners on the streets, people sharing ideas, a lot of collaboration and recommendations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Montanez says the downtown businesses are lucky to be in a city that wants to work so closely with them.</p>
<p>Jessi Travers Moulton, who owns the consignment boutique Unlimited Potential one street over from Center Street, is excited about the possible change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it will bring a lot more people downtown. I think people will feel safer downtown, more at ease going into places,&rdquo; Travers Moulton said.</p>
<p>She says having a business downtown isn&rsquo;t always the easiest, but it is rewarding.</p>
<p>Miller, the hair salon manager, says a change like this is big for a smaller downtown area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every single business has to be focused on everything around it because if your next-door neighbors aren&rsquo;t getting paychecks, they&rsquo;re not coming next door to spend money,&rdquo; Miller said.</p>
<p>Because of the coronavirus, Rutland City had to cancel its weekly summer event, Friday Night Live. Moving forward with this project would create a new reason for people to go downtown.
