<p>More women have come forward to join the lawsuit against former Winnipeg fashion mogul Peter Nygard.</p>
<p>There are now 46 women listed on the complaint against Nygard according to an amended class action lawsuit – which accuses him of rape, sexual assault and human trafficking.</p>
<p>Four women claim they were either raped or sexually assaulted in Winnipeg. At least two of the women are from Winnipeg.</p>
<p>A woman listed as Jane Doe No. 15 says she was flown to the Nygard Companies’ Winnipeg property under the guise of a modeling job where she was “held captive against her will for three days and raped repeatedly by Nygard.”</p>
<p>Jane Doe No. 27 says she met Nygard at the Nygard Companies’ Winnipeg office seeking a modelling sponsorship. She says during her meeting, Nygard complemented her and then groped her breasts.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>Jane Doe No. 37 says her father sold Nygard furs through his business so she knew Nygard and frequently saw him at the store. She says that when she was 15, Nygard raped her in the bathroom at a Winnipeg restaurant.</p>
<p>Jane Doe No. 44 was 14 and in the child welfare system when she says Nygard picked her up on the street in Winnipeg and paid her for oral sex. She claims this happened on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>Twelve of the victims were under 18 when the alleged crimes happened.</p>
<p>The original civil class action lawsuit was filed in a New York court in February with 10 women listed in the complaint at the time.</p>
<p>None of the allegations against Nygard have been proven in court. He has denied the allegations.</p>
<p>Read the amended complaint:</p>
<p>Nygard stepped down from his company after his Times Square headquarters were raided by the FBI and New York City police.</p>
<p>The lawsuit names Nygard himself, who is the founder and chair of Nygard International Partnership and Nygard Holding Ltd. All three are named in the lawsuit as defendants, with the suit stating his companies were knowing participants in Nygard’s “decades-long sex trafficking scheme.”</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>Nygard’s lawyer Jay Prober says all of the allegations are false.</p>
<p>“They’re just as false as the first 10 allegations. I’ve described the amended class action, including some 30 new complainants as a work of fiction. That’s exactly what it is. It makes a farce of the whole matter,” he said.</p>
<p>“What’s happened in my view is the US lawyers through advertising have gone out and beaten the bushes for more complainants. Lo and behold what you have is a number of other women jumping on what they think is a money train or gravy train and hope to cash in at the end of the day.”</p>
<p>Prober says the fact all the stories are similar lead him to believe they’re not a representation of a patter of behavior, rather rehearsed.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>“These are not credible allegations and the fact they are so similar detracts credibility,” he said.</p>
<p>“Think about it. Not one of these almost 50 women ever complained to anybody in authority — not one. Does that not strike you as rather strange? It certainly does me having practiced as long as I have.”</p>
<p>Prober named hedge fund billionaire Louis Bacon as being behind the lawsuit and said the pair have been feuding for a decade both in the Bahamas and in New York City.</p>
<p>Bacon has not responded to repeated requests for comment.</p>

<h3 id="courtney-stodden-says-peter-nygard-is-a-monster-her-shocking-claims">Courtney Stodden says Peter Nygard is a ‘monster’: Her shocking claims</h3>

Shocking statistics show reporting assault is fraught with problems. Nina Funnell shares her story on the grueling process.</p>
<p>MODEL Courtney Stodden claimed billionaire Peter Nygard tried to lure her to his private island when she was just 19 years old after he allegedly sexually assaulted her at an event.</p>
<p>In an excerpt from Predator King: Peter Nygard’s Dark Life of Rape, Drugs, and Blackmail by Melissa Cronin, Courtney revealed her chilling encounter with the disgraced fashion designer.</p>
<p>Courtney, 25, first accused Peter, 78, of sexual assault over Instagram after he was hit with a class-action lawsuit in February 2020.</p>
<p>Ten women and girls – the youngest 14 years old – accused the fashion designer of rape, sexual assault, sex trafficking at his Bahamas compound and more.</p>
<p>Courtney, who married Green Mile actor Doug Hutchison, 35 years her senior, at just 16 years old, explained in Predator King how she met Peter at his Night of 100 Stars Oscar viewing party in 2014.</p>
<p>In red carpet photos from the evening, Peter can be seen tightly cupping his hand just below Courtney’s breast.</p>
<p>She said in the book: “I was just replaying all of this stuff and then I thought to myself, ‘Was that appropriate that he grabbed my chest and my a**?’ You know, at the event and over my clothes, was that appropriate? The way he was kissing my neck. The way he was kissing, pulling me so close to him.”</p>
<p>The singer-songwriter revealed “nobody said anything.”</p>
<p>Courtney claimed in the book that he had promised to help her with her clothing line if she would “spend some time with him.”</p>
<p>She continued: “He had like that spanx line [Nygard Slims] or whatever that was, and he was telling me, ‘Oh, come model, you know, the Spanx for me! Then after that you’re going to have to come to a pamper party and then you and I are going to escape on my boat to the island and then we’re going to talk about your career there. But I can’t have anybody else around.’”</p>
<p>Although she managed to escape Peter at the event, she claimed he sent her “very explicit” texts “almost every day&rdquo; after their encounter.</p>
<p>She alleged: “You know, it still hurt inside, but I was like, ‘Oh, okay. Well this is part of the game, you know, it’s the casting couch.’ I mean, I wasn’t going to ever sleep with him, but he could just touch me and do whatever he wanted when he was around me because he was helping me.”</p>
<p>Courtney revealed her mum intervened and stopped the exchange just in time.</p>
<p>She admitted: “I was three, two, one … getting ready to go down to that island to be raped.”</p>
<p>Courtney said Peter left her alone after her mother confronted him.</p>
<p>When she attended his Night of 100 Stars Oscar party in 2017, he did not pose with her on the red carpet.</p>
<p>She said in the book: “It’s so scary ’cuz I was so young in this town and so naive and I can only imagine, you know, the damage that he’s done to the girls that were a little bit more naive than me. Just, yeah … What a monster.”</p>
<p>Courtney added: “I’m suffering from so much trauma that I can’t even comprehend at this moment in time. It’s been really difficult growing up in this industry.”</p>
<p>Courtney is now single, as her divorce from Doug was finalised in March 2020.</p>
<p>As for Peter, lawyers of the Jane Doe lawsuit announced they had been contacted by more than one hundred victims and/or witnesses of Peter’s alleged sexual abuse that spans four decades after the filing.</p>
<p>Peter’s lawyer denied the lawsuit allegations.</p>
<p>The case remains ongoing.</p>
