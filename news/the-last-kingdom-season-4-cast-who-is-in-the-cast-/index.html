The Last Kingdom season 4 is due to land on Netflix today, April 26, and fans have been waiting more than a year to see the characters again. The historical drama series, which has been compared to the popular Amazon Prime series Vikings, tells the story of Uhtred of Bebbanburg, who was born a Saxon but raised a Dane. Throughout the series, his allegiance is tested as he is constantly forced to choose between the two sides as they battle against each other.</p>
<p>Who is in the cast of The Last Kingdom?</p>
<p>Uhtred of Bebbanburg - Alexander Dreymon</p>
<p>Uhtred returns as the Saxon heir of Bebbanburg, who was raised by Danes after his father was killed in battle and his village destroyed.</p>
<p>He is facing a constant internal battle deciding where is fate lies, as he is loyal to those who raised him, but he has fought for the Saxons under King Alfred of Wessex (David Dawson).</p>
<p>Alfred died in the last series, leaving his younger son Edward (Timothy Innes) to take the throne, and he won the last battle by the skin of his teeth.</p>
<p>Wessex is in a vulnerable position and Uhtred will have to decide whether it is his job to protect the region, or rejoin the Danes who want to see it fall.</p>
<p>Alexander Dreymon is a German actor who is fluent in English and French, and his role as Uhtred was his big break.</p>
<p>He has previously starred in American Horror Story: Coven, as well as films The Test of Time and Christopher and His Kind.</p>
<p>At the start of the year, he posted a video thanking his fans, saying: &ldquo;I think I speak for all of us who are involved in the making of TLK that we are extremely grateful to you all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The show could have been cancelled after the first season but it wasn&rsquo;t, because of your enthusiasm for it and all of our lives would be very different today if that weren&rsquo;t the case.&rdquo;</p>

While fans are excited for season four of The Last Kingdom to arrive on Netflix, they’re also probably quite worried about what could happen to their favourite characters.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The show has never been shy about killing off major players and given the large ensemble cast set to appear, it seems likely that not everyone will be making it out alive.</p>
<p>With that in mind, now seems like a good time to look back on the first three seasons of The Last Kingdom, to remember some of the most shocking deaths so far… (beware spoilers for season 1-3 of The Last Kingdom)</p>

<p>Queen Iseult</p>
<p>Uhtred crossed paths with Iseult (Charlie Murphy) when he went plundering across Cornwall, quickly falling for the pagan queen with apparent clairvoyant abilities. Of course, the way she ambiguously promised to be with Uhtred “until the end” suggested her days were numbered. Such language has a tendency to tempt fate in shows like The Last Kingdom. But while not unexpected, Iseult’s violent death remains a sad moment in the climax of season one, beheaded by wicked viking warrior Skorpa of the White Horse.</p>
<p>Halig</p>
<p>Halig (Gerard Kearns) was a humble and honourable Saxon man, who was so loyal to Uhtred that he was sold into slavery alongside him after King Guthred’s betrayal. They were held captive on a ship together and subjected to terrible abuse, with their only escape attempt thwarted and punished with Halig’s barbaric death. Strapped to the front of the boat, he was slowly drowned by the waves as it sailed across the sea, rowed by Uhtred and his fellow slaves who could hear him suffer. A truly horrifying end for a character that didn’t deserve it – but rest assured, he was avenged…</p>
<p>Abbot Eadred</p>
<p>Sometimes you just can’t wait to see a character get what’s coming to them and this was one such occasion. Abbot Eadred (David Schofield) was as spiteful as they come and the true architect of Uhtred’s banishment to slavery. Not only was Halig’s blood on his hands, but he also attempted to force Uhtred’s lover, Gisela, into marriage with a man she despised. He was a bad egg through and through so when Uhtred stabbed him in a fit of rage, it was hard not to feel like justice was served.</p>
<p>Odda the Younger/Elder</p>
<p>The Oddas were a truly unfortunate line of noblemen. Introduced in season one of The Last Kingdom as two of King Alfred’s most trusted advisers, it soon became apparent that Odda the Younger (Brian Vernel) was not to be trusted. His loyalty to the crown was exposed as fleeting when he sided with the Danes, believing Alfred to be dead after the invasion of Wessex. As you can tell from his inclusion on this list, it didn’t end well for him.</p>
<p>Odda the Younger’s death stands out as one of season one’s most shocking as it was dealt by the hand of his own father! When Odda the Elder (Simon Kunz) realised that Alfred was still alive and planning to recapture Wessex, he knew his son was doomed to execution for treason. Rather than go down with him, he chose to make the ultimate display of loyalty to Alfred by taking a knife to his son as he addressed the people of their estate. The drastic decision was made with sadness, leaving him without an heir.</p>
<p>In the second season, as Alfred threatened to destroy Wessex by paying a huge ransom to the Danes, Odda the Elder realised the devastation this would cause in the long-term. He acted against the king (quite rightly), summoning an army to fight the vikings that resulted in a crucial victory for Wessex. However, for disobeying the king’s orders and risking the life of his kidnapped daughter, Odda was branded a traitor. He killed himself in prison while awaiting execution, without doubt one of the most unjust deaths in The Last Kingdom.</p>
<p>Skade</p>
<p>One of The Last Kingdom’s most despicable figures, Skade (Thea Sofie Loch Næss) was a sadistic and bloodthirsty seer who destroyed men from the inside out with her curses. Uhtred came under one such spell and felt its effects terribly, learning that the only way to break it would be to kill Skade without any blood being spilled. But time passed without any action and it seemed as if he had fallen for her seduction. He had everyone fooled, from characters in the show to the viewers watching at home, making Skade’s grim fate all the more shocking. During a steamy bath in a secluded stretch of river, Uhtred suddenly held her under the water until she drowned in one of The Last Kingdom’s darkest moments to date.</p>
<p>Erik</p>
<p>When Erik (Christian Hillborg) was introduced early in season two as a troublesome viking warrior, few could have expected they would be rooting for him so passionately just a few episodes later. When he and his brother kidnapped lady Aethelflaed of Mercia, a softer side to his character emerged and they soon fell in love. On paper it sounds like Stockholm syndrome, but rest assured their romance blossomed naturally and their earnest plan to run away together was really compelling. It’s a great shame that it didn’t work out, as Erik was slain by his brother when he discovered what had been going on.</p>
<p>Ragnar the Younger</p>
<p>The Last Kingdom has no shortage of truly shocking moments and this was yet another. Uhtred’s adoptive brother Ragnar (Tobias Santelmann) had been a friendly face throughout the first three seasons, proven to be a reasonable man as well as a fierce warrior. So when Aethelwold hatched a crazy plan to kill him, no one thought the power hungry menace would actually succeed! Alas, he crept into Ragnar’s tent in the dead of night and stabbed him repeatedly in his sleep, sending him to the cold world of Niflheim (hell) rather than glorious Valhalla (heaven), according to the viking beliefs. A dishonourable way to go for one of Uhtred’s key allies.</p>
<p>Aethelwold</p>
<p>What goes around comes around. When Ragnar was discovered murdered in his tent, there was no way that Uhtred and Brida were going to let the death go unpunished. Aethelwold (Harry McEntire) had been a treacherous presence in Wessex since The Last Kingdom began, believing that the throne was rightfully his. His scheming didn’t become a genuine threat until season three, where he stoked up opposition from all sides against the ailing King Alfred. But his fate was sealed when Brida learned of his part in Ragnar’s death. In the closing moments of the series finale, Uhtred stabbed a terrified Aethelwold in the woods, which allowed his brother’s soul to finally be at peace.</p>
<p>King Alfred</p>
<p>Of course, not every death in The Last Kingdom is violent (although most of them are). King Alfred (David Dawson) passed away in bed after suffering from ill health for many years, but fortunately he was able to make peace with Uhtred beforehand, acknowledging that he should have treated him better. The complicated relationship between them has always been a huge part of this series, so Alfred’s death stands to have the biggest impact on The Last Kingdom moving forward.</p>
<p>Thyra</p>
<p>Perhaps the most upsetting death on this list, the murder of Thyra (Julia Bache-Wiig) at the end of season three made for extremely distressing viewing. After being rescued from years of abuse and captivity, Uhtred’s adoptive sister finally found happiness in Wessex with her marriage to Father Beocca. Thyra overcame the trauma of her imprisonment and treated everyone with kindness, only to meet a dreadful fate at the hands of a cruel man who hated her solely because she was a Dane. She hid under the floorboards when he followed her home, but found herself trapped when he set the house on fire, tragically perishing in the blaze.</p>

<h3 id="how-is-the-last-kingdom-different-to-the-books-the-biggest-changes-from-page-to-screen">How is The Last Kingdom different to the books? The biggest changes from page to screen</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2020/04/the_last_kingdom-2-45b1ebb.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=620,413" alt="img">
Uhtred of Bebbanburg is finally back on screens as The Last Kingdom returns for season four on Netflix.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The action-packed drama is based on a series of novels by historical fiction writer Bernard Cornwell, first published as The Saxon Stories back in 2004.</p>
<p>Like many adaptations, The Last Kingdom varies significantly from the source material that inspired it, altering Uhtred’s path to revenge and the reclamation of his rightful land.</p>
<p>Here are the biggest differences between the books and the Netflix series…</p>

<p>The Last Kingdom season 1 changes from books</p>
<p>Season one of The Last Kingdom stands out as the most faithful adaptation of Cornwell’s Saxon Stories, translating his first two books to the small screen without making any major changes to the plot – but one particular difference stands out as notable.</p>
<p>After raiding Briton territory and violating the peace, Uhtred is sentenced to fight to the death by King Alfred. In the television series, he goes up against none other than Leofric, one of Alfred’s top soldiers and a man Uhtred had befriended. It’s a surprising moment in the season but doesn’t quite add up in terms of character motivation, which is probably because it never happened in the books.</p>
<p>Instead, it is Steapa, another of the king’s loyal swordsman, who agrees to fight Uhtred to the death. It’s not difficult to see why this was changed in the series, as Steapa doesn’t get a huge amount of screen time in season one, so putting Uhtred up against a more familiar face like Leofric naturally raises the dramatic stakes.</p>
<p>The Last Kingdom season 2 changes from books</p>
<p>In season two, The Last Kingdom becomes a bit more relaxed about straying away from events that occur in Cornwell’s novels, drawing inspiration from his third and fourth entries, titled The Lords of the North and Sword Song respectively.</p>
<p>For one thing, the television show completely cuts out the antagonistic Ivar Ivarsson, a Dane who has gained control of Eoferwic at the start of The Lords of the North. In a simplifying measure, the Netflix series replaces him with viking brothers Sigefrid and Erik who don’t appear until the fourth book. Ivar isn’t a very significant character so this change doesn’t have major consequences in the long-term. Arguably, it strengthens season two by allowing more screen time for Sigefrid and Erik, who are central to the story in the latter half.</p>
<p>Their relevance comes into focus when they capture London, prompting Alfred to send men to liberate the city. But the events that follow play out very differently in the series than they do in the books. Cornwell’s novel sees Uhtred lead a successful attack on London, winning back the city and placing it in Aethelred’s power.</p>
<p>In stark contrast, the battle plays out disastrously for the Saxons in The Last Kingdom. The show sees Aethelred put in charge of Alfred’s men, leading them to London only to find the city deserted. Initially believing the vikings to have fled, they soon realise that they have been tricked; Erik and Sigefrid’s men have abandoned the city to raid Aethelred’s unguarded camp and kidnap his wife, princess Aethelflaed.</p>
<p>In the book, Aethelflaed still gets kidnapped but at a later skirmish, so this change was likely made to save time and jump forward to the doomed romance that blossoms between herself and Erik.</p>
<p>In the Netflix series, Aethelflaed kills Sigefrid during the final battle of season two. However, in the books it is former monk Osferth who does this, which is hard to imagine given his timid demeanour in the television show.</p>
<p>One of the most memorable deaths in season two of The Last Kingdom is Abbott Eadred, a spiteful priest who Uhtred kills when he attempts to stop him from marrying Gisela. In the book, Eadred has a smaller role, appearing at the beginning to report his vision of King Guthred, but having less to do with later plot developments. Instead, Uhtred kills a monk named Brother Jænberht, who fulfils the villainous Eadred role. Again, this change was likely made to streamline the story and give the series less characters to juggle.</p>
<p>The Last Kingdom season 3 changes from books</p>
<p>The third season saw The Last Kingdom move entirely from the BBC to a Netflix Original production, just in time for two particularly brutal characters to make their debut.</p>
<p>In the fifth novel, Bloodhair and Skade are introduced as lovers but soon separated when the latter is taken hostage by Uhtred. In both the book and the TV show, there is a confrontation outside a fort where Bloodhair attempts to get her back by threatening Saxon prisoners.</p>
<p>In the Netflix series, this attempt is completely unsuccessful and Skade remains imprisoned, but in the books she is promptly freed and reunited with Bloodhair – only to be taken captive again later on. This alteration was likely another time-saving measure, as Skade ultimately ends up back with Uhtred anyway, although their relationship is markedly different in the book.</p>
<p>While Uhtred is reluctant to become intimately involved with Skade in The Last Kingdom, largely due to the fact he is mourning his late wife, they do become lovers in the book. During their relationship, they sail to Frisia where they plunder and kill Skade’s husband, but grow distant afterwards due to disagreements over his underwhelming treasure.</p>
<p>Upon their return to England, Skade encounters Haesten and the two of them fall in love. This is another area where the Netflix series differs, depicting Skade as completely disinterested in Haesten and his advances.</p>
<p>Skade meets a nasty end in The Last Kingdom, as Uhtred drowns her in a river to break the curse she has put on him. In the book, it is actually Bloodhair himself who kills Skade, angry that she abandoned him for other warriors. He then asks Uhtred to kill him, having been seriously injured earlier in the story with no hope of recovery.</p>
<p>Outside of Uhtred and Skade’s toxic dynamic, there are some other differences to be found. Sadly, Gisela dies in childbirth just as she does in the series, but in the book her baby also passes away whereas in the series he is a healthy son to Uhtred.</p>
<p>Lord Aethelred wants a divorce from Aethelflaed in both the books and the series, giving his right-hand man Aldhelm the command to sleep with her so that he can brand her an adulterer. In the book, Aldhelm attempts to do so unsuccessfully, resulting in his death by Uhtred’s hand. In The Last Kingdom, he cannot go through with the plan as he develops genuine affection for Aethelflaed, so Aethelred stabs him for his disobedience.</p>
