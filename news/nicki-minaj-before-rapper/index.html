<p>HIP-HOP 6ix9ine &amp; Nicki Minaj Call Out Rappers For Being Hypocrites About Snitching</p>
<p>On Thursday night (June 11), 6ix9ine and Nicki Minaj connected on Instagram to talk about their new collaboration &ldquo;Trollz.&rdquo; During their conversation, the two scolded rappers for playing both sides of the fence when it came to snitching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel like street n&mdash;-s have every right to feel how they wanna feel about snitching because they lived that life,&rdquo; said Minaj. &ldquo;I feel rappers need to play it easy because everybody mingles and integrates with everybody. If a top executive called one of ya&rsquo;ll rappers, y&rsquo;all signing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She added: &ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;m not on the block with 6ix9ine. Me and 6ix9ine is not on the block. We&rsquo;re in the music business. You rappers is in rooms all the time with people with sketchy pasts, and I&rsquo;m not judging anybody ' cause I&rsquo;m not doing that. I have nothing but respect for so many of these people, and I would never fix my face to talk crazy about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Earlier in the night, 6ix9ine lambasted Meek Mill, Snoop Dogg, and Future for their past comments. The &ldquo;Gummo&rdquo; rapper claimed Meek affiliated with snitches, namely Roc Nation executive Desiree Perez who cooperated with the DEA as an informant in the &rsquo;90s. &ldquo;Meek Mill, you can&rsquo;t pick and choose who you want to call rats. This is public information &hellip; Sir, you know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ever since Nicki left you, you are a nobody &hellip; Did you forget who you was? I forgot what Drake said, what did Drake say? &lsquo;Was that your tour or your girl&rsquo;s tour?'&rdquo;</p>

HIP-HOP Nicki Minaj Talks &lsquo;Married Life&rsquo; &amp; Being a Female in the Rap World With Lil Wayne</p>
<p>Lil Wayne delivered another episode of his Young Money Radio on Apple Music Friday (June 12), featuring an all-star cast of guests including T-Pain, Nicki Minaj, Damien Lillard, Noreaga and Lil Duval.</p>
<p>Weezy and his longtime pal, whom he introduced as &ldquo;the First Lady of Young Money and the Queen of every f&mdash;ing thing,&rdquo; delved into a chat about being a female in the rap game. Wayne recalled that when he signed Nicki to his label back in 2009, people told him not to sign a woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was getting someone to take you serious, and that was the whole thing I was worried about,&rdquo; Minaj explained. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know if you would take me serious, because at the time people had really given up on female rappers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just knew I was going to make it, so I was enjoying the groundwork of it and I was working super hard,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I think people don&rsquo;t realize the work that goes into it. Because if you&rsquo;re not going to work, why bother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wayne went on to give himself and Nicki props for the most Hot 100 entries with Drake and Elvis Presley&ndash;plus congratulating Minaj on her chart topping &ldquo;Say So&rdquo; remix with Doja Cat. &ldquo;I have never built my career on whether or not something goes number one,&rdquo; Minaj replied. &ldquo;Most of the things that stick forever in rap, they don&rsquo;t go number one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On how &ldquo;the married life is treating her,&rdquo; Minaj gushed over her new husband Kenneth Petty. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it would be as refreshing and calming as it is,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Even if you&rsquo;re not married, when you have someone who feels like your soulmate or someone who understands you, you feel on top of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Listen to the full episode here.

Say what you will about 6ix9ine, but there&rsquo;s no denying the man knows how to get people talking.</p>
<p>On Thursday night, the Brooklyn rapper hit up Instagram Live to generate more hype around &ldquo;Trollz,&rdquo; his much-anticipated track with Nicki Minaj. Right off the bat, 6ix9ine informed his 800,000-plus viewers that he needed to get some things off chest and would expose some inconvenient truths about the hip-hop industry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world is full of hate right now &hellip; I&rsquo;ma show you a lot of things right now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ma show you how this rap game is full of liars. I&rsquo;ma show you how this rap game full of rats &hellip; I&rsquo;ma show you how the rap game really works &hellip; The rap game don&rsquo;t want you to know certain stuff. I&rsquo;ma expose the rap game right now, &lsquo;cause I got facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then turned his direction to Meek Mill, who has criticized 6ix9ine for cooperating with federal investigators.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ma start with Meek Mill &hellip; I&rsquo;m not clout chasing. I have more followers than you,&rdquo; he began, before name-dropping Roc Nation executive Desiree Perez.</p>
<p>6ix9ine proceeded to do a search for Perez&rsquo;s name, and clicked on a 2015 Daily News article that described her cooperation with the Drug Enforcement Administration. He pointed to the following paragraph:</p>
<p>The story that spooked Dash revealed how Perez, the wife of longtime Jay Z wingman Juan Perez, became a cooperating witness for the DEA in the 1990s. After her 1994 arrest for possession of 35 kilos of cocaine, Perez struck a deal with the feds, agreeing to wear hidden wires to record her meetings with major cocaine traffickers. Her undercover informant work won her courtroom praise from federal prosecutors after she helped them break up major drug deals in Puerto Rico and Colombia.</p>
<p>6ix9ine then showed his followers several photos in which Meek was spotted with Perez, arguing that this proof of Meek&rsquo;s hypocrisy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meek Mill, you can&rsquo;t pick and choose who you want to call rats. This is public information &hellip; Sir, you know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ever since Nicki left you, you are a nobody &hellip; Did you forget who you was? I forgot what Drake said, what did Drake say? &lsquo;Was that your tour or your girl&rsquo;s tour?'&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then went on to Future, who recently shared an Instagram story that read: &ldquo;I believe if u hang with a snitch u a snitch and deserve to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>6ix9ine suggested Future, who has collaborated and toured with Meek, was a fraud who didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;take care of your kids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You rap about molly, percs, all this shit, never got locked up for no drug offense. Ever,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;&hellip; You say, if you hang out with a rat, you&rsquo;re a rat. So what does that make you? &lsquo;Cause you hang out with these n***as.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then slammed Future and Meek&rsquo;s ability to release a solo record that was hit, claiming they each needed Drake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before I became a rat, I did it on my own. Think about that,&rdquo; he said, referring to his success prior to his prison sentence. &ldquo;So if you&rsquo;re chilling with a rat makes you a rat &hellip; you&rsquo;re a fucking rat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He also doubled down on his snitching allegations against Snoop Dogg, and claimed the West Coast legend had contacted him via DM to &ldquo;throw the white flag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the two years I was locked up, you aired me out. I&rsquo;m just replying,&rdquo; 6ix9ine said. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it Snoop Dogg and Meek Mill who couldn&rsquo;t keep my dick outta their mouths?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he could continue, Nicki hopped on Instagram Live to address the snitching issue. The Queen rapper said she respects those who abide by the street code, but agreed many rappers were hypocrites when it came to so-called rats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel street n<em><strong>as have every right to feel how they want to feel about snitching because they live that life,&rdquo; Nicki said. &ldquo;I feel rappers need to play it easy because everybody mingles and integrates with everybody, and if a top executive rat calls one of y&rsquo;all unsigned rappers right now, y&rsquo;all signing &hellip; Let&rsquo;s be clear when we talk about rappers versus street n</strong></em>as.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicki went on to say she and 6ix9ine are not &ldquo;on the block,&rdquo; they&rsquo;re in the music business—just like many 6ix9ine critics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You rappers are in rooms all the time with people with sketchy pasts,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not judging anybody &hellip; I have so much respect for so many of these people &hellip; [but] none of you n<em><strong>as are from the block. If these n</strong></em>a are still out there doing what they&rsquo;re doing and really living that life want to talk about it, I gotta respect it because they play by a different code &hellip; But as far as rappers they gotta just play it easy, &lsquo;cause y&rsquo;all know y&rsquo;all bend the rules for certain people &hellip; Talking &lsquo;bout snitches when there&rsquo;s snitches in your camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nicki also told viewers there were &ldquo;so many special things&rdquo; she wanted to share, but had to keep things quiet for the time being. She then reminded everyone that a portion of the proceeds from &ldquo;Trollz&rdquo; were going to the The Bail Project, which provides bail relief to low-income individuals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We just want to make sure the protestors and everybody on the front lines &hellip; we want you to know how much I respect the people out there protesting and lending their voices,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And 20 percent of our proceeds will go to the Bail Out Fund &hellip; Shout out to everybody, all the black lives, the innocent black people that&rsquo;ve been killed senselessly. We hope that all you see your voices are so powerful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Trollz&rdquo; single and music video are out now.

5 / 5 ( 1 vote )</p>
<p>Nicki Minaj criticou os rappers que atacam 6ix9ine, dizendo que todos se misturaram com pessoas que têm um passado polemico.</p>
<p>Como prometido, Nicki Minaj e 6ix9ine se uniram no Instagram Live, com fãs e haters em sintonia com a transmissão. Nos últimos dias, Nicki foi alvo de opositores depois que foi revelado que ela decidiu colaborar em “Trollz ” com o rapper que se tornou um informante federal, mas embora tenha havido um pedido para que ninguém trabalhe com 6ix9ine, seus números estão crescendo constantemente.</p>
<p>Durante o bate-papo, Nicki falou sobre a controvérsia das delações de 6ix9ine e por que os rappers não têm o direito de atacar o rapper “Os manos das ruas têm todo o direito de sentir como querem porque vivem essa vida”, disse Nicki Minaj. “Eu sinto que os rappers precisam ter calma, porque todos se misturam e se integram a todos. Se um “rato” executivo de alto escalão telefona para um de vocês, rappers não assinados para assinar com vocês, vocês vão assinar”. Tekashi 6ix9ine concordou.</p>
<p>“Se um executivo “rato” chama todos vocês para assinar, vocês assinam. Então, vamos deixar claro quando falamos de rappers vs mano das ruas. Eu sinto que os manos das ruas têm o direito de sentir como eles querem, porque eles estão no campo e você sabe, Eu não estou na quebrada com 6ix9ine”.</p>
<p>Nicki também disse que os artistas ocupam “salas o tempo todo com pessoas com passados ​​polemicos e não estou julgando ninguém, porque isso é justo, não estão fazendo isso”. Ela disse que tem respeito por tantas “dessas pessoas” e que “nunca falaria loucamente sobre elas”. Então, ela mencionou Kenneth Petty.</p>
<p>“Meu marido não brinca com um informante. Meu marido é tipo ‘Você sabe, eu não posso brincar com isso.’ E eu o respeito porque ele viveu uma vida diferente. Você quer fazer rap em um minuto e estar nas ruas no minuto seguinte. Você quer falar sobre as pessoas que não escrevem, elas criticam em um minuto e depois cantam com pessoas que não escrevem raps há muito tempo, mas se alguém falar sobre a integridade do hip hop, isso é um problema, e não delatar. Nós não estamos nas ruas. Nenhum de vocês estão nas ruas!”, disse Minaj.</p>
<p>6ix9ine comentou no vídeo dizendo: “Pessoas que não gostam de Nicki são miseráveis ​​em sua própria pele”. Deslize o dedo para ouvir o clipe de Nicki Minaj e 6ix9ine no Instagram Live abaixo.

<p><img src="https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/NYC_Artists.jpg" alt="img">
In partnership with ‘The King Of Staten Island’</p>
<p>Everyone’s got to start somewhere in life, even the people you can’t imagine having a ‘normal’ job. That’s true of some of the biggest names to emerge from New York’s creative scene, like iconic actor Steve Buscemi who worked as a firefighter before turning to the world of film and TV. He goes back to his roots in The King Of Staten Island (available to rent at home now), which follows budding tattoo artist Scott Carlin (played by Pete Davidson) while he tries to get his life on track. Life in the five boroughs is often driven by a hustling spirit and these stars appeared in some surprising guises on their way to fame.</p>
<p>Debbie Harry, Blondie – Playboy bunny</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Before Blondie, there was bunny – Playboy bunny, to be precise. In the years before she was a fixture in the dank confines of infamous venue CBGB, one of New York’s leading ladies of punk was earning her coin in ears and a tail. Before that, she waitressed at the long-gone Max’s Kansas City, which became a hub for Andy Warhol and his circle in the late ‘60s. Fellow singer and Max’s waitress Jayne County described Harry during her waitressing days as being “always stoned and regularly dropped cheeseburgers in people’s laps”.</p>
<p>Amy Schumer – bartender, waitress, pedicab driver</p>
<p>Since starring in Judd Apatow’s Trainwreck in 2015, Amy Schumer has become one of the most celebrated names in comedy. Before the world was aware of her wit, though, she held down a bunch of other jobs. Some, like bartending and waitressing, were pretty regular, but others were less so – during a stint living in Santa Barbara, Schumer worked as a pedicab driver, cycling people up and down the city’s State Street.</p>
<p>Cardi B – grocery store worker</p>
<p>It’s no secret that rapping wasn’t Cardi B’s first job. Before she was a hip-hop heavyweight, the Bronx MC was a reality star on Love And Hip-Hop: New York and worked as a stripper – something she frequently references in her music. But even before all that, when she was still known as Belcalis Almánzar, Cardi had a much more relatable day job – working at a grocery store in TriBeCa. Her time there came to an end when a manager caught her giving a colleague a very generous discount and suggested she go work at the strip club across the street instead.</p>
<p>Kristen Wiig – hotdog seller, babysitter, seller at a farmer’s market</p>
<p>After catching the acting bug while studying at the University Of Arizona, Kristen Wiig threw all caution to the wind post-graduation and moved to LA on a whim to try and become a professional actor. While she was waiting for her big break she went through several jobs, like babysitting, selling peaches at a farmer’s market, and manning a mall hotdog cart, to make ends meet.</p>
<p>Steve Buscemi – fireman</p>

<p>Before he was an actor, Steve Buscemi served as a firefighter in Manhattan, going out on auditions in his spare time. After four years of service, he left the FDNY to pursue acting full time and it paid off brilliantly – he’s now one of the city’s most iconic actors with a raft of impressive credits, including Fargo, The Big Lebowski and Reservoir Dogs.</p>
<p>Moby – golf caddy</p>
<p>He might be a world-renowned musician and producer now, but there was a point when Moby was just a teenager with a Saturday job saving up to buy records. His first job wasn’t your average shift washing dishes or manning a till though. Instead, a young Moby got himself work as a golf caddy just so he could pay to bolster his record collection. “I was quite small so I could only carry old people’s bags as they didn’t have as many clubs,” he told Today FM in 2016. “I only took that job when I was 13 years old so I could buy David Bowie records.”</p>
<p>Awkwafina – publishing assistant</p>
<p>New Yorker Nora Lum is a respected rapper and actor now, but before the world got to know her Awkwafina alter-ego, her jobs were much more behind-the-scenes. The Queens native started out interning at local publications before securing her first job at Rodale Books as a publishing assistant – until a music video she filmed with a friend was discovered by her co-workers. “My boss ended up finding out about it and kinda fired me,” she told TigerBelly in 2017. Their loss, though, was the world’s gain.</p>
<p>Patti Smith – factory worker</p>
<p>Like all great artists, New York punk poet Patti Smith put her experiences in a mundane 9-to-5 to good use later in life. She worked in a factory – rock mythology is foggy on whether it was one making toys, baby buggies or textbooks – and her time there inspired the 1974 track ‘Piss Factory’. “Floor boss slides up to me and he says, ‘Hey sister/You’re just moving too fast/You’re screwing up the quota/You’re doing your piece work too fast,’” she sang on the track.</p>
<p>Gene Simmons, KISS – teacher, personal assistant</p>
<p>Some rock stars might seem like they came out of the womb ready to rock and roll, but even the world’s most notorious musicians have unlikely pasts. None could be more surprising than KISS singer and bassist Gene Simmons, who had a stint as a teacher to the kids of the Upper West Side before dedicating his life to the stage. He also worked as a personal assistant to the editors at fashion mags Vogue and Glamour for a time. Maybe that’s where he picked up how to get the band’s iconic black-and-white face paint just right.</p>
<p>Nicki Minaj – office manager, waitress</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine larger-than-life rapper Nicki Minaj as an office manager, but that’s just one of the day jobs she held down before getting her big break. She also worked as a waitress at restaurants across New York, but didn’t have the greatest attitude to patrons. “I was really, really [rude] to the customers,” she said during a 2014 appearance on The Tonight Show. “That’s what made me wanna hurry up and follow my dream. I was like, ‘Oh my god, this is not for me, I gotta hurry up and get out of here’.”</p>

<h3 id="lisaraye-mccoy-addresses-nicki-minaj-diss-on-trollz">&ldquo;LisaRaye McCoy Addresses Nicki Minaj Diss On “Trollz”&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://urbanislandz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/LisaRaye-McCoy.jpg" alt="img">
Nicki Minaj is a lyrical genius, but not all are impressed at her ability to spin words.</p>
<p>Fans finally got to hear Nicki’s long-awaited collab with Tekashi 6ix9ine at midnight following several delays that placed “TROLLZ” out of earshot. The Queens rapper took the opportunity to fire some shots on the track against those who reckon that she owes all she is to Lil Kim. The two females of rap have had a feud for years after Kim accused Nicki Minaj of stealing her style and flaunting colourful wigs, but never giving the “Crush On You” star any credit.</p>
<p>Despite the beef having cooled down in recent years (aside from that moment in 2018 when Kim praised Nicki’s nemesis Cardi B and claimed to not “know the other one” aka the Miss Minaj, ahem), Usher recently mentioned the feud during an interview, calling Nicki “a product of Lil Kim” and the “Yikes” rapper has now gotten her subtle revenge. On “TROLLZ”, Nicki raps, “Somebody usher this n**** into a clinic / My flow’s still sick, I ain’t talkin’ a pandemic,” many think is a dig at Usher’s alleged herpes history.</p>
<p>A less subtle jab was thrown in the direction of LisaRaye McCoy who previously stated, “All of us are acknowledging the fact that Kim came before Nicki Minaj. So the Trinidadian-born, just take a seat.” Using a reference to LisaRaye’s 1998 film, “The Player’s Club”, the femcee mocked the actress’s husband allegedly cheating on her with Nicole Murphy by rapping, “Dollar, dollar bill, come get her / Even your man know Nicki do it better.”</p>
<p>The lyrics caused Lisa Raye to start trending on Twitter, but the 52-year-old said she had no idea it was even happening until her friend and fellow actress, Vivica A. Fox, filled her in. She explained to The Breakfast Club that she has no time for the Barbz, saying, “I’m way above anybody coming against somebody that they don’t know.”

<h3 id="first-stream-new-music-from-lil-baby-6ix9ine--nicki-minaj-chloe-x-halle--more">&ldquo;First Stream: New Music From Lil Baby, 6ix9ine &amp; Nicki Minaj, Chloe x Halle &amp; More&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.billboard.com/files/2020/03/lil-baby-live-march-2-2020-u-billboard-1548-1583774961-1024x677.jpg" alt="img">
Billboard’s First Stream serves as a handy guide to this Friday’s most essential releases — the key music that everyone will be talking about today, and that will be dominating playlists this weekend and beyond.</p>
<p>This week, Lil Baby reflects on the national protests, 6ix9ine and Nicki Minaj once again team up, and Chloe x Halle deliver on their promise. Check out all of this week’s First Stream picks below:</p>
<p>The Song That Will Help You Channel Your Anger:</p>
<p>Lil Baby, “The Bigger Picture”</p>
<p>Lil Baby is furious on “The Bigger Picture”: after an introduction that consists of a news report concerning the militarized police response to the George Floyd protests, the superstar MC unleashes over the beat, referencing his own time behind bars, the senselessness of violence against black Americans and his own inherent fear living in this type of society. Baby punches home point after point before arriving at a surprise feeling of hope on the chorus: “It can’t change overnight,” he croons, “But we gotta start somewhere.” Lil Baby has already released a best-selling album and fair amount of guest spots in 2020 &ndash; no one would blame him if he had rested on his laurels, but instead he made an unexpected return with a raw, righteous statement.</p>

<p>The Song That Everyone Will Be Arguing About on Social Media This Weekend:</p>
<p>6ix9ine &amp; Nicki Minaj, &ldquo;TROLLZ”</p>
<p>“I know you don’t like me / You wanna fight me.” Both 6ix9ine and Nicki Minaj rap these words in their latest collaboration, which follows their 2018 track “Fefe” and is built around the self-admitted polarizing nature of the collaborators. 6ix9ine, with his second track since his prison release, keeps his wild-eyed flow in check more often here than he did on “GOOBA,” although he punctuates his verse with a throat-clearing assault; meanwhile, Minaj, fresh off her first Hot 100 No. 1 with Doja Cat’s “Say So” remix, radiates slick confidence through sex euphemisms and nods to her longevity. 6ix9ine and Minaj have been divisive in different ways, yet they’ve given the Internet something else to talk about, and will likely keep doing so for a long time.</p>

<p>The Album That Makes Good on Years of Promise:</p>
<p>Chloe x Halle, Ungodly Hour</p>
<p>The talent of Chloe and Halle Bailey has been obvious for a while &ndash; after all, the best new artist Grammy nominees were signed to Beyonce’s management company a half-decade ago, back when they were in their early teens. Now 21 and 20, respectively, the sister duo is ready to unveil a collection of songs as wide-ranging and satisfying as their vocal skllls. Ungodly Hour lets Chloe x Halle explore a variety of sounds and ideas, from the radio-baiting pop of the Swae Lee/Mike WiLL Made-It collaboration “Catch Up” to the classic R&amp;B of the early standout “Forgive Me” to the rhythmic trap of “Do It” to the hilarious hip-hop kiss-off “Tipsy.” And for their part, they handle every style admirably and never sound out of place, making Ungodly Hour a freeform exercise of two dynamic voices today.</p>

<p>The Remix That Reckons With The History Books:</p>
<p>DaBaby feat. Roddy Ricch, “Rockstar” (Black Lives Matter remix)</p>
<p>As protests against police brutality and racial injustice rage on around the country, two black men &ndash; from Charlotte and Compton, respectively &ndash; are at the top of the charts, with DaBaby and Roddy Ricch’s “Rockstar” reaching No. 1 on the Hot 100 earlier this week. Unsatisfied with allowing their hit to reside in these trying times and not comment on the larger situation, the pair has released a “Black Lives Matter remix” of the track, in which DaBaby recounts his own run-ins with the law and the unique reality in which he lives as a successful black American. “They pushin&rsquo; negative narratives &ndash; I&rsquo;m ready though,” the quick-witted MC announces, addressing the unique moment in which he’s become a star and making the right call with this timely remix.</p>

<p>The Songs That Make a Breakthrough Album Even Bigger:</p>
<p>Maren Morris, &ldquo;Takes Two&quot;/&ldquo;Just For Now&quot;</p>
<p>“GIRL has been out over a year &amp; has been one of the most transformative periods of my life,” Maren Morris wrote to her fans earlier this week. “During this time off the road, I had the opportunity to polish up 2 older songs of mine that I couldn’t wait for you to hear.” Thus, “Takes Two” and “Just For Now” have been added as bonus tracks to Morris’ 2019 sophomore album, contributing to that album’s more mature vision of country-pop as compared to her 2017 debut Hero. “Just For Now” will delight listeners searching for a follow-up to Morris’ smash “The Bones,” while “Takes Two,” a more R&amp;B-indebted tune with a yearning vocal performance and fuller production, suggests a new path for the singer-songwriter moving forward.</p>

<p>The Song That Addresses The Deep Wounds of Yesterday and Today:</p>
<p>Leon Bridges feat. Terrace Martin, &ldquo;Sweeter&quot;</p>
<p>“I thought we moved on from the darker days,” Leon Bridges sings on “Sweeter,” the words tumbling out of his mouth in a swirl of pain and confusion. The singer-songwriter’s new collaboration with Terrace Martin comes from the perspective of a black taking his last breath before being wrongfully killed &ndash; a harrowing, timely portrait of racism that Bridges makes both personal and universal, letting the hurt seep into his soulful voice and crack through his always-steady demeanor. “Sweeter” sounds designed for this moment, but like so much of Bridges’ music, will likely endure long beyond it.</p>

<p>The Song That Will Make You Miss an Artist Even More:</p>
<p>Pop Smoke feat. Rowdy Rebel, “Make It Rain”</p>
<p>The shooting death of Pop Smoke in February, just days after his project Meet The Woo Vol. 2 became his first top 10 album on the Billboard 200 chart, is a human and artistic tragedy &ndash; the Brooklyn rapper was just 20 years old, and was about to become a flat-out superstar based on his unique sound and mic command. “Make It Rain,” the first release from an upcoming posthumous full-length, is classic Pop Smoke, with a wall-shattering beat and enough chest-thumping lyrics to ensure that the rapper’s gravelly voice never loses your attention. Listening to the song in the greater context of a career cut way too short makes for a jarring experience, yet “Make It Rain” also capture Pop Smoke at his most triumphant, and it’s a fitting pose.</p>

<p>The Video That&rsquo;s Both Eye-Popping and Gut-Busting:</p>
<p>J Balvin, &ldquo;Azul&quot; video</p>
<p>In the age of quarantining, artists have had to get creative with their music videos &ndash; and with the clip for &ldquo;Azul,&rdquo; J Balvin has decided to view that burst of creativity and one-up his competition. The wild, sexually explicit, oft-hysterical computer-animated video finds Balvin falling for a mail-ordered robe-girlfriend, who&hellip; proceeds to cheat on him. Will the superstar win her back by video&rsquo;s end? What comic reactions will his dog provide? &ldquo;Azul&rdquo; keeps you hooked until the end, and Balvin, always a daring visual artist, goes full Pixar here.</p>

<p>The Album To Put On This Sunday Morning:</p>
<p>Norah Jones, Pick Me Up Off The Floor</p>
<p>As her landmark 2002 release Come Away With Me approaches its 20-year anniversary, Norah Jones has continued to grind out layered, deeply felt albums with no intentions of ever topping that blockbuster commercially. That’s perfectly fine: Pick Me Up Off The Floor, her first proper full-length since 2016’s Day Breaks, gathers songs left over from shorter sessions and comprises them into a meditation on a dismal national period and recovery from greater sadness. The arrangements vary and sometimes stray from Jones’ piano-rooted jazz, but offer a uniform intimacy as the singer-songwriter’s voice spins off the ground like a well-worn magic trick. It’s a careful, heartfelt album made from a total pro, and is worth the time of longtime fans as well as those who only know “Don’t Know Why.”</p>
