The second season of NBC’s Manifest ended on a good note Monday, earning a one-tenth boost in the adults 18-49 demographic with a 0.8 rating and 4.58 million viewers. The Voice (1.5, 9.49M) led into the sci-fi drama, taking a two-tenths hit in the demo but still topping all primetime shows with its two-hour episode. The pair gave NBC the No. 1 spot for the night in both metrics.</p>
<p>CBS saw the return of its Monday lineup with The Neighborhood (1.0, 7.27M) and Bob Hearts Abishola (0.8, 6.64M) slipping in the demo. The second half of the evening saw season-best audience numbers for All Rise (0.7, 6.08M) and Bull (0.7, 7.13M), which both held steady in the demo.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, ABC aired the special Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Secrets &amp; Surprises (0.5, 2.97M) to bookend a night of Celebrity Family Feud repeats. At The CW, Whose Line is it Anyway? (0.2, 969,000) and Roswell, New Mexico (0.1, 605,000) were steady.</p>
<p>Fox aired repeats.

<h3 id="manifest-season-2-finale-leaves-big-twists-as-fans-await-show-renewal">Manifest season 2 finale leaves big twists as fans await show renewal</h3>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PRI_148120146_1586294517.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;crop=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
Manifest season two ended with a huge twist and fans have questions (Picture: NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images)</p>
<p>The Manifest season 2 finale definitely opened up way more questions about the show than fans could have expected.</p>
<p>And now we are all waiting to hear if the NBC show has been renewed for a third season following the very emotional and confusing end on Monday night.</p>
<p>The trouble is we could be waiting for quite some time considering the fact it took two whole months for the show to be renewed after the finale of the first season.</p>
<p>And with production of TV shows at a halt due to the coronavirus lockdown, fans could be waiting even longer for the news they so desperately crave.</p>
<p>What happened in the Manifest season 2 finale?</p>
<p>Even when the show does get renewed, God only knows when it will actually return to screens and begin to explain the many questions we were left with in the emotional season 2 finale.</p>
<p>We have to wait patiently to see if Michaela and the gang will be back on screens for another season (Pictures: NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images)</p>
<p>We saw Zeke (Matt Long) manage to seemingly defy his death date after saving Cal (Jack Messina). So now Michaela (Melissa Roxburgh) and Ben (Josh Dallas) reckon following your calling might be the way to defeat the death date.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the criminals who kidnapped Cal seemed to fall to their deaths in an icy lake.</p>
<p>The dark lightening continues to mystify… Oh and Saanvi (Parveen Kaur) killed the Major, too! Though she did it believing that it would help her save Zeke’s life, but now she finds herself a darker place than she could have anticipated.</p>
<p>Show creator Jeff Rake has promised season three would look into Sanvi’s dark turn (Picture: NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images)</p>
<p>And then Ben had another calling of Flight 828 where he saw the plane burn in the air and fall into the ocean below, as the scene cut to real-life fisherman pulling the plane’s tail fin out of the ocean.</p>
<p>Yes, the tail of the very same airplane which came back to New York in the show’s pilot episode.</p>
<p>Will Manifest return for third series?</p>
<p>There are definitely a lot of questions to be answered in a potential season 3, and the good news it that the show’s creator Jeff Rake has a six-season plan in place.</p>
<p>If the show gets renewed, Jeff not only plans to introduce new characters but he will also show more about what has happened to the meth-heads as well as our favourite characters.</p>
<p>Speaking to EW, he stated: ‘I will spoil a little bit here in the sense that throughout the two seasons of Manifest, we’ve seen a couple examples of others, outside of the Flight 828 community, experiencing this idea of death and return.</p>
<p>And the meth-heads will be popping up again too if the show gets renewed (Photo by: NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images)</p>
<p>‘We saw first with Zeke, then soon after with Griffin and now we’re experiencing it with the meth heads. When the meth heads return — and I don’t think I’m giving away too much because I think that 99 percent of the audience deduced from the season finale that we haven’t seen the last of these guys — that is going to reinvent the dynamic of others outside the 828 community, who experience death and return.’</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>He continued: ‘How these three individuals experience their return and what they choose to do with it, is going to have mythological implications that are probably more significant than anything else that has happened since the pilot.</p>
<p>That shoe will drop by the middle of season 3 and it’s going change the playing field for the rest of the series going forward. I can’t overstate the importance of these three individuals.’</p>
<p>While we can’t be sure that the show will run for the full six season as Jeff (and fans) hope for, the next season certainly going to take us all on another wild ride if it gets the chance.</p>
