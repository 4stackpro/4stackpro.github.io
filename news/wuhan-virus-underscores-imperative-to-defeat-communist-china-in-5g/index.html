Imagine what kind of leverage communist China would have over us if Huawei controlled the flow of information on which our increasingly digitized economy and society depends.</p>
<p>While lawmakers like Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., rightly begin taking measures to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for the devastation wrought by the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic it caused, the Trump administration has provided a timely reminder of perhaps the most vital area where we must counter-punch. On March 23, pursuant to the signing of the Secure 5G and Beyond Act, the White House released its National Strategy to Secure 5G plan.</p>
<p>The plan lays out President Donald Trump’s “vision for America to lead the development, deployment, and management of secure and reliable 5G communications infrastructure worldwide, arm-in-arm with our closest partners and allies.” According to the administration, the high-level strategy is meant to complement the Secure and Trusted Communications Network Act, and will be followed by a more detailed implementation plan.</p>
<p>The development and execution of such a plan cannot come soon enough. Time is short, and America lags far behind the malevolent leader in the space: communist China by way of Huawei, the world’s largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer. The all-critical fifth generation or 5G networking technology will serve as the backbone for all global telecommunications and flow of information, including enabling the “internet of things.”</p>
<p>Huawei is an organ of the Chinese government, and allegedly a vital cog in its intelligence apparatus. Not that the concept of the rule of law exists in communist China anyway, but at minimum, its national security and intelligence laws seem to dictate that Huawei serve the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) spying apparatus whenever deemed necessary.</p>
<p>Huawei’s rise has been aided by substantial CCP support, alleged intellectual property theft, and the willful blindness of those with which it has transacted. So it has been able to undercut competition, while pursuing competitors’ crown jewels and expanding its business around the world, helping lead it to dominate in market share.</p>
<p>China’s 5G Plans Threaten Liberty and Security</p>
<p>Huawei is a preeminent symbol of China’s overall rise, but it is far more than that. It might be the single most critical entity to the CCP’s overall effort to achieve international domination.</p>
<p>In China’s effort to monopolize strategically significant industries and leverage its monopolies so other nations bend to the CCP’s aims — whether in terms of its national security or ability to project power — there may well be nothing more important than controlling the “Digital Silk Road” of global telecommunications.</p>
<p>Estimated trillions of dollars ride on the development of 5G. The technology is made even more valuable given that it is “dual-use,” meaning there are both civilian and military applications for it. That America and the entire free world is far behind in this competition is unacceptable. It poses a dire risk to our liberty and security.</p>
<p>During the Wuhan virus pandemic, we have seen the CCP threaten American lives through its control over medical supplies and willingness to withhold it from those in need. Imagine what kind of leverage the CCP would have over us if Huawei controlled the flow of information on which our increasingly digitized economy and society depends, including the internet of things.</p>
<p>Consider an even more fundamental problem. As national security adviser Robert O’Brien framed it rhetorically in a December 2019 interview, “What if, for democracies, China knew every single personal, private piece of information about any of us?”</p>
<p>How to Stop Communist China</p>
<p>While the U.S. government has taken a number of steps to keep Huawei’s technology out of America, far too many of our allies have allowed the CCP into their networking infrastructure by cutting deals with Huawei, in spite of serious warnings of the consequences, including curtailed intelligence sharing.</p>
<p>The CCP’s efforts to cover up the coronavirus outbreak, sow discord across the globe for casualties it helped create, and now to portray itself as a model for recovery and a savior for ailing people the world over lays bare the fact that it views this pandemic as a major threat to its plans for global domination.</p>
<p>Central to that plan is control over 5G. Therefore, there may be no single greater blow to the hegemonic ambitions of the tyrannical, imperialist, human rights-squelching CCP regime than the effective countering of its plan to sell us the digital rope with which to hang ourselves through 5G technology.</p>
<p>On top of vigorously pursuing a reparations plan, America must also effectively punish the CCP by disrupting its plans for global dominance in 5G and redouble our demands that U.S. allies do the same, including pulling out of existing agreements with Huawei.</p>
<p>There must also be a whole-society effort to develop secure and equally advanced 5G technology. Deterrence is not enough. The West competing, and ultimately triumphing, is imperative. In fact, this competition should serve as the centerpiece of an America First effort to rebuild our capacities in every strategically significant sector.</p>
<p>We are vulnerable not just because communist China effectively dominates the markets in medicine and telecommunications technology, but because of the approximately 300 gaps in our defense-industrial base, many of which China fills. If there were ever a wake-up call for the entire world of the dire consequence of partnering with the CCP in any strategically significant area, not least 5G, the Wuhan virus pandemic should be it.

<p>Washington- Jim Rossman</p>
<p>This week a reader wrote: “I have searched the Internet for an explanation about what 5G is, what it will do, and why it is so great. All I get is a lot of technical information about what is different about it and 4G, claims that it is going to save the world with respect to health without saying why or how, and that that reception speed or something like that will be so fast it will make us think we are in heaven rather than on earth.”</p>
<p>Hmm. I can tell you what 5G is, but I’ll need some (divine?) help to tell you why it might make you think you’re in heaven.</p>
<p>5G is a wireless technology that can transfer data over the air from cell towers to phones and other devices at much faster speeds than we have now.</p>
<p>Think about the broadband internet connection at your home.</p>
<p>I’ll use my house as an example. I have AT&amp;T internet (not fiber or gigabit). My internet plan’s connection speed is advertised to be 28 megabits per second. This is the speed of downloads from the internet to my house.</p>
<p>I ran a quick test at Speedtest.net, and my download speed is 28.05 Mbps. You can’t get much closer to advertised speeds (thanks, AT&amp;T).</p>
<p>Last week I was able to test Verizon’s 5G network in the Dallas Medical District using the new Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra, and that same speed test showed a download speed of 975 Mbps.</p>
<p>Simple math tells me that 5G connection is almost 35 times faster than my home internet, and it comes through the air, not through a wire that has to connect to my house.</p>
<p>Not all 5G is the same</p>
<p>There are different types of 5G based on the part of the radio spectrum in use.</p>
<p>Low-band uses 600 megahertz, 800 MHz and 900 MHz and has a peak download speed of around 100 Mbps.</p>
<p>Midband uses frequencies from 2.5 gigahertz to 4.2 GHz with peak speeds of 1 gigabit per second.</p>
<p>High-band uses several bands between 24 GHz and 47 GHz and it offers peak speeds up to 10 gigabits per second.</p>
<p>You might see the midband referred to as Sub-6, while the high bands are also called millimeter Wave.</p>
<p>So lower bands are slower, but the signal travels much farther from the tower and penetrates buildings better.</p>
<p>Higher bands are much faster, but the signal doesn’t travel as far from the towers, so you need higher tower density to get good coverage. It also doesn’t penetrate buildings very well.</p>
<p>Midband is a good mix of speed, distance, and building penetration.</p>
<p>According to Digital Trends, T-Mobile uses a lot of low-band spectrum, Sprint owns a majority of the midband, and AT&amp;T and Verizon are rolling out high-band.</p>
<p>In use</p>
<p>Aside from faster phone data connections, 5G can bring much faster internet to your home — if you live in range. Right now, most people in Dallas/Fort Worth can get home internet through only one phone company and one cable company.</p>
<p>Today, if I want 1 Gbps service at my home, I have to call my phone or cable company and have them run a new wire to my house.</p>
<p>How great will it be if three or four wireless companies are all competing to sell 5G service for your home without needing to install anything more than a small wireless hotspot to make it happen?</p>
<p>There are also potential uses in health care (perhaps remote robotic surgery), self-driving cars (they need huge amounts of data to move down the street) and even smart infrastructure that could allow a city’s traffic signals to talk to one another. It could improve vehicle safety, for example, if your new car knows how soon a traffic light will change so you have more time to react at a busy intersection.</p>
<p>5G is going to change our lives. It might not be very evident for the next year to two, but I believe it will be significant. In five to 10 years, we might marvel at ever having had wired internet connections.</p>
<p>I’m ready, and I hope this cleared things up a bit.</p>

<h3 id="5g-explained-what-it-is-who-has-5g-and-how-much-faster-is-it-really">5G explained: What it is, who has 5G, and how much faster is it really?</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200306135609-20200306-what-is-5g-super-169.jpg" alt="img">
With 5G, signals run over new radio frequencies, which requires updating radios and other equipment on cell towers. There are three different methods for building a 5G network, depending on the type of assets a wireless carrier has: low-band network (wide coverage area but only about 20% faster than 4G), high-band network (superfast speeds but signals don’t travel well and struggle to move through hard surfaces) and mid-band network (balances speed and coverage).</p>
<p>Carriers building superfast 5G networks must install tons of small cell sites — about the size of pizza boxes — to light poles, walls or towers, often in relatively small proximity to one another. For that reason, superfast networks are mostly being deployed city by city. Eventually, most US carriers will have a mix of the different network types that will enable both broad coverage and fast speeds.
