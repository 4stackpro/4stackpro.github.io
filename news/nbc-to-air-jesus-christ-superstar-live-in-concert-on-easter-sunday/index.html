<p>Introduction and Your Acceptance of These Terms</p>
<p>Broadway Direct (&ldquo;Us&rdquo;, &ldquo;We&rdquo;, &ldquo;Our&rdquo;) knows that your personal information is very important to you, and We respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and protected and the choices available to you with respect to Our handling of your data. This Policy applies to all visitors to Broadway Direct.com, Our mobile services, services available via telephone, and those transactions that take place in person, by postal or electronic mail. (Collectively, the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;), including ticket sales, comments on articles, and any information provided to Us.. By visiting this website, you consent and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and to the collection, use and storage of your information by Us. From time to time, We may change this Privacy Policy. When We do, the “Last Updated” line above will be revised. You are responsible for regularly reviewing this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this Site following the posting of a changed Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance of the changes.

If you require any more information or have any questions about Our privacy policy, please feel free to contact Us by email at [email protected].</p>
<p>Information We Collect</p>
<p>Information we collect directly from you: Your provision of your personal information to Us is completely voluntary; it is not a statutory or contractual requirement. Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) is information that is uniquely identifiable to you, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, credit card number and other personal information that is not otherwise publicly available. Certain features of Our website may require that you provide Us with your personal information, including:</p>
<p>Contests/Sweepstakes Surveys Newsletter Sign-Up Mobile Alert Sign-Up (SMS) Contact Us (email) Public forums (e.g. message boards) E-commerce (ticket purchases)</p>
<p>To use these features, We may require you to provide your email address, mobile number, name and/or address and certain demographic information. When you give Us PII to use the features above, you expressly consent to Our collection, storage, use and disclosure of this information as described in this Privacy Policy. We may use your personal information to communicate with you about:</p>
<p>Your use of any of the features above; New content on Our website; New contests; Prize information; News that We think may interest you about Us; Responses to your questions/comments to us; and Information relating to a ticket purchase.</p>
<p>We may use your demographic information for in house statistics, advertising and marketing target information. Our processing of your personal information is necessary for the performance and fulfillment of the contract between us and to provide you with Our services. We will also process, transfer, disclose and preserve personal information when We have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary, to resolve disputes, enforce our agreements and otherwise required by law. You can always opt-out of receiving future promotional communications from Us; see the Choice/Opt-out section below. Information We Collect Automatically: Even if you don’t use any of the features above, when you visit Our website, We may collect certain information about you.</p>

The information collected may include among other data: your IP address, your registered domain or home server, time of access, date of access, web page(s) visited, number of clicks, software crash reports, type of browser used, session identification number, search terms, search results, access times and referring website’s address. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with Our server and to administer Our website.

We use such data in the aggregate to run internal analyses to improve upon your experience on Our website.</p>

<p>Public Forums</p>
<p>Please be aware that when you disclose PII through the comment feature or message board on the Site, the information may become public and accessible to all or a part of the Site community, so it is important for you to exercise discretion and appropriate caution when deciding to reveal PII in these areas. In addition, when you choose to make a posting, certain PII may be available for other users to view. We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to disclose your PII, or any other information, on the Site. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE OF ANY PII YOU VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSE THROUGH THE SITE VIA THESE FORUMS AND OTHER INTERACTIVE FEATURES. Please note that We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to republish content posted (including any PII contained therein) as further set forth in Our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>Co-Branded Pages</p>
<p>We may enter into relationships with “powered by” partners, business partners, sponsors, and co-branded sites (referred to here as “co-branded pages”). These might include, for example, pages that share our name and that of another entity. There may be a specific privacy policy on any such co-branded page. Any personal information that you provide when signing up at any co-branded page may be collected by, or shared with, our third party partner. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, our third party partners’ use of your personal information. If you want to learn more about other entities’ privacy practices, please review the websites of those third parties.</p>
<p>Transactions With Third Party E-commerce Partners, Vendors and Advertisers</p>
<p>When you provide personal information to one of Our Site’s third party e-commerce partners, vendors or advertisers (i.e. Ticketmaster.com, Telecharge.com), this transaction will occur in connection with the site of the e-commerce partner, vendor or advertiser, not on the Site, and, as such, the personal information you provide is collected pursuant to and controlled by the privacy policy of such e-commerce partner, vendor or advertiser. Broadway Direct is not responsible for such parties’ privacy policies and We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the applicable privacy policy of the e-commerce site with which you transact business or to contact the operator of such site for more information.</p>
<p>Delivery of Advertising and Other Content</p>
<p>In addition to ads and content that We may serve you directly, We use third-party advertising companies and marketing services companies to serve ads and other content when you visit Broadway Direct and elsewhere on the internet and in other media. Both We and these companies may use information about your visits to Broadway Direct and elsewhere to serve ads and other content to you. In the course of doing so, a unique third-party cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser by such companies. In addition, We and these companies may use Web beacons to help manage Our online advertising and content. These Web beacons enable Us and the third-party companies to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits this Site and to learn which banner ads bring users to our website and to serve you ads that you may find of interest elsewhere on the internet and in other media. Both Broadway Direct and these companies may use information obtained from your visits to Broadway Direct or other websites, and information received from you offline in order to provide advertisements about goods and services and other content of interest to you across the internet and in other media. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used in this manner by Our third party advertising companies, please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a> and/or <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>. European users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising by visiting <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/</a>. In addition, we may provide PII and Anonymous Information to marketing services companies. This may include information we received from you offline or online. These companies may combine information we provide (including PII and Anonymous Information) with personal and anonymous information they may have about you, using cookies they place or that We place on their behalf, as described in the section regarding “Cookies and Tracking Tags”. We require these companies to delete the PII we provide them. These companies may use the resulting non-personal information and such cookies for their own marketing purposes, and they may provide the same to their customers for their customer’s marketing purposes. Some of Our emails may contain tags that allow Us and Our advertisers and other partners to determine the types of content that may be of interest to you. Those tags may contain PII and may be shared with others to the same extent indicated in the section regarding “Cookies and Tracking Tags”. Those tags may not be deleted but you can opt out of receiving the emails.</p>
<p>Use of This Site by Children</p>
<p>The Site is not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and We request that such individuals do not provide personal information through the Site. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided Us with PII without the parent or guardian’s consent by, for example, misrepresenting his or her age, that parent or guardian should contact us at [email protected]. If Broadway Direct determines that it has collected personal information of children under the age of 13, Broadway Direct will immediately delete such information and any accounts believed to be held by children under 13. In addition, we may not collect or process information from a citizen of an EU member state under the age of sixteen (16) without such person’s parental consent. If you are a citizen of an EU member state under the age of 16, please tell your parents that you are using the Site and have your parents email Us at [email protected] so that We may delete any information We may have collected about you.</p>

<p>California Civil Code § 1798.83 permits California residents to request information about whether we have disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. California residents have the right to request in writing: (a) a list of the categories of Personal Information, such as name, email address and mailing address and the type of services provided to the customer that a business has disclosed to third parties (including affiliates that are separate legal entities) during the immediately preceding calendar year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes and (b) the names and addresses of all such third parties. To make a request, please contact Us at the following email address: [email protected].</p>

<h3 id="saturday-night-live-will-air-this-weekend-with-a-remotely-produced-episode">Saturday Night Live will air this weekend with a remotely produced episode</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.timeout.com/images/105634831/image.jpg" alt="img">
So much for a live studio audience.</p>
<p>As many of us have gotten used to the new normal of working largely from home, the country&rsquo;s television hosts and performers have been right there with us.</p>
<p>Ellen Degeneres, Wendy Williams and more have recently filmed episodes of their shows from home, produced entirely remotely. (With varying results. Though these videos of Wendy Williams doing Hot Topics while eating are mesmerizing.)</p>
<p>Now, the cast of Saturday Night Live is throwing their hats in the WFH ring with an episode scheduled to air over the weekend that’s been produced entirely remotely.</p>
<p>Just think of all of the new absurdities of life there are to mine for laughs: Zoombombing! Children interrupting company-wide meetings! New York&rsquo;s hottest club is Instagram Live!</p>
<p>The week’s show is set to feature sketches from cast members as well as a version of Weekend Update hosted by head co-writers Colin Jost and Michael Che. The rest of the line-up remains under wraps.</p>
<p>According to the Hollywood Reporter, the episode also won’t have a host (other than a very powerful internet service provider, we assume). There’s been no confirmation on whether or not Saturday Night Live will resume any sort of regular schedule for the rest of the season after this weekend.</p>
<p>Saturday’s episode is set to air April 11 at 11:30pm.</p>

<h3 id="how-long-will-coronavirus-live-on-surfaces-or-in-the-air-around-you">How Long Will Coronavirus Live on Surfaces or in the Air Around You?</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/19/science/17VIRUS-GERMS1/17VIRUS-GERMS1-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
Dr. Marr said based on physics, an aerosol released at a height of about six feet would fall to the ground after 34 minutes. The findings should not cause the general public to panic, however, because the virus disperses quickly in the air.</p>
<p>“It sounds scary,” she said, “but unless you’re close to someone, the amount you’ve been exposed to is very low.”</p>
<p>Dr. Marr compared this to cigarette smoke or a foggy breath on a frosty day. The closer and sooner another person is to the exhaled smoke or breath, the more of a whiff they might catch; for anyone farther than a few feet away, there is too little of the virus in the air to be any danger.</p>
<p>To assess the ability of the virus to survive in the air, the researchers created what Dr. Munster described as “bizarre experiments done under very ideal controllable experimental conditions.” They used a rotating drum to suspend the aerosols, and provided temperature and humidity levels that closely mimic hospital conditions.</p>
<p>In this setup, the virus survived and stayed infectious for up to three hours, but its ability to infect drops sharply over this time, he said.</p>
<p>He said the aerosols might stay aloft only for about 10 minutes, but Dr. Marr disagreed with that assessment, and said they could stay in the air for three times longer. She also said that the experimental setup might be less comfortable for the virus than a real-life setting.</p>
<p>For example, she said, the researchers used a relative humidity of 65 percent. “Many, but not all viruses, have shown that they survive worst at this level of humidity,” she said. They do best at lower or much higher humidity. The humidity in a heated house is less than 40 percent, “at which the virus might survive even longer,” she said.
