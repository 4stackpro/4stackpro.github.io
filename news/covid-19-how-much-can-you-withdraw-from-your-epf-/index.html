If you are facing a financial crunch due to the Coronavirus Disease’s (COVID-19) economic impact, you can now dip into your employees’ provident fund (EPF) corpus to survive the crisis. After Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s announcement on March 26 permitting such withdrawals, the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has now operationalised the process for facilitating this withdrawal. It is termed ‘non-refundable advance’ in official parlance.</p>
<p>Read on to know more about the modalities of the withdrawal:</p>
<p>Who can make withdrawals citing COVID-19 hardships?</p>
<p>All employees who contribute to the EPF by way of mandatory deduction of 12 percent from their basic salaries every month can use this facility. According to the finance minister, this will benefit close to 4.8 crore employees registered with the EPFO.</p>
<p>What is the amount that can be withdrawn?</p>
<p>You can withdraw up to 75 per cent of your EPF account balance or three months’ basic wages or the amount that you actually need, whichever is lower.</p>
<p>Employers match employees’ PF contribution every month. Out of the employers’ contribution, 8.33 per cent is directed towards EPS (employees’ pension scheme). The EPF balance at any point in time is the sum of employers’ and employees’ EPF contributions plus the interest accrued over time. Put simply, your accumulated PF corpus.</p>
<p>For example, if your EPF balance on March 31, 2020 is Rs 10 lakh and your basic salary is Rs 50,000 per month, you will be able to withdraw only Rs 1.5 lakh. On the other hand, if your balance is Rs 2 lakh and basic monthly salary amounts to Rs 51,000, you can still withdraw only .</p>
<p>What constitutes basic wages?</p>
<p>Typically, your basic salary and dearness allowance, if any, will constitute basic wages. To figure out the actual amount, you need to check your salary slip. “The salary component on which 12 per cent has been deducted as your PF contribution will constitute basic wages,” explains Parizad Sirwalla, Partner and Head, Global Mobility Services, Tax, KPMG. Typically, this will be the amount tagged as ‘basic pay.’</p>
<p>In 2019, a Supreme Court ruling required employers to include certain allowances that have been paid regularly and uniformly for that employee category in the ambit of basic salary. “Our understanding is that &lsquo;basic wages&rsquo; definition may tend to vary as per the employer. Also, the verdict is relevant largely for relatively low-earners whose basic salary is less than Rs 15,000,” says Archit Gupta, CEO and Founder, ClearTax. For those in the middle and higher-income groups, the basic salary as specified by their organisation will be taken into account.</p>
<p>Will I have to pay tax on the withdrawal?</p>
<p>Clarity is awaited on this matter, but the amount is unlikely to be taxed, as it will then defeat the purpose of allowing this leeway. “The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) will likely issue a notification stating that the amount withdrawn during this period will not be subject to tax. Ordinarily, except under a few circumstances, if you make a withdrawal before the period of continuous membership (employment) specified, the amount will be added to your income and taxed at your slab rate,” says Gupta. For example, if you want to withdraw funds to buy or construct a house, you can do so, subject to limits , only after five years of continuous EPF subscription.

<h3 id="covid-19-impact-govt-relaxes-rules-for-withdrawal-from-epfo-accounts">Covid-19 impact: Govt relaxes rules for withdrawal from EPFO accounts</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.livemint.com/img/2020/03/29/600x338/d28e62b2-5edf-11ea-98cb-cb624a7c9c7a_1583474428335_1585481562720.jpg" alt="img">
NEW DELHI: The labour ministry on Sunday issued a notification allowing millions of subscribers of the employees’ provident fund organization (EPFO) to withdraw a portion of their retirement savings with immediate effect amid the Covid-19 lockdown.</p>
<p>As per the gazette notification, EPFO subscribers can withdraw 75% of their savings or up to a maximum of three months&rsquo; basic pay and dearness allowance from their PF account – whichever is lower. Once a subscriber withdraws the amount, it cannot be replenished after the situation improves.</p>
<p>Unlike, other withdrawals, the retirement fund manager has promised to honour the withdrawal requests within three days. While the move is an enabling provision and likely to benefit thousands, it has its own share of operational challenges at the current nationwide lock-down scenario.</p>
<p>“Please note that the Covid-19 has been declared a Pandemic by appropriate Government for the entire country and therefore the employees working in establishments and factories across entire India, who are members of the EPF Scheme, 1952, are eligible for the benefits of non-refundable advance under the sub-para (3) of Para 68L which has come into force from today&rdquo;, said the notification, which comes into effect immediately.</p>
<p>The pandemic withdrawal adds to a select list of events under which subscribers are allowed non-refundable withdrawal. Other than the new pandemic withdrawal provision, subscribers are currently allowed to withdraw for house construction, marriage and education of children, illness and unemployment.</p>
<p>Unlike, other EPF withdrawals which takes anywhere between three days to three weeks, request of withdrawal under the new pandemic rules of the pension fund will be honoured within three days. EPFO has an active subscriber’s base of 60 million and the fund manager manages a total corpus of over Rs. 12 trillion.</p>
<p>“The notification amends the EPF Scheme, 1952 by inserting Sub-Para (3) under Para 68L of the EPF Scheme, 1952 to provide for non-refundable advance to EPF members not exceeding the basic wages and dearness allowances for three months or upto 75% of the amount standing to member’s credit in the EPF account in the event of outbreak of epidemic or pandemic,&rdquo; the notification added.</p>
<p>Sunil Barthwal, Cenral Provident Fund Commissioner (CPFC), said EPFO updated its software Sunday forenoon to take online requests of withdrawals. &ldquo;Subscribers who are KYC complaint and have seeded their UAN (universal account number) with Aadhaar and bank account can make a request online,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>But there is an operational challenge. Since all EPF accounts are not Aadhaar seeded, all subscribers may not be able to able to withdraw on their own. During the current lockdown, it will be tough for companies’ especially micros and small factories, real estate and small retail firms to process such request as offices are closed delaying the process.</p>
<p>Experts said that the union government mentioned this withdraw plan in its Covid-19 financial package and projected it as a relief measure, which the government has now operationalized.</p>
<p>“This is an enabling provision and not a relief measure. Second, the plan has certain operational challenges like can all needy subscribers do it on their own…what about migrant workers in construction sectors who are on a move now. EPFO subscribers who will perhaps exercise this relaxation are employees with lower salaries and here their offices will play a key role in effecting the withdrawal in time. How many small companies can actually do this during the countrywide lockdown is another question,&rdquo; said K. R. ShyamSundar, a labor expert and professor at XLRI Jamshedpur.</p>
<p>How to withdraw PF on account of Covid-19:</p>
<p>To make that request, you need to log in to your UAN account through this link &ndash; <a href="https://unifiedportal-mem.epfindia.gov.in/memberinterface/">https://unifiedportal-mem.epfindia.gov.in/memberinterface/</a>. Go to online services and click on claim form. It will re-direct you to a page that has all your details and will also ask you to validate your bank account by entering the last four digit of your bank account number. Once done, you can proceed for online claim. You will then have to click on PF advance form 31 and then from the drop down list for reasons you need to select outbreak of pandemic COVID-19.</p>
<p>You need to feed details such as how much you want as advance and the address. &ldquo;75% or 3 months salary or requested amount, whichever is lower is automatically taken by the system. We will be uploading detailed instructions shortly,&rdquo; said an EPFO official who didn&rsquo;t want to be quoted.</p>
<p>This page will then also ask you to upload scanned copy of your bank cheque or passbook. As per the website, only JPG and JPEG file of minimum 100 KB and maximum 500 KB size is supported and the document clearly needs to display bank account number and IFSC and name of the account holder. You will then have to validate the request through an Aadhaar OTP and according to the press brief, this amount should get credited into your account in three working days.</p>
