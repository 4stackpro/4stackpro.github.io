Mauro Ferrari resigned unexpectedly as president of the European Research Council, triggering a noisy public spat over why and how he left.</p>
<p>Ferrari, an Italian-American expert in nano-medicine, fired off an angry resignation memo – provided first to the Financial Times – castigating the European Commission for “a largely uncoordinated cluster of initiatives.” He said he pushed to have the ERC, which focuses on frontier research, launch a special funding round for COVID-19 research. As a result, he said, “I have lost faith in the system itself” and submitted his resignation on 7 April.</p>
<p>But that version of events was quickly disputed in Brussels. Christian Ehler, a German member of the European Parliament who leads research legislation, issued a late-night statement calling Ferrari’s actions “a window-dressing public relations stand on the coronavirus crisis and it was a contradiction to the legal basis of the ERC.”</p>
<p>Other sources said the agency’s governing body, the 21-member Scientific Council, had decided days earlier to ask for Ferrari’s resignation. Among the issues was a belief that he was spending too much time on non-ERC, private activities.</p>
<p>The Commission issued a statement confirming Ferrari’s immediate resignation and noting that his contract as ERC president only gave him the legal powers of a “special advisor” to the Commission. Legally, it said, the Scientific Council “defines the scientific funding strategy and methodologies of the ERC.” It went on to thank him “for the strong personal investment” he made in the months leading up to his appointment 1 January.</p>
<p>When he took office on 1 January, Ferrari was allowed to continue some outside activities back in the US, where he had built his career in engineering, nanotechnology and medicine. Among these was a paid board position at a US biotech company, Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals. He also continued as an affiliate professor in pharmaceutical science at the University of Washington. But the arrangement was unusual for an agency like the ERC, and had already prompted some outside criticism. As European nations began entering COVID-19 lockdown last month, he was in the US, where his grown children work.</p>
<p>A Commission spokesman late on 7 April confirmed Ferrari’s resignation, but declined to elaborate. Ferrari couldn’t be reached immediately for direct comment, but the Financial Times published his statement excoriating the ERC and the Commission.</p>
<p>In the statement, he said that he proposed that the ERC set up a special COVID-19 programme, because “at a time like this, the very best scientists in the world should be provided with resources and opportunities to fight the pandemic.” He said it was rejected unanimously by the Scientific Council “without even considering what shape or form it may take.” He added that he was later invited by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen “for my input” on COVID-19, which created “an internal political thunderstorm” inside the Commission bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The ERC, by law, funds research proposed directly by scientists – based on their own judgment of what’s important; they get the money - €2.2 billion in all for 2020 – if peer review panels organised by the agency agrees with them. Ferrari’s statement says he knew his idea for “top-down” COVID-19 grants ran counter to the agency’s normal “bottom-up” practice, but it was justified by the emergency.</p>
<p>Agency officials declined to comment publicly, but the MEP, Ehler, issued a public defence of the ERC, pushing back at Ferrari.</p>
<p>Besides calling Ferrari’s COVID-19 plan “window-dressing,” Ehler said Ferrari was “never really acquainting with the independent nature of the ERC.” He continued: “We are sorry that things have turned out this way for a brilliant researcher and entrepreneur like Mr. Ferrari. However, this should not serve as argument to accuse the ERC or the EU of not doing enough.”</p>
<p>The ERC focuses on fundamental rather than applied research – and numbers among its existing grantees virologists, epidemiologists and others who have been doing basic research for the agency, and have now joined applied COVID-research teams in the Commission’s other programmes.</p>
<p>They include €48.5 million for emergency Horizon 2020 collaborative projects for vaccines, cures and tools; €45 million to its Innovative Medicines Initiative; €80 million in financial support for German vaccine maker Curevac; and up to €164 million in grants to small business with COVID-19 solutions to develop.</p>
<p>On taking office in January, Ferrari quickly unveiled ambitious plans for the ERC. In an interview with Science|Business in February, he spoke enthusiastically of the need for what he called “super-disciplinary” research, in which scientists break out of their normal disciplines and think across domains. He was also a strong advocate of researchers helping to get their discoveries commercialised and into widespread use – something he did repeatedly in his own career.</p>
<p>Ferrari, now 60 years old, is credited as one of the founders of nanomedicine. In 2016, his research team made headlines with a new cancer treatment that uses nanoparticles loaded with a chemotherapeutic to target metastatic cells directly, thereby minimising collateral damage to healthy tissue and allowing more sustained and aggressive treatment. Ferrari has around 480 publications to his name, with over 20,000 citations. He also holds dozens of patents for inventions including different varieties of nanoparticles for drug delivery.</p>
<p>Originally from northern Italy, he studied mathematics at the University of Padua before moving to University of California, Berkeley, where he studied for a masters and a PhD in mechanical engineering. He went on to become an associate professor at Berkeley and moved into medicine when he became a professor of bioengineering and mechanical engineering at Ohio State University.</p>
<p>Ferrari later moved to the MD Anderson Center and the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston. In 2010 he became president and CEO of the Houston Methodist Research Institute.</p>

<h3 id="head-of-eus-top-science-panel-quits-over-covid-19-response">Head of EU&rsquo;s top science panel quits over COVID-19 response</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/08/09/26947156-0-image-a-38_1586335205799.jpg" alt="img">
The EU was gripped by a furious coronavirus row today after the head of its top science organisation walked out with a blast at its &lsquo;extremely disappointing&rsquo; response to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Professor Mauro Ferrari announced he had quit as president of the European Research Council (ERC), despite only being appointed to the key role January 1 this year.</p>
<p>In a formal statement announcing his decision to resign he had been &lsquo;extremely disappointed by the European response&rsquo; to the pandemic and that he had &lsquo;seen enough&rsquo; of the EU to prompt him to walk away.</p>
<p>But in an astonishing response, the ERC accused him of being &lsquo;economical with the truth&rsquo; and claimed he had been forced to resign over failures during his three months in office.</p>
<p>Professor Mauro Ferrari has resigned as the president of the European Research Council</p>
<p>News of the decision was first revealed by the Financial Times, based on a statement released to the paper by Prof Ferrari.</p>
<p>In that statement the EU&rsquo;s top scientist complained about running into institutional and political obstacles as he tried to quickly establish a scientific program to combat the virus across the continent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have seen enough of both the governance of science, and the political operations at the European Union,&rsquo; he wrote in the statement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have lost faith in the system itself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Prof Ferrari, who had been due to serve a four year term at the ERC, reportedly formally submitted his resignation to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Prof Ferrari said in his statement that he had been a &lsquo;fervent supporter&rsquo; of the EU when he had first taken the job, before the coronavirus crisis had &lsquo;completely changed my views&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He had argued for the ERC to create a new, more hands-on initiative to provide scientists and health care workers with more help and resources - but his proposals were apparently rejected.</p>
<p>Prof Ferrari bemoaned the &lsquo;complete absence of coordination of healthcare policies among member states&rsquo; and the opposition to what he described as a &lsquo;cohesive financial support&rsquo; package.</p>
<p>But confirming his departure this afternoon in a 700-word statement, the ERC said his resignation yesterday &lsquo;in fact followed a written unanimous vote of no confidence&rsquo; by its controlling scientific council.</p>
<p>They accused Prof Ferrari of having a &lsquo;a complete lack of appreciation for the raison-d’être of the ERC&rsquo;, as well as showing a &lsquo;lack of engagement&rsquo;, failing to attend meetings while spending time on &lsquo;multiple external enterprises, some academic and some commercial&rsquo;, including in the United States.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Scientific Council wishes to clarify, in case of any doubt, that they absolutely endorse the view that scientific research will provide the best solutions to tackling pandemics, such as COVID-19,&rsquo; it said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Therefore, we regret Professor Ferrari&rsquo;s statement, which at best is economical with the truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It added: &lsquo;Professor Ferrari has stated that the reason for his resignation is that the Scientific Council did not support his call for the ERC to fund a special initiative focused on the COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To address this point specifically, we did not support a special initiative because that is not our remit and the Commission&rsquo;s Research and Innovation Directorate General, with which we are connected, was already very active in developing new programmes to support this research through the appropriate channels.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As the coronavirus spread from China to Italy, Austria, Spain and other EU nations, the bloc was heavily criticised for not acting forcefully enough to set up a coordinated response.</p>
<p>Professor Ferrari handed in his resignation to European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen yesterday</p>
<p>Numerous European nations took unilateral decisions to try to slow the spread of the disease with health issues primarily the responsibility of each member state.</p>
<p>But some attacked Ms von der Leyen for failing to do more to bind the bloc into one set of arrangements.</p>
<p>Over the past month, EU nations have been trying to work closer together and EU leaders have now committed to better coordination to try to alleviate the human and economic suffering.
