Ed. note: Every weekday between now and when the PGA Tour resumes play, Michael Bamberger will offer a report in this space by 8 a.m. — usually, but not always, playing off the news. We like to give our guy room to roam, but not here: In Bamberger Briefly he’ll be contained to 500 words or less. He welcomes your suggestions and comments at [email protected]</p>
<hr>
<p>Match II is a real thing. That is, various parties are coming together — Phil Mickelson, Tiger Woods, their people, Turner — to try to make it happen, according to a source familiar with the plans. Should it materialize, when would this 18-hole match be played? Two weeks before any major league gets back to business.</p>
<p>Let’s say the NBA resumes its season on June 1, which is a wild guess. Then Match II would be played in mid-May.</p>
<p>It will have none of the baggage of Tiger v. Phil, in Las Vegas, Thanksgiving weekend, 2018. That was a gaudy winner-takes-all event with $9 million on the line. This event would not be a cash-grab for either pro. It would be a fundraiser for people who have suffered through the Covid-19 pandemic.

<h3 id="mike-tyson-talked-on-a-podcast-about-the-time-one-of-his-famous-pet-tigers-attacked-a-woman-trespassing-at-his-house-she-was-just-f------up">Mike Tyson talked on a podcast about the time one of his famous pet tigers attacked a woman trespassing at his house: &lsquo;She was just f&mdash;&ndash; up&rsquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.insider.com/5e82915d0c2a6238c107ba93?width=1200&amp;format=jpeg" alt="img">
Mike Tyson said recently that one of his pet tigers in the 1990s attacked a woman who had trespassed on his property.</p>
<p>The tiger &ldquo;f&mdash;&ndash; up&rdquo; the trespasser so badly he paid her approximately $250,000.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know what they could do to a person&rsquo;s flesh,&rdquo; Tyson said. &ldquo;I had no idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These days, Tyson has replaced the big cats with a poodle but he still looks back. &ldquo;I loved them … [but] I shouldn&rsquo;t have had them in my house. I was wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Visit Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>Mike Tyson once had three pet tigers and he said one of them attacked someone trespassing on his property.</p>
<p>Tyson told the story to the rapper Fat Joe on a &ldquo;Fat Joe Show&rdquo; video posted on Instagram Live.</p>
<p>Tyson said he raised them as cubs and even placed an order for the animals while he was serving time in prison, likely between 1992 and 1995.</p>
<p>He told Fat Joe that a friend of his who imported cars said he was considering trading vehicles for some animals. Tyson asked him what kind of animals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;Horses and stuff, and my dad raised tigers and lions, too. If you got one of those that would be cooler than a Ferrari.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said: &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you order me a couple, I&rsquo;ll be getting out in a couple of months.&rsquo; I was in prison. And so when I got out, came home, I had two cubs.&rdquo;

<h3 id="what-happened-after-tiger-king">What Happened After ‘Tiger King’</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/31/arts/television/31xp-tigerking/31xp-tigerking-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
Traveling the country in 1866, the showman P.T. Barnum sparred with the founder of the A.S.P.C.A. Having learned of a mauling at a Long Island zoo in 1933, one woman wrote to her newspaper, “it makes one wonder why these roadside ‘zoos’ are allowed.”</p>
<p>Watching Netflix in 2020, a lot of people are wondering the same thing.</p>
<p>That question and many others rose out of the documentary series “Tiger King,” about Joseph Maldonado-Passage, better known as Joe Exotic, the former owner of a roadside zoo in Oklahoma, now in federal prison for, among other things, trying to hire a hit man to kill an animal-rights activist.</p>
<p>Since the series’ release last month, Joe Exotic, 57, has won over a whole new set of allies against a host of his former associates and enemies, most prominently the activist Carole Baskin. Some are calling for his release from prison, where he is serving a 22-year sentence.</p>
<p>His story has also given new energy to animal-rights activists, who say the documentary chose to sensationalize feuds and missed an opportunity to expose cruelty at roadside zoos.
