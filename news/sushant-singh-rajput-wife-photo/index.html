<p><img src="https://img.manoramaonline.com/content/dam/mm/en/entertainment/entertainment-news/images/2020/6/15/sushant-soba-silk-smitha-suicide.jpg" alt="img">
The curse of suicide has haunted the showbiz since time immemorial with the likes of iconic actor-director Guru Dutt, South star Shoba, Silk Smitha, actor Jiah Khan and now Bollywood star Sushant Singh Rajput giving up on life in the Indian film industry known for being harsh and demanding of its stars.</p>
<p>Known for films like &ldquo;Kai Po Che!&quot;, &ldquo;MS Dhoni: The Untold Story&rdquo;, &ldquo;Chhichhore&rdquo;, Rajput was found hanging at his Bandra home, the police said on Sunday. He was 34.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: Shocking suicides: Actors who stunned us with their sudden exits</p>
<p>Rajput&rsquo;s last screen appearance was Nitesh Tiwari&rsquo;s 2019 film Chhichhore. And his last social media post, dedicated to his late mother who died in 2002 when he was a young teen, was on June 3, a foretelling perhaps on what to come.</p>
<p>Rajput&rsquo;s sudden death comes days after his former manager, 28-year-old Disha Salian, ended her life by jumping from a high rise building on June 9.</p>
<p>Guru Dutt, known for black-and-white classics like &ldquo;Kaagaz Ke Phool&rdquo;, &ldquo;Baazi&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Pyaasa&rdquo;, was found dead on October 10, 1964 in his bed in his rented apartment at Pedder Road in erstwhile Bombay. He was 39. The filmmaker, whose real name was Vasanth Kumar Shivashankar Padukone, was said to have been mixing alcohol and sleeping pills.</p>
<p>Dutt&rsquo;s death may have been suicide or just an accidental overdose. His son, Arun Dutt, considered the death to be an accident.</p>
<p>Guru Dutt</p>
<p>South star Mahalakshmi Menon, best known by her stagename Shoba committed suicide at the age of 17. She got herself a National Award for Best Actress for the film Pasi and on May 1, 1980, she was found to have killed herself in her house in Chennai, then Madras. The manner of Shoba’s death, however, still remains cloaked in mystery.</p>
<p>Four years after Shoba died, her mother Prema who was also an actress too killed herself. KG George&rsquo;s 1983 film Lekhayude Maranam – Oru Flashback is said to be loosely based on her life.</p>
<p>Actor Vijaylakshmi, who reached the iconic status of a sex symbol in Tamil cinema during her time, as Silk Smitha died at the age of 33 as the result of a suspected suicide in 1996. She appeared in over 200 films, including &ldquo;Vandichakkaram&rdquo;, &ldquo;Moondru Mugam&rdquo;, a most sought after actor at a time was said to be neck deep in controversies.</p>
<p>Silk Smitha</p>
<p>She was immortalised on screen in the 2011 film &ldquo;The Dirty Picture&rdquo;, starring Vidya Balan as Silk. The Milan Luthria-directed film, which showed the highs and lows of the dancing star, was inspired by the actor&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Former Miss India and video jockey Nafisa Joseph was found hanging at her residence in Versova in 2004 at the age of 25.</p>
<p>Joseph, who won the Miss India title in 1997, had worked as a model and had been involved in activities related to animal rights.</p>
<p>In 2006, model-turned television actor Kuljeet Randhawa, known for starring in high-school drama &ldquo;Hip Hip Hurray!&quot;, suspense serial &ldquo;Kohinoor&rdquo; and crime thriller drama &ldquo;Special Squad&rdquo;, allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself in her single room apartment in suburban Juhu. She was 25.</p>
<p>Kunal Singh, best known for starring opposite actor Sonali Bendre in the 1999 Tamil romance film &ldquo;Kadhalar Dhinam&rdquo;, was found hanging from the ceiling fan in his Mumbai apartment in 2008. He was 30.</p>
<p>Jiah Khan</p>
<p>British-American actor Jiah Khan, best known for films like &ldquo;Nishabd&rdquo; with megastar Amitabh Bachchan and &ldquo;Ghajini&rdquo; with Aamir Khan, was found hanging at her Mumbai residence on June 3, 2013 by her mother Rabiya Khan. Khan was 25.</p>
<p>It was deemed a suicide and reconfirmed as a suicide in 2016 following an extensive investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and a hearing at the Bombay High Court.</p>
<p>Khan&rsquo;s mother blamed her boyfriend, actor Sooraj Pancholi, for her death. He was charged with abetting Khan&rsquo;s suicide. The case has not yet been settled.</p>
<p>Last year, actor Kushal Punjabi, who appeared in films such as &ldquo;Kaal&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lakshya&rdquo; as well as the reality show &ldquo;Fear Factor&rdquo;, was found hanging in his Bandra apartment. He was 42.</p>
<p>Punjabi, whose body was found by his parents in the wee hours of December 27, left behind a suicide note in which he said nobody should be held responsible for his death.

The country was left in shock after the news of actor Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s suicide started doing rounds. The 34-year-old Bollywood actor was found hanging at his Bandra residence on June 14. When there was no response after repeated knocks, his domestic help called the neighbours after which police arrived shortly and broke into his room where he was found hanging around 12.30 pm. It came to light that he was suffering from depression and was even getting treatment from Hinduja hospital for the last six months. After the untimely death of the stay, various celebrities were left in shock and had only one question as to why he took the drastic step. One amongst those was actress Sushmita Sen who took to her social media to share a long post and spoke about how it is important to stay positive in life because a person is only responsible for his own happiness. She even spoke about how insecurities can grow in the life of a celebrity with name and sometimes, bank balance.</p>
<p>Sushmita shared a photo that read, &lsquo;protect your peace.&rsquo; Alongside she wrote the long post reading, &ldquo;Look good, show good&hellip;be good..ALL THE TIME!! Projection becomes one’s life, both on &amp; off screen. Insecurities grow with name &amp; sometimes, bank balance. All these may be known triggers in an actors life&hellip;but it’s actually true about a lot of us from all different walks of life&hellip;only differing in magnitude &amp; visibility!! Young people with so much life &amp; promise ahead of them, some with great depth &amp; will power&hellip;can choose to take their own life is deeply disturbing. How do we say, we know people &amp; still not see it coming? Have we become experts at hiding our pain or does no one have the time to really SEE it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further, she said, &ldquo;How lonely &amp; hopeless can prolonged silence make you? Do we alienate a life by judging it constantly? In the race of the projection of “look good, show good, be good” have we lost the most important ability to FEEL GOOD? Life has its share of pressures for EVERYONE&hellip;no one is excused that, no matter what your standing!! Life is a graph with its ups &amp; downs for EVERYONE, even if we can’t always see it. Yet, FIGHT FOR LIFE WE MUST&hellip;it’s the only vehicle that will help lead us from bad times to GOOD ONES again!!! “WHEN YOU’RE TIRED&hellip; LEARN TO REST, NOT QUIT.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She also wrote about how building a life takes a lot of faith and courage while taking one&rsquo;s life just needs a moment of madness. She said, &ldquo;We can’t change the world, but we can choose self preservation over the noise, chaos, demands, insensitive scrutinisation &amp; conditioned insecurities&hellip;.by befriending ourselves, being around people who really LISTEN, having faith in God’s unique plan JUST FOR YOU!!! Be unafraid to ask for help &amp; know that you are NOT ALONE. Building a life demands a lot of faith, courage, resilience &amp; hard work&hellip;whereas taking your life just needs a MOMENT of madness&hellip;choose to distract yourself from THAT moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the professional front, Sushmita will be making her &lsquo;incredible&rsquo; comeback through her upcoming web series &lsquo;Aarya&rsquo; in which she will be seen playing the role of a mother who is willing to go to any length to protect her children. The show also features Namit Das, Sikandar Kher, Jayant Kripalani, Sohaila Kapoor, Sugandha Garg, Maya Sareen, Vishwajeet Pradhan and Manish Chaudhary. It is directed by Ram Madhwani, is scheduled to hit Disney+ Hotstar VIP on the 19th of June 2020.</p>

Ekta Kapoor&rsquo;s television show, Pavitra Rishta (2009) about a middle class Maharashtrian family, won hearts. Pavitra Rishta came as a respite for Ekta, too, as she was experiencing a lull period prior to this show. The simple love story of Manav played by Sushant Singh Rajput and Archana aka Ankita Lokhande enticed everyone. The show created wonders for all the star cast and it often ruled the TRP charts. As Pavitra Rishta completes 11 years, let&rsquo;s take a look at the lead cast, Manav and Archana&rsquo;s romantic pictures: (Photo: Instagram)
