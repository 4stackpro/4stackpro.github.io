The USA reached a grim milestone in its fight against the coronavirus Monday: More than 10,000 people have died of COVID-19 in the nation.</p>
<p>There were 10,335 deaths as of Monday afternoon, according to the Johns Hopkins dashboard, which tracks the numbers.</p>
<p>That total surpasses the number of battle deaths from six U.S. wars combined, according to data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p>VA data says a total of 9,961 soldiers died on the battlefield during these six wars: The American Revolution, War of 1812, Mexican War, Indian Wars, Spanish-American Warand Desert Shield/Desert Storm. The data does not include other deaths related to the wars.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have repeatedly likened the coronavirus outbreak to a military struggle, and members of the armed forces have joined in various efforts to help stop the virus&rsquo; spread.</p>
<p>The USNS Comfort naval hospital ship was sent to Manhattan to help increase the city&rsquo;s medical capacity. Members of the National Guard and medical military personnel have been deployed to help hard-hit areas.</p>
<p>Face masks:CDC recommends voluntary use of face masks for public to stem spread of coronavirus</p>
<p>Over the weekend, officials warned the coming days would be a major crossroads in efforts to contain the virus.</p>
<p>Surgeon General Jerome Adams said Sunday that this week could be the nation&rsquo;s &ldquo;hardest and saddest&rdquo; thus far. “This is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9/11 moment, only it’s not going to be localized,&rdquo; Adams said.</p>
<p>Virus hot spots are predicted to see peak deaths this week. Communities that have not seen a major spike in deaths are in a critical window for preventing a major outbreak in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the moment to do everything you can. &hellip; This is the moment to not be going to the grocery store, not going to the pharmacy, but doing everything you can to keep your family and your friends safe,&rdquo; Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said Saturday.</p>
<p>The USA is seeing in excess of 1,000 fatalities per day, a daily toll more than double that of two of America&rsquo;s most deadly illnesses – lung cancer and the flu.</p>
<p>There is some good news: Federal health officials said there were signs the outbreak might be reaching its apex in some hard-hit areas such as New York City and Washington state.</p>
<p>Social distancing measures are effective in blunting the spread of the virus, Birx said. Coronavirus patients often have a weekslong battle with the virus, which means death tolls often reflect infections that occurred weeks ago.</p>

<h3 id="coronavirus-live-updates-british-pm-boris-johnson-in-icu-us-deaths-surpass-10k-as-ny-offers-glimmer-of-hope-hydroxychloroquine-questions">Coronavirus live updates: British PM Boris Johnson in ICU; US deaths surpass 10K as NY offers glimmer of hope; hydroxychloroquine questions</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/06/USAT/2c12924e-8511-4fb0-853a-b07f1ba562e3-USP_News__Coronavirus.JPG?crop=2999,1687,x0,y138&amp;width=2999&amp;height=1687&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" alt="img">
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was transferred to the intensive care unit of a London hospital, White House officials clashed over the value of an antimalarial drug for COVID-19 patients while the coronavirus hot spot of New York offered a glimmer of hope Monday as the U.S. death toll from the coronavirus pandemic surpassed 10,000.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump has warned of reaching a &ldquo;horrific point in terms of death&rdquo; at the hands of the coronavirus pandemic in coming days. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said Americans were facing &ldquo;our hardest and saddest week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Trump and federal health officials also said there were signs the outbreak might be reaching its apex in some hard-hit areas such as New York City and Washington state. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said deaths and hospitalizations showed signs of &ldquo;plateauing.&rdquo; Washington Gov. Jay Inslee announced his state would return 400 ventilators to the federal government after state health officials there said they were seeing fewer infections than anticipated.</p>
<p>There are more than 352,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the U.S., and more than 10,000 people have died, according to the Johns Hopkins University data dashboard. More than 1.3 million cases have been confirmed worldwide.</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Johnson moved to intensive care</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was hospitalized Sunday as he continued to experience COVID-19 symptoms 10 days after testing positive, was moved to the intensive care unit Monday when the symptoms worsened.</p>
<p>Johnson&rsquo;s office said early Monday he was awaiting results of &ldquo;routine&rdquo; tests for the symptoms, which included a fever. 10 Downing Street described the hospitalization as a &ldquo;precautionary step,&rdquo; and Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick told the BBC that Johnson, 55, is &ldquo;still very much in charge of the government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are no details so far about which of Johnson&rsquo;s symptoms got worse.</p>
<p>A post on Johnson&rsquo;s twitter feed Monday read: &ldquo;Last night, on the advice of my doctor, I went into hospital for some routine tests as I’m still experiencing coronavirus symptoms. I’m in good spirits and keeping in touch with my team, as we work together to fight this virus and keep everyone safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fauci, Navarro at odds over value of hydroxychloroquine</p>
<p>Controversy intensified Monday over the value of hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug frequently touted by President Donald Trump as a crucial tool in the battle to save the lives of COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>Peter Navarro, director of the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, vigorously defended the drug in a CNN interview, one day after Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, had suggested the data on the drug was &ldquo;at best suggestive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have two words for you,&rdquo; Navarro said when told of Fauci&rsquo;s reticence. &ldquo;Second opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Glatter, emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, says more testing and analysis are needed: &ldquo;The reality is that we will likely need multi-drug regimens, similar to the way we have approached HIV or cancer. One drug will likely not be enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>US stocks race higher</p>
<p>U.S. stocks had their biggest rally in nearly two weeks Monday on signs of a slowdown in coronavirus deaths and new cases in some of the hardest-hit areas throughout the world.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 1,627.46 points to close at 22,679.99. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 rose 7% to end at 2,663.68, its best percentage gain since March 24 after recording a third week of losses in the past four on Friday. All 11 sectors in the broad index were higher, led by gains in the technology, utility and materials sectors.</p>
<p>Global markets stabilized overnight as the number of people dying appears to be slowing in New York City, Spain and Italy, news that was cautiously welcomed by leaders. But they noted that any gains could easily be reversed if people didn’t continue to adhere to strict lockdowns.</p>

<p>Cuomo: Deaths, hospitalizations may be leveling off in New York</p>
<p>The number of daily COVID-19 hospitalizations in New York state declined again and deaths may be leveling off, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday. Cuomo also said he would ask President Donald Trump for permission to use the 1,000-bed USNS Comfort for COVID-19 patients since there is little demand for beds for other illnesses. The Comfort anchored in New York&rsquo;s harbor with a mission to treat non-virus patients so hospitals could concentrate on COVID patients.</p>
<p>Cuomo also said demand for hospital beds and ventilators may not reach numbers previously projected if residents continue to follow social distancing and other guidelines. But he also announced an increase in the fine, to $1,000 from $500, for failing to follow the rules.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a real danger in getting overconfident,&rdquo; Cuomo said at his daily news conference. &ldquo;This is an enemy that we have underestimated from day one and we have paid the price dearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>New York City could temporarily bury victims in parks</p>
<p>New York City is looking into temporarily burying the dead on public lands because of the mounting death toll from the pandemic. Mark D. Levine, chairman of the health committee for New York City Council, said coroner freezers were filling fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon we&rsquo;ll start &lsquo;temporary interment&rsquo;. This likely will be done by using a NYC park for burials (yes you read that right),&rdquo; Mark D. Levine tweeted. &ldquo;Trenches will be dug for 10 caskets in a line. It will be done in a dignified – orderly and temporary – manner. But it will be tough for NYers to take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the city Office of Chief Medical Examiner told the USA TODAY Network that burials are being conducted at Hart Island, an area that has a history of being used for burials of the indigent and unclaimed dead. Aja Worthy-Davis said planning was underway &ldquo;for all possibilities, however no decision has been made, and there is still adequate capacity at this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Navy secretary blasts ousted commander of USS Roosevelt</p>
<p>The Acting Secretary of the Navy, Thomas Modly, told the crew of the USS Theodore Roosevelt their ousted commander, Capt. Brett Crozier, was either &ldquo;too naive or too stupid&rdquo; to be in command. Modly said Crozier may have intentionally leaked to the media a memo in which he warned about the coronavirus spreading aboard the aircraft carrier and urged action to save his sailors, according to a transcript of the remarks obtained by CNN.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a betrayal,&rsquo;&rsquo; Modly said. &ldquo;And I can tell you one other thing: Because he did that, he put it in the public&rsquo;s forum and it is now a big controversy in Washington, D.C.&rdquo; The ship is anchored in Guam and most of it&rsquo;s 2,700 sailors have been removed.</p>
<p>Bronx Zoo tiger has COVID-19</p>
<p>A tiger at the Bronx Zoo tested positive for COVID-19 after multiple animals developed virus symptoms, federal officials confirmed. Nadia, a 4-year-old Malayan tiger, was tested after her sister Azul, two Amur tigers and three African lions developed a dry cough. The animals are all expected to recover.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed the tests Sunday and is working with the Centers for Disease and Control Prevention (CDC) along with state animal and public health leaders to determine whether animals, at the zoo or in other areas, should be tested for the cornavirus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the first case of its kind,&rsquo;&rsquo; the USDA said in a statement. Public health officials believe the animals became sick after being exposed to an infected employee &ldquo;who was actively shedding virus.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Trump: US will likely reach &lsquo;horrific point in terms of death&rsquo;</p>
<p>While President Donald Trump expressed hope on Sunday that the U.S. was &ldquo;starting to see light at the end of the tunnel,&rdquo; he also acknowledged that the next two weeks will be &ldquo;very difficult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all have to reach a certain point and that point is going to be a horrific point in terms of death,&rdquo; Trump said. Surgeon General Jerome Adams says this week could be the nation&rsquo;s &ldquo;hardest and saddest&rdquo; thus far.</p>
<p>“This is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9/11 moment, only it’s not going to be localized,&rdquo; Adams said on Fox News Sunday.</p>

<p>Washington state returns 400 ventilators to feds</p>
<p>The state of Washington will return more than 400 ventilators received from the Strategic National Stockpile for use by states facing higher numbers of COVID-19 cases, Gov. Jay Inslee said. Still, the state was preparing for increased hospitalizations and recently purchased more than 750 ventilators expected to arrive over the next several weeks, Inslee said.</p>
<p>Vice Admiral Raquel Bono, director of the state COVID-19 Health System Response Management, said mitigation efforts resulted in &ldquo;fewer infections in our communities than anticipated.” The University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation forecast indicates the state hit peak hospital resource demand Thursday. Daily deaths were forecast to peak Monday at 19 before slowly declining.</p>
<p>Washington state was the first U.S. epicenter for the virus when it swept through a nursing home in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland, ultimately killing more than 30 people there.</p>
<p>New Yorkers could start getting stimulus payments Thursday</p>
<p>New York City residents could start seeing federal stimulus payments of up to $1,200 as soon as Thursday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday. The mayor also said the city has set up 450 &ldquo;grab and go&rdquo; locations for families to obtain breakfast, lunch and dinner as they struggle under a restrictive stay-at-home order that has forced many residents out of work. The city also has banned evictions to help people struggling to make rent, de Blasio said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of (the payments) will be soon,&rdquo; de Blasio said. &ldquo;But others are going to take a long time. &hellip; If it takes too long, it doesn&rsquo;t help enough.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="us-grocery-store-workers-need-to-be-fairly-compensated-protests-at-amazon-whole-foods-begin">&lsquo;Us grocery store workers need to be fairly compensated.&rsquo; Protests at Amazon, Whole Foods begin.</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6d052756800fcdd135402857d1d3e0d2c75ad84c/c=0-94-1800-1106/local/-/media/2020/03/30/USATODAY/usatsports/whole-foods-market-in-addison-texas.jpg?width=1800&amp;height=1012&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" alt="img">
Some employees at Whole Foods Market nationwide executed a work stoppage Tuesday, while a former employee at parent company Amazon considered legal action after his dismissal for participation in a labor walkout Monday.</p>
<p>Expect escalating tensions between employers and workers as workplaces deemed essential during the coronavirus crisis weigh issues of safety with pressures to meet the demands of a sheltering-in-place populace.</p>
<p>Amazon, which acquired the supermarket chain in June 2017 for $13.7 billion, is seeking to hire thousands of workers for both businesses. But workers for the supermarket chain want improved workplace safety and benefits including hazard pay and sick pay for employees who may be sick but haven&rsquo;t been tested for the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Whole Foods workers had originally scheduled May 1, International Workers&rsquo; Day, as the date to stage a sickout, in which they call in to say the won&rsquo;t come to work that day. But concerns about contracting and spreading the COVID-19 virus between co-workers and customers led them to move up the daylong strike.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Many cities and states have effectively shut down, making us literal emergency workers,&rdquo; the group said in a statement. &ldquo;The level of risk combined with the inflated profits from the past few weeks mean that us grocery store workers need to be fairly compensated, as well as given an option to self-quarantine without fear of being evicted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The protest by some Whole Foods employees who &ldquo;called out&rdquo; to not report to work Tuesday had &ldquo;no operational impact&rdquo; and service continued at &ldquo;all of our stores without interruption,&rdquo; the company said in a statement to USA TODAY.</p>
<p>Whole Foods workers who planned to participate in the work stoppage talked to USA TODAY but asked that their names not be used because they feared the would be fired.</p>
<p>The workers at Amazon, Whole Foods and Instacart – shoppers and deliverers for the online grocery service had their own strike on Monday – describe a work environment that can echo those in hospitals and health care facilities: not enough preventive equipment and sloppy safety precautions, a combination that could contribute to the virus&rsquo; spread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are having nurses and physicians and others working in an environment where don’t feel like they have the necessary equipment to take care of patients the way they have been trained to take care of them and to also protect themselves,&rdquo; said Sally Watkins, executive director of the Washington State Nurses Association. &ldquo;That is what is rising to the surface. We don’t have what we need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The association filed a complaint with the state labor department over unsafe work conditions at a hospital in Bellingham, Washington, and had criticized the firing of emergency room physician Dr. Ming Lin who was fired after he voiced similar concerns on Facebook and in The Seattle Times.</p>
<p>Similarly, New York Attorney General Letitia James is calling for a National Labor Relations Board investigation into the firing of worker Christian Smalls, who had organized Monday&rsquo;s protest at an Amazon fulfillment center on Staten Island, New York.</p>
<p>“It is disgraceful that Amazon would terminate an employee who bravely stood up to protect himself and his colleagues. At the height of a global pandemic, Chris Smalls and his colleagues publicly protested the lack of precautions that Amazon was taking to protect them from COVID-19,&rdquo; she said in a statement. &ldquo;The Office of the Attorney General is considering all legal options.”</p>
<p>Smalls was fired for violating &ldquo;multiple safety issues,&rdquo; the company said in a statement to USA TODAY. The company said it instructed Smalls to stay home with pay for 14 days due to being in close contact with an infected employee, but Smalls went to the warehouse Monday.</p>
<p>Workers had demanded the building be sanitized after several workers tested positive for the virus, Smalls told USA TODAY.</p>
<p>On his Twitter feed, Smalls said after he was sent home Saturday, other employees who were in direct contact with an employee who tested positive were not.</p>
<p>Smalls is reportedly considering legal action against Amazon, he told USA TODAY.</p>
<p>New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Tuesday that he has directed the city&rsquo;s human rights commission to investigate the incident. &ldquo;The commission has opened an investigation to determine whether Amazon has violated the New York City human rights law,&rdquo; said commission spokesperson Alicia McCauley.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Whole Foods workers say they want improved sanitation and physical distancing between workers and between workers and customers at stores. They are also seeking double-time wages for hazard pay and three weeks of sick pay for workers who isolate or self-quarantine instead of coming to work.</p>
<p>The supermarket chain has had several employees test positive for COVID-19 in its stores across the U.S. and Canada, according to various news reports. Whole Foods has 500 stores in North America.</p>
<p>The company recently increased hourly pay for full-time and part-time workers by $2 through April. They also get double pay for any overtime hours worked through May 3. All employees diagnosed with COVID-19 or quarantined get up to an additional two weeks of paid time off.</p>
<p>But those measures fall short, say the workers organizing Tuesday&rsquo;s protest. &ldquo;It is important to note that these demands are only a starting point for these companies to do what is right. These are only our IMMEDIATE demands related to the Covid-19 outbreak,&rdquo; the workers&rsquo; statement said.</p>
<p>Those who participated in Tuesday&rsquo;s protest were &ldquo;a small but vocal group&rdquo; of employees, Whole Foods said. The company has taken &ldquo;extensive measures&rdquo; to protect its workers and increased pay and new safety protocols include daily temperature screenings of employees, it says.</p>
<p>Worker opposition has been growing, says Mary-Hunter McDonnell, assistant professor of management at The Wharton School, The University of Pennsylvania, with an example being the walkout by Wayfair employees in Boston in June 2019 after the online goods company sold furniture to an organization that is managing migrant camps along the U.S-Mexico border.</p>
<p>Employees in essential industries see they have some leverage and that they are putting themselves at additional risk currently. That additional leverage provided during this ongoing crisis potentially gives workers &ldquo;the power to break what is a critical confidence in their employers right now,&rdquo; she said. &quot;</p>
<p>Joshua Murray, a Vanderbilt University assistant sociology professor who specializes in strikes and walkouts, agrees. &ldquo;Amazon and grocery stores are now the center of economic activity and are the key supply line for a quarantined nation,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Any stoppage reverberates down the line and is incredibly visible to consumers and observers. … these workers are seen as risking their health for the rest of us, so the public is likely to be on their side. All of this combines so that less workers need to stop working for a shorter amount of time in order to get major concessions from their employers because the employer can’t afford to be shut down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite worker concerns about conditions, public officials may be reluctant to disrupt the current supply and delivery chains becausetheir continued operation is critical for this to work,&rdquo; McDonnell said.</p>
<p>Amazon&rsquo;s case to fire Smalls will be watched closely. Employers typically have the right to fire workers for many reasons as long as they are not being discriminatory, but those workers who can be classified as whistleblowers do have protection, McDonnell said. Whether that applies to Smalls&rsquo; case remains to be seen, she said.</p>
<p>Support and interest in the Tuesday work stoppage was significant on Twitter, with many attempting to put the protest in context. One apparent Whole Foods worker tweeted being torn between showing solidarity and knowing &ldquo;none of my immigrant brothers and sisters are&rdquo; participating over fear and &ldquo;will be stuck with all the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another compared grocery store workers to health care providers who &ldquo;are not getting any hazard pay and have a higher risk of getting #Covid19.&rdquo;</p>
