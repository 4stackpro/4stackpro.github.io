<p>Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput became a household name with his hit show Pavitra Rishta where he played the role of Manav Deshmukh.The actor was loved for his good looks and people loved the onscreen chemistry between the lead pair. Ankita Lokhande played the role of his love interest and wife Archana in the show. Their onscreen love turned into their real-life love story.The two met on the sets of the show and started dating each other. There were reports that Ankita and Sushant were to get married after having postponed their wedding many times prior to that.Ankita and Sushant dated each other for six years before calling it quits in 2016.The two never came out in public about their split. Sushant was reported to be dating actress Rhea Chakraborty while Ankita is in a relationship with businessman Vicky Jain for quite sometime now. Reports are that the actress is engaged to get married.In an exclusive interview to ETimes, celebrity stylist Leepakshi Ellawadi remembered Sushant and said, “When we were talking he told me how indebted he was to his ex-girlfriend Ankita Lokhande. According to him, she supported him very much when they were on television and during their struggling days. He became a big star. This is a real quality in somebody to look back and even if you are not with that person, appreciate them for what they have done for you. Even though their relationship went sour, he had only good things to say about her.&ldquo;Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead on June 14 at his Bandra residence. The actor was suffering from depression for the past six months.

The news of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s suicide has left everyone in a state of shock. His friends and colleagues are unable to believe the news and are shattered. Parag Tyagi , who worked with Sushant Singh Rajput in Pavitra Rishta, his first show as a hero is unable to come to terms with the fact that he is no more. In an exclusive interview with ETimes TV, Parag stated that the entire Pavitra Rishta cast is devastated including Ankita Lokhande , Swati Anand and Usha Nadkarni.&ldquo;Aai (Usha Nadkarni) can&rsquo;t stop crying. Manju Shah (Swati Anand), everyone is shattered after hearing the news. All Pavitra Rishta actors were discussing and everyone is asking why? I spoke to Ankita (Lokhande). She is also devastated and everyone is speechless as to how this happened. She was devastated and is unable to believe the news. Everything was good, Chichore was a hit, his new film was coming Bechara, which looked good, why Sushant why. I was watching the teasers of Bechara yesterday. He was so good,&rdquo; said Parag.The Shakti actor remembers Sushant as a very dedicated and passionate actor, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very hard to believe. He was such a beautiful soul. He was a happy guy, how can he do such a thing. We met each other on and off at parties. He seemed fine. Whenever we met he looked so high on energy. I always felt so nice after meeting him. We would recall all the old memories from the Pavitra Rishta sets. He was a wonderful soul and a happy-go-lucky person. He was a very hardworking and passionate guy. I would say I have learnt so much from him. When we were working on Pavitra Rishta, he would not go home for 15-20 days. He used to sleep on the sets. I would also be there sometime and we would wake up and have breakfast together. Being a lead actor he would shoot more than all of us but he never complained. He would sleep for 2-3 hours on the sets during the break. He would tell everyone, this is my time yaar, I can&rsquo;t take off. He was focused, passionate and hardworking towards his work. He was very particular about his work.,&rdquo; shared he.Parag says that Sushant always motivated everyone to never give up in life and now seeing him commit suicide is tough to believe, &ldquo;The cops are still doing the investigation. They have doubts and even I can&rsquo;t believe that he can commit suicide. He was a very strong person. He was emotional of course, but he was very strong. It is hard to believe that he can commit suicide after coming such a long way. He had reached so far because of his hard work and dedication.He never gave up in his life, that&rsquo;s why it is very shocking to believe how can he commit suicide. He was a very warm and positive person. He would motivate everyone. At times during Pavitra Rishta when people would tell him you are working too hard go easy on yourself, he would tell them this is my time to work hard. Aaram karne ke liye puri zindagi padi hai&hellip;This is my chance, I won&rsquo;t give. People would tell him to relax the show is a hit, but he would not stop. He would work so hard on all his characters that&rsquo;s the reason he could see this stardom. Starting from a parallel lead and to reach Bollywood and do solo hero films not everyone can do but he did. He reached this level, it is commendable,&rdquo; he said.Parag, who loves fitness, recalls the time when he had called Sushant after seeing his body in Kai Po Che, &ldquo;He was such an inspiration to all. When he made a body in Kai Po Che, I called and congratulated him because I am into fitness and all, I was so proud of him. I told him that you have motivated me again yaar bhai body bahut acchi banayi hai aur tune toh inspire kar diya. He was doing great in his career, everything was going great for him. Then why?,&rdquo; asks Parag.The Aghori actor is very emotional as he had lost his father a few days ago and now losing Sushant is like another blow to him, &ldquo;It is a very tough time for me. My father just passed away. I had to see his body and now this news, it is unbelievable. I am unable to come to terms with this news. I will definitely be going for his cremation. I will have to go.Sushant had shared a post about his late mother a few days ago, who he was missing a lot. Parag said, &ldquo;He was very close to his mother from the beginning. He would always say kash yaar meri mom meri success dekh paati. She always stayed in his heart, he loved and missed her a lot. I don&rsquo;t know what to say and it is tough to believe. He was such a doting son. I remember doing Pavitra Rishta, he father had undergone a surgery, he made sure he gets the best facilities. He would shuffle between shoots and hospitals to take care of him. He was such a nice person. I don&rsquo;t understand what his father must be going through, when I am feeling this terrible. Losing a young son, I don&rsquo;t know how he must be dealing with this loss&quot;Recalling the time Parag spent with Sushant on the sets, he said, &ldquo;During Pavitra Rishta also he would discuss scenes and improvise with me bhai aisa kar dete hain&hellip; small scenes. He would discuss and praise me if I would do a very nice scene. Abhi sab yaad aaraha hai&hellip; we would play video games on sets during break (he cries). He was a tough and strong guy. God bless his soul.

Newton and Masaan producer Manish Mundra in his recent tweet asked his fans to talk about their favourite Hindi film that left them “speechless”. The producer was soon showered with several replies in return. Manish Mundra also mentioned that he is asking his fans about these films because he is working on a survey.</p>
<p>Producer Manish Mundra asks fans to help him in a survey</p>
<p>Bollywood has witnessed several amazing stories come to life on screen. These movies have not only been loved by the audience but also understand a different side of our country. But still, there has been a constant debate on social media that Hindi films have lost their charm and impact. Producer and director Manish Mundra reportedly also found himself lost in this debate.</p>

<p>This debate led Mundra to conduct a survey online to look for an answer. Recently, the Masaan producer took to Twitter and conducted this survey. He added that this “masterpiece” should have been released in the last three or four years.</p>
<p>Single out one Hindi film that has left you stunned n speechless. Stayed with you for long. Which you can call “masterpiece” in last 3 / 4 years.</p>

<p>This survey just to prove myself wrong that quality Hindi Films r facing extinction. — Manish Mundra (@ManMundra) June 8, 2020</p>
<p>While concluding his tweet Manish Mundra wrote, “This survey is just to prove myself wrong that quality Hindi films are facing extinction”. The moment Mundra tweeted about this survey, thousands of people started commenting about their “masterpieces”. Among all of these films, Sriram Raghavan directed Andhadhun turned out to be a winner.</p>

<p>Many people were quick to mention Andhadhun in this tweet. The film Andhadhun was released in 2018 and starred Ayushmann Khurrana and Tabu in pivotal roles. The black comedy film not only garnered critical acclaim but was also loved by the audience. Another Ayushmann Khurrana film that was a runner up in this survey was Article 15. This Anubhav Sinha directed film was no less than an eye-opener when it comes to the caste system and caste-based discrimination happening in India. Take a look at some of the responses Mundra received during this Twitter survey.</p>

<h3 id="chhichhore-review-35">&ldquo;Chhichhore Review {3.5&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-70975852/70975852.jpg?79541" alt="img">
Story: Raghav, son of high achieving parents succumbs to the pressure that comes with cut-throat entrance exams. As he battles for life in a hospital, his parents regroup with their friends after decades. Together, this older generation, goes on a nostalgia trip reminiscing their college days, hoping their bittersweet memories will help save a teenager, who has lost all will to live.</p>
<p>Review: Stress and overwhelming anxiety is a reality for many young students in India. More so, for those who appear for highly competitive engineering and medical entrance exams. And sometimes, ones who do not make it through the criteria find themselves in a whirlpool of doubt and depression. Unable to take the failure in the face of family and peer pressure, they often resort to actions which can cause irreparable damage to themselves and their families.</p>
<p>While this bleak reality is at the center of Chhichhore’s narrative, its heart and soul is purely reserved for the carefree college and hostel days that shape lifelong bonds and life lessons.</p>
<p>Annirudh (Sushant Singh Rajput) lovingly called Anni by his college buddies and Maya (Shraddha Kapoor), a divorced couple, find themselves in a desperate situation when their teenaged son, Raghav attempts suicide. The doctors indicate that he is critical, not just physically but mentally too. Annirudh believes the only way to bring him out of this darkness is to take Raghav down his own memory lane (back to his hostel days from engineering college). A place where he not just fell in love with Maya but also, forged friendships with ‘Sexa’ (Varun Sharma), ‘Acid’ (Naveen Polishetty), Derek (Tahir Raj Bhasin), ‘Bevda’ (Saharsh Kumar Shukla) and ‘Mummy’ (Tushar Pandey).</p>
<p>As the film’s narrative walks us down the hostel corridors, director Nitesh Tiwari creates an authentic world that is evidently filled with nuggets of nostalgia and a breezy, vibrant energy. There are some genuinely very funny moments that click but also be prepared for a generous helping of low-brow, frat boy jokes, all of which may not be palatable. However, there is no doubt that in its flashback mode – packed with romance, comedy, a sporting championship and some hard realities of hostel life – ‘Chhichhore’ soars. And when it zips back to the present day, where the group has an unlikely reunion, its heartwarming to witness that their friendship has survived the test of time and distance.</p>
<p>The arc of the screenplay though is mostly predictable and has a &lsquo;Three Idiots&rsquo; hangover. And with a lengthy runtime of almost two and half hours, the pace lags in the second half. It’s the emotional drama, fun quotient and a surprise element in the climax that keeps one invested. Shraddha Kapoor, packs in a solid performance both as the younger and older Maya. Sushant Singh Rajput shines as the young Anni (watch out for the scene where he goes tongue-tied in front of Maya!), however as the older Annirudh he seems a little uncomfortable. In fact, as the young lot – the performances are consistent - Varun Sharma steals the show in many of the scenes with his comic timing. Tahir Raj Bhasin is impressive as the intense Derek. Naveen Polishetty, Prateik Babbar, Tushar Pandey and Saharsh Singh also enhance the film with their likeable performances. Together, as a group of friends, they have an easy camaraderie that’s relatable.</p>
<p>‘Chhichhore’ has a relevant message on the inherent attitude towards academic success and failure that will connect with many youngsters and parents of today. It tells you that the journey is far more important than the destination and that losing is as critical a life lesson as winning. The film scores high on many accounts and is certainly worth watching.</p>
