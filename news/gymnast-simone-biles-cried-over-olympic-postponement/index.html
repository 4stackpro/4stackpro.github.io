(CNN) Superstar gymnast Simone Biles says she was in the gym training when she heard the 2020 Tokyo Olympics had been postponed because of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>With rules still allowing for gatherings of up to 10 people, the leads for Team USA were preparing as if the event would still go on. But during a break, Biles checked her cell phone and got a text informing her of the news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really didn&rsquo;t know what to feel. I just kind of sat there and I cried but ultimately it was the right decision&hellip;we need to make sure everyone in the US and around the world is healthy and safe,&rdquo; Biles, the winner of four Olympic gold medals in Rio 2016, told NBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Today Show&rdquo; Wednesday.</p>
<p>Biles, along with other athletes, is doing her part to help people impacted by the pandemic. The 23-year-old partnered with Athletes for Covid-19 Relief, an organization helping to support the Center for Disaster Philanthropy&rsquo;s Covid-19 Response Fund.</p>
<p>Donations over $25 are entered into a contest, with participants getting the chance to win a Biles-signed leotard, among other apparel donated by pro athletes. As of publication, the leotard donated by the Texas native had raised $1,601 for the cause.</p>

<h3 id="simone-biles-wont-commit-to-tokyo-olympics-in-2021-were-just-playing-it-by-ear">Simone Biles won&rsquo;t commit to Tokyo Olympics in 2021: &lsquo;We&rsquo;re just playing it by ear&rsquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ogO5vE1_iZ.N8iSeOpnebw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7BnmyoR3HvrAx3UEQz2nJQ--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-04/916343d0-7432-11ea-9bea-46406727bdf5" alt="img">
One of the world’s most prominent athletes isn’t ready to commit to Tokyo’s rescheduled Olympics.</p>
<p>Simone Biles spoke with the Associated Press on Wednesday about the disappointment of this summer’s Games being postponed. She declined to commit to competing next summer.</p>
<p>“Well, nothing is really set in stone yet,” Biles said. “We’re trying to figure out the right training regiment just so mentally and physically we can try and stay on top of our game. We’re just playing it by ear and really just listening to my body.”</p>
<p>That’s far from a no. It’s also most assuredly not a commitment.</p>
<p>Biles told “Today” earlier Wednesday that she cried when the Games were postponed, but acknowledged it was the right decision amid the COVID-19 pandemic. She made no mention of having doubts about 2021.</p>
<p>Impact of the delay on athletes</p>
<p>For athletes who have dedicated their lives to Olympic competition, seeing the Summer Games pushed back by a year can be emotional. And even though organizers insist that the Games will go on starting July 23, 2021, nobody knows what the state of the COVID-19 pandemic will be next summer.</p>
<p>It’s an uncertainty that can be taxing for athletes, especially after seeing their 2020 preparation go for naught.</p>
<p>“I was just mentally battling my mind, and I was so ready and not mentally checked out, but I was ready after three months to be done,” Biles continued. “That’s a lot to take mentally.”</p>

<p>Biles’ importance to Summer Games</p>
<p>Biles, 23, is the star of a U.S. Olympic gymnastics contingent that was expected to compete for gold in Tokyo. Biles won five gold medals in Rio in 2016, including team competition and individual all-around. She’s considered by many to be the greatest gymnast in the history of the sport.</p>
<p>Her updates from the gym on Twitter ramped up anticipation for what she had in store for Tokyo.</p>
<p>Story continues</p>
<p>just droppin this here real quick :-) pic.twitter.com/sIx0M112qJ — Simone Biles (@Simone_Biles) February 21, 2020</p>
<p>Losing Biles would be a significant blow not only to Team USA, but to the Olympics as a whole.</p>
<p>Biles’ training during pandemic</p>
<p>She’s working out at home, but told AP she’s not breaking coronavirus protocols to sneak into her closed gym in Houston.</p>
<p>“I know some people who are like, ‘I’m going to sneak in the gym and take the fine,’ this or that,” Biles said. “It’s your health and your safety, you have to be careful around other people.”</p>
<p>Biles has a lot of time to figure if and how she will prepare for 2021 Olympics. But for now, she’s still processing the news of 2020 not happening.</p>

<p>Some high schools have a swimming tradition. Others produce great ice hockey or water polo players. The Punahou School in Honolulu, private and K-12, is best known for a student who also played basketball — its most famous graduate, Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Also this: Dating to Obama’s tenure in 1976, at least one Punahou student went on to make the last 11 U.S. Summer Olympic teams.</p>
<p>And with the addition of skateboarding and surfing to the Olympic program, there are former Punahou students among the best in the country in four different Olympic sports, plus another Paralympic sport.</p>
<p>“One of my favorite things about going to Punahou was that I felt like I was surrounded by a lot of excellence,” said Carissa Moore, the reigning world champion in surfing and a Punahou grad. “A lot of my friends are some of the smartest girls, women. … The whole school, everyone is doing something.”</p>
<p>Moore, 27, qualified for the U.S. Olympic team with her fourth world title last year. Heimana Reynolds is the reigning world champ in park skateboarding.</p>
<p>Brothers Taylor and Trevor Crabb are on different beach volleyball teams ranked among the top three in the country. Erik Shoji is a veteran libero and Micah Ma’a a promising setter and outside hitter for the U.S. indoor volleyball team.</p>
<p>Shelby Baron is a Rio Paralympic wheelchair tennis player who is now ranked third in the country.</p>
<p>It’s possible that they could all qualify for the Tokyo Games, which have been postponed to summer 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Punahou, whose name means “the New Spring,” referencing renewal and a spring at the center of the campus, bills itself as the largest single-campus independent school in the U.S. and reportedly the oldest west of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>It was founded in 1841 with a first class of 15 students who were children of congregational missionaries. Now, it has more than 3,700. Annual tuition is $26,000, though there are financial aid options.</p>
<p>“This used to be an elite school, you know. Mostly rich. Predominantly Caucasian,” said Eric Kusunoki, who was Obama’s homeroom teacher for four years as part of his four decades working at Punahou. “But then when I stepped foot here, I said, wow, you know, it’s so diverse. Hawaii’s golden people, you know.</p>
<p>“It’s [a] very cosmopolitan campus and very reflective of what Hawaii is like.”</p>
<p>The school has been compared to Stanford. Sports Illustrated ranked it the No. 1 high school athletic program in 2008, replete with an eight-page magazine spread, and again in 2009. The magazine deemed it a “76-acre citadel of academic and athletic excellence where Aristotle meets Duke Kahanamoku.”</p>
<p>Kahanamoku, the Olympic swimming champion and surfing pioneer, never attended Punahou.</p>
<p>But several famous athletes are among the alumni. Like Michelle Wie, Manti Te’o and Obama, who played one season of varsity basketball on the Buff n’ Blue’s 1979 state title team.</p>
<p>In fact, Obama wrote in his autobiography that the lure of Punahou helped keep him in the States with his grandparents rather than flying back to Indonesia with his mom.</p>
<p>Obama, needing a financial aid scholarship to attend, toured the campus with his grandfather before the fifth grade. “Gramps grabbed me by the arm. ‘Hell, Bar,’ he whispered, ‘this isn’t a school. This is heaven,’” Obama wrote.</p>
<p>“He wasn’t a big standout,” Kusunoki said of the student they called Barry. “But yet everybody knew him. He was well-liked, well-known, but he did it real subtly.”</p>
<p>Others followed Obama with athletic success. Reynolds was a skateboard prodigy, profiled by the local NBC affiliate as a 10-year-old before leaving Punahou after 10th grade. He switched to online classes to accommodate all his traveling for competition.</p>
<p>Skateboarding and surfing are not sanctioned high school sports in Hawaii. Moore still won a record 11 National Scholastic Surfing Association titles. In her spare time, she was such a convincing tour guide for prospective Punahou students that admissions officers called her “The Closer,” according to SI.</p>
<p>“I have heard this,” Moore said, smiling when told the nickname. “It wasn’t really ever a big thing for me, but yes, I would bring potential prospects that would come to the school and stuff and give them tours.</p>
<p>“It’s just a beautiful environment to learn. It’s a very comfortable, free environment. The best part of this community is they’re going to support you in chasing your dreams.”</p>
<p>Moore said she was classmates with Taylor Crabb, one half of the U.S.’ top-ranked men’s beach volleyball team. Taylor’s mom, Paula, a champion canoe racer, has been a Punahou P.E. teacher since Obama was there. Taylor and partner Jake Gibb have been competing against Taylor’s older brother, Trevor, and Tri Bourne for Olympic beach volleyball berths.</p>
<p>It’s possible both Crabb brothers, who grew up a five-minute walk from the Punahou campus, can make it to Tokyo.</p>
<p>“Whenever someone says, oh, I went to Punahou, the first thing someone says is, oh, it’s where Barack Obama went,” said Trevor, who won a state basketball title and goes back to campus about once a year to see the old gym.</p>
<p>Shoji’s father, Dave, was the University of Hawaii’s women’s volleyball coach for 42 years, capturing four national titles and retiring in 2017 as the winningest coach in NCAA history. Ma’a won four state titles in volleyball at Punahou and others in football and basketball. At 22 and fresh out of UCLA, he was the second-youngest U.S. player at the 2019 Volleyball Nations League.</p>
<p>Both Trevor Crabb and Moore said you wouldn’t know it by walking around campus that Obama once roamed the grounds. He contributed to just one of a reported 505 state championships in the school’s history, a record for any state.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing up there yet,” of the 44th U.S. President, Moore said, “but it’s definitely something the school is very proud of.”</p>
