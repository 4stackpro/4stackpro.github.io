<p>QUITO, March 29 (Xinhua) &ndash; The death toll from the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has hit 57 in Ecuador, with 1,890 people testing positive, the deputy minister of health, Julio Lopez, said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The latest report adds nine more names to the list of fatalities and 67 new cases to the total over a 24-hour period, the official said in an online press conference broadcast on public television.</p>
<p>The majority of fatalities (37) and infections (1,376) were centered in the southwest province of Guayas, home to the bustling industrial port of Guayaquil.</p>
<p>To contain the epidemic, the government declared the province a special security zone, and deployed both military troops and police officers to the region to enforce prevention measures.</p>
<p>Key government officials were also dispatched to coordinate the efforts, including Vice President Otto Sonnenholzner and Health Minister Juan Carlos Zevallos.</p>
<p>According to the ministry, the virus is present in 23 of the country&rsquo;s 24 provinces, where a curfew and quarantine are in place as part of a nationwide state of emergency.</p>
<p>Of the total confirmed cases, 1,595 are well enough to be recovering at home under self-quarantine, and three have recovered, the ministry said.

<h3 id="ecuador-struggles-to-collect-the-dead-as-coronavirus-spreads">Ecuador struggles to collect the dead as coronavirus spreads</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png" alt="img">

<p>GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador/QUITO, March 30 (Reuters) - Ecuadorean authorities said on Monday they would improve the collection of corpses, as delays related to the rapid spread of the new coronavirus has left families keeping their loved ones&rsquo; bodies in their homes for days in some cases.</p>
<p>Residents of Guayaquil, Ecuador&rsquo;s largest city, have complained they have no way to dispose of relatives&rsquo; remains due to strict quarantine and curfew measures designed to prevent spread of the disease. Last week, authorities said they had removed 100 corpses from homes in Guayaquil.</p>
<p>But delays in collecting bodies in the Andean country, which has reported 1,966 cases of the virus and 62 deaths, were evident midday on Monday in downtown Guayaquil, where a man&rsquo;s dead body lay on a sidewalk under a blue plastic sheet, according to a Reuters witness.</p>
<p>Police said the man had collapsed while waiting in line to enter a store. Reuters could not identify the man or the cause of his death. Hours later on Monday, the body had been removed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The government&rsquo;s intention is that everyone who passes away these days in Guayaquil, not just those who have died from COVID-19, can have a dignified burial,&rdquo; Vice President Otto Sonnenholzner told reporters on Monday,</p>
<p>Authorities also announced they would create a task force for collecting and burying the dead. Emergency humanitarian flights were suspended for Ecuadoreans who had been stranded abroad due to travel restrictions and were seeking to return to the country.</p>
<p>More than 70% of the country&rsquo;s coronavirus cases, which is among the highest tallies in Latin America, are in the southern province of Guayas, where Guayaquil is located.</p>
<p>Luiggi Ponce, a 22-year-old who lives in a working class area of the city, believes his uncle, who died four days ago, was infected. The body is still in his home, where five children and seven adults live.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had pneumonia, he had a fever, he could not breathe, he had all the symptoms,&rdquo; Ponce said via telephone. &ldquo;The body is wrapped up in plastic. The whole house smells bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Local media have broadcast images of long lines outside cemeteries in Guayaquil of people seeking burial for deceased relatives.</p>
<p>Sebastian Barahona, coordinator of the National Federation of Funeral Homes, said Guayaquil was seeing around five times more deaths in March than a normal month.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The response capacity is not prepared for what this emergency requires,&rdquo; Barahona said.</p>

<p>QUITO, March 30 (Xinhua) &ndash; The death toll from COVID-19 in Ecuador has climbed to 60, with a total of 1,962 people testing positive for the disease, Deputy Health Minister Ernesto Carrasco said on Monday.</p>
<p>In recent hours, two more patients died and 38 new infections were detected, Carrasco said on a state-run television network, adding 23 of the country&rsquo;s 24 provinces have reported cases of infection.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the cases, or 71.15 percent, are centered in southwest Guayas province, which has 1,396 COVID-19 patients, and most of those, or 978, were reported in the regional capital Guayaquil, the country&rsquo;s second-largest city with 2.7 million inhabitants.</p>
<p>Ecuador &ldquo;has secured a good supply of quick tests (for COVID-19) that are due to arrive this week,&rdquo; and will be used initially to test priority sectors, such as medical workers and security forces on the frontlines of the fight against the epidemic, said Carrasco.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Maria Paula Romo said Ecuador&rsquo;s emergency committee has decided to extend the suspension of in-office work for both public- and private-sector employees from the original March 31 deadline to April 5.</p>
<p>The measure was one of many that Ecuador has announced to try to contain the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>The committee will also assess what &ldquo;mechanisms are needed so that basic services can continue to function,&rdquo; said Romo.
