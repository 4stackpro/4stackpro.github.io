Taapsee Pannu speaks on COVID-19 lockdown as a time of self-reflection</p>
<p>Taapsee Pannu is making the most of her time in isolation at home watching movies, cooking food, unwinding and sharing a plethera of her pictures on Instagram.</p>
<p>During a recent virtual conversation with Times of India, Taapsee was asked whether this time period has been a time for introspection.</p>
<p>The Thappad actress replied, “I don’t need this kind of a break to introspect. I live in the moment, and generally, I know where I currently am (in my headspace). I don’t think a lot about how much I have done or what needs to be done. A lot of people have asked whether I am introspecting during this phase, but I do that on a regular basis.”</p>
<p>Taapsee often shares pictures and posts that have a hidden story in them. Talking about the same she said, “I started revisiting a lot of pictures from my phone memory, especially the photos that had a small story behind them. I thought that every day I would post one of these pictures, instead of posting the regular hot and cool pictures, which we generally post of ourselves. We can do that in regular times. This is not a regular time for any of us. So, I thought that I would do something else, where people on social media could get to know a little more about the real me.”

Taapsee Pannu shares throwback photo in blue saree with short hair</p>
<p>Bollywood actress Taapsee Pannu, who is in self-isolation amid the coronavirus lockdown, shared a behind the scenes photo from one of her photoshoots, donning a blue saree with short hair.</p>
<p>The Thappad actress turned to Instagram and shared the dazzling picture.</p>
<p>She wrote, “The day I accepted my flaws was the day I came into my true self n my flaws helped me get a unique identity.”</p>
<p>Taapsee says “This is like a BTS from a shoot I did for Gaurang. I remember how I was concerned that my short hair won’t suit the sarees he makes Coz they r so traditional but he was so nonchalant about it n said we will use your original hair length, colour, texture, everything natural, everything YOU. That really made me think sometimes you just have to embrace how you look only then the world will embrace it.”</p>
<p>“Shying away from how you look is never going to help you grow in life. The day I accepted my flaws was the day I came into my true self n my flaws helped me get a unique identity.”</p>
<p>The actress has been treating her fans with adorable throwback photos amid the coronavirus lockdown.
