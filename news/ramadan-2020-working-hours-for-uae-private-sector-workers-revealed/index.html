Working hours for private sector employees in the UAE will be reduced by two hours for the duration of Ramadan, the government has announced.</p>
<p>The Minister of Human Resources and Emiratisation, Nasser Al Hamli, revealed the adjusted working hours for staff in a circular issued by the ministry on Friday.</p>
<p>The circular also urged employers to continue following the precautionary measures taken to protect workers from coronavirus, the ministry said.</p>
<p>Muslims in the UAE began fasting from dawn to dusk on Friday as Ramadan began across the Islamic world.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic poses a challenge to Muslims observing the holy month, with restrictions on large gatherings and mosque closures bringing some changes to Ramadan.</p>
<p>Public sector workers in the UAE will also work reduced hours during the holy month.</p>
<p>The Federal Authority for Government Human Resources last week announced that federal and ministerial employees will work for five hours each day, with office hours beginning at 9am and ending at 2pm.</p>
<p>Most workers in the UAE, however, are expected to be working from home due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Ramadan 2020:All you need to know | Representational image</p>
<p>Ramadan or Ramzan is recognised as the holy month when Muslims worldwide observe fasting from dawn to dusk. It falls in the ninth month of the Islamic calendar to mark the first revelation of the holy book, Quran, to prophet Muhammad.</p>
<p>As per the Islamic beliefs, God forgives the past sins of the devotees who prays and fasts with faithful intentions.</p>
<p>The word Ramadan in Arabic means extreme dryness and intolerable heat. Ramadan begins and ends with the appearance of the new moon. This year Ramadan is expected to begin from Thursday, April 23 and will conclude on Saturday, May 23, 2020.</p>
<p>Ramadan 2020: Importance of fasting</p>
<p>The basic idea of fasting is to practice self-restraint, a period of introspection, communal prayer (salat), charity and reading the Quran.</p>
<p>Observing fast is an act of spiritual purification of the mind and the body.</p>
<p>As per the holy book Quran, fasting during Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam. The other pillars of Islam are a declaration of faith, daily prayer, charity and going for Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca.</p>
<p>Ramadan 2020: Time of Fasting</p>
<p>Sawm begins a few hours after the sighting of the moon at sunrise and continues until sunset. Devotees pray five times a day and do not eat or drink during the course of the day. They refrain themselves from sinful acts, such as false speech, insulting, cursing, lying, and fighting, that may negate the reward of fasting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous.&rdquo; -Quran</p>
<p>They take their meal before dawn and after sunset. The meal which is taken before the sunrise is called Suhur and the meal taken after the sunset is called Iftar.</p>
<p>Devotees with their family and friends end the fast by eating dates before the evening meal Iftar, it&rsquo;s a traditional way. The Iftar is arranged in a grand manner with the varieties of dishes served on the table.</p>
<p>But this year due to Covid-19 Coronavirus pandemic, people will maintain the social distancing and celebrate the occasion with family.</p>
<p>After the Holy month of Ramadan draws to a close, Eid al-Fitr takes place. This year, the festival is expected to fall on May 23 or 24.</p>
<p>Keeping the occasion in mind here are some wishes, quotes, messages, and pictures you send to family, friends and loved ones during Ramzan amid of Cornvirus lockdown to stay positive.</p>
<p>Here are some wishes, quotes and messages you send to family and friends during Ramadan 2020 | Representational image</p>
<p>Ramadan 2020: Wishes, quotes, messages, and pictures</p>
<p>&ldquo;May your Ramadaan be blessed (Ramadaan Mubarak) and May Allah accept your good deeds as sincerely done for Him (Taqabbal Allaahu minnaa wa minkum)&rdquo; -Dr. Bilal Philips</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the month of Ramzan starts, the gates of the heaven are opened and the gates of Hell are closed and the devils are chained.&rdquo; -Imam Bukhari</p>
<p>&ldquo;I look back and half of Ramadan is over in the blink of an eye. Before I know I will be saying that about my entire life.&rdquo; -Nouman Ali khan</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fasting is a shield, it will protect you from the hell fire and prevent you from sins.&rdquo; -Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Ramzan begins, the gates of paradise are opened.&rdquo; -Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conquer your lustful desires and your wisdom will be perfected.&rdquo; -Imam Ali (AS)</p>
<p>&ldquo;The remembrance of Allah brings Tranquility to hearts.&rdquo; -Imam Ali (AS)</p>
<p>&lsquo;Make this Ramadan a turning point in your life. Break free from the deceptions of this world and indulge in the sweetness of Eman. Ramadan Mubarak!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ramadan is about breaking bad habits, not putting them on pause. Ramadan Mubarak!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;End of Ramadan is not &ldquo;The End&rdquo; but start of a new journey leading towards Jannah. Ramadan Mubarak.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ramadan 2020: Donate alms</p>
<p>Muslims, during Ramadan, donate alms to the poor and feed the hungry.</p>
<p>Prophet Muhammad said, &ldquo;He who gives iftar to another fasting person shall earn reward equivalent to a fasting man without detracting from the reward of the latter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is believed that Allah loves the deeds that are done constantly even if they may be small. Ramadan is like Rain. It nourishes the seed of good deeds. Ramadan Mubarak to all.</p>

<p>Abu Dhabi: Ramadan will start on Friday, April 24, the UAE’s moon-sighting committee announced late on Thursday. The holy month of fasting observed by Muslims around the world lasts for 29 or 30 days (lunar cycle) and is dependent on the Hijri or Islamic calendar.</p>
<p>The announcement was made after the committee’s meeting after Maghreb prayers.</p>
<p>The holy month of fasting observed by Muslims around the world lasts for 29 or 30 days (lunar cycle) and is dependent on the Hijri or Islamic calendar.</p>
<p>The first day of Ramadan is traditionally marked by the sighting of the crescent moon with the naked eye, and is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. April 23 is 30th of Sha’ban which is the last day of the Islamic month right before Ramadan.</p>
<p>During Ramadan, adult Muslims fast from dawn to dusk. The start and end of the fast is marked by prayer times - Fajr prayers in the morning marks the start while Maghreb prayers mark the end of the fast for the day. The fast starts after a light meal before Fajr called &lsquo;suhour&rsquo; while the meal ending the fast is called &lsquo;iftar&rsquo;. On Friday, in Dubai the first day of Ramadan, Fajr timing is at 4.27am, while Maghreb is at 6.49pm.</p>
<p>It is permissible for COVID-19 patients not to fast Ramadan, the UAE Fatwa Council announced on Sunday. Healthy people must fast, declared the council following a virtual meeting chaired by Sheikh Abdullah bin Bayyah, a few days prior to the start of the fasting month — expected to fall on Friday, April 24.</p>
<p>During Ramadan, Muslims pray every night, reciting different chapters each day until the Quran is completed by Eid Al Fitr. This is called the Taraweeh prayer, which is recited after Isha prayers mid-evening.</p>
<p>This year, Muslims will observe a Ramadan like none before due to the spread of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Congregational and Taraweeh prayers will be performed at home since mosques and places of worship will continue to be shut throughout Ramadan for people’s safety.</p>
