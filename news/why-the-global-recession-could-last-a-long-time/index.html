LONDON — The world is almost certainly ensnared in a devastating recession delivered by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Now, fears are growing that the downturn could be far more punishing and long lasting than initially feared — potentially enduring into next year, and even beyond — as governments intensify restrictions on business to halt the spread of the pandemic, and as fear of the virus reconfigures the very concept of public space, impeding consumer-led economic growth.</p>
<p>The pandemic is above all a public health emergency. So long as human interaction remains dangerous, business cannot responsibly return to normal. And what was normal before may not be anymore. People may be less inclined to jam into crowded restaurants and concert halls even after the virus is contained.</p>
<p>The abrupt halt of commercial activity threatens to impose economic pain so profound and enduring in every region of the world at once that recovery could take years. The losses to companies, many already saturated with debt, risk triggering a financial crisis of cataclysmic proportions.

As governments everywhere restrict movement and business, and consumers are afraid to spend money, recovery from the abrupt halt may take years.</p>
<p>The secretary general of the United Nations, António Guterres, on Wednesday called the outbreak the greatest test the world had seen since World War II.</p>
<p>“This is already shaping up as the deepest dive on record for the global economy for over 100 years,” said one Harvard economist, adding that if it lasted long, it would be “the mother of all financial crises.”</p>
<p>Case study: France is throwing financial lifelines to struggling businesses, and testing whether preventing mass joblessness can hasten economic recovery.</p>
<p>Another angle: In China, starting up the economy again has already proved harder than shutting it down.

<h3 id="its-like-groundhog-day-why-the-last-recession-will-make-this-one-harder">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s like Groundhog Day&rsquo;: Why the last recession will make this one harder</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/01/PCIN/e14b6048-5a1e-49fd-9e1c-42ece90fb95c-040120_MCBURNIE_01.jpg?crop=4624,2601,x0,y170&amp;width=3200&amp;height=1680&amp;fit=bounds" alt="img">

<p>Maybe it’s because he’s spending his retirement savings on groceries again, or because he’s on the phone every day trying to sign up for unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s the constant fear of losing his health insurance or the uncertainty of when he’ll be able to work again.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, or maybe for all those reasons, Scott McBurnie has been living with an overwhelming sense of déjà vu for the past two weeks. For him, the Great Shutdown of 2020 feels a lot like the Great Recession of 2009.</p>
<p>“It’s like Groundhog Day,” said McBurnie, a waiter from Fairfield who’s been out of work since March 15. “Here we go again.”</p>

<p>It could be worse this time around. Despite a decade-long economic recovery, the wounds of the last recession haven’t healed for millions of workers, like McBurnie, who lost savings, benefits and other assets a decade ago and never got them back.</p>
<p>Now, economists say, all those workers still stinging from the last recession are more vulnerable to the hardships of the next one.</p>
<p>And the next one is on the way, thanks to shutdowns and layoffs associated with the novel coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>An Enquirer analysis of the most recent U.S. Census estimates reveals the depth of the problem: Median household income in the Cincinnati region was lower and the poverty rate was higher in 2018 than before the Great Recession. In other words, almost a decade into the recovery, the region still hadn’t made up all the ground it lost after the crash of 2008.</p>
<p>Some communities lagged far behind. In Butler, Boone and Campbell counties, median income was about 6% lower than before the recession. In Hamilton County, it was 3% lower.</p>
<p>And poverty was worse, too, with more than 252,000 people in the region living below the poverty line – 20,000 more than before the last recession.</p>
<p>The Great Recession put millions of workers into a deep hole. By 2018, they&rsquo;d almost regained what they lost, but income still lagged pre-recession levels and poverty rates were still higher. (Photo: Mike Nyerges and Dan Horn/The Enquirer)</p>
<p>As the economy turns ugly once again, those numbers are ominous not only for poor workers living paycheck to paycheck, but also for middle-class workers, such as McBurnie, whose lives could be upended by even a temporary loss of income.</p>
<p>“You have millions of Americans losing their jobs,” said Janet Harrah, an economist at Northern Kentucky University. “This is not just a question about poverty. There’s probably 65% to 75% of the population that is going to be facing really tough times.”</p>
<p>&lsquo;A shock to the system&rsquo;</p>
<p>The lingering effects of the last recession have a lot to do with that dire prediction. An annual survey by Prosperity Now found 4 in 10 Americans last year could not withstand even a brief disruption to their income without experiencing hardship.</p>
<p>Before the Great Recession, it was 2 in 10 Americans.</p>
<p>“The last recession was so deep,” Harrah said. “To have another come on top of it … is going to be a shock to the system.”</p>
<p>A shock is how McBurnie, 58, describes the turn of events that left him jobless again, after spending the past four years waiting tables full-time at First Watch in Liberty Township. The work provided a steady income and modest benefits, including health insurance.</p>
<p>For a guy who had spent two and a half years on unemployment after the Great Recession, the job was a godsend. He’d even been able to save a little every month, which helped reboot a retirement account that had been wiped out by the recession.</p>
<p>“I saved what I could,” said McBurnie, who worked in hotel management before the last recession. “It’s frightening. I don’t know that it’ll ever go back to where it was.”</p>
<p>He has reason to worry. The last recession hollowed out the wealth of Americans in every income bracket but the top 10%. In 2016, according to the U.S. Federal Reserve, only the wealthiest Americans had recovered the savings, investments and real estate income they’d lost in the recession. Everyone else was trying to catch up.</p>
<p>McBurnie thought he was starting to make progress, but now he’s spending his retirement savings on groceries and day-to-day expenses again.</p>
<p>He’s also re-learning how to navigate a complicated unemployment benefit system that’s so far denied his claim. He’s been unable to reach anyone in the state unemployment office to explain why.</p>
<p>Still, McBurnie considers himself luckier than many of his coworkers. He lives in a house owned by his husband, who’s retired and on a fixed income, so he’s in little danger of being put out on the street.</p>
<p>The greatest threat this crisis poses to McBurnie may be years away, when he hopes to have some savings left to supplement Social Security. He knows well from the Great Recession how expensive being unemployed can be.</p>
<p>Food. Gas. A doctor’s bill. No expense is small when you don’t have a job. The uncertainty, though, might be the worst part of all this, McBurnie said. How long will the shutdown last? What jobs will be left when it’s over?</p>
<p>“The only people who are going to be working for a while are grocery clerks and health care professionals,” McBurnie said.</p>
<p>A brutal one-two punch</p>
<p>That’s an exaggeration, but maybe not a big one. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis this week estimated as many as 47 million Americans could be out of work at the peak of the shutdown, whenever that occurs, driving up the unemployment rate to 32%.</p>
<p>In February, it was 3.5%</p>
<p>The new recession’s sudden onset and the lingering damage from the previous recession could be a costly one-two punch.</p>
<p>“The number of Americans who can withstand a month to two months without any earnings is pretty low,” said Christopher Nicak, director of research at the University of Cincinnati’s Alpaugh Family Economics Center.</p>
<p>That’s especially true in the Cincinnati region, he said, where 1 in 5 jobs are in industries hit hardest by the shutdown: transportation, hotels and accommodations, food services and arts and recreation.</p>
<p>Those also tend to be lower-paying jobs held by workers who are least able to withstand an economic downturn.</p>
<p>Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who issued the state’s stay-at-home order to control the pandemic, has acknowledged the pain the shutdown has inflicted on workers and businesses. Some, he said, might now be “teetering on the edge.”</p>
<p>Tina Myers is one of them. Her hair salon, Pinnokios, on West Court Street in downtown Cincinnati had been doing well and attracting new customers this year until DeWine ordered all non-essential businesses to close on March 18.</p>

<p>The shock hasn’t worn off yet, but enough time has passed that she’s starting to have painful flashbacks to the Great Recession. Back then, Myers, 52, almost lost her house because business at the salon dried up, wiping out most of her income.</p>
<p>She survived by getting her finances in order and keeping her business afloat until the worst of the recession had passed. Now, though, Myers feels like she’s back on the edge.</p>
<p>She’s been thinking she might need to get another job until her salon reopens, provided she can find one.</p>
<p>“My salon is my life and all I have,” Myers said. “The idea of losing my shop is frightening. I’ve worked hard to keep it.”</p>
<p>Like Myers, who is ready to reopen her salon tomorrow if given the go-ahead, McBurnie is ready to return to work at the restaurant. He’s been told his job is waiting for him when the shutdown ends.</p>
<p>But for Myers and McBurnie, the wait is frustrating. And expensive. Every day without work puts them deeper into a financial hole they thought they’d left for good.</p>
<p>“I have a job,” McBurnie said. “I just can’t go to it.”</p>
