<p>In normal circumstances, the prospect of starting a new job would hold the excitement of a fresh start and, potentially, a better pay packet.</p>
<p>But in the midst of the coronavirus lockdown, thousands of people who moved jobs in the past month have found themselves caught in a web of financial hardship and stress.</p>
<p>That is because the recently-announced government support for workers specifies people can only receive wage grants if they started their job before the 28 February cut-off date.</p>
<p>As a result, people who would have been furloughed in their old jobs are facing uncertain futures and grappling with the benefits system for the first time.</p>
<p>Here are some of their stories.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I changed job a day too late&rsquo;</p>
<p>Image copyright Bryn Robinson Image caption Bryn Robinson accepted a new job on 29 February, a day after the government&rsquo;s cut-off</p>
<p>Bryn Robinson, from Essex, accepted a new job in the motor industry on 29 February.</p>
<p>But a week ago, father-of-two Mr Robinson was told his new company would be shutting down as it was deemed a non-essential business.</p>
<p>He hoped to benefit from the government scheme, which companies can use to pay their staff 80% of their wages - up to Â£2,500 a month.</p>
<p>But the Treasury says qualifying employees must be registered on the company&rsquo;s PAYE system by 28 February to limit the possibility of fraud.</p>
<p>Now Mr Robinson potentially faces months without a salary, the only household income being his wife&rsquo;s maternity pay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It feels unjust,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not trying to defraud the government out of anything - I just changed job a day too late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been employed for the last 12 years and I&rsquo;ve worked and paid into the system.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I changed job a day earlier I would be eligible. It seems a bit unfair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve moved in with grandma&rsquo;</p>
<p>Image copyright Chelsea Metcalfe Image caption Chelsea Metcalfe was due to start a new career as a veterinary nurse, but her life has been put on hold</p>
<p>For Chelsea Metcalfe, the future looked bright.</p>
<p>The former charity worker was due to start her &ldquo;dream job&rdquo; on Monday as a veterinary nurse and was also expecting to move into her own flat.</p>
<p>Instead, with the surgery&rsquo;s hours reduced to emergency appointments only, she has had to take unpaid leave - although her role will be kept open.</p>
<p>After finding herself unable to commit to paying rent, she has had to move into temporary accommodation with her grandmother in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old said: &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve got no security of a job or income and I&rsquo;m not getting any help from the government.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For people who&rsquo;ve paid their taxes and national insurance all their life, it makes you feel like you&rsquo;re not supported at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some MPs have suggested those who have fallen through the financial support crack should sign up for Universal Credit or try to find work in supermarkets - although the latter choice is not open to everyone.</p>
<p>Ms Metcalfe said her 84-year-old grandmother has a number of underlying health conditions, adding: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t risk working in a supermarket because it could make my grandma really ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My old boss will furlough me&rsquo;</p>
<p>Image copyright Debbie Rice Image caption Debbie Rice with her husband Colin and son Oliver</p>
<p>Some new starters have been advised by MPs to return to their former employers to ask if they can offer support.</p>
<p>Debbie Rice was in exactly that position.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old started a new administrative job on 3 March, but the company then began furloughing staff.</p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;My current employer felt guilty they couldn&rsquo;t pay me or give me the 80% furlough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was the only person who was a new starter, so I was the only one who didn&rsquo;t qualify to be furloughed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luckily, Mrs Rice found support from her former boss who had been looking into furloughing her prior to her departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was lucky,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The position I&rsquo;m in is rare. To ask people to go back to their old employers is tough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For so many people they&rsquo;ve had a negative reaction going back to their old employers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m campaigning for change&rsquo;</p>

<p>Natalie Greenway from Burbage in Leicestershire, cannot be furloughed by her current employer as she started a new job on 16 March.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old is one of a group of people who are campaigning on social media to get the government&rsquo;s job retention scheme cut-off date amended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The group is growing exponentially,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Nearly 4,000 people belong to a Facebook group on the topic and thousands are Tweeting their experiences under the hashtag #newstarterfurlough.</p>
<p>Ms Greenway, who moderates the group, said hundreds of people were writing to their MPs appealing for help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had messages that are harrowing, that are hard to read,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had messages from people who don&rsquo;t know how they&rsquo;re going to feed their kids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The government isn&rsquo;t listening and the blanket statement that some people are always going to lose out isn&rsquo;t good enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A government spokesman said: &ldquo;[The scheme] allows for those who were on the payroll of a company on 28 February but subsequently left to be put back on payroll and furloughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This includes those who have resigned to start a new job after 28 February.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decisions around whether to offer to furlough someone are down to the individual company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Treasury said previously: &ldquo;Firms can re-employ staff made redundant after 1 March and those who do not qualify will be able to access a range of other support - including an increase in the Universal Credit allowance, income tax deferrals, Â£1bn more support for renters and access to three-month mortgage holidays.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="coronavirus-and-job-loss-what-is-a-furlough-versus-a-layoff">Coronavirus and job loss: What is a furlough versus a layoff?</h3>

As retailers shutter stores nationwide to help combat the spread of the coronavirus, many major chains like Macyâs, JCPenny, and Gap have furloughed their employees. Other companies, like newspaper publisher Gannett and fitness studio SoulCycle, are following suit to cut costs.</p>
<p>Companies use furloughs to try to avoid reducing their workforce altogether during hard times. Furloughed workers remain on an employerâs payroll but arenât paid for the period they are not actively working.</p>
<p>After the furlough, employees can return to work and avoid any paperwork or processes to become an active employee, said Amber Clayton, the knowledge center director at SHRM, a human resources membership association.</p>
<p>âIt makes it easier for them to return without any kind of administrative burden on the employer or the employee,â Clayton said.</p>
<p>Hereâs everything you need to know about being furloughed.</p>

<p>Furlough vs. layoff</p>
<p>A furlough is temporary and requires a worker to take some unpaid time off or work reduced hours. It could last from a couple of days to a couple of months.</p>
<p>A layoff is a temporary separation of employment, meaning the worker is removed from the payroll for a limited time. Some Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Acts may require employers to give advance notice of a layoff, but no notice is required for a furlough under six months.</p>
<p>The layoff is also different from a termination or reduction in workforce because there is an expectation that the employer will recall individuals back to work.</p>

<p>What does a furlough look like?</p>
<p>A furlough may require reduced hours or taking a period of unpaid time off. It also depends if the employees are exempt or nonexempt.</p>
<p>A company could furlough nonexempt employees one day a year or require they work only 32 hours a week instead of the regular 40 hours per week, according to SHRM.</p>

<p>Exempt employees - or salaried workers - can be furloughed, but in a way that doesnât threaten their exempt status under Fair Labor Standards Act. One way to do this is to require exempt employees to take a full week off unpaid, which is what Gannett is doing. The FLSA says that exempt workers donât have to be paid for any week they donât work.</p>
<p>Unemployment benefits while furloughed</p>
<p>Many of those who have been furloughed may be eligible for unemployment benefits, depending on the state where you live. During the federal shutdown many furloughed employees were eligible for unemployment insurance. However, if the furlough is only a week and you donât meet the state requirements you may be ineligible, according to Clayton.</p>

<p>The $2 trillion coronavirus relief package called the CARE Act also will help furloughed workers. It provides an additional $600 a week for four months, in addition to the unemployment benefit workers would typically get with their state.</p>

<h3 id="manchester-city-announces-it-will-not-furlough-employees-amid-coronavirus">Manchester City announces it will not furlough employees amid coronavirus</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NBb7C9kghwsDFtMhlj.w9g--~B/aD0zNDg1O3c9NTIyODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-04/cd713a90-776a-11ea-bffa-98a603d2cb52" alt="img">
Manchester City will keep paying its workers during the coronavirus pandemic. While a number of Premier League teams have opted to furlough employees, Manchester City is the first to announce it will not do that, according to Goal.com.</p>
<p>Manchester City made the announcement a day after Liverpool was criticized for furloughing its non-playing staff. In a statement, City said it was âdetermined to protect our people, their jobs and our business.â</p>
<p>âCity took a divergent move on Sunday, with a club spokesperson saying in a statement: &ldquo;We can confirm, following a decision by the chairman and board last week, that Manchester City will not be utilising the UK Government&rsquo;s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (government-funded furloughing). &ldquo;We remain determined to protect our people, their jobs and our business, whilst at the same time doing what we can to support our wider community at this most challenging time for everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why was Liverpool criticized for furloughing employees?</p>
<p>Under the UKâs program, furloughed workers will receive 80 percent of their wages from the government. Liverpool says it will pay the remaining 20 percent of furloughed employeesâ salaries, meaning Liverpool employees who were furloughed will receive their full salary while games are postponed.</p>
<p>Many people, however, were quick to note Liverpool is one of the richest clubs in the world. Those people believe the team should pay the full amount of employee salaries rather than relying on the government â and taxpayers â to pay for 80 percent of them.</p>
<p>One Liverpool staff member said they felt betrayed by the team upon hearing the news, telling BBC other businesses need the government program more than Liverpool.</p>
<p>Liverpool isnât the only team furloughing its employees. Bournemouth, Newcastle, Norwich and Tottenham have all placed employees on the furlough program.</p>
<p>Manchester City has the money to pay employees</p>
<p>Manchester City has one of the richest owners in the sport in Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and the club has spent exorbitant sums on players. Such spending attracted the attention of UEFA and its Financial Fair Play regulations, and Manchester City is currently banned from the Champions League for two seasons as punishment.</p>
<p>While this gesture doesnât absolve City of those violations, at least the team is using its money to do something good this time around.</p>
