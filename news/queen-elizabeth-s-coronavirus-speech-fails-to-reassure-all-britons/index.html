A family in Manchester watches Britain&rsquo;s Queen Elizabeth II during a televised address to the nation, on Sunday 5 April 2020, during the coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown.</p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth II&rsquo;s address on the Covid-19 crisis was broadcast Sunday across the world. The royal speech was just the fifth time the monarch has addressed the nation, outside her annual Christmas message. Some older Britons found it “uplifting”, while others, many younger, were less moved.</p>

<p>In the pre-recorded message, the 94-year-old British monarch spoke from Windsor Castle with only one cameraman in the spacious room, respecting the necessary social distancing rules.</p>
<p>Her speech of under 5 minutes was described by many who spoke to RFI as “reassuring”, “inspiring”, “something we needed to hear”.</p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth II thanked health workers from the NHS and those “helping to protect the vulnerable”, and stressed the need to stay home.</p>

<p>Her call for solidarity was broadcast on a warm Sunday evening when reports from across the UK showed a large number of people sunning in parks or meeting by the sea.</p>
<p>“Though self-isolating may at times be hard, many people are discovering that it presents an opportunity to…reflect,” the monarch said. “I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge.”</p>
<p>Young Britons not impressed</p>
<p>While the Queen is undoubtedly a figure that commands respect, some chose not to watch or listen to her address brought by the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>Megan, a 26-year-old nanny, told RFI that even though she supports the monarchy, she did not watch the Queen.</p>
<p>“I would be more inclined to hear support and encouragement from more relevant people with first-hand experience such as doctors and the police,” she said.</p>
<p>“We need to hear more truths, not messages from those so far removed,” Megan added, citing an example of NHS health workers being held at knifepoint for their ID badges, which took two weeks to be reported.</p>
<p>Engineering student Ahmed, 26, did not switch on to the Queen’s speech as he cannot see how she could “possibly relate” to him both on a “cultural” and “financial” aspect.</p>
<p>A young trainee nurse told RFI she did not watch the address because, being on the frontline herself, she knows what is happening. She criticised the media for not “faithfully” reporting what is taking place.</p>
<p>“I want harder facts out there, not more encouraging speeches,” she said.</p>
<p>Zack, a 27-year-old health and social care coordinator watched the Queen’s speech. “Hers is an opinion we haven’t heard so far,” he said. “Unlike [UK Health minister] Matt Hancock who talks to us every five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“If we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it&rdquo; &ndash; words from Queen Elizabeth II which resonate with 54-year-old Jane who was reassured by “this woman speaking directly from her own experience, having been through World War II&rdquo;.</p>
<p>“She ends with ‘we will meet again’ leaving us with fantastic hope,” Jane added.</p>

<h3 id="the-crown-vs-the-coronavirus-how-the-queens-short-speech-made-the-covid-19-crisis-feel-more-real">The Crown vs the coronavirus: How the Queen&rsquo;s short speech made the COVID-19 crisis feel more real</h3>
<p><img src="https://nationalpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/queens-speech-1.png" alt="img">
I was listening to Classic FM on the weekend when regular programming was interrupted by the voice of Her Majesty the Queen, with a message to the Commonwealth about the coronavirus. Blimey!</p>
<p>Classical FM is a British radio station I listen to on my U.K. Radios app. There’s something extra soothing about hearing classical music from five time zones away. A small tumbler of Scotch feels even more appropriate than usual.</p>
<p>I’m a sucker for all things British. My folks were Canadian, but my father’s parents hailed from Scotland and England (truly a match made in heaven), while my mom descended from the United Empire Loyalists who came to British North America after the American Revolution. As a child, my Saturday dinners were backed by the voice of Ray Sonin hosting CFRB radio’s Calling All Britons.</p>
<p>So, I have a cultural and possibly even genetic affinity for the Crown. (Also Netflix’s The Crown, the first three seasons of which make for great isolation viewing. Season 4 finished principal photography just before the pandemic took hold, which means it should arrive on the streaming service late this year.)</p>
<p>An address from the Queen is not especially rare. She records an annual Christmas message, for instance; the latest touched on the anniversaries of the first moon landing (50) and the D-Day invasions (75), the birth of her eighth great-grandchild (to Harry and Meghan) and the bicentennial of the birth of her great-great-grandmother, Victoria.</p>
<p>But it was only the fifth time she had made such a public rallying cry. The others were mostly personal occasions — on the deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales (1997), and the Queen Mother (2002), and the Queen’s own Diamond Jubilee in 2012. The only world event to thus stir her was the first Gulf War in 1991. Even during the Falklands War of 1982 she was silent.</p>
<p>And so these sudden and brief remarks — just over four minutes in length — had the weirdly galvanizing effect of making the current crisis feel more real. These are strange times, after all. On my rare journeys out of doors, I cross empty streets once teeming with traffic, look skyward for jumbo jets that are no longer there, and watch wild foxes meander unconcerned through urban neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>Is this what it was like living in Toronto in October 1918, a month when 1,800 in the city died of the Spanish Flu, prompting the shutdown of “all theatres, movie picture shows and other places of amusement”? Maybe, but one century can’t be directly mapped onto another. We have radio, television, streaming, Tiger King! Though if we want to ride the streetcar or visit a place of amusement, it’s 1918 all over again.</p>

<p>One way or another, we’re living through history, but we don’t yet know how this era ends, or whether we’re in another epoch altogether. No one woke up on the morning of Oct. 25, 1929, and muttered: “Well, here we are in the Great Depression.”</p>
<p>This is part of what made the Queen’s speech so powerful. The 93-year-old Monarch seemed to be addressing history as well as her people when she said: “Those who come after us will say the Britons of this generation were as strong as any, that the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet, good humoured resolve and of fellow-feeling still characterize this country. The pride in who we are is not a part of our past. It defines our present and our future.”</p>
<p>It was almost Churchillian in its cadence, a subtle reminder that the former Princess Elizabeth, who spoke to child evacuees during the Second World War (80 years ago!) ascended to the throne during Churchill’s second term as Prime Minister. She has seen 14 PMs since; the latest, Boris Johnson, is now in intensive care with COVID-19.</p>
<p>She also struck a remarkably inclusive tone when she noted: “Though self-isolating may at times be hard, many people of all faiths, and of none, are discovering that it presents an opportunity to slow down, pause and reflect in prayer or mediation.” This from a woman whose full title is “Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God,” “Defender of the Faith.”</p>
<p>It was almost Churchillian in its cadence</p>
<p>She concluded with another reminder of past difficulties overcome: “We will be with our friends again, we will be with our families again, we will meet again.”</p>
<p>We’ll Meet Again is of course the song made famous by Vera Lynn (still with us, aged 103) and practically the unofficial anthem of the Second World War. We’ll Meet Again was first recorded in September, 1939. One year later the Blitz began; in its first month, 5,730 Britons were killed in the bombings, almost the same number who have died since March 5, when the nation recorded its first coronavirus-related fatality.</p>
<p>Things aren’t nearly as bad in this corner of the Commonwealth, with 321 deaths as of this writing. But no one is certain what this means. Are we on the verge of locking this thing down? Days away from exponential growth that will make Canada the next Italy, or the next U.S.?</p>
<p>Her Majesty doesn’t know either, but she has forcefully added her voice to the chorus who maintain that staying at home “is the right thing to do.” As I settle down with an afternoon cup of tea (somehow this crisis has flipped a switch in my chromosomes, and I require Earl Grey on a daily basis) I am comforted by that voice. And on this day in history — today — you take comfort wherever you can find it.

<h3 id="boris-johnson-hospitalized-as-queen-urges-british-resolve-in-face-of-epidemic">Boris Johnson Hospitalized as Queen Urges British Resolve in Face of Epidemic</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/05/world/05queen-speech-sub/05queen-speech-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
[Analysis: Peaks, testing and lockdowns: How coronavirus vocabulary causes confusion.]</p>
<p>“On the advice of his doctor, the prime minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests,” a spokesman said Sunday. “This is a precautionary step, as the prime minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus 10 days after testing positive for the virus.”</p>
<p>The British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, is expected to lead the daily cabinet meeting on the pandemic on Monday. Under the government’s succession plan, Mr. Raab would take up Mr. Johnson’s duties if he is incapacitated.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson’s hospitalization is a stark illustration of how deeply the virus has struck governments around the world, sickening officials from Britain to Brazil, killing a senior aide to the supreme leader of Iran, and sending the leaders of Germany and Canada into isolation.</p>
<p>The queen’s speech was only the fourth time in her 68-year reign in which she has addressed the British people, apart from her annual Christmas greeting — and it carried a distinct echo of the celebrated radio address her father, George VI, delivered in September 1939, as Britain stood on the brink of war with Germany.</p>
<p>Like the king eight decades ago, the queen appealed to the quintessential British traits of stoicism and solidarity, and explicitly linked the pandemic to the war as a defining moment for modern Britain. This time, she said, the country needs to come together to vanquish an enemy that brings death not in the terrifying bombing raids of the Blitz but in the ordinary encounters of people transmitting a dangerous pathogen.</p>
<p>“I hope in the years to come, everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge,” the queen said, “and those who come after us will say that the Britons of this generation were as strong as any. That the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet good-humored resolve and of fellow-feeling still characterize this country.”
