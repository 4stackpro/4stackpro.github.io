Embedded in the statement was an acknowledgment that the events of recent weeks had turned the 2020 primary race into less of an ideological contest. The “movement” that Mr. Sanders would frequently liken his campaign to had been rejected by Democratic voters and, then, usurped by events.</p>
<p>In early March, after Covid-19 had grounded him back in Vermont, Mr. Sanders would become less direct in his critique of Mr. Biden and more so of Mr. Trump. He adopted an increasingly disdainful tone against the president. “The first thing we have to do, whether or not I’m president, is to shut this president up right now,” Mr. Sanders said last month in what would be the final Democratic debate of the 2020 primary race. “It is unacceptable for him to be blabbering with un-factual information that is confusing to the general public.”</p>
<p>In a sense, the clear and present threat of the coronavirus softened the debate that had raged for much of 2019 and early 2020. “This virus thing makes it very hard to be political,” said Harry Reid, the former Democratic Senate majority leader. It has focused attention on Mr. Trump in a way that highlights the president’s shortcomings, Mr. Reid added. It also served to minimize the policy differences that were apparent during the Democratic primary race.</p>
<p>“That divide is literally now a matter of life and death,” said Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California and a national co-chairman of the Sanders campaign. Mr. Khanna said he believed progressives would eventually win the day, and would become the dominant force inside the Democratic Party. Not yet, though.</p>
<p>“Maybe that moment will be in 2024, maybe that moment will be in 2028,” Mr. Khanna said. “But the choice in this election is about as clear as can be right now.”</p>
<p>For much of the primary race, the challenge of Democratic unity had been treated as something that could be put off; or at the very least, as a nuisance that would resolve itself through shared aversion to Mr. Trump. But there had also been signs that the split between rank-and-file supporters of Mr. Sanders’s and any eventual nominee not named “Bernie” might be too wide to fully reconcile.</p>
<p>The challenge resonated in part because of how decisive this split proved four years ago. Exit polls from the 2016 presidential race revealed that about 8 percent of former Sanders supporters said they had voted for Mr. Trump — a small but significant number given that Mr. Sanders received nearly 40 percent of the Democratic primary vote; countless other Sanders supporters had either wound up supporting a third-party candidate in November of that year or had not voted at all.

<h3 id="bernie-sanders-suspends-his-presidential-campaign">Bernie Sanders suspends his presidential campaign</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.politico.com/a7/39/04f9c7bc4056aa183139a978b280/200408-bernie-sanders-msm-773.jpg" alt="img">
Sanders said that while Biden will be the nominee, he will stay on the ballot to collect delegates for the convention, &ldquo;where we will be able to exert significant influence over the party platform.”</p>
<p>As recently as Monday, his team told aides it was looking for a regional delegates coordinator, according to an internal email.</p>
<p>By dropping out of the race, Sanders is forgoing any effort to soldier on purely as a movement candidate for his progressive agenda. That prospect — though appealing to many of his most ideological supporters — appeared to dim recently amid the deadly coronavirus outbreak, which has shut down campaign rallies, delayed upcoming primaries and consumed the public’s attention.</p>
<p>“Bernie has put his heart and soul into not only running for president, but for the causes and issues he has been dedicated to his whole life. So, I know how hard a decision this was for him to make — and how hard it is for the millions of his supporters — especially younger voters — who have been inspired and energized and brought into politics by the progressive agenda he has championed,” said Biden in a statement. “Bernie has done something rare in politics. He hasn’t just run a political campaign; he’s created a movement.“</p>
<p>Sanders’ withdrawal marks the culmination of one of the most dramatic turnarounds in presidential primary history, with the Vermont senator on the losing end. A month and a half ago, Sanders appeared in control of the nominating contest, coming off early victories in New Hampshire and Nevada.</p>
<p>But Biden’s victory in South Carolina led rank-and-file voters, and a number of former rivals for moderate support in the Democratic primary, to coalesce around the former vice president, who drubbed Sanders in 10 of 14 states on Super Tuesday and nearly all of the states that came later in March, including a three-state sweep — Arizona, Florida and Illinois — as well as the critical general-election state of Michigan. His withdrawal came a day after the Wisconsin primary, whose result has not yet been announced but was expected to be bad for Sanders.

“Trade in 2020 will fall steeply in every region of the world and basically across all sectors,” Roberto Azevêdo, director general of the W.T.O., said in a video briefing.</p>
<p>The W.T.O. economists believe the sharp fall will be worse than the trade slump from the 2008 financial crisis. Global trade could rebound rapidly, but it would depend on how quickly the pandemic was brought under control, and the policy choices governments took to support their economies, Mr. Azevêdo said.</p>
<p>Germany and France, Europe’s largest economies, warned that they were headed toward their sharpest downturns since World War II, even as some European countries moved toward a loosening of restrictions put in place to slow the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>More than 1.4 million cases of the virus have been confirmed across at least 177 countries, and 86,000 people have died. Here are the latest updates from the U.S., where the virus has stricken more than 418,000 people. We also have the international picture and maps of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Stocks in the U.S. climbed as investors weighed data showing the extent of the economic damage wrought by the coronavirus pandemic against signs of progress in the effort to contain it. The S&amp;P 500 rose more than 2 percent while major indexes in Europe were slightly lower.</p>
<p>New York State, the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, has now confirmed more than 149,000 cases — a higher number than any country outside the United States, including Italy and Spain, the two other countries the pandemic has hit hardest. The death toll hit another daily high but the rate of hospitalizations was flattening.</p>
<p>As many as 150 Saudi royals are believed to have contracted the coronavirus. King Salman, 84, has secluded himself in an island palace on the Red Sea, while Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has retreated with many of his ministers to a remote site on the same coast.</p>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party is investigating an outspoken property tycoon, Ren Zhiqiang, who accused President Xi Jinping of having mishandled the coronavirus outbreak. Mr. Ren, a longtime party member, disappeared last month after having written an essay describing Mr. Xi as a power-hungry “clown.</p>
<p>After a second night in intensive care, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was stable and “responding to treatment” for the coronavirus, a spokesman said. Britain reported 938 new coronavirus deaths on Wednesday, its highest single-day figure.</p>
