<p>New Delhi: This year, Shab-e-Barat will be observed from the evening of 8 April until next morning, but people have been advised to stay at home with their families and practice social distancing in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The Delhi Police Sunday appealed to the Muslim community in the national capital to not venture out their homes for this year’s Shab-e-Barat in light of the nationwide lockdown.</p>
<p>But what is Shab-e-Barat and what is its religious significance?</p>
<p>It’s a day of atonement</p>
<p>An important day for the Muslim community, Shab-e-Barat is observed on the night between day 14 and 15 of Sha’ban — the eighth month of the Islamic calendar, which signifies the month of “separation” as pagan Arabs used to disperse in search of water at this time.</p>
<p>The festival is observed as the night of forgiveness or the day of atonement.</p>
<p>On this day, Muslims visit mosques and the graves of their loved ones and light candles, and spend the night praying for Allah’s mercy.</p>
<p>Muslims believe that if someone prays to Allah throughout the night and seeks forgiveness for all the sins he had committed, he could be forgiven. Hence, Shab-e-Barat is a night devoted to pleading for forgiveness for the past year and good fortune for the coming year.</p>
<p>Sweets like halwa, savaiyyan (vermicelli) are prepared and shared with neighbours, friends and relatives in the memory of those who died during the year, while some prepare sweet dishes and flat bread to distribute among the poor. Flowers are also placed on graves of the deceased family members.</p>
<p>For ascetic Muslims, this is the day of “divine benediction”, and, therefore, they offer prayers and fast, which is said to have greater acceptance from God.</p>

<p>Lockdown orders</p>
<p>With the festival largely celebrated at night, houses and streets are illuminated by candles and skies are filled with fireworks.</p>
<p>The roads around mosques and cemeteries see large crowds on the day of Shab-e-Barat, with extra police deployment to ensure law and order.</p>
<p>Besides Delhi Police, District Magistrate Srinagar Shahid Iqbal Choudhary has issued an order, prohibiting all sorts of religious congregations and public movement on the occasion.</p>
<p>Malegaon blast took place on the night of Shab-e-Barat</p>
<p>The 2006 Malegaon blast had coincided with Shab-e-Barat.</p>
<p>On 8 September, bombs were planted on a bicycle parked near a cemetery in the city of Malegaon in Maharashtra, while Friday prayers were going on at a nearby mosque. Nearly 37 people were killed and over a hundred injured.</p>
<p>Nine Muslim men were arrested and chargesheeted by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Eight accused were later discharged of all terror charges by a sessions court in 2016 citing insufficient ground to proceed against them. One accused died while the case was pending.</p>

<h3 id="the-week-morning-brief-all-party-meet-shab-e-barat">THE WEEK morning brief: All-party meet, Shab-e-Barat</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.theweek.in/content/dam/week/news/india/images/2020/4/2/modi.jpg" alt="img">
All-party meet on coronavirus</p>
<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to chair a meeting at 11am on Wednesday of all floor leaders of political parties in the Parliament to discuss the coronavirus crisis. The meeting will be held with floor leaders of parties with more than 5 MPs in either house of Parliament.</p>
<p>Most opposition parties are expected to attend the meeting, which will discuss the measures against coronavirus and the ongoing nationwide lockdown. The meeting comes amid reports that several states have sought that the lockdown be extended to prevent spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>In addition to the coronavirus situation, the meeting is expected to discuss the government&rsquo;s contentious move to suspend the Member of Parliament Local Area Development scheme (MPLADs), which most opposition parties have decried. The Trinamool Congress has announced it would use the meeting to demand additional funds for states and clearance of dues from the Centre to the states.</p>
<p>Japan emergency takes effect</p>
<p>The state of emergency declared by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in capital Tokyo and six prefectures to curb the spread of the coronavirus will take effect on Wednesday. Governors in Tokyo and the prefectures of Saitama, Kanagawa, Chiba, Osaka, Hyogo and Fukuoka are expected to seek stronger curbs on nonessential outings and some business operations.</p>
<p>While the emergency declaration will not result in the stringent lockdown measures seen in other parts of the world, the move has triggered anxiety in Japan. The seven areas affected by the emergency declaration account for about 50 per cent of Japan&rsquo;s economic output, Bloomberg reported. Bloomberg noted, &ldquo;Automakers, including Nissan Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co., plan to continue assembly, while Toshiba Corp. affiliate Kioxia Holdings is maintaining normal operations at its Yokkaichi plant, a key producer of memory chips for iPhones and other smartphones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Air India to repatriate Canadians</p>
<p>Air India is planning to conduct three special flights to London from Wednesday to Friday to repatriate Canadians who are stranded in India amid a 21-day lockdown imposed to curb the coronavirus pandemic. Once the Air India flights drop them in London, the Canadian government will arrange flights to take them to Canada.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One flight on Delhi-London route will take place on April 8. Another one would take place on April 10,&rdquo; said senior airline officials. One flight on the Mumbai-London route will take place on April 9, official said.</p>
<p>All three special flights to take Canadians from India to London&rsquo;s Heathrow airport will be conducted using the Boeing-777 wide body aircraft.</p>
<p>Shab-e-Barat</p>
<p>The Shab-e-Barat (night of forgiveness) will be observed by Muslims across the world on Wednesday night. Considered a moment of atonement, Shab-e-Barat had traditionally been observed by congregating in mosques and visiting graves of ancestors.</p>
<p>Governments and Muslim community leaders had requested the faithful to observe the occasion at home to minimise possibility of spread of coronavirus.
