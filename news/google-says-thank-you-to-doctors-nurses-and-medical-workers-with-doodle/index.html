<p>Pixel 4 15 Oct, 2019 With Pixel 4 and 4 XL, Google took the phone-interaction experience a notch higher. The tech company claimed that these devices have the fastest face unlock feature, and is the first smartphone to have a radar sensor.

The camera has a Live HDR+ capability which allows it to capture extremely bright or dark images. What’s more? Night Sight feature allows us to take magnificent pictures and dusk shots. While it was not announced during the launch, TOI reported that Pixel 4 XL was unveiled as well. It comes with a 6.3-inch OLED screen. The Pixel 4 has a 2800 mAh battery, while the bigger sibling is backed by a 3700 mAh. Both are powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 and 6GB RAM. Both will be available in 64GB and 128GB variants.

WILMINGTON N.C. &ndash; A 7-year-old North Carolina boy is proof that heroes come in all shapes and sizes.Steven Burgess is staying home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with schools closed until at least May 15.However, he came up with a plan to not only help others, but get some time outside in his backyard. According to ABC-affiliate WWAY , Burgess&rsquo;s mom, Eliza Burgess, said he decided he would run for 6 hours in his backyard to raise money for hospitals, food banks, and missions in his community like Vigilant Hope, Meals for Heroes and Nourish NC.&ldquo;It started out as something fun to do,&rdquo; Eliza Burgess said. &ldquo;Then, I saw he was serious about it, so I thought, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s share this and uplift some people.&rsquo; I have been blown away by the amount of people who want to donate.&ldquo;Around 37,000 steps later, Steven Burgess raised more than $1,500.Steven Burgess said keeping his mission at the front of his mind inspired him to keep his legs moving.&ldquo;I just wanted to raise money for the hospitals and give them help,&rdquo; Steven Burgess said.Both Steven and his mom hope his mini marathon will show others how easy it is to make a difference from your own backyard.&ldquo;I think this will inspire others to show them what they can do,&rdquo; Eliza Burgess said, &ldquo;I think the reason this inspired so much support is that people really do want to plug in and they want to encourage each other and we want to help, and sometimes we don&rsquo;t know what to do because we are all stuck at home.&ldquo;According to WWAY, those who want to donate can email his mother at <a href="mailto:epb0905@gmail.com">epb0905@gmail.com</a>.

<p><img src="https://9to5google.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/04/google_doodle_coronavirus_helpers_1.jpg?resize=1024,512" alt="img">
Last week, Google released a simple and moving ad thanking healthcare workers around the world for combating COVID-19. The company is now continuing that praise by saying thank you to all coronavirus helpers with a series of Google Doodles over the next two weeks.</p>
<p>This week, we’re beginning a series of Doodles to recognize the many people responding to COVID-19 — from doctors and nurses caring for people on the front lines, to teachers and food service workers ensuring essential goods and services are still available</p>
<p>This Google Doodles series — usually reserved for multi-week sporting events like the Olympics and World Cup — coincides with National Public Health Week in the US.</p>
<p>The first thanks public health workers and researchers in the scientific community. Given that there will be several Doodles in this series, Google is using the same basic format where the “G” sends heart/thanks/appreciation/respect to a themed “e” at the end.</p>
<p>Monday’s features graphs depicting curves, while the one tomorrow sees the last letter dressed in scrubs. The Search homepage at the bottom notes who Google is recognizing that day.</p>
<p>Google Doodles: Thank you coronavirus helpers</p>
<p>April 6: Public health workers and to researchers in the scientific community</p>
<p>April 7: Doctors, nurses, and medical workers</p>
<p>April 8: Emergency services workers</p>
<p>April 9: Custodial and sanitation workers</p>
<p>April 10: Farmworkers and farmers</p>
<p>April 13: Grocery workers</p>
<p>April 14: Public transportation workers</p>
<p>Other coronavirus helpers that will see a thank you include:</p>
<p>Over the next two weeks, our Doodles will honor other essential frontline workers, including healthcare workers, first responders, and the many people keeping services like sanitation, food service, public transit, schools, and more up and running. Thank you to all the people who are working to save lives and keep communities safe during this pandemic</p>
