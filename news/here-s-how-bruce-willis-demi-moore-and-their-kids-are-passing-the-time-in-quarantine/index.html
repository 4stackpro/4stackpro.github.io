(CNN) Buzz haircuts, fake mustaches and family paint night are how the Bruce Willis/Demi Moore clan are spending their days while in isolation.</p>
<p>The divorced couple, their three daughters and two of the daughters&rsquo; significant others are quarantining together at Moore&rsquo;s home in Sun Valley, Idaho home.</p>
<p>And thanks to the presence of Moore, 57, and daughters Rumer, 31, Scout, 28, and Tallulah, 26, on social media, we get a glimpse into what&rsquo;s going down in la casa.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, for example, Moore shared a series of photos showing her and the group painting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Family paint night,&rdquo; her caption read.

<p><img src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VP-COMP-BRUCE-1.jpg?strip=all&amp;quality=100&amp;w=1200&amp;h=800&amp;crop=1" alt="img">
BRUCE Willis has joined the Tik Tok gang and parodied his ex-wife, Demi Moore, by reprising her role as Molly Jensen in Ghost.</p>
<p>The 63-year-old actor has been in quarantine with just his ex after his daughter, Evelyn, stabbed herself with a needle, and Emma and the girls failed to make it to Demi’s home before the stay-in-place orders kicked in.</p>
<p>TikTok 8 Bruce Willis parodied Demi’s role in Ghost</p>
<p>Getty - Contributor 8 Demi Moore played Molly Jensen, opposite the late actor Patrick Swayze</p>
<p>Bruce parodied Demi on Wednesday after he posted a video of himself as a “ghost” while reading a book.</p>
<p>He even tagged his ex-wife in the post after naming the post: “Ghost.”</p>
<p>His funny video garnered him tons of positive reviews from his adoring fans on Instagram.</p>
<p>TikTok 8 Bruce’s rendition got him a lot of praise on social media</p>
<p>instagram.com/buuski 8 Bruce has had fans talking after he was spotted quarantining with Demi Moore and not his current wife, Emma</p>
<p>Just yesterday, Scout Willis – one of Bruce and Demi’s daughters – explained why her parents have been in quarantine together with Emma nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>Instagram 8 Bruce and Emma have two daughters together</p>
<p>Scout revealed: “My stepmom was going to come up here too with my little sisters.”</p>
<p>“[But] my younger sister… [who has] never gotten a talk about not f**cking with hypodermic needles… she found [needles at a park and] she actually tried to poke her shoe with it and poked her foot.”</p>
<p>So, Bruce traveled to Sun Valley, Idaho “early” while Emma stayed back with the two girls “waiting to get the results.”</p>
<p>Instagram 8 Emma had to stay behind after one of their daughters, Evelyn, stabbed herself with a needle she found in the park</p>
<p>But as travel restrictions started to be implemented across the country, it became too difficult for the families to reunite.</p>
<p>Scout added: “Travel got crazy and my stepmom stayed in L.A. with my little sisters.”</p>
<p>Emma has been closely follow the shenanigans of the Willis-Moore crew who seem to be having a great time painting, playing games, and even dressing in matching pajamas while in lockdown.</p>
<p>She commented on a photo of the crew in the matching sets saying: “Not many can pull that color off. Lookin’ good squad!”</p>
<p>Emma also wrote: “At its finest. Love and miss you guys.”</p>

<h3 id="demi-moore-dons-fake-mustache-while-isolating-with-ex-husband-bruce-willis-and-their-three-daughters">Demi Moore dons fake mustache while isolating with ex-husband Bruce Willis and their three daughters</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/20/00/27394954-0-image-a-15_1587337524328.jpg" alt="img">
Demi Moore is keeping her fans entertained under quarantine, while isolating with her ex-husband Bruce Willis and their three adult children in Sun Valley, Idaho.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Update: this is how I’m doing,&rsquo; the 57-year-old actress captioned an Instagram video of herself wearing a fake mustache and a black long sleeve with mushroom graphics on Sunday.</p>
<p>In the funny footage, the Ghost star can be seen nonchalantly eating dinner, as she refers to herself as the family&rsquo;s &lsquo;Saturday night entertainment&rsquo; in a pair of thin angular glasses.</p>
<p>Funny girl: Demi Moore kept her fans entertained with a fake mustache on Sunday, while isolating with her ex-husband Bruce Willis and their three adult children in Sun Valley, Idaho</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wait look over, please,&rsquo; one of her daughters could be overheard saying in the background, while another joked their mom was a &lsquo;dancing monkey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Demi, who shares a tight-knit bond with daughters Rumer, 31, Scout, 28, and Tallulah, 26, appeared in high spirits, as they filmed their latest update amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>After a month of sharing eyebrow-raising snaps in matching pajamas with Demi, an insider explained the Die Hard actor&rsquo;s bizarre decision to remain with his ex and not his current wife Emma Heming or young girls, Mabel, eight, and Evelyn, five.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Update: this is how I’m doing,&rsquo; the 57-year-old actress captioned an Instagram video of herself wearing a fake mustache and a black long sleeve with mushroom graphics on Sunday</p>
<p>The source insisted that Bruce&rsquo;s entire family originally planned to join him until there was an outbreak of the virus in the area, reports ET Online.</p>
<p>The source told the site: &lsquo;He has a house directly across the street from Demi&rsquo;s house in Sun Valley. It&rsquo;s been for sale for years. He was visiting and his family was considering quarantining there. He got stuck because Sun Valley became one of the COVID-19 hotspots.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The actor - who split from Demi in 2000 after 13 years of marriage - is in touch with Emma and their kids &lsquo;daily&rsquo; and none of them are finding the unusual domestic set up particularly &lsquo;weird.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wait look over, please,&rsquo; one of her daughters could be overheard saying in the background, while another joked their mom was a &lsquo;dancing monkey&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bruce and Demi made a decision to quarantine together with their children and have been doing so for over a month,&rsquo; the ET source revealed. &lsquo;The family didn&rsquo;t want to take any risks of outside influences, so they&rsquo;ve stayed away from socializing with anyone but their family.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bruce isn&rsquo;t with his wife or young children, but that was understood going into this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While Bruce and Demi &lsquo;never thought they would be forced at this age to stay in one home together 24/7,&rsquo; they are having a lot of fun with their daughters.</p>
<p>Quarantine buddies: The Die Hard actor raised eyebrows by choosing to stay with his ex and not his current wife Emma Heming or young girls, Mabel, eight, and Evelyn, five amid the coronavirus pandemic</p>
<p>A source describe the set-up as &lsquo;a slumber party&rsquo;, adding Emma is &lsquo;fine&rsquo; with Bruce staying with Demi and their kids.</p>
<p>Insiders have been insisting that &lsquo;everything is great&rsquo; between the action star and wife while he hunkers down with Demi during the pandemic.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Demi and Emma are close, and all three get on great as a big blended family. There are no issues at all. Emma needed to stay in L.A. with the young kids,&rsquo; a source recently told People.</p>
<p>Book club: In a recent post the quarantine group - which also includes two of the daughters boyfriends and Demi&rsquo;s longtime assistant - were all seen reading ⁣How to Rule the World from Your Couch</p>
<p>Family man: The actor - who split from Demi in 2000 after 13 years of marriage - is in touch with Emma and their kids &lsquo;daily&rsquo; and none of them are finding the unusual domestic set up particularly &lsquo;weird&rsquo;</p>
<p>Demi was present for Heming and Willis&rsquo; vow renewal ceremony in March of last year. They returned the favor later that year, supporting Moore at the launch of her memoir Inside Out.</p>
<p>Demi and kids have been documenting the big blended family&rsquo;s life inside on social media.</p>
<p>In a recent post the quarantine group - which also includes two of the daughters boyfriends and Demi&rsquo;s longtime assistant - were all seen reading as Demi captioned the shot: &lsquo;Family book club&hellip; ⁣How to Rule the World from Your Couch — quarantine edition.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Keeping busy: On Emma&rsquo;s Instagram account, she took to Instagram stories to talk about her skincare line, telling fans she was holding back to back Zoom meetings in a bid to launch the brand in the U.S</p>
<p>The group all held a copy of Laura Day&rsquo;s self-help book How To Rule The World From Your Couch - which uses step by step exercises to achieve goals such as career moves and building new or better relationships.</p>
<p>Meanwhile over on Emma&rsquo;s Instagram account, she took to Instagram stories to talk about her skincare line, telling fans she was holding back to back Zoom meetings in a bid to launch the brand in the U.S.</p>
<p>Last month, Emma and Bruce celebrated their 11-year wedding anniversary, having married nearly a decade after his divorce with Demi in 2009.
