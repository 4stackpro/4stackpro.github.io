Today, June 14 Bollywood woke up to the heartbreaking news of Sushant Singh Rajput committing suicide in his Bandra residence where he was found hanging by his house help who later informed the police. Amid the current situation when the country is crippling with coronavirus pandemic, this news is making people hate the year 2020 even more. While the exact cause of him committing suicide is not known, people cannot stop talking about mental health and depression. #MentalHealthMatters is trending all over Twitter with people discussing how important it is to talk to each other and not let difficult times take away the best of you.</p>
<p>People are remembering quotes and dialogues from his last movie Chhichore, which was ironically about his Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s character encouraging his son to fight suicidal thought and teaching him how to accept failure. Netizens are urging, anyone who is dealing with suicidal thoughts, depressive feelings or anxiety must reach out to their loved ones. People must vent out their feelings to not be pushed towards something as scary as suicide. Take a look at some of the #MentalHealthMatters tweets:</p>
<p>If you are feeling stressed, talk to someone. If you are feeling anxious, talk to someone. If you feel like you have symptoms of depression, please talk to someone. Prioritise yourself.

<p>While the current situations may seem gloomy it is important to remember Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s famous dialogue from his last movie Chhichore, &ldquo;Tumhara Result Decide Nahi Karta Hai Ki Tum Loser Ho Ki Nahi &hellip; Tumhari Koshish Decide Karti Hai&rdquo;. Another one of his dialogues from Chhichore that can be used as life quote is &ldquo;Success Ke Baad Ka Plan Sabke Paas Hai &hellip; Lekin Agar Galti Se Fail Ho Gaye &hellip; Toh Failure Se Kaise Deal Karna Hai &hellip; Iski Koi Baat Hi Nahi Karna Chahta.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Actor Rhea Chakraborty shared a very special birthday wish for actor and her thus-far rumoured boyfriend, Sushant Singh Rajput. With her latest post, she is appeared to have made their relationship Insta-offical.</p>
<p>Rhea shared two pictures from their recent secret holiday to wish Sushant. In one photo, they are seen sitting on a bench with bright green grass and tall trees behind them. Rhea has her arm around Sushant’s neck while he is seen looking at her face. The second picture shows them on a boat in front of a cave. In this picture, he is seen leaning on her while she wraps him in her arms.</p>
<p>“Happy birthday to the most beautiful supermassive black hole that is known to mankind! Shine on you crazy diamond @sushantsinghrajput #boywithagoldenheart #rheality,” she captioned the post. Sushant replied, “Thank youuuuuuu my Rockstarrrr.”</p>
<p>Sushant had also recently shared a picture of Rhea on Instagram, calling her ‘my jalebi’. Rumours about their relationship began in May last year. However, they never confirmed the reports but their frequent dates and holidays seem to hint that they are a couple.</p>

<p>Sushant was in a long relationship with Manikarnika actor Ankita Lokhande for many years. They started dating when they worked together on TV soap Pavitra Rishta. They broke up in 2016.</p>
<p>When asked in an interview if he was seeing someone, Sushant recently said, “I’m seeing many. Oh, you mean it as a metaphor? I’m not allowed to say. It’s not that someone else is saying that I’m not allowed to say it. I cannot allow myself to say anything.”</p>
<p>He also said he needs to ask “that somebody” if he can talk about it: “If you ask me any question that has to do with me, I can say it. If I was seeing somebody, I’d have to ask that somebody. Probably your question, if well-founded, will help me insinuate it to the other person to know what to say next time. And probably when you put me on the cover next time, I’ll say it.”</p>
<p>Sushant was last seen opposite Jacqueline Fernandez in Netflix’s Drive, while Rhea was seen in the romantic drama Jalebi, which released in 2018.</p>
