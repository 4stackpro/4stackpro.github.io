<p>Highlights Dulquer Salmaan opened up about his wife Amal</p>
<p>He revealed how he approached her for the first time</p>
<p>The couple welcomed daughter Maryam in May 2017</p>
<p>Did you know that Dulquer Salmaan and his wife Amal&rsquo;s marriage is &ldquo;love-cum-arranged&rdquo;? The actor, in a recent interview with Deccan Chronicle, revealed how he met his wife for the first time and how their families agreed for their marriage. The actor said: &ldquo;After I returned from the US where I was finishing my studies, my folks were keen on getting me married. My friends and family suggested the name of one of my schoolmates who was five years my junior. My friends started matching her bio-data with mine. Now, it so happened that on most of my outings, I would notice the same girl there as well. Or at times when I decided to watch a movie, surprisingly, she would also be there watching that same movie and the same show. Since I was bumping into her often unknowingly, I somehow felt it could be some celestial sign that I should get married to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dulquer added that when he gathered the courage to approach Amal, he invited her on a coffee date. &ldquo;I informed my parents about this girl. Both the families met and connected immediately. So I can say it is a love-cum-arranged marriage,&rdquo; said the actor, adding: &ldquo;We have a two-and-a-half-year-old daughter who is very talkative. She entertains the entire family throughout the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dulquer Salmaan and Amal got married in a private ceremony in Chennai in 2011. They welcomed daughter Maryam in May 2017.</p>
<p>In the same interview, Dulquer also spoke about his wife&rsquo;s reaction to all the female attention he gets on social media. When asked if Amal feels insecure about his female fan following, the actor told the publication: &ldquo;No, not at all. Sometimes I also tell her to comment for me, but it&rsquo;s like ghar ki murgi dal barabar. However, my wife is very secure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the work front, Dulquer Salmaan was last seen in Tamil film Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal. He has featured in a number of Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam films like Pattam Pole, Samsaaram Aarogyathinu Haanikaram, Vikramadithyan, Nadigaiyar Thilagam, CIA (Comrade In America) and Varane Avashyamund among others. He made his debut in Bollywood with Abhishek Sharma&rsquo;s The Zoya Factor, in which he co-starred with Sonam Kapoor.

Dulquer Salmaan and his wife Amal Sufiya are known as the cute couple in Mollywood. Recently, in an interview, the actor opened up about falling in love with Amal Sufiya.</p>
<p>“We had a love marriage with the blessings of our family. When I returned home after completing my studies in US, my family and friends started to search for a perfect life partner for me. One day, they told me about a girl who was five years junior to me at my school. My friends cross-checked our biodata to find similarities between us,” Dulquer recollected memories.</p>
<p>“Rest of the story is really interesting. I used to meet the same girl wherever I go. When I went to watch a</p>
<p>movie, she was there. And I started to feel a crush for her. Slowly, I started to feel something special for her and I decided she will be my life partner,” Dulquer revealed.</p>
<p>“One day, I vowed to express my feelings to her and invited her for a coffee. Later, everything turned positive for our marriage. When I informed my family about my wish to marry Amal, both families decided to proceed with our wedding. Now, we have a two and half-year-old talkative daughter,&rdquo; said Dulquer.</p>
<p>The actor also revealed that his wife never feels insecure over the huge number of female fans on social media.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, I ask Amal to respond for some comments on my social media pages,” said Dulquer. Dulquer and Amal entered wedlock On December 22, 2011.</p>
<p>Amal, a Chennai native, is an architect. Dulquer made his acting debut in 2012 after his marriage. The couple were blessed with a baby girl Mariyam Ameerah Salmaan on May 5, 2017.
