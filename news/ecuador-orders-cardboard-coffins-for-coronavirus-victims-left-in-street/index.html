<p>Ecuador is rush-ordering thousands of cardboard coffins to try to cope with coronavirus victims otherwise left rotting in the street, officials say.</p>
<p>The nation’s second city, Guayaquil, has started getting a donation of 2,000 pressed cardboard caskets from local producers — and is ordering even more to help overwhelmed local cemeteries, Agence France-Presse says.</p>
<p>The port city of more than 2 million is also getting refrigerated trailers to help store the dead currently overwhelming city hospitals — with Ecuador’s president, Lenin Moreno, also planning a “special camp” to bury the 3,500 he fears could die in the pandemic, AFP says.</p>
<p>It follows disturbing images of bodies left lying in the street, as well as troubling reports of residents trapped in homes for days with the corpses of their loved ones.</p>
<p>“It’s so they can meet demand,” a city hall spokesman told AFP of the cardboard coffins. “There are either no coffins in the city or they are extremely expensive.”</p>
<p>While only cardboard, they “will be a great help in providing a dignified burial for people who died during this health emergency,” the Guayaquil mayor’s office wrote on Twitter. A phone number was listed for people who needed corpses removed from their homes.</p>
<p>Even Guayaquil’s mayor, Mayor Cynthia Viteri, is among those infected. Viteri — one of those who angrily attacked the government for corpses left in the street — has ordered refrigerated containers at public hospitals to preserve bodies until graves were prepared.</p>
<p>Ecuador — the worst-hit nation in Latin America — had recorded 180 deaths from the contagion and 3,646 confirmed infections as of Monday morning, according to Johns Hopkins University data.</p>
<p>But President Moreno admits the real death toll is far higher — saying authorities were collecting more than 100 bodies a day. “The reality always exceeds the number of tests and the speed with which we can act,” Moreno has said in televised comments. “We’re building a special camp for the fallen,” he said.</p>

<h3 id="covid-19-ecuador-stores-coronavirus-victims-in-giant-fridges-as-morgues-fill-up">COVID-19: Ecuador stores coronavirus victims in giant fridges as morgues fill up</h3>
<p><img src="https://nationalpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/hospital-1.jpg" alt="img">
Ecuador’s government has begun storing the bodies of victims of the coronavirus in giant refrigerated containers as hundreds of deaths in the city of Guayaquil, the center of the country’s outbreak, have already filled morgues and hospitals.</p>
<p>Ecuador has confirmed 318 deaths from the virus, one of the highest tallies in Latin America. But President Lenin Moreno said this week that the real figure was higher as authorities were collecting more than 100 bodies a day, many from relatives’ homes as a strict quarantine prevented them from being buried.</p>
<p>The government has installed three containers, the largest about 12 meters (40 ft) long, at public hospitals to preserve bodies until graves were prepared, according to Guayaquil’s mayor, Cynthia Viteri. So far 150 victims have been buried in a private cemetery in the port city.</p>
<p>At Guayaquil’s Teodoro Maldonado Carbo hospital on Saturday, medical workers wearing protective gear removed bodies wrapped in plastic from a storage room and used a pallet to wheel them to one container, according to a Reuters photographer.</p>
<p>“This pandemic is overcoming the capacity of our hospital services,” the hospital said in a statement on Friday.</p>
<p>The hospital on Sunday confirmed that it had set up a refrigerated container to hold the bodies of those who died amid the pandemic, adding that the arrangement was being operated in accordance with World Health Organization protocols.</p>
<p>The Ecuadorean Institute of Social Security, which runs Teodoro Maldonado Carbo, said on Saturday on Twitter that it had disinfected all areas of the hospital to guarantee the safety of patients and medical professionals.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Ecuador’s government said it would activate a new digital system that would allow families to find out where their dead relatives were buried.</p>
<p>Moreno said the government expected the total number of deaths in Guayaquil’s surrounding province to reach up to 3,500, and said a “special camp” was being built to bury the dead.

<h3 id="the-churchs-response-to-covid-19-in-ecuador">The Church’s response to Covid-19 in Ecuador</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.vaticannews.va/content/dam/vaticannews/agenzie/images/afp/2020/04/03/19/1585933950817.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.cropped.1500.844.jpeg" alt="img">
A Comboni missionary in Ecuador describes how the coronavirus emergency is overwhelming society in Guayaquil. The dead accumulate in the streets, people are hungry, and it is impossible to maintain quarantine in the poorest areas.</p>
<p>By Vatican News</p>
<p>Father José Barranco is a Comboni missionary based in Ecuador, the Latin American nation most affected by the coronavirus. Speaking to Vatican News, he describes the situation in Guayaquil, a port city of 2.3 million inhabitants, and home to almost half of the 2,700 positive cases of Covid-19 in the country.</p>
<p>The situation throughout Ecuador is very difficult, he says, “but in Guayaquil it is catastrophic”.</p>
<p>Double emergency</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic has triggered a double health emergency in Ecuador: firstly, because the health system has collapsed, and secondly because the bodies of the dead are accumulating in houses and streets, waiting to be taken to the cemetery.</p>
<p>Ecuador’s President, Lenin Moreno, has confirmed that around 150 bodies are collected daily from homes and public spaces. But this is not enough. Morgues are full and many funeral homes refuse to provide mortuary services for fear of contagion.</p>
<p>Not enough</p>
<p>The health system can&rsquo;t cope because medical equipment and staff are lacking. Doctors and nurses are working up to 16 hours a day, doing double shifts.</p>
<p>The extent of the epidemic is partly due to the population not adhering to government instructions to stay at home, says Fr Barranco. But in the vast poverty-stricken areas of Guayaquil it is difficult to impose quarantine. A house is often just one room, he says, “where three, four or even five people live together, and there is little food. What are they supposed to do?”.</p>
<p>Everyone is trying to respond as best they can, says Fr Barranco. But whatever the government, the Church, or medical personnel try to do in this situation, “is not enough”.</p>
<p>The Church’s response</p>
<p>Fr Barranco says the Catholic Church is offering both physical and spiritual support to those in need. He gives the example of a hospital run by the Guayaquil Archdiocese. The structure does not have the capacity to assist Covid-19 sufferers, but it does admit patients with other pathologies.</p>
<p>This helps alleviate some of the pressure from the public health care system. The same hospital is also providing medical advice through a telephone service.</p>
<p>Faith and hope</p>
<p>Local Catholic parishes are working with the government on its &ldquo;Together we feed more people&rdquo; program. They act as collection and distribution points for food rations which are vital at this time, as many people are suffering from hunger.</p>
<p>Fr Barranco is also Director of the National Catholic Radio in the capital city of Quito. He says these same parishes are providing liturgies and moments of prayer through the media. All of these gestures, he concludes, aim to &ldquo;sow faith and hope&rdquo;.
