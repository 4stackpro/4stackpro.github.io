New Zealanders enjoyed another hour of sleep - and in lockdown - today when clocks went back one hour.</p>
<p>New Zealand Daylight Saving ended at 3am Sunday, and clocks went back to 2am.</p>
<p>As well as changing clocks, the end of Daylight Saving is a good opportunity to check household emergency plans, survival items and home smoke alarms.</p>
<p>Daylight Saving runs from the last Sunday in September to the first Sunday in April. Daylight Saving will begin again on September 27.</p>

<p>â€¢ Full background on Daylight Saving in New Zealand can be found on the New Zealand Government website.

<h3 id="change-your-clocks-this-weekend---daylight-saving-ends">Change your clocks this weekend - daylight saving ends</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/eopX7Uv3cAl5RdREyrRNT5w0gQY=/1200x0/smart/filters:quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-syd-prod-nzme.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SGKVDPUAPJDOLMIYVALSUKZPS4.jpg" alt="img">
This weekend is the end of daylight saving in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Clocks go backwards one hour at 3am Sunday morning - so best to do it before you go to bed on Saturday night. Of course, nowadays, many of our timepieces are electronic and will do this automatically, but those of us who are still a little bit old school, then don&rsquo;t forget to wind that watch or clock backwards.</p>
<p>While most people know the saying &ldquo;spring forwards, fall backwards&rdquo;, not so many people know the concept of daylight saving was first thought up by a New Zealander who loved bugs.</p>
<p>In 1895, George Hudson, an amateur entomologist who worked for the Wellington Post Office, wanted more time to collect his beloved bugs after work in the evenings. He suggested a two-hour shift to increase the time he could give his sunshine-fuelled hobby, but his suggestion was largely ignored at the time.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The next person to suggest it was Englishman William Willett, a builder and the great-grandfather of Chris Martin of Coldplay fame.</p>
<p>He came up with the idea in 1902, suggesting it to the English Parliament as a way to prevent people &ldquo;wasting daylight&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He suggested moving clocks backwards by 20 minutes every Sunday in September. Despite having the support of author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as well as Winston Churchill, his idea was rejected by the government of the time.</p>
<p>It was the Germans and Austrians who finally introduced daylight saving in 1916, but it wasn&rsquo;t to stop people wasting daylight or to increase bug collections then.</p>
<p>It was introduced by the two nationalities to save candles and coal power, extending the working day as part of their war effort. They had the idea from Willett&rsquo;s much publicised campaigning in England and made it a reality.</p>
<p>Soon after, Britain, America and other countries involved in World War I followed suit, and in the United States daylight saving was originally known as &ldquo;war-time&rdquo; as a result.</p>
<p>Daylight saving was then finally introduced in New Zealand in 1927, 32 years after Hudson first suggested it.</p>
<p>So this weekend, when you get a whole extra hour in bed on Sunday morning, just remember, it is all thanks to a bug obsessed New Zealander.

<h3 id="covid-19-coronavirus-nz-outdoors-party-criticises-lockdown-rules">Covid 19 coronavirus: NZ Outdoors Party criticises lockdown rules</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/3lnOi7BM2OSwUasK_UBERbhdhW4=/1200x0/smart/filters:quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-syd-prod-nzme.s3.amazonaws.com/public/C7CMN57GNBHSTOB2CUNBZJ6BCU.jpg" alt="img">
Pandemic rules designed to save Kiwi lives which ban surfing, swimming and hunting during the lockdown have been labelled &ldquo;cruel and unreasonable&rdquo; by a fringe political party.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health issued a Health Notice yesterday which clarified that recreation and exercise on alert level four lockdown should not include swimming, water-based activities, hunting, tramping, or other activities that could expose participants to danger or may require search and rescue services.</p>
<p>New Zealanders had previously been advised not to take part in these activities during the Covid-19 lockdown but the ban was made official in fresh laws released by the ministry.</p>
<p>NZ Outdoors Party co-leader Alan Simmons today labelled the rules &ldquo;cruel and unreasonable&rdquo; and said they undermined trust in the government.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>His comments have been called &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo; by the New Zealand Deerstalkers Association, which has advised its members to obey the rules and stay away from potential danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot keep up with the calls and messages from New Zealanders who are extremely stressed, distressed and frustrated by dramatic changes imposed on our Kiwi lifestyle,&rdquo; said Simmons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many are in tears and shell-shocked. People use fishing, walking in the hills, boating and other outdoors activities to relax and let off steam.</p>
<p>â€Œ</p>
<p>&ldquo;With so much uncertainty about health, jobs and our future, it is cruel and unreasonable to ban favourite activities and coop people up inside their homes. We have already received information about domestic violence, alcohol abuse and a suicide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to neighbours &ldquo;dobbing in&rdquo; people who were breaking the rules, saying it was &ldquo;not the New Zealand way&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are starting to understand how the Nazi Party was so successful implementing their agenda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The government must pull back urgently and relax restrictions that are not necessary or which are disproportionate to any threat.&rdquo; Alan added.</p>
<p>Co-leader Sue Grey said the government&rsquo;s action was &ldquo;increasingly draconian&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s break out of the fear and cotton wool mentality where we are locked inside buildings like frightened mice, and let&rsquo;s rediscover our Kiwi spirit,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life is never going to be no risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>NZ Deerstalkers Association president Trevor Chappell said the comments were &ldquo;inappropriate at this time&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He said his group was &ldquo;opposed&rdquo; to the NZ Outdoor Party&rsquo;s view, and that they had informed their members they should be following the government&rsquo;s rules on staying home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If everybody plays their part and stays home we should be able to get through this Covid-19 outbreak and our members will be able to get out hunting again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chappell said nobody wanted to put emergency service workers at risk by putting themselves in potential danger.</p>
<p>Police have already started handing out tickets for people ignoring the rules.</p>
<p>This morning police - who have been monitoring surf cameras to detect rule-breakers - turned up at Piha Beach, where about six people were in the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They just went straight down to the beach and called the surfers in,&rdquo; said a Herald photographer at the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they gave them tickets. Another guy was just drying down in the carpark and he got a ticket too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Ministry of Health spokeswoman said the current position and reasons for level four are outlined on the government&rsquo;s Covid-19 website.</p>
