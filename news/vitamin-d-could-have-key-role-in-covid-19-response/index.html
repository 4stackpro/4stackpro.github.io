Vitamin D could have key role in COVID-19 response Can help prevent respiratory infections</p>
<p>Apr 03, 2020</p>
<p>Deborah Condon</p>
<p>Deborah Condon</p>
<p>New Irish research has highlighted the key role vitamin D plays in preventing respiratory infections, which could have important implications for the fight against COVID-19 (coronavirus).</p>
<p>A new report has been published by the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) at Trinity College Dublin (TCD). Meanwhile, researchers from Technological University Dublin (TU Dublin) and TCD have also published an article on this topic in the Irish Medical Journal (IMJ).</p>
<p>TILDA is an ongoing study of people over the age of 50 in Ireland. According to its report, Vitamin D Deficiency in Ireland - Implications for COVID 19, vitamin D plays an essential role in preventing respiratory infections, reducing antibiotic use, and boosting the immune system&rsquo;s response to infections.</p>
<p>However, an estimated 27% of Irish adults who are over the age of 70 and are currently cocooning as part of the COVID-19 response, are deficient in this key vitamin.</p>
<p>Vitamin D is known as the sunshine vitamin because it is produced in the skin by exposing the body to just 10-15 minutes per day of sunshine. In Ireland, vitamin D can only be produced in the skin between late March and late September. It cannot be produced in winter.</p>
<p>Even in summer, getting a sufficient amount of Vitamin D can pose a challenge, due to things like cloud cover, rainy weather and a lack of sunshine.</p>
<p>However, people can ensure they are not deficient by consuming an adequate amount of vitamin D-rich foods and by supplementation. Vitamin D is readily found in foods like eggs, liver and oily fish, such as salmon and mackerel, as well as fortified foods such as cereals and dairy products. Supplements do not require a prescription.</p>
<p>The TILDA report revealed that an estimated 27% of adults over the age of 70, who are currently cocooning, are deficient in the vitamin, while 47% of all adults over the age of 85 are deficient in winter.</p>
<p>A further one in eight adults over the age of 50 are deficient all year round, yet just 15% of women and 4% of men take a vitamin D supplement.</p>
<p>People most at risk of vitamin D deficiency are those who get little sun exposure and/or eat inadequate amounts of fortified foods, particularly those who are currently housebound or confined to their homes. Other high-risk groups include people with asthma or other chronic lung diseases, and obese or physically inactive people.</p>
<p>The TILDA researchers recommend that all adults over the age of 50 should take vitamin D supplements all year round if they do not get enough sun. Those who are cocooning should also take supplements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have evidence to support a role for vitamin D in the prevention of chest infections, particularly in older adults who have low levels. In one study, vitamin D reduced the risk of chest infections to half in people who took supplements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though we do not know specifically the role of Vitamin D in COVID infections, given its wider implications for improving immune responses, and clear evidence for bone and muscle health, those cocooning and other at-risk cohorts should ensure they have an adequate intake of Vitamin D,&rdquo; insisted TILDA principal investigator, Prof Rose Anne Kenny.</p>
<p>She also noted that while cocooning is a necessity at this time, it will reduce physical activity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Muscle deconditioning occurs rapidly in these circumstances and vitamin D will help to maintain muscle health and strength in the current crisis,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>According to the report&rsquo;s co-author, Dr Eamon Laird, a research fellow in medical gerontology, these findings clearly show that Vitamin D deficiency is common, &ldquo;which could have a significant negative impact on people&rsquo;s immune response to infection&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is an even larger risk now of deficiency with those cocooning or confined indoors. However, vitamin D deficiency is not inevitable. Eating foods such as oily fish, eggs, vitamin D-fortified cereals or dairy products, and a daily 400 IU (10ug) vitamin D supplement, can help avoid deficiency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, Ireland needs a formal vitamin D food policy/recommendation, which we are still lacking. For instance, Finland has such a policy and has virtually eliminated deficiency in its population,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the article in the IMJ by researchers at TU Dublin and TCD also highlights that vitamin D supplements may enhance resistance to respiratory infections, such as COVID-19. It may also limit the severity of the illness for those who become infected.</p>
<p>However, according to the article&rsquo;s co-author, Dr Daniel McCartney, a lecturer in human nutrition and dietetics at TU Dublin, vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in Ireland, especially in older people, nursing home residents and hospital inpatients, &ldquo;and may significantly increase the risk and severity of viral respiratory infections, including Covid-19&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supplementing a healthy diet with 20-50 micrograms per day of vitamin D represents a cheap, safe and potentially very effective protection for Irish adults against Covid-19,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>According to the study&rsquo;s co-author, Dr Declan Byrne, a clinical senior lecturer at St James&rsquo;s Hospital and TCD&rsquo;s School of Medicine, such recommendations on vitamin D supplementation are important &ldquo;while we await development of a vaccine and trial evidence of effective drug treatment for Covid-19&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our findings call for the immediate supplementation of all hospital inpatients, nursing home residents and older Irish adults with vitamin D. Our findings also suggest that vitamin D supplementation in the broader adult population, and particularly in frontline healthcare workers, may further help to limit infection and flatten the Covid-19 curve,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>The researchers added that supplementation at the recommended 20-50 micrograms of vitamin D per day is a short-term measure to specifically address the risk of Covid-19 infection over the coming three to six months. It is advised that those who intend to supplement at doses above 20 micrograms per day after this period, should do so only under the supervision of a doctor.</p>

<p>Vitamin D, the “Sunshine Vitamin”, is a powerhouse nutrient. It supports a healthy immune system and studies show it may reduce the risk of respiratory infection and other viruses such as influenza. Because our bodies naturally convert sunlight to vitamin D, the primary cause of vitamin D deficiency is underexposure to sunshine. The National Institute of Health recommends getting approximately 600-800 IU (International Units) of vitamin D per day, whether it’s from sunlight, vitamin D rich foods or supplements. Here are the best ones to add to your diet.</p>

<p>Fatty fish and seafood</p>
<p>Fatty fish and seafood are some of the richest natural food sources of Vitamin D and heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
<p>One 3.5 oz (100 g) serving of canned salmon can provide 386 IU of vitamin D, about 50% of the recommended daily intake.</p>
<p>Other fish/seafood rich in vitamin D include tuna, mackerel, oysters, shrimps, sardines, and anchovies.</p>

<p>Mushrooms</p>
<p>Mushrooms exposed to sunlight or UV are a great natural, plant-based source of vitamin D.</p>
<p>Mushrooms make their own vitamin D after being exposed to UV light, so some wild mushrooms will have a higher vitamin D content.</p>
<p>Wild Maitake mushrooms may provide as much as 2,348 IU per 3.5 oz (100 g) serving.</p>

<p>Egg yolks</p>
<p>Egg yolks are vitamin D rich and easy to add to your diet, although like other natural food sources, they vary in vitamin D content.</p>
<p>Conventionally raised chickens that don’t have access to the outdoors typically only produce eggs harboring 2–5% of the recommended daily intake. Some research indicates that eggs from pasture-raised or free-range chickens offer up to 4 times more — or up to 120-160 IU (20% of the recommended daily intake).</p>
<p>Fortified foods</p>
<p>Because there are only a limited number of natural sources of vitamin D, fortified foods are a good option, especially for those who might be vegan or vegetarian. These include: Dairy milk: 115–130 IU per cup (237 ml) Soy milk: 107–117 IU per cup Orange juice: 100 IU per cup Cereals: 54–136 IU per half cup (78 g) Yogurt: 127 IU per cup Tofu: 100 IU for 3.5 oz (100 g)</p>
<p>Vitamin D supplements</p>
<p>If your vitamin D levels are low and you want a quick and easy way to boost them, supplements may be a good option for you.</p>
<p>Vitamin D has two forms — D2 and D3. D2 typically comes from plants and D3 from animals.</p>
<p>Aim for supplement dosages around 1,000-4,000 IU.</p>
<p>Even if you’re adding some of these to your diet, it’s important to try and soak up some sun at least once a day, either in your backyard or on a daily walk, and remember to protect your skin from UV ray and free radical damage with SPF and vitamin C serum. Vitamin D will help your body keep its energy levels up, build strong bones, and even fight disease.

<h3 id="vitamin-d-may-help-seniors-recover-after-hip-fracture-study-says">Vitamin D may help seniors recover after hip fracture, study says</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/2251585887775/2020/upi_com/9bfc03b9894f4a0927e758f9b86af151/v1.5/Vitamin-D-may-help-seniors-recover-after-hip-fracture-study-says.jpg?lg=2" alt="img">
After a broken hip, seniors who have sufficient vitamin D have better odds of walking, a new study finds.</p>
<p>The study suggests that low levels of vitamin D could limit walking, according to researcher Sue Shapses, a professor of nutritional sciences at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J.</p>
<p>Nearly 300 patients undergoing hip fracture repair were assessed after surgery in terms of mobility and vitamin D levels. Those with higher vitamin D levels had higher rates of walking 30 days after surgery, according to the study.</p>
<p>Poorer nutritional status was associated with lower levels of mobility. But there was no connection between vitamin D levels and death rates. The study only found associations between vitamin D and mobility, and could not prove cause and effect. Shapses recommends older adults take 800 international units (IU) of vitamin D daily to prevent deficiency.</p>
<p>RELATED Ambient air pollution linked to bone mass loss in adults</p>
<p>Vitamin D is important for bone health. Vitamin D is in such foods as dairy products, fortified cereals and juices, dark, leafy greens and fatty fish. It&rsquo;s also in vitamin pills. The body also makes vitamin D when you are exposed to sunlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An important next step is learning how vitamin D affects mobility,&rdquo; Shapses said in a Rutgers news release. &ldquo;For example, it is not clear if severe vitamin D deficiency is associated with direct effects on muscle, cognition or other organ systems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A broken hip is among the most serious fall injuries and is hard to recover from. Many people are unable to live on their own afterward.</p>
<p>More than 300,000 American seniors are hospitalized for broken hips each year and falls cause more than 95 percent of these fractures, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>The report was recently published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.</p>
