<p>BORIS Johnson put the UK on lockdown with drastic measures on March 23 in the fight against the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>Stand-in PM Dominic Raab is set to announce on Thursday, April 16, that the country&rsquo;s restrictions will stay in place until at least May 7.</p>
<p>⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news &amp; updates</p>
<p>1 Lockdown measures have been in place since March 23 Credit: EPA</p>
<p>When is lockdown being reviewed?</p>
<p>The Government have said Boris Johnson&rsquo;s lockdown measures, which were introduced on March 23, would be reviewed after three weeks, and relaxed if the evidence showed this was possible.</p>
<p>This means the first review of the coronavirus lockdown measures has to be carried out by April 16 at the latest.</p>
<p>Ministers will agree on whether lockdown should be extended, phased out, or if there should be even harsher restrictions in the UK.</p>
<p>However, at the Government briefing on April 9, Dominic Raab said the lockdown rules will &ldquo;have to stay in place until we&rsquo;ve got the evidence that clearly shows we&rsquo;ve moved beyond the peak&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He said: “It’s been almost three weeks and we’re starting to see the impact of the sacrifices we’ve all made. But the deaths are still rising and we haven’t yet reached the peak of the virus. So it’s still too early to lift the measures that we put in place.” Mr Raab said on April 13, the UK was “still not past the peak of this virus” as he warned of a “long way to go” in the battle against Covid-19. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance also braced the nation for a “difficult” week of death figures ahead before they expect the fatality rate to begin to slow. But he said that plateau in coronavirus deaths is likely to last for two to three weeks before we see a fall. Mr Raab is set to ask Scotland&rsquo;s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and leaders from Wales and Northern Ireland to attend a Cobra meeting to ensure there is a UK-wide agreement on the lockdown. But senior ministers are split on whether to encourage some people who cannot work from home to return to their places of employment.</p>
<p>The UK has not imposed as many restrictions as other European countries</p>
<p>What are the current restrictions?</p>
<p>The PM has ordered people only to leave their homes under a list of &ldquo;very limited purposes&rdquo;, banned public gatherings of more than two people and ordered the closure of non-essential shops.</p>
<p>Parks have remained open, but gyms including outdoor gyms, play-parks and kiosks have closed, as will all places of worship except for funerals.</p>
<p>All Brits must comply with these measures.</p>
<p>The police have been given the powers to enforce them through fines and dispersing gatherings.</p>

<p>Cops can issue on-the-spot fines of £60 for meeting without good reason.</p>
<p>The fine can be halved to £30 if paid swiftly and repeat offenders will be hit by a doubling of the fine each time.</p>
<p>Brits have not had as many restrictions enforced upon them as many other European countries.</p>
<p>Citizens required special permits to be allowed to leave their houses in Spain, France, Italy, and Germany, although some of these restrictions were lifted in Italy and Spain after the Easter holiday..</p>
<p>The British Government has warned stricter measures could be introduced if the UK does not abide by the guidance.</p>
<p>When did lockdown start?</p>
<p>On 23 March, 2020, Boris Johnson announced a partial, three-week-long lockdown, telling Brits to stay at home to stop the spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p>Ministers are split over whether to lift restrictions in either three or six weeks time.</p>
<p>Give now to The Sun&rsquo;s NHS appeal BRITAIN’s four million NHS staff are on the frontline in the battle against coronavirus. But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them? The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £1MILLION for NHS workers. The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need. We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid-19 Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it. The Sun is donating £50,000 and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM. No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/whocareswinsappeal">www.thesun.co.uk/whocareswinsappeal</a></p>
<p>A Cabinet source said: &ldquo;It’s right and proper that we took action. But we must phase it out at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could lead to many more deaths than the virus itself as the economy tanks, people lose jobs and families get poorer and sicker. We need a game plan for ending this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One key Government doctor has said some measures may be in place for up to six months.</p>
<p>It is currently unclear whether Boris Johnson will be taking part in the review before April 16 as he recovers from coronavirus at Chequers.

<h3 id="uk-coronavirus-sunak-warns-of-unprecedented-challenge-as-questions-persist-over-economy-and-care-homes--as-it-happened">UK coronavirus: Sunak warns of &lsquo;unprecedented challenge&rsquo; as questions persist over economy and care homes – as it happened</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f534b7fa1c6d10b38b1d4822b79e56cf9523d31/0_492_5485_3292/master/5485.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=65be4483e87967072c7d6bcad8d1518a" alt="img">

<p>Of all the ministers who have been given the opportunity to appear at the government’s daily coronavirus press conference, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has probably made the best impression. Of course being able to announce almost limitless government spending does help a lot, but he is less evasive than most of his colleagues and generally does a better job than the rest of them at sounding positive yet not deluded.</p>
<p>He managed it again today, even though some of his assumptions are verging on the heroic. The OBR does broadly back his claim that the economy will be able to recover quickly. But his suggestion that Boris Johnson’s open-chequebook “levelling up” agenda will be able to survive intact after the national debt has risen much higher seems optimistic, to put it politely. And perhaps his boldest claim is that this is no inherent tension between safeguarding the economy and protecting lives. That argument might look robust now, but it is likely to appear more tenuous in the months to come.</p>
<p>Here are the main points.</p>
<p>Sunak insisted that the UK economy would be able to recover “quickly and strongly” after the coronavirus crisis was over. He made the claim in response to a report from the Office for Budget Responsibility suggesting a three-month lockdown, followed by three more months of partial lockdown measures, could shrink GDP by 35% and put unemployment up by more than 2m. Sunak insisted that this was not a firm forecast, but he accepted that the economic impact of the crisis would be significant. However, he claimed recovery could come very quickly. He said:</p>
<p>This is going to be hard, our economy’s going to take a significant hit and as I’ve said before that’s not an abstract thing, people are going to feel that in their jobs and in their household incomes &hellip; Yes it will be difficult in the short term. I’m happy to be honest about that with people. I think the measures we’ve put in place will help and then as we get through this it will mean that we can recover quickly and strongly and get our lives and economy back to normal.</p>
<p>Improbable as this claim may seem, it is in line with the OBR analysis, which envisages that says that “real GDP falls 35% in the second quarter, but bounces back quickly”.</p>
<p>Sunak rejected suggestions that the coronavirus crisis, and the enormous increase in government borrowing and debt that it will generate, would prevent the government from pursuing its “levelling up” agenda (which prioritises infrastructure spending, particularly in the north). When this suggestion was put to him, he replied:</p>
<p>Once we get through this obviously we will have to take stock of public finances and the economy and make the right decisions at that point and I’ve talked before about doing whatever we need to to right the ship at that point. But what I would say is we remain very committed to the agenda that we set out before which was about levelling up and spreading opportunity around this country, and indeed I believe this can still be a critical part of how we get back to normal here.</p>
<p>He rejected claims that there was an inherent contradiction between protecting the economy and saving lives. In his opening remarks he said:</p>
<p>The third point I want to make is this: right now, the single most important thing we can do for the health of our economy is to protect the health of our people. It’s not a case of choosing between the economy and public health – common sense tells us that doing so would be self-defeating. At a time when we are seeing hundreds of people dying every day from this terrible disease, the absolute priority must be to focus all of our resources … … not just of the state, but of businesses, and of all of you at home as well, in a collective national effort to beat this virus.</p>
<p>He refused to back a call for the government to scrap the pensions “triple lock” as a result of the crisis, to free up money to help young workers who are particularly likely to be disadvantaged. The Social Market Foundation, a centrist thinktank, has proposed this idea. Asked if he agreed, Sunak said he would not write his budget now. But he said he wanted to provide opportunity for people, whatever age they were.</p>
<p>He said the government was working with the ONS to speed up the publication of information about the deaths of people with coronavirus in care homes.</p>
<p>He said that the coronavirus job retention scheme is due to open on 20 April.</p>
<p>He said he would consider making some of the coronavirus business loans 100% guaranteed by the government, not just 80% guaranteed. George Osborne, a former Tory chancellor, has proposed this idea. (See 5.40pm.)

The UK government is considering winding back its national coronavirus lockdown as early as May, with some shops and schools able to reopen.</p>
<p>Senior members of Prime Minister Boris Johnson&rsquo;s government are pushing for the lockdown to end as soon as possible amid growing fears of an extreme economic downturn, The Times of London reports.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a point where there just isn&rsquo;t anything to come back to,&rdquo; one government source told the paper.</p>
<p>The government on Thursday is expected to announce a three-week extension to the national lockdown measures.</p>
<p>Visit Business Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>The UK could begin to wind back its coronavirus lockdown measures as early as May amid growing government fears about the severe economic impact of current restrictions.</p>
<p>Dominic Raab, who is deputizing while Prime Minister Boris Johnson continues his recovery from COVID-19, indicated on Tuesday that the government would extend the lockdown until May, saying it was &ldquo;far too early&rdquo; to relax current measures.</p>
<p>Government ministers are pushing for parts of the UK economy to be restored as soon as possible, however, amid concern that an extended lockdown could inflict catastrophic long-term damage on the economy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a point where there just isn&rsquo;t anything to come back to,&rdquo; one government source told the Times of London newspaper.</p>
<p>The source added: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to give businesses some idea that they will be trading by midsummer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under plans being considered by ministers, the UK government could allow some shops designated as nonessential to reopen or allow a broader reopening of places where social distancing is capable of being maintained.</p>
<p>Ministers are also considering plans to restart the manufacturing and construction industries.</p>
<p>Schools could also be reopened, though ministers have doubts about whether many parents would be willing to let their children return to school.</p>
<p>Some members of the government fear the UK public could be particularly resistant to any attempt to lift the lockdown.</p>
<p>International polling by Kekst CNC found that 74% of British people prioritized tackling the infection even if it meant extra costs to the economy, compared with 61% of people in the US and 54% in Germany and Sweden, The Times reported.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could open every sports stadium in the country, but I&rsquo;m not sure you&rsquo;d get many takers,&rdquo; one senior minister told the paper.</p>
<p>The decision comes as the UK&rsquo;s official COVID-19 death toll rose to 11,329 as of Sunday evening, according to the Department of Health.</p>
<p>European countries start to ease the coronavirus lockdown</p>
<p>People keeping apart while waiting to enter a supermarket in Madrid on Tuesday. Reuters Some European countries have started to relax their strict lockdown measures amid concerns about the economic impact of shuttering businesses for too long.</p>
<p>In Spain, where almost 17,500 people have died after being infected with the coronavirus, people in manufacturing, construction, and some who work in the services industry are being allowed to return to work, the BBC reported.</p>
<p>In Italy, which with more than 20,000 COVID-19 deaths has been the hardest-hit country in Europe, a few businesses will be able to restart operations Tuesday.</p>
<p>Raab emphasized on Monday that the government would try to avoid easing the lockdown too early because doing so would &ldquo;risk a second wave&rdquo; of infections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t expect to make any changes to the measures currently in place at that point and we won&rsquo;t until we&rsquo;re confident, as confident as we realistically can be, that any such changes can be safely made,&rdquo; he said at a Downing Street press conference.</p>
<p>He acknowledged the government had been concerned last week &ldquo;that people might start ignoring the advice or cutting corners given the temptation to go out into the sunshine&rdquo; but said the &ldquo;overwhelming&rdquo; majority of people had stayed at home.
