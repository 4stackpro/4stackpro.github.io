In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, “solemn assemblies” are rare occasions that mark some of the religion’s holiest transitions, like the installation of a new prophet, the dedication of a temple, or the canonization of scripture.</p>
<p>They’re not usually surprise events. But President Russell M. Nelson, speaking Saturday morning on the first day of the church’s two-day General Conference, dropped a bombshell when he said that Sunday’s meetings will feature one. He did not discuss why or give much indication of what church members should expect, though he mentioned that there would be “unique announcements” during the meeting. Naturally, Mormon social media has been alive with speculations.</p>
<p>Many progressive Mormons would like to see Nelson announce an expansion of women’s roles in the conservative denomination. Fueling that possibility is the fact that in the weeks leading up to the conference, he asked women to study passages of Latter-day Saint scripture that relate to the priesthood — specifically, Doctrine and Covenants 25, 84 and 107.</p>
<p>In the Saturday morning session, President Joy Jones of the children’s Primary spoke of women having full access to priesthood power and seemed almost apologetic that it is only late in life that she has realized she has that access herself.</p>
<p>It’s possible that these are hints of an announcement Sunday about a more visible leadership role for women. What that might look like — the Relief Society taking over the church’s disaster response and spearheading a global effort to fight COVID-19? Women being empowered once again to give blessings for healing in a time of widespread illness? — is entirely conjecture.</p>
<p>On the conservative side, hopes abound that The Family: A Proclamation to the World might finally be canonized as an official part of the scriptures. This document features several assertions beloved by conservative church members, including that women’s primary role is to nurture children, that marriage is to be strictly defined as being between a man and a woman, and that fathers are to preside over their families.</p>
<p>Since its creation in the mid-1990s the proclamation has functioned as a de facto scripture, quoted often in General Conference and posted prominently in many Latter-day Saints’ homes, but it has never been officially canonized.</p>
<p>Perhaps Sunday will be the time. If that happens, it’s easy to envision a prominent role for first counselor Dallin Oaks, who has been the document’s most vocal champion.</p>
<p>In addition to announcing the solemn assembly, Nelson also asked church members watching General Conference around the world to bring a white handkerchief to participate in a global, all-digital “Hosanna Shout” on Sunday. The purpose, he said, is to express gratitude to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Hosanna Shouts, in which members wave handkerchiefs and shout in unison, “Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna to God and the Lamb” three times, typically occur at temple dedications, not at the church’s twice-yearly General Conferences. But little about this conference is by the book: because of the spread of COVID-19, there is no live audience, and the selections by the Tabernacle Choir are from earlier recordings. The prophet and his counselors are observing social distancing by sitting many feet apart from one another and recording their talks from a near-empty room in the Church Office Building in Salt Lake City.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s intriguing that Nelson is instituting the Hosanna Shout on the perfect day in the Western liturgical calendar: Palm Sunday. Shouting “hosanna” on Palm Sunday is a sacred tradition for Christians all over the world as they commemorate Jesus’ triumphal entry into Jerusalem. At that time, Jesus rode a donkey while crowds lined the streets to welcome him by shouting “Hosanna!”</p>
<p>Article continues below</p>
<p>But reenacting this scene is not common for Latter-day Saints, who celebrate Easter but do not generally mark the other days of Holy Week. Mormon worship services on the Sunday before Easter do not explicitly reference Palm Sunday or its traditions.</p>
<p>Maybe the church is beginning to pay more attention to it. In 2016, Dieter Uchtdorf of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles wrote a short article for children explaining the traditions around Palm Sunday and what the celebration means. “Now, especially during the week from Palm Sunday to Easter morning, we turn our thoughts to Jesus Christ, the source of light, life, and love,” he said. “He gave us His gospel. The gospel is the good news of Christ. It is the way of hope and joy.”</p>
<p>Scheduling an unusual Hosanna Shout on Palm Sunday may just be a fortuitous coincidence. In any case, the point of a hosanna — which beseeches Christ, as the followers lining the street in Jerusalem, to “save us!” — is certainly timely for a global pandemic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!&rdquo; (Mark 11:9)I love the word “Hosanna!” I heard it several times this weekend watching church services on line. I can remember getting a palm branch at church and waving it back and forth saying loudly, “Hosanna, Hosanna.” That’s a Christian tradition many of us have grown up with.This Holy Week is different for us. It’s not one where we’re receiving palm branches from a kids worker or greeter at the door, yet somehow I believe in my spirit that our collective exclamation of Hosanna can ring louder today that any in my lifetime.Hosanna means “save now.” When used in the Psalms, it is usually translated, “Help!”This Palm Sunday, many of us find ourselves in grave situations. You may have family or friends who are fighting for their health. You may be suffering from the economic consequences of this current disaster. Still, we can cry out in one voice on this Palm Sunday, “Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!”I have never been more encouraged to see so many calls to prayer and repentance being issued. I’ve heard from so many of our churches, networks, districts, and associations calling on people to unite in prayer. I am all in! And I want the Assemblies of God to be all in.As we move from Palm Sunday and begin approaching Easter, I’m asking you to join me in participating in these calls to prayer which are being issued. I pray that we will let our collective hosannas reach to the heavens. As we call to the Lord to save us from this disaster and to help us in this circumstance, I’m confident that He will hear and answer.So, let’s make this a Palm Sunday to remember — not because of the bad news surrounding us, but because of the hope He provides. Let’s remember this Palm Sunday as the day that hosannas began to rise from living rooms, hospital rooms, and prayer closets across the world. Come on, say it with me right now, “Hosanna!”

<h3 id="no-hosanna-and-no-waving-a-low-key-palm-sunday-for-christians-across-tamil-nadu">No &lsquo;Hosanna&rsquo; and no waving: A low-key Palm Sunday for Christians across Tamil Nadu</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2020/4/5/w600X390/Palm_Sunday_pix2.jpg" alt="img">

<p>NAGAPATTINAM (TAMIL NADU): Thousands of Christians across Nagapattinam, Karaikal and other Tamil Nadu districts did not celebrate Palm Sunday due to curfew and Coronavirus scare.</p>
<p>There were no gatherings, no waving of palm branches and no songs of ‘Hosanna in the Highest’ on the streets as Palm Sunday went quietly across Nagapattinam, Karaikal and other Tamil Nadu and Puducherry districts. “When the churches did not celebrate ‘Palm Sunday’ today, how could we? We did not decorate our houses with any palm branches, as we only like them to blessed by our church. We miss the mass today,” said JK Jayanthi, a 50-year-old homemaker from Semmarakadai Street.</p>
<p>Palm Sunday is a day celebrated by Christians across the world to mark the day when the Jerusalemites welcomed Jesus Christ into their city with palm branches in their hands on the Sunday before Passover Festival. Christians celebrate the day by collecting palm branches blessed by the priest, decorating and their houses, holding Palm Branch Procession around the churches, and making crafts out of them. None have happened on Sunday due to shut down of places of worship due to curfew and Coronavirus scare.</p>
<p>The churches across Tamil Nadu such as centuries-old Shrine Basilica in Velankanni and ‘Our Lady of Angels’ Church in Karaikal have been shut from March third week; many for the first time in several decades, due to concerns of spread of Coronavirus. “We did not distribute the palm branches, which we cut from our garden and bless, to anyone, as we are concerned, it could lead to the unnecessary gathering. We conducted three masses in Tamil, Malayalam and English, behind closed doors today simply without people. The masses will be relayed live on YouTube throughout this week from Shrine Basilica,” said Fr AMA Prabakar, the Rector of Shrine Basilica ‘Our Lady of Good Health’ in Velankanni.</p>
<p>The senior priest also delivered a sermon cum Palm Sunday via YouTube and prayed for the health of the people.</p>
<p>The Shrine Basilica was decently decorated on Sunday with Palm Braches to cheer the ‘faithful subscribers’ to follow the masses in YouTube. But, many churches could not do or afford that decent luxury. “Our parishioners, the people, do everything for us. We did not decorate anything. We finished off with a single mass on mass with a handful of nuns and church workers,” said Fr D Arokia Sagayaraj, the Assistant Parish Priest of ‘Our Lady of Angels’ Church in Karaikal.
