<p>Actor Danny Masterson has been charged with three counts of rape involving incidents between 2001 and 2003, Los Angeles prosecutors said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles County district attorney’s office said in a statement that Masterson is accused of raping a 23-year-old woman between January and December 2001, a 28-year-old woman in April 2003 and a 23-year-old woman he invited to a Hollywood party between October and December 2003.</p>
<p>Masterson surrendered to Los Angeles police and was booked Wednesday afternoon at the downtown jail. He was released after posting $3.3-million bail.</p>
<p>The “That ‘70s Show” actor is scheduled to be arraigned in September. He could not immediately be reached for comment. The alleged crimes occurred at his Hollywood Hills home, officials said.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>When sexual assault allegations against the actor were first raised in 2017, he and his representative denied them and suggested they were motivated by the producer of an anti-Scientology television series. Masterson has identified himself as a practicing Scientologist.</p>
<p>In a statement Wednesday, his attorney said Masterson is innocent.</p>
<p>“We’re confident that he will be exonerated when all the evidence finally comes to light and witnesses have the opportunity to testify,” Tom Mesereau said. “Obviously, Mr. Masterson and his wife are in complete shock considering that these nearly 20-year old allegations are suddenly resulting in charges being filed, but they and their family are comforted knowing that ultimately the truth will come out. The people who know Mr. Masterson know his character and know the allegations to be false.”</p>
<p>Mesereau most famously successfully defended singer Michael Jackson against child molestation charges.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Masterson has been the subject of the growing number of sexual assault allegations from women he knew. He becomes the second high-profile Hollywood figure charged by Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Jackie Lacey, following Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein on rape charges in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which gave voice to sexual assault survivors and has spurred a cultural awakening.</p>
<p>Weinstein was sentenced to 23 years in prison after bring convicted of rape and committing a criminal sexual act in New York this year.</p>
<p>In the Masterson case, Lacey has come under fire previously for not acting on the allegations. Among those voicing criticism was actress Leah Remini, a former Scientologist and well-known critic of the church, who publicly questioned why the district attorney had not charged the actor.</p>
<p>The LAPD’s elite sex crimes unit inside its Robbery-Homicide Division began investigating Masterson in late 2016. In March 2017, the department acknowledged it was looking into allegations of three accusers. A month later, evidence was presented to the district attorney’s office, but prosecutors repeatedly asked for additional investigations.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Prosecutors reviewed allegations from five women. The district attorney’s office declined to file sexual assault charges in two cases, one for insufficient evidence and the other based on the statute of limitations for the crime alleged.</p>
<p>All three accusers in the criminal case have also joined in a civil lawsuit that was filed against Masterson in 2019 in Los Angeles County Superior Court, according to the women’s attorney, Brian Kent. In that lawsuit, a total of four women accused Masterson of sexually assaulting them and said that after coming forward, the actor, along with affiliates of the Church of Scientology, sought to silence and intimidate them. The lawsuit contends that Masterson has worked as a field staff member for Scientology-related organizations.</p>
<p>One of the plaintiffs, Chrissie Bixler, alleged that while dating Masterson, he assaulted her “on more than one occasion” in late 2001 or early 2002, and that one of the alleged assaults occurred while she was unconscious.</p>
<p>After Bixler reported the assault to the LAPD in 2016, she claims in the lawsuit that she was stalked and threatened, purportedly by people affiliated with Scientology-related organizations.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Another woman who joined the lawsuit but opted to sue Masterson anonymously accused him of sexually assaulting her at his home on April 24 or 25 of 2003, a date that corresponds to an incident that is the basis for one of the charges in the criminal case.</p>
<p>That woman alleged she became “very sick and disoriented” after drinking a beverage at Masterson’s home, according to the lawsuit. She alleged that after falling ill, Masterson brought her into a bathroom, undressed her and sexually assaulted her in the shower, according to the lawsuit. The woman claimed that she later awoke to him raping her. The lawsuit stated that an unidentified witness was present for some of the events leading to the alleged assault.</p>
<p>Masterson’s lawyers have vigorously denied the lawsuit’s allegations, calling them “false and defamatory.” The attorneys have noted that the claims do not mention that the plaintiffs “all had long-standing relationships with Mr. Masterson.” The lawyers have also said that the “original claims” stemmed from “prior consensual relationships.”</p>
<p>“This lawsuit is not about justice, as Mr. Masterson’s exes disingenuously claim,” his lawyer Andrew Brettler wrote in a February court filing. “It is a shameful money grab; plain and simple.”</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>William Forman, an attorney for the Church of Scientology International, previously dismissed the claims made in the litigation.</p>
<p>“This baseless lawsuit will go nowhere, because the claims are ludicrous and a sham,” Forman told The Times in 2019. “It’s a dishonest and hallucinatory publicity stunt.”</p>
<p>Masterson’s prosecution is being led by Deputy Dist. Atty. Reinhold Mueller, who is also handling sex abuse charges against former USC gynecologist Dr. George Tyndall. Masterson faces a possible maximum sentence of 45 years to life in state prison if convicted of all charges.</p>
<p>The actor was fired from the Netflix series “The Ranch” in 2017 after Los Angeles police acknowledged the investigation.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“From day one, I have denied the outrageous allegations against me. I have never been charged with a crime, let alone convicted of one,” he said then. “In this country, you are presumed innocent until proven guilty. However, in the current climate, it seems as if you are presumed guilty the moment you are accused. I understand and look forward to clearing my name once and for all.”

<h3 id="that-70s-show-actor-danny-masterson-charged-in-3-rapes">&ldquo;`That 70s Show’ actor Danny Masterson charged in 3 rapes&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.graytvinc.com/images/0617_Danny-Masterson_Click.jpg" alt="img">
LOS ANGELES (AP) — “That ’70s Show” actor Danny Masterson was charged with the rapes of three women in the early 2000s, Los Angeles prosecutors said Wednesday, the culmination of a three-year investigation that resulted in a rare arrest of a famous Hollywood figure in the #MeToo era.</p>
<p>The three counts of rape by force or fear against Masterson were filed Tuesday, and an arrest warrant isssued. Masterson, 44, was arrested late Wednesday morning, jail records showed. He was released a few hours later after posting bond and is scheduled to be arraigned Sept. 18.</p>
<p>Masterson&rsquo;s attorney Tom Mesereau said his client is innocent, and &ldquo;we’re confident that he will be exonerated when all the evidence finally comes to light and witnesses have the opportunity to testify.”</p>
<p>Prosecutors allege that Masterson raped a 23-year-old woman sometime in 2001, a 28-year-old woman in April of 2003, and a 23-year-old woman he had invited to his Hollywood Hills home between October and December of 2003.</p>
<p>If convicted, he could face up to 45 years in prison.</p>
<p>Prosecutors declined to file charges in two other Masterson cases that police had investigated, one because of insufficient evidence and the other because the statute of limitations had expired.</p>
<p>Masterson has been married to actor and model Bijou Phillips since 2011.</p>
<p>“Obviously, Mr. Masterson and his wife are in complete shock considering that these nearly 20-year old allegations are suddenly resulting in charges being filed, but they and their family are comforted knowing that ultimately the truth will come out,&rdquo; said Mesereau, who has previously represented Michael Jackson and Bill Cosby in their trials for sexual crimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people who know Mr. Masterson know his character and know the allegations to be false.”</p>
<p>The women, whose names were not made public, issued a statement through their attorneys saying they have suffered &ldquo;harassment, embarrassment and re-victimization” since they began cooperating with authorities.</p>
<p>“We are thankful that the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office is finally seeking criminal justice against Masterson,” the statement said. &ldquo;We are confident that the truth will be known and hope that the charges filed today are the first steps in this long journey of healing, justice, and holding those that victimized us accountable.”</p>
<p>The alleged rapes came at the height of Masterson’s fame as he starred on the retro sitcom “That ’70s Show” alongside Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis and Topher Grace. The series ran on Fox TV from 1998 to 2006 and has had a long afterlife in reruns.</p>
<p>He had reunited with Kutcher on the Netflix western sitcom “The Ranch” when the LAPD investigation of him was revealed in March 2017. The news did not have immediate career repercussions for Masterson, but later in the year, after allegations against Harvey Weinstein shook Hollywood’s culture, he was written off the show.</p>
<p>Masterson decried the Hollywood atmosphere that led to his losing the job, and also suggested at the time that his high-profile membership in the Church of Scientology was leading to his persecution.</p>
<p>He said in a 2017 statement that “in the current climate, it seems as if you are presumed guilty the moment you are accused.”</p>
<p>Because police were already investigating him, Masterson’s case was not among those taken up by a task force formed by Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey to investigate sexual misconduct in the entertainment industry. That task force has declined to file charges in more than 20 cases in the two years of its existence, charging only Weinstein himself.</p>
<p>Los Angeles prosecutors have begun efforts to bring Weinstein to California to face charges of rape and sexual assault. He is being held in a New York prison after being convicted of similar charges earlier this year.</p>
<p>Masterson’s case still stands out as just the second set of charges Los Angeles prosecutors have filed against a famous Hollywood figure in the #MeToo era.</p>
<p>Masterson worked steadily starting in the early 1990s, largely in TV sitcoms including “Cybill” and “Men at Work” along with “That ’70s Show” and “The Ranch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His film credits include the 2008 Jim Carrey comedy “Yes Man,” “The Bridge to Nowhere” in 2009, in which he starred with his future wife Phillips, and 2011’s “The Chicago 8,” in which he played 1960s antiwar activist Jerry Rubin.</p>

<p>That 70s Show actor Danny Masterson has been charged with raping three women in separate incidents in 2001 and 2003, the Los Angeles District Attorney&rsquo;s office says. The District Attorney&rsquo;s Office said in a statement on Wednesday it had declined to file sexual assault charges against Masterson in two other cases because of insufficient evidence and because of the statute of limitations. Masterson, 44, got his break-out role in the 1998-2006 television comedy series That 70s Show, in which he played a rebel adolescent. In a statement issued to Variety, Tom Mesereau, Masterson&rsquo;s lawyer, vowed to fight the charges. &ldquo;Mr Masterson is innocent, and we&rsquo;re confident that he will be exonerated when all the evidence finally comes to light and witnesses have the opportunity to testify,&rdquo; Mesereau said in the statement. &ldquo;The people who know Mr Masterson know his character and know the allegations to be false.&rdquo; The three rape charges together carry a maximum prison sentence of 45 years to life in prison if Masterson is convicted, the District Attorney&rsquo;s office said. All of the alleged rapes took place at Masterson&rsquo;s Hollywood Hills home, the statement said. They involve the alleged rape of a 23-year-old woman between January and December 2001, a 28-year-old woman in April 2003, and a 23-year old woman between October and December 2003. The charges did not name the women. Masterson, who has been married to actress Bijou Phillips since 2011, was written out of the Netflix comedy series The Ranch in December 2017 when a police investigation on the allegations against him first came to light. Dozens of actors, politicians, businessmen and musicians have lost their jobs since 2017 when sexual assault allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein fueled the #MeToo movement. Weinstein was convicted of rape and sexual assault in February and sentenced to 23 years behind bars. Australian Associated Press</p>

<p>The alleged victims in a statement distributed by their attorneys said in part, &ldquo;all we have wanted was justice, accountability, and truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are thankful that the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office is finally seeking criminal justice against Masterson after a three-year investigation,&rdquo; the statement read. &ldquo;We are confident that the truth will be known and hope that the charges filed today are the first steps in this long journey of healing, justice, and holding those that victimized us accountable.”</p>
<p>Prosecutors declined to charge Masterson in connection with two other sexual assault allegations, according to the district attorney&rsquo;s office, because of insufficient evidence in one and because the statute of limitations had expired in the other.</p>
<p>Inmate records show that Masterson was booked into the Los Angeles County Jail on Wednesday and released on bond at about 2:45 p.m. local time. Bail was set at $3.3 million.</p>
<p>He faces a possible maximum sentence of 45 years to life in state prison if he is convicted on all three charges.</p>
<p>Masterson&rsquo;s attorney, Tom Mesereau, insisted in a statement to NBC News that the actor was innocent and that he would be exonerated when &ldquo;all the evidence comes to light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously, Mr. Masterson and his wife are in complete shock considering that these nearly 20-year-old allegations are suddenly resulting in charges being filed, but they and their family are comforted knowing that ultimately the truth will come out,&rdquo; Mesereau said. &ldquo;The people who know Mr. Masterson know his character and know the allegations to be false.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Masterson left the Netflix series &ldquo;The Ranch&rdquo; in 2017 after four women accused him of rape, accusations that Masterson denied at the time. Masterson starred in &ldquo;The Ranch&rdquo; with Ashton Kutcher and was an executive producer for the show.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether those allegations are related to the charges announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am obviously very disappointed in Netflix&rsquo;s decision to write my character off of &lsquo;The Ranch.&rsquo; From day one, I have denied the outrageous allegations against me,&rdquo; Masterson said in a statement to NBC News in 2017. &ldquo;Law enforcement investigated these claims more than 15 years ago and determined them to be without merit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The accusations against Masterson became public amid the beginning stages of the #MeToo movement, when victims were encouraged to speak out against sexual harassment and misconduct perpetuated by powerful figures.

Prosecutors say &ldquo;That &rsquo;70s Show&rdquo; actor Danny Masterson has been charged with the rapes of three women in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>The three counts of rape by force or fear announced Wednesday come after a three-year investigation of the 44-year-old Masterson.</p>
<p>The charges were filed Tuesday and an arrest warrant was issued. It&rsquo;s not clear whether he has been taken into custody.</p>
<p>An attorney for Masterson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Masterson denied the allegations in a statement when they investigation was made public in 2017.</p>
