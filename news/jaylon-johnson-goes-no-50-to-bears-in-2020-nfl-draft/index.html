The Chicago Bears have decided to add a little bit of talent to the defensive backline in the 2020 NFL Draft. With the No. 50 overall pick, the Bears have selected Jaylon Johnson, a cornerback out of Utah. Johnson left the Utes after his junior season to pursue NFL dreams.</p>
<p>A four-star prospect out of Fresno, California, initially, Johnson got on the field early in his career for the Utes. He played 12 games, starting two of them, as a true freshman in 2017 and tied for the team lead in pass breakups with six. The next year he was First Team All-Pac-12 after starting all 14 games for the Utes at cornerback.</p>
<p>His junior year, 2019, Johnson really impressed the country. He started 13 games for Utah but skipped the Alamo Bowl against Texas after declaring early for the NFL Draft. He recorded 36 tackles and had a team-high 11 pass breakups. Johnson was named a Second Team All-American by multiple outlets and was First Team All-Pac-12 for the second-straight season.</p>
<p>Steve Bartle, the publisher of UteZone.com on the 247Sports network, believes that his patience and eye-recognition are two strong points for Johnson in the NFL.</p>
<p>“Johnson is the prototypical press corner thanks to his size, length and athleticism,” Bartle wrote. “He&rsquo;s effective at the length of scrimmage and often forces receivers off of their routes and timing. Has the athleticism to match up with most outside receivers and plays faster thanks to his feel and mental processing. Quick trigger in off-man/zone coverages can make him susceptible to double moves, but improved patience and eye-recognition will go a long ways for him.”</p>
<p>At the 2019 NFL Draft, Johnson record a 40-yard dash time of 4.5 seconds, did 15 reps on the 225-pound bench press and had a vertical jump of 36.5 inches. His performance gave him a grade of 6.43, which, according to NFL.com, means he will be a starter within the first two years in the league.</p>
<p>NFL.com analyst Lance Zierlein drew comparisons to Shaquill Griffin. Griffin was a third-round pick out of UCF in the 2017 NFL Draft by the Seattle Seahawks, where he still is today. In three seasons with the Seahawks, Griffin has 186 tackles and three interceptions.</p>
<p>“Boundary bully with an improving skill set to clamp down on WR1s and limit their exposure to the football,” Zierlein wrote. “Johnson is built for press, with the size, length and athleticism to force receivers to work harder getting into their routes. His eagerness to stay tight to the route leads to inconsistent balance and positioning from time to time, but his foot quickness and agility allow for rapid recoveries. He&rsquo;s equipped to play the deep ball but needs to fully prove himself in that area. He&rsquo;s a physical press corner with off-man ability whose anticipation and ball skills should continue to help him make plays as a CB1 and first-round pick.”

<h3 id="jaylon-johnson-nfl-draft-2020-scouting-report-for-chicago-bears-pick">Jaylon Johnson NFL Draft 2020: Scouting Report for Chicago Bears&rsquo; Pick</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/863/820/hi-res-67e2f010a1cf05f09d6ce36a0880bdd7_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=1200&amp;q=75" alt="img">
Rick Bowmer/Associated Press</p>
<p>CB Jaylon Johnson, Utah</p>
<p>STRENGTHS</p>
<p>—Smart, instinctive cornerback with ball skills, toughness and quickness in the open field.</p>
<p>—Ideal size (6&rsquo;0&rdquo;, 193 lbs) to play man coverage and has shown an ability to stay in-phase while reading the ball and making plays in space.</p>
<p>—Won&rsquo;t leave his man early to go after the ball, which is why he&rsquo;s able to hang through double moves so well.</p>
<p>—Tough in run support and at the line of scrimmage.</p>
<p>—Hands like a wide receiver, with excellent vertical skills to attack the ball.</p>
<p>—High-character, smart player with an awesome work ethic; will be a solid locker room addition.</p>

B/R Fantasy Expert Matt Camp Gives His Picks for Keep or Release After Week 2 Does Hines Ward Deserve Your 2019 Pro Football Hall of Fame Vote? Right Arrow Icon</p>
<p>WEAKNESSES</p>
<p>—Only above-average speed could cause trouble against top-flight wide receivers.</p>
<p>—Handsy in coverage and at the route stem; will have to work on covering without his hands redirecting the receiver.</p>
<p>—Doesn&rsquo;t play to his timed speed (4.5-second 40) when asked to turn and run.</p>
<p>—Didn&rsquo;t wow anyone with his numbers at the combine, but he ran with a torn labrum that required surgery the following week.</p>
<p>OVERALL</p>
<p>Johnson is easy to root for as a high-character, tough, instinctive player who showed up and made plays in his biggest games in college. His labrum surgery in early March is something to watch in his rookie season, but Johnson&rsquo;s college tape and traits all point to him being an early starter at a high level.</p>
<p>GRADE: 88</p>
<p>PRO COMPARISON: Bradley Roby/Gareon Conley
