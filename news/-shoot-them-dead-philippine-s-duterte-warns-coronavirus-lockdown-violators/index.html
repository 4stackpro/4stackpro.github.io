Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who issued a stark warning April 1, 2020 to violators of the country&rsquo;s coronavirus lockdown.</p>
<p>Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday warned violators of coronavirus lockdown measures they could be shot for causing trouble and said abuse of medical workers was a serious crime that would not be tolerated.</p>
<p>Advertising Read more</p>
<p>In a televised address, Duterte said it was vital everyone cooperates and follows home quarantine measures, as authorities try to slow the coronavirus contagion and spare the country&rsquo;s fragile health system from being overwhelmed.</p>
<p>The Philippines has recorded 96 coronavirus deaths and 2,311 confirmed cases, all but three in the past three weeks, with infections now being reported in the hundreds every day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is getting worse. So once again I&rsquo;m telling you the seriousness of the problem and that you must listen,&rdquo; Duterte said late on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My orders to the police and military &hellip; if there is trouble and there&rsquo;s an occasion that they fight back and your lives are in danger, shoot them dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that understood? Dead. Instead of causing trouble, I will bury you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His comments came after media reports of a disturbance and several arrests on Wednesday of residents in a poor area of Manila who were protesting about sufficient government food aid.</p>
<p>They also follow outrage among the medical community about social stigma and instances of hospital workers suffering physical abuse and discrimination, which Duterte said must be stopped.</p>
<p>‘Deeply alarming,’ says Amnesty</p>
<p>Responding to Duterte’s call, Amnesty International on Thursday said the Philippine leader’s statement was “deeply alarming” and warned, “Deadly, unchecked force should never be used in an emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic.”</p>
<p>Referring to Wednesday’s incident in San Roque village in Quezon City, Amnesty International noted that when residents were informed that a government relief distribution had run out of supplies, they decided to stay in the area and stage a protest to demand relief.</p>
<p>The residents told Amnesty International that the police then “resorted to violently dispersing the protestors and hit them with wooden sticks&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Activists deride Duterte over his fierce rhetoric and accuse him of inviting violence and vigilantism, as shown in his war on drugs, during which police and mystery gunmen have killed thousands of people accused of using or selling drugs.</p>
<p>Police say their actions in the anti-drug campaign have been lawful.</p>
<p>Duterte&rsquo;s office typically calls his remarks hyperbole to underline his point.</p>
<p>The national police chief on Thursday said police understood that Duterte was demonstrating his seriousness about public order, and no one would be shot.</p>

<h3 id="in-slum-at-epicenter-of-dutertes-drug-crackdown-fear-and-love-coexist">In Slum at Epicenter of Duterte’s Drug Crackdown, Fear and Love Coexist</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/12/world/00philippines-fish-dispatch-promoSUB/00philippines-fish-dispatch-promoSUB-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
“What crime against humanity?” Mr. Duterte said in defense of his antidrug campaign. “I’d like to be frank with you, are they humans?”</p>
<p>At the height of the government’s crackdown in 2016 and 2017, Market Three, named after the nearest pier, was an epicenter of the killings, even though the majority of the 1,000 or so families living here had nothing to do with the drug trade.</p>
<p>There were bodies found floating in the water, while other people were killed in their homes, as many as five in a night.</p>
<p>While residents blamed the police for many of these summary executions, in most cases, the killers were never identified.</p>
<p>But the police left no doubt it was they who smashed open doors during frequent raids in the middle of the night, wearing masks, carrying guns and shining flashlights into the faces of Market Three’s residents.</p>
<p>Because people couldn’t quite discern why the police or their proxies were killing some and not others — mistaken identity or disproportionate punishment were frequent guesses — the raids filled the whole slum with a fear that death could happen at any time, for any reason.</p>
<p>There’s less of that now. While the government’s deadly antidrug campaign goes on, the police focus has shifted to other areas of the country and to other targets. Just on Wednesday, Mr. Duterte ordered the police and the military to shoot people protesting the nation’s lockdown over the coronavirus.

<h3 id="analysis-may-pera-nga-ba-does-duterte-have-money-to-fight-covid-19">[ANALYSIS] May pera nga ba? Does Duterte have money to fight COVID-19?</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets.rappler.com/612F469A6EA84F6BAE882D2B94A4B421/img/87721C83DC1345E7AD66FB54786E99FB/does-duterte-have-money-to-fight-covid-19-april-2-2020.jpg" alt="img">
There are already flashes of social unrest.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, April 1, residents from Sitio San Roque, an urban poor community in Quezon City, went out of their houses on rumors that aid was being distributed. Having violated quarantine rules, they were swiftly chased down by the police; 21 were arrested.</p>
<p>Here’s the awful truth: aid is not reaching Filipinos fast enough.</p>
<p>In the recently signed Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, President Rodrigo Duterte promised to give 18 million households a monthly “emergency subsidy” of at least P5,000 per household for two months. But government is still preparing the database that will be used to target these households.</p>
<p>It’s not just workers and the poor who need help, but also businesses whose cash flows – and very survival – are in peril. But the Department of Finance (DOF) said aid for firms will “take [a] back seat.”</p>
<p>Economists say government needs as much as P300 billion to put the Philippine economy on life support. Duterte assured the people – in one of his late night addresses – that he has the money for that: “may pera ako”.</p>
<p>But does he really have the money? Where will it come from? And how exactly does he intend to use it?</p>
<p>Sources of funds</p>
<p>The good news is that government has lots of possible sources of emergency funds – from taxes to savings and loans.</p>
<p>As for taxes, the DOF admitted tax revenues might drop this year by over P91 billion, what with the Philippine economy put in forced hibernation. Minimal incomes beget minimal taxes. (READ: ‘Freezing’ the PH economy: Can we survive it?)</p>
<p>But Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III gave assurances previous tax reform programs like TRAIN were able to raise nearly P200 billion in revenues in the past two years.</p>
<p>Even as Dominguez said this, however, he implored taxpayers – at least those able to file and pay their taxes early – to help bankroll the government’s COVID-19 programs.</p>
<p>But the entire point of the government’s response to COVID-19 is to hand out economic aid. The last thing we want is for government to ask money from the people while their incomes and livelihoods disappear before their eyes.</p>
<p>As for savings, the Bayanihan law authorized Duterte to “reprogram, reallocate, and realign” savings from 2020 budget items to help communities and industries affected by COVID-19.</p>
<p>But in Duterte’s first weekly report last Monday, March 30, no such realignment has been done.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the DOF claims there are P200 billion more that can be tapped from various accounts of the national government and GOCCs (government owned or controlled corporations).</p>
<p>As for loans, the DOF is already in talks with multilateral agencies like the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to secure loans amounting to $1 billion-$2 billion.</p>
<p>In April the Treasury also expects to raise P190 billion from its sale of government securities – although demand from investors has been anemic of late.</p>
<p>By far the most significant funding source came from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), which purchased government securities worth P300 billion.</p>
<p>You can think of this as a zero-interest bridge loan that the Treasury must repay in 6 months. If spent prudently, this substantial sum could go a long way in our fight against COVID-19.</p>
<p>Uses of funds</p>
<p>More worrisome than the sources of funds are the uses of funds.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of confusion right now on exactly how much Duterte plans to spend for his COVID-19 projects.</p>
<p>First, government announced on March 16 a P27.1 billion spending plan. But some observers said this sum was too small and a mere repackaging of existing budget items. Oddly, it was also mostly earmarked for tourism.</p>
<p>Second, Marikina Representative Stella Quimbo drafted a P108 billion “economic rescue plan” which allotted P50 billion for business loans and subsidies, P43 billion for tourism, and P15 billion for displaced workers. But Congress has yet to pass this or some other rescue package.</p>
<p>Third, Duterte’s allies in the House penciled P275 billion in their draft of the Bayanihan law (originally written by the Palace). But when interpellated, the bill’s sponsors couldn’t provide any breakdown for the huge sum they proposed.</p>
<p>Fourth, the Bayanihan law signed by Duterte on March 25 actually didn’t specify a total amount. Duterte later said he’d spend P200 billion, but that’s barely enough for his emergency subsidy which, by itself, will cost somewhere between P180 billion and P288 billion (plus P5.1 billion in administrative costs).</p>
<p>Lots of people on social media demand to see what Duterte has done with the supposed P275-billion COVID-19 budget. But the real amount…we don’t know. There’s no detailed spending plan yet.</p>
<p>Slow delivery of aid</p>
<p>In the meantime, more people are getting broke and hungry and desperate by the day.</p>
<p>The Bayanihan law did specify the amount of emergency subsidy people can get (see table below), but government is still drawing up the final list of beneficiaries. It will take weeks to distribute such aid to 18 million households. (A similar lag happened in the distribution of unconditional cash transfers of the 2017 TRAIN law.)</p>
<p>Businesses – especially smaller ones – are also beginning to fold. Delivery trucks are held up at checkpoints, container vans stranded at ports.</p>
<p>There’s also no specific financial assistance earmarked for firms in the Bayanihan law. Congress still needs to craft a separate bill for this purpose, but lawmakers may not convene again until May – by which time many businesses will already have gone bankrupt.</p>
<p>Finally, medical supplies such as personal protective equipment also remain unacceptably scarce as our frontliners continue to valiantly fight COVID-19.</p>
<p>Delays may yet worsen. On April 1 Duterte ordered that all donations to the national government or health department of medicines and medical equipment be directed to one central office: the Office of Civil Defense. But our frontliners need these supplies urgently, and this new regulation could only add another needless layer of bureaucracy in the process.</p>
<p>At least 17 doctors have already died due to the disease, yet Duterte even had to the gall to say they were “lucky” to have died for the country. Quite the opposite: they were unlucky.</p>
<p>If only government had prepared for and responded earlier to the epidemic, many of our frontliners need not have died.</p>
<p>Governance crisis</p>
<p>At the end of the day, money is not really the issue here. There should be more than enough sources of emergency funds.</p>
<p>The real problem is that entering the third week since the initial lockdown, Duterte has yet to show any comprehensive, detailed plan to allocate and distribute disaster relief for the tens of millions of Filipinos who need support ASAP.</p>
<p>Worse, Duterte seems to be confusing the real enemy. In a surprise address on April 1, Duterte (presumably triggered by the riot at Sitio San Roque earlier that day) ordered his troops to shoot anyone who violates quarantine rules.</p>
<p>Today we’re enduring two types of crises: one in public health, another in governance. Unsettlingly, I can’t tell which is worse now. – Rappler.com</p>
