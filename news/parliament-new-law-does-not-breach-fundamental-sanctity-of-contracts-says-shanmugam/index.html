SINGAPORE - The proposed law to provide temporary protection for those unable to fulfil their contractual obligations due to the Covid-19 outbreak does not change the fundamental sanctity of contracts made in Singapore, Law Minister K. Shanmugam told the House on Tuesday (Apr 7).</p>
<p>He stressed that the Government’s intervention to change the obligations for contracts made are targeted and temporary, meant to provide relief without too much alteration to contractual rights.</p>
<p>“This is a legal circuit breaker - a time out - until this virus dies out and contracts, like life, can return to normal,” he said.</p>
<p>In his speech on the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Bill, Mr Shanmugam said the government did not make such a move lightly, and he took pains to lay out the principles that were taken into consideration for this Bill and that would guide any such intervention in the future.</p>
<p>He described the sanctity of contracts as an “unyielding principle and norm”, although he said freedom of contracts is not absolute.</p>
<p>He noted that governments already set legal frameworks for laws that invalidate any contract that breaches those rules.</p>
<p>And for the current legislation, when the government needs to intervene in contracts already formed, it does so only under a strict set of principles, including situations when the strict enforcement of particular contractual rights could damage the whole economy.</p>
<p>“In this situation, we cannot say leave it to the market, leave it to the contractual situation,” he said.</p>
<p>“It would be neither fair, nor just - the bottom of the market has literally fallen off, and the normal assumptions of business are gone.”</p>
<p>The Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Bill, among others, seeks to prevent landlords from terminating commercial leases due to non-payment of rent if this is due to the virus, and protect consumers from having their deposits for a wedding or business event forfeited because of postponement.</p>
<p>He gave various examples of how even the US, which is often seen as “the ultimate capitalist, free market economy” has also passed similar laws.</p>
<p>Related Story Relief coming for parties in contracts hit by virus</p>
<p>During the Great Depression, Iowa and 27 other states passed laws that gave relief to mortgages and a moratorium on mortgage foreclosures.</p>
<p>While the laws were challenged in court, they were ultimately upheld by the US Supreme Court, which argued that the State has the power to intervene so as to safeguard the economic structure upon which all Americans ultimately depend on.</p>
<p>During the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, the US again passed laws to protect home owners and renters facing foreclosure, he noted.</p>
<p>There is also precedent for this in Singapore law, noted Mr Shanmugam, as the Republic passed the Frustrated Contracts Act in 1959.</p>
<p>This law allows for a contract to be deemed “frustrated” if the failure to perform its obligations was the the result of events beyond the control of the contracting parties and which could not have been reasonably foreseen.</p>

<p>This is why the Government has decided to intervene, even though Singapore&rsquo;s reputation for upholding the sanctity of contracts has been critical to its success as an international commercial centre, said Mr Shanmugam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t intervene, the consequences would be that those in a position of advantage will make some money, but most will suffer bankruptcies, insolvencies, and the complete destruction of the economic arena,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;(There will be) lots of grief, lots of good companies and businesses going under.&rdquo;

<h3 id="the-battle-against-coronavirus-will-last-a-very-long-time-says-singapore-minister">The battle against coronavirus will last a &lsquo;very long time,&rsquo; says Singapore minister</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106475913-1586151581173gettyimages-1208943870.jpeg?v=1586313471" alt="img">
The economic cost and consequences of the coronavirus pandemic are going to be huge and the fight will last for a &ldquo;very long time,&rdquo; Singapore&rsquo;s minister for home affairs told CNBC. It is a crisis encompassing several generations and its consequences are likely to be far more serious than past financial crises, according to K. Shanmugam, who is also the law minister. &ldquo;We are fighting on the health front, but there&rsquo;s also a huge economic cost. The measures we take, we know that this fight, certainly the economic fight, will be for a very long time,&rdquo; he told CNBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Squawk Box&rdquo; on Wednesday. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking at economic devastation. Businesses destroyed, people&rsquo;s lives ruined, and in such a situation, you don&rsquo;t talk contract. You talk equity, you talk justice, you talk about what is the right thing to do,&rdquo; he added. A day earlier, Singapore&rsquo;s parliament passed a new bill that provides temporary relief to businesses and individuals if they are unable to fulfill their contractual obligations due to the coronavirus outbreak such as paying rent. They would be shielded from legal action for six months.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to take whatever steps that are necessary to make sure that the numbers are kept down. K. Shanmugam Singapore Minister for Home Affairs</p>
<p>&ldquo;The state has every right in such situations, if you look at precedent, to intervene in a temporary way, to give relief, hold the fort, allow people to take stock of their situation,&rdquo; Shanmugam said. He explained the measure would transfer liquidity from landlords to tenants and help distribute the economic pain more evenly. Still, the law minister explained that the contractual obligations were not abrogated, rather they were temporarily suspended until the situation improved. &ldquo;If you insist on your minutest every single contractual right at this point, that will suck the life out of the economy. You have got to protect everyone,&rdquo; Shanmugam added.</p>
<p>Singapore saw a spike in the number of reported cases starting in March when many residents returned from abroad. As of Tuesday noon, the city-state had at least 1,481 cases. Among them, six patients have died and 377 have been cured and discharged. To tackle the outbreak, Singapore adopted strict social distancing measures that include temporarily shutting all nonessential workplaces and closing schools for a month. People have also been asked to avoid socializing with others beyond their own households. The city-state has also introduced three stimulus packages worth around 12% of Singapore&rsquo;s GDP, or about $41.7 billion, to cushion the economic damage. The bill that was passed on Tuesday tightened restrictions further, and banned all types of social gatherings in public and private spaces and restricted the movement of people. It also makes a provision for the requisition of land, property or services needed to ramp up Singapore&rsquo;s health care capacity and public health capabilities. &ldquo;Members of the public are urged to stay home. There are good and necessary reasons for going out, and these will be allowed by the control order, but we would strongly urge everyone not to go out, except to purchase daily necessities, essential services, or for urgent medical needs,&rdquo; health minister Gan Kim Yong said in parliament.</p>

<h3 id="singapore-proposes-new-law-to-prep-for-general-election-amid-covid-19">Singapore proposes new law to prep for general election amid Covid-19</h3>
<p><img src="https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/04/07/634437.jpg" alt="img">
SINGAPORE (The Straits Times/ANN): If the general election were to be held during the Covid-19 outbreak, voters subject to restrictions like stay-home orders will be allowed to vote outside their electoral divisions, under a proposed law.</p>
<p>Aspiring candidates who are ill would also be allowed to register on Nomination Day without being there in person.</p>
<p>These are among the measures in the Parliamentary Elections (Covid-19 Special Arrangements) Bill introduced by Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing in Parliament on Tuesday (April 7).</p>
<p>The Bill, which is meant to facilitate the temporary arrangements necessary for holding a safe general election while Covid-19 measures are in effect, will also allow special steps to be taken in the interest of public health during polls and vote counting.</p>
<p>Responding on behalf of Chan to queries, the Elections Department (ELD) said: “This Bill forms part of ELD’s contingency planning for the next General Election. It is not related to the timing of the GE.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister will decide when to call the election, taking into account the challenges confronting our country, including the evolving Covid-19 situation.”</p>
<p>“The Government is fully focused on tackling Covid-19. Our immediate priorities include helping affected Singaporeans and companies, and implementing the circuit breaker measures to slow down the outbreak.”</p>
<p>The ELD also said in a statement that the provisions in the Bill are temporary arrangements that will only apply to the next General Election, and not to any election held after the stipulated date.</p>
<p>It added that the Bill forms part of its contingency planning for the next election, which has to be held by April 14,2021, and will allow it to make arrangements to ensure the safety of voters, candidates and election officials amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>Elaborating on the measures, the ELD said voters who are subject to stay orders, such as quarantine orders or stay-home notices, may vote at the designated facilities where they are serving out the orders, for instance. This ensures that they will not mingle with other voters at the polling stations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, aspiring candidates can nominate a representative to help them file their nomination papers if they are unable or unfit to do so because of a Covid-19 quarantine order or stay order, hospitalisation or ill health.</p>
<p>Under current laws, candidates have to file nomination papers in person.</p>
<p>Said the ELD: “The health and safety of voters, candidates and elections officials is paramount.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“ELD is reviewing our election processes, and putting in place the necessary precautionary measures, in compliance with prevailing advisories from the Ministry of Health.”</p>
<p>The Bill will be debated at the next available Parliament sitting, which is expected to take place next month.</p>
<p>If approved by Parliament, it will take effect before the next general election.</p>
<p>This means that Parliament is not likely to be dissolved during the &ldquo;circuit breaker&rdquo; measures. These curbs - the strictest to date - are in effect from April 7 until May 4. - The Straits Times/Asia News Network
