While Bollywood is yet to come to terms with the sudden demise of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, one thing that has become clear is that the life of a celebrity is never easy.</p>
<p>Always under the spotlight and public scrutiny, the air kisses and big bungalows are all a facade like the glamour and glitz that accompanies this profession.</p>
<p>Sushant was found dead in his sixth-floor apartment in Bandra (West) this afternoon. Police are investigating the case as a suicide. However, no ‘suicide note’ was found from his residence. He made his debut with Kai Po Che in 2013 and later starred in films such as Shuddh Desi Romance, PK, and MS Dhoni: The Untold Journey and Kedarnath. He was last seen in Netflix’s Drive. He made his acting debut with Zee TV serial Pavitra Rishta. MS Dhoni, in which he played the former Indian cricket team captain, was among the most successful film of 2016. He garnered critical acclaim for his role in Dibakar Banerjee’s 2015 movie, Detective Byomkesh Bakshy.</p>
<p>The B-town is mourning his death, which has brought back images of actors and filmmakers who had died under mysterious circumstances in the past.</p>
<ol>
<li>Guru Dutt</li>
</ol>
<p>Famous Indian actor, producer, and director, Guru Dutt died at an early age of 39 in October 1964. He was known for his classic films such as Pyaasa, Kagaz Ke Phool, Saheb Biwi Aur Gulam and many others. This legendary actor was found dead at his rented apartment at Pedder Road in Mumbai. There were rumours that he had a very turbulent married life which might have led to his death. Separated from his wife Geeta, he was living alone and was reportedly taking alcohol and sleeping pills together. Many speculations were made on whether it was a suicide attempt or an accidental overdose.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Parveen Babi</li>
</ol>
<p>The first Bollywood star to grace the cover of Time Magazine in 1976 was found dead in her home on January 22, 2005. Parveen featured in a number of Bollywood blockbusters throughout the ’70s and ’80s. The actress had been living an isolated life for many years prior to her death. Nobody knows for certain whether she committed suicide or if she died a natural death. She was rumoured to be suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Divya Bharti</li>
</ol>
<p>Twenty-seven years on, ’90s star Divya Bharti’s death still remains an unsolved mystery. Divya was all of 19 when she fell from her Mumbai apartment’s balcony to death on April 5, 1993.

<ol start="5">
<li>Silk Smitha</li>
</ol>
<p>While the country’s most erotic actress Silk Smitha’s professional life was going great guns, apparently her tragic personal life forced her to commit suicide on September 23, 1996.

<ol start="6">

<p>The peak stage of COVID-19 pandemic in India has been delayed by the eight-week lockdown along with strengthened public health measures and it may now arrive around mid-November during which there could be a paucity of isolation and ICU beds, and ventilators, according to a study. The study conducted by researchers from an Operations Research Group constituted by ICMR said the lockdown shifted the peak of the pandemic by an estimated 34 to 76 days and helped bring down the number of infections by 69 to 97 per cent thereby allowing time for the healthcare system to shore up resources and infrastructure.In the scenario of intensified public health measures with 60 per cent effectiveness after lockdown, the demand can be met until the first week of November. After that, isolation beds could be inadequate for 5.4 months, ICU beds for 4.6 and ventilators for 3.9 months, projections by the health researchers showed.However, this shortfall is estimated to be 83 per cent less than what it could have been without the lockdown and public health measures.With sustained government steps at increasing the infrastructure and different pace of epidemic in different regions, the impact of unmet need can be reduced. If the coverage of public health measures can be increased to 80 per cent, the epidemic can be mitigated, the researchers stated.According to the model-based analysis for COVID-19 pandemic in India, with the additional capacity which has been built up for testing, treating and isolating patients during the lockdown period, the number of cases at the peak would come down by 70 per cent and the cumulative cases may come down by nearly 27 per cent.In terms of COVID-19 mortality, approximately 60 per cent deaths were prevented and one-third of this mortality prevention is attributed to the reduction in unmet need for critical care as a result of the intervention, the analysis showed.The researchers said the management of COVID-19 will involve a dynamic review of policies and significant strengthening of the healthcare system.&ldquo;While lockdowns will delay the onset of peak and will give the much needed time for the health system to respond, strengthening the health system response in terms of testing, isolation of cases, treatment and contact tracing, as is being done currently, will have to be the mainstay to reduce the impact of the pandemic in India until vaccine becomes available,&rdquo; it said.The overall economic health system cost of this pandemic is estimated to be 6.2 per cent of India&rsquo;s(GDP).The country saw a record spike of 11,929 cases pushing India&rsquo;s COVID-19 caseload to 3,20,922 on Sunday while the death toll rose to 9,195 with an increase of 311 fatalities, according to the Union Health Ministry data.India registered more than 10,000 cases for the third day in a row and is the fourth worst-hit nation by the COVID-19 pandemic.The ministry on June 9 said coronavirus related health infrastructure in the country has been strengthened with the availability of 958 dedicated COVID-19 hospitals with 1,67,883 isolation beds, 21,614 ICU and 73,469 oxygen supported beds.Also, 2,313 dedicatedwith 1,33,037 isolation beds, 10,748 ICU beds and 46,635 oxygen supported beds have also been operationalised. Moreover, 7,525 COVID Care Centres with 7,10,642 beds are now available to combat COVID-19 in the country.The ventilators available for COVID beds are 21,494, the ministry had said, adding that order of 60,848 more ventilators has been placed.

AHMEDABAD: India is not interested in land of Pakistan or China but wanted peace and amity, Union minister and senior BJP leader Nitin Gadkari said on Sunday.Addressing virtual &lsquo;Jan Samvad&rsquo; rally of Gujarat BJP from Nagpur in Maharashtra, he said India believed in peace and non-violence and do not want to be strong by becoming an expansionist.&ldquo;India never tried to grab land of its neighbours like Bhutan and Bangladesh,&rdquo; he added.The Minister of Road Transport &amp; Highways and MSME also said that Covid-19 crisis will not last long, as a vaccine is on its way soon.&ldquo;India do not want land of either Pakistan or China. All India want is peace, amity, love, and (want) to work together (with neighbouring countries),&rdquo; Gadkari said.His comments came at a time when India and China are engaged in a stand-off at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.Talking about the completion of one year of the second term of the Modi government, Gadkari said its biggest achievement was to bring peace in the country by dealing with matters of internal and external security.&quot;&hellip;Whether it is about almost winning over the Maoist problem or securing the country from Pakistan-sponsored terrorism&hellip;There is China on the one side of our border and Pakistan on the other side. We want peace, not violence,&rdquo; he said.During his speech, the Nagpur MP referred to famous novel &ldquo;Mrityunjaya&rdquo; by Marathi novelist Shivaji Sawant , saying peace and non-violence can be established by only those who are strong and not weak.&ldquo;We should not make India strong by becoming expansionist. We want to make India strong for establishing peace. We never tried to grab land of Bhutan. Our country made Sheikh Mujibur Rahman the prime minister of Bangladesh after winning the war (with Pakistan in 1971), and our soldiers returned thereafter.&ldquo;We took not a single inch of land. We do not want land either of Pakistan or China. All we want is peace, amity, love, and wanted to work together,&rdquo; he said.Gadkari also said the coronavirus crisis will not last long as scientists in India and abroad have been working to develop a vaccine.&ldquo;This crisis is not going to last long. Effort is on in our country to develop a vaccine for coronavirus. Scientists across the world are working in this direction.As per the information received by me, I can say with confidence that very soon we will find vaccine. Once we develop a vaccine, we won&rsquo;t have to fear the crisis, Gadkari added.As per the Union Health ministry, India saw the highest single-day spike of 11,929 novel coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, taking the number of infections to over 3.20 lakh on Sunday, while the toll crossed the 9,000 mark with 311 more deaths.
