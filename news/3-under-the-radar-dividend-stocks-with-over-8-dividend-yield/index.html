What’s the most important investment metric an investor can focus on in the midst of a downturn? My vote is cash flow. It’s actually a great thing to track during any economic cycle – it just becomes especially important when a firm’s sales and profits head south when the business climate turns turbulent.</p>
<p>Don’t just take my word for it. A quote attributed to market guru Michael Mauboussin is that “great fundamental investors focus on understanding the magnitude and sustainability of free cash flow.”</p>
<p>Income-minded investors, such as retirees looking to supplement their social security checks with, could have some real opportunities to pick up bargains during the current market dip. It’s obviously difficult to determine if we already have or will soon hit bottom in the current downturn, but it’s fair to say that many companies will survive with their dividend payments intact.</p>
<p>Using TipRanks database, we&rsquo;ve narrowed down three stocks that have well above-average dividend yields right now. In fact, the current reported yields are above 8%, or between four and five times the stock market (as measured by the S&amp;P 500) average of closer to 2%. The sustainability of their payouts obviously depend on how long the economy remains in standby mode as social-distancing is utilized to fight off the covid-19 pandemic, but there appears to be ample cushion for the below players, based off of recent historical financials and analyst expectations.</p>
<p>Simon Property (SPG)</p>
<p>Indianapolis-based Simon Property is a bellwether Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) and bona fide leader in leasing out mall-based retail space. It is also in the midst of acquiring rival Taubman Centers to further consolidate its leading position.</p>
<p>In each of the last three years Simon has generated around $3 billion in free cash flow. That’s almost unheard of in the REIT space where companies very often either spend the vast majority of their operating cash flow on acquisitions or maintaining and improving their existing properties.</p>
<p>Simon does pay out most of its free cash flow in the form of partnership distributions, which is its dividend. For the last three years it amounted to $2.9 billion, $2.8 billion, and $2.6 billion. But even if that were cut during the current downturn, it’s hard to see it falling significantly from current levels over the long haul. Overall, Simon pays out $2.05 per quarter. At $8.40 annualized, the dividend gives a yield of 13.53%, which is more than 5 times higher than the average dividend in the S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s Derek Johnson believes Simon will “navigate the continuing retail evolution while maintaining an industry leading balance sheet which is poised to withstand the COVID-19 disruption and fund the (re)development pipeline with $7.0B of incremental liquidity.”</p>
<p>Johnson recently upgraded his rating on Simon to Buy from Hold. He also has a price target of $120, which is more than double the current share price of $58 per share. That would be quite a share price performance, in addition to the well above-average dividend payment. (To watch Johnson&rsquo;s track record, click here)</p>
<p>Based on 12 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 6 rate a Buy on SPG stock, while 6 maintain a Hold. The 12-month average price target stands at $134.25, marking a nearly 130% upside from where the stock is currently trading. (See Simon stock analysis on TipRanks)</p>

<h3 id="watch-out-for-dividend-stock-yield-traps-during-the-coronavirus-crisis">Watch out for dividend-stock ‘yield traps’ during the coronavirus crisis</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/images/MW-ID330_knotts_ZG_20200330110131.jpg" alt="img">
The sharp and fast decline of stock prices during the coronavirus outbreak means dividend yields have risen considerably. Meanwhile, the flight to quality and Federal Reserve policy have pushed down U.S. Treasury bond rates.</p>
<p>Taken together, these factors point to dividend stocks as attractive income plays. However, you need to be more focused on your own research to avoid yield traps.</p>
<p>B. Riley FBR analyst Eric Wold looked at 11 dividend-paying companies in the media, entertainment and outdoor-leisure industries and rated their likelihood of dividend cuts from “none” to “high.” We’ll start with this list and then consider potential large-cap yield traps lower down.</p>
<p>What is a yield trap?</p>
<p>A potential yield trap is a stock of a dividend-paying company that has fallen more quickly than the company’s earnings have fallen, making the shares appear attractive on a price-to-earnings basis and on a yield basis. No matter how much the share price has fallen before you buy, if the company subsequently cuts the dividend, the shares can be crushed, and your investment value along with it — and you lose part or all of the dividend that drew you to the shares.</p>
<p>And as far as earnings go, they cannot be predicted at this point — we’re too early in the financial crisis. So price-to-earnings ratios are essentially meaningless for the time being.</p>
<p>The B. Riley FBR list</p>
<p>Wold looked at 11 small-cap media, entertainment and outdoor-leisure companies and assigned dividend-cut probabilities of “none,” “low,” “medium” and “high.”</p>
<p>Let’s accentuate the positive and begin with two companies whose likelihood of cutting dividends on common shares is “none” according to Wold, who has “buy” ratings on both:</p>
<p>Company Ticker Dividend yield Price decline - 2020 Industry Dolby Laboratories Inc. Class A DLB, +1.96% 1.63% -22% Movies/Entertainment InterDigital Inc. IDCC, +3.50% 3.13% -18% Telecommunications Equipment Sources: B. Riley FBR, FactSet</p>
<p>• Wold believes Dolby Laboratories DLB, +1.96% can “push through any potential spending slowdown” because its Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos systems have become “de facto standards” as the company has achieved an “annual doubling of volumes” for the past three years.</p>
<p>• “Keep in mind that ~90% of [InterDigital’s IDCC, +3.50% ] license revenues are derived from fixed-fee license agreements — mainly with Apple, Samsung and LG — that are not impacted by unit volumes or timing,” Wold wrote.</p>
<p>Here are three companies Wold believes have a “low” risk of cutting dividends. He has a neutral rating on Marcus MCS, +1.35% , but “buy” ratings for Xperi XPER, +1.25% and Brunswick BC, +0.87% :</p>
<p>Company Ticker Dividend yield Price decline - 2020 Industry Marcus Corp. MCS, +1.35% 5.43% -61% Movies/Entertainment Xperi Corp. XPER, +1.25% 5.90% -27% Semiconductors Brunswick Corp. BC, +0.87% 2.69% -41% Recreational Products Sources: B. Riley FBR, FactSet</p>
<p>• Marcus has closed all its theaters so it isn’t generating any revenue. But the company owns 62% of its theaters,giving it an advantage over competitors, according to Wold. He sees “a low risk to the dividend being cut given the significant flexibility in cap-ex spending with the company’s owned theaters (that could make the annual cash flow shortfall minimum).”</p>
<p>• For Xperi, Wold sees “multiple upside scenarios,” and also wrote that B. Riley FBR’s free cash flow projections are “well ahead” of where they need to be to cover annual dividend payments.</p>
<p>• Brunswick has suspended production of boats and engines, but has continued to produce parts and accessories. Wold sees little risk to the dividend because of the company’s efforts to reduce debt and cut expenses before the coronavirus crisis, and also because his free cash flow projections for 2020 and 2021 are well above the dividend.</p>
<p>Here are four companies that Wold believes are at “medium risk” for cutting dividends; he has neutral ratings on all of them except for his “buy” rating for National CineMedia:</p>
<p>Company Ticker Dividend yield Price decline - 2020 Industry Cinemark Holdings Inc. CNK, -17.88% 11.71% -64% Movies/Entertainment National CineMedia Inc. NCMI, +2.93% 24.76% -58% Advertising/Marketing Services Marine Products Corp. MPX, +5.37% 5.61% -41% Recreational Products Six Flags Entertainment Corp. SIX, -9.89% 7.17% -69% Movies/Entertainment Sources: B. Riley FBR, FactSet</p>
<p>• Cinemark Holdings CNK, -17.88% is another theater operator with no revenue as long as its theaters are closed. B. Riley FBR estimates the company’s 2020 free cash flow won’t cover its dividend.</p>
<p>• National CineMedia NCMI, +2.93% produces pre-show advertisements used in movie theaters, so it is earning no revenue as theaters remain closed. B. Riley FBR estimates the company’s free cash flow this year will be less than its dividend payout.</p>
<p>• Marine Products MPX, +5.37% hasn’t cut production, but B. Riley FBR expects a 15% decline in sales over the next 12 months, and another 10% decline over the subsequent 12-month period. The firm expects free cash flow to cover the dividend this year and next year. However, “a potential recession could drive the company’s board to take another look at the dividend,” Wold wrote.</p>
<p>Here are the two companies Wold covers that he believes are at “high” risk of cutting dividends. He has neutral ratings for both:</p>
<p>Company Ticker Dividend yield Price decline - 2020 Industry AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. Class A AMC, -15.55% 3.33% -50% Movies/Entertainment Cedar Fair LP FUN, -14.38% 16.50% -59% Movies/Entertainment Source: FactSet</p>
<p>• AMC Entertainment Holdings AMC, -15.55% cut its dividend by 85% last month. But B. Riley FBR projects that free cash flow will still not cover this year’s remaining payout.</p>
<p>• Cedar Fair’s FUN, -14.38% theme parks are closed, which means there’s no revenue. Even if the company is able to reopen theme parks in mid-May, B. Riley FBR projects its 2020 free cash flow will only cover half the dividend.</p>
<p>Financial crisis</p>
<p>As identified COVID-19 cases in the U.S. rise rapidly, and a frightening death toll mounting, we appear still to be in an early state of the health crisis. But we are probably at an even earlier stage in the financial crisis. The S&amp;P 500 Index SPX, +3.35% hit its record high on Feb. 19 — the forward-looking stock market was more than halfway through the first quarter. Unemployment claims rose dramatically for the week ended March 21. The number of new claims may remain at a similarly elevated level for several weeks.</p>
<p>A potential place for dividend traps</p>
<p>Consider one industry: energy. The decision of Saudi Arabia and Russia to fight an oil price war by increasing production at this time is really an attack on the U.S. shale oil industry, with its massive production but relatively high expenses. The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil CL00, +3.03% continuous contract quote was down 65% for 2020 to $21.51 a barrel on March 27.</p>
<p>On March 30, Jack Allardyce, an oil and gas analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, said: “With major producers pumping barrels freely and the IEA (International Energy Agency) suggesting that short-term demand could fall by a fifth due to travel restrictions, global storage is likely to hit capacity over the next two to three months. This is likely to be particularly damaging for U.S. crude, with prices in the Permian region potentially hitting single digits.” The italics are mine.</p>
<p>This means we are likely to see a tremendous wave of additional unemployment claims as domestic oil producers try to cut production as quickly as possible. Many energy companies have already made moves to build up and preserve cash — drawing credit lines, cutting capital expenditures, suspending share buybacks and lowering or suspending dividends.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s obvious that the weaker energy players will cut their dividends. But what about the old standbys?</p>
<p>Among large-cap stocks, Exxon XOM, +1.48% and Chevron CVX, +4.60% have traditionally been considered safe-and-steady dividend payers. But Exxon’s dividend yield had shot up to 9.42% at the close on March 27, after its shares had declined 55% from the end of 2019. Chevron’s dividend yield was 7.50%, with its shares also down 55% for 2020. In a market environment with such low interest rates, these very high yields indicate a lack of confidence among a good proportion of investors that even these dividends are at risk.</p>
<p>Both companies are components of the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index SP50DIV, -10.67% and held by the ProShares S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF NOBL, +3.47% , because they have increased annual regular dividend payouts for at least 25 consecutive years. Both continued to raise their annual dividends through the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Both managed to do the same when oil pries crashed 67%, from a high (for that cycle) of $107.68 on June 13, 2014 through a cycle bottom of $26.05 on Feb. 11, 2016.</p>
<p>Can they do so again during this cycle, with oil prices already dropping through the 2016 low? Can they do it if the Saudi and Russian governments continue to refuse to play ball and we hit the single digits? Might they be tempted not only to cut capital expenditures and stop buying back shares to shore up their balance sheets and possibly limit layoffs, but to also cut dividend payouts as well? After all, Exxon paid $14.65 billion in dividends during 2019, while Chevron paid out $8.96 billion.</p>
<p>In fairness, Exxon and Chevron are probably the safest dividend-payers in the oil patch. Chevron was included on a list of stocks that analysts at Jefferies said investors could be “practically stealing” at discounted prices because of the companies’ high quality. Pavel Molchanov, an analyst with Raymond James, said two weeks ago that it would be “virtually unthinkable” for either company to cut their dividend.</p>
<p>But the COVID-19 outbreak, paired with an increase in oil production by Saudi Arabia while global demand is dropping so dramatically, was also “unthinkable” only a few months ago.

<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/imx98aumCbENtvDy6BpJmg--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/Benzinga/2d53eff7ecd67424227aaecdc7e8b752" alt="img">
Dividends are periodic payments a company makes to shareholders out of the profits it generates, provided it has a dividend policy. They assure a stable, steady stream of returns to shareholders — unlike capital gains, which are subject to fluctuations triggered by company-specific and extraneous factors.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic and its impact on companies has put this steady stream of income at risk.</p>
<p>Unable to cough up cash to meet dividend payments at a time when businesses are reeling to keep operations going, several companies have announced suspension of dividends or pauses of stock buybacks.</p>
<p>Dividends In Value Vs. Growth Investing</p>
<p>To compare the returns of a stock, a metric called dividend yield is used. Dividend yield is the amount of dividend paid by a company for a year, divided by its current stock price and expressed in percentage terms.</p>
<p>Value stocks — stocks that are trading at a lower price relative to their fundamentals — invariably have a higher dividend yield. Most value stocks belong to mature companies that can afford to pay dividends due to their strong cash flows.</p>
<p>Unlike value stocks, growth stocks are mostly up-and-coming companies that do not have the luxury of steady cash flows to fund dividend payouts. Even if their cash flows support payouts, they would often rather invest in growth opportunities than on dividends. Investors in these companies rely on capital gains or share price appreciation to realize returns.</p>
<p>Due to the high P/E ratios of these companies, their dividend payouts tend to be lower.</p>

<p>Dividend Plays In Favor Amid Pandemic Uncertainty</p>
<p>The pandemic that has cut across continents has dimmed the outlook for economy. Goldman Sachs recently lowered its U.S. GDP forecast for the first quarter to zero and for the second quarter to negative 5%.</p>
<p>The labor market is in doldrums. First-time claims for unemployment benefits in the U.S. shot up to a staggering 3.283 million in the week ended March 21, with the previous record set in October 1982 reading only 695,000, according to a report from the Department of Labor.</p>
<p>The data underlines the severity of the pcrisis. Most economists expect incremental doses of negative news in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People can&rsquo;t go to work, people can&rsquo;t go shopping, and large sections of the economy (airlines, hotels, restaurants, and most retail stores) have simply shut down,&rdquo; said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are the direct job losses that are now showing up. Over time, they will be followed by the indirect jobs losses in companies that support these companies. It will be a long process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Personal incomes have taken a hit due to layoffs.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, Investing in safe, stable dividend stocks could help to some extent to augment dwindling finances until the economy recovers.</p>

<p>S&amp;P 500 companies</p>
<p>Those that haven&rsquo;t already announced a dividend cut</p>
<p>Those that are relatively immune to the ongoing turmoil and therefore likely to leave dividends unscathed</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>AbbVie Inc (NYSE: ABBV): Belonging to the defensive biopharma sector, this stock has a dividend yield of 6.3%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>H &amp; R Block Inc (NYSE: HRB): This tax preparation company&rsquo;s dividend yield is 7.27% and is considered relatively safe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IBM (NYSE: IBM): This tech conglomerate generated cash flow of $11.9 billion in 2019 and paid out about $5.7 billion in dividends. The dividend yield of 5.82% is therefore considered stable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Altria Group Inc (NYSE: MO) has a dividend yield of 9%. This tobacco maker is well-positioned to weather any volume-related setbacks, thanks to its premium products. Its investment in pot company Cronos Group Inc (NASDAQ: CRON) could provide additional cushion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE: PM): Altria&rsquo;s peer Philip Morris, with a dividend yield of 6.49%, is also considered a safe bet as far as dividends are concerned. Its dividend coverage ratio — a measure of how many times dividends are covered by earnings — is fairly high.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE: T): The telecom giant has a dividend yield of 6.93% and has the distinction of raising its dividend for 35 straight years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Molson Coors Beverage Co (NYSE: TAP): This brewer offers a dividend yield of 5.75%. The company withdrew its financial guidance last week, although it did not hint at any plans to suspend shareholder returns. The recent quarterly report revealed free cash flow of about $1.4 billion.</p>
