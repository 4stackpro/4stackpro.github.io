For better or worse, Tiger King has captured the internet’s attention with larger-than-life characters and salacious murder allegations. Netflix’s documentary series hit at just the right time, and it seems like everyone is talking about Joe Exotic and Carole Baskin. The streaming service is dropping another episode on Sunday — a wrap-up show hosted by Joel McHale — but if Tiger King has you jonesing for more bizarre true-crime stories, there’s a practical avalanche of options, both on Netflix and beyond.</p>
<p>While Netflix seems to be churning out a new true crime series every day, other streaming services have their share of excellent documentaries. To help you narrow down your options, we’ve rounded up 10 of the best documentary series about shocking, sad, or just plain strange crimes available to stream right now.</p>
<p>The Case Against Adnan Syed</p>
<p>The podcast Serial was a phenomenon that kicked off a true-crime wave. Public discourse around the questions that host Sarah Koenig raised about convicted murderer Adnan Syed’s guilt or innocence was so compelling that a Baltimore state court reopened the 1999 case. HBO’s 2019 documentary reexamines the crime over four episodes, with new interviews, a larger focus on the murdered high-schooler, Hae Min Lee, and an update on developments in Syed’s appeals.</p>
<p>The Case Against Adnan Syed is streaming on HBO. (Also available as an Amazon or Hulu add-on.)</p>
<p>Don’t F**k with Cats</p>
<p>If the animal exploitation exposed in Tiger King was too much for you to handle, you may want to skip Don’t F**k with Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer. The Netflix documentary focuses on amateur internet sleuths who investigate a disturbing video in which a man is seen torturing and killing two kittens. But if you can stomach it (the documentary doesn’t show the actual torture,) the story is a wild ride.</p>
<p>Don’t F**k with Cats is streaming on Netflix.</p>
<p>Evil Genius</p>
<p>The story of a bizarre 2003 bank robbery known as “the pizza bomber heist” is explored in the four-part Netflix documentary, Evil Genius. The titular evil genius is Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong, whose plan to send a pizza delivery driver into a bank with a bomb strapped to his chest is just one part of an elaborate conspiracy. Produced by Mark and Jay Duplass (who also produced Netflix’s Wild Wild Country,) Evil Genius explores the strange case 15 years later.</p>
<p>Evil Genius is streaming on Netflix.</p>
<p>How to Fix a Drug Scandal</p>
<p>Netflix’s latest true-crime documentary (all four episodes dropped on April 1) tells the story of Sonja Farak, a Massachusetts crime lab employee who was arrested in 2013 for sampling the drugs she was supposed to be processing. The personal drama is interesting enough — why would an successful woman jeopardize her important career by experimenting with meth? — but the systemic issues it raises are even more troubling. After Farak’s arrest, incarcerated felons whose convictions were based on evidence that her lab processed tried to have their cases reexamined. The documentary explores both sides of the story, complete with courtroom reenactments.</p>
<p>How to Fix a Drug Scandal is streaming on Netflix.</p>
<p>The Jinx</p>
<p>If you haven’t yet watched The Jinx (and somehow missed the conversation surrounding its 2015 release), stop reading and go watch it. Spoilers follow.</p>
<p>For everyone else, here’s a refresher: The Jinx is known for its shocking ending in which the subject, Robert Durst, seemingly confesses to several murders, including that of his friend Susan Berman. The FBI arrested Durst immediately after the documentary aired, and his trial was finally set to begin in March 2020. Now that proceedings have been paused due to social distancing around the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s the perfect time to revisit the wild story.</p>
<p>The Jinx is streaming on HBO. (Also available as an Amazon or Hulu add-on.)</p>
<p>Lorena</p>
<p>Jordan Peele produced this Amazon Prime documentary about Lorena Bobbitt, who became tabloid and late-night joke fodder in the 1990s when she cut off her abusive husband’s penis. Sixteen years later, the four-part series features interviews with both Lorena (who know goes by Lorena Gallo) and her ex-husband, John Wayne Bobbitt, as well as friends and family who recall the 1993 incident and salacious fallout. Documentarian Joshua Rofé attempted to reexamine the human beings behind the scandal, especially shining a light on what life was like for Gallo following her arrest.</p>
<p>Lorena is streaming on Amazon Prime.</p>
<p>McMillions</p>
<p>The McDonalds Monopoly cheating scandal gets the true-crime documentary treatment with HBO’s McMillions. While the subjects aren’t as wacky as those in Tiger King, McMillions has its share of colorful characters, from a wise-cracking FBI agent to a chain-smoking mob wife. As a caper, the story is pretty wild in its own right, and the documentary’s tone is much lighter than many true crime docs.</p>
<p>McMillions is streaming on HBO. (Also available as an Amazon or Hulu add-on.)</p>
<p>OJ: Made in America</p>
<p>ESPN’s five-part documentary in its 30 for 30 series was also released theatrically, and won the 2017 Best Documentary Oscar. The series examines OJ Simpson’s football career, his 1994 arrest for the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman, and his post-acquittal life. The documentary frames Simpson in the context of race and celebrity, especially in Los Angeles in the 1990s. (And then look out for ESPN’s Michael Jordan documentary, which premieres on April 19.)</p>
<p>OJ: Made in America is streaming on ESPN Plus.</p>
<p>The Pharmacist</p>
<p>A grieving father who lost his son to a drug-related shooting takes on the pharmaceutical industry in Netflix’s documentary, The Pharmacist. While the opioid crisis can feel too massive to fit the true-crime formula, focusing on Dan Schneider’s one-man crusade helps to ground the story. The four-part series examines how Schneider, himself a pharmacist, channeled his grief into investigating a “pill mill” doctor. The series is all the more tragic when you realize that the investigation took place over 15 years ago and the opioid crisis is still one of the most devastating issues facing Americans today.</p>
<p>The Pharmacist is streaming on Netflix.</p>
<p>20/20</p>
<p>ABC’s long-running news magazine show doesn’t always cover true crime, but with three seasons currently streaming on Hulu, there are plenty of true crime episodes to choose from. Especially worth checking out is “The Dropout,” the two-hour episode on Elizabeth Holmes’ Theranos scam, which is getting a scripted TV adaptation (coincidentally also starring Kate McKinnon, who reportedly will portray Carole Baskin in a Tiger King series).</p>
<p>20/20 is streaming on Hulu.

Someone put arsenic in the coffee after a church service in New Sweden, Maine — sickening several congregants and killing one. I was sent up there in 2003 by The Boston Globe, to the far reaches of Aroostook County. It was both quaint and horrific, someone trying to kill their neighbors. Eventually, it emerged that one of the ushers had done it, as revenge for losing a theological battle. As the population in that area drained away, two small Lutheran churches were consolidated into one. Identical to outsiders, the two churches had what was for them a deeply significant doctrinal difference. In one, the priest faced the congregation when blessing the host; in the other, the priest faced the altar. The poisoner had lost that battle. He ultimately killed himself. It was a grim story about the dilemmas of those stretches of our country that are losing population, having to let go of their particular identity.

<h3 id="the-best-true-crime-podcasts-to-listen-to">The best true crime podcasts to listen to</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article18075862.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Rachel-Fairburn-left-and-Kiri-Pritchard-McLean-right-who-record-a-podcast-about-serial-killers.jpg" alt="img">
True crime is massive right now.</p>
<p>You only have to look at the number of Netflix Originals series that are being churned out to see that the genre has exploded in recent years.</p>
<p>Making a Murderer, Mindhunter, Manhunt: Unabomber, The Confession Tapes and Evil Genius, to name a few, offer up some pretty incredible TV that has viewers gripped from the start.</p>
<p>And then there’s Don’t F**k With Cats and Abducted in Plain Sight… you’ll need a lie down after watching those two.</p>
<p>But TV is no good when you’ve got stuff to do, such as housework or exercise - or in those times you just want to have a lie down and give your eyes a rest.</p>
<p>This is where podcasts come in.</p>
<p>They offer something more than reading a book or listening to the radio - allowing the listener to immerse themselves into a story that will likely make their hair stand on end.</p>
<p>It’s exactly the kind of distraction we need right now.</p>
<p>Here are some of the best.</p>
<p>Serial</p>
<p>(Image: Irvine Herald)</p>
<p>No true crime podcast list would be complete without a mention of Serial.</p>
<p>The series, hosted by journalist Sarah Koenig from This American Life, rose to fame after series one, which investigated the 1999 murder of Hae Min Lee, an 18-year-old student at Woodlawn High School in Baltimore, Maryland.</p>
<p>Released in 2014, the podcast followed the criminal trial of her ex-boyfriend Adnan Sayed, who was convicted of her murder, and raised serious questions around the original case.</p>
<p>So much so it aided Adnan&rsquo;s plea for a retrial after a court found his attorney was ineffective first time round.</p>
<p>The addictive nature of the series, which weaves interviews with Sayed from his prison cell as well as other key witnesses, led to it being downloaded more than 80 million times by 2016.</p>
<p>But don’t disregard series two and three - they’re also compelling pieces of journalism that you won’t be able to turn off.</p>
<p>Listen here.</p>
<p>S-Town</p>
<p>Serial’s lesser known little sister, S-Town is an investigative journalism podcast hosted by Brian Reed.</p>
<p>What starts as a seven-part true crime series turns into more of a biography that follows the story of a man named John B McLemore, who despises his Alabama town (the ‘S’ in the title stands for ‘sh*t’).</p>
<p>After getting in touch with Brian and asking him to investigate the son of a wealthy family who&rsquo;s allegedly been bragging that he got away with murder, the story throws in a twist you probably won’t foresee.</p>
<p>Without giving too much away, you’ll hear about how the search for the truth leads to a serious dispute, the search for hidden treasure, and how it all fits in with the enigma of one man’s life.</p>
<p>Listen here.</p>
<p>All Killa No Filla</p>
<p>(Image: MEN UGC)</p>
<p>What better way to offer up a true story about a murderer than from a pair of comedians?</p>
<p>Rachel Fairburn and Kiri Pritchard-McLean host this crime-comedy podcast which focuses on the story of a notorious serial killer - such as Peter Sutcliffe, aka The Yorkshire Ripper, and Ted Bundy.</p>
<p>The women delve into the lives of the perpetrator but also offer some commentary around it, so it doesn’t feel scripted like a lot of American offerings.</p>
<p>And because of this, you can expect plenty of funny, sweary tangents about the women’s own lives and observations - it’s perhaps not one for purists who want a more traditional, serious listen.</p>
<p>But it’s perfect for those of us that want to feel connected to those telling the story, learn about a pretty heinous crime, and have a laugh along the way.</p>
<p>Listen here.</p>
<p>Dateline</p>
<p>NBC’s Dateline is a staple podcast for many true crime fans.</p>
<p>The American series is based on the long-standing TV programme of the same name, so you can expect some immersive and powerful storytelling.</p>
<p>You can stream current and classic episodes which feature a mix of compelling true crime mysteries, powerful documentaries and in-depth investigations.</p>
<p>Episodes are mostly stand alone stories, although some are spaced out over several, and the best thing is, there’s loads of them, so there’s plenty of opportunities to get your fix.</p>
<p>Randomly, there’s even a recently uploaded 15 minute bonus interview episode with Tiger King Joe Exotic, who spoke to Dateline’s Josh Mankiewicz shortly after his April 2019 conviction on two counts of murder for hire.</p>
<p>Listen here.</p>
<p>In the Dark</p>
<p>Like Serial, In The Dark managed to uncover how law enforcement mishandled a case - in this instance, one of the most notorious child abductions in America.</p>
<p>When Jacob Wetterling, 11, was taken in 1989, authorities launched what would turn into one of the largest searches for any missing person in the history of the United States.</p>
<p>But on the crucial first night following the abduction, law enforcement didn&rsquo;t cover all the basics.</p>
<p>The 10-episode series looks at how the failures by the state fuelled national anxiety about &lsquo;stranger danger&rsquo;, led to the nation&rsquo;s sex-offender registries and raises questions about crime-solving effectiveness and accountability.</p>
<p>Listen here.</p>
<p>Paradise</p>
<p>(Image: Manchester Evening News)</p>
<p>The BBC 5 Live series follows the murders of Chris Farmer and his girlfriend Peta Frampton, who left Manchester to travel the world in 1977.</p>
<p>They would never come home.</p>
<p>It transpired that Silas Duane Boston hogtied the young couple, covered their faces with plastic bags, weighed them down with enormous metal gears and pushed them off his boat to their deaths.</p>
<p>His sons Vince and Russell, then aged just 12 and 13, watched on helplessly.</p>
<p>The story of the couple’s tragic fate, their family&rsquo;s decades-long search for answers, the bravery of the killer&rsquo;s two sons, and how he escaped justice after an evil past, are all told in this podcast.</p>
<p>Speaking to BBC 5 Live journalists Dan Maudsley and Stephen Nolan for Paradise, the podcast about the case, Vince recalls in graphic detail what happened next.</p>
<p>Listen on BBC Sounds.</p>
<p>Wrongful Conviction: False Confession</p>
<p>As the title suggests, coerced and false confessions are what this podcast focuses on, and the wrongful convictions that follow.</p>
<p>The programme is hosted by attorneys Laura Nirider and Steve Drizin, who you might remember as being central figures in the aforementioned docuseries Making a Murderer.</p>
<p>Wrongful Conviction: False Confession features stories about normal people who find themselves caught in a web of injustice that sees them on the business end of an interrogation.</p>
<p>An interrogation so intense, the only way out of it is to admit to a crime they didn’t commit.</p>
<p>You only have to watch Brendan Dassey’s controversial interrogation on Making a Murderer to see just what you’d be up against.</p>
<p>Laura and Steve represented Brendan, whose confession played a key role in his convicton for being party to first-degree murder, mutilation of a corpse, and second-degree sexual assault with his uncle Steven Avery.</p>
<p>Speaking about the podcast, Laura said: “We bring you inside the fight to exonerate these innocent people.”</p>
<p>Listen here.</p>
<p>Redhanded</p>
<p>Another British podcast that has a very different feel to some of its more serious American counterparts.</p>
<p>Redhanded is the result of two women, Suruthi and Hannah, who bonded at a party over their love of true crime.</p>
<p>But this podcast is not just about serial killers - our hosts also cover hauntings, possessions, disturbing mysteries and bizarre whodunits.</p>
<p>You can tell that Suruthi and Hannah are pals - Redhanded has a relaxed narrative where the presenters offer a little glimpse into their own lives before getting down to the nitty gritty.</p>
<p>And they’re not afraid to throw in the occasional swear word, just in case you’re of a sensitive persuasion.</p>
<p>So if you’re after something that sounds less formal and scripted, this could be the podcast for you.</p>
<p>Listen here.</p>
<p>Unsolved Murders</p>
<p>As you can tell by the title, this one is a little different as it delves into cold cases and the murders that remain unsolved.</p>
<p>The hosts take listeners on a weekly journey through a crime scene and investigation, before attempting to solve the case.</p>
<p>There’s even a two-parter dedicated to former heavyweight champion Sonny Liston, whose mysterious death has haunted the boxing world for decades.</p>
<p>When Sonny’s wife Geraldine Liston hadn’t heard from him for a few days, she didn’t think much of it… until she returned to their Las Vegas home and found him dead at the foot of their bed.</p>
<p>A coroner ruled that he died of natural causes - but this podcast offers interviews and evidence that throws doubt around the circumstances surrounding Sonny&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Listen here.
