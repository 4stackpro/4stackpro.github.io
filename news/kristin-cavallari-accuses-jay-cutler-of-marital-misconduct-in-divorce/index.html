Exclusive</p>
<p>Kristin Cavallari just dropped some sad and actually shocking news &hellip; she and Jay Cutler are throwing in the towel on their decade-long relationship.</p>
<p>Kristin just said, &ldquo;With great sadness, after 10 years together we have come to a loving conclusion to get a divorce. We have nothing but love and respect for one another and are deeply grateful for the years shared, memories made, and the children we are so proud of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wanted to make it clear &hellip; nothing untoward happened &ndash; &ldquo;This is just the situation of two people growing apart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kristin and Jay met during a Chicago Bears preseason game back in 2010. They married in 2013. They had a son, Camden Jack, who was born in 2012 and another son, Jaxon Wyatt, who was born in 2014, followed by a daughter, Saylor James, born the following year.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first split for the couple, remember back in 2011 Culter called off their engagement. However, they reconciled and got married in June 2013.</p>
<p>Both Kristin and Jay have been super successful. Obviously, he made a fortune &ndash; $122 mil &ndash; QB&rsquo;ing for the Bears and the Miami Dolphins, and she&rsquo;s got a reality show, a jewelry company and lots of other stuff.</p>
<p>They were really a fun couple &hellip; notably, Kristin showed off Jay&rsquo;s butt during a vacation.</p>
<p>They live in Nashville, but they were chronicling their self-isolation in the Bahamas over the last few weeks with their kids. They couldn&rsquo;t get a flight off the island. They finally went home last Monday.

<p><img src="https://imagez.tmz.com/image/ab/16by9/2020/04/26/ab40063ec49b4a64a004aad4dc68a8ae_xl.jpg" alt="img">
Breaking News</p>
<p>According to a police affidavit, the officer claims King was the passenger in a white Ford F-250 and in possession of a .380 caliber. According to the docs, a juvenile witness in the car told cops King did, in fact, put the gun out the window and fired multiple rounds from the moving vehicle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Duck Dynasty&rdquo; star Willie Robertson&rsquo;s home was the center of a massive shooting this week, where someone drove by and sprayed his home with bullets &hellip; in broad daylight.</p>
<p>The drive-by took place Friday at Willie&rsquo;s estate in West Monroe, Louisiana &ndash; where several of his family members are staying right now during the coronavirus, including his wife, Korie, his son, John Luke, and his wife and infant child &hellip; as well as Willie&rsquo;s daughter, Sadie, and her own husband. He told local media 8 to 10 bullets hit the home.</p>
<p>Luckily, nobody was harmed during the shooting &ndash; for which Willie himself says he was out at the store at the time &ndash; but one bullet went through a window. He says witnesses told them a truck drove up to their gated property and just started shooting.</p>
<p>Willie says he&rsquo;s pretty sure whoever it was, they knew they were firing upon his place specifically, although he didn&rsquo;t elaborate on why beyond that. He also says his family saw the suspected vehicle drive by at least once before unloading in the middle of the day at 2:33 PM.</p>
<p>The truck in question is described as a white on brown Ford F-250 pickup with large aftermarket tires and rims. The driver was described as a white male in his 20s, and other passengers were said to be inside as well. The truck was reportedly caught on surveillance video. Cops are investigating, and Willie says he&rsquo;s in close contact with investigators.

<h3 id="xxxtentacion-murder-suspect-begs-judge-for-jail-release-due-to-covid-19">XXXTentacion Murder Suspect Begs Judge For Jail Release Due to COVID-19</h3>
<p><img src="https://imagez.tmz.com/image/6f/16by9/2020/04/24/6f66aaed5c17403986c7aee2a9df3fe6_xl.jpg" alt="img">
Exclusive</p>
<p>One of XXXTentacion&rsquo;s murder suspects fears he&rsquo;ll die from coronavirus while he&rsquo;s behind bars &hellip; and now he&rsquo;s begging a judge to let him out on bond.</p>
<p>Dedrick D. Williams &ndash; the first of 4 suspects arrested and indicted for the rapper&rsquo;s murder &ndash; has written a letter to Judge Michael A. Usan claiming he&rsquo;s afraid of contracting COVID-19 because his immune system is very weak.</p>
<p>According to docs, obtained by TMZ, Williams gets right to the point in his letter, writing, “I am sending you this letter to save my life.” He claims a deputy at the Broward County main jail infected an inmate with the deadly virus and says he&rsquo;s afraid because he claims nobody&rsquo;s being tested at the jail.</p>
<p>Williams says he&rsquo;s being held behind bars because he violated probation but swears he&rsquo;s innocent of his involvement in the rapper&rsquo;s murder. He&rsquo;s asking the judge to allow him to bond out at least until the pandemic blows over.</p>
<p>As we first reported &hellip; Derrick &ndash; along with Michael Boatwright, Trayvon Newsome and Robert Allen &ndash; were indicted by a grand jury for first-degree murder. All 4 men were also charged with armed robbery with a firearm.</p>
<p>Williams says he&rsquo;s been behind bars for 21 months now and claims he&rsquo;s stayed out of trouble while in jail. And, get this &hellip; Williams is hoping his history with the judge will sway him to take his side. He writes to the judge, “Since the age of 17 I’ve had you as a judge. I am now 24. Never have I missed court or failed a drug test since being in your courtroom.”</p>
<p>He also tried tugging at the heartstrings &hellip;. telling the judge he doesn&rsquo;t want his children to be without a father. But, don&rsquo;t forget &hellip; Williams has a long rap sheet. As we reported &hellip; he has at least 11 felonies under his belt, according to arrest records.</p>
<p>Williams ended his letter telling the judge, &ldquo;I hope that you and your family are safe as well.&rdquo; The judge has not yet made a ruling.</p>
