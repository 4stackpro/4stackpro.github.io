In the United Kingdom, the government has pledged to cover 80 percent of the wages of workers left unemployed as the result of the coronavirus. Ireland has enacted an emergency nationalization of its hospitals to meet public demand during the crisis. On Sunday night in the United States, in the absence of a functioning social safety net or guaranteed health care, people got the “Living Room Concert for America,” hosted by Elton John and broadcast by iHeart Radio and Fox. The event, meant to take the place of an iHeart Radio awards ceremony postponed due to the coronavirus and serve as a form of counterprogramming to a rising death toll, offered glimpses into celebrities’ homes, effusive praise for first responders, and a parade of mansion-dwellers soliciting donations to the charities Feeding America and the First Responders Children’s Foundation. A little patriotic pomp in the face of an existential crisis and a quintessentially American spectacle.</p>
<p>The hour-long program—which included at-home performances by Mariah Carey, Billie Eilish, Green Day’s Billie Joe Armstrong, and Camila Cabello, among others—tried to modulate between solemnly addressing the public health disaster at hand and serving as an hour of escapism for the homebound, socially distanced American populace, and subsequently achieved neither. Brief phone-camera dispatches from health care workers, police officers, and other frontline personnel were shuffled between musicians’ couchside renditions of Top 40 hits and celebrity speeches on compassion and resilience, making the whole affair yet another inadvertent display of the ludicrous distance between the part of society that will face physical and financial disaster from the pandemic and the part that will probably be fine.</p>
<p>The e-concert opened with all five Backstreet Boys performing their 20-year-old hit “I Want It That Way” in simultaneous isolation from their respective homes. One (Brian) played air guitar in Louis Vuitton pajama bottoms next to a pinball machine; another (AJ) moved from singing in front of a vast sneaker collection to posing before a grand piano under a framed plaque commemorating the group’s 3x platinum record sales. Nick Carter lounged outdoors by his pool. Shortly after that, Russell Wilson and Ciara appeared on screen to issue a motivational communiqué as their small sons tossed a football about. “We’re here making the best times that we can in this tough time that we’re all going through,” Ciara stressed. Elton John, who emceed the whole procession from a perch in front of an ornate glass chandelier, said at one point, “I have to be quarantined in the only house I have ever been in without a piano,” a slightly inopportune reminder that he owns multiple homes. (He eventually did produce a small keyboard, and performed “Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me” to close out the night.)</p>
<p>Other celebrities managed to dial in from more modest settings and issued praise and encouragement for the nation’s first responders, but even these seemed a little light in the face of unprecedented disaster. “I’d like to dedicate this song to all the people out there who are on the front lines,” said Dave Grohl before launching into an unplugged “My Hero.” Actor Ken Jeong appeared briefly in the lineup to announce that Procter and Gamble was donating $500,000 to the two charities of the evening, an amount that Fox then pledged to match. For a company whose revenue exceeded $2.7 billion in the third quarter of 2019, half a million seemed a somewhat small contribution, particularly after weeks of dismissing the entire pandemic as an anti-Trump hoax.

<p><img src="https://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BSB_performance.png" alt="img">
Much of the world is currently at home, self-quarantine in an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19. But while we’re all physically apart, the power of technology is keeping us connected. Late night hosts are producing abridged shows from their homes, while Global Citizen and the World Health Organization have teamed up for Together At Home concert series live streaming on Instagram. At most recently, Fox and iHeartRadio joined together for a fundraiser for Feeding America and First Responders Children’s Foundation. On March 29, Fox aired the star studded iHeartRadio Living Room Concert for America, featuring some of the biggest names in music.</p>
<p>But one performance in particular captivated the hearts of the internet like no other: The Backstreet Boys. While Dave Grohl and Billie Joe Armstrong performed hit songs without their respective bands, the beloved boy band put Zoom to work, harmonizing to one of their biggest hits from afar.</p>
<p>The Backstreet Boys singing “I Want It That Way” from their separate abodes gives me so. much. joy. Also, I might be crying? #iHeartConcertonFOX https://t.co/CfwXu6YQcZ — Ashley Spencer (@AshleyySpencer) March 30, 2020</p>
<p>The quintet performed “I Want It That Way” from their five residences in various cities across the country: Brian Littrell in Atlanta, Nick Carter in Las Vegas, Howie Dorough in Orlando, and AJ McLean and Kevin Richardson in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>And what a show-stopping virtual performance it was, complete with cameos by Kevin’s sons, whose enthusiasm was matched by fans all over the country.</p>
<p>Of course, the Backstreet Boys were just one act in the hour-long concert, which also featured performances by Billie Eilish and Finneas, Sam Smith, Mariah Carey, Demi Lovato, Camila Cabello (and Shawn Mendes on guitar), H.E.R., Alicia Keys, and Elton John—who also hosted the event.</p>
<p>Check out the full line-up below:</p>
<p>While this virtual BSB performance appears to be a one-off, one can only hope the group quits playing games with our hearts and continues to produce virtual performances of their biggest hits.</p>

Backstreet Boys reunite to perform &lsquo;I Want It That Way&rsquo; while in self-isolation - video</p>

<p>The Backstreet Boys had a digital reunion on Sunday to give a performance of their hit song &lsquo;I Want It That Way&rsquo; from their homes.</p>
<p>Bandmates AJ McLean, Kevin Richardson, Howie Dorough, Nick Carter, Kevin Richardson and Brian Littrell all gave separate performances to a camera from their homes during self-isolation, which were then pieced together for the iHeart Living Room Concert For America on Sunday (March 29).</p>

<p>Littrell starts the video from his home in Atlanta, before Carter appears, filming from Las Vegas.</p>
<p>McLean and Richardson perform from their homes in Los Angeles, with Dorough giving his rendition from Orlando. There&rsquo;s even a few special appearances, as Richardson and Carter&rsquo;s children also join in on the fun.</p>
<p>And even though they&rsquo;re all separated at their different homes – they still managed to capture that fun nostalgic feel of their music videos.</p>
<p>Elton John hosted the free benefit concert at the weekend, which saw some of the biggest names in the music industry – including Mariah Carey, Alicia Keys and the ‘Rocketman’ legend himself – perform a free gig from their homes to raise money for the coronavirus relief effort.</p>
<p>The funds raised from the concert are going to charities Feeding America and First Responders Children’s Foundation.
