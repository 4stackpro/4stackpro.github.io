(CNN) When the going gets tough, the tough get going. Or in the case of John Griffin, the tough get walking. There are 30 steps in his three-story house and for a minimum of six-and-a-half hours every day he&rsquo;s been going up and down them.</p>
<p>Four days later after 1,363 trips to the top floor of his house &ndash; 40,846 steps in all &ndash; he&rsquo;d ascended the height of Mount Everest &ndash; approximately 8,850 meters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mental side of seeing the same staircase again, again and again, that really did drain me,&rdquo; the 53-year-old Griffin, who lives in Shoreham-on-Sea in southern England, told CNN Sport.</p>
<p>In the process, he raised money for food bank charity, The Trussell Trust , after witnessing a lack of supplies being donated at his local supermarket.</p>
<p>His indoor adventure was initially inspired by one of his early morning daily tasks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I live in quite a tall Georgian house and I was taking a cup of tea up to my wife and I said by the time this lockdown is over, it will feel like I&rsquo;ve climbed Everest,&rdquo; he told CNN Sport.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was more focused on trying to get some awareness and raise some money rather than how I was going to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Griffin climbed the height of Everest on his stairs.</p>
<p>Roof terrace summit</p>
<p>When Griffin did eventually reach the top floor of his house for the final time he celebrated with his wife and daughter by flying a Union flag from the roof terrace.</p>
<p>He measured his progress by using a special adapted tracker, stopping for a break every time he climbed the height of the UK&rsquo;s tallest building, The Shard (1,016 ft).</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was great, I didn&rsquo;t let myself go out on the roof terrace so I was saving that for something to look forward to. Like in any real challenge, it&rsquo;s about setting little goals,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>With the launch of his new vegan delivery business put on hold because of the pandemic, Griffin is now spending the majority of isolation homeschooling his daughter and doing all he can to support his wife &ndash; an NHS GP working on the coronavirus crisis&rsquo; frontline.</p>
<p>He hopes his novel initiative provided other people with a bit of respite from the current situation but admits he was surprised by the international interest in his feat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sign of the times that people are looking for things to distract themselves with. Not following the news constantly can be an important part of mental well-being,&rdquo; added Griffin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hopefully it was an amusing distraction for people if nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rory Southworth is planning more indoor challenges over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Keeping positive</p>
<p>Griffin is not the only Briton taking quarantine one step at a time.</p>
<p>A keen endurance runner, Rory Southworth also found himself looking for creative cardio alternatives during lockdown.</p>
<p>So he climbed the height of Ben Nevis, the tallest peak in the UK, on the backsteps of his garden before turning his attention to scaling the the height of Snowdon, the tallest mountain in Wales, by using just the first step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People started being quite interested in this stuff that they could do and it was stuff that they wanted to get involved in,&rdquo; Southworth told CNN Sport from his home near the Lake District, UK.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I thought I&rsquo;d set up a group that would, over five days, do the Everest base camp trek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a trek that a lot of people know, the elevation on it is fairly accessible and you can do the height that you&rsquo;d have to do each day before breakfast, if you wake up early enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Emotional moments</p>
<p>Using Instagram , the 27-year-old brought together a group of 30 people to take on the challenge of climbing the 5,364 meters.</p>
<p>By keeping track of their progress online, Southworth was able to encourage his new-found friends to meet their daily requirement of steps &ndash; whether they were climbing a staircase, garden steps or simply a ladder.</p>
<p>As well as keeping physically active during the quarantine period, the virtual trek also helped those taking part psychologically.</p>
<p>Some of the climbers had recently lost their jobs, were key workers in stressful roles or were struggling to adapt to life in isolation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a lot of us in the outdoor community and who do a lot of outdoor sports, our mental health is intrinsically linked to our sport,&rdquo; said Southworth, admitting the trek was an intense emotional experience for some.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not really used to dealing with stresses without having that ability to expel it through physical activity in nature and wild places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So having something where we have a focus, giving ourselves some purpose, and having a team support us through this was very important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Southworth is keen to continue helping people stay active during the lockdown and is already organizing another challenge where teams race up a different virtual mountain every morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My plan is to keep bettering these challenges, keep improving the concepts and keep involving the teamwork aspect to really try and push positivity into the outdoor community,&rdquo; he added.

<p>A 12-year-old boy claims to have scaled the equivalent of Mount Everest without leaving his house by going up and down stairs 2,507 times in under 24 hours.</p>
<p>Seth Charles, from Sheffield, set himself the challenge after the virus outbreak meant he had to rethink a planned climb of Scafell Pike.</p>
<p>He was hoping to fundraise outdoors for a boxing training trip in the US.</p>
<p>Seth&rsquo;s mum Rachael said he started the stair climb at 05:30 BST on Tuesday and finished at 04:45 the next day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so relieved it was over. I was so tired I just wanted to go to bed,&rdquo; said Seth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My legs are pretty sore but I&rsquo;m ok.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Charles, 45, said: &ldquo;I just couldn&rsquo;t believe that he carried on going, I was just dead on my feet just being there and helping him count. But he did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Image copyright Rachael Charles Image caption Seth Charles is raising money to fund a boxing training trip in San Francisco</p>
<p>She said the keen boxer only stopped for food and was supported by his younger sister, who kept a tally for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We originally thought it would take him 10 hours, but realised we had got our maths wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve trained him quite well at this boxing centre. They do stairs there, but they&rsquo;ve never done that amount before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Charles said he climbed up and down the 3.53m tall staircase in his house and by the end of the challenge, he had completed a total of 85,238 steps.</p>
<p>Mount Everest stands at 8,848m above sea level.</p>
<p>Seth, who trains at Sheffield Boxing Centre, reached the finals of the national championships last year.</p>
<p>He is part of a group of amateur boxers at the club who are raising money to go to San Francisco on a training camp later this year.</p>
<p>But it is not yet known if the trip will be rescheduled due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
