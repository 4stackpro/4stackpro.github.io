Tom Cruise can do almost anything — fly a P-51 Mustang, fly a helicopter, even cling to the side of an Airbus 400.</p>
<p>But the US Navy said he absolutely could not fly a US$70 million dollar Navy fighter jet, not a chance, no way, according to a report by Jared Keller in Task &amp; Purpose.</p>
<p>In a new interview with Empire magazine ahead of the release of Top Gun: Maverick this summer, film producer Jerry Bruckheimer revealed that despite Cruise’s piloting prowess, the Navy wasn’t keen on actually putting the superstar actor in the cockpit of the F/A-18 Super Hornet, the report said.</p>
<p>“The Navy wouldn’t let [Tom] fly an F-18, but he flies a P-51 in the movie, and he flies helicopters,” Bruckheimer told Empire, per Military.com. “He can do just about anything in an airplane.”</p>
<p>According to Empire, both Cruise and Bruckheimer put a premium on authenticity when it came to the return of Pete “Maverick” Mitchell for the highly-anticipated sequel.</p>
<p>“We just started talking,” Cruise told the magazine. “And I realized that there were things that we could accomplish cinematically. And I started getting excited about this big challenge of, ‘How do we do it?’ So I said to Jerry, ‘I’ll do it if …’ meaning, I’m not going to do the CGI stuff.”</p>
<p>For a guy who once clung to the side of an Airbus 400 to execute a mind-numbing opening stunt for Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, Cruise’s devotion to total realism isn’t unsurprising, the report said.</p>
<p>But while that didn’t translate to letting Cruise putter around in a Super Hornet, it did yield some g-force-heavy sequences of Cruise and his co-stars getting rocked around by naval aviators, the report said.</p>
<p>What’s different about this movie is that [in Top Gun] we put the actors in the F-14s and we couldn’t use one frame of it, except some stuff on Tom, because they all threw up,” Bruckheimer told Empire.</p>
<p>“It’s hysterical to see their eyes roll back in their heads. So everything was done on a gimbal. But in this movie, Tom wanted to make sure the actors could actually be in the F-18s.”</p>
<p>Directed by Joseph Kosinksi and staring Cruise, Miles Teller, Jennifer Connelly, Jon Hamm, Ed Harris, and Val Kilmer, Top Gun: Maverick finally hits theaters on June 24, 2020.

<h3 id="panic-over-suri-cruise-running-away">Panic over Suri Cruise &lsquo;running away&rsquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.newidea.com.au/media/85443/suri3.jpg" alt="img">
WATCH: Katie Holmes jokes around with her stylists ahead of photoshoot</p>
<p>Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes ’ daughter Suri is fast growing up – and it appears the 13-year-old is ready to start making some big decisions.</p>
<p>For the past few years, Suri has been all but estranged from her actor father. Sources say, however, she is now looking to run off to be with Tom.</p>
<p>According to a source, Tom reached out to Suri in late 2019 after seeing a photo of her looking older, sparking a new eagerness to be in his teen daughter’s life.</p>
<p>“He saw a photo of Suri looking all grown up, and it changed everything,” the insider told In Touch.</p>
<p>The source added: “With Katie single again, and Suri not having a father figure in her life, it’s the perfect opportunity to reach out.”</p>
<p>It is unknown how Katie feels about her estranged ex and beloved daughter reuniting after eight years.</p>
<p>Katie filed for divorce from Tom in 2012 and the Dawson’s Creek actress had been quietly dating actor Jamie Foxx, before they split late last year.</p>
<p>Speaking to InStyle, the 41-year-old actress confessed that parenting her daughter immediately after her 2012 split with Tom was an emotional rollercoaster.

<h3 id="mission-impossible-director-brian-de-palma-rejected-making-sequels-one-of-these-is-enough">‘Mission: Impossible’ Director Brian De Palma Rejected Making Sequels: ‘One of These Is Enough’</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-20-at-12.19.59-PM.png" alt="img">
De Palma adds that &ldquo;visual storytelling has gone out the window&rdquo; in today&rsquo;s blockbusters and studio tentpoles.</p>
<p>Tom Cruise’s “Mission: Impossible” franchise got its start in 1996 with “Carrie” and “Scarface” auteur Brian De Palma in the director’s chair. The spy thriller was made for $80 million and became a worldwide hit with $457 million at the global box office. The film’s success made a “Mission: Impossible” sequel a priority for Tom Cruise, but De Palma rejected his star’s plea for a follow-up movie. In a new interview with the Associated Press to promote his novel “Are Snakes Necessary?,” De Palma said he turned down Cruise by telling the actor that one “Mission: Impossible” movie was enough.</p>
<p>“Stories, they keep making them longer and longer only for economic reasons,” De Palma said. “After I made ‘Mission: Impossible,’ Tom asked me to start working on the next one. I said, ‘Are you kidding? One of these is enough. Why would anybody want to make another one?’ Of course, the reason they make another one is to make money. I was never a movie director to make money, which is the big problem of Hollywood. That’s the corruption of Hollywood.”</p>
<p>De Palma does not get the appeal of “Mission: Impossible” sequels, but they’ve proven to be hugely lucrative for Tom Cruise and Paramount Pictures. De Palma’s original spawned six sequels, with two additional “Mission: Impossible” films now in development that will bring the franchise to an eight-film total. The most recent entries, Christopher McQuarrie’s 2018 actioner “Mission: Impossible — Fallout,” received universal acclaim and made $791 million worldwide, the highest grossing “Mission: Impossible” movie yet. De Palma might be against “Mission: Impossible” sequels, but he looks back fondly on his first and only entry.</p>

<p>“In my mid-50s doing ‘Carlito’s Way’ and then ‘Mission: Impossible,’ it doesn’t get much better than that,” De Palma said. “You have all the power and tools at your disposal. When you have the Hollywood system working for you, you can do some remarkable things. But as your movies become less successful, it gets harder to hold on to the power and you have to start making compromises. I don’t know if you even realize you’re making them. I tend to be very hard-nosed about this. If you have a couple of good decades, that’s good, that’s great.”</p>
<p>De Palma added he’s not impressed by Hollywood movies these days. “The thing that drives me crazy is the way they look,” he said. “Because they’re shooting digitally they’re just lit terribly. I can’t stand the darkness, the bounced light. They all look the same. I believe in beauty in cinema. Susan and I were looking at ‘Gone With the Wind’ the other day and you’re just struck at how beautiful the whole movie is. The sets, how Vivien Leigh is lit, it’s just extraordinary. If you look at the stuff that’s streaming all the time, it’s all muck. Visual storytelling has gone out the window.”</p>
<p>De Palma’s “Are Snakes Necessary?” was released March 17 and is now available to purchase. Head over to the AP’s website to read the director’s latest interview in its entirety.</p>
