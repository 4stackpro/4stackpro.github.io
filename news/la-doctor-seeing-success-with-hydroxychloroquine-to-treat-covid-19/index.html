EMBED &gt;More News Videos Dr. Anthony Cardillo, CEO of Mend Urgent Care, has seen promising results prescribing hydroxychloroquine with zinc for the most severely-ill COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>EMBED &gt;More News Videos A malaria drug called chloroquine is garnering attention after President Donald Trump mentioned it as a promising treatment against COVID-19.</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES &ndash; A Los Angeles doctor said he is seeing significant success in prescribing the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in combination with zinc to treat patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19.Hydroxychloroquine has been touted as a possible treatment for COVID-19 by President Trump among others, but it remains controversial as some experts believe it is unproven and may not be effective.The drug has long been used for treatment of malaria and conditions such as lupus and arthritis but is not technically approved by the FDA for COVID-19. The agency, however, is encouraging trials and has provided limited emergency authorization for its use to treat COVID-19 patients.Dr. Anthony Cardillo said he has seen very promising results when prescribing hydroxychloroquine in combination with zinc for the most severely-ill COVID-19 patients.&ldquo;Every patient I&rsquo;ve prescribed it to has been very, very ill and within 8 to 12 hours, they were basically symptom-free,&rdquo; Cardillo told Eyewitness News. &ldquo;So clinically I am seeing a resolution.&ldquo;Cardillo is the CEO of Mend Urgent Care , which has locations in Sherman Oaks, Van Nuys and Burbank.He said he has found it only works if combined with zinc. The drug, he said, opens a channel for the zinc to enter the cell and block virus replication.He added that the drug should not be prescribed for those who are presenting only mild symptoms, as there are concerns about shortages for patients with other conditions who need to take the drug on a regular basis.&ldquo;We have to be cautious and mindful that we don&rsquo;t prescribe it for patients who have COVID who are well,&rdquo; Cardillo said. &ldquo;It should be reserved for people who are really sick, in the hospital or at home very sick, who need that medication. Otherwise we&rsquo;re going to blow through our supply for patients that take it regularly for other disease processes.&ldquo;Chloroquine, or hydroxychloroquine, has been approved to treat and prevent malaria since 1944. Because the drug is on the market, doctors can use it for off-label purposes. President Trump has touted it as a possible cure, but the government&rsquo;s top coronavirus expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, has been much more cautious, saying there is only &ldquo;anecdotal evidence&rdquo; demonstrating its effectiveness.Experts are also concerned about potential misuse. A man in Arizona died after taking a similar drug, chloroquine phosphate, in an apparent attempt to self-medicate. The man did not take the pharmaceutical version of the drug, but a version used at aquariums to clean fish tanks.The FDA advises against taking any form of chloroquine unless prescribed by a doctor and obtained from a legitimate source.Another drug that has shown some potential for treating COVID-19 is remdesivir, a drug that was initially developed as a potential treatment for Ebola. A Palo Alto woman was accepted into a clinical trial for remdesivir and said it was effective in improving her condition.

<h3 id="ignoring-expert-opinion-trump-again-promotes-use-of-hydroxychloroquine">Ignoring Expert Opinion, Trump Again Promotes Use of Hydroxychloroquine</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/05/us/politics/05dc-virus-trump3/merlin_171312447_1e7b8fae-eac8-4893-8fae-11606cc1770d-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
Even as Mr. Trump has promoted the drug, which is also often prescribed for patients with lupus, it has created rifts within his own coronavirus task force. And while many hospitals have chosen to use hydroxychloroquine in a desperate attempt to treat dying patients who have few other options, others have noted that it carries serious risks. In particular, the drug can cause a heart arrhythmia that can lead to cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>Dr. Megan L. Ranney, an emergency physician at Brown University in Rhode Island, said in an interview on Sunday night that she had never seen an elected official advertise a miracle cure the way Mr. Trump has.</p>
<p>“There are side effects to hydroxychloroquine,” Dr. Ranney said. “It causes psychiatric symptoms, cardiac problems and a host of other bad side effects.”</p>
<p>Dr. Ranney said that the drug could be effective for some patients, but that there was not nearly enough scientific evidence to support Mr. Trump’s claims.</p>
<p>“There may be a role for it for some people,” she said, “but to tell Americans ‘you don’t have anything to lose,’ that’s not true. People certainly have something to lose by taking it indiscriminately.”</p>
<p>Hydroxychloroquine has not been proved to work against Covid-19 in any significant clinical trials. A small trial by Chinese researchers made public last week found that it helped speed the recovery in moderately ill patients, but the study was not peer-reviewed and had significant limitations. Earlier reports from France and China have drawn criticism because they did not include control groups to compare treated patients with untreated ones, and researchers have called the reports anecdotal. Without controls, they said, it is impossible to determine whether the drugs worked.</p>
<p>But Mr. Trump on Sunday dismissed the notion that doctors should wait for further study.</p>
<p>“We don’t have time to go and say, ‘Gee, let’s take a couple of years and test it out,’ and let’s go out and test with the test tubes and the laboratories,” Mr. Trump said. “I’d love to do that, but we have people dying today.”

<p>Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Sunday that doctors, not lawmakers, should decide whether the immunosuppressive drug hydroxychloroquine is worth using as a possible treatment for the coronavirus.</p>
<p>President Trump and some other politicians have touted hydroxychloroquine – a drug used to treat and prevent malaria – as a possible remedy against the coronavirus following a number of small, early tests that some researchers said were encouraging.</p>
<p>“I think we should let doctors decide whether we should use hydroxychloroquine, not the national bureaucracy,” Giuliani said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.”</p>
<p>But many governors, public-health officials and others have warned that the drug has shown major side effects and its efficacy still remained unproven as a treatment for COVID-19. Some experts have expressed concern that widespread use of the drug could lead to complicating access for people who need them for rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.</p>
<p>CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN</p>
<p>Chloroquine has been used to treat malaria since the 1930s. Hydroxychloroquine came along a decade later and has shown fewer side effects overall, the experts said. The latter has been sold in generic form and under the brand name Plaquenil for use against several diseases.</p>
<p>The drugs could cause heart rhythm problems, severely low blood pressure and muscle or nerve damage, doctors have said. Plaquenil’s label has warned of possible damage to the retina, especially when used at higher doses, for longer times and with certain other medicines such as the breast-cancer drug tamoxifen.</p>
<p>Giuliani, however, argued that the drug would be used only for short periods of time and that the side effects of the drug may be worth it in some cases if the medication actually worked on coronavirus.</p>
<p>“If hydroxychloroquine has side effects, none of which are deaths, by the way, then those side effects you may want to endure because of the risk of death,” he said. “Those choices should be given to doctors, not to the bureaucrats in Washington who want to go through three blind tests. When we finished the three blind tests, you know, most of America could be gone.”</p>
<p>In a recent French study that supporters of hydroxychloroquine have cited, doctors gave the drug to 26 people with confirmed coronavirus infections, including some with no symptoms. Six also received the antibiotic azithromycin.</p>
<p>Some of the 26 were not counted in the final results because they didn’t complete the study — what’s known as “lost to followup” — but they included three who worsened and were sent to intensive care, one who died a day after later testing negative for the virus and one who stopped treatment because of nausea, the researchers said.</p>
<p>After six days, no patients given hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin had the virus detected in swabs from the back of the nose, versus 57 percent of those given the malaria drug alone and 12.5 percent of some other patients who received neither drug, according to the study.</p>
<p>Still, experts have noted many things could have affected the outcome, such as how sick people were, when they were treated and what other treatments they received, as well as their age, genders and underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>“It is a very weak study &hellip; leaving us in suspension of whether the combination strategy has any merit,” Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist, said.</p>
<p>CLICK FOR COMPLETE COVERAGE OF THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK</p>
<p>Governors from New York to Nevada have clamped down on who could obtain these drugs and where doctors could administer them. Some states have made efforts to prevent people from stockpiling them and also obtain thousands of doses to conduct their own tests. Doctors in New York could prescribe chloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients in hospitals and emergency rooms, but not in outpatient settings.</p>
<p>Giuliani said he thought New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo needed to make the drug easier to access.</p>
<p>“I think this situation on hydroxychloroquine alone is a terrible, terrible mistake,” Giuliani said. “If it deprives one person of the medicine and that person dies, it’s a terrible mistake.”</p>
<p>Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
