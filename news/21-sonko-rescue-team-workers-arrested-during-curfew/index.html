Twenty-one workers under the Sonko Rescue Team were arrested on Monday night by police officers in Nairobi who were on patrol during the 7pm-5am curfew.</p>
<p>The team‚Äôs head of operations Francis Mwangi said the workers were heading home after a fumigation exercise in several estates in Nairobi.</p>
<p>They were then locked up at Muthaiga Police Station.</p>
<p>Why arrest the people whose intentions were good</p>
<p>The fumigation excercise were meant to reduce the spreed of corona virus #FreeSonkoRescueTeam pic.twitter.com/Km1wixtkI4 ‚Äî Nick üá∞üá™ (@Nick254_) April 7, 2020</p>
<p>Citizen Digital understands that police have since suspended the team‚Äôs food distribution program to the citing fear of public gathering which has so far been banned by the government to prevent spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Governor Mike Sonko continued donating sanitizers and masks to security guards even after his fumigation team was arrested on Monday night.</p>
<p>Fumigation of public areas by the County Government began last month in the CBD with Starehe Sub-county Health Officer Charles Kibue stating that the workers had been provided with chlorine for fumigation.</p>
<p>In addition to the Sonko Rescue Team, the county brought in over 200 health officers to assist in fumigating the city and its environs.</p>

<h3 id="kenya-records-14-new-coronavirus-cases-total-number-rises-to-172">Kenya records 14 new coronavirus cases, total number rises to 172</h3>
<p><img src="https://3dwnh01icn0h133s00sokwo1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mutahi-kagwe1.png" alt="img">
Fourteen more patients have tested positive for the coronavirus in Kenya, raising the total number of COVID-19 cases in the country to 172.</p>
<p>Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe, in a press briefing on Tuesday, said the new cases include 14 Kenyans and two foreign nationals.</p>
<p>He noted that four of the 14 cases have a recent history of travel from Tanzania, South Africa, UAE and the United States while 10 were picked by surveillance teams in the country.</p>
<p>The CS noted that out of the 14 new patients, seven are from Nairobi, two from Mombasa, two from Mandera while Machakos, Kisii and Kiambu Counties have one new victim each.</p>
<p>The two reported cases from Mandera are said to have recently traveled to Mombasa.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat explains why the decision by the President was taken to close some of the areas where we feel movement is causing spread of the virus,‚Äù said the CS.</p>
<p>Kagwe urged Kenyans to brace themselves for ‚Äúbad news‚Äù noting that all measures the government has taken and intends to take will not stop the spread of the disease abruptly.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe mortality rate for us has been quite low but this is no reason for us to be relaxed at all. We are praying and hoping for the best but clearly we must also prepare for the worst and mentally we must prepare ourselves to face an insurmountable situation,‚Äù said the CS.</p>
<p>The CS reiterated that the country is facing a situation a kin to a boat sailing towards a massive storm, urging Kenyans to be more vigilant and strictly follow the precautionary measures set by the government.</p>

<h3 id="a-tiger-in-new-york-tests-positive-for-coronavirus">A tiger in New York tests positive for coronavirus</h3>
<p><img src="https://3dwnh01icn0h133s00sokwo1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/images-7.jpeg" alt="img">
Nadia, a tiger at the Bronx Zoo in New York, has become the first of her kind to test positive for the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The 4-year-old female Malayan tiger tested positive after developing a dry cough and is expected to recover, the Wildlife Conservation Society‚Äôs Bronx Zoo said in a news release.</p>
<p>Samples from Nadia were taken and tested after the tiger ‚Äî and five other tigers and lions at the zoo ‚Äî began showing symptoms of respiratory illness, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). No other animals at the zoo are showing symptoms.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThough they have experienced some decrease in appetite, the cats at the Bronx Zoo are otherwise doing well under veterinary care and are bright, alert, and interactive with their keepers,‚Äù the zoo said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is not known how this disease will develop in big cats since different species can react differently to novel infections, but we will continue to monitor them closely and anticipate full recoveries.‚Äù</p>
<p>The animals were infected by a zoo employee who was ‚Äúasymptomatically infected with the virus‚Äù while caring for them, according to the zoo. The Bronx Zoo has been closed to the public since March 16.</p>
<p>Anyone sick with the coronavirus is being advised to minimize contact with animals, including pets, until more information is known about the virus, the USDA said.</p>
