Mr Tang Wei Xiong, 37, a full-time Gojek driver, used to take home about $3,000 to $4,000 a month.</p>
<p>But with fewer people here venturing out and taking rides in the light of the coronavirus outbreak, his earnings have taken a hit, dropping by at least 50 per cent over the past month or so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been very worrying for drivers like me. I have to support my family and we have household expenses like groceries, school fees, to take care of,&rdquo; said the father of two boys, aged three and five. His wife works as a hairdresser.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr Tang joined more than 80 people at Nee Soon East Community Club to apply for aid under the Temporary Relief Fund, which will grant those who have been financially affected by the coronavirus outbreak through losing their jobs or income with a one-time cash assistance of $500.</p>
<p>It was the first day that Singaporeans and permanent residents could apply for the scheme.</p>
<p>There has been strong response to the scheme, unveiled by Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat last week as part of a slate of measures under the $48.4 billion Resilience Budget.</p>
<p>As of 3pm yesterday, about 3,500 applications had been submitted to community centres or clubs (CCs) and social service offices (SSOs) across Singapore.</p>
<p>Queues began to form at some CCs and SSOs in the late afternoon, with staff members coordinating safe distancing and other precautionary measures.</p>
<p>But MPs like Ms Lee Bee Wah from Nee Soon GRC and Education Minister Ong Ye Kung reminded residents on Facebook that there was no need to rush, as applications can be made till the end of this month.</p>
<p>The Temporary Relief Fund is an interim measure that will provide lower-to middle-income Singaporeans and permanent residents who are not on ComCare assistance with immediate financial support to help them with basic living expenses.</p>
<p>From next month, schemes like the Covid-19 Support Grant and the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme will be able to provide longer-term support to those who have lost their jobs due to Covid-19 and those who are self-employed.</p>
<p>Those applying for the Temporary Relief Fund must have had a household income of $10,000 and below, or per capita household income not exceeding $3,100, before their employment or income was affected by the Covid-19 situation, among other criteria.</p>
<p>They will need to produce their identity cards and relevant supporting documents such as income documents or a letter of retrenchment, though they may also self-declare their income if there are valid reasons for them to do so.</p>
<p>WORRYING TIMES It&rsquo;s been very worrying for drivers like me. I have to support my family and we have household expenses like groceries, school fees, to take care of. MR TANG WEI XIONG, a full-time Gojek driver, on how his takings have dropped by at least half amid the Covid-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>The applications will take about one to three days to process, and they will receive the $500 sum via cheque or bank transfer if they are eligible.</p>
<p>Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC MP Saktiandi Supaat said there has been a slight increase in the number of residents who have approached him for help due to job or income loss in recent weeks, including those in the hospitality industry and the self-employed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have set up a dedicated jobs assistance unit at our Meet-the-People sessions to try to help them, including by matching them with employers who need workers.&rdquo;

<h3 id="sporeans-affected-by-covid-19-economic-impact-form-long-queues-to-get-s500-in-financial-aid">S’poreans affected by Covid-19 economic impact form long queues to get S$500 in financial aid</h3>
<p><img src="https://mothership.sg/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/long-queue-temporary-relief-fund.png" alt="img">
Applications for the Temporary Relief Fund just opened on Apr. 1 and long queues have since formed at community centres (CCs) and social service offices (SSOs) around Singapore.</p>
<p>These Singaporeans, should they fit the necessary criteria, will receive some financial aid which will hopefully help to tide them through this pandemic.</p>
<p>What is the Temporary Relief Fund?</p>
<p>The aid is part of the Temporary Relief Fund, which was first announced among a slew of financial assistance measures by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat during the Resilience Budget.</p>
<p>A total of S$145 million will be set aside for unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>This money will be channeled to low and middle-income Singaporeans whose livelihoods have been affected by Covid-19.</p>
<p>According to press release by the Ministry of Social and Family Development, the fund specifically targets those who have lost their jobs or faced a 30 per cent loss of income due to Covid-19, and require urgent help with basic living expenses.</p>
<p>Eligible applicants will receive a one-off S$500 cash payout.</p>
<p>Long queues and safe distancing</p>
<p>Numerous Singaporeans have turned up to apply for assistance at various CCs, as photos on Facebook show.</p>
<p>Today reported that “thousands” apparently showed up at the various application points.</p>
<p>Long queues can be seen extending all the way across the empty space at Nee Soon East Community Club.</p>
<p>Safe distancing measures were implemented as well, with tape marking out queueing positions on the floor and chairs for waiting applicants spaced apart.</p>
<p>Some things to note</p>
<p>Several MPs have also been walking the ground to check on the situation since applications started.</p>
<p>Minister for Social and Family Development Desmond Lee and Speaker for Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin both thanked the SSO and People’s Association staff and volunteers for their hard work.</p>
<p>The latter said that when he left at 10pm, the staff and volunteers were still busy typing away and keying in details of the cases.</p>
<p>Both revealed that some of the applicants they talked to included taxi and private hire drivers, dance instructors, stewards and stewardesses, and tour guides.</p>
<p>Lee highlighted in another Facebook post a list of things Singaporeans should take note of before applying.</p>
<p>To process the applications quickly, applicants should:</p>
<p>Bring their NRIC.</p>
<p>Provide a letter of retrenchment, or document/letter/email/payslip/appointment book showing loss of income of 30% or more.</p>
<p>For those who have difficulty producing documents such as income slips because of the nature of their work, appointment records, food delivery or private hire app records/screenshots suffice.</p>
<p>Provide a Paynow account so the cash transfers can take place more quickly, instead of by cheque.</p>
<p>Lee also assured Singaporeans that there was no rush as applications would be open for the whole month of April.</p>
<p>Covid-19 Support Grant</p>
<p>Another scheme, the Covid-19 Support Grant, will also help Singaporeans who have lost their job to the impact of Covid-19.</p>
<p>From May 1, 2020, lower to middle-income Singaporean Citizens and PRs who have lost their jobs due to Covid-19 can receive help from Covid-19 Support Grant.</p>
<p>They can receive S$800 a month for three months, if they agree to receive employment and training support from Workforce Singapore and the Employment and Employability Institute.</p>
