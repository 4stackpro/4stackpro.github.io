There are no poppy collections outside your local supermarket, no in-classroom discussions, no pre-dawn marches, and no gatherings this year. But as a country we will still remember, and while standing apart - at our letterboxes, on our porches, decks, and driveways, or from the front door - we also stand together, to remember and pay our respects.</p>

<p>Anzac Day will certainly be different this year. We are living in a restricted world, in a country in lockdown. While we cannot meet for a dawn service as we usually would, there are plenty of ways New Zealanders can mark the day from their own homes.</p>
<p>Take inspiration from the list below and get creative with the kids by making poppy art, baking Anzac goodies, or follow the links to learn more about why we remember Anzac Day and the significance of poppies. Find out about competitions, light displays and how to lay a digital poppy for those who served Aotearoa.</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget to join other New Zealanders at 6am tomorrow by standing in your lounge, at your front door, on your driveway, deck, porch or at the letterbox to take a moment to remember. Tune in to RNZ from 5.50am for our &lsquo;virtual&rsquo; dawn service, presented by Shannon Haunui-Thompson, and check our website for developments throughout the day.</p>
<p>Send us a photo of your creations and how you marked Anzac morning to <a href="mailto:webnews@rnz.co.nz">webnews@rnz.co.nz</a> and you might end up on our blog or on our Facebook page.</p>

<p>In your neighbourhood</p>
<p>Teddies have become fixtures in windows across the country since we went into lockdown, and now some of them are featuring poppies. Councils are encouraging people to add poppies to their cuddly toys for children to spot as they walk through their neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>Also look out for decorated letterboxes - and decorate your own to be in to win some prizes. RSA is running a &lsquo;decorate your letterbox&rsquo; competition.

Alexandra-Clyde RSA president Debra Warburton and Gore and districts RSA president Jared Scott lay poppies on graves at the Gore cemetary on Anzac Day.</p>
<p>We said we would remember them, and we did.</p>
<p>As the heavens opened and the rain poured down on Saturday morning in Gore, Alexandra-Clyde RSA president Debra Warburton and Gore and districts RSA president Jarrad Scott placed a poppy at the grave of each of the Gore district&rsquo;s returned servicemen who are buried in the town&rsquo;s cemetery.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a tribute that would have usually be left to family members, but amid the Covid-19 lock down and rules about only essential travel being carried out, Warburton and Scott were determined that the district&rsquo;s fallen were not forgotten.</p>
<p>The rain, and the quiet of lock down, added to the sombre occasion.</p>

</ul>
<p>&ldquo;It was just something we felt that needed to be done,&rdquo; Warburton, who is an active member of the New Zealand Army Reserves, said.</p>
<p>About 500 former service personnel are in the Gore cemetery, and each received an RSA poppy on Anzac Day to mark the sacrifice they had made.</p>
<p>Scott said it was surprising where some of the soldiers had served.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are soldiers here from the Crimean War, which is very unusual, soldiers from the Boar War, World Wars and 1 and 2 and many other conflicts,&rdquo; Scott said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a huge contingent from Otago and Southland,&rdquo; Warburton said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two here from the NZ Camel Corps, which I think is probably pretty unusual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The NZ History website says the Imperial Camel Corps, which included two New Zealand companies, played a vital role in the Sinai and Palestine campaigns during World War 1.</p>
<p>Between 400 and 450 New Zealanders fought in the Camel Corps, and 41 of them died before the two New Zealand companies were disbanded in mid-1918. The soldiers, known as cameliers – rode their camels to get to the scene of battle, but would then dismount to fight on foot.</p>
<p>Scott had been cleaning the soldier&rsquo;s graves at the Gore cemetery, and Warburton at Alexandra, as part of the New Zealand Remembrance Army.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of a stand alone thing, it&rsquo;s not officially an RSA thing but RSA&rsquo;s are on board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scott said while there were about 500 recognised war graves in the cemetery, he had found the graves of other service personnel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite surprising what you find when you wander through. There are people who would have served in the war but are buried in family plots, for example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Usually tributes to the soldiers would be given at the Dawn Service at the town&rsquo;s Cenotaph, which usually drew about 700 to 800 people.</p>
<p>This year Southlanders had shown their respect by standing at their gates and letterboxes at dawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was going to be a crap Anzac Day but it&rsquo;s actually turned out to be really good.</p>
<p>A service had been broadcast around the district on two radio stations, which was really moving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was still really special, and if you drive around you can see all the houses with poppies outside. That&rsquo;s something we wouldn&rsquo;t have seen otherwise and people have had to diversify to show their respects. Everyone has been really positive about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pair placed a wreath at the Cenotaph on behalf of the Returned Services Association and were pleased to see wreaths from other organisations, and bunches of flowers, also there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can do that and stay in your bubble and stay safe then that&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; Scott said.</p>
<p>His three-year term as the RSA president is nearly over.</p>
<p>Two of the three Anzac Days he&rsquo;s officiated over have been anything but normal - last year there were security concerns after the Christchurch terrorist attack and this year, there was no service at all.</p>
<p>But his last job in office is to change that.</p>
<p>While a bigger service will be held in Gore on Armistice Day this year, Scott plans to petition the Government to make the day a public holiday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Wednesday this year, so we can get together and recognise the Anzacs,&rdquo; he said.</p>

Donate to this year&rsquo;s RSA Appeal.</p>
<p>Join us for the virtual Anzac Day Dawn Service from 6am on Saturday at nzherald.co.nz or on Newstalk ZB.</p>
<p>Kiwis might not be able to commemorate Anzac Day the traditional way this year but we&rsquo;re hoping you can help line the streets with poppies by putting our special Anzac poster in your window.</p>
<p>The war against Covid-19 has seen ANZAC Day services around the country cancelled for the first time in NZ history, but that won’t stop New Zealanders showing their respect to those who lost their lives in a very different type of battle. Video / Auckland War Memorial Museum / Dean Purcell / Chris Tarpey / Michael Craig</p>
<p>For the first time in history Anzac Day dawn ceremonies will not be taking place this April 25, due to Covid-19 restrictions.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>As a means to pay respects, Kiwis are being urged to &ldquo;never forget&rdquo; from inside their bubbles by placing images of poppies in their windows, including a special edition poster from the Herald artist and cartoonist Rod Emmerson, published in today&rsquo;s Herald.</p>
<p>New Zealanders are also being asked to unite at 6am on Saturday at their letterboxes, front doors and even their living rooms. Veterans are encouraged to wear their medals on Anzac Day just as they would for official public gatherings on Anzac Day.</p>
<p>Emmerson said the inspiration for his image came from an Anzac Day illustration four years ago, where he depicted a soldier walking into battlefield along with the Māori whakataukī (proverb): &ldquo;Whatungarongaro te tangata toitū te whenua&rdquo;, or &ldquo;The people fade from view but the land remains&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That image has been one of my favourites, so I wanted to use that as a basis and provide depth, do something spiritual and meaningful, rather than just a poppy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emmerson, originally from Australia, said it was an &ldquo;important role&rdquo; to provide illustrations for Anzac Day, which he&rsquo;d been doing for about 30 years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is about conveying the empathy we all have for those who gave their lives so we can sleep at night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On a personal level, it was also recognising the sacrifices of his father, uncles and grandfathers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As each new generation comes they need to be reminded what war really is about, the massive loss of life, and the sacrifices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Returned and Services&rsquo; Association president BJ Clark said the RSA greatly appreciated the support for &ldquo;virtual services&rdquo; this Anzac Day.</p>
<p>The virtual campaign #StandAtDawn encourages households to gather at their door or gate at 6am, and has the slogan: &ldquo;Apart, but together as one&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be disappointing not going to the service, but I am looking forward to walking to my gate on Saturday morning, and seeing people in my neighbourhood out with candles or torches, and poppies on their fences or in their windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The national Poppy Day appeal was postponed this year for the first time since 1992, which Clark said could have &ldquo;huge financial consequences&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The RSA usually collected between $1.5-2 million, but were expecting much less this year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We rely on those funds to support our veterans, young and old, and their families,&rdquo; Clark said.</p>
<p>In light of this shortfall, the country&rsquo;s largest philanthropic entity, Perpetual Guardian, has stepped up and started a Givealittle page, and is contributing $25,000 from its own members and another $1500 from the company itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The work the RSA does is incredibly important, so we are very happy to be involved with this,&rdquo; said Liz Gibbs, head of philanthropy at Perpetual Guardian.
