<p>A nursing assistant looking after coronavirus patients has died.</p>
<p>John Alagos, 24, became ill and died on Friday after working at Watford General Hospital in Hertfordshire.</p>
<p>His mother Gina Gustilo told the BBC the family were waiting to hear whether he had tested positive for Covid-19.</p>
<p>The hospital closed to new patients on Saturday due to problems with its oxygen equipment, but has now reopened. It said it ensured staff had the right level of protection when working.</p>
<p>Tracey Carter, chief nurse at the hospital, said: &ldquo;John was very popular and will be missed greatly by his colleagues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs Gustilo, who is an NHS mental health nurse and lived with her son, said she had shown no symptoms of the virus.</p>
<p>However, she said she had been tested, was waiting for results and was self isolating.</p>
<p>Image copyright South Beds News Agency Image caption Patients had been asked not to attend Watford General Hospital&rsquo;s A&amp;E Unit</p>
<p>In a statement issued after Mr Alagos&rsquo; death, Ms Carter added: &ldquo;Our staff are fully briefed on the symptoms of Covid-19 and we would never expect anyone to remain at work if they were showing these symptoms or indeed were unwell in any way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have always kept our staff updated on the latest PPE guidance to make sure they have the right level of protection for where they are working.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hospital said the decision on Saturday to declare a critical incident was taken as a &ldquo;result of a technical issue with our hospital&rsquo;s oxygen equipment&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Safe oxygen levels&rsquo;</p>
<p>Later that evening the hospital said the problems had been resolved and it lifted the critical incident.</p>
<p>A safe level of oxygen was maintained throughout the duration of the incident, said the West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs the hospital.</p>
<p>As of 17:00 BST on Thursday, 29 people had died at the NHS trust&rsquo;s hospitals after being diagnosed with Covid-19.</p>
<p>The trust is responsible for Watford General as well as Hemel Hempstead and St Albans City hospitals.</p>
<p>Current NHS advice tells people with coronavirus or suspected symptoms to avoid hospitals and other medical settings like pharmacies.</p>

<h3 id="critical-incident-declared-at-watford-hospital">Critical incident declared at Watford Hospital</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.borehamwoodtimes.co.uk/resources/images/11195340/" alt="img">
A critical incident at Watford General Hospital has been stood down after a &ldquo;technical issue with its oxygen equipment&rdquo; was resolved.</p>
<p>It means the hospital is operating as normal again following a near-full closure for much of today.</p>
<p>West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust announced late this morning that its A&amp;E department in Watford was closed to new patients.</p>
<p>Patients and visitors were told to go they would need to find alternative emergency care at another hospital.</p>
<p>The trust tweeted and put on Facebook: &ldquo;Please DO NOT attend Watford General’s emergency department until further notice, even in an emergency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to your next nearest hospital with an emergency department. Anyone with non-urgent issues should seek advice via <a href="https://111.nhs.uk">https://111.nhs.uk</a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Please DO NOT attend Watford General’s emergency department until further notice, even in an emergency. Go to your next nearest hospital with an emergency department. Anyone with non-urgent issues should seek advice via https://t.co/3rSnMp3o5g — West Herts Hospitals (@WestHertsNHS) April 4, 2020</p>
<p>Then, all patients, except for pregnant women, were told to stay away.</p>
<p>Further information on the shutdown and declaration of a critical incident was released by the trust this afternoon.</p>
<p>An official statement, released at 4.40pm, says: “As a result of a technical issue with our individual hospital’s oxygen equipment, which does not pose any risk to our patients, West Herts Hospitals NHS Trust declared a critical incident on Saturday April 4 and has asked that people do not attend Watford General Hospital.</p>
<p>“A small number of patients are being transferred to other hospitals in the area, with each patient being fully assessed in line with existing safety guidelines before they are moved.”</p>
<p>The critical incident remained live until 10.30pm.</p>
<p>In a statement released at 11.15pm on Saturday, the NHS Trust said: &ldquo;West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust stood down its critical incident tonight (Saturday) at 22.30.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This means that patients can attend Watford General as usual and that ambulances can bring patients to Watford General instead of to neighbouring hospitals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The issues experienced today have been resolved and a safe level of oxygen was maintained throughout the duration of the incident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trust is grateful to neighbouring hospitals and to the ambulance service and the police for their support today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deputy chief executive Helen Brown added: “We know that our NHS colleagues and the police are exceptionally busy at the moment, but this didn’t stop them stepping in to help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were quick to respond and together – as one team – we kept our site and our patients safe.”</p>
<p>The trust says it is not expecting to provide any further comment tomorrow and has not revealed any further details about the technical issue.</p>
<p>The trust has made clear however it never ran out of any oxygen at the hospital.</p>
<p>With A&amp;E shut for several hours, patients in West Hertfordshire had to seek alternative emergency care at another hospital.</p>
<p>Watford General Hospital&rsquo;s resources are currently under strain as staff fight the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>As of today, there have been 31 confirmed coronavirus-related deaths at West Herts Hospitals NHS Trust.</p>
<p>There are several wards at Watford General Hospitals dedicated to coronavirus patients.</p>
<p>But in order to keep all patients as safe as possible, extreme measures including banning visitors to the hospital were introduced in late March.</p>
<p>Only parents of paediatric patients or someone giving birth are allowed a visitor, unless it is in exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p>The no visitor rule is also in place at St Albans City and Hemel Hempstead hospitals.</p>
<p>All non-urgent appointments have also been postponed by the West Herts NHS trust too due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the minor injuries unit at St Albans City Hospital, which is also run by West Herts Trust, is temporarily closed.</p>
<p>The Department of Health announced this afternoon (Saturday) that 4,313 hospitals patients in the UK who had tested positive for Covid-19 have died.</p>
<p>This is an increase of 708 from yesterday&rsquo;s announcement.

<p><img src="https://news.images.itv.com/image/file/2175237/img.jpg" alt="img">
Video report by ITV News Correspondent Sejal Karia</p>
<p>A hospital declared a critical incident and told people not to attend after a technical issue with oxygen equipment. Watford General hospital asked people to stay away following the issue which they said did not pose any risk to patients. A doctor at the hospital told ITV News they were &ldquo;concerned&rdquo; about the situation and that a &ldquo;large number of staff are sick&rdquo; after &ldquo;being exposed to Covid-19 patients without adequate personal protection equipment (PPE)&quot;. Teams were overworked and morale low, the doctor alleged, who said nurses had taken to hiding PPE and only allowing it to be used when dealing with confirmed cases. In response, West Herts Hospitals NHS Trust told ITV News: &ldquo;Like many of hospitals, many of our doctors and nurses are absent and this adds pressure. These are testing times and it is expected that morale may suffer.&rdquo; The trust is responsible for Watford General as well as Hemel Hampstead and St Albans City hospitals.</p>
<p>ITV News Correspondent Sejal Karia on the situation at Watford General where one doctor said &ldquo;morale was low&rdquo;</p>
<p>Earlier on Saturday the hospital tweeted telling people not to come to A&amp;E until further notice even in an emergency and advised people instead to visit other nearby hospitals or seek advice through the 111 helpline. West Herts Hospitals NHS Trust said in a statement on Saturday: &ldquo;A small number of patients are being transferred to other hospitals in the area, with each patient being fully assessed in line with existing safety guidelines before they are moved.&rdquo; As of 5pm Thursday, 29 people had died at West Hertfordshire NHS Trust hospitals after being diagnosed with Covid-19. Saturday saw the UK&rsquo;s darkest day since the coronavirus outbreak began. Among the record 708 victims to have died after testing positive for coronavirus was a five-year-old child. The child, who had underlying health issues, is the youngest victim of coronavirus, NHS England said. The UK death toll now stands at 4,313.</p>

<p>The Department of Health said a total of 183,190 people had been tested as of 9am on Saturday, of which 41,903 tested positive. Among those who had died after suffering from Covid-19 symptoms were five bus drivers and two staff members from Pentonville Prison. During the Government&rsquo;s daily coronavirus briefing on Saturday, Michael Gove paid tribute to the five-year-old victim and also confirmed seven medical professionals had died after testing positive for coronavirus. Mr Gove said: “Our thoughts today are also with the family of the five-year-old child with underlying health conditions who’s tragically died.” Both Mr Gove and chief medical Professor Steve Powis reiterated the Government&rsquo;s instructions ordering people to stay at home to stop the spread of coronavirus.</p>
