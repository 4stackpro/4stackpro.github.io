<p>LIKE it or not there is certainly a stereotype that comes with being a Playboy bunny - and it usually has nothing to do with your brains.</p>
<p>But one Playmate determined to smash the ‘bimbo’ association is Danielle Lupo, 24, who has just graduated from pre-medical school and is now looking to progress to a doctor.</p>

<p>8 Dani has been in healthcare field for ten years Credit: Danielle Lupo</p>
<p>Dani, who lives in New Jersey, began life as a dental assistant and has been in the healthcare field for 10 years after a bad accident exposed her to the industry.</p>
<p>Speaking to Fabulous Digital she said: “I got in a bad accident and I had to go to the hospital and that’s when I got exposed to all the kinds of things you can do in medical.</p>
<p>“After just graduating last year I’m looking at medical schools and doctoral programmes all while working as a cardiographic technician.”</p>
<p>But while Dani is hard at work studying during the day, at night she strips off her stethoscope and dons her bunny tail to work at New York’s Playboy club, which is currently closed due to lockdown.</p>

<p>8 She has previously changed her name on naked shoots so that her patients won&rsquo;t be able to Google her naked Credit: Danielle Lupo</p>
<p>She explained: “It’s great money on the side and I had a lot of fun doing a bunch of different shoots and I got into multiple international Playboy issues.</p>
<p>“I had the best time and it was just an honour to be published and then the Playboy club New York just opened and I tried out and got the position as a Playboy bunny.</p>
<p>8 Danielle describes herself as a &lsquo;feminist&rsquo; and says Playboy &lsquo;celebrates women&rsquo; Credit: Danielle Lupo</p>
<p>“That was really cool, I was dressing up at night and going to school and working at the hospital (during the day).</p>
<p>“I looked at it as two part time jobs that would fill my schedule, I guess you could say they contradicted each other.</p>
<p>“The medical field is super conservative and Playboy is obviously free and liberating.”</p>
<p>I used a different name, because I’m going to be a doctor one day and I don’t want people Googling me Danielle Lupo</p>
<p>And rather than hindering her medical studies, Dani insists that doing both has given her “the best of both worlds.”</p>
<p>“While the club was open, it would consist of me making sure I had my homework in on time, before commuting an hour from Jersey to New York.</p>
<p>“It was an experience I wouldn’t trade for anything, I’m glad that I could find balance in both aspects of my life because I wouldn’t want to give up either one honestly.”</p>

<p>Dani is helping out with the current Covid-19 battle where she can but not everyone is a big fan of her side-line of work as she admits that family and friends had their concerns when it came to her after-hours work.</p>
<p>Dani said: “My mom was not a big fan, interestingly enough my dad was super supportive, he went to college and he understands that aspect.</p>
<p>“My mom is focused on telling people her daughter works at the hospital and leaving out the modelling part and some conservative friends have their concerns about Playboy.”</p>
<p>However, Dani is mindful of the fact that her previous career choices may impact her future as a doctor and has taken precautions.</p>

<p>8 The model regrets nothing about her double life Credit: Danielle Lupo</p>
<p>Being drop -dead gorgeous you won’t be surprised to hear that Danielle is not single, currently dating tattoo artist Jon Boy.</p>
<p>Despite having met her boyfriend at the Playboy club, it seems that he too sometimes struggles with her line of work.</p>
<p>“Couples have their moments and their disagreements but he supports me” she explains.</p>
<p>“He has to understand that there’s going to be certain attention on me and not to get jealous or feel insecure - but it’s human.”</p>
<p>Dani, who is a self-confessed feminist, is keen for her fellow activists to realise that Playboy is celebrating women rather than degrading them.</p>
<p>She adds: “I don’t feel that Playboy is sexist at all, Playboy celebrates women and I love that.</p>
<p>“We should be highlighting the fact that I’m a model and I’m smart.</p>
<p>“Even though I’m going to be a doctor one day I can still show my body and feel comfortable in my own skin.”</p>
<p>Dani, who has been been helping out at the hospital during coronavirus, remains adamant that while she may have sacrificed the odd night out and girls&rsquo; trip away she regrets nothing about her double life.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t have survived mentally if I didn’t have either or”, she says, “ It was the best of both worlds.”</p>

<p>2019 is drawing to a close so it&rsquo;s time to look back over the year at Truro Crown Court and bring you the comprehensive list of all the criminals sent down at the court this year.</p>
<p>Resident judges Robert Linford and Simon Carr and other guest judges and recorders have dealt with crimes spanning the criminals spectrum, from a baby murder trial that was followed all around the country to the all-too-common tales of sickening sex monsters who have ruined lives for their own gratification, as well as everything else in between.</p>
<p>So here it is, it&rsquo;s taken a long time to put together but here is the list of all the criminals Cornwall Live has reported on who were jailed at Truro Crown Court this year.</p>
<p>Please note that Cornwall Live strives to cover every criminal sentencing at Truro Crown Court but it isn&rsquo;t always possible due to staffing issues and unexpected listings.</p>
<p>January</p>
<p>Mark Wyatt</p>
<p>A sex offender who was spared jail for grooming a schoolgirl online breached the terms of his sentence by fleeing to The Philippines to meet a woman he met on the internet.</p>
<p>In March 2015 Mark Wyatt, 42, was given a 15-month prison sentence, suspended for 24 months, after he was caught in a sting operation while attempting to meet a 15-year-old girl he had groomed over the internet. Wyatt, then of Higher Tower Road, Newquay, had believed he was meeting teenager &ldquo;Holly Stephens&rdquo; at a hotel on January 19, 2015, but was instead confronted by an undercover police officer.</p>
<p>Wyatt had contacted a fake profile set up by the police and arranged to meet a girl he knew was under age, but on his way to meet her at a Premier Inn hotel miles away from his home, he was arrested by officers.</p>
<p>Wyatt returned to Truro Crown Court on January 4 to be sentenced for failing to comply with a sex offender programme and failing to attend appointments with the Probation Service.</p>
<p>Prosecuting, Ramsay Quaife said that until November 2016 the order had been going well until Wyatt disappeared causing police to issue and execute a warrant.</p>
<p>Defending Wyatt, Jason Beal said: “He started very well in response to the order and was attending the Thames Valley Sex Offenders’ Programme but then met an adult female on the internet and visited The Philippines.</p>
<p>“As a result of a falling out with her his return airline ticket was destroyed. He was detained in December 2017 and spent a year in a detention facility in Manila before he was eventually returned to this country and retained at the airport.</p>
<p>“The conditions were less hospitable in Manila and exacerbated his double hernia and back pain.”</p>
<p>Sentencing Wyatt for the breach, Judge Simon Carr noted that he had spent a year in detention in the south east Asian country and some time in prison in the UK since his return.</p>
<p>Judge Carr said: “In 2015 you were convicted of a serious offence involving grooming. The court gave you the opportunity of a suspended sentence and appropriate treatment but you made the decision to go to The Philippines, one that cannot be justified.</p>
<p>“You failed to keep in touch with the Probation Service but paid a heavy price with your detention in The Philippines. It would be wrong not to acknowledge that you have now served much of this sentence.”</p>
<p>Judge Carr activated one month of the suspended sentence for the breach.</p>
<p>Jerome Dangar</p>
<p>A judge described genital mutilation and snuff images downloaded by a north Cornwall publican as being “as extreme as any image of this sort can be”.</p>
<p>Jerome Dangar, 44, formerly of the King Arthur’s Arms in Tintagel, was caught with the sickening images after a police raid in November and one pathologist who examined them stated that there was a strong possibility that they weren’t staged and that some of the subjects died during the filming process.</p>
<p>Dangar appeared at Truro Crown Court on January 7 for sentencing after previously pleading guilty to nine counts of possession of extreme pornographic images.</p>
<p>Opening the case, Philip Lee explained that Dangar was first arrested on May 30 when his mobile phone was seized, before he was arrested for a second time after police swooped on the pub on November 2.</p>
<p>His device revealed 47 extreme pornographic images of which 14 were videos, all created between September 2017 and May 2018.</p>
<p>Mr Lee said: “The images portray life-threatening acts and genital mutilation. It is clear the defendant had a preoccupation with strangulation, stabbing, torture, drowning, asphyxiation and death.</p>
<p>“Internet searches showed searches for terms such as ‘snuff’ and ‘snuff wants to be stabbed’. There were images containing asphyxiation and hanging in which there was a real risk to the human subjects.</p>
<p>“The images indicate signs of death or near death and a pathologist who examined the scenes has said there was a risk of serious harm and even death to some of the subjects.”</p>
<p>(Image: Adrian Jasper)</p>
<p>The pathologist said that although it was impossible to tell, the evidence suggested that they weren’t staged.</p>
<p>During police interview Dangar admitted carrying out the searches but said he believed the genital mutilation and strangulation to be staged.</p>
<p>When asked why he downloaded the material, Dangar denied it was for sexual gratification saying that it was “intrigue”.</p>
<p>Mr Lee concluded by saying that it was possible the subjects were forced to take part and that the images were “the most extreme one could imagine”.</p>
<p>Sentencing Dangar, Judge Simon Carr said: “You were found with images of deliberate genital torture and mutilation involving a number of people. They contained acts such as strangulation and asphyxiation and were as extreme as any image of this sort can be.</p>
<p>“The pathologist examining them said that the mutilation and amputation scenes had all the hallmarks of a genuine scene. He thinks that at least three of the people being tortured were dead by the end.</p>
<p>“You chose to search for them and clearly have an entrenched fascination.</p>
<p>“Both reports about you I’ve read are extremely concerned about the presentation you give. You still seek to minimise what you’ve done and every step of the way try to downplay the seriousness of your actions.</p>
<p>“I accept details of the offences have destroyed you both personally and professionally but you brought it on yourself.”</p>
<p>Judge Carr sentenced Dangar to 15 months in prison. Upon release he will be managed by a sexual risk order which will carefully monitor his internet usage.</p>
<p>It later emerged that Dangar was being investigated regarding the death of a young woman who died after an internet sex game went wrong. He was later found dead in prison.</p>
<p>Anthony Harrison</p>
<p>A judge forced three people responsible for the theft and fleecing of a 95-year-old woman’s bank card to watch a video in which she describes wanting to kill herself as a result of their crimes.</p>
<p>Judge Robert Linford requested the pensioner’s victim impact video be played to Anthony Michael Harrison, Kirsty Ann Parr and Tristan James Chenoweth, who, between them, burgled her house as she slept and then spent and laundered the contents of her bank account.</p>
<p>The trio appeared at Truro Crown Court on January 8 and admitted their various roles in the criminal process.</p>
<p>At the hearing, Harrison, 40, who is currently incarcerated at HMP Dartmoor, pleaded guilty to two burglaries in Newquay. Chenoweth, 38, of Cusgarne Hall in St Austell, admitted handling stolen goods and fraud by false representation and Parr, 31, of Treffry Court in Newquay, held her hands up to a concealing criminal property charge.</p>
<p>The three appeared at Truro Crown Court on Friday (January 9) for sentencing and prosecuting barrister Philip Lee said: “The 95-year-old burglary victim was at her home in Crantock Street on November 9, 2017, where she had lived for her whole life.</p>
<p>“Her home was burgled while she was asleep. She woke up at 3.15am and noticed something was out of place. She saw the front door open and then went and did some knitting, waiting for a carer to arrive.</p>
<p>“It was apparent there had been a break-in and there was a key safe on the floor with the key missing. There had been an untidy search and a purse containing cash, bank cards and family photos had been stolen from under her bed while she slept.</p>
<p>“Jewellery was stolen along with gold lockets of significant sentimental value.”</p>
<p>Mr Lee then described how it was apparent that one of the PIN numbers had been found and used to access her bank accounts.</p>
<p>He added: “A screwdriver was found on the floor with a DNA connection to Mr Harrison. Soon after, on November 10, two bank cards and a Post Office account were all used in local shops and at cash machines.</p>
<p>“There were ATM withdrawals of £1,100 in addition to £1,000 transferred from one account to the other and then £4,000 transferred into the Barclays account of Kirsty Parr.”</p>
<p>(Image: Sally Adams)</p>
<p>Mr Lee said that Chenoweth was responsible for taking one of the victim’s cards into Tesco and purchasing items worth £3 and getting £30 cashback.</p>
<p>Parr was caught on CCTV at the bank withdrawing £4,000 of the victim’s cash and Chenoweth identified at Tesco by the store’s camera system.</p>
<p>The court also heard how Harrison committed a second burglary a month later, also in Newquay, where he broke into a detached bungalow before leaving empty handed.</p>
<p>Judge Robert Linford then addressed the defendants and told them that it’s important they watched the victim impact video made by police so they could see the gravity of their crimes.</p>
<p>In the clip, the victim explained how she was born in the house but now feels “completely lost” and wishes she had a knife so she can kill herself.</p>
<p>She also stated that her life is no longer worth living and that the lockets had pictures of her ex-husband, sister and brother who was a pilot killed in the Second World War.</p>
<p>Harrison has 59 offences on his record including several for burglary, Chenoweth has 30 mainly for thefts and Parr one for drugs.</p>
<p>Representing Harrison, Chris Andrews said that he has limited mitigation apart from his early guilty plea.</p>
<p>He said: “I showed him the video (victim’s interview) this morning and he was appalled. I could see the colour drain out of his face and he wishes to express his sorrow and hopes an apology will be sent to the victim.</p>
<p>“On the day of the offence he was off his head on the drugs that have blighted his life. He has little recollection of events.”</p>
<p>(Image: Sally Adams)</p>
<p>Michael Gregson, mitigating for Chenoweth, said he has a longstanding drug habit and was at the time homeless and drug dependent.</p>
<p>Mr Gregson said Chenoweth was given the bank card by those who he knew through the drug trade. He was told to go and try it after it had been declined and hand over whatever he got from the transaction.</p>
<p>Mr Gregson said: “His benefit was limited and he didn’t know who the card had been stolen from.”</p>
<p>At this point in the proceedings Judge Linford interrupted and questioned how much Parr and Chenoweth knew about how the card was obtained.</p>
<p>Both of their legal representatives denied they had knowledge of the source of the card and Judge Linford ruled that there should be a separate hearing to determine whether they knew the card was stolen from an elderly victim.</p>
<p>He cast his doubts on Chenoweth and in particular Parr’s account and told them to return to the court at a future date, bailing them in the meantime.</p>
<p>Judge Linford then proceeded to sentence Harrison.</p>
<p>He said: “The victim is 95 and lived on her own in the house she’d lived in for all of her 95 years.</p>
<p>“Overnight she was alone asleep in bed when you burgled her home. You took a purse containing bank cards and cash from beneath her bed as she slept as well as very precious jewellery and even ate a small amount of her food.</p>
<p>“Within a few hours her cards were used to fleece her account and the effects of the burglary have been profound. I forced you to watch her victim personal statement because just maybe seeing the consequences of your offending may cause a change in your life.”</p>
<p>Judge Linford jailed Harrison for four and a half years. Chenoweth and Parr were later spared custodial sentences.</p>
<p>Lawrence Hiscox</p>
<p>A judge commended a burglar on the efforts he has made to turn his life around – but jailed him anyway.</p>
<p>Lawrence Hiscox, 32, of no fixed abode, appeared at Truro Crown Court for sentence after previously admitting an attempted burglary, two burglaries, three counts of fraud and possessing a Class B drug.</p>
<p>Prosecuting barrister Philip Lee told Judge Robert Linford how all the offences took place over one night in Bude in October 2017.</p>
<p>Hiscox attempted to break into the first property in Victoria Street while the occupant slept, later being identified from DNA left at the point of entry.</p>
<p>Then Hiscox moved onto Downs View where he stole tools and keys from an outside shed after gaining entry via an insure lock.</p>
<p>He then committed a further offence in Downs View where he entered a property through a wooden window and stole two computers, a wallet and a guitar worth a combined £3,350.</p>
<p>Mr Lee said: “One victim learned of fraudulent use of his card and it was discovered that the card was used for three transactions in local shops. Each just below the £30 contactless threshold.</p>
<p>“The shops’ CCTV showed that the defendant was responsible for the transactions.”</p>
<p>Hiscox was eventually arrested at his mum’s house in Bude and found with a small amount of cannabis.</p>
<p>Sentencing Hiscox, Judge Robert Linford said: “On one night in October 2017 you made your way around Bude burgling people’s properties. The evil of burglary is that once someone’s home is entered they never feel safe there again.</p>
<p>“Earlier today I sentenced a career burglar and made him watch a victim impact video so he could see the effects of his crime.</p>
<p>“You’ve never committed a burglary before and better never do it again. You’re not a man who enjoys good health and your life has been blighted by drink and drugs.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard the efforts you’ve been making to turn things around and I hope you succeed.”</p>
<p>Judge Linford then jailed Hiscox for 15 months.</p>
<p>Robert Monks</p>
<p>A drink driver killed his partner of 10 years after he lost control of his car and careered across a garage forecourt causing “a scene of devastation”.</p>
<p>Robert Monks, 39, and Kelly Pearce had been drinking at various pubs and at the Mevagissey Feast throughout the day on June 25, 2017, before being involved in the crash that killed Ms Pearce and damaged a total of 22 cars parked on the forecourt at Andrew Toms Car Sales.</p>
<p>Monks, who lives in Hewas Water, appeared at Truro Crown Court January 15 when he was due to stand trial for causing death by dangerous driving whilst over the drink drive limit.</p>
<p>After some negotiation, the prosecution and the defence agreed to accept the lesser charge of causing death by careless driving whilst over the drink drive limit, prosecution barrister Piers Norsworthy noting that both convictions would have attracted a similar sentence anyway.</p>
<p>Opening the case, Mr Norsworthy said that Ms Pearce was 40 at the time of her death but was due to turn 41 the following day.</p>
<p>He said: “Ms Pearce was the front seat passenger in the car when it left the road at Andrew Toms garage on the A390 road to Truro.</p>
<p>“The car left the road, crossed the verge, hit a traffic sign before colliding with cars on the forecourt. Members of the public and paramedics did what they could but Ms Pearce died at the scene.</p>
<p>“Earlier that day Mr Monks and Ms Pearce had visited a number of pubs and consumed alcohol. They left the Dolphin Inn in Grampound at 12:53pm before meeting friends for lunch at the Polgooth Inn.</p>
<p>“They left the Polgooth Inn at 2:15pm and were driven to the Mevagissey Feast. They arrived at 2:30pm and went to the Fountain Inn where they got a further drink.</p>
<p>“They returned from the Fountain Inn at 4:15pm and were driven back to the Polgooth Inn where Mr Monks had a Thatchers cider and a further round.</p>
<p>“They left the Polgooth Inn at 8:47pm with Mr Monks as the driver and Ms Pearce as the passenger and arrived at the Kingswood Bar &amp; Restaurant where they had another drink.</p>
<p>“They were seen on CCTV leaving at 9:34pm and visited KFC in St Austell, ordering food and departing at about 9:38pm. The collision as reported just over five minutes later when residents rushed to the scene to assist.”</p>
<p>Mr Norsworthy described how a back calculation of the alcohol in Monks’ blood showed there to be 97 micrograms in 100 ml of blood, although he did say it could have been a lot higher than that. The legal limit is 80mcg.</p>
<p>He added: “Mr Monks would have been over the drink drive limit at the time of the collision and should have known his consumption of alcohol during the day and before the accident meant he was over the limit.”</p>
<p>A total of 22 cars were damaged at the forecourt and Monk’s Vauxhall Vectra was said to be “barely recognisable”.</p>
<p>His speed at the time of loss of control was calculated at 77mph in a 50mph limit and neither Monks nor Ms Pearce were found to be wearing a seatbelt.</p>
<p>Mr Norsworthy said: “Ms Pearce died of a significant head injury and three vehicles describe being overtaken by Mr Monks shortly before the collision. The drivers had even spoken to their passengers about the manner of his driving.</p>
<p>“There was no indication of Mr Monks putting the car’s lights on and it is common sense to conclude that excess speed and a consumption of alcohol caused him to lose control. There were no environmental or mechanical reasons that could have caused the crash.”</p>
<p>Sentencing Monks, Judge Simon Carr said: “On June 25, 2017, Kelly Pearce lost her life. She would have been 41 the next day.</p>
<p>“The effect on her family and friends is incalculable and they have to come to terms with an entirely pointless death that could have been avoided. Nothing this court can do will minimise the pain.</p>
<p>“It is clear you and Kelly Pearce, your partner, had been drinking steadily throughout the day. You were drinking at a number of different pubs and events.</p>
<p>“Most strikingly for me is that not only had you been drinking for many hours, your last act was to drink a pint of cider. You must have known you were over the limit and by some distance.</p>
<p>“You drove a relatively short distance but drove appallingly. Knowing you’d been drinking you reached speeds of over 70 miles per hour on roads that vary between a 50 and 60 limit.</p>
<p>“Three cars speak of being overtaken by you. Any sensible driver would have had their lights on but you did not. You drove very close behind other vehicle before overtaking.</p>
<p>“Photos show you lost control and ploughed through an area of verge before driving onto a garage forecourt. You damaged at least 22 vehicles and collided directly with 12. The pictures of your own car are truly chilling.</p>
<p>“Ms Pearce’s injuries were unsurvivable. I accept your suffered serious injuries yourself and lost your partner of 10 years but it was through your own decision.”</p>
<p>Judge Carr jailed Monks for five years and banned from driving for seven and a half years.</p>
<p>Jack Ozkan and Rhys Bryce</p>
<p>A Newquay-based drugs gang was sentenced for an operation which saw thousands of pounds worth of incredibly high purity cocaine trafficked into Cornwall.</p>
<p>Between them Jack Ozkan, Rhys Bryce and Laura Delemere transported and laundered large amounts of class A drugs and its proceeds, even stashing some of it on the top of a wardrobe in a house lived in by Delemere and her two young children.</p>
<p>Last summer Ozkan, 26, of Henver Road in Newquay, appeared at Truro Crown Court where he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply cocaine, conspiracy to supply cannabis and possession with intent to supply cocaine.</p>
<p>Bryce and Delemere had been due to stand trial earlier this week but both entered guilty pleas at the last minute, sparing the need for a trial.</p>
<p>Bryce admitted identical counts to Ozkan, whereas Delemere pleaded guilty to two converting criminal property charges.</p>
<p>Opening the case, Philip Lee described how the incident that gave rise to the prosecution took place on May 4, 2017, at around 4:45pm when police stopped a Hyundai on the A30 at Victoria.</p>
<p>Mr Lee said: “The driver was Mr Ozkan and front seat passenger Mr Bryce.</p>
<p>“Officers smelt cannabis and behind one the seats was a bag containing 276 grams of cannabis and 125 grams of high purity cocaine. They also found smaller amounts of cocaine and cannabis.</p>
<p>“Both were arrested and police found that the vehicle they were travelling in was a rental car rented in the name of Laura Delemere.</p>
<p>“Following the arrests officers searched [an address in] Church Street in St Columb, the address Laura Delmere lived in with her children. Rhys Bryce was the father of the two young children and he had also stayed in the property.</p>
<p>“A search found one bag on top of a dresser with 13 grams of cocaine in it, as well as £5,000 in cash and weighing scales.”</p>
<p>The cocaine in the car was judged to be of 96% purity worth more than £10,000 when sold on the street and the cocaine in the house 86%, with a potential value of £1,100.</p>
<p>Mr Lee said that the purity “indicated a proximity to the source of importation”. The cannabis was estimated to be worth £2,700.</p>
<p>A total of £5,275 in case was found as well as dealer’s lists.</p>
<p>Mr Lee added: “Three phones were seized from the car, one Ozkan admitted ownership of, that phone containing text messages showing he was involved in the supply of drugs.</p>
<p>“Both Delemere and Bryce refused to provide pin numbers for their phones and the hire car’s data showed it went to the West Midlands and back that day, what we say was a drugs run to obtain the drugs.</p>
<p>“Ms Delemere hired 30 vehicles in the two years before the arrests and Bryce’s bank accounts showed significant cash deposits. Delemere had four active bank accounts which showed cash deposits of over £8,000. There were multiple transfers between the accounts.”</p>
<p>Sentencing the trio, Judge Robert Linford said: “On May 4 a car driven by you Mr Ozkan was stopped on the A30. Mr Bryce was the front seat passenger.</p>
<p>“In the car was 125 grams of high purity cocaine and cannabis. When Mr Bryce and Ms Delemere’s home was searched 13 grams of cocaine of abnormally high purity was also discovered. An examination of your account Ms Delemere shows you were active in the laundering of money.</p>
<p>“Laura Delemere I reflect on your circumstances, your health problems and your military history but you knew full well what you were up to. Your refusal to provide your pin code almost tipped the balance.”</p>
<p>Delemere was given a one year prison sentence, suspended for two years and made subject of a four month, Thursday to Sunday 8pm to 6am curfew.</p>
<p>Ozkan was jailed for three years and Bryce 32 months.</p>
<p>Marcin Kuc</p>
<p>A fraudster was sent to prison for going on spending sprees with two stolen bank cards.</p>
<p>The trial of Marcin Kuc, 35, of Basset Street in Camborne, got underway at Truro Crown Court on January 21.</p>
<p>Polish national Kuc denied two counts of burglary but had at previous hearings admitted fraud charges relating to using the bank cards.</p>
<p>The prosecution alleged that Kuc entered two properties in Rosevean Avenue and Trenance Road in May and June of last year and took the cards. However after a period of deliberation a jury said they were unable to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that Kuc was responsible for entering the homes and found him not guilty of the burglaries.</p>
<p>In respect of the fraud charges already admitted, Judge Simon Carr jailed Kuc for three months.</p>
<p>The first victim, an elderly woman, didn’t cancel her card until the following day and in that time the defendant used it to withdraw cash and obtain goods at various stores in Camborne.</p>
<p>The first use of the card was at 3:14pm on that afternoon of the burglary when the defendant withdrew £500 in cash at Tesco.</p>
<p>Within 10 minutes of the second card going missing Kuc was making use of the cards.</p>
<p>Prosecution barrister Ed Bailey said: “At 6:47pm at the Arkwrights store close by he made a series of contactless payments for scratch cards. He then moved on to Tesco where, at 7pm, he made further use of the card with contactless payments. He obtained £100 in scratchcards before being arrested on June 9 and interviewed the following day.</p>
<p>“Mr Kuc denied he was responsible for either of the burglaries. In relation to the Rosevean Avenue break-in Mr Kuc claimed he found the card on the ground. When it was put to him that CCTV showed him using the card in Tesco and he was asked how he worked out the PIN number he said he didn’t know before going on to say that maybe he &lsquo;probably guessed it&rsquo;.</p>
<p>“When asked about the burglary on June 7 the defendant denied finding any bank cards that day. When questioned about CCTV footage 40 minutes after the burglary showing him using a Halifax card he said he must have found it somewhere.</p>
<p>“Mr Kuc has pleaded guilty to the fraudulent use of the stolen bank accounts but says he wasn’t responsible for the burglaries. He was in recent possession of the stolen items, lied during the court of his interview about finding the cards in the street and never said how he worked out the PIN to withdraw the cash.”</p>
<p>Ryan Leicester</p>
<p>A violent drunk launched a Christmas Day assault last year during which he sliced the tip off a man’s finger with a broken plate and repeatedly struck a woman in a house full of children.</p>
<p>Ryan Leicester, 32, attacked the man and woman - whose names we’ve changed to Mr and Mrs Smith to protect the identities of their children who witnessed the ordeal - as they celebrated Christmas Day together in south east Cornwall.</p>
<p>Leicester appeared at Truro Crown Court for sentence after admitting assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and breaching a restraining order at an earlier hearing at Truro Magistrates’ Court.</p>
<p>Prosecuting the case, Emma Cross, described how Leicester and his partner Danielle Bull visited the home of neighbours Mr and Mrs Smith for the festive celebration in December just gone.</p>
<p>Miss Cross said: “Mr and Mrs Smith were separated but still friends. Mr Smith and the children went to see Mrs Smith and Mr Leicester and Miss Bull were also invited.</p>
<p>“Lunch went well and all the adults had been drinking. Mr Leicester drank the most and was unsteady on his feet.</p>
<p>“At 4:45 in the afternoon the atmosphere changed. Mr Leicester was asleep on the sofa and when Miss Bull woke him up they began arguing.</p>
<p>“Mr Leicester got up and fell onto the seven-year-old child. The children were frightened and Mr Leicester and Miss Bull began to hit each other.</p>
<p>“Mr Smith unsuccessfully attempted to separate them and at that point Mr Leicester turned on the gas burners. When Mrs Smith tried to turn them off Mr Leicester turned and headbutted her before punching her in the face.</p>
<p>“Mr Smith came into the kitchen and pushed Mr Leicester, Mr Leicester then pinning Mrs Smith to the wall and landing further blows to her head and chest.</p>
<p>“Mr Smith pushed Mr Leicester to the floor and the defendant then got up and started throwing plates. Mr Leicester kept coming at Mr Smith and he then picked up a smashed plate and slashed down his hand.”</p>
<p>The injury resulted in a deep laceration to Mr Smith’s thumb, the top of it almost clean off leaving the bone exposed.</p>
<p>Mrs Smith was left with a split lip, cuts to her shin and severe facial bruising.</p>
<p>Miss Cross added that all of this took place with children present and that Mr Smith stuff suffers pain from the injury he sustained. Mrs Smith said in a victim person statement that her injuries have left her “judged” by members of the community and that she had to take a week off work as a result.</p>
<p>The children won’t go to sleep unless Mrs Smith is upstairs and they still talk about what happened on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>Regarding the restraining order breach, the court heard how Leicester had lived with Miss Bull for a year despite being barred from doing so by the court.</p>
<p>Leicester also has a criminal history of drunken violence.</p>
<p>Sentencing Leicester, Judge Simon Carr said: “You were celebrating Christmas Day with your neighbours and got very drunk with young children present. What started as a minor agreement turned into violence.”</p>
<p>Judge Carr proceeded to rap Leicester for his history of violence and failure to adhere to court orders.</p>
<p>Leicester was jailed for a year and made subject of a restraining order preventing him from approaching Mr and Mrs Smith.</p>
<p>The restraining order for Miss Bull remains in place until it is removed via the official channels.</p>
<p>David Carroll</p>
<p>A paedophile reconnected with an old friend so that he could go on to film himself abusing her young daughter.</p>
<p>David Carroll, who had already served time for being in possession of indecent images of children, wormed his way back into the life of the old companion before going on to perform the sick act on the child.</p>
<p>When asked why he had been to prison, Carroll, 28, told her it was “for computers and hacking”.</p>
<p>Carroll from Pengegon Parc, Camborne, appeared at Truro Crown Court for sentencing after previously admitting three counts of failing to comply with his notification requirements as a relevant offender, causing or inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity, two counts of taking an indecent photograph of a child, rape of a child under 13 and three counts of making indecent images of children.</p>
<p>Prosecuting the case, Philip Lee, said that Carroll was cautioned in 2011 for making indecent images of children and possessing prohibited images of children.</p>
<p>In March 2016 he was sentenced to two years in prison for similar offences and as a result subject to notification requirements on his release, as well as the terms of a Sexual Harm Prevention Order.</p>
<p>Mr Lee said: “Further concerns arose in September 2017 during a house visit by a monitoring officer. The defendant’s phone showed evidence of sexual communications with a child.</p>
<p>“In April 2018 there was a further visit following an allegation that the defendant was using a friend’s computer for the purposes of sexual communication with a child. When the police arrived the defendant appeared to be deleting material.</p>
<p>“An examination of his phone revealed not only indecent images of children but also photos of a child being abused by the user of the device taken in February 2018.</p>
<p>“The girl (aged under 10) being abused was the daughter of an old friend. The mother had been close with the defendant but they drifted apart.</p>
<p>“The defendant resumed contact with the mother after some time and told her that he went to jail for ‘computers and hacking’.</p>
<p>“He visited her on February 10 and stayed overnight. She had no idea of his convictions or the risk he posed to her children so he carried on visiting.”</p>
<p>Mr Lee then described how the defendant took 10 photos of himself abusing the child while she slept, adding “mercifully the child was asleep and unaware of what was happening”.</p>
<p>A victim personal statement from the mother detailed how she was physically sick when she learned what Carroll had done and has since carried a huge burden of guilt for not suspecting he had a sexual interest in children.</p>
<p>Sentencing Carroll, Judge Simon Carr said: “On March 11, 2016, you were sentenced to a term of prison for possession of child abuse images and extreme pornography.</p>
<p>“As a result there were restrictions on your behaviour and access to the internet. People checked your phone on a regular basis and on one occasion an officer was, I’m sure, horrified at the images he observed.</p>
<p>“You had been friends with the woman for many years but drifted apart before some time later the friendship restarted. I have no doubt a significant part of the reason was so you could have access to children.</p>
<p>“She was wholly unaware of your offending and the photos show an 18 minute assault on a child who appears to be asleep.</p>
<p>“You filmed all of this happening as you wanted to be able to relive what you had carried out. You flagrantly breached your notification requirements by staying in this woman’s house with her children.</p>
<p>“It is perfectly clear you have an entrenched sexual interest in children and this explains your befriending of the mother and the filming of the abuse you carried out.”</p>
<p>Judge Carr added that he had no hesitation to conclude that Carroll poses a significant risk to children and as a result passed an extended sentence of 19 years, consisting of 14 in custody and five on licence.</p>
<p>Daniel Reigate</p>
<p>A paedophile who touched the genitals of a young girl told her he was “trying to make her feel nice” was sent to prison.</p>
<p>Daniel Reigate, 38, from Ruddlemoor in St Austell, appeared at Truro Crown Court to be sentenced on January 31 after previously pleading guilty to two counts of sexual assault.</p>
<p>Reigate had previously pleaded guilty on the day he was due to stand trial.</p>
<p>The charges relate to the touching of intimate parts of the girl’s naked body and the stroking of her thighs and breast.</p>
<p>Prosecuting barrister Philip Lee told a packed courtroom how the girl confided in family members saying that the defendant “touched her in places she didn’t like”.</p>
<p>Mr Lee added that the girl complained that Reigate touched her sexually saying that he “wanted her to feel nice”.</p>
<p>Reigate, who has no previous convictions, denied the allegations to police and in a victim personal statement the victim spoke of anxiety in the build-up of the scheduled trial fearing that she would have to give evidence.</p>
<p>Sentencing Reigate, Judge Robert Linford said: “You are a 38-year-old man with no previous convictions.</p>
<p>“On the day the case was listed for trial, to the immense relief of the victim, you finally summoned up the courage to plead guilty.</p>
<p>“Pleas of guilty in this sort of case are vanishingly rare but you essentially groomed her for your own sexual purposes.</p>
<p>“I’ve read the victim personal statement and it’s very clear your behaviour has had a profound effect on the victim. Had you admitted what you’d done from the outset she would have been saved much mental anguish.</p>
<p>“Your mitigation is your plea, albeit late, the fact you have no previous convictions and the remorse you’ve expressed which I regard as genuine.</p>
<p>“I’ve read a large number of references which speak enormously highly of you from people who are at a loss to explain why you behaved in this way.</p>
<p>“That said, this case is far too serious for anything other than a custodial sentence.”</p>
<p>Reigate was jailed for 47 months.</p>
<p>February</p>
<p>Matthew Adams</p>
<p>A bungling burglar who left his ID and fingerprints at several crime scenes was jailed for five years after stealing nearly £15,000 of cash and jewellery from his victims, including charity monies from Cornwall ’s most popular rugby club.</p>
<p>Dad-of-one Matthew Adams, who last lived at the Freshstart housing project in St Austell, appeared before Truro Crown Court via video link from Exeter Prison, and pleaded guilty to seven burglary offences.</p>
<p>He also asked the judge to take a further ten offences into consideration.</p>
<p>Adams, 39, formerly of Newquay, was only released from prison in September after serving two years of a four-year prison term for other offences.</p>
<p>After his release Adams stayed out of trouble for over two months as he made attempts to gain employment, but he began reoffending after using Class A drugs again.</p>
<p>Between November 22, 2018, and January 1, 2019, Adams committed a series of burglaries in locations across Cornwall.</p>
<p>In total he stole nearly £1,700 in cash and £12,850 worth of jewellery, as well as other items. The cost of repairing the damage he caused from breaking into the numerous premises exceeded £1,000.</p>
<p>Prosecuting, Philip Lee told the court how Adams’ first offence took place overnight sometime between November 22 and November 25 last year.</p>
<p>His target was the No.8 Hair And Beauty Lounge in St Austell, where he stole £17.50 in cash. Adams committed another overnight burglary in mid-December, stealing £130 in cash from Cornwall College St Austell’s beauty department.</p>
<p>A day or two later he returned to the St Austell college campus, again overnight, this time taking £30 in cash and an iPhone from a room.</p>
<p>For his fourth offence, Adams targeted the home of a family in Penzance during daytime, stealing jewellery worth £2,850, and Army service medals of significant sentimental value to the victim.</p>
<p>Adams’ next target was the headquarters of the Cornish Pirates rugby club in Penzance. He stole £1,200 in cash, which were the proceeds of a collection for the Cornwall Air Ambulance, and caused £800 worth of damage. Adams left a wallet behind at the scene which contained an ID card.</p>
<p>Adams then targeted another Penzance home in a daytime raid, again stealing jewellery, this time worth £10,000. He also took £300 in cash and another item worth £500.</p>
<p>The final offence saw him burgle a retired man in Penzance. Adams took several items such as watches and jewellery, including the man’s wedding ring.</p>
<p>Adams left traces of his DNA and fingerprints behind at nearly all of the crime scenes.</p>
<p>He was arrested on January 13 and made full admissions to police in interview. He described having a serious addiction to heroin and crack cocaine and said any cash he stole was always spent on drugs. Adams asserted that he did not act alone during the course most of the burglaries.</p>
<p>The court heard that he has a lengthy criminal record, dating back to 1995, with 22 court appearances.</p>
<p>Sentencing Adams to five years in jail, Judge Robert Linford said it was a “tragedy” that Adams feels safer when inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am wholly prepared to accept that upon release you sought help for various problems you had, and you got none,&rdquo; Judge Linford said. “I am prepared to accept that you applied unsuccessfully for work and that you struggled with the amount of benefits you received.</p>
<p>“For a couple of months you kept the conditions of your licence. But then you embarked on a spate of offending which demonstrates that in fact you are a career burglar.</p>
<p>“The people whose homes you invaded will never forget what you did to them. They will never forget it. They will never feel safe in their home again.</p>
<p>“It is to your enormous credit that you cooperated as fully as you did with police. You also admitted offences which otherwise would have remained unprosecuted. At least these people know the burglar has been caught.</p>
<p>“You say to your advocate that you feel safer on the inside than on the outside and that is an enormous tragedy for you.”</p>
<p>Kevin Strefford</p>
<p>A man was jailed after going on a rampage during a five-hour stand-off with police on top of an 11-storey tower block – before committing another offence while awaiting sentence.</p>
<p>Kevin Strefford, 32, previously of St Austell but now living in St Columb Minor, appeared at Truro Crown Court for sentencing after pleading guilty to three charges.</p>
<p>Police were called shortly after 1pm on Monday, November 12, 2018, following reports of a man, Strefford, being seen on the roof of a block of flats in Bridge Road, St Austell.</p>
<p>The incident sparked a massive emergency response with police officers, fire crews and paramedics. Several roads in the area had to be closed.</p>
<p>Prosecuting, Philip Lee described how Strefford spent five hours on the roof of Park House, a 67-flat block managed by Ocean Housing.</p>
<p>Officers were shown to the 11th floor by the caretaker, and saw how the man on the roof, identified as Strefford, had smashed a door to gain entry to it.</p>
<p>When officers confronted Strefford, he said, “if you come up here I’ll jump off this roof and take you with me”.</p>
<p>He then struck the door frame, showering the officers and caretaker in glass, causing minor injuries.</p>
<p>He then shouted, “I’ll kill them if they come up”, and added, “look what I’ve had to do to get help”, before making repeated threats to jump off the building.</p>
<p>Strefford was seen dangling his legs over the edge of the roof, and shouted, “in five or ten or so seconds all this sh*t will be over”.</p>
<p>He threw objects off the roof, including large pieces of glass which landed in the car park of a nearby doctor’s surgery, causing it to close. Pieces of glass were also found in a children’s play area.</p>
<p>It was estimated that Strefford’s rampage caused £1,460 worth of damage, plus a further £1,000 in losses for the disruption of building work.</p>
<p>The incident prompted police to instruct residents to stay away from their homes while the situation was made safe. Negotiators spent the whole time trying to bring the man off of the roof. He finally came down shortly after 6pm.</p>
<p>He was later arrested and faced charges of affray and criminal damage. When interviewed, Strefford said he went onto the roof to “make a point that he needed help for his mental health”.</p>
<p>Strefford has battled drug addiction and mental health problems for some time.</p>
<p>“I need to be admitted to Longreach [mental health unit] for treatment, not jailed,” he told officers.</p>
<p>Strefford denied intending to harm anybody, and said he couldn’t remember throwing things from the roof.</p>
<p>He was asked about a post he wrote on social media during the standoff, in which he said, “I&rsquo;m on the news”.</p>
<p>Officers asked Strefford if he found the whole situation amusing. He replied: “A little bit yeah, everyone was messaging me and telling me to jump”.</p>
<p>Since 1999 Strefford has been in court 38 times for over 100 offences, many of which resulted in prison sentences.</p>
<p>Strefford was due to be sentenced on January 25, but failed to turn up to court.</p>
<p>Just a day later, he stole a rucksack from a train at St Austell, containing goods worth over £800. The matter was reported, and Strefford was recognised on CCTV.</p>
<p>Half of the items, which included clothes and shoes, have not been recovered.</p>
<p>During the sentencing hearing for the rooftop offences, Strefford pleaded guilty to an additional charge of theft.</p>
<p>Judge Simon Carr said that Strefford’s reoffending while awaiting sentencing for the rooftop saga left him with no choice but to jail him for ten months.</p>
<p>“I accept that all of this was some form of a cry for help,&rdquo; Judge Carr said. &ldquo;But this was a serious event which was a risk to society in general.</p>
<p>“When you first came in front of me, I had the sense in looking at whether there was an alternative [to a prison sentence]. I took that unusual course. Your reaction to that opportunity has been at best mixed.</p>
<p>“You failed to attend a probation appointment and this court. In many ways what was even more of a worry, is that you were unable to stop offending.</p>
<p>“At the time when you were due for sentence for these matters you committed a deliberate theft. This puts the court in a nigh on impossible position.”</p>
<p>Strefford must serve half of his ten-month sentence. He will be on licence for a further 12 months upon release.</p>
<p>Byron Grenfell (case heard at Exeter Crown Court)</p>
<p>A &ldquo;savage&rdquo; stalker who repeatedly attacked his ex partner and pestered with illegal phone calls from prison was jailed and banned from going to St Austell.</p>
<p>Byron Grenfell has been jailed four times for attacks on the woman and was banned from any contact with her by a restraining order. He flouted the ban by sending her letters while he was in Exeter Prison and used illegally held mobile phones to call her and send stream of text messages.</p>
<p>He was arrested at the gates of the prison as he was released from the latest jail term last month, Exeter Crown Court was told.</p>
<p>Grenfell, aged 33, of Forth Scol, Illogan, near Redruth, admitted breaching a restraining order and was jailed for a year by Judge Peter Johnson, who extended the scope of the order to ban him from entering the woman&rsquo;s home town of St Austell.</p>
<p>He told him: &ldquo;You have a long history of inflicting violence on your former partner. When in temper, you have assaulted her, sometimes in a savage way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were sentenced in November but within a short time you breached the restraining order time after time. You subjected her to a barrage of calls, some unanswered, text messages and letters</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the attempts to contact her were successful. These are serious matters and made more serious because you must have used an unauthorised phone while in Exeter Prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gareth Evans, prosecuting, said the victim answered one call, which came from an untraceable number, and Grenfell told her he had fixed everything and they could get back together when he came out.</p>
<p>He said she had been upset by the contacts and denied that she had initiated any of them.</p>

<p>A drunk who turned up to court paralytic was jailed after a judge said releasing her would be setting her up to fail.</p>
<p>Melisa Geach, 35, of Park Gywn in St Stephen, appeared in Truro Crown Court 20 days after being sent to prison to sober up after she arrived at court unable to stand.</p>
<p>She was falling over in the court foyer before being helped into the dock where she sat staring into space.</p>
<p>Geach had been due to return to court one week later to be sentenced but the hearing was cancelled due to the snow that caused disruption across the south west.</p>
<p>Finally, on February 12, Geach returned to the court from HMP Eastwood Park to be sentenced for the original offences of affray, possession of a weapon and criminal damage.</p>
<p>Prosecuting the case, Neil Whittle said: “On September 5 at approximately 4.10pm the defendant showed up outside her auntie’s premises.</p>
<p>“The people inside heard a doorbell and banging on the door and one of the occupants saw her outside carrying a black handled kitchen knife with a large blade.</p>
<p>“She started kicking on the door with her feet, shouting, ‘I’m going to stab you, I’ve got a knife’.</p>
<p>“The defendant then put the knife through the letterbox and moved it around before stabbing the back of the door nine or 10 times.</p>
<p>“She was shouting, ‘I love you, but I’m going to kill you, come out and fight’.”</p>
<p>The court heard how Geach continued stabbing the door. The victims said that had she gained access they were sure she would have attacked them.</p>
<p>In mitigation Judge Simon Carr was told of Geach’s difficulty with alcohol addiction but that she had the support of her family who were present in court.</p>
<p>Sentencing Geach, Judge Carr said: “I accept the challenges and difficulties you face for which I can only have sympathy.</p>
<p>“On the day in question you armed yourself with a knife and went to someone’s house. You forced the knife through the letterbox and stabbed the door. It must have been terrifying for everyone inside.</p>
<p>“The matter was put off for a probation report but you turned up so drunk you couldn’t stand. Letting you out now will be setting you up to fail but I do hope you can access the help you need when you are released.”</p>
<p>Geach was jailed for 12 months.</p>
<p>Peter Drummond</p>
<p>A Ministry of Defence police officer who was jailed for having sex with a 14-year-old girl from Cornwall has been branded a disgrace to his family and the organisation he was employed by.</p>
<p>On February 18 Cornwall Live reported how 38-year-old Peter Drummond was convicted by a jury at Truro Crown Court of three counts of sexual activity with a child.</p>
<p>Drummond made two separate brief trips to Cornwall from his home in West View Terrace, Three Mile Cross, Berkshire, in October and November 2017.</p>
<p>He tracked down the vulnerable victim’s address using the maps feature on popular app Snapchat and proceeded to have sex with her on both occasions. On his first visit he entered through an unlocked back gate and on the second he climbed in through the girl’s bedroom window while her step father was also in the house.</p>
<p>It took a jury just three hours to convict him of the three sexual activity with a child charges, however he was cleared of three counts of rape.</p>
<p>Drummond denied the charges throughout but did admit to having ‘consensual’ sex with the girl, saying that he had no reason to believe she was under the legal age of consent.</p>
<p>Drummond met the victim on a Kik internet chatroom before their conversations moved to Instagram, Skype and Snapchat.</p>
<p>Throughout the trial the court heard how Drummond’s DNA was found in the victim’s room and that he had made a £30 bank transfer into her account so that she could buy shoes. He was also clocked on his way to Cornwall by automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras.</p>
<p>When police arrived to arrest Drummond he didn’t immediately come down to greet officers, time that he used to quickly reset his phone and erase its history.</p>
<p>A victim personal statement read to the court heard how the victim had to move schools because of bullying she received once the rumour had spread around her school.</p>
<p>She describes feeling broken and even on one occasion attempting to take her life.</p>
<p>The girl’s family is also said to have suffered as a consequence of Drummond’s offending, with her mum unable to work night shifts in order to be with her daughter and the her stepfather leaving the family as a result of the stress associated with the proceedings.</p>
<p>The mother said that it has left her daughter “utterly destroyed”.</p>
<p>Sentencing Drummond, Judge Simon Carr said the circumstances are “as shocking as they are depressing”.</p>
<p>He said: “You were a 37-year-old man with a responsible job. You chose to socialise in a variety of chatrooms where you conceded in your evidence you were as likely to meet teenagers as adults.</p>
<p>“You met the victim, a 14-year-old girl, with significant psychological problems and she opened up to you that she was unhappy and had been self-harming.</p>
<p>“The action of any decent human being was to get her help or to try and contact her parents but you are not a decent human being. You exploited your position as you had found someone you could manipulate.</p>
<p>“You pretended to show care and have her interests at heart but the way you met her showed you were interested in her sexually.</p>
<p>“You drove five hours and went into her house when you knew her parents were not present. You were in her house for around one and a half hours. Once you’d had sex with her you didn’t comfort her, you left her and drove home to be with your family.</p>
<p>(Image: GetReading)</p>
<p>“One would have thought your moral compass would have said this must never happen again but you continued your communication with her and next time you visited you took a condom as sex was the only thing on your mind.</p>
<p>“You got in this time through the window because her stepfather was in the house. I suspect this was part of the thrill.</p>
<p>“The effect on the victim has been devastating. She has been bullied and forced to leave her school. The effect has not just been on her but her mother. Her stepfather had to come to terms with the fact he’d been present while you were with the victim and his relationship with the girl’s mother broke down.</p>
<p>“There was an element of planning and grooming and you knew she was underage, or at least would have soon from the beginning.”</p>
<p>Drummond was jailed for eight years and told he must sign the sex offenders’ register for life.</p>
<p>Detective Inspector Paul Norlund, senior investigating officer, welcomed the sentence.</p>
<p>He said: “Devon and Cornwall Police welcome the eight-year jail sentence for Peter Drummond in this complex and serious case.</p>
<p>“The young victim has conducted herself courageously throughout this enquiry and shown a tremendous strength of character whilst giving evidence at the trial to allow us to bring this dangerous and callous offender to justice. Whilst we hope that this verdict will allow her to find closure, this will be an ordeal that she will live with for a considerable time.</p>
<p>“She has been supported by specialist officers and her family throughout, and we would ask that her and her family are left in peace and to be given the space that will hopefully allow them to move forward from this sad episode.</p>
<p>“Peter Drummond is a disgrace to his family and the organisation he was employed by. He has refused to show any remorse for his premeditated actions and put his victim both through the ordeal of these attacks and forcing her to relive those painful memories in court.”</p>
<p>Andrew Hatrey</p>
<p>A violent thug who launched a terrifying assault after turning up at a man’s door armed with a mallet and samurai sword was jailed.</p>
<p>Andrew Hatrey, 36, of Callington, screamed at the victim and hit him so hard in the chest that he broke the head off the mallet.</p>
<p>Hatrey appeared at Truro Crown Court to be sentenced after previously pleading guilty to assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, possession of a bladed article and possession of an offensive weapon.</p>
<p>Prosecuting the case, Felicity Payne told the court how the attack took place on December 22, 2018, at the victim’s top floor flat he shared with his partner.</p>
<p>Ms Payne said that the couple heard the buzzer and saw a woman so let her into the block and then opened the door to her.</p>
<p>However once the door was opened, the woman moved out the way leaving the defendant menacingly standing there.</p>
<p>Ms Payne said: “The defendant was known to the victim and the victim describes him as fairly dangerous and someone he tries to keep on the right side of. He has a reputation for violent offences.</p>
<p>“Mr Hatrey closed the door behind him and the victim could smell alcohol on his breath. He asked him if he’d been drinking and he said ‘yeah, been on the voddy’.”</p>
<p>Ms Payne described how Hatrey then pulled out a samurai sword with a one foot long blade and a mallet in his other hand.</p>
<p>She said: “His eyes were wild and he was screaming ‘have you got any money’ and ‘I’m fed up with people mugging me off’. When the victim told the defendant he had no money he said ‘you must have something’. The victim describes the defendant swinging the mallet and hitting him in the upper chest.”</p>
<p>Hatrey continued to strike out at the victim as well as moving towards him with the sword. It was a second blow with the mallet that caused it to break.</p>
<p>The victim and his partner have since relocated away from Callington through fear of Hatrey, who has a string of convictions for both violence and other offences.</p>
<p>Sentencing Hatrey, Judge Simon Carr said: “Whatever the reason is you got in a dispute with the complainant, seemingly over drugs.</p>
<p>“You deliberately armed yourself with a sword and a mallet and went to the victim’s house. When the door opened you carried out a sustained assault on him. The injuries were modest but not by intention.”</p>
<p>Hatrey was jailed for two years.</p>
<p>Matthew Morton</p>
<p>A burglar who made headlines when he pooed into an envelope he left in the house of one of his victims has appeared in court again, for raiding the same property twice in two days.</p>
<p>Matthew Morton, 33, formerly of Pensilva, was given a 20-month sentence at Truro Crown Court in September of last year in relation to a burglary in Liskeard during which he was caught red-handed.</p>
<p>Morton stole a number of items during the raid but bizarrely tried to blame the victims, saying they grabbed him, pulled him inside and put items in his pockets.</p>
<p>It was during this raid that Morton decided to poo in an envelope, an act that was described in court as &ldquo;particularly unpleasant&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Despite being a serving prisoner Morton returned to Truro Crown Court on February 19 to be sentenced for four burglaries that pre-date the one for which he was sentenced in September.</p>
<p>Prosecuting barrister Felicity Payne told the court how the offences Morton was being sentenced for took place on May 22 of last year and then August 14, 16 and 18, all in the Liskeard area.</p>
<p>She said: “The offences all took place without the defendant having to force entry and were all carried out while the occupants were at work. On each occasion he removed various objects and managed to leave undetected.</p>
<p>“On May 22 the defendant removed a panel of glass next to the backdoor and took items including a PS4 (PlayStation games console), games and cash. He left by unlocking the front door from the inside and was later identified by DNA left on a table.</p>
<p>“On August 14 a couple returned from work and noticed various items removed and a backdoor unlocked.</p>
<p>“Various items were missing, including a jewellery box, a gold locket and chain and a camera with an SD (memory) card containing pictures that hadn’t been backed up. The defendant’s DNA was located on the door above the cat flap. It appeared he got the key for the backdoor through the cat flap.</p>
<p>“The defendant then returned to the same premises two days later after the occupants failed to spot their spare keys had been taken. They came from work to again find that various other items had been stolen.</p>
<p>“On August 18 a home owner left his front door unlocked while he walked his dog and returned to find that his safe containing items such as his passport had been stolen. Fortunately the defendant was stopped and detained at a neighbouring property in the process of another burglary and the safe was recovered.”Sentencing Morton for the second time in six months, Judge Simon Carr noted aggravating features including Morton’s poor record, the targeting of a home for a second time and the theft of sentimental items.</p>
<p>He was sentenced to 21 months in prison to take into account the existing sentence for which he is serving time.</p>
<p>Margaret Parsons</p>
<p>An alcoholic with a tendency for stabbing people during drunken arguments was jailed for a third time after attacking her partner who she met on the dating website Plenty of Fish after a boozy row.</p>
<p>Margaret Parsons, 53, had been released on licence from a previous sentence when she attacked her partner on Christmas Eve with a kitchen knife.</p>
<p>Parsons, of Clifden Road in St Austell, appeared at Truro Crown Court for sentence on February 21 after admitting a wounding charge.</p>
<p>Prosecuting barrister Ed Bailey told the court how the defendant was a tenant at a top floor flat and had been in a relationship with the victim, a 61-year-old Sri Lankan man, for five months after meeting him on the dating website Plenty of Fish.</p>
<p>Mr Bailey said: “Shortly after midnight on Christmas Eve police attended her address after an emergency call made by her son. Two PCs found the defendant, her son and the victim there with the defendant standing in the kitchen staring down the corridor looking dazed. Her face, hands and hair were covered in blood.</p>
<p>“The victim was lying on the sofa and had sustained serious wounds to his hands and head. He was drifting in and out of consciousness, drowsy and confused. The defendant initially resisted being cuffed and tried to struggle free before being tasered.</p>
<p>“An ambulance arrived and the victim was taken to the Royal Cornwall Hospital, on the way officers noting a clump of the defendant’s hair in one of his hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parsons told officers that the victim bit her and had tried to stab her himself before she wrestled the knife off of him and attacked him.</p>
<p>Parsons said that on December 23 she and the victim had gone to her son’s house nearby where they drank alcohol. It was at about 9pm when they returned home that they had started to argue over the volume of music on the television.</p>
<p>During the altercation Parsons stabbed the victim to the head, face and hands before he was able to call her son who arrived and disarmed her.</p>
<p>The victim suffered multiple lacerations and during her formal police interview Parsons said that her partner was also a heavy drinker and that he had put a knife to her face, bit her and pulled her hair “which hurt a lot”.</p>
<p>The court was told details of Parson’s previous offending whereby, in 2014, she was sentenced to 16 months in prison for stabbing her then husband, telling police he fell on the knife whilst cutting potatoes.</p>
<p>Then, in May 2016, she was sentenced to three and a half years in prison for unlawful wounding which took place at her flat in Tuckingmill.</p>
<p>Parsons stabbed another woman in a drunken argument, the victim waking to find her pouring bleach into her wounds.</p>
<p>Defending Parsons, Rupert Taylor said that her life has been “blighted with alcohol” and that she had been doing well after being released on licence before “falling off the wagon”.</p>
<p>He said: “Her family are very worried and in custody, where there is no alcohol she is very polite, respectful and keen to get home to see her grandchildren. She didn’t set out to do this, the victim was a drinker too and this was a dreadful end to a pleasant day.”</p>
<p>Sentencing Parsons, Judge Simon Carr said: “The circumstances are depressingly familiar, in particular regarding you. On the day in question you’d been drinking to excess with your partner, you were both alcoholics.</p>
<p>“A minor verbal argument about the volume of the music escalated and it would seem the complainant started the matter. What he did was pick up a knife and started stabbing you in a way intended to annoy you rather than harm you. More worryingly he hit you.</p>
<p>“There is no doubt you lost your temper and in the struggle that ensued you gained control of the knife and stabbed him a number of times. When taken by paramedics he had a clump of your hair in his hand.</p>
<p>“While there was provocation nothing could justify what you did and it is your previous convictions that make sentencing difficult. You were doing well with probation and had been released on licence.”</p>
<p>Judge Carr sentenced Parsons to 18 months in prison.</p>
<p>Husband and wife who abused their children</p>
<p>A husband and wife were jailed for a total of 39 years for the systematic sexual abuse of four of their children and one of their friends.</p>
<p>The pair sat together on February 25 in the dock at Truro Crown Court separated by dock officers and in front of a packed public gallery to learn their sentences in relation to a case that has sent shockwaves throughout Cornwall.</p>
<p>The defendants were during the wife’s trial described as “sexually deviant individuals with no moral compass who joined together to abuse these children”.</p>
<p>The victims in the disturbing case were the husband’s son and the wife’s three daughters, as well as a friend of one of the girls. The male victim was forced to have sex with his stepmother from the age of 11 and also abused by his biological father. The females were routinely groped and the youngest daughter encouraged to masturbate and shown how to use a vibrator by her own mother.</p>
<p>Last week, the female defendant in her fifties, who Cornwall Live will refer to as Mrs Y to protect the identity of the victims, was convicted by a jury of three indecent assaults on a male, three counts of sexual activity with a child, four offering to supply Class B drugs charges and engaging in a sexual act in the presence of a child. She admitted two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity mid-way through her trial.</p>
<p>Her husband, in his late 40s and who will be called Mr X, had already admitted six counts of sexual activity with a child, three sexual assaults on a female under 13, four assaults of a female child under 13, engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child, two sexual assaults by penetration, offering to supply class B drugs and the sexual assault of a male under 16.</p>
<p>Opening the case against both defendants, Heather Hope said that the matters came to light when Mr X’s son reported that he’d been sexually abused by his father and stepmother.</p>
<p>It was when he contacted Mrs Y’s daughters that they too disclosed abuse, sending their lives “into turmoil”.</p>
<p>Miss Hope detailed how the families came together in the early 2000s and that the male victim (Mr X’s son) recalls being groomed by being taken to nudist beaches and being made to feel being naked around two adults and touching each other was normal family behaviour.</p>
<p>Miss Hope said: “The victim would jump on the bed of his father and step mother and they would encourage him to get in, saying to him it was all perfectly normal and it was other families who weren’t normal.</p>
<p>“He was encouraged to touch Mrs Y’s body under the pretence of education. There came a situation when he was aroused and at the age of 11 she had sex with him and took his virginity.</p>
<p>“Mr X was in bed at the same time and his role was one of active encouragement for his own sexual gratification. The sexual intercourse became regular and the involvement of Mr X went from encouragement to participation.</p>
<p>“As the male victim got older he was introduced to drugs that were freely available in the family home. He was given cannabis and that led to him being provided with amphetamine, resulting in serious addiction later in life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Hope went onto detail how Mr X would often join in on the abuse, masturbating or performing oral sex on his own biological son.</p>
<p>Mr X also fondled the breasts of his wife’s daughter when she was about 12, then passing it off as a joke and again, normal family behaviour.</p>
<p>Another daughter was also touched in the same way and the youngest daughter was abused by Mr X when he sexually touched her as he put her to bed when she was aged under 10 years of age. He said she was his favourite.</p>
<p>Miss Hope said that the girl also suffered abuse at the hands of her mother who taught her to masturbate to help her sleep and showed her how to use a vibrator. The same victim also went into her mum and step dad’s room on one occasion and they began to have full sex in front of her. They hadn’t been engaging in sexual activity when she entered the room.”</p>
<p>The final part of the abuse outlined to the court by Miss Hope related to a friend of one of the daughters.</p>
<p>She knew the family well and called her friend, only for Mrs Y to answer.</p>
<p>Miss Hope said: “Mrs Y said her daughter was away but invited her over anyway. Both defendants drove over and picked her up and the suggestion was that that evening they’d watch a film.</p>
<p>“The film was on TV in the bedroom and they all sat on the bed watching the film. While watching it they (the defendants) smoked cannabis and Mr X offered some to her and she accepted.</p>
<p>“Halfway through the film Mrs Y fell asleep or passed out and Mr X started touching the girl’s leg. She didn’t know what to do and was scared because nobody knew where she was.</p>
<p>“She turned herself away however he continued kissing and biting the back of her neck. He put his arm around her and touched her breast and it was then she made her excuses and left the bedroom.</p>
<p>“She was so sick and dizzy from the cannabis she had to lie on the floor. The following morning the defendants told her she had to go home and as she got out of the car one of them, she couldn’t remember who, told her she probably shouldn’t speak about what happened.”</p>
<p>Miss Hope said the whole family had been torn apart from what took place and that none of Mrs Y’s daughters refer to her as their mother anymore.</p>
<p>Sentencing Mr X and Mrs Y, Judge Simon Carr described the case as “systemic sexual abuse of children in their care”.</p>
<p>Judge Carr said that the male victim was a quiet, pleasant and gentle young man who was groomed deliberately and encouraged to spend time around the house naked and get into bed with his parents.</p>
<p>Judge Carr said: “Adult pornography was put on the TV and you (the defendants) sat him down in front of it as if you were a family watching evening TV.</p>
<p>“He was supplied with drugs which were used to control and manipulate him. He said he didn’t really understand what was going on.”</p>
<p>Judge Carr added that he was first made to have sex with his stepmother aged 11 and the abuse lasted for three years.</p>
<p>“Mr X you were present during this which normalised what was going on and you watched him for your own sexual gratification before going on to abuse him yourself.”</p>
<p>The youngest daughter was said to have been taught touching and sexualised behaviour was normal, abuse that also went on for a number of years.</p>
<p>Judge Carr said: “Psychologically what has damaged her most was the abuse by her mother. She remembers you all on the bed and you two having full sex in front of her for your own sexual gratification. It has destroyed her ability to trust others.</p>
<p>“Regarding Mrs Y’s other daughters you (Mr X) took every chance you could to fondle their breasts and Mrs Y you did nothing to stop it.</p>
<p>“A friend of the girls had the misfortune of visiting and was given cannabis and abused by Mr X.</p>
<p>“The male victim had the strength to go to the police and he has contemplated suicide. Both physically and psychologically his life has been ruined and he was introduced to a drug addiction which blighted his life.</p>
<p>“When the youngest daughter heard he had gone to the police and was being called a liar by Mrs Y she knew she had to speak out. She couldn’t stand aside and let his claims be doubted. The distress caused to her was painfully clear when she talked about these events and the abuse has affected most aspects of her adult life.</p>
<p>“Mrs Y you have denied the offences throughout and showed no remorse or insight into the harm you’ve caused.”</p>
<p>Because of his guilty pleas Judge Carr sentenced Mr X to 18 years in prison, of which he must serve at least half and Mrs Y 21 years. They will both sign the sex offenders&rsquo; register for life.</p>
<p>Ryan Nettle</p>
<p>A fresh faced youngster landed a lengthy prison sentence after a judge refused to take kindly to his mini crime wave.</p>
<p>A week prior Cornwall Live reported how Ryan Nettle was told to expect a prison sentence after he pleaded guilty to a number offences which included the theft of three cars.</p>
<p>Nettle, aged 20 at the time, from Eglos Road in Shortlanesend appeared at Truro Crown Court on February 26 to be sentenced for the crimes he committed in Penzance when just a teenager.</p>
<p>The first charge to which he pleaded guilty to related to a burglary in St Francis Street in Penzance between June 30 and July 3 last year when he stole keys, tobacco and filters.</p>
<p>Nettle also held his hands up to the theft of a coat, a driving licence and a spare wheel, as well as a burglary at St Michael&rsquo;s Street in July last year when he stole a car and a set of house keys.</p>
<p>Around the same time period Nettle admitted he burgled a house in Gulval stealing a charity box, a Samsung phone and an Amazon fire.</p>
<p>The fourth and final burglary to which he pleaded guilty involved the theft of some car keys, a HP laptop, vodka and tobacco.</p>
<p>Nettle also entered guilty pleas to three counts of aggravated vehicle taking, stealing a Vauxhall motor vehicle to which he subsequently caused damage, an Audi A4 and a VW Golf.</p>
<p>Finally, Nettle pleaded guilty to being in possession of a quantity of diamorphine in May last year.</p>
<p>Addressing Nettle during his sentencing hearing, Judge Simon Carr sentenced him to three years in a young offenders’ institute. He will also be banned from driving for two years upon release.</p>
<p>March</p>
<p>Man who had sex with underage half-sister</p>
<p>A man who admitted having sex with his underage half-sister was tearful in court as he was sent to jail.</p>
<p>Truro Crown Court heard the pair have the same mother, who was often at home with her husband while they had sex in one of the bedrooms. The girl was aged under 16 at the time while the man was in his early 20s.</p>
<p>The court heard that over seven months in 2017 and 2018, the pair had sex on numerous occasions.</p>
<p>The girl involved cannot be identified by law which means Cornwall Live has been unable to identify the man, due to the nature of their family connection.</p>
<p>On the day of his trial, the man pleaded guilty to two charges of sexual activity with a family member and two counts of sexual touching, including sex and oral sex, with a child. He appeared at court to be sentenced on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Philip Lee said the man was living elsewhere in England but moved to Cornwall to his mother’s home when a relationship ended and he found himself homeless.</p>
<p>He said the girl’s mother was pleased at first that her daughter was getting to know her half-brother, but remained completely unaware they had begun having sex.</p>
<p>She only found out afterwards when safeguarding staff at a school contacted her to say her daughter had sent a text message to a friend talking about the relationship.</p>
<p>Mr Lee said she said in the message: “Me and this guy have been getting intimate. He treats me like I mean everything to him and other times he calls me a slag. We’ve been doing it since September. I feel like such a slut.”</p>
<p>He said the pair first had sex while they were watching a film in his bedroom. Mr Lee said: “She described she was scared and didn’t know how to react.”</p>
<p>He said she cried afterwards but the pair continued to have sex at various times over the next months.</p>
<p>In a diary, he said the girl wrote afterwards: “I don’t understand how I keep going back. I just felt he was the only one there for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another time, she wrote: “There were so many times I went to my room and cried because I felt it was my fault. I felt suffocated and sad because it was breaking me.”</p>
<p>He said the girl told police afterwards: “I think I realise it was really wrong and I was scared and didn’t know what to do so I told my friend and she helped and told the school.”</p>
<p>Mr Lee said the man was arrested and made no comment, but later went back to police of his own accord and made partial admissions. He told the officers that the girl had initiated the sex and threatened to accuse him of rape if he stopped.</p>
<p>However, Mr Lee said evidence showed the girl had suffered severe psychological and emotional trauma as a result of the abuse.</p>
<p>The judge, recorder John Trevaskis, said he acknowledged the man’s remorse and said the disparity in ages was not as significant as in other similar cases.</p>
<p>However he said the man had begun a relationship which was “wholly inappropriate”. He said: “I have read the documents in this case and they leave me in now doubt that the impact of these offences on her has been very significant.”</p>
<p>He said to the defendant: “You are still a young man of no previous convictions. You have a history of drug abuse and it’s possible the use of such drugs may have contributed to what you did. I recognise your past life has been difficult but that’s no excuse for what you did. It’s clear you need help to address your sexual behaviour and drug abuse.”</p>
<p>The man was sentenced to two terms of 52 months in prison, with another 32 months and 21 months in prison for the other offences, to run concurrently. It means that he will serve a total of four and half years in jail.</p>
<p>The man will also remain on the Sex Offenders’ Register for life and was made the subject of a Sexual Harm Prevention Order, with restrictions including contact with anyone aged under 16.</p>

<p>Jason Deacon (hospital order)</p>
<p>A paranoid schizophrenic who held a knife to the throat and stomach of a 76-year-old shop assistant whilst yelling homophobic abuse did so in the midst of a psychotic episode a court heard.</p>
<p>Jason Deacon walked into Lucille Ladner’s general store in Penzance, just across the road from his flat, on September 8 of last year and threatened Lucille Ladner with a kitchen knife, telling her he was going to kill her homosexual son.</p>
<p>Deacon had become convinced that he was under threat from the LGBT community, causing him to carry out the terrifying episode.</p>
<p>Deacon, 45, of Trevean Gardens, appeared at Truro Crown Court for sentence after admitting affray and carrying a bladed article.</p>
<p>Prosecuting the case, Joss Ticehurst, said that Ms Ladner and her son ran the convenience shop in Penzance and at around midday on September 8 Deacon entered the building.</p>
<p>He said: “The defendant walked in and was shouting ‘where’s that queer’, ‘I want to kill that queer’.</p>
<p>“He approached Ms Ladner and asked where her son was. Her son is openly gay.</p>
<p>“The defendant produced a six inch kitchen knife and placed it against the victim’s throat. She tried to lean back and avoid the tip of the knife but he moved closer.</p>
<p>“She says she was pleading with the defendant to calm down and it was then he placed the knife onto her stomach and said ‘it wouldn’t take much to go through’.</p>
<p>“The defendant demanded two bottles of beer which he was given and then left.”</p>
<p>During his police interview Deacon told officers his girlfriend was attacked by homosexual men and he was carrying the knife because he was scared.</p>
<p>Sentencing Deacon, Judge Simon Carr said he was under no illusions about the state of his mental health at the time of the offence.</p>
<p>Judge Carr said: “This was a truly terrifying event whereby you entered a small convenience shop run by a woman of 76 with a knife and went on to threaten her by placing the knife on her neck and chest. She thought she was going to die.</p>
<p>“You made threats of a homophobic nature against her son which were particularly unpleasant.</p>
<p>“I’ve had the benefit of two psychiatric reports that confirm your diagnosis as a paranoid schizophrenic. You are now 45 and were diagnosed in your mid 20s.</p>
<p>“I have no doubt you committed these offences whilst very ill and as a result of a paranoid delusion of which you have no control.</p>
<p>“You were paranoid about Christianity and the threats of the LBGT community and although the beliefs were delusional, they would have been very real to you. That doesn’t mitigate the victim’s terror however.</p>
<p>“I’m glad to see that as a result of your treatment your condition has improved but you still have some way to go.</p>
<p>“Despite two decades of diagnosis you have no real history of violence and I accept that this is an isolated incident. If you ever think about not taking your medication then think about the elderly woman in a store with a knife to her throat. You must take your medication for the rest of your life.”</p>

<p>Judge Carr made Deacon subject of a hospital order, whereby he must continue to be incarcerated and treated at a mental hospital until deemed fit by professionals to return to society.</p>
<p>Ms Ladner spoke to Cornwall Live shortly after the incident and revealed that she was back at her till by 4pm as she didn’t want to let anybody down.</p>
<p>Michael Parnell</p>
<p>A child rapist was sent back to prison after he was caught living in a house with a young girl with whom he had shared a bed.</p>
<p>Michael Parnell was sentenced to 16 years in prison back in 2006 for a catalogue of offences including seven counts of raping a girl under 13, raping a girl under 16, raping a woman over 16, indecent assault and attempted rape.</p>
<p>Parnell was released in 2016 but was back in the dock at Truro Crown Court on March 6 where he admitted breaching his release conditions.</p>
<p>Parnell, now 46, went to live with a girlfriend near Helston between November 23, 2018, and February 11 this year, failing to disclose to her his convictions. The pair were later joined by the woman&rsquo;s two children.</p>
<p>He admitted failing to comply with his notification requirements as a sex offender and breaching a sexual harm prevention order.</p>
<p>Prosecuting barrister Brian Fitzherbert told the court how Parnell was required to notify police of any change of address and also not allowed to stay at any address containing a child.</p>
<p>He was discovered at the address when police officers carried out a child welfare check. Parnell told officers that there weren’t any children present even though children’s toys and clothing could be spotted inside.</p>
<p>Mr Fitzherbert said: “Mr Parnell formed a relationship with the woman but she had no idea about his previous convictions.</p>
<p>“They met in October 2018 and began the relationship. He left his address and moved into her father’s home. They were they joined by her daughter and son.</p>
<p>“The defendant would sometimes sleep in a bed with his girlfriend and her daughter when the daughter couldn’t sleep. The daughter said she didn’t like Mike as he was always peeping at her while she was in her room.</p>
<p>“Sometimes the mum would go downstairs and leave them in the room together. On one occasion he offered her money for a favour but it was never made clear what the favour was.”</p>
<p>After being detected Parnell disappeared for a month before being found in a static caravan in early February.</p>
<p>As a result of the situation, the mother’s children were removed from her care.</p>
<p>Sentencing Parnell, Recorder John Trevaskis said that he was fully aware of his obligations as a sex offender and that he should have removed himself from the household as soon as the children arrived.</p>
<p>Recorder Trevaskis also addressed the consequences of the offending, reiterated that the woman’s children had been taken away from her as a result.</p>
<p>Parnell was jailed for two and a half years.</p>
<p>Lee Toms</p>
<p>A man who squandered a second chance from a court after an argument with his ex-girlfriend’s new partner was sent to prison.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old had been handed a deferred prison sentence in February, but Truro Crown Court heard the man approached the new partner just five days after the court hearing.</p>
<p>Although he denied using violence against the man, it meant he was in breach of the deferred sentence for even approaching the couple.</p>
<p>Lee Michael Toms, of Lower Lux Street, Liskeard, had previously pleaded guilty at the magistrates’ court to possessing a knife, a baseball bat, assault by beating using the bat, and causing harassment via text messages.</p>
<p>On February 12 at the crown court, Judge Robert Linford sentenced Toms to 15 months in prison but deferred the sentence pending certain conditions, to give him a second chance.</p>
<p>However, Toms found himself back in front of Judge Linford on March 8. He had admitted the breach but denied the new allegation of seeking revenge by using violence.</p>
<p>Judge Linford said to Toms: “I tried very hard to avoid having to pass on you a sentence of imprisonment for these series of serious offences. So what I did, in an effort to keep the peace between you and your ex-partner, was defer sentence on that with a number of conditions. I warned you that if you breached those conditions you would go to prison for 15 months.”</p>
<p>Accordingly, Toms was sent to jail for two periods of five months, four months and one month, for each of the offences, to run consecutively – a total of 15 months.</p>
<p>In light of these prison terms and given that any new possible sentence would run alongside them, the prosecution offered no evidence on the new allegation of taking revenge.</p>
<p>Daniel Casson</p>
<p>A homeless robber who brazenly dashed into a shop, barged staff out of the way and snatched £40,000 of jewellery was jailed.</p>
<p>The 37-year-old raided the Little Jems jewellery shop in Penzance town centre during the day on August 14 last year.</p>
<p>Daniel Michael Casson, of no fixed address, appeared at Truro Crown Court on March 8 for sentence, after he had previously pleaded guilty to robbery and theft.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Philip Lee said it was 11am when Casson burst into the Little Jems shop in Market Jew Street. Working there at the time were two women, shop owner Jamie Wright and assistant Catherine Kleskey.</p>
<p>He said Casson jumped over the counter and started grabbing jewellery on a display. When Ms Kleskey went to stop him, he pushed her away, causing her to fall against the wall where she suffered a graze and bruising.</p>
<p>Mr Lee added that the two women fled and tried to lock Casson in the shop. He overpowered them and ran off through the town centre with £40,000 of stock.</p>
<p>He said CCTV later revealed Casson had stolen a camping mat from Millets shortly before, but had discarded it in Bread Street.</p>
<p>He said both women had been shaken in the incident and Mrs Wright was now nervous and afraid in the shop. Ms Kleskey was so traumatised that she quit her job after a retail career of 36 years.</p>
<p>The court heard Casson had previous convictions for robbery and blackmail and had served time in prison.</p>
<p>Judge Robert Linford said to Casson: “The effect on the shop owner and the shop assistant are well set out in the victim personal impact statements. The shop owner is now on guard and nervous in their own business. Ms Kleskey has suffered significantly as a consequence of your behaviour. You terrified her out of her wits and her work.”</p>
<p>He added that he acknowledged Casson’s mental state at the time and the fact that he had helped police recover some of the stolen items.</p>
<p>Casson was jailed for three years and four months.</p>
<p>Stephen Tree</p>
<p>A tattoo artist repeatedly punched his girlfriend in the face while telling her that she was “going to die tonight”.</p>
<p>Stephen Tree, 31, launched the ferocious attack in the early hours of New Year’s Day after he and his partner had argued after going out for a meal.</p>
<p>Physically imposing and heavily tattooed Tree, of Roselyon Crescent in St Blazey, appeared at Truro Crown Court on March 13, where he entered guilty pleas to charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and making threats to kill.</p>
<p>Prosecution barrister Jason Beal told the court how the complainant and the defendant had been in a relationship for about five months leading up to the incident but had separated briefly after Tree put his hands around her throat.</p>
<p>He described how they got back together and arranged to go for a meal on New Year’s Eve but had begun arguing over trivial matters when they arrived home.</p>
<p>Mr Beal said: “The complainant thought she’d deflect the defendant’s increasing anger by going to bed.</p>
<p>“He followed her upstairs and tried to provoke her by filming her. He told her he’d had sex with another woman while they’d been separated and then lunged at her in a way she describes as him ‘going crazy’.</p>
<p>“While holding her he repeatedly punched her in the face and then grabbed and squeezed her throat. He told her she was going to die tonight and that she should apologise to him.</p>
<p>“He continued to apply pressure to her throat but she managed to escape his grip but he caught her again and continued the struggle. She was so scared that she urinated and defecated herself.</p>
<p>“She tried to get downstairs and out of the front door but fell down and landed awkwardly on her leg. The complainant then crawled onto the driveway looking for help.”</p>
<p>Mr Beal added that Tree then left the scene, saying he was going to kill himself, before returning and being arrested by police.</p>
<p>The victim spent a total of seven days in hospital receiving treatment for a fractured cheek, a broken heel and extreme bruising, swelling and cuts to her face.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the victim’s injuries will take three years to completely heal and she is currently unable to drive or work. She describes in her victim impact statement feeling nervous and vulnerable and having to move back in with her mother.</p>
<p>Sentencing Tree, Judge Simon Carr said: “You had been in a relationship for about five months. It had ceased as a result of your violence but resumed.</p>
<p>“On New Year’s Eve you’d been drinking heavily and some form of verbal dispute started and continued when you returned home.</p>
<p>“The victim tried to disuse the situation by going up to bed but you wouldn’t let it rest. You followed her and launched a sustained and brutal assault.</p>
<p>“You punched her to the face repeatedly and grabbed her throat and applied pressure, telling her she was going to die.</p>
<p>“She staggered down onto the stairs where you attacked her again. She suffered very serious injuries including a broken heel and those who have suffered such an injury know only how painful and uncomfortable it is.</p>
<p>“She is so frightened by what happened that she can no longer face living in a house that she is entitled to call home.”</p>
<p>Judge Carr sentenced Tree to seven years behind bars and an indefinite restraining order.</p>
<p>The victim sat in court visibly distressed throughout. She arrived on crutches and wearing a protective boot.</p>
<p>Jason Roberts and Jordan Vandersluys</p>
<p>(Image: Devon and Cornwall Police)</p>
<p>Two men were jailed for a spate of burglaries worth around £40,000 at houses and building sites across west Cornwall.</p>
<p>The pair in a van targeted homes in Truro, Carbis Bay, Hayle, Praze-en-Beeble, Redruth and Mawnan Smith – they even broke into the sites of Helston Community College and Tregenna Castle Hotel in St Ives.</p>
<p>Truro Crown Court heard they left people fearful and deeply upset at the loss of sentimental items as well as caused numerous tradesmen lost work after their tools were taken.</p>
<p>The pair were eventually caught after neighbours saw torches at night and tipped off police during a burglary. A hunt by a police dog revealed the two men hiding in a hedge in nearby fields.</p>
<p>Appearing at court on Friday were Jason Mark Roberts, 39, of Gunnards House, Back Lane West, Redruth, and Jordan Daniel Vandersluys, 24, of Rosscommon, Green Lane, Redruth. They pleaded guilty to several charges of burglary or domestic and non-domestic properties and handling stolen goods.</p>
<p>Philip Lee, prosecuting, said the charges represented a wider set off burglaries in late November and early December of last year. He said upwards of £40,000 worth of items were stolen at night although police had found around £20,000 of the missing items. Most of these were stashed in a shed at Vandersluys’ house while the remainder were found in Roberts’ van.</p>
<p>Mr Lee police examined the men’s computers and found they had often searched for the prices of items stolen when they returned from a burglary.</p>
<p>The offences included the theft of £2,000 of tools from houses under construction at Tehidy, near Redruth. He said the pair sent each other text messages beforehand, one of which from Roberts said: “You want to go to Tolvaddon or Tehidy? Stay local. I’ll drive.”</p>
<p>On another occasion, £10,000 of items were stolen late at night from a house in Falmouth Road, Truro, including jewellery and antiques. That night, Mr Lee said one of the men sent a text message to his girlfriend which said: “Justin Truro waiting for a few lights to go off. Then going to load up. Love you loads.”</p>
<p>In early December, Mr Lee added, the pair stole a paint sprayer worth £2,500 from a chalet under construction in the grounds of the Tregenna Castle Hotel in St Ives. It was later found in Vandersluys’ shed.</p>
<p>Just days later, the pair stole heavy tools worth £2,200 from a padlocked container on the grounds of Helston Community College, where a new school building is currently under construction.</p>
<p>Then on December 4, the court heard the pair entered a second home in Hayle, stealing a TV, surfboards and an oil painting worth £5,200, and they forced entry into another home where they took a 15-year-old’s Xbox games’ console.</p>
<p>They also targeted a building under construction in Praze-an-Beeble, near Camborne, and Vandersluys admitted additional burglaries from two houses in Carbis Bay.</p>
<p>Mr Lee said their crime spree came to an end when neighbours saw torches at night at a property at Mawnan Smith, near Falmouth. The neighbours called the police and a hunt using a police dog revealed the two men hiding in a hedge in nearby fields.</p>
<p>Judge Carr said he accepted the men had demonstrated a degree of remorse.</p>
<p>Each man was jailed for a total of four years.</p>
<p>Rachelle Hands</p>
<p>Motorists watched in horror as a drug addict swerved across a busy road, crashing head-on into a car coming the other way and causing catastrophic injuries.</p>
<p>A court heard the woman driver was 11 times over the legal drug-drive limit.</p>
<p>She had already narrowly avoided two other collisions before smashing into the front of a car at Callington.</p>
<p>Rachelle Hands, 35, at the time of no fixed address and now living in Bath Street, Plymouth, appeared at Truro Crown Court.</p>
<p>She pleaded guilty to a single charge of dangerous driving causing serious injury.</p>
<p>Philip Lee, prosecuting, said the crash happened back on September 1, 2017. He said Hands had been driving a green Vauxhall Lupo on the A388 from Launceston towards Callington.</p>
<p>It was around 5pm, he said, when Hands veered across the central reservation on a straight stretch of road – straight into the path of a Renault Clio coming the other way.</p>
<p>He said the Clio driver had no time to brake and suffered injuries to his back and ankle. His wife in the passenger seat suffered broken ribs while a 28-year-old woman in the rear of the Clio, who was not wearing a seat belt, was flung violently forward, breaking both her legs in several places.</p>
<p>Mr Lee said tests taken nearly six hours later revealed Hands had 560 micrograms of a chemical from broken down cocaine in her blood. The legal limit for driving under the influence of drugs is 50 micrograms.</p>
<p>“Her erratic driving shows there was some effect on her ability to drive,” he added.</p>
<p>He said the woman seriously injured was still in pain and receiving physiotherapy for her broken legs.</p>
<p>Judge Simon Carr said the matter was too serious and only an immediate custodial sentence would suffice. He also pointed to how Hands had been stopped by police while under the influence of drugs, some 15 months after the car crash.</p>
<p>Hands was jailed for 15 months and banned from driving for two years on her release.</p>
<p>Ross Gormal</p>
<p>A man labelled by a judge as a “dangerous and violent thug” was jailed for two and a half years after punching his girlfriend so hard he fractured her eye socket.</p>
<p>Ross Gormal, 35, from Ranelagh Road in St Austell, appeared at Truro Crown Court for sentencing on March 22 after being convicted by a jury in December of one count of inflicting grievous bodily harm on the woman in January 2017.</p>
<p>The court heard that Gormal and the now 29-year-old woman met on a dating site in 2016, before starting a relationship.</p>
<p>Their volatile relationship was on/off and characterised by frequent arguments. They lived at different addresses but Gormal would go to visit her flat in St Blazey, where she lived with her two children.</p>
<p>Ed Bailey, for the prosecution, told the court that on the night of the incident in January 2017, Gormal and the victim were playing cards and drinking together in her home, before a heated argument ensued in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Gormal grabbed the victim by the hair and then punched her. The punch landed squarely on her left eye, with the impact causing her to fall to the floor.</p>
<p>Gormal walked out of the front door while the victim “crawled” to her bedroom, where she was violently sick.</p>
<p>The next morning she staggered to the home of a neighbour, who she had never met before, in an attempt to get help.</p>
<p>The victim was taken to hospital, and an x-ray revealed she had fractured her eye socket, requiring surgery.</p>
<p>She said she was also left with black eyes and lips, and cauliflower ears.</p>
<p>In a victim impact statement, she said: “After it happened I stayed with my mum. I was too frightened to go out in the first few months in case I bumped into him or any of his friends. I had no social life and cut myself off.</p>
<p>“My confidence went out of the window. For six months I had double vision, I couldn’t see properly and spent most of the time with one eye shut, so I was able to focus.</p>
<p>“Two years after the incident, I can honestly say I haven’t got over it. It’s broken my heart.</p>
<p>“When I sat in court and heard what was said I felt sick at the incident, which has changed me as a person. I have terrible trust issues and these have moved into new relationships. Thankfully my new partner is brilliant and very patient with me. I’m not the same person, and my mum worries about me all the time.</p>
<p>“It has crushed me and changed me, and left me feeling sad and broken.”</p>
<p>Gormal has 12 previous convictions for 19 offences, seven of which relate to violence.</p>
<p>Sentencing Gormal to two and a half years in prison, Judge Robert Linford said: “You have an appalling record for using violence.</p>
<p>“Your supervision report makes encouraging reading, but it was prepared before your conviction for this offence. The full report concludes that you are a danger to members of the public.</p>
<p>“You yourself declared yourself as ‘risky’ when under the influence.</p>
<p>“This offence was committed two years ago, your conviction however in the meantime [in May 2018 for threatening violence] shows that you are not the changed man that you report to be, but the same violent thug you have been for a long time.</p>
<p>“I conclude that you do indeed pose a significant risk [to people]. In short you are a dangerous individual, partly when you are drunk or challenged by partners or others unfortunate enough to encounter you in that state.”</p>
<p>Gormal must also engage in an intensive alcohol treatment programme, aimed at eliminating his use of violence.</p>
<p>A restraining order was also imposed, banning Gormal from contacting the victim directly or indirectly or visiting her home for ten years.</p>
<p>Thomas Curd and Abigail Leatherland</p>
<p>A judge remarked with great sadness that the potential of 22-month-old Eve Leatherland will never be fulfilled after her mother and her partner were sentenced for their roles in her death.</p>
<p>On Friday March 29 at Truro Crown Court Thomas Curd, 31, from Watford and Abigail Leatherland, 26, formerly of Liskeard, were sent to prison a day after they were convicted by a jury.</p>
<p>Curd was found to have murdered Eve and her mother Leatherland convicted of causing or allowing a child to die.</p>
<p>Eve died in October 2017 after she was poisoned with codeine by Curd. Prior to her death she was subjected to at least three ferocious beatings by Curd in which he fractured her ribs and skull as well as lacerating her liver.</p>
<p>Some of the injuries were then repeated, resulting in identical fractures that halted the healing process.</p>
<p>During the trial Leatherland claimed that she was unaware that Curd was hurting her child and put her apparently condition down to a viral infection.</p>
<p>The jury ruled that although Leatherland didn’t cause any of the injuries or administer the codeine, she must have been at least partially aware of what was going on.</p>
<p>Both Curd and Leatherland failed to seek medical help for Eve and by the time 999 was called, Eve was already dead.</p>
<p>Justice May&rsquo;s sentencing remarks in full</p>
<p>Thomas Curd, you have been found guilty after a trial of the murder of Eve Leatherland, a young child aged 22 Months on 5 October 2017.</p>
<p>Abigail Leatherland, You were Eve’s mother. You have been found guilty after a trial of the offence of causing or allowing the death of a child.</p>
<p>Facts</p>
<p>At 12.44pm on Thursday 5 October 2017 an ambulance was called to a house at 2 Castle St Liskeard.</p>
<p>A young child, Eve Leatherland, just 22 months old, had been found unresponsive lying in her bed.</p>
<p>The ambulance was there in 90seconds and efforts immediately started to resuscitate her.</p>
<p>Paramedics were concerned, however, that something was amiss, the child seemed to have been dead for some time, there were signs of rigor mortis. Nevertheless she was rushed by air ambulance to Derriford as efforts to save her continued. But it was to no avail and she was certified dead shortly after arrival.</p>
<p>At hospital the nurses started to have concerns about the appearance of the child and the behaviour of the parents. There were bruises to the child’s body and blood in one of her eyes.</p>
<p>However it was not until a skeletal survey of the body was carried out, and thereafter a post-mortem, that the full extent of the injuries were discovered: Eve had a total of 12 fractures and -refractures of her ribs, her skull had been fractured and re-fractured and some blunt force trauma to her tummy had pushed her liver and other internal organs of her abdomen against her spine, lacerating her liver, her right adrenal gland, tearing her mesentery and causing a number of haemorrhages to her bowel.</p>

<p>There were a large number of bruise

<h3 id="demi-lovato-says-shes-been-through-a-lot-in-first-interview-in-over-a-year">&ldquo;Demi Lovato says she&rsquo;s &lsquo;been through a lot&rsquo; in first interview in over a year&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/11/demi-lovato.jpg" alt="img">
Demi Lovato opened up about her struggles with eating disorders and self-esteem in her first interview in over a year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s been a very introspective year for me. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot, been through a lot,&rdquo; Lovato, 27, said at the Teen Vogue Summit in Los Angeles over the weekend. The &ldquo;Confident&rdquo; singer confessed that she&rsquo;s still struggling at times to accept her body, an idea she said was much different from the concept of body positivity.</p>
<p>HACKERS POST DEMI LOVATO&rsquo;S ALLEGED NUDE PHOTOS ON HER OWN SNAPCHAT</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hear the term body positivity all the time. To be honest, I don&rsquo;t always feel positive about my body,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I do not like what I see. I don&rsquo;t sit there and dwell on it. I also don&rsquo;t lie to myself,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I used to look in the mirror if I was having a bad body image day and say &lsquo;I love my body, you&rsquo;re beautifully and wonderfully made.&rsquo; But I didn&rsquo;t believe it. I don&rsquo;t have to lie to myself and tell myself I have an amazing body. All I have to say is &lsquo;I&rsquo;m healthy.&rsquo; In that statement, I express gratitude. I am grateful for my strength and things I can do with my body. I am saying I&rsquo;m healthy and I accept the way my body is today without changing anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEMI LOVATO FACES &lsquo;BIGGEST FEAR,&rsquo; POSTS BIKINI SNAP SHOWING OFF CELLULITE</p>
<p>Lovato, who has been open about her struggles with bulimia, says she took the entire month of October off from the gym because she realized her relationship with exercise wasn&rsquo;t healthy.</p>
<p>DEMI LOVATO ROCKS BIKINI AMID &lsquo;BACHELORETTE&rsquo; STAR MIKE JOHNSON DATING RUMORS</p>
<p>&ldquo;For so many years I dealt with an eating disorder. What I wasn&rsquo;t ever open with myself about was, whenever I was in the gym I was doing it to an unhealthy extreme,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s what led me down a darker path — I was still engaging in these behaviors. Embracing my body as it is naturally is why I took the month of October off the gym.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEMI LOVATO PROMISES TO TELL HER &lsquo;SIDE OF THE STORY&rsquo; WITH FIRST ALBUM SINCE OVERDOSE</p>
<p>The former Disney star, who&rsquo;s a blue belt in jiu-jitsu, explained, &ldquo;What I see in the mirror [is] someone that&rsquo;s overcome a lot. I&rsquo;ve been through a lot and I genuinely see a fighter. I don&rsquo;t see a championship winner, but I see a fighter and someone who is going to continue to fight no matter what is thrown their way. I have a lot of confidence now because I have said the things I believe in. I know I can hold my own on a first date with someone, in a conversation with someone. That&rsquo;s what I see when I look in the mirror — a strong woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DEMI LOVATO SHARES &lsquo;EMPOWERING&rsquo; BIKINI PHOTO: &lsquo;I FEEL CONFIDENT&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lovato overcame a near-fatal drug overdose in July 2018, and while the world was largely supportive of the star, not everyone was so kind. Her battles with bipolar disorder, self-harm and other issues occasionally have made her a target for cruel online trolls and cyberbullying, and it hurt her, she said.</p>
<p>DEMI LOVATO APOLOGIZES AFTER ISRAEL TRIP</p>
<p>&ldquo;What people don&rsquo;t realize is I&rsquo;m an extremely sensitive person. When someone says something mean about me or makes a meme making fun of me, I have a good sense of humor. But when it&rsquo;s a very serious subject it can be hurtful,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Even if you have an account thats like &lsquo;ImaDemiFan,&rsquo; that&rsquo;s the name, and you leave one comment that said &lsquo;You look like Lord Farquaad with that hair,&rsquo; I&rsquo;m like, &lsquo;Damn, that kind of sucks.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m so tired of pretending I&rsquo;m not human. When you say stuff, it affects me. I try not to look, but I see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a result, Lovato said she actively has been trying to put less stock into social media and more into loving her own life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over the past five years I&rsquo;ve learned life is not worth living unless you&rsquo;re living for yourself. If you&rsquo;re trying to be someone you&rsquo;re not, or you&rsquo;re trying to please other people, it&rsquo;s not going to work out in the long run. If you want to dye your hair purple, dye your hair purple,&rdquo; she said. If you want to love someone of the same sex, love someone of the same sex. Be yourself and don&rsquo;t be afraid of what people think.&rdquo;

<p><img src="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/07/Ireland-Baldwin.jpg" alt="img">
Ireland Baldwin took to Instagram on Thursday to show off a series of ballet poses as well as her many tattoos.</p>
<p>On Monday, the daughter of Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger posted three images of herself in a red camisole leotard where she was standing in front of a large mirror and showing off some minor dance poses as well as a massive stack of books.</p>
<p>“dance more, read more,” she captioned the snaps.</p>
<p>ALEC BALDWIN&rsquo;S DAUGHTER IRELAND&rsquo;S NSFW PHOTO SPARKS RESPONSES FROM DAD, UNCLE</p>
<p>In the first image, she poses with her left leg bent and jetting out at the knee and her right arm balancing her. The tattoos that nearly cover her arm are only somewhat visible thanks to the pose. In the second snap, the 24-year-old model is kneeling on the floor giving her fans both a look at her profile and the stack of more than a dozen books position by her mirror. In the background, on a nearby dresser, more books can be seen stacked high.</p>
<p>In the third image, Baldwin poses with her legs in a similar position to the first, but this time makes a point of showing off her tattoos by draping her arm across her stomach and lifting up the left side of her leotard to show off the red flower she has drawn on her hip.</p>
<p>IRELAND BALDWIN STRIPS DOWN TO LINGERIE: &lsquo;THIS IS WHO I AM&rsquo;</p>
<p>The model often posts images showing off her body, sometimes to the dismay of her famous father. In August, eagle-eyed fans noticed her dad and uncle commenting that a nearly nude photo she shared on her Instagram made them uncomfortable. However, she explained that showing off her body isn’t typically what upsets her dad on social media.</p>
<p>“The photos I get yelled at by my dad are the ones where I am drunk-eating at night at 2 a.m. at IHOP,&rdquo; she explained to Us Weekly at the time. &ldquo;I posted this video, like, drinking maple syrup, and he was like, ‘You have to take that down! No one’s going to take you seriously.’</p>

<h3 id="what-happened-to-the-formerly-fearsome-right-wing-media-troll">&ldquo;What happened to the formerly fearsome right-wing media troll?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FZSpK9TV_HqmXsNL5aqN3GSz7DI=/0x0:3200x1675/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19137197/1154154922.jpg.jpg" alt="img">
In the aftermath of the 2016 election, a new cast of political characters popped up on the national media’s radar: right-wing provocateurs who had built previously ignored followings on the internet and who seemed suddenly relevant as establishment journalists and politicians tried to understand Donald Trump’s surprising victory.</p>
<p>Hence the serious attention people started paying to characters like Mike Cernovich, Milo Yiannopoulos, and others, who reveled in the attention and could plausibly claim that their influence extended to millions of online fans as well as the newly elected leader of the free world.</p>
<p>Cut to 2019, and the media focus has moved on: Some of these figures are still tweeting and stirring stuff up, but they don’t seem to have nearly the clout they appeared to have a couple years ago.</p>
<p>What happened? A few things, says CNN media reporter Oliver Darcy, who specializes in tracking conservative media:</p>
<p>The platforms that gave many of the trolls a home, namely Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, have become less welcoming, particularly to those who advocate harassment and worse; in some cases, like that of Yiannopoulos, they have kicked them off their service entirely. And despite promises to create new platforms that would challenge the big tech companies, trolls who have been “de-platformed” have found it hard to reconstitute their followings in new locations.</p>
<p>The media has belatedly focused its attention on the direct and powerful link between Fox News and the White House, and now realizes that what that channel’s stars say to Trump — both on- and off-air — has enormous impact on his thinking, policies, and actions. There’s no equivalent to Tucker Carlson or Fox and Friends that’s mainly on Twitter.</p>
<p>News outlets like things that are new. The right-wing troll isn’t a new idea anymore, so it’s going to get less attention. And attention helps feed the trolls.</p>
<p>Darcy and I talked about these trolls’ apparent diminishment on this week’s episode of Recode Media. You can read an excerpt of that conversation below.</p>
<p>Peter Kafka</p>
<p>I do want to talk to you about the conservative media landscape. When we first started talking about this a couple years ago, a lot of attention was focused on the Mike Cernovichs of the world and Milo Yiannopoulos. A lot of emphasis was placed on these trolls and how they were feeding a general conservative news movement. [You] don’t hear much talk about them now. Even last year, when you [and reporter Charlie Warzel] came out to talk about this, they had sort of receded from the conversation. Cernovich is still on Twitter [but] Milo has been de-platformed. What accounts for the seeming diminished influence of individual trolls like that?</p>
<p>Oliver Darcy</p>
<p>Well, I think part of their influence is always tethered to how much media coverage they’re receiving, and back in 2016, they were the shiny new object.</p>
<p>Peter Kafka</p>
<p>Yep. The New Yorker profiled Cernovich.</p>
<p>Oliver Darcy</p>
<p>And Trump had just shocked everyone by winning the election. And so, people were trying to figure out, how did this happen? And obviously, this was a key component of this, so they received a lot of coverage, and in turn, I think, gave some of these people an added sense of influence. We saw the same thing with Breitbart, where people were covering Breitbart, and Breitbart had a lot of its power and influence tethered to the ability to jump into a cable news chyron because of something they posted.</p>
<p>Peter Kafka</p>
<p>And also, they were directly connected to Steve Bannon and Steve Bannon was in the White House.</p>
<p>Oliver Darcy</p>
<p>Right. Not to diminish those things either, but I think a good chunk of their influence was tethered to how much media attention or media coverage they could drive. And I think after a while, you know, they’re not really new. We kind of know their game, we know what they do. And so, those stories about the Mike Cernovichs of the world have considerably decreased, as have the stories about how things end up in Trump’s Twitter feed, because at this point, we know that it’s either he saw it on Fox and Friends, and Fox and Friends saw it from some right-wing website, and that right-wing website picked it up, probably, from some message board.</p>
<p>Peter Kafka</p>
<p>A lot of that mystery has been solved.</p>
<p>Oliver Darcy</p>
<p>And so, I’m not sure what value a lot of these stories would add in this.</p>
<p>Peter Kafka</p>
<p>In some cases &hellip; we’re focused on the 8chans of the world, the swamp where it comes from. We don’t care about the individual who created it so much, we care about the ecosystem that allowed it to bubble up.</p>
<p>Oliver Darcy</p>
<p>And I think, at this point, too, we’re also focused maybe on Fox, because Fox has gotten considerably more pro-Trump in the past four years. And they have a larger microphone and more influence on this president than anything else. So, when the Cernovichs are interesting because a lot of the things they say end up on Fox, I think Fox is really becoming more of the main story.</p>
<p>Peter Kafka</p>
<p>We know that it’s possible Trump is scrolling through his Twitter and maybe hitting a random retweet. We definitely know that he is spending hours watching TV.</p>
<p>Oliver Darcy</p>
<p>Sure. And Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity and all these guys.</p>
<p>Peter Kafka</p>
<p>He’s both watching them and they have direct pipelines &hellip;</p>
<p>Oliver Darcy</p>
<p>They’ve been talking to him.</p>
<p>Peter Kafka</p>
<p>Right. We know where all that is coming from. How much has Twitter, Facebook, Google’s efforts to rein in their platforms — which they say is non-ideological and conservatives argue otherwise — how much have those efforts diminished the reach of a Cernovich? Milo’s been kicked off a lot of the platforms already.</p>
<p>Oliver Darcy</p>
<p>You have to divide it up. I think, for instance, Alex Jones is no longer on any of these platforms. Someone like Laura Loomer has also been taken off most of these platforms. Milo has been taken off most of these platforms. So, there has been some efforts by these tech companies to actually buckle down on people who break their rules.</p>
<p>Peter Kafka</p>
<p>I’ve heard — and I think you’re saying this now — that [those efforts] really have been effective in diminishing those specific individuals’ reach and influence.</p>
<p>Oliver Darcy</p>
<p>The only time I ever hear about Milo these days is when people talk about how de-platforming him actually reduces reach. And there’s always the talk of, well, if you take them off this platform, they’ll just move somewhere else. We haven’t really seen that happen in a big way yet. Sure, some of them do eventually move to a platform like Telegram or Discord or whatever it may be. But we haven’t seen it happen in a way that would really [matter]. You know, [Yiannopoulos] had millions of followers on the main social platforms, now he’s probably reduced to a few thousand.</p>
<hr>
<p>Darcy is someone who’s very much worth listening to when it comes to figuring out the right-wing media. That’s because in addition to being a sharp reporter, he has the advantage of coming out of right-wing media. Darcy was active in the college conservative movement and then translated that interest in politics into a job writing for Glenn Beck’s The Blaze before moving on to Business Insider and now CNN. That gives him real insight into the way that world works and plenty of contacts inside it. You can hear our entire conversation here and follow him on Twitter at @oliverdarcy.</p>
