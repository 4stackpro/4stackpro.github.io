The Takeaway: This feels right.</p>
<p>Oil Prices Tank</p>
<p>What Happened: Good news for anyone looking to become an artisanal oil baron: It’ll probably never be cheaper than it is right now, as oil prices plunge to literally less than zero. The bad news? Well, that&rsquo;s bad news.</p>
<p>What Really Happened: As is obvious by simply looking outside your window—which is all anyone can really do right now, and even that will just show some empty streets—everyone is living in a changed world these days. One of the more obvious, and perhaps surprising, signs of that change arrived last week when this happened to the price of oil.</p>
<p>Yes, oil prices went negative for the first time in history. That seems kind of important, right?</p>
<p>Oh. So, yeah. It’s pretty important. But, and this is admittedly a bit of a stretch for what is a massive problem for a global economy that has now cemented that data is more valuable than oil, what if this is &hellip; actually a good thing?</p>
<p>OK, so it’s not actually a good thing, even if you know that you thought roughly the same thing for just a couple of seconds at least. (Also—spoiler alert—the idea that unrefined crude will go bad quickly is not actually true.) Yet the news did bring about a surreal moment where people realized how much the world has changed from just a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>If all of this is freaking you out a little, don’t worry—President Trump is on it.</p>
<p>Yes, the federal government can’t provide for its struggling citizens and is, apparently happy to let states go bankrupt because they paid for coronavirus responses and won’t be reimbursed, but a bailout package for oil companies? Of course!</p>
<p>There’s only one thing for it: Everyone needs to buy oil while it’s worthless, then set themselves up as oil companies and get a piece of this action. You know it’s the smart option.

<h3 id="watching-stanley-tucci-mix-up-a-delicious-cocktail-will-soothe-your-nerves">Watching Stanley Tucci mix up a delicious cocktail will soothe your nerves</h3>
<p><img src="https://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2020_17/1561316/stanley-tucci-today-main-200421_ac68f9159d9c18b39626686ac32572e9.social_share_1200x630_center.jpg" alt="img">
If you want the soothing effect of a boozy cocktail without having to actually drink one, this video of Stanley Tucci deftly mixing one up should hit the spot.</p>
<p>The actor has had people taking a minute to calm their nerves during the coronavirus pandemic by following along as he shows how to make his go-to &ldquo;quarantini&rdquo; (actually a Negroni) in an Instagram video.</p>
<p>The video starts with a request for a drink from his wife, Felicity Blunt, who is the older sister of his &ldquo;The Devil Wears Prada&rdquo; castmate Emily Blunt.</p>
<p>Trending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha</p>
<p>Looking debonair at home while the rest of us are in sweatpants, Tucci lets us know he likes his Negronis shaken — not stirred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And use your hands because it&rsquo;s the most hygienic way of getting ice into the shaker,&rdquo; he joked.</p>
<p>He then adds a double shot of gin, some sweet vermouth and a shot of Campari. One hypnotic shake from Tucci later, and it&rsquo;s almost ready.</p>
<p>All you need is a slice of orange, which Tucci deadpans come &ldquo;pre-sliced&rdquo; in his house. &ldquo;They come from Florida this way, it&rsquo;s incredible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blunt then beckons for the drink from behind the camera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would never happen,&rdquo; he says before taking a big sip.</p>
<p>Tucci&rsquo;s mixology skills and soothing, cool-dad vibe seem to be just what people need right now, including Captain America himself, actor Chris Evans.</p>
<p>I. Love. Stanley. Tucci.</p>
<p>On some(most) days after we finished filming on the first Captain America movie, Stanley would make us martinis in his trailer.</p>
<p>He’s an absolute gem. However cool, fun, witty, and charming you think he is, double it and you’re halfway there. https://t.co/mEJzuV8oAH — Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) April 21, 2020</p>
<p>women only want one thing and its stanley tucci patiently making a cocktail and explaining each step as he does so — Tilly Steele (@TillySteele) April 21, 2020</p>
<p>Nothing — and I mean nothing — has soothed me in the last six weeks quite like the way Stanley Tucci making a “Negroni” on Instagram has. 🍸 pic.twitter.com/LzlbE3iJWL — Mark McDevitt (@MarkTMcDevitt) April 21, 2020</p>
<p>Celebrities from Oprah Winfrey to Ina Garten have been whipping up their own &ldquo;quarantinis&rdquo; in recent weeks, but Tucci may have topped them all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Negroni shall henceforth be known as the QuaranTucci,&rdquo; one Instagram commenter wrote.

<h3 id="stanley-tucci-showed-james-corden-how-to-make-a-martini-after-the-success-of-his-negroni-tutorial">Stanley Tucci showed James Corden how to make a martini after the success of his negroni tutorial</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.insider.com/5ea2b6bce61f344a4d5ab437?width=1200&amp;format=jpeg" alt="img">
Stanley Tucci gave James Corden a lesson in how to make a martini following the success of his negroni masterclass.</p>
<p>This was Corden&rsquo;s first-ever martini, and Tucci coached him through making one, including instructions on measurements and techniques.</p>
<p>Tucci stirred a half-shot of vermouth with ice in a shaker before straining the vermouth away, then stirred in two shots of vodka and let the mixture sit for a minute. He then strained the mixture into a martini glass and rubbed a lemon rind around the edge.</p>
<p>Tucci told Corden that he makes a cocktail every day at five o&rsquo;clock, and Corden told Tucci that he is &ldquo;the best-dressed man in isolation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Visit Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>Stanley Tucci taught James Corden how to make a martini following the success of his negroni masterclass. Before they got started on The Late Late Show, Corden noted that &ldquo;Stanley Tucci might be the best-dressed man in isolation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you&rsquo;re dressed now,&rdquo; Corden told Tucci. &ldquo;That, to me, is making an effort. And this is just how you&rsquo;re dressed when you&rsquo;re quarantined within your own house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always feel like one should look good, particularly after five o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; Tucci replied before telling Corden that it would be his honour to teach him how to make a martini, particularly as Corden has never had a martini before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to shake it, we&rsquo;re actually going to stir it. The opposite of what James Bond likes,&rdquo; Tucci advised before putting ice into a shaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vermouth, you can measure it, you can not measure it, whatever you want,&rdquo; Tucci said. &ldquo;Some people like a lot of vermouth, some people don&rsquo;t like a lot of vermouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tucci poured in half a shot of vermouth and then stirred it with the ice, which Corden joked was turning him on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So now the vermouth has infused the ice. Ideally, we&rsquo;d do this for a little bit longer but it&rsquo;s television,&rdquo; Tucci said. &ldquo;Strain, get rid of this vermouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tucci then strained the vermouth and took out his vodka, which was, of course, in a classy decanter rather than a branded bottle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll a do shot. Really, like, two shots, big shots,&rdquo; Tucci said, which he followed by stirring the vodka and vermouth-infused ice. &ldquo;Are you stirring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yeah, I&rsquo;m stirring in a big way,&rdquo; Corden joked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife is filming this and she&rsquo;s watching you and me, which I think has always been her dream,&rdquo; Tucci joked back as wife Felicity Blunt, sister of Emily Blunt, laughed.</p>
<p>Tucci then let the mixture sit for a minute, and in the interim told Corden that he makes a cocktail at five o&rsquo;clock every night. The mixture was then stirred once more, and strained into the martini glass.</p>
<p>Finally, Tucci took a slice of lemon rind and rubbed it around the edge of the glass before dropping it into the drink itself. Tucci and Corden then toasted each other before trying out their respective creations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s good. Oh, it&rsquo;s glorious,&rdquo; Corden. &ldquo;This is the start of a real thing for me. Bless you, Stanley Tucci, keeping the world together one drink at a time.&rdquo;</p>
