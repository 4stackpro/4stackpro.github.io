Bill Gates has hailed recent initiatives developed to adapt to the “new normal” imposed by the coronavirus crisis, such as teleworking and virtual software innovations, with emotional intelligence consultant Justin Bariso arguing that a platform launched by the Greek National Tourism Organization is one such “brilliant” response to the challenges of the crisis indicated by the US tech mogul.</p>
<p>“The tourism industry is definitely one of the hardest hit by the pandemic. But maybe you can learn from ‘Greece from Home,’ a brilliant initiative by the Greek National Tourism Organization, in cooperation with Google,” Justin Bariso wrote in Inc magazine following an interview by LinkedIn Editor-in-Chief Daniel Roth with Gates on world responses to the pandemic and the economic and social recovery that needs to come after.</p>
<p>The “Greece from Home” platform was launched at the start of April by the GNTO and Marketing Greece, with the support of Google, and is aimed at reinforcing the country’s positive image during the Covid-19 pandemic by helping people around the world stay in touch with Greek culture and be inspired by the country’s attractions.</p>
<p>The initiative is also aimed at tourism professionals, helping them enhance their digital skills with the help of Google via the “Grow Greek Tourism Online” seminars, which are organized with the support of the Greek Ministry of Tourism. More than 1,000 people signed up to participate in the group seminars in the first 10 days of their launch.</p>
<p>“This site is also built on the principle of content marketing: using great online content to create a relationship with potential customers. Through YouTube videos and other content, creators give viewers a chance to tour archeological sites and museums, experience beautiful scenes of nature, and even take ‘walking’ tours or visit restaurants – all virtually, of course,” said Bariso of the initiative.</p>
<p>“Greece from Home” further leverages YouTube, with videos featuring popular figures including tennis ace Stefanos Tsitsipas and NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo.</p>
<p>“Done right, your content might be able to bring in revenue through ads or product sales. And at the very least, it’s a way to keep in touch with your audience until they are willing (and able) to travel again,” he added.</p>
<p>Greek media had earlier attributed the quotes to Gates as part of his interview with LinkedIn.

<h3 id="greece-invites-the-world-to-visitfrom-home-video">Greece invites the world to visit…from home (VIDEO)</h3>
<p><img src="https://greekcitytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/greecefromhome_1-thumb-large.jpg" alt="img">
Greece is sending out a message to the world: to stay home – due to the current developments involving the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic – but at the same time to stay in touch through technology.</p>
<p>The Greek Tourism Ministry on Thursday announced the launch of the new online platform Greece From Home that looks to promote the country’s image to people all over the world and invites them to visit – not by traveling physically, but virtually – straight from the comfort and safety of their homes.</p>
<p>An initiative created jointly by the Greek Tourism Ministry, the Greek National Tourism Organization (GNTO) and Marketing Greece, Greece From Home has three goals:</p>
<p>To help people from all over the world stay in touch with the country and its culture</p>
<p>For people (future travellers) to discover destinations and be inspired by the country’s beauties</p>
<p>For tourism professionals to brush up on their digital skills</p>
<p>According to Greek Tourism Minister Harry Theoharis, the Greece From Home platform is part of the government’s overall strategic response to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“In addition to taking measures to protect public health, shield and restart the economy and rebuild Greek society, the government is also taking steps to strengthen and manage the image of our country as a tourism destination,” the minister said on Thursday during a web press conference he held to introduce the platform to the media.</p>
<p>The minister also highlighted the cooperation between the public and private sector for the initiative.</p>
<p>“It is particularly important that, in these difficult times, the public and private sectors work together to support Greek tourism, while also cooperating to prepare for the next day,” Minister Theoharis said.</p>
<p>The design of the Greece From Home platform was done by the Chief Creative Officer of the Greek Government, Steve Vranakis, and his creative teams Ithaca Lab and Prinz &amp; Co, in collaboration with the Tourism Ministry, GNTO, Marketing Greece and Google.</p>
<p>Referring to the Covid-19 pandemic as one of the most difficult moments “we are going through in terms of what is happening to our industry right now”, Vranakis said that Greece From Home follows the Greek #menoumespiti concept.</p>
<p>“We want to send a message about all the things we can do from home,” he said.</p>
<p>The platform is aimed towards a dual audience – international and Greeks.</p>
<p>“Greece From Home is for prospective visitors alongside Greeks, so there is content that will allow people to stay connected internationally. It is very important for people to still have Greece on the top of their minds and under their consideration whilst no one is traveling psychically, but they are still thinking about it,” Vranakis added.</p>
<p>The platform has three main sections: Watch – Visit – Learn</p>
<p>Watch</p>
<p>In this section, people are encouraged and inspired to stay home and stay connected to Greece’s culture through the GNTO’s Visit Greece channel on YouTube. The channel offers new and select content by Greek artists from around the world and includes Greek music, gastronomy, theatre, dance, sports, fashion as well as videos with destinations and experiences from all over Greece.</p>
<p>“Greek tourism makes its presence felt during this unprecedented crisis. As long as our guests stay home, we as a brand and destination are close to them, from our home, through Greece From Home… Through the campaign our primary goal is to send a message of support to those currently experiencing it, but it is also a strategic action to support Greek tourism while preparing for the next day,” GNTO Secretary General Dimitris Fragakis said.</p>
<p>Visit</p>
<p>The aim in this section is for everyone to be able to “visit” Greece from their home. Marketing Greece’s discovergreece.com has created a digital portal with rich content and exciting digital experiences. Virtual travellers can visit Greece’s archaeological sites museums, villages and traditions; “taste” the country’s gastronomy; and “experience” nature excursions… all from the safety of their homes.</p>
<p>“We are living shocking times right now and what we all have to do is unite our forces. Today, more than ever, Greece and Greek tourism need to send their message of hope and optimism as far as possible, that these days will end and we will all be together again. Until then, we invite the international traveling community to dream from the safety of their home when they ‘visit’ our country and ‘experience’ the Greek summer,” Marketing Greece CEO Ioanna Dretta said.</p>
<p>Learn</p>
<p>Aiming to support tourism businesses and their staff and offer them tools to upgrade their digital skills, the Greece From Home initiative has partnered with Google’s Grow Greek Tourism Online to offer a series of new home-based daily online group seminars. The seminars are offered free of charge and cover a variety of topics, from how to create a digital marketing plan for a tourism business, to how professionals can work remotely, and more. Upon completion of the seminars, participants will receive a certificate of attendance from Google, the Tourism Ministry and IAB Europe. For more information on the seminars (in Greek), press here.</p>
<p>“Our goal is for the tourism industry to be empowered with digital tools and skills to manage the challenges of the day, but also to grow together for an even better tomorrow,” Google Southeastern Europe CEO Peggy Antonakou said.</p>

<h3 id="greece-from-home-discover-countrys-beauty-and-culture-from-afar">Greece from Home: Discover Country’s Beauty and Culture From Afar</h3>
<p><img src="https://greece.greekreporter.com/files/milos-1.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<p>Greece’s Tourism Ministry on Thursday presented the new platform “Greece from Home,” a product developed through the joint cooperation of the National Greek Tourism Organization, Marketing Greece and Google.</p>
<p>The new platform will give its web visitors the opportunity to discover the beauties of Greece and to “travel” to its cities and towns, to keep in touch with Greek culture – without leaving home.</p>
<p>“Greece stays home but doesn’t stay home,” Tourism Minister Haris Theoharis said at the unveiling of the new program.</p>
<p>“In addition to measures to protect public health, shield and restart the economy and rebuild Greek society, the government is also taking steps to strengthen the image of our country as a tourist destination in the framework of its overall strategic response to the COVID-19 pandemic”, Theocharis stated.</p>
<p>The Tourism Minister also said that that it is particularly important that in these difficult times the public and private sectors cooperate together and work hard in order to prepare for the future.</p>
<p>Asked when he believes that the Greek tourism industry will return to normalcy, Theocharis stressed that no one can predict when this will happen.</p>
<p>This position is reinforced by the fact that no one knows exactly what the near future will bring in the countries which form the bulk of the tourism market for Greece, including Germany, France, Italy, the Americas, etc.</p>
