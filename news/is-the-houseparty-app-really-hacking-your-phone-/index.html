Houseparty, along with Zoom, is one of the video-calling services that has exploded in popularity since the Covid-19 outbreak. The app, which allows you to video chat while also playing online games with people you&rsquo;re speaking to, has become a household name – particularly among young people – over the last several weeks, with a reported two million downloads last week alone. But over the last 24 hours, Houseparty has become the centre of a viral misinformation claim. The company believe the smears are targeted, and they&rsquo;re offering $1m to whoever can find out who&rsquo;s behind them.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a handful of unsubstantiated claims about Houseparty started to spread on Twitter, with users saying that there had been attempted “hacks” on other apps after they downloaded Houseparty. The rumour seems to have originated from one tweet, which has since been deleted, in which the user claimed that the Houseparty app tried to log into her Spotify account.</p>
<p>About an hour later, as the claim started gaining traction, another viral tweet came from user Megan Cassidy urging that people delete the app, saying it was hacking into other applications and online banking. Although the original tweet is now hidden behind a locked account, both tweets were screenshotted and shared on Snapchat, TikTok and Instagram Stories as a warning to others, with further text even suggesting links to Russia.</p>
<p>Houseparty was quick to deny these claims, posting on their official Twitter account this evening that “All Houseparty accounts are safe – the service is secure, has never been compromised, and doesn’t collect passwords for other sites.” It also seems unlikely that an app owned by Epic Games, a gaming company worth over $15bn now most famous for owning global gaming phenomenon Fortnite, would try to gain information by unsuccessfully logging into teenagers’ Spotify accounts.</p>
<p>Speaking to Forbes, security expert Lukas Stefanko also said that Houseparty was relatively safe compared to many apps, and that the only real risk to privacy was the fact that any user you add on the app can immediately start video chatting you if you are logged on unless you change your settings.</p>
<p>All Houseparty accounts are safe – the service is secure, has never been compromised, and doesn’t collect passwords for other sites. — Houseparty (@houseparty) March 30, 2020</p>
<p>Until early this morning, the Houseparty hack story seemed like nothing more than an uneducated hunch going viral: the first prominent case of Gen-Z misinformation chainmail or under-25 WhatsApp forwards. But this morning, Houseparty tweeted: “We are investigating indications that the recent hacking rumours were spread by a paid commercial smear campaign to harm Houseparty. We are offering a $1,000,000 bounty for the first individual to provide proof of such a campaign to <a href="mailto:bounty@houseparty.com">bounty@houseparty.com</a>.”</p>

We are offering a $1,000,000 bounty for the first individual to provide proof of such a campaign to <a href="mailto:bounty@houseparty.com">bounty@houseparty.com</a>. — Houseparty (@houseparty) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>The New Statesman has reached out to Houseparty to ask for further information – neither they nor Epic Games have elaborated on why they believe this is a bigger conspiracy than some teens making a false correlation. Regardless, this story is likely just at its beginning and others like it will inevitably pop up as more people spend the majority of their time online. But, much like all misinformation, the damage to Houseparty&rsquo;s reputation may already be done.

<h3 id="is-houseparty-safe-hacking-fears-and-apps-creepy-porn-bombing-trend-revealed">Is Houseparty safe? Hacking fears and app’s creepy ‘porn-bombing’ trend revealed</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/PARTY-e1585591980827.png?strip=all&amp;quality=100&amp;w=1200&amp;h=800&amp;crop=1" alt="img">
AS millions around the world self-isolate during the coronavirus pandemic, the Houseparty app has soared to immense popularity.</p>
<p>This genius video calling app lets you chat with pals, play games and more – but is it safe and can it be hacked?</p>
<p>The Houseparty app lets you hang out with pals in a virtual environment Credit: House Party</p>
<p>Is Houseparty safe?</p>
<p>On the whole, Houseparty appears to be largely safe to use.</p>
<p>The app has seen pranksters hopping into calls to cause havoc – but there are ways to get around this.</p>
<p>And the app does also ask for a large amount of information, which may worry the privacy-conscious.</p>
<p>However, with the right settings, you can have a great time on Houseparty.</p>
<p>Exactly how safe is the popular app? Credit: House Party</p>
<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s always worth remembering that no app or service is ever truly safe.</p>
<p>Even tech titans like Facebook can suffer hacks or leaks, so always be vigilant with your information online.</p>
<p>Houseparty hack rumours</p>
<p>In late March 2020, rumours began circulating that suggesting a major Houseparty hack.</p>
<p>Users flooded to Twitter reporting other accounts – like Spotify or PayPal – had been hijacked after downloading Houseparty.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear if Houseparty is linked to these breaches, but the app&rsquo;s creators denied that a breach had taken place.</p>
<p>Houseparty is owned and operated by Epic Games, the major US firm behind hit games Fortnite and Gears of War.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We’ve found no evidence to suggest a link between Houseparty and the compromises of other unrelated accounts,&rdquo; an Epic Games spokesperson told The Sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a general rule, we suggest all users choose strong passwords when creating online accounts on any platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use a unique password for each account, and use a password generator or password manager to keep track of passwords, rather than using passwords that are short and simple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A spokesperson later told The Sun that the Houseparty hack claims may be part of a major hoax.</p>
<p>Houseparty claims it hasn&rsquo;t been hacked, but has been targeted by a smear campaign Credit: Houseparty</p>
<p>The second statement read: &ldquo;Our investigation found that many of the original tweets spreading this claim have been deleted and we&rsquo;ve noticed Twitter accounts suspended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a disheartening situation for a service like ours that’s bringing people much needed face-to-face social connections and empathy at a critical time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sun understands that Twitter has been unable to find evidence of a coordinated campaign at this time.</p>
<p>Houseparty said that it was &ldquo;investigating indications that the recent hacking rumors were spread by a paid commercial smear campaign&rdquo;</p>
<p>It added: &ldquo;We are offering a $1,000,000 bounty for the first individual to provide proof of such a campaign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uploading all of your contacts</p>
<p>One of the big red flags for true privacy die-hards is the networking system.</p>
<p>When you sign up, you&rsquo;re asked to hand over your entire list of contacts – which will be stored on Houseparty servers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you choose to import your personal contacts from your mobile device we will access your personal contacts in order to identify Users that you may know that are using the Services and to provide other Users with suggestions for potential Connections based on mutual contacts,&rdquo; Houseparty&rsquo;s privacy policy explains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Note, however, that we will never share your phone number or the phone numbers of third parties in your Contacts with anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a shady tactic: it simply lets the app connect you with pals.</p>
<p>But in a world where hacks and leaks are rife, handing over contact info for everyone you know won&rsquo;t sit well with everyone.</p>
<p>The good news is that it&rsquo;s possible to entirely avoid handing over your contacts to Houseparty.</p>
<p>Just press Skip when prompted, and your contacts won&rsquo;t be uploaded.</p>
<p>The app still works fine without contacts, and you can add friends, join and host calls, play games and everything else you&rsquo;d normally do.</p>
<p>You can get Houseparty on a range of devices Credit: House Party</p>
<p>Strangers &lsquo;porn-bombing&rsquo; your calls</p>
<p>Porn-bombing isn&rsquo;t a problem specific to Houseparty – but it certainly exists.</p>
<p>Just like on Zoom, it&rsquo;s relatively easy to find and access another person&rsquo;s group call.</p>
<p>This has led to twisted pranksters hopping into video calls to show off pornographic content – or their own naked form.</p>
<p>As such, it&rsquo;s important to keep your room &ldquo;locked&rdquo; if you can help it.</p>
<p>And try to avoid adding anyone you don&rsquo;t know as a friend.</p>
<p>Unlocked rooms</p>
<p>Basically anyone can enter one of your video chats – unless you make it private.</p>
<p>The obvious answer to many of Houseparty&rsquo;s problems is simply to &ldquo;lock&rdquo; your rooms entirely.</p>
<p>You can do this by hitting the padlock button when you&rsquo;re in the app.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still possible to invite people to the call – but that&rsquo;s the only way for someone to join.</p>
<p>This has a downside: pals can&rsquo;t just hop into your room when they like if it&rsquo;s locked.</p>
<p>That does remove the &ldquo;house party&rdquo; vibe somewhat, but it&rsquo;s a small price to pay to avoid having a stranger wave his todger at you over the internet.</p>

<h3 id="rebekah-vardy-jokingly-named-as-prime-suspect-in-houseparty-hack-after-wagatha-christie">Rebekah Vardy jokingly &lsquo;named as prime suspect&rsquo; in Houseparty hack after WAGatha Christie</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20654708.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/3_Loose-Women-TV-show-London-UK-06-Feb-2019.jpg" alt="img">
Rebekah Vardy has been the subject of a joke trend on Twitter after bosses at Houseparty offered a $1 million reward for the person responsible for the hacking &ldquo;smear campaign&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Thousands of users joked Jamie Vardy&rsquo;s wife, 38, must be responsible and put her forward as the prime suspect following her WAGatha Christie war with Coleen Rooney last year.</p>
<p>The video call app has seen a surge in popularity in recent weeks after Brits were told to stay at home amid the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>However, the company was hit by rumours their system had been hacked with users&rsquo; personal details being leaked.</p>
<p>Bosses at the firm have now insisted the story is not true - and launched a manhunt for whoever was responsible.</p>
<p>(Image: PA)</p>
<p>They tweeted: &ldquo;We are investigating indications that the recent hacking rumors were spread by a paid commercial smear campaign to harm Houseparty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are offering a $1,000,000 bounty for the first individual to provide proof of such a campaign to <a href="mailto:bounty@houseparty.com">bounty@houseparty.com</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bored Brits couldn&rsquo;t resist putting forward a prime suspect - with thousands tweeting in reply &ldquo;it was&hellip; Rebekah Vardy&rsquo;s account&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The tweets are a reference to the WAGatha Christie scandal that erupted between Jamie Vardy&rsquo;s wife and fellow WAG Coleen Rooney.</p>
<p>(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock)</p>
<p>Coleen launched an investigation of her own last year after discovering someone close to her had been leaking stories from her private Instagram account.</p>
<p>The war of the WAGs started when Coleen accused Jamie Vardy&rsquo;s wife of selling stories about her private life to the press in an explosive Instagram post - something she strongly denied.</p>
<p>After suspecting Jamie Vardy&rsquo;s wife, Coleen, who is married to Wayne Rooney, says she leaked a series of fake stories that only Rebekah&rsquo;s account could see on Instagram to test whether or not they&rsquo;d make it into the papers.</p>
<p>When they did, she revealed her detective work - that saw her nicknamed WAGatha Christie - in an epic statement that went viral on social media.</p>
<p>Coleen explained: &ldquo;To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except one account (those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven’t had stories on there for a while.)</p>
<p>(Image: Daily Mirror)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did!&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I know for certain which account / individual it’s come from. I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ended her statement with the bombshell: &ldquo;It’s&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; Rebekah Vardy’s account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rebekah strongly denied being responsible for the leaks, and insisted there were plenty of other people with access to her own Instagram account.
