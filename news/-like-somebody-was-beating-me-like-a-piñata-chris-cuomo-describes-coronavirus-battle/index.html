Cuomo also said he had a series of hallucinations, including a vision of his late father, former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who died in 2015.</p>
<p>“I was up all night. I’m telling you, I was hallucinating,” he said. “My dad was talking to me. I was seeing people from college. People I haven’t seen in forever. It was freaky, what I lived through last night.”</p>
<p>Despite his condition, Cuomo has continued hosting his hourlong weeknight news program on CNN, “Cuomo Prime Time,” from his basement, offering a rare window into the effects of the illness rampaging across the country.</p>
<p>More than 217,000 Americans had contracted Covid-19 — the disease caused by the novel coronavirus — as of Thursday afternoon, and at least 5,151 have died as a result of the disease. Because of limited testing capacity, experts agree the actual number of positive cases is much greater.</p>
<p>But apart from written accounts produced by patients or media outlets, the physical toll of the coronavirus has remained at least somewhat elusive to many Americans, as footage from overwhelmed hospitals is limited.</p>
<p>Cuomo’s brother, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, is coordinating his state’s response as the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S. and has begun discussing his younger sibling’s condition during his daily news conferences.</p>
<p>Although data suggests Chris’ case will likely self-resolve, his diagnosis still “frightened me,” Andrew told reporters on Wednesday, lamenting that “I couldn’t protect my own brother” and “he couldn’t protect himself.”</p>
<p>“I’m worried about my brother, as everyone is worried about everyone in their family and everybody they love,” Andrew said. “I take solace in the numbers and the facts because you can’t divorce yourself from the facts. Otherwise, you go to a place of irrationality. But we’re emotional beings.”</p>
<p>On Wednesday night, Chris appeared to receive a phone call from Andrew in the middle of an interview with CNN chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta, but sent the governor to voicemail. The brothers have gained popularity on social media in recent days for their on-air banter and gentle ribbing.</p>
<p>“Sorry, that’s Andrew,” Chris said, silencing his phone. “I’ll talk to him later. Pest.”</p>
<p>On Thursday, Chris appeared via livestream during Andrew’s news conference to update his brother on his health and reveal another hallucination he had on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>“It was like out of a movie, I will tell you. I had hallucinations I was seeing Pop,” Chris said. “You came to me in a dream. You had on a very interesting ballet outfit, and you were dancing in the dream, and you were waving a wand and saying, ‘I wish I could wave my wand and make this go away.’ And then you spun around, and you danced away.”</p>
<p>Andrew remarked of Chris that “you look good, you sound good,” and said he would refrain from teasing him given the seriousness of Chris’ condition. “You know, rule one is never hit a brother when he’s down, and you’re literally in the basement,” he said.</p>
<p>The governor went on to thank his brother for performing what he called a “great public service, in an ironic way” and “answering questions for millions of Americans.”</p>
<p>“You living it, showing it, doing it, doing the show, reporting on how you feel, reporting on what you’re doing, I think it really takes — it demystifies this,” Andrew said. “It takes a lot of the unknown out of the equation.”</p>
<p>Chris said that going forward, “I won’t do the show all the time,” but only host “whenever I can,” acknowledging: “I know that I have to take care of myself.”</p>
<p>“People have been very nice in saying, ‘Don’t work too much because you don’t want to compromise fighting the virus,’” he said. “They are right. You are right to say that, as well, and I hear all the advice.”</p>
<p>Rep. Ben McAdams (D-Utah), another high-profile Covid-19 patient, also recounted his battle with the disease on Thursday morning, telling NBC’s “Today” show that he was finally “virus-free” after being hospitalized.</p>
<p>“I found myself in the hospital for eight days and just had trouble breathing, couldn’t keep my oxygen levels up, and it hit me really, really hard. And so it’s good to be back on my feet right now,” he said.</p>
<p>McAdams, who became one of the first members of Congress to test positive two weeks ago, added that his sickness “was quite an ordeal” and said that while he is “probably not quite 100 percent” well, he is “doing so much better right now.”

<h3 id="chris-cuomo-says-coronavirus-made-him-hallucinate-my-dad-was-talking-to-me">Chris Cuomo says coronavirus made him hallucinate: ‘My dad was talking to me!’</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.syracuse.com/resizer/c8NiPDFWLpUnHLp8p0ezxmeywrs=/1280x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-advancelocal.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RPKEUXVFOVHM5JS6YIRQ33LVEA.jpg" alt="img">
CNN anchor Chris Cuomo described his coronavirus symptoms on television Wednesday after testing positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>The younger brother of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo continued to host his show, “Cuomo Prime Time,” from home Wednesday night, telling Dr. Sanjay Gupta that he had a fever, trouble breathing, and shivered so hard that he broke a tooth. Chris Cuomo also said that he hallucinated his late father, former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, spoke to him.</p>
<p>“I want you to be thinking about everybody who’s not as lucky as I am. Who are dealing with the same that I am in 10 times worse. Especially after what I learned last night,” Chris Cuomo said. “This virus came at me, I’ve never seen anything like it. Okay? So yeah I’ve had a fever, you’ve had a fever, but 102, 103, 103 plus, that wouldn’t quit, and it was like somebody was beating me like a piñata, and I was shivering so much that, Sanjay’s right, I chipped my tooth. These are not cheap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was up all night, I’m telling you I was hallucinating, my dad was talking to me! I was seeing people from college, people I haven’t seen forever. It was freaky what I lived through last night. And it may happen again tonight. Doctor says it may happen like 5, 8 times.”</p>
<p>Cuomo added that he now understands “why we’re losing so many people and why are hospitals are so crowded,” and urged viewers to do more.</p>
<p>“So here’s the message: don’t be me, but more importantly be better than we’re being right now. Care enough not just to stay home but to stay on our leaders, to make sure that they’re doing everything they can to limit this,&rdquo; the CNN host said. &ldquo;I’m telling you this is the part of our lives we will live through and remember the most. How do you want to be remembered during this time?”</p>
<p>Dr. Gupta encouraged Cuomo to take time off from work until he’s feeling better.</p>
<p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo said earlier Wednesday that his brother is an example of how “anyone” can get COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.</p>
<p>“There is no superhero who is immune to this disease,” the governor said. “Anyone can get it. No one can be protected from it. I couldn’t protect my own brother&hellip; It frightened me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cuomo also said it was “gutsy, courageous” of his younger brother to continue his TV show and demonstrate what a battle with coronavirus looks like.</p>
<p>“And that information can be helpful to people,” Gov. Cuomo continued. &ldquo;That’s why he did the show last night: ‘OK, I have coronavirus but here I am, I’m doing my show. I didn’t fall over, I didn’t collapse, it’s not a death sentence.’ Kudos to him. My pop would be proud. I love you, little brother.”</p>
<p>Nearly 1 million cases of coronavirus have been confirmed worldwide, including over 216,000 in the U.S. New York state has seen 84,046 cases of COVID-19 as of Thursday morning, and nearly 2,000 deaths.</p>

<h3 id="covid-19-positive-chris-cuomo-talks-about-chipping-his-tooth-and-hallucinating-during-freaky-night">COVID-19 positive, Chris Cuomo talks about chipping his tooth and hallucinating during &lsquo;freaky&rsquo; night</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/03/31/USAT/4cd24c6c-8a6f-4d6d-854e-88ffaea69551-AP_People_Chris_Cuomo.JPG?crop=2624,1476,x0,y185&amp;width=2624&amp;height=1476&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" alt="img">
CNN news anchor Chris Cuomo got real with his audience Wednesday about dealing with the coronavirus during his show &ldquo;Cuomo Prime Time.&rdquo; Cuomo said that he not only chipped a tooth but also hallucinated and saw his late father, former New York governor Mario Cuomo, during a &ldquo;freaky&rdquo; first night after his diagnosis.</p>
<p>The 49-year-old brother of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced in a tweet Tuesday that he tested positive for COVID-19 after being exposed to people who are infected. But by showtime it was back to business for Cuomo, who broadcasted his CNN show &ldquo;Cuomo Prime Time&rdquo; from his basement Tuesday and Wednesday via webcam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This virus came at me, I’ve never seen anything like it,&rdquo; Cuomo said Wednesday, adding that he had a fever of more than 103 &ldquo;that would not quit. And it was like somebody was beating me like a piñata.&rdquo; He was shivering so much that he chipped a tooth –- &ldquo;These are not cheap, OK?&rdquo; he cracked, pointing at his chompers – and was up all night and hallucinating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dad was talking to me, I was seeing people from college, people I hadn’t seen in forever,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was freaky what I lived through last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coronavirus:Gov. Andrew Cuomo gives emotional update on brother Chris&rsquo; coronavirus: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m worried&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cuomo closed his show with a message: &ldquo;Don’t be me. But more importantly, be better than we’re being right now. Care enough not just to stay home but to stay on your leaders, to make sure they’re doing everything they can to limit this. I’m telling you, this is the part of our lives we will live through and remember the most. How do you want to be remembered during this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the broadcast Tuesday, Cuomo also pleaded with Americans to continue practicing social distancing to flatten the curve and debunked a common myth held by many who think they are immune to the virus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me be proof. We have real vulnerability,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not too strong. Do not act that way. But show that vulnerability by what you do for yourself and for others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was later joined on air by CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re going through this,&rdquo; Gupta told him. &ldquo;Really. I really feel for you. It&rsquo;s not good; it&rsquo;s a serious thing and you&rsquo;re a tough guy, but I know it really makes people feel miserable. So I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re going through this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gupta also stressed the importance of exercising caution when it comes to experimenting with trial medications that haven&rsquo;t been proven to fight coronavirus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last thing we want to do to anybody, Chris, yourself included, is cause some sort of harm. That&rsquo;s why you do trials,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wish it worked. I wish we could say it worked and we knew it for sure and then I would say &lsquo;my pal Chris can take this and it can help him reduce the severity and the duration of this virus.&rsquo; But I can&rsquo;t say that for sure&hellip; There&rsquo;s gonna be (a medication that will help), we just don&rsquo;t know what it is yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the top of the hour, Cuomo handed off to Don Lemon, who tried to cheer up his CNN colleague with some playful banter. &ldquo;Did you get my gift? … I sent you a six-pack of Corona (beer),&rdquo; Lemon quipped.</p>
<p>But Lemon hit a more serious note later on &ldquo;CNN Tonight&rdquo; when he had to cut to commercial break after tearing up over Cuomo&rsquo;s well-being.</p>
<p>On Twitter early Tuesday, Cuomo revealed about his diagnosis: &ldquo;Sooooo in these difficult times that seem to get more difficult and complicated by the day, I just found out that I am positive for coronavirus. I have been exposed to people in recent days who have subsequently tested positive and I had fever, chills and shortness of breath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just hope I didn&rsquo;t give it to the kids and Cristina. That would make me feel worse than this illness! I am quarantined in my basement (which actually makes the rest of the family seem pleased!). I will do my shows from here,&rdquo; he continued.</p>
<p>Cuomo concluded on a positive note: &ldquo;We will all beat this by being smart and tough and united!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking of his brother, Gov. Cuomo said in a press conference Tuesday Chris Cuomo &ldquo;is going to be fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even for essential workers, people have to be careful. Again, I&rsquo;ve been trying to communicate that everyone – everyone – is subject to this virus,&rdquo; the governor said. &ldquo;This virus is the great equalizer. My brother, Chris, is positive for coronavirus. Found out this morning. Now, he is going to be fine. He&rsquo;s young, in good shape, strong – not as strong as he thinks – he will be fine. But there&rsquo;s a lesson in this. He&rsquo;s an essential worker, a member of the press, so he&rsquo;s been out there. If you go out there, the chance that you&rsquo;ll get infected is very high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just worried about his daughter and his kids and he hopes he didn&rsquo;t get them infected,&rdquo; the governor said. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really know Chris – you see Chris on his show at night … but you just see one dimension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see a person in his job. And in his job, he&rsquo;s combative and he&rsquo;s argumentative and he&rsquo;s pushing people. But that&rsquo;s his job. That&rsquo;s not who he is,&rdquo; the governor continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a really sweet, beautiful guy. And he&rsquo;s my best friend. My father was always working, so it was always just me and Chris,&rdquo; the governor said, adding his brother joked to him this morning that &ldquo;even the dogs won’t come downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The governor added that two weeks ago the brothers disagreed over Chris Cuomo having their mother over at his home: &ldquo;Love needs be a little smarter than reactive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Gov. Cuomo gave an emotional update about his brother during his coronavirus briefing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no superhero who is immune to this disease,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Anyone can get it. No one can be protected from it. I couldn&rsquo;t protect my own brother &hellip; And with all he knows and as smart as he is, he couldn&rsquo;t protect himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chris Cuomo was most recently at CNN&rsquo;s offices in the Hudson Yards neighborhood of New York City last Friday, CNN confirmed Tuesday.</p>
<p>USA TODAY has reached out to reps for Cuomo for comment.
