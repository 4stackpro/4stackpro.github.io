Videoconferencing technology can help researchers to conduct oral exams remotely.Credit: Getty</p>
<p>In November 2019, I conducted my PhD defence using the videoconferencing software Zoom.</p>
<p>I had to do this remotely, because after handing in my thesis on digestive physiology at the University of California, Irvine (UCI), I moved to the other end of California. There, I started a new job as a postdoctoral researcher at the Bodega Marine Laboratory (BML), part of the University of California, Davis.</p>
<p>I was in a conference room in my new institution in Bodega Bay, California. My principal investigator and one other member of the thesis-review committee watched the defence from UCI, along with a small group of students and faculty members. One of the committee members was also watching remotely, while on sabbatical in the United Kingdom. I shared the video link publicly, and my friends and family were able to watch from other parts of California and from Pennsylvania, Colorado and Florida. Even my husband and new baby tuned in from our home.</p>
<p>My defence comprised a slide presentation lasting around 45 minutes, followed by public questions. Then we closed the meeting to everyone except myself and my committee members for private questions.</p>
<p>Coronavirus latest: global infections cross half-million mark</p>
<p>I wrote this article to help graduate students and their principal investigators navigate remote defences, something that might become more common as we all adjust to the current coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>Many other issues need to be negotiated if you are defending your thesis remotely — I’ve listed the challenges and questions I faced below. I can’t promise that all this advice will be appropriate for your situation, so pick the pieces that work best for you. And remember that we’re all still adjusting to academia during a pandemic, so be patient with colleagues and administrative staff.</p>
<p>Check the rules</p>
<p>Ask your department about paperwork and what will fulfil its rules. Will you need a notarized signature on your PhD forms, for example? Can you file a signature electronically, and can your committee members sign digitally?</p>
<p>Manage expectations</p>
<p>Set ground rules for your presentation from the very beginning. In a conventional defence, you might dive right into your talk. If you are presenting remotely, take a moment to explain how the technology works — for example, how people can mute or unmute themselves, and how they can submit questions. Set clear rules to help audience members understand their role and know when it’s OK to speak up. Describe the format and what your audience can expect — how long you will present slides for and how much time you will leave for a question-and-answer session.</p>
<p>Hope that everything works, but expect something to go wrong. On the morning of my defence, the wind kept knocking out the power at home; I had to drive to the BML, where I had booked a meeting room, hours earlier than expected to charge my laptop. Even with the best-laid plans, your Internet connection might drop out, or a committee member might get disconnected. Explain how your viewers can reconnect if they need to, and practise redoing a few slides so that you don’t get flustered if it happens.</p>
<p>After the public part is over, either kick everyone out of the video chat during the committee questioning and exam section, or start a separate virtual meeting. In either case, find a moderator (in my case, my principal investigator) and ask them to choose who gets to ask the next question. They can tell each individual to turn on their microphone at the right time, make sure everyone can hear each other, and try to avoid crosstalk and feedback.</p>
<p>Find suitable space and technology</p>
<p>As coronavirus-related restrictions continue, people involved in digital meetings might be more flexible when it comes to disruptions such as children shouting in the background, but these things might still cause stress during a high-stakes presentation. Work out what will fluster you and adjust accordingly. I presented in a conference room because I knew the threat of being interrupted by my baby and dogs would be too distracting.</p>
<p>Consider your backdrop — don’t present in front of a glaring window, for example. Will you need a whiteboard, or can you draw digitally and share your screen? Will you stand or sit? Is there a quiet space at home, and if not, can you create one with the help of family or others you live with?</p>
<p>If your university permits you to be on campus while practising social distancing, there might be seminar spaces available to you with decent webcams, Wi-Fi and remote-presentation equipment.</p>
<p>Standard Zoom accounts allow only 40-minute meetings, but my university gave me a licensed-user account so that I could host a longer one. Webex is one of many other videoconferencing tools. Ask your IT staff what’s available to you. Be patient — they will probably be dealing with many videoconferencing requests.</p>
<p>Practise remotely</p>
<p>Once you have a suitable space designated, practise using it and the same technology you will use during your thesis defence. Have your principal investigator or someone else test that they can hear you and see your slides. Ask whether your lab members can help by providing feedback and asking questions remotely, just as others will during the actual event. Speak slowly and remember to pause — audio and video sometimes take a second to catch up.</p>
<p>Format slides</p>
<p>Format your slides for easy viewing online, and try to eliminate transitions or animations because they might be glitchy. I saved my slides as a PDF because there would be no animation issues that way, and I could send it to all thesis-committee members without formatting problems. It’s best to use a large font so that there is less text on each slide — the viewing screen will be smaller than in a regular talk. Distribute slides to your committee in case members have difficulties seeing what you are sharing on screen, and number each slide so that it’s easy for everyone to navigate to the same one if needed.</p>
<p>Celebrate well</p>
<p>My former lab had a celebration when I successfully defended my thesis, and I was able to join that using video chat. That might not be possible these days for anyone about to defend their thesis remotely. Celebrate with your room-mates or family, or a friend or two, keeping in mind social-distancing guidelines and public safety, and plan to celebrate in person with your team when the coronavirus crisis is behind us. When I tweeted about my experience, a suggestion from one respondent, Leehi Yona, resonated with me: “Zoom in with some friends and change your backgrounds to some of the funky virtual ones (e.g. outer space, on the beach, etc.). Gets a laugh and you can all remotely raise a glass!”</p>
<p>These are difficult times, so be kind to yourself and others if a remote thesis defence doesn’t go perfectly. Congratulations on finishing your degree!

<p>LAGOS (Reuters) - Lagos, Africa&rsquo;s largest city of at least 20 million people, ground to a halt on Tuesday as it and the Nigerian capital Abuja entered a two-week lockdown to stop the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Lagos&rsquo; usual unending cacophony and interminable &ldquo;go slows&rdquo; or traffic jams were gone. Streets were virtually empty but for ambulances and police vehicles. Security forces manned frequent checkpoints where cars crawled through one by one.</p>
<p>Africa&rsquo;s confirmed cases had climbed to at least 5,300 by Tuesday morning, with more than 170 recorded deaths, according to a Reuters tally.</p>
<p>In the little more than 24 hours since Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari had announced the lockdown, coronavirus had transformed one of the world&rsquo;s biggest megacities, where many live in slums and eke out a living at the best of times.</p>
<p>However, the terms of the lockdown have created confusion. While Nigeria&rsquo;s president said food retailers and health facilities could remain open, he did not say whether people could leave their homes to buy necessities or seek care.</p>
<p>On Awolowo road, a normally busy street in the upmarket Ikoyi district, Andy Bankong, a bank security guard, had accepted his fate of a long trek home. No public transport meant walking more than 4 miles. Soldiers told him he could not return to the bank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I lose the job, I can&rsquo;t support my family. And it isn&rsquo;t easy to find work now in Lagos,&rdquo; said the father of two, who sends money to his wife in the southern state of Cross River to feed their children and pay for school fees.</p>
<p>Few were on the streets. Even health staff struggled to get to work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am medical personnel,&rdquo; said Onolapo Adebayo, speaking shortly before 9 a.m. at a bus stop. &ldquo;They are calling me to start coming to the office but there is no vehicle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People who could not afford to stockpile for the 14-day lockdown were left dependent on government relief packages.</p>
<p>The Lagos state government has said it will distribute food to those in need to last the 14 days, targeting 200,000 households, or 1.2 million people, on Tuesday.</p>
<p>On Monday, the federal government in Abuja said it had begun cash transfers to Nigeria&rsquo;s poorest households to sustain them through the crisis.</p>
<p>Across the continent, other countries have introduced their own relief programs for people, including South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana.</p>
<p>Botswana President Mokgweetsi Masisi on Tuesday declared a State of Emergency following three confirmed coronavirus cases. The southern African country will enter a 28-day lockdown from midnight Thursday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This decision was by no means taken lightly,&rdquo; said Masisi. &ldquo;I am convinced that I make it in the best interest of our nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>South Africa, where a lockdown began on Friday, will be the continent&rsquo;s first country to conduct large-scale screening, said President Cyril Ramaphosa, announcing the move late on Monday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Around 10,000 field workers will be visiting homes in villages, towns and cities to screen residents for COVID-19 symptoms,&rdquo; Ramaphosa said.</p>
<p>But in some countries, new restrictions on movement sparked new fears.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa, rights groups have frequently accused police of using excessive force, with complaints about brutality, corruption and extrajudicial executions.</p>
<p>Already, allegations have been made against security forces, empowered by movement bans to carry out abuses.</p>
<p>Videos of South African police beating people in public with sticks circulated on social media.</p>
<p>South African police spokesman Vishnu Naidoo said the videos need to be verified, but have been noted with &ldquo;serious concern&rdquo;, adding: &ldquo;such alleged behavior by security forces is unacceptable, which can be neither tolerated nor condoned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Kenya, the director of public prosecutions ordered an investigation into the fatal shooting of a 13-year-old boy in the slum of Mathare, the prosecutor&rsquo;s office said on Twitter.</p>
<p>Media reports quoted a Nairobi official as saying the boy was hit by a stray bullet.</p>
