<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Living through a global pandemic will have a wealth of unintended consequences positive and negative, but one will certainly be a greater appreciation for those in the medical professions — from those on the front lines treating patients to those researchers laboring behind the scenes, seeking to isolate viruses and to discover vaccines both now and in the past.</p>
<p>Dame Jean Macnamara was one such heroine. She witnessed and made remarkable contributions in her chosen profession — medicine — principally in the area of polio research, and her work with patients with partial or complete paralysis.</p>
<p>Macnamara was born in Victoria, Australia, April 1, 1899. She was born into a family that prized hard work and education, and she excelled at both. Macnamara attended Presbyterian Ladies College and became the editor of the school&rsquo;s magazine, winning the prize for general excellence. She distinguished herself at the University of Melbourne, graduating in 1922 with degrees in both surgery and anatomy. She went on to become a resident medical officer at the Royal Melbourne Hospital.</p>
<p>Macnamara was just 23 when she was appointed resident at the Royal Children&rsquo;s Hospital in May 1923, where she worked until 1925. It was a critical time as a horrifying disease — poliomyelitis, also known as polio — was sweeping the globe. After leaving the hospital, Macnamara worked as a clinical assistant at the Children&rsquo;s outpatients&rsquo; physician and entered private practice to focus on poliomyelitis patients.</p>
<p>But it was in Macnamara&rsquo;s research where her light shone brightest. It was her conclusion that immune serum needed to be used in polio treatment during the pre-paralytic stage. She published and defended her results in both Australian and British journals, though it was a treatment that was never widely administered.</p>
<p>However, it was her discovery in 1931, along with Australian virologist Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet, of more than one strain of the polio virus that made her reputation. Their finding is credited as one of the first steps toward the eventual discovery of the Salk vaccine. She traveled to England and North America on a Rockefeller Fellowship from September 1931 to October 1933, even meeting with President Franklin D. Roosevelt, himself a victim of polio.</p>
<p>In addition to her keen interest in curing disease, Macnamara sought to alleviate the pain and suffering it left in its wake. She is credited with ordering the first artificial respirator (or ventilator) in Australia. She introduced novel approaches to rehabilitation and splinting damaged limbs, most developed in conjunction with conversation with patients and her own splint-maker. Macnamara proved to be a tireless advocate for people with disabilities long before it was in vogue.</p>
<p>She married a fellow physician, dermatologist Joseph Connor in 1934, and in 1935, Macnamara was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for her services to the welfare of children. She died in 1968 of heart disease.

<h3 id="dame-jean-macnamara-google-honours-work-of-pioneering-polio-scientist-and-doctor">Dame Jean Macnamara: Google honours work of pioneering polio scientist and doctor</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/31/15/istock-816394344.jpg" alt="img">
Google is celebrating the life and career of doctor and pioneering disease scientist Dame Jean Macnamara on what would have been her 121st birthday.</p>
<p>Born in Australia on 1 April 1899, Macnamara realised while growing up during World War I that she wanted “to be of some use in the world”.</p>
<p>In 1925, Macnamara’s opportunity came, when a polio epidemic struck Melbourne the same year she graduated from medical school.</p>

<p>For the next six years, Macnamara worked as a consultant and medical officer to the Poliomyelitis Committee of Victoria, where her focus turned to “treating and researching the potentially fatal virus, a particular risk for children,” according to the Doodle.</p>
<p>Her research on the disease, in collaboration with future Nobel Prize winner Sir Macfarlane Burnet, eventually led to the discovery that there are multiple strains of polio. The findings would be important later on when a polio vaccination was developed in 1955.</p>
<p>Macnamara’s dedication to researching the virus meant she also found many new methods of treatment and rehabilitation for children, which included splints and restraining devices, throughout her lifetime.</p>
<p>Her method included splinting the paralysed part of the body until the damaged nerve had recovered, and then re-educating the muscles, according to the Australian National University’s Dictionary of Biography.</p>
<p>A decade after graduating from medical school, Macnamara was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in 1935.</p>
<p>Macnamara treated patients until her death at the age of 69 from cardiovascular disease in 1968.

Ese mismo año, recibió una beca Rockefeller para viajar a Inglaterra y Estados Unidos y estudiar ortopedia. Cuando regresó a Australia, en 1934, se casó con el dermatólogo Joseph Ivan Connor, y tuvieron dos hijas, Joan y Merran. La Dra.
