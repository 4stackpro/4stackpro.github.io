The essence of the piece dealt with the delicate journalistic question of what responsibility TV networks owe to their viewers to broadcast the President discussing the ongoing coronavirus epidemic given that these near-daily briefings have now turned into Trump spouting mistruths and settling scores with journalists.</p>
<p>In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!</p>
<p>Trump seemed to miss the point of the article &ndash; likely on purpose. He selectively quoted the piece to focus on Grynbaum&rsquo;s noting of how well the coronavirus task force briefings have been performing in terms of TV ratings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;President Trump is a ratings hit. Since reviving the daily White House briefing Mr. Trump and his coronavirus updates have attracted an average audience of 8.5 million on cable news, roughly the viewership of the season finale of &lsquo;The Bachelor.&rsquo; Numbers are continuing to rise&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It went on from there but, well, you get the idea.</p>
<p>Aside from misunderstanding the actual point of Grynbaum&rsquo;s piece &ndash; yes, these briefings do well in terms of ratings but is it responsible to carry them &ndash; there&rsquo;s something deeply wrong with how Trump both prioritizes the importance of ratings and what they actually mean.</p>
<p>Start with Trump clearly seeing the ratings for his briefings as a mark of some sort of success he has achieved.</p>
<p>This is not a new thing for Trump. As a reality TV star &ndash; and a cable TV obsessive &ndash; long before he began running for president, ratings have always been the thing he has latched onto as an objective measure of success. If it rates, it is good. Period.</p>
<p>341 occurrences of the word &ldquo;ratings&rdquo; in Trump&rsquo;s tweets. A scroll through his Twitter feed reveals his longtime ratings obsessions. Using the &ldquo;search&rdquo; function at the amazing Trump Twitter Archive revealsoccurrences of the word &ldquo;ratings&rdquo; in Trump&rsquo;s tweets.</p>
<p>His first ratings tweet came May 25, 2010, when Trump typed : &ldquo;The ratings for the Celebrity Apprentice were fantastic and everyone had a great time. It was a terrific season &ndash; congrats to everyone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And practically every week he has commented at least once on ratings &ndash; either low or high &ndash; for some TV network. And in a May 2019 tweet he even took credit for high ratings; &ldquo;Also, congratulations to @OANN on the great job you are doing and the big ratings jump (&lsquo;thank you President Trump&rsquo;)!,&rdquo; he tweeted.</p>
<p>So, yes, Trump has always cared about ratings. But to focus on them now as the country and the world battle a pandemic that experts are saying could lead to the deaths of between 100,000 and 200,000 Americans ? It&rsquo;s beyond unseemly.</p>
<p>Which leads to the even more troubling character traits Trump&rsquo;s ratings tweets reveal.</p>
<p>In Trump&rsquo;s mind, the reason that people are watching the briefings is because of him. Not because they are scared, nervous and trying to gather as much information as they can to make decisions to help their families and themselves. Which is, of course, why people are watching.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t understand that. Because for him, it&rsquo;s always, always, always about him. Asked about his ratings tweets during Sunday&rsquo;s coronavirus daily briefing, here&rsquo;s how Trump responded (bolding is mine):</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve read that CNN doesn&rsquo;t want to cover them. I&rsquo;ve read that &ndash; except they can&rsquo;t help them because their ratings are so high. You know, if the ratings were low, they wouldn&rsquo;t be here. This man wouldn&rsquo;t be here. In 100 years you could bet your life that he would never be here with CNN and all their cameras&hellip;.because we help their ratings. We help &ndash; we lift up their ratings because their ratings are very low. &hellip; But I think the American public ultimately they should be the decider, it&rsquo;s like if they don&rsquo;t want to watch, they shouldn&rsquo;t watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rdquo; means &ldquo;me&rdquo; for Trump. The narcissism there &ndash; whether you like Trump or hate him &ndash; literally smacks you in the face.</p>
<p>To be so focused on yourself when so many are struggling for their lives and their livelihoods is hard to take. But this is who Trump is. And he&rsquo;s not changing. Ever.

<h3 id="coronavirus-trump-says-us-in-good-shape-to-meet-peak">Coronavirus: Trump says US in good shape to meet &lsquo;peak&rsquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6D5D/production/_111479972_2f8ad3b3-bc47-4da4-83e3-b1a9905f1f77.jpg" alt="img">

<p>Donald Trump has said the US will be in &ldquo;a very good shape&rdquo; in terms of the number of ventilators available by the time the coronavirus outbreak peaks.</p>
<p>The president said at least 10 US companies were now making the medical devices, and some might be exported.</p>
<p>The virus can cause severe respiratory issues as it attacks the lungs. Ventilators help keep patients breathing.</p>
<p>The US has more than 163,000 confirmed virus cases and over 3,000 deaths.</p>
<p>New York City is the worst-hit place in America, with 914 confirmed fatalities, according to Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>The US last week became the country with the most reported cases, ahead of Italy and China.</p>
<p>What did Trump say?</p>
<p>Speaking at Monday&rsquo;s Coronavirus Task Force briefing at the White House, Mr Trump said: &ldquo;We have now 10 companies at least making the ventilators, and we say go ahead because, honestly, other countries - they&rsquo;ll never be able to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Asked whether there would be enough ventilators for all patients in the US who needed them during a predicted peak in infections in two weeks&rsquo; time, Mr Trump responded: &ldquo;I think we going to be in a very good shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said more than a million Americans had been tested for the virus, &ldquo;more than any other country by far. Not even close&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He accused a reporter who pointed out that South Korea had tested proportionally more people when measured by population size of negativity.</p>
<p>And he added that he should be congratulated on his administration&rsquo;s progress in fighting the virus.</p>
<p>Mr Trump also repeated his allegations that some US state governors were &ldquo;hoarding&rdquo; critical medical equipment, and that items including face masks were being stolen from hospitals. He gave no evidence for either claim.</p>
<p>Mr Trump said &ldquo;challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days&rdquo;, but that social distancing could save more than a million American lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will have a great victory,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Asked by a CNN correspondent whether his previous comments downplaying the threat of the outbreak were wrong, the president responded that they were &ldquo;all true&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want panic in the country. I could cause panic much better than even you,&rdquo; he told the reporter.</p>
<p>Mr Trump has been accused of slowness in implementing measures to stem the spread of the virus as he feared the economic impact could hurt his re-election prospects later this year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The economy is number two on my list, we&rsquo;re going to save a lot of lives,&rdquo; he insisted.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the situation in the US?</p>
<p>Nationwide guidelines being implemented by many states say citizens must continue to avoid non-essential travel, going to work, and eating at restaurants or bars. Gatherings are limited to groups of under 10 people.</p>
<p>But stricter restrictions apply to millions in some of the worst-hit states.</p>
<p>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why staying at home in is a matter of life and death</p>
<p>On Saturday residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were advised not to travel elsewhere within the country for 14 days.</p>
<p>Non-essential gatherings in New York City are banned and most businesses are closed as the city faces more than 33,000 cases. Police can issue fines of $250-500 (£200-£400).</p>
<p>In California, a &ldquo;shelter in place&rdquo; order remains.</p>
<p>What about the shortage of equipment?</p>
<p>Earlier on Sunday, Mr Trump accused hospitals in some states of &ldquo;hoarding&rdquo; ventilators, face masks and other critical medical supplies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do have a problem with hoarding&hellip; including ventilators. Hospitals need to release them - in some cases they have too many, they have to release medical supplies and equipment,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Hospitals &ldquo;can&rsquo;t hold [ventilators] if they think there might be a problem weeks down the road&rdquo;, he said, alleging that some were &ldquo;stocked up&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The availability of ventilators is a major concern among health professionals as demand has surged. A number of states have warned that they will soon not have enough to treat patients suffering from Covid-19.

<h3 id="fact-check-trump-again-touts-unproven-drugs-for-coronavirus">Fact check: Trump again touts unproven drugs for coronavirus</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200330180543-06-trump-coronavirus-0330-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
Trump inaccurately characterized previous statements he has made downplaying the severity of the crisis. He again talked up medications that have not been clinically proven safe or effective for use against the coronavirus. Immediately after boasting about having superior knowledge of South Korea, he misstated the population of Seoul. And in touting progress on coronavirus testing, he omitted important context.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a fact check of his statements from the briefing.</p>
<p>South Korea and coronavirus testing</p>
<p>Trump touted the number of coronavirus tests the US has conducted, saying &ldquo;over 1 million Americans have now been tested, more than any other country by far.&rdquo; Later in the briefing, when asked when the US per capita number will be &ldquo;on par&rdquo; with the per capita number in other countries, Trump said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very much on par.&rdquo; (He later added, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t talk about per capita.&quot;)</p>
<p>Facts First: Trump was omitting important context. The US has conducted far fewer tests per capita than some other countries, such as Trump was omitting important context. The US has conducted far fewer tests per capita than some other countries, such as South Korea and Italy , though it has been closing the gap in recent days.</p>
<p>Some state governors continue to say that they have not been given access to all the test kits they need ; CBS and the New York Times reported that Trump responded to such an assertion from Democratic Montana Gov. Steve Bullock on a Monday phone call between the President and governors, by claiming, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard about testing in weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Admiral Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services, was asked on Fox News on Monday night how long it will take until the average person who feels sick with symptoms such as a dry cough, body aches and fatigue &ndash; which can be indicative of the coronavirus &ndash; can get tested. He responded , &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not going to be this week or next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anti-malaria drugs for coronavirus</p>
<p>Trump and members of his administration on Monday again mentioned two drugs that could potentially help combat the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, large drugmakers announced that they were providing millions of doses of the drugs to the federal government, and the Food and Drug Administration issued emergency approval for the Trump administration&rsquo;s plan to send the drugs to hospitals across the country.</p>
<p>The medicines, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine , are anti-malaria drugs that have been used off-label at hospitals to treat coronavirus patients.</p>
<p>Facts First: While public health officials are hopeful that the drugs will work against coronavirus, Trump&rsquo;s tone hasn&rsquo;t matched the science, which is extremely limited and anecdotal at this early stage.</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s over-the-top optimism has been tamped down by the medical professionals on the White House task force handling the pandemic. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation&rsquo;s top public health official on infectious diseases, said the proof is only anecdotal. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar was similarly careful with his language on Monday, and referred to the drugs as &ldquo;potential Covid-19 treatments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly touted the drugs in recent weeks, even though there haven&rsquo;t been any clinical trials in humans proving that they work for coronavirus. Earlier this month, Trump tweeted that the drugs &ldquo;have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CNN Health&rsquo;s Arman Azad wrote about this on Sunday. He said: &ldquo;Thus far, there is little scientific evidence that chloroquine, or its closely-related analogue hydroxychloroquine, are effective in treating Covid-19. &hellip; While there&rsquo;s limited evidence on the efficacy of chloroquine, or hydroxychloroquine, the FDA said the drugs&rsquo; benefits outweighed their risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s past comments about the virus</p>
<p>CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta asked Trump what he has to say to Americans who are upset with him for having repeatedly downplayed the virus in February and early March. Acosta read out a series of Trump quotes, including a February 23 remark in which Trump claimed the virus was &ldquo;very much under control in this country&rdquo; and a March 10 remark in which Trump said , &ldquo;It will go away. Just stay calm, it will go away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trump responded, &ldquo;If you look at those individual statements, they&rsquo;re all true: stay calm, it will go away. You know it is going away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Facts First: Trump&rsquo;s previous comments were not &ldquo;all true.&rdquo; The virus was clearly not &ldquo;under control&rdquo; in February &ndash; nor was it under control in mid-March, when Trump made Trump&rsquo;s previous comments were not &ldquo;all true.&rdquo; The virus was clearly not &ldquo;under control&rdquo; in February &ndash; nor was it under control in mid-March, when Trump made another version of the claim , and nor is it under control today.</p>
<p>And Trump was misleading when he said on March 10 that the virus &ldquo;will go away.&rdquo; While the virus may eventually be eliminated in the United States, Trump did not mention that thousands of Americans could die before this happened, nor that the country could have to implement drastic measures to try to slow its spread.</p>
<p>Experts also warn that there could be a second wave of the virus in the US even after the immediate crisis is over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;#COVID19 won&rsquo;t go away. It&rsquo;ll infect the southern hemisphere as they winter and will want to come back to U.S. in fall,&rdquo; Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who formerly served as Trump&rsquo;s Food and Drug Administration commissioner, wrote on Twitter after Trump&rsquo;s comment on Monday. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll have a massive surveillance system by then, and I believe more than one drug to both prevent and treat infection. Our tool box will be very different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seoul&rsquo;s population</p>
<p>Talking about why South Korea has conducted more coronavirus tests per capita than the US, Trump noted that South Korea is more densely populated. He said, &ldquo;I know South Korea better than anybody. It&rsquo;s a very tight. Do you know how many people are in Seoul? Do you know how big the city of Seoul is? Thirty-eight million people. That&rsquo;s bigger than anything we have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Facts First: Trump was wrong about Seoul&rsquo;s population. The population of the city itself was Trump was wrong about Seoul&rsquo;s population. The population of the city itself was about 10 million in 2019 . The Seoul metropolitan region, known as the Seoul Capital Area, had a population of about 26 million
