Richard Lewis, the outgoing chief executive of Wimbledon, hopes tennis can be “off and running again” by August, when the US Open is scheduled to begin, although he admits there may be “no more tennis this year”.</p>
<p>Better late than never to cancel Wimbledon but what took them so long? | Kevin Mitchell Read more</p>
<p>Speaking the day after the All England Club finally cancelled the championships for the first time since the second world war, Lewis acknowledged that uncertainty has gripped tennis because of the continued spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p>“Who knows what will happen over that period?” he said on Thursday of the summer to come. “It’s a challenge for everybody. Let’s hope the US Open and Roland Garros [rescheduled to start a week after the conclusion of the US Open] can take place. It would be genuinely wonderful if the sport was off and running again.</p>
<p>“The optimist in me – and I am often not optimistic – still hopes the American hard-court season, the big tournaments, the Masters and the Premiers, will take place: Montreal, Toronto and then Cincinnati. But we all know that’s probably tenuous at the moment.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s unrealistic to say that there may be no more tennis this year. But I would like to think that things will settle down so that tournaments can be played sooner rather than later.”</p>

<p>Lewis, who quits at the end of July after running the tournament for eight years to make way for Sally Bolton, also hopes the former champions Roger Federer and Serena Williams, who hold 15 Wimbledon titles between them, can play when the championships resume in the summer of 2021.</p>
<p>“We’d love to see both of them back. It’s something to look forward to, and we’ll hopefully enjoy it all the more, a silver lining to come out of it.”</p>
<p>When news broke that the 134th edition of the championships would have to be abandoned, the former British No 1 Annabel Croft described the dilemma for Federer and Williams as “a nightmare”. The Swiss, recovering from knee surgery, is on a record 20 majors, one ahead of Rafael Nadal and three in front of Novak Djokovic, while Williams remains one short of Margaret Court’s all-time record of 24 grand slam titles. Both are 38 years old and their chances of returning to the game after an extended absence depend on their fitness and continued enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Also unknown is how much of a hole cancellation will put in an estimated £250m revenue at Wimbledon. “We’re fortunate to have the insurance and it helps,” Lewis said. “The insurers, the brokers and everybody involved have been excellent to work with so far, but there’s still a lot of work to do.”</p>
<p>He said the annual windfall from that which goes to the Lawn Tennis Association, estimated at more than £40m, should be safe. “The insurance will help protect the surplus to a large extent. The details and the figure probably won’t be known for months.”</p>
<p>These are all daunting challenges for Bolton, the first woman to hold the club’s chief executive job, although Nora Cleather was the acting secretary during the second world war. The surreal atmosphere and circumstances in the year of the virus might well feel like those of 1939-45 for Bolton, a widely respected sports administrator for more than 25 years, having worked in both rugby codes, athletics, and as head of corporate affairs at the All England Club since 2016.

<h3 id="federer-devastated-as-wimbledon-cancelled-due-to-virus">Federer &lsquo;devastated&rsquo; as Wimbledon cancelled due to virus</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/vzKTPwaVNQtwSsrmfvpUqQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SEFgKuOwMoySHQnk8SwjsQ--~B/aD01MTI7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/94bd95ddcd9305a8ab17f07e5fbe1915fcbd3af9.jpg" alt="img">
London (AFP) - Former champion Roger Federer said he was &ldquo;devastated&rdquo; that Wimbledon has been cancelled for the first time since World War II because of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Wimbledon chiefs pulled the plug on the oldest Grand Slam tournament on Wednesday in response to the continued chaos caused by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Federer, who has won a record eight Wimbledon men&rsquo;s singles titles, reacted with a single word, tweeting: &ldquo;devastated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Serena Williams, a seven-time Wimbledon women&rsquo;s singles champion, was also rocked by the news as the American tweeted: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Shooked (sic)&quot;.</p>
<p>Federer and Serena will be nearly 40 by the time of the 2021 championships.</p>
<p>Wimbledon was due to run for two weeks from June 29, with Novak Djokovic and Simona Halep set to defend their singles titles.</p>
<p>But All England Club chiefs were left with no choice but to cancel the grass-court event - which was first staged in 1877 - due to the continued health crisis across the world.</p>
<p>Halep, the Romanian who defeated Serena to win Wimbledon for the first time last year, tweeted: &ldquo;So sad to hear Wimbledon won&rsquo;t take place this year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last year&rsquo;s final will forever be one of the happiest days of my life! But we are going through something bigger than tennis and Wimbledon will be back! And it means I have even longer to look forward to defending my title.&rdquo;</p>
<p>American legend Billie-Jean King, a six-time singles champion at Wimbledon, said the cancellation was the right decision.</p>
<ul>
<li>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a tough one&rsquo; -</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;I fully understand and support the decision of the committee and it is vital we keep our focus on those most impacted by this pandemic. I have been fortunate to go to Wimbledon every year since 1961 and I am certainly going to miss it this year,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right now, we need to make sure we are taking good care of ourselves and our loved ones. These are challenging times for all of us and now is the time for us to do what is right for our world and what works for our sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Story continues</p>
<p>Two-time champion Petra Kvitova summed up the prevailing sentiment among players as she said it would be hard to go a year without visiting Wimbledon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Definitely a tough one to take, with the announcement of the cancellation of Wimbledon this year,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not only is it a special tournament to me, but it&rsquo;s a tournament that has been part of history for so long that it will leave a big hole in the calendar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will miss playing on the beautiful grass and wearing my whites, BUT of course we know it will be back better than ever next year. And maybe we will all appreciate it even more! Stay safe and stay inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coco Gauff, the teenager who dazzled with her surprise run to the last 16 year, tweeted: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna miss playing in Wimbledon this year. Stay safe everyone, love you guys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kevin Anderson, beaten by Djokovic in the 2018 final, tweeted: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always had so many great memories at Wimbledon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The grass season will definitely be missed but the most important thing right now for us to focus on is that we&rsquo;re all staying healthy and safe at home.&rdquo;
