It was reported on Wednesday that two fishing trawlers carrying an estimated 500 Rohingya women, men, and children were in the Bay of Bengal</p>
<p>The two trawlers are headed towards Bangladesh a week after an earlier vessel carrying nearly 400 Rohingya refugees arrived there on April 15.</p>
<p>Momen admitted that they had reports about the two boats but said the government'&lsquo;s priority was the top protect the refugee camp area where tens of thousands Rohingyas are currently living.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It'&lsquo;s a crowded area. If one infected person comes somehow he will spoil everything,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Momen said ongoing unrest in Myanmar'&lsquo;s Rakhine state between the Arakan Army and Myanmar Army is another reason for Bangladesh to turn back the Rohingya.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seemingly a war is going on between Rakhine Army and the Myanmar Army. It a battle zone&hellip; Moreover, they (Myanmar) released 800 Rohingyas before the election. They were sent back to Rakhine, so we don'&lsquo;t know who is coming,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Minister also criticized the European Union and the British government for supporting Myanmar and urged the global leadership and the UN to take the responsibilities of the Rohingya.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Global leadership, the UN should take care of them. Let them take these Rohingya. How many (more) we would accept? Many leaders say many things. They have no shortage of land. Let them accept the Rohingya. Everyone is being pushed towards us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has also expressed its concern over the Rohingya stranded at the sea and urged greater coordination and responsibility-sharing between states to address the maritime movements of refugees and asylum-seekers in the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are increasingly concerned about reports of failure to disembark vessels in distress and of the grave immediate risk, this poses to the men, women, and children on board,&rdquo; Indrika Ratwatte, UNHCR Director of the Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific, said in a statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the context of the COVID-19 crisis, all states must manage their borders as they see fit. But such measures should not result in the closure of avenues to asylum, or of forcing people to return to situations of danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Authorities in Bangladesh on April 16 rescued 396 Rohingya who were trying to enter the country in a boat from the southern coast, after 58 days at sea.</p>
<p>Most of them had left refugee camps in Bangladesh for Malaysia but they were unable to enter the country or any other place and decided to return, said a Bangladesh coastguard spokesperson.</p>
<p>The coastguard official said at least 28 people died because there was no food or water available, and the bodies were dumped into the sea.</p>
<p>Bangladesh sealed its border with Myanmar in March and put Rohingya refugee camps in the country'&lsquo;s southern district of Cox'&lsquo;s Bazar under complete lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19 infections.</p>
<p>However, the authorities have reported no case from the Rohingya camps.</p>
<p>The only confirmed OVID-19 patient, a 65-year old woman, until now from the Cox'&lsquo;s Bazar region has recovered, according to health officials.</p>
<p>Nearly 738,000 Rohingya refugees are living in camps in Bangladesh since August 25, 2017, following a wave of persecution and violence in Myanmar that the UN has described as a textbook example of ethnic cleansing and possible genocide.</p>
<p>Undocumented Rohingya and Bangladeshi migrants have been using the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea to reach other countries in a quest for a better life.</p>
<p>At least 15 Rohingyas drowned in February when a boat carrying them sank off the coast of Bangladesh while on its way to Malaysia.

<h3 id="rohingya-refugees-stranded-at-sea-show-urgent-need-for-regional-response">Rohingya refugees stranded at sea show urgent need for regional response</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.amnesty.org:443/remote.axd/aineupstrmediaprd.blob.core.windows.net/media/23444/220832.jpg?center=0.5,0.5&amp;preset=fixed_1200_630" alt="img">
The Bangladesh authorities should rescue and welcome Rohingya refugees currently stranded at sea, Amnesty International said today. Other governments must fulfil their shared responsibility to carry out search and rescue efforts, in line with their international obligations to protect life, and allow safe disembarkation of refugees and asylum seekers at sea.</p>
<p>Two fishing trawlers carrying an estimated 500 Rohingya women, men and children are currently in the Bay of Bengal after being pushed away by Malaysia, which has imposed restrictions on all boats in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The two trawlers are headed towards Bangladesh a week after an earlier vessel carrying nearly 400 Rohingya refugees arrived there on 15 April. Monitors also believe there could be another vessel still at sea with hundreds more Rohingya stranded, further highlighting the need for governments in the region to get involved in search and rescue operations if needed.</p>
<p>“In contrast to the cruel indifference demonstrated by other governments, who have actively pushed away boats, Bangladesh has maintained its positive record of giving sanctuary to people who have lost their homes and suffered horrific crimes,” said Biraj Patnaik, South Asia Director at Amnesty International.</p>
<p>“We hope that Bangladesh will continue to welcome Rohingya refugees in these difficult times. The international community has an obligation to help the Bangladeshi authorities in this task, including in supporting efforts to set up quarantine centres and provide refugees the immediate medical assistance they require to recover from the journey and to protect them against the spread of the COVID-19 virus.”</p>
<p>Amnesty International last week called on Southeast Asian governments to launch immediate search and rescue operations for potentially hundreds more Rohingya refugees languishing at sea.</p>
<p>Malaysia has actively brought one vessel to shore but launched aggressive military patrols to scare others with Rohingya refugees away while Thailand has remained silent about the growing crisis, not saying whether it has pushed back boats or if it will assist any boats carrying refugees found near its coast.</p>
<p>The situation revives troubling memories of the 2015 Andaman Sea crisis when an untold number of Rohingya people were not rescued and hundreds lost their lives.</p>
<p>In February 2020, the Taskforce on the Bali Process – which included the participation of Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia and Myanmar – “emphasized the primacy of saving lives at sea and not endangering the life and safety of persons in responding to irregular maritime migration.”</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic, Amnesty International said, cannot be a pretext for governments to abandon their responsibilities towards refugees.</p>
<p>All countries in the region have a responsibility to ensure the seas do not become graveyards for people seeking safety. Bangladesh cannot be left to address this situation alone.</p>
<p>“All countries in the region have a responsibility to ensure the seas do not become graveyards for people seeking safety. Bangladesh cannot be left to address this situation alone. The fact that it is upholding its own obligations is not an excuse for others to abandon theirs,” said Biraj Patnaik.
