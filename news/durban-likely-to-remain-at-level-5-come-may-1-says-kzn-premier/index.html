He said KZN had contributed nearly 21% of new cases in the country.</p>
<p>“As of the 25th April 2020, KwaZulu-Natal has had 846 confirmed cases, 29 deaths, and 241 recoveries. While there were no [new] deaths reported we remain vigilant in our monitoring and management of the cases.”</p>
<p>Zikalala said another worrying concern was that 121 health care workers had tested positive in the province - up from 108 last week.</p>
<p>He said the government remained concerned at the emerging situation in eThekwini.</p>
<p>“We are still noticing a trend whereby most of our new cases are being registered in eThekwini, which is recording above 10 cases per day. In fact, there is not a single day that eThekwini does not report new cases - unlike other districts, which can go for days without having new cases.”

DURBAN - The KwaZulu-Natal provincial government is tightening measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus as the number of infections continues to rise in the province.</p>

<p>The Mayor Mxolisi Thomas Khaunda announced the city will be driving a coordinated plan to mitigate against the impact of COVID-19 on local tourism and the industrial economy.</p>
<p>The plan has measures amongst other things, linking affected industry players with the various funds announced by the national government, including the R200 million Tourism Relief Fund and the Solidarity Fund.</p>
<p>The mayor said he will be meeting with different industry stakeholders from industries like the manufacturing and maritime industry to provide COVID-linked support to firms and the industries as a whole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will also work more with businesses in industries that show opportunity as a result of prioritized government procurement, such as clothing and textiles, chemicals (including disinfectants), engineering and construction of medical devices, innovation in ICT and 3D printing, life and health sciences as well as agriculture and food,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The municipality will be working with the provincial government and organised Business structures to activate and expand the Usizo initiative to assist small businesses in the City and across KZN.</p>
<p>To further protect small enterprises from the effects of COVID-19, the city will also provide a six-month rental holiday for informal businesses including street traders, hives/incubators, and retail markets.</p>

<h3 id="ethekwini-mayor-announces-economic-recovery-plan-for-municipality">eThekwini mayor announces economic recovery plan for municipality</h3>
<p><img src="https://risingsunoverport.co.za/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2020/04/1.jpg" alt="img">
Following the speech delivered by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday evening, eThekwini mayor, Mxolisi Kaunda, addressed the media on Durban’s plan to combat the spread of COVID-19 and shared the economic recovery plan for the city.</p>
<p>Durban’s economic recovery plan is anchored on the following eight points: safeguarding jobs, monitoring the city income and health of the economy, facilitating our share of national government support, supporting tourism and industrialisation programme, accelerating radical socio-economic transformation, supporting the township and informal economy, accelerating construction, infrastructure and investment projects and operationalising the Socio-Economic Fund.</p>
<p>“Our plan recognises the need to ensure that the municipality remains financially viable, whilst investing in the economy, which creates jobs and prosperity. Working together with our partners, we will monitor the financial health of the municipality and our customers as the pandemic unfolds, and respond appropriately,” he said.</p>
<p>The eThekwini Municipality will be driving a co-ordinated plan to mitigate against the impact of COVID-19 on the local tourism and industrial economy.</p>
<p>“Our plan entails, among other things, linking affected industry players with the various funds announced by the national government, including the R200 million tourism relief fund and the solidarity fund. We will also ensure that municipality’s own accommodation bookings will now be directed to small businesses like bed and breakfasts. Our Durban Film Office will now provide incentives for production houses to shoot their films in Durban,” said the mayor.</p>
<p>In a very personal commitment of solidarity, the management and political leadership of the municipality will be given various options of donating a portion of their salary into the fund on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p>“The management oversight of the fund will include respected members of business leadership and government executives. We also want to encourage ordinary citizens to donate to the fund, provided that such donations are lawful,” Cllr Kaunda added.</p>
<p>This fund will operate for a period of 12 months and will then be reviewed by EXCO. The impact that the fund has will be measured, documented and reported to EXCO and all external stakeholders.</p>

<p>Once all funding has been disbursed, the support fund will be closed. The mayor stated that he wanted to make it clear that radical socio-economic transformation will be a cornerstone of this economic recovery plan.</p>
<p>“These initiatives must assist us to accelerate industrialisation in township and rural areas so that we can bring over two million people who earn below R100, 000 per annum and the unemployed into the mainstream economy,” he explained.</p>
<p>The city has also put in place a raft of measures to ensure that residents adhere to personal hygiene and receive uninterrupted services.</p>
<p>Since the announcement of the lockdown, the city has installed 223 static water tanks in informal settlements and rural areas and 130 chemical toilets have been delivered to different informal settlements throughout the city. There has been an ongoing programme of cleaning hostels and informal settlements, providing soap, and hand sanitisers.</p>
<p>“The homeless people are also a key component of our interventions as most of them have been given a new lease on life. Working with NGOs, we have been able to house homeless people in 11 shelters and temporary sites around eThekwini where they are provided with meals and other essentials. The faith-based community organisations have been invaluable in all these endeavours and deserve our sincere thanks. During their stay in these sites, the municipality and its social partners are ensuring that their lives are improved through drug withdrawal management programmes and others are being reunited with their families,” he noted.</p>
<p>Turning to more disturbing matters, he shared that it would be remiss of him if he does not sound a warning to those, who continue to take advantage of the lockdown by invading land and erecting illegal structures.</p>
<p>“The president has asked all of us to limit our movements to prevent the spread of this pandemic. As the city, we are not going to allow lawlessness during this period. We are also going to rely heavily on residents and the media to alert us if people invade land in broad daylight,” he added.</p>
<p>In closing, he echoes the president sentiments when he was addressing the nation that after this pandemic- ‘We look ahead to a better future, together.’
