<p>The Tennessee Titans drafted running back Derrick Henry in the second round of the 2016 NFL Draft but it wasn’t until 2018 after DeMarco Murray was released that his workload increased and the Titans really saw what they had in him.</p>
<p>In 2019, Henry ended the regular season as league’s rushing champion and was selected to his first Pro Bowl. Now that fans have seen what he does on the football field, they’re wondering about his life off the field as well as who the beautiful woman is that has been by his side for years. Here’s more on Henry and his longtime girlfriend, Adrianna Rivas. Plus, the huge news she just shared on social media.</p>
<p>Derrick Henry and Adrianna Rivas</p>
<p>How long Rivas and Henry have been dating</p>
<p>Henry’s lady was born Adrianna Yasmin Rivas Colmenero on May 3, 1994, in Odessa, Texas, to her parents Simona and Joe. Rivas grew up rooting for the Dallas Cowboys but that of course changed once she started dating the Titans star.</p>
<p>Rivas graduated from the University of Texas Arlington with a Bachelor of Arts in Public Relations in 2016, which is the same year she and Henry got together. Fabwags noted that after graduation, Rivas worked as a guest service representative for Marriott International and an Account Executive at Technifax Office Solutions.</p>
<p>Today, the couple resides in Nashville.</p>
<p>The huge news Rivas recently announced</p>
<p>On Jan. 10, 2020, Rivas delighted her followers when she let them know that she and the former Crimson Tide back were expecting a baby by posting a picture of a sonogram.</p>
<p>This is the first child for the pair and Henry’s fans know how important family is to him so we’re sure he’s thrilled about starting his own.</p>
<p>Henry’s parents had him when they were just 15 and 16 years old on Jan. 4, 1994, so he was raised by his grandmother, Gladys. She captured the nation’s attention when she watched him receive the Heisman Trophy from her hospital bed in 2015.</p>
<p>During the ceremony Henry said, “Without her, I wouldn’t be who I am today.”</p>
<p>Derrick Henry (@KingHenry_2) introduces his #MyCauseMyCleats and his new foundation in memory of his grandmother. pic.twitter.com/SgYDvpK6cR — Tennessee Titans (@Titans) December 8, 2019</p>
<p>Gladys died the following year but in December 2019, he remembered her with the My Cause My Cleats campaign and unveiled his new Two All Foundation to help youngsters as a positive influence.</p>
<p>“That was my main focus in doing this foundation, just to reach to the youth, be a blessing, be a helping hand in any way possible, affect communities in a positive way because I feel like I can do that with the platform that I have, and that’s something that I’ve always wanted to do,” he said.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt Henry will apply the valuable lessons Gladys taught him in order to be a great influence in his daughter’s life.</p>
<p>Rivas and Henry’s other ‘babies’</p>
<p>Up until now, Henry and Rivas’ babies have only been their adorable pups but that will change when their little girl arrives.</p>
<p>Rivas always shows off pics of her pooches on social media and announces when she is celebrating their birthdays so we have no doubt she’ll do the same for their firstborn.</p>

He is winning both on and off the field.</p>
<p>As an athlete, Derrick Henry has brought joy to Alabama fans.</p>
<p>The native Floridian was special in his three seasons with the Crimson Tide (2013-15), as he was an All-American, a Heisman winner, a two-time Southeastern Conference Champion and a College Football Playoff National Champion among other things.</p>
<p>His fourth season in the National Football League has been sensational, as he has the Tennessee Titans one victory away from a Super Bowl appearance.</p>
<p>Henry finished the 2019 season as the league’s rushing champion with 1,540 yards.</p>
<p>He became the first running back in NFL history to record three consecutive games with 180-plus yards rushing and he completely demoralized both New England and Baltimore in the AFC Playoffs.</p>
<p>Henry totaled 182 yards with one touchdown against the Patriots, while turning in 195 yards rushing (30 carries) with his first-ever touchdown pass in a 28-12 win over the Ravens.</p>
<p>When he’s not destroying opposition on the field, Henry is thinking about life as a father.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old is expecting his first child with his girlfriend, Adrianna Rivas.</p>
<p>Rivas posted a photo of a sonogram on Friday of last week, and revealed the sex of the baby.</p>
<p>Henry and Rivas are excited to soon welcome a baby girl into the family.</p>
<p>With him being a shock to his parents at birth, Henry was raised by his grandmother. He now takes the lessons he was taught and looks to be a strong father in the life of his daughter.</p>
<p>He and the Titans will face the Kansas City Chiefs this weekend for the AFC Championship Game.</p>

Tennessee Titans running back Derrick Henry and his girlfriend Adrianna Rivas have plenty to celebrate, regardless of the outcome of the playoffs. Prior to Henry’s AFC Conference Championship playoff game against the Kansas City Chiefs, Rivas announced her pregnancy publically via Instagram.</p>
<p>In her caption on the post, Rivas also revealed the sex of their unborn child. The pair is expecting a baby girl. Their daughter will be the first child for Henry and Rivas. Read on to learn more about their newest addition to the family, and more, below.</p>

<p>Their Budding Family Already Includes a Few Canine Members</p>
<p>Rivas, an avid dog lover, already has two furry family members. Her first dog, Nala, is a three year old Golden Doodle. She also recently added another puppy to the family in March of 2018. This latest addition, a rottweiler mix named Nino, appeared quite fond of his new sister Nala, as is apparent in this post from April of 2018.</p>
<p>Rivas Has Her Own Business</p>
<p>Rivas also runs her own company, Attraction by Adrianna. The company provides beauty services, namely eyelash extensions. She currently offers four different sets, including services to extend length, increase volume, add depth, and more.</p>
<p>The website also provides photographic examples of each set of lashes. She also shows off her own handiwork on Instagram, including her hair and makeup.</p>
<p>Adrianna Rivas Regularly Attends Titans Games</p>
<p>Henry’s accomplishments speak for themselves. This season, Henry led the NFL in rushing yards, was the only running back in the NFL to eclipse 1,500 yards rushing, and he recently broke an impressive post-season record as well. He is the first running back in NFL history to register two 180 yard rushing games over the same postseason.</p>
<p>Rivas is no stranger to the football field, as she regularly travels to NFL games to watch Henry compete. In fact, she even brought her family along to watch one of Henry’s games in November of 2019.</p>
<p>That’s far from the first game that Rivas has attended. In fact, she has made regular appearances at Henry’s games to show her support throughout the years they have been dating. Even when Rivas can’t make the trip from her home state of Texas, she still watches the games to cheer for Henry.</p>

<h3 id="adrianna-rivas-girlfriend-of-titans-star-derrick-henry-expecting-couples-first-child-together">&ldquo;Adrianna Rivas, Girlfriend Of Titans Star Derrick Henry, Expecting Couple’s First Child Together&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.inquisitr.com/assets/05e3e3/dist/images/logos/favicon.png" alt="img">
Derrick Henry is having quite the week.</p>
<p>As the Tennessee Titans running back prepared for the AFC Championship game, girlfriend Adrianna Rivas took to Instagram to share some big news — the couple is expecting their first child together. She posted a picture of an ultrasound and a sweet message to their yet-to-be-born little girl.</p>
<p>“My body may have made her heart but she made my heart complete,” Rivas wrote.</p>
<p>“She’s my reason and my strength. Thank you, God, for our babygirl.”</p>
<p>Adrianna didn’t share the baby’s due date, though her ultrasound picture and knowing the sex indicates she is a bit further along.</p>
<p>Though Rivas may not be in the spotlight like some other NFL wives and girlfriends — with a following of just a little more than 4,000 on Instagram — she has steadily gotten more attention as the Titans pulled out an unlikely turnaround this season. After a 2-4 start, the Titans went on a torrid run that put them in the playoffs and now the doorstep of the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Along the way, Rivas has taken to Instagram to give a glimpse of her life as an NFL girlfriend. Earlier this year, she took to Instagram to share a picture on the sidelines as she prepared to watch her boyfriend play.</p>
<p>Adrianna has plenty of pictures together with Henry as well, including a recent one where the well-dressed couple posed together. Rivas wore a revealing yellow dress and sandals in the tropical locale.</p>
<p>While Henry may be the one getting the attention as the Titans try to make the Super Bowl for the first time in two decades, Adrianna has her own work as well. She runs a business called Attraction by Adrianna, offering a range of beauty-related services including eyelash extensions.</p>
<p>Adrianna could soon be getting a lot more attention. While Henry and the Titans were able to fly under the radar for much of the season and were underdogs in every playoff game, the run to the AFC title game got them plenty of attention — with most of it on the NFL-best running back. Henry himself has been on the quiet side, not seeking out the spotlight. Should the team advance to the Super Bowl, however, Henry will have two weeks of intense attention in the media blitz that comes ahead of the big game. His relationship with Adrianna Rivas and their child on the way would likely be a major point of interest.

<h3 id="five-nfl-teams-that-should-sign-colin-kaepernick">&ldquo;Five NFL Teams that Should Sign Colin Kaepernick&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://imageproxy.themaven.net/https%3A%2F%2Fimages.saymedia-content.com%2F.image%2FMTcyOTY5NTQ2OTAxMTA0MTYw%2Fusatsi_9823067_168390361_lowres.jpg?w=1024&amp;q=40&amp;h=682&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max" alt="img">
Colin Kaepernick should be in the NFL.</p>
<p>Not because another police officer killed an unarmed black man. Not because the country is more sensitive to police brutality than it was four years ago, although I believe it is more sensitive. Not because opinions of Kaepernick have changed.</p>
<p>Kaepernick should be in the NFL simply because he’s better than most backup quarterbacks. That’s a good enough reason. And he still is relatively young &ndash; only 32. And he could make a handful of good teams even better.</p>
<p>He has value.</p>
<p>But not to every team. The 49ers shouldn’t sign Kaepernick. They already have two good quarterbacks &ndash; Jimmy Garoppolo and Nick Mullens.</p>
<p>Neither should the Patriots, Jaguars or Redskins sign Kaepernick. Those teams have young, inexperienced quarterbacks who need to play. And if they flop, those teams probably will draft one of the top quarterbacks next year &ndash; Trevor Lawrence, Justin Fields or Trey Lance. Teams love those three.</p>
<p>I’m focusing on teams that should offer Kaepernick a one-year, $1 million contract to be a backup. I assume he would accept such a deal. I assume he wants back in the league and will do whatever it takes to show he belongs. I could be wrong. Let’s assume I’m right.</p>
<p>Here are the five teams that should sign Kaepernick.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Titans</li>
</ol>
<p>They have a starting quarterback &ndash; Ryan Tannehill. They gave him a four-year, $118 million contract this offseason. And he played well in 2019. Started 10 games in the regular season and posted a passer rating of 117.5 &ndash; tops in the NFL.</p>
<p>But he didn’t help the Titans much in the postseason. He threw for 72 yards in a playoff win over the Patriots, and 88 yards in a playoff win over the Ravens. Then when the Titans faced the Chiefs in the AFC Championship game and Tannehill needed to throw more than 15 times, they lost. The Titans are an excellent team that needed something from Tannehill in the biggest game of the season but got nothing.</p>
<p>And Tannehill might regress next season. He was the Dolphins’ starting quarterback for six years and his quarterback rating was 87. His record was 42-46. He was relentlessly mediocre. Kaepernick always was better than him.</p>
<p>If Tannehill regresses as a passer, Kaepernick at least could give the Titans another running threat to pair with Pro Bowl running back Derrick Henry.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The Bills</li>
</ol>
<p>This is another terrific team with a questionable quarterback.</p>
<p>Last season, the Bills had the second-ranked defense in the NFL, won 10 games and went to the playoffs. But they lost their playoff game, mostly because their quarterback, Josh Allen, posted a passer rating of just 69.5 in it.</p>
<p>Allen is only 24, and he might improve. But in 2019, he completed only 58.8 percent of his passes. Kaepernick is more accurate than him. Allen mostly hurts defenses as a runner &ndash; he rushed for 510 yards last season. But Kaepernick is a better runner than Allen.</p>
<p>The Bills are built to win now. Unfortunately for them, they might not have a quarterback who can win a playoff game. Kaepernick has won four playoffs games in his career. He would be a perfect backup for them. He might be better than their starter.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The Ravens</li>
</ol>
<p>Lamar Jackson is one of the best young quarterbacks in the league and a better player than Kaepernick ever was.</p>
<p>But Kaepernick is better than Jackson’s backup, Robert Griffin III. Griffin has been completely ineffective since he tore his ACL in 2013. He no longer runs well, and he never passed particularly well in the first place.</p>
<p>Even after taking three years off, Kaepernick can’t be worse than Griffin. And Kaepernick knows the Ravens’ offense. Their offensive coordinator, Greg Roman, was Kaepernick’s offensive coordinator on the 49ers. Kaepernick ran Roman’s pistol offense before Jackson did. We know Kaepernick can succeed in that system, because we saw him do it already.</p>
<p>The Ravens would be smart to upgrade their backup quarterback, because Jackson runs so much and exposes himself to injury.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The Steelers</li>
</ol>
<p>Ben Roethlisberger is 38. He missed 14 games last season, and the Steelers still went 8-8. Almost made the playoffs. They have an elite defense and a great head coach.</p>
<p>But their backup quarterbacks are dreadful. Neither Mason Rudolph nor Devlin Hodges should ever start a game in the NFL. They are practice-squad-level players. How many games would the Steelers have won last season had they signed Kaepernick when Roethlisgberger went down Week 2? Nine games? Ten? Who knows?</p>
<p>Roethlisberger tends to miss games every season. He has played only one full 16-game season since 2014. If any team needs a starting-caliber backup quarterback, it’s Pittsburgh.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>The Rams</li>
</ol>
<p>Are we sure Jared Goff is any good?</p>
<p>He looked good for a couple years, but then he played so poorly in the Super Bowl &ndash; his quarterback rating was 57.9. He led his offense to three measly points. Kaepernick probably would have played better.</p>
<p>Then last season, Goff continued to struggle. His passer rating was 86.5. And doesn’t move well. He’s just a mediocre passer.</p>
<p>Kaepernick at least can scramble around and extend drives with his legs.</p>
<p>There’s a legitimate possibility Kaepernick is better than Goff right now. The Rams owe it to themselves to find out.

There was an awkward moment caught on live television when the Tennessee Titans officially made Georgia offensive tackle Isaiah Wilson the No. 29 overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft.</p>
<p>When Wilson, who was understandably emotional after getting the news he was the Titans’ pick, was shown on camera, the shot of him was somewhat blocked by his girlfriend, who was sitting on his lap.</p>
<p>However, Wilson’s mom wasn’t about to let that happen, so she forcibly removed the big man’s girlfriend from his lap to clear the shot.</p>
<p>And what ensued was a struggle, and, of course, television gold.</p>

<p>That was apparently the wrong time to offer emotional support, at least according to Wilson’s mom.</p>
<p>Naturally, Twitter reacted to the hilarious clip.</p>

<p>The CeeDee Lamb references comes from the video of the Dallas Cowboys draft pick snatching a phone from the hand of his girlfriend, which was also caught on camera and was one of the most memorable moments of the night.</p>

<p>Day 1 of the 2020 NFL Draft was not a good one for girlfriends, but here’s to hoping Day 2 is better.

<h3 id="titans-isaiah-wilson-talks-viral-nfl-draft-video-featuring-mom-and-fiancee">&ldquo;Titans&rsquo; Isaiah Wilson talks viral NFL Draft video featuring mom and fiancee&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://usattitanswire.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/usatsi_13703344.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=576&amp;crop=1" alt="img">
The video clip of Isaiah Wilson finding out he’d be the Tennessee Titans’ first-round pick in the 2020 NFL Draft went viral for all the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>In the clip, Wilson’s fiancee, Grace, was sitting on the big man’s lap and hugging him because he was understandably emotional about the special moment that was taking place.</p>
<p>The only problem was that she was blocking ESPN’s camera shot, which prompted Wilson’s mom, Sharese, to forcibly remove her from his lap after a tap on the shoulder wasn’t enough to get the job done.</p>

<p>Of course, in this day and age it was only a matter of time before that awkward moment caught on live television went viral.</p>
<p>Wilson took the reaction to the video all in stride, though, as he told John Glennon of The Athletic.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, the draft was the biggest spectacle of the quarantine,” Wilson said. “Everyone was tuned in, waiting to get something to harp on to put on social media because people are bored. “It is what it is. Everyone is in the house; nobody can do anything. People were bored and jumped at some funny content. I mean, my family is doing great. We’re all smiles over here.”</p>
<p>Wilson’s mom also addressed the silly situation, noting that the family was in the process of clearing the way for the shot but were just a little too late in doing so.</p>
<p>“I did get quite a few calls from friends on that,” Sharese Wilson said with a laugh. “It’s funny because that little clip, we couldn’t see it at all (while it was happening) because we were kind of following along with ESPN. “But in our minds, we were just like, ‘The cameras are rolling, so let’s get everybody out of the way’ so that Isaiah — we knew they would pan to Isaiah — would talk about his reaction or they’re going to catch him crying or whatever it is. What ended up happening is they were rolling when we were trying to clear out.”</p>
<p>She also says the video blowing up was a result of quarantine boredom.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I think that’s quarantine. There’s not enough to talk about, so maybe some folks had to create a little something because they don’t have anything else to talk about right now.”</p>
<p>The three-day draft was full of hilariously awkward moments caught on camera. In fact, Wilson wasn’t the only Titan who received attention for his at-home shot.</p>
<p>Head coach Mike Vrabel’s war room background caused quite the stir when it appeared his son, Tyler, might have been caught sitting on the toilet with the bathroom door open. Vrabel would later deny that was the case.</p>
<p>Dallas Cowboys first-round pick CeeDee Lamb’s awkward phone grab with his girlfriend went viral and was also one of the most memorable videos to come out of the draft.</p>
<p>Wilson’s still might take the cake out of all of them, though.
