NASA’s Artemis program aims to bring humans back to the Moon, with the goal of staying there for good in the interest of pursuing additional science and exploration missions, including to Mars. But how will the agency actually make it possible for people to remain on the Moon for longer-term science missions? NASA has provided some more detail about its plans with a sustainability concept it released describing some core components of the infrastructure it plans to put in place on the lunar surface.</p>
<p>NASA’s plans focus on three key elements that would enable sustained presence and research work on the Moon’s surface, including:</p>
<p>A lunar terrain vehicle (LTV) that would be used by crew to get around on the Moon. Essentially, this is a rover but that is piloted instead of being robotic. This wouldn’t have an enclosed cockpit, so astronauts would be wearing full protective extra-vehicular activity (EVA) spacesuits while using it for short trips.</p>
<p>A habitable mobility platform, which would be a larger rover that is fully contained and pressurized, enabling longer trips further afield from the spacecraft landing site of up to 45 days at a time.</p>
<p>A lunar foundation surface habitat that could act as a more permanent, fixed location home for crew during shorter stays on the surface. this could house up to four astronauts at once, though the habitable mobility platform would be the primary active residence for surface missions, while the Gateway space station orbiting the Moon would be the main base of operations for crew not engaged in active surface exploration and science.</p>
<p>Like the International Space Station before it, the Gateway is designed to be scaled up over time, with new models attached to add more crew habitation capabilities, as well as additional work and experimentation space. This will be important as it becomes the jumping off point not just for Moon surface missions, but also as a way station for exploration of Mars and beyond.</p>
<p>NASA also says that robotic rovers will be a key component of its Moon infrastructure, to be used for purpose including gathering data and materials for research, as well as helping to spur along the development of production of key resources for sustained presence, like water, fuel and oxygen.</p>
<p>The agency also includes some details about its Mars plans, including how it will send a four-person crew to the Gateway for a “multi-month stay to simulate the outbound trip to Mars.” If it goes ahead as planned, this would be longest continuous human stay in deep space environs, and a key step in understanding how a human trip to Mars would work.</p>
<p>The full NASA “Plan for Sustained Lunar Exploration and Development” is available here for more granular detail on the broad outline listed above. Artemis and its timelines are bound to feel the impact of the global coronavirus crisis, but the goals of the program aren’t likely to change too much, even if the targets for accomplishing them do.

<p>TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — A petition calling for Taiwan to accelerate its moon exploration plans is gaining signatures on the government&rsquo;s online platform and it will respond once the threshold of 5,000 signatures is reached.</p>
<p>Taiwan&rsquo;s National Space Organization (NSPO) launched its 3rd National Space Technology Development Long-term Program in 2019. This entailed the island nation investing an estimated NT$25.1 billion (US$710.39 million) over the next decade to launch 10 satellites into space.</p>
<p>The satellites will take high-resolution images of Earth. Even though the newly mooted program includes the idea of sending a satellite to orbit the moon, it is not the main focus because Taiwan lacks experience and needs to rely on international cooperation to succeed, according to the NSPO.</p>
<p>Under the program, Taiwan&rsquo;s space exploration will begin in 2023 and after six years enter the &ldquo;critical design review&rdquo; stage. The petition states the NSPO does not need to fully commit to space exploration because of a limited budget and resources.</p>
<p>The petition urges Taiwan&rsquo;s Cabinet to incorporate moon exploration into the program and establish the goal of sending a satellite to orbit the moon by 2028.</p>
<p>Technology developed for space exploration has led to the development of diapers, water filters, and integrated circuits. The initiators of the petition believe Taiwan should keep abreast of other nations, such as South Korea and Singapore, as they have been sending satellites to the moon.

<h3 id="mapping-out-the-water-on-the-moon">Mapping Out the Water on the Moon</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1888.jpg" alt="img">
In 2009, NASA launched the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), the first mission to be sent by the US to the Moon in over a decade. Once there, the LRO conducted observations that led to some profound discoveries. For instance, in a series of permanently-shaded craters around the Moon’s South Pole-Aitken Basin, the probe confirmed the existence of abundant water ice.</p>
<p>Based on the temperature data obtained by the LRO of the Moon’s southern polar region, the ESA recently released a map of lunar water ice (see animation below) that will be accessible to future missions. This includes the ESA’s Package for Resource Observation and in-Situ Prospecting for Exploration, Commercial exploitation and Transportation (PROSPECT), which will be flown to the Moon by Russia’s Luna-27 lander in 2025.</p>
<p>Once there, PROSPECT will sample these caches of water ice in order to assess the potential of future missions to harvest them for the sake of constructing and maintaining a lunar outpost – i.e. In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU). Central to this process is the ProSEED, a drill that will extract samples from beneath the surface of the Moon’s South Pole region.</p>
<p>In addition to water, these samples are expected to contain other volatiles that can become trapped at the extremely low temperatures that are expected in this region – typically -150 °C (-238 °F) and lower than -200 °C (-328 °F) in some areas. These samples will then be heated and analyzed by PROSPECT chemical laboratory (ProSPA) to extract these volatiles and subject them to thermochemical processes.</p>
<p>This will involve heating them to temperatures of up to 1000 °C (1832 °F) to test if other chemical compounds (like oxygen gas) can be extracted. The purpose of this is to determine if local resources can be harvested and converted to meet the needs of astronauts and lunar colonists someday – such as producing construction materials, drinking water, and even air.</p>
<p>For her role in developing this improved method of extracting lunar water, Hannah Sargeant of the UK’s Open University was named one of Forbes Magazine’s 30 Under 30 Europe 2020 Innovation list. As Hannah described this honor:</p>
<p>“It’s great to see that research into space resources is being recognized and valued in such a public forum… I’m honored to be a part of this year’s Forbes 30 Under 30 European cohort, but I would like to emphasize that there are many incredible researchers that I work with that are so deserving of a place on this list. The future of space science and technology is definitely in great hands!”</p>

<p>The ProSPA lab will also analyze these samples to get precise isotopic measurements of key elements on the Moon – such as carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen. This will provide insight into the origins, evolution, and placement of volatile chemicals within the Earth-Moon system, but also help astronomers to get a better idea of how volatiles have been distributed throughout the inner Solar System.</p>
<p>Much like the distribution of water, knowing how, when, and where these elements were distributed is key to understanding how our Solar System evolved over time. Since these chemicals are also key to the existence of life as we know it, a volatile record could also provide insight into when life emerged and where else it could be found.</p>
<p>Both PROSPECT and the Russian Luna-Glob program are part of a larger global effort to explore the Moon and prospect for resources. The long-term aim of these missions, along with Project Artemis and the construction of the Lunar Gateway, is to create a sustainable program for lunar exploration and a permanent human presence on the Moon.</p>
