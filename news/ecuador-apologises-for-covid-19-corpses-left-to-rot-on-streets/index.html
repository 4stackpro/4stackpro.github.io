QUITO: Ecuador’s vice president Otto Sonnenholzner has apologised after scores of bodies were left on the streets of Guayaquil as the Covid-19 coronavirus ravages the horror-struck port city.</p>
<p>Residents had published videos on social media showing abandoned bodies in the streets in the Latin American city worst hit by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Authorities collected at least 150 corpses from streets and homes earlier this week, but did not confirm how many of the dead were victims of the outbreak.</p>
<p>“We have seen images that should never have happened and as your public servant, I apologise,” said Sonnenholzer, who is heading the country’s virus response, in a statement broadcast by local media on Saturday.</p>
<p>Ecuador had recorded nearly 3,500 confirmed Covid-19 cases as of Sunday, including 172 deaths.</p>
<p>The government has imposed a state of emergency and introduced a nightly curfew in an effort to contain the spread of the disease. - AFP

<h3 id="the-churchs-response-to-covid-19-in-ecuador">The Church’s response to Covid-19 in Ecuador</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.vaticannews.va/content/dam/vaticannews/agenzie/images/afp/2020/04/03/19/1585933950817.jpg/_jcr_content/renditions/cq5dam.thumbnail.cropped.1500.844.jpeg" alt="img">
A Comboni missionary in Ecuador describes how the coronavirus emergency is overwhelming society in Guayaquil. The dead accumulate in the streets, people are hungry, and it is impossible to maintain quarantine in the poorest areas.</p>
<p>By Vatican News</p>
<p>Father José Barranco is a Comboni missionary based in Ecuador, the Latin American nation most affected by the coronavirus. Speaking to Vatican News, he describes the situation in Guayaquil, a port city of 2.3 million inhabitants, and home to almost half of the 2,700 positive cases of Covid-19 in the country.</p>
<p>The situation throughout Ecuador is very difficult, he says, “but in Guayaquil it is catastrophic”.</p>
<p>Double emergency</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic has triggered a double health emergency in Ecuador: firstly, because the health system has collapsed, and secondly because the bodies of the dead are accumulating in houses and streets, waiting to be taken to the cemetery.</p>
<p>Ecuador’s President, Lenin Moreno, has confirmed that around 150 bodies are collected daily from homes and public spaces. But this is not enough. Morgues are full and many funeral homes refuse to provide mortuary services for fear of contagion.</p>
<p>Not enough</p>
<p>The health system can&rsquo;t cope because medical equipment and staff are lacking. Doctors and nurses are working up to 16 hours a day, doing double shifts.</p>
<p>The extent of the epidemic is partly due to the population not adhering to government instructions to stay at home, says Fr Barranco. But in the vast poverty-stricken areas of Guayaquil it is difficult to impose quarantine. A house is often just one room, he says, “where three, four or even five people live together, and there is little food. What are they supposed to do?”.</p>
<p>Everyone is trying to respond as best they can, says Fr Barranco. But whatever the government, the Church, or medical personnel try to do in this situation, “is not enough”.</p>
<p>The Church’s response</p>
<p>Fr Barranco says the Catholic Church is offering both physical and spiritual support to those in need. He gives the example of a hospital run by the Guayaquil Archdiocese. The structure does not have the capacity to assist Covid-19 sufferers, but it does admit patients with other pathologies.</p>
<p>This helps alleviate some of the pressure from the public health care system. The same hospital is also providing medical advice through a telephone service.</p>
<p>Faith and hope</p>
<p>Local Catholic parishes are working with the government on its &ldquo;Together we feed more people&rdquo; program. They act as collection and distribution points for food rations which are vital at this time, as many people are suffering from hunger.</p>
<p>Fr Barranco is also Director of the National Catholic Radio in the capital city of Quito. He says these same parishes are providing liturgies and moments of prayer through the media. All of these gestures, he concludes, aim to &ldquo;sow faith and hope&rdquo;.

CLOSE</p>

<p>There are people who lead lives that don&rsquo;t follow the usual paths. It would, therefore, probably make sense that those people would have unusual experiences during a pandemic.</p>
<p>Jasmine Poole is one of those people. You may have seen her on stage at a Northern Kentucky bar performing as Wonky Tonk with all the Americana charm of Dolly Parton, if Dolly Parton was also really into experimental punk music.</p>
<p>So Poole isn&rsquo;t working from her home office or binging on &ldquo;Tiger King.&rdquo; She&rsquo;s riding out the novel coronavirus at a Tantric yoga school in Quito, Ecuador. By choice, but also because there&rsquo;s no way for her to get home.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not all stretching and quiet meditation. This isn&rsquo;t a retreat you would see in the movies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been here since Jan. 13 at the equator,&rdquo; Poole told the Enquirer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s this strange yoga school, that&rsquo;s not a yoga school at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean it is, but it&rsquo;s this thing where you&rsquo;re just like facing shadows and everyone&rsquo;s screaming and you&rsquo;re crying every night. And everyone&rsquo;s like, &lsquo;Trust the process.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what it was like before a plague began circling the globe.</p>

<p>Why Ecuador?</p>
<p>Poole started exploring yoga last year as a possible solution to her longstanding struggles with depression and anxiety.</p>
<p>She wanted to avoid pharmaceuticals, medical debt and treatment programs that tend to be geared toward addiction.</p>
<p>As a person who goes all-in, she decided to attend a yoga school and get a certification – something that could be used later in &ldquo;entrepreneurial&rdquo; ways, as well, she said.</p>
<p>But where? A trip to Thailand didn&rsquo;t happen after she woke from a dream in which a person was screaming &ldquo;Not Thailand!&rdquo; at her.</p>
<p>Then, she was hiking in California while taking a break from driving Mark Cohn around and selling merchandise during his tour. You know, Mark Cohn, the voice behind the song &ldquo;Walking in Memphis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This lady had a bag where Ecuador was glowing,&rdquo; Poole said. &ldquo;I just Googled it. I just was like &lsquo;yoga, shamanism, Ecuador.&rsquo; This place showed up, and I didn&rsquo;t read about it. I just paid them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She is aware of just how odd this sounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best way to go. I just go with feelings. You get too much mind into it and gets all wacky,&rdquo; she said laughing. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s kind of how I ended up in that depression world anyhow, not trusting how I felt but more what made sense. And it never made sense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letting the universe decide</p>
<p>On Jan. 13, she arrived at Durga&rsquo;s Tiger School for Tantra Yoga perched on top of a mountain outside Quito, Ecuador.</p>
<p>Ecuador sits on the west coast of South American. About 16.2 million people live there, almost the same population as Ohio and Kentucky, but Ecuador has a bit more land than the two states combined.</p>
<p>The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the country was announced Feb. 29. On Monday, about a month later, the World Health Organization reported 1,835 confirmed cases in Ecuador and 48 deaths. Numbers on par with Ohio alone.</p>

<p>President Lenín Moreno started imposing measures to stop the spread of the virus on March 11. Those measures have escalated over the last three weeks and now there is a nightly curfew, domestic and international travel is restricted, non-essential business is banned.</p>
<p>Poole said in the Quito region, only one person can leave each household to buy food. That applies to the school, as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t leave,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been here inside this compound for a very, very long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What started as a class of about 40 students has dwindled to 14, she said.</p>
<p>Starting about three weeks ago, she said every day they woke up and someone else had taken a plane home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just kind of sat waiting to just let the universe decide,&rdquo; she joked.</p>
<p>But the planes have stopped flying. Earlier this week, Poole got an email saying her April 12 flight home was canceled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it comes to my decision I really am on this journey. I love people at home, but I&rsquo;ve never belonged, which is why I came to the equator to find my people, to find myself,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m totally fine with it. I&rsquo;m actually quite excited about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poole has degrees in political science and electronic media broadcast from Northern Kentucky University. Before that, she graduated from Highlands High School in Fort Thomas.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Just make it up as you go&rsquo;</p>
<p>Poole is now helping the school set an online program that students from around the world can attend. This is in exchange for room and board for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Not only is she stuck in Ecuador, but she is also stuck at the compound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in this school run by some Germans and we&rsquo;re a bunch of foreigners,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;For our safety, we don&rsquo;t go out because, at this point, it&rsquo;s understood that the foreigners are the ones that brought it to Ecuador.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she said the school is like a bubble. Those who have stayed really want to be there to continue the work they were doing.</p>
<p>She said now the remaining students are becoming a part of what brought them to Ecuador while also forming an experimental community to ride out the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What better place than to get quarantined in a time like this than at the equator in a shamanic tantric yoga school,&rdquo; Poole said. &ldquo;We sit around in a circle and we hum and imagine that we are creating force fields of protection around the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her life outside the school is completely on hold. She was supposed to fly home on Easter and start a tour in Wyoming on the April 15. Her new record was scheduled to come out on the 24th along with a series of Wonky Tonk beers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of like what the world is going through right now. Not knowing when the end is going to come, in terms of the quarantine,&rdquo; Poole said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like sitting in the unknown, having to deal with yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she said she is living her dream, music, side hustles, getting some of money from the online artist-support platform Patreon and going to yoga school.</p>
<p>Luckily, she&rsquo;s been renting out her house back home for some additional income so she can continue to morph Wonky Tonk into what she would like it to be: &ldquo;a meld of rock and roll and consciousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every moment and every plan that I&rsquo;ve made this year has fallen apart,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I get the picture. Just make it up as you go.&rdquo;</p>
