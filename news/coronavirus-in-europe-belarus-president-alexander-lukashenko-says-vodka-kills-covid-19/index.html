“It’s better to die standing on your feet than to live on your knees,” said Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, before a hockey game last week.</p>

<p>The journalists at BuzzFeed News are proud to bring you trustworthy and relevant reporting about the coronavirus. To help keep this news free, become a member and sign up for our newsletter, Outbreak Today.</p>
<p>He has been famously described as Europe’s last dictator. But Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko is proving himself worthy of another label: coronavirus truther.</p>
<p>As leaders across the world close their countries’ borders, shut down transportation, ban mass gatherings, and order millions of people indoors to try to halt the spread of the new coronavirus, a defiant Lukashenko is ignoring expert advice and taking a different, dangerous approach — by doing almost nothing at all. Lukashenko has described the stringent measures taken by other countries as “utter stupidity” and told Belarusians that the pandemic is nothing more than a “psychosis.” As of Monday, Belarus had 152 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, according to its health ministry. But in the former Soviet republic of 9.5 million people, there is no talk, let alone practice, of social distancing or quarantine. Shopping malls remain open, public transportation continues to run, theaters are screening films, restaurants carry on serving customers, and the country’s premier soccer league plays on. Last Friday, a match between Belarusian teams Torpedo-BelAZ Zhodino and Belshina Bobruisk was the only professional match played in the world. Remarkably, with professional soccer leagues everywhere else suspended, people are actually tuning in to watch Belarus’s league for a change.</p>
<p>Lukashenka said that COVID doesn&rsquo;t take Belarus people, because God helps us, that sauna and ice-hockey prevent the infection. It’s only one country where football games are being played; kids go to the circus, and TV anchors mock people who wear masks.</p>
<p>Other authoritarian and populist leaders have similarly played down the coronavirus pandemic ravaging countries the world over. But many of them eventually came around to enforcing measures recommended by health experts to stop its spread.</p>
<p>After telling Russians the “situation was under control” two weeks ago, Vladimir Putin finally ordered borders closed and declared this week a national paid holiday in order to get people to stay home. Similarly, President Donald Trump, after minimizing the threat of the virus, came around to ordering more drastic measures and social distancing guidelines as it swept across the US this month. But Lukashenko’s approach stands out — not because of what he has done, but because of what action he still has not taken and the poor advice he is doling out. “The world has gone mad from the coronavirus. This psychosis has crippled national economies almost everywhere in the world,” Lukashenko said last Friday, indicating he planned to continue with the status quo. He also cited Trump’s warnings about ensuring that the cure is not worse than the virus as justification for his own lax response. A former collective farm director with an odd penchant for root vegetables who has been in power since 1994, Lukashenko had previously encouraged Belarusians to go out and work the fields to ward off the virus. “In the countryside, people are working in the fields, on tractors. No one is talking about the virus,” he said. “There, the tractor will heal everyone. The fields heal everyone.” His comments prompted a meme on social media: red “Tractorin” pills shaped like tractors.</p>

<p>Lukashenko also recommended that his citizens drink vodka, which he said would kill the virus but most certainly does not, according to actual medical experts. “I don’t drink, but recently I have said that people should not only wash their hands with vodka but also poison the virus with it,” the autocrat said last week. “You should drink the equivalent of 40–50 grams of the pure vodka daily.”</p>
<p>He had one caveat, however: “But not at work.” Lukashenko had one more suggestion for fighting the coronavirus: frequent visits to the sauna, where he claimed without any sound evidence the virus could not survive, due to the heat. Perhaps the only piece of good advice he gave to the public was to “wash your hands more often.” Lukashenko has taken some action against the coronavirus. For instance, he has imposed a requirement for all foreigners entering the country to go into 14 days of self-isolation and ordered companies to increase the production of ventilators. A World Health Organization representative, careful not to criticize Lukashenko directly, told the state-run BelTA news agency that the country was “coping” well so far, praising its testing capacity and ability to quickly isolate cases in hospitals.</p>

<p>Still, it seems Lukashenko has done more to keep the public from receiving information about the coronavirus than he has to try and stop it from spreading. Last week, he ordered his notoriously heavy-handed state security service — still named the KGB even three decades after the collapse of the Soviet Union — to investigate anyone who reports a death related to COVID-19. The first person targeted after the order was Sergei Satsuk, the editor of the Belarusian news outlet Yezhednevnik (Diary), who on March 23 published an article doubting Belarus’s coronavirus statistics and writing that “it’s time to panic.” Two days later, KGB agents picked him up outside Minsk and slapped him with what he said was a bogus bribery charge. Authorities also raided his news outlet’s offices. It will likely be harder to keep information about deaths from coming out as the crisis in the country deepens, which health experts say is only a matter of time. “Quarantine will be announced sooner or later in Belarus,” a doctor of Belarusian descent who works at a New York hospital told the independent Belsat news outlet on Sunday. “Of course, the later this is done, the more serious the wave of severe patients will be, the fewer people will survive and the more doctors will suffer.” On Saturday, Lukashenko appeared relaxed and unconcerned. Donning hockey gear and stepping onto the ice for an exhibition game with some of the Belarusian elite, he told a TV reporter who asked whether he is afraid of the coronavirus, “It’s better to die standing on your feet than to live on your knees.”</p>

<h3 id="reviving-the-fen-therapy-for-europes-lungs-in-belarus">Reviving the fen: therapy for Europe&rsquo;s lungs in Belarus</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.birdlife.org/sites/default/files/styles/full_1140x550/public/news/fen_5_for_web.jpg?itok=edtuL-RD" alt="img">
Do you know what fens are? They are one of the main types of wetlands, and usually have peaty alkaline soil and characteristic flora. Fens are natural habitats: a precious home to nature. Unfortunately, some fens are at risk of being drained for farming, threatening both biodiversity and the climate. Our partner, APB-BirdLife Belarus, is taking action to protect fens. This is their story.</p>
<p>Dzikoje sedge fen (23,145 ha) is part of Bielaviežskaja Pušča National Park. It is also one of the high-profile wetlands of Belarus, and one of the first protected areas in the country.</p>
<p>Since 1999, its area is included in the national park. As such, the Dzikoje fen complex has now the status of a UNESCO World Heritage Site and UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. It is an Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA) and one of Belarus&rsquo;s 26 wetlands protected under the Ramsar Convention. The Dzikoje Fen is significant for the conservation of biodiversity not only in Belarus, but also globally. It holds one of the three largest populations of Aquatic Warbler in Belarus. There are only a few such fens left in Europe, as most of them were drained for farming.</p>
<p>The natural water regime of the Dzikoje Fen was disturbed by large-scale reclamation – also known as land fill. One half of the fen - the upper reaches of the Jaselda River - was drained and today is used for agriculture. However, 330 ha of land on the edge of the ameliorative system, which was drained without an engineering project, is not used today in any way and is overgrown with bushes.</p>
<p>In 2018, this area was included in the national park through APB assistance.</p>
<p>The academic Institute of Experimental Botany identified this land as an important place for fen conservation. It was decided to rewet it to create a buffer zone between the natural fen and the farmland. In this way, natural fen vegetation and rare animal species, such as the Aquatic Warbler and the Greater Spotted Eagle may return.</p>

<p>In April 2019, dams were built in channels to restore the hydrological regime as part of the &ldquo;Conservation Project for the Bielaviežskaja Pušča&rdquo; implemented by ABP-BirdLife Belarus and Bielaviežskaja Pušča National Park with the support from Frankfurt Zoological Society (Germany).</p>
<p>Alexandre Vintchevski, Director of APB-BirdLife Belarus says, &ldquo;In 1999, we were pleased to learn that the national park was granted the permission to add the zakaznik Dzikoje to its territory. However, the national park did not have enough funds for that, so we stepped in and we raised the necessary money. Onno de Bruijn – a Dutch amateur ornithologist – funded the inclusion of the fen in the national park through APB Birdlife Belarus assistance with his own money. Since then, the fen has its master – the national park. The management plan was developed jointly. Now works are beginning to optimize the hydrological regime of the fen&rsquo;s edge, and we are very grateful to the conservation authorities, executive bodies, the national park, and our friends from Germany - FZS – because we can now realize our lifelong dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the Pushcha, groundwater level has been declining steadily, and it has had a strong impact on the local ecosystems - spruce and ash forests are drying, greenhouse gas emissions are increasing.</p>
<p>Vasil Arnolbik, Deputy Director General of the national park speaks out: &ldquo;In the past, the Bielaviežskaja Pušča was highly waterlogged. There were 41,000 ha of bogs and fens just in the Belarus part of the famous forest, and we lost half of them - they were drained about half a century back. This resulted in the disturbance of the ecological balance; we lost the structure of the natural complexes and began to lose species. All conservation activities are written down in the Bielaviežskaja Pušča management plan, and the restoration of the hydrological regime is viewed in the document as top priority. Therefore, we are implementing the plan on a step-by-step basis thanks to the cooperation with the German FZS and Belarus BirdLife APB, which started in 2013. We began with the optimization of the hydrological regime of small water streams, after that we implemented large-scale works on the Dziki Nikar and Papialiova Bogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twenty-five dams were built on the project site with 30 cm elevation difference. They will hold the water that would otherwise leave the fen and form a buffer between the wetland and the ameliorated areas. In this way, we are shifting the amelioration impact zone away from the fen. These 300 ha will now take the main weight of the attack from the farmland adjoining the living fen.</p>
<p>For the habitats of Belarus, water is the most essential element. Our fens and bogs are often called the lungs of Europe. However, many of them are in a sad state. We will continue the re-wetting until their situation improves.</p>

<h3 id="belaruss-geopolitical-loneliness">Belarus’s Geopolitical Loneliness</h3>
<p><img src="https://jamestown.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Belarusian-border.jpg" alt="img">
The veil of uncertainty (see EDM, March 17) surrounding Belarus’s short- to medium-term socio-economic prospects continues to thicken. Alexander Chubrik, a reputable economist, writes about the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse who have arrived in Belarus at the same time (Tut.by, March 16). They represent complications in the oil trade, protectionism, COVID-19 and external debt. Plummeting oil prices have played the first fiddle in this quartet, as they have undermined the revenues Moscow planned to extract in 2020 and consequently dashed all hopes that Russia’s demand for Belarusian goods would grow. The collapse in oil prices slashed the Russian ruble, and that immediately increased the dollar prices of Belarus’s exports to Russia. In turn, that made the devaluation of the Belarusian ruble inevitable because without it, Belarus’s export would have declined even more rapidly.</p>
<p>One more outcome of sharply declining oil prices is going to be an equally sharp drop in natural gas prices on the spot market. That will depress Russia’s revenues and further curtail Russia’s demand for Belarusian goods, while at the same time effectively making the previously agreed upon “low” price for Russia’s natural gas to Belarus one of the highest in the region. Furthermore, when Russians start losing wages and jobs, they will forget about integration entirely and double down on protecting their market from foreign competition.</p>
<p>As for COVID-19, it caused a global recession (which many were expecting in 2021) to occur much earlier. Consequently, exports will be hurt—and not just exports to Russia. Already in the first quarter of 2020, export of refined oil alone declined by 70 percent compared with the first quarter of 2019 (Svaboda.org, March 20). With much smaller inflow of hard currency due to falling exports, the problem of repaying the existing external debts will be more difficult to resolve. When hard currency will only be obtainable in exchange for Belarusian rubles, that will cut back on the state’s social obligations. The only hope of alleviating the aforementioned problems is in restarting the credit line of the International Monetary Fund, Chubrik believes (Tut.by, March 16).</p>
<p>Writing for the Moscow Carnegie Center, Artyom Shraibman reflects on how oil trade and the COVID-19 pandemics are finishing off what remains of mutual trust between Minsk and Moscow (Carnegie.ru, March 20). With each passing day, the still unresolved oil price argument with Russia looks less as a matter of sheer bargaining and more as a political choice for Belarus. And yet on Saturday, March 21, like a bolt from the blue, news emerged that Russia said yes to all of Belarus’s suggestions pertaining to the oil supply (Belta, March 21) and to even larger discounts than originally requested (Tut.by, March 23). Whether this sudden agreement was solely the result of plummeting market prices or something else remains to be seen.</p>
<p>On March 18, Russia closed its border with Belarus (until May 1) without consulting with the latter but citing Belarus’s non-compliance with the World Health Organization’s (WHO) coronavirus guidelines, a statement that Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei called “delirious” (Naviny, March 23). That measure made it difficult for Belarusians to return home from remote foreign countries via Russia, a traditional transit route for many. It also precluded shopping trips across the eastern border for those residing close to Russia. Most importantly, it aggravated President Alyaksandr Lukashenka’s sore spot, as it was he who had solemnly removed an ersatz barrier on the border with Russia back in 1996 together with late Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin. “How can one take such a decision!” exclaimed Lukashenka, “Without consulting us but confronting us with the accomplished fact!” Instead, according to Lukashenka, Russia should have assisted Belarus in “safeguarding our common border in Brest,” especially considering that “we take guidance from the same school of thought in virology” (Vzglyad, March 16). In response, Moscow stated that Belarus has more COVID-19 cases per 1,000 people than Russia and that Lukashenka grew emotional in view of the upcoming elections (Carnegie.ru, March 20). In its turn, Minsk sent hundreds of Belarusian border guards to its eastern border and barracks for them are now being built. Overall, the closure of the border manifested the triumph of the “logic of sovereignty”—that is, of looking out for oneself in the first place. “Whereas for Russia’s powers that be, this is a barely noticeable phenomenon […] for Belarus, this is a new self-perception paradigm,” believes Shraibman, because the ruling elite and the part of society that looked to Russia are coming to terms with the idea that the country must rely on itself as there are no unconditional friends anymore.”</p>
<p>Finally, unlike all of its neighboring countries, Belarus did not suspend face-to-face instruction in schools and did not resort to mobility limitations. Belarus did not initiate border closings, its neighbors did. Moreover, a national soccer championship began in Belarus, with no limitation for spectators. “The most closed country in Europe has turned into Europe’s most open country overnight,” exclaimed sociologist Aliaksei Lastouski (Lastouski, March 17). On March 16, the political commentator Alexander Vlaskin declared that Belarus was in a good company, as the only two other European countries that refrained from mobility restrictions were Switzerland and the United Kingdom (Vlaskin, March 16). By now, however, the UK has left this exclusive “club.” Alyaksandr Lukashenka opined that “the world became deranged because of coronavirus” and suggested that a would-be closure of schools would send children of working parents to their grandparents, who are the most vulnerable group; so unwarranted closures do more harm than good (Naviny, March 20). Seemingly paradoxically, members of the Belarusian opposition, who are self-proclaimed democrats, are urging Lukashenka, whom they label a dictator, to impose restrictions along the lines of other European countries, leading some observers to claim that, in Belarus, the world has turned upside down (Svaboda.org, March 19).</p>
<p>Certainly, that sense is being felt all over, not only in Belarus. But this country’s new geopolitical loneliness is making future developments even less predictable than elsewhere.
