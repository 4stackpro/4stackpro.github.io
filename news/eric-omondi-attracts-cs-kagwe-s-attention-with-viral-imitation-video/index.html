Renowned comedian Eric Omondi attracted the attention of Health CS Mutahi Kagwe on Thursday, April 9, after he recorded a video imitating him.</p>
<p>In his usual daily briefs, the CS mentioned that he would try as much as he could, not to run the presser as Omondi had depicted in the video that has since gone viral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will try very much not to do it the Eric Omondi style,&rdquo; Kagwe shared a light moment with the journalists before he began his briefing.</p>

<p>In Omondi&rsquo;s video that was published on Tuesday, April 7 and has been trending on Youtube, he posed as the CS during one of his briefings.</p>
<p>He was surrounded by three people (posing as Health officials) fully covered in masks when making his speech.</p>
<p>His mode of speech and style of delivery clearly depicted how the Health CS presents his usual daily briefings.</p>
<p>Omondi started by outlining some of the measures that the government had put in place to curb the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Further, he used a case study of a patient known as Kevin Otieno, whom he stated had arrived in the country on March 8, 2020, and had failed to self-quarantine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we trying to say, when we ask you to self-quarantine, we expect you to do it on your own without government supervision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kenyans must be serious about this issue,&rdquo; Omondi stated.</p>
<p>Omondi, a celebrated comedian, has managed to keep his audience tickled with his entertaining performances.</p>

<p>As the number of coronavirus infections in Kenya continues to rise and the reality sinks in as to the effects of the pandemic, award-winning comedian Eric Omondi has tapped into his niche for much-needed humour.</p>
<p>Propelled by his love for parodies, Omondi has to much acclaim impressed with his characterizations of officials across the continent as they update their respective countries on the spread and fight against Covid-19.</p>
<p>None, however, surpasses the nod by Health Cabinet secretary Mutahi Kagwe on April 9 after he recognized the comedian’s work in a viral piece of him published on April 7.</p>
<p>In his address, CS Kagwe humorously said he would not to run the presser as Omondi did.</p>
<p>“Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen of the press. I’ll try very hard not to do it Omondi style,” said Kagwe before he began his briefing.</p>
<p>In the video, Omondi immersed himself in character and with a burst of polished humour, punctuated his briefing with a fictional case of Kevin Otieno - a patient whom he said arrived in the country on March 8 and failed to self-quarantine.</p>

<p>Flanked by three individuals posing as health officials with matching precautionary gear, the father of one outlined some of the measures that the ‘government’ had put in place to curb the pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we trying to say, when we ask you to self-quarantine, we expect you to do it on your own without government supervision. Kenyans must be serious about this issue,&rdquo; Omondi narrated.</p>
<p>In his quest to lighten up the region, he extended his humour to Uganda where he was not short of content as he took on President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni’s role.</p>
<p>In that particular clip, he presidentially vented out his frustrations on what he termed as the stubbornness of Ugandans in adhering with his government&rsquo;s directives on Covid-19.</p>

<p>The punchline? ‘President Museveni’s’ phonecall during the ‘live press briefing’ as he shifts his entire attention to the caller.</p>
<p>“Look at the person calling me, it is the minister of sports. Why is the minister of sports calling me?” Posed Omondi in deep Ugandan ascent.</p>
