VETERANS and politicians have welcomed an initiative encouraging people to mark Anzac Day from their driveways this year.</p>
<p>Public services have been cancelled to help manage the spread of the COVID-19 virus and protect vulnerable people, particularly seniors.</p>
<p>Since the decision was made on March, suggestions to commemorate Anzac Day in other ways have spread across social media.</p>
<p>Joondalup City RSL president Rick Green, World War II veteran Victor George Sinclair (95) of Kallaroo, and northern suburbs MPs are encouraging residents to do a ‘driveway tribute’ at home about 6am on April 25.</p>
<p>“In these desperate times we have desperate measures with social distancing there will be no dawn service this Anzac Day,” Mr Green said.</p>
<p>“As our nation remembers those that fought for our great country our flags will still fly at half-mast on Anzac Day.</p>
<p>“Anzac Day is not all about the dawn service; it’s a day to remember those that fought and those that paid the ultimate sacrifice for our country.</p>
<p>“You may choose to remember them in your own way either standing at the end of your driveway with a candle, taking a quiet moment, or by visiting our memorials throughout the day to show your respects.”</p>
<p>Girrawheen MLA Margaret Quirk said the challenge currently facing the community “pales into insignificance to those endured by the Anzacs”.</p>
<p>“Pausing to remember the bravery, courage, and sacrifice of those who served Australia in all wars is timely,” she said.</p>
<p>“I congratulate the RSL for keeping the memories alive and for its care and advocacy for those who returned.”</p>
<p>Joondalup MLA Emily Hamilton said it was a time to remember “the brave men and women who fought for the freedoms we enjoy today”.</p>
<p>“It is an unusual time but my children and I will be standing at the end of our driveway at 6am on Anzac Day and I hope that our community will join us to show our respect,” she said.</p>
<p>Kingsley MLA Jessica Stojkovski said many people would be looking for ways to commemorate and honour service men and women, “even in these turbulent times of social distancing and isolation”.</p>
<p>“The driveway tribute is a great way to come collectively to pay our respects, while maintaining social distancing,” she said.</p>
<p>Volunteers from the sub-branch run the Veterans’ Support Centre Joondalup, based at the Heathridge Community Centre.</p>
<p>It offers 24/7 support for veterans on 0437 378 498.</p>
<p>The veterans and politicians pictured met at the war memorial at Ocean Reef Sea Sports Club for photos before gathering restrictions were reduced to two people.

<h3 id="coronavirus-australia-and-new-zealand-cancel-anzac-day-services">Coronavirus: Australia and New Zealand cancel Anzac Day services</h3>
<p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/36E5/production/_111335041_gettyimages-1144989140.jpg" alt="img">

<p>Australia and New Zealand have cancelled joint Anzac Day commemoration events at Gallipoli amid fears over the spread of coronavirus, officials say.</p>
<p>Services to mark the countries&rsquo; participation in World War One will no longer take place on 25 April.</p>
<p>Thousands of military personnel from Australia and New Zealand lost their lives after landing at Gallipoli Cove in Turkey in 1915.</p>
<p>Solemn ceremonies are held every year to commemorate veterans and soldiers.</p>
<p>The countries had earlier banned large gatherings and asked their citizens overseas to return home.</p>
<p>New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the Gallipoli services had become &ldquo;a pilgrimage of sorts for many New Zealanders&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But with global travel restrictions and isolation requirements in place in most countries it is simply not practical to hold this year&rsquo;s event,&rdquo; she added in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Australia&rsquo;s Minister of Veterans&rsquo; Affairs, Darren Chester, said he regretted the decision to cancel the events, but that some services could still go ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll Just have to do it differently. We&rsquo;ll have to live-stream events. We&rsquo;ll have to make sure we are providing opportunities for people to still respect our veterans,&rdquo; he told broadcaster ABC TV.</p>
<p>Traditionally, services include the Anzac Dawn Service, the Australian Lone Pine Service, international wreath laying ceremonies and the New Zealand Service at Chunuk Bair in Turkey.</p>
<p>What does Anzac Day represent?</p>
<p>It marks the anniversary of the first campaign that led to major casualties for the Australia and New Zealand Army Corps (Anzac) during World War One.</p>
<p>On 25 April 1915, soldiers from both countries landed at Gallipoli Cove in Turkey, part of an Allied effort to capture the peninsula from the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p>Collectively termed Anzacs by a military clerk keen to fit the name on a rubber stamp, the acronym stuck.</p>
<p>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption An Australian soldier lays a wreath at the Cenotaph in London on Anzac Day (circa 1920)</p>
<p>After an eight-month campaign, the Allies retreated in defeat after heavy losses on both sides. More than 87,000 Turks died, along with an estimated 44,000 men from the British Empire and France, including about 8,500 Australians and nearly 3,000 New Zealanders - one in four of the Kiwis sent to Gallipoli.</p>
<p>It was the Anzacs&rsquo; first major engagement on the world stage, fought by the grandfathers and great-grandfathers of today&rsquo;s Australians and New Zealanders.</p>
<p>The first Anzac commemorations were held in 1916. These have morphed into big-budget productions in Australia, New Zealand and Turkey.

<p>NEXT YEAR WILL BE BETTER: John Skinner will have to wait until next year for a ceremony at the Cenotaph.</p>
<p>AS THE sun rises on April 25th, residents all over the Downs will take to their driveways to honour fallen soldiers.</p>
<p>The outbreak of coronavirus has seen traditional services cancelled but people are looking for innovative ways to make sure the Anzac spirit burns strong.</p>
<p>Killarney RSL sub-branch president Jim McGee said he would be among the Killarney residents to take three minutes to reflect at 6am.</p>
<p>“I think it’s great, it shows that people really care even if there is no public meeting or ceremony,” he said.</p>
<p>“They will still show their appreciation for the soldiers who lost their lives and all who served.”</p>
<p>Mr McGee said was unsure how many residents would take part on the day.</p>
<p>“It’s a catch-22 isn’t it, you would never know if they were because we all have to stay at home,” he said.</p>
<p>Killarney woman Ann Ragh said her street would join at dawn.</p>
<p>“The Killarney Quilters were going to make a banner to give the sub-branch for Anzac Day but now when it’s finished I’ll hang it out the front of a house in our court and we’ll have a dawn service,” she said.</p>
<p>Warwick RSL sub-branch president John Skinner said he had yet to decide how he would mark the day.</p>
<p>“The RSL has encouraged us to light a candle, listen to The Last Post or have a bit of reflection from our driveways while we officially can’t do anything,” he said.</p>
<p>“Well out where I am, my neighbours are kilometres away, but younger veterans and certainly those who are over 60 and can’t go out will be standing at the end of their driveway,” he said.</p>
<p>Despite the loss of this year’s ceremony in the Warwick Cenotaph, Mr Skinner is looking forward to next year’s celebration.</p>
<p>“We’ll be back bigger and better than ever next year,” he said.</p>
<p>“That is unless ‘COVID-20’ hits the scene.”
