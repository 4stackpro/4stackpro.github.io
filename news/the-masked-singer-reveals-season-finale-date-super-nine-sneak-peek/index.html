The Masked Singer is entering the homestretch — and soon, you’ll be able to play along at home, too.</p>
<p>Fox’s singing competition returns this Wednesday, April 1 at 8/7c with a special two-hour episode that unveils the “Super Nine,” aka Season 3’s nine finalists from all three qualifying groups. In the above sneak peek, the Super Nine — including Banana, Frog, Astronaut and more — team up for a group rendition of the Jackson 5 classic “ABC,” only with Masked Singer-themed lyrics: “We must sing for that masked trophy, yeah!”</p>
<p>And take note of those captions at the bottom: The Masked Singer will be offering up its first-ever sing-along special on Wednesday, April 15 at 8 pm, with a round-up of Season 3’s best performances so far with the lyrics shown on-screen, so you can croon along as you watch.</p>
<p>Plus, the Season 3 finale, with the top three singing celebs getting unmasked, is now set to air Wednesday, May 27 at 8 pm, Fox confirms. Got a pretty good idea who’s hiding under those masks? Check out our latest Season 3 guesses in the attached gallery, with all relevant clues included, and see if we’re on the same page.</p>
<p>Press PLAY above for a sneak peek at the Super Nine, and then hit the comments and tell us: Who’s your favorite Season 3 contestant? And who’s the celeb underneath that mask?

<h3 id="photos-the-masked-singer-season-3-episode-10-clues-and-guesses">[PHOTOS] ‘The Masked Singer’ Season 3, Episode 10: Clues and Guesses</h3>
<p><img src="https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/the-masked-singer-season-3-episode-10-spoilers-clues-guesses.jpg?w=1024" alt="img">
This week, The Masked Singer will bring the Super Nine together for the very first time in Season 3. And you know what that means: Time to get your guesses in order.</p>
<p>Last week’s episode saw the departure of T-Rex, who turned out to be Dance Moms alum/YouTube star JoJo Siwa. (Read a recap.) This Wednesday’s double installment of the reality singing competition (Fox, 8/7c) will showcase the finalists from Groups A, B and C — aka Banana, Turtle, Kangaroo, White Tiger, Kitty, Frog, Night Angel, Astronaut and Rhino — as they duke it out to stay in the running for the Golden Mask. But if you’re worried that the competition will get pared down too quickly for your tastes, fear not: The evening will feature only one elimination, just like most other weeks.</p>
<p>So ahead of the supersized Episode 10, it’s time to closely look at who’s left and try to discern who’s who. We’ve pulled together a large number of clues from the Masked Singer episodes that have already aired. The ultimate goal: Guess who’s beneath those costumes before they’re gone from the show.</p>
<p>All season long, we’ll update the gallery at right (click here for direct access) with information gleaned from the current week’s show, and we’ll add our (and some of your) thoughts about who’s beneath the costumes. So go ahead and click through, then make sure to log your thoughts, theories and evolving guesses in the comments section!

<p>The Challenge</p>
<p>HOW/WHEN &amp; WHERE TO WATCH: 8 p.m. on MTV</p>
<p>Season Premiere</p>
<p>For The Challenge’s 35th season, TJ Lavin is bringing the crazy. After last season’s disappointing final performance, the host of MTV’s long running reality competition series has instated a new twist that all but guarantees that fans won’t get a repeat of Paulie and Cara Maria’s ironfisted manipulations of War of the Worlds 2 because now, players must win an elimination in order to qualify for the Total Madness final. Returning champion CT put it best: “My entire Challenge career has revolved around avoiding elimination and now you have to go in… it was just a mindf—.” Let the madness begin. —Sydney Bucksbaum</p>

<p>The Masked Singer</p>
<p>HOW/WHEN &amp; WHERE TO WATCH: 8 p.m. on Fox</p>
<p>Tonight, we discover that Turtle might be… Chris Evans?? At least that’s what Jenny McCarthy thinks, and well, the panelists don’t have a great track record (not guessing Lil Wayne correctly will haunt Robin Thicke forever). It’ll be the first time that contestants from the three groups come together for the Super Nine and one singer will be unmasked in the special two-hour episode. What better way to forget about reality than hunkering down to judge B-lists celebrities’ singing, laugh at the crazy audience reactions, and make wild guesses like Chris Evans being the Turtle. We can’t wait. —Rachel Yang</p>

<p>Series Finale</p>
<p>Worlds will live and die in the whimsical-as-hell fantasy show’s series finale, which sees Eliot (Hale Appleman) and the gang endeavor to not only save the people of Fillory from the planet’s destruction but also use the World Seed to create an entirely new planet for the refugees. According to co-showrunner Sera Gamble, who wrote the ender with co-showrunner Henry Alonso Myers, “There’s some cool s—t that blows up for sure,” but in the end, the hour is a tribute to the unbreakable bonds these characters have forged over the years. “When I realized it was so much about that they are now really this tribe together, I realized it didn’t matter if we tied every plot bit up because you know that they will fight for each other,” says Gamble. “For me, that’s the satisfying discovery of all of season 5, really. This has been a season that’s about these characters in different configurations realizing how much they rely on each other and how important that is.” —Chancellor Agard</p>

<p>HOW/WHEN &amp; WHERE TO WATCH: Streaming on Netflix</p>
<p>Season Premiere</p>
<p>What’s in store for season 4 of Netflix’s first hit reality competition show? “Nobody has learned to bake. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m giving anything away by saying that,” host Nicole Byer jokes to EW. With this new batch of episodes comes classic baking fails like not greasing the cake pans, as well as new ones like overdosing on flavored extract. Among the themes of each of the eight episodes are literature, the jungle, and the &rsquo;90s, with guest judges including actor Adam Scott and Olympic gold medalist Gabby Douglas hilariously suffering through a tasting of disastrous desserts from amateur home bakers who have the best of intentions. —Marcus Jones</p>
