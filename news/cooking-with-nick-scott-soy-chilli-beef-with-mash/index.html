Dubai chefs Nick Alvis and Scott Price whip up this comforting dish for What’s On…</p>
<p>In their first video masterclass for What’s On, Dubai cheffing duo Nick and Scott share a flavour-packed recipe for soy-braised beef with mashed potatoes.</p>
<p>Follow along with the video here, and find the complete recipe and shopping list below.</p>
<p>Soy &amp; chilli beef recipe</p>
<p>Serves 2, cooking time 2 hours</p>
<p>500g beef topside</p>
<p>1 tablespoon seasoned corn flour</p>
<p>50ml sesame oil</p>
<p>50ml pomace oil</p>
<p>1 large red onion, sliced</p>
<p>1 thumbs-sized piece ginger, minced</p>
<p>3 garlic cloves, minced</p>
<p>1 stick lemongrass, smashed with the back of a knife</p>
<p>2 red or green chillies, seeds removed, chopped</p>
<p>5 cloves</p>
<p>5 star anise</p>
<p>2 bay leaves</p>
<p>100g tomato paste</p>
<p>50ml honey</p>
<p>200ml soy sauce</p>
<p>50ml any vinegar</p>
<p>Water to cover</p>
<p>½ bunch coriander, chopped</p>
<p>1 bunch spring onions, sliced</p>
<p>Method</p>
<p>Dice the topside into 2-3cm cubes and coat in the corn flour. Preheat a deep saucepan and add the oils. When lightly smoking, carefully place the meat into the oils and brown until sides are crispy, then remove. In the oil, add the onions and cook until golden, add the ginger, garlic, lemongrass, chilli and spices, then add tomato paste and deglaze with honey, soy and then with vinegar. Cook out until a thick paste, then return the beef and cover with water and a cartouche (a circle of baking paper). Bring the boil and lower to a gentle simmer for 2 hours. Serve with mashed potatoes and garnish with coriander and spring onion.</p>
<p>Mashed potatoes</p>
<p>500g maris pipers or the Egyptian potatoes in the nets</p>
<p>150g milk</p>
<p>150g cream</p>
<p>Salt</p>
<p>Method</p>
<p>Peel the potatoes, cut into even-sized pieces and place into a deep saucepan of salted water. Bring to the boil and simmer until a knife can easily go through the middle of a potato and easily slide out. Turn off the heat and leave in the water for 5 minutes. In another small saucepan, warm the milk and cream. Drain the potatoes and return to the pan on to a low heat. With a spatula break down the potatoes and beat until smooth. Gradually add the milk and cream – you may not need it all, so don’t add all at once. Check the seasoning, adding more salt to taste.</p>

<h3 id="50-years-later-robert-altmans-mash-is-still-unforgettable">50 Years Later, Robert Altman’s ‘MASH’ Is Still Unforgettable</h3>
<p><img src="https://observer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/GettyImages-120357907.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip" alt="img">
Keeping Watch is a new, semi-regular column on streaming TV and movies.</p>
<p>You remember the 4077th? Hawkeye, Radar, Trapper John, Henry and Hot Lips?</p>
<p>These days, mentioning MASH gets you an almost uniform response: “Binged it on Netflix.” Yet it’s the movie, and not the long-running TV series that it spawned, that’s arguably more culturally significant. MASH was arguably the earliest “indie” film made inside the studio system, a piece of entertainment still side-splittingly funny, despite its dated perspective. Altman’s movie was a blockbuster back when those mattered, a critical smash back when that meant something, too, and changed the culture.</p>
<p>However, watching it in 2020, over 50 years after its wide release, it’s at best a black comedy about battle-scarred machismo or, at worst, patently offensive. Let’s dive into what made this film terrific, problematic and unforgettable.</p>
<p>“If a man isn’t a man anymore, what’s he got left?”</p>
<p>–Capt. Walter Kosciuszko “The Painless Pole” Waldowski, DDS</p>
<p>M<em>A</em>S*H (as it’s listed on the poster, t-shirts and tie-ins) was never meant to be a scholarly work. It was supposed to be the second feature at the American drive-in, the late-night, unserious, low-budget flick that might turn a small profit from the hippie crowd. The middle child of three 20th Century Fox war movies that year, MASH had a misfit B-list director, Robert Altman, and an ensemble cast of unknowns pulled from a San Francisco theater troupe.</p>
<p>Stars Donald Sutherland and Elliot Gould, nobodies soon to become A-listers, complained to studio bosses that Altman told the actors to talk over one another, kept his angles wide and his lenses fogged, and hid both the cameras and microphones across the set. (Only Gould, who went on to make four more films with Altman, was forgiven for the complaints because, Altman later said, the actor ultimately apologized.)</p>
<p>Shocking everyone, MASH became the most successful comedy of 1970, one of the most profitable properties of the decade for Fox and the basis for one of the top-rated TV shows of the ’70s and ’80s. So, how did MASH end up forgotten? Perhaps it was overshadowed by the far less edgy series or became almost instantly outdated in the wake of the Equal Rights Amendment. (It certainly isn’t the ideal family movie night in the era of #CancelCulture and #MeToo, what with its comical treatment of sexual harassment and what would be recognized as revenge porn today.)</p>
<p>“Very quickly, I realized that it was loathsome to the women characters,” says Gina Arnold, professor of Rhetoric and Media Studies at the University of San Francisco, says of a recent rewatch. “In those days, being carelessly loathsome to women and depicting scenes of female humiliation was so commonplace that no one, Robert Altman or otherwise, noticed it.”</p>
<p>She adds: “He was probably just staying true to the book, but yuck.”</p>
<p>“This isn’t a hospital, it’s an insane asylum.”</p>
<p>–Major Margaret “Hot Lips” Houlihan</p>
<p>Though, under Altman’s direction, the film is an ensemble piece, Ring Lardner Jr.’s Oscar-winning script is undoubtedly a vehicle for two distinctly male leads in every sense.</p>
<p>Trapper John and “Hawkeye” Pierce (played by Gould and Sutherland, respectively) are philandering, boozing, trash-talking, gridiron-glory-reliving, anti-establishment surgeons stationed near the Korean front. Gen Z’ers watching today will ache with jealousy over the lives of these antiheroes—they work long hours and are considered untouchable, unassailable in their positions due to their specialized skills. They aren’t even properly written up by their superior officer, “Henry.” (That’s how the two insubordinate officers affectionately address Lt. Col. Blake, played by Second City co-founder Roger Bowen.) Even when higher ups pressure him to discipline the boys, Henry doesn’t throw a fit and instead rolls over immediately, allowing our miscreant heroes to continue their shenanigans unchecked.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hawkeye and Trapper John drug Ho-Jon, the Korean boy—so he won’t be drafted. A woman major is given “Hot Lips” as a nickname and “earns” her humiliation—the doctors pull the walls of her shower down while she’s inside—for being a threat to sanity and “army morale.” An officer they blackmail with staged photos of a prostitute was a tyrant literally in their way during an operation to save a congressman’s son. These docs can do no wrong, and for them revenge is geared toward what their tormentors would find most upsetting.</p>
<p>Defenders of the film point out that most of their targets, including the lampooned nurses and Korean staffer, turn out just fine, as shaped by Altman and Lardner. (Though in a 2006 NPR interview, Gould quoted Lardner as accosting him at a screening: “There’s not a word that I wrote on screen.”)</p>
<p>“I’m Dr. Jekyll, actually. This is my friend, Mr. Hyde.”</p>
<p>–Capt. Benjamin Franklin “Hawkeye” Pierce Jr.</p>
<p>MASH would be on the front lines of the culture wars today. Hot Lips, in what may be the movie’s most controversial move, ultimately comes around toward the doctors harassing her. She shacks up with third-wheel doc Capt. Forrest and sits on his lap, smirking conspiratorially, while the boys drink and play cards till dawn. Meanwhile, philandering Hawkeye convinces a married nurse (nickname: “Dish”) he’s been romancing to sleep with a despondent dentist so that the dentist will not kill himself. She obliges and, shaking her head the next day, chuckles to herself about the whole thing. Today, Hawkeye would undoubtedly be canceled.</p>
<p>In MASH, says Arnold, “Women did men’s bidding, or else didn’t, or were, like Hot Lips, bossy or powerful and were called bitches and punished for it.”</p>
<p>And it’s not just the women who have a rough time of it, demo-wise. There’s also a football player called “Spearchucker,” a slur for people of African descent. The character, brought in as a ringer for the competition between rival staff that serves as the film’s half-hearted climax, tells a nurse he got his nickname because he “used to throw the javelin,” but the line seems thrown in there so Altman can say: “See? I’m not a racist?” (The novel’s author, for the record, created the character.)</p>
<p>“The game of life is hard to play / I’m gonna lose it anyway”</p>
<p>–From “Suicide Is Painless,” the theme song of the film and series, a #2 hit single (music by Johnny Mandel and lyrics by Mike Altman, Robert’s then-14-year-old son)</p>
<p>In his original, four-star review of the film, Roger Ebert wrote: “One of the reasons ‘MASH’ is so funny is that it’s so desperate. [W]hen they are at last out of the operating tent, [the characters] devote their lives to remaining sane. The way they do that, in ‘MASH,’ is to be almost metaphysically cruel. There is something about war that inspires practical jokes and the heroes… are inspired and utterly heartless.”</p>
<p>But, he notes: “If the surgeons didn’t have to face the daily list of maimed and mutilated bodies, none of the rest of their lives would make any sense.”</p>
<p>In Altman’s view, the battle of the sexes is merely thematic anchoring for Altman’s commentary on another war: Vietnam. As you may imagine, Altman was against the war in Southeast Asia and wasn’t allowed to shift the setting to the present day or expressly comment on it on screen. In his original cut, there is no mention of the country that serves as a backdrop for virtually every scene. 20th Century Fox, however, caught on immediately. They forced the director to add a crawl in the opening sequence, the first word of which is “Korea” and which provides unnecessary, abrupt and ultimately cringeworthy exposition.</p>
<p>But if you want to know that Altman really thought of MASH’s anti-women bent, consider that, following the film’s success, he next used his power to make Brewster McCloud and McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller inside of a year, stories ultimately anchored by feminist messages.</p>
<p>And while he would go on to create some questionable hysterical-women-driven comedies and bro-y fare, note that the toxic masculinity in California’s Split leads to the breakup of its characters’ platonic and romantic relationships and the 3 Women of that film’s title come together to defeat their patriarchal tormentor, or that the Philip Marlowe character in The Long Goodbye, as scripted by Leigh Brackett, has stronger feminist principles than anyone in many women-driven comedies today.</p>
<p>“Finally caught up with us, huh?”</p>
<p>–Capt. John Francis Xavier “Trapper John” McIntyre</p>
<p>Fifty years later, MASH’s influence is undeniable. It led to Animal House, The Longest Yard, Porky’s, even, in a way, The Deer Hunter and the fourth-wall-cracking Blazing Saddles and Monty Python and the Holy Grail. It caused rival Catch-22 to tank at the box office—who needed two slapstick war adaptations?—Altman’s final revenge on the studios for underestimating him.</p>
<p>The same month MASH received a wide release, Miles Davis put out Bitches Brew, recently hailed as his “greatest album,” dropping a bomb on the staid jazz community, from which it never recovered. Two years after Altman’s MASH hit the movie theaters, the TV adaptation debuted on CBS, followed by the spinoff Trapper John, M.D. in 1979—all extensions of the story of the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital unit. The series finale of MASH, “Goodbye, Farewell and Amen,” is still the highest-rated TV episode in history in shares, ratings and viewership totals. But in the three decades and change since Trapper ended, the entire property has seemingly vanished, and the franchise as a whole feels forgotten. Are we content to let it die?</p>
<p>MASH the film and MASH the show are available to stream on Hulu.

<h3 id="取代原本office-365微軟揭曉全新面向消費市場的microsoft-365訂閱式服務">取代原本Office 365，微軟揭曉全新面向消費市場的Microsoft 365訂閱式服務</h3>
<p><img src="https://secureservercdn.net/198.71.233.7/80d.fc3.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/mashdigi_capture-2020-03-30-%E4%B8%8B%E5%8D%8811.05.10-1.jpg?time=1585887274" alt="img">
如先前市場傳聞，微軟終於針對一般消費市場推出Microsoft 365訂閱式服務，其中將適用於個人或家庭使用需求，並且包含Office、OneDrive與Outlook服務功能，另外更整合全新家庭安全，以及針對消費市場打造的Microsoft Teams服務。</p>
<p>從內容來看，此次更新面向消費市場打造，並且預計在今年4月21日正式上線的Microsoft 365訂閱式服務，基本上將會取代原本的個人版Office 365，以及家用版Office 365，並且額外提供更多加值服務，例如讓使用者能透過Microsoft Teams服務與其他人進行線上協作，或是透過家庭安全功能確認家庭成員在線上活動狀況。</p>
<p>相比過去面向商用需求提供的Microsoft 365訂閱式服務，微軟此次針對消費市場打造的Microsoft 365訂閱式服務，可視為過往針對一般個人版或家用版Office 365「升級版本」，讓一般使用者或家庭用戶能透過按月，或是按年訂閱使用方式，分別獲得包含Word、Excel與PowerPoint功能的Office 365服務，更包含OneDrive與Outlook在內服務。</p>
<p>不過，並未像先前市場傳聞額外包含Windows 10作業系統訂閱使用部分，而是讓原本面向消費市場的Office 365服務有更多加值內容。</p>
<p>訂閱費用部分，個人版同樣以每月7美元或一年70美元價格計費，而最多6人同時使用的家用版費用，則是每月10美元或一年100美元，基本上與原本針對消費市場提供的Office 365計費方式相同，但是額外增加可確認家人手機使用狀況，或是在各個裝置活躍狀態，並且可使用Microsoft Teams線上協作服務。</p>
<p>至於額外提供每人可使用1TB儲存容量的OneDrive空間額度，以及每月提供免費60分鐘Skype電話撥打的優惠，基本上則是沒有改變。</p>
<p>隨著面向消費市場的Microsoft 365訂閱式服務推出，微軟同時也針對Office功能進行升級，其中包含在PowerPoint簡報模式中加入即時監控講者音調，並且適時建議調整講解速度，同時在編輯簡報或文件內容時也會提供合適字句建議，讓使用者撰寫內容可以有更多參考想法，更能避免寫錯字的情況發生，另外也能比對撰寫內容是否與其他內容過於相似。</p>
<p>此次更新也加入由Getty images授權提供使用的8000組影像與175組影片內容，以及超過200種模版內容，讓使用者能直接用於PowerPoint或Excel內容製作。</p>
<p>而在新版Microsoft Edge瀏覽器中，更是加入可同時讓Google Chrome瀏覽器使用的擴充程式「Microsoft Editor」，其中支援20種語言，並且能以人工智慧技術協助使用者糾正錯字、建議合適字句等操作，適用於Word及Outlook網頁版，同時也能對應Gmail等網頁服務使用，另外也加入更多網頁瀏覽安全機制，以及可讓使用者更方便管理的個人瀏覽網頁書籤功能。</p>
<p>Microsoft 365個人版、家用版使用差異：</p>
