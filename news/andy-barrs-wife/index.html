<p>Posted Tuesday, June 16, 2020 9:50 pm</p>
<p>LEXINGTON, Ky. (KT) - Carol Leavell Barr, the wife of U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, passed away suddenly Tuesday at the family home in Lexington.</p>
<p>“During this tragic time, we respectfully ask for privacy for Congressman Barr and his family to grieve Mrs. Barr being called home to heaven,&rdquo; a statement released from Barr&rsquo;s office said Tuesday night. She was 39.</p>
<p>According to the release, Barr &ldquo;may release a more detailed statement at a later date, but right now is solely focused on being a father to his two beautiful daughters.”</p>
<p>Barr&rsquo;s wife, Carol, leaves behind daughters Eleanor and Mary Clay Barr. Andy Barr is running for re-election in Tuesday&rsquo;s primary.</p>
<p>The Barrs were married in 2008.</p>
<p>Mac Brown, the chairman of the Republican Party of Kentucky, said “our hearts go out to the Barr family at this tragic news.</p>
<p>“While there are no words that can heal the pain of losing a loved one, we pray together that God will comfort Congressman Andy Barr, their daughters, and the entire family through this very difficult time,” Brown said.</p>
<p>Gov. Andy Beshear expressed condolences on Twitter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Britainy and I are heartbroken for U.S. Rep. Andy Barr and his family tonight at the sad news of the unexpected passing of the congressman&rsquo;s wife, Carol. We are praying for the Barr family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also offered words of comfort to the Barr family.

<h3 id="andrew-mccarthy-barrs-obama-biden-remarks--ag-is-making-this-important-point">&ldquo;Andrew McCarthy: Barr&rsquo;s Obama-Biden remarks – AG is making this important point&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/694940094001/0a4a5ccb-e26c-4f42-8e89-89ac831139d3/48385b9e-b186-4fe8-8035-af84cb255c39/1280x720/match/image.jpg" alt="img">
Attorney General William Barr’s remarks on Monday, signaling that the Justice Department anticipates no criminal charges against former President Obama and former Vice President Biden, should come as a surprise to no one (certainly, ahem, to no one who read &ldquo;Ball of Collusion&rdquo;).</p>
<p>As I noted less than a month ago, the AG observed during a wide-ranging interview with Hugh Hewitt that the subjects of the Durham investigation are not candidates for public office; thus, they were not affected by a Justice Department guideline against bringing charges close to Election Day.</p>
<p>DOUG SCHOEN: FLYNN CASE – WRONGDOING ON BOTH SIDES. HERE&rsquo;S WHAT JUDGE SHOULD DO NOW</p>
<p>By then, Biden was already the putative Democratic presidential nominee. Obviously, if serious consideration were being given to an indictment of Biden, Barr would not have made the point about the guideline.</p>
<p>To be sure, the media reporting will portray Barr’s latest comments as indicative of a rift between the AG and President Trump, whose latest “Obamagate” rhetoric frames Obama-era investigative abuses as “crime.”</p>
<p>CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER</p>
<p>Barr’s remarks will also be applauded as an “exoneration” of Obama officials — consistent with the media approach that portrays Democrats as innocent victims of right-wing smears if they manage to evade indictment, while a “guilty until proved innocent beyond any doubt” standard is applied to Republicans.</p>
<p>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</p>
<p>Barr’s comments will feature in the “nothing to see here” storyline, the press’s counter to stunning revelations about the baselessness of the Russia collusion narrative willfully peddled by Democrats, and the exploitation of counterintelligence powers — powers that are supposed to protect us from jihadists and hostile regimes — for partisan political purposes.</p>
<p>To the contrary, my sense is that the AG believes there is plenty to see and be outraged about. It simply may not be criminal.</p>

<p><img src="https://1338206185.rsc.cdn77.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/grand-slam-of-darts-andy-fordham_3374674.jpg" alt="img">
Andy Fordham spoke recently about making a full recovery from a blockage in his bowels in which he said he is probably about 90 percent better, he also discussed the current state of the BDO.</p>
<p>The BDO which saw the World Championship and World Masters go into disarray and as a result Des Jacklin resigned only to return a month later.</p>
<p>For Fordham, as a former World Champion with the organisation, he is sad to see the current state of proceedings but thought the Indigo was the right move.</p>
<p>“It breaks my heart the way it’s gone. It’s where it all started, it needed to move forward. They never got the right person in to do it, you did need a Barry Hearn,” said Fordham on Winmau TV in conversation with Phill Barrs.</p>
<p>“The Indigo is a great venue, it’s up to date. Unfortunately I mean as much as I love playing at Lakeside and if I had the opportunity I’d love to play there again. The Indigo I think it’s that step forward that sometimes you need to do.”</p>
<p>He also spoke about Jacklin returning; as well as the issues with the prize money and admitted himself that if he didn’t know what he was playing for, he would be in two minds also.</p>
<p>“It shows just the way the BDO is going. I like Des, I don’t think he’s a bad person but I mean after what happened with the World Championship, how do you do it again.”</p>
<p>He continued: “I don’t understand it, I can’t get my head round it.”</p>
<p>“I said to Jenny (his wife) I don’t think I’d play. You signed a contract stating what you are playing for and then to be told a couple of days before. It’s wrong you can’t do that.”</p>

Andy Fordham is close to making a full recovery after previously being hospitalised in late February due to severe abdominal pain and as a result, blockage in his bowels.</p>
<p>Fordham said he is ’90 percent’ better and that he is losing weight and starting to feel good again extending to even playing some darts despite admitting himself that he may not ever be back to tournament level again.</p>
<p>“I’m probably about 90 percent better now. It was a blocked bowel and there was nothing coming out at all and when it finally started to go, it weren’t nice. The people in the hospital are just unbelievable, you can’t praise them enough,” said Fordham on Winmau TV in conversation with Phill Barrs.</p>
<p>“I think I’m always going to have a couple of issues but compared to what I was, I feel so much better. I lost loads of weight, but I’ve learnt from last time. I’ve been moving around a lot more, I’ve had a couple of goes on the dartboard. It’s slowly picking up.</p>
<p>I won’t say I will be getting back to tournament standard but if you don’t try you don’t know.”</p>
<p>Return</p>
<p>While Fordham admits he may never return to tournament level, he told a story of how he nearly made Lakeside a few years ago and that he does have the fight and desire knowing that game is there.</p>
<p>“I was going a few years back, I think it was Bridlington. It was the British Open on the stage, I beat Ted Hankey. Then I played Richard Veenstra and I missed three darts at double 20 and when I say I missed them, all three darts were on the wire.</p>
<p>Then he beat me 4-3, I come off and I got told if I would have hit one of those doubles I would have qualified for the Lakeside. It proves it’s there, it’s just got to keep fighting to get it back again.”</p>

<h3 id="act-chief-minister-andrew-barr-marries-his-partner-anthony-toms-20-years-after-they-met">&ldquo;ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr marries his partner, Anthony Toms, 20 years after they met&rdquo;</h3>

Australia&rsquo;s first openly gay government leader, ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr, has married his long-term partner Anthony Toms.</p>
<p>Key points: Mr Barr and Mr Toms met 20 years ago at a gay and lesbian festival in Canberra</p>
<p>Mr Barr and Mr Toms met 20 years ago at a gay and lesbian festival in Canberra The ACT Government twice passed laws to give same-sex couples the rights of married couples, but the legislation was overturned</p>
<p>The ACT Government twice passed laws to give same-sex couples the rights of married couples, but the legislation was overturned The Federal Parliament eventually legislated to allow same-sex marriage two years ago</p>
<p>The &ldquo;small family&rdquo; celebration was held Wednesday at the historic Longworth House in Newcastle, where Mr Toms, a tailor and fashion designer, is from.</p>
<p>In a social media post this morning, Mr Barr thanked the Australians who voted &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in the 2017 marriage-law survey, which led to the Federal Parliament legislating to allow same-sex couples to marry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anthony and I married yesterday on our 20th anniversary and the 10th anniversary of our ACT civil partnership,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>Loading&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a lovely day and want to thank the 7.8 million Australians (and especially the 175,000 Canberrans) who voted yes to marriage equality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Barr and Mr Toms first met at a gay and lesbian festival in Canberra, and celebrated their civil partnership in 2009 with a ceremony at the National Library of Australia.</p>
<p>Struggle for marriage rights</p>
<p>The wedding was also a culmination of the ACT Labor Party&rsquo;s battle to give same-sex couples the same rights as married couples.</p>
<p>The ACT Government, which Mr Barr now leads, twice passed legislation to do this — first to allow &ldquo;civil unions&rdquo; in 2006 and then to allow same-sex marriage in 2013 — but Commonwealth intervention killed off both of the laws.</p>
<p>On the day Mr Barr became Chief Minister in 2014, he said to the Legislative Assembly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anthony: I love you and I look forward to the day when we can legally marry in this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The year before, when the Assembly passed its short-lived marriage laws, Mr Barr wept as he reflected on the struggle for equal rights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today, the sacrifice, the suffering, the struggle, the tireless exertions and passionate concern of gay and lesbian Canberrans, their parents and their families find a voice and find a champion in this Assembly … I said I would not cry this time,&rdquo; he said through tears.

<p>Cork GAA had to mourn the passing of club stalwarts during shutdown</p>
<p>THERE is always great sadness in a club and further afield when a great club person is called to their eternal reward.</p>
<p>Club personnel are the bedrock of the association, those unsung heroes who are relentless in their pursuit of doing things better for the unit that they are attached to.</p>
<p>The past week has not been a good one on that front with the passing of Denis Owens from St Nicholas and Dick Doocey from Killeagh.</p>
<p>Add in the death of Cloyne’s Paddy Ring last Sunday, a nephew of the great man himself from the same village, and that further increases the sorrow of the GAA family on Leeside and beyond.</p>
<p>Paddy won All-Ireland medals with Cork at minor and U21 level, playing on three consecutive Cork minor teams in 1966, 1967 and 1968, winning his All-Ireland in ’67 in a team that was captained by Pat Moylan.</p>
<p>While still a minor in 1968 he was elevated into the U21 set-up and played a prominent role in the All-Ireland victory of that year and in 1970 too when the title was regained in a team captained by Paddy Hegarty.</p>
<p>To be a minor and U21 player on the county team in the same year spoke volumes for his ability.</p>
<p>In that same year of 1968, he was on a formidable Imokilly team that went all the way to the county final only to be beaten by an equally formidable ’Barrs team.</p>
<p>That was some achievement by the young Cloyne man, to get himself on to that Imokilly team, a team that contained some of the best hurlers in the county at the time.</p>
<p>Cloyne won a great Cork County IHC title with Paddy very prominent in 1970, a team that contained Donal Clifford, one of the greatest under-age players the county has ever produced.</p>
<p>He transferred to the Glen subsequently, following in the footsteps of his legendary uncle and whilst he did not win a senior title with the great Blackpool club, he made his own impact out there.</p>
<p>He came from a family steeped in the great traditions of Cork GAA, his late father Willie John a fine player and coach of distinction himself.</p>
<p>His brother Willie was a long-serving and very successful East Cork Board Divisional Secretary and subsequently, a well-respected officer of the Cork County Board and he is still heavily involved in GAA affairs.</p>
<p>In a message on the Cloyne GAA website last Sunday, it simply stated that Paddy Ring was one of our greatest players and it was a case of getting the ball to Paddy during his tenure in that great club jersey.</p>
<p>Paudie O&rsquo;Sullivan, Cloyne, in action against Youghal. The East Cork club last week lost a similarly gifted forward, Paddy Ring, who also hurled for the Glen. Picture: Larry Cummins.</p>
<p>Dick Doocey was a great Killeagh club man and his passing was deeply felt in the club and beyond last weekend.</p>
<p>He was one of those people whose worth to a club could never be measured.</p>
<p>In 1967 Killeagh won their first East Cork JHC and Dick was player/coach of that team. It was the first step on the journey that today has the club competing at senior level, well established on and off the field.</p>
<p>They have one of the finest complexes in the county as well and Dick was a key figure in the purchase of the field back in the ’70s.</p>
<p>Of course, prior to all that he won a Waterford SHC with Tourin.</p>
<p>Killeagh has lost a great club man, his passing coming shortly after the death of another club great Sean Murphy. People of that calibre are irreplaceable.</p>
<p>John Browne, Kanturk, closes in on Daniel Walsh, Killeagh. The late Dick Doocey was a passionate Killeagh man to the end. Picture: Jim Coughlan.</p>
<p>The sorrow in St Nick’s was equally great with the passing last weekend too of Denis Owens, the club president and a club man of the highest calibre.</p>
<p>He served that great club with great distinction in various roles as a player and administrator through the years.</p>
<p>He was a Cork minor football captain in 1946 and was a selector on the fine St Nick’s side of 1965 and ’66 when the Andy Scannell Cup visited Blackpool twice and subsequently when they won the Munster Club title.</p>
<p>He was a Cork selector in 1967 when they lost the All-Ireland to Meath and he served the Blackpool club with distinction as a County Board delegate.</p>
<p>He was a former secretary of the club as well as being in the chair and was one of the most respected people in the Cork GAA family.</p>
<p>St Nick’s secretary, Finbarr McCarthy described him as an absolute gentleman.</p>
<p>“He certainly was, so well respected everywhere. He’s a huge loss to our club but first and foremost to his family. He gave fantastic service to St Nick’s and he will not be forgotten.”</p>
<p>Words that will certainly be echoed by many across the Cork GAA landscape.</p>
<p>All three of the aforementioned people were great clubmen, on and off the field. And that is what makes the association what it is today and it’s in the club where it all begins and ends.</p>
<p>Cork GAA is the poorer for their passing.</p>
<p>May they rest in peace.
