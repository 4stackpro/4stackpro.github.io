<p>Comedian Mulamwa has hung up his boots in the comedy industry s=citing online bullying as his main reason.</p>
<p>In a post that has been widely shared online, Mulamwa revealed that the industry is not what he expected and that social media has subjected him to bullying on several occasions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt an easy decision to make, I‚Äôm sorry guys. What was to make me happy has made me sadder. More enemies than friends, too much negativity and trolls. I wasn‚Äôt here for fame and bad blood but for fun. Shukran sana kwa the support from the fans and everyone else who made it a success.To those who always wished the worst for me I hope y‚Äôall happy now, the stage is all yours. my prayer is that no one else goes through the same again.‚Äù He wrote</p>
<p>Mulamwa further revealed that his wife Carol Sonnie had a miscarriage at three months as a result of cyberbullying.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI once posted @carrol_sonie while in a hospital bed, we had just lost our baby at 3 months following stress after being trolled online. I have never been the same since then.‚Äù He said</p>
<p>The distraught comedian apologized to his fans and those who look up to him adding that he will now concentrate on advertisements.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPole sana pia for all who looked up to me especially the kids, I have failed you üòî, but keep your heads up. We shall still meet on different entertainment platforms, social media ADS and product campaigns too. GOD BLESS. Asanteni‚Äù he added

<h3 id="comedians-team-up-to-support-mulamwa-hours-after-he-ditched-career">Comedians team up to support Mulamwa hours after he ditched career</h3>
<p><img src="https://netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/68162a69527ed46b.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mulamwah announced on Monday, April 13, night that he was ditching comedy for good due to unending trolls</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jalang&rsquo;o asked him not to listen to haters and get back to the game because all successful people have critics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comedian YY also defended Mulamwah holding that no comedian owes any fans anything</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Kenyan comedians Jalang&rsquo;o and YY have come out to defend fellow comedian Mulamwah who had been bullied out of the industry by mean fans.</p>
<p>The two comedians encouraged Mulamwah and encouraged him to keep fighting as nothing is easy.</p>

<p>READ ALSO: YouTuber This Is Ess shuts down rumours she is lesbian</p>
<p>In an Instagram video posted by Jalas on his account, the revered comedian told Mulamwah he can never make everyone happy and that haters are part and parcel of the journey to celebriville.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;My boy, wake up tomorrow go buy another costume and keep doing your work. You cannot make everyone happy. Even Jesus was crucified. I know sometimes it really hurts but truth is no one has ever made it without haters. Nowadays we even ask if everything is okay when we see no haters. Harden up son. Nobody said it will be easy. Do not go anywhere. Lets do this,&rsquo;&rsquo; Jalang&rsquo;o said.</p>
<p>Jalang&rsquo;o&rsquo;s words were echoed by YY in his YouTube video through which he urged Mulamwah not to mind people and keep doing what he does best, comedy.</p>
<p>READ ALSO: US-based Kenyan Rev Evans Kariuki apologises for being a stubborn child after babysitting his kids</p>
<p>YY harshly condemned Kenyan fans holding they are very entitled and that they demand too much and offer so little.</p>
<p>According to YY, no comedian owes any fan anything therefore people should desist from attacking people they do not even know on a personal level on social media.</p>
<p>YY said it was not fair for people who were supposed to support you to troll and pull you down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;I am actually here because of what Mulamwa has posted. It is very sad when it gets to that point. Because the people who are supposed to support him are weighing him down, bringing him down, trolling him and the wife. I don&rsquo;t understand why people hate on people they have not even met. There are disrespectful fans out here, people who are so entitled. Comedians do not owe fans anything,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>READ ALSO: Afisa wa polisi amiminiwa risasi na genge la wahalifu lililokuwa linasafirisha bangi</p>
<p>YY stressed that comedians are also human beings with emotions and should be treated as such.</p>
<p>Jalang&rsquo;o and YY&rsquo;s defense came just hours after Mulamwah publicly announced he had ditched comedy for good.</p>
<p>In a tweet seen by TUKO.co.ke, Mulamwah said he was tired of the trolls who were bullying him and his wife on end.</p>
<p>Mulamwa even burnt his signature costume to prove indeed it was all over.</p>
