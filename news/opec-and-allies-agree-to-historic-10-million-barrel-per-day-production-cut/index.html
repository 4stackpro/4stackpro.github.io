OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, on Thursday agreed to historic production cuts that will take 10 million barrels per day offline as the coronavirus pandemic saps demand for crude. The agreement came as the oil-producing nations held an extraordinary meeting to discuss production policy amid falling oil prices.</p>
<p>The group will cut 10 million barrels per day in May and June, 8 million barrels per day from July through the end of the year, and 6 million barrels per day beginning in January 2021 and extending through April 2022, according to Reuters. A final decision is expected on Friday after Mexico objected to its portion of the cuts.</p>
<p>The agreement was not contingent on nations outside of OPEC+ curbing production, which some had suggested might be a stipulation for Saudi Arabia and Russia to scale back production. The group did, however, call on other producers, such as the U.S., to cut production by an additional 5 million barrels per day, according to Reuters.</p>
<p>Despite the record size of the cut, oil prices moved lower on Thursday as investors feared it would still not be enough to combat the unprecedented demand loss from the coronavirus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although 10 million bpd will help the market on the short term to not fill up storage, it is a disappointing development for many, who still realize the size of the oil oversupply,&rdquo; said Rystad Energy&rsquo;s head of oil markets Bjornar Tonhaugen.</p>
<p>U.S. West Texas Intermediate fell 9.29%, or $2.33, to settle at $22.76 per barrel. Earlier in the session, the contract had been up more than 12% trade at a session high of $28.36. International benchmark Brent crude slipped 4.14% to settle at $31.48, after earlier hitting a high of $36.40.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Covid-19 is an unseen beast that seems to be impacting everything in its path,&rdquo; OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said at the meeting. &ldquo;For the oil market, it has completely up-ended market supply and demand fundamentals since we last met on 6 March,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Earlier WTI spiked more than 12% on reports that Saudi Arabia and Russia were discussing cuts that could have taken 20 million barrels per day of global production offline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The market has been underwhelmed by the proposed 10m/bd production cut, perhaps because of early expectations of a massive 20m/bd reduction,&rdquo; said Helima Croft, RBC&rsquo;s global head of commodities research. &ldquo;However we contend that it is crucial to turn off the tap off the tap in the midst of colossal demand crash and bring the price war to a swift conclusion,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>Ahead of the meeting, the Street had been watching for cuts in the 10 million to 15 million barrels per day range after Trump said he had spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and expected them to announce a deal of that size.

<p><img src="https://images.wsj.net/im-165897/social" alt="img">
Oil prices declined Thursday as traders weighed the impact of a potential deal among major exporters to cut production amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The initial verdict: The cuts could be too little too late to match the sharp decline in fuel consumption around the world.</p>
<p>U.S. crude prices, as measured by West Texas Intermediate futures,&hellip;

<h3 id="an-oil-deal-is-still-tricky-prices-could-dip-into-the-teens-if-it-falls-apart-strategist">An oil deal is still &lsquo;tricky,&rsquo; prices could dip into the teens if it falls apart: Strategist</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106481745-1586422861570gettyimages-1153956932.jpeg?v=1586424768" alt="img">
Oil prices could fall under $20 a barrel if the world&rsquo;s producers fail to reach an agreement on reducing output, one strategist told CNBC this week.</p>
<p>OPEC and its allies are set to meet via video conference on Thursday to discuss production cuts. Oil futures rose this week amid hopes of an agreement to lower supply by as much as 10 million to 15 million barrels per day.</p>
<p>U.S. crude futures were up 4.58% to $26.24 in Asia&rsquo;s afternoon trade Thursday, while Brent was up 3.65% to $34.04.</p>
<p>But RBC Capital Markets&rsquo; Helima Croft said there are still issues to be worked out between the producers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be very tricky to get the final deal put together,&rdquo; she warned on &ldquo;Capital Connection&rdquo; on Thursday. &ldquo;A lot is still in play, I think it&rsquo;s still challenging to get a deal across the finish line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even if a deal is reached, however, she said it is unlikely to solve the price situation immediately because of the decline in demand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think this agreement&rsquo;s important to turning off the taps and allowing potential recovery to happen. But we&rsquo;re not going to get a quick rebound in prices in any event, because of the real demand destruction that we&rsquo;re seeing because of the coronavirus.&rdquo;
