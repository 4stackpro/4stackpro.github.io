British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Monday he&rsquo;s &ldquo;in good spirits&rdquo; and is leading the government&rsquo;s efforts to tackle the coronavirus epidemic despite being hospitalized.</p>
<p>Dominic Raab, the U.K.&lsquo;s first secretary of state, said the prime minister had a &ldquo;comfortable night&rdquo; in hospital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was a precautionary step because he continues to have persistent coronavirus symptoms 10 days after first having tested positive for the virus,&rdquo; Raab told reporters at the government&rsquo;s daily press conference Monday. Under British law, Raab would assume responsibilities of running the government if the prime minister becomes unable to.</p>
<p>Earlier Monday, Johnson said he went to hospital on Sunday for &ldquo;routine tests&rdquo; because he was still experiencing coronavirus symptoms 10 days after contracting COVID-19.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in good spirits and keeping in touch with my team, as we work together to fight this virus and keep everyone safe,&rdquo; he tweeted.</p>
<p>The prime minister had been in self-isolation at his flat next door to 10 Downing St. before being admitted to St. Thomas&rsquo; Hospital in London.</p>
<p>In a second tweet, Johnson thanked the National Health Service and urged Brits to stay at home. The U.K. has been on lockdown for over two weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to say thank you to all the brilliant NHS staff taking care of me and others in this difficult time. You are the best of Britain,&rdquo; the prime minister said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay safe everyone, and please remember to stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives.&rdquo;

<h3 id="america-braces-for-a-difficult-week-boris-johnson-is-hospitalized-mondays-coronavirus-news">America braces for a difficult week, Boris Johnson is hospitalized: Monday’s coronavirus news</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ejLQ4hoe60trryZfuSNcCcZdIyQ=/0x0:3911x2048/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19874012/GettyImages_1209144185.jpg" alt="img">
Confirmed coronavirus cases in the US have topped 337,000, as the country continues to lead the world in new infections. And things will only get worse from here: The US surgeon general warned on Sunday that this week could be America’s most difficult yet as it battles the outbreak.</p>
<p>While the US braces for the potential peak of its crisis, the rest of the world remains unspared. In the United Kingdom, Queen Elizabeth II gave an address to the nation saying the country would overcome the crisis, just as Prime Minister Boris Johnson was admitted to the hospital Sunday night for tests because of his persistent coronavirus symptoms. And Japan’s government is expected to declare a state of emergency in Tokyo and other areas, in an attempt to mitigate the outbreak in major cities.</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to know today.</p>
<p>“This is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment”</p>
<p>Huge swaths of America are under lockdown. Cities like New York, New Orleans, and Detroit are seeing startling death tolls, and hospitals are overwhelmed. And across America, it is expected to get worse.</p>
<p>“This is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9/11 moment,” US Surgeon General Jerome Adams said on Fox News Sunday. “Only it’s not going to be localized, it’s going to be happening all over the country. And I want America to understand that.”</p>
<p>It’s a sobering warning, as America has already registered more than 337,000 cases, and nearly 10,000 deaths, as of April 6. On Sunday, New York City recorded nearly 600 deaths, a slight dip from Saturday.</p>
<p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, the federal government’s top infectious disease doctor, echoed those warnings on the Sunday shows this week. “On the one hand, things are going to get bad, and we need to be prepared for that,” Fauci said. “It is going to be shocking to some. It certainly is really disturbing to see that. But that’s what’s going to happen before it turns around.”</p>
<p>As Fauci said, this was expected. The social distancing recommendations and the statewide lockdowns in most (but not all) states are intended to “flatten the curve” to avoid overwhelming hospitals, but a peak in cases is still expected. Meanwhile, questions remain about the availability of personal protective equipment, hospital beds, and ventilators.</p>
<p>The worst is coming, but it’s unclear whether the country is prepared for it.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson is hospitalized, but he’s still working</p>
<p>UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson publicly announced his coronavirus diagnosis on March 27, though he said he would continue to lead the country through this national emergency from self-isolation. But on Sunday, Johnson, 55, was admitted to the hospital because of his continuing coronavirus symptoms, including a high fever.</p>
<p>The prime minister is in a London hospital for observation, but he’s still getting briefings from his hospital bed, a spokesperson said. Johnson tweeted that he is in “good spirits.” (A spokesperson also refuted Russian media reports that Johnson was on a ventilator.)</p>
<p>Last night, on the advice of my doctor, I went into hospital for some routine tests as I’m still experiencing coronavirus symptoms. I’m in good spirits and keeping in touch with my team, as we work together to fight this virus and keep everyone safe. — Boris Johnson #StayHomeSaveLives (@BorisJohnson) April 6, 2020</p>
<p>Dominic Raab, the UK foreign secretary, has been tapped to stand in if Johnson can no longer complete his duties. On Saturday, the opposition Labour Party selected a new leader, Keir Starmer, who wished Johnson a “speedy recovery.”</p>
<p>The news of Johnson’s condition came shortly after Queen Elizabeth broadcast a rare message to the country to address the coronavirus crisis. “Together we are tackling this disease and I want to reassure you that if we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it,” she said.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom has been on lockdown since March 23, and now has more than 48,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and more than 4,900 deaths, as of April 6.</p>
<p>Japan to declare a state of emergency in Tokyo</p>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzo is expected to declare a state of emergency that will cover Tokyo, Osaka, and other areas where coronavirus infections are rising. The orders, which are expected tomorrow, will urge people to stay home except to shop for essential goods, go to work, or exercise. The order will last until May 6.</p>
<p>Japan has thus far avoided mass shutdowns, except for closing schools, and it had not seen a coronavirus surge like other countries. But the uptick in cases in recent days — Tokyo had its biggest single-day increase in cases, at 143, on Sunday — has raised some questions as to whether Japan’s government was being forthright about the number of coronavirus cases, especially given that Japan and the International Olympic Committee had planned to go ahead with the Olympics until late last month. Japan is particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus because of its aging population.</p>
<p>Abe is also planning to introduce a massive stimulus package, potentially more than $900 billion, to try to offset any pain to the economy because of the new emergency measures. Japan’s economy was already struggling before this coronavirus crisis, and Abe described this aid package as “unprecedented,” far exceeding the stimulus money spent to cope with the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p>And some good news</p>
<p>There have been so, so many trend pieces on dating in the time of quarantine, but whatever romance you think might be blossoming over FaceTime is nothing compared to the passion finally blooming between Ying Ying and Le Le, two giant pandas in Hong Kong’s Ocean Park.</p>
<p>For the first time in their 10-year relationship, the two pandas mated naturally on Monday. According to the South China Morning Post, “After repeated failures &hellip; the black-and-white heartthrobs made it at the age of 14 during the ongoing mating season between March and May,” the park said.</p>
<p>Any signs of a quarantine cub won’t appear until about June, but we’re rooting for these two crazy kids — and, you know, the species.

<h3 id="coronavirus-evening-update-as-boris-johnson-stays-in-hospital">Coronavirus: Evening update as Boris Johnson stays in hospital</h3>
<p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/CE44/production/_111640825_hi060954793.jpg" alt="img">
Here are five things to bring you up to speed with the coronavirus outbreak this Monday evening. We&rsquo;ll have another update for you on Tuesday morning.</p>
<ol>
<li>Too early to think about lockdown end</li>
</ol>
<p>Prof Chris Whitty, the UK government&rsquo;s chief medical adviser, is back at No 10&rsquo;s daily briefing after spending time in quarantine due to virus symptoms. He says it&rsquo;d be a mistake to think about how to end the lockdown now and that can&rsquo;t begin until the country is at or beyond the peak of the virus. It&rsquo;s too early to tell when that peak will be.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>PM remains in hospital</li>
</ol>
<p>Boris Johnson says he is in &ldquo;good spirits&rdquo; as he remains in hospital under observation. The prime minister, 55, announced he had the virus 10 days ago. But there is a &ldquo;fair bit of unease&rdquo; building among some Tory MPs about Boris Johnson trying to run the country and recover at the same time, says BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.</p>
<p>Image copyright EPA/Reuters</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Parks told to only close as a last resort</li>
</ol>
<p>Councils should only close parks if it is impossible to maintain social distancing rules, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick says. It comes after sunny weather in parts of the country led to some people breaking the government&rsquo;s lockdown rules.</p>

<ol start="4">
<li>Airbnb hosts criticised</li>
</ol>
<p>People on accommodation rental site Airbnb are advertising properties as &ldquo;Covid-19 retreats&rdquo; - despite government advice saying no-one should be going outside except for essential journeys. New laws say holiday lets can be rented to key workers who need to self-isolate, but some lettings allow you to book instantly without any checks.</p>

<ol start="5">
<li>Pop stars in global fundraising concert</li>
</ol>
<p>Lady Gaga made a surprise appearance at the World Health Organization&rsquo;s press conference earlier. The pop star announced she and several other stars are putting on a live TV concert to be shown around the world on 18 April to raise money for personal protective equipment. Paul McCartney, Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Chris Martin and Lizzo are among those who will be joining her.</p>
