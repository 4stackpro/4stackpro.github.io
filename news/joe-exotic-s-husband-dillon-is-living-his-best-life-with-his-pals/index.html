Dillon Passage is having the time of his life (Picture: Netflix)</p>
<p>Netflix’s new docuseries Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness had us gripped from the get-go with its wild subject matter and colourful personalities.</p>
<p>Joe Exotic’s love life was a big part of the series and we were introduced to the many relationships from his polygamous marriage to John Finlay and Travis Maldonado to his most recent husband Dillon Passage.</p>
<p>The two were married in a small, strange ceremony with ex-husband Travis’s mother in attendance.</p>
<p>In the seventh and final episode of the rollercoaster of a documentary, Dillon and Joe are still together despite Joe serving a 22-year jail sentence for murder-for-hire and wildlife charges.</p>
<p>And from Dillon’s Instagram page, he’s having the time of his life considering the circumstances.</p>
<p>The Florida resident is doing what most 20-something people do, hanging out with friends at the beach and going to clubs.</p>
<p>What is he up to now?</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>From the looks of it, Dillon is spending time with his large group of friends.</p>
<p>Cracking open a cold one with the boys in ‘gator infested rivers is already the most Florida thing we can imagine.</p>
<p>Dillon uploaded a series of pictures of him and his friends, thanking them for the constant support.</p>
<p>He and his friends were pictured with alligator-shaped floaties, parties with friends and many tie-dye shirts.</p>
<p>Is he still with Joe Exotic?</p>
<p>Exotic – real name Joseph Allen Maldonado-Passage – is nowhere to be found on Dillon’s Instagram page.</p>
<p>The only thing reminding us of him is the tigers and Exotic-esque bio: ‘Animals are cooler than people.’</p>
<p>In a video of him dancing, a fan asked whether the two are still together, and Dillon answered: ‘I’m still married to joe but my social media platform isn’t used for any joe things. Thank you though.’</p>
<p>In the meantime, partying and hanging out with his besties is the way to go.</p>
<p>What about the animals?</p>
<p>Joe Exotic going to prison hasn’t changed Dillon’s love for tigers and other exotic animals.</p>
<p>If you scroll past all the parties and good times, he also shared snaps of his favourite tigers and snakes.</p>
<p>A post about his tiger from Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park read: ‘#DoublePost but I’ve never experienced quite the same connection as I do with these cats than I have with any other animals.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>‘These awesome animals may seem big and scary but if treated and cared for with respect, they’ll treat you the same.’</p>
<p>Considering almost everywhere is in lockdown, we don’t know how often he gets to see the animals.</p>
<p>EDM festivals are definitely no longer and option at this time with many concerts and events getting cancelled.</p>
<p>Does hanging out in gator-infested rivers count as social distancing?</p>
<p>Got a story?</p>

<p><img src="https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/tiger-king.jpg?w=1000" alt="img">
Robert Moor, host of the hit Wondery podcast Joe Exotic: Tiger King, chatted with Andy Cohen Monday morning on Cohen’s show Andy Cohen Live on his SiriusXM channel, Radio Andy.</p>
<p>Moor talked about the upcoming limited series based on the Joe Exotic podcast that is in development at UCP, starring and executive produced by Kate McKinnon. Interest in the project, based on the second season of Wondery’s Over My Dead Body podcast, has skyrocketed because of the massive popularity of the Netflix docuseries Tiger King, about the real-life characters depicted in the Joe Exotic limited series.</p>
<p>Moor dished about his dream cast for the series, which include Sam Rockwell, Margot Robbie and John C. Reilly as Doc Antle.</p>

<h3 id="last-week-tonight-apologizes-for-joe-exotic-statement-he-was-actually-the-second-least-perfect-candidate">‘Last Week Tonight’ Apologizes for Joe Exotic Statement: He Was Actually “The Second-Least-Perfect Candidate”</h3>
<p><img src="https://nypdecider.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/last-week-tonight-john-oliver-joe-exotic.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="img">
Last Week Tonight host John Oliver isn’t one to backtrack and issue apologies, but he’s breaking tradition for the one and only Joe Exotic. On Sunday, the official Last Week Tonight Twitter account issued a “correction” for a 2016 segment about the Tiger King sensation, which, at the time, mocked his long-shot bid for president. In hindsight, Joe Exotic may not actually be the worst candidate from that election cycle.</p>
<p>In October 2016, Oliver devoted a full segment to the election’s third-party candidates, including Exotic, an Oklahoma libertarian. The Last Week Tonight show host praised Exotic’s “incredible campaign videos” about his homosexuality, his refusal to wear a suit, and the “judgement against [him] from some bitch down in Florida.”</p>
<p>“Wow, just wow,” said Oliver at the time (Tiger King viewers will recognize the segment, which also appears in Episode 5). “Joe Exotic is truly the candidate you’d want to sit down and have a beer with. Then another beer, and then several more beers until you’re drunk enough to try meth for the first time.”</p>
<p>After running through the rest of the third-party docket, Oliver concluded that Joe Exotic is “perfect” for the Oval Office, but four years later, he’s rethinking that statement. “CORRECTION: In our show on October 16, 2016, we raised the possibility that Joe Exotic might be ‘the perfect candidate’ for the presidency,” the Last Week Tonight account tweeted on Sunday afternoon. “In light of subsequent events, we must regretfully concede that he was, in fact, the second-least-perfect presidential candidate that year.”</p>
<p>So, about the “least-perfect presidential candidate that year.” While the show kept their tweet Trump-free, Oliver tore into the president in an at-home “Coronavirus III” episode that aired last night. The late night host ripped Trump’s “economy open by Easter” promise (which the president ultimately walked back on Sunday night), calling it “irresponsible” and a “massively botched” plan. “Trump has failed to give this crisis the seriousness it requires,” he said. “This was always going to be hard, but it didn’t have to be this hard.”</p>
<p>Last Week Tonight airs every Sunday at 11/10c on HBO. Tiger King is now streaming on Netflix.</p>
