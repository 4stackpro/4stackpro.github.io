The world is watching as the man who should be leading the UK&rsquo;s fight against coronavirus battles the disease himself from intensive care and away from loved ones.</p>
<p>But nothing could compare to the pain of the prime minister&rsquo;s heavily pregnant and recently ill fiancee Carrie Symonds, says the prime minister&rsquo;s biographer, Sonia Purnell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a horrible, horrible situation, just ghastly,&rdquo; Ms Purnell told Sky News.</p>
<p>Image: A post by Carrie Symonds on Instagram reveals they got engaged at the end of last year</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t even accompany your loved one in the hospital. I can only imagine the agony of Carrie Symonds, his fiancee, who as we know is due to give birth in the early summer. This is a nightmare all round and also a nightmare for the whole country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boris Johnson spent the night in the intensive care unit of St Thomas&rsquo; Hospital, after his coronavirus symptoms worsened and he suffered breathing difficulties.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The 55-year-old tested positive for the disease 11 days ago and was admitted to hospital on Sunday night.</p>
<p>But his health deteriorated yesterday, as Downing Street said he suffered from &ldquo;persistent&rdquo; symptoms of COVID-19 - including a cough and a high temperature.</p>
<p>He had barely been able to see Ms Symonds since he fell ill, as she is pregnant with their first child and had also been self-isolating due to fears of having caught COVID-19.</p>
<p>On Saturday, 32-year-old Ms Symonds posted said on Twitter that she had spent the past week in bed with the main coronavirus symptoms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t needed to be tested and, after seven days of rest, I feel stronger and I&rsquo;m on the mend,&rdquo; she wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being pregnant with COVID-19 is obviously worrying. To other pregnant women, please do read and follow the most up to date guidance which I found to be v [sic] reassuring,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Image: The pair must continue their time apart as Mr Johnson is treated in intensive care for coronavirus</p>
<p>Ms Symonds is believed to have left Downing Street more than a week ago to quarantine in her South London flat.</p>
<p>Like all friends and family of coronavirus patients, she will have to stay away from her fiance as she grows more pregnant with the couple&rsquo;s first child and Mr Johnson endures his condition in hospital.</p>
<p>Pregnant women are on the list of those &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; of severe complications from coronavirus and were therefore classed in the group of people who should avoid non-essential contact for three months.</p>
<p>While there is no evidence that pregnant women are more likely to contract COVID-19 or suffer more severely, doctors know that pregnancy can affect immune systems and therefore make expectant mothers more vulnerable to viruses.</p>
<p>Beteen Ms Symonds vulnerability and Mr Johnson&rsquo;s serious state, it is unclear when the pair will be able to reunite.</p>
<p>Ms Purnell, who has known Mr Jonhson since the early 1990s, said she believed his desire to continue to lead the country contributed to the worsening of his illness.</p>
<p>Image: Boris Johnson was first admitted to St Thomas&rsquo; Hospital on Sunday night</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been prime minister for eight months, that is something he has wanted all his life,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I think that desire to be the top dog, to be the PM, may have stopped him from stepping back when he was first ill, and now he may wish that he had done, and would have perhaps gotten better that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>:: Listen to the Daily podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify, Spreaker</p>
<p>&ldquo;I send him my very best wishes&hellip;. but this is ikely now to be a long haul and this will be a very unsettling time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms Purnell said Mr Johnson&rsquo;s inability to continue his job will be &ldquo;deeply frustrating&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he never wanted to be prime minister during a global pandemic, and it isn&rsquo;t the sort of thing that plays with his best strength,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s naturally an optimistic person; there&rsquo;s a bit of bravado there. One remembers him shaking hands at a hospital a few weeks ago where there were coronavirus patients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he isn&rsquo;t invincible, no-one is. This will be a deep shock for him, that he has succumbed in this way - really quite traumatic for him&rdquo;.

<h3 id="boris-johnsons-pregnant-fiancée-carrie-symonds-banned-from-visiting-him-at-hospital">Boris Johnson&rsquo;s pregnant fiancée Carrie Symonds banned from visiting him at hospital</h3>

<p>Boris Johnson&rsquo;s heavily pregnant fiancee Carrie Symonds is barred from visiting the PM as he battles coronavirus in intensive care.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old former political adviser is just weeks away from giving birth and previously revealed she was also struck down by the killer bug last week.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson, 55, was rushed into ICU at St Thomas&rsquo; Hospital in central last night and his partner is unable to see him due to her pregnancy and because visitors are banned.</p>
<p>Prior to being diagnosed with Covid-19 almost two weeks ago - which saw the PM quarantining at Number 10 - the couple have barely seen each other.</p>
<p>(Image: AFP/Getty Images)</p>
<p>Mr Johnson had been giving daily conferences and holding endless meetings to discuss the growing pandemic before testing positive.</p>
<p>Their hour a day meetings were cut to zero.</p>
<p>Miss Symonds, who previously served as head of communications for the Conservative Party headquarters, took to Twitter over the weekend to reveal she had been bedridden with the symptoms herself.</p>
<p>The mum-to-be - who usually lives with the Prime Minister in the No 11 flat - also previously shared a photograph of herself self-isolating in Camberwell, south London, with the couple’s dog Dilyn.</p>
<p>She is understood to have since been staying with her mum in East Sheen, south west London.</p>
<p>There is currently no evidence Covid-19 can harm an unborn baby but medical and scientific understanding of the disease is still very small.</p>
<p>(Image: PA)</p>
<p>However, due to the couple&rsquo;s conditions they cannot see each other.</p>
<p>Miss Symonds is the first unmarried partner of a prime minister to reside in 10 Downing Street and there was much scepticism when her affair with Mr Johnson - who was still married to second wife Marina Wheeler - came to light.</p>
<p>On February 29 they then announced they were engaged and expecting a child in mid-2020.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister, meanwhile, is said to be conscious and not on a ventilator, having been admitted to hospital on Sunday night as his condition worsened.</p>
<p>(Image: REUTERS)</p>
<p>He had been due to come out of self isolation last Friday but remained holed up as he was still displaying symptoms, which apparently included a cough and fever.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson was then moved to the ICU at around 7pm last night after experiencing breathing difficulties which required him to be given oxygen.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab - who earlier said the PM was in &ldquo;good spirits&rdquo; - has been instructed to deputise for Mr Johnson.</p>
<p>(Image: ANDY RAIN/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)</p>
<p>A statement from Downing Street said: &ldquo;Since Sunday evening, the Prime Minister has been under the care of doctors at St Thomas’ Hospital, in London, after being admitted with persistent symptoms of coronavirus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the course of this afternoon, the condition of the Prime Minister has worsened and, on the advice of his medical team, he has been moved to the Intensive Care Unit at the hospital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The PM has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is the First Secretary of State, to deputise for him where necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The PM is receiving excellent care, and thanks all NHS staff for their hard work and dedication.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Buckingham Palace said the Queen is being kept up-to-date on Mr Johnson&rsquo;s condition.</p>
<p>Just hours before he was moved, Mr Johnson tweeted: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in good spirits and keeping in touch with my team, as we work together to fight this virus and keep everyone safe.&rdquo;

<p>Who is Carrie Symonds?</p>
<p>Carrie Symonds is a 32-year-old PR guru due to wed Boris Johnson.</p>
<p>The communications and PR guru announced on February 29 she is expecting her first child with the Prime Minister, welcoming the child early in the summer.</p>
<p>The mum-to-be quit working for Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) in 2018.</p>
<p>Her parents are Matthew Symonds, one of the founders of The Independent, and Josephine Mcaffee who was one of the paper&rsquo;s lawyers.</p>
<p>Symonds grew up in East Sheen, south west London, and attended the prestigious Godolphin and Latymer School in Hammersmith.</p>
<p>10 Carrie with new pet dog Dilyn</p>
<p>Will Carrie self-isolate due to coronavirus?</p>
<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on March 27 that he has tested positive for coronavirus.</p>
<p>According to NHS guidelines, Symonds will now self-isolate for a period of 14 days.</p>
<p>The NHS website says that anybody who lives with someone that has coronavirus symptoms must isolate for two weeks.</p>
<p>This is because it can take up to 14 days for symptoms to appear.</p>
<p>Symonds later revealed she had coronavirus-like symptoms, but has yet to test for the killer bug.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>What is Carrie&rsquo;s job?</p>
<p>Carrie works as a senior adviser at Oceana working to support the Bloomberg Foundation’s Vibrant Oceans Initiative.</p>
<p>As part of her role she works on communications related to Oceana’s &ldquo;Save the Oceans, Feed the World&rdquo; Initiative and Oceana’s campaign to reduce the use of plastics.</p>
<p>She is also part of the international marketing communications team based in London.</p>
<p>10 Boris Johnson&rsquo;s girlfriend Carrie Symonds announced they are set to marry</p>
<p>When did she work for the Conservative party?</p>
<p>Described as a popular figure in Westminster, the young PR whizz regularly attended parliamentary bashes and Tory party events while working as the party’s communications chief.</p>
<p>Symonds worked for current Home Secretary Sajid Javid when he held the local government brief, as well as for John Whittingdale during his time as Culture Secretary.</p>
<p>Following a brief spell as an adviser to Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, she was appointed to the strategic role of Conservative communications chief.</p>
<p>During her eight years at CCHQ she worked alongside leading Tories including Michael Gove and Amber Rudd.</p>
<p>The lucrative role led to her being named as the UK’s second most powerful public relations professional by PR Week magazine.</p>
<p>She quit in around August 2018, before starting at Bloomberg as PR for their Vibrant Oceans programme.</p>
<p>10 Carrie hit the news over her row with Boris Johnson at home</p>
<p>What happened when Boris Johnson became Prime Minister?</p>
<p>Carrie Symonds moved in with Boris Johnson at Downing Street.</p>
<p>They were the first unmarried couple to live at the Prime Minister&rsquo;s residence.</p>
<p>The couple have taken the space above No11 Downing Street instead of the traditional residence at No10.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Prime Minister said at the time:&ldquo;The PM is officially moving in today [July 29, 2019] and, yes, his partner will be living there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And on September 2, 2019, Boris and Carrie moved in another flatmate - Dilyn, a rescued Jack Russell puppy.</p>
<p>10 Carrie Symonds has been dating Boris Johnson since last year</p>
<p>What did she ask Samantha Cameron?</p>
<p>Ahead of Symonds move into No 10 she approached the wife of the former Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron for advice and tips.</p>
<p>A friend of the former PR guru told the Mail: “Sam Cam has been giving Carrie some advice on living in No10. They&rsquo;re friends; she wants to help out.”</p>
<p>Carrie won&rsquo;t have any publicly funded staff working for her.</p>
<p>The couple had previously been living in Carrie&rsquo;s flat in Camberwell, South London.</p>
<p>10 Carrie has moved into No 10 with Boris Johnson</p>
<p>10 Carrie Symonds is due to be married to the PM</p>
<p>When did Carrie and Boris become an item?</p>
<p>The pair&rsquo;s romance was confirmed beyond doubt when she appeared in public with him for the first time to support his leadership bid in June 2019.</p>
<p>Sources say that on Valentine&rsquo;s Day 2018, Symonds was heard boasting to friends about spending the night with Boris in the Oxfordshire countryside, while BoJo is also reported to have wooed Symonds at the Rosewood Hotel in Holborn.</p>
<p>BoJo, 54, vowed to &ldquo;protect&rdquo; Carrie and apologised for dragging her into the media storm, according to the Mirror.</p>
