<p>Lifeguards want everyone to heed the warnings and keep themselves and their animals safe this summer.</p>
<p>SAN DIEGO COUNTY, Calif. — Ocean waves and sandy beaches are among the many reasons why San Diegans and tourists love our region, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it all goes according to plan along the coast.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of people from out of town. There’s a lot of people who haven’t been to the beach in a while even if they do live in San Diego,” said Maureen Hodges, a Marine Safety Lieutenant with San Diego Fire and Rescue Lifeguards. “We do see a lot of people that make decisions that don’t turn out for the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That can encompass a list of things including what happened near La Jolla Cove last week. A dog, off its leash in an un-designated area, got swept out to sea near the cove. Bystanders reported watching it go under and struggling to stay afloat.</p>
<p>An eyewitness said the dog&rsquo;s owner was taking a video selfie at the time. While lifeguards did respond, the dog made it safely to rocks down the beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think in that instance the dog made it to shore was leashed and exited The beach. We do make a lot of dog rescues,” Hodges said. “We get a lot of dogs at Sunset Cliffs, and sometimes at Torrey pines that will go down a trail, chase a ball or get stuck in a position.”</p>
<p>Sadly, in the age of social media, tragedies have happened. Sunset Cliffs has had several “selfie deaths,” and lifeguards have responded to numerous rescues possibly linked to someone trying to get the best shot for social media. Last may a man taking a selfie drowned after falling off the Oceanside Pier into rough waters.

Over 50,000 evacuated in Gujarat, Daman ahead of cyclone</p>
<p>India</p>
<p>pti-PTI</p>
<p>By PTI</p>
<p>Ahmedabad, June 03: Nearly 50,000 people living in coastal areas of South Gujarat and some 4,000 residents of the neighbouring Union Territory of Daman have so far been shifted to safer places ahead of the approaching cyclonic storm &lsquo;Nisarga&rsquo;, officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Cyclone Nisarga to make landfall near Mumbai, coastal Maharashtra on red alert | Oneindia News</p>
<p>Police have been deployed on all the beaches in Gujarat&rsquo;s coastal belt and people have been asked to remain indoors, they said. As many as 50,000 living near the coastline in South Gujarat have already been shifted to safer places while work is in progress to evacuate more people, Additional Chief Secretary, Revenue, Pankaj Kumar said.</p>
<p>Cyclone Nisarga: From rain, wind warning to damage expected, all you need to know</p>
<p>The cyclone would have maximum impact on the coastal districts of Valsad and Navsari, followed Bharuch and Surat, he said. &ldquo;It is expected that the wind speed will remain between 100 to 110 kmph in Valsad and Navsari when the cyclone hits the coast between south Gujarat and north Maharashtra. All the fishermen have already been called back from the sea. Salt-pan workers along with shrimp farm workers have also been shifted to safer locations,&rdquo; Kumar said in a statement.</p>
<p>Besides, some 4,000 people living close to the sea shore in the adjoining Union Territory of Daman have also been shifted to safer places, another official said. The nearly 50,000 people evacuated so far in Gujarat include 32,000 from Valsad district alone. While the cyclone is expected to cross the state coast in the afternoon, light rain started in most parts of Valsad and Navsari districts since morning. &ldquo;We have shifted nearly 32,000 people living close to the sea shore to temporary shelters.</p>
<p>The weather is cloudy at present but winds have not started yet,&rdquo; Valsad collector R R Raval said. As many as 15 teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and six teams of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) have been deployed at different locations to help local administration in relief and rescue works, Kumar said. As a precautionary measure, about 236 large hoardings and 120 high mast lights have been removed from Surat, Valsad and other towns of coastal region, he said. Around 250 ambulances and 170 emergency medical teams have been kept on stand-by in the South Gujarat region to address any eventuality, the official said.</p>
<p>The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has indicated that the cyclone may not make a landfall on the Gujarat coast. However, it will have an impact in the form of gusty winds coupled with heavy rainfall in the coastal belt. As per the latest IMD release, the cyclonic storm Nisarga over East Central Arabian Sea is currently around 460 km from Surat.</p>
<p>It will cross north Maharashtra and adjoining south Gujarat coast between Harihareshwar and Daman, close to Alibaug of Maharashtra during the afternoon, with a maximum sustained wind speed of 100 to 110 kmph, it said. The state MeT Centre said the cyclone will cause heavy rain in several parts of South Gujarat on Wednesday and Thursday. Barring the South Gujarat region, the cyclone will not have much impact in rest of the state, state MeT centre director Jayanta Sarkar said.

Stingray sightings off the Mazarrón and Cartagena coastline</p>
<p>At the weekend stingrays were sighted in both municipalities</p>
<p>It’s quite rare for these elusive and beautiful fish to swim in close to the shore of the Murcia Region but they are out there and on Saturday and Monday reports were received of Stingray sightings in both La Azohía, which is in the Cartagena municipality, and the playa del Rihuete, which is around five kilometres along the coast in the Mazarrón municipality.</p>
<p>The La Azohía sighting was on Saturday and the one in Mazarrón on Monday.</p>
<p>Tweet:Alfonso.Garrido</p>
<p>In both cases the ray was close in to the shore and apparently unperturbed by the proximity of curious bathers.</p>
<p>They’re generally found much deeper and tend to prefer depths of around 60 metres.</p>
<p>If you are fortunate enough to witness a ray swimming in close to shore be careful not to get too close; they’re not called stingrays for nothing and the tail contains a stinging spine with a venom gland at its base.</p>
<p>They’re not aggressive but won´t appreciate attempts to catch them, tread on them or grab their tail, so be careful and admire from afar!</p>

<p><img src="http://carsonnow.org/sites/www.carsonnow.org/files/111764-nhpdoor.jpeg" alt="img">
The Nevada Highway Patrol has identified the victim in a fatal crash Thursday involving three motorcycles on State Route 207 Kingsbury Grade near Lake Tahoe in Douglas County.</p>
<p>Paul Bartell, 71, of Jackson, Calif., died at the scene of the crash, which happened June 11 after 2 p.m. in the area of Palisades Drive in the Stateline area, said NHP spokeswoman Hannah DeGoey.</p>
<p>The preliminary investigation shows a burgundy 1994 Harley Davidson motorcycle was traveling eastbound on SR-207 and entered a right hairpin curve. Traveling in the opposite direction were two motorcycles: a red 2016 Harley Davidson and a blue 2010 Harley Davidson.</p>
<p>The burgundy Harley Davidson, occupied by Bartell, veered left, crossing the double yellow centerline, and entered the westbound travel lane wrong-way and directly in the paths of the two oncoming motorcycles. The burgundy Harley Davidson struck the red Harley Davidson head-on and was subsequently struck by the blue Harley Davidson.

<h3 id="ancient-humans-feasted-on-shellfish-during-one-migration-out-of-africa">&ldquo;Ancient humans feasted on shellfish during one migration out of Africa&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/06/16/14/29670608-0-image-a-5_1592312930487.jpg" alt="img">
Prehistoric pioneers moving out of Africa and on to Arabia 5,000 years ago feasted on shellfish as a way to sustain themselves, a new study found.</p>
<p>Archaeologists from the University of York studied fossil reefs near to the now-submerged Red Sea shorelines that marked prehistoric migratory routes.</p>
<p>These routes took our ancestors out of Africa and to Arabia at the end of the Stone Age and the coast offered enough resources to make the journey sustainably.</p>
<p>The research team found that during periods of little rainfall when other food sources were scarce people would turn to crustaceans for sustenance.</p>
<p>The York team focused their study on the remains of 15,000 shells from sea creatures dating back 5,000 years to an arid period in the region.</p>
<p>Overview of the Farasan Island where thousands of shell fossils were found by the research team. This map of the southern Red Sea shows black dots indicating the main shell sites. The white rectangles indicate the three research areas where sites have been excavate</p>
<p>Drawing of a mature shell of the type that contained mollusks eaten by the ancient travellers</p>
<p>Marine molluscs have been a food source for more than 164,000 years but being able to study patterns and trends have ben hampered by the fact that the areas they were consumed are submerged or have been destroyed by sea-level change.</p>
<p>This led York researchers to find a new way to track the consumption of shellfish.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ecological information on the resilience of intertidal resources is crucial in assessing how attractive they were to past humans as a long-term source of food,&rsquo; they wrote.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of particular interest is the southern Red Sea and its function as the southern gateway out of Africa into Arabia during a period of aridity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Marine molluscs have been a food source for more than 164,000 years but being able to study patterns and trends have ben hampered by the fact that the areas they were consumed are submerged or have been destroyed by sea-level change</p>
<p>Prehistoric shell midden on the coast of the Farasan Islands (Saudi Arabia) where the shells were found and studied</p>
<p>With the coastline of original migratory routes submerged by sea-level rise after the last Ice Age, the team studied shells on the Farasan Islands in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>The researchers found that populations of marine mollusks were plentiful enough to allow continuous harvests without any major ecological impacts.</p>
<p>According to lead author, Dr Niklas Hausmann, their plentiful availability would have enabled people to live through times of drought - as was being experienced during this migration about 5,000 years ago.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The availability of food resources plays an important role in understanding the feasibility of past human migrations,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>For example, hunter-gatherer migrations would have required local food sources and periods of aridity could have restricted these movements.</p>
<p>With the coastline of original migratory routes submerged by sea-level rise after the last Ice Age, the team studied shells on the Farasan Islands in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our study suggests that Red Sea shorelines had the resources necessary to provide a passage for prehistoric people,&rsquo; Hausmann said.</p>
<p>The team said their findings suggest that shellfish may have been used in much earlier migrations out of Africa.</p>
<p>The southern Red Sea functioned as an important node in the network of human migration through time, most notably during the late Stone Age.</p>
<p>The study also confirms that communities settled on the shorelines of the Red Sea could have relied on shellfish as a sustainable food resource all year round.</p>
<p>It was a time when many other food resources, particularly those on land, were scarce and so people turned to the sea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Previous studies have shown that people of the southern Red Sea ate shellfish year-round and over periods of thousands of years,&rsquo; said Hausmann.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We now also know that this resource was not depleted by them, but shellfish continued to maintain a healthy population.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Farasan Bay is shown in these images - including the main areas of this study. Top left is Khur Maadi Bay, bottom left is Janaba West and right is Janaba East. We indicate the potential size of the near-shore area where shells were found</p>
<p>Southwards view from the area where the shells were found and were ancient humans would have walked on their way to Arabia 5,000 years ago</p>
<p>The southern Red Sea seascape consists of hundreds of islands, scattered along both shorelines together with two major archipelagos, the Farasan Islands and the Dahlak Islands, situated towards the southern end.</p>
<p>The sites in this study are all located on the Farasan Islands, which are on the Arabian side of the Red Sea, about 25 miles off-shore but inter-connected through smaller islands less than a dozen miles apart from each other.</p>
<p>The shellfish species found in the archaeological sites on the Farasan Islands were also found in abundance in fossil reefs dating to over 100,000 years ago.</p>
<p>This suggests that these shellfish have been an available resource over longer periods than archaeological sites previously suggested.</p>
<p>Co-author of the study, Matthew Meredith-Williams, from La Trobe University, said it was important to look at what was happening on land and sea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We know that modelling past climates to learn about food resources is extremely helpful, but we need to differentiate between what is happening on land and what is happening in the water,&rsquo; said Meredith-Williams.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In our study we show that marine foods were abundant and resilient and being gathered by people when they couldn&rsquo;t rely on terrestrial food.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The shorelines of the southern Red Sea are variable and have experienced dynamic shifts and geomorphological transformations in the past.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The implications of having a resilient, abundant, predictable and easily accessible coastal resource at one of the important nodes of human mobility - the southern Red Sea - adds an extra dimension to the study of Out Of Africa,&rsquo; they wrote.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The fact that these resources are also unaffected by arid conditions adds an additional complicating factor to arguments that past dispersal events were limited to periods of greater moisture availability.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The data showed that even with year round harvesting over long periods, the shellfish beds weren&rsquo;t negatively impacted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With the data presented here, we start to address the gap in quantifying the potential of marine resources in this key gateway of human dispersal through time,&rsquo; the study authors wrote.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The shellfish diversity and abundance found in the shell midden datasets indicate a rich ecological environment that is unaffected by the arid conditions of the terrestrial environment, providing sustainable resources to complement a mixed diet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The findings have been published in the journal Quaternary International.

<h3 id="us-highway-95-closure-for-earthquake-repairs-near-tonopah-extended-through-june-30">&ldquo;U.S. Highway 95 closure for earthquake repairs near Tonopah extended through June 30&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://carsonnow.org/sites/www.carsonnow.org/files/111762-tonopahroads.jpg" alt="img">
TONOPAH, Nev. — The Nevada Department of Transportation is extending the temporary closure of U.S. Highway 95 between the U.S. Route 6 and State Route 360 junctions through June 30 in Esmeralda and Mineral counties.</p>
<p>This stretch of highway averages about 2,300 vehicles daily. The highway had been scheduled to reopen by 4 p.m., June 17, following $2.43 million in emergency repairs stemming from a 6.5-magnitude earthquake that occurred on May 15, approximately 20 miles southeast of Mina.</p>
<p>And while the repairs will finish on June 17, as originally scheduled, the closure will be extended through 4 p.m., June 30, for an additional, separate chip seal pavement improvement project. Intermountain Slurry Seal Inc. is the general contractor under a $2.1 million contract.</p>
<p>“Chip sealing combines layers of asphalt and fine aggregates that help prevent roadway deterioration for a smoother, safer driving experience,” said NDOT spokesman Tony Illia. “It’s a cost-effective maintenance solution that extends the roadway’s lifecycle.”</p>
<p>Work will occur along U.S. Highway 95 between Mile Markers 83 and 97 in Esmeralda County, as well from Mile Markers 0 and 25 in Mineral County. Motorists, as a result, will be detoured along U.S. Route 6 and State Route 360, resulting in up to 30-minute travel delays. NDOT works with Waze to inform the public about planned highway restrictions, but unscheduled construction changes, closures and restrictions are possible due to weather or other factors. For the latest state highway conditions, visit nvroads.com or call 511 before driving.</p>
<p>NDOT and its contractors continue vital highway construction and maintenance activities upkeeping Nevada’s transportation system for essential travel and supply chain deliveries. The department actively practices COVID-19-related public health and safety protocols, including social distancing of six feet or more and restricting groups to 10 or less, thereby keeping our team, families and communities safe and connected.
