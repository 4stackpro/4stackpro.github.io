JOHOR BARU: More Malaysian workers are expected to return home from Singapore following a month-long lockdown to be enforced by the city-state from this Tuesday to break the Covid-19 transmission chain.</p>
<p>A restaurant worker in the republic, Muhammad Alif Omar, 26 said so far there had been no statements nor directives from the republic’s authorities calling for Malaysians to return home following the imposition of the month-long lockdown.</p>
<p>He said, for now, it was made to understand that Malaysians may be dismissed from their jobs or they may be allowed to return home upon fulfilling certain conditions.</p>
<p>“They should possess letters from companies or employers and health letters from selected clinics and undertake (Covid-19) screening. In the event of a negative test, they can show these two letters to the authorities and return to Malaysia.</p>
<p>“So far, the Singapore government has not announced anything about it (about Malaysians returning home), but it all depends on this Monday, as there may be further information from them.</p>
<p>“Yesterday’s announcement informed that only essential services would operate. Maybe some of us are not involved in such essential services and we would take the opportunity to return home, before April 7,” he said when contacted, here, today.</p>
<p>Fast food restaurant worker, Nur Marliyana Romli, 26, said eateries would be open but maybe their operating hours would be shortened and services would only involve take-away.</p>
<p>She said in terms of workers, employers would usually ask permanent workers to take unpaid leave and work schedules would be created on a rotational basis.</p>
<p>“So far employers have not forced us (foreign workers) to continue working or return to our home countries, but they will be forced to take unpaid leave. For example, Team A will work today, Team B will take leave without pay and we will take turns, so on and so forth.</p>
<p>“For the services sector, those who opt to return home can do so but the inherent risk is that their work permit would be cancelled automatically when their leave exceeds 14 days.</p>
<p>“There is a possibility that those (Malaysians) not involved in non-essential services would return home, as to live here without a job would be tough,” she said.</p>
<p>Singapore will shutter schools and most workplaces as it unveiled a raft of stricter measures to break the transmission of the coronavirus in the city-state.</p>
<p>Most workplaces, except for essential services and key economic sectors, will close starting Tuesday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in an address to the nation Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>The stricter measures adopted by the republic will see:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Casinos, theme parks to close starting next week;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Food establishments, markets and supermarkets, clinics, hospitals, utilities, transport and key banking services will remain open;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From April 7, all restaurants, hawker centres, coffee shops, food courts and other food and beverage outlets will remain open only for takeaway or delivery; and,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other economic sectors “that are strategic, or form part of a global supply chain&rdquo; will not be closed; and,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All preschool and student care centres will also be closed but will provide limited services for children of parents who have to continue working and are unable to make alternative care arrangements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Singapore’s government also plans to announce more support aimed at businesses and households on Monday.

<h3 id="singapore-announces-one-month-lockdown">Singapore announces one-month lockdown</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.livemint.com/img/2020/04/03/600x338/Singapore_1585937261194_1585937261393.jpg" alt="img">
Singapore’s government will shutter schools and most workplaces as the city-state unveiled a raft of stricter measures intended as a “circuit breaker&rdquo; to slow the spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p>Most workplaces, except for essential services and key economic sectors, will close starting on Tuesday, while the city-state will move to full home-based learning in its schools starting Wednesday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in an address to the nation Friday afternoon. The government will also unveil additional stimulus measures to boost the economy early next week.</p>
<p>The action comes as confirmed cases of local transmission and unlinked infections in the country have risen in recent weeks. “We have decided that instead of tightening incrementally over the next few weeks, we should make a decisive move now, to preempt escalating infections,&rdquo; said Lee.</p>
<p>Here are other details of the stricter measures:</p>
<p>Casinos, theme parks to close starting next week</p>
<p>Food establishments, markets and supermarkets, clinics, hospitals, utilities, transport and key banking services will remain open.</p>
<p>From April 7, all restaurants, hawker centers, coffee shops, food courts and other food and beverage outlets will remain open only for takeaway or delivery</p>
<p>Other economic sectors “that are strategic, or form part of a global supply chain&rdquo; will not be closed</p>
<p>All preschool and student care centers will also be closed, but will provide limited services for children of parents who have to continue working and are unable to make alternative care arrangements</p>
<p>Government will stop discouraging the general public from wearing face masks in public, and will distribute reusable masks from April 5</p>
<p>Singapore’s government also plans on Monday to announce more support aimed at businesses and households. Singapore delivered a second stimulus package worth S$48 billion ($33.5 billion) last week to fight the outbreak, drawing on national reserves for the first time since the global financial crisis to support an economy heading for recession.</p>
<p>‘Very Worrying’ Trends</p>
<p>Lee said the spirit of these measures is to get people to minimize physical contact. “If we don’t go out, if we avoid contact with others, then the virus won’t be able to spread. It is as simple as that,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Lawrence Wong, minister for national development who co-chairs a task force to fight the virus, said in a press conference Friday the increase in the number of local and unlinked coronavirus cases are “very, very worrying trends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The latest set of moves will continue for at least a month, Wong said, adding there’s a chance the government can roll back the measures by the end of the month if the guidelines are upheld. “If there’s poor compliance, poor implementation, then we have to be prepared for these measures to continue,&rdquo; Wong said. “Let’s hunker down and beat the virus together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Singapore announced Friday a fifth person has died due to complications from the coronavirus. Cases have risen more sharply in March compared to earlier months, and now total more than 1,000.</p>

<h3 id="singapore-to-impose-partial-lockdown-for-a-month">Singapore to impose partial lockdown for a month</h3>

This photo taken from Malaysia&rsquo;s Johor Bahru shows almost empty roads near the border with Singapore on March 18, 2020, after Malaysia imposed a two-week nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. (Kyodo)</p>
<p>SINGAPORE (Kyodo) &ndash; Singapore on Friday tightened its measures to curb the coronavirus spread that effectively amounts to a monthlong partial lockdown, with people told to stay at home and most workplaces ordered to close, after an alarming increase in unlinked local cases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will close most workplaces except for essential services and key economic sectors,&rdquo; Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on national television, adding that all schools and universities will switch to home-based learning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have kept the outbreak under control, but looking at the trend, I am worried that unless we take further steps, things will get worse,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Last week, Singapore began to see more local cases, nearly half of which were not traceable to any source.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This suggests that there are more people out there who are infected, but who have not been identified, and they may be passing the virus unknowingly to others,&rdquo; Lee said.</p>
<p>The stay-home rule will begin next Tuesday, with most business premises to be shuttered while educational institutions will all have to close from next Wednesday.</p>
<p>While the government has this week introduced penalties that it plans to impose on noncompliant companies, the call for the public to stay home appears to be more of an advisory as no penalty has been announced for individuals who do not comply.</p>
<p>People are still allowed to go out to buy food at markets, or to get take-out from restaurants and other food outlets, Lee said, adding that they can also exercise in parks as long as they keep a safe distance from others.</p>
<p>Companies providing essential services such as food establishments, supermarkets, clinics, hospitals, utility providers, transport companies and banks can continue to operate during this one month, as can firms involved in economic sectors deemed strategic or that form part of a global supply chain.</p>
<p>Asked if this constitutes a lockdown, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that &ldquo;rather than think about use the phrase &lsquo;lockdown&rsquo; which means different things to different people, let&rsquo;s focus on the specific measures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we are doing today is a significant tightening&hellip;but with these measures we are not stopping all work, we are not shutting down the economy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are not stopping people from going out if they really need to for work where it is essential or to get their food, groceries or even to exercise among their family members.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The number of people infected with the virus has increased by 65 to 1,114, of whom five have died. Nine of the new cases are imported and 56 are local cases without recent travel history abroad.
