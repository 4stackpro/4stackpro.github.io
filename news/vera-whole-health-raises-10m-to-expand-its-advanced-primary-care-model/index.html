Vera Whole Health has raised $10 million from existing backers to expand its “advanced primary care” model.</p>
<p>The Seattle-based company operates 26 clinics in 10 states, with clients including Seattle Children’s, the City of Kirkland, and Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Kansas City. It works with employers, payers, and health systems with a unique model that provides “health coaching” in addition to traditional primary care.</p>
<p>“Advanced primary care takes what you’ve come to expect from standard fee-for-service healthcare – the long waits, the frustratingly short appointments, the shuffle of specialist visits, the high costs and stress — and turns it upside down, creating a new model with aligned incentives that benefit patients, providers, communities, employers, and insurers while saving money,” the company notes on its website.</p>
<p>Vera has raised $70 million since it was co-founded in 2008 by President and CEO Ryan Schmid. Other co-founders include Patricia Diaz-Kismarton, Joel de Jong and Tom Norwood. Vera currently has about 450 employees, which includes both clinicians and corporate staff.</p>
<p>A SEC filing revealed the new funding. Vera declined to provide details about its investors. Last year Vera announced a partnership with publicly-traded Universal Health Services, which also invested in the company as part of the deal. In 2018, Vera raised a $5 million round.</p>
<p>Schmid co-founded Vera in 2008 when he was an MBA student at Seattle University. He previously worked at a nonprofit called Urban Impact and co-founded community health center Rainier Health and Fitness.</p>
<p>Vera is following COVID-19 guidelines set by the Washington State Health Department and the Centers for Disease Control. The company hosted a COVID-19 webinar on how to stay healthy, cope, and even thrive during a pandemic.</p>
<p>Editor’s note: This story was updated to reflect the structure of Vera’s primary care model.

<p>The 29-year-old and Vera discussed her return with This Morning&rsquo;s Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford via video link.</p>
<p>Rita - who has signed up to be a volunteer for the NHS - was asked if she&rsquo;s nervous about Vera, 56, returning to the frontline.</p>
<p>The singer replied: &ldquo;Selfishly, yes of course, but again I think my mum thrives off doing her duty and I don’t want to speak for her, but I think what made me want to volunteer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if it’s something like delivering food to someone’s home or picking up medicine, whatever it is, I felt, ‘Oh gosh. This is so real that I felt like, what could I possibly do?’&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rita added: “Obviously I don’t have a medical degree but I just think it’s really, truly heroic, not just from my mum’s perspective but just seeing all the doctors in general, really frontline and really putting themselves forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It just goes to show we as a humanity can still come together and be unified, it’s truly, truly, truly an amazing time for us to come out the other end and go, ‘Wow we’re really coming together’, so that really inspired me.'”</p>
<p>Vera explained that while it&rsquo;s hard not being able to see her beloved daughter, she knows she has a job to do.</p>

<h3 id="eagle-eyed-coronation-street-fans-spot-actor-james-burrows-in-classic-vera-episode">Eagle-eyed Coronation Street fans spot actor James Burrows in classic Vera episode</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2020/04/11145208/James.jpg" alt="img">
Eagle eyed Coronation Street fans spotted a former Weatherfield star in an old episode of Vera on Friday night.</p>
<p>Several took to Twitter to share their surprise over seeing James Burrows in the throwback episode</p>
<p>The actor appeared in Vera back in 2012, but his stint on the programme aired on repeat yesterday evening (April 10).</p>

<p>He starred on Corrie for two years as Dr Ali Neeson. But before his Corrie fame, he appeared on the third episode of the second series of Vera.</p>
<p>Is that our Dr Ali on Vera!</p>
<p>Playing a supporting role in the episode A Certain Samaritan, James is shown wearing a hoodie and sporting a bleached blonde spiky hairdo.</p>
<p>A very different look</p>
<p>Portraying a character called Charlie, one viewer shared a clip that showed him being confronted by Vera, played by Brenda Blethyn.</p>
<p>The user wrote: &ldquo;Watching old episodes of #Vera is that DR Ali @itvcorrie&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Another user asked: &ldquo;Is this Dr Ali from #Corrie on #vera?&rdquo; to which one user replied: &ldquo;Well spotted&rdquo; and another remarked: &ldquo;Just when you think his hair couldn&rsquo;t get any worse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And a third viewer posted: &ldquo;Is that our Dr Ali on Vera! #corrie #vera #jamesburrows&rdquo;.</p>
<p>New projects in the works</p>
<p>James departed from Corrie last month after playing Dr Ali Neeson for two years. The actor, 28, has left the cobbles to move on to other projects, including starring in a movie called Twisting My Melon.</p>

<p>The feature film is based on the autobiography of Happy Mondays&rsquo; band member Shaun Ryder. The star&rsquo;s book shares the same name.</p>
<p>Moreover, James said on a recent podcast episode that he also has several additional projects in the pipeline.</p>
<p>He told the hosts of Talk Derby To Me Podcast: &ldquo;Work&rsquo;s good, there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff going on at the minute.</p>
<p>Read more: Ofcom receives complaints over Eccles&rsquo; death</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a few other things, coming up in the near future which is very exciting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a few exciting meetings going on, but I can&rsquo;t say too much it&rsquo;s highly confidential.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James on the 2012 episode of Vera (Image credit: ITV)</p>
<p>However he said in a separate interview how much he enjoyed being part of the Coronation Street family.</p>
<p>Speaking to Digital Spy he said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a fantastic few years on Coronation Street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ali is such a flawed character and so much has happened to him. To play such a complex character with so many flaws has been great.&rdquo;</p>
