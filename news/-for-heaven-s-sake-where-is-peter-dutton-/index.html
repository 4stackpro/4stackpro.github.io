Labor&rsquo;s Shadow Home Affairs Minister Kristina Keneally has ripped into her government counterpart, Peter Dutton, accusing him of going missing amid a &ldquo;border security crisis&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Ms Keneally has been increasingly critical of the federal government for its handling of the Ruby Princess, a cruise ship which was allowed to dock in Sydney. Well over 400 passengers have since tested positive for the coronavirus, accounting for an astonishing 10 per cent of Australia&rsquo;s total reported cases.</p>
<p>The Australian Border Force has blamed the New South Wales government for the debacle, saying NSW Health gave the ship&rsquo;s passengers a &ldquo;green light&rdquo; to disembark.</p>
<p>Ms Keneally, however, argues the federal government is ultimately responsible.</p>
<p>At a press conference this morning, she stepped up her attack on Mr Dutton in particular.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why has there been deafening silence from Peter Dutton? For heaven&rsquo;s sake, where is Peter Dutton?&rdquo; Ms Keneally said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a border security crisis on our hands and we&rsquo;ve heard nothing from the Home Affairs Minister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Dutton was diagnosed with the coronavirus in mid-March after a trip to the United States. He was discharged from hospital on March 17, and went into self-isolation at home. He has kept a relatively low profile since.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he was diagnosed with coronavirus I was one of the first to wish him well. I wished him well in letters since, and I wish him well today,&rdquo; said Ms Keneally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Minister for Home Affairs has turned up on TV and radio, and he said he&rsquo;s feeling well and capable of working from home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So if that&rsquo;s the case, it is incumbent he stand up and explain to the nation how this border security failure occurred, and what steps he&rsquo;s going to take to ensure that those responsibilities handed to the state governments are being implemented in a way that ensures Australians stay as safe as possible when it comes to the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I look forward to Peter Dutton standing up in whatever form he can, whether it is from home, on radio, an interview through Zoom or Skype. We can do it, and if he can&rsquo;t, perhaps the Prime Minister needs to look at appointing an active Home Affairs Minister, because we&rsquo;re talking about nothing less than the security of our Australian borders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr Dutton was, incidentally, on 2GB radio this morning for his weekly interview with host Ray Hadley.</p>
<p>The Home Affairs Minister did not speak specifically about the Ruby Princess, but he did address the continuing issue of cruise ships floating off the coast of Australia.</p>
<p>He said he was working closely with state authorities, including NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear that some of the companies have been lying about the situation of the health of passengers and crew on board,&rdquo; said Mr Dutton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we&rsquo;ve agreed to do with NSW is to look at each of the vessels. I need to get an honest picture of what&rsquo;s happening, so we are going to have a health company, but also NSW and WA Health, and probably Queensland Health as well, do a proper assessment of what&rsquo;s happening on board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to deal sensibly with each of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is an issue for us, and the Australian Border Force Commissioner has issued directions for a number of vessels to depart Australian borders, and we&rsquo;re working through that with each of the companies now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Dutton said he hoped to come out of self-isolation tomorrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hoping to be set free tomorrow, but I&rsquo;ll get the test result back today. I feel pretty well, but there&rsquo;s a lot happening, so hours of isolation are going quickly,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The Ruby Princess decision is considered one of the biggest debacles of the coronavirus outbreak in Australia. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has introduced a ban on cruise ships docking anywhere in the state, vowing the mistake will not be repeated.</p>
<p>Despite Ms Berejiklian taking measures for everyone who left the ship to be contacted by health authorities, those people may have infected others - and that&rsquo;s a number we are still yet to see.</p>
<p>Of the 20 coronavirus deaths recorded across Australia, at least five have been passengers from the Ruby Princess.</p>
<p>Passengers who left the ship the day it was allowed to dock have said they were not told that anyone on board had presented any symptoms during the voyage.</p>
<p>Elisa McCafferty, an Australian woman who flew home to London with her husband immediately after disembarking the ship, told the BBC nothing was said at anytime about anyone being sick on board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a distinct lack of information coming through from Princess the entire time,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I turned on my phone and I started getting all these notifications from people back in Australia saying &lsquo;there&rsquo;s been confirmed cases on the Ruby&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I was just absolutely petrified. We had just been on two full flights - what if we had infected someone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another passenger, Bill Beerens who lives in Sydney, tested positive for the virus the day he disembarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that they let us down,&rdquo; Mr Beerens told the ABC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do honestly believe that they (cruise ship management) knew what was going on and they just wanted us off the boat.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="peter-duttons-silence-speaks-volumes">Peter Dutton&rsquo;s silence speaks volumes</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.5962%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1865%2C$y_981/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d68d2c5867c9b141f1f107cf4c8a3a43e2de4425" alt="img">
Of course, the major concern for Australia, as for the rest of the world, is the escalating health crisis also creating an economic crisis.</p>
<p>Naturally, Scott Morrison, Health Minister Greg Hunt, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and Finance Minister Mathias Cormann are constantly out explaining the government’s response and next measures. Along with the premiers talking about the latest actions in their states.</p>
<p>But from you, minister, the most noticeable aspect is an unusual silence from Queensland – even though it has become increasingly obvious the failure to implement much tougher border controls much earlier on both visitors and returning Australians only accelerated this crisis and the need for such draconian restrictions on all domestic social movement and the economy now.</p>
<p>Overseas travellers are so far responsible for around two-thirds of the nearly 5000 confirmed COVID -19 cases we yet know of.</p>
<p>Australia had clear warning signs of what might be coming from January. Yet it squandered its advantage of being an island.</p>
<p>This is not to suggest it’s a simple matter to close a country’s borders or to enforce quarantine measures, especially on returning Australian citizens or others who are asymptomatic.</p>
<p>Nor can this guarantee eradicating outbreaks once in the community. But the evidence available from elsewhere had already made obvious the need to greatly reduce the spread through strict controls on travellers.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Why didn’t more of this happen at our airports, let alone cruise ships, until so belatedly? Why were most airport arrivals stunned at the lack of temperature testing and questioning along with the ease and speed of entry right up until last weekend?</p>
<p>Just go home (how?) and self-isolate for 14 days was the only message, and then only from March 15, along with a two-page information sheet. No detailed checks, no tracking, no follow-up.</p>
<p>Early warning squandered</p>
<p>It’s true very few countries have been properly prepared to even attempt to manage this pandemic. We are doing better than most. Australia still had clear warning signs of what might be coming from January.</p>
<p>Yet it squandered its advantage of being an island, unlike so many other countries with far more porous land borders. It was certainly a far more feasible option here to strictly target all arrivals.</p>
<p>Instead, the government continued to boast its early ban on non-Australian citizens or travel restrictions on students coming from China was an example of best practice that had protected the country and slowed the spread.</p>
<p>But this should only have been a modest beginning to an urgent and far more dramatic and targeting of all arrivals. After all, this government – especially you, Minister – have repeatedly boasted of Australia’s tough border controls and national security measures.</p>
<p>You were even able to persuade your colleagues to combine a range of responsibilities and extra revenue into the creation of a supra Department of Home Affairs, with you as minister and the equally tough-sounding Mike Pezzullo as secretary, to oversee crucial matters, including biosecurity.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The federal government’s consistent rationale is it is following the medical advice on &ldquo;proportional&rdquo; measures – as provided by Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy, and the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee of medical experts operating on &ldquo;consensus&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That medical advice has consistently proven too little too late in terms of public health measures being effective quickly enough, leading to the states now going their own way.</p>
<p>Besides, you of all ministers usually advocate going early and hard, even if it means being unpopular, in your determination to prevent even a single case becoming a trend.</p>
<p>No doubt you dismissed as typically unfair criticism the joke circulating on social media that the Coalition had been elected to stop the boats but had failed to stop the one boat that really counted – the Ruby Princess cruise ship.</p>
<p>So you told Ray Hadley last Thursday you would not put the blame on anybody over the debacle that meant 2700 passengers disembarked in Sydney on March 19 with no health checks from the NSW Department of Health or restrictions or contrary advice from Australian Border Force. Both groups have since loudly blamed the other’s handling of the disaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clearly somebody has made an error in relation to this matter, it’s a serious mistake,&rdquo; you said on radio. &ldquo;But I honestly believe hanging somebody out to dry in the current circumstance is not the way to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But surely one way to do it is to take greater national responsibility for greater evidence of co-ordination, competence or sheer common sense in an Australia-wide calamity? This was just the most extreme example of ineffective border controls.</p>
<p>This is now less significant due to strict quarantines lately imposed. Community transmission with no known links to overseas has become the major risk.</p>
<p>Understanding the past is still key to understanding the needs of today and tomorrow. Please help by providing more answers to hard questions.</p>
<p>Regards, Jennifer Hewett

A video has emerged of a Labor MP praising the Chinese government’s handling of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>NSW Labor MP Shaoquett Moselmane has been seen complimenting China’s President Xi Jinping’s “unswerving leadership” in handling the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>China has come under fire for failing to warn the world about coronavirus and silencing doctors who tried to speak up.</p>
<p>Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton says the comments are ‘very disturbing’ and Mr Moselmane must resign and apologise.</p>
<p>“You can’t have an allegiance to another country and pretend to have an allegiance to this country at the same time.</p>
<p>“To be talking from the talking points of the Chinese Communist Party is completely unacceptable.”</p>
<p>Click PLAY below to hear the full interview</p>
<p>Ray Hadley says Mr Moselmane should be held accountable for his “nonsense”.</p>
<p>“The imbecilic utterings you offered should be the reason today you offer your resignation.”</p>
<p>Click PLAY below to hear the full interview</p>
<p>Ray is calling on NSW Labor leader Jodi McKay to address the issue.</p>
<p>“You’re either a leader or you’re not.”
