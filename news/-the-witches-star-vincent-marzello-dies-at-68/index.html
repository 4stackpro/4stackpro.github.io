Actor Vincent Marzello, best known for his roles in “The Witches,” “Superman” and “The Spy Who Loved Me,” died on Tuesday. He was 68.</p>
<p>Marzello’s wife, “Notting Hill” actor Lorelei King, tweeted the news.</p>
<p>“The love of my life, my darling husband Vincent Marzello, died this morning,” she wrote. “To those who knew him, I am sorry to post the news rather than contact you personally, but I am overwhelmed. My heart is broken.”</p>
<p>Marzello most recently lent his voice to the 2017 TV series “The Magical Music Box.” He was a regular on the animated show “Bob the Builder” from 2000 through 2016.</p>
<p>A native of Brooklyn, N.Y., Marzello lived with King in London. He made his acting debut in 1976 in an episode of the TV series “The Brothers.” He has appeared in two James Bond movies, “The Spy Who Loved Me” and “Never Say Never Again.” Marzello is best remembered for playing Luke’s father in Nicolas Roeg’s 1990 film adaptation of Roald Dahl’s “The Witches.”</p>
<p>In 2009, while being treated for cancer, Marzello was diagnosed with dementia. In February, in a blog written for Dementia U.K. on World Cancer Day, King wrote, “In 2009, I never imagined that I would see an upside to my husband’s diagnosis of cancer — but I am grateful that it ultimately led to the diagnosis of his young-onset dementia.”</p>
<p>“But during his cancer treatment, medical professionals were finally observing him very closely and it was clear to them that there was something wrong. ‘How long has he had dementia?’ they asked — the first time anyone had said that to me — and, as horrifying as it was to hear, it brought a kind of relief, because we had finally named it.”</p>
<p>“We postponed formal diagnosis, because first we had to put out the fire that was right in front of us: the cancer,” King wrote. “This involved surgery, a catastrophic complication, more surgeries, months of chemotherapy — a process difficult enough to go through, made even more difficult by the dementia.”

<h3 id="vincent-marzello-dies-james-bond-and-superman-actor-was-68">Vincent Marzello Dies, James Bond and Superman Actor Was 68</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn3.movieweb.com/i/article/ZE2HFDnH8v4EVaXsdp2ynsqcNsDAFG/1200:100/Vincent-Marzello-Dead-James-Bond-Superman.jpg" alt="img">
Sad news today as it is being reported that James Bond and Superman actor Vincent Marzello has passed away at the age of 68. The tragic announcement came from Marzello&rsquo;s wife, Lorelei King, who broke the news of the actor&rsquo;s passing on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The love of my life, my darling husband Vincent Marzello, died this morning. To those who knew him, I&rsquo;m sorry to post this news rather than contact you personally, but I am overwhelmed. My heart is broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though she did not share any details surrounding the death of her husband, she let friends and supporters know that he had passed on via a post on social media. Despite an official cause of death not being given, it has been reported that Marzello was being treated for cancer in 2009. Following his successful treatment, he was diagnosed with early-onset dementia.</p>
<p>Vincent Marzello was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, back in 1951, and began his acting career in the mid-1970s, first appearing in the TV series The Brothers, a British television series, produced and shown on the BBC between 1972 and 1976. He then followed that up with a number of fairly minor roles on the small screen before he decided to make the leap to the big screen and motion pictures.</p>
<p>Marzello appeared twice in the James Bond franchise, the first time as an unnamed crewman in 1977&rsquo;s The Spy Who Loved Me which starred Roger Moore as the iconic secret agent. His second appearance in the hugely popular Bond series was in the role of Culpepper in 1983&rsquo;s &ldquo;unofficial&rdquo; Bond flick Never Say Never Again starring Sean Connery.</p>
<p>Marzello then bounced back and forth between movies and television, alternating guest roles with bit parts in several high-profile releases including Richard Donner&rsquo;s comic book outing Superman starring Christopher Reeve as the Man of Steel.</p>
<p>In addition to his work in the James Bond franchise, Marzello also appeared as Luke&rsquo;s Father in director Nicolas Roeg&rsquo;s dark fantasy comedy The Witches, the 1990 adaptation of Roald Dahl&rsquo;s 1983 novel of the same name. During the 90s, Marzello also appeared in movies such as A Kid in King Arthur&rsquo;s Court, The Fragile Heart and the ode to 1970&rsquo;s glam rock, Velvet Goldmine starring Ewan McGregor and Jonathan Rhys Meyers.</p>
<p>More recently, Marzello has lent his voice to several different animations and video game projects, with the most prominent being that of the U.S. version of beloved children&rsquo;s show Bob the Builder, in which he voiced the characters Robert and Farmer Pickles. Sadly, Marzello isn&rsquo;t the only name behind Bob the Builder to pass away in recent weeks. William Dufris, who voiced the titular construction worker in the series, died earlier this month at the age of 62. Dufris passed away on March 24 from complications of cancer which was announced by Pocket Universe Productions, the company he co-founded.</p>
<p>Marzello&rsquo;s last credited role was in the family fantasy series The Magical Music Box. He is survived by his wife, actress Lorelei King. May he rest in peace. This comes to us from Lorelei King&rsquo;s Twitter account.</p>

&lsquo;Tommy Boy’ turns 25</p>
<p>“Tommy Boy,” the 1995 movie starring the late Chris Farley and David Spade, came out 25 years ago today (March 31, 1995). The road trip comedy followed Tommy (Farley), a recent college graduate (barely) trying to save the family auto parts business after his father dies on his wedding day, and featured popular quotes like “Holy shnikes” and “That’s gonna leave a mark.” E! News shared 25 little-known facts about the movie, including how Rob Lowe wasn’t credited; Matthew McConaughey auditioned for it; “Fat guy in a little coat” was improvised by Farley and Spade at “Saturday Night Live&rdquo;; and much of the story changed from its original script, including the title, which had to be changed from “Billy the Third: Midwestern” because another former “SNL” star, Adam Sandler, had recently done “Billy Madison.”</p>
<p>The Witches actor Vincent Marzello dead</p>
<p>“The Witches” actor Vincent Marzello is dead at age 68, his wife, actress Loreli King, announced Tuesday.
