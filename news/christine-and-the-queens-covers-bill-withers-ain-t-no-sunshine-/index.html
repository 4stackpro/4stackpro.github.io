Christine And The Queens his paid tribute to the late Bill Withers, covering ‘Ain’t No Sunshine’ on Instagram.</p>
<p>Withers suffered heart complications and died on Monday (March 30), his family confirmed yesterday (April 3). He was 81 years old.</p>
<p>Figures from across the music and entertainment world have paid tribute to Withers since the news of his passing, and Héloïse Letissier has now shared her version of one of Withers’ most famous songs.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“Bye Bill,” she wrote on Instagram. Watch the performance below.</p>
<p>Tributes have been pouring in for Withers since the announcement of his death. Brian Wilson, Lenny Kravitz, Nile Rodgers, Jennifer Hudson and Graham Coxon have all shared their memories of the star.</p>
<p>An NME obituary described Withers as “the reluctant star whose songs were as understated as his genius”.</p>
<p>“Bill Withers’ life was a lesson in being able to take or leave other people’s assessments of your success, and he was all the stronger for it.”</p>
<p>Christine And The Queens has been sharing a series of quarantine covers as she self-isolates due to coronavirus. Over the past few weeks she’s posted versions of The Weeknd’s ‘Blinding Lights’ and Steve Lacy’s track ‘N Side’.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Letissier recently spoke to NME about her new EP ‘La Vita Nuova’, the prospect of collaborating with Tame Impala‘s Kevin Parker and more. Read the interview here.</p>
<p>NME called the surprise new EP “an astonishing and emotional sucker-punch” in a five-star review.

<h3 id="christine-and-the-queensinstagram">Christine and the Queens/Instagram</h3>
<p><img src="https://theartsdesk.com/sites/default/files/favicon.ico" alt="img">
Since she burst onto the global scene in 2014 with her debut album, Chaleur humaine, Christine and the Queens&rsquo; (aka Chris, real name Héloïse Letissier) work has been difficult to pin down. Is the French pansexual singer-songwriter-performance artist&rsquo;s music synth-pop, alt-pop or, as she describes it, “freakpop”?</p>
<p>No matter, because her records – the latest is February&rsquo;s surprise release of a six-track EP, La Vita Nuova, about a difficult time in her life – prove that she is endlessly inventive, both with music and lyrics (Letissier&rsquo;s as happy speaking and singing in English as she is in French). In addition, her work always packs an emotional and sensual punch that has won her an army of fans worldwide, with whom she regularly corresponds on social media.</p>
<p>So it was no surprise that Letissier has for the past week or so reached out during the coronavirus lockdown worldwide, posting regular updates on her Instagram account with performances recorded in Studios Ferber near where she lives in Paris. She promises to help her fans through “the ennui” of #ensemblealamaison (together at home).</p>
<p>The posts vary in length from a few minutes to a quarter of an hour, from a brief written message to songs from the new EP (performed beautifully to just a piano accompaniment), and some cracking covers (including The Weekend&rsquo;s “Blinding Lights”). Oh, and a post of Letissier dancing as if nobody&rsquo;s watching to Childish Gambino&rsquo;s “Time”.</p>
<p>And while she can&rsquo;t recreate the spectacle of her astonishing, life-affirming shows, there&rsquo;s all the playfulness that we have come to expect of Letissier – one post is a simple message about looking after animals while she is seated beside an animatronic tiger; in another the Frenchwoman, who is joyously expressive of her sexuality, sings Steve Lacy&rsquo;s “N Side” (“My darling / Inside, inside, tell me, is it inside?”), sitting astride a chair, Christine-Keeler-like. I&rsquo;m guessing most people watching – male or female, gay or straight – would envy that chair.</p>
<p>Also worth catching before it disappears from BBC Sounds on Friday 3 April is the session Letissier recorded for Annie Mac&rsquo;s Radio 1 show – five tracks from the new EP – just before lockdown in Paris.</p>
<p>She told Mac of her need to keep busy, so – apart from releasing Instagram cadeaux to her fans during the lockdown – Letissier revealed she is writing new material.</p>
<p>“It&rsquo;s weird as it was not expected [that I would] write another album right now, but I&rsquo;m making the most of the situation,” she said. “And creatively [the lockdown] sparks a dystopian perspective and you start to dream about creepy musicals and things like that.” I can&rsquo;t wait for the result.

<h3 id="christine--the-queens-on-her-dream-collaborations-i-love-kevin-parker-from-tame-impala">Christine &amp; The Queens on her dream collaborations: “I love Kevin Parker from Tame Impala”</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/christine_Tame_2000.jpg" alt="img">
Christine &amp; The Queens‘ Héloïse Letissier has named Tame Impala, MGMT and Rosalia as the artists that she’d love to collaborate with.</p>
<p>Letissier was speaking to NME about working on her new album while practising social distancing at home in Paris, when we asked her about who she’s itching to work with in the future.</p>
<p>“I’m super shy so I need to be comfortable with them,” she replied. “I can’t just write to them out of the blue and say, ‘Hey, let’s collab’. I don’t know how to do that shit. I love Kevin Parker from Tame Impala and am obsessed with his work. I don’t know if it will ever happen. I love MGMT and would love to do something with them too.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>“Like everyone else on earth, I love Rosalia too. If she wanted to I could write a fucking movie for her. She’s really consistent and super charismatic.”</p>
<p>This comes after Chris worked with Caroline Polachek on the title track from her recent EP and short film ‘La Vita Nuova’.</p>
<p>“I’ve been a long time fan of hers,” Chris told NME. “I loved Chairlift and loved her solo record ‘Ramona Lisa’ when it first came out. At some point we crossed paths, she was super nice and we exchanged numbers. We’ve been loosely talking since then. After my collaboration with Charli [XCX, ‘Gone‘] we talked again and it all just happened very spontaneously. She was in Paris for Fashion Week and I was working on the EP. Since ‘La Vita Nuova’ is a quite a camp love song, I immediately thought of Caroline.”</p>
<p>Chris added: “In my head, she was the only one who I could imagine singing in Italian, being classy about it and making it look normal.”</p>

<p>Check out our full interview with Christine &amp; The Queens here, where she also discusses work on her “hopeful, spacious and ambitious” new album, and what’s keeping her sane in self-isolation.</p>
<p>Christine &amp; The Queens has recently been delivering intimate performances from her home while in lockdown, and has also shared covers of ‘Blinding Lights’ by The Weeknd and Steve Lacy’s ‘N Side‘.
