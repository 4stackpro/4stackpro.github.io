<h3 id="netflixs-the-big-show-show-season-1-review">Netflix&rsquo;s The Big Show Show: Season 1 Review</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2020/04/01/122630epm6dyxf-1585771619572.jpg?width=1280" alt="img">
&ldquo;Welllll&hellip;it&rsquo;s a sit-com!&ldquo;Despite many folks online, about a month back, thinking Netflix&rsquo;s The Big Show Show was some type of goof/prank, it&rsquo;s very very real. Quasi-retired WWE Superstar Paul &ldquo;Big Show&rdquo; Wight is the lead of a new family comedy where he plays a fictionalized version of himself as an ex-wrestler attempting to start the second (or third) act of his life as stay-at-home dad and husband in Tampa.</p>

<p>Naturally, this project has the potential to be either wholly terrible or fully great. The truth, overall, lies somewhere in between as Big Show proves himself to be an amiable, glowing, towering &ldquo;family man&rdquo; capable of carrying multi-cam sitcom shenanigans. Of course, the caveat here is that The Big Show Show is a broad and earnest family comedy. It&rsquo;s not meant to be shrewd or biting; it&rsquo;s warm and cuddly - something parents can watch with their young kids and not utterly despise.Younger-skewing sitcoms can be done well, obviously. Whether we&rsquo;re talking &rsquo;80s greats like Different Strokes or Growing Pains or more recent basic cable fare like Nick&rsquo;s iCarly and Victorious, or Disney&rsquo;s Wizards of Waverly Place or Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody. The Big Show Show is nestled somewhere in the middle, as &rsquo;80s comedies tended to traipse into the darkened theater of &ldquo;Very Special Episodes&rdquo; where they&rsquo;d tackle drugs, sexual assault, and even serial killers (yes, I&rsquo;m looking at you, Punky Brewster). Latter day teen/family shows got serious too, but not like they did decades ago.The Big Show Show lightly touches on conflict and challenge, but it&rsquo;s too saccharine to do anything more with it than provide traditional sitcom beats. That&rsquo;s not an awful thing, it just is what it is. It&rsquo;s a show that won&rsquo;t drive parents crazy, though it&rsquo;s also not one of the truly great family shows to binge.Also, keep in mind that wrestling fans (like myself) will engage with this in a different way and curiosity will drive a ton of viewing. And then those who only know Big Show as a cursory pop-culture character might still get a kick out of the fact that - well - the man&rsquo;s huge. Yes, there&rsquo;s a wee bit of joy to be derived from seeing someone so big interact with others who only come up to his navel. It&rsquo;s just a dichotomy that works, and helps to separate this particular show from the rabble.Story-wise, Show (he&rsquo;s referred to as &ldquo;Show&rdquo; by his family on the series, as he is in real life) struggles to come to terms with his retirement from WWE while his strong-willed teen daughter, Lola (Reylynn Caster), from a previous marriage, and colder climate, comes to live with him and his wife and kids in Tampa. While Show bounces around from autograph gigs to attempts at a new career, Lola tries to adjust to her new setting and sisters. Show&rsquo;s other two daughters, dramatic Mandy (Lily Brooks O&rsquo;Briant) and scheming J.J. (Juliet Donenfeld), don&rsquo;t work quite as well as the Show/Lola relationship because they&rsquo;re both bigger and wackier sitcom personalities. They&rsquo;re good, but their heightened nature is more meant to color the Lola arc.Show&rsquo;s wife, Cassy (Allison Munn), comes very close to becoming a typical &ldquo;mom of four when you count the husband as an extra child&rdquo; type, but The Big Show Show wisely gives her some foibles and fumbles of her own so that she&rsquo;s not the cliched bad cop. In fact, the most mature character on the show is Lola, which makes sense given her gently-broken home circumstances.I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t mention Jaleel White, Family Matters&rsquo; esteemed Urkel, in a recurring role here as Terrence Malick (a nod to&hellip;the director?), Show&rsquo;s perky pal and local health club owner. White&rsquo;s a fun partner in crime for a few of Show&rsquo;s off-book antics and he&rsquo;s giving an admirably anti-Urkel performance as a fast-talking fool. In a strange way, even given Show&rsquo;s mammoth size, White lends some weight to the proceedings.

<h3 id="where-is-the-big-show-show-filmed-netflix-show-filming-location">Where is The Big Show Show Filmed? Netflix Show Filming Location</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/3645212-thebigshowshows1_non_april20200305-6318-z4mezz.jpg" alt="img">
‘The Big Show Show’ is not the kind of television show that you would imagine it to be. There are no brutal wrestling matches or threatening showdowns. Instead, ‘The Big Show Show’ is a series that will warm your heart. Confused? ‘The Big Show Show’ employs a known template, which turns out to be extremely effective for the comedy series. Think of TV shows like ‘Marlon’ or even ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm.‘ Both these shows, and ‘The Big Show Show’ feature a celebrity playing a fictionalized version of themself.</p>
<p>‘The Big Show Show’ sees Paul Wight, better known by his WWE stage name, Big Show play a fictionalized version of himself. On the sitcom, Wight plays the role of a family man: a loving husband, and father of three daughters. In this regard, ‘The Big Show Show’ is much more similar to ‘Marlon’ than ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm.’ In reality, Paul Wight is also married with three children.</p>
<p>Allison Munn, from ‘One Tree Hill’ and ‘That 70s Show,’ essays the character of Big Show’s wife on the show. Other cast members include Jaleel White, Reylynn Caster, and Juliet Donenfeld.</p>
<p>The Big Show Show Filming Location</p>
<p>‘The Big Show Show’ is a sitcom that follows several tropes of the genre. One of the tropes that viewers would have noticed is the fact that most of the action of the show takes place in multiple, frequently depicted locations. One of the most common settings is Big Show’s house, unsurprisingly, since ‘The Big Show Show’ is a family sitcom. Hence, it is natural for viewers to wonder where the comedy series is filmed.</p>
<p>Los Angeles, California</p>
<p>‘The Big Show Show’ is filmed entirely in Los Angeles, California, on a soundstage. To be more specific, filming for ‘The Big Show Show’ is carried out at Paramount Pictures Studio on 5515 Melrose Avenue in L.A.</p>
<p>Spread over 6 acres, Paramount Pictures Studio boasts of thirty stages. Have a look at the following Instagram post by Allison Munn. It proves how ‘The Big Show Show’ is filmed at Paramount Pictures Studio.</p>
<p>As you can see in the above video, the soundstage is divided into multiple sections to stand in for various rooms of Big Show’s house. The video also depicts how filming is carried out in front of a live studio audience, as evidenced by the cheering. Moreover, the sitcom uses a multi-camera set up to record the action from various angles.</p>
<p>Generally, a single sitcom episode takes anywhere between three to six hours of filming. Often, a single scene is recorded multiple times with various tweaks made to the script for each re-take. This is done so that the makers can select the funniest lines to go on-air.</p>
