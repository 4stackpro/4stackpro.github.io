Kent Sepkowitz is a CNN medical analyst and a physician and infection control expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.</p>
<p>(CNN) New York state reached a tragic milestone this week: It now has more Covid-19 patients than any country in the world, aside from the United States.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s total of 181,026 cases, as of April 11, is higher than Spain&rsquo;s (161,852 cases) and Italy&rsquo;s (152,271), countries with populations many times larger than New York.</p>
<p>The disease is killing New Yorkers disproportionately. Of the 20,389 deaths in the United States, 8,627, or 42%, have occurred in New York. Its mortality rate is 4.7%, compared with 3.4% in the rest of the country, according to CNN&rsquo;s figures based on data from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering</p>
<p>New York City and its suburban counties — Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and Rockland — are responsible for 93% of the statewide case count. Furthermore, in New York City, the Covid-19 death rate is about 6% higher than most countries.</p>
<p>Why does New York seem to be having a different epidemic from most other parts of the country?</p>
<p>Is the reason simply population size and density? New York is by far the nation&rsquo;s most populous city, with more than 8 million people, twice as many as Los Angeles. But New York also has eight or nine times more cases than any other city — so what gives? No other city or county has a fraction of the cases of New York City.</p>
<p>A caution on numbers: Counting cases and mortality rates is difficult because most counting is done by county or borough or parish rather than city, and city of residence may differ from city of diagnosis or death. Even so, New York City is off the charts.</p>
<p>How about population density? Covid-19 spreads most easily when people are packed together — in churches or cruise ships, in outdoor events like concerts or Mardi Gras, or perhaps in small apartments with multiple roommates or large families. New York&rsquo;s population density , about 27,000 people per square mile, is easily the highest in the country, though it&rsquo;s nowhere near the top for cities across the globe. Many cities — in Asia, for example — have a density of nearly 40,000 people per square mile.</p>
<p>The density explanation may explain some of the difference, but not all of it. New York&rsquo;s densest borough is Manhattan, while relatively sprawling Queens sits at fourth out of five. But Queens has more than twice the cases and twice the rate of cases as Manhattan.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because so much testing is being done in New York. If you test more, you find more, and if you find more, you test even more. It is likely that more tests, and more tests per population, are performed in New York than elsewhere in the United States, and that the New York rate stacks up favorably to countries with aggressive testing programs, such as Iceland and South Korea and Germany, but comparative information is sketchy. The split between tests performed by public versus private labs has made accurate tracking just about impossible, despite the heroic efforts of such groups as Covidtracking.com Worldometers , and Our World in Data.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the current advice — stay home if you are sick but stable and don&rsquo;t be tested — introduces additional uncertainty. This pales in comparison to the clear evidence of deaths at home likely due to Covid-19 but never diagnosed. So yes, New York City probably is testing at a brisker pace than elsewhere and yes, this may contribute to the high case numbers, but we will never have an accurate picture.</p>
<p>The high number of cases and rates likely do derive in some modest amount to each explanation above — plus the fact that the epidemic has been in New York City a week or two longer than many other places. A more mature epidemic is always a larger epidemic.</p>
<p>More concerning is the elevated mortality rate in New York City. As has been well documented, some of this is due to the tragic overwhelming of the city&rsquo;s hospitals. We will never know just how many people died due to the country&rsquo;s inept preparation for the pandemic, but the impact surely was, and still is, substantial.</p>
<p>Still, a mortality rate of about 6% is quite high, even though most countries, particularly in western Europe, have seen mortality rates rise as the pandemic drags on. As patients who have hung on for weeks have begun to die, and the rate of new cases has slowed, this tilts the proportion of fatal cases.</p>
<p>New York City also has had a very male outbreak ; substantially more men have been diagnosed, hospitalized and have died, in keeping with data seen in other countries.</p>
<p>Sadly, the likeliest explanation for the high death rate, though, is the chronically inadequate health care given to minorities and the poor throughout New York City, as in the rest of the country. New York City and New York state have only now released the race distribution of cases and deaths, as well as by zip code, a surrogate for poverty rates. It is clear that severe disease has not been distributed equally by race and ethnicity.</p>
<p>Black and Hispanic New Yorkers represent 51% of the city&rsquo;s population, yet account for 62% of Covid-19 deaths. They have twice the rate of death compared with whites, when adjusted for age. This likely is due to both a higher proportion of black and Hispanic New Yorkers being diagnosed with severe disease and a higher rate of death among those who are known to be infected.</p>
<p>This disparity likely is the result of several factors. Co-morbid conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, are strongly associated with death from Covid-19 and are more common in black and Hispanic communities. But what causes high rates of poorly controlled hypertension and diabetes? Lack of appropriate health care. People who cannot easily find good health care for reasons of money, time, location, or trust may be more likely to stay at home undiagnosed and spread the virus — as well as experience potentially fatal delays in diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<p>The explanation is the same for New York City as for Italy, New Orleans and probably Iran: the virus exploits weaknesses in health and health care, be it advanced age or co-morbidity or access to care.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the Covid-19 pandemic will force us to reckon honestly with the many shortfalls that have been exposed and build a fair, forward-thinking approach that allows doctors and nurses to care for people in need. Failure to do this will only further darken the memory of those who have died and the hearts of those who remain.

<p>By last Tuesday, the death toll from coronavirus in New York City had passed that of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center.</p>
<p>The figure was reached only three weeks after the first coronavirus death in the city.</p>
<p>The outbreak has placed New York at the centre of the global pandemic and put an unprecedented strain on the city&rsquo;s emergency workers and frontline staff.</p>
<p>Over the course of Tuesday, six of those people - two doctors, an undertaker, two senior care home staff and a food delivery worker - kept diaries of their day and shared them with the BBC.</p>
<p>This is their story.</p>
<p>Midnight, Tuesday 7 April</p>
<p>Kathleen Flanagan returns from a late shift at a nursing home. The TV is on in the living room, playing the sitcom That &rsquo;70s Show. As has become the custom in her household she shouts &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; to let her family know that she is home and to make sure they avoid contact with her.</p>
<p>She heads downstairs into the laundry room, takes off her clothes and showers.</p>
<p>Everything she has worn at work must go into the washing machine before she sees her husband and children.</p>
<p>When she heads back up the stairs, she is greeted by a bouquet of sunflowers in the kitchen. A card from her eight-year-old son reads: &ldquo;Keep kicking butt Mom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two of her three sons are asleep on the couch waiting for her. She cooks eggs and spinach for dinner and shares details of her day with her husband - the good news is that coronavirus patients in one of the centres she oversees are starting to look better, but in another the situation is getting worse.</p>
<p>She opens her laptop to do some work and falls asleep somewhere between 01:00 and 02:00.</p>
<p>01:57</p>
<p>Doctor Jennifer Haythe is woken by a call from the intensive care unit at her hospital, letting her know about a Covid-19 patient whose condition is deteriorating.</p>
<p>The 46-year-old hangs up the phone and tosses and turns in bed, worrying about the patient. She rethinks the plan for them and then is met by the increasingly familiar feeling of loneliness.</p>
<p>Like many healthcare professionals working with coronavirus patients, Jennifer is living separately from her family. She is staying in an apartment in Greenwich Village, while her husband and children are in their house upstate.</p>
<p>Faced with an eerie silence outside and missing her loved ones, she does a deep breathing exercise: &ldquo;In for four, hold for seven, out for eight.&rdquo; It must work because she falls asleep.</p>
<p>02:00</p>
<p>Outside the city, in the New York state town of Corinth, Faith Willett, a director of nursing at a care home, is woken by a member of staff reporting a high fever. She advises her to self-isolate and contact a doctor as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Faith feels sick and struggles to fall back to sleep. She scrolls through her phone to see the latest news on the coronavirus outbreak, paying close attention to local updates that might be worrying residents and their families.</p>
<p>Image copyright Reuters Image caption In deserted Times Square, a Muslim woman prays on Tuesday</p>
<p>The news feels so surreal that the 46-year-old nurse wonders if she&rsquo;s asleep. She wakes her husband to ask if she&rsquo;s dreaming. &ldquo;No, babes, you&rsquo;re awake,&rdquo; he replies. He tells her to get some rest.</p>
<p>After a few hours of disturbed sleep, she wakes to her alarm. She grabs her computer and scans the latest updates from her colleagues. She can breathe a sigh of relief. There are no confirmed cases - for now.</p>
<p>05:00</p>
<p>Funeral director Steven Baxter is already out of the house. His hours have completely changed since the virus struck, as he and funeral workers across New York struggle to keep up with the rising number of fatalities.</p>
<p>The days of wearing a suit to work are gone. He now dons &ldquo;scrubs&rdquo; that he can throw out afterwards, without risking cross-contamination. The trainers he wears to work are always kept outside.</p>
<p>He sets off to a nursing home, where he has to collect the body of yet another coronavirus victim. It is the first of several such visits he will have to make that day.</p>
<p>06:30</p>
<p>Back in Greenwich Village, doctor Jennifer Hayth wakes up to her alarm. She opens her eyes with the fleeting hope that the past few weeks have been a bad dream.</p>
<p>She has a shower and gets ready for work. There are no dogs for her to walk, no husband to kiss goodbye and no children to prepare breakfast for.</p>
<p>She heads to a coffee shop where a woman walking her dog notices her doctor&rsquo;s uniform and thanks her. In the cafe, the only other customer - a retired police officer - pays for her coffee.</p>
<p>Image caption Nursing home worker Kathleen (L), doctor Jennifer (C), delivery driver Sarujen (R)</p>
<p>The Cat Stevens song Peace Train comes on the radio as she drives to work at Columbia University Medical Center. She hasn&rsquo;t heard it for a while and it makes her feel energised. She looks over the highway at the USNS Comfort - a Navy hospital ship docked in New York City where coronavirus patients are being treated - and thinks to herself that it seems almost majestic.</p>
<p>Arriving at work, she puts on her mask, gown, gloves and other equipment required for working with coronavirus patients and heads over for another day in the ICU.</p>
<p>07:00</p>
<p>Nurse Kathleen Flanagan wakes to a hug from her eight-year-old son. Before she leaves the house, he performs a dance to the song High Hopes by the band Panic! At the Disco.</p>
<p>She listens to it again in the car, applying the lyrics to her own life.</p>
<p>Mama said don&rsquo;t give up, it&rsquo;s a little complicated&hellip;</p>
<p>Had to have high, high hopes for a living</p>
<p>As she listens to the song, she passes the traffic light where last month she received a phone call that changed everything. A colleague at a nursing and rehabilitation centre in New York City told her that two residents had fevers and respiratory symptoms - the first signs of coronavirus in any of the six facilities she oversees.</p>
<p>She was heading to a different centre at the time and was faced with the decision of whether to help remotely or change her plans and put herself on the frontlines of the outbreak. She turned her car around.</p>
<p>Her normal job does not include direct patient care. But three weeks later, she continues to take a hands-on role at the centres with coronavirus patients in spite of the risks.</p>
<p>08:45</p>
<p>At another nursing home in Glens Falls, New York, Faith Willett has been at work for about an hour and there is already cause for concern.</p>
<p>Before leaving the house this morning, she said her personal mantra aloud to herself in the shower: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got this.&rdquo; Like every day in recent weeks, she hoped there would be no signs of coronavirus in the centre.</p>
<p>But as a nurse walked out of a resident&rsquo;s room during the routine morning checks, Faith could tell from her eyes it was bad news - the resident had a high temperature and was getting short of breath while reading her Bible.</p>
<p>Image caption Coronavirus has forced carers like Faith Willett to go against all their natural instincts</p>
<p>All the staff at the home know this might end up being the day the virus made its way in. Masks need to be issued and the door to the resident&rsquo;s room must be closed, with only designated caregivers in full protective equipment allowed in.</p>
<p>Faith considers the order.</p>
<p>You should never close a door to a resident&rsquo;s room unless they ask you to - it&rsquo;s a violation of their rights; it&rsquo;s forced isolation; it&rsquo;s mistreatment, she thinks. But she reminds herself that they must go against all their instincts as caregivers to save lives.</p>
<p>A nurse in full protective equipment goes into the room to perform the test. There are tears in the nurse&rsquo;s eyes but they soften as she walks in. She completes the test, packages it and takes it to the lab. Faith admires the woman&rsquo;s bravery for being able to do it.</p>
<p>09:00</p>
<p>Steven Baxter is sorting through death certificates and other documentation at Gannon Funeral Home in Manhattan. The phone line has just opened so he is preparing for another day of calls from families who have lost loved ones to the virus.</p>
<p>The 53-year-old recently converted the chapel in the funeral home into a morgue. He has a rule: the dead need to be treated with respect and given adequate space. But the number of bodies coming in is hard to keep up with.</p>
<p>Later today he will need to take the bodies of eight Covid-19 patients to be cremated, and to chase a supplier about cremation boxes, which are increasingly in short supply.</p>
<p>It will be about three weeks before the person he collected this morning can be cremated - the pandemic has put a strain on the system, creating major backlogs.</p>
<p>All his days are merging into one at the moment. The &ldquo;removal&rdquo; this morning was like any other in the time of coronavirus - he put on a respirator and other protective equipment, and used disinfectant spray as he worked to ensure he was safely transferring the body.</p>
<p>09:34</p>
<p>People not directly on the frontline are also performing critical jobs to prevent the virus spreading.</p>
<p>Since the pandemic began, doctor Michael Morgenstern has swapped his subway commute for a walk upstairs. This morning, he logs on to video conferencing platform Zoom for his first appointment of the day.</p>
<p>Many of his patients are elderly and part of his role now is explaining the risks of coronavirus to them, and the precautions they should take.</p>
<p>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption People queue at a food distribution centre in Harlem</p>
<p>The first patient wants to go out and visit two other doctors. Michael asks the son, who is also on the call, to try to see if the appointments can be conducted over the phone or through a video platform.</p>
<p>He is concerned about people exposing themselves to the virus and has spent much of his morning up to now working on a petition calling for the public to wear non-medical face masks, in line with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control.</p>
<p>He repeats the mantra &ldquo;an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure&rdquo; to himself as he works.</p>
<p>His legs shake as he begins his second appointment of the day. He&rsquo;s nervous about what&rsquo;s happening in the world.</p>
<p>10:00</p>
<p>Faith Willett gets a call from the nurse who fell ill - she can&rsquo;t get tested and has instead been labelled &ldquo;presumed positive&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Faith is angry about the lack of testing for a frontline worker. She worries that the residents may have been exposed and then finds herself wondering - selfishly, she thinks - if she too might have been.</p>
<p>Five other people working at the home have been tested for Covid-19 because of symptoms - four were negative and the fifth is pending.</p>
<p>Faith and her colleagues all worry about the same thing: they don&rsquo;t want to be the person who brings the virus into the facility.</p>
<p>11:00</p>
<p>At another nursing and rehabilitation home, Kathleen Flanagan has spent much of the morning checking on residents with coronavirus symptoms.</p>
<p>The hospital calls to discuss returning one long-term resident, assuring her that he is alert and responsive.</p>
<p>Two others are at the hospital. One is not doing well. When asked who his next of kin are, she replies: &ldquo;We are his family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She urges the doctor to fight for him.</p>

<p>11:23</p>
<p>Michael Morgenstern sees his next patient via video call. An elderly person with cancer.</p>
<p>The cancer appears to be spreading but while the patient is continuing with chemotherapy, they are holding off on adding radiation treatment for now because of the Covid-19 risk.</p>
<p>Michael is worried. He advises relatives who are still going outside to consider wearing face masks when they are around the patient.</p>
<p>He continues to see patients and work with volunteers for his coronavirus campaign throughout the morning. One of the patients was born only shortly after the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, he thinks to himself.</p>
<p>12:00</p>
<p>Doctor Jennifer Haythe is carrying out rounds in the ICU. Everyone she sees is a Covid-19 patient. They are all on ventilators.</p>
<p>She passes colleagues but can only see their eyes. In them she sees stress, but also hope and courage.</p>
<p>Image copyright EPA Image caption A patient is transported through Jennifer&rsquo;s hospital in Manhattan</p>
<p>As she attends to sick and dying patients she thinks about what it must be like for them and their families.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hospital without visitors. What is that?&rdquo; she asks herself.</p>
<p>12:30</p>
<p>Sarujen Sivakumar, a 22-year-old Lebanese-born delivery team manager for Eat Offbeat - a catering company led by immigrants and refugees - heads out to work.</p>
<p>Like many businesses across New York, his company has had to re-model amid the pandemic and now sells coronavirus &ldquo;care packages&rdquo; of a week&rsquo;s worth of meals and snacks.</p>
<p>As he begins his journey, he is struck again by how quiet the city is. In the six years since he arrived here as a refugee, he has never seen it like this. There are no groups talking to each other, no performers at the subway station. He feels almost as if he is in a video game.</p>
<p>Before the outbreak, he would greet his colleagues with special handshakes and hugs. But as he walks into the kitchen today, he knows he has to keep his distance.</p>
<p>13:00</p>
<p>At the Glens Falls nursing home, it is visiting time.</p>
<p>Faith and her colleagues bring residents into the dining room where there are big windows through which they can see their relatives.</p>
<p>Families wait outside in their cars and take turns coming to the windows. They have agreed to limit their visits to 10 minutes each.</p>
<p>As emotional reunions take place through the glass, Faith observes the range of tears being shed - joy, laughter, sadness and, of course, fear.</p>
<p>13:45</p>
<p>The chefs at Sarujen&rsquo;s company say they are too scared to take the train to work any more, but also worry about how they would survive financially if the company stops running.</p>
<p>Sarujen knows how hard he and others at the company worked to get where they are today. He worries that if it closes, it won&rsquo;t be the same again in the future.</p>
<p>There is little time to talk about it in depth as they have deliveries to get on with.</p>
<p>14:30</p>
<p>Steven Baxter heads to a funeral home to collect the body of another coronavirus victim.</p>
<p>He received a call the previous day from a man whose father had died. He couldn&rsquo;t afford what the company was charging for a cremation and needed someone else to take over.</p>
<p>As he collects the body, Steven is angry about what he sees as exploitation of victims of a health crisis. He believes the price that was being charged is four times the average in the city.</p>
<p>16:20</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the news everyone had been dreading. The result for the fifth employee tested at Faith Willett&rsquo;s home comes back positive.</p>
<p>She tells herself there&rsquo;s no time to feel - she needs to act.</p>
<p>She begins the difficult process of alerting residents and their families.</p>

<p>17:00</p>
<p>While speaking to a patient earlier in the day who was unable to get a mask, doctor Michael Morgenstern shows him how to fashion one out of a T-shirt.</p>
<p>He decides others may also need to see how to do this so shoots a video and shares it online.</p>
<p>18:00</p>
<p>As Sarujen drops off his last package, he gets a call asking him to join a team meeting about the future of the company.</p>
<p>At the meeting, they agree that the delivery drivers will take the chefs to and from work so they can avoid trains.</p>
<p>He is happy that he can continue working but exhausted from stress over the virus and the day&rsquo;s concerns over his job.</p>
<p>20:00</p>
<p>Steven Baxter returns home from the funeral home but his day isn&rsquo;t over.</p>
<p>His twin sons are playing basketball in the backyard. They ask him if he has to shower. When he says yes, they know what sort of day he must have had.</p>
<p>For the next few hours, he deals with calls from more bereaved families. He doesn&rsquo;t have time to speak with his wife, who is also a funeral director.</p>
<p>He falls asleep before his children. He has to be at another nursing home to collect another body at 04:00.</p>
<p>20:22</p>
<p>Jennifer has a hot bath and is ready to crawl into bed. Even though her hours haven&rsquo;t changed, she feels much more exhausted than before.</p>
<p>As she responds to more texts about patient care, she reviews how she feels. Achy, tired, sore throat. She wonders if she should get tested.</p>
<p>20:40</p>
<p>Faith Willett gets a call from a nurse who says she can&rsquo;t do an upcoming shift. She isn&rsquo;t unwell but news has got around about today&rsquo;s positive result at the nursing home.</p>
<p>The nurse&rsquo;s skills and training are invaluable. Faith can&rsquo;t understand the woman&rsquo;s decision, which she sees as jumping ship at a time of crisis.</p>
<p>21:00</p>
<p>Jennifer watches an episode of TV sitcom Friends. It is all she can manage to watch these days - she struggles to focus on anything too heavy.</p>
<p>She has a goodnight FaceTime with her children before turning out the lights. She hasn&rsquo;t seen them in person for eight days.</p>
<p>As she closes her eyes, she makes a mental note: &ldquo;Thank the cast of Friends when this is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>22:00</p>
<p>Kathleen Flanagan has been home for about an hour. It was the usual routine - a shout of &ldquo;hello&rdquo; to the family again, clothes in the washing machine again, a shower again.</p>
<p>She has time for only one meal a day at the moment. Today it was eggs and spinach, again.</p>
<p>She goes to sleep with The Office playing on Netflix. It is her winding-down time before she has to start again. But her phone stays close in case anyone needs her.</p>
<p>23:58</p>
<p>There are only a few hours before Faith has to start work again. She has been trying to get some rest but is woken by an email reminder from the department of health about an upcoming call about the virus.</p>
<p>There has been no news from her nursing home of new or worsening symptoms. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean she can relax.</p>
<p>Throughout this day, Tuesday 7 April, another 779 people died of coronavirus in New York state - a new high.</p>
<p>This grim record is surpassed again the next day.</p>

New York Has Lost Another 783 Lives To Coronavirus, Cuomo Says</p>
<p>Enlarge this image toggle caption John Minchillo/AP John Minchillo/AP</p>
<p>New York is flattening the curve, but the state still lost 783 lives over the last 24 hours, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at his daily news briefing on Saturday. That marks the fifth straight day of more than 700 deaths per day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are just incredible numbers, depicting incredible loss and pain,&rdquo; Cuomo said.</p>
<p>In total, as of early Saturday, the coronavirus has taken more than 8,600 lives in New York, Cuomo said. The state continues to have, by far, the highest COVID-19 death count in the United States — about four times more than the next hardest hit state, New Jersey.</p>
<p>But there are some glimmers of hope, Cuomo said, noting the daily hospitalization rate is down, as are the number of intubations. Quoting Winston Churchill, Cuomo said that while New York&rsquo;s ordeal isn&rsquo;t anywhere near its end, it is possibly at &ldquo;the end of the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People ask, well, when is it over?&rdquo; Cuomo said. &ldquo;My children ask that every day. I&rsquo;m sure everyone&rsquo;s living with the same question every time you wake up. You say, when does this nightmare end? And everybody wants to hear that it ends in two weeks or three weeks or four weeks, or here&rsquo;s a date that I can tell you that it&rsquo;s over — just give me some certainty, some closure, some control of my life back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The key now, Cuomo said, is to stay the course and keep politics out of the equation as leaders decide when to reopen businesses. Reopening is both a public health question and an economic question, Cuomo said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t ask the people of this state, or this country, to choose between lives lost and dollars gained,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Cuomo said he understands the need to bring back the economy and get people working, but there&rsquo;s also a need to continue saving lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One cannot be at the expense of the other,&rdquo; he said, cautioning that no one knows if there will be a second wave of infections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst thing that can happen is we make a misstep and we let our emotions get ahead of logic and fact, and we go through this again,&rdquo; the governor said.</p>
<p>Cuomo dismissed an announcement made earlier on Saturday by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, that the city&rsquo;s schools would stay closed through the end of the academic year in June.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s [his] opinion,&rdquo; Cuomo said. &ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t close them and he can&rsquo;t open them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cuomo said it was important to coordinate school closings and re-openings statewide — ideally with Connecticut and New Jersey.</p>
<p>Cuomo said New York was recruiting attorneys state-wide to do pro-bono legal assistance on housing issues and Small Business Administration loan applications. He also called for the next federal stimulus bill to be &ldquo;less pork barrel and more targeted.&rdquo;
