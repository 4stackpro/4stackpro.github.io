PETALING JAYA (THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Malaysia&rsquo;s Higher Education Minister Noraini Ahmad has raised eyebrows for proposing a TikTok competition to convince young Malaysians to stay home during the movement control order (MCO).</p>
<p>Malaysians on social media are accusing her of having misplaced priorities.</p>
<p>A one-minute video of her making the suggestion was taken down on Wednesday (April 8) following public backlash.</p>
<p>Social media influencers Norreen and Iskandar Rahman posed as Datuk Noraini&rsquo;s children in the video, which is believed to have been recorded at the ministry&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>The proposed TikTok competition, which was slated to take place from Wednesday to next Tuesday, was also promoted in a poster featuring Dr Noraini, Ms Norreen and Mr Iskandar.</p>
<p>In the video, Dr Noraini is seen gently shaking her head to the dance tune Ke Sana Ke Sini, which features snippets from Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin&rsquo;s speech on the MCO.</p>
<p>Mr Iskandar, clad in a visor and a casual outfit, is seen shuffling to a dance tune in the video until he is interrupted by Ms Norreen, who corrects his dance moves to sync with the hip-hop tune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go wandering. Stay at home. Let&rsquo;s do TikTok videos. I have an interesting prize for the most creative,&rdquo; she says in a mix of Malay and English in the video.</p>
<p>Setiawangsa MP Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad tweeted that the Parit Sulong MP should focus on the welfare of university students.</p>
<p>He said she would be better served thinking about the welfare of students who are worried about what their semester is going to be like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Students who are staying by themselves, some of them are not eating regularly - so focus on that rather than TikTok, &quot; Mr Nik Nazmi tweeted.</p>

<p>Other Malaysians on social media said Dr Noraini might have &ldquo;tried too hard&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not wrong to use TikTok to engage with youngsters in universities. You go where your target audience is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The concept is there, but the execution is bad,&rdquo; tweeted someone with the handle Caleb.

<p><img src="https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/03/15/605615.jpg" alt="img">
AS the new Education Minister, Dr Mohd Radzi Md Jidin’s (pic) focus is to move forward.</p>
<p>He said it is pertinent to plan a good education system.</p>
<p>The Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia supreme council member requested that he be given space and time to look into the various issues facing the country’s education system.</p>
<p>“I will first (carry out research), understand and prioritise the matters that must be handled in depth.</p>
<p>“We will do our best as soon as we can.</p>
<p>“This is a very important and huge ministry.</p>
<p>“We have around 500,000 staff across the country,” he said when clocking in at his new office at the Education Ministry’s 10th floor on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mohd Radzi arrived at the Education Ministry later in the afternoon.</p>
<p>This is because he was returning from the Economic Affairs Ministry after attending his final event at the ministry, where he had served as the deputy minister under the Pakatan Harapan government.</p>
<p>Before meeting with reporters, he had a discussion with the ministry’s top management including Education director- general Dr Habibah Abdul Rahim, secretary-general Datuk Dr Mohd Gazali Abas, deputy secretary-general (development) Datuk Azizan Mohamad Sidin, deputy secretary-general (operations) Mohd Azhan Md Amir, deputy director-general (school operation sector) Adzman Talib and deputy director-general (development and teacher professionalism) Dr Ahmad Rafee Che Kassim.</p>
<p>When asked about the various education issues including the Teaching and Learning of Science and Mathematics in English (PPSMI), the free breakfast programme as well as his hopes for the ministry, Mohd Radzi said it had only been two minutes since he entered the ministry.</p>
<p>“Let me sit down with the officers and analyse the scenarios and understand the situations before I say anything further,” he said.</p>
<p>He will further discuss matters that must be given immediate attention with the ministry’s top management, he said, adding that he is aware of parents’ high hopes in having their children receive the best education.</p>
<p>“They want to see the country’s next generation master various skills besides academics.</p>
<p>“I am humbled to be entrusted with the responsibility of bringing our country’s education system to greater heights by our Prime Minister,” Mohd Radzi added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, newly sworn-in Higher Education Minister Datuk Dr Noraini Ahmad (pic) has pledged to bring the country’s higher education performance to the next level.</p>
<p>“I want to express my thanks to Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin for believing in me and appointing me to helm this post.</p>
<p>“The ministry will try our best to achieve the goals entrusted to us by the Prime Minister,” said Noraini who started her first day as Higher Education Minister with a visit to her new office on Tuesday.</p>
<p>She arrived at the Higher Education Ministry in Precinct 5, Putrajaya at 5.45pm on March 10.</p>
<p>She was met on arrival by Mohd Gazali, Kamel, Mohd Azhan, Azizan as well as Higher Education Department deputy director-general Prof Datuk Dr Mohd Saleh Jaafar.</p>
<p>Noraini said she had not been briefed by Mohd Gazali.</p>
<p>“I just came in today (Tuesday) and have not been briefed yet on any issues.</p>
<p>“After I am briefed, we will put our focus to bring Malaysia’s higher education performance to the next level, locally and internationally,” she told reporters after a walkabout at her office.</p>
<p>When asked about the move to split the Education Ministry, Noraini said: “As mentioned in the Prime Minister’s speech, splitting the Education Ministry into two separate entities can streamline work procedures.”</p>
