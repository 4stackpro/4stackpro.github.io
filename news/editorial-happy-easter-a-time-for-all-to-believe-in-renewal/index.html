Church buildings are silent. Restaurants are closed. Family members who aren’t already under the same roof will not be gathering for a meal of ham or lamb, scalloped potatoes and spring vegetables. The real egg hunts are happening in grocery aisles, not backyards.</p>
<p>This Easter Sunday is very different than any we have experienced in living memory.</p>
<p>The novel coronavirus pandemic has shut down cities, economies and in-person social interaction around the world and casts a shadow more in keeping with the darkness of the Good Friday crucifixion than with the sunrise of the Easter resurrection.</p>
<p>It is a special day for more than 2 billion Christians worldwide and 167 million in the United States, most of whom will be worshiping through remote livestreams or even Zoom, another reminder of what the virus has done to our daily lives.</p>
<p>It is not a religious holiday for others, but it has become a celebration nonetheless.</p>
<p>The holiday involves family gatherings, events for children and the unofficial celebration of the beginning of spring, a traditional time for embracing renewal, rebirth and a sense of hope after a winter of discontent. That’s a hope shared by Iranians in the Nowruz New Year, by Indians during the Holi festival of colors, by Jews marking Passover and by many, many others.</p>
<p>This year, the Easter message of hope and renewal is especially welcome, as the nation heads into what experts believe will be the peak of COVID-19 deaths. For most of us, Easter is the first major holiday we have celebrated since the shutdowns and stay-at-home orders began to constrict our lives. It is a difficult moment for many of us.</p>
<p>It’s a great time to collectively pause and embrace all the good news and all the hope we can find.</p>
<p>The latest projections suggest that the pandemic curve may finally be bending, that the number of deaths — still tragically high — will not be as great as once feared and that a return to something closer to normal may be on the horizon. Our suffering is not in vain and sooner or later a new day will come.</p>
<p>This is not to diminish the Christian good news, the gospel, that “God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life” and that Son “humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.”</p>
<p>Easter is the day in which the hearts of Christians around the world quicken at the words, “He is not here; he has risen” and to respond, “He is risen indeed.”</p>
<p>For Christian believers this is not just another “inspiring story,” because believing the biblical account of the cross changes lives in ways no mere allegory can. But it doesn’t mean it can’t be inspirational for all, especially as we find ourselves struggling against a common enemy.</p>
<p>“A man who was completely innocent offered himself as a sacrifice for the good of others, including his enemies, and became the ransom of the world,” Mahatma Gandhi, a Hindu who changed the world through the political theory of nonviolent resistance, said. “It was a perfect act.”</p>
<p>Our Easter observance this year should be a time to count our blessings for the doctors, nurses, EMTs, first-responders, police officers, grocery store workers, delivery drivers, farmers, truckers and so many others who are putting themselves in harm’s way to keep our lives tolerable.</p>
<p>Let’s also appreciate those who have stayed at home, avoided unnecessary travel and crowds and followed the guidelines from medical experts to reduce the spread of the virus and save lives.</p>
<p>Those Christians who stayed away from crowded sanctuaries this week are the ones who showed faith in the promise that “where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them.” Even if it’s on the internet and the two or three are sitting six feet apart.</p>
<p>Easter is not just a message of hope, but it is not less than that. We will make it through this. Do not lose faith, hold on to hope.</p>
<p>“Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.”</p>
<p>Happy Easter. Welcome, spring.

<h3 id="happy-easter-sunday-2020-songs-messages-and-quotes-to-celebrate-the-day">Happy Easter Sunday 2020! Songs, messages and quotes to celebrate the day</h3>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-1137013084_1586698797.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;crop=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
Expect to eat plenty of chocolate eggs today (Picture: Getty Images)</p>
<p>Today is Easter Sunday – and while the day’s normally one for celebrations and get-togethers (not to mention a lot of chocolate), this year’s Easter is looking rather different in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>With the UK still in lockdown, the usual family get-togethers are off limits, while church services have also moved online, and egg hunts are moving into the back garden.</p>
<p>However that doesn’t mean people can’t mark the day in other ways, and listening to Easter music and sharing online greetings can still take place.</p>
<p>Here’s some suggestions on what you might want to listen to, and how to greet others celebrating the festival.</p>
<p>Top Easter songs</p>
<p>According to Praise Charts, these are the top five songs for Easter 2020:</p>
<p>Christ Our Hope In Life and Death (Matt Papa, Keith Getty, Krystyn Getty)</p>
<p>King Of Kings (Hillsong Worship)</p>
<p>Graves Into Gardens (Elevation Worship, Brandon Lake)</p>
<p>Holy Water (We The Kingdom)</p>
<p>See A Victory (Elevation Worship)</p>
<p>Easter messages and quotes</p>

<h3 id="prince-william-and-kate-middleton-wish-the-nation-a-safe-and-happy-easter">Prince William and Kate Middleton wish the nation a &lsquo;safe and happy Easter&rsquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/12/09/27094106-0-image-a-43_1586681929056.jpg" alt="img">
Members of the royal family have wished the nation a happy Easter via Instagram messages as people celebrate amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Taking to the Kensington Royal Instagram account, Prince William and Kate Middleton, 38, shared a scenic photograph showing bright yellow daffodils in bloom at Kensington Palace.</p>
<p>Alongside the picture, they penned: &lsquo;Wishing you all a safe and happy Easter&rsquo; #StayHomeSaveLives.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And royals fans were quick to send the family their well-wishes too, with messages coming from as far and wide as Australia, America and Israel.</p>
<p>Prince William and Kate Middleton, both 38, have taken to their Instagram account and posted a flowery scene outside of Kensington Palace</p>
<p>Alongside the snap, they penned: &lsquo;Wishing you all a safe and happy Easter&rsquo; #StayHomeSaveLives&rsquo;</p>
<p>Prince William and Kate Middleton carried out their first royal engagement via video call to school children whose parents are working on the frontline on Wednesday (pictured)</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lovely to see this view of your place. Keep safe, from Australia,&lsquo;wrote one, while a second penned: &lsquo;Happy Easter from Israel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Shortly after, Prince Charles, 71, and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, 72, shared a similarly Spring scene at Westminster Abbey on the Clarence House Instagram account and penned: &lsquo;Wishing you all a very Happy Easter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The message continued: Today you can listen to The Prince of Wales reading the Gospel for Easter Day services hosted online by Westminster Abbey and Canterbury Cathedral.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Despite having closed their doors, @westminsterabbeylondon and @no1cathedral will lead prayers for Christians who find themselves separated from their churches during this special Eastertime.</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales, 71, and Camilla, 72, took to the Clarence House Instagram account and shared a similarly Spring scene to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (pictured)</p>
<p>Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall shared a second photo showing Westminster Abbey (pictured)</p>
<p>Alongside the Spring pictures, the royals reminded people they can listen to The Prince of Wales reading thee Gospel for Easter Day services hosted online by Westminster Abbey and Canterbury Cathedral (pictured)</p>
<p>Taking to Instagram, Sarah Ferguson posted a photograph showing a hedge trimmed into the shape of a chicken (pictured)</p>
<p>Alongside the snap, she penned: May today be a day of hope for all and continued strength #spring&rsquo; (pictured)</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Prince recorded a reading of John 20: 1-18 earlier this week, which relates the story of Jesus’ resurrection. The reading can be heard in both a podcast by Westminster Abbey and a video Eucharist service from Canterbury Cathedral.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Princess Eugenie shared a photo to Instagram of a pink blossoming tree and wrote: &lsquo;Happy Easter to you. ⁣To quote Her Majesty&rsquo;s Easter message &ldquo;May the living flame of the Easter hope be a steady guide as we face our future.&rdquo; ⁣</p>
<p>Taking to her own Instagram page, her mother Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, posted a snap of a hedge trimmed into the shape of a chick and captioned the post: &lsquo;May today be a day of hope for all and continued strength #spring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Their messages come after the Queen called for &lsquo;light and life&rsquo; to overcome despair amid the coronavirus crisis as she declared that Easter is &lsquo;not cancelled&rsquo; in a special message Bank Holiday message.</p>
<p>Her Majesty delivered her first Easter audio address, which had the resolute message:</p>
<p>Princess Eugenie, 29, also took to her Instagram account and shared a photo to Instagram of a pink blossoming tree (pictured)</p>
<p>The royal quoted her Majesty&rsquo;s Easter message and penned: &lsquo;May the living flame of the Easter hope be a steady guide as we face our future&rsquo; (pictured)</p>
<p>&lsquo;As dark as death can be - particularly for those suffering with grief - light and life are greater. May the living flame of the Easter hope be a steady guide as we face the future.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The 93-year-old monarch&rsquo;s pre-recorded speech offered support to those marking Easter privately and the wider country, and she said: &lsquo;But Easter isn&rsquo;t cancelled; indeed, we need Easter as much as ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It ended on a positive note: &lsquo;May the living flame of the Easter hope be a steady guide as we face the future.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The speech came after the Queen&rsquo;s televised address to the nation last Sunday when she said by remaining united the country would overcome the virus, and told those in lockdown &lsquo;we will meet again&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Her messages illustrate the importance of the head of the nation appearing at times of crisis to rally the country and keep up morale.</p>
<p>Royal fans were quick to take to the comments section, with well-wishes coming from as far as Australia (pictured)
