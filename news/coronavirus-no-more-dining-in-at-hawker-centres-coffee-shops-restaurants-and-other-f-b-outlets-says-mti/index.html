SINGAPORE - From Tuesday (April 7), people can no longer dine in at food and beverage outlets, including hawker centres and coffee shops, but they can still buy takeaways, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing announced on Friday (April 3).</p>
<p>&ldquo;For food establishments, hawker centres and coffee shops, the only change is no more dine-in. Takeaways will continue,&rdquo; Mr Chan said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to encourage all to bring our clean containers where possible to help reduce the amount of packaging used and be more environmentally sustainable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ministry for Trade and Industry said in a statement that all food and beverage outlets can continue to operate on a takeaway basis or offer delivery services.</p>
<p>The measures are to reduce interactions outside of the household, the MTI said.</p>
<p>For now, the new rule will apply until May 4.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While patrons and delivery drivers can continue to enter the premises to access takeaway services, there will be no dine-in service, and nobody should consume any food or drinks on-site whilst waiting for takeaway food,&rdquo; added the MTI.</p>
<p>&ldquo;F&amp;B outlets that remain open must adhere to the enhanced Safe Distancing Measures in their premises, and minimise crowds by ensuring patrons are spaced at least 1m apart at all times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During a press conference explaining the updated measures, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force tackling the Covid-19 outbreak, said people should head home after running their errands.</p>
<p>They should not sit around at hawker centres to mingle in groups.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that’s the key thing that we will be watching out for, and we will have enforcement agencies out and about, watching out for people who continue to gather in groups,&rdquo; said Mr Wong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there are people who continue to breach these rules, then indeed enforcement action will be taken,&rdquo; he warned.</p>
<p>The National Environment Agency (NEA), which manages hawker centres here, said patrons and visitors buying their takeaway orders should maintain a 1m separation from any other people in the hawker centre.</p>
<p>They should also follow floor queue markings in front of the hawker stalls where available, said NEA.</p>
<p>It also said that all 83 markets managed by NEA or NEA-appointed operators will continue to be open to the public.</p>
<p>“Patrons who are feeling unwell or are sick should refrain from going to the markets and hawker centres,” NEA added.</p>
<p>“We will continue to monitor the situation closely, and may implement further measures for crowd control.”

<h3 id="coronavirus-most-workplaces-to-close-schools-will-move-to-full-home-based-learning-from-next-week-says-pm-lee">Coronavirus: Most workplaces to close, schools will move to full home-based learning from next week, says PM Lee</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/articles/2020/04/03/ycjem030420.jpg?itok=MFNGdcZu" alt="img">
SINGAPORE - Most workplaces will be closed from next Tuesday (April 7) and all schools will move to full home-based learning a day later, as Singapore puts in place a &ldquo;circuit breaker&rdquo; to pre-empt escalating coronavirus infections, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
<p>Except for key economic sectors and essential services - such as food establishments, markets and supermarkets, clinics, hospitals, utilities, transport and key banking services - all other work premises will close, said PM Lee on Friday in an address to the nation on the Covid-19 situation.</p>
<p>All schools and institutes of higher learning will close and move to full home-based learning from next Wednesday, after schools piloted one day of home-based learning this week.</p>
<p>Pre-school and student care services will also be closed, but would provide &ldquo;limited services for children of parents who have to continue working&rdquo;, he said.</p>
<p>Explaining why the Government decided to take such a step, the Prime Minister said Singapore has routinely seen more than 50 new cases daily over the past two weeks, despite best efforts of the authorities to curb the outbreak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Initially, many of the new cases were imported from overseas, mostly returning Singaporeans. Then last week, we began to have more local cases. Furthermore, despite our good contact tracing, for nearly half of these cases, we do not know where or from whom the person caught the virus,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This suggests that there are more people out there who are infected, but who have not been identified. And they may be passing the virus unknowingly to others,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>While the situation remains under control, the Government has decided to &ldquo;make a decisive move now, to pre-empt escalating infections&rdquo;, said PM Lee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking at the trend, I am worried that unless we take further steps, things will gradually get worse, or another big cluster may push things over the edge,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>After discussions with the multi-ministry task force, he said the Government has decided to adopt stricter measures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have decided that instead of tightening incrementally over the next few weeks, we should make a decisive move now, to pre-empt escalating infections. We will therefore impose significantly stricter measures. This is like a circuit breaker,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will help reduce the risk of a big outbreak occurring, and it should also help to gradually bring our numbers down. This in turn will then allow us to relax some of the measures. This circuit breaker will apply for one month, in the first instance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PM Lee said the Government will also tighten restrictions on gatherings.</p>
<p>It boils down to three things, he noted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, stay at home, as much as possible. Second, avoid socialising with others beyond your own household,&rdquo; he said, adding that people should avoid visiting even their extended families who are not staying with them, especially if they are elderly or vulnerable.</p>
<p>Third, people should go out only to do essential things - to buy food at markets, or to take out from restaurants and hawker centres, or to exercise in the neighbourhood park, keeping a safe distance from others, he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The spirit of these measures is to get all of us to minimise physical contact,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t go out, if we avoid contact with others, then the virus won&rsquo;t be able to spread. It is as simple as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a statement, the Health Ministry said the heightened safe distancing measures will be in place for four weeks - two incubation cycles - from April 7 until May 4.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Entities that are able to comply immediately are strongly encouraged to do so. Current safe distancing measures on capacity limits and physical separation remain in force and must be strictly complied with, especially over the weekend,&rdquo; it said.</p>
<p>All attractions, theme parks, museums and casinos will be closed from Tuesday (April 7) as well, the ministry said.</p>
<p>Sports and recreation facilities, such as public swimming pools, country clubs, gyms and fitness studios will also be shut, along with all recreational facilities in hotels.</p>
<p>Organised sporting programmes and religious services will remain suspended as previously announced, while places of worship will also stay closed.</p>
<p>PM Lee also said the Government would no longer discourage people from wearing face masks, in what he described as a re-think on the issue.</p>
<p>Previously, the Government encouraged only those who were unwell to wear face masks, if for instance they left home to see a doctor.</p>
<p>But with signs that the virus is spreading in the community, wearing a mask “may help to protect others”, if the wearer was asymptomatic, he said, adding that the Government will distribute reusable face masks to all households from this Sunday (April 5).</p>
<p>Singapore has been ramping up measures gradually to contain the Covid-19 outbreak, since the first confirmed case was announced here on Jan 23.</p>
<p>Two weeks after the 66-year-old tourist from Wuhan tested positive - and with four of the 33 cases at that point found without any known links to travel of previous cases - the Government raised its disease outbreak response level from code yellow to orange.</p>
<p>The World Health Organisation declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic more than a month later, on March 11.</p>
<p>Measures to minimise the risk of local spread were similarly tightened in phases.</p>
<p>As Singapore started experiencing a second wave, driven by a spike in the number of imported cases, more venues were asked to suspend operations.</p>
<p>On March 24, entertainment venues like bars and cinemas were ordered shut and tuition classes were cancelled. Strict safety distancing precautions were also imposed on places like restaurants and malls that were allowed to stay open, including having patrons sit or queue at least 1m apart.</p>
<p>Singapore had its first two deaths on March 21. To date, there are a total of 1,114 cases and five deaths. A total of 249 patients had recovered as of Thursday.</p>
<p>On Friday, PM Lee said he decided to address the nation to explain the necessity of the latest measures, and also to give the reassurance that things will be alright.</p>
<p>Singapore has enough food supplies to last through this period and beyond, and people can still shop at the supermarket or wet market, he added. &ldquo;You need not rush to stock up for weeks at a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Acknowledging the severe impact the measures would have on workers and businesses, PM Lee said Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat will on Monday (April 6) announce additional support for households and businesses in Parliament, &ldquo;over and above what was provided in the two earlier Budgets&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The next few weeks will be pivotal, he stressed, noting that the number of cases will quite likely still go up in the next few days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if we keep our efforts up, within a few weeks we should be able to bring the numbers down, and get into a more sustainable position,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a long fight. But if any country can see this through, it is Singapore. We have the resources. We have the determination. We are united. By helping one another through this, we will prevail, and emerge stronger.&rdquo;

<h3 id="coronavirus-public-swimming-pools-country-clubs-gyms-fitness-studios-to-close-for-a-month">Coronavirus: Public swimming pools, country clubs, gyms, fitness studios to close for a month</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/articles/2020/04/03/ycgolf030420.jpg?itok=W1-0AAIc" alt="img">
SINGAPORE - Sports will officially grind to a halt in Singapore for four weeks from April 7 to May 4 as the Government implements an elevated set of safe distancing measures as a &ldquo;circuit breaker to pre-empt the trend of increasing local transmission of Covid-19&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On top of other measures, the multi-ministry task force announced yesterday that sports and recreation facilities, such as public swimming pools - including those at 26 Sport Singapore swimming complexes - country clubs, gyms and fitness studios will be closed.</p>
<p>All recreational facilities in hotels will also be closed.</p>
<p>While public parks and 17 SportSG open-air stadiums will remain open, the task force reminded the public to practise safe distancing even in open spaces.</p>
<p>It added: &ldquo;Members of the public who need to exercise should do so on their own, around their immediate neighbourhood in open, uncrowded places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A skeletal team of ActiveSG &ldquo;sport champions&rdquo; will be deployed to prevent overcrowding, and others will ensure minimum levels of maintenance are carried out to preserve serviceability of the public facilities, especially the swimming pools.</p>
<p>In March, bowling centres and billiard halls had already stopped operating, while the public was also discouraged from playing team sports.</p>
<p>On the other hand, local private golf clubs experienced as much as a 15 per cent surge in bookings last month compared to February.</p>
<p>The 2018 Singapore Golf Industry Report had noted there were 46,000 golfers that held membership to the 12 private country clubs here and 55 per cent of them were over the age of 55.</p>
<p>But the Singapore Golf Association told ST that all 15 courses here will be out of bounds from April 7.</p>
<p>Mandai Executive Golf Course general manager Bobby Poh told ST: &ldquo;This means zero revenue for the company, coaches and tenants. However, we must stand by the government decision to close the facilities because we uphold and prioritise social responsibility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are grateful for the government&rsquo;s rental waiver, but we don&rsquo;t know if the closure will be extended. We are also worried about operating costs as we are still paying salaries and high maintenance fees, and are not sure if the government is providing assistance for this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Swiss Club Singapore, which offers aqua biking, karate, tennis and zumba lessons among other recreational activities, is also concerned about the disruption the new measures bring.</p>
<p>Its general manager, Mr Aaron Lim ,said: &ldquo;Yes, we are worried about the future of the club as we are a members&rsquo; club and providing sports and recreation facilities for our members is our main lifeblood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for our staff, those who can work from home will do so, and we would keep minimal kitchen and service staff at our food kiosks. We will comply with the government advisory and close all our sports and recreation facilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But some, like Fit Eleven operations director Kurt Drysdale, had expected the closures and had been prepared for the move since January, when his fitness studio suffered a 25 per cent dip in profits.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;We plan to film online classes for our customers. Around 80 per cent of our instructors are freelancers&hellip; we plan to help them financially by getting them to teach the online classes. I can help some, but not all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swimming academies will also take a huge hit as their business grinds to a halt.</p>
<p>SwimFast Aquatic Group, which has more than 1,000 registered swimmers across venues at three schools, had stopped lessons since March 27 and will comply with the latest directive.</p>
<p>Swimfast managing director David Lim said: &ldquo;We will continue paying our employees, which include 18 full-time coaches and administrative staff, but we cannot afford to do so indefinitely when we are not able to resume lessons. We hope the government is able to help companies like us, even as we figure out ways to cover overhead costs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A SportSG spokesman confirmed with The Straits Times that official training for national athletes will also be suspended, while the Singapore Sports Hub will also shut its sports facilities over the same period.</p>
<p>Singapore Swimming Association president Lee Kok Choy shared that his team of coaches and athletes are working closely to implement training plans and regimens to ensure the athletes are exercising at home, eating right and sleeping right.</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;The focus is to ensure the athletes are in excellent condition to resume full training when the conditions allow.&rdquo;
