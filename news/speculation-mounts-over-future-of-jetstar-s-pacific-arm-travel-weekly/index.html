Rumours of a future change in ownership of Jetstar’s Vietnam-based offshoot have emerged, with reports speculating Qantas could exit its minority stake in the airline.</p>
<p>Multiple reports from international and domestic media have alleged Qantas’ budget airline, Jetstar, is in discussions with its joint-venture partner Vietnam Airlines about the future of Jetstar Pacific.</p>
<p>It follows rumours aired by Vietnamese media that Qantas was moving to exit its 30 per cent stake in the airline.</p>
<p>Jetstar Pacific was established in 2007 under Alan Joyce (then leader of Jetstar) with Vietnam Airlines to build the flying kangaroo’s presence in Asia through the Jetstar brand.</p>
<p>According to VietnamNet, the two owners have been in discussions for “several months” about Vietnam Airlines taking full ownership of Jetstar Pacific, with talks ongoing.</p>
<p>Travel Weekly has reached out to Jetstar for comment.</p>
<p>However, in a statement to the The Sydney Morning Herald, a Jetstar spokeswoman said the airline was “in regular dialogue with our partner Vietnam Airlines about Jetstar Pacific, particularly given the challenges facing all carriers at present”.</p>
<p>“However, we don’t comment on speculation and we have no material changes to announce,” she said.</p>
<p>Oliver Lamb, managing director of Ailevon Pacific Aviation Consulting, told SMH he would not be surprised if Qantas exited Jetstar Pacific at a time when it was looking to save cash and reduce non-core operations.</p>
<p>“Everyone’s been wondering how long Jetstar Pacific’s operations were going to last, and whether or not it’s actually core to what Jetstar wants to achieve in Asia,” he told the outlet.</p>
<p>“If Qantas is looking to release cash or is looking at non-core assets, then Vietnam is probably central to that.”</p>
<p>The speculation over Jetstar Pacific mounts as Vietnam Airlines revealed its plan to divest its reported 49 per cent stake in Cambodia’s Angkor Air, as reported in post-audit notes to the airline’s 2019 consolidated financial statement released on Friday.</p>
<p>According to multiple reports, Vietnam’s national carrier linked the decision to divest in Angkor Air to the impacts of COVID-19 over the last three months.</p>
<p>Airlines internationally have been battered by international and domestic travel bans introduced to arrest the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) yesterday released updated analysis showing that the crisis will see airline passenger revenues drop by US$314 billion ($489 billion) in 2020 – a 55 per cent decline compared to 2019.</p>
<p>On 24 March, IATA estimated US$252 billion ($409.17 billion) in lost revenues (down 44 per cent versus 2019) in a scenario with severe travel restrictions lasting three months.</p>
<p>In Qantas’ case, this has seen the grounding of its entire fleet and the temporary standing down of two-thirds of its 30,000 employees.</p>

<h3 id="will-jetstar-pacific-be-wound-down-qantas-seeks-to-offload-shares">Will Jetstar Pacific Be Wound Down? Qantas Seeks To Offload Shares</h3>
<p><img src="https://simpleflying.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/18551630553_7167dceb63_o.jpg" alt="img">

<p>Qantas is seeking to transfer its 30% stake in Jetstar Pacific to Vietnam Airlines. This would leave Vietnam Airlines with full control of the airline. And, with the Vietnamese market quite saturated, it is possible that the airline is wound down.</p>
<p>Qantas seeks to transfer 30% of shares</p>
<p>VietNamNet reports that Qantas is negotiating to transfer the entirety of Qantas’ shares in Jetstar Pacific to Vietnam Airlines. Currently, the Vietnamese flag carrier holds just under 70% of the carrier while Qantas has the remainder. This transfer would give Vietnam Airlines full control over the carrier.</p>
<p>The last few years have been a bit rough at Jetstar Pacific. In 2011, Jetstar Pacific was on the verge of shuttering amid rough financials. Vietnam Airlines and Qantas collaborated with each other, working to restructure and turn around the low-cost carrier. The carrier has not yet reached its intended state, however, Qantas appears to be pulling out of the carrier.</p>
<p>Advertisement: Featured Video:</p>
<p>The deal is still undergoing negotiations. Neither airline has transferred stakes yet and regulatory approval will likely be needed.</p>
<p>More about Jetstar Pacific</p>
<p>The more popular airline flying under the Jetstar brand is Jetstar Airways which is based in Australia. This is the low-cost arm of Australian flag carrier Qantas. The Jetstar Group network, however, is far-reaching with subsidiaries based in Singapore, Vietnam, and Japan. Jetstar Pacific is the Vietnamese branch.</p>
<p>Unlike Jetstar Airways, the Vietnamese branch only flies Airbus A320ceo aircraft on short- and medium-haul services in the region.</p>
<p>Advertisement:</p>
<p>What could Vietnam Airlines do with Jetstar Pacific?</p>
<p>There are four main carriers based in Vietnam: Bamboo Airways, Jetstar Pacific, VietJet Air, and Vietnam Airlines. VietJet is a major low-cost carrier with huge expansion plans. Furthermore, Bamboo Airways is a startup that is equally ambitious not just with short-haul, but even long-haul aspirations. These forces combined results in a good amount of pressure and competition for Vietnam Airlines.</p>
<p>There are two options for Vietnam Airlines. Firstly, it could absorb Jetstar Pacific into its own operations and retire the brand entirely. This would allow for some market consolidation and give Vietnam Airlines additional A320 aircraft with which to grow its presence. The airline already operates a number of A321 and A321neo aircraft. These aircraft could further supplement long-haul routes flown with Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 aircraft.</p>
<p>The other option would be to operate Jetstar Pacific as a low-cost arm. It is unclear if naming rights would be part of the deal, however. Operating the carrier as a separate low-cost arm would give Vietnam Airlines a two-front approach to combat competition from a full-service and low-cost carrier.</p>
<p>Advertisement:</p>
<p>However, VietJet Air has a large number of aircraft on order and it is unclear if Jetstar Pacific could expand to rival that in enough time to mount serious competition. Or, perhaps, it could just remain a moderately-successful low-cost carrier poking a thorn in the side of VietJet Air.</p>
<p>Do you think Jetstar Pacific should be shut down or remain flying? Let us know in the comments!
