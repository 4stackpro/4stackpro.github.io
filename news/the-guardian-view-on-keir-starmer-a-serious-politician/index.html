Sir Keir Starmer’s arrival as Labour leader is an important moment for British politics. He offers diligence and expertise, not bellowing and finger-pointing. In a crisis this seriousness will be an asset. Sir Keir has unified the party by retaining a tax-and-spend agenda. He also represents a break with the past. There is no resonant phrase, or signature policy, that one can decode to understand the incipient Starmer project. This makes it hard to define what Sir Keir stands for politically. But it is clear what he is not: a populist.</p>
<p>Sir Keir’s victory does signal a more competent and less sectarian approach. Labour’s shadow cabinet has room for defeated rivals, with the leftwing Rebecca Long-Bailey getting education. His apology to the Jewish community is heartfelt and overdue. The symbolism of the three top Labour jobs, the leader aside, being occupied by politicians from the north, Wales and Scotland sends a powerful message that the party aims to represent the whole country. Making a welcome return to the frontline is Ed Miliband, a former party leader and an articulate proponent of the green new deal, who will become shadow business, energy and industrial secretary.</p>
<p>Labour’s frontbench is powered by some prominent members of the People’s Vote campaign. It might have helped to keep a Labour leaver, such as Jon Trickett, on for balance. Although the 2020 Labour leadership contest stretched out over three long months, the Covid-19 pandemic has meant that the hiatus did not give the Conservatives an opportunity to frame Labour as an irrelevance. The Tories have retained a substantial lead in recent opinion polls. This advantage will probably evaporate as the sloppy response from government ministers sinks in.</p>
<p>In an encouraging sign of his professionalism, Sir Keir attacked the government’s shambolic handling of the crisis at the weekend, while offering constructive suggestions for ministers to set out an exit strategy from the lockdown. In the longer run, the Labour leader cannot let coronavirus define his opposition to the government. He will need to respond to the current crises of our age, which have been thrown into sharp relief by the Covid-19 outbreak. A decade of cuts has shredded the welfare safety net and left health and social care systems woefully under-resourced, while the fissuring of the workplace makes it difficult for governments to send help to workers with insecure employment. Sir Keir is right to say that the wealthy must pay a fair share to rebuild a post-coronavirus society.</p>
<p>Corbynism rose as a response to the living standards crisis, a concentration of corporate power and years of austerity. Sir Keir’s project will have to define the question it is the answer to. There is no shortage of pressing issues beyond the pathogen: dealing with growing wealth inequality; a climate emergency; how to bring a fractured United Kingdom back together.</p>
<p>Sir Keir has remade the shadow cabinet. He will want to change the party. His ability to exude Blairite competence and Corbynite idealism will only take him so far. There are precious few clues as to the direction in which he will head. We live in an era when political ambiguity is subject to a level of scrutiny that can brutally punish those who deploy it ineffectually. Sir Keir’s embrace of a programme to transform society and tame capitalism means that his party’s supporters won’t swallow timid policies. The next election is scheduled to be four years away. The country may be very different to the one we live in now. Sir Keir’s job is to make sure that his party’s progressive and radical policies inspire hope, not fear.

<h3 id="what-should-keir-starmer-do-next">What should Keir Starmer do next?</h3>
<p><img src="https://labourlist.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/starmer-e1586020538784-800x450.jpg" alt="img">
The leadership election was the most harmonious in living memory, moving from the amicable to the positively soporific. With global events crowding out the scene, it could hardly have been otherwise, but all three candidates deserve credit for avoiding new divisions. And Keir Starmer has won a mandate despite – or perhaps helped by – a programme largely devoid of startling innovations in policy. As a result, the mandate that he has won remains slightly enigmatic: the individual policies are welcome, but the focus and priorities are not yet clear.</p>
<p>Which, as it turns out, is just as well. With the British and indeed global landscape changing in ways that nobody can predict, a new policy that looked fresh and exciting in January 2020 would have looked dated by May and archaic by 2024. There will be plenty of time to develop new policies to meet the new world that awaits us when the pandemic is finally subdued.</p>
<p>So, Keir has won. What should he do next?</p>
<p>Refresh the shadow cabinet – but don’t uproot the party.</p>
<p>There are commentators who urge that he starts with a clear-out of “Corbynistas” from all levels of the party: they look forward to years of ceaseless conflict. These commentators do not noticeably have our best interests at heart: in many cases, what they want is a Tory-lite opposition to whom power can safely be rented out on infrequent occasions. Moreover, the party is full of people who voted for Jeremy Corbyn and supported his leadership loyally, but have opted to give Keir Starmer a fair wind. It is eccentric to purge your own supporters. Nor is the public interested. If our answer to the global crisis is to argue among ourselves, we will acquire a label of stupefying irrelevance.</p>
<p>That said, the shadow cabinet has been largely unchanged for a long time and there is extensive talent outside it. It is no disrespect to the current shadows to want to see a fresh wind. Keir takes over the party with a considerable mandate. He should use it to move decisively to bring back seasoned veterans and bring on interesting newcomers.</p>
<p>Bring forensic precision to the coronavirus fight.</p>
<p>Most of us are trying to be non-partisan in this time of extreme crisis. We cannot sensibly score cheap points when a thousand people may die the next day. However, being non-partisan does not mean passively endorsing ineffective policies. And the government’s efforts so far have been flawed in a way that Keir Starmer is ideally trained to address. They are characterised by lack of precision, by unexplained changes of direction, and by a certain amiable woolliness which has served the Prime Minister well over the years, but which is not what most people feel is needed at the moment.</p>
<p>We need a credible plan for testing: tomorrow, next week, next month. We need to know who will be tested first, and who next. We need clarity on what the lockdown means – one walk or several? How far? Can you drive to get there? Should you shop frugally every few days, or stock up once a week? People are quite unprecedentedly willing to follow the government’s lead, and it is simply infuriating that the details swim before our eyes, subtly changing from day to day.</p>
<p>But there is a party political priority too. The vulnerable who look to us need to be championed, not just with applause and nice headlines but concrete priority. NHS workers are being flung into the battle with shamefully, pitifully inadequate equipment. People who rent whose incomes have vanished merely have a stay of execution before eviction. Universal Credit remains leisurely and bureaucratic – exactly the wrong characteristics for an emergency safety net. Pensioners face what promises to be galloping inflation on a fixed income.</p>
<p>Policy is visibly being made up on the hoof, and it is crucial that Labour points out the gaps. Many of the people who we seek to represent are facing complete ruin: they need champions. If not us, who?</p>
<p>Look to the future.</p>
<p>Right now, and probably for the rest of 2020, nobody wants policies for 2024. But there will come a point when the dust settles, the economy staggers off the floor, and the groundwork starts to be laid for recovery. Just as in 1945 after the last global cataclysm, the country will not want simply to return to the failed models of the past. Just like Clement Attlee’s Labour Party, we should offer serious competence in rebuilding a better country than we had before – fairer, more equal, greener, more participatory.</p>
<p>People have put up with a great deal in the last two decades: never-ending austerity, the endlessly divisive Brexit trauma, and now the grief and economic devastation caused by the virus. They will not be in a mood for facile populism or even facile centrism, but for a coherent reconstruction plan with progressive values proposed by a serious leadership. Keir Starmer, leading what is now the largest socialist party in the world, is remarkably well-suited to provide exactly that. Those commentators looking forward to a divisive Labour civil war are going to be surprised just how well the party and the wider country respond.
