Ujjwal Satyal</p>
<p>Kathmandu, March 29</p>
<p>Bhim Bahadur Rai, 44, and his wife Sumitra Giri, 44, have not eaten anything for the past two days, thanks to the coronavirus lockdown, which has brought economic activities to a standstill.</p>
<p>The couple used to rummage through the garbage and pick up recyclable items, such as plastic and metal, before selling them to earn a living. But the lockdown, which began on Tuesday, has threatened their livelihood, as no one is allowed to move outside.</p>
<p>This morning, the couple, however, defied the government’s order to stay indoors and wandered around the streets of Kaushaltar. “We came out to find food,” said Giri, as tears welled up her eyes. The mother of a six-year-old daughter was not even in a condition to stand properly, as she told THT she and her family did not even have access to clean drinking water.</p>
<p>Nepal Count Updated COVID-19 figures till Sunday Confirmed cases 5 Discharged 1 Total tests 917 New tests 42 Source: MoHP</p>
<p>Giri and Rai are homeless people who live in a squatter settlement on the banks of Hanumante River at Kaushaltar in Bhaktapur. The couple have called a hume pipe lying strewn nearby the river their home for quite some time. Around 60 households live in the settlement and most of the families are facing the same problem like Giri and Rai.</p>
<p>“My husband has resisted the lockdown order and gone out to find work,” said Anjali Chaudhary, 29. Chaudhary’s husband used to work as an ear cleaner. “But at this moment he is willing to do any work that comes along his way, as we will have to sleep on an empty stomach from today if he does not bring home some money,” said Chaudhary, as she tried to soothe her crying infant daughter in her lap.</p>
<p>Bir Bahadur Rai, 46, another person who lives in the settlement, is facing the same problem. He was given stale noodles last evening by a small eatery nearby. But whether he can find food today is a thought that has been haunting him.</p>
<p>“We generally survive on leftovers. But since the lockdown, restaurants have remained closed and we are struggling to find food. I don’t know how I’m going to survive,” said Bir Bahadur, who is in the same profession as Bhim Bahadur and Giri.</p>
<p>As THT was talking to these people, the public that had gathered in the area offered them food. But there is no guarantee that more volunteers will come to their aid in the coming days as lockdown has crippled movement of people.</p>
<p>The lockdown has received widespread public support as many say this is the only way a country like Nepal with a fragile healthcare system can contain the spread of COVID-19. But it is taking a toll on the urban poor.</p>
<p>Most of the urban poor in Kathmandu valley either live on the roadsides or in squatter settlements. It is not known how many people live in squatter settlements in the valley. But many of those living on roadsides have lately been moved to proper houses.</p>
<p>Kathmandu Metropolitan City with the support of philanthropic organisation, Manab Sewa Aashram, had recently initiated a campaign to rehabilitate homeless people living on the roadsides of the metropolis, transferring around 1,000 homeless people from roadsides to elderly homes, foster homes and homes of their own families.</p>
<p>Today, there are around 600 people living on the roadsides of the valley, according to Manab Sewa Aashram. “These people may suffer the most during lockdown as they may not find food to eat,” said the Aashram’s Chairperson Ramji Adhikari. “Timely action is a must. Otherwise, these people may die of hunger.” Lately, various local governments across the valley have started collecting data on such needy people. “We have called on individuals to inform us about such needy people. We are also formally gathering information about them,” said Madhyapur Thimi Municipality Spokesperson Ram Thapa.</p>

<h3 id="inspectre-kyokou-suiri-season-2-release-date">In/Spectre (Kyokou Suiri) Season 2 Release Date</h3>
<p><img src="https://news.otakukart.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/InSpectre-Kyokou-Suiri-Season-2-Release-Date.jpg" alt="img">
Kyokou Suiri’s season finale comes off with the end of March as the first season comes to an end. The second season is more likely to pick up where the first one ended up. So we might see Kuro Surogawa and Kotoko Iwanaga on their hunt for Rikka Sakarugawa. So in this post, we are going to talk about Kyoklu Suiri Season 2 release date and all the updates that you will need to know about the coming of Kyukou Suiri’s second season.</p>
<p>Kyokou Suiri Season 2 Production</p>
<p>Studio Brian’s Base will be producing the animation as it is also the one that worked in the first season. So looking at the work they have managed to produce so far, it is likely that the studio will be involved again. This studio is popular for its works in the first season of My Teen Romantic Comedy SNAFU and the Second season of Spice and Wolf so they really know what they are doing with their works.</p>
<p>The entire project is handled by Keiji Gotou, who was popular for his works at the Kiddy Grade series. Noboru Takagi, who also worked on Durara, Golden Kamuy and the third season of Kingdom, will be handling the series composition.</p>
<p>Kyokou Suiri Season 2 Release Date</p>
<p>KyoKou Siri projects are usually steered by Crunchyroll, Kodansha and Brain Base Studios. So far there has not been any official confirmation of Kyoukou Suiri Season 2 or any upcoming works regarding the anime and its projects. But in case there are any updates we will bring you the news as soon as they are released. So make sure to regularly check for new content on our website as we always focus on the latest updates and news.</p>
<p>What Will Happen In Kyokou Suiri Season 2?</p>
<p>Kyokou Suiri family followed the manga throughout its first season. So the second season will also continue off from the manga where the first one ended. This is a good thing for Manga readers as they already have an idea of how things will go forward. But for anime fans only, they will have to wait for the second season. Season 1 finale will likely focus on the adaptation of the end of the Steel Lady Nanase story arc. This would be the best stopping point for the anime at this point as it marks the end of Chapter 13 of the Manga from Volume 6.</p>
<p>Most anime adaptations are usually delayed by the lack of manga content, but for Kyokou Suiri, it already has enough content for Kyolou Suiri or In/Spectre Season 2. It is also possible that the second season may have 2 cours, but if that’s, not the case, the manga content will likely reach a point where it can even adapt to Season 3.</p>
<p>Wher To Watch Kyokou Suiri Subbed/English Dubbed?</p>
<p>The first season had ended already and those who still want to go back and watch it again. It was Co-produced by Crunchyroll. It came as one of the Crunchyroll originals anime that launce at the beginning of 2020. The DUB episodes for Kyoukou Suiri premiered in February 2020 and are still going as of date.

<h3 id="review-spectre-phantom-2-holster">Review: Spectre Phantom 2 Holster</h3>
<p><img src="https://d3apgz7jqdnp73.cloudfront.net/media/2111062/spectre-phantom-2-iwb.jpg?preset=socialShare" alt="img">
by David Workman - Saturday, March 28, 2020</p>
<p>Is Kydex the only good plastic option for molded holsters? It certainly is the most popular material, but several good alternatives exist, including Boltaron, which claims to stand up better to impacts and extreme temperature variations than its competitors. Which is why Spectre Holsters uses Boltaron for its Phantom 2 IWB/OWB convertible holster.</p>
<p>The Phantom 2 starts with two .093-inch thick shells heat sealed together and drilled with six screw receivers designed for IWB and OWB hardware. The choice for the version Spectre gave me to try was a pair of IWB LokJaw 1.5-inch clips held to the shell by a single hex screw on each for maximum adjustability. The screws adjusted easily but held tight all day once they were in place. If you order the OWB version, the flared wing is folded the other way, toward your belt, for better concealment. If you prefer a loop over the clips for outside carry, you can order those for just $7.50 extra.</p>
<p>Like a lot of ultra-concealable holsters, the Phantom 2 profile includes a flared wing on the back that juts the rear clip out enough to pull the grip of the gun a bit snugger to the body—a sure benefit to reduce printing as we enter the summer months for concealment under tees and other lighter tops.</p>
<p>The cut of the Phantom 2 automatically accommodates slide-mounted optics without having to choose that as an option when ordering. You will, however, need to choose the one of three light-attachment options for which the Spectre already has molds. If your light isn’t listed, contact the company directly and they may be able to make a special mold, which they will then add to their list of options for future customers.</p>
<p>Among the standout features I really like about the Phantom 2 is an audible click when the gun is secure inside, easy draw that doesn’t hang up, quick and easy mounting on the belt, and a wide back that makes it very comfortable against the body in spite of being hard Boltaron. The mounting clips felt very secure and never slipped during my normal routine, including getting in and out of the car and just going about my daily life.</p>
<p>Available in three basic colors, this holster comes in both right- and left-hand configurations and also allows for optional mag pouches to be attached for an upcharge. At $79.99, the Spectre Phantom 2 is a solid value-conscious option for concealed carry.
