Everton are set to fine Moise Kean two weeks’ salary – around £160,000 – with senior executives at the club “appalled” that the Italian forward held a party at his house in direct defiance of coronavirus lockdown restrictions.</p>
<p>Kean was filmed enjoying himself at the gathering despite the government guidance that people should stay at home and not meet friends or family beyond those in their own household.</p>
<p>It is understood Everton will seek to take the strongest possible action against Kean once a club investigation is completed. The maximum sanction available is the deduction of a fortnight’s wages. Everton may also ask him to issue an apology in addition to any further potential action.</p>
<p>Arsenal to return to individual training at London Colney with strict rules Read more</p>
<p>Kean’s behaviour is particularly disquieting for the club given the goodwill for their longstanding Everton in the Community initiative which helps vulnerable people in the area.</p>
<p>In 2015 Evertonians also launched a joint initiative with Liverpool supporters, under the Fans Supporting Foodbanks umbrella, with the banner “Hunger Doesn’t Wear Club Colours”. Contributions from both clubs have helped to raise £50,000 towards food banks in the area following the start of government restrictions.</p>
<p>In a statement condemning Kean’s actions the club stressed the need to respect NHS staff due to their “hard work and sacrifice”. It read: “Everton football club was appalled to learn of an incident in which a first-team player ignored government guidance and club policy in relation to the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>“The club has strongly expressed its disappointment to the player and made it clear that such actions are completely unacceptable. Everton has regularly stressed the importance of following all the government guidelines – including rules and advice for inside and outside of the home – through a series of official communications to all staff members, including players.”</p>
<p>Kean cost a reported £24m last summer from Juventus, where he became the club’s youngest debutant in 2016. Yet until the season was postponed he had disappointed, scoring only once in 26 appearances, during the 2-2 draw with Newcastle in January.

David Alaba rejects offer from Manchester City (Fussball Transfers)</p>
<p>The future is still unsettled for both David Alaba and Manuel Neuer. According to Fussball Transfers, Manchester City is out of the race for the Austrian superstar after having their bid rejected by the recently converted center-back.</p>
<p>Head coach Hansi Flick wants to keep his rejuvenated star, although, at the moment, nothing is certain. Bayern will have to sell if Alaba doesn’t extend his contract before the summer as they don’t want to risk Alaba going on a free transfer.</p>
<p>Although he won’t join Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, Alaba is still flirting with Real Madrid and Barcelona. Whether the two Spanish clubs can afford him, especially with the recent corona pandemic which affected Spain severely in mind, is another question.</p>

<p>Moise Kean is in trouble after filming himself at his own party at his apartment. Being the latest football player to break restrictions, Kean filmed himself with several women at a raunchy lockdown party.</p>
<p>In a club statement, Everton stated they were:</p>
<p>Appalled to learn of an incident in which a first-team player ignored government guidance and club policy in relation to the coronavirus crisis…Everton has regularly stressed the importance of following all the government guidelines - including rules and advice for inside and outside of the home - through a series of official communications to all staff members, including players.</p>
<p>More than 20,000 people have died due to the coronavirus in UK hospitals, according to the Department of Health. Everton added to their statement:</p>
<p>The amazing people in the NHS deserve the utmost respect for their hard work and sacrifice. The best way to show them respect is by doing everything we can to protect them.</p>
<p>Kean, who has so far seen as an expensive flop ever since his move from Juventus for €27.50 million, will most likely get a find from the Merseyside club.</p>

<p>Zé Roberto is currently the technical advisor to Palmeiras. He played a total of 169 Bundesliga games with Bayern Munich and more than 300 Bundesliga games overall.

<p>Marcus Quarantine Footy Video Recommendation — COPA90s ‘the Search For Indonesia’s First Wonderkid’</p>
<p>Considering we are all stuck in the same boat, I thought I’d share recommendations on footy videos I’ve been watching while stuck in quarantine. The first edition is an on-going series from COPA90. It is about the journey of the best Indonesian U-17 players, who come to England to try and improve their game and career. Under the stewardship of former English internationals Des Walker and Dennis Wise, it is a massively entertaining series.</p>
<p>Indonesia is a relatively unknown but passionate footballing nation.

<p><img src="https://www.hampshirechronicle.co.uk/resources/images/11302304/" alt="img">
Everton have labelled Moise Kean’s actions “unacceptable” after he flouted coronavirus lockdown restrictions.</p>
<p>The striker filmed himself partying at home with guests in a breach of social distancing regulations during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Kean, who joined from Juventus for a reported £24million last summer, is likely to face disciplinary action.</p>
<p>Everton have been critical of Moise Kean for partying during lockdown (Martin Rickett/PA)</p>
<p>A club statement read: “Everton Football Club was appalled to learn of an incident in which a first team player ignored Government guidance and club policy in relation to the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>“The club has strongly expressed its disappointment to the player and made it clear that such actions are completely unacceptable.</p>
<p>“Everton has regularly stressed the importance of following all the Government guidelines – including rules and advice for inside and outside of the home – through a series of official communications to all staff members, including players.</p>
<p>“The amazing people in the NHS deserve the utmost respect for their hard work and sacrifice. The best way to show them respect is by doing everything we can to protect them.”</p>
<p>Kean is the latest Premier League player to flout the rules after Jack Grealish and Kyle Walker were forced to apologise for breaching the restrictions while Serge Aurier and Moussa Sissoko said sorry after training together last week.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old has failed to impress in his debut season in England, scoring just once in 26 games for the Toffees.
