<p>Collingwood president Eddie McGuire has addressed his heated interview with Nine journalist Tony Jones, saying a large number of members requesting refunds from their AFL clubs would be like “a run on the banks”.</p>
<p>What appeared like a simple bit of cross-promotion for the night’s episode of Footy Classified turned into a clash of heads between the two footy media veterans, with McGuire getting frustrated at the questions he was asked by Jones.</p>

<p>“If you’re gonna invite me on the Nine News, let me put what I was gonna say in context,” McGuire said on Triple M’s Hot Breakfast this morning.</p>
<p>“Don’t try and trip me up with a yes/no answer. It’s a lot more complicated, and needs to be explained more than that.”</p>
<p>Chompers and Eddie square off 1:00</p>
<p>McGuire, who was doing the interview from the position of both a TV host and an AFL club president, said during the chat and on Thursday morning that fans who are facing financial difficulties can of course get refunds on their memberships.</p>
<p>But he implored fans to support their clubs, who are also facing hard times given the lack of revenue during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>“My point is, though, it’s not like an ATM that can spit the money out,” McGuire said.</p>
<p>“It’s like if you go to a bank. If you have a run on the bank, nominally they actually have the money there, but they can’t actually hand it all over in one go.”</p>
<p>He admitted he got “narced” by Jones’ line of questioning, which was attempting to get a firm yes or no answer on whether fans could get a refund.</p>
<p>Throwback: Jack cracks it 2:14</p>
<p>“This is a club. It’s not like I’m some oligarch who’s diving into a pot of money &hellip; people give what they can,” McGuire said.</p>
<p>“What has been the story, and I must admit I really got narced last night. I’ve had the media go after the players, go after the officials, casting aspersions at them and yet they do the right thing. The clubs are all there, trying to do the right thing to survive.</p>
<p>“The story that should be being told is people ringing up and buying memberships, in the memory of their late grandfather who was a great Collingwood person, you know?”</p>
<p>McGuire said he is “begging” fans to stick with their clubs through this period.</p>
<p>Taylor explains ham sledge 1:16</p>
<p>“We do this all the time with people, every year as I mentioned there, with people if they’ve fallen on hard times,” he said.</p>
<p>“But this is about a membership. It’s not a transaction, it’s not like you’re actually looking for a refund.</p>
<p>“The memberships actually keep you (the clubs) alive for 12 months of the year, so a lot of our members have actually put the money in, started putting their membership in October.</p>
<p>“Well that money’s been spent to keep the place open until this time.</p>
<p>“We will help people, of course we will, we will help them, but I’m just begging people — if you want your club to survive, it’s your club, that’s what a club membership base is all about.”

Collingwood president Eddie McGuire and sports journalist Tony Jones have set tongues wagging with an on air stoush over membership.</p>
<p>Jones suggested members had every right to ask for a refund given the pause in the 2020 AFL season – a suggestion McGuire did not take kindly to.</p>

<p>TJ: Eddie, as club president, what’s your stance on members wanting their money back?</p>
<p>EM: It’s as simple as this, mate, if you don’t have members you don’t have a club. A club that has no members is a memory so we need our members to stick with us as much as we can. If our supporters or anyone gets into financial hardship, speak to us. We are there together because the members are the club. It’s not as if we’re privately owned, it’s not as if we spend the money. This is all about sticking together through tough times. And I can tell you – and you know the history of the Collingwood Football Club – we were founded in the darkest time of depression in the 1890s and got through by building the stands of Victoria Park …</p>
<p>TJ: I know, but if someone comes to you now – if a member comes to you now – and says, ‘I’ve lost both my jobs, I need my money back’ you would say …?</p>
<p>EM: Tony, you’ve got to listen to me, mate. We are in it together. We look after members, they’re part of our family.</p>
<p>TJ: Would you give their money back?</p>
<p>EM: Tony, if you came to me and said you need a loan at the moment do you think I’d help you? Of course I would. But what we don’t want to do is have a run on on clubs because the membership is keeping us alive at the moment. We’ve got no visibility. I came in tonight and saw a kid seven years of age walking along today in his Essendon jumper and I looked at him and I thought, ‘He’s probably generational Essendon supporter, he’s got so much to look forward to’. If you believe in the clubs (and think that) AFL football is important then please …</p>
<p>TJ: I know …</p>
<p>EM: You’re not listening at the moment, Tony. You’re trying to get a headline.</p>
<p>TJ: No …</p>
<p>EM: This is what we don’t want …</p>
<p>TJ: No, no no, no no …</p>
<p>EM: No, mate.</p>
<p>TJ: I’m not trying to get a headline, I’m trying to get an answer.</p>
<p>EM: I’m giving you an answer, Tony,</p>
<p>TJ: If a member comes to you and says they want their money back, will you give their money back?</p>
<p>In happier times. Source: News Corp Australia</p>
<p>EM: I just said to you, if you’ve got financial hardship speak to your club, we’re there to help you. We always do. We do this year in, year out with people who’ve got financial hardship. What I’m saying to you though, Tony, is this is more than just a transaction. This is people who love their club. And it means more to them. Tony, do you want to hear what the answer means or do you want to keep asking questions?</p>
<p>TJ: No, no, no. We’re running out of time, but you can love your club without actually putting your hand in your pocket, too, Eddie …</p>
<p>EM: And, Tony, if we don’t have enough people putting their hand in their pocket there will be no club. It’s as simple as that.</p>
<p>TJ: OK, unfortunately there’s a lot of empty pockets, Ed.</p>
<p>EM: And they’ll be looked after Tony. Don’t make this into people taking money out of people’s pockets.</p>
<p>TJ: No, no, no …</p>
<p>EM: And don’t wind me up with a smart arse last line, OK? This is desperate stakes and don’t try and make a headline.</p>
<p>TJ: I’m not trying to make a headline, Eddie.</p>
<p>EM: If people want help they will get it.

Collingwood president Eddie McGuire and Nine News sports presenter Tony Jones have been involved in a tense on-air exchange about club membership refunds.</p>
<p>With the AFL currently suspended until at least May 31 due to the unprecedented coronavirus crisis, talk around memberships and whether fans deserve their money back has intensified in recent weeks.</p>
<p>In a fiery debate, McGuire said it was vital that fans stick with their clubs during the current footy shut down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as simple as this: if you don&rsquo;t have members, you don&rsquo;t have a club,&rdquo; he told Nine News on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A club that has no members is a memory, so we need our members to stick with us as much as they can.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If our supporters or anyone gets into financial hardship, speak to us. We are there together because members are the club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not as if we&rsquo;re privately owned&hellip;this is all about sticking together through tough times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the history of the Collingwood Football Club, we were founded in the darkest times of depression in the 1890s and got through by building the stands at Victoria Park with sustenance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Jones held firm, insisting members who were under financial stress were entitled to some form of feedback.</p>
