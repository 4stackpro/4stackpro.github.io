Not long after the sun rose on Easter morning, Beba Tata arrived at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., ready to pray.</p>
<p>It all felt strangely quiet, almost hollow, thought Ms. Tata, a Catholic chaplain. This was not the way she normally would celebrate the sacred day. But little has felt normal lately: Just a few days ago, she had been called to pray outside the sealed door of a coronavirus patient’s hospital room, at the urgent plea of his grieving wife.</p>
<p>All around her, she was seeing echoes of the story of Jesus’ final days. His suffering on the cross while his loved ones watched “at a distance,” as the Book of Mark said. His final gasp for air. His disciples waiting, hoping, wondering about life beyond death.</p>
<p>On Sunday, she looked up at a hospital television. A priest was celebrating the Easter Mass. She began to worship, her pager at her side in case she was called to see a patient.

<h3 id="an-easter-of-solitude-christians-across-the-world-mark-easter-sunday-amid-the-coronavirus">&lsquo;An Easter of solitude&rsquo;: Christians across the world mark Easter Sunday amid the coronavirus</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/12/USAT/d62923f1-b191-4f27-99dd-5cf0a6da3efb-AP_Virus_Outbreak_Vatican_Easter.jpg?crop=4904,2759,x0,y249&amp;width=3200&amp;height=1801&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" alt="img">
Trevor Hughes and Eric J. Lyman</p>
<p>USA TODAY</p>
<p>VATICAN CITY – His voice echoing through the nearly empty St. Peter’s Basilica, a somber Pope Francis celebrated one of the strangest Easter celebrations in Vatican history Sunday amid Italy’s national lockdown for the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Francis cast a solitary figure as he addressed the outbreak that has so far claimed more than 110,000 lives worldwide, nearly 20,000 of them in Italy, which surrounds Vatican City. More than 20,600 people have died in the United States. The pandemic has prompted quarantines and social distancing orders worldwide, from China, where it began, across Europe, South America and the U.S.</p>
<p>“This is an Easter of solitude lived amid the sorry and hardship the pandemic is causing, whether from physical suffering or economic difficulties,” Francis said in Italian.</p>
<p>Millions of Christians globally celebrated Easter, marking the resurrection of Jesus following his crucifixion. In the U.S., many churches were holding similar remote services intended to help slow the infection&rsquo;s spread. Congregants posted photos on social media showing them attending drive-in services from their cars, and a pastor at a Boston church delivered his message to photos of his parishioners taped to the pews.</p>
<p>In Kentucky, state troopers recorded the license plates of congregants ignoring a state order and worshipping in a large group after they cleaned up nails the pastor said were spread in its parking lot.</p>
<p>﻿Both President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence planned to attend Easter services remotely. Trump said he&rsquo;d be watching an online service led by Pastor Robert Jeffress of the 4,000-member First Baptist Church in Dallas and a Fox News contributor.</p>
<p>This is the first year of his presidency that Trump hasn&rsquo;t traveled to his Florida resort for Easter, where he and his family usually attend Easter service at the Episcopal church where he and first lady Melania Trump were married in 2005.</p>
<p>Also canceled this year: the annual White House Easter egg roll, which dates back to 1878 and was previously canceled or moved during the two world wars, according to the White House Historical Association.</p>
<p>Francis mentioned those directly impacted by the spread of the virus, including medical personnel, the sick, the dead, and family members mourning their losses. It was a far cry from Easter Sunday a year ago, when an estimated 75,000 people packed St. Peter&rsquo;s Square as Francis urged those in zones of conflict to lay down their arms.</p>
<p>In Sunday’s Mass, he called for the faithful watching from home to maintain their faith in what he called “trying times.”</p>
<p>“Our world is already faced with epochal challenges,” the pontiff said. “Now it is oppressed by a pandemic that is severely testing our whole human family.”</p>
<p>Outside the basilica in St. Peter’s Square, security staff that would normally be assuring the safe movement of the faithful into the square for Mass were instead turning them away.</p>
<p>Despite not being able to attend Easter services in person, many said the 83-year-old pontiff still gives them strength. Anna Maria Donaldson, 39, is a U.N. consultant from New Jersey who has attended the pope&rsquo;s Easter Mass annually since moving to Rome in 2015. This year she watched the live broadcast on her laptop from her nearby apartment.</p>
<p>“I feel stronger after watching the Mass,” Donaldson said. “You could see the weight of the pandemic on the shoulders of the pope as he celebrated Mass. He is being strong to help us be stronger.”</p>
<p>What to watch:Easter Sunday streaming guide: Andrea Bocelli and more</p>
<p>Some church leaders and conservative politicians in the U.S. fought back against closures and social distancing orders, although most churches were following distancing guidelines.</p>
<p>In Kansas, the state&rsquo;s highest court is considering whether Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly has the power to ban religious and funeral services of more than 10 attendees during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>And in Kentucky, Gov. Andy Beshear said anyone attending a mass gathering, such as a church service, may have their license plates recorded so attendees can be contacted by government officials and required to self-quarantine for 14 days.</p>
<p>What is open:What stores are open Easter Sunday 2020? Here&rsquo;s the list of who is open and who will stay closed</p>
<p>U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican who represents Kentucky, said that goes too far. &ldquo;Taking license plates at church?&rdquo; Paul tweeted late Friday. &ldquo;Quarantining someone for being Christian on Easter Sunday? Someone needs to take a step back here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the Maryville Baptist Church in Kentucky, pastor Jack Roberts reported that someone scattered piles of nails around the church&rsquo;s parking lot in the hours before in-person services were set to begin. Roberts held a service Wednesday that drew 40 people – and a health department order to stop holding such gatherings.</p>
<p>Roberts was insistent on holding service Sunday, arguing his parishioners have a constitutional right to worship together, and covered up his license plate. Several other drivers did the same thing, and state troopers then arrived to take note of the plates and hand out warning letters asking congregants to self-quarantine for 14 days.</p>
<p>Lyman reported from Vatican City. Hughes reported from Denver.</p>

<h3 id="happy-easter-sunday-2020-songs-messages-and-quotes-to-celebrate-the-day">Happy Easter Sunday 2020! Songs, messages and quotes to celebrate the day</h3>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-1137013084_1586698797.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;crop=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
Expect to eat plenty of chocolate eggs today (Picture: Getty Images)</p>
<p>Today is Easter Sunday – and while the day’s normally one for celebrations and get-togethers (not to mention a lot of chocolate), this year’s Easter is looking rather different in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>With the UK still in lockdown, the usual family get-togethers are off limits, while church services have also moved online, and egg hunts are moving into the back garden.</p>
<p>However that doesn’t mean people can’t mark the day in other ways, and listening to Easter music and sharing online greetings can still take place.</p>
<p>Here’s some suggestions on what you might want to listen to, and how to greet others celebrating the festival.</p>
<p>Top Easter songs</p>
<p>According to Praise Charts, these are the top five songs for Easter 2020:</p>
<p>Christ Our Hope In Life and Death (Matt Papa, Keith Getty, Krystyn Getty)</p>
<p>King Of Kings (Hillsong Worship)</p>
<p>Graves Into Gardens (Elevation Worship, Brandon Lake)</p>
<p>Holy Water (We The Kingdom)</p>
<p>See A Victory (Elevation Worship)</p>
<p>Easter messages and quotes</p>
<p>Even in the dark days of this Easter, we still have hope. In the new life of the resurrection of Jesus, we dare to have faith in life before death…</p>
