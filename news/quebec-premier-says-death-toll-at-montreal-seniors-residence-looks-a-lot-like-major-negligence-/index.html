Quebec Premier François Legault said 31 people have died at a private Montreal-area seniors&rsquo; residence since March 13 — five, so far, confirmed from COVID-19.</p>
<p>A sombre Legault, visibly pale as he spoke at Saturday&rsquo;s provincial news conference, cancelled a planned day off to deal with the fallout and share with the public a situation that he said &ldquo;looks a lot like major negligence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>COVID-19 has infiltrated many of Quebec&rsquo;s CHSLDs, which is the French acronym for a seniors&rsquo; residence or long-term care centre. But the toll at CHSLD Herron, located in the West Island suburb of Dorval, is especially grim.</p>
<p>Public health authorities said they first took stock of the situation at the Herron on March 29.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know that they were struggling to keep their ratios of staff to residents,&rdquo; said Lynne McVey, president and CEO of the public health agency for the western region of Montreal, at a news conference later Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they had asked us for help and we did provide, on some shifts, help to go into the residence to help care for their patients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, McVey said, the Herron&rsquo;s owners did not fully co-operate, a development she described as &ldquo;extraordinary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was only after issuing two formal notices and an eventual court order under Quebec&rsquo;s Public Health Act that officials were able to see residents&rsquo; medical files and information about family contacts, McVey said.</p>
<p>Katasa Development Group, based in Gatineau, owns CHSLD Herron and six other seniors&rsquo; residences in Quebec.</p>
<p>The court order, issued on April 8, allows the regional health authority to &ldquo;order any measure it deems necessary to prevent a threat to the health of the population from worsening,&rdquo; according to a statement released Saturday.</p>

<p>McVey said the situation at CHSLD Herron is now under control.</p>
<p>She said doctors and health-care workers from hospitals and clinics were now on hand at the residence and &ldquo;fully operational and that the families of all residents of the Herron will be contacted today.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our teams are there now, and we&rsquo;re going to focus on the health of every resident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Like day and night&rsquo;</p>
<p>That focus comes too late for Barbara Schneider. Her mother, Mary, had been admitted to CHSLD Herron about three weeks before the COVID-19 crisis took hold in Montreal.</p>
<p>Schneider said she visited her mother regularly until the residence closed to visitors because of the pandemic. After that, she had extreme difficulty making contact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody that tried to reach her was unable to reach her,&rdquo; Schneider said. No receptionists answered the phone, emails did not receive replies and voicemail inboxes were always full.</p>
<p>On Thursday, a nurse on her second day on the job — Schneider thinks she was brought in as public health officials took over — finally helped her talk to her mother by video chat.</p>
<p>What she saw was shocking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was frail. And she was so gaunt,&rdquo; Schneider said. &ldquo;From when she went in to this last time was like day and night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Friday, Mary died at the age of 93. She had been infected with the coronavirus, but Schneider still isn&rsquo;t sure if that&rsquo;s what led to her death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To hear the horrible and deplorable conditions that went down, nobody deserves that,&rdquo; Scheider said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re rich or poor. Nobody in this world should have to live like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Legault promises change</p>
<p>Conditions at CHSLDs have been an issue for years.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Legault said he was &ldquo;not proud to see what is happening in our CHSLDs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We owe it to our elders, to take care of them with dignity,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want to give my word to Quebecers that we will take the necessary actions&rdquo; to ensure Quebec&rsquo;s seniors are better cared for.</p>

<p>A public health investigation is ongoing, and Legault said the province has also requested a police investigation.</p>
<p>The province is now following up at the other private facilities that belong to Katasa Development Group, Legault said, and will verify conditions at all 40 private CHSLDs in the province immediately.</p>
<p>Quebec Health Minister Danielle McCann said she expects a report on those residences by the end of the day.</p>
<p>Legault said he would be &ldquo;prudent&rdquo; while investigations were under way, but followed with a candid assessment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly, I think a lot of negligence took place at the residence,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I repeat, when the CIUSSS arrived on March 29, almost all the staff was gone,&rdquo; he said, referring to the regional health authority, which is now running the home. &ldquo;So I think it looks a lot like major negligence.&rdquo;

<h3 id="grieving-family-finds-no-solace-in-police-investigation-into-seniors-residence">Grieving family finds no solace in police investigation into seniors&rsquo; residence</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thetelegram.com/media/photologue/photos/cache/0409-city-west-island-8jpg_medium" alt="img">
A A</p>
<p>The daughter of a man who died after coming into contact with the coronavirus at a Dorval seniors’ residence finds no solace in Premier François Legault’s decision to launch a police investigation into the management of private elder-care facilities.</p>
<p>“I’m angry because my father didn’t have to die,” said the women, whose father was among 31 residents of Résidence Herron to die since the first case of COVID-19 occurred there on March 27.</p>
<p>“This isn’t a Third World country and you expect that private care would be better than the public system,” said the woman, who noted there were serious complaints about the management of the facility long before the coronavirus became an issue.</p>
<p>The woman’s relationship with Katasa Groupe, which owns Résidence Herron and six other seniors’ residences in Quebec, started on a positive note two years ago when she found space for her parents at Manoir Pierrefonds.</p>
<p>“My mother was a dialysis patient who was autonomous and my father was suffering from dementia, but was otherwise in good health,” the woman said. “They were on separate floors, but were in the same building.”</p>
<p>A month after moving in, her father was abruptly moved to Résidence Herron and things began to go downhill.</p>
<p>“He needed supervision so he didn’t wander off, but he was on a floor with 15 other patients and he was locked up at night, and there was one orderly who mostly sat at his desk,” the woman said. “During the day, he was drugged and I remember one time he couldn’t eat because he was asleep. He lost so much weight that he looked like someone in a concentration camp.</p>
<p>The woman’s husband, who is a family physician, recounted one visit when his wife had to help her father get to a bathroom.</p>
<p>“She had a lot of difficulty because he was in a wheelchair at the time and she had to change a diaper,” the husband recalled. “There was an orderly to help her and my wife was so grateful she even offered to give the orderly a $10 tip, but she refused.</p>
<p>“One mark of a society is how we care for our elderly, but these facilities are understaffed,” the doctor said. “These residences are expensive, but they rely on staff who are making the minimum wage. Compare it to day-care centres which are better staffed, even though it’s easier to change a diaper on a baby than on a grown-up who may be not be compliant.</p>
<p>“The government doesn’t do enough oversight on the private residences because they know if they shut them down, they would have to build more public facilities,” the doctor said.</p>
<p>The woman’s mother is paying close to $3,000 a month, while her father was paying $4,000 to 5,000.</p>
<p>The woman was asked to join a class-action suit against Katasa Groupe last year, but declined because she was afraid it would make life more difficult for her mother.</p>
<p>The staffing problems at Résidence Herron became more acute after the first cases of COVID-19 were reported. One positive test was followed by two more and, when three staff members tested positive, there was a steady exodus. A shortage of protective equipment and a failure to properly isolate residents led to a rapid increase in positive tests.</p>
<p>When the province barred visitors from hospitals and seniors’ residences, the woman was left in the dark when she tried to get an update on her father’s condition.</p>
<p>“All the phones were shut down and we couldn’t get any information,” she said.</p>
<p>The silence was broken on April 7 when the residence called the woman and said her father was having difficulty breathing. He was transferred to Lakeshore General Hospital and, less than three hours later, he died.</p>
<p>“We don’t even know if he’s included in the COVID numbers because he was never tested and the cause of death may be listed as respiratory failure,” the doctor said.</p>
<p>“It was COVID,” said his wife as she completed arrangements for her father’s funeral.</p>

<h3 id="public-health-police-find-bodies-feces-at-dorval-seniors-residence-sources">Public health, police find bodies, feces at Dorval seniors’ residence: sources</h3>
<p><img src="https://postmediamontrealgazette2.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/0409-city-west-island-4.jpg" alt="img">
Article content</p>
<p>A privately run seniors’ residence in Dorval that is grappling with an outbreak of COVID-19 has been described as a “concentration camp” — with unfed and soiled elderly residents inside — by health professionals who came to those residents’ rescue, a Montreal Gazette investigation has found.</p>
<p>Although the official COVID-19 death toll at Résidence Herron stood at two on Thursday, a worker said 27 residents have died in the past two weeks. This is highly unusual, as the facility reports an average of four deaths a month, the worker noted.</p>

<p>Families have also contacted the Gazette to dispute the official tally, saying it does not correspond with the stream of funeral vans they’ve seen leaving the parking lot in the past two weeks, or with what they’ve learned about the situation inside the building on Herron Rd.</p>
<p>It’s possible some residents did not die from COVID-19, but officials with the West Island health authority and the owners of the Herron did not respond to requests for clarification.
