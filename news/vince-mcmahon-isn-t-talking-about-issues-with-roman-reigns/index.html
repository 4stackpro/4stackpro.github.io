Roman Reigns decided not to work his match as scheduled at WrestleMania 36. His compromised immune system meant that staying at the WWE Performance Center was too risky. Braun Strowman was put in his spot and he won the Universal Title with zero time to promote the change.</p>
<p>WWE didn’t provide any reason why Roman Reigns was taken out of the Universal Title match. He was featured in all promotional material and the really cool opening video package for the event.</p>
<p>No mention of The Big Dog was made during the event. It was noted that there might be something going on between Vince McMahon and Roman Reigns.</p>
<p>Ringside News has learned that if there is any heat between Vince McMahon and Roman Reigns then it’s not being talked about. McMahon isn’t talking about it and if there is any kind of issue then it’s between them.</p>
<p>Roman Reigns explained why he didn’t work WrestleMania. He said that nobody knows the real story. He also said that he’s had a lot of time to think about how he wants to treat people and how he wants to be treated.</p>
<p>Reigns is around elderly family members and children as well. If you add in the risks of his leukemia, it is a risk he wasn’t going to take. We’ll have to see when he is able to make it back to a WWE television taping.

<h3 id="brock-lesnar-roman-reigns-headline-forbes-list-of-wwes-highest-paid-wrestlers">Brock Lesnar, Roman Reigns Headline Forbes&rsquo; List of WWE&rsquo;s Highest-Paid Wrestlers</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/861/264/hi-res-44daef7eab59cae2bc1ffa1a097eb509_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=1200&amp;q=75" alt="img">

<p>Universal champion Brock Lesnar is the highest-paid member of WWE&rsquo;s active roster, according to Forbes&rsquo; David Bixenspan.</p>
<p>Lesnar received $10 million, doubling the earnings of the next-closest star, Roman Reigns.</p>
<p>Bixenspan noted the list didn&rsquo;t include John Cena or Ronda Rousey, both of whom were absent on WWE programming for most of the past year. Neither Cena nor Rousey is considered an active member of the roster, though Cena returned in February to feud with &ldquo;The Fiend&rdquo; Bray Wyatt ahead of WrestleMania 36.</p>
<p>WWE Highest-Paid Wrestlers</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Brock Lesnar, $10 million</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roman Reigns, $5 million</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Randy Orton, $4.1 million</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seth Rollins, $4 million</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Triple H, $3.3 million</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Becky Lynch, $3.1 million</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bill Goldberg, $3 million</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shane McMahon, $2.1 million</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stephanie McMahon, $2 million</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Braun Strowman, $1.9 million</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>According to Bixenspan, Becky Lynch is the first female full-time performer to make the list. Stephanie McMahon has remained an on-screen presence, but her earnings reflect her dual roles as a performer and the company&rsquo;s chief brand officer.</p>
<p>Lynch&rsquo;s momentum began building toward the end of 2018 and culminated at WrestleMania 35, when she defeated Rousey and Charlotte Flair in the first women&rsquo;s match to main-event WrestleMania.</p>
<p>Although each wrestler receives a downside guarantee to lock in their minimum salary, this list could look a lot different next year because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on WWE programming.</p>
<p>The promotion was forced to move WrestleMania 36 from Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, to the WWE Performance Center in Orlando with no fans in attendance. Weekly programs such as Raw and SmackDown have emanated from an empty Performance Center as well.</p>
<p>WWE&rsquo;s next step is unclear after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis issued a stay-at-home order for 30 days. Even if the company continues with its regular television schedule, the ratings are trending downward despite the fact that recent episodes are leading up to the biggest pay-per-view of the year, per Awful Announcing.</p>
<p>Wrestler salaries are bound to take a hit as WWE attempts to navigate its way through the pandemic.

<h3 id="wwe-superstar-roman-reigns-shows-meaning-of-kindness-amid-coronavirus-pandemic">WWE Superstar Roman Reigns shows meaning of kindness amid coronavirus pandemic</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.local10.com/resizer/1faFvT0T3r5_2Ykz97QAIEXXnsE=/1600x900/smart/filters:format(jpeg):strip_exif(true):strip_icc(true):no_upscale(true):quality(65)/d1vhqlrjc8h82r.cloudfront.net/04-02-2020/t_bae195f2f2be4cd983dbd88b5b29c7ef_name_8.jpg" alt="img">
HOLLYWOOD, Fla. – The coronavirus pandemic is also impacting World Wrestling Entertainment’s superstars and their fans. It has been especially painful for Joe Anoa’i, better known as Roman Reigns &ndash; one of the WWE’s most popular superstars &ndash; and for arguably his biggest fan in South Florida, 15-year-old Anthony Primavera.</p>
<p>Anthony is a kidney disease patient who undergoes regular dialysis at Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital in Hollywood. Anoa’i, 34, has had two bouts with cancer. He was first diagnosed with leukaemia at 22 in 2008, and he suffered a relapse a decade later.</p>
<p>Anoa’i decided to cancel his WWE Universal Championship fight against Bill Goldberg at WrestleMania 36, which will be held this weekend without fans at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando. Anthony had tickets. The event was supposed to be held at the Raymond James Stadium in Tampa.</p>
<p>Champion Kevin Owens defends his Universal Championship belt against Roman Reigns with Chris Jericho aka Y2K hanging above the ring in a shark cage</p>
<p>“The moment I make a choice for me and my family I am a coward, I am a sissy,” Anoa’i said on Instagram after he was criticized over his decision to not expose himself to Covid-19, the highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus.</p>
<p>Anoa’i added, “But you don’t know the whole story &hellip; You don’t know what else is going on in my life.”</p>
<p>Anthony felt like he understood Roman Reigns more than anyone. It had been his dream to see him in action at the WrestleMania 36, but he knows what it is like to not be able to do the things you love to protect yourself and your family from suffering.</p>
<p>Anthony had settled for watching WrestleMania 36 on television on Saturday and Sunday nights. But members of the Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital’s Child Life Program had other ideas. They contacted Anoa’i and he agreed to surprise Anthony.</p>

<p>“Hey! Anthony! What’s up buddy? It is Roman Reigns!”</p>
<p>Anthony’s hero had just said his name.</p>
<p>“Thinking of you.”</p>
<p>The magic words made Anthony feel like he was on top of the world.</p>
<p>“I want to visit you”</p>
<p>Anthony smiled and laughed in disbelief. He was in shock. All he could say was, “Thank you!”
