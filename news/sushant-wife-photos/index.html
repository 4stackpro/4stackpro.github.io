<p>The actor hailed from Bihar and was educated in Patna and New Delhi, before shifting to Mumbai.</p>

<p>Updated: Jun 15, 2020 11:50 IST</p>
<p>Actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death should be investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Jan Adhikar Party chief Pappu Yadav demanded on Monday.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput, who dropped out of an engineering college to pursue a career in Bollywood and delivered several hit films over the past decade, was found dead in his apartment in Mumbai on Sunday. He was 34.</p>
<p>Dattatreya Bargude, an assistant commissioner of Mumbai Police, confirmed the actor’s death and said that no “note” was found at his residence.</p>
<p>“I cannot imagine how this happened. I request the government to launch a CBI inquiry. I think there is a deep conspiracy behind his death. Sushant cannot commit suicide,” Pappu Yadav told reporters.</p>
<p>“I want a CBI inquiry in the matter. Sushant was a workaholic and good man, not the kind of person that would commit suicide. He rose from the bottom. Made Bihar proud. Now the state of Bihar is in mourning,” he added.</p>
<p>Yadav also claimed that it could be a case of homicide.</p>
<p>Rajput was born in Bihar’s capital of Patna and was the youngest of five children of a government employee. He completed his schooling in Delhi before securing a seat in an engineering college in the Capital in 2003.</p>
<p>He dropped out of the course to pursue acting professionally three years later and joined the Barry John Acting School.</p>
<p>The actor landed his first role in the Hindi serial, Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil, in 2008 but gained popularity the next year with his character in the popular soap, Pavitra Rishta.</p>
<p>He debuted in Bollywood in 2013 with the movie Kai Po Che!, adapted from a novel by Chetan Bhagat but became a household name with the success of MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, a biopic on the World Cup-winning Indian cricket captain, in 2016.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput was last seen in Nitesh Tiwari’s Chhichhore in 2019 and also acted in the thriller Drive that was released on Netflix the same year.</p>

The news of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s suicide has left everyone in a state of shock. His friends and colleagues are unable to believe the news and are shattered. Parag Tyagi , who worked with Sushant Singh Rajput in Pavitra Rishta, his first show as a hero is unable to come to terms with the fact that he is no more. In an exclusive interview with ETimes TV, Parag stated that the entire Pavitra Rishta cast is devastated including Ankita Lokhande , Swati Anand and Usha Nadkarni.&ldquo;Aai (Usha Nadkarni) can&rsquo;t stop crying. Manju Shah (Swati Anand), everyone is shattered after hearing the news. All Pavitra Rishta actors were discussing and everyone is asking why? I spoke to Ankita (Lokhande). She is also devastated and everyone is speechless as to how this happened. She was devastated and is unable to believe the news. Everything was good, Chichore was a hit, his new film was coming Bechara, which looked good, why Sushant why. I was watching the teasers of Bechara yesterday. He was so good,&rdquo; said Parag.The Shakti actor remembers Sushant as a very dedicated and passionate actor, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very hard to believe. He was such a beautiful soul. He was a happy guy, how can he do such a thing. We met each other on and off at parties. He seemed fine. Whenever we met he looked so high on energy. I always felt so nice after meeting him. We would recall all the old memories from the Pavitra Rishta sets. He was a wonderful soul and a happy-go-lucky person. He was a very hardworking and passionate guy. I would say I have learnt so much from him. When we were working on Pavitra Rishta, he would not go home for 15-20 days. He used to sleep on the sets. I would also be there sometime and we would wake up and have breakfast together. Being a lead actor he would shoot more than all of us but he never complained. He would sleep for 2-3 hours on the sets during the break. He would tell everyone, this is my time yaar, I can&rsquo;t take off. He was focused, passionate and hardworking towards his work. He was very particular about his work.,&rdquo; shared he.Parag says that Sushant always motivated everyone to never give up in life and now seeing him commit suicide is tough to believe, &ldquo;The cops are still doing the investigation. They have doubts and even I can&rsquo;t believe that he can commit suicide. He was a very strong person. He was emotional of course, but he was very strong. It is hard to believe that he can commit suicide after coming such a long way. He had reached so far because of his hard work and dedication.He never gave up in his life, that&rsquo;s why it is very shocking to believe how can he commit suicide. He was a very warm and positive person. He would motivate everyone. At times during Pavitra Rishta when people would tell him you are working too hard go easy on yourself, he would tell them this is my time to work hard. Aaram karne ke liye puri zindagi padi hai&hellip;This is my chance, I won&rsquo;t give. People would tell him to relax the show is a hit, but he would not stop. He would work so hard on all his characters that&rsquo;s the reason he could see this stardom. Starting from a parallel lead and to reach Bollywood and do solo hero films not everyone can do but he did. He reached this level, it is commendable,&rdquo; he said.Parag, who loves fitness, recalls the time when he had called Sushant after seeing his body in Kai Po Che, &ldquo;He was such an inspiration to all. When he made a body in Kai Po Che, I called and congratulated him because I am into fitness and all, I was so proud of him. I told him that you have motivated me again yaar bhai body bahut acchi banayi hai aur tune toh inspire kar diya. He was doing great in his career, everything was going great for him. Then why?,&rdquo; asks Parag.The Aghori actor is very emotional as he had lost his father a few days ago and now losing Sushant is like another blow to him, &ldquo;It is a very tough time for me. My father just passed away. I had to see his body and now this news, it is unbelievable. I am unable to come to terms with this news. I will definitely be going for his cremation. I will have to go.Sushant had shared a post about his late mother a few days ago, who he was missing a lot. Parag said, &ldquo;He was very close to his mother from the beginning. He would always say kash yaar meri mom meri success dekh paati. She always stayed in his heart, he loved and missed her a lot. I don&rsquo;t know what to say and it is tough to believe. He was such a doting son. I remember doing Pavitra Rishta, he father had undergone a surgery, he made sure he gets the best facilities. He would shuffle between shoots and hospitals to take care of him. He was such a nice person. I don&rsquo;t understand what his father must be going through, when I am feeling this terrible. Losing a young son, I don&rsquo;t know how he must be dealing with this loss&quot;Recalling the time Parag spent with Sushant on the sets, he said, &ldquo;During Pavitra Rishta also he would discuss scenes and improvise with me bhai aisa kar dete hain&hellip; small scenes. He would discuss and praise me if I would do a very nice scene. Abhi sab yaad aaraha hai&hellip; we would play video games on sets during break (he cries). He was a tough and strong guy. God bless his soul.

<p>Iyer Tiwari</p>
<p>In Photos: From Maanav in Pavitra Rishta to Annirudh in Chhichhore, roles that defined Sushant Singh Rajput 1 12 Tracing Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s life in films Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s tryst with the camera began with a chance sighting. Ekta Kapoor&rsquo;s casting team spotted him in a play by Nadira Babbar&rsquo;s theatre company and invited him to audition for a show. It set the ball rolling on the then-aspiring hero&rsquo;s career. A look: Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil (2008) Sushant made his television debut as Preet Juneja on this show. The character was killed early on, but was brought back as a spirit for the series finale, owing to his popularity. Pavitra Rishta (2009) The next year, he landed the lead role of Manav Deshmukh in the hit show, widely considered to be his breakout role and a stepping stone to films. While working on this Ekta Kapoor production, he also met his future girlfriend, Ankita Lokhande, who played the female lead. Kai Po Che! (2013) After participating in two dance-based reality shows— Zara Nachke Dikha 2 and Jhalak Dikhhla Ja 4—Sushant auditioned for this Abhishek Kapoor directorial, and bagged one of the three lead roles alongside Rajkummar Rao and Amit Sadh. His portrayal of former district-level cricketer Ishaan Bhatt, who falls prey to politics in the selection process, in the critical and commercial success earned him raves. Shuddh Desi Romance (2013) Sushant followed it up with this Maneesh Sharma-directed Parineeti Chopra and Vaani Kapoor co-starrer. The romance comedy-drama was set in Jaipur and revolved around youngsters’ take on love and live-in relationships. PK (2014) In Rajkumar Hirani’s satirical comedy-drama led by Aamir Khan and Anushka Sharma, Sushant had a brief yet notable role. Detective Byomkesh Bakshy (2015) Dibakar Banerjee’s mystery thriller featured the actor in the titular role, a character created by Bengali writer Sharanindu Bandopadhyay. Set in the Kolkata of the 1940s, the film was reportedly to get a sequel with Sushant reprising his role. MS Dhoni: The Untold Story (2016) Neeraj Pandey’s biographical drama that traces the journey of the eponymous former Indian skipper-wicket keeper saw Sushant take on another titular role. The film, which also featured Kiara Advani and Disha Patani, secured for Sushant his first Filmfare Best Actor nomination the following year. Raabta (2017) In Dinesh Vijan’s directorial debut, a reincarnation-themed romance actioner, Sushant was paired opposite Kriti Sanon and the duo played star-crossed lovers. The film featured Jim Sarbh, Rajkumar Yadav and Varun Dharma in supporting roles. Kedarnath (2018) The actor reunited with Abhishek ‘Gattu’ Kapoor to headline Sara Ali Khan’s launch vehicle. The inter-faith love story was set against the backdrop of the pilgrim site and revolved around a Muslim boy who falls in love with a rich Brahmin girl. Sonchiriya (2019) Co-written and directed by Abhishek Chaubey, the film is set in the Chambal ravines of 1975 and tells the story of a group of dacoits. It also featured Manoj Bajpayee, Bhumi Pednekar, Ranvir Shorey and Ashutosh Rana. Chhichhore (2019) Sushant followed it up with one of the biggest successes of his career with this Nitesh Tiwari-directed campus comedy-drama. The film won five Filmfare nods, including Best Film and Best Director. It was also Sushant’s last theatrical release.</p>
<p>The news that Sushant is no more is shocking. Yes, shocking would be the correct word to describe it as he was a person full of energy and enthusiasm. He wanted to do so many things, had so many plans, so when you hear one fine day that this person is no more, it’s hard to believe. I had to call a few friends to check if the speculation was true. Turned out it was a sad reality. And that made it even more shocking.I knew him before we collaborated on Chhichhore through common friends. I had met him on a few occasions before we started working together and grew close during the making of the film. He was like a younger brother to Ashwiny (, wife and director) and me; so full of life and excited about the projects he was doing. He wanted to launch some things. We exchanged m e s s a g e s around 10 days ago. It was just a casual chat; he enquired about Ashwiny and our kids and I asked him how he was doing. He shared that he was learning coding and I told him that my son, Aaradhya, was learning it too. As always, we ended our chat saying, “Keep in touch.”

Sushant Singh slams spiritual leader Sadhguru</p>
<p>Ex Savdhaan India host Sushant Singh, who has been on the forefront of anti-CAA protest, has slammed spiritual leader, Sadhguru. The actor took to Twitter to question Sadhguru for using his photograph for an upcoming programme in Mumbai without his permission. Sushant, who attended one of his spiritual programmes mentioned it to be &lsquo;worst experience&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Disillusioned Sushant tweeted, &lsquo;&lsquo;Dear@SadhguruJV did I give you permission to use my picture? Still, if you insist on using it, please also share it with the scathing feedback my wife and I gave your &lsquo;spiritual&rsquo; programme. Worst experience of our lives. Six sets of clothes you changed in two days, were fab though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, this didn&rsquo;t go down well with Rangoli Chandel, who is a follower of Isha Foundation. In a tweet, Rangoli wrote that she doesn&rsquo;t know who he is and even the volunteers of the programme would have not known him.</p>
<p>In another tweet, she wrote, &lsquo;&lsquo;Pl note iss bande Sushant ke pass dsnt hv a single point against d program dat teaches meditation toh kapdon se problem tu wahan kapde dekh raha tha? Millions f people benefitin frm Isha meditations or yeh badnaseeb ko wahan bhi sukoon nahi mila,iska focus kapdo pe he tha&rsquo;'.</p>
<p>For the unversed, Sushant announced his exit from the popular crime show Savdhaan India on Twitter. In a cryptic response to a follower, the actor hinted that it may be because of his participation in Citizenship Amendment Act protests. However, the channel denied any sort of politics behind his removal.</p>
<p>And, my stint with Savdhaan India has ended. — सुशांत सिंह sushant singh سوشانت سنگھ (@sushant_says) December 16, 2019</p>
