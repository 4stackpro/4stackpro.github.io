ABOVE: COURTESY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF SUNDERLAND ALUMNI ASSOCIATION AND GITA RAMJEE’S FAMILY</p>
<p>Gita Ramjee, a South African scientist renowned for her work to expand women’s access to HIV treatment and prevention, died yesterday (March 31) from complications related to COVID-19. Ramjee was the chief scientific officer of the Aurum Institute, a nonprofit organization based in Johannesburg that focuses on HIV and tuberculosis research, and had just returned from a symposium in the UK when she became ill with the virus. She was 64 years old.</p>
<p>“Gita was a vibrant person, a real fighter,” the Aurum Institute’s CEO, Gavin Churchyard, tells the BBC. “That will be my lasting memory of her—how she fought with everything to advance access to healthcare for women in disadvantaged communities.”</p>
<p>Ramjee grew up in Uganda. After the military dictator Idi Amin came to power in the early 1970s, she moved with her family to India and later to the UK. In 1980, she obtained a degree in chemistry and physiology from the University of Sunderland in northeast England, and then relocated again, this time to South Africa with her husband in 1981.</p>
<p>She obtained a PhD in pediatrics from the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban in 1994—a feat that she described in an interview with The Guardian in 2007 as a balancing act between studying and caring for the two sons she had by that point. “I used to get up at six in the morning,” she said, “prepare food, wake my children, send them off to school, do a half day of practical work, come back, pick my sons up from school, help them do their homework and send them to sleep”—and then get up at 2 A.M. to work on her thesis.</p>
<p>It was after her PhD that she became involved in research with women at risk of HIV infection. She went on to head the South African Medical Research Council’s HIV prevention research unit in Durban where she oversaw many trials on HIV prevention tools, including vaginal microbicides, products that could help women protect themselves against HIV infection. She also held honorary professorships at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and the University of Washington in Seattle, among others.</p>
<p>“Gita was an inspirational role model for young scientists including women scientists in South Africa and beyond,” reads a statement from the LSHTM. “LSHTM is proud to have been associated with her and we send our deep condolences to her family and friends all over the world.”</p>
<p>LSHTM director Peter Piot says in the statement that he is “deeply saddened” to hear of her death. “I have known Gita for many years,” he adds, “and it is hard to overstate her ground-breaking scientific contributions and unwavering commitment to HIV prevention, particularly for women and girls in Africa.”</p>

<p>Ramjee received the Outstanding Female Scientist award from the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership in 2018 in recognition of her work on HIV prevention. Speaking to the University of Sunderland alumni association shortly after receiving the award, she noted “a need for [a] more holistic approach to HIV prevention, which should include reproductive health care for women” in developing countries.</p>
<p>“I will continue to work with international donors to set the global health agenda,” she told the association, “and prioritize areas of research which will have the greatest impact on the lives of young women, and on public health in general.”

One of first COVID-19 victims has links to Soutpansberg</p>
<p>One of the first victims of the coronavirus, Prof Gita Ramjee, has several family links to Louis Trichardt. Her husband, Praveen Ramjee, was born here and grew up in the town.</p>
<p>Prof Ramjee, from Westville, died on Tuesday in the Umhlanga Hospital from COVID-19-related complications. She recently travelled to London where she visited her two sons, who live there.</p>
<p>Prof Ramjee was a very influential and highly decorated South African scientist. At the time of her death, she was the chief scientific officer at the Aurum Institute and a former chief specialist scientist and director of the HIV Prevention Research Unit of the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC).</p>
<p>She was married to Praveen Ramjee, a pharmacist from Durban. He is the youngest son of the late Mr Kalan Ramjee from Louis Trichardt, who owned Ramjee Store (presently Khoja&rsquo;s Fabrics). The two other sons, Kishore and Tribhovan Ramjee,live in Durban.</p>
<p>Her younger sister, Rita, married Bhadrish Kalan, who previously lived in Louis Trichardt. The Kalan and Ramjee families are two of the pioneer trading families from the region.

<h3 id="renowned-indian-origin-virologist-gita-ramjee-dies-of-covid-19-in-south-africa">Renowned Indian-Origin Virologist Gita Ramjee Dies Of COVID-19 In South Africa</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e84168c2700006000a67680.jpeg?ops=1200_630" alt="img">
Ramjee, 64, was the Clinical Trials Unit Principal Investigator and Unit Director of the HIV Prevention Research Unit of the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC) offices in Durban.</p>
<p>Ramjee, a stellar vaccine scientist and an HIV prevention research leader, had returned from London a week ago but reportedly showed no symptoms of COVID-19.</p>
<p>So far five people have died in South Africa from COVID-19.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBERG — World-renowned virologist Gita Ramjee became the first Indian-origin South African to die after contracting the novel coronavirus in the country.</p>
<p>For the latest news and more, follow HuffPost India on Twitter, Facebook, and subscribe to our newsletter.</p>
<p>“We are deeply saddened to inform you of the tragic passing of Prof Gita Ramjee in hospital today,” said a statement issued by SAMRC President and CEO Glenda Gray.</p>
<p>“Prof Ramjee died of COVID-19 related complications,” Gray added.</p>
<p>In 2018, Ramjee was presented with the Outstanding Female Scientist Award in Lisbon by the European Development Clinical Trials Partnerships (EDCTP) for her lifetime commitment to finding new HIV prevention methods, which are conducive to the lifestyles, circumstances and perceived risk factors that South African women are faced with.</p>
<p>“This award is an acknowledgement of the unwavering determination by a global community to forever change the trajectory of the HIV/AIDS epidemic,” she had said at the time.</p>
<p>“Professor Gita Ramjee is a towering HIV prevention research leader whose work continues to contribute immensely to the global response to curb the HIV/AIDS epidemic,” Gray had said after the Indian-origin scientist received the award.</p>
<p>Ramjee was married to pharmacist Pravin Ramjee, a South African of Indian descent.</p>
<p>Her funeral arrangements have not been announced. Attendance at funerals in South Africa is highly restricted and requires permits as the country is going through a 21-day nationwide lockdown announced last week by President Cyril Ramaphosa.</p>
<p>Five South Africans have died from COVID-19 since Sunday, the third day of the lockdown. Over 13,50 cases have been reported in the country so far.</p>
<p>The South African government on Tuesday announced that it will double to 10,000 the teams going door-to-door to test people for COVID-19, mainly in the overcrowded Black townships created during the apartheid era.</p>
<p>On Sunday evening, in a national broadcast, Ramaphosa cautioned thousands of South Africans who have not been taking the lockdown seriously.</p>
<p>The death toll from the rapidly-spreading coronavirus pandemic has risen to 41,654 and over 850,580 people have been infected by the deadly virus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
