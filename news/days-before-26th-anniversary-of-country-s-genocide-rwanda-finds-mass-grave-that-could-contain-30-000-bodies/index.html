<p>Associated Press</p>
<p>KIGALI, Rwanda — A valley dam that authorities in Rwanda say could contain about 30,000 bodies has been discovered more than a quarter-century after the country’s genocide in which 800,000 ethnic Tutsi and Hutus who tried to protect them were killed.</p>
<p>The discovery is being called the most significant in years, and 50 bodies have been exhumed so far in efforts that are challenged by the East African nation’s coronavirus-related lockdown.</p>
<p>Rwanda on Tuesday marks the 26th anniversary of the genocide, but because of the lockdown the country will follow events on television and social media as gatherings are banned.</p>
<p>Word of the valley dam and the bodies it held emerged as many people convicted in the genocide are being released from prison after serving their sentences and offering new information on mass graves. Other information on the dam came from nearby residents.</p>
<p>“The challenge we face now is that the valley dam contains water, but we are trying to dry it up,” Naphtal Ahishakiye, the executive secretary of genocide survivor organization Ibuka, told The Associated Press. The valley is outside the capital, Kigali, in the country’s east.</p>
<p>Authorities said the dam was dug years before the genocide to provide water for rice farming.</p>
<p>Every now and then, as graves of genocide victims are discovered, some survivors question whether true reconciliation can be realized if perpetrators of the killings conceal information about where people were buried.</p>
<p>Exhuming bodies during the coronavirus pandemic is very challenging since people cannot gather, Ahishakiye said. “But we try our best so that we give the dead a decent burial.”

<h3 id="author-describes-the-horror-persecution-and-government-cover-up-of-rwandas-genocide-in-new-book">Author Describes The Horror, Persecution, and Government Cover-up of Rwanda&rsquo;s Genocide in New Book</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png" alt="img">
It has been 26 years since the Rev. Christine Coleman experienced the bloody and horrific 1994 genocide that plagued the African nation of Rwanda. The country&rsquo;s spring opened a terrifying killing season that grew into an apocalyptic nightmare that few have escaped.</p>
<p>DENVER, April 6, 2020 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ &ndash; It has been 26 years since the Rev. Christine Coleman experienced the bloody and horrific 1994 genocide that plagued the African nation of Rwanda. The country&rsquo;s spring opened a terrifying killing season that grew into an apocalyptic nightmare that few have escaped. Since then, the blood of millions of innocent men, women and children has soaked into Rwanda&rsquo;s soil as Paul Kagame&rsquo;s death squads follow their leaders&rsquo; orders.</p>
<p>Coleman, a Christian human rights activist and motivational speaker, turned her personal story and harrowing experiences into a powerful new book called SOS: Rwanda&rsquo;s 30-Year Apocalypse which is available on her website: <a href="https://christinecoleman.org/">https://christinecoleman.org/</a>.</p>
<p>During the Rwandan genocide, members of the Hutu majority murdered as many as 800,000 people—mainly people who belonged to the Tutsi minority.</p>
<p>Coleman takes readers through Rwanda&rsquo;s history sharing details that few outside the country would know. She describes a country that has paid dearly for its trusting nature, that endures the terror of religious persecution, and whose people are afraid of publicly speaking out about the government&rsquo;s abuses because, even in their own homes, they are spied on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rwanda is the only country I know of where citizens are not allowed to think and choose for themselves,&rdquo; she noted. &ldquo;Citizens are told what to wear, parents are told how many children they can have, farmers are told what to plant and when to harvest and who to sell to, and public servants are told who to follow on twitter. Anyone who does not follow orders is perceived as an enemy of the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coleman further describes Rwandan society as a world of intimidation, harassment, lies, deception and, often, death. No one is immune and living abroad does not guarantee Rwandans&rsquo; safety. They wait for the rest of the world to see what is happening, what their government has so swiftly, quietly, and efficiently covered up for so long.</p>
<p>The book contains stories from Coleman&rsquo;s friends, acquaintances, and national icons. Many of them have been silenced forever by a power-hungry regime that turned a peaceful nation that she describes as &ldquo;naïve,&rdquo; to one that weeps and has had their basic human rights stripped from them. Coleman made sure that their stories did not die in vain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am here to sound the alarm! I&rsquo;m here to tell you the truth of what has happened, and is happening still, in Rwanda,&rdquo; Coleman says. &ldquo;Rwanda needs your help.&rdquo;</p>
