<p>Yussuf Poulsen&rsquo;s agent has shot down rumors claiming that the 25-year-old wants to depart RB Leipzig.</p>

<p>Yussuf Poulsen&rsquo;s agent, Poul-Erik Petersen, has dismissed a report from Sport Bild claiming that his client is looking to leave RB Leipzig this summer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no truth in this at all. Yussuf hasn&rsquo;t asked to leave, and there are no negotiations with other clubs,&rdquo; Petersen told Danish media outlet TV 2.</p>
<p>Poulsen has been linked with Newcastle United among other clubs, but Petersen is unaware of any concrete interest from the Premier League side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t had any contact with the club at all. I can categorically deny this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reports have suggested that Poulsen isn&rsquo;t happy with his playing time at Leipzig, but Petersen makes it clear that the Danish international feels very comfortable at the club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s being presented as if he almost isn&rsquo;t playing, and that&rsquo;s not the case at all. [RB Leipzig] are a top club in Europe and are in the Champions League. There must be competition at such a place. He has faced that challenge before,&rdquo; Petersen said and added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to make it clear that Yussuf loves being in Leipzig, and that&rsquo;s basically where he sees himself at the moment. But if the situation continues to be as it is at the moment, it&rsquo;s logical that he doesn&rsquo;t want to be a &lsquo;reserve of honor&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poulsen has made 29 appearances for RB Leipzig this season, racking up three goals and 11 assists.</p>

<h3 id="liverpool-target-werner-can-play-for-the-biggest-clubs-in-the-world-says-rb-leipzig-team-mate-adams">Liverpool target Werner can play for &lsquo;the biggest clubs in the world&rsquo;, says RB Leipzig team-mate Adams</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ziq2LMOAeL8ZqXaSwzr.vQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tiIWS_p5vAoR4EMBBP31Vw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/uk.goal.com/bb953b591d5053b13e023b75f82f306c" alt="img">
In-demand forward Timo Werner is a &ldquo;pleasure to play with&rdquo; and could turn out for any of &ldquo;the biggest clubs in the world&rdquo;, according to Tyler Adams, his team-mate at RB Leipzig.</p>
<p>German international Werner has scored 27 goals in 36 club appearances this season for the Bundesliga side, piquing the interest of heavyweight clubs around Europe.</p>
<p>Werner’s electric form has attracted attention from the likes of Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea, and the 24-year-old has indicated he is keen on a move to the Premier League.</p>

<p>United States international midfielder Adams, a team-mate of Werner at Leipzig since 2017, praised him as &ldquo;a great guy and a great player&rdquo;, and said his all-round talents mean he could shine for any major club in world football.</p>
<p>Tyler Adams RB Leipzig</p>
<p>When asked what Werner&rsquo;s greatest strength is, Adams told ESPN: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to say one thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are often focused not just on his goalscoring ability but how fast he is, he&rsquo;s absolutely rapid. That&rsquo;s not one of the qualities that sticks out the most.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The quality that sticks out the most is how many ways he&rsquo;s able to score. He can score from the left, the right, centrally, we played him as a number ten and he was running out of the midfield and scoring goals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just so many roles you can fit him in, that&rsquo;s what makes him such a unique piece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re able to score in that many different ways, you&rsquo;ll be able to play at the highest level for a really long time, for the biggest clubs in the world, for the national team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a pleasure to play with. It makes it easy playing as a midfielder knowing you can play the ball over the top and he&rsquo;ll catch it no matter what. He&rsquo;s a great guy and a great player.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Werner scored 21 goals in 25 Bundesliga matches this campaign before the season was put on indefinite hold due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>He was widely expected to leave Leipzig this summer, but the uncertain situation brought about by Covid-19, plus his contract at the club running until 2023, means he may be denied a big-money move for the time being.</p>
<p>Leipzig sporting director Markus Krosche told Sport 1: &ldquo;We do not know how the transfer market is developing. We are looking into a very foggy glass ball. We do not know what our resources are and what the other clubs have in terms of opportunities.&rdquo;

<h3 id="tyler-adams-exclusive-the-rb-leipzig-man-on-coronavirus-studying-psychology-and-eventually-winning-the-bundesliga">Tyler Adams exclusive: the RB Leipzig man on coronavirus, studying psychology and eventually winning the Bundesliga</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.bundesliga.com/tachyon/sites/2/2020/03/Z6L_1267.jpg?crop=0px,0px,1918px,1080px&amp;fit=533,300" alt="img">
It has been anything but a straightforward campaign for RB Leipzig and USA midfielder Tyler Adams. Having made a brilliant start to life in the Bundesliga after his move from the New York Red Bulls, the 21-year-old has seen his progress halted by a series of injuries, limiting him to just five league outings this season.</p>
<p>The current coronavirus outbreak means that Adams will have to wait a few weeks longer – at least until the start of May – to make his comeback for Die Roten Bullen, who currently trail Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund in the Bundesliga title race.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Leipzig&rsquo;s rising star sat down for an exclusive chat with bundesliga.com, explaining how he is helping out Americans back home during the coronavirus crisis, keeping busy by studying psychology online, and focusing on his ultimate goal of lifting the Meisterschale.</p>
<p>Watch: Adams teed up Yussuf Poulsen for the second of his two Bundesliga assists in last season&rsquo;s 5-0 demolition of Hertha Berlin (skip to 01:15)</p>
<p>bundesliga.com: Tyler Adams, you&rsquo;ve had a rather unusual 2019/20. You missed the first half of the campaign with injury, came back, got injured again, and then just as you were approaching full fitness, the Bundesliga was suspended due to the coronavirus outbreak…</p>
<p>Tyler Adams: &ldquo;I know that these are definitely difficult circumstances to deal with right now. But I think for me personally, it’s just about following the guidelines and doing all the right things, so football can come back sooner rather than later. Obviously, there are things that are more important, and we’re seeing that right in front of our eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>bundesliga.com: As you say, some things are more important. To that end, along with fellow USA teammates Weston McKennie and Christian Pulisic, you&rsquo;ve teamed up with Feeding America to help people back home deal with the consequences of the coronavirus&hellip;</p>
<p>Adams: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always someone who values the importance of other peoples&rsquo; well-being before my own. Being able to make a donation to something like that means a lot to us. We know that this non-profit organisation will be able to do a lot with the money we&rsquo;ve donated. Those are things that are important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>bundesliga.com: How are you keeping busy during lockdown?</p>
<p>Adams: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still studying psychology at an online university, which has helped me kind of stay in tune with the day and not lose too much focus. I&rsquo;m trying to minimise downtime as much as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>bundesliga.com: You&rsquo;ve been limited to just five Bundesliga appearances this season, but the club clearly believes in you - Julian Nagelsmann made you a first-team regular after your arrival from New York in January 2019, and you&rsquo;ve just signed a contract extension through to 2025…</p>
<p>Adams: &ldquo;Although I&rsquo;m not playing, I&rsquo;m still learning a lot, under a new manager, the tactics and stuff like that. I&rsquo;ve still learned a lot of new information and I&rsquo;m trying to process that kind of stuff. When I&rsquo;m fully fit and ready to go again, I&rsquo;m entering the season buzzing, and I&rsquo;m ready to make a big impact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>bundesliga.com: At just 21 years of age, you&rsquo;ve already had to deal with a fair amount of adversity, especially in terms of injuries. How hard is it to cope with these setbacks?</p>
<p>Adams: &ldquo;I think for me as a young player, it&rsquo;s important to have a season like this. It&rsquo;s going to be good to look back on that and say, &lsquo;that was a tough part of my career, but now I&rsquo;m entering the best part of my career&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>bundesliga.com: Leipzig are currently third in the Bundesliga behind Bayern and Dortmund. Assuming the remaining nine league games can be played, what&rsquo;s the objective for the rest of 2019/20?</p>
<p>Adams: &ldquo;I think that as a team, we know that our goal is to win the Bundesliga. As an individual, that&rsquo;s my goal. All I&rsquo;ve ever wanted to do is win!&rdquo;
