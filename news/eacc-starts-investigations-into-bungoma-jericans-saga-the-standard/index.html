EACC starts investigations into Bungoma jericans saga</p>
<p>The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) has launched investigations into the controversy surrounding the purchase of 600 20-litre jerricans at Sh10,000 each by the county government.</p>
<p>Besides the jerricans, the county government also bought personal protective equipment, including face masks, gloves and thermos guards at questionable prices.</p>
<p>The items were meant to enhance the county&rsquo;s preparedness in the fight against coronavirus spread.</p>
<p>Yassin Amaro, a commissioner at the anti-graft body, said yesterday they had started gathering crucial evidence that would help unravel the matter.</p>
<p>SEE ALSO: After Sonko, EACC now sets its sights on Elachi</p>
<p>“We have embarked on investigations with the intention of prosecuting officers involved in the syndicate. We shall leave no stone unturned,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Mr Amaro said the county would serve as an example to other devolved units that may be tempted to misuse resources raised towards combating Covid-19.</p>
<p>He said the affected officers would be arrested and arraigned once EACC has gathered evidence.</p>

<p>The move comes barely three days after Governor Wycliffe Wangamati absolved himself from blame over the purchase of the jerricans, insisting the containers were a donation to his administration by well-wishers and the Bungoma Business Community.</p>
<p>However, the county could not give names of the well-wishers.</p>

<p>EACC investigations have narrowed down to 10 officials who cashed cheques worth Sh6.986 million in a day at a local bank.</p>
<p>Governor Wangamati has insisted that the county received 368 jerricans as a donation from friends.</p>
<p>The jerricans were to be distributed to at least 600 markets for hand-washing as a measure to control the spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p>“Let it be known that we don’t have 600 jerricans out there but 368,&rdquo; said Wangamati.</p>

<p>Fresh details have emerged on the suspected multi-million-shilling scandal that has rocked Covid-19 fight in Bungoma County.</p>
<p>The Nation is in possession of documents that reveal how up to Sh6.9 million was withdrawn from the county’s bank account in a single day and handed to county staff who paid suppliers in cash.</p>
<p>On March 18, nine cheques of Sh776,223 each were drawn from the county’s account at Kenya Commercial Bank, according to investigations by the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC).</p>
<p>“The big withdrawals are very suspect and are in violation of public procurement law,” said a manager at EACC Bungoma office.</p>
<p>“Anything above Sh10,000 requires tendering and we don’t withdraw cash to pay suppliers. The money should be wired.”</p>
<p>From the bank payments schedule, the recipients of the cash include Carolyne Nabalayo, Kizito Wabwile, Noel Nalyaka, Kevin Namulala, Pamela Serut, Martin Nyongesa and three hospital employees.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The suppliers include a shadowy firm that supplied 600 handwashing jerrycans, which Governor Wycliffe Wangamati claimed were “donated” but could not name the alleged donors.</p>
<p>“We are not naming the firm at this stage because we are still looking into their case,” the EACC manager said.</p>
<p>Minutes of the county Covid-19 committee meeting dated March 23 reveal the jerrycans were among items that had already been procured by the county’s department of special programmes.</p>
<p>“We have acquired the following and are being stored at Mabanga Farmers Training Centre: 600 bottles of sanitisers; 600 bottles of hand washing soap; 600 units of 20-litre taped jerrycans and 20,000 information flyers,” Ms Carolyne Buyela, the county director of special programmes, told the meeting.</p>
<p>Sources in the governor’s office and the county assembly yesterday told the Nation that the containers that are said to have cost Sh10,000 apiece were bought in Nairobi.</p>
<p>“The supplier was paid Sh1,400 per jerrycan and we just don’t understand how the containers cost Sh10,000,” a source, who sought anonymity due to sensitivity of the matter, told the Nation.</p>
<p>On Monday, it emerged that the supplier of the containers was under intense pressure from the executive to change the nature of their business transaction to a donation.</p>
<p>The Sh6.9 million was borrowed from Bungoma County Referral Hospital by the county’s Finance Chief Officer Jonathan Namulala.</p>
<p>EACC yesterday said it had started investigations into the scandal, with letters summoning suspects being released today.</p>
<p>The commission is expected to cast its net wider to put under spotlight other suspicious expenditures by the county’s Covid-19 committee.</p>
<p>They include the alleged purchase of Sh3,000 mattresses at Sh10,000 and gloves that go for less than Sh2,500 per box at Sh10,000.</p>
<p>Mr Wangamati on Saturday maintained that his government had not embezzled any money and accused his rivals of using his war on Covid-19 to settle political scores.</p>
<p>He said anyone with evidence on the alleged looting should present it to EACC.</p>
<p>But in a related development, hired goons Monday attacked human rights activists and a blogger as they addressed the media on the alleged scandal.</p>
<p>Mr Barasa Nyukuri of Centre for Human Rights Advocacy and blogger Ikue Ikue were injured and were treated at Bungoma Referral Hospital.</p>
<p>They demanded the resignation of officers accused of looting from the public by cooking figures in Covid-19 budgets.

<p>Bungoma Governor Wycliffe Wangamati has been taken to task on how Sh11 million given to the county coronavirus response team has been utilised.</p>
<p>Senator Moses Wetang’ula on Thursday joined a number of ward representatives in demanding accountability in the utilisation of the funds.</p>
<p>Addressing the press in Nairobi, Mr Wetang’ula said he is bothered by reports of mismanagement, adding that the devolved government should clear the air fast.</p>
<p>“I have received reports from the media and other sources of a possibility of misuse of public funds even as we are battling coronavirus. We are aware the fight against this virus requires funds. However, we demand transparency and accountability in the manner the Bungoma County government is using the money,” Mr Wetang’ula said.</p>
<p>According to the ward representatives, Mr Wangamati’s administration bought 600 20-litre jerrycans at Sh10,000 each.</p>
<p>The devolved government bought the containers to distribute to residents in a handwashing drive.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>PROBE MATTER</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health has called on Kenyans to wash or sanitise their hands in a bid to contain the spread of the virus that has killed more than 83,000 people globally.</p>
<p>Covid-19 has infected 184 Kenyans and killed seven, with hundreds in isolation.</p>
<p>According to Senator Wetang’ula, a jerrycan goes for Sh1,000 in Nairobi and Sh1,500 in Bungoma.</p>
<p>“Without a doubt, this is misuse of public funds and there is need for accountability on how they are allocated and used. I call on the relevant authorities, including the county budget allocation committee, treasury as well as the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission to investigate this matter swiftly,” Mr Wetang’ula said.</p>
<p>Addressing the press at the county assembly, the more than 20 ward representatives said that they have evidence that money taken from Bungoma County and Webuye referral hospitals to fight the pandemic has been embezzled.</p>
<p>During an interview at Sulwe FM on Monday, the governor said some money might have been misappropriated by officials in his administration, which the assembly should investigate.</p>
<p>“It is true that questions have been raised on how that money was spent, but once the assembly completes the investigations, we will take the necessary action,” Mr Wangamati said.</p>
<p>FUNDS EMBEZZLED</p>
<p>Correspondence seen by the Nation shows that acting Finance Chief Officer Jonathan Namulala borrowed Sh11 million from the two hospitals.</p>
<p>County Assembly Health Committee Chairman George Makari said it is unfortunate that the correspondence on how the money was used reveals glaring misappropriation.</p>
<p>“We wrote to the people concerned as an assembly committee and expected answers but they have not. This is the height of impunity. The documents in our possession show that money was misappropriated,” the Musikoma Ward Representative said.</p>
<p>His Lwandanyi counterpart Tonny Barasa said the files show the cost of a plastic jerrycan to be Sh10,000.</p>
<p>“Where in this world does one buy a jerrycan for such an amount? County government officials are playing with our minds when Kenya is in the middle of a crisis,” Mr Barasa said.</p>
<p>The devolved government Special Programmes department bought the jerrycans, water tanks and other material to be distributed to markets, shopping centres, matatu terminals, offices and a host of other public places last week.
