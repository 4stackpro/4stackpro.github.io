<p>The Yahoo Fantasy analysts will preview all 32 NFL teams between now and the eventual start of the 2020 draft season. Here, we’ll tackle pressing fantasy questions, #FantasyHotTaeks, and team win totals. Next up, the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>
<p>Miles Sanders’s current ADP is right at the top of the third round. Is this a wishful draft spot, or are you willing to select him at this spot?</p>
<p>Scott: The Eagles usually love their backfield platoons, so I still live in fear that they’re going to add a curious veteran. They were linked to Carlos Hyde, though that eventually didn’t happen. In recent years, Philadelphia was the surprising harbor for Jordan Howard, Jay Ajayi, and LeGarrette Blount. If you can still run without your knees popping, ring the Eagles.</p>
<p>Scroll to continue with content Ad</p>
<p>But upside is a gigantic part of fantasy football (obviously not a new concept), and Sanders offers that. And his current Yahoo ADP (22) is a giveaway if you consider at the global market; Sanders has an ADP of 9.79 over the last month of NFFC drafting. Eventually, this discussion will morph into “Do you dare take Sanders around the 1-2 turn?” But for now, he’s priced favorably and enthusiastically approved. Play to win, gamers.</p>
<p>Matt: I’m all-in at that cost. The Eagles have always used a committee approach under Doug Pederson. Sure, that’s true, but honestly, I don’t blame him for not deploying LeGarrette Blount, Wendell Smallwood, or any of the other middling options that hung around the depth chart in previous years. I just don’t think that’s a useful anecdote considering we’ve never seen a player with Miles Sanders’ combination ability, youth, and draft capital spent on the Eagles roster in the Pederson era. This same Philadelphia coaching staff trusted Sanders with a heavy workload to end 2019, as he averaged over 19 touches per game to close his rookie season. If he sees that volume as the lead man this season, he’s an easy bet to meet or beat his ADP.</p>
<p>Story continues</p>
<p>Liz: After Jordan Howard suffered a shoulder injury in Week 9 of last year, Sanders averaged 19 touches per contest. Given the current state of Philly’s backfield, with Howard now in Miami and Darren Sproles enjoying retirement, the Penn State product figures to see a similar volume in 2020. Sure, creative wrinkles and gadget work from the talents of Jalen Reagor and Jalen Hurts could siphon away some of Sanders’ opportunities … but that’s going to take a minute. Figuring he manages a 300-touch season, there’s no reason he can’t be a top-12 producer. For context, I like him after Josh Jacobs, but ahead of Austin Ekler.</p>
<p>[Create or join a 2020 Yahoo Fantasy Football League for free today]</p>
<p>2019 was the third-straight season Zach Ertz finished as a top-5 tight end, and his ADP reflects that (46.9). Do you think he delivers again, or is his draft cost too high?</p>
<p>Liz: Last summer there was a lot of discussion about Ertz being over-drafted because his target volume was likely to dwindle with various receivers back to health, and the additions of DeSean Jackson and JJ Arcega-Whiteside. We all know how that worked out.</p>
<p>The same argument could be used again this year. It’s possible that both of the Eagles’ 30-plus-year-old WRs stay on the field. Or that JJAWs breaks out and Jalen Reagor shines. All of which could take away from Ertz’s opportunities. Ultimately, however, Ertz is a proven key to Philly’s success. Per PFF, he’s not only gained the fifth-most yards from the slot by a TE in a single season since 2015 but he’s also ranked one of the five most valuable Eagles over the past decade.</p>
<p>He’s a proven stud at a volatile position … so his floor demands early-round capital. He’s the Yahoo consensus TE4.</p>
<p>Matt: Zach Ertz has averaged just over five catches per game in four of the last five seasons, with 2018 being the lone outlier. He hit 7.3 that season. It’s clear that was the outlier campaign. We watched as his targets dropped from 156 in 16 games in 2018 to 135 in 15 games last year. All that said, you have to rank him as a top-five tight end. So few players at the position are locked into 120-plus looks while tethered to a stable quarterback at the head of a good offense. Whether you feel compelled to take him is dependent on your roster construction and how you like the RB/WR options on the board around his ADP. But he’s a fine option this year, as usual.</p>
<p>Scott: I say this regretfully, because Ertz is one of my all-time favorites, and he has a special mind-meld with Carson Wentz. But Ertz quietly had a modest opportunity dip last year despite the Philadelphia wideouts morphing into Spinal Tap drummers. Forget if the Philly wideouts can play; if they can simply stay on the field (most of them), Ertz is a tricky bet into his age-30 season. With a juicy upside pool of tight ends (and some studs at the top of the queue), Ertz is essentially left in no-man’s land. I’ll root from afar in 2020, save for the occasional DFS punch.</p>
<p>The Eagles were a mess at wide receiver last season. Is there anyone among Alshon Jeffery, DeSean Jackson, Jalen Reagor, and JJ Arcega-Whiteside you see as a bargain in 2020?</p>
<p>Matt: No. There isn’t a single Eagles wide receiver I will make a priority target in drafts this year. Alshon Jeffery isn’t a lock to start the season healthy. DeSean Jackson is well into the back-nine of his career. JJ Arcega-Whiteside had “one of these things doesn’t look like the other” intrigue in a receiver corps of small speedsters, but showed exactly nothing as a rookie. In a normal offseason, Jalen Reagor would be interesting but he needs work to develop and that time will be short in this COVID-adjusted world. I’ll just wait to see what happens here and won’t be invested.</p>
<p>Scott: Jeffery keeps leaking oil, losing efficiency, and having trouble staying on the field. Jackson enters his age-34 season and hasn’t gone the 16-game route since 2013. JJAW showed nothing last year, and Reagor is a rookie at a curious time for an onboard (to be fair, several rookies popped in 2011, amid circumstances that were also unusual). I suspect the depth of Philly’s pass-catchers could lead me to an affordable Carson Wentz ticket, and I’m sure there’s wideout profit here, somewhere. But none of these receivers are proactive picks for me, not right now anyway.</p>
<p>[2020 Draft Rankings: Overall | QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | DST | Kickers]</p>
<p>Liz: I’m admittedly high on Reagor. His craftiness paired with his speed is certainly intriguing. However, I’m interested to see what JJAWS does this season. The second-round selection from a year ago spent much of his rookie campaign banged up. Battling a severe lower-body injury for most of the season, the former Cardinal wasn’t able to showcase his top-notch ball-tracking ability or his contested catch prowess. If he can stay healthy and earn enough reps to build chemistry with Wentz, he could surpass Alshon (who’s dealing with an injured foot and some spilled tea) as the team’s X receiver. Attached to an ascending QB and part of a prolific offense, there’s sleeper potential there for sure.</p>
<p>Philadelphia Eagles 2020 projected lineup</p>
<p>#FantasyHotTaek</p>
<p>Matt: Miles Sanders beats or meets the optimism his ADP suggests and Boston Scott finishes as a top-40 RB in PPR formats. I truly believe this offense will once again run through its tight ends and running backs in the pass game this season. It wouldn’t shock me to see Sanders and Scott combine for over 110 catches. Scott was a positive presence on the team to end last year, catching 23 passes over the final four weeks. I don’t think he loses his role. The lack of reliable slot options in this offense makes him a good option to see snaps as a short area receiver.</p>
<p>OVER/UNDER on 9.5 Win Total from BetMGM</p>
<p>Scott: It’s a fair number and a centered one; you get the under at even money, and only pay the slight -120 bump on the over. I’m going to give a slight UNDER lean for a few reasons; I like Dallas’s roster better inside the NFC East, and I’m not thrilled about the AFC North and NFC West full-division draws. The Eagles fell short of this number in three of the four Wentz seasons, though that other year was certainly worth it. The Eagles may or may not have full ascent this year, but Flags Fly Forever.</p>

<h3 id="liz-hall-it-starts-with-culture-and-flows-down-into-investing">&ldquo;Liz Hall: &lsquo;It Starts With Culture And Flows Down Into Investing&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2020/6/13/11236431-15920329333082266_origin.png" alt="img">
If nothing else her original way of thinking will inspire reflection.</p>
<p>She believes Elon Musk is the greatest CEO of all time.</p>
<p>Without any formal education, Liz is emerging as a &ldquo;Fintwit&rdquo; must follow.</p>
<p>Lizz Hall is an independent investor who evolved the value investing philosophy into a very flexible intuitive approach. Without any formal education, she started out in investing shortly before the Great Financial Crisis.</p>
<p>She then somehow managed to invest a concentrated portfolio into General Growth Properties, today this is still known as the Howard Hughes Company (HHC), and then took a position in Monster Beverages (MNST). The graphs below illustrate the trajectory these took.</p>
<p>A few years later she parlayed those wins with an investment into Amazon (AMZN). If you invested in one of these and held it over time your portfolio probably did great. Imagine buying all three.</p>
<p>Image: via Business Insider</p>
<p>She sold Monster somewhere along the way:</p>
<p>Data by YCharts</p>
<p>Data by YCharts</p>
<p>She calls it luck but I&rsquo;m not so sure. Sure, to an extent the real great outcomes in the stock market are always luck. But the fact is she selected, invested and held a number of huge winners, while also developing an investment philosophy that&rsquo;s rooted in fundamental value but over time evolved into a more expansive approach.</p>
<p>I really wanted to talk to Liz about some of her specific investments that we get into as well as some of her investment thoughts, some of which are highly original.</p>
<p>For example, Liz finds ideas through immersion in culture. This can be used widely but we discuss it related to gaming and Games Workshop (OTCPK:GMWKF), Hasbro properties (HAS) and Blizzard (ATVI).</p>
<p>Some of her principles in quotes:</p>
<p>Changes in a business’s growth trajectory often swamp the merits of valuation, to both the upside and the downside. Favorable inflections can sometimes make you a killing. -Liz Hall</p>
<p>One example is an investment into Target (TGT) which we discuss.</p>
<p>Some of the most basic setups are basically just capital structure arbitrage. Have doubled my money on $MAR from the company replacing higher cost equity with lower cost debt. Doesn’t always work out but when it does it’s like putting biz performance on steroids. -Liz Hall</p>
<p>Looking for big announced buyback programs where you expect management to follow through while you like the underlying is not a completely foreign tactic. I try to employ this weapon in The Special Situations report but it&rsquo;s been fairly challenging to find situations I really like. We discuss this in regards to Marriott (MAR).</p>
<p>She also explains to me why Elon Musk of Tesla (TSLA) is the greatest CEO of all time. I still don&rsquo;t agree with that exact conclusion. But I&rsquo;m on the wrong end of learning about the power of a strong narrative combined with intermittent share issuance. I definitely gained another way to look at the battle between the bulls and bears in the Tesla story.</p>
<p>One thing I really liked when I looked through Liz&rsquo;s portfolio (full ticker list below excluding OTC names) is that there&rsquo;s a very defensive undercurrent. She says it isn&rsquo;t a conscious thing but if she had said she lives by the Buffett adagium of &ldquo;rule number 1 don&rsquo;t lose money, rule number 2 don&rsquo;t lose money&rdquo; I would have believed it.</p>
<p>The defensive properties that I see here do vary but they make it very unlikely these businesses will disappear within 5-10 years.</p>
<p>There are a few that have very high insider ownership where a great operator is extremely invested in its success like Amazon and Constellation (NYSE:STZ).</p>
<p>There are quite a few that are (or serve) essential retail operations like pharmacies and grocery stores.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s Altria (MO) which is obviously a business that just doesn&rsquo;t seem to go away even though many wish it would.</p>
<p>Defense spending can decrease but it&rsquo;s never going away.</p>
<p>Even a seemingly cyclical name like Texas Pacific Land (TPL) looks like it&rsquo;s tied to the Permian but there&rsquo;s no debt there and its revenue can go down, but because it primarily owns royalties on land it will live on even after the entire shale sector busts.</p>
<p>Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon could see share temporary multiple contractions and revenue contractions but they have extremely strong balance sheets.</p>
<p>Portfolio:</p>
<p>Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Altria, Amazon (AMZN), GCI Liberty (GLIBA), Constellation Software (OTCPK:CNSWF), Urstadt Biddle Properties (UBP.PK),Target, Wayfair (W), Games Workshop, Nintendo (OTCPK:NTDOY), Chewy (CHWY), Texas Pacific Land Trust (TPL), Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD), Lockheed Martin Technology (LMT), World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), Retail Opportunity Investments Corp (ROIC), Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc (HII), Berkshire (BRK.A) (BRK.B), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC), National Beverage Corp (FIZZ), Mariott (MAR), Facebook (FB), Lamar Advertising Company (LAMR), Disney (DIS), Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacífico (PAC) and Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings (CCO).</p>
<p>I hope you like the interview. It left me with a lot to reflect on and to process. Please share or like the video/article as that&rsquo;s a strong signal for me to do more of these.</p>

<h3 id="voting-reform-advocates-pounce-on-georgia-debacle-to-urge-changes">&ldquo;Voting reform advocates pounce on Georgia debacle to urge changes&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/coronavirus_voting_ga_060920getty_mail-in.jpg" alt="img">
Voting reform advocates are warning the chaos seen during Georgia&rsquo;s primary elections on Tuesday portends widespread problems in November if federal measures are not taken to expand mail-in voting and address other election challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s elections in Georgia saw voters in some areas of Atlanta waiting hours to cast their vote due to a combination of malfunctioning voting equipment, the consolidation of in-person polling places due to the COVID-19 crisis and confusion over voting absentee.</p>
<p>The voting precincts hit hardest were those with heavily minority populations, reinforcing concern about voter disenfranchisement as protests continued across the country over the police killing of George Floyd.</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>Nse Ufot, the executive director of the voting rights group New Georgia Project, told reporters Wednesday that she was “equal parts determined and pissed off,” describing the election confusion as “completely avoidable.”</p>
<p>“We witnessed a direct attack on our democracy and a trial run of what we are going to see,” Ufot said. “We saw people frustrated who literally quit on the spot, we saw polling locations close before voting was done and open late, hours late &hellip; we need to make sure things are fixed on the march to November.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms (D) voiced her own frustrations late Tuesday night.</p>
<p>“Let’s all work, hope and pray that this is not a preview of November,” she tweeted.</p>
<p>Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) announced Tuesday that he was launching an investigation to understand what steps Georgia counties need to take to ensure November elections can move forward smoothly.</p>
<p>Georgia’s statewide voting implementation manager, Gabriel Sterling, directed blame at county election officials for the chaos at the polls, saying in a statement on Tuesday that the “breakdown occurred at the county level.”</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>“The other 157 counties faced the same difficulties of using a new system and voting during a pandemic, but they seem to have handled the issues that arose diligently and efficiently,” Sterling said.</p>
<p>But county officials and some reform advocates have cast their blame on Georgia elections officials for not adequately preparing the state for the voting changes implemented on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Complicating issues in Georgia was the rollout of new in-person voting systems and the expansion of mail-in ballots. The state sent out absentee ballot request forms to voters to try to stem the spread of COVID-19 at the polls, with voters then required to request a ballot, lengthening the voting process.</p>
<p>For those who had trouble voting absentee or who wished to vote in-person, Tuesday also marked the first major elections that involved the use of new voting equipment purchased by the state from Dominion Voting Systems.</p>
<p>The equipment was purchased by Raffensperger as part of a multimillion dollar deal following a 2019 federal ruling that required Georgia to fade out less secure paperless machines by 2020.</p>
<p>Kay Stimson, the vice president of government affairs at Dominion, told The Hill that company teams had replaced 20 voting systems components by Tuesday night and said the company’s service call volume “slowed significantly after midday.”</p>
<p>Stimson pointed to concerns around training poll workers on how to use the equipment as being a major issue that led to concerns with the machines.</p>
<p>“Some precincts clearly experienced training-related issues early in the day and needed additional help with setting up equipment, checking in voters and activating voter cards,” Stimson said. “We plan to provide detailed call center data to the state to help identify areas of improvement from both a training and a technical support standpoint, and we will continue to work with all partners to provide assistance to county election offices.”</p>
<p>Duncan Buell, a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of South Carolina, told The Hill on Wednesday that he was “not that surprised” by the chaos at the polls.</p>
<p>“When you make a total change like this, it can be really hard the first time,” Buell said of the new machines. “Elections are going to be chaotic events, and there should be an argument that you keep things as simple as possible.”</p>
<p>The confusion at the polls in Georgia, coming months after problems during primary elections in Wisconsin, strengthened ongoing calls from Democrats on Capitol Hill to send states more resources to boost mail-in voting and address other election challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“We need to make sure states have the resources they need to give Americans options to make their voices heard at the ballot box — simple solutions like voting by mail and expanding access to the polls through early voting so people don’t face long lines,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar Amy KlobucharPolice unions face lobbying fights at all levels of government Biden advisers starting to gather documents from potential VP picks: report Hillicon Valley: Zuckerberg expresses &lsquo;disgust,&rsquo; keeps policies | New doomsday cyber bills | QAnon follower favored for congressional seat MORE (D-Minn.) said in a statement.</p>
<p>The former Democratic presidential candidate added that “when we don’t properly fund our elections and develop plans to protect voters, Americans — often in communities of color — get disenfranchised and that’s what happened today in Georgia.”</p>
<p>Congress appropriated $400 million to states to address coronavirus-related election challenges as part of the $2 trillion stimulus package signed into law in March. The new House-passed stimulus bill includes $3.6 billion more for elections, but is stalled in the Senate.</p>
<p>“We need more poll workers, we need that funding to help modernize and make our elections more efficient, we also need more funding to make sure we have more paper ballots at precincts,” Aunna Dennis, the executive director of nonpartisan advocacy group Common Cause Georgia, told reporters Wednesday. “We need the Senate to stop sitting on it and give it out to states that are really in desperate need of funding to modernize our elections.”</p>
<p>Rep. Zoe Lofgren Zoe Ellen LofgrenDemocrats see path to ridding Capitol of Confederate statues Black lawmakers unveil bill to remove Confederate statues from Capitol McConnell: States should make decision on Confederate statues MORE (D-Calif.), the chairwoman of the elections-focused House Administration Committee, told The Hill that the Georgia primary elections made it “clear, once again, that state and local election officials simply do not have the resources necessary to carry out safe and orderly elections in the midst of the deadly pandemic.”</p>
<p>While Republicans have been largely opposed to election changes during the pandemic, in particular to expanding mail-in voting, Rep. Rodney Davis Rodney Lee DavisEurasia Group founder Ian Bremmer says Trump right on China but wrong on WHO; CDC issues new guidance for large gatherings Voting reform advocates pounce on Georgia debacle to urge changes The Hill&rsquo;s 12:30 Report: Trump visits a ventilator plant in a battleground state MORE (R-Ill.), the ranking member of the House Administration Committee, urged states to “be realistic and plan accordingly” following issues during other state primaries last week.</p>
<p>New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice has led the charge in warning of threats to elections in 2020, with experts estimating that states would need at least $4 billion to put on elections.</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>Liz Howard, counsel at the Brennan Center and a former deputy commissioner of the Virginia Department of Elections, told The Hill that “simple backup plans” like having paper ballots at polling sites could help stem the threat of voter disenfranchisement in Georgia and other states.</p>
<p>“The big takeaway is that election officials across the country are in dire need of additional financial support from the federal government as many struggle to transform how they administer elections, educate voters and recruit, train and retrain poll workers,” Howard said.</p>
<p>Buell pointed to Georgia as a warning for other election officials.</p>
<p>“Everybody ought to sit up and start making long lists of things that will go wrong and how they are going to react to mitigate the damage when things go wrong,” Buell said.

<h3 id="on-leadership-dance-studio-owner-pushes-confidence">&ldquo;On Leadership: Dance studio owner pushes confidence&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://d31029zd06w0t6.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/06/web1_Mulcahy-Lyn-submitted.jpg" alt="img">
In each “On Leadership” column, Allen Lima Leadership Executive Director Matt Childers talks with a regional business leader. This week, he profiles Lyn Mulcahy, Owner of Lyn’s Academy of Dance.</p>
<p>Matt: You grew up in the Lima/Shawnee area. How were your early years?</p>
<p>Lyn: I was probably the typical high school kid. I went to Shawnee High School and participated in a lot of school activities. It was a great era to grow up in because I could do cheerleading, run cross country and track and do a lot of different things, including dance where I own the studio today.</p>
<p>Matt: Tell me about the influences of your parents, John and Marilyn Fisher.</p>
<p>Lyn: Well, my dad was a salesman. I saw him working very hard, traveling and pushing his cheese (Fisher Cheese) for many years. My mom really ran the household. Monday through Friday she ran five kids to five different places, schedules, events, dinners, laundry, she got it done! I am probably more like her. They were very good influences on me for sure.</p>
<p>Matt: Did you know dance education was where you would end up professionally?</p>
<p>Lyn: I always knew I liked dance. I knew physical education and working with kids would be a focus. When I went to BGSU, I started taking dance classes right off the bat my freshman year, and I was also on an education track. So, I just merged those two areas and fell into the dance education program. It was great!</p>
<p>Matt: How would you describe BGSU’s dance education program?</p>
<p>Lyn: At the time I went, it was a very strong program. We had the dance program, but it was tied into the school of Health, Human Movement &amp; Education. So, we received a strong background not only in dance, but in all the core education classes. Unfortunately, now it is only a minor program.</p>
<p>Matt: Did all paths lead back to Lima and having your own studio?</p>
<p>Lyn: My senior year, some of my fellow classmates and I thought about working on cruise ships, looking at master’s opportunities and looking at other opportunities. I just happened to be home the last part of my spring break the last year of college and received a call from the then-owner of my now-current studio. Barbara Ann Lloyd gave me a call and shared an opportunity with me. She was planning on relocating to the Myrtle Beach area with her family and retire. She made it very easy. Rent the building, give it a try, see what you think, and I very blindly said, “OK, I will try it.” (laughter) And 26 years later, I am still trying it!</p>
<p>Matt: How is leading young women different today than when you first embarked on this journey?</p>
<p>Lyn: The kids are the same. Mostly I have girls and a few boys, but mainly girls. The technology is the biggest change over the years that I see, the technology that the kids use to communicate.</p>
<p>Matt: Has the dance education changed? What types of dance do you offer at Lyn’s Academy of Dance?</p>
<p>Lyn: We really offer everything. From tap classes, jazz, hip-hop, clogging, point and tumbling. I am really lucky, as I have four instructors that have their own specialty and different area of expertise. We can capitalize on those professionals.</p>
<p>Matt: As the leader, how do you hire your team?</p>
<p>Lyn: I have been really lucky, as all but one instructor have been a former student of mine. I look for their background in dance, education and experience. They are all very qualified. I share that with my current students, the great credentials their instructors have.</p>
<p>Matt: What’s your best advice for young ladies?</p>
<p>Lyn: Pursue something you enjoy doing. Don’t do anything someone else wants you to do. Do what you want to do in life. If you find something that you love to do, I believe you can find a career to make it work!</p>
<p>Matt: You have had some powerful success stories come out of your studio. Can you share?</p>
<p>Lyn: Angela Kahle had a great career with Radio City Rockettes. Lena Lauer lives in New York and has had a very active dance career. She has had a couple of major jobs. She recently was coordinating with The Joffrey Ballet Modern Dance Program. We have had former students tour with Up with People. A current instructor, Liz Howard, is in her final stretch of getting her master’s in fine arts degree from St. Mary’s College in California. She is also the director of dance at Ohio Northern University. We have had so many. I get to live through them!</p>
<p>Matt: What is the most important piece of leading young women?</p>
<p>Lyn: I always tell my instructors, “We are here to teach them dance, give them the best education for dance, but really, we want to teach them to be strong women!” We have some girls who start in preschool and stay with us through high school. It’s great to see them grow and gain courage and confidence. I have been lucky to have some professional dancers come through the studio, but I really want all of these young girls to have confidence, not only in dance and on stage, but in life. Confidence! Have lots of fun, but most importantly have confidence.</p>

<p>Cinderella&rsquo;s Castle at the Magic Kingdom, Disney World in Orlando, Florida, Photo Date: 10/5/2009 / Photo: Michael Gray / CC BY-SA 2.0 via MGN</p>

<p>The stories will highlight people in our own community, country or around the world.</p>
<p>Here are the stories highlighted on June 12:</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s Choice:</p>
<p>For all of you Disney lovers &ndash; Walt Disney World will reopen next month for the first time since it closed because of coronavirus.</p>
<p>There will be some changes though. No parades, fireworks shows or &ldquo;meet-and-greet&rdquo; sessions with performers dressed as Disney characters. Disney employees won&rsquo;t even be allowed to take photos of visitors using the guests&rsquo; cellphones to cut back on the risk of spreading the virus.</p>
<p>Disney has not made any plans to reopen Disney World&rsquo;s water parks, and those workers can transfer temporarily into other areas. They aren’t having international employees come back just yet.</p>
<p>Thousands of Disney World workers will be recalled for work starting in mid-June, ahead of the resort&rsquo;s opening next month.</p>
<p>Jim has been to Disney World at least six times because he lived nearby in Florida.</p>
<p>Liz&rsquo;s Choice:</p>
<p>From Disney World to Disney princesses! Liz&rsquo;s sister, Caroline, is a fifth grade teacher. Like so many, she transitioned to online learning in March.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s found creative ways to keep in touch with her students, including rewriting the song &ldquo;Some Things Never Change&rdquo; from Frozen 2 and performing it for her students.</p>
<p>Watch the video above to listen!</p>
<p>Austin&rsquo;s Choice:</p>
<p>Austin shared some exciting news about the newest addition to Jim&rsquo;s family, Donkey!</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve heard about and seen photos of Donkey, who Jim has been fostering. On Thursday, he made it official and adopted Donkey.</p>
<p>Austin says he &ldquo;loves how happy Jim has been since he became a cat dad to Donkey,&rdquo; and took the time to congratulate both Jim and Donkey!</p>
<p>Watch the video above to see cute photos of Donkey!</p>

“I know we’ll hear from those disappointed that their particular project might not proceed exactly as planned just six months ago. I get it,” Walsh said. “I know some of them will predictably frame these amendments as ‘against’ whatever their particular, singular issue is. It’s not. It’s bigger than that. We’re trying to do what’s right, for right now, for everybody.”
