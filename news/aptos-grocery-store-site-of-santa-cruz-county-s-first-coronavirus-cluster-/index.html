APTOS — Temporarily, the recently opened Aptos Village Way branch of New Leaf Community Markets has been voluntarily shuttered due to a “cluster” of confirmed COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>The local grocery chain first posted a statement about an employee infection to its website Saturday, saying that it was working to ensure the safety of both its employees and customers. Other New Leaf branches remain open.</p>
<p>“We were able to quickly identify any Aptos staff who may have been in prolonged close contact with affected individuals and have required them to stay home, monitor for symptoms, and remain in regular contact with their healthcare providers and the local public health department,” a later-updated version of the statement read, in part.</p>
<p>County Health Officer Gail Newel said during a press conference Thursday that the handful of confirmed New Leaf coronavirus cases — all from one location — is Santa Cruz County’s first COVID-19 cluster — though she stopped short of classifying the centralized grouping as an “outbreak.” Newel declined to disclose how many employees had been diagnosed with the coronavirus, but a New Leaf representative wrote in an email to the Sentinel that seven employees at the store had been confirmed as having COVID-19.</p>
<p>Newel said that she had not recommended that the store, falling under the county shelter-in-place order’s “essential services” exemption, remain closed.</p>
<p>“The usual grocery shopping practices are very low-risk for being exposed to COVID-19,” Newell said of risk to exposed members of the public. “In general, a person would need to be within 6 feet of an unmasked person, or a person without a face covering, for several minutes or even longer in order to be any significant risk of getting COVID-19. So, it would be unusual for a shopper to be that close to an employee for that long of a period of time for any increased risk.”</p>
<p>Newel said there was every indication that New Leaf had been following COVID-19 best practices prior to the infections and had been proactive in working with county officials since. The company’s original plan to close for 14 days was modified to just several days for a deep disinfecting of the site, Newel said.

<p>In its online release, New Leaf said that it “strongly encourages” staff to stay home when sick, even offering supplemental paid time off during an illness. For remaining workers, the company has been conducting symptoms checks at the start of every shift and supplying cloth face coverings, while paying employees a biweekly bonus and providing expanded free mental health resources and a 30% staff discount.</p>
<p>Separately, Newel said Thursday, the county recorded the diagnosis of four coronavirus infections in people who had taken part in a fundraiser for first responders. The patients were not first responders themselves, Newel said.

<h3 id="patient-triggers-new-cluster-in-pengerang-after-visiting-relatives-colleagues-a-day-before-mco">Patient triggers new cluster in Pengerang after visiting relatives, colleagues a day before MCO</h3>
<p><img src="https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/04/22/653513.jpg" alt="img">
PUTRAJAYA: A new cluster of Covid-19 patients has emerged in Pengerang, Johor, after a patient, who was initially suspected to have dengue, travelled across a few states visiting relatives, says Health Ministry director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah.</p>
<p>The patient, who is Malaysia&rsquo;s 1,508th case, initially suffered from symptoms on March 12 and was treated at a private clinic on March 16.</p>
<p>He was suspected of suffering dengue fever at the time.</p>
<p>The following day, on March 17, the said patient travelled across several states, including Selangor, visiting relatives, before returning to Pengerang on March 18, the first day the movement control order (MCO) was enforced.</p>
<p>“The patient’s health condition deteriorated and was warded to Hospital Sultanah Aminah, Johor, on March 20 in a critical condition.</p>
<p>“The patient subsequently tested positive for Covid-19 on March 22, ” said Dr Noor Hisham during his daily Covid-19 briefing at the Health Ministry in Putrajaya Wednesday (April 22).</p>
<p>According to Dr Noor Hisham, the new cluster involved 15 positive cases, consisting of 10 colleagues and five family members, including the patient’s 79-year-old mother and a ten-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>“Seven cases under this cluster are currently receiving treatment, while eight more cases have fully recovered and been discharged.</p>
<p>“In total, three cases in this cluster are being treated at the intensive care unit (ICU).”</p>
<p>The infection involving the patient’s family members was believed to be caused by visits made by the patient a day before the MCO was enforced, said Dr Noor Hisham.</p>
<p>Dr Noor Hisham said the Pengerang cluster and the Rembau sub-cluster should be made as an example of the importance of adhering to the MCO and avoiding visits.</p>
<p>“This includes travelling across states, districts, sub-districts, or attending large gatherings, including religious ceremonies and receptions.</p>
<p>“The Health Ministry is concerned that such activities, which are normal for Malaysians, would cause the spread of Covid-19 among family members, particularly senior citizens and children.”</p>
<p>He urged Muslims in the country to use the fasting month as a time to conduct their religious practices and activities in their respective houses.</p>
<p>“Aside from celebrating Ramadan with your family members at home, this will help us to care and protect our family members, particularly the old and young from being infected with Covid-19.</p>
<p>“The public are also advised to always practice social distancing of at least one meter from others and to maintain good personal hygiene, ” he said.
