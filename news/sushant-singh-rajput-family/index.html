<p>Actor Sushant Singh Rajput was planning to get married in November this year, according to the late actor&rsquo;s cousin.</p>
<p>The cousin revealed that the actor was to get married soon, while talking to the news channel IndiaTV.</p>
<p>Without revealing name of the girl, he said that the family was gearing up for the wedding. They even planned to visit to Mumbai soon for preparations.</p>
<p>The cousin said that it was going to be a private wedding in Mumbai with few family members and friends.</p>
<p>Unconfirmed rumours have stated that Sushant was dating actress Rhea Chakraborty, though many insist the two stars were just good friends.</p>
<p>Actress Ankita Lokhande and Sushant Singh Rajput dated each other for a few years. The actor had worked with Sushant in Zee TV’s show Pavitra Rishta.</p>
<p>Sushant was said to be in a relationship with Ankita in the early years of his career</p>
<p>Sushant was found hanging in his Bandra residence on Sunday morning by his domestic help. He was reportedly battling depression over the past few months and undergoing treatment for the same. His social media posts from the past couple of months reveal that he even tried yoga and meditation to battle his state of mind.</p>
<p>The actor hailed from Bihar and was educated in Patna and New Delhi, before shifting to Mumbai.</p>
<p>After establishing himself on the small screen with &ldquo;Pavitra Rishta&rdquo;, he transitioned to the big screen with film &ldquo;Kai Po Chhe&rdquo;. He went on to do projects including &ldquo;Shuddh Desi Romance&rdquo;, the biopic &ldquo;M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story&rdquo;, &ldquo;Kedarnath&rdquo; and &ldquo;Chhichore&rdquo;, among several others.

<p><img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-01/f747m5no_sushant-singh-rajput_625x300_15_January_19.jpg" alt="img">
Actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his Mumbai home.</p>
<p>Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his home in Mumbai, police said today, confirming his suicide. He was 34.</p>
<p>The popular actor was recently seen in the film &ldquo;Chhichhore&rdquo; - which dealt with the extreme pressure of college and competitive exams. His last appearance was in the Netflix film &ldquo;Drive&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput had put up a moving post just last week when his former manager Disha Salian was found dead. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s such devastating news,&rdquo; the actor had written on Instagram.</p>
<p>His last post on Instagram was dedicated to his mother, whose death in 2002 left him devastated. &ldquo;Blurred past evaporating from teardrops, unending dreams carving an arc of smile And a fleeting life, negotiating between the two,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>Rajput, who became a household name with his hit television series &ldquo;Pavitra Rishta&rdquo;, debuted in films in 2013 with the critically acclaimed &ldquo;Kai Po Che!&rdquo; based on Chetan Bhagat&rsquo;s bestselling book &ldquo;The Three Mistakes of My Life&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The movie catapulted Rajput into the big league and he went on to do several films. He also played MS Dhoni in the former skipper&rsquo;s biopic, for which he was nominated for film awards.</p>
<p>He played the eponymous role of Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! in the 2015 thriller. He had a supporting role in Aamir Khan&rsquo;s 2014 hit PK. In 2018, Rajput starred in Kedarnath opposite debutante Sara Ali Khan.</p>
<p>Rajput was born in Patna. He studied engineering and was a National Olympiad Winner in Physics.</p>
<p>He said in interviews that after his involvement in theatre and dance, he rarely had time for studies. He eventually dropped out of engineering just a year short of his degree to pursue an acting career.</p>
<p>A shell-shocked film industry posted tributes on Twitter. &ldquo;Honestly this news has left me shocked and speechless&hellip;I remember watching #SushantSinghRajput in Chhichhore and telling my friend Sajid, its producer how much I&rsquo;d enjoyed the film and wish I&rsquo;d been a part of it. Such a talented actor&hellip;may God give strength to his family,&rdquo; Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No No No!!!!! Horrible heartbreaking news of the passing of #SushantSinghRajput ! Shocking &amp; sad beyond words!!! Goodbye Sushant.. you were such a wonderful performer and had such a long long way to go! Don&rsquo;t know what you were going through but I&rsquo;m sorry for your suffering! Red heart (sic),&rdquo; Swara Bhaskar posted, condoling his death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The news of Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s death is truly sad. What a tragic loss Deepest condolences to his family &amp; loved ones. May his soul find eternal peace,&rdquo; actor Ajay Devgn wrote.</p>
<p>Abhishek Bachchan tweeted: &ldquo;This is just so shocking. A wonderful talent. RIP Sushant&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Last month, death of seasoned actors - Rishi Kapoor and Irrfan Khan - left the country in grief and shock.</p>

Sushant Singh Rajput Death News: सामने आई लव अफेयर की भी बात, स्‍वजन बोले- वह सुसाइड नहीं कर सकता</p>
<p>पटना, जेएनएन। Sushant Singh Rajput Death News: बॉलीवुड अभिनेता सुशांत सिंह राजपूत (Sushant Singh Rajput) केे सुसाइड (Suicide) मामले में तरह-तरह की चर्चाओं के बीच एक चर्चा लव अफेयर (Love Affair) की भी हो रही है। सुशांत के पटना स्थित घर के पास रहने वाले अमरनाथ सिंह ने बताया कि सुशांत के पिता बेटे के किसी लड़की से अफेयर की बात कह रहे थे। वे मार्च में मुंबई (Mumbai) जाना चाहते थे, लेकिन लॉकडाउन (Lockdown) के कारण पिता पटना में ही रह गए और हादसा हो गया। इस बीच स्‍वजनों ने इसे सुसाइड मानने से भी इनकार किया है। उन्‍होंने इसे हत्‍या बताते हुए सीबीआइ जांच (CBI Probe) की मांग की है।</p>
<p>पड़ोसी बोले: पिता करते थे लव अफेयर की चर्चा</p>
<p>सुशांत के पटना के पड़ोसी अमरनाथ सिंह ने कहा कि सुशांत के पिता केके सिंह अकसर कहते थे कि बेटे का किसी बंगाली लड़की से लव अफेयर है। वे वहां जाकर मामला देखने की बात कहते थे। वे मार्च में ही मुंबई जाने वाले थे, मगर लॉकडाउन के कारण नहीं जा सके। इसके बाद यह हादसा हो गया।</p>
<p>खुदकुशी मानने को तैयार नहीं सुशांत के स्‍वजन</p>
<p>सुशांत सिंह राजपूत की खुदकुशी करने की बात परिजन मानने को तैयार नहीं है। अभिनेता के मामा आरसी सिंह ने कहा कि सुशांत काफी मजबूत लड़का था। उसकी हत्या हुई है। इसकी सीबीआइ से जांच होनी चाहिए। उन्होंने अंदेशा जताया कि कुछ दिन पहले सुशांत की मैनेजर ने सुसाइड किया था। हो सकता है, पुलिस या किसी और का उसपर दबाव हो। अब यह सब बातें तो जांच के बाद ही पता चलेगी।</p>
<p>बहन बोली: उन्‍होंने कभी नहीं की परेशानी की चर्चा</p>
<p>सुशांत की ममेरी बहन भव्या ने बताया कि उन्होंने कभी बातचीत में किसी परेशानी का जिक्र नहीं किया। ऐसे में विश्वास करना मुश्किल है कि भइया ने आत्महत्या की है।</p>
<p>दिनभर घर में लगा रहा नेताओं का तांता</p>
<p>सुशांत की मौत की खबर के बाद राजीवनगर स्थित उनके घर के बाहर लोगों का तांता लगा रहा। पूर्व सांसद लवली आनंद, पप्पू यादव और दीघा विधायक संजीव चौरसिया ने भी घर जाकर स्वजनों को सांत्वना दी। पूर्व सांसद पप्‍पू यादव ने भी घटना की सीबीआइ जांच की मांग रखी है।</p>
