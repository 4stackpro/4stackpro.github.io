<p>Obamacare Markets Will Not Reopen, Trump Decides https://t.co/E9GB2kLVe0 — bettemidler (@BetteMidler) April 1, 2020</p>
<p>The post, which was retweeted over 5,000 times, came in response to a New York Times article with the headline “Obamacare Markets Will Not Reopen, Trump Decides,” suggesting that Trump has made it more difficult for workers recently laid off due to the coronavirus to get health insurance.</p>
<p>The article does say in the fourth paragraph, however, that Trump’s decision “will not prevent Americans who recently lost their jobs from obtaining health insurance if they want it.”

<h3 id="the-time-former-president-barack-obamas-joakim-noah-takes-sparked-a-story">The time former President Barack Obama&rsquo;s Joakim Noah takes sparked a story</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/sites/csnchicago/files/2020/04/01/obama.jpg" alt="img">
Former U.S. President Barack Obama’s devout basketball and Bulls fandom is well-documented.</p>
<p>But according to former Obama communications director Dan Pfeiffer on the most recent episode of “The Crossover NBA Show with Chris Mannix,” there came a point in Obama’s time as the leader of the free world when he had to consciously reign in his inner blog boy.</p>
<p>It began with the Bulls’ drafting of Joakim Noah.</p>
<p>“Obama learned over the years that, being president and being a fan, you can’t be a normal fan when you’re president,” Pfeiffer told Mannix. “When he was running for president, we were in New Hampshire doing an interview with a local reporter a day or so after. This must have been the ’07 draft. And the reporter at the end just asked Obama, as a fan, what did he think of the Bulls pick, and that was the year the Bulls picked Noah.</p>
<p>“And Obama, as a fan, like a lot of, if I remember, Bulls fans at the time, thought it wasn’t a great pick because it was duplicative of Tyrus Thomas, who they’d taken the year before. And Obama said that, and it made a lot of news both in Chicago and in sports… So he realized that you can’t just pontificate on draft picks without some consequences when you’re president of the United States.”</p>
<p>Worse, Noah was an ardent Obama supporter. Also according to Pfeiffer, the eventual Bulls center spent part of his time at the University of Florida as a member of a grassroots, Obama-supportive student organization. Obama&rsquo;s comments didn&rsquo;t change that sentiment: In an interview with Le Journal du Dimanche in Feb. 2008, Noah endorsed Obama in the 2008 election and said he&rsquo;d been a supporter since 2004.</p>
<p>But it’s hard to blame the ex-President too much for that take, ice cold as it ended up becoming. The Noah pick was widely polarizing at the time (and even through his rookie season), and Thomas wasn’t yet considered an unequivocal bust. Plus, Obama did eventually renege on those comments, even inviting Noah to his 49th birthday party at the White House in 2010, which saw stars across the NBA spectrum assemble for a pickup game.</p>
<p>That day spawned an anecdote that will go down as an all-timer, even for a player as celebrated as Noah. From former Obama senior advisor David Axelrod in GQ’s “The Oral History of President Barack Obama Playing Pickup Basketball”:</p>
<p>“[The President] ticked off Joakim Noah because the president was trash-talking him about his shot, [which is], shall we say, unorthodox. The president said, ‘Where’d you get that shot? That’s the ugliest shot I’ve ever seen.’ So at some point, Noah decided, ‘Okay, let’s see about yours.’ And he completely smothered the President. I mean he was guarding him and the President could not go anywhere. But I will say that with all of that, somehow playing against all these NBA players, he (Obama) mysteriously was able to hit the winning shot.”</p>
<p>Surely, the Obama-Noah relationship is all love now. But the evolution of it has certainly been a riot.</p>

<h3 id="obama-demands-better-of-our-government-after-trump-rolls-back-climate-measure">Obama demands ‘better of our government’ after Trump rolls back climate measure</h3>
<p><img src="https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/obama-trump.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200" alt="img">
Former President Barack Obama took to Twitter to insist that “all of us, especially young people,” demand better of the government, following the Trump administration’s decision to roll back its predecessor’s fuel standards.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen all too terribly the consequences of those who denied warnings of a pandemic. We can’t afford any more consequences of climate denial,” Obama wrote in a Tuesday post on the social media platform.</p>
<p>“All of us, especially young people, have to demand better of our government at every level and vote this fall,” he continued.</p>
<p>The tweet came with a link to a Los Angeles Times article announcing the slashing of the Obama-era fuel standards, which were implemented in an effort to combat climate change.</p>
<p>The new rule, according to the Times, comes from both the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation and would allow automakers to ignore ambitious gas mileage and emissions requirements put in place by the Obama administration in 2012.</p>
<p>Before, automakers were required to produce fleets that would average 55 miles per gallon by 2025. The new Trump-era rule will bring that number down to 40 miles per gallon by 2026.</p>
<p>President Trump’s likely 2020 challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden, has vowed during the campaign to toughen fuel economy standards in order to ensure “100% of new sales for light- and medium-duty vehicles will be electrified.”</p>
