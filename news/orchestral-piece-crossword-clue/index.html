<p>This post contains signposts for those who prefer their crosswords to relieve rather than relive the recent events of the pandemic</p>
<p>In the sample clues below, the links take you to little explainers from our For Beginners series.</p>
<p>The news in clues</p>
<p>Let’s call it: the crossword is no longer a guaranteed sanctuary from the rest of the paper. Some solvers will regret this; readers Shenguin and Dimsworthy forcefully put the case for crossword-as-haven in the conversation at a previous post. If you prefer puzzles to avoid mentioning what’s happening – and you’ve plenty of justification – please skip to the next subhead.</p>
<p>The reason is that the words some setters avoided at the start of what we’re calling “This” …</p>
<p>20ac Mother’s in meeting ad infinitum, feeling fine (12)</p>
<p>[ wordplay: synonym for ‘mother’ contained by (‘in’), and there’s no way to say this, mathematical term used when approaching infinity ]</p>
<p>[ MA in ASYMPTOTIC ]</p>
<p>[ definition: feeling fine ]</p>
<p>… such as ASYMPTOMATIC, are back. The setter here, Philistine, is a surgeon, who kicks off the same puzzle with a curt direction …</p>
<p>1ac Please spread out (6)</p>
<p>[ wordplay: anagram (‘spread’) of PLEASE ]</p>
<p>[ definition: out ]</p>
<p>… as a clue for ASLEEP. And in the Independent on Sunday, Hoskins could not be more timely …</p>
<p>20d Depressing high toll overwhelms hospital department (7)</p>
<p>[ wordplay: synonym for a high-pitched bell sound (‘high toll’) surrounding abbrev. for Ear, Nose &amp; Throat (‘hospital department’) ]</p>
<p>[ DING surrounding ENT ]</p>
<p>[ definition: depressing ]</p>
<p>… in the surface reading of a horrendously This clue for DENTING.</p>
<p>Latter patter</p>
<p>Here’s a clue by Pan from the quiptic, the Guardian’s stepping-stone puzzle “for beginners and those in a hurry”.</p>
<p>27ac Managed to get gold box valued (12)</p>
<p>[ wordplay: heraldic term for ‘gold’ + synonyms for ‘box’ &amp; ‘valued’ ]</p>
<p>[ OR + CHEST + RATED ]</p>
<p>[ definition: managed ]</p>
<p>And so it’s ORCHESTRATED, a word that owes its origin, via the spot where the chorus used to dance, to the Greek ὀρχεῖσθαι. To dance. My feelings about Ezra Pound are almost entirely to do with his choice of sides in the early 1940s, but I think often of his thought that goes like this:</p>
<p>Music begins to atrophy when it departs too far from the dance; that poetry begins to atrophy when it gets too far from music</p>
<p>Pound aside, I’m thrilled to think of dancing as etymologically baked into the orchestra, whatever it might play. I imagine dancing’s being there too in a term that is doubtless evolving as we speak. I’m prepared to accept that perhaps no one was maintaining logs of its earlier use as hips swayed in Harlem nightspots, but reader: how would you clue HIPSTER?</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you can put aside the poignancy of his having to pluck alone in the Wigmore Hall, last week’s recital by Scottish guitarist Sean Shibe (reviewed here by the Guardian) is wonderful while solving and better still while only listening.</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest Sean Shibe</p>
<p>Cluing competition</p>
<p>Thanks for your clues for IMPACT. A bumper harvest once again and Dimsworthy thoughtfully remarks: “I genuinely wonder how Alan deals with them all.” Equally genuinely, the only annoyance is choosing what to exclude to get a readable digest. (And regarding jargon – as the word “impact” has become in part – this recommendation of Jonathan Meades is seconded.)</p>
<p>Etymon gets the audacity award for “What paintballs explode on”, though that wouldn’t be so audacious in an American puzzle, where every square is part of an across and a down answer.</p>
<p>Now is the moment where we reiterate the advice at the top; this time, if you want some respite from This, skip to the penultimate paragraph of this section. This is because many of the clues were, in the words of Harlobarlo, “not about This, but about That”. In fact, we’ve never once had so many clues evoke the same incident in their surface.</p>
<p>So, recounting what will surely never be forgiven, we have among plenty of others: Lizard’s “Dom C. is apt to be portrayed as devious sod with such influence”, PeterMooreFuller’s “Starts to investigate Machiavellian political advisor caught travelling? There will be consequences!”, Harlobarlo’s “Consequence of emphatic spinning? Sadly, he’s rejected”, Mojoseeker’s “On the road back from Durham, bargain for influence”, Faiton77’s “Press together? One understanding this holds the end of Dom” and Porcia’s “Current prime minister lying about episode’s significance”. Thanks to all and to others – and so much for populism.</p>
<p>The runners-up are Catarella’s plausible “Effect of tight cap – migraine returning” and Dunnart’s semi-cheering “POW camp liberated in Italy”; the winner is Porcia’s deft “‘The name’s Bond &hellip;’ makes an impression”.</p>
<p>Kludos to Porcia. Please leave entries for this fortnight’s competition – and your picks from the broadsheet cryptics – below.</p>
<p>Clue of the fortnight</p>
<p>Your suggestions are welcome on how to parse this, from Dean Mayer in the Sunday Times …</p>
<p>17d How to pronounce the ‘h’ of ‘aaargh’? (8)</p>
<p>… but as a clue for ASPIRATE, it shivers my timbers.

<h3 id="crossword-roundup-topical-allusions-sneaking-back-in">&ldquo;Crossword roundup: topical allusions sneaking back in&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/557c811d51f97e3b01448b0523395e7321dc676b/120_275_1040_624/master/1040.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=fd127a214257323d12e7acef5c36d89f" alt="img">
The current situation starts to appear in our pick of the best of the broadsheets’ cryptic clues</p>
<p>In the sample clues below, the links take you to little explainers from our For Beginners series.</p>
<p>The news in clues</p>
<p>The crossword is a happy place. Late in March, the general tenor of the daily puzzles largely and understandably became a lot less topical. What comfort is a crossword if it reminds you of the thing you’re seeking an hour’s respite from (henceforth referred to as “This”)?</p>
<p>And so it went for a while. More recently, the odd acknowledgment of This has been appearing, and not in an unpleasant way. Well, I say that. In the Independent, Skinny’s vision of the world to come is … ominous.</p>
<p>14ac Flesh-eating virus racoon develops (11)</p>
<p>[ wordplay: anagram (‘develops’) of VIRUSRACOON ]</p>
<p>[ definition: flesh-eating ]</p>
<p>Given that the answer, CARNIVOROUS, lends itself to another anagram, perhaps we should regard Skinny’s fatal procyonids as a whimsical fantasy? A more world-weary hat-tip to life in 2020 can be seen in Paul’s clue …</p>
<p>27ac Stupefied, practising social distancing? (6,3)</p>
<p>[ double definition ]</p>
<p>… for SPACED OUT. If you see more allusions to This in puzzles – or if you’d rather see none – let me know below.</p>
<p>Latter patter</p>
<p>The above, by the way, is no criticism of Skinny. Not only does the flesh-eating clue remind us that the answer to the careful writer’s question “Now, how many ‘c’s are there in ‘rac(c)oon’?” is “It depends how you’re transliterating the Algonquian ‘aroughcun’” (the Guardian implicitly defers to Collins’ double-C); elsewhere, Skinny also clues one of those words that’s worth having a think about.</p>
<p>Here’s the clue:</p>
<p>11ac Celebrated ensemble enveloped in smoke that’s excessive (7)</p>
<p>[ wordplay: abbrev. for London Symphony Orchestra (‘celebrated ensemble’) inside (‘enveloped in’) synonym for ‘smoke’ (often as a verb) ]</p>
<p>[ LSO inside FUME ]</p>
<p>[ definition: excessive ]</p>
<p>So it’s FULSOME. Almost the last thing I remember before This was reading, in a botanical garden the day before it was closed, an essay offering pithy advice on how to deal with the fact that some people use “fulsome” to mean “pleasingly plentiful” and others use it to mean “unpleasingly plentiful”.</p>
<p>The phone I used to read it can’t tell me where that essay is; if any of the various corporations which have logged my enjoyment of the piece would care to share its location, I’ll pass it on. My two penn’orth is that the word, having become ambiguous, is one I’ll try to remember to forget. I’m happy with using words such as “profuse” for one sense and “effusive” for another, so this is not a case of losing a unique and useful piece of language – it’s not like “curate’s egg”.</p>
<p>Which brings us to a question. Is there anyone here who (a) doesn’t tend to leap up and down insisting that language mustn’t change but also (b) has some word or phrase they really wish would not change form or meaning? I’ll start with the subject of our next challenge. It’s not that I think it shouldn’t be a verb; it’s more that I tend to stop listening when I hear it used as one. Reader, how would you clue IMPACT?</p>
<p>Cluing competition</p>
<p>Thanks for your clues for QUIDDITY. And thank you for persevering with a word which combines wretched letters and an irritating pair of meanings. It took us to some unexpected places, as in GeoScanner’s “An old Bill Tidy comic character” and PeterMooreFuller’s “Sum of £1.01 - over 50% of equity”.</p>
<p>Dunnart gets the audacity award, not for the smut in his excellent “Heart pounds, having sex in empty doorway” but for his use of “®” in “Trademark tobacco – ‘Coarse Cut®’”. And one of our occasional inside-baseball moments happened delightfully with Porcia’s “Nit-picking the nitty-gritty”.</p>
<p>The runners-up, perhaps coincidentally, can both be read as references to This: Dimsworthy’s “Did wrongly go outside this month when missing Mother Nature” and Harlobarlo’s “Oddly, today I nearly quit drinking, initially out of curiosity”; the same could be said of the winner, Faiton77’s charming “Something to chew on. Time in home repairs the spirit”.</p>
<p>Kludos to Faiton. Please leave entries for this fortnight’s competition, and your picks from the broadsheet cryptics, below.</p>
<p>Clue of the Fortnight</p>
<p>Here’s a Telegraph Toughie clue from proXimal; it’s one of those ones where you need to stare at almost every word trying to work out what job it’s really doing.</p>
<p>21ac Rough stray caught scratching around (4)</p>
<p>[ wordplay: anagram of (‘stray’) CAUGHT without (‘scratching’) abbrev. for ‘circa’ (‘around’) ]</p>
<p>[ anagram of CAUGHT – CA ]</p>
<p>[ definition: rough (as a noun) ]</p>
<p>And when you see that the answer is THUG, you look back and see that every stage was fair. It’s important to be fair, during This, isn’t it?

<h3 id="the-pittsburgh-symphonys-savage-precision">&ldquo;The Pittsburgh Symphony’s Savage Precision&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5e3200bfe915b200084c79f1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/200210_r35823web.jpg" alt="img">
After listening to the Pittsburgh Symphony’s recent recording of the Bruckner Ninth Symphony for the tenth or eleventh time, I began planning a trip to Pittsburgh, in the hope of understanding how such a formidable achievement had come about. The playing is, first of all, at a very high technical level; the Pittsburgh musicians can withstand comparisons with their better-paid counterparts in Boston, New York, and Chicago. Yet note-perfect performances are hardly unusual in an age of impeccable conservatory training. What distinguishes this Bruckner Ninth is the rare and disconcerting expressive power of the interpretation. Savagely precise in detail, and almost scarily sublime in cumulative effect, it gives notice that the right orchestra and the right conductor can unleash unsuspected energies in familiar works.</p>
<p>The right conductor, in this case, is the sixty-one-year-old Austrian maestro Manfred Honeck, who has been Pittsburgh’s music director since 2008. Unlike such adventurous contemporaries as Simon Rattle and Esa-Pekka Salonen, Honeck has made his name with nineteenth-century classics. In collaboration with the Reference label, he and the Pittsburgh Symphony have recorded Beethoven’s Third, Fifth, and Seventh symphonies, Tchaikovsky’s Sixth, Dvořák’s Eighth, and other meat-and-potatoes fare. These releases are all worth hearing; some, like the Bruckner Ninth, may become standards by which future efforts are measured. David Allen, writing in the Times, is not the only critic to have compared Honeck to Carlos Kleiber, perhaps the most obsessively illuminating conductor of the late twentieth century.</p>
<p>How do Honeck and the Pittsburgh players do it? I wasn’t going to uncover any deep secrets during a brief stopover, but a conversation with the conductor and a visit to a couple of rehearsals afforded some clues. Honeck is a sunny-tempered man who grew up in a small alpine town and is devoutly Catholic. His approach to the core Austro-German repertory is informed by a profound knowledge of the traditions from which the music sprang. At the same time, as a former orchestral musician he finds practical solutions to the weighty questions he ponders in the scores. (Before he took up conducting, he was a violist in the Vienna Philharmonic.) Like Kleiber, an idol of his youth, Honeck plies his players with minute instructions, yet his attention to detail is in the service of a cogent musical vision.</p>
<p>In an interview backstage at Heinz Hall, where the orchestra performs, Honeck summed up his philosophy. He told me, “When I do a recording, when I make any kind of performance, I want two things: to show the identity of the orchestra, and to show what I think about the content of the score. I love this quote from Gustav Mahler: ‘The most important thing in music is not in the notes.’ What is the reason for this music? How can I understand what it means in the time in which it was written, and how can I transport this idea into our own time? With every bar, I have to think, Why? Why a half note here? Why held longer than before? Is it warm? Cold? If I don’t ask these questions, it becomes boring, a bad kind of routine.”</p>
<p>Honeck likes to tell stories about the music that he conducts. These are not of the clichéd “Fate knocking at the door” variety; they often have to do with regional cultures and rituals. He talks about the different kinds of Austrian and Bavarian Ländler dances, and determines which ones best apply to Bruckner or Mahler. In the Scherzo of Schubert’s Ninth Symphony, he hears an echo of the Schuhplattler dance, in which participants slap the soles of their shoes. In the second movement of Beethoven’s Seventh, he pictures a group of pilgrims singing “Sancta Maria.” Musicologists may not accept all of these ideas, but scholarly certitude is not the point. The images are plausible and potent, and they help the musicians find focus in their playing. On the Pittsburgh recording of the Seventh, the ostinato rhythm in the second movement takes on a distinctive vocal contour, with changing inflections from one note to the next.</p>
<p>The liner notes to the Reference releases, which are superbly engineered, include lengthy essays by Honeck, in which he lays out his reasoning on an almost bar-by-bar basis. His reading of the Bruckner Ninth as a kind of symphonic Mass—a hidden Miserere text in the first movement, an Agnus Dei in the third, with a demonic Scherzo interceding—goes a long way toward explaining how the recording attains such scouring intensity.</p>
<p>During my visit to Pittsburgh, Honeck was preparing a concert performance of Beethoven’s “Fidelio,” the version from 1806—the second of three iterations of an eternally problematic opera. Although the final incarnation of the score, from 1814, remains the most dramatically persuasive, the earlier versions, both known as “Leonore,” have much to recommend them, particularly in the sometimes riotous inventiveness of Beethoven’s orchestration. Honeck told me that he is especially fond of a duet, cut in 1814, in which the characters Leonore and Marzelline are shadowed by a cello and a violin, respectively.</p>
<p>I watched a rehearsal with several of the vocal soloists—Nicole Chevalier sang the title role, and Eric Cutler portrayed Florestan, the heroine’s imprisoned husband—and then a run-through of the complete score. Honeck stopped many times to apply his passionate meticulousness. In the scene in which Florestan finds Leonore unconscious, Honeck encouraged Cynthia Koledo DeAlmeida, the orchestra’s principal oboe, to play more hesitantly, with groping phrases: “He is insecure. What is happening? Is she dead or alive?” After “Dort sank sie hin”—“There she sank down”—an F-sharp dominant seventh in the strings gives way to a G-major triad. Honeck lavished a few minutes on this passing moment, coaxing the strings to let the first chord collapse into the second, without a break. The result was a shiver of Wagnerian Liebestod.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh recordings are full of such unexpected epiphanies. In the Beethoven Fifth, a work almost impossible to play in a fresh-sounding way, Honeck establishes an explosive tension between the thunderous four-note motto and the sotto-voce dialogue that follows in the strings. In the coda of the first movement, that motto blares forth from a seldom noticed inner voice in the horns, to stunning effect. (This happens at 6:36 on the Reference disk.) A similar juxtaposition of brutality and delicacy lends drama to Bruckner, a composer who is too often treated like a stone-faced monument. The diabolical tendency that Honeck detects in the Ninth’s Scherzo is only heightened by passages of Schubertian lyricism and Mendelssohnian sprightliness. The return of the hammering main motif feels all the more apocalyptically abrupt.</p>
<p>No conductor can exercise equal authority in all repertory. Before observing the “Fidelio” rehearsals, I attended a Sunday-matinée concert at which the orchestra played Bartók’s Concerto for Orchestra and Ravel’s “Boléro,” and accompanied the gifted young Korean pianist Seong-Jin Cho in Liszt’s Second Concerto. Everything was brilliantly executed, but the concert gravitated toward the kind of standard-issue orchestral virtuosity that Honeck generally avoids. I remember more grit and fire in a rendition of the Bartók that the late Mariss Jansons elicited from this great orchestra in 2000. Honeck periodically leads contemporary music, yet there is no obvious pattern to his explorations.</p>
<p>For the most part, the classical-music world is in need of conductors with broad horizons, who can guide audiences from a passive worship of the past to an active awareness of the present. The rote repetition of Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, and Mahler ultimately does those composers no favors. But we also need conductors who know how to revitalize the grand tradition—and orchestras that can respond in kind. At the moment, Pittsburgh is one of the few places on the international scene where that alchemy regularly happens. ♦

<p>Ask just about anybody who solves cryptic crosswords what the normal response is when they tell somebody about their hobby, and they’ll almost certainly say that they receive a baffled look and words along the lines of: “Oh, I could never solve cryptic crosswords; I just don’t ­understand how they work.”</p>
<p>There’s a tendency to think that the Telegraph crossword is tackled only by retired Army colonels in the Home Counties, Members of Parliament or aged academics in the better colleges at Oxford and Cambridge.</p>
<p>The reality is that anyone with a ­reasonable vocabulary can learn to solve them and get great enjoyment from them, given a little bit of time and patience.</p>
<p>In this series, we hope to demystify cryptic crosswords and explain in simple terms how they work and how just about anybody can find enjoyment in them.</p>
<p>Cryptic crosswords are proven to give mental health benefits, to distract from what else is going on in the world and slow mental decline later in life. Anyone can be a cryptic crossword champion!</p>
<p>Just what is a cryptic crossword?</p>
<p>To answer this question, we need to take a step back and look at a simpler type of puzzle: the definition-only crossword, or quick crossword.</p>
<p>A quick crossword does not contain any cryptic elements; each clue contains only a definition of the answer, for instance:</p>
<p>Type of dog (6)</p>
<p>What could be simpler than this? Well, actually quite a lot.</p>
<p>Presented with that clue in isolation, we are faced with a challenge that may prove insurmountable: there are many types of dog that are six letters in length: beagle, borzoi, collie, ­poodle, saluki, setter, Westie…</p>
<p>Given this, how can we work out which of these (and other possibilities) is required?</p>
<p>The answer is that we can’t; we can only guess, until we have some other letters to help us out. However, even this may not be enough for us to be sure of the solution.</p>
<p>Let us say that we know that the second letter of the answer is E: _ E _ _ _ _</p>
<p>This still gives three possibilities from our list above: beagle, setter and Westie, so there is only one thing we can do: we can write in our best guess (in pencil, in case we later find we have made the wrong choice).</p>
<p>What is a cryptic clue?</p>
<p>This is where a cryptic crossword comes into its own. A cryptic clue differs to a quick crossword clue, as it gives both a definition of the answer and a way to work out what the intended answer is.</p>
<p>A cryptic clue is unambiguous and will lead to one answer only. Let’s take the “type of dog” clue and add some more information:</p>
<p>Type of dog; an anagram of STREET (6)</p>
<p>We can now be sure of the answer, as only one dog is an anagram of STREET: SETTER.</p>
<p>Here are a couple more:</p>
<p>Type of dog, the name for which is hidden in the words ORC OR GIANT (5)</p>
<p>Type of dog, the name of which could also be a word describing Muhammad Ali (5)</p>
<p>Can you work these out? It should be quite easy to see that the answers are CORGI and BOXER respectively. Of course these aren’t real cryptic clues, but they are examples of how cryptic clues are structured.</p>
<p>What’s in a clue?</p>
<p>Each cryptic clue is in itself a ­little puzzle that can be unpicked and solved. A cryptic crossword isn’t just one ­puzzle; it’s around 30 puzzles all in one, which becomes easier the more of those little puzzles you can crack.</p>
<p>When reading a cryptic clue, most will contain two parts. They are:</p>
<p>DEFINITION. This is normally a synonym or example of the answer – so, in the above examples, it is always “type of dog”.</p>
<p>WORDPLAY. This is the secondary part of the clue, which ensures you can find the correct answer. It is the part that states the answer is an anagram, is hidden in other words, etc.</p>
<p>Let’s look at our “dog” clues again, now as they might appear in a cryptic crossword; in each case, the definition is in bold:</p>
<p>Dog disturbed street (6)</p>
<p>Queen’s favourite pet eaten by orc or giant (5)</p>
<p>Muhammad Ali, perhaps man’s best friend (5)</p>
<p>In each case, we have a definition, and the remainder of the clue tells us how to get to the answer. This gives us one of the most important rules of ­solving a cryptic crossword: The definition almost always appears at the start or end of a clue.</p>
<p>Now that we know this, we can start looking at the different types of clue that might be found in a cryptic crossword.</p>
<p>Anagram clues</p>
<p>Anagram clues – where the answer is a jumble of words found in the clue – are often a good place to start, as many people will already have some experience of tackling anagrams previously, whether watching a TV programme such as Countdown or trying other puzzles.</p>
<p>Anagrams can also be fun, for instance:</p>
<p>ASTRONOMER: MOON STARER</p>
<p>DEBIT CARD: BAD CREDIT</p>
<p>CLINT EASTWOOD: OLD WEST ACTION</p>
<p>SCHOOLMASTER: THE CLASSROOM</p>
<p>Anagram clues normally contain three things: u A definition of the answer. u The words that must be jumbled to give the answer. u An anagram indicator, which tells you to jumble words in the clue. These normally suggest movement or something being “unusual”.</p>
<p>Unjumbling the clue</p>
<p>Let’s look at an anagram clue, and try to unpick it: Group of musicians has rector dancing (9) The word “dancing” suggests motion, and we can see that the two words next to it, “has rector” contain nine letters.</p>
<p>This is promising! As the definition must be at one end of the clue, we can be pretty sure we are looking for an answer that means “group of musicians” and is also an anagram of HAS RECTOR – so the answer will be ORCHESTRA. Clue solved!</p>
<p>Here’s another one: Trainee acted strangely (5) “Strangely” is a word that can indicate something being presented in an unusual way, so this might be an anagram indicator. “Acted” has five letters, which is the same number as must be in the answer, so the definition must be “trainee”.</p>
<p>Is there an anagram of “acted” that means “trainee”? CADET fits, so we can write it into the grid.</p>
<p>Practice makes perfect</p>
<p>Try identifying the anagram indicator and definition in the following anagram clues, and then solving them. The ­answers are at the bottom of the page. Remember, the definition must be at one end of each clue! To help, we’ve given the first letter of each answer.</p>
<p>1 Giant drunk lager (5) L _ _ _ _</p>
<p>2 Article condemned musical performance (7) R _ _ _ _ _ _</p>
<p>3 Dishearten loser I made upset (10) D_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _</p>
<p>4 Decade Einstein transformed (8) N _ _ _ _ _ _ _</p>
<p>5 Treason ruined politician (7) S _ _ _ _ _ _</p>
<p>Quick Tips</p>
<p>Write in pencil. Not even the best solvers get everything right first time. There’s no shame in writing something in and then having to rub it out later on.</p>
<p>Look for obvious answers. There are normally around 30 clues in a cryptic crossword. Often, if you read the clues, you’ll see the answer length and immediately think of the right word to put in the grid.</p>
<p>Don’t worry if you can’t get started. Don’t be concerned if you struggle to get your first answer; a way into the puzzle is there somewhere. Remember that even the most experienced solvers have days when they can’t seem to unravel a single clue!</p>
<p>Split up multiple-word entries. It’s amazing how just drawing bars to split up the words in an answer can give the brain a boost. If an answer has word lengths (3,2,4,3), drawing bars in the grid to split up the words may well make the answer pop into your head OUT OF THIN AIR.</p>
<p>Look for anagrams. Most of our cryptic crosswords will contain five or six anagram clues; these are often a good place to start.</p>
<p>Ignore the surface reading of a clue. In 99 per cent of clues the surface reading is there just to distract; focus instead on trying to spot the definition and then the wordplay.</p>
<p>Don’t be ashamed to ask for help. There are all sorts of ways to get ­assistance. Ask friends or family, look at online resources such as ­solving blogs and don’t be ashamed to scour dictionaries. The answers are all in there somewhere!</p>
<p>Next week, we’ll have more tips and look at some other types of clue you’ll find in a cryptic crossword.</p>
