Joe Sugg, 28, has opened up about his time in isolation with his girlfriend Dianne Buswell, 30. The YouTuber and Strictly Come Dancing finalist light-heartedly admitted he was less than impressed to discover the professional dancer had ordered a treadmill for their home to keep fit during the coronavirus lockdown.</p>
<p>In a makeshift Big Brother inspired Diary Igloo created for the video which was shared with his 3.6 million YouTube subscribers, Joe admitted he was finding being in quarantine “harder than ever” due to the installation of the exercise equipment. He said: “I’m finding it harder than ever at the moment. Dianne’s just bought a treadmill. “Even though I’ve told her multiple, multiple times that we do not need a treadmill. “She’s got resistance bands. That’s like running anyway isn’t it? She’s even bought weights. She’s got dumbbells, she’s got resistance bands and now she’s bought a treadmill.” READ MORE&hellip; Joe Sugg in awkward moment with Dianne Buswell: ‘Had to show mine’</p>
