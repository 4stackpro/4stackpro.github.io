<p>St Patrick’s Day celebrations will, obviously, be very muted this year, courtesy of the Sars-Cov-2 virus – the new strain of coronavirus. It got me thinking about how saints have been linked with diseases, cures and doctors through the centuries.</p>
<p>St Patrick is cited as someone to pray to if you have epilepsy. Tradition has it that a person with epilepsy who slept on “leaba Pharaic” on Caher Island off the Mayo coast could be cured. According to folklore, St Patrick died on March 17th, AD 460, and his jawbone was preserved in a silver shrine. The relic was reported to be a source of solace for those experiencing difficulties with childbirth and epileptic seizures.</p>
<p>Our patron saint features strongly in references to Ireland’s holy wells. According to the authors of Fishstonewater – Holy Wells of Ireland, St Patrick is the saint most commonly associated with these locations. The water from St Patrick’s well in Rathvilly, Co Carlow, was traditionally used as a “cure” for toothache and earache.</p>
<p>Another well, at the foot of the Ox Mountains in Dromard, Co Sligo, also venerates St Patrick. Water from this well is said to cure eye and skin ailments. A bonus for this location is that a rock on top of the hill overlooking the well is said to cure backache. According to folklore, St Patrick rested his back against this rock while he was building the wall around the well. Bark from a tree over the well was used to relieve backache.</p>
<p>St Benedict is a true all rounder who helps those with fever, kidney disease and temptations of the devil&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some saints are specialists when it comes to combating disease, while others are generalists. St Lucy looks after eye disease, dysentery and “haemorrhages in general”, while St Benedict is a true all rounder who helps those with fever, kidney disease and “temptations of the devil”.</p>
<p>Specific diseases</p>
<p>Then there are the saints after whom specific diseases have been named: St Anthony and St Vitus. St Anthony’s Fire was the traditional name for erysipelas, a condition marked by redness and swelling of the skin brought on by streptococcal infection. A third-century Egyptian ascetic, St Anthony’s bones were enshrined in Vienne, France, where they reportedly helped heal pilgrims during an epidemic of erysipelas in the 11th century. And “St Vitus Dance” refers to convulsive twitchings and movements that suggest a grotesque dance. St Vitus was an Italian boy who was martyred by the Emperor Diocletian. During the 15th and 16th centuries children seeking good health danced around statues of St Vitus. The dancing was somewhat frenzied and the St Vitus name was then applied to the writhing movements of chorea, a condition brought on by acute rheumatic fever.</p>
<p>There are plenty of candidates when it comes to patron saints of medicine. Saints Cosmas and Damian are patron saints of medical doctors, surgeons and pharmacists. Twin brothers born in Arabia, both were trained medical doctors who were known for their compassionate practice of the medical sciences of their day. They were advocates of an approach termed “incubation”, in which the sick would move into churches or sanctuaries to be closer to God – and, hopefully, to a cure.</p>
<p>Gambling</p>
<p>St Camillus, as the patron saint of the sick, hospitals, nurses and physicians, is another all rounder. He is also reputedly a good bet for those seeking help with gambling. St Pantaleon, meanwhile, is often depicted as a physician holding a phial of medicine. A patron of the medical profession, he is invoked against tuberculosis and other lung diseases and is especially venerated in France and Germany.</p>
<p>Along with Cosmas and Damian, St Luke is the saint most associated with medicine. He was doctor to St Paul. Luke was the author of the Third Gospel and there are more than 30 medical references, to do with healing body and spirit, in his Gospel.

This is the first official governmental recognition I’ve received for the years I’ve been active in Australia 1978-ongoing, so I’m thrilled. I’d like to thank wholeheartedly those who nominated me for this honour and to assure all that I’ll continue to be active serving the community for as long as possible.”</p>
<p>He added: “I act as Chair of Rotary Melbourne’s Arts Committee; Freemasonry – I am Immediate Past Master and Education Officer of one of Freemason Victoria’s Lodges, and Jewish life, including my President’s role of kehillat s’dot zahav in Central Victoria and my links to Temple Beth Israel, where I assist Cantor Michel Laloum with choir direction for the yamim nora-im.</p>
<p>At the moment I’m working on a newly-established Youtube channel Kram’sNotes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw79y5sHqNen5v8mypdo9sg?view_as=subscriber">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw79y5sHqNen5v8mypdo9sg?view_as=subscriber</a></p>
<p>The idea was originally to create vignettes of my reflections about music. At the moment it consists exclusively of videoed backing tracks of opera arias which I play, mouth some works and give some cues, to help opera singers with their lessons, exams, competition, auditions and concerts when they don’t have a live accompanist.”</p>

<p>The Chinese Association, Victoria. Fellowships Institute of Chartered Accountants, 1972. Eddie Kutner says it is an honour to be recognized for his contributions to the community and to Australia. Coming from modest migrant beginnings, he is grateful for all that Australia has given him but says he did not achieve anything on his own. “I could not have done it without the support of my wife, family, friends, business partners and colleagues,” he said. What drives him now is a passion for science and its application in everyday life. “The significance of science, mathematics and technology led me to set up The Q Australia Foundation which supports Questacon in Canberra. His belief in the importance of science also led him to found Melbourne’s Wonderment Walk which is designed to engage passersby to recognize science in every day and to embrace science for its place in our lives. “I have always had a passion for science and its importance to the quality of life. “It’s imperative to pass an appreciation for all aspects of science, mathematics and technology to future generations,” he said.

<p>President’s award for outstanding service to Southern African Critical Care, 2006. Jeffrey Lipman told J-Wire: “I have worked hard, but I feel very honoured. It is fantastic recognition for all of the work that has been done in this field. I have done a lot of research into pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antibiotics in the ICU, and what that means for dosing, and this research and work is really my personality. I have an obsession to do my very best. I have been working up to 100 hours per week when on clinical shifts. I realised that the best healthcare system in the world was in Australia. I ran a big ICU in Soweto for many years, and then when I saw the Australian infrastructure, that was it.” Philip MUNZ, Melbourne VIC 3000 For significant service to the community through philanthropic initiatives, to medical research, and to business.

I learnt about businesses and set up offices in London, Paris, Indonesia, and in cities all over the world. I was so lucky to have such an extremely good boss. My boss was very happy to have a woman in charge of the business. I was and have been able to advocate for women and to help women all over the world.

<p>Former President, Technical Group. Awards and recognition include: Australian Sports Medal, for continued involvement as a national and international administrator in BMX, 2000.</p>
<p>Administrator of the Year, Australian Sports Federation. Abe Schneider believes people should never forget where they come from. He came to West Australia from Israel as a migrant in 1957. “I am still choked up to learn about being given an AM, it’s a life-changing moment for me. It’s a big deal. “However, I give credit to my wife, my life, my flame, my Barb. She and my family are everything to me” he said. He has been involved with BMX riding for many years and described how BMX riding tracks spread around Australia ‘like wildflowers’ but there were no regulations. It took years of his lobbying and great efforts to eventually take it to the world stage as an Olympic sport – under the banner of United Cyclists Internationale. “It’s not a sport for children. It’s a sport for adults, the riders are athletes” he said. “I am an uneducated man but have given speeches and dealt with international sporting presidents. I was able to get sponsorship for the sport so we could take it to many underdeveloped countries, something I am very proud of” he said. He imagines that his award is because of what he has done for the sport. He said credit must be given to his volunteer Board of professionals. “I didn’t do it all for this reason, but this is the greatest thank you,” he said. Shlomo WERDIGER, North Caulfield VIC 3161 For significant service to the Jewish community, and as a philanthropist. Professional Managing Director, Juilliard Group of Companies. Philanthropic Director and Trustee, Juilliard Philanthropy, current. Jewish Community United Israel Appeal, Victoria President, 2007-2017.</p>
<p>Cabinet Member, current. Yeshivah – Beth Rivkah Colleges Donations, Werdiger Family Hall.</p>
<p>Former Member, Committee of Management, Yeshivah Centre. Shlomo Werdiger said: “I would just say three things about the award: 1. All of my endeavours in this space are entirely thanks to my family, particularly my late father, Nathan, who showed us the way with philanthropy and public service and of course, my wife Shyrla. 2. As Chasidim we are brought up to be self-effacing. It’s entirely against the grain to seek the limelight. But when it comes to helping others, it’s a natural instinct to help, just because we can. When a chosid once told the 2nd Lubavitcher Rebbe that his work in the public space gave him a sense of self-importance, the Rebbe responded, I wish you to be like an onion (humble) but absolutely continue your public work. We do it in spite, not because. 3. In my opinion, the sole purpose of publicising acts of public service is to encourage others to harness their own capacities for the public good.” Raymond Laurence WHITTEN, Point Piper NSW 2027 For significant service to the law, particularly to legal reform and consumer protection.

<p>Chair, National Stock Exchange of Australia, 2005. “I have been in the law for over 50 years and have done my best and worked hard. I never expected this award, but it is incredibly satisfying to get this recognition and I am and honoured and humbled,” Ray Whitten told J-Wire. “As Society evolves reform is necessary and should be welcomed. Law is an integral element of society and law reform, whilst often difficult to achieve, is essential. I was privileged to work with a reformist New South Wales government to resolve the financial unsustainability of both WorkCover and the Compulsory Third Party scheme (Green Slips). With the aid of excellent advice from the staff of these bodies, we were able to achieve very substantial reforms which have reduced the cost of both schemes and ensured their sustainability for the future. The present pandemic of Covert-19 allows for extensive reform. We are seeing a significant change in the operation of the Federation in the formation and continuation of the National Cabinet. However, we must go further. The weakness of the global supply chain has been exposed. It is essential that Australia develop self-sufficiency in many products and services. We have the skills to manufacture high-value goods and must embrace this opportunity. On a strategic level, we must achieve self-sufficiency in oil and other essential supplies and maintain and increase defence spending. Only if we wholeheartedly embrace these reforms will Australia give our children and grandchildren the lives they deserve.” Emeritus Professor Peter Julius Rice ZELAS OAM, Longueville NSW 2066 For significant service to medicine, to health administration, and to humanitarian medical initiatives.

<p>Certificate of Commendation, Blacktown City Council, 2018 Peter Zelas told J-Wire: “It is an honour to receive this award. It has been a privilege to have had a career as a surgeon, but the acknowledgement in the Award would not have been possible without the unwavering support of my wife Ingrid and our 4 children. I appreciate as well the encouragement over the years from my colleagues and most of all, the patients whom I have had the pleasure to talk to and treat and who have given me the ultimate satisfaction in allowing me to be part of their health care and their lives.” MEDAL [OAM] OF THE ORDER OF AUSTRALIA IN THE GENERAL DIVISION Dr Edmond Arthur ADLER, Coolbinia WA 6050 For service to dentistry, and to professional organisations.

<p>Volunteer, University of Western Australia Visitors’ Centre. Ted Adler says that at age 92, he is happy to gain recognition for a lifetime of work in dentistry. “It’s a nice feeling to be recognised for a body of work,” he said. He was the first graduate dentist in West Australia in 1950. It was his passion for his chosen field that later led him to study the use of titanium dental implants in Sweden. After several visits to Sweden and becoming proficient, he came home and showed other dentists on how to use the procedure. At the age of 80, he gave up volunteering at the Perth Chevra Kadisha when it became too physically demanding. When J-Wire asked if he would celebrate his award, he said he might manage a glass of wine with those friends who are still around.

But, after my arrival in Melbourne, the sister-city, and then Australia as a whole, became for me a sweet home. In fact, all my 12 books and stories that I create for SBS radio are a declaration of love for this wonderful and infinitely kind country.

The work I do with Olivia, and being able to help her from here has been wonderful.

St. Luke is one of the four Gospel writers, and his account of Jesus’s life is the most extensive. He also detailed the earliest history of the Church in the New Testament. He is considered the founder of Christian iconography, and was known to be the physician and companion of St. Paul.</p>
<p>Luke came from Antioch, a part of what is now Turkey. His homeland became an important center of early Christianity, having already been known for arts and sciences. It is not known whether Luke was originally a Jew or a pagan, although it is suggested that he was a gentile before his conversion. Luke was educated as a physician, and one of the top historians of his time.</p>
<p>After Paul converted to Christianity and began to follow Jesus, Luke accompanied him as a physician and biographer. It is thought that Luke wrote the Acts of the Apostles, which details many of their journeys.</p>
<p>After Paul was killed as a martyr in 67, Luke is believed to have gone to the Mediterranean to preach the Gospel, and may have died there as a martyr himself.</p>
<p>The writings of Luke are the first to incorporate the personal testimony of Mary, and to outline her role as Christ’s mother and the Blessed Virgin. He is credited with several paintings of Mary, including the “Salvation of the Roman People,” which is still in the Basilica of St. Mary Major today.</p>
<p>St. Luke is the patron saint of artists, bachelors, doctors, and surgeons.

<h3 id="closed-heart-bypass-surgery-a-potential-game-changer">&ldquo;Closed heart bypass surgery a potential game-changer&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.graytvinc.com/images/surgery-cbs.jpg" alt="img">
Surgeons believe a new, non-invasive procedure could be a game-changer when it comes to heart bypass surgery. Meet one of the first patients to have it done at one of the few hospitals in the world putting it to use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel better than I have in a long time,&rdquo; said Skip Vichness, 71.</p>
<p>Vichness is back up and moving just a few weeks after having double coronary bypass surgery. It&rsquo;s a procedure that, until now, could have sidelined him with months of recovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The recovery has just been a miracle,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m back to normal, my heart is strong and I&rsquo;m able to do whatever I want to do. It just feels terrific.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because Vichness&rsquo; surgery was done totally endoscopically, meaning doctors were able to make small incisions and use a robot to complete the bypass and treat the serious blockages in his arteries.</p>
<p>Traditional bypass surgery is invasive and involves cutting open the chest. The recovery is much more painful and carries a higher risk of infection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a totally endoscopic bypass, patients return to their normal life very, very quickly. Without pain, without that prolonged recovery, without narcotics,&rdquo; said Dr. John Puskas, the chair of Cardiovascular Surgery at Mount Sinai St. Luke&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Puskas is one of the few surgeons in the world performing the new procedure. He says it&rsquo;s a more demanding and difficult operation but he believes it could be a game-changer for patients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think this could change the paradigm of how we treat the disease process that is the most common killer of human beings: coronary heart disease,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Vichness says he feels like he&rsquo;s been given a gift.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just been an amazing trajectory for me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Each day I feel better and better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hopes one day the surgery that saved his life will become the standard.

Dr Swee Ang image ICN/JS</p>
<p>Consultant orthopaedic surgeon, Dr Swee Ang, spoke about her faith and her growing understanding and concern for the plight of the Palestinian people, in a talk she gave at St Paul&rsquo;s, Cambridge on 12 January 2020. The full text follows:</p>
<p>I grew up in Singapore. When I was 19, I attended a Billy Graham Crusade and made the decision to follow Jesus. At that time I did not know that meant discipleship. I had not heard of his disciples like Nathanael, nor Andrew, nor Phillip, nor Simon and how with the exception of John, they were all martyred. My parents were Chinese speaking atheists. I also had no idea Jesus was a Jew!</p>
<p>Soon after that I was baptised in a Fundamentalist, Pro-Israel church. I taught Sunday school, including the conquest of Canaan, David and Goliath, and the victory of Elijah against the Philistines. For me, the Abrahamic Covenant only consisted of the Promised Land to God&rsquo;s chosen people Israel. . The creation of the State of Israel in 1948 transitioned neatly into a re-run of the Old Testament. We saw it as the fulfilment of God&rsquo;s prophesied plan for his people Israel in the Old Testament. Later that year we all rejoiced when Israel won the Six Day War. We were filled with pride and triumphalism that Israel had defeated the Arabs decisively.</p>
<p>I read the Old Testament and connected to the State of Israel without taking into consideration Jesus and the New Testament. I did not understand that the most important part of the Abrahamic Covenant was the promise of a Saviour through whom all nations will be blessed. I found out later that what Jesus spoke about to his followers in Matthew 5, was not inheriting the Land but inheriting the Earth and the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
<p>Thank God, I married a human rights lawyer. Two weeks later he fled arrest by the security police. A month later I was arrested for questioning. That was the first time I was put in prison. (Some of you might know that I had been in prison a couple more times since! The latest being in 2018 when I was medic on board the Freedom Flotilla Awda loaded with antibiotics and dressings for Gaza. The boat was abducted in international waters. All on board were taken to prison in Ashdod and cargo and boat impounded to this day.)</p>
<p>Upon release from Singapore prison, I found my husband in London and we both became political refugees. It was a great comedown. From being middle class professional Singaporeans we became homeless, jobless and stateless refugees. We struggled desperately to rebuild our lives.</p>
<p>In 1982, five years later, we were just about sorted out. I had become a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England and was working in St Thomas&rsquo; Hospital. My husband found work as a journalist. We had a permanent place to live in.</p>
<p>But God was about to change things.</p>
<p>The television ran nightly news on a war in Lebanon. The country was relentlessly bombed. Its capital Beirut was held siege. Food, medicine, water and electricity were blockaded. Although portrayed as a war against the terrorist Palestine Liberation Organisation, it was clear that the bomb targets were civilians - hospitals, schools, homes, factories, shops - and not terrorists. The headlines were 14,000 killed and tens of thousands made homeless a few weeks into the war. There were pictures of wounded victims, many children, some dying, in partially bombed hospitals. Charred bodies were pulled out of bombed out buildings, including bodies of small children.</p>
<p>My heart was torn apart watching the suffering. It was made worse when I learnt that the offensive was by Israel. I became restless and anxious for the victims.</p>
<p>How could Israel do this? To compound matters, my Christian friends were celebrating the death and destruction citing Biblical verses, calling this the work of God&rsquo;s hand!</p>
<p>How should a Christian surgeon respond? What would Jesus say? I needed wisdom and guidance, but my immediate circle provided none. Finally God spoke. In Corinthians, the Apostle Paul wrote about &ldquo;seeing darkly as through a glass, but one day we will see face to face&rdquo; and about how we &ldquo;are children and thought and spoke as children, but when we grow up we will put aside childish things&rdquo;. He went on &ldquo;Faith, hope and love endure forever, but the greatest of these is love. &quot; I began to ask God &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A week later an appeal came from Christian Aid for a volunteer orthopaedic surgeon to treat the wounded. God had answered my prayers. I resigned from St Thomas&rsquo; Hospital, joined Christian Aid as a volunteer surgeon on their medical team and left for Beirut. For the first time that summer my heart was at peace.</p>
<p>We had to get to Beirut by sea since the airport was bombed. The ferry was not able to land as the war planes pounded this capital continuously for 36 hours. We got in when there was a gap in the bombing.</p>
<p>The situation was hideous, blocks and blocks of high rise buildings reduced to heaps of rubble - just as on television - only this time life size and three dimensional. Homeless families were all over the pavements and road sides. Hundreds were buried under the rubble. There was no water and electricity. I started work in the converted basement carpark of the Near East Theological College treating horrendous war injuries - the young, the old, men, women and babies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Israel had threatened to flatten the whole of Lebanon to get the PLO.</p>
<p>Ten weeks after the war started, fourteen thousand members of the PLO agreed to leave Lebanon forever in exchange for a ceasefire. The USA had agreed that their families left behind would be protected by a multinational peacekeeping force.</p>
<p>With the evacuation, I was seconded to work for the Palestine Red Crescent Society, a member of both the International Red Cross and the PLO. Eight of their hospitals and 13 clinics were totally destroyed. The only hospital standing was Gaza Hospital. I was to set up an orthopaedic trauma department for that hospital.</p>
<p>Gaza Hospital overlooked Sabra Shatilla, one of the fourteen Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon. For someone who grew up seeing Palestinians as terrorists, I was shocked and outraged to learn of how the refugee camps came into existence.</p>
<p>In 1948 half the population of Palestine - 750,000 persons - were driven out of their homes at gunpoint and the threat of being massacred. They fled into the neighbouring countries of Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Egypt. Their country Palestine became Israel and they were never allowed to return home. Over the years their tents gave way to buildings and the refugee camps became towns. Here children were born refugees, grew up refugees and died refugees.</p>
<p>The world moved on and they were forgotten. They remained stateless since Palestine no longer existed.</p>
<p>Every single home in the refugee camps was destroyed - either totally or partially. I watched women with young children and elderly relatives, many also wounded; carrying their belongings back to these ruins. They had lost loved ones through the evacuation, through the bombs, but they once again started to repair their damaged homes, clear the rubble, paint the walls, support each other and pick up their broken lives.</p>
<p>These people had suffered so much yet remained so human, generous, kind and dignified. I was overwhelmed by their generosity in the midst of their poverty. Their story was not in any history textbook, but every Palestinian child knew the name of their village in Palestine. Many of these villages had already been blown up after they left. Gaza Hospital was named after the Gaza Strip in Palestine.</p>
<p>I sat in their bombed out homes while they served me Arabic coffee and shared their meagre United Nation food rations with me. The women introduced me to their traditional Palestinian embroidery of stunning beauty. Patterns and motifs typical of their home villages they left behind in Palestine were sewn on black cloth with brilliantly coloured silk threads. Each stitch is a testimony of their history, heritage, culture and resilience.</p>
<p>I fell in love with the Palestinians - but was still wondering at the back of my mind how come they were labelled terrorists.</p>
<p>Three weeks later the Multinational Peacekeeping Force protecting the Palestinian refugees abruptly withdrew and the land invasion by Israeli tanks took place. Hundreds of tanks over-ran West Beirut and some surrounded Sabra Shatilla. They sealed Sabra Shatilla so no one could escape and sent their allies, the right-wing Christian Phalanges into the camps. What followed was the infamous, savage Sabra Shatilla Massacre killing 3,500 Palestinians and Lebanese.</p>
<p>Our surgical team worked non-stop for 72 hours till we were forced out of Gaza Hospital at machine- gun point. We had worked 72 hours non-stop in the basement operating theatre, for the most part without food and water, to save a few dozen lives - only to emerge to find out that people were killed by the thousands in the camp. Many of them were tortured before death, and women were raped before being killed.</p>
<p>Groups of camp people were held captive along the road we were forced to march along. From their terrified faces, they knew they were going to be killed. A young mother tried to give me her little baby - hoping I could take it to safety. Both were killed.</p>
<p>The Massacre had exploded the myth that Palestinians are terrorists. The heaps of bodies in the camp alleys finally convinced the world that they were the victims of terror. Robbed of their homeland, driven to live in poverty and insecurity in the refugee camps, they were finally butchered on foreign soil. On each dead body was a refugee identity card stating their place of origin in Palestine. Most of the dead were refugees from Galilee.</p>
<p>Up till then I had lived 33 years without knowing Palestinians existed. I bought into the lie that they were terrorists. I used to be that strident Zionist Christian teaching my Sunday school children that</p>
<p>Israel must annihilate the PLO terrorists. I got blood on my hands. I felt crushed. I asked God to forgive me for my prejudice and bigotry against them. They are the children of God and my brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Palestinians can only suffer and die daily because we fail to see them as human beings, and choose to walk the other way. I can no longer walk away. I asked God for forgiveness, I must also repent. Just crying and feeling sorry were not enough. Like Zacchaeus on that sycamore tree in Jericho, and Paul on the Damascus Road, my life had to change. &ldquo;Lord - take my life and use it for these people whom we have collectively wronged. Please give me a second chance to serve them. Teach me to love them more and more&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is my thirty eighth year journeying with the Palestinians. They have accepted me as their family.</p>
<p>That journey brought me to the Occupied Palestinian Territories where brutal abuses of human rights take place daily.</p>
<p>In the West Bank daily arbitrary arrests and house demolitions are the norm. In 2019 alone five and a half thousand Palestinians were arbitrarily arrested, of which 889 were children and 128 were women. West Bank is imprisoned behind a seven hundred kilometre separation wall cutting through homes, schools and farms.</p>
<p>Gaza has been blockaded for 12 years and bombarded by land, air and sea with several thousand killed and many more made homeless. Among the dead were more than a thousand children. Electricity is scarce and safe drinking water non-existent. Since March 2018, more than three hundred unarmed demonstrators asking for the right to return home were shot dead by snipers, with 36,000 wounded, a third of them children and women. More than 1,500 will never walk again due to high velocity sniper wounds to their legs.</p>
<p>As we celebrate 2020, Gaza has become unliveable. My latest attempts to go and help Gaza resulted in being imprisoned and deported.</p>
<p>I pray that God will give me courage to continue to be faithful to them in the face of persecution. I must have faith that after the crucifixion comes resurrection. I have often been asked by my Palestinian friends &ldquo;Swee - as Palestinians we are born to suffer and have no choice. But why do you not walk away?&rdquo; I recall Jesus asking His disciples the same question &ldquo;Will you also walk away?&rdquo; Peter replied &ldquo;Lord - to whom shall we go? You have the words of life.&rdquo; How can I walk away and stay human?</p>
<p>For me, being with the Palestinians is a great blessing from God. I identify with David when he was broken before God in deep gratitude saying: &ldquo;Who am I Sovereign Lord, and what is my family, that you brought me this far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a surgeon, I mend wounds. But I am a human being. I must speak up about how they were caused. Since that time, I have a passion to speak out in obedience to God&rsquo;s command &ldquo;speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some people are called to speak on behalf of the unborn because they cannot speak for themselves. Others are called to speak up for the environment. I am called to speak up for the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Speaking up invites persecution. Each time before I speak in public I pray Second Timothy 1:7 &ldquo;For God hath not given us the Spirit of fear, but of Power, and of Love and a Sound Mind&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I still have with me my picture of destitute Palestinian children of Shatila camp standing amidst the ruin and rubble. They survived the massacre but lost their parents and homes. In the foreground of the picture were dead and decaying bodies; in the background their destroyed homes. The air was filled with the stench of decomposing bodies. But between death and destruction were the Palestinian children. As I focussed my camera, they raised their hands in the victory sign and said to me: &ldquo;We are not afraid, let Israel come&rdquo;. I have returned many times to the camps looking for them. I have never been able to find them again. They must have perished since. Their wish was for me to show their picture to all my friends, the picture of them standing courageously against this dark uncaring world. I have honoured that wish.</p>
<p>They live forever in my heart. Whenever the situation becomes unbearable, I revisit this picture for strength. There will be no turning back from this journey towards humanity. And today I invite you to join us too.</p>

About 400,000 women get breast implants in the U.S. every year &ndash; most for cosmetic reasons. But now plastic surgeons in Britain are warning about the dangers of breast implants as more women are reporting pain and extreme fatigue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m terrified,&rdquo; said Naomi Macarthur, a breast implant patient who recorded a video just weeks before getting surgery to remove her implants. The London-born 28-year-old says they made her so tired she couldn&rsquo;t even do simple things. &ldquo;Writing with a pen was that tiring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She couldn&rsquo;t write let alone workout like she used to as a personal trainer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The amount of pain and suffering that I had to go through. And going to clinics, and hospitals and doctors, and saying to them, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m so ill,&rsquo; and them saying, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not due to the implants,&rdquo; Macarthur told the BBC.</p>
<p>But Macarthur didn&rsquo;t believe it, so she did her own research. She found other women online with the same symptoms. Patients call it breast implant illness.</p>
<p>Plastic Surgeons) (cover middle with implants)</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s poorly recognized, to be perfectly honest. They haven&rsquo;t proven that silicone causes direct harm to the body. But there are not very many studies,&rdquo; said Nora Nugent, a surgeon with the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons.</p>
<p>In the U.S., the FDA is also looking into breast implant illness saying on its website: researchers are investigating these symptoms to better understand their origins.</p>
<p>One U.S. manufacturer says it takes this matter seriously and that patient safety is its number one priority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m about to go down and I&rsquo;m scared,&rdquo; Macarthur said in her video. After living with the implants for four years, she decided to remove them in March.</p>
<p>She says she felt better as soon as she woke up from surgery. &ldquo;I had completely blood shot eyes all the time, and my eyes are white now,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Macarthur says the experience has been a life lesson. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the most important is long-term health,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Now, she says she&rsquo;s stronger than ever.

St. Dympna – Stress, Anxiety and Mental Health</p>
<p>St. Dymphna is patroness of those who suffer through stress, anxiety and mental illness. She was only 15 when she was martyrd in defense of her purity. When her mother passed, her father was afflicted with mental illness and attempted to marry her. After fleeing her home, her father found her and killed her. While some have never heard of St. Dymphna, she is growing in popularity because of the growing world of stress, fear and anxiety we live in. She welcomes our prayers and petitions of healing when it comes to our emotional health and wellness.
