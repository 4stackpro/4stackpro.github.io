Comedian-turned-mental health campaigner Mike King is vowing to press on with his Gumboot Friday charity appeal despite twin obstacles of the Covid-19 outbreak and an ongoing cold war with the Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>King said he was committed still holding his annual Gumboot Friday tomorrow, but its aim and message has been tempered by recent events and would take place largely on Facebook focusing on &ldquo;the message this year, not money&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be poor form on our part to emotionally blackmail people to give at the moment. Donate responsibly, you can do it online, but there are other ways to help. Our focus is now on connecting with kids&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>King, once a volatile entertainer, reinvented himself over the past decade to become a high-profile - if unorthodox - campaigner against suicide.</p>
<p>In February last year his campaigning saw him named Kiwibank&rsquo;s &ldquo;New Zealander of the Year,&rdquo; but only months later he ran into a storm of official criticism - driven largely by ethics, privacy and safety concerns - over plans to collect and study hundreds of suicide notes.</p>
<p>His Gumboot Fund - an initiative to pay for counselling services for teens on demand - made headlines in October after it exhausted its annual budget in months, sparking concerns from mental health providers that vulnerable young people were having expectations raised then dashed.</p>
<p>A November 8 email from deputy director-general of health Robyn Shearer to King, obtained by the Herald under the Official Information Act, laid out the Ministry&rsquo;s position on whether it would bail out the fund in formal language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We take seriously the need for due diligence and the need for appropriate processes to be followed when it comes to the use of public funds,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The letter ended with an invitation &ldquo;to meet with you and work together&rdquo;.</p>
<p>‌</p>
<p>King this week said he had not followed up on the offer as there was &ldquo;no point in talking&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A week before that letter was sent - shortly after news broke the Gumboot Fund had exhausted its capacity - an evening email exchange between King and Shearer boiled over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the ministry cannot step in and fund this initiative I am happy to talk with you on how this situation could be managed &hellip; with some new boundaries and extra limitations,&rdquo; Shearer said.</p>
<p>Minutes later, King replied: &ldquo;Thank you for outlining the [ministry&rsquo;s] position of no funding for the Gumboot Friday initiative &hellip; I&rsquo;d like to thank you for your very generous offer to help us &lsquo;manage the situation&rsquo; and your advice on next steps, but we&rsquo;ll be fine managing the situation on our own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>‌</p>
<p>King told the Herald this week the exchange had been frustrating. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fair to say I was upset - but it really galvanised to me the reason we don&rsquo;t ask for Government funding. We&rsquo;re not Government contractors,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>A briefing prepared by the ministry in February reiterated the lack of official involvement in King&rsquo;s activities:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Key to Life Trust is now promoting the fundraising campaign for Gumboot Friday 2020, which will take place on 3 April 2020. The ministry has not been asked to be involved. We will be reaching out to the Key to Life Trust again to offer to assist them in ensuring sustainability of the fund and the safety and care for young people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Questions to the Ministry of Health this week were answered with a statement, confirming the November 8 letter was the last contact with King and his trust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ministry of Health is not involved with Gumboot Friday&hellip; To date, the ministry has not received a funding request from the Key to Life Charitable Trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Government committed significant funds through the Wellbeing budget to a five-year programme focused on ensuring that people can access free and immediate advice and support that most suits their needs, where and when they need it,&rdquo; the statement said.</p>
<p>King said his Key to Life Trust - which administered the Gumboot Fund and which he said he drew no salary from - had enough reserves to &ldquo;keep us going for eight months&rdquo; and any funds raised online on Friday would go directly to funding counsellors.</p>
<p>New Zealand Association of Counsellors president Christine Macfarlane said the Gumboot Fund lacked processes and oversight seen in other publicly-funded counselling initiatives, but while King was a polarising figure he deserved some credit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do applaud Mike for his passion and his ability to keep doing this in the face of so much criticism. It&rsquo;s not an easy place to be standing up and talking about mental health, and he does come up with a different way of looking at it,&rdquo; she said.

<h3 id="we-have-so-much-to-be-grateful-for-mike-kings-advice-to-survive-the-lockdown">&lsquo;We have so much to be grateful for&rsquo;: Mike King&rsquo;s advice to survive the lockdown</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2020/04/how-this-year-s-gumboot-friday-is-a-little-different/_jcr_content/par/video/image.dynimg.1280.q75.jpg/v1585862384405/Mike-King-Gumboot-Friday-1120.jpg" alt="img">
&ldquo;This year given the crisis that&rsquo;s going on we&rsquo;ve taken the emphasis off money,&rdquo; King told The AM Show on Friday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s just a bit hard asking people to donate money when they&rsquo;re not sure if they&rsquo;ve got jobs, and we all know that the poorest give the most so our key message this year is give responsibly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout the online event, King will be giving tips to parents on how to help their children stay mentally healthy throughout the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think if we all start connecting with our kids again and valuing them and validating their thinking and finding out what&rsquo;s going on in their little heads by giving them our time most of them won&rsquo;t need counsellors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last year, Gumboot Friday raised $1.3 million to provide more than 15,000 counselling sessions for thousands of young Kiwis.</p>
<p>As part of the campaign, King is calling on people to check in on those closest to them and let them know they are not alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a lot of our kids what they need is an ear but we&rsquo;re always so busy with our busy lives and our busy jobs that we don&rsquo;t have the time - well guess what, we&rsquo;ve all got the time now so let&rsquo;s put our time in and our efforts into supporting our kids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In recent years, King has been open about his own battles with depression and says he is acutely aware that in testing times like these it can be difficult to keep anxiety at bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anxiety is caused by stressing over what you have no control over in the future, the pressure of reflecting on a whole lot of things that have gone wrong in the past and going over and over on them until eventually it drives you into the ground,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being worried about what we&rsquo;re in at the moment is a bit like worrying about a traffic jam - no matter what you think sitting in your car, it ain&rsquo;t going to get rid of the traffic jam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>King says the antidote to such feelings is focusing on the now and being grateful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s about getting into the moment,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every single one of us would give up everything we own to save one of our kid&rsquo;s lives, so that puts everything into perspective. If your kids are still with you, if your family and your loved ones are still with you, then you&rsquo;ve got so much to be grateful for - don&rsquo;t wait for a tragedy to happen before you have all of those feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get those feelings now and really live in the moment. It&rsquo;s a hard thing to do but if you practise it over and over again it gets easier.</p>

Warning: This article discusses suicide.</p>
<p>Mental health advocate Mike King has announced a three-hour Facebook live event he hopes will help New Zealanders coping with anxiety around the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>The live event has been organised to commemorate Gumboot Friday, an initiative King launched to support those who have depression.</p>
<p>King and others embarked on a tour of New Zealand on tractors this month to raise awareness for the Gumboot Friday fundraiser, but the tour was cancelled due to restrictions on public events.
