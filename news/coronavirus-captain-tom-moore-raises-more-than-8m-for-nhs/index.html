<p>A 99-year-old army veteran who has raised more than £8m for the NHS said the fundraising has been &ldquo;completely out of this world&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Tom Moore aimed to raise £1,000 by completing 100 laps of his Bedfordshire garden by Thursday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every penny that we get, they [the NHS] deserve every one of it,&rdquo; he said, as the total exceeded the £5m mark.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a school girl has started a campaign for children to make cards for his 100th birthday on 30 April.</p>
<p>Reegan Davies, eight, from Port Talbot, Wales, has set a goal of making 1,500 virtual cards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can post them on any social media with the hashtag #makeacardfortom.&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Mr Moore began raising funds to thank the &ldquo;magnificent&rdquo; NHS staff who helped him with treatment for cancer and a broken hip.</p>
<p>With the aid of a walking frame, he hoped to walk 100 laps of the 25-metre (82ft) loop in his garden in Marston Moretaine, in 10-lap chunks, before his 100th birthday.</p>
<p>Image caption Mr Moore uses a walking frame to help him on his laps of the garden</p>
<p>More than 345,000 people from around the world have donated money to his fundraising page since it was set up last week.</p>
<p>At the government&rsquo;s daily press conference Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: &ldquo;I want to pay a special tribute today to Captain Tom Moore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Tom, you&rsquo;re an inspiration to us all, and we thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the amount exceeded £4m earlier, Mr Moore&rsquo;s daughter Hannah Ingram-Moore said they had thought raising £1,000 was a &ldquo;real stretch&rdquo; and the latest total was &ldquo;just amazing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Humbled, floored and proud&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It [has been] beyond our wildest expectations, no words can express our gratitude to the British public for getting behind Tom,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are humbled, floored and proud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the British public has done is given him his next purpose&hellip; I think he&rsquo;ll do this until everyone says &lsquo;stop, don&rsquo;t do this any more&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He has said he will not stop and hopes to do another 100 laps.</p>

<p>Ellie Orton, chief executive of the charity NHS Charities Together, which will benefit from the funds, had said reaching £5m was &ldquo;absolutely incredible&rdquo;.</p>
<p>She also wanted to &ldquo;express our gratitude and our huge admiration for Captain Tom, for the NHS and for everybody who is donating&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Good Morning Britain viewers went above and beyond in the space of 24 hours by helping 99-year-old war veteran Captain Tom Moore raise £1million for those working on the NHS frontline.</p>
<p>After an appearance on yesterday’s show, Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid called up the fundraiser once again after he had soared past his £500,000 target to be inches away from the £1million.</p>
<p>In fact, donations were coming in so fast, the JustGiving page set up to raise the cash actually crashed due to overwhelming demand and attention.</p>

<p>Captain Tom had initially only planned to raise £100,000 in order to walk 100 lengths of his garden while in quarantine, in time for his 100th birthday on 30 April.</p>
<p>But the war hero was overwhelmed by the generosity of viewers, and Piers and Susanna themselves, who put a large chunk of cash to get him over the £500k line.</p>
<p>He told the pair: ‘Piers and Susanna it is amazing and thank you Piers for your contribution yesterday. It was enormous, it was so kind of you.’</p>

<p>Piers publicly donated £10,000 yesterday (Picture: ITV)</p>
<p>‘It’s marvellous for our doctors and nurses on the front line,’ the captain continued. ‘In the last war it was soldiers in uniform on the front line. This time our army are the doctors and nurses uniforms. They’re doing such a marvellous job.’</p>
<p>‘Thank you very very much. You are so kind. It’s such a benefit to so many people. You’re giving hope to the people finding it very difficult. We will survive this,’ he ended.</p>
<p>‘Captain Tom, you are an absolute legend,’ Piers told him. ‘And we are so proud of you for serving your country in WWII, and for serving us again now for what you’re doing for your walk.’</p>
<p>Susanna also donated, with thousands of donations flooding in soon after (Picture: ITV)</p>
<p>‘Congratulations and keep going,’ the host ended.</p>
<p>His appearance sparked another spike in interest as they praised the pensioner for his amazing dedication to his country in his time of need.</p>

<p>All money raised will go towards NHS Charities Together, in order to help those in the NHS combatting the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The fundraising number is still soaring, with an incredible £1.4million raised at the time of writing.</p>
<p>You can still donate by visiting his JustGiving page.</p>

<h3 id="we-salute-captain-tom-moore-99-and-8m-tribute-to-nhs-the-yorkshire-post-says">We salute Captain Tom Moore, 99, and £8m tribute to NHS: The Yorkshire Post says</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/webimg/QVNIMTE0NTgxMjc5.jpg" alt="img">
We salute Captain Tom Moore, 99, and £8m tribute to NHS: The Yorkshire Post says</p>
<p>CAPTAIN Tom Moore believed he was simply doing his duty when he chose to mark his centenary year by walking 10 circuits of his garden to raise £1,000 for NHS Charities Together.</p>
<p>By YP Comment Wednesday, 15th April 2020, 5:59 pm</p>
<p>Captain Tom Moore, with his daughter Hannah Ingram-Moore, afterr his NHS charity walk inspired donations in excess of £5m. Photo: BBC News.</p>
<p>He’s not only done that. This proud soldier has left the whole country both inspired – and humbled – by his humility and fortitude after his story led to pledges of support in excess of £8m and counting.</p>
<p>The equivalent of every person living in Yorkshire donating more than a pound, ‘Captain Tom’, as he is affectionately known, is no ordinary nonagenerian – the 99-year-old has been treated for a broken hip and cancer in recent times.</p>

<p>One of the latest tributes to the NHS - this time in Manchester.</p>
<p>But his determination – his family liken him to “a stoic Yorkshireman” – has given Britain an incredible lift as families across the land prepare for the latest celebration of carers and key workers on the doorsteps.</p>
<p>“When you think of who it is all for – all those brave and super doctors and nurses we have got – I think they deserve every penny, and I hope we get some more for them too,” says this modest hero.</p>
<p>Too right. Words that will resonate with all NHS staff, and all carers, they’re even more profound coming from such a grateful veteran – resplendent in a navy blazer with his war medals proudly on show – who has to use a walking frame to complete every step of his personal marathon.</p>
<p>And while a knighthood would be fitting recognition for this former civil engineer who grew up in Keighley before enlisting in the Army during the Second World War, serving with distinction in India and Burma, The Yorkshire Post, for one, hopes that ‘Captain Tom’ is willing and able to lead the annual parade of veterans past the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday.</p>
<p>It would be the ultimate tribute to this solder-in-a-million, his comrades lost in battle on foreign fields and the NHS during a traumatic year in which the world has had to confront an invisible enemy like no other.</p>
<p>Editor’s note: first and foremost - and rarely have I written down these words with more sincerity - I hope this finds you well.</p>
<p>Almost certainly you are here because you value the quality and the integrity of the journalism produced by The Yorkshire Post’s journalists - almost all of which live alongside you in Yorkshire, spending the wages they earn with Yorkshire businesses - who last year took this title to the industry watchdog’s Most Trusted Newspaper in Britain accolade.</p>
