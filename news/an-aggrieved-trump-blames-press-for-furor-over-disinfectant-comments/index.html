(CNN) After shocking the nation last week with his toxic suggestion that the coronavirus might be treated with an injection of disinfectant , President Donald Trump avoided the briefing room Saturday and retreated into the recesses of the White House, emerging on Twitter only to air his grievances about his press coverage.</p>
<p>For Americans, the President&rsquo;s absence from the podium might have been the best medicine at a time when states are beginning to reopen and they are seeking guidance from scientists and medical experts about whether it is safe to venture from their homes.</p>
<p>For weeks now as aides and allies have urged Trump to stop doing daily briefings , the President has commandeered the microphone, dispensing self-congratulatory assessments of his administration&rsquo;s handling of the pandemic. He&rsquo;s questioned some governors&rsquo; desperate pleas for personal protective equipment, ventilators and Covid-19 testing equipment. He has railed at state officialswho don&rsquo;t seem sufficiently grateful to him and snapped at reporters for &ldquo;nasty questions&rdquo; and unflattering news coverage.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on scientific guidance from doctors and experts, the briefings under Trump&rsquo;s control have often taken on the braggadocios tone of the President&rsquo;s political rallies, leading to worries among Democrats about the fact that former Vice President Joe Biden , his presumptive Democratic rival, has no equivalent platform.</p>
<p>While Trump does share the microphone with his medical advisers like Dr. Anthony Fauci, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn and Dr. Deborah Birx, the President&rsquo;s own statements about the coronavirus at the podium have been threaded with falsehoods and inaccurate information, often stoking confusion that has to be cleared up later by his team.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Trump&rsquo;s tendency to muse aloud about baseless theories that usually live in the dark corners of the Internet veered into dangerous territory as he questioned whether it would be possible to kill the coronavirus by streaming light into the body or through a shot of disinfectant.</p>
<p>With aides clearly concerned that contradicting him might lead to their exits during a pandemic, no one corrected him in that moment. On Thursday in the midst of Trump&rsquo;s tangent about disinfectant, Birx stared hard at the floor , briefly telling him when he asked, that she&rsquo;d never heard of sun or heat as a coronavirus treatment.</p>
<p>The consequences were serious: in the past few days state officials and disinfectant manufacturers have rushed to warn Americans about the dangers of using chemicals or household cleaners in any other manner than what is printed on the label.</p>
<p>During a Saturday afternoon briefing, Illinois Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike reported a significant increase in calls to poison control , including, she said, someone who tried using a detergent-based solution like a sinus rinse and another person who gargled with a bleach and mouthwash mixture in an effort to kill germs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Injecting, ingesting, snorting household cleaners is dangerous,&rdquo; Ezike warned. &ldquo;It is not advised and can be deadly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s controversial comments offered an opening to Biden, who weighed in on Twitter: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe I have to say this,&rdquo; Biden tweeted Friday, but please don&rsquo;t drink bleach.&rdquo; And Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday likened the President&rsquo;s suggestion to &ldquo;embalming,&rdquo; telling CNN&rsquo;s Jake Tapper: &ldquo;We spend a lot of time on what the President said, when, and &ndash; disinfectant in the body. You know what they call that? They call that embalming. That&rsquo;s the medical term.&rdquo;</p>
<p>JUST WATCHED See Dr. Birx&rsquo;s reaction to Trump&rsquo;s dangerous suggestion Replay More Videos &hellip; MUST WATCH See Dr. Birx&rsquo;s reaction to Trump&rsquo;s dangerous suggestion 04:20</p>
<p>In the midst of shifting explanations from the White House about the context of Trump&rsquo;s remarks in Thursday evening&rsquo;s briefing, the President hinted Saturday that his days at the briefing room podium might be coming to an end.</p>
<p>In one tweet, Trump questioned the value of holding White House press briefings, saying they are &ldquo;not worth the time &amp; effort&rdquo; if the media is going to just ask &ldquo;nothing but hostile questions.&rdquo; Trump also noted the &ldquo;record ratings&rdquo; for his appearances.</p>
<p>In a subsequent tweet, he tried to rewrite the narrative about his own early skepticism about the origins and potential spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never said the pandemic was a Hoax! Who would say such a thing?&rdquo; Trump tweeted Saturday. &ldquo;I said that the Do Nothing Democrats, together with their Mainstream Media partners, are the Hoax. They have been called out &amp; embarrassed on this, even admitting they were wrong, but continue to spread the lie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As CNN has reported, Trump used the term hoax when he compared Democratic criticism of the administration&rsquo;s response to the virus to their efforts to impeach him: &ldquo;This is their new hoax,&rdquo; he said at a February 28 rally in South Carolina.</p>
<p>Shifting explanations from the White House</p>
<p>After abruptly leaving the briefing room Friday without taking any questions from reporters who were seeking to clarify his comments about injections, Trump continued to try to shift blame to reporters for misunderstanding him throughout the weekend.</p>
<p>During a Friday bill signing ceremony in the Oval Office, Trump insisted he had made the comments sarcastically to reporters, even though there was no hint of sarcasm in his Thursday delivery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was asking a very sarcastic question to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside. But it does kill it, and it would kill it on the hands, and that would make things much better. That was done in the form of a sarcastic question to the reporters,&rdquo; Trump said Friday.</p>
<p>During an interview with Fox News, Birx suggested that Trump was simply processing the information from a prior briefing aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he gets new information, he likes to talk that through out loud and really have that dialogue &ndash; and so that&rsquo;s what dialogue he was having,&rdquo; Birx said. &ldquo;I think he just saw the information at the time, immediately before the press conference, and he was still digesting that information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in an interview Sunday on CNN&rsquo;s &ldquo;State of the Union,&rdquo; Birx said Trump&rsquo;s comment was part of a &ldquo;dialogue&rdquo; between the President and William Bryan, the acting head of science at the Department of Homeland Security, about new information. And she dodged a question from Tapper about whether she&rsquo;s bothered by having to spend time discussing the President&rsquo;s comments, instead criticizing &ldquo;the news cycle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re missing the bigger pieces of what we need to be doing as an American people to continue to protect one another and we should be having that dialogue about asymptomatics, we should be having that dialogue about this unique clotting that we&rsquo;re seeing,&rdquo; Birx said.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters the President&rsquo;s remarks were simply taken out of context.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Trump continued the debate, curiously quibbling with the fact that reporters had recounted his back-and-forth with Birx about the effect of heat, sun and light on the coronavirus, asserting that he was speaking to &ldquo;our Laboratory expert, not Deborah, about sunlight etc. &amp; Coronavirus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shortly before Trump&rsquo;s Thursday remarks, he had been briefed by Bryan, who had presented findings from a study about whether the spread of coronavirus could be slowed by warmer weather.</p>
<p>Bryan summarized the study in the briefing room, also discussing how ultraviolet rays and disinfectants, including bleach and alcohol, may shorten the life of the virus. (Bryan does not have a medical background and is not a scientist).</p>
<p>That seemed to carry Trump&rsquo;s train of thought toward the notion that disinfectant might be used inside the body: &ldquo;I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute. One minute. Is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning?&rdquo; Trump said Thursday during the briefing. &ldquo;Because you see it gets on the lungs and does a tremendous number on the lungs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McEnany pushed back on reporters&rsquo; questions Saturday over whether the White House was sending mixed messages about the context of the President&rsquo;s suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking a sarcastic comment and running with negative headlines is the definition of taking something out of context, so I believe those answers are very much in sync,&rdquo; she told reporters at the White House.</p>
<p>McEnany would not say whether the President plans to dial back his participation in the coronavirus task force briefings after his abrupt departure from the briefing room Friday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I leave that to the President,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s entirely his decision, but I believe the President is at his best when he&rsquo;s speaking directly to the American people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When asked why he did not take questions Friday, she noted that &ldquo;the President has taken questions for 49 briefings since the end of February.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This story has been updated with additional comments from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Dr. Deborah Birx on &ldquo;State of the Union.&rdquo;

<h3 id="in-deep-review-trump-v-intelligence--and-obama-v-the-people">In Deep review: Trump v intelligence – and Obama v the people</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d0ae2308ad78e9d9e2bf2698cb7060fbfe3919d/0_52_4500_2703/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=2b3a162df5d97ea1f8c7e5e5508d302b" alt="img">
The 2016 election left the US gaping at a brewing battle between the president-elect and the most senior members of the law enforcement and intelligence communities.</p>
<p>Front Row at the Trump Show review: Jonathan Karl&rsquo;s pre-pandemic warning Read more</p>
<p>Into the conflagration jumped Virgil, a pseudonymous contributor to Breitbart, who wrote of a “deep state” within the US government, bolstered by the mainstream media and a “galaxy of contractors, profiteers, supporters”, all purportedly intent on destroying Donald Trump.</p>
<p>His near-4,000 word essay appeared weeks before the FBI director, James Comey, briefed the president-elect about the Steele dossier, on 5 January 2017, before 11 January when Trump compared America’s intelligence agencies to Adolf Hitler’s Gestapo. For Trump and his minions, Virgil’s take became a touchstone.</p>
<p>Enter the New Yorker’s David Rohde. Under the subtitle “The FBI, the CIA, and the Truth About America’s ‘Deep State’”, the two-time Pulitzer-winner rejects the nomenclature of conspiracy theorists. In doing so he relies in part on Will Hurd, a moderate Republican congressman from Texas who served overseas with the CIA, opposed impeachment and is not seeking re-election.</p>
<p>Trump placing his hand on the shoulder of an FBI director and whispering into his ear is the stuff of Scorsese’s films</p>
<p>But Rohde does little to dispel the notion that government is riddled with entrenched interests, and that career officials can find themselves at odds with incumbent presidents and vice versa. In Rohde’s view, civil servants are part of “‘institutional government’”, a relatively benign term that masks turf fights, budget battles, policy skirmishes, built-in biases and well-formed points of view. The left has frequently derided the military industrial complex. Name-calling plays both ways.</p>
<p>Rohde acknowledges that “all countries have permanent governments”, but says the US imposes greater political control over its employees and the resultant process. Even so, campaign finance records reflect that the federal bureaucracy is not a Republican bastion.</p>
<p>Going back in time, in 2012 Internal Revenue Service employees donated to Barack Obama over Mitt Romney by a 4–1 ratio while lawyers at the National Labor Relations Board and the education department shut out Romney completely. In 2020, Joe Biden is outpacing Trump at the IRS and the justice department, as Hillary Clinton did in 2016.</p>
<p>Of course, who joins the federal government is not necessarily in sync with who prevails on election day. But the Trump presidency appears unique and disheartening. The fight between the president and law enforcement and intelligence was an avoidable consequence of Russia’s “active measures” in support of the Trump campaign, and a candidate all too willing to accept the sordid bounty.</p>
<p>“I love WikiLeaks” was bound to gain attention. And as Rohde makes clear, Trump has waged a persistent assault upon the rule of law, the ideal of a justice department removed from politics and the concept of an intelligence community loyal to the country rather than the man in the Oval Office.</p>
<p>A recent Senate intelligence committee report observed that the intelligence community has “present[ed] a coherent and well-constructed intelligence basis for the case of unprecedented Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election”. As Robert Mueller reminded us, absence of indictment was not akin to prosecutorial absolution, despite what the attorney general, William Barr, may have thought and said.</p>
<p>On that score, in an opinion issued last month Reggie Walton, a George W Bush appointee to the federal bench, “seriously” questioned Barr’s integrity and credibility, using words like “distorted” and “misleading” to drive the point home.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, all this is coming with a steep cost to our democracy and our post-Watergate system, which sought to make law enforcement something other than the handmaiden of the White House. Trump placing his hand on the shoulder of an FBI director and whispering into his ear is the stuff of Martin Scorsese’s films. “Lock her up” is chant befitting a democracy in decay – or worse.</p>
<p>In Deep also pays attention to the Trump administration’s privatization of foreign policy</p>
<p>Rohde, however, reminds us that Trump’s predecessor was by no means angelic when it came to encroachment on civil liberties, despite stints on the Harvard Law Review and as a professor of constitutional law at the University of Chicago. Under Obama the Pentagon regarded leaking non-classified information as “tantamount to aiding the enemies of the United States”.</p>
<p>Rohde recalls how the intelligence community under Obama spied on a Senate committee, misled Congress about spying on Americans and expanded the use of drone warfare. He offers granular detail on how James Clapper, Obama’s director of national intelligence, obfuscated before the Senate intelligence committee on data collection and surveillance of US citizens.</p>
<p>Years later, Clapper would accuse Trump and his administration of an “assault on truth” and posit that Trump might be a “witting or unwitting” Russian asset. Regardless of the validity of the charges, Rohde voices discomfort with intelligence community alumni playing an outsized role in clashes with the administration.</p>

<p>In Deep also pays attention to the Trump administration’s privatization of foreign policy. Among other things, Rohde describes at length how the efforts in Ukraine of Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, helped lead to Trump’s impeachment. Not surprisingly, Republican stalwarts have failed to thunder paroxysms of outrage over this dubious practice as they do over the supposed deep state.</p>
<p>Code Red and Politics Is For Power review: rallying calls for the battle to dump Trump Read more</p>
<p>As Rohde repeatedly reminds us, negative partisanship increasingly drives our politics. With social chasms underlying most of the divide, don’t expect it to disappear anytime soon. In our cold civil war, elections have morphed into safety valves and battlefields. Wisconsin’s potentially lethal conflict over mail-in ballots is just the latest reminder.</p>
<p>In assessing the existence of a deep state, or otherwise, it is worth remembering what Steve Bannon had to say about it – the same Steve Bannon who skippered Trump’s upset victory and signed Virgil’s paycheck back in his Breitbart days. As Bannon admitted to James Stewart of the New York Times, the “deep state conspiracy theory is for nut cases”, because “America isn’t Turkey or Egypt”.</p>
<p>True enough, but our freedom and trust continue to erode with no end in sight.

<h3 id="will-trump-fight-mcconnell-to-get-help-for-states">Will Trump fight McConnell to get help for states?</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200421161045-02-senate-floor-0421-mcconnell-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) Right after he agreed with Congress on the coronavirus relief package signed Friday, President Donald Trump was looking toward the next one : sending money to cash-strapped state and local governments.</p>
<p>Every news report about jam-packed hospitals, first responder casualties, and the scramble for test kits &ndash; let alone the images of quickly-emptying food banks and school meal sites, as the economic crisis deepens &ndash; makes the case. While state and local governments spend heavily to battle the virus, economic contraction strangles their revenues</p>
<p>Never mind that 26 of 50 state governors are themselves Republicans. Or that Larry Hogan, the Maryland Republican who chairs the National Governors Association, warns that states face &ldquo;drastic cuts to the programs we depend on to provide economic security, educational opportunities and public safety&rdquo; without $500 billion in aid from Washington.</p>
<p>Instead, McConnell suggests, states in need could declare bankruptcy &ndash; though that&rsquo;s not in fact the case. Even if that merely represents an initial bargaining position, his comments channel the interwoven objections of influential Republican constituencies.</p>
<p>Cut, cut, cut</p>
<p>Free-market ideologues see shrinking government as a central priority. Anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist famously framed that philosophy this way: &ldquo;I simply want to reduce (government) to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wealthy Republican donors disdain government as an unwelcome source of taxes and business regulations. They can purchase private alternatives to broad-based public services in realms such as education, health care and transportation.</p>
<p>Republicans in Congress see unionized government workers as hostile soldiers fighting against their reelection. Responsibility for financing the services those workers provide falls to governors and state legislators, not them.</p>
<p>The GOP infused those sentiments into the 2017 tax law that remains Trump&rsquo;s principal legislative achievement. It limited deductions for state and local levies from federal tax bills &ndash; which both punished taxpayers in blue states that provide more services and made it harder for those states to finance those services.</p>
<p>The wild card in this constellation of forces is the party&rsquo;s increasing dependence on working-class white voters. Republicans have long capitalized on their suspicion that many government programs benefit others, not them. Trump placed appeals to their racial resentments at the center of his 2016 campaign.</p>
<p>Republican voters like entitlement spending even if the party doesn&rsquo;t</p>
<p>Yet those voters support, and depend upon, the biggest government programs of all: Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. GOP donors and ideologues, who opposed the creation of those benefit programs in the 20th century, have not fully embraced them even in the 21st.</p>
<p>Candidate Donald Trump seized on the contradiction by promising voters he wouldn&rsquo;t cut benefits, though Republican leaders keep trying to persuade him to . Now Republican resistance to aiding states risks elevating a similar contradiction.</p>
<p>Many first responders on the front lines of the coronavirus fight are Republicans. So are many of the elderly and middle-aged Americans with health challenges most at risk from the virus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every con game has an expiration date,&rdquo; said Jack Pitney, a political scientist specializing in the GOP at Claremont McKenna College. He said the everyman persona of former Vice President Joe Biden , Trump&rsquo;s presumptive Democratic opponent in November, offers a chance to cast partisan Republican priorities as hostile to the interests of ordinary Americans.</p>
<p>Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, in biting terms, casts McConnell&rsquo;s resistance as ugly and un-American . On the basis of need, he noted, New York routinely contributes more than it takes from federal revenues while McConnell&rsquo;s Kentucky does the opposite.</p>
<p>Another congressional fight looms</p>
<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed for state and local aid to join small business relief as a fast-track priority in last week&rsquo;s $484 billion bill, but McConnell refused. Now she vows to pass it separately and dares the Senate to say no.</p>
<p>The national death toll from coronavirus dwarfs the number of lives lost in the September 11, 2001, terror attacks nearly two decades ago. As then-Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York recalled in a recent documentary, Republican President George W. Bush instantly agreed to her request for $20 billion in financial assistance for New York City.</p>
<p>In this &ldquo;historic tragedy,&rdquo; said Susan Molinari, a former Republican congresswoman from New York, governors generally have been &ldquo;very smart&rdquo; in fighting the virus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand&rdquo; how Washington can ultimately turn them down, she added.</p>
<p>His poll ratings sagging in key battlegrounds, Trump has a reelection incentive to protect states from near-term financial disaster. But for most of his term, the President has shown little willingness or ability to push Republican lawmakers where they don&rsquo;t want to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It depends on how hard Trump wants to push for this,&rdquo; Molinari said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
