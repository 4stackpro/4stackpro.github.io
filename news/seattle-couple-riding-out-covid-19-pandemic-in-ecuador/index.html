They had a few issues that ultimately made them decide it was safer to stay. First, it didn’t appear that the humanitarian flights would allow them to bring their dogs onboard. Second, they were 10 hours away from Quito, where the government was giving them advice to fly out of – with a curfew in place between the hours of 2 p.m. 5 a.m. it didn’t seem like it was worth the risk to the Edwards.

<h3 id="a-mothers-crisis-flying-daughter-to-sf-from-ecuador-during-coronavirus-pandemic">A mother’s crisis: Flying daughter to SF from Ecuador during coronavirus pandemic</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/11/25/17/19223533/7/rawImage.jpg" alt="img">
The hardest part of the ordeal came when it was all over.</p>
<p>When I saw my daughter standing by baggage claim at SFO.</p>
<p>And we could only wave to each other. From a 6-foot distance. We both knew hugging was a bad idea.</p>
<p>Times of crisis are hard on everyone, but particularly hard on parents whose children are far away. These are the moments when our hearts hurt, when all a mother wants to do is wrap her arms around her child, no matter how old or independent that child may be.</p>
<p>My 25-year-old daughter lives in Quito, Ecuador, where she teaches English. Kaitlin is in the second year of a two-year teaching contract. Living in a foreign country has taught her independence and resourcefulness. How to handle what the world throws her way.</p>
<p>But the world had never thrown anything like this before. Not at her. Not at me.</p>
<p>Over the past several weeks, as the coronavirus crisis mounted here in the United States, my concern about having my youngest child in a foreign country grew. I was far from alone, as parents around the globe have scrambled to get their children home.</p>
<p>Kaitlin was adamant that she didn’t need to come home. She was teaching online, sheltering in place in her apartment in central Quito. Because she was not in any U.S. government program, but employed independently, she didn’t receive direct instructions to return to the United States. Just the increasingly worried queries from her mother.</p>
<p>She had already experienced lockdown and curfew during the anti-government protests in Ecuador last fall. She was, in truth, more experienced in such draconian measures than I am, as she was quick to point out. She followed the news from the United States and was appalled at the lack of coordination and urgency of the American response. She felt she might be safer in Ecuador.</p>
<p>But she was isolated — her roommate had moved out to live with a boyfriend. Ecuador had a few confirmed cases, and the numbers were growing. Many experts have predicted that the coronavirus could sweep through densely packed South American cities, where the poorest communities are crowded and often lack basic sanitation. Though Kaitlin resisted my pleas, I grew more convinced that being a young American woman in South America might not be ideal if the situation worsened, if resources became scarce, if the economic system collapsed.</p>
<p>To her, it all sounded far-fetched. It would have sounded that way to me, too, back in February.</p>
<p>Then on March 16, the crisis escalated. I was told to shelter in place. The state department told Americans to come home. Ecuador closed its borders, even to Ecuadoran citizens trying to return. There were stories of Americans stranded around the globe, including in neighboring Peru. I looked again for flights out of Quito. The first one I could find was on May 5. I bought it.</p>
<p>The mother of one of Kaitlin’s co-workers — a young woman named Beatrice from Seattle who had ended up in Quito through her college connection with my daughter at Tulane — reached out to me. Beth and I shared our concerns, our mothers’ anxiety. Beth learned that no flights had left Quito for the States since the first week of March. That was particularly alarming. Had we completely missed our window to get them home?</p>
<p>The embassy didn’t answer calls. Response to our emails was unhelpful and with several days’ lag time. There was a mysterious charter flight out of Guayaquil, an eight-hour bus ride away. My ability to sleep decreased every night.</p>
<p>Then on Sunday night, Kaitlin texted me that a friend found a flight out on Tuesday night. Kaitlin’s revelation was a clear indication of a change in her thinking: It was time to leave.</p>
<p>I contacted Beth in Seattle, found a United flight to Houston that hadn’t existed a day before and bought two tickets for Kaitlin and Beatrice. The flight would leave at 12:35 a.m. on Tuesday the 24th. As I pushed the “purchase” button I realized what a privileged situation I was in, able to buy a $1,000 one-way flight home for my daughter.</p>
<p>When I talked to Kaitlin on Monday morning, she was stressed. She was online-teaching 40 6-year-olds through Zoom, the video-conferencing app. She was trying to pack up her entire apartment, not knowing when she would return. She didn’t know how they would get to the airport, as a curfew was in place and only a few companies were able to provide transportation. And then we received an email alert: The flight would be delayed 16 hours due to a mechanical issue.</p>
<p>For anyone who flies frequently, those are troubling words. My heart sank.</p>
<p>In truth, the delay was a blessing. Both Kaitlin and her co-workers were able to take a deep breath and get organized. They were able to go to the airport long before curfew. She said the scene leaving Quito was apocalyptic: no one on the streets, no cars on the road. Just a helicopter circling overhead. Kaitlin’s phone wasn’t working, but Beatrice told Beth each step of their journey and Beth relayed the information to me by text.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the airport, a line of about 200 people — virtually all Americans — stretched outside, with everyone told to space out. Only 30 people were allowed inside at a time. Before entering the airport, passengers showed their passports and flight confirmations, were told to wear a mask, then had their hands sanitized.</p>
<p>Inside, the airport was empty. Only two other flights were leaving — one to Santiago, Chile, and one to Mexico. Kaitlin and Beatrice checked their bags and, as they entered the security line, had their temperatures taken.</p>
<p>In the boarding area, everyone was speaking English. Kaitlin felt like she was almost home. A snack counter sold beer, but water fountains were roped off. A large group of older Americans who had come from the Galapagos Islands were on the flight, as were several families. Passengers wiped down their tray tables and arm rests. All the passengers wore masks, but not the U.S.-based flight attendants, who seemed bemused by the precaution. When the plane took off everyone clapped.</p>
<p>When they landed in Houston (to more applause) on Tuesday evening, Kaitlin was shocked to see all restaurants and stores open. To see workers without any protective equipment. To see the United States acting as though it was business as usual.</p>
<p>“Whoa,” she thought, “does America know what’s happening?”</p>
<p>Since no flights were departing for San Francisco until morning, I had booked a hotel room to keep our daughters from having to sleep in the airport. Again, I was well aware I was exercising a privilege many don’t have.</p>
<p>Kaitlin and I had a hard time connecting because of a Wi-Fi issue in the hotel, so, again, I had to receive updates from Beth. I burst into tears of frustration — and pent-up emotion. I had been holding it in for weeks.</p>
<p>With flights severely restricted, the fastest way to get Kaitlin back to San Francisco on Wednesday was with a connecting flight through Denver. So she took a total of three flights, increasing her possible exposure with each one, particularly with so few Americans taking precautions. At the gate in Denver, she heard young men joking about the “Chinese” virus, saying to each other, “do you have that Wuhan?” She bit her tongue.</p>
<p>Only upon landing at SFO did it appear that some of the United States was aware of the dangers. Stores and restaurants were closed. Workers wore protective gear.</p>
<p>I parked in a virtually empty garage, put on a mask and gloves, and met her at baggage claim. The relief was overwhelming.</p>
<p>Now we are living together, at a distance. We are staying 6 feet apart. We eat dinner at opposite ends of a long dining table, like estranged spouses in a drawing-room comedy. She teaches online in her bedroom. I work in the kitchen. We FaceTime with her brother — he in Portland, Kaitlin in her bedroom, me in the kitchen. We wipe down everything — even the yellow Labrador.</p>
<p>It’s going to be this way for the better part of two weeks. But we have to be smart. I have asthma. She knows she might have been exposed.</p>
<p>But when it’s over, she’s knows what’s coming. A very big, very long, very tight hug.</p>

<p>QUITO, March 30 (Xinhua) &ndash; The death toll from COVID-19 in Ecuador has climbed to 60, with a total of 1,962 people testing positive for the disease, Deputy Health Minister Ernesto Carrasco said on Monday.</p>
<p>In recent hours, two more patients died and 38 new infections were detected, Carrasco said on a state-run television network, adding 23 of the country&rsquo;s 24 provinces have reported cases of infection.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the cases, or 71.15 percent, are centered in southwest Guayas province, which has 1,396 COVID-19 patients, and most of those, or 978, were reported in the regional capital Guayaquil, the country&rsquo;s second-largest city with 2.7 million inhabitants.</p>
<p>Ecuador &ldquo;has secured a good supply of quick tests (for COVID-19) that are due to arrive this week,&rdquo; and will be used initially to test priority sectors, such as medical workers and security forces on the frontlines of the fight against the epidemic, said Carrasco.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Maria Paula Romo said Ecuador&rsquo;s emergency committee has decided to extend the suspension of in-office work for both public- and private-sector employees from the original March 31 deadline to April 5.</p>
<p>The measure was one of many that Ecuador has announced to try to contain the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>The committee will also assess what &ldquo;mechanisms are needed so that basic services can continue to function,&rdquo; said Romo.
