<p>However, Jaya Bachchan always grabbed the limelight for her romance with Amitabh Bachchan too. Their love blossomed on the sets of Ek Nazar. In a chat show, Amitabh Bachchan revealed the had taken a good look at Jaya Bhaduri (then) on the cover of a magazine.. He also said that the one thing which really caught his attention were her beautiful eyes.</p>
<p>Amitabh Bachchan got the first hit of his career, Zanjeer (1973) opposite her. That was the film which put him on the road to superstardom. Here are some of the most romantic pictures of this timeless couple, as we celebrate Jaya Bachchan&rsquo;s birthday today. Have a look.</p>
<p>Jaya Bachchan&rsquo;s impeccable talent slalomed her to the top of the Bollywood eco system. Making her film debut as a teenager in Mahanagar (1963), Jaya Bachchan who turns 72 today, gave Hindi cinema several memorable characters over the years. In an era when glamour was the byword for success at the box office, her girl-next-door looks won the day for her. An actress par excellence, she gave us scintillating performances in movies like Guddi, Abhimaan, Chupke Chupke, Mili, Koshish, Sholay, Silsila,.. And many more.

<p>Shatrughan Sinha worked with Jaya Bachchan in just two films, Gaai Aur Gori (1973) and Nauker (1979). Years later, both the actors stepped into politics with two opposing parties, Bhartiya Janata Party and Samajwadi Party, respectively. In 2019, Shatrughan joined Congress.</p>
<p>Shatrughan mostly worked with Jaya&rsquo;s husband Amitabh Bachchan in several movies. They shared screen space in films like Bombay To Goa, Parwana, Dostana, Ameer Aadmi Ghareeb Aadmi, Yaar Meri Zindagi, Naseeb, Kala Patthar and Shaan.</p>
<p>Jaya Bachchan is currently in New Delhi amid the lockdown and her family is staying in Mumbai.</p>
<p>Jaya&rsquo;s birthday turned special as Abhishek Bachchan and Shweta Bachchan wished her a happy birthday on social media.</p>
<p>Later, Amitabh and Jaya thanked their fans for all the birthday wishes on Twitter. As Jaya is not on social media, Big B did the same on her behalf.</p>

<h3 id="fashion-friday-when-jaya-bachchan-donned-a-glamorous-avatar-in-jawani-diwani">Fashion Friday: When Jaya Bachchan donned a glamorous avatar in Jawani Diwani</h3>
<p><img src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202004/jaya_bachchan_fashion_friday_0-647x363.jpeg?SDtI53SmAwl1f0jMyWMbcFZFT7vSes6M" alt="img">
Classic sarees and suits have been Jaya Bachchan&rsquo;s sartorial staples - in real, as well as reel life. The veteran actress, who turned 72 yesterday (April 9), has hardly ever been seen in anything other than ethnics. But there is a movie in which she oozed glamour in Western wear. We are talking about 1972-released Jawani Diwani.</p>
<p>The film, best remembered for its evergreen songs like Saamne Ye Kaun Aaya and Jaane Jaan Dhoondta Phir Raha, had Randhir Kapoor and Jaya Bachchan playing the role of college students. But apart from the songs, the film is also memorable for how it had Jaya Bachchan donning a glamorous avatar.</p>
<p>Even though sarees dominated her wardrobe in this film too, her Western ensembles did make noise and left everyone impressed back then. So, in this week&rsquo;s Fashion Friday, we take you back to Jawani Diwani and give you a glimpse of birthday girl Jaya Bachchan&rsquo;s unforgettable looks.</p>
<p>The first scene of the film, picturised on Jaya Bachchan shows her dressed in a white top with voguish balloon sleeves. Yes, the same balloon sleeves that are quite a rage at present as well.</p>
<p>A closer look and you will notice she is also wearing a pair of hoop earrings and slaying a perfectly winged eyeliner.</p>
<p>The next one is among the most iconic looks that Jaya Bachchan has ever donned on screen. A crisp bright-hued shirt paired with white denim pants and completed with a studded belt - a party-perfect look that is sure to win you oodles of gazes even today if you replicate it. A pendant, statement ring, middle-parted tresses and a delicate wristwatch perfectly rounded off her outfit. In the film, Jaya goes to a club wearing this attire and the song Samne Ye Kaun Aaya happens. This look was even chosen for the movie posters.</p>
<p>In another scene, we see Jaya Bachchan dressed in orange pants teamed with a flowy top with a bow detailing. With her hair blow-dried with utmost perfection, this look served some major goals. In fact, we would say, it was equal parts voguish and elegant.</p>
<p>Clad in a beauteous white long dress, Jaya looked like a vision to behold in a romantic scene in the film. Her dress again came with voguish elements like puffed sleeves and a boat neckline. A pair of hoop earrings and a pretty hairdo added charm to her look.</p>
<p>Which look did you like the most?</p>
