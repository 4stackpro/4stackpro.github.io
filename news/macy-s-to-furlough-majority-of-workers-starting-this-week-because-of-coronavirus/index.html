Retail giant Macy&rsquo;s said it will furlough a &ldquo;majority&rdquo; of employees as companies continue to navigate how to operate during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>In a statement Monday, Macy&rsquo;s said &ldquo;the majority of our colleagues&rdquo; will go on furlough starting this week. As of its 2019 fourth quarter, Macy&rsquo;s had 125,000 employees and 775 stores nationwide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the digital business remains open, we have lost the majority of our sales due to the store closures,&rdquo; said Macy&rsquo;s in its statement.</p>
<p>Macy&rsquo;s closed all stores nationwide on March 18, joining other retailers in shutting down physical locations to curb the spread of the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>Macy&rsquo;s says furloughed workers enrolled in health benefits will continue to receive coverage at least through May.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We’ve already taken measures to maintain financial flexibility, including suspending the dividend, drawing down our line of credit, freezing both hiring and spending, stopping capital spend, reducing receipts, cancelling some orders and extending payment terms, and we are evaluating all other financing options,&rdquo; said Macy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The retailer joins several companies announcing furloughs to help mitigate the financial impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. Last week, The Cheesecake Factory said it would furlough 41,000 hourly workers and cut executive pay. Meanwhile, hotel giants Hilton, Hyatt and Marriott have all announced employee furloughs.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, the US Labor Department said a record 3.3 million unemployment claims were made the week before.</p>

EMERGENCY measures have been put in place for workers in the fight against coronavirus , including covering the wages of millions.</p>
<p>The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak said the Government will cover 80 per cent to those who have been furloughed - but what exactly does that mean?</p>

<p>What are furloughed workers?</p>
<p>Furloughed workers are those who are unable to work due to the coronavirus pandemic because their places of work have been forced to close.</p>
<p>They are not people who have been made redundant.</p>
<p>Their employers are now able to access support to continue paying part of their staff&rsquo;s wages, to avoid redundancies.</p>
<p>Mr Sunak has promised to pay up to £2,500 per month in salaries to those who are unable to work as part of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.</p>

<p>What is furloughed leave?</p>
<p>Employers who wish to access the job retention scheme should speak with their employees about classifying them as a furloughed worker.</p>
<p>This would mean that employees are kept on the payroll, rather than being laid off.</p>
<p>According to the Government, furloughed staff should not undertake any work for their employer during the scheme.</p>
<p>This allows employers to claim up to 80 per cent of wages - with a limit of £2,500 per month.</p>
<p>The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy says: “To qualify for this scheme, you should not undertake work for them while you are furloughed.</p>
<p>“This will allow your employer to claim a grant of up to 80 per cent of your wage for all employment costs, up to a cap of £2,500 per month.</p>
<p>“You will remain employed while furloughed. Your employer could choose to fund the differences between this payment and your salary, but does not have to.</p>
<p>“If your salary is reduced as a result of these changes, you may be eligible for support through the welfare system, including Universal Credit.</p>
<p>“We intend for the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme to run for at least 3 months from 1 March 2020, but will extend if necessary.”</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Who can be furloughed and how do I claim my pay from the Government?</p>
<p>Any UK employer can apply for the furlough scheme, including business, charities, recruitment agencies and public authorities.</p>
<p>However the Government does not envisage making significant payouts to public sector employees as they believe most will continue offering essential services.</p>
<p>Where employers are receiving public funding for staff costs, they will be expected to continue using these funds to pay staff rather than applying for the furlough scheme.</p>

<p>If you are working at reduced hours and pay, you will not be eligible for furlough and it will be up to your employer to pay you as normal.</p>
<p>You must have created and started a PAYE payroll scheme on or before February 28, 2020 and have a UK bank account.</p>
<p>To access the scheme, your employer must comply with the following:</p>
<p>Designate employees who cannot do their jobs due to the coronavirus measures put in place by the Government</p>
<p>Notify those employees of their new &ldquo;furloughed&rdquo; status</p>
<p>Submit information to HMRC about furloughed employees to set up a system for reimbursement and existing systems that will facilitate payments.</p>

<p>Can I take another job while on furlough?</p>
<p>The Government does not prevent workers from taking on other jobs while on furlough.</p>
<p>However, you should speak to your employer first as you are still technically working for them.</p>
<p>Some contracts may prohibit employees from taking up other work, but be subject to negotiation.</p>
<p>Have easyJet workers been furloughed?</p>
<p>easyJet has grounded its entire fleet for two months, meaning the cabin crew has been furloughed.</p>
<p>Four thousand of the company&rsquo;s nine thousand UK workers are now on furlough leave.</p>
<p>From April 1, these staff will not work but will be able to claim 80 per cent of their regular pay from the government.

<h3 id="treasury-irons-out-finer-details-of-covid-19-furlough-scheme">Treasury irons out finer details of COVID-19 furlough scheme</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.contractoruk.com/sites/default/files/socialmedia-thumbnail.jpg" alt="img">
The finer details of how the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme will work are being ironed out – albeit not quite as fast as ContractorUK readers are submitting questions about it.</p>
<p>Perhaps most helpfully for limited company directors, the Treasury has confirmed that such directors who owner-manage an incorporated business can furlough themselves under CJRS.</p>
<p>“[Such a status and position] does not disqualify them from being furloughed so long as they are on PAYE, payroll,” Ben Kerry, head of labour markets at HMT said in a CBI webinar.</p>
<p>“They will have some statutory duties and obligations such as filling out their accounts, but they are still allowed to undertake their statutory duties while they are being furloughed.</p>
<p>“So that would not count as doing work…[which is key because] one of the key conditions of the furlough scheme is that the employee is not allowed to work for the employer.”</p>
<p>&lsquo;PSC bosses to be furloughed as employees, not directors&rsquo;</p>
<p>But ReLegal Consulting is cautious, because it noticed the government has revised its wording, saying PSCs “may” be able to get JRS support, from PSCs ‘could’ get the support.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the firm now echoes HMT’s stance, saying: “A director’s role as an officeholder is separate and distinct to the role as an employee, even if the individual fulfils both roles.</p>
<p>“So if the individual is an employee of their limited company, then they would be furloughed as an employee, not a director.”</p>
<p>&lsquo;Furloughed staff of one employer, can still work for a second&rsquo;</p>
<p>While the scheme is seen as restrictive for PSCs (it covers only the salary, not dividends of those on PAYE from Feb 28), it appears to offer options to agency or umbrella workers.</p>
<p>“Employees are not permitted to provide any work for their employer, including providing services or generating revenue,” began Fieldfisher in a bulletin sent to ContractorUK.</p>
<p>“However, employees placed on furlough by one employer can provide work for a different employer if they choose and subject to the terms of their employment contracts.”</p>
<p>&lsquo;Workers can complete training during the furlough&rsquo;</p>
<p>Similarly, despite the condition of not working during the furlough, “employees may volunteer or complete training while furloughed,” the law firm says.</p>
<p>Further interpreting the official CJRS guidance, the firm’s employment head Ranjit Dhindsa says individuals on agency PAYE should be furloughed by the agency, not the end-client.</p>
<p>This question of who provides the furlough has been answered differently by Money Saving Expert’s Martin Lewis, who took to Twitter with advice for umbrella and agency users.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Push that company&rsquo;</p>
<p>“The problem is, I know many agencies and many umbrella workers and many freelance workers are….[asking] ‘Well ,who do I ask?’</p>
<p>“Well, if you’re a freelancer who worked for lots of different people in February, go to all of them &ndash; they can all furlough you based on that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a v-log, Lewis added: “If you work for one firm, it’s who you worked for in February that counts. If you’re an agency worker or in an umbrella company, push that company, it can furlough you.”</p>
<p>&lsquo;HMRC working through the night&rsquo;</p>
<p>However HMRC is still “working through the night to get the portal” for claims under the CJRS “up and running,” said HMT’s Mr Kerry, speaking on Friday.</p>
<p>His expectation is that the HMRC portal (which will be for employers to use given that the scheme is a reimbursement between state and employer), will be live by “mid-to-late April.”</p>
<p>Mr Kerry added: “The key thing is having a PAYE reference number because what’s critical is that the only employees eligible for the scheme are individuals on PAYE, so you need to have that reference number.</p>
<p>“And then you also should have the number of employees being furloughed; the claimed periods; the amount claimed and bank account and sort code details for a UK bank account ; contact name and phone number.”</p>
<p>&lsquo;Back on board after the first three-week furlough&rsquo;</p>
<p>Referring to the same new guidance which the Treasury official urged would-be claimants to read (which includes How To Apply), employment law firm Chartergates said employers were not going to be forced to retain workers after the furlough.</p>
<p>On the other hand, clarified Mr Kerry in the webinar, “you can furlough someone for three weeks and then you can bring them back on board.</p>
<p>“And then if you decide with that individual that they need to be furloughed again, then you can have another three-week period, so long as the scheme is continuing to run during that period.”</p>
<p>&lsquo;Devil in the detail&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another sympathetic move could be that if an otherwise eligible PAYE worker was made redundant before Feb 28th (eligibility begins on and after the date), the employer could rehire them to take advantage of the scheme, advised Mr Dhindsa.</p>
<p>But as to the scheme’s other criteria, the employment lawyer cautions that since HMRC will be auditing the scheme in due course, employers “should consider how they will ensure that employees do not continue to work and be able to demonstrate that they have not done so during furlough.”</p>
<p>He added: “The devil is in the detail and despite efforts to break it down, it still is quite complex so employers should seek advice to ensure they&rsquo;re making full use of all the support out there to secure their workforce.”</p>
<p>&lsquo;Six-fold support for self-employed&rsquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, asked before both the CJRS and the corresponding SEISS (Self-Employed Income Support Scheme) were unveiled about what support during the COVID-19 outbreak is available for people who run their own business, a spokesperson for HMRC sent a statement listing six measures:</p>
<p>Extension of Statutory Sick Pay to self-isolaters and those in the same household caring for self-isolaters &ndash; payable from day 1 not day 4. Contributory Employment and Support Allowance will be now be available from Day 1 not Day 8 for eligible people unable to work because they are directly affected by COVID-19 or self-isolating. Advances for all new Universal Credit claimants are now available online / via phone, with no requirement to attend a job centre. Earnings rules for self-employed UC claimants have already been temporarily relaxed for those who are sick or self-isolating. Mortgage lenders will offer mortgage holidays of three months Forbearance from lenders, where individuals are having difficulty paying back personal loans or credit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;PSC bosses to get more info&rsquo;</p>
<p>Speaking this morning to ContractorUK, the HMRC spokesman also said: &ldquo;The CJRS is for anyone operating a PAYE scheme, so people in umbrella schemes, getting paid through PAYE, can be furloughed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In line with an expert&rsquo;s recommendation today for contractors to keep a close eye on support materials, the Revenue spokesman added: &ldquo;We should have some more guidance coming soon for company directors.&rdquo;
