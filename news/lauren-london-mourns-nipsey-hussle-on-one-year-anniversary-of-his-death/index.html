<p>&lsquo;Time is deceptive, It’s been a year since you transitioned. The pain is as heavy today as it was a year ago. God knows I would give anything to see you again. I didn&rsquo;t think I was going to survive a second of any of this.&rsquo; the mother-of-two wrote.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Prayers have kept me together. The kids keep me going and Gods Grace and Mercy have carried me this far. As today makes a year I stand strong because of you. Because I know you wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because I recall every late night conversation we had about resilience and fear. Because you were my greatest teacher and because you are still with us, in spirit.&rsquo;</p>
