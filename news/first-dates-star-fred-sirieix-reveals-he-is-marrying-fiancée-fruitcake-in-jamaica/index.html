Fred Sirieix has revealed his wedding will take place in Jamaica, with close friend Gino D&rsquo;Acampo handling his stag do and eclectic wedding menu.</p>
<p>The First Dates maître d announced his engagement to his long-term girlfriend, whose name has never been made public but is affectionately referred to as &lsquo;Fruitcake&rsquo;, in a social media post on March 18.</p>
<p>And appearing from home on Thursday&rsquo;s edition of This Morning, Fred, 48, revealed they will exchange vows on the idyllic island when the global threat of coronavirus COVID-19 has passed.</p>
<p>Big plans: Appearing from home on Thursday&rsquo;s edition of This Morning, First Dates star Fred Sirieix revealed his wedding to long term girlfriend &lsquo;Fruitcake&rsquo; will take place in Jamaica</p>
<p>But he admits that when it does finally happen it will be old friend Gino - with whom he features alongside Gordon Ramsay in a new series of Gordon, Gino &amp; Fred: American Road Trip - who handles the catering after they came to a recent agreement.</p>
<p>He told hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield: &lsquo;Gino has said to me that he wants to organise my stag do and I said, &ldquo;Okay, on one condition. This is the first episode we do when we get out of lockdown.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;And the one condition is that you will cook at my wedding in Jamaica. We’re going to do a Jamaican, French and Italian feast&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Opening up: Speaking to hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield, Fred admitted his old friend Gino D&rsquo;Acampo will handle the stag do and wedding menu</p>
<p>Cute! Fred revealed he is engaged to his girlfriend of two years on March 18</p>
<p>Nailed down: Fred admits he acquired Gino&rsquo;s services after coming to an agreement when the Italian chef asked to organise his stag do (pictured: Gordon Ramsay, Gino D&rsquo;Acampo and Fred Sirieux in Gordon, Gino &amp; Fred: American Road Trip)</p>
<p>Offering Holly and Phil and invite to his Caribbean wedding, the TV personality added: &lsquo;We’re going to have a party of a lifetime.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Fred posted the announcement and a loved-up selfie of himself and his fiancée on his Instagram page on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>Alongside the snap, Fred wrote: &lsquo;#fruitcake said yes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The First Dates star previously revealed he had begun dating his now wife-to-be - who he affectionately calls &lsquo;fruitcake&rsquo; - in January 2018.</p>
<p>The pair met after passing each other on the street, and reflecting on their initial encounter Fred admitted it as love at first sight, telling Holly and Phil: &lsquo;It was a very beautiful first meeting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Love: The First Dates host posted the announcement and a loved-up selfie of himself and his fiancée - who he affectionately refers to as &lsquo;fruitcake - on Instagram</p>
<p>Congratulatory messages from friends and co-stars flooded in after Fred confirmed his engagement two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Cici Coleman, who works as waitress on the hit dating show, was quick to offer her well-wishes and said: &lsquo;Awww Fred!!!!! So so happy for you both.&rsquo;</p>
<p>TOWIE star Pete Wicks, who checked into the First Dates Hotel last year in the hope of finding love, said: &lsquo;Yes my man! Congrats!&rsquo;</p>
<p>British track and field athlete Greg Rutherford commented: &lsquo;Congratulations mate! You guys are amazing. Well done x.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While Heavyweight boxer Dillian Whyte posted: &lsquo;Cangrats pal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Congrats! Congratulatory messages from his friends and co-stars flooded into the comments section of his romantic post</p>
<p>Fred keeps his love life largely under wraps and only occasionally shares snaps of himself and his lady love on social media during romantic getaways.</p>
<p>In January 2018, Fred revealed he had begun dating his now fiancée with a post on his Instagram page.</p>
<p>Speaking to Fabulous magazine at the time, he revealed: &lsquo;Occasionally, I&rsquo;ll go for a little wine and some tapas after work with my partner, who I like to call &lsquo;fruitcake&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Private: Fred keeps his love life largely under wraps and only occasionally shares snaps of himself and his partner on social media during romantic getaways</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s nice to have a relaxing conversation and chill out when you&rsquo;ve had a long day. If I do get the chance to be in the kitchen, I love making fresh pasta. I find rolling it out very therapeutic and I get flour everywhere; it&rsquo;s great fun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the evenings I like nothing more than sitting down with a beer and watching something on Netflix.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This will be Fred&rsquo;s first marriage as he revealed in 2016 that he has never been wed, admitting his longest relationship was with his ex Alex for 12 years.</p>
<p>The former couple share two children, Andrea, 15, and Lucien, 10.</p>
<p>Glam: Fred always refers to his other half as &lsquo;fruitcake&rsquo; on his social media pages</p>
<p>After finding his own happily ever after, Fred is set to launch a new dating show on E4 called Teen First Dates, following the succcess of the original show.</p>
<p>The show will feature gay, straight, bi and trans teenagers who are on the hunt for their other half.</p>
<p>It was revealed by the Sun earlier this month that the production team want all sexualities and body types to feature on their new show.</p>
<p>A source said: &lsquo;While Love Island was criticised for casting slim, good-looking singletons, Teen First Dates will give everyone the chance to find love — regardless of shape, size and sexuality.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As the contestants are more inexperienced, crew are keen to be gentle with them and are expecting a lot of nerves, especially as some won&rsquo;t have been on a date before.&rsquo;

FRED Sirieix recognisable maître d’ in the country thanks to his role as a matchmaker on Channel 4&rsquo;s First Dates.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s everything you need to know about the suave Frenchmen, who charmed the nation with his accent.</p>
<p>3 Fred is the much-loved maître d’ in the First Dates restaurant Credit: Channel 4</p>
<p>Who is Fred Sirieix and what is his background?</p>
<p>French-born Fred is best known as the loveable maître d’ on the hit Channel 4 show First Dates.</p>
<p>The 48-year-old was born and brought up in Limoges in western France and from an early age decided he wanted to work in the service industry.</p>
<p>He attended catering college and initially trained as a chef but decided to focus on being front of the house instead.</p>
<p>Fred trained as a maître d’ in France before moving to London.</p>
<p>Fred then worked at La Tante Claire in Chelsea and also spent time at Le Gavroche in Mayfair, Satario and Brasserie Roux.</p>
<p>As well as being the much-loved maître d’ in the First Dates restaurant, he is the general manager at Galvin at Windows - a Michelin-starred French haute cuisine restaurant located on the 28th floor of the London Hilton on Park Lane.</p>
<p>He also hosts BBC&rsquo;s Million Pound Menu, which sees contestants competing to win an investment.</p>
<p>3 Fred’s awards include Best Front of House at the Tatler Awards and Hotel Restaurant Team of the Year in 2007 Credit: PA:Press Association</p>
<p>Is Fred Sirieix married?</p>
<p>Despite being very private about his love life, Fred did open up about questions concerning whether he is in a committed relationship or not.</p>
<p>In July 2016, the French native revealed he had never been married before, adding that the closest thing to marriage had been his 12-year-old relationship with the mother of his two children, who is simply known as Alex to the public.</p>
<p>In January 2018, Alex took to his social media account to reveal he was in a new relationship with a woman he had nicknamed Fruitcake.</p>
<p>The couple got engaged in March 2020.</p>
<p>How did Fred Sirieix become famous?</p>
<p>Fred saw his profile rise after first appearing on First Dates in 2013 during the first series.</p>
<p>On the show, Fred greets the nervous daters as they turn up at the First Dates restaurant for a blind date.</p>
<p>He is often seen showing singletons to the bar and to their tables and even offers his pearls of wisdom to some of those who are unlucky in love.</p>
<p>Since then, the BAFTA-winning show – which is filmed in London’s Paternoster Chop House – has had a huge boost in both popularly and ratings.</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t the first time that Fred has graced our screens.</p>
<p>He co-hosted BBC2 show Michel Roux&rsquo;s Service and in 2012, he appeared on an episode of The Apprentice on BBC1.</p>
<p>And he has even dabbled in music and once made a dance track called La Vie Continue (Life Goes On) – a song about “love, loss and everything in between”.</p>
<p>3 Fred is now set to take part in Gino, Gordon and Fred: Road Trip Credit: Getty Images - WireImage</p>
<p>Does Fred really work in the First Dates restaurant?</p>
<p>Fred doesn&rsquo;t work in the restaurant; he is actually a General Manager at Galvin at Windows.</p>
<p>This particular restaurant is located at the Hilton Park Lane in Mayfair, where the businessman is known to spend the majority of his time when he&rsquo;s not filming for the show.</p>
<p>Galvin at Windows is also known to be much pricier than Paternoster Chop House.</p>

Fred Sirieix, the smooth-talking maître d’ on the television show First Dates, is musing on how many relationships end in separation and divorce. He is speaking from experience, having split with the mother of his two children in 2016. “But you can find love that’s even more beautiful and meaningful, where you think, ‘Oh my God, this is just what I’m looking for,’” he says, his Gallic passion firing up. “With my Fruitcake I can be a man, and I love to be a man. You understand?”</p>
<p>Fruitcake is Sirieix’s nickname for his new fiancée. He says: “Fruitcake is Fruitcake; Fred is Fred. I can be me and she can be her. It’s a privilege: it’s something to be grateful for.” Every morning he
