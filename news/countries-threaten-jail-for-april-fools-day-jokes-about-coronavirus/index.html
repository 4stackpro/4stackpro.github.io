From Thailand to India, countries have told people not to make April Fools&rsquo; Day pranks related to coronavirus, with some threatening jail time as they seek to prevent the spread of rumors which could put lives at risk.</p>
<p>Tech giant Google, which is famous for its annual spoofs, has cancelled the tradition because of the pandemic, which has killed about 40,000 people worldwide.</p>
<p>Thailand said on Tuesday that April Fool&rsquo;s Day jokes about the virus could be punished under a law carrying a sentence of up to five years in prison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s against the law to fake having COVID-19 this April Fools&rsquo; Day,&rdquo; the government said on Twitter.</p>
<p>Taiwan&rsquo;s President Tsai Ing-wen took to Facebook to tell people not to prank about the virus, adding that anyone spreading rumors or false information could face up to three years in jail and/or a fine of up to NT$3 million (US$99,200).</p>
<p>In India, Maharashtra state&rsquo;s cyber security unit said it would take legal action against anyone spreading fake news on April Fools&rsquo; Day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The state govt won&rsquo;t allow anyone to spread rumors/panic on #Corona,&rdquo; Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh tweeted, adding that he had instructed the authorities to &ldquo;act swiftly &amp; strongly [against] such miscreants&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Under the heading &ldquo;Corona is no joke&rdquo;, Germany&rsquo;s health ministry also urged the public not to make up stories related to the virus.</p>
<p>With people relying on the internet and media for vital information about coronavirus, there are fears that jokes could fan the spread of misinformation.</p>
<p>From drinking cow urine to sleeping by chopped onions, myths about how people can catch and cure COVID-19 are already widely circulating.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has described it as an &ldquo;infodemic&rdquo;, which could increase the spread of the virus among vulnerable people.</p>
<p>Google said it had suspended its annual April Fools&rsquo; tradition &ldquo;out of respect for all those fighting the COVID-19 pandemic&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our highest goal right now is to be helpful to people, so let&rsquo;s save the jokes for next April, which will undoubtedly be a whole lot brighter than this one,&rdquo; it said in an internal email to staff.</p>
<p>In previous years Google has advertised fictitious jobs at a new research center on the moon, turned Google Maps into a game of Where&rsquo;s Waldo - also known as Where&rsquo;s Wally - and claimed its search technology uses trained pigeons to rank pages.</p>
<p>Taylor Herring, a British PR agency whose clients include TV channels and international brands, advised all companies to ditch the jokes this year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tip for any brands planning an April Fool&rsquo;s Day stunt. Just. Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; it said on social media.</p>
<p>Others commented on twitter that April Fools&rsquo; Day had been cancelled because no one could make up anything more unbelievable than what is currently happening in the world.</p>

<h3 id="dont-even-think-about-doing-an-april-fools-day-joke">Don&rsquo;t Even Think About Doing an April Fool&rsquo;s Day Joke</h3>
<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-92568725-1585668992.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.610xh;0.00160xw,0.135xh&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">

<p>Unfortunate but unsurprising news for the members of the Ha Ha Hive out there: April Fool&rsquo;s Day is canceled and if you pull a prank online or in person you are guilty of a misdemeanor and have to Venmo me $5,000. At his daily informercial yesterday, President Trump got up after a rousing speech from the founder of MyPillow, yelled at a couple reporters for reminding him of things he actually said with his actual mouth, and then announced that April Fool&rsquo;s Day would be canceled this year, with no postponement currently under consideration. It&rsquo;s a tough but necessary blow to the prank economy. If you have access to Ryan Reynolds and George Clooney, please check in on them at this difficult time.</p>
<p>The move does have its detractors, though. Some say that the aggressive fun of lying to friends and associates for comedy reasons is just what the country needs to lift morale. Indeed, there are many reports of internal conflicts about the move in the Trump administration. Reportedly Jared Kushner argued that lying is the administration&rsquo;s most popular initiative and coming out against it, even for a day, would hurt their uncredibility. Nevertheless, for the first time the president made a decision with the public good in mind and outlawed April Fool&rsquo;s Day 2020.</p>
<p>Honestly, I&rsquo;m glad about this. The fact is there&rsquo;s no April Fool&rsquo;s joke powerful enough to counteract the present. Your scientists have tried and your scientists have failed. Ashton Kutcher was flown in from his secret wealthy person bunker and locked in a lab, but the results don&rsquo;t look great.</p>
<p>Woe to the person who thinks they have the solution! What are you going to do, tweet &ldquo;Rihanna&rsquo;s album is out! April Fool&rsquo;s!&quot;? The public will rise up upon you like a wall of fire and you will experience a cancellation so strong it will show up on a seismograph. Rolling on to Facebook, chuckling to yourself, and having the Tia and Temerity to type &ldquo;Zoom introduces new filter that keeps your face neutral even when you roll your eyes.&rdquo; Nope. No thank you. Keep the fiction in books, dearie. Put up or shut up 2020.</p>

<p>The only April Fool&rsquo;s Day joke I want to receive is from my landlord: &ldquo;Hi, rent is due. April Fool&rsquo;s! Can you imagine? OMG, have a great day and don&rsquo;t worry about sending me any money for a while. Also, I heard a rumor Rihanna&rsquo;s album came out? Huge if true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So many people like to terrorize their officemates with April Fool&rsquo;s jokes. What are you going to do now, Chad? Trick you Golden Retriever into thinking it&rsquo;s Friday? Really? You can play a prank on your kids if you want, but you should probably take into account that after you deceive your children, you have to live in the same space as them 24 hours a day for the foreseeable future. What&rsquo;s the plan, Chad?! You gotta think about April 2; you gotta think about April 10. You gotta think about the forty-first of Augtober. This is not a time for jokes. Well, except for these jokes, which are telling you explicitly that they are untruths and also are being brought to you in the month of March. So, to clarify: me=uncanceled, everything else=canceled. It&rsquo;s the law!</p>

<p>Actually, you know what? Why stop at canceling April 1? Let&rsquo;s cancel the whole month of April. Tax Day already got moved and Chromantica is postponed; let&rsquo;s just stay in March until we&rsquo;re able to touch each other&rsquo;s hands again. If we stop time, no one will age (this is science), none of the weird things we tweet will count, and Rihanna will eventually have to release that album. Once that happens, we can begin again!

<h3 id="april-fools-day-at-home-here-are-9-lighthearted-pranks">April Fools’ Day at home: Here are 9 lighthearted pranks</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.spokesman.com/photos/2020/03/31/Clooney_3EFJkMo_t1200.jpg?298603a24e8d51915fce203907ff2746e482a5a6" alt="img">
With the arrival of April Fools’ Day and a need for laughter, here are a few lighthearted pranks to keep the spirit up in a coronavirus quarantine:</p>
<p>Replace framed photos</p>
<p>The premise is simple if not requiring a little dexterity to not get caught: Replace all the existing framed family photos in your home with celebrities, historical figures or pop culture characters of your choosing. The payoff might not always be immediate if housemates fail to discover the swapped photos, but even that only makes the slow-burning revelation that much better.</p>
<p>Lamp shade insects</p>
<p>Make paper cutouts or order fake assortments of insects and attach them to the inside of a lamp shade. After turning the lamp on, the silhouettes of the chosen bugs will spread across the shade and leave an uneasy surprise for anyone unlucky enough to notice first.</p>
<p>Airhorn door stopper</p>
<p>In the event of being quarantined with an airhorn, this is a timely way to put it to use. Tape the airhorn to the wall with the top of the cannister facing toward the door handle so whoever opens it gets to experience one of the most alarming door stoppers ever.</p>
<p>Jellybeans in the ice dispenser</p>
<p>This simple gag exchanges crushed and cubed ice for a stream of jellybeans. Fill the ice dispenser with the preferred jellybean type and observe a surge of sweets occupy the unsuspecting person’s cup.</p>
<p>Cardboard cutout of a celebrity in the shower</p>
<p>This is a minimal setup for a maximum reward. Greet the next housemate who uses the shower with a cardboard cutout of any given public figure and listen to the shock ensue.</p>
<p>Chaotic candy bowl</p>
<p>On the morning of April Fools’ Day, debut a bowl that contains a mix of M&amp;Ms, Skittles and Reese’s Pieces. This, as expected, will become the ire of taste buds throughout the house. We cannot guarantee a safe reaction from housemates after this trick has been employed.</p>
<p>Googly-eye food</p>
<p>One of the more wholesome tactics in this list, attach googly eyes to all of the contents in your fridge. The next person who looks for a bite to eat will see a dozen pair of eyes staring right back.</p>
<p>Bubble wrap under a rug</p>
<p>If there happens to be spare bubble wrap lying around unpopped, fit it beneath a rug that hosts a lot of foot traffic. You’ll know when it works when you hear the double-barreled reaction of the bubble wrap bursting and someone yelping.</p>
<p>Frozen toothbrush cup</p>
<p>The night before April Fools’ Day, take your housemates’ toothbrush cups, fill it with water and stow them in the fridge. In the morning, they’ll wake up to their own toothbrush icicle. The most harm this trick does is the bad breath the trick-doer might endure in the morning.</p>
<p>Happy April Fools’ Day!
