<p>Omelly, who used to date Jamira, is accused of throwing shade at the &lsquo;Power&rsquo; star after he shares cryptic posts in which he calls someone &lsquo;lame&rsquo; and asks people not to compare him to another person.</p>
<p>Aug 23, 2019</p>
<p>AceShowbiz - While many have heaped praise on 50 Cent&rsquo;s new girlfriend Jamira Haines, at least someone is not happy with the couple&rsquo;s romance. Jamira&rsquo;s former boyfriend Omelly, who is also Meek Mill&rsquo;s cousin, appears to have dissed the actor/rapper for dating his ex-bae.</p>
<p>After reports emerged about the couple&rsquo;s red carpet debut at &ldquo;Power&rdquo; season 6 premiere, Omelly posted a cryptic message on Instagram Stories on Wednesday, August 21. &ldquo;Mmmm mmmmm mmmmm boy you lame,&rdquo; he wrote with laughing crying emojis.</p>
<p>In a now-deleted post, he also asked people not to &ldquo;compare him&rdquo; with someone else.</p>
<p>While he didn&rsquo;t mention any name, many people were convinced that Omelly was talking about 50 Cent in his cryptic posts. One poked fun at the hip-hop artist, &ldquo;Boy bye u jus mad cause she leveled up on ya.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another reacted, &ldquo;He HURT.&rdquo; Someone else accused Omelly of trying to get attention after his ex got a lot of love from Internet users. &ldquo;His ex got clout now he wanna post,&rdquo; the third user wrote.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not clear when 50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis James Jackson III, started dating Jamira, but they made their red carpet debut as a couple on Tuesday, August 20 at the new season premiere party for his Starz series. The fitness model, who goes by Cuban Link on Twitter and Instagram, looked gorgeous in a metallic purple mini dress with a very plunging neckline at the event.</p>
<p>Following their public appearance, &ldquo;50s girlfriend&rdquo; reportedly became one of Google&rsquo;s top performing search terms on Tuesday night. She allegedly also got more than 100,000 new followers in the past day.</p>
<p>The model, who is working towards becoming a lawyer, has received a lot of congratulatory messages from friends and fans on her new relationship with 50 Cent. Someone wrote to her, &ldquo;@50cent is a lucky man &hellip;..NOT @_cuban_link is a lucky woman lol come correct. y&rsquo;all cute boo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Responding to the supportive messages, she posted, &ldquo;I love how y&rsquo;all are happy that I&rsquo;m happy &hellip; that&rsquo;s love !&rdquo; She acknowledged that &ldquo;some of it might be fake,&rdquo; but added, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the thought that count. I see y&rsquo;all comments !! Can&rsquo;t get to all but ThankYou.&rdquo;

50 Cent may have a high-profile career, but he’s pretty private when it comes to his personal life. In comparison to other celebrities, the “Many Men” rapper doesn’t talk nearly as much about his relationships and other matters closest to his heart — which raises questions. If you’ve ever wondered who 50 Cent is dating, here’s what you need to know.</p>

<p>50 Cent has a girlfriend</p>
<p>As of writing, 50 Cent is dating Jamira “Cuban Link” Haines, a personal trainer and aspiring lawyer. As of writing, she has about 400,000 followers on Instagram, where she posts workout videos, tips, and — of course — snaps of 50 Cent.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how she and 50 Cent met, but it appears that they’ve been going strong since August. That month, the two went public with their romance when they attended a premiere party for Power Season 6. Cuban Link, 24, dazzled in a purple dress with a plunging neckline, while the 44-year-old rapper donned a gray jacket and dark jeans.</p>
<p>According to Distractify, Cuban Link confirmed their relationship after the event.</p>
<p>“I love how y’all are happy that I’m happy, that’s love!” she wrote on her Instagram Story. “Some of it might be fake but it’s the thought that count[s]. I see y’all comments!! Can’t get to all but thank you.”</p>

<p>Previously, Cuban Link dated Philadelphia rapper Omelly, who is signed to Meek Mill’s Dreamchasers label. While he does not yet have a breakout song, Omelly went viral in 2014 for his botched freestyle on Sway in the Morning.</p>
<p>Who has 50 Cent dated?</p>
<p>50 Cent dated model Daphne Joy prior to his relationship with Cuban Link. He and Joy reportedly were together from 2011 to 2012 and share one son, Sire. Though their romance did not work out, 50 Cent and Joy have a healthy co-parenting relationship. In September, they even came together and had some family time with their son.</p>
<p>50 Cent also had a high-profile fling with comedian Chelsea Handler in the early 2010s.</p>
<p>“We dated, very casually,” Handler previously told CNN (via The Huffington Post). “He’s a very sweet, nice guy… I was sampling, kind of, the atmosphere, seeing what was out there, and I was satiated.”</p>
<p>“He’s a great guy… he’s the complete antithesis of what you’d imagine,” she continued. “He’s a sweetheart, he’s great, he’s funny, he has a great sense of humor.”</p>
<p>He and Handler reportedly stopped seeing each other after a few months. But 50 Cent said in 2014 that they were still good friends.</p>
<p>Before that, 50 Cent was linked to Ciara, Meagan Good, and a few others.</p>
<p>While it’s been a long road, we’re glad to see that 50 Cent has seemingly finally found true happiness. We wish him and Cuban Link the best.</p>

<p>50 Cent had a little something to say to his girlfriend Jamira “Cuban Link” Hainre after she shared a post-workout clip to Instagram. The New York rapper apparently thought the post was too sexy and it should’ve been for his eyes only, not Hainre’s 434,000 followers.</p>
<p>The clip shows 50’s girlfriend wearing small gray shorts and a top that shows her muscular abs.</p>

<p>“i kilt the gym today .. or maybe the gym kilt me 🥴.. but ether way i won ! 💪🏽🥵 #laundrydaydontmindthebed,” wrote Hainre.</p>
<p>Many of her fans sent compliments afterwards.</p>
<p>“Damn i love it,” one of them wrote.</p>
<p>“Pure perfection,” another Instagram user stated.</p>
<p>“Show off sis 💪🏽🙌🏽,” wrote someone else.</p>
<p>50 responded to the post in the comments section and didn’t seem happy at all.</p>
<p>“I just landed now,” he wrote. “now why you gotta be doing sh– like this. you send this to my phone not to instagram, what the f–k.”</p>
<p>@_cuban_link Instagram</p>
<p>Rumors that 50 and Hainre were dating started over the summer, and it seemed to be confirmed when they appeared at the season 6 premiere of “Power” at Madison Square Garden in August of last year.</p>
<p>Some of their Instagram exchanges have caused a lot of chatter too. Like in October when 50 posted a photo of himself and “Power” co-star Joseph Sikora.</p>
<p>“Is it me or you getting finer every post,” Hainre wrote then about Fif.</p>
<p>Under Hainre’s Instagram share, the one that showed her post-workout body, many said they were glad that she kept the post up after 50 said she shouldn’t have uploaded it.</p>
<p>“I like that you kept this up. 50 don’t control you ❤️,” someone wrote.</p>
<p>“Why the f–k would it be a thirst trap,” wrote a second person. “If she into fitness then she showin off wat she do. @50 yu know she aint tryin to f-x wit nobody …. Let her shine.”</p>
<p>Others sent a message to 50 under Hainre’s post.</p>
<p>“Don’t get mad at her 50 she’s actually helping other women, motivating them to do the same. Being n living healthy,” read one of the comments.</p>
<p>Hainre, however, since deleted the post.

<p><img src="https://www.sohh.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/jim-jones.jpg" alt="img">
Dipset’s Jim Jones and Timbaland are geeking out right now. The hip-hop entertainers have hit up social media to congratulate rap superstars Meek Mill and JAY-Z on teaming up for a joint record label venture.</p>
<p>Jim, Timbo and more celebs went to Instagram to celebrate the huge power move.</p>
<p>Meek Mill initially went to Instagram Wednesday to announce his Dream Chasers Records is now officially with Young Hov’s Roc Nation.</p>
<p>According to reports, Meek and JAY made things official Tuesday at Roc Nation headquarters in New York City.</p>
<p>Holding the title of president of Dream Chasers, a joint venture with Roc Nation, Meek will oversee the label and build a staff to sign and develop artists. The label will also handle its own operations, creative strategy, marketing and business affairs. Meek is also planning to open a recording studio for use by the label’s artists. Said Jay-Z, whose 11-year-old Roc Nation has had Meek as a management client: “Everything he has done leading up to this point shows he is ready to [lead] the next generation. We look at the big picture — this is way beyond signing artists and having hot records.” (Variety)</p>
<p>Back in 2012, Meek officially joined forces with Roc Nation to handle his management.

<h3 id="50-cent-hit-the-power-red-carpet-with-girlfriend-jamira-haines">&ldquo;50 Cent Hit The ‘Power’ Red Carpet With Girlfriend Jamira Haines&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://urbanislandz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/50-cent-jamira-haines-pic.jpg" alt="img">
50 Cent had his new boo Jamira Haines on his arms on the Power red carpet in NYC.</p>
<p>The “Many men” rapper appeared at the premiere for the 6th season of Power at Madison Square Garden. The rapper arrived with his new girlfriend, Jamira Haines who is a fitness model and working towards becoming a lawyer.</p>
<p>50 Cent has previously dated celebrities such as famous singer and dancer, Ciara and swimsuit model, Daphne Joy. Jamira used to date Omelly, who is a member of Meek Mill’s Dreamchasers group. Rumors have been circulating that in 2017, Omelly was shot in North Camden, which is an area that had the highest crime rate at the time. The rapper’s team believed that it was Jamira who set Omelly up, which led to their break up.</p>
<p>At the premiere for the final season of ‘Power,’ 50 Cent posed for pictures with his new beau, Ice T, and Coco. The ‘Power’ producer then went on to perform his hit songs alongside rappers Snoop Dogg, Fabolous, Fetty Wap, Jeremih, Trey Songz, and A Boogie wit da Hoodie. Other celebrities were there also such as the main cast members of Power.</p>
<p>Jamira was backstage on Instagram during most of the action where she made posts such as “I love how y’ all are happy that I’m happy that’s love! Some of it might be fake but it’s the thought that count I see y’all comments ! ! Can’t get to all but ThankYou.” After the show, Jamira was seen again with 50 Cent on a couch at the after-party. The two looked pretty cozy. Let’s see what’s in store for the former G-Money rapper and his model girlfriend.

<p>The hip-hop mogul stepped out to the premiere of “Power” on Tuesday night with his stunning date, model Jamira Haines. The two were all smiles as they made their red-carpet debut during the Season 6 premiere event at New York City’s Madison Square Garden, posing for photos alongside Ice-T and Coco.</p>
<p>Jamira, who previously dated Dreamchasers rapper Omelly, is a fitness model and aspiring corporate lawyer. She shared photos of herself backstage and in the audience, singing along as 50 performed hits like “Many Men” on stage. Her mother even tagged along for the fun-filled evening.</p>
<p>The new couple was later seen cozied up on a couch at the after-party. Jamira, who goes by @_cuban_link on Instagram, reposted friends and fans who celebrated her new relationship.</p>
<p>“I love how y’ all are happy that I’m happy that’s love !” she told her followers. “Some of it might be fake but it’s the thought that count I see y’all comments ! ! Can’t get to all but ThankYou.”</p>
<p>50 took the stage during the star-studded premiere event, along with Snoop Dogg, Fabolous, Fetty Wap, Jeremih, Trey Songz, and A Boogie wit da Hoodie. The show’s stars Omari Hardwick, Lela Loren, Naturi Naughton, and Joseph Sikora also made appearances.</p>
<p>The sixth and final season of “Power” premieres Sunday, Aug. 25, on Starz.
