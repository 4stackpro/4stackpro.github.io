LOS ANGELES – Public COVID-19 testing sites in Los Angeles are getting a boost from CORE, a non-profit founded by actor Sean Penn, allowing the program to conduct 30,000 tests a week, according to the city. Any L.A. County resident with symptoms can schedule a test through an online portal, although, testing is still limited.</p>
<p>“It’s a new paradigm. We’re all processing it in our own way,” Penn said Monday at a testing site in Malibu.</p>
<p>The Malibu testing site gave priority to any first responder or essential worker to get tested. A line of cars stretched along the streets surrounding City Hall Monday.</p>
<p>MORE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:</p>
<p>CORE is hiring dozens of new employees to conduct the testing in Los Angeles. The test used by the city can be self-administered but has been conducted by Los Angeles County firefighters. Training civilians will free up those first responders to return to the front lines.</p>
<p>The free testing allowed Whole Foods Cashier Tatiana Marsh to get tested, even though she was not experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms.</p>
<p>“How does it feel to be in the world today for any of us? It’s a very new paradigm. We’re all processing it in our own way.”</p>
<p>Sean Penn founded CORE ten years ago to help Haiti recover from an earthquake. Now, it’s responding to a disaster in his own backyard - Covid-19. pic.twitter.com/rhTwl2hSa1 — Kate Cagle (@KateCagle) April 7, 2020</p>
<p>“More tiredness and paranoia because I’m dealing with so many people at a time,” Tatiana said as she waited for her turn to be tested by doctors wearing face shields and other personal protective equipment.</p>
<p>It’s a test many people want, but few can get. Marsh said she will rest easier after she gets the result, since asymptomatic carries can spread the disease.</p>
<p>“The energy definitely shifted. There’s a little panic now that they are saying the worst of it is coming,” Marsh said.

<h3 id="sean-penn-and-girlfriend-leila-george-help-direct-cores-coronavirus-drive-thru-testing-site">Sean Penn and girlfriend Leila George help direct CORE&rsquo;s coronavirus drive-thru testing site</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/06/00/26846324-0-image-a-35_1586130746669.jpg" alt="img">
He&rsquo;s on the front line in the battle to stop the spread of the growing coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Sean Penn&rsquo;s non-profit CORE (Community Organized Relief Effort) is now running some of Los Angeles&rsquo; drive-thru testing facilities.</p>
<p>And the Academy Award-winning actor, his girlfriend Leila George, and his two adult children are among the staff of volunteers who are trying to make a real difference in the battle against COVID-19.</p>
<p>On the front lines: Sean Penn&rsquo;s non-profit CORE is running some of the drive-thru coronavirus testing facilities in Los Angeles</p>
<p>On Sunday, Penn was spotted helping navigate the flow of cars lined up to get tested for the virus at a location in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The Mystic River star, 59, wore a protective mask much of the time, but he did take it off occasionally to talk to colleagues as he helped run the operation.</p>
<p>George, 28, whom Penn has dated since 2016, was also vigilant in wearing a mask while dressed in blue denim jeans, a fitted black sweatshirt, leather boots and a CORE baseball cap over her long brown tresses.</p>
<p>Making a difference: Penn, 59, and his girlfriend Leila George , 28, were among the volunteers who worked at the testing site in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles on Sunday</p>
<p>Safety: George took extra precautions with a full-body protective suit and mask</p>
<p>Penn and George helped instruct motorists about how to take a swab, which is then tested for the virus.</p>
<p>Members of the public using the facility test themselves and get their results in approximately one week. The test is free.</p>
<p>CORE partnered with the city of Los Angeles to take over the drive-through test sites so the first responders currently working them can get back on the front lines.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is going to be most valuable in this pandemic of what we as citizen organizations can do is to get the professionals relieved of duties that are beneath their training sets &hellip; so they can get back on the street,&rsquo; Penn told ABC News.</p>
<p>Leading the way: Penn wore a protective mask much of the time, but he did take it off occasionally to talk to colleagues as he helped run the operation</p>
<p>Comfort and style: George, whom Penn has dated since 2016, wore blue denim jeans, a fitted black sweatshirt, leather boots and a CORE baseball cap over her long brown tresses</p>
<p>The plan is for the CORE team to run three of Los Angeles&rsquo; six coronavirus testing sites.</p>
<p>Many times the actor&rsquo;s daughter Dylan Penn, 28, and son Hopper Penn, 26, are also helping out with the running of the testing sites.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Both of my kids are working in the hot zone line … they are very service-oriented people themselves and there was no keeping them off it,&rsquo; Penn said.

<p>Sean Penn is lending a hand during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the Oscar winner, 59, was spotted helping volunteers at a drive-thru testing site in Los Angeles. Penn’s nonprofit Community Organized Relief Effort (CORE) recently teamed up with the mayor’s office and the L.A. Fire Department to run the locations in order to free up healthcare workers needed on the frontlines.</p>

<p>Testing at the drive-thru stations is free for high-risk individuals, according to the CORE website.</p>
<p>“What is going to be most valuable in this pandemic of what we as citizen organizations can do,” Penn told ABC News, “is to get the professionals relieved of duties that are beneath their training sets … so they can get back on the street.”</p>
<p>The Milk actor was seen assisting over the weekend with girlfriend Leila George, who he’s been dating since 2016. Both wearing face masks during the outing, the couple frequently bonds over philanthropic efforts; last month they shared a night out at a fundraiser for wildlife relief in Australia following the devastating bushfires.</p>

<p>George, 28, made a call for volunteers on Instagram, writing that the team needs “all the help we can get.”</p>
<p>“I’m working with @coreresponse setting up drive thru COVID testing sites around LA. We need all the help we can get. VERY safe environment. FULL protection provided.</p>
<p>JOIN ME! 😍,” she wrote.</p>
<p>Penn’s two children — daughter Dylan, 28, and son Hopper, 26, who he shares with ex Robin Wright — are additionally helping out in the effort organized by CORE, which also pitched in during other crises over the years, like in Haiti in 2010.</p>
<p>“Both of my kids are working in the hot zone line,” Penn told ABC News. “They are very service-oriented people themselves, and there was no keeping them off it.”</p>
