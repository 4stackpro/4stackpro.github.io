A retired Venezuelan army general indicted alongside Nicolas Maduro has surrendered in Colombia and is being taken by Drug Enforcement Administration agents to New York for arraignment, four people familiar with the situation told the Associated Press on Friday.</p>
<p>Cliver Alcala has been an outspoken critic of the Venezuelan president for years. But he was charged on Thursday with allegedly running a &ldquo;narcoterrorist conspiracy&rdquo; with Maduro, socialist party boss Diosdado Cabello and another retired army general. United States prosecutors allege they sent 250 metric tonnes of cocaine a year to the US and turned the Venezuelan state into a platform for violent cartels and Colombian rebels.</p>
<p>More:</p>
<p>The US Justice Department had offered a $10 million reward for Alcala&rsquo;s arrest.</p>
<p>Alcala was being flown on a chartered plane to the US from Barranquilla, Colombia, after waiving an extradition hearing and agreeing to collaborate with prosecutors, said the four people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss actions that had not yet been made public.</p>
<p>Alcala has been living in the coastal city since fleeing Venezuela in 2018 after the discovery of a conspiracy that he was secretly leading in hopes of ousting Maduro.</p>
<p>After being indicted on Thursday, Alcala shocked many by claiming responsibility for a stockpile of US-made assault weapons and military equipment seized on a highway in Colombia for what he said was a planned incursion into Venezuela to remove Maduro.</p>
<p>Without offering evidence, he said he had a contract with opposition leader Juan Guaido and his &ldquo;American advisers&rdquo; to purchase the weapons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had everything ready,&rdquo; Alcala said in a video published on social media. &ldquo;But circumstances that have plagued us throughout this fight against the regime generated leaks from the very heart of the opposition, the part that wants to coexist with Maduro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The confusing remarks from someone who was among Maduro&rsquo;s loudest critics were seized on by Venezuela&rsquo;s socialist leader, who accused the DEA of being behind a plan by Alcala to assassinate him and other political leaders.</p>
<p>According to the indictment, Alcala in 2008, when a trusted aide to then-President Hugo Chavez, was given additional duties to coordinate drug shipments with corrupt elements of the Venezuelan military and guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, which the US listed as a terrorist group.</p>
<p>The DEA did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Nicole Navas, a Justice Department spokesperson, declined to comment.</p>
<p>Moments before his surrender, Alcala published a video on social media bidding farewell to his family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I face the responsibilities for my actions with the truth,&rdquo; he said.

<h3 id="venezuela-says-us-drug-charges-against-maduro-show-desperation">Venezuela says US drug charges against Maduro show &lsquo;desperation&rsquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2020/2/14/92055526f7c74db0a33acc3b9e3a1671_18.jpg" alt="img">
Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said on Thursday that drug trafficking charges by the United States against President Nicolas Maduro announced earlier in the day showed the &ldquo;desperation&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Washington elite&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Arreaza said the decision by the administration of US President Donald Trump to offer rewards for the capture of Maduro and other high-ranking officials accused of drug trafficking show the administration&rsquo;s &ldquo;obsession&rdquo; with Venezuela, which he said was due to its desire to reap &ldquo;electoral returns&rdquo; in the US state of Florida.</p>
<p>More:</p>
<p>Trump was &ldquo;once more attacking the Venezuelan people and its democratic institutions, using a new form of coup d&rsquo;etat based on miserable, vulgar and unfounded accusations,&rdquo; Arreaza added.</p>
<p>In an extremely rare criminal case against a foreign head of state, the US Department of Justice indicted Maduro and several of his top ministers after accusing him of leading a cocaine-trafficking group called &ldquo;The Cartel of the Suns&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The US Department of State offered a reward of up to $15m for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Maduro, whose country has been convulsed by years of a deep economic crisis and political upheaval.</p>
<p>The indictment marks a serious new phase against Maduro by Washington at a time when some US officials have privately said Trump is increasingly frustrated with the results of his Venezuela policy.</p>
<p>US Attorney General William Barr, announcing charges that include narco-terrorism conspiracy, corruption, and drug trafficking, accused Maduro and his associates of colluding with a dissident faction of the demobilised Colombian armed group, the FARC, &ldquo;to flood the United States with cocaine&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the Venezuelan people suffer, this cabal lines their pockets with drug money and the proceeds of their corruption,&rdquo; Barr said of Maduro and the others who were indicted.</p>
<p>Maduro is already under US sanctions and has been the target of a US effort aimed at pushing him from power. He took office in 2013 after the death of his mentor President Hugo Chavez, a staunch foe of the US.</p>
<p>Other Venezuelan officials whose indictments were announced on Thursday include Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez, senior socialist leader Diosdado Cabello, and the chief justice of the country&rsquo;s supreme court, Maikel Jose Moreno Perez, who was charged with money laundering. The US government is offering $10m for information leading to Cabello&rsquo;s arrest.</p>
<p>The US and dozens of other countries have recognised opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela&rsquo;s legitimate president, regarding Maduro&rsquo;s 2018 re-election as a sham. But Maduro has remained in power, backed by the country&rsquo;s military and by Russia, China and Cuba.</p>
<p>US officials have long accused Maduro and his associates or running a &ldquo;narco-state,&rdquo; saying they have used proceeds from drugs shipped from neighbouring Colombia to make up for lost revenue from a Venezuelan oil sector hit by heavy sanctions by the US.

<h3 id="no-evidence-of-crypto-related-charge-in-maduro-drug-cases">No Evidence of Crypto-Related Charge in Maduro Drug Cases</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy81ZmVlODE2OWI3MDRlYWFkNjAzOWJjZTUwNWE3ODM5MS5qcGc=.jpg" alt="img">
Several Venezuelan leaders recently came under fire for alleged criminal acts, although, contrary to initial impressions, the situation did not directly involve cryptocurrency usage.</p>
<p>“Maduro and his co-defendants are not alleged to have been involved with crypto, directly,” Ashok Ayyar, counsel at Experience Legal, told Cointelegraph.</p>
<p>A number of Venezuelan officials, including former president Maduro, faced a slew of charges from U.S. governing bodies, according to a March 26 statement from the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ). Despite the press release announcing the charges touting the Homeland Security Investigations’ ability to track cryptocurrency transactions, a close examination of the DoJ’s indictments reveals no direct mention of cryptocurrency or blockchain usage as part of criminal allegations against Maduro or his cohorts.</p>
<p>“The Indictment extends from 2014-2019 and involved funds flowing through US banks,” Joshua Garcia, partner at Blakemore Fallon legal practice, told Cointelegraph via email, adding:</p>
<p>“My sense is if Petro was involved it was only involved later in the scheme, and it‘s unlikely any US banks directly touched the crypto, so an intermediary like bitcoin might have been used at some point (pure speculation).”</p>
<p>Crypto is sometimes unnecessarily affiliated with criminal activity</p>
<p>Numerous headlines have affiliated cryptocurrency with criminal activity over the years, making the asset class an easy scapegoat for financial crimes, even where no correlation exists.</p>
<p>“There is no allegation in the indictments that the Petro or any other crypto was specifically involved,” Coinsource general counsel Arnold Spencer told Cointelegraph.</p>
<p>Spencer added:</p>
<p>“The statement in the press release from HSI officials is not supported by the indictments (which is a violation of DOJ policy). Why do US officials try to vilify crypto when there is no allegation that crypto is involved in the alleged conspiracy?”</p>
<p>Crimes by the country’s officials came before the Petro</p>
<p>Venezuela has appeared in a number of blockchain-relevant headlines over the past two years. Most recently, the country released its own national crypto asset, the Petro, in the midst of soaring national inflation.</p>
<p>“The Maduro indictment suggests the money laundering by the cartel long pre-dates the Petro and other Venezuelan sanctions, stretching all the way back to 1999,” Ayyar explained. “The Petro likely became part of the money-laundering scheme more recently, but that is not the only cause of this indictment.”</p>
<p>The only crypto references include broad mention</p>
<p>In fact, the DoJ’s statement includes only two passing cryptocurrency references, but neither are substantially linked to any of the department’s specific charges.</p>
<p>Homeland Security Investigations Acting Executive Associate Director, Alysa Erichs, mentioned a broad reference of crypto, as part of her department’s overall initiatives. Erichs said:</p>
<p>“Today’s announcement highlights HSI’s global reach and commitment to aggressively identify, target and investigate individuals who violate U.S. laws, exploit financial systems, and hide behind cryptocurrency to further their illicit criminal activity.”</p>
<p>The other mention of crypto sits at the bottom of the statement</p>
<p>The only other direct crypto reference comes as part of a job title mentioned at the bottom of the DoJ’s announcement:</p>
<p>“A separate superseding indictment unsealed today in the Southern District of New York charges Tareck Zaidan El Aissami Maddah, 45, Venezuela’s vice president for the economy, Joselit Ramirez Camacho, 33, Venezuela’s superintendent of cryptocurrency (Sunacrip), and Samark Lopez Bello, 45, a Venezuelan businessman, with a series of crimes relating to efforts to evade sanctions imposed by OFAC against Maduro Moros, El Aissami Maddah, and Lopez Bello.”</p>
<p>This crypto reference still likely does not mean direct crypto involvement. “Adding Ramirez now just means that the Petro is a part (but not the whole) of the equation,” Ayyar said. He also noted that Ramirez was indicted in 2019, but was added to this 2020 indictment, which now takes the place of last year’s accusations.</p>
<p>“To me, this suggests that the petro was undoubtedly one means for sanctions evasion and money laundering, but not the only one,” Ayyar said, adding:</p>
<p>“There was enough sanctions evasion and money laundering even without the Petro being involved. But no way do they add Ramirez to the indictment today unless the Petro/crypto was involved.”</p>
<p>Although the charges state no direct specifics, Ayyar said he thinks the whole situation might have involved other crypto assets, aside from the Petro. “What other currencies did Venezuela accept in their token pre-sale?” he said. “I would think it had to include BTC and ETH, but I can&rsquo;t recall,” he posited. “Those currencies were likely used for sanctions evasion and money laundering, too.”</p>
<p>Taking into account the wide range of laws, allegations and parties entangled in the situation, including Ramirez, Spencer sees the Petro being included in the inspections and proceedings. “I would go so far to say that the Petro will likely be involved, but most likely as a collateral issue and not the central focus of any trial.”</p>
<p>Crypto may have been used, but not as part of these allegations</p>
<p>Providing even further clarity, Spencer explained the Venezeulan brass likely used crypto at some point, but not during the right time frame. He said:</p>
<p>“It is highly likely that these government officials engaged in crypto transactions during the time that they are alleged to have committed acts of corruption and drug smuggling. But the indictment does not allege this. The indictment alleges bulk cash smuggling, shell corporations, and illegal travel. There are no allegations in the Indictments that any of the defendants actually used cryptocurrencies.”</p>
<p>All this leads back to an initial sticking point proposed by Spencer — why did HSI’s Alysa Erichs mention crypto when the asset class was not directly involved? The most logical answer is that she mentioned it as part of the organization’s current overall endeavors.</p>
