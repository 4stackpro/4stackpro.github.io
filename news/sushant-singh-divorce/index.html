<p>“Sushant Singh Rajput&hellip;a bright young actor gone too soon,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted. “He excelled on TV and in films. His rise in the world of entertainment inspired many and he leaves behind several memorable performances. Shocked by his passing away. My thoughts are with his family and fans. Om Shanti.”

Gulabo Sitabo actor Nalneesh Neel reveals he has learnt a lot from Amitabh Bachchan during the film’s shoot. “It was a great moment working with Amitabh sir. He has great energy on the set. We worked together before in an advertisement shoot, and now this film. I feel fortunate because people only dream of working with him,” Nalneesh said. “We went for a reading session at his residence in Mumbai and it was an amazing experience. I got to learn a lot of things from him and his dedication towards work. He makes his co-stars comfortable. He is a very supportive person and helped me a lot to improvise,” added the actor.

<p>In the Shoojit Sircar directorial, Nalneesh Neel plays the caretaker of Fatima Mahal, the mansion owned by Fatima Begum, who is the wife of Mirza, Amitabh Bachchan’s protagonist. Nalneesh’s character has no dialogues because he is mute in the story. “I, my wife and our son are very close to Mirza Shaikh (Amitabh Bachchan) and Fatima Begum (Farrukh Jafar) and take care of them. Amitabh sir and I had some funny moments together while filming in Lucknow,” recalled the actor.

<p>“I had very few conversations with him and spoke mostly during our rehearsals. His behaviour on the set was humble and kind. We used to have a gala time on the set to make the mood light. He used to make everyone laugh,” Nalneesh added. However, despite getting an opportunity to work with Amitabh Bachchan twice, Nalneesh has a major regret — not being able to click a photograph with him.</p>
<p>“When I did the ad shoot, I couldn’t take a picture with him. Even during this film, I couldn’t click a picture with him. On the last day of the shoot, I felt very shy to ask him for a photo. At one point of time, I gathered some courage to approach him and he replied, ‘haan bolo’. I told him that my mother wants to talk to you. Then he spoke to my entire family via video call and praised my work,” revealed the actor. Directed by Shoojit Sircar, “Gulabo Sitabo” also stars Ayushmann Khurrana, Vijay Raaz, Brijendra Kala, Srishti Shrivastava and Farrukh Jafar. The movie premiered on Amazon Prime Video on Friday.</p>

Is India skipper Virat Kohli and his wife, actress Anushka Sharma getting divorced? No, is the answer. Then why is #VirushkaDivorce one of the top trends in India?

<p><img src="https://www.bollywoodshaadis.com/img/article-l-202061666161822578000.jpg" alt="img">
Shweta Tiwari is a household name now and needs no introduction. It is often said that it is hard to have a great personal and professional life together, and Shweta seems to be a great example of it. Shweta has a great professional graph, however, her personal life has always tanked down despite her attempts to keep things rosy. Shweta is a strong woman and had tried her best to keep up with her abusive husband, Raja Chaudhary. But when nothing had worked out, she had called it quits with him. On July 13, 2013, Shweta had given marriage another chance and had tied the knot with actor, Abhinav Kohli.

<p>It was in 2019 that rumour mills were abuzz about trouble in Shweta and Abhinav’s paradise, and Shweta had filed domestic violence against him. After all the hullaballoo, the things went calm, but Shweta’s husband, Abhinav again started the rift by sharing a lot on his Instagram handle about the on-going case, dragging Shweta and her daughter, Palak Tiwari into it.</p>

<p>Abhinav has been sharing Palak’s Instagram handle’s screenshots and her posts, which obviously, did not go too well with Palak’s mother, Shweta as she lashed out at her estranged husband. Shweta asked Abhinav to stop posting about her daughter. Her comment can be read as “STOP POSTING ABOUT MY DAUGHTER!!!! ITS HARASSMENT. AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID!!!!” Abhinav took a screenshot of this and shared it on his Instagram handle on June 14, 2020, asking her why haven’t she filed for the divorce yet. His caption along with the picture can be read as “@shweta.tiwari AND WHY HAVEN’T YOU FILED FOR DIVORCE TILL DATE.&rdquo; Take a look:</p>

<p>Not just this, Abhinav also took screenshots of her conversation with a follower and shared a series of those screenshots on his Instagram handle on the same day. Sharing those screenshots, he wrote, “?? Why were you @shweta.tiwari commenting on my page which you just now deleted??? You must be sending your answers to your PR&hellip;. You had pasted these comments on the Hi Vicky page answering @chaitali2244. GOD is there to help always.”</p>

<p>Shweta Tiwari had posted a cryptic message on her Instagram stories on June 13, 2020, which had tangled the whole story even more. She had shared some lines of a book on her kindle, which could be read as &ldquo;As long as the people who matter most know the truth, I don&rsquo;t care about the rest, get some sleep.&rdquo; Check out the screengrab of her Instagram story below.

<p>For the uninitiated, Abhinav had started posting about Shweta Tiwari’s daughter, Palak on June 13, 2020. Abhinav Kohli had shared Palak’s Instagram post screenshot, which she had deleted later. In her post, she had stated that her step-father, Abhinav has never physically molested her or touched her inappropriately. But she had deleted it later, but Abhinav had saved and had shared the screenshots of the same and had written, &ldquo;Lovu why would you delete this post from your Instagram?&rdquo; Check out the post below.

<p><img src="https://www.reportdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Helen-Hunt-Birthday-A-Look-At-Some-Interesting-Facts-About-990x559.jpg" alt="img">
Helen Elizabeth Hunt is one charming woman. May know the actress and filmmaker for her caustic wit. It’s a rare thing for not everybody can be sarcastic and charming at the same time. She shot to fame after portraying Jamie Buchman in the sitcom Mad About You. This led to her very successful film career. The highlight of her resume is her Academy Award-winning performance in As Good As It Gets. We have got to thank her father and acting coach, Gordon Hunt, for he was the one who introduced Helen to acting.</p>
<p>Helen is celebrating her 56th birthday today. As she turns a year older, we take a look at some interesting facts about her life.</p>
<p>Was introduced to acting very early on</p>
<p>We told you that it was Helen’s father who introduced her to acting. When she was just 3-years-old, her family moved to New York City, where her father directed theatre and she attended plays as a child several times a week. That is how the journey started for Helen.</p>
<p>She got paid a lot for the final season of Mad About You</p>
<p>The TV show did change Helen’s life, both professionally and financially. For the final season of the show, she and her co-star Paul Reiser were received $1 million ($1.5 million today) per episode. That’s a lot of money, but then they deserved every bit of it.

<p>Her personal life</p>
<p>In 1994, Helen started dating actor Hank Azaria. They exchanged the wedding vows in 1999, and divorced 17 months later. In 2001, she started dating director Matthew Carnahan. But then the couple split in 2017.</p>
<p>Got into direction</p>
<p>Helen also got into direction at some point in her career. She has directed episodes of popular TV shows like House Of Lies, American Housewife, Revenge, This Is Us, and more. She also helmed the series finale episode of Mad About You. We wish Helen a very happy birthday.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/anushka-sharma-paatal-lok.jpg" alt="img">
Hailing India skipper Virat Kohli as a patriot, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA from Uttar Pradesh, Nandkishor Gurjar, has levied charges of sedition against the cricketer’s wife and Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma, asking her husband to divorce him. This comes as a bizarre statement after the huge success of Amazon Prime’s latest offering Paatal Lok produced by Anushka Sharma.

<p>Not just that, he also sent a letter to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Prakash Javdekar, requesting him to ban the streaming of the series due to the controversy.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Anushka was sent a legal notice for allegedly using a casteist slur in her show. Viren Sri Gurung, a member of the Lawyers Guild has sent a legal notice to Anushka and her brother Karnesh Sharma who are the executive producers of the show.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the MLA’s statement has not gone down well with the fans, who have trolled the minister in a brutal manner on social media.</p>

<p>Kelly Clarkson wants to put an end to her marriage.</p>
<p>E! News can confirm The Voice coach has filed for divorce from husband Brandon Blackstock after almost seven years of marriage.</p>
<p>According to court documents obtained by E! News, the American Idol winner quietly filed in Los Angeles last week and cited irreconcilable differences. The date of separation is listed as &ldquo;TBD.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The couple, who has two children together, have been married since 2013. Brandon also has two children from a previous marriage. Kelly is asking for joint legal and physical custody.</p>
<p>Many fans know their love story began at the Academy of Country Music Awards in 2006 when Kelly was rehearsing with Rascal Flatts. Lo and behold, Brandon served as the group&rsquo;s tour manager at the time. The relationship, however, didn&rsquo;t take off until a meeting six years later. Within 10 months of dating, Brandon proposed with Kelly announcing her engagement news in December 2012.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;M ENGAGED!!!! I wanted y&rsquo;all to know!!&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;Happiest night of my life last night! I am so lucky and am with the greatest man ever.&rdquo;
