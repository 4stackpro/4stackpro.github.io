Expand Myanmar press freedom and youth activists demonstrate for the release of two jailed Reuters journalists, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, in Yangon, Myanmar, September 16, 2018. ©2018 Reuters/Ann Wang (Bangkok) – Myanmar authorities should immediately drop all charges against an editor for broadcasting an interview with an armed group representative, Human Rights Watch said today. On March 30, police arrested and charged Nay Myo Lin, the editor-in-chief of the Mandalay-based Voice of Myanmar, under Myanmar’s overly broad Counter-Terrorism Law for an interview with the Arakan Army spokesperson.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the Myanmar government has expanded its crackdown on journalists, including several editors. The actions have severely undermined press freedom and access to information in the country.</p>
<p>“The Myanmar authorities’ assault on media freedom by arresting journalists who are simply doing their job harms everyone’s access to information,” said Linda Lakhdhir, Asia legal advisor. “Nay Myo Lin was unjustly charged and should immediately be released.”</p>
<p>On March 23, the Myanmar government designated the insurgent Arakan Army as a terrorist organization under the Counter-Terrorism Law and as an “unlawful association” under section 15(2) of the colonial-era Unlawful Associations Act. On March 27, Nay Myo Lin interviewed the Arakan Army spokesperson Khaing Thu Kha and broadcast the interview under the title “Peace Process has stopped.”</p>
<p>The Mandalay Special Branch police filed a criminal complaint against Nay Myo Lin under sections 50(a) and 52(a) of the Counter-Terrorism Law. Section 50(a) of the law authorizes a minimum sentence of ten years and a maximum of life imprisonment for, among other actions, “causing fear among the public” or “damaging the security of the public.” Section 52(a) authorizes a sentence of three to seven years in prison for activities that “knowingly involve a terrorist group.”</p>
<p>Nay Myo Lin’s arrest reflects the government’s deepening crackdown on independent media. On March 31, police raided the home of the editor-in chief of the Yangon-based Khit Thit News media outlet. Police also raided the office of the Sittwe-based Narinjara news outlet, arresting three journalists – Thein Zaw, Aung Lin Htun, and Htun Khaing – and releasing them later that evening. The Democratic Voice of Burma reported that the editor-in-chief of Narinjara, Khaing Mrat Kyaw, has been charged under the Counter-Terrorism Law but has not been arrested.</p>
<p>“The baseless charges against Nay Myo Lin and Khaing Mrat Kyaw make clear that every journalist trying to cover Myanmar’s many conflicts is at risk,” Lakhdhir said. “So too are the humanitarian workers trying to bring aid to civilians at risk and human rights advocates monitoring abuse in conflict areas.”</p>
<p>While international human rights law allows governments to place restrictions on the media for national security reasons, these restrictions must be strictly necessary for a legitimate purpose and not be overbroad. They may not be used to suppress or withhold information of legitimate public interest not harmful to national security, or to prosecute journalists for reporting such information. For the government to fulfill this responsibility, journalists should be able to speak to and meet with a variety of people without fear of arrest or harassment – including those who are in conflict with the government or military.</p>
<p>The Myanmar government has repeatedly used draconian laws against journalists for reporting on military abuses or ethnic armed groups. In 2018, two Reuters journalists were sentenced to seven years in prison under Myanmar’s Official Secrets Act after uncovering a massacre of Rohingya Muslims. They were released on a presidential pardon after spending more than a year in jail. Aung Marm Oo, the editor-in-chief of the news agency Development Media Group (DMG), which has reported on the conflict in Rakhine State, is currently facing a complaint under the Unlawful Associations Act, which carries a sentence of up to five years in prison.</p>
<p>Access to information is rapidly diminishing under Myanmar’s current government. On March 23, the Ministry of Transport and Communications instructed four mobile operators to block access to 221 websites deemed to be spreading “fake news” or containing explicit content, according to the media.</p>
<p>Narinjara and Development Media Group said that since March 24, they have been blocked by all four mobile operators , which include Norway’s Telenor, Qatari-owned Ooredoo, military-affiliated MyTel and the state-owned MPT. Telenor is the only telecommunications provider to have issued a statement about the government directive.</p>
<p>The current editor-in-chief of DMG, Phadu Tun Aung, told local media that by blocking the only two ethnic-Rakhine media outlets, the government had effectively silenced ethnic Rakhine voices. “By blocking our websites, [the government is] restricting the people’s right to information,” he said. Other registered media outlets in Shan and Karen States and Mandalay region also reported that they were blocked.</p>
<p>Any government restrictions on websites should clearly explain why the content is being taken down and should focus on specific content rather than whole domains.</p>
<p>The government should also lift the continued internet shutdowns in nine townships in Rakhine and Chin States, which threaten the safety of civilians as fighting between the Arakan Army and the Myanmar armed forces continues. The blanket shutdown violates international human rights law, which requires internet-based restrictions to be necessary and proportionate.</p>
<p>Internet service providers should fully resist unjustified internet shutdowns or takedowns, including by seeking a legal basis for any shutdown order and interpreting requests to cause the least intrusive restrictions. They should carry out their responsibilities under the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and avoid complicity in human rights abuses especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“The Myanmar government has increasingly acted to restrict access to information it does not like and punish those who bring it to light,” Lakhdhir said. “Counter-terrorism laws should never be used against journalists for their reporting. Under these circumstances the future for press freedom in Myanmar is bleak.”

<h3 id="fears-of-coronavirus-catastrophe-as-myanmar-reports-first-death">Fears of coronavirus catastrophe as Myanmar reports first death</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2020/4/1/c8a2fd5fc3064f3a9463753e45c955c2_18.jpg" alt="img">
Yangon, Myanmar - Myanmar is braced for a &ldquo;major outbreak&rdquo; after one of the thousands of migrants returning from Thailand tested positive for the new coronavirus, and the country recorded its first COVID-19 death on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Myanmar confirmed its first two cases on March 23, in two people who had travelled to the United States and the United Kingdom, but that number has now climbed to 14.</p>
<p>More:</p>
<p>Andrew Tatem, an epidemiologist at the University of Southampton, said it was &ldquo;quite likely&rdquo; the virus arrived in Myanmar earlier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The countries surrounding Myanmar reported cases &hellip; much earlier, and there is usually substantial mobility in the region,&rdquo; he said via email, adding that more widespread testing would be expected to find more cases.</p>
<p>Myanmar shares a 2,000-kilometre-long (1,243 miles) border with China, crossed by an estimated 10,000 workers on a daily basis. Before they were stopped, the country also had direct flights to Wuhan, the city where the pandemic first began.</p>
<p>Slow off the mark</p>
<p>Myanmar has also been slow to institute widespread testing, with only 517 people tested as of the end of March. Even this low number is a marked increase, given that Myanmar had tested less than 150 people by March 18. It was only on March 20 that the health minister announced a new policy to test for anybody with symptoms, not just recent travellers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To find 10 cases from 300 tests suggests that there are many more cases out there and scaling up testing should be a priority to get on top of the virus spread and guide response,&rdquo; Tatem said.</p>
<p>The United Nations has announced a plan to donate 50,000 testing kits to Myanmar, supplementing previous donations of 3,000 from Singapore and 5,000 from South Korea.</p>
<p>Khin Khin Gyi, spokesperson for the Ministry of Health, admitted it was possible the virus arrived in Myanmar earlier, but said a certain percentage of those cases would presumably have been &ldquo;severe&rdquo; and therefore would have come to the government&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>Joshua Poole, country director for Catholic Relief Services Myanmar, agreed that if there were widespread cases across the country, the news would be circulating on social media. Poole also chairs the Steering Committee of the International NGO Forum in Myanmar and has sat in on virtual meetings between the WHO, UN, and Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re having some challenges in terms of getting more tests out there. In my perspective, it seems like the government is doing everything they can. Obviously, there are some challenges, and there certainly seems to be some delays, but I&rsquo;m actually quite impressed with what the ministry is able to do,&rdquo; he said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Others, like independent analyst David Mathieson, are less impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The public health system in Myanmar is woefully unsuited to responding to a pandemic on this scale, so it will be hard to assess how long COVID-19 has been in the country and how many people have perished but had deaths recorded under other causes,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Mathieson said the government was slow to respond due to a &ldquo;toxic mixture of incompetence, a culture of denial, and ultra-nationalist bluster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Health Minister Myint Htwe set the unrealistic goal of zero cases and zero deaths, while government spokesman Zaw Htay said Myanmar was protected by its lifestyle, diet, and lack of credit cards.</p>
<p>While Myanmar did begin to take action once cases were confirmed, Mathieson is worried the government lost more than a month&rsquo;s worth of time.</p>
<p>Return from Thailand</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of migrant workers returned from Thailand last week as the borders were closed, which Tatem said has &ldquo;the potential to seed outbreaks across the country if there are not local outbreaks occurring already&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The migrants crowded across the border before boarding buses with the general population and dispersing throughout the country.</p>
<p>Khin Khin Gyi said the government had &ldquo;planned a lot&rdquo; for the return of migrants from Thailand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had social distancing at the immigration counter, a medical declaration form, we took their names and residences in the country,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Migrant workers from Myanmar began crossing the border at Mae Sot as Thailand prepared to implement emergency measures [Stringer/Reuters]</p>
<p>She added that local authorities were informed of their whereabouts so they can &ldquo;watch&rdquo; returnees, and soon the government will implement community quarantine measures and violators will face legal action. &ldquo;Some people do not follow the home quarantine,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>But locals and activists working with migrants said the government response had been unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>Alexa Bay, director of anti-trafficking group Daughters Rising, said migrant workers belatedly heard about self-isolation policies from local news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have not heard anything from the government,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Wahkushee Tenner, a Karen activist, said the chaotic return had put the migrants and local population at risk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These people are at the most risk of being infected if anyone among this big crowd is infected. It&rsquo;s really putting the local community at high risk where there is no test available, and most of these workers came from poor and remote areas,&rdquo; she said in a message.</p>
<p>Tenner said the government does not have the capacity to contain the virus, and criticised the military for being too &ldquo;busy bombing and killing in Rakhine State and other ethnic areas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a global epidemic situation it would be good to see the end of offensives against ethnic people,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Those living in Myanmar&rsquo;s makeshift camps for people displaced by civil conflict are also bracing for a possible crisis. Human Rights Watch called the camps, which are home to an estimated 350,000 people, &ldquo;COVID-19 tinderboxes&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Years of conflict, neglect, and abusive policies by Myanmar&rsquo;s government and military have left hundreds of thousands of displaced people sitting in the path of a public health catastrophe,&rdquo; said HRW&rsquo;s Asia Director Brad Adams in a statement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Knife&rsquo;s edge&rsquo;</p>
<p>Myanmar&rsquo;s poor also face the difficult choice between potentially exposing themselves to the virus, or taking an income hit they simply cannot afford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many Myanmar people live on a knife&rsquo;s edge of livelihoods and food security,&rdquo; said Mathieson. &ldquo;Myanmar&rsquo;s poor will be the ones who suffer the most from any pandemic, and any extended shutdown without significant government and private food supplies and sustainability will drive many communities to desperation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even as restaurants and bars across Yangon shut down over the weekend, taxi drivers continued calling out to the rare pedestrians on the street, offering rides.</p>
<p>They said they knew the risk, but felt they had no other choice. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t drive, I don&rsquo;t eat,&rdquo; said one.</p>
<p>Bay works with domestic workers who feel the same way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the girls who are domestic workers think that their job is risky now, and they are worried that they come in contact with people that have the virus &hellip; but they don&rsquo;t feel they can refuse because they are afraid they will be fired,&rdquo; she said.

<h3 id="covid-19-restores-myanmar-militarys-lost-powers">Covid-19 restores Myanmar military’s lost powers</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Myanmar-Covid-19-Yangon-Mall-April-1-2020.jpg?fit=1200%2C752&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
CHIANG MAI – After weeks of implausible official denials, Myanmar is finally facing up to the reality of its Covid-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>The nation may also soon face a new political reality as the powerful military, or Tatmadaw, leverages the situation to roll back recently restored democratic rights and reimpose strict social and media controls harking to its previous junta rule.</p>
<p>On April 2, Myanmar acknowledged 16 coronavirus cases and one death from the pneumonia-like disease. But with only a few hundred people tested nationwide and in sight of the country’s abysmally poor medical infrastructure, even health officials believe those figures are likely only the tip of the Covid-19 iceberg.</p>
<p>In mid-March, State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi’s government formed a 21-member committee she now heads to broadly manage the country’s Covid-19 situation.</p>
<p>On March 30, in a move some see as a Tatmadaw power play, another ten-member Covid-19 task force was formed to investigate cases, trace contacts of confirmed cases and clamp down including through arrests on “fake news” and “disinformation” that could cause “panic among the people.”</p>

<p>The newer and more powerful task force significantly does not include Suu Kyi or even her health minister, an oddity considering the body’s Covid-19 containing remit.</p>
<p>Rather, it is headed by First Vice President Myint Swe, former general known for his past record of arrests and crackdowns, including a lead role in the lethal clampdown on the 2007 Buddhist-monk led “Saffron Revolution” protest.</p>
<p>Other task force members include all three military-appointed members of Suu Kyi’s Cabinet, namely the ministers of defense, home affairs and border affairs, and Lieutenant General Mya Tun Oo, the powerful joint chief of staff of the defense services. Five civilian ministers are also included.</p>
<p>Although the government has not formally declared a state of emergency, the new committee’s sweeping powers and the fact that it is headed by a former powerful general means that the Tatmadaw effectively back in the driver’s seat and no longer restricted in exercising power from behind a quasi-democratic façade fronted by Suu Kyi.</p>
<p>The Tatmadaw started to flex its muscles before the virus crisis hit.</p>
<p>The new military-steered committee was formed only weeks after Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) party failed to nip the Tatmadaw’s still strong political power, legally guaranteed through a 25% appointed bloc in Parliament, though votes in March to amend the military-drafted 2008 constitution.</p>

<p>In order to change key clauses in the charter 75% of MPs must vote in favor, giving the military’s appointees collective veto power over changes that could diminish Tatmadaw interests. With elections scheduled for November, the NLD can now at least claimed it tried and failed to roll back the military’s power.</p>
<p>Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the military’s commander-in-chief, declared after the NLD’s failed move that the Tatmadaw needed its guaranteed bloc in Parliament “as a measure to ensure national stability.”</p>
<p>But the term “national stability” is laden with new meaning in the Covid-19 era. Freedom of speech and the press are already under renewed assault as the Tatmadaw launches a fierce crackdown on independent media it clearly believes have connections to the insurgent Arakan Army (AA).</p>
<p>Although not directly related to the virus crisis, the measures show what the Tatmadaw can get away with in the new Covid-19 influenced political climate of fear and loathing.</p>
<p>Nay Lin, editor of the English and Myanmar-language Voice of Myanmar news site was arrested on Monday and could face life in prison for publishing an interview with an AA spokesman.</p>
<p>On March 23, the government designated AA as a terrorist organization, making contacts with the rebel group active in Rakhine and Chin states a criminal offense punishable by life in prison.</p>

<p>Three other Myanmar news services, namely Narinjara, Mandalay Indepth News and Mekong News, have also been targeted, with all of their websites recently blocked.</p>
<p>The Tatmadaw is also known to be investigating the funding sources of some of the nation’s best-respected independent news services, including those that previously operated in exile before the country’s political opening began in 2012.</p>
<p>All of those new agencies and websites have recently published interviews with AA leaders, including its commander Tun Myat Naing.</p>
<p>The Irrawaddy editor Ye Ni was charged in March by the military under a criminal defamation provision over his publication’s coverage of an AA-Tatmadaw clash that resulted last year in civilian deaths in Rakhine state.</p>
<p>Having failed to defeat the upstart AA, a highly mobile force with no permanent bases fighting for autonomy in Rakhine state, the Tatmadaw has turned against what they consider its “PR network” — i.e. the media — and its funding sources.</p>
<p>Recent massive drug busts in northern Shan state should be viewed in this perspective, intelligence sources say.</p>
<p>In May, the Tatmadaw claimed to upend three major drug laboratories and capture 43 million methamphetamine pills, a suspected source of AA revenues through sales it allegedly facilitates in Bangladesh and India.</p>
<p>Singapore authorities, meanwhile, have begun to crack down on the activities of Rakhine (Arakanese) support groups active in the city-state, while ties have been established with military intelligence officials in Thailand to take action against Rakhine exiles there who are suspected of having AA ties.</p>

<p>These military actions are not likely to attract much attention or protest amid the global Covid-19 crisis, though rights groups are starting to clamor about the gathering Internet and media clampdowns.</p>
<p>The Tatmadaw, meanwhile, is settling into its new status as the undisputed defender of the nation in a health emergency, while Suu Kyi’s elected civilian government for the first time since it was formed in 2015 is being forced to make major concessions to armed forces instead of vice versa.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 crisis, while still incipient in Myanmar with unknown consequences ahead, is giving rise to a new military-dominant order that once established will be hard to roll back.
