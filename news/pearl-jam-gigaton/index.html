Before they had anything—a legion of devoted fans, walls of platinum records, a destination festival—Pearl Jam had a community. In the Seattle grunge scene of the early ’90s, they emerged as part of a larger mosaic, members of a supergroup before their debut even came out. This support from contemporaries is likely what empowered Pearl Jam to find their voice, writing earnest, soaring rock songs inspired by punk but delivered as arena anthems in jam band-style marathon live sets. Now that they are an industry all to themselves, their origin story might seem like a footnote—especially in 2020, when they remain the last band intact from their particular scene. But this sense of uplift still defines their work.</p>
<p>Communal goodwill is the saving grace of Gigaton, their eleventh studio album and first in nearly seven years. At 57 minutes, it’s their longest album, as well as the one that took the longest to complete. You feel the weight of both durations throughout. The ballads stretch out slowly, and the uptempo numbers are derailed by meandering build-ups, like stopping for a chat while running in place mid-jog. From the curveball disco-rock of first single “Dance of the Clairvoyants”—a portal into an alternate universe where David Byrne produced the Who to soundtrack an ’80s action film—the band immediately forecasted an attempt to revitalize its sound. In context, it’s more of an outlier: a reminder of their underdog mentality, that they have some fight left in them.</p>
<p>From the sounds of it, Pearl Jam pieced Gigaton together from various sessions over several years, with Vedder adding vocals to the choice bits after the fact. It’s hard to imagine this process leading toward a unified statement from any band, let alone one that’s already been having trouble finding inspiration. After records like 2009’s Backspacer and 2013’s Lightning Bolt combatted their dearth of ideas with low-stakes thrashiness—a throwback to the rowdy garage band that they never actually were—Gigaton attempts to reinstate their ambition. Co-produced by the band and Josh Evans, it’s filled with all the markers of cerebral, studio-born rock music: drum loops and programmed synths, swirling keys and fretless bass, wide dynamics and spacey textures. For the first time in a while, the winning moments are the slower cuts: songs like “Retrograde” and “Seven O’Clock” that evolve patiently into their atmosphere, as opposed to pro-forma ragers like “Never Destination” that never quite find their groove.</p>
<p>To unify this sprawling material, Vedder offers wordy, zoomed-out lyrics that directly address Trump, the climate crisis, and a growing sense of apocalyptic unease. And if his lyrics occasionally come out jumbled (“They giveth and they taketh/And you fight to keep that what you’ve earned”) or totally miss the mark (a reference to the title character of Sean Penn’s novel), his performance is as keyed-in and comforting as ever. For all the record’s studio experimentation, the moments that cut through are the subtle choices he makes as a vocalist: his anxious speak-sing in “Seven O’Clock,” the way he mimics the wordless refrain of the eerie “Buckle Up,” the seething cry of the chorus in “Quick Escape.” With songs contributed by each band member, Gigaton is an undeniably democratic statement, but Vedder remains their guiding light—the voice that allowed this particular band to outlast an entire generation of imitators.</p>
<p>The artistic rejuvenation that Gigaton aims to provide still seems somewhat out of reach. In that sense, it reminds me of U2’s No Line on the Horizon—another late-career attempt at experimentation after a series of back-to-basic statements. Both records indulge an influential band’s artsier side in mostly superficial ways—longer songs, pasted-in ambience, grand attempts at state-of-the-union philosophizing—while backing away from the actual subversion that made them exciting in the first place. Like U2, Pearl Jam have been able to sustain their legacy even without vital new studio work. But unlike U2, Pearl Jam seem content to deliver their messages to the already converted, with no interest in the mainstream attention that once came naturally. Their self-awareness both grounds this music and confines its ambition.</p>
<p>For a long time, Pearl Jam had an uncommon strength for asserting their individuality while pleasing the masses, looking to the future while staying true to their own history. On Gigaton, they admit they don’t know what happens next. Their message hits hardest in the closing tracks: the singalong strummer “Retrograde” and the fragile pump organ ballad “River Cross.” Both tracks forecast darker skies with calm, reassuring music. In the final moments of the record, Vedder offers a mantra: “Can’t hold me down.” As the music swells and his voice rises to the occasion, he switches from “me” to “us”—a last attempt to gather the community, to band together before the coming storm.

<h3 id="pearl-jams-gigaton-is-the-angry-but-hopeful-album-we-need-right-now">Pearl Jam&rsquo;s &lsquo;Gigaton&rsquo; is the angry but hopeful album we need right now</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/03/25/USAT/fc749377-3f62-4b65-bcd8-4d71d2fcb7cb-AP_Trump_Pearl_Jam.JPG?crop=4361,2453,x0,y47&amp;width=3200&amp;height=1800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" alt="img">
Music just hits different when you&rsquo;ve been cooped up in your apartment for nearly two weeks straight.</p>
<p>When Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder wrote and recorded &ldquo;Gigaton,&rdquo; the Seattle rock band&rsquo;s 11th album and first since 2013&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lightning Bolt,&rdquo; he never could&rsquo;ve predicted it would come into the world during a global pandemic.</p>
<p>But with its thrashing guitars, pummeling drums and anxiety-riddled lyrics, &ldquo;Gigaton&rdquo; (out Friday) is the sort of primal scream we could all use right now as many of us are sequestered at home filled with fear and frustration about our government&rsquo;s response to the outbreak.</p>
<p>More:Zac Brown Band, Pearl Jam, Madonna and more cancel and postpone shows amid coronavirus fears</p>
<p>An outspoken critic of President Donald Trump (at times, controversially so), Vedder calls out the president directly in two songs: In the bruising &ldquo;Quick Escape,&rdquo; he imagines trekking halfway across the world just &ldquo;to find a place Trump hadn&rsquo;t f***ed up yet&rdquo; and gets wistful about the past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we think about the old days Of green grass, sky and red wine, Should&rsquo;ve known, so fragile And avoided this one-way flight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He elaborates further on the rousing &ldquo;Seven O&rsquo;Clock,&rdquo; which evokes Native American leaders Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s Sitting Bull*** as our sitting president Talking to his mirror, what&rsquo;s he say? What&rsquo;s it say back? A tragedy of errors, who&rsquo;ll be last to have a laugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aside from its sharply political message, &ldquo;Seven O&rsquo;Clock&rdquo; also captures the powerlessness many of us feel to help the doctors, nurses and grocery store clerks who are fighting on the front lines of the pandemic, but with an ultimately hopeful message to leave your despondency &ldquo;in the bed&rdquo; because there&rsquo;s &ldquo;much to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For this is no time for depression or self-indulgent hesitance This f***ed-up situation calls for all hands, all hands on deck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For those of us who are fortunate enough to self-quarantine inside and work from home, Vedder reminds us that it&rsquo;s natural to feel overwhelmed by the state of the world and important to take the space you need for yourself. On the spacey, slowed-down &ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; he sings about turning off and tuning out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s alright, to shut it down Disappear in thin air, it&rsquo;s your home I&rsquo;s alright, to be alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not giving up is a running theme throughout the album&rsquo;s 12 songs, whether it&rsquo;s regarding a rocky relationship (&ldquo;Take the Long Way&rdquo;) or railing against a &ldquo;government (that) thrives on discontent&rdquo; (&ldquo;River Cross&rdquo;). That defiant spirit and resilience has long been a trademark of Pearl Jam&rsquo;s music but feels all the more reassuring in these uncertain times.

<h3 id="pearl-jam-releases-its-most-striking-album-in-20-years-with-gigaton">Pearl Jam releases its most striking album in 20 years with ‘Gigaton’</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Pearl-Jam-Gigaton-Artwork-tzr-780x502.jpg" alt="img">
Album review</p>
<p>Pearl Jam and its grunge-era brethren are officially classic rock. It’s been an entire generation since Eddie and the boys were hailed as the voice of theirs. Nineties teens can now tell their children of a distant time when musicians with guitars roamed the MTV airwaves currently occupied by “Teen Mom OG” and “Jersey Shore Family Vacation.”</p>
<p>On March 27, Pearl Jam will break the longest album drought of its career with the release of “Gigaton” — the Seattle juggernauts’ first studio effort since 2013’s “Lightning Bolt.” And it’s hardly a tired spinoff.</p>
<p>At this stage in their career, the hometown legends have evolved into a cult-favorite live band, their shake-’em-up set lists earning them a rabid following akin to jam bands like Phish. Caravanning fans will pack arenas and stadiums regardless of the ’90s rock heroes’ present day studio habits, yet “Gigaton” is the work of a band unafraid to shake things up in recording sessions, too — just not as drastically as fans may have initially thought.</p>
<p>In January, dancey curveball “Dance of the Clairvoyants” became a certified talker when it was released as the lead single. With Eddie Vedder barking like a disgruntled David Byrne over a digitally steeped drum beat and funky post-punk guitar barbs, the synth-splashed bop sounds nothing like anything the Rock and Roll Hall of Famers had conjured in its 30 years.</p>
<p>While somewhat polarizing, it’s the most exciting and unexpected track the band has unleashed this century, perking the ears of some who’d tuned out ages ago and rankling a few of the die-hards. This sort of split is always a sign of creative health from a veteran band with nothing to prove. Down the road — when bands are able to hit the road again — “Dance” is likely to slide into Pearl Jam’s variegated set lists as well as the Rolling Stones’ disco-charged one-off “Miss You” did during last year’s stellar CenturyLink Field gig. And considering how well Pearl Jam pulled off the Talking Heads-evoking head-turner, it’s almost a shame these creative winds didn’t blow the band even further outside its comfort zone. It may also be worth noting “Dance” is the only song all five members share writing credits on.</p>
<p>The outlier’s closest sibling is probably the marching “Quick Escape,” which feels like a sci-fi warning from a future with unmitigated climate change. Featuring another round of mechanical post-punk guitars, the churning track with a shout-along chorus is punctuated by a supernova of a solo from a peak-form Mike McCready. Throughout “Gigaton,” the celebrated axeman — who dabbled in mixed media during Pearl Jam’s downtime — unleashes torrents of stadium-slaying guitar heroics with the restraint of a quarantined kid hitting the park for the first time in weeks.</p>
<p>Advertising</p>
<p>Lyrically, “Quick Escape” (which features the album’s most overt Trump reference) is the bleakest point of an otherwise hopeful record. Its heavy political themes were foreshadowed by the melting-ice-cap cover image, the photo taken by acclaimed nature photographer Paul Nicklen in the Arctic Ocean. With its drifting psychedelic intro, “Seven O’Clock” feels like a paean to flickering optimism, a coolheaded call to action in the face of political doublespeak and rising sea levels. Written and recorded before the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted everyday life (and Pearl Jam’s tour plans), the global health crisis only amplifies the period of existential dread in which the band’s most topical album in years arrives.</p>
<p>Whether a product of added time or fresh studio blood with Seattle’s Josh Evans taking over producer duties from frequent Pearl Jam collaborator Brendan O’Brien, the quintet seemed eager to experiment on its 11th studio album. But despite some stylistic dalliances, much of “Gigaton” is tried-and-true Pearl Jam. Midtempo rawk bruisers arrive with varying spice levels, with classic rock-indebted “Never Destination” serving as a highlight. Vedder comes out charging like a younger Springsteen with Whovian power and swagger. We half expected friend of the band Pete Townshend to come windmilling in after the first chorus. Meanwhile, “Comes Then Goes” is a classic Vedder acoustic ballad as savory as any. Instead of feeling cliché, his “the kids are all right” lyric comes off as a knowing wink to the past and future from a 50-something rock star with half a lifetime’s wisdom to draw from.</p>
<p>Ultimately, “Gigaton” may not appeal to anyone who hasn’t kept up with grunge gods, but it rivals the more cohesive “Backspacer” as a late-career high water mark.</p>
<p>If the kids are all right, so are their MTV-generation parents who refuse to settle for a reboot.
