<p>Hollyoaks star Joe Tracini might be bringing a smile to everyone’s faces in lockdown with his comedy dance tutorials, but the actor opened up about his own mental health struggles.</p>
<p>Joe, 30, who played Dennis Savage on the soap, has been open with fans about his Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and the effects this has on him day to day.</p>
<p>Speaking to Lorraine Kelly on Good Morning Britain, Joe admitted that he still has days where he struggles but has found ways of coping with the low days.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>He explained: ‘So on Tuesday my brain kept telling me to kill myself and I waited it out, as I do.</p>
<p>‘If I just hang about, however I feel always changes, and I’ve stopped watching the news, there is no news for me.</p>
<p>‘Can I go out? No. I will stay here and put a leotard on.’</p>
<p>Joe’s comedy dance tutorials have been a hit with fans (Picture: Instagram)</p>
<p>Joe’s been entertaining fans with videos of him donning a leotard and putting on parody dance tutorials on social media, with comical names for the moves including ‘beef toe’.</p>
<p>Joe revealed he has to let the emotions come and go of their own accord rather than try and stop them, explaining: ‘I think that the one thing that I always do is that if I feel negative I don’t stop myself feeling negative.</p>
<p>‘Because it doesn’t go anywhere if I ignore it. I don’t tell myself “don’t be sad because someone has it worse”, that’s the same as telling myself don’t be happy as someone out there is happier.</p>
<p>‘It does help but I also have spent the vast majority of my life self-isolating since 1994 so when you are on your own hearing about people who are not on their own doesn’t help.</p>
<p>Need support? Contact the Samaritans For emotional support you can call the Samaritans 24-hour helpline on 116 123, email <a href="mailto:jo@samaritans.org">jo@samaritans.org</a>, visit a Samaritans branch in person or go to the Samaritans website.</p>
<p>‘But I do feel for people who do not have anyone there and I hope they are alright.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>‘Wait, that’s all we can do, this will change as well, we are all on pause at the minute.’</p>
<p>He told viewers: ‘If you are anything like me and you are thinking about killing yourself, don’t, because the world needs you.’</p>
<p>Good Morning Britain airs weekdays from 6am on ITV.</p>

<h3 id="coronavirus-uk-hollyoaks-star-dance-videos-but-can-you-beef-toe">Coronavirus UK: Hollyoaks star dance videos but can you beef toe?</h3>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/joe-tracini-e1585219235587_1585220518.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;crop=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">

<p>Hollyoaks star Joe Tracini is inspiring millions with a new online series of light hearted dance videos – which includes teaching you how to do the beef toe. Don’t worry, the videos ARE safe to watch!</p>
<p>The actor has spoken out numerous times about mental health including depression and suicidal thoughts and used his platform to discuss candidly his own experiences while reaching out to others and spreading messages of understanding and support.</p>
<p>Right now, with the UK in lockdown due to the Coronavirus pandemic, mental wellbeing and self care has never been more important.</p>
<p>Whether it’s funny videos, PE classes from Joe Wicks or a gardening tips from everyone’s favourite Emmerdale green fingered couple Zoe Henry and Jeff Hordley, many are using social media to suggest ways of occupying oneself amid this.</p>
<p>And dance has been known to release endorphins and positive energy – especially when delivered in the manner in which Joe is doing.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>His series is going viral, with his dance tutorials so far having reached an audience of over five million, which is staggering and brilliant all at once.</p>
<p>Seriously if you haven’t tried them yet, look no further:</p>
<p>To keep active through this, letâs dance together. pic.twitter.com/oLy7RgKogE — Joe Tracini (@joetracini) March 24, 2020</p>
<p>We caught up with Joe, who has written columns for Metro.co.uk as part of our wide mental health coverage.</p>
<p>He told us: ‘I’m so happy people shared my contemporary beef toe routine around the world. My incredible girlfriend Holly choreographed it with me, and we want more people to tell us which styles they want to learn so that she can teach me, then we can teach them.</p>
<p>‘I’ve had a deadly virus in my brain for 31 years, so this feeling isn’t new to me. I live with a partially suicidal brain, and the only reason I’m still alive is because I always try to find laughter. Even at the moment, with everything that’s happening, I’m looking for laughter.</p>
<p>‘Right now, laughter is playing hide and seek with us. It’s everywhere, so turn around, count to ten, open your eyes and start looking xx’</p>
<p>And now the much loved star and girlfriend Holly Houseman are taking requests on routines they can help you master.</p>
<p>Though we’re still trying to get the beef toe right.</p>
<p>If we’re in this for the long haul, then we’re definitely adding this to our daily isolation routine.</p>

<h3 id="meghan-markles-best-friend-jessica-mulroney-shares-hilarious-video-of-hollyoaks-star--see-it-here">Meghan Markle&rsquo;s best friend Jessica Mulroney shares hilarious video of Hollyoaks star – see it here</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.hellomagazine.com/imagenes/celebrities/2020040287334/jessica-mulroney-reacts-joe-tracini-hollyoaks-dance-video/0-419-443/jessica-mulroney-video-dancing-t.jpg" alt="img">
Since going into self-isolation, celebrities around the world have been delighting fans with hilarious videos, and Hollyoaks star Joe Tracini&rsquo;s latest clip has crossed the pond and reached Canada – with Meghan Markle&rsquo;s best friend Jessica Mulroney praising it for being incredibly funny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this doesn&rsquo;t become viral on TikTok &hellip; I give up,&rdquo; she captioned the video which she posted on her Instagram. The short clip, which shows Joe dressed in a leotard and making up a funny routine, was a hit with her more than 300,000 followers. &ldquo;I love him! Can&rsquo;t stop watching this!&rdquo; a fan commented, with Jessica replying: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To keep active through this, let’s dance together. pic.twitter.com/oLy7RgKogE — Joe Tracini (@joetracini) March 24, 2020</p>
<p>Another follower cheekily suggested her husband Ben could replicate the video: &ldquo;I feel like we should make all our husbands do this… in the outfit. #sexykitty&rdquo;. And it seems Ben Mulroney thought it was a good idea, with him replying: &ldquo;Already working on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hollyoaks star Joe initially shared the video with his fans four days ago and it was watched by over two million people in just one day. Taking to Twitter, the star said: &ldquo;If you were one of the 2 million people across the internet that chose to watch this in a day, thank you from the bottom of my leotard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe, whose father is comedian Joe Pasquale, made the hilarious clip with the help of his girlfriend Holly Houseman and has vowed to do more, even asking followers to request a style they would like to see him attempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To keep active through this, let’s dance together. I made this with my incredible girlfriend @hollyhouseman,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And we want to do more. Reply to this with which active dance activity style tutorial you want us to provide for you in the coming weeks. #beeftoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe joined the Channel 4 soap in 2011 and stayed until 2014, making a special appearance in 2018. Since leaving Hollyoaks he can be seen hosting the CBBC DIY series The Dengineers with Lauren Layfield.
