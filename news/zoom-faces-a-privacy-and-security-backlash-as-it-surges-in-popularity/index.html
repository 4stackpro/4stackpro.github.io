Zoom has exploded in popularity as people turn to video calling software amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The moment of huge growth has seen Zoom rocket to the top of iOS and Android app stores as people gather around it for yoga classes, school lessons, and virtual nights out. Even the UK government has been holding daily cabinet meetings over Zoom.</p>
<p>With all this extra attention, Zoom is now facing a huge privacy and security backlash as security experts, privacy advocates, lawmakers, and even the FBI warn that Zoom’s default settings aren’t secure enough. Zoom now risks becoming a victim of its own success.</p>
<p>Zoom has battled security and privacy concerns before. Apple was forced to step in and silently remove Zoom software from Macs last year after a serious security vulnerability let websites hijack Mac cameras. In recent weeks, scrutiny over Zoom’s security practices has intensified, with a lot of the concern focused on its default settings and the mechanisms that make the app so easy to use.</p>
<p>Each Zoom call has a randomly generated ID number between 9 and 11 digits long that’s used by participants to gain access to a meeting. Researchers have found that these meeting IDs are easy to guess and even brute forceable, allowing anyone to get into meetings.</p>
<p>This morning I chaired the first ever digital Cabinet.</p>
<p>Our message to the public is: stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives. #StayHomeSaveLives pic.twitter.com/pgeRc3FHIp — Boris Johnson #StayHomeSaveLives (@BorisJohnson) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>Part of this ease of use has led to the “Zoombombing” phenomenon, where pranksters join Zoom calls and broadcast porn or shock videos. At fault here are Zoom’s default settings which don’t encourage a password to be set for meetings, and allow any participants to share their screen. Zoom adjusted these default settings for education accounts last week, “in an effort to increase security and privacy for meetings.” For everyone else, you’ll need to tweak your Zoom settings to ensure this never happens.</p>
<p>Zoombombing was the first of many recent Zoom security and privacy concerns, though. Zoom was forced to update its iOS app last week to remove code that sent device data to Facebook. Zoom then had to rewrite parts of its privacy policy after it was discovered that users were susceptible to their personal information being used to target ads. User information is also reportedly being leaked because of an issue with how Zoom groups contacts.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most damning issue came to light yesterday. While Zoom still states on its website that you can “secure a meeting with end-to-end encryption,” the company was forced to admit it’s actually misleading people. “It is not possible to enable E2E encryption for Zoom video meetings,” said a Zoom spokesperson in a statement to The Intercept, after the publication revealed Zoom is actually using transport encryption rather than end-to-end encryption.</p>
<p>Related How to get started with Zoom</p>
<p>Privacy advocates have also raised issues over an attendee tracking feature that lets meeting hosts track whether participants have their Zoom app in view on a PC or whether it’s simply in the background. A digital rights advocacy group also called on Zoom to release a transparency report last month, to share the number of requests from law enforcement and governments for user data. Zoom has only said the company is considering the request, and has not yet published a transparency report.</p>
<p>Security researchers and privacy advocates aren’t the only groups raising concerns over Zoom. The FBI is warning schools about the dangers of Zoom’s default settings for Zoombombings, and reports suggest the UK’s Ministry of Defence has banned Zoom while it investigates “security implications.” The office of New York’s attorney general also sent a letter to Zoom this week requesting to hear “whether Zoom has undertaken a broader review of its security practices” in light of recent concerns.</p>
<p>Zoom hasn’t responded in detail to the more recent concerns, but last week Zoom CEO Eric S. Yuan said the company was reviewing its practices in relation to the Facebook privacy issues. “We sincerely apologize for the concern this has caused, and remain firmly committed to the protection of our users’ privacy,” said Yuan. “We are reviewing our process and protocols for implementing these features in the future to ensure this does not happen again.”</p>
<p>Zoom is now facing lawsuits that allege the company is illegally disclosing personal information to third parties. Two lawsuits were filed earlier this week in California, and one is seeking damages on behalf of Zoom users for alleged violations of California’s Consumer Privacy Act.</p>
<p>As security researchers and privacy advocates continue to dig into Zoom’s software and practices, there are signs more issues will need to be addressed. Some are now discovering just how Zoom works around OS restrictions by using “the same tricks that are being used by macOS malware” to get its software on Macs. “To join a meeting from a Mac is not easy, that is why this method is used by Zoom and others,” says Zoom CEO Eric S. Yuan in a Twitter response to the concerns. “Your point is well taken and we will continue to improve.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, Zoom is feeling the effects of a rare moment for the app. The video conferencing app was never designed for the myriad of ways consumers are now using it. Zoom doesn’t require an account, it’s free for 40-minute meetings, and it’s reliable. The barriers to entry are so low, and the coronavirus pandemic so unusual, that Zoom is suddenly in the spotlight as a crucial tool for many.</p>
<p>Zoom may well be forced to tighten up the very parts of its app that make it so appealing for consumers and businesses alike in the coming months. The company now faces some tough decisions on how to better balance its default settings, user privacy, and ultimately its ease of use. Zoom’s appeal has been its simple approach to video conferencing, but that crucial ingredient now threatens to be its downfall unless it gets a firm grip on the growing concerns.

<h3 id="how-to-protect-your-stanford-zoom-meetings">How to protect your Stanford Zoom meetings</h3>
<p><img src="https://news-media.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/01094129/onlinemtg.jpg" alt="img">
Stanford University IT is warning the university community about reports of “Zoombombing,” which occurs when interlopers disrupt virtual events.</p>
<p>Stanford has already implemented a number of default controls to improve the security of Zoom sessions. But there’s more that members of the Stanford community can do to further refine these settings.</p>
<p>UIT has created How to Protect Your Zoom Meetings, a web guide designed to help users get familiar with Zoom meeting settings and configure them to best protect meeting and classroom space.</p>
<p>The guide also offers recommendations to help members of the community use Zoom’s in-meeting controls to manage participants and regain control should an intruder invade your Zoom session.</p>
<p>Among the guidance with step-by-step directions offered:</p>
<p>Start by disabling “join before host” on your Personal Meeting Room.</p>
<p>Consider the settings you use before a meeting begins. For instance, the meeting organizer can enable only authenticated users to join. Another option is disabling the join function before the host joins. Meeting organizers can also require a meeting password.</p>
<p>For Zoom-based classes, consider muting participants upon entry. Enable only authenticated users to join. You can also disable the “play sound when participants leave or join.”</p>
<p>To manage participants during a Zoom meeting, lock the meeting when all attendees have arrived. You can also mute all, mute an individual participant, stop a participant’s video, override unwanted or inappropriate screen sharing, remove unwanted or disruptive participants, and block annotations.</p>
<p>To manage disruptive or distracting meeting participants, you can follow the recommendations above, as well as limit chat options.</p>
<p>To ensure global privacy and security settings for Stanford Zoom meetings, the university has disabled the “allow removed participants to rejoin” option, enabled a recording disclaimer, disabled file transfer and enabled the ability to have a cohost with the same in-meeting controls.</p>
<p>You can adjust meeting settings for a meeting while you schedule it or change settings for meetings you’ve already scheduled. You can also change your default meeting settings.</p>
<p>If you have questions, call the University IT Service Desk (650) 725-4357 (5-HELP) or submit a Zoom Help request.</p>
<p>Visit the University IT website to see the step-by-step directions.

<h3 id="alcohol-is-soooo-good-trolls-are-breaking-into-aa-meetings-held-on-zoom-video-calls-and-harassing-recovering-alcoholics">&lsquo;Alcohol is soooo good&rsquo;: Trolls are breaking into AA meetings held on Zoom video calls and harassing recovering alcoholics</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.insider.com/5e8389f52d41c163405ef4e9?width=1200&amp;format=jpeg" alt="img">
Trolls have broken into multiple Alcoholics Anonymous meetings held via Zoom and harassed participants with slurs and mentions of alcohol.</p>
<p>AA meetings have moved to videoconferences as the coronavirus outbreak has forced millions of Americans to stay home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alcohol is soooo good,&rdquo; an intruder said to recovering alcoholics during a Tuesday meeting, a participant told Business Insider.</p>
<p>Zoom said it was &ldquo;deeply upset&rdquo; to learn of the incident and encouraged users to turn on maximum security settings.</p>
<p>Visit Business Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>The Tuesday-morning Alcoholics Anonymous meeting was going as planned.</p>
<p>Members of the New York Inter-Group Association, the regional hub for the recovery group, had been signing on to AA meetings remotely for the past week using the videoconferencing software Zoom, thanks to the government-mandated lockdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Then, halfway through the meeting on Tuesday morning, members heard a man&rsquo;s voice shouting misogynistic and anti-Semitic slurs, along with crass references to drinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alcohol is soooo good,&rdquo; the voice said, a meeting participant told Business Insider.</p>
<p>Meeting organizers quickly muted the intruder and removed them — but by then the meeting had been derailed and more than half of the participants had left.</p>
<p>The digital break-in was one of the latest instances of &ldquo;Zoom-bombing,&rdquo; a tactic in which trolls scour the internet for links to videoconferences and then harass participants. The FBI in Boston on Monday issued a warning about Zoom-bombing after trolls disrupted two schools&rsquo; videoconferences.</p>
<p>Multiple New York Inter-Group AA meetings have been the targets of Zoom-bombing this week, Business Insider has learned. The regional organization on Monday published guidelines for members to ensure their security preferences are configured to block intruders.</p>
<p>A representative for the New York Inter-Group Association did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>A Zoom representative told Business Insider that the company was &ldquo;deeply upset to hear about the incidents involving this kind of attack&rdquo; and encouraged users to report such incidents directly to Zoom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For those hosting large, public group meetings, we strongly encourage hosts to review their settings and confirm that only the host can share their screen,&rdquo; the representative said. &ldquo;For those hosting private meetings, password protections are on by default and we recommend that users keep those protections on to prevent uninvited users from joining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trolls have gathered in forums hosted on 4chan and Discord to organize Zoom harassment campaigns against classrooms, businesses, and support groups in recent weeks. One YouTube channel has uploaded multiple videos showing Zoom trolling — one clip appeared to show trolls flashing bottles of whiskey in an AA meeting before it was scrubbed from YouTube, PCMag reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Virtual support-group meetings have become crucial for people with addictions and substance-use disorders as the coronavirus quarantines prevent real-world meetings from taking place in churches, community centers, and other locations. A Business Insider employee who is a member of AA published an account this month explaining the importance of the virtual meetings during the quarantine:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are all in our separate homes. And that can be dangerous, because alcoholics are notorious for isolating, for withdrawing from social situations — sometimes with a bottle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you drink normally, you may be wondering, &lsquo;Why not just drink — even if you have a problem? Right now, while locked down, who could that hurt?&rsquo; I can answer that. I drank myself into the emergency room years ago. I know many people who did. Do you think hospitals need that right now? Do you think healthcare workers need to deal with millions of people whose immune systems are severely compromised by binge drinking?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if we need to drive someone to the hospital? I drove many times in a blackout. What if, drunk, I needed more booze and went on a calamitous excursion to get it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instead, I can try to be of service to someone who is alone or suffering. That service is what keeps me sober.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beyond the exasperation of having a meeting derailed, AA members were concerned that intruders could compromise their anonymity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very trusting group — I don&rsquo;t know what the hacker can see, but not everybody on the screen was changing their real names,&rdquo; the meeting participant told Business Insider. &ldquo;If they have me recorded, that&rsquo;s my real name and picture on the screen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how you can configure your Zoom settings to prevent disruptions from intruders.
