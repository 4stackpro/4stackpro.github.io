<h3 id="a-divisive-legacy-tariq-aziz-1936-2015">&ldquo;A divisive legacy: Tariq Aziz (1936-2015)&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2015/6/6/0c8f175775da458e84047f2e48fb7dcf_18.jpg" alt="img">
This recent death of Tariq Aziz, a high-ranking member in Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s government and the foreign minister during the 1991 Gulf War, marks the end of one of the last surviving members of the Baath party&rsquo;s old guard.</p>
<p>In his lifetime, he played a major role as foreign minister of Iraq, re-establishing ties with the United States in the 1980s, to only be arrested by the US close to 20 years later, making it to number 43 on the notorious 55 most-wanted deck of cards issued to US soldiers during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.</p>
<p>Tariq Aziz was born as Mikhail Yuhanna in 1936 to a Chaldean Christian family, but most probably assumed a generic, non-denominational name as to hide his religious background in a majority Muslim country. He studied English literature at the University of Baghdad, giving him the language skills that would later suit him well, representing Iraq as its foreign minister.</p>
<p>He joined the Baath Party in 1957, just a year before the fall of Iraq&rsquo;s monarchy to a military coup that would evolve into a revolution, transforming Iraq into a republic. The Baath Party in its early phases was led by an Iraqi Shia, and as a party that stressed secularism and Arab unity over parochial and primordial ethno-sectarian ties, it appealed to Iraqis outside the dominant Arab Sunni political establishment.</p>
<p>Assassination attempt</p>
<p>After surviving as an underground political movement, the Baath Party came to power in 1968, due to a military coup launched by party member Hasan al-Bakr, a respected military commander, who became president, bringing in his young cousin Saddam Hussein as vice president.</p>
<p>Aziz, who had been a former school teacher and journalist, and then editor of the party&rsquo;s newspaper, Al-Thawra, was appointed to Iraq&rsquo;s highest executive body, the Revolutionary Command Council in 1977, and two years later was promoted to deputy minister of Iraq, the same year Saddam Hussein assumed the presidency.</p>
<p>Having read thousands of captured Iraqi state documents for my doctoral thesis, his signature never appeared on any execution orders or military orders against the Kurds, the Kuwaitis, Iranians, or fellow Iraqis.</p>
<p>It was an allegedly Iranian-sponsored assassination attempt on Aziz&rsquo;s life in April 1980, conducted by members of Iraq&rsquo;s underground Shia parties, that served as one of the primary reasons for Iraq&rsquo;s invasion of the Islamic republic a few months later.</p>
<p>During the ensuing eight-year war, Aziz was also given the portfolio of foreign minister, restoring Iraqi-US relations, and even visiting the White House and meeting with Ronald Reagan in November 1984.</p>
<p>The detente with the US ended after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, and Aziz became the public face of the state that posed the first challenge to the US&rsquo; post-Cold War order.</p>
<p>He met face-to-face with US Secretary of State James Baker in Geneva on January 9, in the final diplomatic attempt to avert an impending war.</p>
<p>Weapons of Mass Destruction</p>
<p>It was during this meeting that Baker handed Aziz a letter from George H. Bush to Saddam Hussein, which after reading, he handed back to Baker, stating that Bush&rsquo;s language was not fit to be read by the president of Iraq.</p>
<p>It was also during this meeting that Baker communicated a veiled warning from the US that if Iraq used weapons of mass destruction during the war, Washington would respond with invading Baghdad itself and overthrowing Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>Aziz had little leeway to negotiate Iraq&rsquo;s withdrawal from Kuwait during this meeting, but it is likely he brought this message back to the Iraqi president, perhaps one of the actors who prevented WMDs from being introduced by the conflicting parties during the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>Aziz&rsquo;s post as foreign minister ended after the 1991 Gulf War, although it is uncertain if this was because of Saddam perceiving he had failed in this position. He retained his post as deputy prime minister until the invasion of Iraq in 2003.</p>
<p>Aziz had a relatively long political career in Saddam&rsquo;s Iraq. As a former English teacher, he did not pose a threat to the regime that career officers did, who had the potential to launch a coup, and thus were purged or executed throughout the Baathist rule.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Saddam had no reason to see him as an adversary, since as a Christian, Aziz had no hopes of eventually becoming president and rule over a majority-Muslim nation.</p>
<p>Aziz surrendered to US forces after the invasion and was later transferred to the custody of the new Iraqi government. In 2010, Iraq&rsquo;s Supreme Court sentenced him to death, implicating him on charges of the execution of Iraqi merchants convicted of price gouging, and in suppressing Iraq&rsquo;s Shia parties and Kurds. It was while awaiting this eventual fate in prison in the southern city of Nasiriyah that he succumbed to a heart attack.</p>
<p>The scope of his guilt</p>
<p>Having avoided execution, the question most likely to be asked after his death is the scope of his guilt in crimes perpetuated under the Baathists. Having read thousands of captured Iraqi state documents for my doctoral thesis, his signature never appeared on any execution orders or military orders against the Kurds, the Kuwaitis, Iranians, or fellow Iraqis. However, I have read a large sample of those documents, but not every single one.</p>
<p>On one hand, he was complicit by being a member of the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), the body that signed off on egregious human rights abuses to sanction collective and indiscriminate punishment meted out during the Anfal campaign against the Kurds or the occupation of Kuwait.</p>
<p>Collectively, he was complicit in being a member of the RCC, yet at the same time the RCC was essentially a deliberative body that at the end of each meeting would rubber stamp Saddam&rsquo;s individual decisions.</p>
<p>In terms of direct causation between policy and action, it was individuals like Ali Hassan al-Majid (aka Chemical Ali) that had a direct responsibility for implementing crimes during Anfal or the invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>The death of Aziz represents the former leadership of the Baath Party coming to an end within the span of just two months. His passing follows the relatively recent death in April of Izzat Ibrahim al-Duri, one of the most high-profile Baathists who was never apprehended and continued to lead the insurgency.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite the death of the old guard, the Baath&rsquo;s presence is still felt in Iraq through its apparent command of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).</p>
<p>From his humble beginning as an Iraqi Christian student of English at the University of Baghdad, Tariq Aziz reached the height of power as a member of Iraq&rsquo;s Revolutionary Command Council and as foreign minister. From this peak, he became a mere image on a card, the eight of spades, and surrendered himself to US forces, ultimately succumbing to a heart attack while in custody.</p>
<p>While his legacy has been divisive, and regardless if one sees him as either a victim or villain, he rose from obscure origins to the inner circle of Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s regime, and was a witness and actor in the defining points in the modern history of Iraq.</p>

<h3 id="tariq-aziz-iraqi-politician---obituary">&ldquo;Tariq Aziz, Iraqi politician - obituary&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://preview.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03331/2tariq-aziz_3331626k.jpg" alt="img">
Tariq Aziz, who has died aged 79, was the propaganda mouthpiece for Saddam Hussein’s Ba’ath party in Iraq, and the masterly negotiator responsible for Baghdad’s foreign relations during the dictatorship.</p>
<p>As his country’s deputy prime minister, Aziz, an English-speaker, cultivated a polished imaged. He was also, by necessity, a great survivor, side-stepping numerous purges and at least one assassination attempt. But his suave exterior could not dispel the fact that he was essentially a Goebbels-like apologist for a regime that committed rape, abduction and murder both abroad and at home, where Iraq’s Shia Muslims and Kurdish minority were often victimised. Indeed, it was for his part in such persecution that Aziz was sentenced to death in October 2010.</p>
<p>From a distance his status could often appear to be that of crisis manager – a mediator positioned midway between the Iraqi government and the outside world. But Aziz always lived politically in the shadow of his master and was protected by Saddam’s security apparatus. While usually impeccably polite, he could be abrasive and short-tempered with foreign reporters who had the temerity to challenge his version of events.</p>
<p>In 2001 his position finally appeared to be crumbling, when his son was reported to have been arrested for corruption. But even though he was no longer foreign minister, he retained his position as a deputy prime minister and membership of the Revolutionary Command Council.</p>
<p>During Aziz’s long career as Saddam’s senior diplomat, Iraq engaged in three major wars: against Iran in the 1980s, and twice against American-led alliances – first in 1990 after Iraqi troops occupied neighbouring Kuwait; secondly in 2003. The second American-led campaign followed two years after the September 11 attacks, when Iraq was designated part of George W Bush’s “Axis of evil”. There was no evidence that Iraq had a significant role in those attacks, however, and despite America’s insistence that Saddam’s regime possessed weapons of mass destruction, none were found.</p>
<p>None the less, the countdown in 2003 to a war that most accepted was inevitable pushed Aziz again into the international limelight. He mounted a violent attack on President Bush and his ally, Tony Blair, characterising America in 2002 as the “dictator of the world” and claiming that if ordinary Iraqis were unhappy with their government the Ba’ath party would not have survived two wars and 11 years of UN sanctions.</p>
<p>Profoundly loyal to his leader, Aziz, who usually wore a western suit and tie to meet foreign dignitaries, once refused to accept a letter from President Bush Sr to Saddam because he saw it as insulting to his president. He defended Saddam’s brutal policies on the home front against the Kurds and claimed the invasion of Kuwait was necessary because increased Kuwaiti oil production was dampening Iraq’s oil revenues. In return Saddam referred to Aziz as his “velvet glove”, which led many Western leaders to consider him, wrongly, as a moderate.</p>
<p>Tariq Aziz was born in 1936 in the northern Iraqi city of Tel Kaif, near Mosul, to a Chaldean Christian family. He was christened Michael Yuhanna but later changed his name to Tariq Aziz, which means “glorious past” in Arabic, to achieve greater acceptance within the Muslim majority in his country.</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein and Tariq Aziz: he was always in the shadow of the master (ISF Photos)</p>
<p>He graduated in English at Baghdad College of Fine Arts and subsequently taught in a secondary school, but his studies had given him an interest in foreign affairs that led him initially to a career as a journalist.</p>
<p>Aziz first met Saddam in the 1950s, when he became involved with the revolutionary Ba’ath (renaissance) Party that seized power by overthrowing the British-installed monarchy in 1958. While his talent for communication served Saddam’s interests, Aziz was influential in his own right in shaping Iraq’s anti-Western policies, laying much emphasis on national self-determination and free will, and on Iraq’s right to distribute its own hydrocarbon reserves.</p>
<p>In 1963 he became chief editor of the newspaper Al Jamaheer and then worked for the Ba’ath press in Syria, returning as a propagandist and editor of the Ba’ath party newspaper Al Thawra (revolution) after the bloodless 1968 coup in Iraq led by Saddam and two others. In the run-up to the 1979 coup, when Saddam emerged as sole leader, Aziz was tireless in his support for his master as minister of information.</p>
<p>Aziz was rewarded for his loyalty when he was nominated deputy prime minister in Saddam’s first cabinet, a role which he combined with that of foreign minister from 1983. His prominence in Iraqi affairs was such that in April 1980 assassins belonging to the Shia Dawa Party attempted to kill him during a visit to Mustansiriya University. Saddam took revenge for his trusted servant on the would-be assassins by having hundreds of Dawa supporters executed.</p>
<p>Tariq Aziz and Saddam Hussein in 1981 (Camera Press)</p>
<p>The 1980s saw Iraq increasingly at odds with the outside world. Aziz sharpened his attacks on America, which he accused of seeking to undermine Iraqi stability, while ignoring the fact that Iran under Ayatollah Khomenei was a bigger threat to the Gulf region. Iraq’s war with Iran from 1980 to 1988 drained national resources. Aziz was prominent in the propaganda prior to Saddam’s offensive on the Khezestan province of Iran in September 1980, claiming before the attack, quite falsely, that Iraq had “no wish to destroy Iran nor to occupy it”. After the collapse of oil prices in 1983, Arab oil states reduced their backing for Saddam’s war, prompting a complaint from Aziz that “our brothers have stopped helping us”.</p>
<p>In the build-up to the Gulf War of 1991, Aziz became well known internationally. He argued that Iraq faced a real conspiracy from Kuwait’s alleged overproduction of crude oil, and denied that Iraq’s attack on Kuwait was anything to do with a long-running border dispute. The decision to invade Kuwait was “defensive”, Aziz later told the BBC. “If we had Kuwait in our mind for takeover, we could have done that in the 1970s.”</p>
<p>On January 9 1991 Aziz met US Secretary of State James Baker in Geneva, supposedly to negotiate a deal for a withdrawal by Iraq from Kuwait and prevent an America-led war. But Aziz rejected the letter of terms from President Bush, describing it as a “threat.” He was apparently then told by Baker that America would attack Iraq, thrust it back into a pre-industrial age and bring about regime change.</p>
<p>Aziz retorted that Iraq was an ancient nation with 6,000 years of history in its backbone. While he had no doubt that the US would inflict heavy military losses on Iraq, he told Baker prophetically that Iraq would survive and its current leadership would determine its future.</p>
<p>After the end of the Gulf War, and with the humiliation of American and British warplanes patrolling “no fly” zones in the north and south of Iraq, Aziz found himself stripped of his powers by the ruling coalition around Saddam. Yet within a few months, when UN sanctions began to bite, Aziz emerged from the bloody purges as a spokesman for the regime, lambasting fellow Arab states for “subservience to US hegemony in the Middle East”.</p>
<p>By 1998 Aziz was publicly re-established as Saddam’s most trusted adviser, and he was at the Iraqi president’s side during negotiations in Baghdad with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to allow weapons inspectors into presidential palaces. When Aziz and his colleagues returned to the room after Saddam and Annan had agreed a joint text, Saddam turned to the UN Secretary General and said: “Fine, you and Tariq finalise it.” The meeting was seen as a propaganda coup for Saddam and Aziz, because Annan announced the deal, which was accepted a few weeks later by the UN Security Council, without consulting America.</p>

<p>Ultimately, however, American patience with Saddam’s obfuscation over his non-existent weapons of mass destruction ran out, and as troops gathered to invade Iraq in 2003, Aziz was once again called on to secure a last-ditch peace deal. Though he travelled to the Vatican, claiming that Iraq wanted to co-operate on disarmament, soon the tanks were rolling into Baghdad. Within weeks he had surrendered to American forces.</p>
<p>Two years later letters written by Aziz in jail were published in The Observer, claiming that prisoners were unwell and ill-treated and not allowed to receive parcels or visits from family members. When visits were eventually allowed, Aziz’s son said his father was in poor health. None the less, he went on trial in April 2008, accused of playing a role in the deaths of dozens of traders who were accused of price fixing and profiteering in 1992 during UN sanctions and summarily executed. A year later he was sentenced to 15 years in jail.</p>
<p>His death sentence was delivered on October 26 2010, after a court found him guilty of leading a campaign of persecution against Shia Muslims, but the sentence was never carried out.</p>
<p>Tariq Aziz is survived by his wife, two sons and two daughters.</p>
<p>Tariq Aziz, born 1936, died June 5 2015

<p><img src="https://theintercept.imgix.net/wp-uploads/sites/1/2019/11/LON44956-1573852133-e1573852228825.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;q=90&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1200&amp;h=800" alt="img">
A bout a month before the United States invaded Iraq in March 2003, Tariq Aziz, one of Saddam Hussein’s most trusted comrades, sat in his office in Baghdad in an olive green uniform, cigar in hand, wearing house slippers. The man who for decades had served as the public face of high-stakes Iraqi diplomacy offered a political analysis that might well have gotten him executed in years past. “The U.S. can overthrow Saddam Hussein,” said Aziz, an Iraqi Christian and one of the most senior figures in Saddam’s government. “You can destroy the Baath Party and secular Arab nationalism.” But, he warned, “America will open a Pandora’s box that it will never be able to close.” The iron-fisted rule of Saddam, draped in the veneer of Arab nationalism, he argued, was the only effective way to deal with forces like Al Qaeda or prevent an expansion of Iranian influence in the region. When the U.S. invaded, Aziz was the eight of spades in the card deck the Pentagon created to publicize its high-value targets. He was ultimately captured, held in a makeshift prison at the Baghdad airport, and forced to dig a hole in the ground to use as a latrine. He died in custody of a heart attack in June 2015. But Aziz lived long enough to watch exactly what he warned of come to pass, accusing U.S. President Barack Obama of “leaving Iraq to the wolves.”</p>

<p>The 2003 invasion and occupation of Iraq marked the moment when the U.S. lost control of its own bloody chess game. The chaos unleashed by the U.S. invasion allowed Iran to gain a level of influence in Iraq that was unfathomable during the reign of Saddam. Secret documents from the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security, obtained by The Intercept, give an unprecedented picture of how deeply present-day Iraq is under Iranian influence. The sovereignty once jealously defended by Arab nationalists has been steadily eroded since the U.S. invasion. The country that Iran assumed influence over had been shattered by decades of war, military occupation, terrorism, and economic sanctions. Iraq is still struggling with the legacy of years of sectarian bloodshed, the emergence of violent jihadi groups, and widespread corruption unleashed by the U.S. invasion and occupation. In the face of this national tragedy, some citizens express nostalgia for the authoritarian stability of Saddam’s regime. Navigating this chaotic situation is no easy task for any foreign power. In the years after the 2003 invasion, some U.S. politicians cited the “Pottery Barn” analogy to justify a continued long-term presence in Iraq. It was the invasion that broke Iraqi society. So, as the analogy went, having broken the country, the United States now needed to buy it. In reality, the U.S. shattered Iraq and ultimately walked away. It was Iran that ended up figuring out what to do with the pieces.</p>

<p>The Disaster of De-Baathification A little over a decade before George W. Bush decided to overthrow the Iraqi government, his father’s administration had taken a very different path. After mercilessly destroying Iraq’s civilian and military infrastructure in a bombing campaign during the 1991 Gulf War, George H.W. Bush was persuaded that it would be too dangerous to march on Baghdad. Not because of the potential human costs, or deaths of U.S. soldiers in combat, but because Saddam was a known quantity who had already proven valuable in the 1980s when he attacked Iran and triggered the brutal Iran-Iraq War. During that eight-year conflict, the U.S. armed both countries but overwhelmingly favored Baghdad. More than a million people died in trench warfare reminiscent of World War I. Henry Kissinger put a fine point on the U.S. strategy in that war when he quipped that it is “a shame there can only be one loser.” Even after the war had ended, the American fear of Iran outweighed any appetite for regime change in Iraq. So Saddam remained. Bush’s son took a different view. In the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks, high-ranking figures in his administration began falsely connecting Saddam’s regime to Al Qaeda. In reality, the religious extremists were mortal enemies of the Baathists. But the process for Saddam’s removal had already been determined by neoconservatives who had been bent on waging war against Iraq years before 9/11.</p>

<p>Within weeks of the 2003 invasion, Saddam was out of power and on the run. A right-wing ideologue who had cut his teeth working under Kissinger was placed in charge of Iraq for a period after the invasion. The country’s new “viceroy,” L. Paul Bremer, once referred to himself as “the only paramount authority figure — other than dictator Saddam Hussein — that most Iraqis had ever known.” Though a longtime diplomat, Bremer had never served in the Middle East and had no expertise in Iraqi politics. But he had become obsessed with the idea that the Baath Party was analogous to the German Nazi Party and needed to be eliminated in its entirety. Under his leadership at the Coalition Provisional Authority, the U.S. implemented one of the most disastrous policies in the modern history of postwar decision-making: liquidating the Iraqi Army as part of a policy known as de-Baathification. In his book on the Iraq War, “Night Draws Near,” the late Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Anthony Shadid wrote, “The net effect of Bremer’s decision was to send more than 350,000 officers and conscripts, men with at least some military training, into the streets, instantly creating a reservoir of potential recruits for a guerrilla war. (At their disposal was about a million tons of weapons and munitions of all sorts, freely accessible in more than a hundred largely unguarded depots around the country.)” A U.S. official, quoted anonymously by the New York Times Magazine at the time, described Bremer’s decision more bluntly: “That was the week we made 450,000 enemies on the ground in Iraq.”</p>

<p>The impact of Bremer’s decision can be discerned in the secret Iranian intelligence cables written more than a decade later. Many of the Sunni insurgents who went to war against the government of Nouri al-Maliki in 2013 are described in the documents as “Baathists,” a reference to militant groups led by former Iraqi military officers. These groups have nostalgically identified themselves with the pre-2003 political order. The documents show that the Iranians have worked to either destroy them or co-opt them into the fight against the Islamic State.</p>
<p>As the leaked intelligence reports show, the sectarian bloodletting that started with the U.S. invasion has never really ended.</p>
<p>Many former Baathists also found themselves fighting in the ranks of ISIS itself, an organization whose military leadership has included senior officials from Saddam’s disbanded military. De-Baathification coincided with another ugly development in Iraq: the rise of sectarian politics. The United States played a critical role in this phenomenon as well. To take one example, the U.S. occupation authorities after the invasion went on the offensive against a Shia cleric named Moqtada al-Sadr. Sadr, whose father and brothers were assassinated by Saddam’s henchmen, was an Iraqi nationalist who spoke the language of the people, though he was often at odds with other Shia clerical leaders. Iranian intelligence cables from 2014 cite pro-Iranian individuals in Iraq expressing continued frustration with Sadr for refusing to go along with their program. He remains a thorn in the side of the current Iraqi government and Iranian interests generally, despite having lived and studied in Iran for many years.</p>

<p>Following the U.S. invasion, Sadr’s popularity rose after he organized social services and infrastructure to address the abysmal conditions faced by Iraqis, particularly in the Shia slums that had been brutally repressed by Saddam. When the Sunni city of Fallujah was first attacked by the U.S. in April 2004, following the killing of four Blackwater mercenaries, Sadr organized blood donations and aid convoys and condemned the American aggression. For a brief moment, the U.S. had very nearly united Shia and Sunni forces in a war against a common enemy. This situation was untenable. By 2005, the U.S. had become fully invested in policies that greatly exacerbated sectarianism in Iraq. It began arming, training, and funding Shia death squads that terrorized Sunni communities in a war that altered the demographic makeup of Baghdad. As the position of the Sunnis became increasingly dire, groups began to emerge that grew more and more extreme, including Al Qaeda in Iraq and its successor, the Islamic State. As the leaked intelligence reports show, the sectarian bloodletting that started with the U.S. invasion has never really ended. As late as 2014, the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security was documenting the continued violent cleansing of Sunnis from areas around Baghdad by Iraqi militias associated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.</p>

<p>Iran’s Calculation, Iraq’s Anger When the Obama administration conducted a made-for-television “withdrawal” from Iraq in 2011, large swaths of the country were still in a state of political and humanitarian collapse. The Iraqi state that had existed before the war had been utterly destroyed. For better and for worse, Iran has sought to fill the gaping void in Iraq that Washington’s policies created. Out of the rubble of the country, Iranian leaders saw an opportunity to create a new order — one that would never again threaten them the way Saddam Hussein’s regime had. The protests now paralyzing Iraqi cities are a vivid demonstration of how unpopular Iranian policies have been in Iraq. Several hundred demonstrators have been killed by security forces firing live ammunition into crowds. The sovereignty of Iraq was effectively annihilated by the 2003 U.S. invasion, but the idea of an Iraqi nation is still cherished by young people in the streets braving bullets to assert their independence.

<p>One year ago: Avowed racist John William King was executed in Texas for the 1998 slaying of James Byrd Jr., who was chained to the back of a truck and dragged along a road outside Jasper, Texas; prosecutors said Byrd was targeted because he was black. North Korea&rsquo;s Kim Jong Un arrived in Russia aboard an armored train for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said nearly 700 cases of measles had been reported in the United States so far in 2019; it was already the nation&rsquo;s worst year for measles since 1994. Hundreds of students and staff at two Los Angeles universities were placed under quarantine, after officials said they may have been exposed to measles and either had not been vaccinated or could not verify that they were immune.</p>
