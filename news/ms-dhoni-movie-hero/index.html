<p>Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his Bandra residence in Mumbai on Sunday. The 34-year-old was found hanging at his home and his domestic help informed the police about the same. The Bandra Police sent a team to the spot almost immediately to further investigate the death. The news comes days after his former manager Disha Salian committed suicide by jumping off a building.</p>

<p>Sushant Singh Rajput death: When the Bollywood actor left everyone in awe with his performance in MS Dhoni movie</p>
<p>The first of Sushant Singh Rajput films came in 2013 in the form of Kai Po Che, which was based on Chetan Bhagat&rsquo;s novel &lsquo;The Three Mistakes of My Life&rsquo;. The film was critically and commercially acclaimed, giving Rajput a great start to his film career. In his seven-year Bollywood career, Sushant Singh Rajput gave some solid performances which will forever be remembered by his fans.</p>
<p>However, the highlight of his short career was his impeccable performance in &lsquo;MS Dhoni: The Untold Story&rsquo;, which was a biopic based on the former Indian cricket captain&rsquo;s life. The movie showcased the highs and the lows of the cricketing career of MS Dhoni and it was produced by the cricketer himself.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput, who played the titular role in the film, took it to another level with his phenomenal performance. Sushant Singh Rajput perfectly nailed the role and managed to get into the shoes of MS Dhoni in the best possible way. He received a lot of plaudits for his quintessential portrayal of MS Dhoni.</p>
<p>ALSO READ | Sushant Singh Rajput suicide: Hina Khan, Armaan Malik share disbelief on actor&rsquo;s demise</p>
<p>In fact, during the promotions of MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, the former India captain himself lauded Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s efforts to get into the skin of the character and go beyond just imitating him. MS Dhoni revealed that Sushant Singh Rajput underwent 2-2.5 hours of practice every day for 9 months to reprise his life in every sense, from the way he talks to the way he walks. Fans, as well as critics, were in awe of Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s acting skills.</p>
<p>For the first time in India, a biopic was lauded to such an extent and rightly so because the kind of efforts Sushant Singh Rajput had taken to portray the character was commendable. When it comes to acting in a biopic, Sushant Singh Rajput took a leaf out of Hollywood&rsquo;s book as he nailed the character flawlessly. The film did wonders at the box office as it earned ₹216 crore. It could be fair to say that Rajput played a huge role in raising the standards of sports biopics as prior to him, no major Indian cricketer or sportsperson for that matter was shown on the screen with such aplomb.</p>

<p>Sushant Singh Rajput death: When Sachin Tendulkar took notice of the Bollywood actor</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput had once shared an anecdote where Sachin Tendulkar watched him bat during the time he used to practice for his role in the MS Dhoni movie. Sushant Singh Rajput said that there was this one incident that gave him an immense amount of confidence just before the start of the film. He added that he was practising at the Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) with Kiran More and Sachin Tendulkar was sitting in the first row.</p>
<p>Sachin Tendulkar was watching his son on the next wicket. He further said that it was the last 15 minutes of his practice which is why he was allowed to hit the ball wherever he wanted. He said that he hit all kinds of shots including the famous helicopter shot and just went on hitting.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput revealed that he was enjoying it because he had always wanted to play cricket but he could never get into his school team. He added that Sachin Tendulkar walked up to Kiran More and asked him who he was representing because, at the MCA, only the professionals who play for the state are allowed. But Kiran told him that he was an actor and he was playing Dhoni in MS Dhoni movie. The late Bollywood actor said that Sachin Tendulkar didn’t say anything but that expression on his face was priceless as it said everything.</p>

<h3 id="dont-expect-james-gunn-to-ever-direct-an-avengers-movie-i-wouldnt-do-it">&ldquo;Don’t Expect James Gunn to Ever Direct an Avengers Movie: I Wouldn’t Do It&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://filmyone.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Dont-Expect-James-Gunn-to-Ever-Direct-an-Avengers-Movie.jpg" alt="img">
Filmmaker James Gunn has been very active on social media during the lockdown, often organizing Q&amp;As with fans and responding to queries on social media. One such query came from a fan recently, who asked if Gunn would direct an Avengers movie someday. Gunn answered the question in the negative through his Instagram Stories page.</p>
<p>“I haven’t been asked, but I wouldn’t do it if I was.”</p>
<p>RELATED: Hawkeye Ranked as Most Valuable Avengers Member in New Study</p>
<p>With that, James Gunn has effectively shut the door on making an Avengers movie. Although the filmmaker does not elaborate, there are a few possible reasons why he might have opted for a definite ‘No’ instead of the ‘Maybe’ that is used by most comic book movie directors when asked such a question.</p>
<p>One reason could be the sheer hard work that goes into making an Avengers movie. Joss Whedon famously admitted that making Avengers: Age of Ultron broke him to a certain extent due to the amount of work he had to do to make the film happen. The Russo brothers, who have directed every Avengers movie since have also spoken feelingly about the herculean task of managing a story stuffed with dozens of main characters and interlocking storylines.</p>
<p>Another reason for Gunn’s disinterest could be his strained relationship with Disney. The filmmaker was unceremoniously fired by Disney from the MCU while working on Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. After a huge outcry from fans and the movie’s cast, Disney reinstated Gunn to the franchise. Although Gunn has since said there is no ill will between himself and the Mouse Empire, it would be understandable that Gunn does not want to extend his partnership with a company that would be willing to dismiss him so easily.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the DCEU, which has lured Gunn onto its team recently. Gunn is in charge of the soft reboot of the Suicide Squad franchise, and there are rumors that Warner Bros. wants Gunn to take on a more central role in the development of the DCEU, possibly along the lines of Kevin Feige in the MCU. If Gunn were to take up such a responsibility, he would have no time left for other projects, let alone something as massive as an Avengers film.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, it seems Gunn’s days at the MCU are numbered. The filmmaker is helming the final movie in the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy and has declared he has no intention of making any more movies in the franchise after that. Instead, Gunn will be taking his unique filmmaking sensibilities to the DCEU, and using them for The Suicide Squad, releasing next year.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the MCU is gearing up to get on for a while without an Avengers movie, or any sort of a multi-hero franchise team-up. Instead, the focus for the next few years will be on introducing new characters to the cinematic universe, the most prominent among them being the X-Men and the Fantastic Four. This story originated on James Gunn’s Instagram.
