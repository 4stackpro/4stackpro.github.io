The Bank of Canada today lowered its target for the overnight rate by 50 basis points to ¼ percent. The Bank Rate is correspondingly ½ percent and the deposit rate is ¼ percent. This unscheduled rate decision brings the policy rate to its effective lower bound and is intended to provide support to the Canadian financial system and the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The spread of COVID-19 is having serious consequences for Canadians and for the economy, as is the abrupt decline in world oil prices. The pandemic-driven contraction has prompted decisive fiscal policy action in Canada to support individuals and businesses and to minimize any permanent damage to the structure of the economy.</p>
<p>The Bank is playing an important complementary role in this effort. Its interest rate setting cushions the impact of the shocks by easing the cost of borrowing. Its efforts to maintain the functioning of the financial system are helping keep credit available to people and companies. The intent of our decision today is to support the financial system in its central role of providing credit in the economy, and to lay the foundation for the economy’s return to normalcy.</p>
<p>The Bank’s efforts have been primarily focused on ensuring the availability of credit by providing liquidity to help markets continue to function. To promote credit availability, the Bank has expanded its various term repo facilities. To preserve market function, the Bank is conducting Government of Canada bond buybacks and switches, purchases of Canada Mortgage Bonds and banker’s acceptances, and purchases of provincial money market instruments. All these additional measures have been detailed on the Bank’s website and will be extended or augmented as needed.</p>
<p>Today, the Bank is launching two new programs.</p>
<p>First, the Commercial Paper Purchase Program (CPPP) will help to alleviate strains in short-term funding markets and thereby preserve a key source of funding for businesses. Details of the program will be available on the Bank’s web site.</p>
<p>Second, to address strains in the Government of Canada debt market and to enhance the effectiveness of all other actions taken so far, the Bank will begin acquiring Government of Canada securities in the secondary market. Purchases will begin with a minimum of $5 billion per week, across the yield curve. The program will be adjusted as conditions warrant, but will continue until the economic recovery is well underway. The Bank’s balance sheet will expand as a result of these purchases.</p>
<p>The Bank is closely monitoring economic and financial conditions, in coordination with other G7 central banks and fiscal authorities, and will update its outlook in mid-April. As the situation evolves, Governing Council stands ready to take further action as required to support the Canadian economy and financial system and to keep inflation on target.</p>
<p>Information note</p>
<p>The next scheduled date for announcing the overnight rate target is April 15, 2020. The next full update of the Bank’s outlook for the economy and inflation, including risks to the projection, will be published in the MPR at the same time.

<h3 id="bank-of-canada-cuts-key-interest-rate-target-while-libs-up-wage-subsidy">Bank of Canada cuts key interest rate target while Libs up wage subsidy</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.thestar.com/2jZ3y4s8UGQOL4HKC9VxfC4can0=/0x0:3075x1975/3075x1975/smart/filters:cb(1585341113749)/https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/uploads/2020/03/27/cpt13451904-0.jpg" alt="img">
OTTAWA - Canada’s central bank made yet another unscheduled rate cut Friday to bring its key interest target down to a crisis-level low, and the federal government upped its financial lifeline to businesses in a two-pronged effort to further combat the economic shock from COVID-19.</p>
<p>It was the double shock from the novel coronavirus and a sharp drop in oil prices that spurred the Bank of Canada’s surprise announcement — its second unscheduled cut this month and third overall this month — to lower its rate by half a percentage point to 0.25 per cent after it started the month at 1.75 per cent.</p>
<p>The interest rate cut takes the key rate to what the central bank referred to as “its effective lower bound” or the lowest level that rates can be set, although they alone may not spur economic activity because workers are being asked to stay home.</p>
<p>Governor Stephen Poloz said there are still tools left in the central bank’s kit, but it was trying to do everything it can right now to deal with deep economic shock.</p>
<p>“A firefighter has never been criticized for using too much water,” Poloz said.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure that we’ve got a great market function and indeed that the economy has a great foundation for growth when activity resumes.”</p>
<p>Economists had expected the Bank of Canada to cut rates at its next scheduled announcement in the middle of April, but it needed to react to the extent of the economic damage to date to bring rates to “crisis-level lows,” said Benjamin Reitzes, director of Canadian rates at BMO.</p>
<p>Brett House, Scotiabank’s deputy chief economist, said the only reason the bank didn’t move sooner was because the previous cut hadn’t trickled its way through the system and brought borrowing costs down.</p>
<p>YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN&hellip;</p>
<p>What helped was a series of financing programs over the last week, he said, including two new ones that could be described as quantitative easing.</p>
<p>One of the new programs announced Friday will aim to alleviate strains in short-term funding markets, while the other will see the central bank begin acquiring federal government securities in the secondary market with a minimum of $5 billion per week.</p>
<p>Not long after Poloz spoke, the federal government announced it was upping its proposed wage subsidy for businesses to 75 per cent. A broad swath of business and labour groups had criticized the original proposal of a 10 per cent subsidy for falling well short of what was needed to avoid mass layoffs.</p>
<p>The United Steelworkers welcomed the change, but noted the subsidy needed to be available to all employers and workers who need it. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business said that backdating the subsidy to March 15 will allow some small businesses that have had to lay off staff rehire them quickly.</p>
<p>As one example, the wage subsidy may let financial technology startup Borrowell Inc. keep all 80 of its employees, said chief executive Andrew Graham.</p>
<p>YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN&hellip;</p>
<p>Canadians will get a better picture of the employment situation early next month when Statistics Canada releases its monthly labour force survey. Chief statistician Anil Arora issued a plea Friday for more companies to respond in multiple cities, including Toronto and Vancouver, to help get “the most accurate account of the situation.”</p>
<p>The Liberals said they are also working with banks to provide loans of up to $40,000 for small businesses. They will be interest-free for the first year and up to $10,000 could be waived for repayment if the loan is paid off by Dec. 31, 2022.</p>
<p>Speaking outside his Ottawa residence, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the government needs to hammer out the details of the proposal, which he hoped to provide by Monday.</p>
<p>Asked about paying for the measures, the prime minister said the government would provide a full costing to Parliament of what he called “unprecedented investments in the economy,” but didn’t say when details would be public. He added that the spending was necessary to “get through these coming months of restricted economic activity.”</p>
<p>The moves add to the value of the bailout package to date to more than $200 billion, including $52 billion in direct spending, $85 billion in tax deferrals for individuals and businesses, and $65 billion in loans. TD Economics, in a research note, estimated the boost to the wage subsidy could add $25 billion in direct spending to the total.</p>
<p>During an afternoon press conference alongside Poloz, Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government hasn’t put a cap on what it might need to spend to bridge the economic storm.</p>
<p>“We’re going to do whatever it takes to support Canadians,” Morneau said.</p>
<p>“We’re always going to responsibly look at what these programs cost, but that is not the key issue right now. We’ve got literally millions of people who are worried about whether they’re going to have the money to support their families in the coming weeks.”</p>
<p>Parliament’s budget watchdog said in a report Friday that the government has fiscal room to spend more, particularly with rates as low as they are.</p>
<p>The report from budget officer Yves Giroux, which paints one possible scenario for the Canadian economy from a six-month downturn, suggested the federal deficit for the coming fiscal year could be $112.7 billion — a jump of $89.5 billion from previous forecasts.</p>

<p>That number doesn’t include extra spending the Liberals announced this week to provide a $2,000-a-month benefit, for up to four months, to Canadians whose income dries up due to COVID-19. Nor does it include the money the Liberals will now spend on the increased wage subsidy.</p>
<p>An RBC report earlier this week suggested that a $200-billion deficit may not be out of the realm of possibility, depending on the depth and duration of the downturn.</p>

<h3 id="bank-of-canada-cuts-rate-for-third-time-to-025-in-bid-to-shield-economy-from-coronavirus-fallout">Bank of Canada cuts rate for third time to 0.25% in bid to shield economy from coronavirus fallout</h3>
<p><img src="https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/boc-3.jpg" alt="img">
The Bank of Canada slashed interest rates for a third time in a matter of weeks and announced plans to acquire more commercial paper and government securities to help shield the nation’s economy from coronavirus fallout.</p>
<p>The central bank lowered its policy rate Friday by another half a percentage point to 0.25 per cent, adding in a statement that the unscheduled rate decision brings the rate down to its effective lower bound. The Bank of Canada last cut rates to these levels in 2009, during the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>The move was necessitated by quickly deteriorating conditions, including a flood of new jobless claims last week, that suggest the economy is poised to produce one of the sharpest drops in economic activity in history.</p>
<p>Policy makers led by Governor Stephen Poloz announced two new programs: the Commercial Paper Purchase Program and the buying of Canadian government securities in the secondary market. The government securities purchases will begin with a minimum of $5 billion per week, across the yield curve, the bank said in its statement.</p>
<p>As the spreading coronavirus outbreak paralyzes economies globally, the energy-heavy Canadian economy is also having to contend with the crash in oil prices — prompting a steady drumbeat of recession calls.</p>
<p>The move by the central bank is part of a wave of policy rate cuts and brings Canada’s benchmark rate closer to most other advanced industrialized economies. The Bank of Canada has now lowered interest rates three times this month, with a cumulative easing of 1.5 percentage points.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve has also cut by 150 basis points this month. In addition to lowering borrowing costs, the central bank has also announced in recent days a slew of new liquidity measures to inject cash into the banking system and money markets and to ensure it can handle any market-wide stresses in the financial system.</p>
