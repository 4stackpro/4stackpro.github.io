<h3 id="mexico-closes-minneapolis-companys-plant-for-refusal-to-sell-ventilators">Mexico closes Minneapolis company’s plant for refusal to sell ventilators</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AP20102757095726.jpeg?w=1024&amp;h=576" alt="img">
TIJUANA, Mexico — The northern Mexico border state of Baja California closed a plant run by Smiths Medical on Friday for allegedly refusing to sell ventilators to Mexican hospitals.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Minneapolis, the company is owned by U.K.-based Smiths Group PLC.</p>
<p>Baja California Gov. Jaime Bonilla said the firm refused to sell Mexico some of the machines, which are badly needed to treat patients with coronavirus.</p>
<p>Bonilla said the firm had continued to operate its assembly plant under the argument it provided an “essential” service, when most non-essential plants have been ordered closed to combat the pandemic.</p>
<p>But Bonilla ordered the Smiths Medical factory closed, because he argued it was providing no such essential service to Mexicans, and thus was not obeying health emergency contingency measures.</p>
<p>“We said to them ‘if you want us to consider you essential, you have to provide some benefit to the people of Baja California, by selling us ventilators, because we need them,’” Bonilla said. “They said ‘no, we are not going to sell you anything, we are just going to continue to use your labor’.”</p>
<p>Bonilla accused the company of contacting Mexico’s foreign relations secretary and the U.S. Ambassador to try to stave off the closure order. But he vowed not to cave in to the pressure.</p>
<p>The company did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Industry sources have argued the factory is an export-only plant that operates under special rules that allow it to import raw materials and parts duty-free, on the condition they be re-exported and not sold on the local market.

<h3 id="commentary-in-tijuana-the-coronavirus-pandemic-has-built-an-invisible-wall">Commentary: In Tijuana, the coronavirus pandemic has built an invisible wall</h3>
<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4f2113a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3725x1956+0+308/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2F2d%2F8e46fda4408596cb3098b74a1d9a%2F521541-sd-me-border-business-at-at111.JPG" alt="img">
The new coronavirus has definitely changed our lives, not only in Tijuana but all over the world. We saw it so far away that we never thought it would become a reality for us. Now most of my family and friends are in quarantine, and Tijuana has lost some of its bustling movement.</p>
<p>Traffic, labor and social activities are nowhere near what they were. It is common to see people at the supermarket with face masks buying basic necessities. In a matter of one day, it was difficult to find disinfectant products at stores. Some people panicked.</p>
<p>free coverage as a service to our community. This coverage of the coronavirus pandemic is part of your subscription to The San Diego Union-Tribune. We also provideas a service to our community.</p>
<p>Scarier still, something very real in Tijuana is that a high percentage of the population continues to not believe the threat is real and does not follow security measures. I don’t know if it’s ignorance or lack of access to information.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>On March 30, the Mexican government declared a health emergency due to the spread of coronavirus, which led to severe measures being taken in all states.</p>
<p>In the city of Tijuana from that day on, many employers directed people to work at home, especially anyone over 60 or who has health issues like diabetes or hypertension. Yet there are other companies that continue to operate without abiding by the safety recommendations for their employees.</p>
<p>Some managers sent the workers home without the benefit of a salary. Many people are using vacation time, but it will soon run out. This has generated strong concern among workers not only here in Tijuana but throughout Mexico.</p>
<p>A week before the government decree was enacted, my company closed its doors. We advise the maquiladora industry on foreign trade matters, and the industry has had people with positive diagnoses of coronavirus. We are all working remotely now.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>That we continue to operate is an indication that this activity is essential. That’s extremely relevant since thousands of people work in the maquiladora sector in this city.</p>
<p>It is a quieter city now. Bars, gyms and beauty parlors were asked to close by government order because they are not considered essential activities. Restaurants are operating with takeout and delivery only. Schools and day-care centers closed two weeks before the Easter holidays.</p>

<p>Children and teachers continue to work in an online teaching classes. Despite the efforts of many families to stay at home, there are also others who continue as if nothing will happen, attending our famous markets on the streets — mercados sobreruedas — and visiting the beach or the airport to travel to enjoy their Easter holidays despite government warnings not to do so.</p>
<p>The most recent government data say that the state of Baja California has among the highest number of confirmed cases in Mexico, and that Tijuana has the most deaths from COVID-19 — 11 — of the 17 in the state.</p>
<p>But the crisis was already apparent due to the lack of supplies for the care of patients with this disease. The city hospitals do not have the ventilators that experts predict will be needed as the pandemic advances, so citizen groups are joining forces to be able to buy protective equipment for all those heroes without capes: firefighters, paramedics, doctors, nurses and maintenance personnel.</p>
<p>The problem in Tijuana mainly is that there are not enough tests to determine who is positive for coronavirus and most of the diagnoses are typical pneumonia.</p>
<p>Finally, Tijuana is known for being one of the border cities with the largest number of people crossing into the United States. Many people live in Tijuana and work in San Diego, and it is important for many families to shop in San Diego in order to sell items for their businesses or just to purchase items for basic needs such as food and clothing. Many people go to school or visit their families living in the U.S.</p>
<p>Coping with coronavirus The pandemic sweeping the globe has changed everyone’s lives, and we want to hear how it’s changed yours. If you’d like to write an op-ed for us on a subject related to the virus, make it 700-750 words and send it to us with your name and a phone number so we can reach you. If you have questions, email the community opinion editor at <a href="mailto:yoursay@sduniontribune.com">yoursay@sduniontribune.com</a>. We’re especially looking for expert voices and personal experiences. Thanks, and be well.</p>
<p>Too many people thought that a pandemic like this would not change the dynamics of our city. It has. Now, many Tijuana residents can’t go to San Diego due to the closing of the border for people with tourist visas. This has impacted not only local businesses in Tijuana, but the economy in San Diego, I’m certain.</p>
<p>This pandemic has created an invisible wall making it impossible for us to be with our loved ones even if they are a few minutes away.</p>
