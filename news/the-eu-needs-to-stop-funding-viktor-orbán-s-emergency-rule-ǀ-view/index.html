On Sunday 5 April, Prime Minister Orbán signed an emergency government decree in the style of a true statesman, seated in front of the flag, pausing briefly before his pen hit the page. A video complete with English subtitles was posted to his Facebook account, confirming earlier reports that, as a measure against the COVID pandemic, the government had decided to abolish charges on public parking. Such generous support for mobility sounds odd at a time when Hungarians are required to stay at home, with officials expecting infection rates to reach a record high in Budapest, in particular.</p>
<p>Regulating parking charges is a strange achievement for a prime minister who received plenary authorisation to manage the pandemic and its consequences earlier in the week. The Hungarian “Enabling Act” - a label detested by Orbán as it ‘conjures up bad memories’ - has been widely criticised as a power grab. From its inception, the law triggered concerns from the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, the European Commission, 13 national governments and even from within the European People’s Party (EPP). The EPP president, Donald Tusk, is reported to have written: “Making use of the pandemic to build a permanent state of emergency is politically dangerous, and morally unacceptable.”</p>
<p>While the EU’s response has been swift, it is rather too modest considering the threat permanent emergency rule by decree presents to constitutional democracy. Political statements from EU leaders so far have been ever so diplomatic; they do not name Hungary directly and contain not a hint of economic consequences. If experiences of a decade of dialogue on the rule of law are any indication, Orbán is unlikely to be halted by diplomatic reminders about good practice during a pandemic. Last week’s legal condemnation of Hungary’s lack of cooperation in EU migration policy provided further proof that the government can do as it pleases for a long time. After all, the CJEU’s judgment responded to government inaction from 2015. Thus, it is hardly surprising that so far, Orbán is taking a feisty stance, telling his European critics to leave Hungary alone if they cannot help.</p>
<p>While the EU’s response has been swift, it is rather too modest considering the threat permanent emergency rule by decree presents to constitutional democracy. Renata Uitz Researcher</p>
<p>If Orbán does not have time even for the EPP’s concerns, how - and why - does he find time to deal with the pricing of public parking in the middle of a pandemic?</p>
<p>The “Enabling Act” grants practically unbridled powers to the Hungarian government to rule by decree for as long as managing the pandemic and its harmful consequences takes. Emergency rule will last until parliament - where the government has a two-thirds majority - ends it. Parliament is kept in place to receive status reports from the government and dutifully process government bills. This semblance of normalcy is preserved in an effort to provide a veneer of constitutional legitimacy to a permanent emergency.</p>
<p>Behind this façade, emergency decrees can - and do - set statutes aside. Some decrees manage the public health crisis along lines familiar from other European countries. Others aim to neutralise even the traces of genuine initiative responding to the crisis that is not directly controlled by the government. In the official reading, such measures challenge the authority of the government. And as Orbán made very clear, he is determined to handle the crisis in the spirit of national unity and cooperation - and without giving in to the opposition.</p>
<p>As Orbán made very clear, he is determined to handle the crisis in the spirit of national unity and cooperation - and without giving in to the opposition. Renata Uitz Researcher</p>
<p>Sunday’s decree on public parking fees is a way to deprive mayors (whether belonging to the opposition or the ruling Fidesz party) from spending local resources in a manner not approved by the government, for example via replacing lost income or assistance to homeless residents. Parking fees are a major independent resource for local government, especially in Budapest, where the opposition scored well in the 2019 local elections. Another measure announced on Sunday diverts further local government resources; a newly-created disease control and economic rescue fund hauls income from vehicle taxes (a local resource) to a central pot.</p>
<p>These measures demonstrate the utility of executive rule over parliamentary democracy. On 1 April, shortly after the “Enabling Act” went into force, the government tabled a bill in parliament that would have placed mayors under the instruction of government-appointed crisis management officials. As soon as the bill popped up in the publicly-accessible parliamentary database, it attracted serious public disapproval. Instead of relying on its two-thirds majority in parliament, the government decided to withdraw the bill. Four days later, emergency decrees were put in place with more invasive effects.</p>
<p>As the video of the signing ceremony attests, Orbán thrives during the pandemic. In addition to chairing cabinet meetings, he also took to chairing the meetings of the pandemic response taskforce comprised of a significant uniformed presence; from police to immigration, disaster management and anti-terror leadership. When he emphasises that the government’s response is disciplined, secured by the police and the military, he does not simply mean taking advantage of supply chain logistics. In the middle of March this year, the military identified some 139 essential companies and has already took over management of 84 of them. Based on another government decree by the end of March, some 51 of 108 hospitals were put under the direction of a military commander.</p>
<p>Conditioning access to EU funds based on member states’ respect for the founding values of the European Union has never been more urgent - and has never been more achievable. Renata Uitz Researcher</p>
<p>Unlimited emergency powers present the most serious risk imaginable to the rule of law and the European constitutional order. Still, despite this very clear and serious risk, ample EU funding is readily available to the Orbán government. As of 18 March Hungary could access €861 million under the Commission’s Coronavirus Response Initiative. And the Hungarian government is clearly ready to boost the Hungarian economy with measures of its own choosing, preferably under relaxed EU investment rules.</p>
<p>Conditioning access to EU funds based on member states’ respect for the founding values of the European Union has never been more urgent - and has never been more achievable. Otherwise, the Union will continue to support a regime that has already demonstrated its commitment to abusing the unlimited emergency powers it arrogated. It took less than a week for the Orbán government to sidestep parliament and supress independent initiative by elected local representatives seeking to save lives in a pandemic. All it took was a few emergency decrees. This conjures up very bad memories indeed.</p>

Hungary’s Orban Given Power to Rule By Decree With No End Date</p>
<p>Here is today’s Foreign Policy brief: Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban gains extraordinary powers and faces calls for expulsion from the EU, Spain surpasses China’s coronavirus case total, and Saudi airstrikes hit Yemen.</p>

<p>Hungarian Prime Minister Orban Gains Power to Rule By Decree With No End Date</p>
<p>Citing the urgency of the coronavirus pandemic, Hungary’s parliament has approved a bill to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orban to rule by decree, effectively circumventing democratic institutions in a European Union member state. Notably, no elections can take place while the measures are in effect and the bill does not include an end date. Under Orban, Hungary has extended emergency measures before: It still operates under a state of emergency declared in 2015 at the onset of Europe’s refugee crisis.</p>
<p>The bill includes harsh penalties of up to five years in prison for spreading anything the government deems “fake news,” leading to fears over press freedom.</p>
<p>Once the result of the vote was clear, human rights activists across the world condemned the move. David Vig, Amnesty International’s Hungary director, said the move gives Orban’s government “carte blanche to restrict human rights.”</p>
<p>Former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi went further, and called for Hungary’s removal from the European Union, “After what Orban has done today, the European Union must act and make him change his mind. Or, simply, expel Hungary from the Union,” he wrote on Twitter.</p>
<p>Coronavirus spreads autocracy. Coronavirus panic has led to the curtailment of civil liberties in open societies worldwide, as the freedom to assemble and to travel is reduced to stop the virus spreading. In Foreign Policy, Florian Bieber writes that although the coronavirus is temporary, the society it creates could be permanent, “The pandemic may well lead to a serious decline in democracy around the world. It is crucial that liberal democracies show self-restraint and vigilance.”</p>
<p>And in today’s episode of the Foreign Policy podcast Don’t Touch Your Face, Amy Mackinnon and James Palmer investigate whether the pandemic could cause strongmen in Eastern Europe to double down on authoritarianism.</p>
<p>What We’re Following Today</p>
<p>Spain passes China. Spain has joined the United States and Italy as one of the few nations to surpass China’s coronavirus case total. Spain reported 85,195 cases on Monday as more than 6,000 new infections were recorded. Foreign Policy is tracking the pandemic with an interactive map, updated daily.</p>
<p>Yemen airstrikes. Saudi coalition forces bombed the Yemeni capital Sanaa on Monday as tensions rose for the first time in three months, following the interception of two Houthi-launched ballistic missiles over Riyadh on Saturday. The strikes hit the presidential palace compound, a military school, and an air base. A Houthi-aligned news outlet reported 70 horses were killed in the strike on the military school; no other deaths have been reported. The Saudi coalition said that Monday’s strikes were aimed at “legitimate military targets including Houthi ballistic batteries which threaten civilian lives.”</p>
<p>Trump dilutes auto emission standards. The Trump administration is set to announce changes to car mileage standards today that will effectively dilute the standards set during Barack Obama’s presidency and delay any manufacturer shift to more fuel-efficient vehicles. “When finalized, the rule will benefit our economy, will improve the U.S. fleet’s fuel economy, will make vehicles more affordable, and will save lives by increasing the safety of new vehicles,” EPA spokeswoman Corry Schiermeyer said on Monday. The United States is the world’s sixth-largest car producer and in 2017 transport accounted for 28.9 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Keep an Eye On</p>
<p>Indian police fire teargas at workers. Indian authorities detained 93 textile workers for violating lockdown orders after around 500 of them had to be dispersed by police firing tear gas. The confrontation began after police informed the workers that they would not be able to travel home as bus and train lines had been suspended. The nationwide lockdown has led to a humanitarian crisis in India as hundreds of thousands of migrant workers are left without jobs, and miles from their hometowns. In Foreign Policy, Rana Ayyub reports on how India’s lockdown will hurt the country’s poorest.</p>
<p>Cummings self-isolates. Dominic Cummings, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s senior advisor, is self-isolating after exhibiting coronavirus symptoms, according to a government spokesperson. Johnson was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Friday and is self isolating in 10 Downing Street. As the pandemic unfolds, Foreign Policy is keeping a running list of world leaders who have tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Taliban launches deadly attack. In a series of attacks across Afghanistan on Sunday night, the Taliban killed at least 27 Afghan service members, Afghan government officials confirmed on Monday. Although no cease-fire has been called, the Taliban and Afghan government are due to sit down for peace talks following the U.S.-Taliban deal on February 29. A long-awaited prisoner swap between the Taliban and the Afghan government, due to take place today, will now be delayed.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>According to the Associated Press, German Big Brother contestants were not the last to learn of the coronavirus pandemic—submarine crews may be the luckiest ones. Retired Adm. Dominique Salles, who commanded the French ballistic submarine squadron said that in order to maintain a focus on the mission, news from the outside world, including deaths of family members, is often kept from the rank and file on board the submarine. That means crew members coming off a 60 or 70 day mission could be in for a rude awakening. “No matter how serious an event is, there is nothing a submariner can do about it. And since he cannot do anything, better that he know nothing,” Salles said.</p>
<p>An astrophysicist in Australia had to endure a brief hospital stay after a homemade invention went badly wrong. Daniel Reardon was attempting to create a device that would deter users from touching their faces—a key directive in preventing coronavirus—when magnets from the device lodged in his nose. An attempt to remove the magnets with pliers proved fruitless when the tool was itself drawn to the magnets. Eventually Reardon sought professional attention, “My partner took me to the hospital that she works in because she wanted all her colleagues to laugh at me. The doctors thought it was quite funny, making comments like ‘This is an injury due to self-isolation and boredom,’” Reardon told The Guardian.</p>
<p>That’s it for today.</p>

Council of Europe Strasbourg</p>
<p>Letter from Council of Europe Secretary General Marija Pejčinović Burić, for the attention of Viktor Orbán, Prime Minister of Hungary</p>
<p>“The COVID-19 pandemic legitimately prompted Council of Europe member states to take drastic measures to protect public health. These measures are restricting a number of individual rights and liberties enshrined in constitutions and in the European Convention on Human Rights. Whereas the applicable national and international human rights norms allow for such restrictions, their severity may require the implementation of a derogatory regime in the form of a state of emergency, as provided for by the national constitutional order.</p>
<p>I am following the developments concerning the state of emergency in Hungary with great attention. In this context, I should like to underline that the measures which member states take in the present exceptional circumstances of the pandemic must comply with both national constitutions and international standards, and observe the very essence of democratic principles. An indefinite and uncontrolled state of emergency cannot guarantee that the basic principles of democracy will be observed and that the emergency measures restricting fundamental human rights are strictly proportionate to the threat which they are supposed to counter.</p>
<p>Also, democratic debate in national parliaments, in the media and the internet, as well as access to official information and documents are essential elements of any free and democratic order and of particular importance in crisis situations to maintain trust and confidence within society.</p>
<p>Our member states are rightly determined to address the threat resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, but this must be done in a manner that respects the fundamental values of the Organisation: democracy, rule of law and human rights. The Council of Europe remains ready to help them in this endeavour, including by making available all expertise and assistance which may be useful. I invite the Hungarian authorities to seize this opportunity”.</p>
