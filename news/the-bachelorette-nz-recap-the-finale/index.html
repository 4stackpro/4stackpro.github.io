SPOILER ALERT: If you&rsquo;ve not seen tonight&rsquo;s episode of The Bachelorette NZ and want to do so without knowing anything of the foibles of the blokes vying for the affections of bachelorettes Lesina Nakhid-Schuster and Lily McManus, do not even think about reading on.</p>
<p>Hey, can we steal you for a second? Because The Bachelorette NZ was back on our screens tonight. SINEAD CORCORAN recaps the action.</p>
<p>Good evening and welcome back to my nightly recap of The Bachelorette – the finale edition.</p>
<p>We picked things back up back on the beach where Lesina had asked Aaron to meet her for a &ldquo;chat&rdquo; - and you just know it&rsquo;s not going to be the good kind.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know this was such a hard decision for me but I&rsquo;ve decided I don&rsquo;t want to take anyone to the final rose,&rdquo; she told him through tears.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the final showdown - and one woman goes home alone. Photo / Supplied</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I wanted out of this experience was to find my forever person, and if I hadn&rsquo;t found that I didn&rsquo;t want to pretend that I had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And look, who can honestly blame her? I wouldn&rsquo;t have picked either of them either, and this show truly has proven that there are practically zero decent single men left in this country. Lesina, we salute you.</p>
<p>In the shocking finale of The Bachelorette NZ Lesina decided to walk away from her last remaining contender Aaron and leaves as a single woman. Video / TVNZ</p>
<p>Meanwhile across town Lily was taking both her chaps on their final fantasy dates – and first up was Jesse.</p>
<p>She whisked him away on a boujee helicopter ride to Waiheke where she tried to get him to once and for all tell her how he feels about her, but he was understandably reserved about putting all his cards on the table while she&rsquo;s still technically dating another man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really want to tell you how I feel about you, but every time I do I feel like there&rsquo;s something stuck in my throat,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just can&rsquo;t say it because I am really afraid of rejection, but just know that if you choose me I would give you my all – and seeing you with my family made me realise that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>On her final fantasy date with Richie she attempted to get him to reveal his feels for her too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever been in love before?&rdquo; she asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yup, but just with my sewing machine,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>The next day was D-Day, the last rose ceremony where Lily had to decide which of the boys she was going to give her final rose to / accept a hideous Pascoes (non-engagement) ring from.</p>
<p>First out of the car was Jesse, and we all know what that means because it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re going to end the episode with a break up, are they?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a beautiful, gentle man inside and out,&rdquo; she told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this isn&rsquo;t about you any more - it&rsquo;s about us now, and my heart is telling me it&rsquo;s not us. You make me really happy and I know you&rsquo;re going to make someone else happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not you, it&rsquo;s your blazer.&rdquo; Photo / Supplied</p>
<p>Next out of the car was obviously Richie because we&rsquo;re down to the final two (can you actually imagine if they flung out 10 more intruders at this point? I would honestly quit my job).</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the heartaches and hangovers were worth it,&rdquo; she told him while flinging the final rose over her shoulder, because this shit is finally over and we don&rsquo;t need them any more.</p>
<p>Me, throwing all these recaps in the trash because it&rsquo;s finally over. Photo / Supplied</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the person who I want to make me breakfast in the morning and I&rsquo;ve never been so happy to be a normie with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They waltzed off into the sunset and, unbeknownst to them, into an impending Covid19 lockdown.</p>
<p>Will their love survive the pandemic? Stay tuned.

<h3 id="the-bachelorette-nz-aaron-wonders-if-there-is-more-to-lesinas-final-decision-to-fly-solo">The Bachelorette NZ: Aaron wonders if there is more to Lesina&rsquo;s final decision to fly solo</h3>
<p><img src="https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/z/v/6/v/o/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.1zv6na.png/1585618270448.png" alt="img">
The search is over - but not in the way we&rsquo;d expected it.</p>
<p>The Bachelorette NZ&rsquo;s Aaron McNabb might have left the show broken-hearted and empty-handed, but at least he&rsquo;s earned some schoolyard cred.</p>
<p>The food tech teacher from Hamilton, who was the last man standing on Lesina Nakhid-Schuster&rsquo;s team but was ultimately dumped, returned to school on the first day of term to find he had several new fans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were all following it. I&rsquo;d get random comments when I was on duty in the playground. Some students even tried to move into my classes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>TVNZ Lesina Nakhid-Schuster tells Aaron McNabb there will be no final rose ceremony.</p>
<p>The Bachelorette mansion was certainly as drama-filled as any high school homeroom, and McNabb could often be found at the centre of it.</p>

<p>He played a crucial role in getting fellow contestant Liam Cochrane sent home after he revealed to Bachelorette Lily McManus that he had been boasting about having another girl waiting in the wings.</p>
<p>Matt Klitscher Aaron McNabb says he has no regrets about his actions on the show.</p>
<p>It was a move that made him unpopular among many of the group, but McNabb said he had no regrets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I definitely wouldn&rsquo;t change anything about it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My relationship with Liam at that point wasn&rsquo;t that great - we&rsquo;d talk and stuff but we weren&rsquo;t great mates or anything. I felt I was closer to Lily at that point in the show. In my opinion, I was just looking out for a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dubbed the &ldquo;Alpha Male Of Group&rdquo; (abbreviated to &ldquo;AMOG&rdquo;), McNabb said he thought his portrayal was pretty spot on - although he does wish producers used more footage of him looking a bit happier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the cocktail parties, I wasn&rsquo;t just sitting there looking angry the whole time,&rdquo; he laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was actually having a ton of fun at a lot of those parties. They only showed me looking real sour at everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In most scenes though, the emotion was completely real. He did get jealous easily, and he was heartbroken at the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was gutted - I was fully invested in Lesina and the potential of a future relationship,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He said he didn&rsquo;t hold any resentment towards Nakhid-Schuster, but was still not convinced she had been entirely genuine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do feel there&rsquo;s potentially more to the reason why she didn&rsquo;t pick anyone - more than just her feelings towards me or Logan,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;ll always have a special place in my heart and she&rsquo;ll be someone I remember forever, both positively and negatively. I&rsquo;m feeling like I&rsquo;m glad she&rsquo;s kind of out of my immediate life so I can start moving forward.&ldquo;﻿

<h3 id="the-bachelorette-are-we-in-for-a-second-season">The Bachelorette: Are we in for a second season?</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/-WtHZdD3RdftkzH_wJdsvFJRK8s=/1200x0/smart/filters:quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-syd-prod-nzme.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CG2MWJEFVZFTDD3WXY5NLPKDXA.jpg" alt="img">
Spy has heard through the grapevine that there will be a second season of The Bachelorette.</p>
<p>Casting directors will have plenty of time to scroll Instagram and Facebook, so we challenge you to audition at home publicly with the hashtag #SpyIwanttobeabachelorette or #SpyIwanttobeabachelor.</p>
<p>We have a hunch that when it is time to announce the second show, they will be looking at guys and girls under those hashtags.</p>
<p>We hear a new season of The Bachelor could also be on the cards down the track on TVNZ 2, so tips for your auditions are as follows.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>In 45 seconds, audition as a single person wanting to find love and &ldquo;the one&rdquo; on TV. Be honest and sincere. Decide what type of contestant you want to be on the show – so you can show that side in your clip to producers.</p>
<p>Practise your audition with friends and family on FaceTime. It&rsquo;s a great reason to put on your best single out-on-the-town look at home. It may be a public forum but if you don&rsquo;t get a casting call you might just get a message from &ldquo;the one&rdquo; and you can meet up after lockdown.</p>
<p>Tonight and tomorrow night see our bachelorettes, Lesina Nakhid-Schuster and Lily McManus choose the one … or will they?</p>
<p>Nakhid-Schuster has made no secret that she has three choices: leave with Logan Carr or Aaron McNabb or leave the show alone.</p>
<p>Former radio boy Jesse Williamson is through to the final two, with fan favourite Quinn Ryan and Richie Boyens waiting for McManus to give out her final rose.</p>
<p>The Aussie will spend the month out in a cabin in Tākaka - and no word on who she is with.</p>
<p>Nakhid-Schuster, a doctor, is based in Canberra working essential duties, with the hope of coming home once her contract there is finished and maybe help out with NZ&rsquo;s Covid-19 response. Tomorrow night we will find out if she is coming home to a reunion.
