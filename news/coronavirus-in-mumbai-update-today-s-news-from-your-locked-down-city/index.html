Three field level officers have also been appointed to take stock of the situation from the ground level.Pakistan has suspended all domestic flight operations until April 2 to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus after the country reported over 1,000 cases and seven deaths from the COVID-19 infection, authorities said on Wednesday.The nationwide tally of COVID-19 patients touched 1,037.According to the latest Union health ministry data released in the evening, the total number of COVID-19 cases so far in the country has crossed 600, which includes 10 deaths.

The ministry said 43 have been cured/discharged/migrated cases.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan also chaired a GoM meeting to assess the situation in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak in the country.The Centre has asked state governments to set up a round the clock control room with a helpline number at its headquarters and in each of its districts to ensure seamless availability of essential commodities during the 21-day lockdown enforced to combat the coronavirus outbreak.The Union home ministry&rsquo;s letter to chief secretaries of all states came in the wake of reports that those involved in distribution and delivery of essential commodities and services were facing difficulties due to the restriction of movement of people and police vigilance.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said he was very pained by the misbehaviour of some people against doctors, airlines crew and staff of essential services who are at the forefront of combating coronavirus.He also asserted that the deadly virus does not differentiate between the rich and the poor. He asked people to be at home and practice social distancing.Addressing people of his parliamentary constituency of Varanasi via video, he said the Mahabharata war was won in 18 days but this war against coronavirus will take 21 days.Union minister Prakash Javadekar has said there was no need for people to panic as shops selling essentials and medicines will remain open throughout the 21-day lockdown imposed to combat the coronavirus outbreak.He also said there were sufficient legal provisions available to deal with black marketeers and hoarders.He was referring to the lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday to prevent the spread of coronavirus.Iran announced 143 new deaths from the novel coronavirus, raising the official death toll to 2,077 in one of the world&rsquo;s worst-hit countries.Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said &ldquo;our colleagues have registered 2,206 new cases of COVID-19 infection&rdquo; in the past 24 hours, bringing total infections to 27,017.All students from first to ninth standard in Tamil Nadu will be promoted considering the closure of schools to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, chief minister K Palaniswami said on Wednesday.Considering the welfare of students, who could not sit for their annual examinations due to closure of schools, Palaniswami said he ordered the School Education Department to announce promotion of all students from first to ninth standard.For plus-two students who could not sit for write exam on March 24, exams will be separately held and a date notified later, he said.Coordinating efforts of the military in controlling COVID-19 spread, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat has said that at this juncture, the uniformed force needs to extend all type of assistance ranging from creating quarantine infrastructure to providing specialist care to help the nation combat Coronavirus.&ldquo;Uniformed forces are expected to support the government and provide every type of assistance from developing infrastructure for isolation and quarantine to preparing speciality medical care centres for those who need immediate care,&rdquo; the CDS said.The country&rsquo;s crowded grocery stores and chemists on Wednesday in a struggle for essential items after PM Modi ordered a total lockdown for three weeks to fight a coronavirus pandemic, one of the toughest such measures worldwide. As states shut their borders, long queues of trucks carrying milk, fruits and vegetables snaked down highways.There is no need to panic. After PM Modi&rsquo;s speech yesterday people started lining up at shops for essential services. I again appeal to people to not do panic buying, I assure everyone that there will be no shortage of essential services. We will issues passes for those providing essential services, E-passes will be provided to those who need to open their shops and factories for these services: Delhi CM Arvind KejriwalClouds of uncertainty hovering over Haj 2020. Saudis tell other countries not to make new commitments like booking hotels and airlines as it is not certain if Haj will be conducted this year. India has a quota of 2 lakh Haj pilgrims. Saudi Arabia is also fighting Coronavirus and has suspended Umrah or the smaller pilgrimage.Strictly implemented social distancing measures such as home quarantine can reduce the overall expected number of cases by 62% and peak number of cases by 89%, thus “flattening” the curve and providing more opportunities for interventions, a mathematical modelling done by the Indian Council of Medical Research shows.Home ministry asked the states to set up helplines for those engaged in essential services and to ensure unhindered movement of essential goods/services.&ldquo;While it is imperative to successfully implement the notified lockdown/restrictions. It is also necessary to ensure the unhindered operation of manufacturing, processing, transportation, distribution, storage, trade/ecommerce and logistics related to all service/establishments and commodities requires for the delivery of essential services,&rdquo; a government statement read.The government of Delhi has ordered the state administration to ensure strict action is taken against landlords who are forcing doctors/paramedical staff/ healthcare personnel to vacate their rented accomodation due to the unfounded fear of spread of coronavirus.PM Jacinda Ardern told New Zealanders on Wednesday to behave as if they had the coronavirus and cut all physical contact outside their household when the country heads into a one-month lockdown at midnight.

Besides, 118 government laboratories have been included in the ICMR network of COVID-19 testing. The network has a capacity to test 12,000 samples daily.The Centre has asked state governments to immediately identify and earmark hospitals to deal with the coronavirus outbreak. The Union government also said it is absolutely essential that surveillance and contact tracing of all positive cases is taken up and no suspected or high risk person is left out.India, which led the world in eradicating two silent killers - smallpox and polio - has a tremendous capacity in eradicating the deadly coronoavirus pandemic that has now claimed nearly 15,000 lives and infected over three lakh others globally, according to a top WHO official.&ldquo;India led the world in eradicating two silent killers and eliminating them from the country,&rdquo; he said during a press conference in Geneva on Monday on the COVIVD-19 pandemic.As many as 69 drugs and experimental compounds may be effective in treating the coronavirus. Some of the medications are already used to treat other diseases, and repurposing them to treat Covid-19 may be faster than trying to invent a new antiviral from scratch.Domestic commercial flights will stop flying from 11.59 pm on Tuesday till the same time on March 31. The Centre took this decision amid an increasing number of states announcing lockdowns and curfews that make commuting between cities and airports difficult for everyone — passengers, airline crew and all other stakeholders required to make air travel possible.Scheduled international flights had been suspended on Sunday (March 22) for a week. When flights resume depends largely on how the pandemic unfolds.In Video: Covid-19 crisis: All essential services will be provided, assures PM Modi
