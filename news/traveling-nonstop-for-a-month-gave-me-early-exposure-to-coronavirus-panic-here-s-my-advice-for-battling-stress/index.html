Traveling internationally for a month in countries with dozens of cases of coronavirus gave me an understanding of what it is like to live in a constant state of low-grade concern about getting sick.</p>
<p>While I was never too worried about catching coronavirus, I realized I had to take action to avoid letting the constant flood of news and anxiety about the evolving situation control my life.</p>
<p>Here are six things I did to educate myself and stay safe, without letting concerns about the coronavirus outbreak take over.</p>
<p>Visit Business Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>Traveling internationally over the last five weeks, visiting four countries with confirmed cases of coronavirus, gave me a window into how different regions are responding to the outbreak.</p>
<p>It also gave me a look into what it is like to live in a state of constant low-grade coronavirus panic before similar concerns hit parts of the US.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak for people whose communities have been deeply impacted by the outbreak. None of the places I visited (including South Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand) had more than 100 confirmed cases while I was in the country. But, everywhere I went was already feeling the economic impact of the outbreak and fighting the spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p>Closely monitoring the news and swiftly changing local warnings, fielding constant concerns from friends and family, and changing plans at the last minute gave me a taste of the practical side of what it means to be in an area battling coronavirus on a smaller scale. While I learned plenty of safety tips, I also learned how to avoid letting the coronavirus take over my daily life.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t an article where I&rsquo;m going to tell you not to worry about the coronavirus. Telling people to chill out feels reductive, especially for those in jobs with less flexibility, people who are elderly, and people with preexisting conditions. At the same time, experts say that reducing stress can help reduce the chances of getting sick.</p>
<p>As the number of cases in the US swiftly grow, I&rsquo;ve heard from people who aren&rsquo;t sure what to do. This is my attempt to explain what I did to educate myself and try to stay safe, without letting the outbreak take over every aspect of my life.</p>
<p>As I prepare to head back to US, here are my six biggest takeaways on the practical realities of dealing with the panic around the coronavirus outbreak.

Coronavirus Travel Tips: To Fly Or Not To Fly? What Happens If You Cancel?</p>
<p>Enlarge this image toggle caption Bim/Getty Images Bim/Getty Images</p>
<p>How safe — or risky — is it to fly?</p>
<p>Should I cancel a trip I&rsquo;ve planned?</p>
<p>Can I come home early from my trip?</p>
<p>These are some of the questions that would-be travelers are asking in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. We talked to travel and health specialists to get answers.</p>
<p>Can I cancel a trip I&rsquo;ve booked because I&rsquo;m afraid of the coronavirus?</p>
<p>Depends on whether you bought a refundable ticket or have the right kind of travel insurance. Regular travel insurance won&rsquo;t cover a cancellation because of fears about the coronavirus outbreak. For that, you need to buy a &ldquo;Cancel for Any Reason&rdquo; (CFAR) policy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve become quite popular in the last few weeks,&rdquo; says Jonathan Breeze, CEO of AardvarkCompare, a travel insurance comparison website. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing about a 50% increase in the amount of policies being sold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few things to note: A CFAR policy typically needs to be purchased within a couple of weeks from the time you booked your trip, it will usually only cover about 75% of your costs, and New York state does not allow residents to buy CFAR policies.</p>
<p>In addition, some credit cards have automatic travel insurance for trips purchased by their cardholders. Check with your provider to see whether you would be covered.</p>
<p>How do I pick a travel insurance policy?</p>
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all policy, according to Christopher Elliott, founder of a consumer advocacy organization, Elliott Advocacy. Factors such as your age, the length of your trip and what you want covered all figure into the decision. Elliott recommends reading the insurance contract before buying to check whether it applies to &ldquo;worst-case scenarios,&rdquo; such as sickness or flight delays. See this column for more advice.</p>
<p>What if I booked a flight and want to reschedule it to avoid traveling during the outbreak?</p>
<p>Several airlines — including American, Delta, Frontier, JetBlue and United — have been waiving change fees for flights purchased between certain dates. And even if your purchase falls outside that window, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s always worth asking,&rdquo; says Seth Kaplan, transportation analyst for WBUR&rsquo;s Here &amp; Now. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re asking for an exception,&rdquo; he says — but if you&rsquo;re polite and explain your situation, you might get a break.</p>
<p>What if I want to end my trip early, say, because the outbreak has spread to a country I&rsquo;m visiting?</p>
<p>In most cases, &ldquo;somebody abroad saying, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to be here anymore,&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t covered by regular travel insurance,&rdquo; says Breeze. Again, this is where a Cancel for Any Reason policy would come in handy. With many CFAR policies, a traveler can not only recover some of the initial cost of the trip, he says, but in many cases, the policy will also cover the additional cost of coming home.</p>
<p>Is international travel riskier to my health than domestic travel?</p>
<p>It depends. Shira Doron, a hospital epidemiologist and infectious disease specialist at Tufts Medical Center, says she would not recommend traveling to countries that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has put on its &ldquo;warning&rdquo; list to avoid nonessential travel, such as China, Iran, Italy and South Korea.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean domestic travel is risk-free. To put things in perspective, the virus is here, with case numbers on the rise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We already have community transmission within the United States,&rdquo; says Doron. &ldquo;So, at some point, it&rsquo;s not going to be any riskier to go to another country than it is to stay right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the virus is already out there, should I avoid plane travel just to be safe? After all, when you fly aren&rsquo;t you breathing in recycled air?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The air&rsquo;s actually pretty clean. It gets recirculated through these HEPA filters that really are very good at clearing stuff out,&rdquo; says Vicki Hertzberg, director of Emory University&rsquo;s Center for Nursing Data Science, who co-led a study on flights and disease transmission with scientists at Boeing. &ldquo;So in some aspects, the air on a plane is cleaner than what&rsquo;s going on in your new office buildings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moreover, Dr. Mark Gendreau, chief medical officer at Beverly Hospital in Massachusetts, says that airlines have a high incentive to keep their ventilation systems well-maintained: &ldquo;If the HEPA filter is not changed regularly, if the system is not maintained well, it puts a lot of drag on the engines, which will increase the fuel consumption, which is quite an expensive proposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another important thing to know: The new coronavirus is not airborne. Instead, it&rsquo;s transmitted through droplets of fluid or mucus that you cough or sneeze out, which generally don&rsquo;t travel farther than 6 feet. But if those droplets land on a surface that you later touch, you can pick up the virus that way.</p>
<p>People can help protect themselves and one another by taking precautions such as washing hands frequently, coughing into an elbow and trying not to touch eyes, nose and mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good hand hygiene is the solution,&rdquo; Doron says.</p>
<p>And not just in the bathroom. Even on the way back to your seat after a bathroom visit where you washed your hands, &ldquo;one may be touching doors, doorknobs, seats,&rdquo; says Dr. Lin Chen, president of the International Society of Travel Medicine and director of the travel medicine center at Mount Auburn Hospital in Massachusetts. So it&rsquo;s a good idea to use hand sanitizer at your seat before eating pretzels or sweeping hair from your face.</p>
<p>The CDC says your sanitizer should have at least 60% alcohol content.</p>
<p>How clean are planes anyway?</p>
<p>Airline sanitization is also something to consider. Some airlines are stepping up their cleaning game. American Airlines says it is conducting a &ldquo;more thorough cleaning of all hard surfaces&rdquo; and removing self-serve snack baskets on some international flights. Alaska Airlines says that, since March 2, it has been &ldquo;enhancing&rdquo; aircraft cleaning between flights. For planes whose schedules allow, the cleaning policy now includes seats, overhead air vents, bathroom door handles, window shades and luggage compartment handles.</p>
<p>Flights often turn around quickly, which could lead to possible lapses in the cleaning process, so Chen suggests bringing alcohol wipes to clean the areas you personally touch — including your seat belt, tray table and armrests. In a pinch, squeezing hand sanitizer onto a tissue and wiping down your armrest would probably work, she says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We really don&rsquo;t have data about how long the coronavirus survives on surfaces,&rdquo; Chen says. Other coronaviruses can last for a few hours or a few days on different materials, so for the time being, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s best to be more cautious,&rdquo; she says.</p>

Wash your hands! Photo: Moyo Studio/Getty Images</p>
<p>Please note the story you’re reading was published more than a day ago. COVID-19 news and recommendations change fast: Read the latest here to stay up-to-date. We’ve lifted our paywall on all essential news and updates about the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Over the past few weeks, an increasing number of countries across the world have struggled to contain the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19. Since the outbreak began, there have been over 109,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus reported in at least 95 countries — and that number will inevitably continue to rise. In late February, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that the United States should brace for a domestic outbreak, with the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases saying, “It’s not so much of a question of if this will happen in this country anymore but a question of when this will happen.” As of Monday, COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in 34 states, with Washington state, New York, and California suffering from the largest outbreaks.</p>
<p>So now that the coronavirus is spreading across the U.S., how worried should you be? And what precautions should you take? We spoke to experts in epidemiology and immunology about what measures people can take to protect themselves.</p>
<p>Know the symptoms.</p>
<p>According to the CDC, symptoms of the coronavirus include fever, coughing, and shortness of breath, which can appear anywhere between two days and two weeks after exposure. While health experts are still learning about how the coronavirus spreads, they believe it is largely spread through respiratory droplets that leave an infected person’s mouth or nose. Some experts believe that the virus is transmitted primarily through coughing and sneezing, though it’s also likely that it can spread through surface contact. In other words, if an infected person sneezes on a surface, a person who touches that surface could pick up the virus.</p>
<p>According to China’s most comprehensive report about the outbreak, published in mid-February, 80 percent of novel coronavirus cases are mild, with symptoms similar to a common cold or seasonal flu. Additionally, some people do not show symptoms for up to two weeks after they’ve been infected, meaning it’s possible for people to transmit the virus without knowing they’re infected — which has made the coronavirus a challenge to contain.</p>
<p>Wash your hands.</p>
<p>Washing your hands regularly is the best way to protect yourself from the coronavirus — assuming you’re doing it correctly. The CDC recommends getting your hands wet with warm or cold water; lathering your entire hands, including under the nails, with soap; scrubbing your hands for 20 seconds; rinsing with clean water; and finally, either letting your hands air-dry or using a clean towel.</p>
<p>“Wash them especially well if you’re about to eat,” Aaron E. Carroll, a professor of pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine, wrote in the New York Times. “Wash them after you’ve blown your nose, coughed or sneezed. Make it routine that all members of the household wash their hands when they get home.”</p>
<p>It’s also not a bad idea to carry around a hand sanitizer for times when you’re not near a sink, though you should make sure it contains at least 60 percent alcohol. However, experts stress that washing your hands thoroughly — and frequently — is the best preventative measure.</p>
<p>Don’t buy a mask (unless you actually need one).</p>
<p>For the majority of people, face masks will not prevent you from catching the coronavirus. Instead, the CDC recommends masks only for people who are already infected or who are in close contact with people who are infected, like hospital and health-care workers.</p>
<p>“Widespread, unnecessary use of masks will lead to shortages, making it more difficult for people who need them — health-care workers and people who have potentially been exposed — to be able to get them,” Mark Lurie, an associate professor of epidemiology at Brown University’s School of Public Health, told the Cut.</p>
<p>Stop touching your face!</p>
<p>In addition to washing your hands frequently, the CDC also recommends that you avoid touching your face — specifically, your eyes, nose, and mouth, which are entry portals for coronavirus and other germs. If an infected person coughs or sneezes on a surface, and you touch that contaminated surface and then touch your facial mucous membranes — the eyes, nose, and mouth — you could become infected.</p>
<p>Stock up on prescriptions and household supplies.</p>
<p>According to the New York Times, experts are recommending stocking up on at least a month’s worth of prescription or over-the-counter medicine, in the event that you have to self-quarantine. Experts are also advising buying extra shelf-stable food, cleaning supplies, and other necessary household items.</p>
<p>Practice social distancing.</p>
<p>If there’s an outbreak in your area, experts say it’s wise to practice “social distancing” measures to mitigate the spread of viruses. These measures typically entail keeping your distance from other people — the CDC recommends standing at least six feet away, if possible — and avoiding crowded spaces. (Some countries like France have already implemented such measures, like banning gatherings of more than 1,000 people.)</p>
<p>If you’re sick …</p>
<p>Be cautious: If you experience any cold or flulike symptoms, you should stay home (if you can afford to.) And even if you aren’t sick, it’s a good idea to work from home if you can. As Katie Heaney noted on the Cut, every time we leave our home, we increase our risk of exposure and transmission, potentially unknowingly.</p>
<p>According to the Times, if you think you have the coronavirus, you should reach out to your doctor or local health department, or follow the instructions on the CDC’s website.</p>
<p>If you’re pregnant …</p>
<p>As of now, the CDC does not recommend specific precautions for pregnant women, as there’s a lack of “information from published scientific reports about susceptibility of pregnant women to COVID-19.” However, the CDC notes that because pregnant women’s immune systems are in flux, it’s possible they could be more susceptible. “It makes sense that a pregnant woman would be at higher risk of complications from this virus than a nonpregnant one,” Dr. Steven Gordon, M.D., an infectious-disease specialist at the Cleveland Clinic, told the New York Times last week.</p>
<p>If you have a chronic illness, are elderly, or have a compromised immune system …</p>
<p>While COVID-19 will cause mild symptoms in the majority of infected people, Jan Carette, an associate professor at the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Stanford University’s School of Medicine, says that the elderly — especially those with chronic conditions, like hypertension or diabetes — are at greater risk for more severe disease. In this case, he recommends that those who are especially susceptible practice the above precautions as well as avoid people who display flulike symptoms.</p>
<p>If you’re traveling …</p>
<p>If you have upcoming travel plans, it’s a good idea to stay up-to-date on the CDC’s travel warnings for specific countries. In general, it’s safest to avoid nonessential travel to countries with a sustained COVID-19 presence; right now, this includes Iran, China, South Korea, and Italy. For individuals who are especially susceptible to viral infections, including the elderly and those with existing medical conditions, the CDC advises avoiding travel to Japan as well.</p>
<p>Currently, the CDC doesn’t have any additional recommendations for domestic travel, though this could change as the virus spreads further in the United States. But according to the CDC’s website, the risk of infection on an airplane is low. “Because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes, most viruses and other germs do not spread easily,” they write. However, they recommend that travelers wash their hands frequently and avoid contact with sick passengers.</p>
