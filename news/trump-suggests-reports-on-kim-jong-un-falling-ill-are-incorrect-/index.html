WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Thursday that reports suggesting North Korea&rsquo;s leader was incapacitated following a cardiovascular surgery were incorrect. &ldquo;I think the report was incorrect, let me just put it that way,&rdquo; Trump said when asked at a White House press briefing if he knew of Kim Jong Un&rsquo;s condition. &ldquo;I hear the report was an incorrect report. I hope it was an incorrect report,&rdquo; he added, without providing further details. Earlier in the week, Trump said that he had a &ldquo;very good relationship&rdquo; with the young leader and wished Kim &ldquo;good luck.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a very good relationship with him. I wouldn&rsquo;t &ndash; I can only say this, I wish him well, because if he is in the kind of condition that the reports say, that&rsquo;s a very serious condition, as you know,&rdquo; Trump said on Tuesday during a White House press briefing. &ldquo;But I wish him well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Speculation about Kim&rsquo;s health first arose after his absence from the April 15 anniversary birthday celebration of North Korea&rsquo;s founding father Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of Kim Jong Un. Daily NK, a South Korean newspaper that focuses its coverage on North Korea, said late Monday that Kim on April 12 received a cardiovascular procedure at Hyangsan Hospital. The outlet also reported that Kim was recovering in a villa near the hospital. NBC News, citing American officials, reported early Tuesday that Kim recently had cardiovascular surgery. Some of those officials said intelligence suggests Kim could be incapacitated. NBC&rsquo;s report seemed to contradict South Korea&rsquo;s presidential office, which told the outlet that Kim &ldquo;is currently touring provincial areas with his close aides and we do not detect evidences to support speculation about his ill health.&rdquo; Kim Jong Un was put forward as the &ldquo;Great Successor&rdquo; in 2009 and was made a four-star general the following year. His father, Kim Jong Il, died in 2011 and was believed to be about 70 years old at the time of his death. As planned, Kim took over and was probably around 28 years old.</p>

<h3 id="why-the-confusion-about-kim-jong-uns-health-actually-makes-sense">Why the confusion about Kim Jong Un&rsquo;s health actually makes sense</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200421005544-30-kim-jong-un-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) Confusing and sometimes conflicting reports emerged Tuesday about the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. That was followed by intense speculation on his whereabouts, his medical condition and the future of the world&rsquo;s only hereditary communist state.</p>
<p>Initial rumblings began after North Korea&rsquo;s most important holiday came and went on April 15 without an appearance by Kim, which was unusual.</p>
<p>Then Daily NK, an online publication based in South Korea that focuses on the north, reported that Kim had received a cardiovascular system procedure on April 12, and was being treated in a villa in Hyangsan County.</p>
<p>CNN was unable to confirm the report, but a US official said that Washington is monitoring intelligence that suggests Kim is in grave danger after undergoing a previous surgery. A second source familiar with the intelligence told CNN that the US has been closely monitoring reports on Kim&rsquo;s health.</p>
<p>But a South Korean official told CNN that Kim is &ldquo;believed to be in other parts of North Korea than Pyongyang with other North Korean top officials,&rdquo; and &ldquo;no unusual signs supporting reports about his health conditions have been detected.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s rare for the South Korean government to divulge information about Kim&rsquo;s whereabouts.</p>
<p>The truth is, few people outside of Kim&rsquo;s inner circle know for sure &ndash; his daily routine and health are some of North Korea&rsquo;s most closely guarded secrets. In that environment, rumors and misinformation are almost inevitable.</p>
<p>The young North Korean leader is revered almost like a deity within the country, and he&rsquo;s protected as such &ndash; just think back to the images of Kim&rsquo;s bodyguards running alongside his limousine during his meetings with other world leaders in 2018. His movements and whereabouts are protected with an intense secrecy unmatched in much of the world. Even discussing rumors or misinformation about his health can get you in trouble with the state&rsquo;s security services, experts say.</p>

<p>Andrei Lankov, a professor at Kookmin University in South Korea and an expert in North Korean affairs, says very few people know the intimate details of Kim&rsquo;s personal life &ndash; and they are &ldquo;not inclined to talk about it, because they would much prefer to remain alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a very murky business,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They (people close to Kim) have very little to gain by telling everybody what they know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The debate about Kim&rsquo;s health and whereabouts is a timely reminder on an important caveat that should accompany nearly all stories on the inner workings of North Korea: The country is a black hole when it comes to gathering independent and trustworthy news.</p>
<p>Very few details about North Korea are revealed that are not state-sanctioned. Those who have fled the country offer invaluable insight, but defection can take weeks, months &ndash; even years. Experts and analysts who study North Korea rely on everything from satellite images of personnel movements to a line-by-line analysis of state media dispatches to find out the truth.</p>
<p>NK News, a well-respected English-language North Korean monitoring website, even runs a North Korean Leadership Tracker which allows users to see the number of appearances or mentions of Kim and other high-ranking leaders in state media.</p>
<p>Speculation about the leader&rsquo;s health or whereabouts is often educated guesswork, and it often turns out to be wrong. But there are two major reasons why it happens so regularly.</p>
<p>No apparent heir</p>
<p>Any conjecture about Kim&rsquo;s death usually feeds into a popular narrative of North Korea as a modern-day Shakespearean tragedy.</p>
<p>The country has been ruled as a hereditary dictatorship since its founding in 1948 by Kim Il Sung. His son, Kim Jong Il, took over after his father&rsquo;s death in 1994. And Kim Jong Un took power 17 years later when Kim Jong Il died. Their eventual takeovers were telegraphed to the public before their respective fathers&rsquo; deaths.</p>
<p>But Kim&rsquo;s three children are not believed to have reached adulthood yet. Even if one was being groomed for future leadership, the child would need some sort of regent to rule in an interim capacity &ndash; something that&rsquo;s never happened in North Korea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a monarchy officially. It&rsquo;s a monarchy for all practical purposes,&rdquo; Lankov said.</p>
<p>Michael Madden, an expert on North Korea&rsquo;s leadership, believes there are about 10 to 20 different scenarios that could play out should Kim be incapacitated, though cautioned against reading the tea leaves too much.</p>
<p>He said it&rsquo;s possible North Korea could choose to follow the model the Soviet Union did after the death of Joseph Stalin, another communist dictator who ruled by cult of personality, and turn to some form of collective leadership. It would likely be led Kim Jong Un&rsquo;s sister and close aide, Kim Yo Jong, an it&rsquo;s possible the body would serve until Kim Jong Un&rsquo;s heir is old enough to take the reins.</p>
<p>JUST WATCHED Everything we know about Kim Jong Un&rsquo;s sister (2018) Replay More Videos &hellip; MUST WATCH Everything we know about Kim Jong Un&rsquo;s sister (2018) 01:10</p>
<p>Kim Yo Jong has been one of the most visible members of her brother&rsquo;s leadership team since her trip to the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea, save for a few months when she disappeared from the public eye. The other option within the family is Kim Jong Un&rsquo;s other brother, Kim Jong Chol, but he is best known as an Eric Clapton fan and is not as involved in politics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The continuity of the regime is the key,&rdquo; Madden said.</p>
<p>Madden said it&rsquo;s important to note that though North Korea may not have a transparent, well-defined succession plan, &ldquo;in terms of continuity of government, they have that setup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the reason they have that setup is because they have nuclear weapons, they have got to maintain constant command and control over the nuclear weapons assets,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>The nuclear question</p>
<p>The security and question of what happens to North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear weapons in the event of some sort of leadership transition is likely the one that concerns officials in Washington, Seoul and Beijing.</p>
<p>Most countries aim to share what Vipin Narang, a professor of political science at MIT and expert in nuclear weapons issues and strategy, calls a &ldquo;Goldilocks position on their nuclear weapons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;States want the public and others to know just enough. They want to be transparent about the capability, but kind of opaque about the procedures and the actual line of deployment to enhance deterrence,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear weapons are another closely guarded secret inside the country. Little is known about how many Pyongyang has, how reliable they are, if its missiles and submarines could successfully fire them or even how Kim oversees their command and control apparatus. Intelligence experts estimate Pyongyang has dozens of warheads based on the amount of radioactive material produced at its nuclear weapons facilities, but the exact number is unclear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know a lot about how they manage their nuclear weapons during peacetime,&rdquo; Narang said.</p>
<p>Though North Korea is still technically at war with the South and the United States, many of Pyongyang&rsquo;s nuclear weapons may be sitting disassembled and &ldquo;there are probably very few ready systems,&rdquo; Narang said.</p>
<p>But Narang said he wouldn&rsquo;t be terribly concerned about the security of North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear weapons in the event Kim died of natural causes. Kim is, by most accounts, not a healthy man. He is overweight, under stress and was reported to be a heavy drinker at meetings with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m usually pessimistic,&rdquo; Narang said, &ldquo;but you have a guy who&rsquo;s obese, a chronic smoker, has gout, presumably some form of diabetes. They&rsquo;ve surely thought about this contingency given his health. And with Kim Yo Jong assuming a much greater role, it&rsquo;s possible they&rsquo;ve already thought about what succession look like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While those poor lifestyle choices do not mean Kim is knocking on death&rsquo;s door by any stretch, when combined with his absence it does remind policy and intelligence officials with a stake in North Korea&rsquo;s future that they should at least be thinking about an important but uncomfortable question: How exactly does a leader lionized as a near demigod hand over the reins, whether he goes under anesthesia for a medical procedure or in the event of his death?</p>
<p>The truth is few people &ndash; if any &ndash; outside the country know for sure. But the answers carry significant implications for officials from Beijing to Seoul to Washington, because they must consider whether Kim would leave behind a massive power vacuum in a state that has successfully tested nuclear weapons, and the intercontinental-range ballistic missiles to deliver them.

<h3 id="kim-yo-jong-the-sister-of-kim-jong-un-fast-becoming-his-alter-ego">Kim Yo-jong: the sister of Kim Jong-un, fast &lsquo;becoming his alter ego&rsquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acbc8b6e6049d420c7bce1f344ea012fca586546/304_5_4140_2484/master/4140.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=6af00f3fc1ae13d9b970a344ad930ee9" alt="img">
From producing an ashtray during a cigarette break en route to a nuclear summit to issuing a statement in praise of the US president, Kim Yo-jong has become the single most important figure in the North Korean regime after her brother, the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un.</p>
<p>Since representing Kim at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, Yo-jong has not only acquired prestigious titles within the ruling Workers’ party. She is rumoured to be the brains behind Kim’s carefully constructed public image, at home and abroad. In return, she enjoys the absolute confidence of her brother, a leader capable of ordering the execution of his own uncle for alleged treason.</p>
<p>As the world grapples with the coronavirus pandemic – with Pyongyang continuing to insist it has not recorded a single case – Kim Yo-jong’s ascendancy continues.</p>
<p>Last month, she made her first public statement, condemning the South as a “frightened dog barking” after Seoul protested against a live-fire military exercise by the North. And in March, she publicly praised Donald Trump for sending Kim a letter in which he said he hoped to maintain good bilateral relations and offered help in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The publication of political statements in Kim Yo-jong’s name underlines her central role in the regime, according to Youngshik Bong, a research fellow at Yonsei University’s Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul. “It is revealing that Kim Jong-un permitted her to write and announce a scathing statement about South Korea in such a personal tone,” Bong said. “He is clearly ready to allow his sister to become his alter ego.”</p>

<p>But Yo-jong, who accompanied Kim to his two summits with Trump, apparently paid a price when his nuclear diplomacy suffered a setback. Last weekend, she was reinstated to the party’s powerful politburo, according to the state Korean Central News Agency, just over a year after she had reportedly been removed from the position and told to keep a low profile following the failure of the Hanoi denuclearisation summit.</p>
<p>And she has not escaped the attention of US officials, who in 2017 placed her and other North Korean officials on a blacklist for “severe human rights abuses”.</p>
<p>Internationally, Yo-jong has been a visible presence throughout the regime’s high-stakes diplomatic process with Washington and Seoul. At home, she has performed the role of propagandist-in-chief, burnishing Kim’s reputation as head of the dynasty that has ruled North Korea for three generations.</p>
<p>“She has direct access to and strong influence on Kim Jong-un,” said Leonid Petrov, a North Korea specialist and senior lecturer at the International College of Management in Sydney. “She is not associated with his purges or military brinkmanship, but knows all about them. She is a trusted political figure who helps Kim maintain a positive public image when he is dealing with foreigners or South Koreans.”</p>

<p>Yo-jong, who is thought to be four years younger than her brother, was rarely seen in public until 2010, when she was photographed attending a party conference. By the following year, she was a regular presence in her father Kim Jong-il’s entourage, and was seen mourning after his death in late 2011.</p>
<p>But her journey to the heart of the North Korean regime had arguably begun in the late 1990s, when she attended primary school in Berne, Switzerland at the same time as Kim Jong-un, with whom she lived in a private home, attended to by staff and watched over by bodyguards, according to North Korea Leadership Watch.</p>
<p>“They were virtually in exile together, both knowing what the future had in store for them,” Bong said. “They must have gained a tremendous sense of having a common fate. As a result, she has her brother’s unconditional trust.”</p>
<p>Little is known about Yo-jong’s life during the period between her graduation with a computer science degree from Kim Il-sung University in Pyongyang and 2007, when she began to play a junior role in the ruling party.</p>
<p>She is said to have been involved in arranging her brother’s succession as supreme leader after Kim Jong-il suffered two strokes in 2008, but was not mentioned by North Korean state media until March 2014, when she accompanied her brother during elections for the Supreme People’s Assembly.</p>
<p>“The North Korean regime is a family business, and Kim Jong-un appears to place trust in his sister,” said Leif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha University in Seoul. “She has demonstrated skills at modernising the brand of the regime, and has some sway over state propaganda. Her most important function is probably as a confidante to her brother.</p>
<p>“But she also has a signalling role because messages from Kim Yo-jong carry more weight than those of an imminently replaceable North Korean official.”</p>
<p>Kim Yo-jong’s upward trajectory is expected to continue once the North resumes its nuclear diplomacy in a post-pandemic world. “She plays a pivotal role in North Korean domestic and foreign policy campaigns because she is one of the main stakeholders in the regime’s survival,” Petrov said.</p>
<p>But, he added, she would never adopt the mantle of leader should something happen to her brother. “Kim Yo-jong knows how to smooth Kim Jong-un’s initiatives and strengthen his soft power … but she won’t replace the primary decision-maker. North Korea is a Confucian country where seniority and masculinity are respected. She is Kim’s most trusted ally, but no more than that.”
