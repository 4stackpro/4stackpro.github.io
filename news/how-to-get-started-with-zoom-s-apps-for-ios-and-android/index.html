Meeting online with Zoom doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;re tied to your desk—learn how to host or join video conferences from your smartphone.</p>
<p>Millions of Americans are now working from home due to the coronavirus outbreak and that means demand for video chat apps and other remote collaboration tools has skyrocketed. If your team is looking for ways to communicate face-to-face while maintaining social distancing, Zoom is just one of the tools you have at your disposal.</p>
<p>Newly remote workers may find themselves using Zoom for the first time and most will probably opt for the Zoom desktop client for Windows or macOS. But, what if your remote work situation still requires moving around, be it inside or out of the house? A desktop video conferencing app won&rsquo;t cut it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where Zoom Cloud Meetings for iOS and Android come in. If you&rsquo;re not sure how to get started with Zoom for your mobile device, it&rsquo;s time to get up to speed.</p>
<p>SEE: Coronavirus: Critical IT policies and tools every business needs (TechRepublic Premium)</p>
<p>Make sure you download the Zoom Cloud Meetings app</p>
<p>A search in the App Store or Google Play Store will reveal a lot of products called Zoom, and a lot of other products by the actual makers of Zoom as well. Downloading the wrong app&ndash;especially if your meeting is happening soon&ndash;can be frustrating.</p>
<p>The app you&rsquo;re looking for is called Zoom Cloud Meetings. Other Zoom apps are for integrations or conference room scheduling, which are useful for enterprise workers, but not necessarily those who just need to host or attend a Zoom meeting on their mobile device.</p>
<p>How to host a new meeting in Zoom from your phone</p>
<p>Anyone with a free Zoom account can host a meeting. Meeting size limits are set to 100 users, including the host, for both free and paid accounts&ndash;unless you&rsquo;ve paid for larger meeting capacity. For free Zoom accounts, meetings with two or more people will automatically end at the 40-minute mark.</p>
<p>After you install the Zoom app on your iOS or Android device, have an active Zoom account, and sign in to the app, you&rsquo;ll see the screen shown in Figure A.</p>
<p>Figure A</p>
<p>From there, simply tap on New Meeting, then Start A Meeting, and you&rsquo;ll be in a new conference where you can access controls to share documents, invite other people, and do other things similar to what you can do in the desktop version of Zoom for macOS and Windows.</p>
<p>How to join a meeting in Zoom from your phone</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever joined a meeting on the Zoom desktop app, you&rsquo;re familiar with how joining a meeting works: The host sends you a link via email, text, or in the Zoom app (if you have both shared Zoom contact details), you click the URL, and the Zoom app automatically joins the meeting.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same on mobile devices: If you get an email to join a conference and have the Zoom mobile app installed, all you need to do is tap on the meeting URL and Zoom Cloud Meetings will launch, adding you to the meeting. If you don&rsquo;t have Zoom Cloud Meetings installed, you&rsquo;ll see the screen shown in Figure B, at which point you&rsquo;ll have to download and run the app&ndash;a Zoom account is not required to join meetings.</p>

<h3 id="videoconferencing-apps-saw-a-record-62m-downloads-during-one-week-in-march--techcrunch">Videoconferencing apps saw a record 62M downloads during one week in March – TechCrunch</h3>
<p><img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/meeting-apps-ios1.jpg?w=711" alt="img">
Work-from-home policies, social distancing and government lockdowns have increased the demand for video conferencing apps, for both business and personal use. According to a new report from App Annie, out on Monday, business conferencing apps have been experiencing record growth as a result, and just hit their biggest week ever in March, when they topped 62 million downloads during the week of March 14-21. Meanwhile, social networking video app Houseparty has also seen phenomenal growth in Europe during lockdowns and home quarantines.</p>
<p>While such growth was to be expected, App Annie’s report provides real-world context about just how many new customers these apps are gaining during this time.</p>
<p>For example, the jump in business app downloads to 62 million across iOS and Google Play earlier in March was up 45% from just the prior week. It was also the highest growth among any category across the app stores that week, the report said. And it was up 90% from the weekly average of business app downloads in 2019.</p>
<p>Much of the growth in the category is due to the increased adoption of apps like Google’s Hangouts Meet, Microsoft Teams and Zoom Cloud Meetings.</p>
<p>Zoom topped the charts worldwide in February and March, and continues to see high numbers of downloads in the U.S., U.K. and elsewhere in Europe.</p>
<p>During the record week of downloads, Zoom was downloaded 14 times more than the weekly average during the fourth quarter of 2019 in the U.S. It was also downloaded more than 20 times Q4’s weekly average in the U.K., 22 times more in France, 17 times more in Germany, 27 times more in Spain and an even larger 55 times more in Italy.</p>
<p>A related report from the app store intelligence firm Sensor Tower saw Zoom’s U.S. downloads somewhat higher in mid-March, but noted that the term “Zoom” wasn’t a top 100 search term in the U.S. App Store before the week of March 9. That meant many new users were being sent the app’s installation page directly — such as via a link shared in a work email, calendar invite or an intranet site, perhaps.</p>
<p>At the same time in March, Google’s Hangouts Meet was seeing strong downloads in the U.K., U.S., Spain and Italy, in particular, with 24x, 30x, 64x and 140x the average weekly downloads in Q4, respectively.</p>
<p>Microsoft Teams saw significant — though not quite as strong — growth in Spain, France and Italy, at 15x, 16x and 30x the weekly levels of downloads in Q4, respectively.</p>
<p>In terms of consumer apps, social video conferencing app Houseparty, popular among Gen Z, has been rapidly growing in Europe and elsewhere. The app benefits from network effects — meaning as more friends and family join Houseparty, the app becomes more useful. It then gets launched and used more often, too. In Italy, the week ending on March 21 saw Houseparty downloads surge at 423 times the average weekly number of downloads in Q4 2019.</p>
<p>In Spain, Houseparty skyrocketed with 2,360 times the number of downloads in the week ending March 21, compared with Q4. Also notable is that Spain was a market where, before, Houseparty didn’t have any wide-scale penetration. Because of the COVID-19 outbreak, it now has a base in a region where it otherwise may have never reached.</p>
<p>Unlike the business conferencing apps, Houseparty aims to make video chat a more personal and social experience. When you launch the app, it shows you’re free to talk and who else is online — similar to other messaging apps. But there are also live parties to join and in-app games to play, which signals the app is not meant for your virtual office meetings.</p>
<p>Business apps aren’t the only ones booming at this time, of course.</p>
<p>Educational apps, including Google Classroom and ABCmouse, have also spiked in March as have grocery delivery apps, like Instacart.</p>
<p>“As people face uncertain timelines for the length of social isolation, video conferencing apps have the potential to vastly influence our daily habits — breaking down geological barriers and fostering the ability to work and socialize relatively seamlessly,” noted App Annie, in its report. “It is an unprecedented time for the world and an incredibly dynamic time for mobile — we are seeing shifts in consumer behavior surface daily across virtually every sector,” the firm concluded.

This Zoom mistake could land you in hot water. Source: Getty</p>
<p>Zoom meetings were once rarity, but with coronavirus forcing the world’s largest work from home experiment, they’re now an everyday occurrence.</p>
<p>The video conferencing app, created in 2011 by Eric Yuan, was downloaded around 2.13 million times around the world on March 23 – up from 56,000 per day just two months earlier.</p>
<p>While it’s been used to host everything from virtual classrooms and church services to blind dates and bucks’ nights, it’s primarily been adopted by big corporates to host their conferences.</p>
<p>However, if you’re a newbie to the app, you may want to heed this warning: using this one feature could get you fired.</p>
<p>Zoom users can use the app’s private chat function during a conference, thinking they’re about to speak to their colleagues without anyone seeing.</p>
<p>False.</p>
<p>“FYI: If you’re having a committee meeting via Zoom and you use the chat function to privately write to someone, your colleagues may not see it in realtime, but it shows up when the chat is downloaded and put into the minutes folder,” one eagle-eyed Twitter user said.</p>
<p>FYI: if you&rsquo;re having a committee meeting via Zoom and you use the chat function to privately write to someone, your colleagues may not see it in real time, but it shows up when the chat is downloaded and put in the minutes folder&hellip; — Is there an end to Zoom (@HJHaldanePhD) March 29, 2020</p>
<p>Here’s how it works</p>
<p>Any participant in a Zoom meeting can save the public chat of the meeting, which is usually used for people to take down useful notes and record ideas.</p>
<p>You can choose to save the Zoom meeting to the cloud, or locally (to their computers).</p>
<p>If you choose to record a Zoom meeting to the cloud, only chats sent publicly (to everyone in the meeting) will be saved.</p>
<p>However, if you choose to record a Zoom meeting locally, then chats sent publicly and any private exchanges will be saved.</p>
<p>How can I avoid it?</p>
<p>Treat your meetings as you would in the office - only reveal the information you want everyone to know.</p>
<p>The Twitter user who spotted the bug shared his advice too: “Check your chats before you download and share. Or don’t private chat on Zoom.”</p>
<p>And beware of Zoom bombing</p>
<p>As more and more users latch onto the app, the act of “Zoom bombing” has been reported across the globe.</p>
<p>This is when someone who wasn’t invited to your private meeting can sit in on it, view it and share content.</p>
<p>And it’s not hard to do: simply searching “Zoom.us” on Twitter brings up multiple links to meetings, which anyone can then use to join.</p>
<p>Founder and editor-in-chief of The Information Jessica Lessin tweeted on March 21 that her Zoom video call was “attacked” by someone who kept sharing pornography.</p>
<p>Our video call was just attacked by someone who kept sharing pornography + switching between different user accounts so we could not block them. Stay tuned for next steps. And I am sorry to everyone who experienced. We shut down as soon as we could. — Jessica Lessin (@Jessicalessin) March 20, 2020</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Well, Zoom’s official policy states: “The host does not need to grant screen share access for another participant to share their screen.”</p>
<p>How can I avoid Zoom bombing?</p>
<p>Hosts can disable the “Join Before Host” option in their settings or in the admin controls of a call, which means people can’t cause trouble before you arrive.</p>
<p>You can also disable “File Transfer”, so there’s no digital virus sharing.</p>
<p>Another tip is to disable the “Allow Removed Participants to Rejoin” so people who have been kicked out of the chat can’t rejoin.</p>
