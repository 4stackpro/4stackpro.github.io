From Ohio, Joe Burrow descended to Louisiana. To Ohio he has returned.</p>
<p>The Cincinnati Bengals used the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft to make official what we&rsquo;ve all presumed for months: The Heisman Trophy LSU quarterback is going back home.</p>
<p>Burrow reflected on the moment inside his boyhood home in The Plains, Ohio, wearing a white T-shirt he designed with Nike showing off his 740 area code, and stared into a self-built broadcast station during a social-distancing-approved interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is something that I wanted to represent,&rdquo; he said, the first pro player picked amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Nothing was prying Burrow away from the Bengals.</p>
<p>Even when the Miami Dolphins offered multiple trade options, ESPN&rsquo;s Adam Schefter reported, the Bengals weren&rsquo;t budging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing that can make us trade that pick away,&rdquo; Bengals coach Zac Taylor said Thursday night.</p>
<p>The Dolphins instead picked Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa at No. 5. The Bengals are scheduled to play in Miami in 2020, so long as the season unfolds as planned.</p>
<p>Cincinnati owner Mike Brown sent the Burrows a letter and No. 9 Bengals jerseys Wednesday, officially welcoming Joe to the franchise, saying he was &ldquo;looking forward to building championship football teams for many years to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Au revoir, Louisianans might say.</p>
<p>And perhaps, on va se revoir.</p>
<p>How does a state say goodbye to a man who made the LSU Tigers a national champion again?</p>
<p>ON SALE NOW:</p>
<p>No worries, cher. The player who advocated for collegiate compensation is about to receive his award: a projected contract value, according to Spotrac, of $37,166,330.</p>
<p>Such a fortune shrouds the $100,000 deal Billy Cannon signed with the Houston Oilers as the AFL&rsquo;s No. 1 pick 1960, but still wouldn&rsquo;t breach the $68 million deal JaMarcus Russell signed as the Oakland Raiders&rsquo; No. 1 choice in 2007 — back before the rookie salary scale was knocked down in the 2011 collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, LSU&rsquo;s third No. 1 overall draft pick in history will be paid grandly.</p>
<p>But typing Russell&rsquo;s name evokes a warning: With great wealth comes great accountability.</p>
<p>Russell was out of the NFL after three years and a 7-18 record as a starter in Oakland. Even the late Billy Cannon, a three-time AFL champion and two-time All-Pro, still faced criticism that he didn&rsquo;t live up to his legendary name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Heisman brings the prestige,&rdquo; said Bunnie Cannon, Billy&rsquo;s daughter. &ldquo;The No. 1 draft pick, that brings money, and that opens up a whole new can of worms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bengals fans are expecting a hometown hero — an Athens High graduate who nearly won a state title in 2015, who, after attending Ohio State, transferred to LSU and broke records and earned the Heisman and won the program&rsquo;s fourth national championship — to lift their franchise to its former glory.</p>
<p>If a small college town like Athens turned into a purple and gold province of a southern state for Burrow&rsquo;s LSU career, just think what Ohio will be like when their son returns home?</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to have such a huge fan base just because Ohio people love football,&rdquo; said Zacciah Saltzman, Burrow&rsquo;s close friend and high school teammate. &ldquo;People will all definitely rally behind him. Just look at the way they all became LSU fans. This is Ohio State World. They&rsquo;re selling LSU shirts in the local Walmart because of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As LSU aims for NFL Draft records, Ed Orgeron hopes recruits watch: &lsquo;This is the results&rsquo; Ed Orgeron wished he was spending Thursday night in Las Vegas, but as NFL teams make selections virtually to meet social distancing guidelines, Orgeron still thinks the draft can let LSU shine, boosting the Tigers’ recruiting efforts.</p>
<p>Hope won&rsquo;t be enough.</p>
<p>Cincinnati might be apathetic to the notion at this point.</p>
<p>Burrow is the fifth quarterback the Bengals have selected in the past decade.</p>
<p>Ryan Finley (fourth round, 2019). Logan Woodside (seventh round, 2018). AJ McCarron (fifth round, 2014). Andy Dalton (second round, 2011).</p>
<p>Dalton was nearly a franchise quarterback, leading the Bengals to four straight wild-card rounds from 2011 to 2014 before he fractured his thumb in 2015 after a 10-3 start.</p>
<p>Now, after recording a 20-35 record in the past four seasons, it appears Dalton&rsquo;s time is over.</p>
<p>Whoo boy, Cincy fans are used to first-round exits. Think an eight-year losing streak to Alabama was long? The Bengals haven&rsquo;t won a playoff game since 1991.</p>
<p>No first-round quarterback taken since has been able to change that.</p>
<p>Not Houston&rsquo;s David Klingler (No. 6 overall, 1992) and his 4-20 record in three seasons.</p>
<p>Not Oregon&rsquo;s Akili Smith (No. 3 overall, 1999) and his 3-14 record in four seasons.</p>
<p>Not even Southern Cal&rsquo;s Carson Palmer, the last Heisman Trophy quarterback the Bengals drafted No. 1 overall, who, from 2004-10, couldn&rsquo;t lead the franchise past the Pittsburgh Steelers (2005) and New York Jets (2009) in the postseason.</p>
<p>+3 Worth the wait: When LSU&rsquo;s Patrick Queen chose linebacker, stardom soon followed Versatility made Patrick Queen a hot commodity that brought a lot of football recruiters to Livonia High. Could versatility be both a blessing…</p>
<p>No, of the 37 quarterbacks the Cincinnati Bengals have drafted in the Super Bowl era, locals hope Burrow takes after Ken Anderson (third round, 1971) and Boomer Esiason (second round, 1984) — the only quarterbacks to each led the franchise to a Super Bowl appearance.</p>
<p>Esiason, now an NFL analyst, already presented Joe Burrow with a Bengals helmet when the LSU quarterback visited the set of &ldquo;The NFL Today&rdquo; in December.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to welcome you from one Bengal to the next Bengal,&rdquo; Esiason told Burrow then.</p>
<p>Boomer Esiason presented Joe Burrow with a Bengals helmet when he visited The NFL Today.Burrow&rsquo;s reaction: pic.twitter.com/eOu6ehNKOT — NFLonCBS (@NFLonCBS) December 15, 2019</p>
<p>+3 Confident Lloyd Cushenberry enters the NFL Draft determined to prove himself again Lloyd Cushenberry III has never been a guy who chased stars. The fact that he became one in his own right while helping LSU win a national cha…</p>
<p>Burrow received the helmet and smiled.</p>
<p>He knows the struggles that will come with going to the NFL&rsquo;s worst team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t sacrifice your standards for anything,&rdquo; Burrow said Thursday night.</p>
<p>He knows why the NFL, to some, stands for Not-For-Long.</p>
<p>The Green Bay Packers drafted his father, Jimmy, in the eighth round of the 1976 draft, and Jimmy played for one season before embarking on a six-year career in the Canadian Football League.</p>
<p>His older brother, Jamie, was cut in training camp by the New York Jets in 2002.</p>
<p>Burrow has experienced setbacks himself, Jamie said. Getting benched for Dwayne Haskins at Ohio State, struggling as a junior at LSU &ldquo;magnified traits he already had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just take it to the next level,&rdquo; Jimmy said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Joe will use those things that got him to be as successful as he was this year and carry that over to the NFL.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So after the draft week media circus, after the commercials and promotional videos, after the coronavirus lockdowns subside, Burrow will be right back at the start of another journey, right where those close to him say he&rsquo;s always thrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the success Joe has had maybe has erased that chip on his shoulder a bit,&rdquo; said Nathan White, Burrow&rsquo;s offensive coordinator at Athens High. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s like, welp, here&rsquo;s another great thing to put it right back there.&rdquo;

<h3 id="12-great-moments-from-joe-burrows-lsu-career">12 great moments from Joe Burrow&rsquo;s LSU career</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.ncaa.com/sites/default/files/public/styles/large_16x9/public-s3/images/2020-04/joe-burrow-lsu-football.jpg?h=3cc3d296&amp;itok=kxboYThV" alt="img">
Joe Burrow went from Ohio State transfer to a Heisman winner at LSU in two seasons, a remarkable finish to a career that ended with an FCS-record 60 touchdown passes in the 2019 season and a College Football Playoff national championship. And now Burrow is the No. 1 overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft.</p>
<p>Here are 12 of Burrow&rsquo;s top moments with the Tigers.</p>
<p>Joe Burrow at LSU: 12 standout moments</p>
<p>First start for the Tigers — Sept. 2, 2018</p>
<p>Def. No. 8 Miami, 33-17</p>
<p>In his first start with LSU after transferring from Ohio State, Burrow led the Tigers to a 24-point halftime lead before the big win against preseason top-10 Miami. Burrow was 11-for-24 for 140 yards in the win.</p>
<p>Game-winning drive at Auburn — Sept. 15, 2018</p>
<p>Def. No. 7 Auburn, 22-21</p>
<p>The Tigers earned another top-10 win, this time thanks to a 42-yard Cole Tracy field goal on the final play of the game. LSU trailed 21-10 before rallying. In the fourth quarter, Burrow found Derrick Dillon for a 71-yard strike to take it to 21-19. Then, with LSU down two points on its 24 and only 5:28 remaining, Burrow led his team on a 14-play, 52-yard drive to set up the Tracy field goal. Burrow finished 15-for-34 for 249 yards and a touchdown.</p>
<p>The game-winning field goal from @cole__tracy is the 2018-19 Play of the Year! #LSUMikey pic.twitter.com/kjtBkxlgsl — LSU Tigers (@LSUsports) August 26, 2019</p>
<p>Down go the Dawgs — Oct. 13, 2019</p>
<p>Def. No. 2 Georgia, 36-16</p>
<p>LSU picked up a notable win against No. 2 Georgia in an impressive 20-point victory. Burrow completed half of his 30 passes but reached 200 passing yards and rushed for 66 yards and two scores. The Tigers went 4-for-4 on fourth-down conversions.</p>
<p>Ending UCF’s unbeaten run — Jan. 1, 2019</p>
<p>Def. No. 8 UCF, 40-32</p>
<p>Burrow’s big game halted UCF’s 25-game win streak in a 40-32 win in the Fiesta Bowl. Shaking off a hit after an interception, Burrow regrouped to pass for 394 yards, four touchdowns and an interception. The victory gave LSU a 10-win season (10-3) and a top-10 final national ranking.</p>
<p>Outscoring Texas — Sept. 7, 2019</p>
<p>Def. No. 9 Texas, 45-38</p>
<p>In a showdown with Texas star QB Sam Ehlinger, Burrow won the stats and the game in Austin. Burrow threw for 471 yards and four touchdowns — including 15-for-18 for 251 yards and two scores after halftime. After the game, Burrow met with Longhorns coach Tom Herman, who recruited Burrow at Ohio State when Herman was an assistant there.</p>
<p>UNBEATEN: Every undefeated national champion since 1936</p>
<p>Top-10 SEC triumph — Oct. 12, 2019</p>
<p>Def. No. 7 Florida, 42-28</p>
<p>Two 5-0 teams met in Baton Rouge, but Florida couldn’t keep pace with the Tigers. Burrow had as many touchdown passes as incompletions (three), going 21-for-24 for 293 yard and three touchdowns.</p>
<p>Beating ‘Bama — Nov. 9, 2019</p>
<p>Def. No. 3 Alabama, 46-41</p>
<p>The losing streak to the Tide ended at eight, with LSU hanging on for a 46-41 win. Burrow went 31-for-39 for 393 yards and three touchdowns while also rushing for 64 yards as he won a battle with Alabama QB Tua Tagovailoa.</p>
<p>Career night at Ole Miss — Nov. 16, 2019</p>
<p>Def. Ole Miss, 58-37</p>
<p>Yes, Burrow had two interceptions. Yes, Ole Miss rushed for 402 yards. But Burrow and LSU still won by 21 points on the road. This time, Burrow passed for a career-high 489 yards and five touchdowns and even completed 17 passes in a row to set a school record. He also broke the school record for pass yards in a season (Rohan Davey in 2001). Three of the touchdowns went to Ja’Marr Chase, who had eight catches for 227 yards and three touchdowns.</p>
<p>NATIONAL CHAMPIONS: All-time college football title history</p>
<p>SEC Champions — Dec. 7, 2019</p>
<p>Def. No. 4 Georgia, 37-10</p>
<p>Joe Burrow&rsquo;s final game before winning the Heisman couldn&rsquo;t have gone much better — or have been more of a coronation ceremony. Completing 28 of 38 passes, Burrow had 349 passing yards with four touchdowns in a rout of the No. 4 Bulldogs. The highlight was when he spun and stepped away from pressure before throwing on the run and finding Justin Jefferson for a 71-yard play.</p>
<p>The Heisman is his — Dec. 14, 2019</p>
<p>There was no doubt about this. Burrow won the highest percentage of first-place votes, the highest percentage of possible points and appeared on the most ballots ever. His margin of victory (1,846) broke the old one held by O.J. Simpson in 1968. Burrow became only the second LSU player to win the Heisman after Billy Cannon in 1959.</p>
<p>It Lives Forever pic.twitter.com/I8Xn7qnFsR — LSU Football (@LSUfootball) December 15, 2019</p>
<p>Crushing Oklahoma in the CFP semifinals — Dec. 28, 2019</p>
<p>Def. No. 4 Oklahoma, 63-28</p>
<p>The game was seemingly over before it really got started. LSU led 49-14 at halftime and cruised to a big win. Playing for the first time since taking the Heisman, Burrow went 29-for-39 for 493 yards and seven touchdown passes while also rushing for another score. Justin Jefferson was his top target. The two connected 14 times for 227 yards and four touchdowns. Burrow&rsquo;s seven TD passes tied the record for a bowl game — and they all came in the first half.</p>
<p>Even when chased toward the sideline, Burrow had answers.</p>
<p>Like a video game</p>

<p>Winning the CFP National Championship — Jan. 13, 2020</p>
<p>Def. No. 3 Clemson, 42-25</p>
<p>Facing a 10-point deficit to the defending national champions, Burrow and LSU responded with a dominant run to pull away for the program&rsquo;s first title since the 2007 season. The Tigers piled up 628 yards as Burrow ended his college career 31-of-49 for 463 yards and five touchdowns along with 58 rushing yards and a touchdown.</p>

For all the uniqueness of this NFL draft, including the angst over a potential communications fiasco, things looked and sounded pretty normal Thursday night.</p>
<p>Quarterbacks were in demand. Ohio State and the Southeastern Conference dominated. The Patriots traded out of the first round. And commissioner Roger Goodell even got booed, if only digitally.</p>

<p>“I do believe this draft is going to be the most memorable we have ever had,” said Goodell, noting that it is accompanied by a ‘Draft-A-Thon’ to benefit six organizations on the front lines battling the coronavirus pandemic, which is what forced the NFL to cancel all in-person draft events.</p>
<p>The first round wasn’t all that remarkable for the picks. Beginning with Joe Burrow of national champion LSU, three quarterbacks went in the top six. Hardly unusual.</p>
<p>For months, the Heisman Trophy winner from LSU was linked with the Bengals. Cincinnati began the draft by sending his name to Goodell in the basement of his home.</p>
<p>This digital/remote/virtual draft – take your choice – was up and running. With no apparent glitches.</p>
<p>Of course, there were no fireworks on the Las Vegas strip. No bear hug between Goodell and Burrow; the commissioner said he would miss those, even if his body wouldn’t. This most basic selection show had team personnel making picks from their homes and players sitting on their own couches while learning their future employers.</p>
<p>The NFL canceled all draft activities in Las Vegas when the national shutdown of large gatherings began. The league had gone full-bore into free agency last month and, now, seven rounds of the draft through Saturday.</p>

<p>“I just believe that our job is to continue on and operate within whatever guidelines are necessary to keep our personnel safe, whether it’s players or coaches or their executives or league personnel,” Goodell said. “We need to make sure that we’re doing things safely and put public safety No 1, but we also need to carry on. We need to move toward the future. We need to make sure that we’re prepared when we come out of this to be in a position to start our season on time and play our season. That’s our role.”</p>
<p>Normalcy, at least among the picks, was the order of the evening, though.</p>
<p>First came Burrow: In his spectacular senior season, he threw for 60 – yes, 60 – touchdowns with only six interceptions. The Tigers beat six top 10 teams on their way to the national title.</p>
<p>“To jump up to No 1 overall is crazy to me,” Burrow said.</p>

<p>He joins a team that went 2-14 last season and desperately needs a jolt of energy.</p>
<p>“If you go in thinking, ‘Oh, this is the year we’re going to make the playoffs, this year we’re going to win a playoff game,’ it gets too daunting,” Burrow said. “You’ve got to focus on the process.”</p>
<p>Bengals coach Zac Taylor was confident Burrow could turn the franchise around.</p>
<p>“We will never pick at No 1 again,” Taylor said. “We don’t want to pick in the top 10 again. We’re looking at this as the only time you’re going to get this caliber player to add him to the program, so obviously this is a big deal.”</p>
<p>The second overall selection, Ohio State All-America edge rusher Chase Young, also was predictable. Washington fielded several offers for that spot, but many scouts and personnel executives felt Young was the best player in this crop.</p>
<p>At 6ft 5in, 264 lbs, Young led the nation with 16 and a half sacks and forced fumbles with six last season. The All-American won the prestigious Bednarik and Nagurski awards in 2019, leading the Buckeyes to the Big Ten title.</p>
<p>He joins a Washington team that went 3-13 and allowed 435 points.</p>
<p>If not for the NFL’s obsession with finding the latest, greatest quarterback prospect, Young might have been the top overall selection. That QB infatuation led Miami to Tua Tagovailoa and the Los Angeles Chargers to Justin Herbert – no surprises there. But Green Bay took a chance at No 26 by taking Utah State QB Jordan Love.</p>
<p>Alabama’s Tagovailoa went fifth, followed in the next spot by Oregon’s Herbert. They were preceded by Ohio State’s Jeff Okudah, the highest-rated cornerback, to Detroit, and Georgia tackle Andrew Thomas to the Giants.</p>

<p>Tagovailoa’s health issues didn’t turn off the Dolphins.</p>
<p>The Alabama quarterback went to a team that was accused going into last season of “Tanking for Tua.” Tagovailoa comes off major hip surgery, which made his landing spot one of the first round’s biggest uncertainties.</p>
<p>“For me and my family, whoever decided to take a chance on us, that’s where I belonged,” Tagovailoa said. “My biggest thing is I’m trying to prove this was the right decision.”</p>
<p>One change he’ll need to make in Miami: No 13 is not available. The Dolphins retired it for Hall of Famer Dan Marino.</p>
<p>“I understand No 13 is retired, and it should be,” Tagovailoa said. “Whatever number I’m given by the organization, if it’s 78 or 99, I’ll wear it.”</p>
<p>Blessed with a quick release, excellent mid-range accuracy and nimble feet, Tagovailoa threw 76 touchdown passes in 24 starts the past two seasons. He helped the Crimson to the 2017 national title.</p>
<p>Herbert had a strong postseason, including a terrific Senior Bowl week that raised his stock. At 6ft 6in, 236lbs, he has the size the pros like, and he’s a good athlete. But he also is not as accurate passing as he’ll need to be.</p>
<p>Los Angeles had a burning hole at quarterback after letting go of longtime starter Philip Rivers. Plus, the Chargers plan to move into a new stadium and could use someone to help sell tickets.</p>
<p>It took until the 13th spot before a trade was made: Tompa, oops, Tampa Bay moving up one spot to get tackle Tristan Wirfs of Iowa to help protect new/old QB Tom Brady. The Buccaneers got that pick from NFC champion San Francisco.</p>
<p>Wide receiver is the deepest position in this draft, but it took until the 12th selection for one to go. Alabama’s Henry Ruggs III, perhaps the fastest man in this group (4.27 in the 40), was the first-ever draftee by the Las Vegas Raiders. Coach Jon Gruden loves speed, and he got a burner who scored 24 touchdowns among 98 career receptions.</p>
<p>New England, which will go into a season without Brady for the first time since 1999, sent its 23rd overall spot to the Chargers, adding a second- and third-rounder. The Chargers were eager to bolster their defense with Oklahoma linebacker Kenneth Murray.</p>
<p>The Packers, despite needs at receiver, offensive line and linebacker, traded up from No 30 to 26th and selected for the future with Love. Aaron Rodgers, of course, sat for a few years in Green Bay behind Brett Favre. Love might do the same behind A-Rod.
