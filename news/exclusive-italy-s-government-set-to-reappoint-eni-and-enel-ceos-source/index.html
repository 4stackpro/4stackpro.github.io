Claudio Descalzi and Francesco Starace took over the helm of Eni and Enel, respectively, in 2014 and were both reappointed in 2017.</p>
<p>The boards of both companies come up for renewal in May, along with those of defence group Leonardo, power grid Terna and bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena.</p>
<p>But the government is expected to draw up its list of candidates for the boards - including the CEOs - by April 18, said the source, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.</p>
<p>The nominations were originally expected in March but were delayed because of the coronavirus crisis, which looks set to push the euro zone&rsquo;s third largest economy into its worst recession in modern history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There have been intense political talks between the ruling parties, but in the end the reappointment of both Descalzi and Starace can be considered almost a done deal,&rdquo; said the source.</p>
<p>The economy ministry declined to comment on this story. Eni and Enel also both declined to comment.</p>
<p>Under Descalzi, Eni has transformed into one of Europe&rsquo;s most successful oil and gas explorers.</p>
<p>However, Italy&rsquo;s main ruling party, the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, has been highly critical in the past of Descalzi because of his involvement in a trial in Italy for alleged corruption over a 2011 oil deal in Nigeria.</p>
<p>The veteran oilman has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>HORSE TRADING</p>
<p>Political sources previously told Reuters Rome was leaning towards reappointing Descalzi.</p>
<p>A 5-Star source, also asking not to be named, said his party was pressing its coalition partners not to reappoint Starace at Enel, but the government official said the appointment would go ahead thanks to Starace&rsquo;s powerful supporters who include Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri.</p>
<p>Some key members of 5-Star have accused Starace of dragging his feet over a plan, backed by the party, to merge Telecom Italia&rsquo;s fib broadband assets with those of Open Fiber, controlled by Enel and state lender CDP.</p>
<p>The party has put the creation of a single ultrafast broadband network at the centre of its agenda in an effort to close the digital gap with the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re making a lot of noise but they are not really in a position to seriously challenge Starace&rsquo;s reappointment,&quot;, said the government official.</p>
<p>However, the nomination process at Italy&rsquo;s state-controlled companies is traditionally subject to lengthy horse trading, and the outcomes can be unpredictable and change suddenly on political vagaries.</p>
<p>Since taking over the top spot at Enel in 2014, the 65-year old Starace has won plaudits from investors for his financial results and transforming the former power monopoly into one of the biggest and cleanest utilities in the world.</p>
<p>If reappointed, Descalzi and Starace would both be given three-year terms.</p>
<p>The 5-Star Movement is also campaigning to replace Terna CEO Luigi Ferraris with Stefano Antonio Donnarumma, the head of utility Acea, the party source said.</p>
<p>A third source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters Ferraris might be appointed at the helm of railway group Ferrovie dello Stato.</p>
<p>Terna declined to comment.</p>

<p><img src="https://d346xxcyottdqx.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/photo-1579544787614-fa683917e045.jpg" alt="img">
Italy-headquartered energy group Enel is taking action at global level to face the Coronavirus (COVID-19) emergency.</p>
<p>It aims to minimise the spread of infection among its staff while ensuring the continuity of its business and service in the 33 countries where it operates.</p>
<p>Enel has set up a Global Task Force in order to coordinate and direct the actions to be taken those 33 countries. The Task Force provides official indications so that each country can manage any local emergencies that may occur.</p>
<p>In every country where it operates, Enel says it is constantly monitoring the information concerning COVID-19, taking preventive measures and all necessary actions. This is in accordance with the recommendations of the World Health Organisation and national and local authorities. The aim is to ensure the health and security of its staff, while guaranteeing the continuity of the service it provides.</p>

<p>In all countries, Enel is activating continuous teleworking (or telecommuting) for all its employees until further notice. An exception has, however, been made for activities that cannot be delayed as they are necessary in order to guarantee the continuity of the service and security of national electricity systems. This decision is in line with the precautionary actions that were adopted by the group at the beginning of the emergency.</p>

<p>Enel has also carried out a series of simulations, tests and verifications on its infrastructure, and says it has “encountered no issues for normal operations”. It adds that in light of the possible evolution of the situation, incremental measures have been set up for generation and network facilities that are necessary for the continuity of the service and the security of national electricity systems.</p>
<p>Finally, as of the end of February, the Group has cancelled all international travel, except for any journeys that are necessary for the continuity of service. It has also announced that all internal events and training courses must be carried out using virtual attendance tools. This is in order to ensure business continuity.</p>

<h3 id="is-enel-spa-bitenel-a-good-dividend-stock">Is Enel SpA (BIT:ENEL) A Good Dividend Stock?</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.simplywall.st/asset/industry/9521000-choice2-main-header/1585186610142" alt="img">
Dividend paying stocks like Enel SpA (BIT:ENEL) tend to be popular with investors, and for good reason – some research suggests a significant amount of all stock market returns come from reinvested dividends. If you are hoping to live on your dividends, it’s important to be more stringent with your investments than the average punter. Regular readers know we like to apply the same approach to each dividend stock, and we hope you’ll find our analysis useful.</p>
<p>In this case, Enel likely looks attractive to investors, given its 5.3% dividend yield and a payment history of over ten years. We’d guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. There are a few simple ways to reduce the risks of buying Enel for its dividend, and we’ll go through these below.</p>
<p>Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis</p>
<p>Payout ratios</p>
<p>Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable – hardly an ideal situation. Comparing dividend payments to a company’s net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Looking at the data, we can see that 156% of Enel’s profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. A payout ratio above 100% is definitely an item of concern, unless there are some other circumstances that would justify it.</p>
<p>We also measure dividends paid against a company’s levered free cash flow, to see if enough cash was generated to cover the dividend. Enel paid out 304% of its free cash flow last year, suggesting the dividend is poorly covered by cash flow. Paying out more than 100% of your free cash flow in dividends is generally not a long-term, sustainable state of affairs, so we think shareholders should watch this metric closely. Cash is slightly more important than profit from a dividend perspective, but given Enel’s payouts were not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we would definitely be concerned about the sustainability of this dividend.</p>
<p>Is Enel’s Balance Sheet Risky?</p>
<p>As Enel’s dividend was not well covered by earnings, we need to check its balance sheet for signs of financial distress. A rough way to check this is with these two simple ratios: a) net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and b) net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA is a measure of a company’s total debt. Net interest cover measures the ability to meet interest payments. Essentially we check that a) the company does not have too much debt, and b) that it can afford to pay the interest. Enel has net debt of 3.20 times its EBITDA, which is getting towards the limit of most investors’ comfort zones. Judicious use of debt can enhance shareholder returns, but also adds to the risk if something goes awry.</p>
<p>We calculated its interest cover by measuring its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), and dividing this by the company’s net interest expense. With EBIT of 3.78 times its interest expense, Enel’s interest cover is starting to look a bit thin.</p>
<p>Remember, you can always get a snapshot of Enel’s latest financial position, by checking our visualisation of its financial health.</p>
<p>Dividend Volatility</p>
<p>Before buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. Enel has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. Its dividend payments have declined on at least one occasion over the past ten years. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was €0.49 in 2010, compared to €0.34 last year. The dividend has shrunk at around 3.7% a year during that period. Enel’s dividend hasn’t shrunk linearly at 3.7% per annum, but the CAGR is a useful estimate of the historical rate of change.</p>
<p>A shrinking dividend over a ten-year period is not ideal, and we’d be concerned about investing in a dividend stock that lacks a solid record of growing dividends per share.</p>
<p>Dividend Growth Potential</p>
<p>Given that the dividend has been cut in the past, we need to check if earnings are growing and if that might lead to stronger dividends in the future. Strong earnings per share (EPS) growth might encourage our interest in the company despite fluctuating dividends, which is why it’s great to see Enel has grown its earnings per share at 31% per annum over the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very rapidly, although the company is also paying out virtually all of its profit in dividends. Generally, a company that is growing rapidly while paying out a majority of its earnings, is seeing its debt burden increase. We’d be conscious of any extra risk added by this practice.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Dividend investors should always want to know if a) a company’s dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. We’re a bit uncomfortable with Enel paying out a high percentage of both its cashflow and earnings. We were also glad to see it growing earnings, but it was concerning to see the dividend has been cut at least once in the past. In summary, Enel has a number of shortcomings that we’d find it hard to get past. Things could change, but we think there are likely more attractive alternatives out there.</p>
<p>Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. For example, we’ve identified 5 warning signs for Enel (1 is concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing.</p>
