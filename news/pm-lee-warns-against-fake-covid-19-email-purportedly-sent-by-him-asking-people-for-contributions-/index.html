SINGAPORE: An email purportedly sent by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong asking for &ldquo;contributions and thoughts&rdquo; as Singapore tackles the spread of COVID-19 is fake, said Mr Lee on Monday (Mar 30).</p>
<p>The incident has been reported to the police, Mr Lee added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fake email that purports to come from me is circulating online. The email gives an update on the COVID-19 situation, and encourages them to respond with their contributions and thoughts to the situation,&rdquo; Mr Lee wrote in a Facebook post.</p>
<p>He urged people not to respond to the email or provide any personal information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please do not forward it to your friends and family,&rdquo; Mr Lee said.</p>
<p>The email claims to have been sent using the Prime Minister&rsquo;s &ldquo;personal email&rdquo; account and thanks Singaporeans for their contributions towards the COVID-19 situation, while asking for a response.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are unscrupulous characters trying to exploit the current crisis to dupe you. Be extra careful, and stay safe online.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a statement, the Singapore Police Force confirmed that a report has been lodged and investigations are ongoing.</p>
<p>There have been cases of phishing scams in Singapore amid the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>Last Friday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said it was aware of scammers using automated voice calls or impersonating MOH employees or the contact tracing team.</p>
<p>They would ask people to provide personal information, including financial details, or ask them to collect documents from the ministry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;MOH will not ask for your financial details during contact tracing, and MOH will not ask you to collect documents from us, if you do not have existing matters with us,&rdquo; the ministry wrote on its website.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When in doubt, please verify the authenticity of phone calls by calling MOH hotline at 1800-333-9999. It is a good practice to always verify the authenticity of instructions before offering any personal information or making payments to anyone.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="barbra-streisand-praises-singapore-pm-lee-hsien-loong-over-response-to-covid-19">Barbra Streisand praises Singapore PM Lee Hsien Loong over response to COVID-19</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/BKKlXULcRH2TyGAQUhcO/convert?cache=true&amp;crop=28%2C0%2C1871%2C935&amp;crop_first=true&amp;h=300&amp;w=450" alt="img">
Barbra Streisand took to Twitter to praise Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong for his approach to handling the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In her tweet, the multi-award-winning singer and actress points out that Singapore has only incurred &ldquo;three deaths out of 6 million people&rdquo;, and praises PM Lee for speaking &ldquo;such common sense&rdquo; and &ldquo;[telling] people the truth&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister of Singapore (a country that only has three deaths out of 6 million people) speaks such common sense. He tells people the truth and they did everything that needed to be done to be ready for this virus. — Barbra Streisand (@BarbraStreisand) March 30, 2020</p>
<p>This may have been in response to PM Lee&rsquo;s recent interview with CNN&rsquo;s Fareed Zakaria on 29 March, where he cautioned that a long battle still lies ahead, explaining: &ldquo;I hesitate to talk about success because we are right in the midst of a battle, which is intensifying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are transparent—if there is bad news, we tell you. If there are things which need to be done, we also tell you. I think that you have to maintain that trust because if people do not trust you, even if you have the right measures, it is going to be very hard to get it implemented,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Singapore has also received praise from foreign health authorities, such as the World Health Organisation (WHO), for the containment of the outbreak. Author Margie Warrell has also written a post in Forbes detailing her quarantine in Singapore and the government&rsquo;s swift and decisive measures.</p>
<p>Streisand is a highly celebrated singer and actress, having been recognised with two Academy Awards, ten Grammy Awards, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress over the course of her career. She also became first woman to write, produce, direct, and star in a major studio film with the release of Yentl in 1983.</p>
<p>Her tweet caught the attention of Singaporeans, many of whom expressed pride. Comparisons to New Zealand&rsquo;s Prime Minister Jacinda Arden were also drawn.</p>
<p>New Zealand has a Prime Minister of the same ilk. Jacinda Ardern has handled a massacre in Christchurch this time last year, White Island Volcano eruption &amp; 20 deaths from that disaster &amp; now proving fantastic leadership with what is happening in our country right now. — artyfartystuff (@artyfartystuff) March 30, 2020</p>
<p>You trust those numbers? I dont — TAK (@manymanytimes) March 30, 2020</p>
<p>Yo Babs, dial it down or you&rsquo;ll jinx it for us!! — sylvia toh paik choo (@paikchoo) March 30, 2020
