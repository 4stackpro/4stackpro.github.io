<h3 id="baaghi-3-movie-review-can-we-fight-coronavirus-like-tiger-shroff-fights-bad-guys">Baaghi 3 Movie Review: Can we fight coronavirus like Tiger Shroff fights bad guys?</h3>
<p><img src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202003/baaghi_3_movie_review_india_to-647x363.jpeg?kV7KViKvZC36IeAvWDM7WIBAarvokHPS" alt="img">
Whack!</p>
<p>Baaghi 3, the third instalment of the super successful Baaghi franchise, remains true to its genre through its 143-minute runtime. Which means, there’s truckloads, no tank and chopper-loads of action, but zero logic. Amid corona scare, we walk into an empty theatre, deciding to stay away from the popcorn and coffee this time, because, you know, precautions. But 10 minutes into the film, we needed coffee more than Delhi needs hand sanitisers RN.</p>
<p>Ronnie (Tiger Shroff) and Vikram (Riteish Deshmukh) are two sons of inspector Chaturvedi (Jackie Shroff). While Ronnie inherited daddy’s cool bone-breaking combat moves, Vikram inherited nothing. He is so incapable of taking care of himself, that daddy, on his deathbed, asks kid-bro Ronnie to take care of big-bro Vikram. For the first time in Hindi film history.</p>
<p>The kids have some adult supervision, please, it’s not the 70s. Chacha Grandmaster Shifuji Shaurya Bhardwaj, not to be confused with Master Shifu even though there’s a Tiger and a Panda-like Vikram in the picture, is raising the kids.</p>
<p>Now Ronnie, bachpan se hi, enters in slow motion, especially when Vikram needs saving from brawls he inadvertently finds himself at the centre of. Ronnie also beats the bad guys up teeth flying, blood splattering because, &ldquo;Mujhpe aati hai toh main chhod deta hoon. Mere bhai pe aati hai, to main phod deta hoon,&rdquo; as Ronnie reveals matter-of-factly. And ladte-ladte, the kids grow up.</p>
<p>Smack!</p>
<p>Almost the entire first half goes into establishing a Ghazab-like (a 1982 film starring Dharmendra in a double role) premise. Vikram, who probably needed psychological attention in childhood, and we mean it extremely sensitively, joins the police force and is placed in a PS in Agra. Like the coronavirus, the two brothers travel to Agra. But Vikram cannot fight, so Ronnie proxy-fights for him, catching goons and reducing the crime rate in the city. It is important to mention here that they draw only one salary, not two. Overtime nahi milega.</p>
<p>Ronnie fights. Vikram wins medals. Vikram marries Ruchi (Ankita Lokhande). And Ronnie eyes Siya (Shraddha Kapoor), her sister. Life is in Hum Aapke Hain Koun-mode.</p>
<p>Ahmed Khan’s Baaghi 3 could have just been this. For the sake of a cool climax, all he needed to add is a local goonda threatening Vikram, and Ronnie turning him into jelly. Bas, The End. But nope. Bada socho. Mumbai? Aur bada. Dubai? Naah, Syria. There is a local goonda introduced, IPL bhai (the menacing Jaideep Ahlawat) in Agra, only to ultimately lead the virus-like brothers to Syria, and more importantly to Abu Jalal Gaza (Jameel Khoury. Even more menacing than Ahlawat. Way more kohl, way thicker eyebrows). Heavily modelled after Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (the one who the USA and Donald Trump executed in October 2019), Abu Jalal &ldquo;insaan nahi hai, parchhayi hai&rdquo;, as IPL bhai points out. But Ronnie must partake in chasing this shadow, because, Vikram has been kidnapped. Why? Remember when we said Vikram wins medals while Ronnie proxy-fights? Well, Vikram also won a spot at the anti-terrorist squad and was sent to Syria alone, literally, for an extraction.</p>
<p>Attack!</p>
<p>The rest of the story is a blur, partly from all the dust Ronnie throws up in the air, and partly because, well, there never was a story, just a parchhayi. There was certainly more fighting. Tiger vs massive men. Tiger vs guns. Tiger vs three choppers. Tiger vs five tanks. And Tiger won all of these, losing just his shirt. Several times over.</p>
<p>In terms of performances, Tiger’s abs take the cake, hands down, shirts off. A close second is his squint which is stuck to his face like disbelief on ours ever since we stepped into the theatre. But Tiger Shroff per se isn’t half as bad as Shraddha Kapoor. There’s bad acting, and then there is over-acting. Shraddha’s was bad over-acting. Go figure.</p>
<p>Israeli actor Jameel Khoury as Abu Jalal, a face you’d remember from Body of Lies (2008), Fauda (2015) and Jack Ryan (2018), is noteworthy. As is Jaideep Ahlawat. Both of whom have been dealt a bad hand in a script that favours not acting but acrobats. Vijay Verma makes an appearance as a Pakistani man willing to help an Indian in Syria against a common enemy. But his Mumbaiya &lsquo;kaiko&rsquo; mixed with Hyderabadi &lsquo;kya miyan&rsquo; leaves us utterly confused.</p>
<p>It is rather difficult to rate a film like Baaghi 3. Like the bullets the goons fire at our quintessential Bollywood hero, that always escape our leading man, our words and the general metric system escape us. We&rsquo;re still going to try.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going with 1.5 stars out of 5. For effort.</p>
