SINGAPORE - An online system has been created to help people with flu-like symptoms decide if they need to remain at home, see a doctor, visit a hospital or call for an ambulance.</p>
<p>Launched on Friday (April 3), the Covid-19 Symptom Checker assists users, who may have symptoms, in navigating the local healthcare system by ticking a few boxes.</p>
<p>It was created by a team comprising clinicians and computer scientists from the National University Health System (NUHS), National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), and the MOH Office for Healthcare Transformation (MOHT).</p>
<p>Users will have to select their age, recent travel history, the people they have been exposed to, and the symptoms they are having.</p>
<p>The result will tell them to either continue monitoring their symptoms, or to seek medical attention at the appropriate healthcare setting.</p>
<p>Professor Robert Morris, who is the chief technology strategist at MOHT said that it helps people cut through the &ldquo;deluge of information, better understand the significance of the symptoms they are experiencing, and get clear guidance about what steps they could take to seek care, and when&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The triage tool was developed after statistics from the Health Ministry (MOH) showed that close to one in four Covid-19 patients had consulted multiple doctors before testing positive for the virus.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that patients may not know when to see a doctor, or where to go, Dr Glorijoy Tan Shi En, who is an associate consultant at the NCID said that the aim of the checker is to &ldquo;empower people and their families with the right information, support and resources to make an informed personal decision, act at the right time, and not have to make a dash to the emergency department&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Associate Professor James Yip, group chief medical informatics officer at NUHS also added that more effective patient-direction can help reduce the burden on an already heavily taxed healthcare system.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The symptom checker is a way to optimise the healthcare system&rsquo;s resources, while getting the best outcome for the patient,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The system was tested with 69 users on March 23 and March 24 by a team led by Dr Franco Wong, head of Jurong Polyclinic. The trial runs validated the usability of the checker.</p>

<p>The team now hopes to expand its scope by including pre-registration for consultations at general practitioner (GP) clinics or Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs), access to telemedicine providers, and information on waiting times at emergency departments, among others.</p>
<p>Dr Praveen Deorani, who is a data scientist at MOHT said with more people using the checker, and with subsequent analysis of how it is being used, the developers can then use machine learning techniques to track the behaviour of the virus (and the symptoms it manifests) so the patient can elect the right locus of treatment at the right time.</p>
<p>The checker can be accessed at the website, or under the Covid-19 resources on the MOH website. Here are answers to some questions users may have:</p>
<p>What is the Covid-19 Symptom Checker?</p>
<p>It is a Web-based screening tool which allows individuals who experience flu-like symptoms amid the Covid-19 outbreak to run a quick self-check on their symptoms and receive advice on their next step.</p>
<p>How does it help?</p>
<p>The tool is a good information resource when one feels unwell and is unsure of what to do next.</p>
<p>It helps individuals remain calm, and to refrain from doctor-hopping amid the evolving situation.</p>
<p>This could help reduce community transmission, allay fears that people might have of their symptoms and of contracting Covid-19 when visiting a healthcare facility.</p>
<p>Does it collect or share my data?</p>
<p>The checker was validated by a team led by Dr Franco Wong, who is head of Jurong Polyclinic.</p>
<p>Following earlier test runs, NUHS conducted surveys and found that nearly 60 per cent of respondents were open to using an online-based checker, and 79 per cent of respondents felt that the checker was &ldquo;easy to use&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The site does not collect any personal identifiable data, but information collected offers an overview of the different types of patients who are worried about the Covid-19 virus.</p>
<p>The data provide insights on public concerns and needs, and could help MOH with patient education and communication.</p>
<p>Is the tool aligned with the local health institutions?</p>
<p>Yes, it is jointly launched by teams from the NCID and NUHS, who provided clinical advice for the platform.</p>
<p>The recommendations are also aligned with MOH and World Health Organisation guidelines.

April 3, 2020 &ndash; A little over 3 weeks ago, Emory University Hospital emergency room doctor Justin Schrager, MD, was living at home with his wife and two young children, awaiting the birth of their third child.</p>
<p>Slowly, his ER began to fill with patients who had COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. “I work in the area with the semi-critical patients, the ones that need higher-level care. I haven’t to my knowledge been exposed … but I’m sure I have been, because it’s been pretty wild.”</p>
<p>Once his wife had their baby, they made the difficult decision for him to isolate himself in a garage apartment for the foreseeable future. “I just didn’t feel like it was safe for me to be around a newborn … the data [on newborns and the coronavirus] is so sparse, I just didn’t feel comfortable,” says Schrager.</p>
<p>His wife, Rachel Patzer, PhD, an epidemiologist at Emory, tweeted about the heart-wrenching decision, only to have her tweet about the family’s struggles go “viral” when former President Barack Obama then retweeted her thread. Obama encouraged all Americans to thank front-line staff and show appreciation for their sacrifice by practicing social distancing.</p>
<p>In the 3 weeks since his “exile,” Schrager says he has been working nonstop to help patients struggling with life in a world with COVID-19. He works not only on the front lines in the ER, but as part of a team that’s created an online, globally accessible tool, C19check, that they hope will help calm patients who are worried about milder symptoms and help make emergency rooms less crowded.

<h3 id="coronavirus-symptom-checker-covid-19-advice-in-the-usa-and-uk">Coronavirus symptom checker: Covid-19 advice in the USA and UK</h3>
<p><img src="https://as01.epimg.net/en/imagenes/2020/03/31/other_sports/1585611422_793930_1585612357_noticia_normal.jpg" alt="img">
If you are worried you or a loved one might be suffering from Covid-19 the online coronavirus symptom checkers being offered by the CDC in the USA and the NHS in England are a good first port of call.</p>
<p>USA online coronavirus symptom checker</p>
<p>In the United States of America, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention offer an online advice centre for Covid-19, including an online coronavirus symptom checker.</p>
<p>According to the CDC, coronavirus symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure (it bases this on the incubation of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome virus, another member of the coronavirus family that can infect humans).</p>
<p>The coronavirus symptoms are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cough</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shortness of breath</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Seek medical attention</p>
<p>The CDC advises that medical attention is immediately sought if you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Trouble breathing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persistent pain or pressure in the chest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confusion that has just started, or inability to arouse</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bluish lips or face</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The list is noted to not be inclusive and where there are other severe or concerning symptoms you should consult your medical provider.</p>
<p>NHS England online coronavirus symptom checker</p>
<p>The NHS in England uses a coronavirus symptom checker questionnaire to help you decide what you should do if you think you might have Covid-19. (Note the NHS in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own services). To use the service you are required to enter a valid postcode in England, though this is not checked against the location of your computer or smartphone.</p>
<p>The first thing the symptom checker notes is that you should directly call the coronavirus help line on 111 if you calling about a child under five-years-old.</p>
<p>After asking for your sex and age the checker overs a direct option to “Get help if you’re worried about coronavirus”.</p>
<p>Main coronavirus symptoms</p>
<p>The main questions the symptom checker asks about are:</p>
<p>Temperature: whether you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</p>
<p>Cough: whether you have a new continuous cough</p>
<p>According to the service, if you have neither a high temperature or a cough you are unlikely to have coronavirus.</p>
<p>If however you have either a temperature or a cough the NHS direction is clear. “You need to stay away from other people”, because the symptoms suggest you could have a coronavirus infection.</p>
<p>Coronavirus: other symptoms</p>
<p>The symptom checker then takes the patient through a series of more detailed questions, offering various different outcomes.</p>
<p>If you are extremely breathless, unable to speak more than a few words, or your breathing is harder or faster than usual and getting worse you should call an ambulance (999 in the UK) straight away.</p>
<p>Where that is not the case the symptom checker asks a further series of questions, covering</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>daily activities (whether you have stopped doing what you usually do or not, and how you feel)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whether you suffer from any confusion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whether you have been told that getting an infection might be very serious, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whether you have been told to isolate yourself for the next 12 weeks.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In any of these cases the advice will be to call a nurse on the coronavirus line (111).</p>
<p>Where the symptoms suggest coronavirus, but the symptoms are not serious or there is no underlying issue the advice will likely be for the patient and the people they live with to self-isolate.</p>
<p>Please note this summary does not cover all eventualities covered by the symptom checker and if you are in any doubt whatsoever about your condition you should contact your medical provider.</p>
<p>The NHS also offers general advice for everyone, including advice on staying at home to prevent coronavirus spreading; how to stop the infection spreading; and how to look after your general health and wellbeing during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Comparing coronavirus, cold and flu</p>
<p>In general, the main Covid-19 symptoms are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some people infected with the virus will also suffer aches and pains, nasal congestion, excess mucus, sore throat and diarrhoea. Another noted symptom has been loss of the sense of taste and smell.</p>
<p>In the majority of cases the symptoms are mild and progressively disappear. Some people have asymptomatic infections and will be infected with the virus without even knowing it. Where the patient has difficulty breathing or serious respiratory problems it is vital to get in touch with local emergency services and seek medical attention.</p>
