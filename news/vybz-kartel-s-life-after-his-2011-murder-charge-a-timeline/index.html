News broke on Friday (April 3) that a three-member Jamaican court of appeals panel has upheld Vybz Kartel’s 2014 murder conviction.</p>
<p>Since his original charge back in 2011, the reggae dancehall recording artist, born Adidja Palmer, has been through a series of legal troubles and has even continued an active music career from prison.</p>
<p>Since this legal process started nine years ago, Billboard has compiled a timeline of Vybz&rsquo;s journey from 2011 to now as a refresher. See it below.</p>
<p>October 2011 - First charges</p>
<p>Following an arrest in September, Jamaica&rsquo;s Major Investigation Taskforce (MIT) last night charged the controversial superstar with murder, conspiracy to murder and illegal possession of a firearm. Police charged that on July 11, 2011, Kartel along with other men conspired to murder Barrington &lsquo;Bossie&rsquo; Burton, a 27-year-old businessman and music promoter based in the Kingston suburb of Portmore. Burton was murdered while standing with friends along Walkers Avenue in the Gregory Park area of Portmore.</p>
<p>December 2011 - Ongoing legal problems</p>
<p>Jamaica&rsquo;s Supreme Court judge Martin Gayle ordered Kartel to pay JA$15,000,000 (US$173,066) in damages to Jamaican promoter Alton Salmon due to his failure to perform at a concert on August 14, 2009 in the Turks and Caicos islands. According to the Jamaica Gleaner newspaper, Salmon entered into a verbal contract with Kartel and agreed to pay him $18,000 to perform at The Real Rampin Shop concert, adapted from the early 2009 Kartel hit &ldquo;Rampin Shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kartel reportedly accepted a deposit of $8,500 from Salmon with the balance to be paid at the end of the show. But his failure to appear at Turks and Caicos event was reported to have caused a riot at the venue and severely damaged his reputation as a promoter. Salmon filed a lawsuit against the dancehall star, accusing him of breach of contract but Kartel failed to file acknowledgement of service and did not attempt to defend the suit.</p>
<p>March 2014 - Found guilty</p>
<p>The 65-day trial was, at the time, the longest running criminal hearing in the history of Jamaica’s circuit court system. Kartel was found guilty, as were his associates, Shawn Campbell (a.k.a. Shawn Storm) Kahira Jones and Andre St. John. The fourth associate Shane Williams, received the sole non-guilty verdict.</p>
<p>April 2014 - Life sentence</p>
<p>Justice Lennox Campbell in Jamaica&rsquo;s Supreme Court handed Kartel a life sentence. Kartel will not be eligible for parole until he serves 35 years of his life sentence, while Shawn Campbell and Kahira Jones will be eligible for parole after serving 25 years of their life sentences; Andre St. John will be eligible for parole after serving 15 years of his life sentence.</p>
<p>He also faced charges of attempting to pervert the course of justice. Police reported that Kartel&rsquo;s protégé, singer Vanessa Saddler a.k.a Gaza Slim, and an associate went to a Kingston precinct where Saddler filed a statement claiming she had been robbed at knifepoint by Williams five days after Palmer was charged with his murder. According to police, evidence exists, including phone records, indicating that Palmer instructed Saddler to report the robbery.</p>
<p>2016 through 2020 - Music in prison</p>
<p>Despite being behind bars, Kartel has managed to release a steady stream of tunes, including a number of full-length albums. In 2016, he unveiled King of Dancehall, followed by To Tanesha in 2020.</p>
<p>October 2019 - XXXTentacion&rsquo;s &ldquo;Royalty&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only did Kartel release his own music, he was also featured in a posthumous song called &ldquo;Royalty&rdquo; by XXXTentacion. The accompaying visual is shot through the eyes of the late Triple X, memorialized with a beautiful mural at the onset of the flick. He digs for a deeper connection to his island roots with a trip to Jamaica.</p>
<p>April 2020 - Conviction upheld</p>
<p>The Kingston court released a 235-page opinion detailing its reasoning in dismissing the appeals of Kartel, Campbell, Jones and St. John, and in affirming their convictions. The court is still considering the length of their sentences in light of the time they have already spent in jail.</p>
<p>According to court papers, the case against them was based on a combination of direct and circumstantial evidence. The appeals court judges decided that, despite the absence of a body, the jury considered the prosecution&rsquo;s evidence of an orchestrated plan along with the technology evidence and witness testimony in making its guilty finding.

<h3 id="diaspora-weighs-in-on-kartel---expect-a-national-response-whatever-the-verdict">Diaspora weighs in on Kartel - Expect a national response whatever the verdict</h3>
<p><img src="http://jamaica-gleaner.com/sites/default/files/styles/250px/public/media/article_images/2020/04/03/793664/3478831.jpg?itok=2kIsd20q" alt="img">
In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent lockdown, there is an air of expectancy in some sections of the Jamaican diaspora in the New York Tri-State area. It can be summed up in two words – Vybz Kartel. News that Kartel will know his fate this morning, when the long-awaited judgment in his appeal will be handed down, has started many conversations and predictions.</p>
<p>Wayne Hall, the host of The Wayne Hall Show, who hails from Ewarton in St Catherine, told The Gleaner that whatever the verdict, Jamaicans should expect a national response. “On the eve of Vybz Kartel’s appeal verdict, one cannot deny it comes with mixed feelings. For many, it’s a revisit of a painful episode. For others, they are optimistic for a positive decision. It comes at a crucial time as the country is locked down due to the coronavirus pandemic. It will be interesting to see how it plays out with the wider public,” Hall said.</p>
<p>He added: “At the recently held IRAWMA, he won two of the top awards. Obviously, he still has tremendous support.”</p>
<p>For a Jamaican living in the Bronx, Kenton Cole, president of Solja Records Inc, it was great news, and his opinion is that for the greater good of dancehall, Kartel should be released.</p>
<p>‘BIGGEST INFLUENCE ON A GLOBAL PLATFORM’</p>
<p>“I’m glad to hear that finally after all this time they are going to hand down the verdict. The fact that stuff in Jamaica is under lockdown might affect it, but the way that Jamaica seems to have the COVID-19 thing somewhat under control, they should be able to make the announcement. I think that outside of Bob Marley, Kartel is the biggest influence on a global platform. Bob Marley was reggae, but as far as dancehall – there were a lot of legends before Kartel, Ninja Man, Super Cat, Beenie Man – but he has taken dancehall to greater heights. Whatever it is about him, whether it is his personality or his lyrical ability, I rate Kartel as the top artiste for dancehall. He would have made a great politician. Look at how him have the masses in dancehall even from behind bars. There’s no denying his ability.”</p>
<p>FaceVU television producer, Jerry McDonald, is urging responsible behaviour from the Gaza Nation, in light of the coronavirus. The St Ann resident, who now lives in the Bronx, NY, told The Gleaner, “If the ruling is in favour of Kartel, I don’t think corona will hinder Gaza fans from celebrating in numbers. But I would implore them to do the responsible thing and celebrate on the various social-media platforms and refrain from going out on the streets, as this could set back all the positive strides we have made with social distancing in the past two to three weeks.”</p>
<p>HOPEFUL</p>
<p>Mechanical engineer Esroy Bernard is hopeful that the appeal will be in Kartel’s favour, but he, too, has a word of caution. “I hope he wins this appeal and gets out. However, everyone in the society should know that they are not above the law. I know there are going to be celebrations across many aspects of the dancehall fraternity, but they should be tempered by the state of emergency that we have going on in Jamaica right now.”</p>
<p>Broadcast journalist based in Connecticut, Donovan Longmore of WESU 8.1 FM, while heaping praise on Kartel as a lyricist, had serious words for the self-professed Worl’ Boss. “It’s sad to see an intelligent individual, who is also one of the best lyricists of our time, get caught up in such a shameful and deplorable act. There are records of tampering with the case which yield serious shades of corruption. In Connecticut, the younger dancehall fans are still chanting for the Worl’ Boss’ freedom, while most of the more mature music lovers are uttering the guilty plea. I, for one, believe that Kartel deserves a complete fair trial and, if proven guilty, then he must pay for his actions.”</p>
<p>Connecticut promoter Junior Wellington had few words on the subject. “I don’t condone wrong behaviour, if you were found guilty then you should serve your penalty. Not because one is a ‘celebrity’, they shouldn’t be treated differently.”</p>
<p>Vybz Kartel’s appeal hearing got under way in July 2018. The entertainer and his co-accused Shawn Campbell, Kahira Jones, and Andre St John were convicted in 2014 for the 2011 murder of Clive ‘Lizard’ Williams.</p>
<p>The four were given life sentences at the Home Circuit Court in Kingston.</p>

<h3 id="vybz-kartels-quick-quick-quick-video-release-done-from-prison-watch--dancehallmag">Vybz Kartel&rsquo;s ‘Quick, Quick, Quick&rsquo; Video Release, Done From Prison: Watch – DancehallMag</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.dancehallmag.com/assets/2020/03/kartel-1.jpg" alt="img">
The world Boss is at it again. Today, the official video for one of Vybz Kartel’s single ‘Quick, Quick, Quick’ was released. The track was released in December 2019.</p>
<p>Voiced by the ‘Teacha’, the new video was released as fans and the authorities are still finding their footing, lost due to Kartel’s surprise -Live on Instagram (from prison) 4 days ago.</p>
<p>The visuals open as a reflective perspective of his first sexual encounter, being taught as a young youth by a far more mature female. He paid homage to her skills as his teacher, and his obvious brilliance as a student, who has learned, practiced and is now progressing well.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The Worl’ Boss expresses high regards for his sexual journey, metaphorically jingled by the words ‘quick quick quick’ to his taxi service providers – “Quick quick quick cabi, yow a Addi, pick up dutty gyal fah mi inna lobby, doh stop fi nuhbody, just trod it, doh left nuh evidence destroy it.”</p>
<p>In an almost lyrical commentary Kartel details his transition from apprentice to the ‘Boss’, rising to prominence with an establish service structure for the quick entrance and exit of his consorts. Every repeat of the chorus speaks of his renown performance and the impact of his sexual encounters. Where his system of quick execution not only impacts the financial confidence of his beloved Waterford Portmore taxi community, it also also gave rise to much infidelity – “mi mek yuh precious wife cyan keep har promise”</p>
<p>Watch the official video for Quick, Quick, Quick.
