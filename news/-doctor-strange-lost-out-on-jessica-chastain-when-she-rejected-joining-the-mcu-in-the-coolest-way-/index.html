Marvel missed a big opportunity to pair Benedict Cumberbatch and Jessica Chastain in Doctor Strange. A screenwriter for the project revealed that Marvel wanted to cast Chastain to play Cumberbatch’s romantic interest in the film. But instead of joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Chastain rejected the offer in the “coolest” way possible.</p>

<p>Chastain wants to be a superhero</p>
<p>Chastain’s wish to become a superhero came true when she landed the part of Vuk in Dark Phoenix. The shape-shifting creature was a villain in the movie who manipulated Sophie Turner’s Jean Grey.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the film was a major bomb for Fox, making only $250 million in worldwide ticket sales against a $200 million budget. Doctor Strange, on the other hand, had a budget of around $200 million and pulled down $677 million at the box office.</p>
<p>The film was also released around the same time that Disney bought out Fox, a deal that gave Marvel the rights to X-Men. The studio will likely reboot the entire franchise, especially given its lackluster reception over the years.</p>
<p>It is unclear if Chastain will ever reprise her role as Vuk now that X-Men is under the Marvel umbrella. But there was a time when she was offered a spot in the MCU and turned it down.</p>
<p>Chastain rejects Marvel’s ‘Doctor Strange’</p>
<p>Screenwriter C. Robert Cargill recently opened up about Chastain’s rejection on his podcast titled Junkfood Cinema. According to Indie Wire, Cargill revealed that Marvel wanted to cast Chastain as Christine Palmer, but the actress had no interest in joining the MCU unless it was as a superhero.</p>
<p>“She’s like, ‘Hey, look, this project sounds awesome, and I would love to do it. But I’m only going to get one shot at being in a Marvel film and becoming a Marvel character, and I trained in ballet, and I really want to wear a cape,’” Cargill explained. “It was the coolest rejection ever…”</p>
<p>Doctor Strange was a big hit for Marvel in 2016. The movie’s success opened the door for the upcoming sequel, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.</p>
<p>#JessicaChastain &ldquo;really wanted to be the superhero, not the badass doctor Night Nurse,&rdquo; reveals Doctor Strange writer C Robert Cargill | @Marvelhttps://t.co/kkyhSKaOJS — Firstpost (@firstpost) April 4, 2020</p>
<p>After Chastain’s rejection, Rachel McAdams got the part, though we still do not know if she will be reprising the role in the sequel.</p>
<p>The Multiverse of Madness was originally scheduled to open in theaters in the spring of 2021. The studio has now pushed the release date to November of that same year. Director Sam Raimi will be replacing Scott Derrickson at the helm.</p>
<p>‘Doctor Strange 2’ delayed</p>
<p>Due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Marvel recently announced its plans to delay all of the Phase 4 projects. This includes Doctor Strange 2, though Derrickson believes the delays will turn out to be a good thing.</p>
<p>Taking to Twitter, Derrickson revealed that Doctor Strange suffered a five-month delay because of Cumberbatch’s busy filming schedule. The extra time allowed Derrickson and his team to flush out the script and figure out the visual effects.</p>
<p>“The pushing of all these big tentpole release dates will increase their overall quality — more time for script &amp; production design development. Blade Runner looks so amazing because Ridley Scott &amp; his team took a year during the 80-81 actors &amp; WGA strikes to perfect the visuals,” Derrickson added.</p>
<p>Marvel was originally slated to kick off Phase 4 with the release of Black Widow in May. That film has been pushed back to November, while The Eternals will now open in theaters in February of 2021.</p>
<p>Fans were pretty disappointed by the delays, but if Derrickson is right, the postponements will result in a better end product.</p>
<p>Everything we know about the ‘Multiverse of Madness’</p>
<p>With Doctor Strange 2 not scheduled to hit theaters until 2021, filming will likely get underway sometime in the fall. Unfortunately, Marvel has been very tight-lipped about the project, though fans have speculated about which villain might appear in the film.</p>
<p>Several villains have been thrown into the discussion, including Nightmare and Mephisto. But some fans believe that Karl Mordo will actually be the main antagonist. We already know that Chiwetel Ejiofor will be reprising his role as Mordo, so it is not that big of a leap to think he will be the villain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&rsquo; is reportedly still on track to begin filming in June</p>
<p>(via @Variety | https://t.co/ny0V4nXtTS) pic.twitter.com/GFXgjLL5cm — Fandom (@getFANDOM) March 26, 2020</p>
<p>We also know that the events in WandaVision and Loki will have an impact on the Multiverse of Madness. Both of these shows are scheduled to premiere before Doctor Strange 2, so fans will have to wait and see how things unfold.</p>
<p>Marvel has not commented on the reports surrounding Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.

<p>Jessica Chastain and her husband Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo have ‘welcomed their second child in secret’.</p>
<p>The Zero Dark Thirty actress has reportedly given birth to her second child as the pair were spotted with two children while on a walk in California last week.</p>
<p>She was seen with her 37-year-old hubby who was pushing their toddler Giulietta in a pram while Jessica had a carrier wrapped around her chest.</p>
<p>A source told Page Six: ‘They were really enjoying themselves. The baby seemed to be sleeping soundly the entire time.’</p>
<p>The 43-year-old hasn’t confirmed the news to the public, and it was never reported she was pregnant.</p>
<p>Gian and Jessica began dating in 2012 and married in 2017.</p>
<p>They’ve always been private about their personal lives, welcoming Giuletta in a similar manner back in April 2018.</p>

<h3 id="doctor-strange-writer-praises-jessica-chastain-for-rejecting-mcu-in-the-coolest-way">‘Doctor Strange’ Writer Praises Jessica Chastain for Rejecting MCU in the ‘Coolest Way’</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/shutterstock_editorial_10372323cj.jpg" alt="img">
The Oscar-nominated actress allegedly had no interest in joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe if she couldn&rsquo;t be a superhero.</p>
<p>Add Jessica Chastain to the list of actors who turned down the Marvel Cinematic Universe, inarguably the most dominant franchise at the worldwide box office. During a recent appearance on his Sticher podcast “Junkfood Cinema” (via The Independent), “Doctor Strange” screenwriter C. Robert Cargill revealed Marvel was courting Chastain to star as love interest Christine Palmer opposite Benedict Cumberbatch in the 2016 MCU tentpole. The role eventually went to Rachel McAdams. According to Cargill, Chastain rejected the offer because she had no interest in joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe as just an ordinary human character.</p>
<p>“She’s like, ‘Hey, look, this project sounds awesome, and I would love to do it. But I’m only going to get one shot at being in a Marvel film and becoming a Marvel character; and I trained in ballet, and I really want to wear a cape,’” Cargill said. “It’s the coolest rejection ever…She wanted to be in a Marvel movie, but she wanted to be the superhero, not the badass doctor Night Nurse.”</p>
<p>Chastain would go on to make her comic book movie debut in “Dark Phoenix,” playing the villainous shape-shifting alien Vuk. That Fox-backed superhero tentpole was an infamous critical and box office bomb in summer 2019, tapping out with just $250 million globally on a $200 million production budget. “Doctor Strange” was a hit in fall 2016. The Marvel film made $677 million worldwide and will be getting an upcoming sequel entitled “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.”</p>
<p>Popular on IndieWire</p>
<p>The “Doctor Strange” sequel is expected to take the MCU into horror territory and will pair Cumberbatch’s eponymous hero with Elizabeth Olsen’s Scarlet Witch. McAdams is not expected to reprise her role as Christine Palmer in the film, which will find “Spider-Man” helmer Sam Raimi replacing Scott Derrickson in the director’s chair. Cargill is also not involved with the final version as Michael Waldron, the screenwriter behind the MCU Disney+ series “Loki,” is rewriting the sequel script.</p>
<p>While Chastain passed on the MCU, she’s had success in other studio fare such as “It: Chapter Two.” The actress is set to appear opposite Andrew Garfield later this year in Searchlight’s biographical drama “The Eyes of Tammy Faye” and also has the action vehicle “355” in the pipeline.</p>
