McCALL, Idaho — It was a typical Tuesday evening at the Albertsons grocery store in this resort town about 100 miles north of Boise.</p>
<p>Until Susie Baker looked up and saw all the hanging aisle signs swinging back and forth.</p>
<p>“Then I thought I heard a sound … and the floor was moving,” said Baker, a checker at the store.</p>
<p>It was the force of the most powerful earthquake to strike the Gem State since 1983, a magnitude 6.5 temblor that jolted people across Idaho and three neighboring states. No injuries or damage were immediately reported.</p>
<p>The quake was centered 73 miles northeast of Meridian, near Boise, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, and, for some, conjured up memories of the state&rsquo;s worst such natural disaster, the 6.9 magnitude Borah Peak earthquake nearly four decades ago that killed two people and resulted in millions in damages, according to the Idaho Geological Survey.</p>
<p>“At first I thought it was thunder, weird thunder, but then the house was moving and I realized this is an earthquake — a really big earthquake,” said Melissa Hawkins, 44, who lives in northwest Boise with her family. “It felt like it was in Boise.”</p>
<p>The prolonged shaking, Hawkins said, brought back childhood memories of the Borah Peak quake, which also hit in a remote part of Idaho but was felt in the capital city. She remembers lights in the house swinging then, and saw that same phenomenon Tuesday.</p>
<p>“I was yelling at the kids to get in the doorways. They didn’t know what was going on,” she said.</p>
<p>Elisa Bullock said she and her husband were on their back deck in Boise trying to cut their dog&rsquo;s nails when the ground began shaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably the least-safe place in our house and we just stood there,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;When it stopped, I looked at Brandt and yelled, &lsquo;Get in a door jam.&rsquo; We will be implementing earthquake drills starting tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were no initial reports of damage, the Boise Police Department said on Twitter, while acknowledging, &ldquo;Yep we felt it too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay safe out there Boise,&rdquo; the tweet said. &ldquo;Call us if you need us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were reports that the earthquake was felt in Coeur d’Alene, Twin Falls and Hailey in Idaho; Spokane, Washington; Missoula and Bozeman, Montana; and Salt Lake City in Utah.</p>
<p>“It felt like the whole house was shaking,” said Jim Tracy, 81, who was looking at model airplanes on his computer at a friend&rsquo;s house in McCall. “It lasted so long I knew that it was a big one.”</p>
<p>Another McCall resident, Linda Humpherys, 73, was stunned by the quake.</p>
<p>“You know how it feels when you are sitting on a plane and someone behind you starts kicking your seat? That’s what I was feeling, but I was on my bed,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Then the chandelier was shaking back and forth.”</p>
<p>Some 375 miles away in Evaro, Montana, near Missoula, Shannon Patton felt the ground shaking, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I actually thought I was having a dizzy spell to begin with due to my migraine,&rdquo; Patton said in an email. &ldquo;Our light fixtures were shaking and one of our signs on our pantry door almost fell off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A 4.8 magnitude aftershock, centered southwest of Challis, followed about an hour later, the USGS said on Twitter. Smaller aftershocks continued into the evening hours.</p>
<p>The Borah Peak earthquake is the largest ever recorded in Idaho — both in magnitude and property damage, according to the IGS. The towns of Challis and Mackay took the brunt, with 11 commercial buildings and 39 private homes suffering major damage.</p>

<h3 id="i-heard-the-roar-65-earthquake-hits-idaho">&lsquo;I heard the roar&rsquo;: 6.5 earthquake hits Idaho</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106469882-1585740606361ap_20092059534579.jpg?v=1585740693" alt="img">
A large earthquake struck north of Boise Tuesday evening, with people across a large area reporting shaking.</p>
<p>The U.S. Geological Survey reports the magnitude 6.5 temblor struck just before 6 p.m. It was centered 73 miles (118 kilometers) northeast of Meridian, near the rural mountain town of Stanley. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.</p>
<p>More than 2 million live in the region that could feel the Idaho quake, according to the USGS, with reports of shaking coming in from as far away as Helena, Montana, and Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
<p>Marcus Smith, an emergency room health unit coordinator at St. Luke&rsquo;s Wood River Medical Center, said the hospital, about 65 miles (104 kilometers) south of the epicenter, shook but the quake didn&rsquo;t interfere with the treatment of any patients. The hospital in Blaine County is on the front line of Idaho&rsquo;s coronavirus outbreak, in a region with the nation&rsquo;s highest per-capita rates of known COVID-19 cases outside of New York City and its surrounding counties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It felt like a wave going through the ground, so I knew right away what it was. It just felt like waves going through the ground,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The earthquake added stress during an already tense time for the region, but Smith said everything seemed fine, for now. &ldquo;Until the next one, I guess,&rdquo; Smith said. &ldquo;I mean, that&rsquo;s what we do. We&rsquo;re all good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brett Woolley, the owner of Bridge Street Grill in Stanley, said he heard the earthquake coming before he felt it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard the roar, and at first it sounded like the wind but then the roar was tremendous,&rdquo; Woolley said about 10 minutes after the earthquake. &ldquo;The whole house was rattling, and I started to panic. I&rsquo;m sitting here perfectly still and the water next to me is still vibrating.&rdquo;
