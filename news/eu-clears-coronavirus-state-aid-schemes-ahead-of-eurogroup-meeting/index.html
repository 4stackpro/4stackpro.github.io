The European Commission has approved a series of multi-billion-euro state support packages for Greece, Poland and Portugal to help soften the economic impact of the coronavirus through grants and loan guarantees.</p>
<p>The Commission, which enforces EU anti-trust regulation, loosened its rules last month to allow EU governments to support businesses and banks after factories began to fall quiet and Europeans were ordered to stay home to stop the virus spreading.</p>
<p>In a series of statements late on Friday and on Saturday, the Commission approved a €13 billion state aid programme for the Portuguese economy, a €22 billion plan of state guarantees for Poland and a €2 billion scheme for Greece.</p>
<p>The schemes were judged not to distort EU competition.</p>
<p>“This Polish guarantee scheme will help Polish businesses affected by the current coronavirus crisis cover their immediate working capital and investment needs,” Commission Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.</p>
<p>For Portugal, Vestager said the €13 billion would “enable Portugal to provide direct grants and public guarantees on loans to help small-and-medium-sized companies and large companies cover investment and working capital needs”.</p>
<p>The Greek scheme allows for state guarantees on working capital loans, Vestager said.</p>
<p>Commission readies ‘crisis scheme’ for state aid approval The European Commission prepared a temporary framework to fast-track state aid approval as a response to the coronavirus (COVID-19), last used in the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2008.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Commission approved a €9.1 billion Swedish guarantee scheme to support the economy in the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>Germany, France, Italy, the UK, the Netherlands and many others have also obtained clearance from EU competition authorities to support their economies during the crisis (full list here).</p>
<p>By mid march, Euro area countries had mobilised around 1% of their GDP (€120 billion) to fighting the economic fallout from the coronavirus. But the total amount could quickly exceed those sums as the crisis unfolds.</p>
<p>EU assistance</p>
<p>European solidarity mechanisms are also being considered to support EU economies during the coronavirus outbreak, although disagreements persist over the strings attached to EU assistance.</p>
<p>Leaders clash over stimulus against pandemic, pass hot potato to Eurogroup EU leaders on Thursday (26 March) continued to disagree over the economic response to the coronavirus as Northern countries rejected the idea of issuing joint debt, known as “corona bonds”, proposed by nine member states to finance the recovery.</p>
<p>The eurozone’s rescue fund could offer up to €240 billion to help member countries hit badly by the coronavirus outbreak, said Mario Centeno, the Portuguese finance minister who heads the eurogroup.</p>
<p>In an interview with several European newspapers published Saturday (4 April), Centeno said any credit line should be designed to help, not make matters worse for those states needing aid.</p>
<p>This was an apparent reference to the ESM’s normal rules which include often tough austerity conditions attached to its loans.</p>
<p>“There would be no sense in linking a pandemic crisis to a programme of (say) privatisation or reform of the labour market,” Centeno told French daily Le Figaro ahead of a videoconference of eurozone finance ministers on Tuesday.</p>
<p>He conceded that there would be some “form of conditionality… but the ESM is ready to dissociate its credit lines from the logic of the sovereign debt crisis.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Thierry Breton, the EU’s internal market commissioner, called on EU countries over the weekend to invest “around 10% of their GDP” to relaunch the economy after the pandemic.</p>
<p>“In total, it could reach €1.6 trillion,” he told Le Parisien newspaper on Sunday (5 April).

<h3 id="eurogroup-to-discuss-eus-rescue-plan-from-covid-19">Eurogroup to discuss EU’s rescue plan from Covid-19</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.neweurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/h_55705957.jpg" alt="img">
The finance ministers of Eurogroup are due to meet on Tuesday, after being tasked by the EU27 leaders to come up with proposals on the Union’s exit plan from the Covid-19 havoc. During previous videoconferences held, divisions were deep among member-states, which failed to agree on a common European fiscal response to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Germany and the Netherlands were reluctant to issuing common debt with other European nations and in particular with highly indebted countries such as Greece and Italy. As for Angela Merkel’s country, the ‘Corona bonds’ scenario would be a synonym to lack of budgetary discipline for the countries of Europe’s south. Similarly, the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, kept a hardline stance to the temporary eurobonds for Covid-19, proposing instead a gift fund of €10-20 bn, whereby member states would donate for the countries worst-hit by the virus.</p>
<p>Both countries pointed at already existing tools, namely the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and the €410 bn available to countries worst-hit by the virus’ outbreak through credit lines, while they also acknowledged the European Central Bank’s €750 bn stimulus and the Commission’s €100 bn job-support SURE mechanism.</p>
<p>A lending facility from the European Investment Bank (EIB) is also on the table, for the mobilisation of €200 bn of investments, through the creation of a pan-European guarantee fund of €25 bn, that would leverage support for SMEs hit by the pandemic.</p>
<p>As the South is claiming that Europe has not learnt its lesson from the previous Eurozone debt crisis, the formation of a new common debt instrument, and in particular ‘Coronabonds’ to finance the post-virus recovery is a request by nine member-states, including Spain, Greece, France and Italy. Yet, on Monday, Merkel reiterated her government’s position of activating ESM, without mentioning any debt-pooling scenario.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Mário Centeno, the Eurogroup’s President urged the euro area finance ministers to be ‘creative’, when it comes to the fresh money required for EU’s recovery plan.

<h3 id="greek-pm-mitsotakis-holds-video-conference-ahead-of-eurogroup">Greek PM Mitsotakis Holds Video Conference ahead of Eurogroup</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/5067187-760x507.jpg" alt="img">
ATHENS – Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis on Tuesday had a video conference in preparation for Tuesday’s Eurogroup with Finance Minister Christos Staikouras, Deputy Minister to the prime minister responsible for the coordination of the government’s work Akis Skertsos, Deputy Minister to the prime minsiter and government spokesperson Stelios Petsas, the director of the prime minister’s Economic Bureau Alexis Patelis, the head of Council of Economic Experts and Greece’s representative to the EuroWorking Group, Mihalis Argyros, and the head of prime minister’s diplomatic bureau, Eleni Sourani.</p>
<p>According to government sources, Greece intends to continue pushing for an EU-issued ‘corona-bond’ at Tuesday’s virtual Eurogroup, in line with a request made at the EU summit by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and other European leaders, as an expression of solidarity with the countries that have been most stricken by the coronavirus crisis and in support of the common European vision.</p>
<p>The same sources said that it is a form of “support capable of persuading European citizens and the markets that Europe has the will and the means to do whatever is takes to deal with the repercussions of the coronavirus on the economies of its member-states.”</p>
<p>Greece will also support the European Commission’s proposal for a programme to support labour, the workforce and the unemployed, as well as a proposal for the support of enterprises via the European Investment Bank.</p>
<p>Regarding the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), Greece will go to meeting with the firm position that a solution must be common and able to meet the demands of the present conjuncture, the sources said. Greece had repeatedly expressed the position, they added, that “in this crisis, the EU must demonstrate decisiveness and solidarity”.</p>
<p>PM Mitsotakis chairs video conference on new town planning bill</p>
<p>Earlier today, a video conference chaired by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis was held on Tuesday at the Maximos Mansion, regarding the new town planning bill that will be presented to the Cabinet in April. The meeting formed part of the effort to prepare the transition to the post-pandemic phase.</p>
<p>According to government sources, the draft bill is a major legislative measure that will strive resolve long-standing issues and aims at the creation of a stable, simple and uniform framework of rules for the entire country, which offers transparency and legal security to investors and citizens.</p>
<p>Participating in the meeting were Environment and Energy Minister Kostis Hatzidakis, State Minister Giorgos Gerapetritis, Deputy Environment and Energy Minister Dimitris Economou, Deputy Minister to the prime minister responsible for the coordination of the government’s work Akis Skertsos, the prime minister’s general secretary Grigoris Dimitriadis, the general secretary for town planning Efthymios Bakoyiannis and the general secretary for the coordination of economic and development issues Vicky Loizou.
