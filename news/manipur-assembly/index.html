<p>Imphal: The BJP-led government in Manipur is heading towards a crisis with nine ruling coalition members, including four ministers, resigning on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Those who quit included Deputy Chief Minister Y JoyKumar Singh. The other three ministers who tendered their resignation are Tribal and Hills Area Development Minister N Kayishii, Youth Affairs and Sports Minister Letpao Haokip and Health and Family Welfare Minister L Jayanta Kumar Singh.</p>
<p>The rest who resigned are three MLAs from BJP, one from All India Trinamool Congress (AITC) and one Independent.</p>

<p>Subhaschandra, who is among the three BJP MLAs who quit Wednesday, has tendered his resignation from membership of the Manipur Legislative Assembly.</p>
<p>The seven Congress MLAs, who had earlier crossed over to the BJP, are facing anti-defection cases under the Tenth Schedule of Indian Constitution in the Speaker&rsquo;s Tribunal as well as in the High Court of Manipur.</p>
<p>One Congress MLA who joined the BJP-led government was disqualified from the membership of Manipur Legislative Assembly recently reducing the strength of the house to 59. Assembly election in Manipur was held in 2017.</p>
<p>Now, 18 BJP members are with Biren Singh supported by 4 MLAs of Naga People&rsquo;s Front (NPF) and one MLA from LJP. Their total strength has come down to 23 MLAs.</p>
<p>Manipur will see election for one Rajya Sabha seat on June 19. Both, the BJP and the Congress, have fielded candidates for the lone seat of the upper house.</p>
<p>BJP has fielded Leisemba Sanajaoba, the titualar king of Manipur, while the Congress nominee is T Mangi Babu.

<p>Express News Service</p>
<p>GUWAHATI: Dealing a major blow to ruling BJP, the Manipur High Court on Monday passed an order directing Speaker Yumnam Khemchand to “restrain” the entry of seven Congress MLAs, who had “defected” to the saffron party, into the Assembly until further order.</p>
<p>After hearing disqualification petitions filed against them, the one-judge Bench of Justice K Nobin Singh of the High Court ordered: “…With the direction that unless and until the petitions are decided and disposed of finally by the Hon’ble Speaker, Manipur Legislative Assembly, the private respondents namely Shri Sanasam Bira Singh, MLA; Shri Ginsuanhau, MLA; Shri Oinam Lukhoi Singh, MLA; Shri Ngamthang Haokip, MLA; Shri Yengkhom Surchandra Singh, MLA; Shri Kshetrimayum Bira Singh, MLA and Shri Paonam Brojen Singh, MLA, are restrained from entering the Manipur Legislative Assembly, Imphal. The Hon’ble Speaker, Manipur Legislative Assembly, is directed to ensure compliance of this order by all concerned,” the one-judge Bench of Justice K Nobin Singh of the High Court ordered.</p>
<p>Senior advocate and Congress leader Kapil Sibal had led the team of advocates representing petitioners from the Congress.</p>
<p>The court said the Speaker had failed to decide the petitions filed by the petitioners from Congress party within a reasonable time. It said despite the petitions being filed on November 8, 2018, the Speaker had not disposed them of till date.</p>
<p>“In Shri K. Meghachandra Singh (supra), the Hon’ble Supreme Court, while partly allowing the Civil Appeals arising out of SLP (C) No.18659 of 2019 vide its judgment and order dated 21-01-2020, directed the Hon’ble Speaker to decide the petitions within four weeks from the date on which it was intimated to him. Since the Hon’ble Speaker failed to decide the same within the time as directed, the Hon’ble Supreme Court passed an order dated 18-03-2020 directing that Shri Th. Shyamkumar Singh be restrained from entering the Manipur Legislative Assembly until further order,” the court said.</p>
<p>After hearing a similar disqualification petition in March this year filed by Congress MLA Meghachandra, the Supreme Court stripped Manipur Minister Thounaojam Shyamkumar of his office and banned his entry into the Assembly. Later, the Speaker had disqualified him as a member of the Assembly.</p>
<p>Shyamkumar was elected in the 2017 elections on a Congress ticket. However, he had switched to the BJP even before being sworn in as a Member of the Assembly. The BJP had rewarded him with a berth in the Cabinet.</p>
<p>The Manipur HC said, “…The Hon’ble Supreme Court has also observed that what is reasonable will depend on the facts of each case but absent exceptional circumstances for which there is good reason, a period of three months from the date on which the petition is filed, is the outer limit within which the petition must be decided by the Speaker”.</p>
<p>The Congress is elated. “I welcome the verdict of Hon&rsquo;ble High Court of Manipur. The Keisham Meghachandra judgment of the Supreme Court has given the path to justice today. I am sure that Congress will win the Rajya Sabha election from Manipur on June 19. I look forward to seeing a new Congress-led coalition government in Manipur soon. Day by day, the ruling coalition is being weakened numerically and politically in Manipur. I thank our senior counsels Kapil Sibal, SG Hasnain, and N Ibotombi,” Congress spokesman Ningombam Bupenda Meitei told this newspaper.</p>
<p>Following the court’s order, the seven MLAs will not be able to take part in voting during election to the state’s lone Rajya Sabha seat.

<h3 id="manipur-nagaland-join-anti-delimitation-chorus">&ldquo;Manipur, Nagaland join anti-delimitation chorus&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg" alt="img">
Various organisations and political parties in Manipur and Nagaland have joined their counterparts in Assam to oppose the notified exercise for the delimitation of electoral constituencies in some north-eastern states.</p>
<p>The Communist Party of India (CPI) and CPI (Marxist) filed a contempt petition at the High Court of Manipur against the Ministry of Home Affairs, Director of Census Operations and the Delimitation Commissioner of India for “wilfully, deliberately and intentionally disobeying” a 2007 judgement of the Gauhati High Court against the method applied for the exercise.</p>
<p>Manipur used to be covered by the Gauhati HC until the HC of Manipur was established in March 2013.</p>
<p>5-point resolution</p>
<p>Representatives of 16 political parties in Manipur, including the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, met in State capital Imphal on June 16 to unanimously oppose the delimitation exercise. They adopted a five-point resolution to fight delimitation politically and legally.</p>
<p>The Centre had on February 28 issued the notification for delimitation on the basis of the 2001 census. The exercise following a similar notification in February 2008 was deferred because of concerns over the law and order scenario in the northeast.</p>
<p>While political parties and NGOs in Manipur claim that the 2001 census was faulty, those in adjoining Nagaland want the 23-year-old “Naga political issue” to be settled first before delimitation is undertaken.</p>
<p>The issue pertains to the peace talks with the National Socialist Council of Nagalim, also known as the Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland, that is awaiting a “honourable solution” since mid-1997. Seven other factions joined the peace process later on.</p>
<p>The apex bodies of 11 tribes in Nagaland wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on June 16, asserting that solving the protracted Naga political issue was more important than delimitation. “The exercise now would be futile as there will be delimitation again after the finalisation of the peace process,” the tribal organisations said.</p>
<p>Joint statement</p>
<p>But a few groups in Nagaland have resolved to support the “long-felt need” for delimitation. They included organisations of the Zeme, Liangmai, Rongmei and Kuki communities in the State’s Peren district.</p>
<p>“Our stand does not mean the people of Peren are against the Naga solution. While the talks are in process, the flow of justice and equal representation of people&hellip; should be allowed to take place,” the organisations said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>In Assam, the Congress, All India United Democratic Front and other political parties as well as social NGOs have been opposing the delimitation move. Their contention is that the exercise is untimely because of the pending updation of the National Register of Citizens and the anxiety caused by the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.</p>
<p>‘Interest of indigenous’</p>
<p>The BJP-led Assam government wants the redrawing of the Assembly constituencies in the “interest of the indigenous people of the State and unless it is carried out, they would remain vulnerable”. Assam has 126 Assembly seats, at least 35 of which are dominated by Bengal-origin Muslims, many of whom are seen as people of doubtful citizenship.</p>
<p>“The delimitation exercise should be carried so that 110 seats are for the indigenous people. There should be not any addition to the existing number of constituencies, but the focus of delimitation should be on the protection of the political rights of the native people of Assam,” Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had said after the notification.

<h3 id="14-major-manipur-parties-to-chalk-out-strategy-against-centres-plan-for-delimitation">&ldquo;14 major Manipur parties to chalk out strategy against Centre’s plan for delimitation&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/b4k0pm/article24273052.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THMANIPURCM" alt="img">
Representatives of 14 major political parties in Manipur will on June 17 chalk out a joint strategy against the Union government’s plan to carry out delimitation of the Parliamentary and Assembly constituencies on the basis of the “incorrect” and “highly objectionable” 2001 Census report.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, representatives of other parties that had formed the Manipur Democratic Alliance will send memoranda to the President, Prime Minister, Governor and others pleading against the delimitation.</p>
<p>President of the Manipur unit of Shiv Sena and convener of the MDA M. Tombi said, “We have no objection if the number of seats are increased in the hills. But there will be untoward incidents if the number of Assembly seats is decreased in the valley areas.</p>
<p>Congress MLA A. Mirabai said, “If the political map of the State is changed based on the 2001 Census, there will be unforeseen bloody ferments. Reports are that two seats each in the Imphal West and the Bishnupur Assembly constituencies will be lost. The delimitation should be done based on the 2021 Census”.</p>
<p>M. Okendra, president of the Manipur unit, Congress, said: “There were abnormal rises in the populations in nine sub-divisions in the hills”. However, no such trend was seen in the valley areas.</p>
<p>Three-time Chief Minister and now CLP leader Okram Ibobi said, “During the Congress tenure, we had opposed the plan to conduct delimitation basing on the 2001 Census report. Ten political parties here had gone to the Gauhati High Court. The court had admitted the petition. The Union government went to the Supreme Court and had issued a stay order against the High Court ruling. Eventually, the Union government had issued an order saying that the delimitation was postponed.</p>
<p>All political parties are in full agreement that the 2001 Census report has an abnormal rise. The rise was from 41 to 169%. However, such a rise was not seen in other constituencies in the State.</p>
<p>L. Sotinkumar, the State secretary of the CPI, said, “The CPI has been demanding that the State government should object to the Union government’s plan to hold the Census based on the 2001 count”.

<h3 id="manipur-speaker-dismisses-objection-pleas-of-seven-mlas">&ldquo;Manipur Speaker dismisses objection pleas of seven MLAs&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://nenow.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/manipur_assembly11.jpg" alt="img">
Manipur Assembly Speaker Yumnam Khemchand Singh on Saturday dismissed the objection pleas of seven MLAs.</p>
<p>The speaker fixed June 17 next for further proceedings of the case and fixed June 12 next for the respondents to file comments.</p>
<p>The disqualification of the seven MLAs was sought on the ground that they had switched sides to the BJP even though they had been elected as Congress candidates in the Assembly elections of 2017.</p>
<p>The seven MLAs had filed an objection report on the ground of maintainability of the disqualification case filed against them before the Speaker Tribunal by some Congress MLAs and private parties under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution.</p>
<p>The respondent MLAs had prayed either for rejecting the disqualification petitions as not maintainable since the petitions have not been filed in terms of the provisions of the Members of Manipur Legislative Assembly (disqualification on ground of defection) rules, 1986 or to pass an order as deemed fit in accordance with law.</p>
<p>During the hearing of the case H S Paonam, senior advocate, appearing for the respondents submitted that the disqualification of a member of the Legislative Assembly under the Tenth Schedule is a serious matter.</p>
<p>Hence, the petitions presented before the Tribunal seeking disqualification must strictly comply with the provisions of the Members of Manipur Legislative Assembly (disqualification on ground of defection) Rules, 1986, otherwise the same are liable to be rejected as not maintainable.</p>
<p>The lawyer further stressed the relevant provisions of the Members of Manipur Legislative Assembly (disqualification on ground of defection) Rules, 1986, as contained in Rule 6(5), 6(6) and Rule 7(1), 7(2) and 7(3) and also to the provisions contained under Order VI, Rule 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p>The respondent counsel further contended that the provisions under Rule 6 and Rule 7 of the Members of Manipur Legislative Assembly (Disqualification on Ground of Defection) Rules, 1986 are mandatory and their non-compliance renders the petitions untenable.</p>
<p>As the petitioners rest their case solely on newspaper clippings, undated, uncertified and manufactured letters without source and its authenticity, the same are liable to be dismissed, contended the lawyer further.</p>
<p>Heaving heard counsels of both parties at length the Speaker Tribunal had reserved its order on May 8 with a direction to the petitioners and the respondents to submit written arguments on or before May 16.</p>
<p>Subsequently the written arguments of both the petitioners and respondents were filed on May 16 last.</p>
<p>On perusing the preliminary objections filed by the respondent MLAs, the Speaker Tribunal dismissed the same and asked the respondents to file written replies by June 12 adding that the case will proceed as fixed.</p>
<p>The Speaker Tribunal also held that the petitioners can also file rejoinder to any to the written comment on or before June 16 and posted the matter on June 17 for further proceedings.</p>
<p>It may be mentioned that the seven MLAs – Oinam Lukhoi, Ksh Biren, Paonam Brojen, Sanasam Bira, Ngamthang Haokip, Ginsuanhau Zou and Yengkhom Surchandra – got elected from Congress ticket but defected to BJP after the 2017 Assembly election of Manipur.

10 MLAs had resigned from Congress and joined BJP in July last year. (File photo)</p>
<p>PANAJI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed Goa assembly speaker Rajesh Patnekar ' and 10 MLAs including deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavalekar, who joined BJP from Congress last year, to reply within four weeks to a petition filed against them.</p>
<p>Congress state president Girish Chodankar had approached the Supreme Court pointing out the nearly nine-month delay by the speaker in deciding the disqualification petitions filed against the MLAs.</p>
<p>Chodankar in his plea had cited an order in the Manipur assembly case passed by the Supreme Court in March and sought a direction to restrain the MLAs from attending the assembly proceedings during the pendency of the disqualification petition.</p>
<p>Chodnakar stated that in the Manipur case, the SC directed the MLA concerned not to enter the legislative assembly, and that he would cease to be a minister due to the speaker’s delay in deciding the disqualification petition.</p>
<p>Chodankar also cited another apex court judgment which provided that disqualification pleas should be decided within three months. He said that this time limit has been breached in Goa.</p>
<p>“Importantly, during the pendency of the said petition, the respondents (MLAs) continue to participate as members of the legislative assembly, despite having ex-facie incurred a disqualification under Schedule X of the Constitution of India,” he said, adding that some of the MLAs are ministers in the state government.</p>
<p>Besides Kavlekar, the disqualification petition, filed before the speaker on August 8 last year, pertains to deputy speaker Isidore Fernandes, ministers Jennifer Monserrate and Filipe Neri Rodrigues, and MLAs Nilkanth Halarnkar, Antonio Fernandes, Franscisco Silveira, Wilfred D’Sa, Clafasio Dias and Atanasio Monserrate.</p>
<p>All 10 had resigned from Congress and joined BJP in July, taking the saffron party’s strength in the 40-member House to 27.</p>
<p>This is one of two petitions pending before the Goa assembly speaker. The other is against two former MGP legislators—tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar and PWD minister Deepak Pauskar—who joined BJP in March last year.</p>
