Collingwood Magpies president Eddie McGuire has given an impassioned plea to members of his club to stand by them during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>With the AFL season suspended temporarily, many members are seeking refunds for their club memberships.</p>
<p>But the Magpies boss spoke to Nine News on Wednesday night about why fans should continue to support the club, and got extremely fired up during the interview.</p>
<p>MORE: SCG unable to refund members | Cousins roasted for interview</p>
<p>“It’s as simple as this – if you don’t have members, you don’t have a club,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A club that has no members is a memory, so we need them to stick with us as much as we can.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If our members or supports get into financial hardship, speak to us – we are there together because the members are the club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It’s not as if we are privately owned…this is all about sticking together through tough times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But unfortunately - or maybe fortunately for entertainment purposes - reporter Tony Jones kept prodding and it ended up being a pretty explosive segment.</p>
<p>“You’re not listening to me Tony, you’re trying to get a headline,&rdquo; McGuire continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I’m giving you an answer – the answer is if you’ve got financial hardship speak to your club, we are there to help you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do this year in, year out with people in financial hardship. This is more than just a transaction – this is people who love their club and it means more to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Should @AFL members be refunded?</p>
<p>Collingwood president Eddie McGuire and Tony Jones thrash it out. @TJch9 #9News pic.twitter.com/YgsJftga0H — Nine News Melbourne (@9NewsMelb) April 1, 2020</p>
<p>“Do you want an answer or do you want to keep asking questions? If we don’t have enough people putting their hands in their pockets, it’s as simple as that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don’t make this into people taking money out of people’s pockets, and don’t wind me up with a smartass last line. This is desperate stakes, and don’t try and make a headline.&rdquo;

North Melbourne star Shaun Higgins has backed up former club president James’s Brayshaw stinging attack on a relocation report from Caroline Wilson.</p>
<p>Plus Ross Lyon has hit back at Gold Coast Suns chairman Tony Cochrane.</p>
<p>Here’s what’s making news today.</p>

<p>HIGGINS BACKS BRAYSHAW TIRADE ON NORTH RELOCATION</p>
<p>North Melbourne midfielder Shaun Higgins has echoed the thoughts of former club president James Brayshaw, who delivered a scathing response to journalist Caroline Wilson’s report that key players at clubland and AFL House were of the belief the club should be re-located to Tasmania in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>Wilson, a Walkley award-winning columnist, relayed her views on Monday night, which Brayshaw labelled as “baseless garbage” on radio yesterday evening.</p>
<p>Higgins, a two-time club best-and-fairest, supported the view this afternoon.</p>
<p>“It’s disappointing at a time like this when there’s already so many challenges for the wider football community and the community in general that some negativity is raised and disappointing to be in the middle of that as a player at North Melbourne,” Higgins said on SEN’s Dwayne’s World.</p>
<p>“But at the same time, we’d echo the thoughts of James Brayshaw. For a football club that has been in profit 11 out of the last 12 years, in severe debt 9 years ago, and get us to a stage now that we’re near-on debt-free in a really strong position, you know, great revenue coming in… the club has done an amazing job over a 10-year period that we thought that noise like this would go away and unfortunately it’s not, and sometimes more of a reflection on where that’s coming from rather than who it’s spoken about.</p>
<p>“But great support over the last 24 hours from the North Melbourne army, past players, supporters and members and I think that shows how strong the club is and a club that’s going to stay put in Melbourne.”</p>
<p>AFL can get better post COVID 1:08</p>
<p>ROSS THE BOSS STRIKES BACK</p>
<p>One week after Suns chairman Tony Cochrane labelled him as a “failed coach” Ross Lyon has returned serve in the most remarkable of fashion.</p>
<p>Lyon earned a reputation for dishing out some pretty stinging one liners when he was at the helm of St Kilda and Fremantle and, apparently, he hasn’t lost any of that touch since leaving the coaching ranks.</p>
<p>Speaking on The Coach podcast, Lyon hit back at Cochrane, saying he not only had to do some research on the Gold Coast chairman to figure out who he was, but that he should look at his own backyard when assessing success and failure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know a lot about him, so I read up. He&rsquo;s got that brash Gold Coast thing about him, good for his club, certainly respect that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leigh Matthews talked about Gold Coast cannibalising Brisbane the previous year. He&rsquo;s got a few premierships under his belt, Leigh, (and) he was just a short-sighted coach (in Cochrane&rsquo;s eyes), so maybe if I had a premiership, I&rsquo;d just be short-sighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think where has got to be careful is the lens that was put on me is very binary. Failed is yes or no. Clearly, three Grand Finals, lots of footy, but ultimately no premierships, and that&rsquo;s OK, if that&rsquo;s your measure.</p>
<p>“But let&rsquo;s reflect that lens on to the Gold Coast.”</p>

<p>WHY WE MIGHT BE GOING BACK TO THE 90S</p>
<p>We haven’t seen an AFL game played for premiership points at Princes Park for a long time.</p>
<p>And we haven’t seen one played at Victoria Park or Whitten Oval for even longer.</p>
<p>But we could in the second half of this year.</p>
<p>Collingwood president Eddie McGuire says there is an opportunity for the AFL to host games at spiritual homes this season due to the chaos created by the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>The AFL is looking at every option to complete this season and one issue could be ground availability later in the year during cricket season.</p>
<p>“There is a real opportunity to do that,” McGuire said on Triple M on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“It could be something that comes up with the dramas with Marvel Stadium if it will be available with cricket. There are plenty of opportunities.”</p>
<p>One issue could be constructing LED signage around the fences for sponsors, but McGuire doesn’t think that will be a problem to resolve.</p>

<p>ROOS MOVE CLAIMS ARE ‘BLOODY DISAPPOINTING’</p>
<p>North Melbourne chairman Ben Buckley has dismissed claims by veteran AFL journalist Caroline Wilson that league powerbrokers have discussed relocating the club.</p>
<p>Wilson suggested on Footy Classified clubs and some AFL officials had said moving the Kangaroos to Tasmania makes sense, amid the financial crisis the league faces due to coronavirus.</p>
<p>While expansion into Tasmania has previously appeared likely in the near future, the financial hit caused by COVID-19 is likely to delay that for some time.</p>
<p>But Buckley told the Herald Sun there was “no basis” in the claims.</p>
<p>“It’s bloody disappointing,’’ he said.</p>
<p>“That’s rumour-mongering which is unnecessary, unwarranted and has no basis.</p>
<p>“You know my views very strongly, we’re a Melbourne-based team.</p>
<p>“Any speculation is complete nonsense, is not on the agenda, is not being discussed and won’t be discussed.’’</p>
<p>He called on Kangaroos fans to ignore the chatter around the club, which has been ever-present over the past couple of decades.</p>
<p>Foolish behaviour by Heeney? 0:36</p>
<p>“I have never had one president discuss it with me, I’ve never had one CEO discuss it with myself, it’s never been discussed with the AFL, it’s just speculation,’’ Buckley said.</p>
<p>“It really is inaccurate, it’s unhelpful, and I guess it’s a sign of the times that there’s too many other things to talk about rather than what’s going on the field.</p>
<p>“I would say to all supporters to ignore those discussions.’’</p>
<p>LLOYD THROWS UP ‘EPIC’ SEASON STRUCTURE</p>
<p>Essendon great Matthew Lloyd believes the 2020 season should be played over two years, with a premiership to be decided after 34 “epic” matches.</p>
<p>“I’d rather an epic 34-games, you give players a break over Christmas, play each other twice. So be it (different lists), have the draft at the right time. A 12-game or 15-game season, I can’t cop that,” he said on Channel 9’s Footy Classified.</p>

<p>THE AFL HAS SOMETHING THE NRL DOESN’T</p>
<p>The AFL’s $600 million line of credit will go a long way in keeping the league afloat, but its the league’s ownership of its own stadium that has truly separated it from the NRL.</p>
<p>The league acquired its own stadium in 2016, with chief executive Gillon McLachlan telling SEN’s Whateley Marvel Stadium was a key bargaining tool in securing the game saving bank loan from ANZ and NAB.</p>
<p>“We’re fortunate that we’ve got a strong balance sheet with a stadium and some cash,” he said.</p>
<p>The AFL secured Marvel Stadium ahead of its slated date of 2025, a shrewd move by the AFL Commission that was now paying dividends.</p>
<p>“Clearly we believed it was important for a whole series of strategic reasons at the time,” McLachlan said.</p>
<p>“I don’t think anyone contemplated it at the time, to have freehold title over that whole asset, and being debt free and unencumbered … the decision of the Commission to build and invest in that asset is bearing fruit at the moment.”</p>

<p>McLachlan also weighed into the debate surrounding the possible relocation of an AFL club to Tasmania – something which was put on the table by veteran journalist Caroline Wilson on Footy Classified on Monday.</p>
<p>“We’re going into this with 18 clubs and we’ll come out with 18 clubs,” he said.</p>
<p>“That’s our commitment over the next four, eight, six, 10 months … whatever it looks like.</p>
<p>“We will have the same structure at the elite level.”</p>
<p>GETTING SOCIAL: CLUB CEOS REACH OUT TO HELP STOOD DOWN STAFF</p>
<p>Tom Morris reports&hellip;</p>
<p>Club chief executives have used their personal social media accounts to encourage other companies to employ staff they stood down last week.</p>
<p>In another sign of unity between at least five CEOs, messages were posted on their LinkedIn accounts on Monday.</p>
<p>Each club stood down between 80-90 per cent of staff last week, leaving hundreds of men and women with no income and no career certainty.</p>
<p>Robbo the dog whisperer 1:52</p>
<p>Though these people – across football and administration - technically remain employees of their respective clubs as per the Fair Work Act, they have also been told they are free to explore other job opportunities.</p>
<p>And it appears Ameet Bains (Western Bulldogs), Matt Finnis (St Kilda), Justin Reeves (Hawthorn), Tom Harley (Sydney) and Brendon Gale (Richmond) are prepared to help them in a public fashion.</p>
<p>All five asked to be contacted directly if anyone within their LinkedIn networks were interested.</p>
<p>“If anyone needs the help of any short term or long term people and you want them to be amazing, reach out to me,” Reeves wrote.</p>
<p>“We have them ready to go. They will make your business better.”</p>
<p>Gale echoed a similar sentiment: “I’m extremely mindful that so many are hurting right now.</p>
<p>“If anyone within my LinkedIn network does have the capacity to take on great people on a short-term basis, please contact me directly.”</p>
<p>CLAIMS AFL OFFICIALS WANT A TEAM TO RELOCATE – AND ONE NAME KEEPS POPPING UP</p>
<p>The AFL is keen to keep an 18-team competition, despite the significant financial impacts the suspension of the season has had on the league’s bottom line.</p>
<p>While chief executive Gillon McLachlan secured a loan worth up to $600 million from NAB and ANZ on Monday, concerns remain regarding the complexion of the league when it resumes.</p>
<p>Former Fremantle and St Kilda coach Ross Lyon suggested removing the Gold Coast Suns from the competition could be a possible solution, but veteran journalist Caroline Wilson believes the AFL won’t indulge in that kind of move.</p>
<p>Another seismic shift, however, could be on the cards.</p>
<p>Wilson told Footy Classified club powerbrokers want a team from Victoria to relocate – and there’s one that continues to pop up in conversation.</p>
<p>Kingy&rsquo;s top 10 modern Roos 1:40</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every time I talk to a club, the team that keeps coming back is North Melbourne and the fact that they should have relocated to (the) Gold Coast some years ago,&rdquo; Wilson said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even within the AFL there&rsquo;s a view that Tasmania should not be off the table despite the fact that it seems like an indulgence at the moment, and that North Melbourne should go to Tasmania.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The job now is to keep everyone alive and that&rsquo;s going to be difficult when everything is on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just get the feeling when I talk to individual clubs, their bosses, their presidents, CEOs, and the AFL, that nothing is sacred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t sit here tonight and say despite the AFL&rsquo;s assurances that 18 teams and the way they look now are assured to go into 2021.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Derm analyses former NFL star 1:30</p>
<p>Wilson said despite the Suns and Giants being the most recent additions to the AFL, the league was keen to keep two of their northern state teams.</p>
<p>And while the Tasmanian bid has revolved around creating its own team from scratch, Wilson suggested relocating a pre-existing club to the Apple Isle would be more financially sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several other clubs are saying North Melbourne to Tasmania is the obvious solution,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to keep 18 clubs and 10 clubs in Victoria is just not sustainable at a time where everything has been thrown back on the table. I think now the rules have changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe football will only benefit from being resurrected in Tasmania in terms of its own team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The problem is Tasmanians didn&rsquo;t want North Melbourne. Had the AFL refused to give them a provisional license, they would have asked to keep Hawthorn games and get rid of North Melbourne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;North Melbourne don&rsquo;t want to go to Tasmania, but you could almost justify the cost situation if you could relocate the club there and not establish the club from scratch.&rdquo;
