<p>LONDON (Reuters) - Global accounting and consulting firms Deloitte and EY said on Wednesday they were cutting pay for partners at their UK businesses by a fifth to protect jobs during the coronavirus crisis, mirroring moves at rivals PwC and BDO.</p>
<p>Professional services in the City of London have hit a near standstill since the pandemic shook global markets and caused activities like mergers and acquisitions and stock market listings to dry up.</p>
<p>Richard Houston, chief executive of Deloitte UK, said the highest earners must bear most of the financial burden, and they must build the resilience of the firm for the long term.</p>
<p>Houston said there would be no annual salary increases, with bonuses reduced and deferred until later in the year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As part of this package of actions, partner annual earnings are expected to decline by around 20% and we have deferred profit distributions,&rdquo; Houston said in a blog, adding that the moves were the right thing to do to &ldquo;protect jobs and our business for the foreseeable future&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Deloitte UK is also offering the option of reduced working hours, while maintaining a higher proportion of their salary.</p>
<p>Deloitte is one of the world&rsquo;s &ldquo;Big Four&rdquo; accounting firms that check the books of most blue chip companies, the other three being EY, KPMG and PwC.</p>
<p>EY said it would reduce partner profit distributions in Britain by 20% to provide additional flexibility and financial resilience during the pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These steps are designed to help secure the long-term success of EY,&rdquo; the company said.</p>
<p>EY said there has been no redundancies among its 17,000 UK employees, no people furloughed, and no reduction in employee salaries.</p>
<p>&lsquo;FRANK CONVERSATIONS&rsquo;</p>
<p>KPMG in Britain said it had had &ldquo;frank conversations&rdquo; with its partners over what action it might need to take as the pandemic progresses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our partners are prepared for any of the measures we may need to enact in order to do that,&rdquo; KPMG said.</p>
<p>PwC&rsquo;s UK Chairman Kevin Ellis has said partner salaries will be cut by 20% during the pandemic to protect jobs, although there are no plans so far to furlough staff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to reassure you that we will use the power of our partnership to do all we can to to protect your jobs and salary security, which means asking the partners to accept the financial impact of this,&rdquo; Ellis said in a message to staff.</p>
<p>Annual discussions on rewards and promotions have been pushed back from the summer to the autumn, PwC said.</p>
<p>Among the next tier of accounting firms, BDO said its partners had decided to cut their pay by up to 25%, while Grant Thornton has offered all staff the opportunity to volunteer for a temporary cut in hours or a short-term sabbatical.</p>

<h3 id="4-reasons-to-join-defense-justice--security-at-deloitte">4 Reasons to Join Defense, Justice &amp; Security at Deloitte</h3>
<p><img src="https://4d0q7u11k31p1qnkosal8q2e-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ClearanceJobs-Article-Image-Deloitte-Fingerprint.jpg" alt="img">
Are you looking for a new opportunity in defense, security, and justice?</p>
<p>Deloitte offers consulting and advisory services to clients across all branches of the military and agencies of the Department of Defense, the intelligence community, as well as the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice. From Cyber, Audit readiness, Cloud, and Technology, Deloitte has opportunities for all skillsets and levels including data analysts, project managers, human resources experts, developers, accountants, and more.</p>
<p>Deloitte is an excellent employer for a few reasons.</p>
<p>ENDLESS LEARNING &amp; DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES</p>
<p>Deloitte offers countless opportunities to develop your career, including leading-edge training programs, and mentoring.</p>
<p>The most tangible evidence of their commitment to learning and development is Deloitte University, a 107-acre campus built specifically for leadership and professional development.</p>
<p>“Deloitte has a fantastic suite of learning programs managed through the various lines of business that are tailored to the skillsets each practitioner should focus on,” says Ethan, a manager at Deloitte Consulting LLP. “In my case, the Systems Engineering Offering has a dedicated team devoted to identifying and coordinating technology certification programs that enhance my ability to deliver the right kinds of capabilities to my clients. In just the last year, the firm has supported my achievement of Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Cybersecurity, and Cloud Architecture certifications from leading entities in each respective market.”</p>
<p>DEDICATED RESOURCE MANAGERS</p>
<p>Resource managers offer one-on-one onboarding support, career coaching and staffing opportunities tailored to your skillset and/or interests. Lina, a senior analyst at Deloitte Consulting LLP says, “My resource manager was essential to my initial success at Deloitte. Though a lot of project opportunities are found by networking, you can depend on your resource manager to have your back with plenty of open project opportunities tailored directly to your skills. My resource manager is available to talk with me 1:1 about project searching more broadly, and provides much needed advice for selecting projects I find on my own.”</p>
<p>Having both official (resource managers) and unofficial (networking) career coaches is a valuable resource available and allows you to not only discover your career goals, but also achieve them.</p>
<p>VARIETY OF CAREER OPPORTUNITIES AND PATHS</p>
<p>At Deloitte, you’re exposed to a wide range of opportunities and often work on diverse teams that include people from several other disciplines. In many cases, Deloitte professionals are able to identify projects of interest through networking and can often be staffed on those projects. These opportunities for crossover and mobility are key to helping Deloitte professionals find the industry and work they personally find most rewarding and interesting.</p>
<p>Ethan explains that “More and more, we’re seeing our society embrace different models of work-life balance. Deloitte is leading the charge in creating a workplace where we don’t constrain ourselves to a one-size-fits-all career trajectory. By having different options available, there’s a career path that anyone can follow and bring their best self to work each and every day. Knowing that I have the option to change my path when I feel the time is right provides a fantastic sense of security.”</p>
<p>PEOPLE &amp; CULTURE</p>
<p>Deloitte fosters a collaborative, inclusive culture that inspires you to try new things, speak openly, and be bold. The diversity of people and perspectives at Deloitte cultivates a community where everyone can connect, belong, and grow.</p>
<p>If you want to deliver mission critical work and make an impact on our nation’s largest defense, security, and justice priorities, explore opportunities with Deloitte.</p>
