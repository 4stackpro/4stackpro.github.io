JOHANNESBURG, April 8, 2020 /PRNewswire/ &ndash; Shareholders are referred to Sasol&rsquo;s SENS announcement issued on 31 March 2020. In that announcement, Sasol stated it would continue to run its operations, in line with regulatory requirements applicable in the jurisdictions we operate in, to ensure uninterrupted supply of essential products such as fuels and chemicals in these jurisdictions. We reiterate that the COVID-19 pandemic is highly dynamic, and we will continue to update the market of any further impact on Sasol&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>A small number of Sasol employees have tested positive for COVID-19 and are receiving our full support. These were isolated cases and have not negatively impacted operations.</p>
<p>Sasol communicated a comprehensive response strategy on 17 March 2020 and substantial progress has been made with regards to its US$2 billion cash conservation programme. While the Company has made substantial progress, it will also implement additional self-help management actions to mitigate further negative impacts of COVID-19 across its portfolio.</p>
<p>UPDATE ON OPERATIONS</p>
<p>In South Africa, the national COVID-19 lockdown has resulted in an unprecedented decline in fuel demand since coming into effect on Friday, 27 March 2020. Sasol and its partner in Natref, Total South Africa, decided to suspend the production at Natref with effect from Thursday, 9 April 2020 until further notice.</p>
<p>Given the steep decline in fuels demand, a decision was also made by Sasol to reduce daily production rates at our Secunda Synfuels Operations (SSO) by approximately 25% to meet the current market demand, while maintaining optimal inventory levels. We will maintain these production rates until further notice, while carefully monitoring the supply and demand balance. A further reduction in production rates may be required depending on further developments in the fuels market. All Sasol&rsquo;s mines are continuing to operate notwithstanding the lower internal demand, resulting in the external coal purchases being significantly minimised, compared to what was previously planned for the remainder of this financial year.</p>
<p>Chemicals production will continue to be prioritised within the revised SSO operating parameters including this cutback scenario. Despite the suspension of production at the Natref refinery and lower production rates at SSO, the country&rsquo;s current demand for fuels and chemicals, including sanitisers, will be met. The Company will continue to monitor the chemicals demand as well as supply chain risks and will keep the market updated on developments.</p>
<p>Given these developments and the decline in demand, liquid fuels sales volumes are expected to be approximately 50 – 51 million barrels against the previously guided 57 – 58 million barrels for financial year 2020. Accordingly, Synfuels production volumes will be approximately 7,3 – 7,4 million tons against the previously guided range of 7,7 – 7,8 million tons. At this stage a similar reduction in Synfuels chemicals demand is not being experienced, and Sasol is prioritising supply of chemicals within South Africa as well as strong export demand.</p>
<p>More detail on production volumes and updated guidance will be provided in the Company&rsquo;s Q3 FY20 Business Performance Metrics report, to be released in April 2020.</p>
<p>RESPONSE STRATEGY PROGRESS</p>
<p>As referenced earlier, the Company has made significant progress on the US$2 billion business self-help measures for financial years 2020 and 2021, which form the basis of the response strategy to the COVID-19 pandemic and oil price volatility.</p>
<p>Given the continued negative impact of COVID-19 on market demand and global macro-economic indicators, Sasol&rsquo;s management team is in the process of proactively identifying further measures to provide an additional buffer against short term volatility.</p>
<p>Sasol has put in place governance structures to manage the situation appropriately and will take decisive action where necessary to respond to any further changes in markets. These additional measures will be communicated to the market once agreed with the various stakeholders.</p>
<p>Safeguarding the health and well-being of employees and providing essential products to customers and stakeholders remains the Company&rsquo;s priority.</p>

<h3 id="stock-alert-sasol-surges-54">Stock Alert: Sasol Surges 54%</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/2019-05/0902-Q19%20Total%20Markets%20photos%20and%20gif_CC8.jpg?1058759959" alt="img">
(RTTNews) - Shares of Sasol Limited (SSL) are gaining more than 54 percent in Tuesday&rsquo;s trading at $3.92 despite no stock-specific news. The stock has traded in a range of $1.25 to $34.03 in the past 52 weeks.</p>
<p>Sasol is an integrated chemical and energy company based in South Africa.</p>
<p>U.S. stocks are rising on Tuesday amid signs that the spread of the coronavirus is slowing in hot spots such as New York. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Monday that the number of new coronavirus deaths in the state has been &ldquo;effectively flat&rdquo; over the past two days. Crude oil futures are also rising, after falling the previous session.</p>
<p>In late March, Sasol said it fully supports the directives announced by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on 23 March 2020, to combat the spread of COVID-19 in South Africa, including a three-week country-wide lockdown from March 27, 2020 to April 17, 2020.</p>
<p>As Sasol&rsquo;s products and services are classified as essential goods and services in South Africa, the company said it plans to run its South Africa-based operations for the duration of the lockdown. The company will work with the Government to ensure business continuity and uninterrupted supply of fuels and chemicals in South Africa during this period.</p>
<p>However, the company noted that some plants will be required to reduce throughput, or potentially shutdown following lower product offtake by its customers due to the lockdown.</p>

<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png" alt="img">
NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / April 6, 2020 / Bronstein, Gewirtz &amp; Grossman, LLC notifies investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Sasol Limited (&ldquo;Sasol&rdquo; or the Company&rdquo;) (SSL) and certain of its officers, on behalf of shareholders who purchased Sasol securities between March 10, 2015 and January 13, 2020,inclusive (the &ldquo;Class Period&rdquo;). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm&rsquo;s site:www.bgandg.com/ssl.</p>
<p>This class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>
<p>The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Sasol had conducted insufficient due diligence into, and failed to account for multiple issues with, the LCCP, as well as the true cost of the project; (2) construction and operation of the LCCP was consequently plagued by control weaknesses, delays, rising costs, and technical issues; (3) these issues were exacerbated by Sasol&rsquo;s top-level management, who engaged in improper and unethical behavior with respect to financial reporting for the LCCP and the project&rsquo;s oversight; (4) all the foregoing was reasonably likely to render the LCCP significantly more expensive than disclosed and negatively impact the Company&rsquo;s financial results; and (5) as a result, the Company&rsquo;s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.</p>
<p>On June 6, 2016, Sasol reported &ldquo;that the expected total capital expenditure for the [LCCP] could increase up to US$11 billion, including site infrastructure and utility improvements&rdquo;; a slower rate of capital &ldquo;resulted in an extended project schedule and contributed to further project cost increases&rdquo;; &ldquo;[t]he expected returns for the project have reduced due to changes in long-term price assumptions and the higher capital estimates&rdquo;; and &ldquo;[t]he increase in the estimated LCCP capital cost and extended schedule will reduce the expected project returns by approximately the same amount as the Company&rsquo;s lower long-term price assumptions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following these disclosures, Sasol&rsquo;s American depositary receipt (&ldquo;ADR&rdquo;) price fell $3.53 per share, or 10.99%, to close at $28.60 per share on June 6, 2016.</p>
<p>On May 22, 2019, during pre-market hours, Sasol disclosed that &ldquo;the cost estimate for the LCCP has been revised to a range of $12,6 to $12,9 billion which includes a contingency of $300 million.&rdquo; Sasol cited a $530 million change in the project&rsquo;s cost forecast because of a &ldquo;[c]orrection for duplication of investment allowances of approximately $230 million&rdquo;; a &ldquo;[c]orrection for certain contracts and variation orders managed by Sasol, outside the primary engineering, procurement and construction contract, of approximately $180 million&rdquo;; and forecast improvements that were &ldquo;not expected to be realised and adjustments for potential insurance claims and procurement back-charges of approximately $120 million.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following these disclosures, Sasol&rsquo;s ADR price fell $4.50 per share, or 14.93%, to close at $25.64 per share on May 22, 2019.</p>
<p>Later, on August 16, 2019, during pre-market hours, Sasol issued a press release disclosing that it was delaying the announcement of its 2019 financial results because of &ldquo;possible LCCP control weaknesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this news, Sasol&rsquo;s ADR price fell $0.74 per share, or 4.02%, to close at $17.67 per share on August 16, 2019.</p>
<p>Then, on October 28, 2019, Sasol disclosed that its review of the LCCP control weaknesses had brought to light &ldquo;errors, omissions, and inaccuracies in the [LCCP] cost estimate,&rdquo; and a number of unethical and improper reporting activities that took place at the highest level of management. Sasol also announced the resignation of, inter alia, its Joint Presidents and Chief Executive Officers (&ldquo;CEOs&rdquo;), effective November 1, 2019, and Senior Vice Presidents and others previously in charge of the LCCP.</p>
<p>Finally, on January 14, 2020, Sasol issued a press release confirming that on January 13, 2020, the Company &ldquo;experienced an explosion and fire at its LCCP low-density polyethylene (LDPE) unit.&rdquo; Sasol stated that &ldquo;[t]he unit was in the final stages of commissioning and startup when the incident occurred&rdquo; and &ldquo;has been shut down and an investigation is underway to determine the cause of the incident, the extent of the damage and resulting impact on the LDPE unit&rsquo;s [beneficial operation] schedule.&rdquo;</p>
