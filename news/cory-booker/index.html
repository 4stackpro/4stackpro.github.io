<p>Often. Often. I mean, look, I’m still very conscious when I’m not dressed like a senator, and even when I am, that I still could be one misunderstanding away from a very bad incident. But I also realize that I’m in a position of power to do something about these issues.</p>
<p>And, you know, my Newark experiences have profoundly shaped my perspective on these issues. We came in as reformers, and we really believed in good faith, with a majority black City Council and black mayor, that we were doing a real good job when it came to changing our police practices.</p>
<p>But we were confronted by a Department of Justice investigation. And it dredged up the data that we were not moving fast enough. And it is a testimony to these issues — they can’t be gotten rid of with good intentions. So, this has been a life’s work for me from the time I was in college writing about policing issues to the time I was a reformer as a mayor to the time I’ve been a United States senator.</p>
<p>And I almost feel, and it’s not the best word, but I almost feel a sense of shame that here I am, 30 years of adulthood since Rodney King, and the lessons that I got in my teenage years from African-American adults who wanted to make me afraid of police for my own safety, who wanted to teach me coping mechanisms, I feel just a sense of profound regret that I’m having to have those conversations with young black men in my life, my mentees or my nephews. And that is really hurtful to me that we’ve had three decades since that horrific beating of a black man who was so demonized, so stripped of his humanity, like so many black Americans have been in policing practices.</p>
<p>The history of policing in this country, and its treatment of African-Americans, is thoroughly documented for every generation of being so far short of the highest ideals of this country. It’s been an affront to the very dignity of the nation as a whole. You can’t be comfortable with this. And it’s our comfort with it that has allowed it to fester.</p>
<p>On the campaign trail you told people to come see your city of Newark. Its peaceful protests have made national news. Why do you think the city has responded this way?</p>
<p>Protest traditions in Newark are in our genes. We elevate our protesters to elected office. I’m proud of [Mayor] Ras Baraka. His father was Amiri Baraka. His father was beaten by police on the streets of Newark during the dark periods of the [1967] riots. He’s a leader that people trust, people know.

“This is very personal to me because of my own life experiences, and that of so many people that I know,” Booker said in an interview. “It’s personal to me because I owe a debt. My even moving into New Jersey was marked by violence, and so I owe a debt, and I’m going to do everything I can. And it’s not just to the struggles of African Americans, it’s to all those people who have been struggling to make this country live up to its promise.”

<h3 id="bernie-sanders-and-cory-booker-on-what-legal-marijuana-would-mean-for-people-of-color">&ldquo;Bernie Sanders And Cory Booker On What Legal Marijuana Would Mean For People Of Color&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.benzinga.com/files/imagecache/og_image_social_share_1200x630/images/story/2012/bernie-sanders-cory-booker-discuss-marijuana-legalization-in-the-us.jpg" alt="img">
By The Fresh Toast&rsquo;s Brendan Bures, provided exclusively to Benzinga Cannabis.</p>
<p>The senators analyzed how cannabis criminalization drives deep wedges into society with long-term, damaging consequences.</p>
<p>Sens. Cory Booker and Bernie Sanders held a virtual town hall meeting last week to discuss criminal justice reform, which included a lengthy dialogue about the role cannabis enforcement plays in social inequities. Booker said he and Sanders discuss “marijuana justice all the time” and how the War on Drugs influences systems of oppression.</p>
<p>“I’m all for [marijuana] legalization,” Booker said. “I came to the Senate speaking about legalization. But to say that in the same breath and not to include expunging records, reinvesting profits into communities that have been economically devastated by the drug war; you’re not talking about justice if you suddenly say, ‘Okay, everybody started in the same field. Go ahead.’”</p>
<p>At campaign rallies, Sanders stated he would often ask attendees to raise their hand if they or a known acquaintance had been arrested for cannabis possession.</p>
<p>“I was astounded by the hands that went up,” he said. “Then if you get a criminal record […] you’re looking for a job and the boss says, ‘Have you ever been arrested?’ ‘Well, yeah, I have been.’ ‘Okay, well, thank you. We’ll interview somebody else.’”</p>

<p>Booker and Sanders have established themselves as two of the loudest voices fighting for marijuana legalization at the federal level. Sanders promised immediately removing cannabis as a banned substance if he was elected President. Booker, meanwhile, introduced a bill that would legalize cannabis at the national level with support from Sanders and other 2020 presidential candidates like Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>Since dropping out of the presidential race in January, Booker has continued driving dialogue about marijuana reform. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, he questioned why some state lawmakers had labeled cannabis an “essential good,” but the substance remained federally illegal. He also underlined how marijuana enforcement represented the racist inequities spurring protests following the death of George Floyd while in the custody of Minneapolis police.</p>
<p>He echoed those sentiments in conversation with Sanders, when a viewer asked: “What would legalizing marijuana, expunging the records of those arrested for marijuana, mean for people of color?”</p>

<p>“In 2017, the last year we have data for, there were more marijuana possession arrests than all violent crime arrests in America combined,” Booker said. “And again, they’re arresting people of color. They’re not arresting folks of greater privilege.”</p>
<p>As Booker referenced, that data also showed black Americans were more than four times as likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white Americans. The groups, however, consumer marijuana at similar rates.</p>
<p>“Now you get a nonviolent drug charge for doing something that two of the three last presidents admitted to doing,” the senator said. “Now you have 40,000 collateral consequences that strip you from your economic power. You can’t get Pell grants, can’t get public housing, can’t get jobs, can’t get loans from the bank.”</p>

<h3 id="booker-says-the-sense-of-whats-possible-has-shifted-on-police-reform">&ldquo;Booker says the &lsquo;sense of what&rsquo;s possible has shifted&rsquo; on police reform&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/06/14/42f46806-3615-4a95-8a6a-e90cca2a543c/thumbnail/1200x630/14feb139f95e0665ec9af1dde2685828/screen-shot-2020-06-14-at-10-46-18-am.png" alt="img">
Washington — New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, a Democrat, said Sunday that the range of policing reforms under consideration from the federal to the local levels &ldquo;has shifted&rdquo; as tens of thousands of Americans have called for an end to police brutality and increased accountability for law enforcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are in a nation right now where the sense of what&rsquo;s possible has shifted,&rdquo; Booker said on &ldquo;Face the Nation.&rdquo; &ldquo;The bill that I just did with incredible partners like Kamala Harris and House members, that would have been poison pills just a month ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Booker joined House and Senate Democrats last week for the unveiling of a legislative package that implements reforms to policing. The measure was rolled out amid nationwide demonstrations following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in late May. In addition to the Democratic-led package, Republican Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina is spearheading a separate proposal for the GOP-led Senate.</p>
<p>Earlier on &ldquo;Face the Nation,&rdquo; Scott cautioned against including measures in a police reform package that are opposed by either Republicans or Democrats, as doing so could effectively tank the measure and damage efforts to address racial injustice. For Republicans, a so-called &ldquo;poison pill&rdquo; would be limiting qualified immunity for police officers, Scott said.</p>
<p>But Booker criticized aspects of the Republicans&rsquo; plan for police reforms and said lawmakers should seize the momentum of calls for widespread change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I want progress? Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But when we stop short and start talking about finding a bill that&rsquo;s the lowest common denominator, it is meaning that we will revisit this again when another unarmed black person gets killed and the nation erupts. We should be seeking to solve the problem, pushing the bounds of the possible and getting as big of a coalition as we possibly can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the White House has said that restricting qualified immunity for police would be a nonstarter, Booker noted that some Republicans are supportive of doing so, as is Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who has suggested the high court should revisit the legal doctrine it created decades ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When there&rsquo;s so many conservative voices talking about qualified immunity and when we know that no one in America should be above the law, I think it&rsquo;s time that we change qualified immunity,&rdquo; Booker said.</p>
<p>He urged lawmakers to shirk &ldquo;watered down reforms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a time to stop the problem, because if someone&rsquo;s knee is on your neck, you can&rsquo;t take it halfway off and say that that&rsquo;s progress,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We have the tools with which to stop people from dying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proposal put forth by House Democrats would make it easier to prosecute police officers for misconduct, incentivize state attorneys general to conduct investigations of local police departments and improve transparency on use of force. The measure also bars no-knock warrants in drug cases and police chokeholds, and mandates racial training for police officers.

<p><img src="https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/conan-obrien-korea.jpg?w=1000" alt="img">
Senator Cory Booker got visibly emotional during a frank interview with Conan O’Brien that is slated to air on the late-night host’s Wednesday evening program on TBS.</p>
<p>During the conversation, O’Brien notes that he has deliberately avoided bringing up President Trump as a topic during the show for several episodes, but told the Democratic Senator from New Jersey he can’t help but discuss him because he “has a chronic inability to demonstrate empathy” at a tough moment for the nation. O’Brien has for several days focused on reaction to recent protests nationwide over the death of George Floyd while in the custody of Minneapolis police.</p>
<p>“You can’t lead the people if you don’t love the people, and he just does not love all Americans,” said Senator Booker, who was a Democratic candidate for president before ending his campaign in January, noting that Trump’s inability to show empathy means “he is illegitimate in the kind of moral leadership that we need.”</p>
<p>“I have so much hurt for what he has done to people,” said Booker, who tells O’Brien he has been approached by people who are immigrants asking him to do something to keep the president from disparaging people of various races and nationalities.</p>
<p>O’Brien has allocated many of his recent programs to discussions about the nation’s response to the Floyd killing. On Monday, for example, he interviewed Melvin Carter, mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota. Last week, for example, he talked to actor Sam Richardson, known for his roles in “Veep” and “Detroiters.”</p>
<p>“Conan” airs on TBS at 11 p.m. eastern.

<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200113102616-02-cory-booker-file-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) Sen. Cory Booker said Wednesday that he&rsquo;s &ldquo;concerned&rdquo; President Donald Trump might refuse to concede if he loses the 2020 presidential race and declared that he&rsquo;d &ldquo;sooner die&rdquo; than let that happen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would sooner die. And I mean that very seriously, I would sooner die than to see my nation&rsquo;s constitutional tradition of peaceful transfers of power to be vacated by a demagogue who won&rsquo;t humble himself,&rdquo; the New Jersey Democrat, a former 2020 presidential candidate, said during an interview on SiriusXM&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Clay Cane Show .&rdquo;</p>
<p>His comments come as the President continues to push unfounded claims about voter fraud ahead of November&rsquo;s general election. Before his win in 2016, Trump had said he would accept the election results &ldquo;if I win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This President has already shown his willingness to trample constitutional norms,&rdquo; Booker said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The result comes amid rising coronavirus deaths in the US and condemnation from some fellow Republicans about Trump&rsquo;s response to protests outside the White House.</p>
<p>Following a speech in the White House Rose Garden last week, the President walked to St. John&rsquo;s Episcopal Church &ndash; a house of worship used by American presidents for more than a century &ndash; just after peaceful protesters outside the White House gates had been dispersed with tear gas, flash grenades and rubber bullets, and was photographed holding up a Bible.</p>
<p>Recounting the episode Wednesday, Booker said the US &ldquo;is a place of great tradition and he turned upon those traditions and used force, tear gas, rubber bullets to clear peaceful protesters to do what? Because he had to get to some national emergency? To do what? Because he had somehow to meet the demands of his job? No, he did that for a photo op.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Attorney General William Barr has defended the actions taken to clear the protesters, saying at a news conference last week that difficulties with relocating authorities had forced the clash. Barr maintained that his decision to disperse the crowd had followed signs that the protesters were &ldquo;becoming increasingly unruly&rdquo; and had nothing to do with the photo op at the church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so am I concerned? Yeah,&rdquo; Booker said of Trump accepting the 2020 election results should he lose. But, the senator continued, &ldquo;the good thing is that moment when he did that, it was a bit of a stress test.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It gave me the first sign that should we have a greater stress test of him trying to delegitimize an election and remain in power, that there are people in other positions of power that will not let that happen,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m one of them.&rdquo;
