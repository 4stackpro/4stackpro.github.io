<p>SPRINGFIELD — A $500,000 donation made by the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. to the Urban League of Springfield will be used to support the Black community through scholarships and upgrades to Camp Atwater.</p>
<p>Henry M. Thomas III, president of the Urban League of Springfield, said the funding is an investment in the community.</p>
<p>“The donation came unsolicited, it was not a request,” he said. “They contacted us and said they wanted to invest in organizations that are uplifting the community and improving equity and reducing racial tensions.”</p>
<p>Thomas said he hopes the donation will serve as an example of how corporations and nonprofit organizations can collaborate.</p>
<p>“(MassMutual has) always had a great sense of corporate social responsibility and we admire that,” he said. “If more companies weigh in and ask the simple questions — ‘What can I do to help improve the circumstance of chronic inequities that negatively impact livelihood?’ — MassMutual is demonstrating what can be done. In return we get a stronger and more vibrant community because you have corporations and nonprofits working together to make it happen.”</p>
<p>Roger Crandall, chairman, president and CEO of MassMutual, said the company selected the Urban League of Springfield for its investments in education and economic development in the Black community.</p>
<p>“At MassMutual, we are deeply committed to supporting efforts that establish greater equality, fight injustice, and dismantle systemic racism — and an important part of that is supporting the organizations that have been doing this critical work for a long time,” he said in a statement. “We hope our contribution makes a meaningful impact toward these ongoing efforts, and we encourage others in the business community to follow suit and support ways to bring sustainable, lasting change that will build a better world for all.”</p>
<p>12 Urban League of Springfield opens its new Digital Learning Lab</p>
<p>Springfield City Councilor Tracye Whitfield said she hopes to see some of the funding focused on higher education and economic development.</p>
<p>“I hope it goes towards helping young Black youth get into college, whether it’s a four-year institution or one of the great community colleges in the region,” she said. “I hope it can go to economic empowerment and development to promote Black-owned businesses. We have a lot of sole proprietors, but we need corporations to employ folks and help the community reestablish itself.”</p>
<p>Thomas said some money will be put toward scholarships for Black youth.</p>
<p>“We already provide about $40,000 a year in scholarships to students going onto college, but now we will be able to put more towards that goal,” he said.</p>
<p>Whitfield would also like to see improvements to Camp Atwater, an overnight camp for Black youth run by the Urban League in North Brookfield.</p>
<p>Thomas said the camp, which is in its 99th year, will have to hold virtual sessions this summer due to the coronavirus pandemic. But he hopes the camp will be up and running with improvements next summer for its centennial celebration.</p>
<p>“This investment will help us restore this historic institution. It is the oldest African-American owned and operated summer youth residential camp in the country. It’s on the national register of historic places with over 80 acres,” he said. “This donation will help us leverage partnerships with other benevolent members of the community to help us with some of the capital improvements that we desire to do.”</p>
<p>Thomas said he hopes investments like the one made by MassMutual will help promote adequate access to health and wellness services, wealth building and a level playing field for all.</p>
<p>Springfield health and human services commissioner Helen Caulton-Harris said the Black community in Springfield is disproportionately represented in every health status index including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.</p>
<p>“One is obesity. Particularly around our children, we are seeing across the city and the commonwealth that children are gaining weight and becoming obese at disproportionate numbers,” she said.</p>
<p>Caulton-Harris said the solutions include prevention and intervention.</p>
<p>“Prevention is to make sure individuals are exercising and taking advantage of the ability to get outside,” she said. “The other thing is making sure Black individuals are going to their primary care physicians to get the appropriate diagnosis.”</p>
<p>Thomas said Camp Atwater provides many opportunities for children to participate in outdoor activities, from fishing and canoeing to hiking and other daily exercise activities. The camp also focuses on promoting personal development.</p>
<p>“There are great opportunities to work on the physical and the personal. We want the kids to leave with a sense of who they are and to know their story,” he said.</p>
<p>Thomas said MassMutual’s donation is a representation of its investment in the empowerment of the Black community.</p>
<p>“I believe in E to the third power, which stands for equity plus excellence equals empowerment,” he said. “Equity is not a guarantee that you will get the prize, it’s a guarantee that you will get an equitable chance to get the prize, whether it’s competing for a job or for another opportunity. Without equity and excellence, you don’t get empowerment.”</p>
<p>He said a lack of empowerment is what leads a lack of engagement and participation in community events.</p>
<p>“When you don’t have empowerment you don’t take calculated risks to improve your condition,” he said. “You don’t show up for meetings at school for your children or at the school committee meetings for the budget. You don’t participate in the electoral process, which is a reason why Springfield has such a low voter turnout among registered voters, because they don’t feel they have the power to make change. And that is the work we do every day at the Urban League, enable people to become empowered so that they can make a change in their lives and their communities.”</p>

SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (WWLP) – A Springfield resident was taken to the hospital after discharging fireworks overnight.</p>
<p>According to the Springfield Fire Department, crews were called to 116 Orchard Street after a resident shot out fireworks into the second-floor window of an occupied residential structure. The resident reportedly has a leg and eye injury.</p>
<p>The Springfield Arson and Bomb Squad is investigating.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Springfield Fire Commissioner BJ Calvi held a news conference to address the rising level of illegal fireworks incidents throughout the city that have so far resulted in the loss of property. Just this past weekend, the Commissioner said the city’s 911 system was overflowing with over 800 911 calls regarding illegal fireworks complaints.</p>
<p>Springfield Police Spokesperson Ryan Walsh told 22News there are consequences for using illegal fireworks. Walsh said the fine can between $10 to $100 and you cannot get arrested if you have fireworks on you. You can, however, be arrested if you are caught selling them.</p>
<p>According to mass.gov, even sparklers are dangerous. Sparklers burn at more than 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit and encourage the use of matches and lighters by children.</p>

<h3 id="juneteenth-celebrations-in-springfield-salute-black-businesses-community">&ldquo;Juneteenth celebrations in Springfield salute Black businesses, community&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.masslive.com/resizer/DHQKDPrfMLW02YTaNHX_TOSVISo=/1280x0/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/advancelocal/JOKVZ5S6GZBAXEAYOAS2R5DC3M.jpg" alt="img">
SPRINGFIELD — In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic and protests in defense of Black lives, Athena Gamble decided to launch her own business in Springfield offering up sweet treats during a very difficult time.</p>
<p>Snap, Crackle &amp; Pop is a gourmet popcorn business featuring flavor combinations like cookies and cream and pecan popcorn.</p>
<p>“It was definitely a risk, but one worth taking because it has been selling like crazy,” said Gamble, who joined dozens of businesses owners Friday in Springfield’s Court Square to celebrate Juneteenth.</p>
<p>Juneteenth marks the day — June 19, 1865 — that enslaved African Americans in Texas received word they were free, more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation.</p>
<p>The Western Massachusetts Black Chamber of Commerce, Real Recognize Fake and Peaceful Roots 413 decided that highlighting Black-owned businesses was one way to celebrate the historic day while at the same time promoting economic development.</p>
<p>“The whole concept is stating to the city of Springfield that Black businesses matter,” said Tiffany Allecia, founder of Real Recognize Fake, a Springfield-based community group. “Just the way we have been systematically oppressed, we want people to systematically invest in Black-owned businesses.”</p>
<p>Allecia said there is a myth that Springfield does not have anything going on.</p>
<p>“People think there is nothing in Springfield, no one is opening businesses and no one is doing things of value. After today we want people to see that everything we need is right here in Springfield and that we should invest in our city,” she said.</p>
<p>The event kicked off at DeBerry Park on Union Street and included performances by Black artists and a march downtown by Black business owners and their allies.</p>
<p>“It’s important to have events like this in the community because we have to educate our minds to understand that the true power is in wealth,” said Springfield City Councilor Malo Brown. “Sometimes we forget that we need to support Black businesses and how far a dollar in our community can go.”</p>
<p>Brown said the coronavirus pandemic has hit urban communities, which are densely populated, pretty hard.</p>
<p>“When it comes to services and health care and day-to-day life, those are the communities most affected,” he said. “If you look in the news there have been shootings hour after hour, tensions are high. It’s about economical and societal oppression. When we can start fighting that by supporting Black businesses and each other then we can create steps to overcome it.”</p>
<p>Greg Ellerbee, president of the Western Massachusetts Black Chamber of Commerce, wants residents and also large corporations, including banks, to recognize the importance of Black-owned businesses.</p>
<p>“Juneteenth is a very historical celebration for African American community,” he said. “There have been so many marches to protest police brutality, because of course it is terrible and people should be held accountable for their actions. But we can’t forget that economics play a big role. We need more support from local banks and lending institutions. We are looking for opportunities to be on a level playing field.”</p>
<p>Springfield Mayor Domenic J. Sarno and members of the Brethren Community Foundation including Robert “Cee” Jackson also celebrated Juneteenth with a flag raising and proclamation at City Hall.</p>
<p>“This is a very important day in the Black community,” Sarno said, adding that a larger celebration was canceled due to the need for social distancing. “Still, we always look to do something out of respect to all that came before us, so I’m very happy the Brethren is here.”</p>
<p>State Rep. Bud Williams spoke at the event and said he is proud to have been one of the legislators to sponsor a bill in the House of Representatives this week that would make Juneteenth an official state holiday, a step that’s already been taken in other states. The Senate also passed a similar bill.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of changes going on in this country. We know how monumental this day is and the reason we want to make it a national paid holiday is because it deserves it. Black history is part of American history. American history has to incorporate Black history,” he said.</p>
<p>Massachusetts law calls for the governor to issue an annual Juneteenth proclamation and for the day to be observed on the closest Sunday to June 19.</p>
<p>Gov. Charlie Baker said he is open to recognizing the day on a wider scale.</p>
<p>“(I) look forward to working with the Legislature to come up with an approach to this that puts a much finer emphasis and a bigger point on Juneteenth,” he said.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Richard Neal said the holiday is a reminder that all American families deserve respect and to have their freedoms protected.</p>
<p>“Juneteenth celebrates African American freedom while encouraging self-development and respect for all cultures,” he said. “ Today, while our nation continues to suffer heartache and grief, is a timely reminder that we must continue to protect the freedoms that our nation was founded upon for all members of the American family.”</p>
<p>For business owners like Gamble, becoming a self-employed entrepreneur is a way to establish a legacy for her family. On Juneteenth she greeted new customers throughout the day interested in trying her fun flavors of popcorn.</p>
<p>“I have just always loved popcorn and candy and I started looking at the market for gourmet popcorn in this area and I decided to give it a try,” she said. “I do flash sales every week on my Facebook page and people preorder online. It has been going really well and I hope to be able to open a storefront in the city.”</p>
<p>Lenny Underwood, owner of Upscale Socks, a business he launched in 2016, said the national climate has increased interest in his business, from individual purchases to businesses wanting to partner with his brand.</p>
<p>“I have gotten many new online orders, some for $100-$200, and I’m in conversations about wholesale purchases, and it’s all been organic and unsolicited,” he said. “Obviously it is a very difficult time right now for race relations, and don’t know if the increase in sales comes from our allies wanting to support or if maybe there is some guilt involved. But I see it as an opportunity and it’s better late than never. I feel that there is a genuine interest to partner with the Black business community.”</p>

<h3 id="petitions-made-to-remove-keep-a-confederate-monument-at-springfield-national-cemetery">&ldquo;Petitions made to remove, keep a Confederate monument at Springfield National Cemetery&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.graytvinc.com/images/Monument+honoring+Confederate+Major+General+vandalized.jpg" alt="img">
An online petition, with nearly 5,000 signatures, pushes for a confederate monument to be removed from the Springfield National Cemetery. In response, another petition has been created to keep the monument up.</p>
<p>Jared Cantrell organized the original petition two weeks ago, after he saw the footage of George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery&rsquo;s deaths. Cantrell said he wanted to do something for Springfield&rsquo;s black community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought, what&rsquo;s something that can be done here, and where are our kind of shortcomings,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The opposing petition was created a few days ago, claiming that the monument is a piece of history and removing it &ldquo;will not change the past.&rdquo; The organizer of that petition declined an interview.</p>
<p>Cantrell said he doesn&rsquo;t understand why this is a part of history we want to celebrate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every time I hear the phrase, &lsquo;this is a piece of history,&rsquo; I kind of wonder what history they&rsquo;re referring to,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is it the reference to the Confederate States of America and if it is, is this really a history we kind of want to memorialize in this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both petitions call out Mayor Ken McClure, the Springfield City Council and Representative Crystal Quade to take action. However, the monument is in a national cemetery, so they have no local jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Cantrell said he did this to get the attention of local leaders, but that was only Phase One of his plan. He said Phase Two is to lobby federal leaders to make this change.</p>
<p>Republican Sen. Josh Hawley says he&rsquo;s open to a discussion about changing military bases named for Confederates, but doesn&rsquo;t think supporters of that movement are going at it the right way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m against attempts to use this as a political weapon as part of a culture war,&rdquo; Hawley said.
