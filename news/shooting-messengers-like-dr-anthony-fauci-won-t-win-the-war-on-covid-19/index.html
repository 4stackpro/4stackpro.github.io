Reasonable people can disagree about how long stay-at-home orders should last and whether the off-label use of drugs like hydroxychloroquine to fight the COVID-19 pandemic will prove as efficacious as many, including President Donald Trump, hope.</p>
<p>But what we should all agree on is that we don’t scapegoat our government’s leading infectious-disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, for delivering an informed opinion, based on decades of experience and the best empirical data, that many, understandably, don’t want to hear.</p>
<p>Yet that’s exactly what some pundits and politicians are doing. In recent weeks, there’s been a misguided and dangerously irresponsible effort to force a wedge between the president and Fauci, a trusted public-health adviser under six presidents who’s headed the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984. He’s been called a “grandstander” and far worse by those who criticize him for calling for stay-at-home orders that are sinking the economy and amount to “national suicide.”</p>
<p>Ironically, the man handpicked by the president to provide his valuable expertise and guidance in an unprecedented public-health crisis has received death threats and become, at least in some circles, the embodiment of all that is wrong with our government’s response to the pandemic. It’s enough to make you believe the cynics are right when they smugly say “No good deed goes unpunished.”</p>
<p>There’s a reason Trump turned to Fauci — who he has repeatedly called a “good man” — early in this crisis, appointing him to his White House Coronavirus Task Force on Jan. 29. That reason can be summed in three words: expertise, reliability, trust. There is no more trusted infectious-disease expert in the world than Fauci. And trust, based on sometimes unwelcome scientific facts, is our greatest ally in the fight against this pandemic.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that we as Americans would ever blindly follow some COVID-19 czar or unquestionably allow government to indefinitely curtail our basic civil liberties. There’s a balance that clearly must be struck. And politicians and public-health experts must work together to strike that balance. Indeed, the consequences of not doing so will be counted in lives lost, as well as livelihoods lost if our economy remains crippled indefinitely.</p>
<p>The good news is that, as Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force, made clear this past week, new data that show the infection curve may be flattening in some parts of the country, which offers “great encouragement.”</p>
<p>Fauci, during a White House press conference Thursday alongside Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, reiterated that progress, and why it’s being made: “At the same time as we’re seeing the increase in deaths, we’re seeing a rather dramatic decrease in the need for hospitalizations. That means that what we are doing is working and therefore we need to continue to do it.”</p>
<p>What we are doing is social distancing, staying at home, and in millions of cases where working from home is impossible, forgoing — if not losing — our jobs. The government’s massive fiscal stimulus will help bridge this awful chasm for many.</p>
<p>But widespread testing, better mitigation strategies such as ramped up production and distribution of masks and other personal protective equipment, not just for health care workers but for the general public, are key to getting folks back to work and the economy up and running.</p>
<p>Again, we’re seeing progress on all of these fronts. As Birx told reporters this past week, we’re now testing between 118,000 and 120,000 people in the U.S. for the virus each day. And mask production, with the help of Texas companies like Prestige Ameritech in cooperation with the Texas National Guard, is skyrocketing across the country.</p>
<p>Instead of shooting the messenger, we should be listening to experts like Fauci and Birx and understanding that we will win this fight. Not by political sniping or pitting some members of the White House task force against others. But by analyzing real data as quickly, safely and scientifically as possible, and collectively adjusting our public-health strategies accordingly.

<h3 id="meet-anthony-fauci-the-epidemic-expert-trying-to-shape-the-white-houses-coronavirus-response">Meet Anthony Fauci, the epidemic expert trying to shape the White House’s coronavirus response</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/Fauci_Trump_1280x720.jpg?itok=04JnNIzC" alt="img">
Meet Anthony Fauci, the epidemic expert trying to shape the White House’s coronavirus response</p>
<p>“Tony, do you want to come up?” When President Donald Trump called Anthony Fauci to the microphone yesterday while declaring a national emergency because of a viral pandemic, it may have been the first time many in the United States had met the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). But the veteran HIV/AIDS researcher, who has been involved with every epidemic over the past 40 years—and has even treated Ebola patients—is a familiar face to scientists, health officials, and politicians, having led NIAID for decades and advised presidents all the way back to Ronald Reagan. Articulate, candid, and Brooklyn to his core, he has become a rational voice of science and a public figure—see his appearance on Comedy Central with Stephen Colbert in 2011.</p>
<p>Now, as the COVID-19 pandemic takes hold, Fauci has gained new prominence amid questions about whether the current White House has listened enough to scientists, and Fauci in particular, as it has struggled to respond. Reports that he had been stifled by the administration and had to clear all his comments with superiors helped spark widespread condemnation of the muzzling of scientists. Yet Fauci has become increasingly visible as the U.S. outbreak progresses, recently telling Congress that the country’s efforts to test people for coronavirus have been “failing.”</p>
<p>Fauci’s colleagues tell Science he is trying to walk a fine line, being honest to the public and policymakers but not so openly critical that he loses influence by being ignored or forced to resign. Science has covered Fauci’s career extensively, from the two times he turned down presidential requests to lead the National Institutes of Health (in 1989 and 2001, by both presidents Bush) to a profile in which a reporter tracked the scientist for a day.</p>
<p>In that 2012 profile, which has been made freely available, Science reporter Jon Cohen notes that Fauci “swears like a scientist, and his rapid-fire patter mixes the demanding and caustic with a dollop of charm.” Here’s the story’s summary of his career:</p>
<p>Fauci, 71, enjoys a good debate, and this past year alone has found him at the center of hot topics such as mutant forms of the H5N1 bird flu virus that scientists engineered to transmit in mammals and a mouse retrovirus erroneously linked to chronic fatigue syndrome. He is just as comfortable doing rounds with patients as he is testifying to Congress. He&rsquo;s a go-to source for journalists, and photos that clutter one office wall show Fauci hobnobbing with the likes of presidents Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush, and Mother Teresa, Elizabeth Taylor, and rock star Bono. Fauci&rsquo;s critics say he is an obsessive-compulsive autocrat with a serious limelight addiction. But in his 28 years occupying the NIAID director&rsquo;s office on the seventh floor of NIH&rsquo;s Building 31 in Bethesda, Maryland, no serious charge against him has stuck—and no one has challenged his commitment.</p>
<p>In trying to help contain the coronavirus pandemic, Fauci may be facing his toughest test yet.

<h3 id="one-more-reason-to-be-impressed-with-dr-anthony-fauci">One more reason to be impressed with Dr. Anthony Fauci</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.minnpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/AnthonyFauciPresser640.jpg" alt="img">
If you’re a sane, rational person, the role of Dr. Anthony Fauci during the COVID-19 pandemic has been a tonic for weeks now. Somehow, this short, nerdy Brooklyn-accented physician and immunologist who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has been allowed to continue speaking from the White House podium despite his unwillingness to ratify the Trumpian nonsense.</p>
<p>If anything is annoying (but shouldn’t be) about Fauci’s many comments during the crisis, it is that he is cautious, sticks to the science, and doesn’t play politics. When asked to tell the future, instead of pretending to know it, he will try to explain why there is a range of possible futures.</p>
<p>But if you need an extra reason to be impressed with Dr. Fauci, here’s one, from an interview by Anna Rothschild of FiveThirtyEight.com. The amazing thing is that the interview occurred a year ago, with COVID-19 not a known thing. But it was so prescient that Rothschild was shocked to discover it recently when she listened to the year-old interview in which she asked Fauci, “What’s the thing that keeps you up at night?”</p>
<p>To which he replied – A YEAR AGO:
