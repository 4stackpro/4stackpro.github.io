Prince Philip &amp; The Queen Are Living Together for the First Time in Two Years</p>
<p>From Marie Claire</p>
<p>As reported by Express, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip are together again! For the first time in two years, the two are under the same roof at Windsor Castle, as they isolate because of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Philip was flown in from Sandringham and the Queen came from Buckingham Palace.</p>
<p>ICYMI, this photo gallery shows the 70-year history of Philip&rsquo;s time in the British Royal Family and husband to the Queen.</p>
<p>Earlier in March, Queen Elizabeth left Buckingham Palace to self-isolate at Windsor Castle. She&rsquo;ll stay there for the duration of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. And—as an added little bonus—Prince Philip is there too. According to Express, it&rsquo;s the first time the two have actually lived together in two years.</p>
<p>The Queen confirmed the reunion in a statement she made in March, which began, &ldquo;As Philip and I arrive at Windsor today, we know that many individuals and families across the United Kingdom, and around the world, are entering a period of great concern and uncertainty.&rdquo; Her son, Prince Charles, has recently finished his self-isolation after being diagnosed with COVID-19, but the Queen is said to be in good health.</p>
<p>Philip retired in 2017, in part because of his health, but we&rsquo;ll hear the occasional update about him from time to time. He still does attend events every once in a while, like the wedding between Lady Gabriella Windsor and Thomas Kingston at Windsor Castle.</p>
<p>Photo credit: STEVE PARSONS - Getty Images More</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been at Sandringham (which is the Queen&rsquo;s favored summer home), at Wood Farm on the estate. He was flown to Windsor to be with his wife. And, to state the very obvious, the Queen has spent time at Sandringham since 2017 and it&rsquo;s likely the two have contact via phone. Philip made a special appearance (in photograph form) for her Christmas message, demonstrating he&rsquo;s very much on her mind.</p>
<p>Unrelated, I imagine they have thoughts about this crazy time right now.</p>

<h3 id="coronavirus-the-queen-makes-incredible-gesture-to-nhs-staff">Coronavirus: The Queen makes incredible gesture to NHS staff</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.hellomagazine.com/imagenes/royalty/2020040287397/the-queen-lights-up-windsor-castle-clap-for-carers/0-419-794/windsor-castle-blue--t.jpg" alt="img">
The Queen makes incredible gesture to NHS staff amid coronavirus pandemic Her Majesty is currently staying at Windsor Castle with Prince Philip</p>
<p>The Queen&rsquo;s second residence Windsor Castle was lit up in blue on Thursday evening as a sign of support to NHS staff across the UK who are helping to fight coronavirus. The incredible gesture was timed to coincide with the #ClapForOurCarers weekly round of applause, which saw thousands of people stand on their doorsteps and at their windows at 8pm to show their appreciation for our medical staff for the second week in a row.</p>
<p>The impressive display</p>
<p>It comes one week after a video was released showing clapping from the royal household, where the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh are staying during the lockdown. Her Majesty wasn&rsquo;t the only royal to show her support for the Clap for our Carers campaign in its first week. Kensington Palace posted a video of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge&rsquo;s children clapping outside their home.</p>

<p>The footage, taken by their parents Prince William and Kate outside, shows Princess Charlotte, four, in a striped top, grinning as she claps, while one-year-old brother Prince Louis, stood in the middle of his older siblings, dressed in a blue jumper. The caption read: &ldquo;To all the doctors, nurses, carers, GPs, pharmacists, volunteers and other NHS staff working tirelessly to help those affected by #COVID19: thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Footage of the Earl and Countess of Wessex clapping alongside their children Lady Louise Windsor, 16, and James Viscount Severn, 12, was also released on the royal family&rsquo;s social media account.</p>
<p>MORE: 11 times the royals had reason to applaud</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were recorded clapping separately at their Birkhall home where they were self-isolating following the Prince of Wales&rsquo; COVID-19 diagnosis. He has since recovered from the virus.</p>

<h3 id="royal-travel-queens-peaceful-foreign-escape--the-devastating-reason-she-had-to-leave">Royal travel: Queen&rsquo;s ‘peaceful’ foreign escape &amp; the devastating reason she had to leave</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/25/750x445/1264227.jpg" alt="img">
A Channel 4 documentary has revealed the destination she so lovingly explored and truly found her freedom, and the heartbreaking reason she was forced to leave her happy place.</p>
<p>The documentary “The Royal House of Windsor” reveals why Queen Elizabeth felt so at home in Malta, when she and her young family were stationed there in 1949 as Prince Phillip took on a vital naval role.</p>
<p>The documentary explains: “In October 1949 Phillip was sent to the British naval base on Malta, where he was promoted to lieutenant commander and took charge of his first ship HMS Magpie.”</p>
<p>Having birthed an air to the throne, Prince Charles, as well as a daughter, Princess Anne, the Queen was free to relax and enjoy her time living in Malta.</p>
