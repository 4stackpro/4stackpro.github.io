Exclusive Faced with spiralling costs for its Space Launch System (SLS) and pressure to put American boots on the Moon by 2024, NASA is to return the Saturn V to flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Achieving the President&rsquo;s goal is our number one priority,&rdquo; said an anonymous agency insider, &ldquo;and with the continuing delays in the SLS program, we&rsquo;ve decided that the only way to meet, or even beat that goal is by looking to our heritage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The abrupt cancellation of the Apollo program meant that there were several major components left over, including Saturn V rocket stages and Lunar Modules, some of which were in relatively flight-ready state at the time. Certainly when compared to the SLS.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plan,&rdquo; the insider told us, &ldquo;is to take the Saturn V at Kennedy [Space Center] and launch that from the launch platform we&rsquo;ve had sitting around for SLS.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The engineers have already performed the adaptations necessary, and we&rsquo;re confident that we could launch in the coming weeks rather than the years needed for SLS.&rdquo;</p>
<p>NASA famously never throws anything away (apart from the Shuttle program), and The Register understands that Apollo era platforms have been reinstalled in the cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center for the purpose of stacking the Saturn V vertically ahead of its historic roll out to the launch pad 39 complex nearly 50 years since the rocket last flew.</p>
<p>The Lunar Module planned for Apollo 15, LM 9, is to be retrieved from display at the space center. We understand that while it has not been possible to restore the original module simulators to prepare astronauts for future use of the capsule, modern virtual reality technology has proven useful.</p>
<p>Modern technology has also been fitted to both the Saturn and the module in the form of relatively recent Arm-powered equipment. Our source remarked: &ldquo;People were always saying that there was more power in a phone than the Apollo era computers, so we shoved a bunch of iPhone 8s into the spacecraft for redundancy. It saved enough weight for us to load some Trump Golfing merchandise onto the spacecraft in lieu of actual science.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When asked why an 8, the source responded: &ldquo;NASA isn&rsquo;t made of money,&rdquo; and rolled their eyes when we suggested an Android device might be a more economical alternative.</p>
<p>As for mission training and trajectory planning, our source told us: &ldquo;We discovered something called the &lsquo;Kerbal Space Program&rsquo; – the team installed it three weeks ago and we assume they&rsquo;ve been in simulations ever since. Someone sent out for pizza and soda the other day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A press conference is expected later today when the crew will be announced for the impending mission. Our source told us that there was every chance that NASA might re-fly astronaut Jim Lovell to mark the anniversary of the Apollo 13 mission and quash rumours that &lsquo;13 and the rest of the program was actually a hoax. ®</p>

<h3 id="nasas-sls-moon-rocket-is-2-years-behind-and-billions-over-budget-internal-report-finds--techcrunch">NASA’s SLS Moon rocket is 2 years behind and billions over budget, internal report finds – TechCrunch</h3>
<p><img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/nasa-sls-space-launch-system.jpg?w=654" alt="img">
NASA’s ambitious plan to put boots on the Moon in 2024 is looking increasingly costly — and increasingly unlikely — if the current cost overruns and delays are any indication, according to a report by the agency’s Office of the Inspector General.</p>
<p>“NASA’s continued struggle with managing SLS Program costs and schedule has the potential to impact the Agency’s ambitious goals for the Artemis program,” reads the report issued yesterday. “Each of the major element contracts for developing and building the SLS for Artemis I—Stages, ICPS, Boosters, RS-25 Adaptation, and RS-25 Restart—have experienced numerous technical challenges, performance issues, and requirement changes that have resulted in $2 billion of cost overruns and increases and at least 2 years of schedule delays.”</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean that the 2024 date has slipped to 2026, of course — the delays are in the creation of the first, test version of the Space Launch System, the next-generation heavy-lift launch vehicle NASA intends to use for the crewed Artemis missions. That first launch is currently estimated to take place sometime in spring of 2021 — more than two years after the original estimate.</p>
<p>To put those delays in perspective, the SLS program really started back in 2010, with the design stage concluding in 2014 and contracts for testing and manufacturing being awarded after that. Dates as early as 2016 were floated for SLS readiness, but NASA eventually officially committed to late 2018. But that has slipped several times, most recently in January, when NASA said that launch in November of this year was no longer tenable.</p>
<p>What’s more, these extensions and difficulties (some at NASA, some at contractors and subcontractors) have complicated finances and caused the program to blow past its original budget. Part of this is simply in how it’s reported, but it also means that what has been accomplished has cost more than expected.</p>
<p>As the report states: “Overall, by the end of fiscal year 2020, NASA will have spent more than $17 billion on the SLS Program—including almost $6 billion not tracked or reported as part of the ABC.” That’s the Agency Baseline Commitment, essentially what NASA told Congress it would do in order to get this funding secured.</p>
<p>It should surprise no one that a major endeavor like accelerating a Moon landing program is more difficult and expensive than first suspected. And ultimately what matters for Artemis is that the U.S. return to the Moon — “to stay,” as Administrator Jim Bridenstine is fond of saying — safely and in good time. The 2024 goal is an arbitrary one and no engineer or astronaut is going to rush the project in order to satisfy a political agenda — not when lives are at stake.</p>
<p>The Office of the Inspector General makes a few suggestions as to how to better track spending and keep NASA and its contractors accountable for time and spending. But the repeated warnings of delays seem to indicate, if never to actually state, that the goal of getting to the Moon in 2024 is only a few months of delays away from being no longer possible.
