Revenue has assured employers that they will not be deemed insolvent if they avail of the government&rsquo;s Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme.</p>
<p>Concerns had emerged that an unpaid wages declaration would effectively be an admission that employers were trading while insolvent.</p>
<p>The key criterion is an employer&rsquo;s declaration that disruption brought about by the pandemic has resulted in sales being cut by 25%.</p>
<p>The Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners Niall Cody said that he does not believe it will be a challenge for employers to prove that their income has been reduced by more than 25% during this crisis.</p>
<p>Chartered Accountants Ireland has recommended that employers keep any supporting records to demonstrate the negative impact so they can clarify issues with Revenue, should they arise.</p>
<p>The Revenue Chairman has also urged employers to be careful when filling out applications for the Government&rsquo;s Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme.</p>
<p>Niall Cody said there are 26,000 employers in the scheme already but there is still a small number, in the hundreds, that entered incorrect bank details.</p>
<p>Mr Cody said this means Revenue is &ldquo;sitting on money&rdquo; that it wants to pay out to companies.</p>
<p>He told Morning Ireland that €8m was paid to the scheme yesterday and €9m will be paid today.</p>
<p>He added that he believes that number will continue to rise.</p>
<p>Niall Cody said employers should not worry about being published on the list of companies who applied for the scheme as it will be &ldquo;a mark of honour for employers who did the right thing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mr Cody said Revenue guidelines show that even if a company has cash reserves for debt or future expansions they can still qualify for the scheme.</p>
<p>The purpose of the scheme, he said, is to support employers and leave them in a position to be a valid business when the recovery comes.</p>
<p>Mr Cody said businesses applying for the scheme will have an ongoing relationship with Revenue and he does not anticipate that many businesses will need to be reviewed at the end of the scheme.

<h3 id="283000-more-people-apply-for-covid-19-income-payment">283,000 more people apply for Covid-19 income payment</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.rasset.ie/0013ee4a-1600.jpg" alt="img">
The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection has said that by close of business on Friday, another 283,000 people had applied for the Covid-19 emergency income payment from the Department of Social Protection.</p>
<p>Speaking on RTÉ&rsquo;s Morning Ireland, Regina Doherty also said that some 16,000 plus companies had applied for the wage subsidy scheme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of people thankfully are using income support&rdquo;, the Minister said.</p>
<p>But she said that a lot of those people would not have even thought about income support because they were not on the restricted list until Friday night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We expect to have a significant draw again this week based on the companies that have closed down,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>Ms Doherty encouraged companies to look at the wage subsidy scheme and try to keep as many employees on their books as they possibly can.</p>
<p>Employers who have been affected or likely will be affected by a 25% decline in turnover are being asked to self declare to the Revenue Commissioners, she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reaching that 25% isn&rsquo;t going to be a difficulty because in some or all cases, their business has all but ceased,&rdquo; the Minister said.</p>
<p>Ms Doherty also said that what we are doing, in terms of social distancing, is working, and that that &ldquo;should make us do it twice as hard&rdquo;.

<h3 id="more-than-20000-employers-in-ireland-have-registered-for-the-pandemic-wage-subsidy">More than 20,000 employers in Ireland have registered for the pandemic wage subsidy</h3>
<p><img src="https://img2.thejournal.ie/article/5061675/river/?height=400&amp;version=5061736" alt="img">
MORE THAN 20,000 employers have registered with Revenue for the government’s temporary wage subsidy to support businesses through the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Deputy Assistant Secretary General at the Department of Taoiseach, Elizabeth Canavan, gave an update today on the various supports for employers and for workers.</p>
<p>The temporary wage subsidy scheme was introduced last Tuesday to enable employers to keep staff on their payroll throughout the pandemic by refunding 70% (up to €410 a week) of the worker’s take home pay.</p>
<p>Canavan said Revenue has made additional resources available to support the increased number of employer who may now need to register for the scheme following last Friday’s announcement of further restrictions.</p>
<p>Almost 20,500 employers are now registered with Revenue for the temporary wage subsidy scheme.</p>
<p>“Revenue generated the first tranche of payments to employers last Friday worth €5.1 million and these payments will be in the bank accounts of the majority of these employers today,” she said.</p>
<p>Today Revenue has generated further refunds under the scheme worth €8.6 million – these payments will be in the bank accounts of the majority of employers tomorrow.</p>
<p>Unemployment payments</p>
<p>In total (since launch on 16 March), the Department of Social Protection has received and processed 389,000 applications for the Covid-19 unemployment payment.</p>
<p>Over 283,000 payments related to this scheme are being made this week, Canavan said today.</p>
<p>Payments should be in a bank or post office account tomorrow. This represents 90% of the applications received by Thursday 26 March.</p>
<p>She said 15,000 applications were deemed ineligible for a variety of reasons, for example individuals were not fully employed, are aged under 18 years or were not previously in employment.</p>
<p>Canavan said those who have had their working days reduced can receive support for the lost days based on a jobseekers’ rate of pay.</p>
<p>A further 15,000 incorrectly completed their applications by providing an incorrect PPS number or IBAN – they will be contacted to resolve these matters.
