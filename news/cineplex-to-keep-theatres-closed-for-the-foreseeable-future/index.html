Canada’s largest movie exhibitor, Cineplex Inc., will keep its doors closed nationwide into the foreseeable future amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>After initially setting an April 2 timeline to consider reopening 165 theatres across the chain, a representative for Cineplex told The Canadian Press the company will instead turn to government and public health authorities for any further guidance on when it’s safe to reopen.</p>
<p>3:50 Coronavirus outbreak: The best video chat apps to stay in touch Coronavirus outbreak: The best video chat apps to stay in touch</p>
<p>The decision comes as provinces enact their own mandatory closures of non-essential business under varying or uncertain timelines.</p>
<p>Cineplex represents about 75 per cent of the Canadian film exhibitor market across the country.</p>
<p>The company is also dealing with other factors out of its control, including a dearth of potential blockbusters from Hollywood studios into the late summer, and a lingering takeover that’s now in question.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>Over the past few weeks, most major films have been pulled from the lucrative summer movie season. Among the changes, Sony bumped Ghostbusters: Afterlife to next March while Disney pulled Marvel blockbuster Black Widow from the schedule without setting a new release date.</p>
<p>2:23 ‘Black Widow’ trailer ‘Black Widow’ trailer</p>
<p>That puts Cineplex in a tough spot in the midst of a $2.8-billion acquisition by Cineworld PLC, which is still subject to various conditions, including Investment Canada Act approval, that must be met by June 30.</p>
<p>Cineplex acknowledged in mid-March that certain conditions of the acquisition still haven’t been reached, and that COVID-19, and government reactions, have made “business planning uncertain for the exhibition and location-based entertainment industries.”</p>
<p>One of the takeover conditions is that Cineplex keeps its debt below $725 million, a challenge that could prove harder as it continues to pay rent, staff and various other operational expenses amid the closures.</p>
<p>“Cineplex will continue to take our lead from government and public health authorities, and we will reopen our theatres and entertainment venues across Canada when they tell us it is safe to do so,” said Cineplex spokeswoman Sarah Van Lange in a statement.</p>
<p>Cineplex also operates entertainment complexes the Rec Room and Playdium which it closed on March 16 along with its theatres.</p>

<p>Questions about COVID-19? Here are some things you need to know:</p>
<p>Health officials caution against all international travel. Returning travellers are legally obligated to self-isolate for 14 days, beginning March 26, in case they develop symptoms and to prevent spreading the virus to others. Some provinces and territories have also implemented additional recommendations or enforcement measures to ensure those returning to the area self-isolate.</p>
<p>Symptoms can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing — very similar to a cold or flu. Some people can develop a more severe illness. People most at risk of this include older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease. If you develop symptoms, contact public health authorities.</p>
<p>To prevent the virus from spreading, experts recommend frequent handwashing and coughing into your sleeve. They also recommend minimizing contact with others, staying home as much as possible and maintaining a distance of two metres from other people if you go out.</p>

<h3 id="cineplex-movies-online-will-give-you-an-affordable-theatre-experience-at-home">Cineplex Movies Online Will Give You An Affordable Theatre Experience At Home</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.narcity.com/u/2020/04/02/9dbb53eac370404b70c5d3de4a9694b7.jpg_1200x630.jpg" alt="img">
Don’t forget your popcorn! If you had plans to check out some flicks at the theatre before the COVID-19 pandemic struck, you may still have your chance. Currently, there are several newly released Cineplex movies available for streaming on the theatre’s website, and some cost less than a movie ticket.</p>
<p>On March 16. Global News reported that all of Canada’s 165 Cineplex locations would be closing their doors until at least April 2.</p>
<p>As of today, the company has yet to release another statement about its plans for the future. However, with the government continuing to implement social distancing guidelines, it could be a while before they reopen.</p>
<p>On the bright side, Cineplex has found a way to provide entertainment to Canadians at home for a small price that’s worth every penny.</p>
<p>Films such as Bombshell, Charlie&rsquo;s Angels, Parasite, as well as others, are available for rent on their website starting at $4.99. The site also gives you the option to purchase films such as Sonic the Hedgehog, Bad Boys For Life, and more for permanent ownership, although this costs about $26.99/movie. However, this is cheaper than the average movie ticket experience.</p>
<p>According to the company&rsquo;s website, unwatched rented movies will stay on your account for 30 days, but once you click play, you’ll have just 48 hours to watch the film as many times as you’d like before having to rent it again.</p>
<p>Other titles currently available for rent or purchase include Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Jumanji: The Next Level, The Invisible Man, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, among others.</p>
<p>The site also offers some great deals on film franchise bundles like Harry Potter, Fifty Shades of Grey, John Wick, Saw, and more, so you can set yourself up for a movie marathon from the comfort of your own home.</p>
<p>During this time, other companies are also working hard to bring Canadians a sense of normalcy while they’re spending long hours in the house. The upcoming streaming service Quibi is offering a 90-day free trial, and many other streamers have awesome deals of their own.</p>
<p>No matter if you’re choosing to watch movies on Cineplex, Disney+, Crave, or anything in between, there’s no shortage of ways to get your film fix from home this spring.
