News analysis</p>
<p>Two different set of technical government regulations published on Tuesday make provision for South Africa&rsquo;s Covid-19 lockdown to extend past 21 days.</p>
<p>Lockdown is due to end on 16 April.</p>
<p>But the environment department slipped in a just-in-case clause in its measures dealing with the Covid-19 disaster, and the national treasury is providing for an extra month of leeway in public finance management deadlines.</p>

<p>South Africa&rsquo;s lockdown to curb the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is due to end on 16 April, with restrictions on movement and non-essential business activity to lift then.</p>
<p>But apparently not everyone in government is entirely convinced that will be the case.</p>
<p>On Tuesday two different government departments published regulations to deal with the implications of the lockdown on some of their technical functions – with provisions on what will happen if the lockdown is extended.</p>
<p>Departments are firing off masses of sometimes poorly-drafted regulations to deal with everything from how WhatsApp should handle fake news on Covid-19 to what happens when driver&rsquo;s licences expired during the lockdown.</p>
<p>Under the state of disaster declared around the novel coronavirus, those regulations immediately have the force of law.</p>
<p>Forestry, fisheries, and environment minister Barbara Creecy on Tuesday published such regulations to extend timeframes on environmental impact assessments and authorisations on things such as the export of old tyres.</p>
<p>In each case she extended deadlines for the duration of the lockdown, “including any extension to such duration”.</p>
<p>The regulations are also constructed to avoid mentioning 16 April, so that they will not need amendment if the lockdown is extended.</p>
<p>See also | All the financial help available to South Africans during the corona crisis</p>
<p>New regulations from finance minister Tito Mboweni were similarly worded to avoid the need for an update if the national lockdown continues.</p>
<p>Mboweni extended deadlines under the Public Finance Management Act by one month to make provision for the initial planned period of lockdown.</p>
<p>But those deadlines will be extended by another month if &ldquo;the lock-down regarding the movement of persons and goods as a result of the national state of disaster is extended,&rdquo; the national treasury regulations said.</p>
<p>Lockdown extensions are not uncommon. This week Italy extended its lockdown, which had been due to end on Friday, by at least another nine days. Denmark last week extended its lockdown until after Easter, with plans to lift it gradually, and various European countries are considering longer periods of restrictions, or stricter rules to keep people apart.</p>

<p>“We’ve said from the beginning that our greatest concern is the impact this virus could have if it gains a foothold in countries with weaker health systems, or with vulnerable populations. That concern has now become very real and urgent.” – World Health Organisation Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, 20 March 2020.</p>
<p>The world has changed in the eight days since President Cyril Ramaphosa imposed a draconian lockdown to prevent the further spread of Covid-19 in South Africa. As of this writing there were more than 787,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 around the world, compared to 670,000 24 hours earlier, and “just” 300,000 one week earlier. We are heading for the million mark, probably within a day or two.</p>
<p>South Africa has 1,326 confirmed cases, compared to 24 just 10 days ago, and three deaths from Covid-19. The United States’ epidemic has exploded within a matter of days – with 164,000 cases on 31 March – surpassing that of Italy (now ranked second with 101,739 cases), Spain (having on Tuesday overtaken China, with 87,956 cases) and China (now ranked fourth with 82,240 cases). Factor in that “confirmed” cases – people who have tested positive for Covid-19 – under-represent the real picture, while “true” cases include people who may have Covid-19 but have not been tested. The “true” case number in every country is likely to be substantially higher than the reported number.</p>
<p>Other exponential escalations are occurring in countries across the globe – and with them, more extreme measures by governments to slow down Covid-19’s diabolical progress. Strict controls have been introduced or extended by the US, Spain, France, and India, too, with lockdowns including closures of all schools and universities, public spaces, restaurants, gyms, theatres, cinemas, libraries, bars and parks, and restrictions on all non-essential departures from home now commonplace.</p>
<p>As China eases its two-month-long lockdown of Hubei province, having stopped the spread of Covid-19 in its tracks, for South Africa the 59-million-lives question is: Will lockdown work – and then what?</p>
<p>Given the sickening pace of the global escalation of Covid-19, it is impossible to be definitive now about “what works” to contain and control the disease’s spread. However, the successes of several (mostly Asian) countries in containing their epidemics, compared to the striking failures of most countries in Western Europe, are coalescing into a quickly clarifying picture of which public-health measures are working relatively well, at least to arrest or slow down epidemics that started to spiral out of control.</p>
<p>The difference between some countries’ trajectories is striking. Between 22 and 31 March 2020, the United States’ cases increased eightfold (from under 20,000 to 164,610), the United Kingdom’s fourfold (from 5,097 to 22,454) cases, while South Korea – one of the Asian “successes” – went from just under 9,000 to 9,661, with China, as has been well documented, basically flatlining (though risking a “second wave” of imported infections).</p>
<p>Top 15 countries’ Covid-19 cases (and case fatality rate):</p>
<p>United States: 164,610 cases, 3,170 deaths (1.9%) Italy: 101,739 cases, 11,591 deaths (11.4%) Spain: 87,956 cases, 7,716 deaths (8.8%) China: 82,240 cases, 3,309 deaths (4%) Germany: 66,885 cases, 645 deaths (0.9%) France: 45,170 cases, 3,030 deaths (6.7%) Iran: 41,495 cases, 2,757 deaths (6.7%) United Kingdom: 22,454 cases, 1,411 deaths (6.3%) Switzerland: 15,922 cases, 359 deaths (2.3%) Belgium: 11,899 cases, 513 deaths (4.3%) Netherlands: 11,817 cases, 865 deaths (7.3%) Turkey: 10,827 cases, 168 deaths (1.6%) South Korea: 9,786 cases, 162 deaths (1.6%) Austria: 9,634 cases, 108 deaths (1.1%) Canada: 7,448 cases, 89 deaths (1.2%)</p>
<p>South Africa is a beacon for Africa in President Cyril Ramaphosa and the entire health sector’s snapping into action on Covid-19 when the country had but a few handfuls of confirmed cases, but had been preparing for months. The globe’s major economic powers – with the notable exception of China – have, mostly, not done the same, as the numbers show.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom imposed its version of lockdown after weeks of apparent high-level prevarication, when its case tally was already in the thousands; it is still not conducting widespread testing nor contact tracing. Italy did, finally, impose a lockdown, but it was a late responder, only tested those with obvious illness, and deaths there continue to rise alarmingly, given the relatively high median age – 63 – of those infected. France’s President Emmanuel Macron imposed a total lockdown on 12 March, with cases and deaths also far advanced, and on 16 March admonished the nation for not taking it seriously, clamping down with stricter measures on people leaving home and mobilising 100,000 police officers to enforce them.</p>
<p>In the US – even with its case toll now well north of 160,000 – the Trump administration’s “incredibly limited” estimation of the virus’ potential impact (as the New York Times said), plus “technical flaws [in test development], regulatory hurdles, business-as-usual bureaucracies and lack of leadership at multiple levels” meant that the United States lost a month in getting to grips with Covid-19. “The world’s richest country […] squandered its best chance of containing the virus’s spread.” Dr Anthony Fauci, the embattled Director of the US’s National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, who has been at odds with President Trump on Covid-19 strategy, projects up to 200,000 deaths from the disease in the US alone.</p>
<p>Germany, on the other hand, has had a slower ramp-up to its current case level of 66,885, and has had a mysteriously low case fatality rate, significantly lower than other countries (now at 0.9%, compared to almost 9% in Spain, and 11% in Italy), with a total so far of 645 deaths. This may be partly explained by Germany’s early, proactive testing of high numbers of much younger people (the median age there for those infected is 46), and its well-resourced health system. This is a characteristic shared by Switzerland, which also has had relatively few deaths (359) and a low case fatality rate (2%), and Austria (108 deaths, 1%) at least compared to its neighbours. “In general,” a New York Times opinion piece said on 28 March, “countries that test less and reserve it for those already very ill, like Italy, have higher fatality rates.”</p>
<p>The world does not yet know what works to eradicate the virus that causes Covid-19 (called SARS-CoV-2). But the world does know some things now, drawing on rapidly hard-won lessons from the US, the UK, Italy and others, and some more positive lessons from China, South Korea and elsewhere.</p>
<p>What works to eradicate this virus’s exponential spread (and improve health systems’ ability to cope with it) is decisive, rapid national-scale action as early in a country’s epidemic as possible. (At least here South Africa is on the right track.) Lockdown, plus aggressive and relentless “testing and tracking” followed by isolation, authorities’ enforcement of the lockdown rules, and physical distancing, all together work to dramatically slow down the rate of the spread of the disease, even if the numbers of cases are initially high. (See The Maths Behind Social Distancing graphic below). The less any of us are out and exposed, the more we limit the virus’s ability to spread. It sounds simple, and it is.</p>
<p>The sharply rising numbers of cases and deaths in the US, UK, Italy, and Spain (to name a few) together form a terrifying object lesson in what happens in situations where drastic measures were not imposed on the broader population as soon as the first handfuls of Covid-19 cases were reported.</p>
<p>We have all heard about “flattening the curve”, an expression that has become ubiquitous and quickly denatured. In real-life terms, it means avoiding what has happened in Western Europe: slowing the rate of new infections to prevent a huge spike in new cases very early in the epidemic, which in turn develops into an exponentially huge epidemic, and overwhelms the health system.</p>
<p>It is stunningly obvious that “suppression” in its purest form is what works to slow down the pace of new infections. “Mitigation” (what the UK, Italy, Spain, et al did initially, delaying stringent measures) doesn’t – and seems to lead to an exponential increase in any case even once more stringent measures are in place. As China, South Korea, Singapore and others have shown, strict “suppression” (lockdown) measures spread out new infections over time, with relatively smaller increases in new cases coming later, allowing health systems to cope.</p>
<p>To put this in context, the (mostly Asian) countries that are succeeding in slowing down the spread of Covid-19 share some characteristics. First, they tend to be authoritarian regimes or at least have highly disciplined, compliant populations (China, South Korea, Singapore). Second, those countries’ administrations are efficient and well-resourced. Third, they have the capacity (the people power, the surveillance mechanisms) to enforce the rules. A “command” structure such as China’s, where citizens unquestioningly obey government authority, enabled government to roll out mass strictures and rules in a province with the population of a large European country – including door-to-door testing, and food deliveries to residential compounds – with eye-watering speed and efficiency. South Korea was next in setting the gold standard for aggressive testing (more than 10,000 per day), contact tracing, and enforced isolations and quarantines, combined with the strong imposition of physical distancing.</p>
<p>The Economist makes a critical point, though: “Suppression strategies may work for a while. But there needs to be an exit strategy” – meaning a country’s ability to keep in place ongoing surveillance, treatment, and (eventually) a cure or a vaccine.</p>
<p>For South Africa, while we are still dealing with the shock of the “new normal” – narrowly focused on the next 16 days – we must all confront the fact that we may still face a massive escalation in Covid-19 cases and deaths. Now, with President Ramaphosa’s announcement of a door-to-door mass screening and testing campaign to be conducted by a force of 10,000 field workers, we are approaching the Asian nations’ best practices in managing this coronavirus – but we may see our numbers of confirmed cases rise quickly. And, as has happened in France, Italy, Spain, Belgium and other countries, lockdown may need to be extended. And the government will need to maintain and add to its actions and policies to prevent a second wave of the epidemic, assuming our lockdown measures work.</p>
<p>For the millions of people living in South Africa in informal settlements in close proximity to others at all times and unable to self-isolate, with little access to running water and unable to wash hands frequently as advised, and prohibited from travelling to the piecemeal, informal-sector work their livelihoods depend on, lockdown’s prohibition on work may represent a greater threat to survival than the prospect of being infected with SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>Because of this, as Daily Maverick has already pointed out, actions and communication from government to citizens needs to be supportive, accessible – and daily. Western Cape Premier Alan Winde’s observation (told to BizNews on Day 2 of the lockdown) that some parts of the Western Cape were “carrying on as normal’ indicates that there are communities, towns, townships and cities that may still not understand the severity of this pandemic, the ease of its contagion, or the risks they will amplify for themselves and their communities if they don’t take heed of the lockdown laws.</p>
<p>This is a public-health emergency more than a personal-health issue – our individual actions translate into exponentially amplified risk. Government needs to support its citizens both in understanding and coping – practically – with this concept.</p>
<p>Our country has been justifiably lauded by the global health community for taking action early. But South Africa does not have the resources in our police, armed forces and health forces – nor the authoritarian mindset among our population – to guarantee that our version of “suppression” will work in the way that it has in South Korea and China. Our healthcare system is less able to cope than many of the wealthy nations’, which are already buckling under Covid-19 pressure, and this pandemic threatens to cripple the livelihoods of millions.</p>
<p>While the world waits for clarity on various treatments now being researched and on a vaccine for Covid-19, the one thing South Africans can still do – by respecting and mutually enforcing our lockdown – is buy time. The ultimate test of our lockdown’s success – resulting in untold numbers of lives saved – will be our collective ability to enforce it. Or not. DM</p>

Comply with lockdown or die, warn SA women evacuated from Wuhan</p>
<p>Share this article: Share Tweet Share Share Share Email</p>
<p>Rustenburg - It is a matter of complying with lockdown regulations or risking death, say two young women who have returned recently to South Africa from Wuhan, China. &ldquo;All you need is one infected person … one person can entirely wipe out the whole community,&rdquo; Perseverance Sepheso said. Sepheso arrived home in Rustenburg on Monday, together with Bakani Sedumedi after staying for 21-days at the Ranch Hotel in Polokwane in Limpopo following their evacuation from Wuhan. She went to Wuhan as a foreign manager for a language school in 2017. She said the first time she heard about the coronavirus she did not understand what it was but gradually, she realised it was a serious matter. &ldquo;This is not a joke people are dying. All you need is one person … there were incidents where people were dragged out of their apartment because they had this virus. All you need is one infected person, [I&rsquo;m] not talking about ten, but one person &hellip; comply people,&rdquo; she pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this time, it is a matter of comply or die. If you are not going to comply with the lockdown regulation, we are definitely looking at mass deaths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sedumedi corroborated Sepheso&rsquo;s account, adding that complying was the key to survival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow the regulations, I think it is not difficult. If you do not have to go out do not do it. Wash your hands, wear your mask it is not difficult,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>South Africa has recorded five deaths and more than 1,300 cases, the highest in Africa, so far.</p>
<p>President Cyril Ramaphosa ordered a three-week lockdown in an attempt to arrest the rapid spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p>South Africans are requested to stay at home, observe social distancing of about one and to two metres and to wash hands frequently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is an extreme measure we had to embark upon in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. As government, we are aware that the lockdown has caused great disruption to all our lives and caused upheaval in our economy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we all know and agree that this nation-wide lockdown is absolutely necessary to save the lives of thousands, even tens of thousands, of our people,&rdquo; he said on Monday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our own researchers and scientists have told us that our decision to lock down the country was a correct one. They were concerned that without quick action we were only a few weeks away from a similar situation to other countries which have been adversely affected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other southern African countries have put measures in place to stop the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p>Botswana declared a public state of emergency with effect from midnight on Thursday (2 April) until further notice, while Eswatini (Swaziland) declared a partial lockdown.</p>
<p>Namibia also has a partial 21-day lockdown, which could be upgraded to a national lockdown.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe is on a lockdown as of Monday and Angola closed its air, land and sea ports. Lesotho is on a lockdown from Sunday until 21 April.</p>
<p>Two southern African countries - Lesotho and Malawi - are yet to record confirmed Covid-19 cases.</p>
<p>The first coronavirus outbreak was reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019.</p>
<p>There are over 800,000 confirmed cases worldwide with over 39,000 death, with about 172,000 recoveries from Covid-19.</p>
<p>The World Health Organisation has declared Covid-19 a pandemic.</p>
