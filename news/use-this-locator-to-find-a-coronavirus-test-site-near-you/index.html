A pair of startups from within the Georgetown University Venture Lab has launched a new web tool called the COVID-19 Testing Locator that lets users know how far away they are from testing locations and where they can find the closest site that will test them for the COVID-19 coronavirus.</p>
<p>Anyone in the US can access the COVID-19 Testing Locator for free starting today by visiting <a href="http://www.covid19testing.today">www.covid19testing.today</a>. The locator’s features include showing users how far away they are from testing facilities, allowing users to view contact information for the facility if that data is available, and letting users filter locations based on preferences — such as whether it’s drive-thru only, focused only on children, or geared towards senior citizens.</p>
<p>“As the COVID-19 pandemic has expanded in the United States, many companies have teamed up to provide education resources to keep the American public updated on (this) rapidly evolving disease,” said Raakin Iqbal, founder of The Social App, which launched the tool along with another startup, Basil Labs. “We want to provide people with a centralized area to find testing locations and feel a sense of empowerment in an atmosphere that has most of us feeling otherwise in the dark on the information. Our goal was to build a platform for the common good.”</p>
<p>The goal here is for the test locator to eventually help eliminate medical silos and “foster an ecosystem of trust through an open knowledge culture,” at a time when hospitals, governments, nonprofits, and Americans themselves need reliable data and information about this virus more than ever.</p>
<p>After enough data is collected, The COVID-19 Testing Locator team said in a news release it plans to create visualizations and address pain points for testing centers to allow them to better manage their resources when supplying treatment or handling logistics. The initiative is also looking to team up with city governments to help them identify coronavirus hot spots.</p>
<p>“Across the country, COVID-19 testing sites are popping up but are not communicating enough with one another,” said Basil Labs founder Theo Goetemann. “This is dangerous. Silos lead to information gaps between facilities and slow adaptation of best practices.</p>
<p>“We don’t have time to wait — testing sites are maxed out and hospital beds are filled up. We need to survey and understand patient experiences in order to maximize efficiency and safety at testing centers, improve in-patient flows and share this knowledge with testing centers across the nation and world.”

— Colorado Public Radio Staff</p>
<p>12:15 p.m. — People filing for unemployment are having trouble getting their PINs</p>
<p>Colorado&rsquo;s unemployment insurance database failed to generate PINs for a number of applicants since mid-March, according to a report from the Colorado Springs Gazette.</p>
<p>The numbers, which are required for claimants to request benefits or check on their status, are generated by a separate database from the one which is generated by online applications.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do have a backlog of PINs to issue but have been working on that since last week,&rdquo; Colorado Department of Labor and Employment spokesperson Cher Haavind told CPR News. &ldquo;We sent out a total of more than 15,000 PINs since Saturday and more than 20,000 were able to make payment requests on Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The PIN is supposed to be mailed to claimants within seven days according to the CDLE website, but when some applicants hadn&rsquo;t gotten theirs for two weeks or more they began to call. Applicants were able to get their PINs after calling, although CDLE told the Gazette that it was working on the problem already.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are addressing the backlog daily and should be caught up this week,&rdquo; Haavind said. &ldquo;All payments will be made and no one will lose their benefits they are due. I am going to address this on tomorrow&rsquo;s press call as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The number of people applying for unemployment benefits has skyrocketed as the coronavirus pandemic has closed schools and businesses.</p>
<p>The difficulty of applying, and who&rsquo;s eligible, have been among other questions we&rsquo;re answering. The federal stimulus package also has both expanded eligibility and provided additional benefits for claimants.</p>

<p>11:50 a.m. — Denver Public Schools distributing lunches, laptops</p>
<p>Hart Van Denburg/CPR News Cafeteria workers at Bruce Randolph School in Denver were busy making grab-and-go lunches.</p>
<p>With schools closed during the coronavirus pandemic, there were no students at Bruce Randolph School in Denver this morning. Nevertheless, cafeteria workers were busy making grab-and-go lunches to be delivered in area neighborhoods by bus drivers and laptops were being distributed to families to help kids learn at home.</p>
<p>Hart Van Denburg/CPR News Bruce Randolph School cafeteria workers wheel prepared meals out to a waiting school bus for delivery.</p>
<p>DPS offers the weekday meal delivery service to neighborhood schools and other locations all over the district using yellow school buses that stop at each site for about a half hour. The breakfast and lunch program will be in place for the rest of the semester.</p>
<p>Hart Van Denburg/CPR News The line stretched out of the Bruce Randolph School parking lot for laptops being distributed by the Denver school district.</p>
<p>The computer pickup took place for K-12 students on a first-come, first-served basis at 12 DPS schools. Families needed only to present the student&rsquo;s name and ID number. The district says it plans to offer more computer distribution opportunities later in April.</p>
<p>Hart Van Denburg/CPR News Face masks: check. Hand sanitizer: check. Laptops in plastic bags: check. The scene outside Bruce Randolph School this morning.</p>
<p>— Hart Van Denburg</p>
<p>10:00 a.m. — Gov. Polis will speak today</p>
<p>The governor will provide an update on the state&rsquo;s coronavirus response from the Boettcher Mansion at 12:45 p.m. MDT today. CPR News will carry his remarks live. Find a signal near you or ask your smart speaker to &ldquo;Play CPR News.&rdquo;</p>
<p>9:20 a.m. — So &hellip; are we still on for this Zoom Passover Seder or what?</p>
<p>I love a good Seder table. I&rsquo;ll sure miss it this year.</p>
<p>Passover — the Jewish holiday that retells the story of the Jewish peoples’ journey out of Egypt and liberation from slavery — begins tonight.</p>
<p>But the thing is, Passover is an inherently social holiday. “I actually think of Passover as sort of the Jewish Thanksgiving,” said Matt Cohen, president of Temple Micah in Denver.</p>
<p>Seder tables will certainly be looking a lot different this year. For one, most of them will probably be captured on Zoom. I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing how my Zoom Seder works out&hellip; it would be great if the rest of my family would just confirm the time already.</p>

<p>8:17 a.m. — The girl who lent her name to Charlotte&rsquo;s Web and changed an industry has died</p>
<p>*updated April 9, 2020 @ 6:02 a.m.</p>
<p>Charlotte Figi suffered from Dravet syndrome, a debilitating genetic disease that left the little girl unable to walk, talk or eat. Her parents used CBD oil to treat her condition and dramatically reduce the seizures she suffered from.</p>
<p>The Figis’ story has was well-known among parents of children with Dravet syndrome and other seizure disorders. Laws were changed, hearings held and opinions were shifted on early marijuana-based treatments for ailments. It also gave rise to Boulder-based Charlottes Web, a CBD company and an entire industry.</p>
<p>Her mother says she died after being hospitalized and treated as a likely coronavirus patient. Paige Figi said her daughter suffered a seizure Tuesday that resulted in cardiac arrest and respiratory failure. She tested negative for the coronavirus on her first hospital stay but was still treated as a likely COVID-19 case when she returned after the seizure because her whole family had been sick for a month with suspected coronavirus symptoms.</p>
<p>Charlotte Figi was 13.</p>

<p>— Jim Hill, Associated Press</p>
<p>7:59 a.m. — Despite the outbreak, there were elections yesterday</p>
<p>Courtesy of Randi Galliway Foxfield&rsquo;s town clerk and other election officials show off their COVID-19 prevention measures for Tuesday&rsquo;s elections.</p>
<p>Ninety-nine towns and cities across Colorado held local elections yesterday and they had to improvise a bit to get it done.</p>
<p>The small town of Foxfield, in suburban Denver, usually polls at their fire station, but that&rsquo;s closed to the public right now. Instead, the town of 800 created a drive-through vote center in a resident&rsquo;s driveway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We created what we call reachers — baskets on polls that we hand the paperwork out to and they hand it back in, so we can maintain our social distancing,&rdquo; said town clerk Randi Gallivan.</p>
<p>She would have rather delayed the election, but that would have required a law change by the state legislature, which is also on a break because of the pandemic. Here&rsquo;s a quick round-up of some of the municipal elections across the state:</p>
<p>— Andrew Kenney, Andrew Villegas</p>
<p>Editor&rsquo;s Note: A previous version of this story misspelled Randi Gallivan&rsquo;s last name.</p>
<p>7:37 a.m. — Whoooooooooooooooooooa</p>
<p>Take a break. Press play. Watch approximately 375 times. Repeat.

<h3 id="mit-researchers-developing-app-to-notify-people-if-theyve-been-near-someone-with-covid-19">MIT Researchers Developing App To Notify People If They&rsquo;ve Been Near Someone With COVID-19</h3>
<p><img src="http://d279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net/wp/2020/04/0927_phone-1000x666.jpg" alt="img">
Imagine if your smartphone could alert you if you&rsquo;ve recently been near someone infected with COVID-19. A team of MIT researchers is working to develop such a system.</p>
<p>The idea is to automate contact tracing, which is used by public health officials to determine the source of an infection and how it&rsquo;s spreading.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how contact tracing works now: If you test positive for COVID-19, you are asked who you&rsquo;ve been in close contact with in the past 14 days. Then public health officials contact those individuals to see if they need to be tested, isolated or quarantined. This process is done manually with phone calls.</p>
<p>MIT researchers want to use phones in a different way to do contact tracing. They say it could potentially reach people manual tracing efforts miss — like a person standing in line at the grocery store who an infected person may not know.</p>
<p>The researchers are developing an app that would keep track of Bluetooth signals which are emitted by people&rsquo;s smartphones. A person who is infected can indicate that they&rsquo;ve tested positive in the app. (They&rsquo;d use some sort of code with their test to make sure the results are verified.) And the program will alert anyone else using the app if they&rsquo;ve come in close contact with the infected person — within 6 feet — by matching up the signals from their phones. The contacts would also receive information about what to do next and how to contact public health officials.</p>
<p>Researchers say all of the information in the program would be anonymous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The notifications that are delivered through this system have no personal information in them, no health status about any individual — they tell the potential contact that you&rsquo;ve crossed paths with an individual who is infected. They don&rsquo;t tell you who it is or anything like that,&rdquo; said Daniel Weitzner, a principal research scientist at MIT&rsquo;s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.</p>
<p>Weitzner and other MIT researchers are collaborating with experts from Massachusetts General Hospital and other institutions on this project.</p>
<p>Researchers say the goal of the app is to supplement manual contact tracing efforts — not replace it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is one very potentially transformative tool,&rdquo; said Dr. Louise Ivers, the executive director of Mass. General Hospital&rsquo;s center for global health. &ldquo;But it has to be part of a system in which there&rsquo;s testing and follow up for people who don&rsquo;t have phones — and somebody who&rsquo;s looking overall at the epidemiology of the disease, the emergence of the disease, where clusters are happening and having other kinds of responses as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Manual contact tracing is underway now in Massachusetts. Those efforts got a boost last week when Gov. Charlie Baker announced the state will work with Partners In Health, in an effort to try to reach everyone at risk of contracting the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Ivers, who collaborated with the MIT researchers, said a digital solution could enhance the state&rsquo;s efforts — especially with the thousands of cases and thousands more contacts the state will need to find manually.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear when such an app would be available. Weitzner said researchers are working on a prototype and hope to be able to pilot the program, but full implementation will likely require buy-in from public health officials.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not just a technical tool. It&rsquo;s not just an app. It&rsquo;s got to be part of a public health strategy,&rdquo; Weitzner said. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;re developing this as a tool that we hope can be useful to that process.&rdquo;
