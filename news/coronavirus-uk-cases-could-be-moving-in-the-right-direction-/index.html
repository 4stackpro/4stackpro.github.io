<p>The number of coronavirus cases in the UK &ldquo;could be moving in the right direction&rdquo;, the government&rsquo;s chief scientific adviser has said.</p>
<p>Speaking at the daily Downing Street briefing, Sir Patrick Vallance said it was &ldquo;possible that we&rsquo;re beginning to see&hellip; the curve flattening&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He added, however, it would be another &ldquo;week or so&rdquo; before he could be sure.</p>
<p>The foreign secretary, meanwhile, said the PM, who is in intensive care, is in &ldquo;good spirits&rdquo; and &ldquo;stable&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It comes as the number of coronavirus hospital deaths in the UK rose to 6,159 - a record increase of 786 in a day, the Department of Health and Social Care said, compared with 439 on Monday.</p>
<p>So far, 55,242 people have tested positive in the UK - an increase of 3,634 on Monday&rsquo;s figures.</p>
<p>Speaking about the number of new cases, Sir Patrick said: &ldquo;It is possible that we&rsquo;re beginning to see&hellip; change in terms of the curve flattening a little bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t know that for sure until a week or so. But what we&rsquo;re not seeing is an acceleration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Patrick stressed it was important to continue with the social distancing measures to ensure a reduction in the number of new cases.</p>
<p>Commenting on the latest virus death figures, the BBC&rsquo;s head of statistics Robert Cuffe said that if there was any &ldquo;silver lining to these grim figures&rdquo;, it was that they represent &ldquo;the fourth day in a row of below-trend growth&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For weeks up until Friday&rsquo;s figures, the number of deaths had been doubling every three and a half days,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Had that trend continued, we would have seen close to 1,400 deaths today.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So 786 is better than that, although it&rsquo;s still too soon to know what&rsquo;s causing it. It could be a big bottleneck in reporting - we&rsquo;ve seen that after previous weekends - or genuine evidence that growth is truly slowing down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More hopefully, for almost a week, daily new cases have been holding steady at about 4,000 a day, suggesting that, while we are still seeing new cases, the growth in this figure could be stalling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To chart the likely future path of the epidemic, case numbers and hospital admissions are seen as the leading indicators.</p>
<p>The number of daily new cases at just over 3,600 was the lowest in a week. Hospital admissions are still increasing, though the rate of growth appears to be easing.</p>
<p>Looking at the two together led Sir Patrick to say there was no sign of an acceleration and things could be moving &ldquo;in the right direction&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He added, though, that the government couldn&rsquo;t be sure for a week or so.</p>
<p>The number of deaths, however, is still rising - and the latest daily reported increase of 786 is a record.</p>
<p>Experts believe that those fatality figures are the most certain indicator of what is happening, and only when there is a sustained flattening of that line on the chart will they be convinced that social distancing has worked.</p>
<p>Asked whether the current lockdown would be extended, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the government would make a decision when &ldquo;the time is right&rdquo; but that &ldquo;we are not at that stage yet&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Downing Street confirmed that the review would now not go ahead on Monday and said it would instead take place after the three-week mark.</p>
<p>He added social distancing measures were &ldquo;helping&rdquo;, and that people must continue to adhere to them over the Easter weekend.</p>
<p>The foreign secretary also issued a short statement about Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who remains in intensive care under &ldquo;close monitoring&rdquo;, Downing Street said on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson was admitted to St Thomas&rsquo; Hospital in central London with &ldquo;persistent symptoms&rdquo; of Covid-19 on Sunday and was moved to intensive care on Monday evening after his symptoms worsened.</p>
<p>Mr Raab, who is deputising for Mr Johnson, said the PM was receiving &ldquo;standard oxygen treatment&rdquo; and had not been on a ventilator.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For all of us in cabinet he&rsquo;s not just our boss - he&rsquo;s also a colleague and he&rsquo;s also our friend,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He added: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m confident he will pull through, because if there is one thing that I know about this prime minister, it is [that] he is a fighter and he will be back leading us through this crisis in short order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As first secretary of state, Mr Raab is the minister designated to stand in for Mr Johnson if he is unwell and unable to work.</p>
<p>In a further development, Sir Patrick said he could not guarantee there would be enough intensive care unit (ICU) beds in every individual hospital throughout the epidemic.</p>
<p>However, in terms of demand, he said &ldquo;there shouldn&rsquo;t be an overall increase above the number of beds available&rdquo; across the whole NHS.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The NHS has done an amazing job of increasing the overall capacity of ICU and so things seem to be tracking in the right direction,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>And asked whether the government is on track to reach its target of 100,000 tests per day, Mr Raab said the most recent data showed there were 14,000 tests in a single day - which he described as &ldquo;progress&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Prof Chris Whitty, the government&rsquo;s chief medical advisor, said Germany - where the number of deaths appeared to be growing at a slower rate - had &ldquo;got ahead&rdquo; in its ability to test for the virus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot to learn from that and we&rsquo;ve been trying to learn the lessons from that,&rdquo; he said.

<p>Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said he is &ldquo;confident&rdquo; Boris Johnson will recover from coronavirus, describing the prime minister as a &ldquo;fighter&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing, Mr Raab said Mr Johnson remained in &ldquo;good spirits&rdquo; and was breathing without assistance.</p>
<p>He also described the PM as not only a colleague - but &ldquo;also a friend&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Later in the evening, No 10 said the PM remained in critical care but his condition was &ldquo;stable&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It is understood there will be no further update on Mr Johnson&rsquo;s condition until Wednesday.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Total unity&rsquo;</p>
<p>Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing, Mr Raab, who is deputising for the PM, said Mr Johnson was not only a boss but &ldquo;also a friend&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of our thoughts and prayers are with the prime minister at this time, with Carrie, and with his whole family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m confident he&rsquo;ll pull through because if there&rsquo;s one thing I know about this prime minister, he&rsquo;s a fighter. And he&rsquo;ll be back at the helm, leading us through this crisis in short order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It comes as the number of coronavirus hospital deaths in the UK rose to 6,159 - a record increase of 786 in a day, the Department of Health and Social Care said, compared with 439 on Monday.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson was admitted to St Thomas&rsquo; Hospital in central London with &ldquo;persistent symptoms&rdquo; of Covid-19 on Sunday and was moved to intensive care on Monday evening after his symptoms worsened.</p>
<p>Mr Raab said the prime minister was receiving standard oxygen treatment and breathing without any assistance, such as mechanical ventilation or non-invasive respiratory support.</p>
<p>Amid questions about what his role will entail, the foreign secretary said he was standing in for the prime minister &ldquo;whenever necessary&rdquo;, including leading the daily meetings of the coronavirus &ldquo;war cabinet&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mr Raab, who chaired the government&rsquo;s daily coronavirus meeting on Tuesday, said he had &ldquo;total confidence&rdquo; in the arrangements Mr Johnson had put in place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well first of all, decision making by government is made by collective cabinet responsibility, so that is the same as before,&rdquo; the foreign secretary said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve got very clear directions, very clear instructions from the prime minister, and we&rsquo;re focused with total unity and total resolve on implementing them so that when he&rsquo;s back, I hope in very short order, we will have made the progress that he would expect and that the country would expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Earlier, Buckingham Palace said the Queen had sent a message to Mr Johnson&rsquo;s family and his partner, Carrie Symonds, saying she was thinking of them, and wished the PM a full and speedy recovery.</p>
<p>Prince William also tweeted a personal message of sympathy to the PM&rsquo;s family, signing it off with his initial &ldquo;W&rdquo;, while his father, the Prince of Wales, sent a message from himself and the Duchess of Cornwall wishing Mr Johnson a &ldquo;speedy recovery&rdquo;, Clarence House said.</p>

<p>Analysis</p>
<p>By BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake</p>
<p>There was a show of support for Boris Johnson from Dominic Raab on behalf of his cabinet colleagues. The PM, he said, was not only their boss but &ldquo;also our friend&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Some bullish language about Mr Johnson being a &ldquo;fighter&rdquo; who would be back &ldquo;in short order&rdquo; was clearly an attempt to keep spirits up at a difficult time.</p>
<p>Although Mr Raab has been asked to deputise for the PM while he is in intensive care, we learned very little about exactly how much authority he has.</p>
<p>In response to questions about whether his role allowed him to take decisions, he said there was &ldquo;total unity&rdquo; in government and referred to the system of collective responsibility.</p>
<p>That, simply put, is the principle that all senior ministers agree to support a policy once it&rsquo;s agreed.</p>
<p>It seems Downing Street and Dominic Raab himself are keen to show that he is simply carrying out the prime minister&rsquo;s orders until Boris Johnson returns.</p>
<p>The hope is, of course, that he is able to do that as soon as possible. But with every day that goes by decisions will need to be made and someone will have to make them.</p>

<p>As of 09:00 on Tuesday, 213,181 people have been tested, of which 55,242 tested positive, the Department of Health and Social Care said.</p>
<p>Overall, 266,694 tests have been concluded, with 14,006 tests carried out on Monday.</p>
<p>The daily figure for the number of people tested on Monday excludes data from Manchester and Leeds because of a &ldquo;data processing delay&rdquo;, while the overall tests figure excludes Northern Ireland, the Department of Health added.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, it was revealed that Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove had become the latest politician to self-isolate.</p>
<p>Mr Gove said he did not have symptoms but a family member did. He is continuing to work at home.</p>
<p>He is the latest cabinet minister to self-isolate, after Mr Johnson, Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Scottish Secretary Alister Jack.</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, and the PM&rsquo;s adviser, Dominic Cummings, also spent time self-isolating after showing symptoms.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson&rsquo;s condition means his fiancee, Ms Symonds, who is pregnant with their first child, is unable to visit him in hospital.</p>
<p>She said at the weekend that she is &ldquo;on the mend&rdquo; after herself being forced to self-isolate after displaying symptoms of the disease.</p>
<p>Following news that he was being treated in hospital, world leaders and fellow politicians sent messages to Mr Johnson wishing him well.</p>

<h3 id="coronavirus-holland--barrett-keep-stores-open-despite-staff-pleas">Coronavirus: Holland &amp; Barrett keep stores open despite staff pleas</h3>
<p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/349B/production/_87776431_87776428.jpg" alt="img">
Holland &amp; Barrett has kept its shops open during the coronavirus crisis, but staff are campaigning for them to shut arguing their health is at risk.</p>
<p>The alternative health chain has 750 UK stores and counts as an essential retailer because its products cater for people with special dietary needs.</p>
<p>But staff have set up a petition, pleading with management to close stores over safety concerns.</p>
<p>The chain said staff and customer safety is of &ldquo;paramount importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The petition has attracted 2,600 signatures.</p>
<p>Workers have two complaints. They argue that what the chain sells is not essential, unlike supermarkets or pharmacies.</p>
<p>But they also warn that most stores are too small to be safe, with no room for social-distancing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fear and stress&rsquo;</p>
<p>A Holland &amp; Barrett worker - who asked to remain anonymous for fear of losing their job - told the BBC: &ldquo;Holland &amp; Barrett is putting our lives in danger with the pursuit of profit over life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The general atmosphere is one of fear and stress with a lot of our workers and colleagues quite frightened to speak their minds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They said: &ldquo;We do not sell essentials and have people coming in to purchase flapjacks and sticks of liquorice, hardly an essential purchase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In many of the shops, they said: &ldquo;It is almost practically impossible to maintain social distancing, as the aisles are very short width and when we have to deal with customer queries, they do not respect the boundaries.</p>
<p>Why are the shops open?</p>
<p>A Holland &amp; Barrett spokesperson told the BBC it had been advised by the government that it is one of the retailers that are expected to remain open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This relates to the fact that 90% of what we sell is food, vitamins and food supplements, which many of our customers rely on to manage their dietary or underlying conditions,&rdquo; they added.</p>
<p>Examples the company cited included pregnant women in need of folic acid supplementation; Coeliacs; those with milk and egg allergies; those outlined by the government as &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo; groups in need of vitamin D supplementation; and those caring for customers with compromised immune systems, in need of additional support at this time.</p>
<p>Holland &amp; Barrett said it has provided gloves, masks and hand sanitiser to all stores and has also installed shielding screens at the counter.</p>
<p>It said social distancing is being enforced &ldquo;with clear guidance in store&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have limited the maximum number of customers allowed in the stores at any one time, dependent on store size, and tape has been installed marking out a two metre distance from the tills with clear signage throughout stores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Staff have pointed out that customers wanting to buy any of the products Holland &amp; Barrett sell can do so through its online store.</p>
<p>Holland &amp; Barrett said: &ldquo;We are bolstering our online capacity as quickly as possible so customers can order from home where possible, and have set also up a new customer phone line for those customers who cannot access our website for home delivery.&rdquo;
