A Venom 2 trailer is said to be released online soon which has seen a description leak online involving Carnage.</p>
<p>The description hit Reddit earlier in Russian, so it appears as if the description is from a leaked Venom 2 trailer released in Russia.</p>
<p>None of the footage has hit the net as of yet.</p>
<p>Spoilers below!</p>
<p>Note: The Venom 2 trailer description is translated using Google, but you can still get the gist of what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>Venom 2 leaked trailer, Carnage description:</p>
<p>The trailer begins with the logo of Marvel and Sony, the next frame is a view of San Francisco, while someone says: &ldquo;A new hero protects the city.&rdquo; Next we see a scene with children dressed in Halloween costumes in a large house. Next, a man opens the door and gives candy to the children. This man is Cletus Cassady, wearing a mask. Then he says: “Sweetness or muck”, then he takes off his mask and it’s clear that half of Cassedy’s face and half of Karnazh’s red face with his mouth open and sharp teeth, then he says: “I think it will be muck, then he laughs. Next, we see scenes with the police chasing Cletus, who is chasing Brock in his red car. Next, a detective asks Brock where Cletus is. In the next scene, Eddie sees the newspaper about the burning of the orphanage, then Cletus’s voiceover says: “Take the others’s lies - pure art. (This confirms the publication forged by tom hardy instagram photo). In the next scene, we see Eddie walking around the outskirts of San Francisco and talking to Venom: &ldquo;He will finish this.&rdquo; Next, we see a scene where Brock transforms into Venom in the air, who is trying to climb into the church where Cletus is located. Then the frame darkens and the voiceover of Cletus says: &ldquo;My goal is more than death.&rdquo; The final scene ends with the policeman shooting at Cletus, but he catches him with a huge shupaltse, then he is distorted into something else, from what he saw, the policeman begins to scream</p>
<p>Venom 2 still has its October 2, 2020 and is presently not delayed due to the coronavirus; Andy Serkis is the director, with the movie starring Tom Hardy, Woody Harrelson, Michelle Williams, and Naomie Harris.

<h3 id="hidden-panels-venom">Hidden Panels: &lsquo;Venom&rsquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.tuftsdaily.com/2020/04/Venom.jpg" alt="img">
Welcome back, gang. Living in the age of the coronavirus can be tricky and, despite it all, we at The Tufts Daily remain dedicated to bringing you content that will inform and entertain you during this turbulent time. With that in mind, I’m proud to announce the return of my first-year passion project, “Hidden Panels: The Best Comics You Aren’t Reading” as a semi-regular fixture in the arts department. Without any further pomp or circumstance, let’s dive headfirst into the book de jour: Volume 1 of Donny Cates’ 2018 ongoing series from Marvel Comics, “Venom.”</p>
<p>Starring the titular Spider-Man baddie turned anti-hero (and recent movie star), “Venom” is a unique bend on the character, taking him to new heights of storytelling and mythology which elevates the experience from a simple action romp to a thoughtful mystery spanning centuries and lightyears.</p>
<p>Writer Donny Cates is no slouch when it comes to telling sprawling cosmic epics, as was seen in his previous series, “Thanos” (2018). Cates has a knack for conjuring storytelling beats that are every bit as thoughtful as they are, well, awesome. Take, for instance, Venom’s newfound ability to sprout wings and fly, or the revelation of a secret government initiative to give the same alien suit that gives Venom his powers to soldiers during the Vietnam war. These moments could seem cheesy or tacked on in the hands of a lesser writer, but Cates doesn’t waste a single panel; his plan is clear, his plotting is consistent and his pacing is sublime</p>
<p>Let’s not forget the contributions of the art team: penciler Ryan Stegman, inker JP Mayer and color artist Frank Martin. The imagery in “Venom” is nothing short of sinister, a shadow heavy book dealing primarily in a color palette focused on black and red. Since the story takes place over the course of one long, stormy night in New York City, the art team finds unique ways to light the scenes, often illuminating the settings with fire or lighting that gives the rain-soaked streets a horror-movie aesthetic that adds to the book’s dread. The black suit, or “symbiote,” that gives Venom his abilities is appropriately fluid and the illustrations give it a feeling less like water and more like animated paste, at times you can almost feel the movement and could imagine the black mass oozing right off the page.</p>
<p>The first volume of “Venom” is a stellar reinvention of a fan-favorite character that feels slick as can be and is so much fun to read. The book can be found as a single graphic novel or in a 12 issue collection bundled with the second volume (which I also highly recommend) as “Venom by Donny Cates Volume 1.” Until next time, stay safe, and get busy living.

<p>Venom symbiote discovered</p>
<p>On April 2, 2020, a Twitter user uploaded a video in which a black item is seen on a small rock. At first, it appeared like a black sludge. But as the camera panned closer it was seen moving. In the video, someone is seen cutting it with a knife but it gets collected in a group again just like the Venom symbiote in the movies. Check out the video.</p>

<p>The video soon went viral over the internet and currently has more than 19 million views 31.K retweets. People started speculating what it was in their own way. Some stated that it is a rare type of worm, while the others instantly connected it with venom symbiote due to its behaviour. See their point of view.</p>
<p>That is called pneumanatic singila symbiotic group. Basically you normally see them that size but sometimes they join eachother to make bigger ones. They are very rare to find. They have been known to cover at least 2-3 making them go psycho, hear things, and get controlled. — Andy (@masteracestick) April 3, 2020</p>

<p>Venom is a villainous character from the Marvel comics. Symbiotes are a fictional species of extraterrestrial symbiotes from the same comics. It bonds with their hosts, creating a symbiotic bond through which a single entity is made. It is seen in movies like Spider-Man 3 (2007) and Venom (2018) starring Tom Hardy.</p>
