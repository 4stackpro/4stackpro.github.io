He&rsquo;s tied for 12th in NCAA history with 80 career field goals made on a Georgia football record 82.5%. Game clinching field goals, scholarship earning leadership, and a constant assurance in the redzone. Oh, and of course he never missed a PAT. Not one.</p>
<p>Now, Rodrigo Blankenship is headed off to Indianapolis as a free agent after not having been drafted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blankenship finished his career as Georgia’s all-time leading scorer and won the 2019 Lou Groza Award, given to the nation’s top placekicker. He became the first Georgia kicker to ever win the award. Blankenship also broke the SEC record with 198 consecutive extra points scored.&rdquo; Jordan Reid</p>
<p>At the NFL Combine in Indianapolis, he nailed a 55-yard field goal. Though he&rsquo;s not known for the Kevin Butler, 60-yard bomber of a leg, Blankenship has proven to be deadly accurate from within 50-yards. You&rsquo;ll rarely have to worry about him missing a 35-yard extra point. That type of dependability has been valued through NFL Draft capital since the league pushed back the PATs at the beginning of the 2015 season.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what Rodrigo Blankenship was at Georgia. The model of consistency. Every field goal attempt, post-game interview, or practice, he was the same guy with the same smile and genuine goodness about him. He will always be a Beloved Bulldog. If you&rsquo;ve had the privilege of partaking in a Saturday in Athens over the past four seasons you recognize, and will forever remember, the roar from those draped in Red &amp; Black when Rodrigo Blankenship&rsquo;s name was announced in the starting lineup. Once Hot Rod took over the job following the third game of his redshirt freshman season, it was over.</p>
<p>Whether it was doing the interviews with his helmet and Specs on following a game-winner against Kentucky in 2016, or the scholarship moment in the locker room — &ldquo;Hey Rod, tell &lsquo;em what I told you on Friday&rdquo; — following the win over Notre Dame in 2017.</p>
<p>Lord knows you can&rsquo;t forget the 55-yard field goal as time expired in the first half of the Rose Bowl. During times of doubt and desperation within Georgia&rsquo;s redzone offense over the years, a &ldquo;Thank God we&rsquo;ve got Rodrigo&rdquo; has been said countless times even from Kirby Smart himself.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s not just an accurate field goal kicker, he rarely allows a return on kickoffs as well. That&rsquo;s something that former Bulldog Kevin Butler has helped him with during his time at Georgia. Telling the New York Post, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s come along way, he lost the job to another kicker, William Ham, during training camp [in 2016] because he was inconsistent. And after the third game, William went into the tank and Rod went out there and he just started to mature.&rdquo;

<h3 id="georgias-rodrigo-blankenship-getting-a-kick-out-of-nfl-draft">Georgia’s Rodrigo Blankenship getting a kick out of NFL draft</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.ajc.com/rf/image_large/Pub/p11/AJC/2020/04/23/Videos/4891290.vpx" alt="img">
For his part, the Bulldogs’ most beloved player is not sweating it. For place-kickers, there is a bit of a love-hate relationship with the NFL draft. The reality is, not many of them get drafted, and when they do, they tend to go late in the process.</p>
<p>That’s the prospect that followed Blankenship into this week’s proceedings, which began with the first round on Thursday night. While teammates Andrew Thomas and Isaiah Wilson were becoming millionaires on Thursday and D’Andre Swift and Jake Fromm were nervously waiting for their phones to ring, Blankenship calmly hung out at his Athens residence near the UGA campus with his girlfriend, Logan Harrell, and his dog the last two days.</p>
<p>Blankenship was waiting until Saturday, when the final four rounds of the draft will be conducted, to drive over to his parents’ home in Marietta. There he will find out where the next chapter in his life will take him.</p>

<p>“Yes, I would like to get drafted,” Blankenship said this week. “There’s definitely some benefits to being drafted, but there’s some to being a free agent, too.”</p>
<p>Basically, it comes down to security versus early earning power. A draftee can expect to receive a four-year contract, plus a signing bonus. These days, everything is slotted, so there’s not much guesswork involved.</p>
<p>For example, if Blankenship were to be selected by the Bengals with the first pick of the fifth round, he can expect to sign a four-year contract worth about $2.9 million, including a $354,000 signing bonus, according to the NFL tracking site, Spotrac.com. The difference between that and the last pick of the fifth round is nominal ($2.8 million with a $237,000 signing bonus, per Spotrac).</p>
<p>But the majority of kickers in the NFL make rosters via free agency. There usually is little mystery about which teams are in need of their services. An undrafted free agent can identify those teams and try out. Of course, there is no guarantee who will win the job and very little financial security in the meantime.</p>
<p>Hence, Blankenship very much would like to hear his named called Saturday.</p>
<p>“Being drafted is being drafted,” the Bulldogs’ all-time leading scorer said. “It’s a reflection that a team is that much more interested in having you and is willing to make an investment in you. And, of course, there’s also more financial security.”</p>
<p>Blankenship appears to be in good shape. Though he is the reigning Lou Groza Award winner as college football’s top kicker in 2019, he’s not a slam dunk to be the first kicker off the board. By all accounts, he’s competing with Georgia Southern’s Tyler Bass for that distinction.</p>
<p>Georgia, of course, has a rich kicking tradition. The Bulldogs have had seven kickers drafted. The earliest any of them went was the fourth round, which was the case for Kevin Butler (Bears, 1985), John Kasay (Seahawks, ’91) and Allan Leavitt (Falcons, ’77). Both Butler and Kasay played for 12 seasons and Butler won a Super Bowl with the Bears.</p>
<p>The history of kickers in the draft is fascinating. Some of the best ones weren’t drafted. Some of the earliest draftees were busts. Interspersed in between is every scenario under the rainbow.</p>
<p>Florida State’s Sebastian Janikowski was selected by the Oakland with the 17th pick in 2000. He played 19 seasons and became the Raiders’ all-time leading scorer.</p>
<p>But contrary to popular belief, “Sea Bass” is not the earliest draft pick ever among place-kickers. Russell Erxleben went 11th overall to New Orleans in 1979. His NFL career lasted only six years and he has twice been convicted of securities fraud.</p>
<p>Princeton’s Charlie Gogolak gets credit for being the highest NFL draft pick ever for a place-kicker. He went sixth to Washington in 1966. Interestingly, he also was drafted by the AFL that year, lasting until the sixth round.</p>
<p>Georgia Tech’s Harris Butker is a good example of how many kickers make it in the league. The Westminster School graduate and Decatur native was drafted in the seventh round by the Carolina Panthers, only to get cut. But he made the Kansas Chiefs’ roster off the practice squad in 2017, signed a five-year contract extension worth $20.3 million last year and then earned a Super Bowl ring in February.</p>
<p>According to ESPN’s data, 47 kickers have been drafted since 1994, with at least one being selected in 22 of those 26 years. The last time no kicker was picked was 2015.</p>
<p>The studious Blankenship is acutely aware of all this.</p>
<p>“It’s few and far between,” Blankenship said of drafted kickers. “The last few years have been are a lot more reflective of what the landscape is like. Kickers primarily have been taken in the fifth to seventh rounds and I that’s pretty much what I’m expecting going into the weekend.”</p>
<p>One of the keys for Blankenship, however, is his earnings potential off the field. Well known throughout the South as “Hot Rod” and “Rec Specs” and beloved by UGA fans, he is a marketing firm&rsquo;s dream.</p>
<p>Blankenship jokes about being a year late to take advantage of the NCAA’s Name, Image and Likeness era, which was to be defined by a national working group on Friday. But he already has multiple endorsement opportunities awaiting him.</p>
<p>Blankenship is being represented by the Octagon agency out of Connecticut. NBA star Stephen Curry is among its clientele.</p>
<p>And there is, of course, a specs deal on the horizon. To date, Blankenship has bought his famous protective eyewear from Liberty Sport of New Jersey. He won&rsquo;t be paying for those anymore.</p>
<p>“We’re working on some stuff,” Blankenship teased. “I’m just trying to navigate the draft right now.”</p>
<p>Blankenship did lose some money-making opportunities due to the coronavirus pandemic. He lost three scheduled autograph signings and a kicking camp. But he was able to get in one camp along with an autograph signing with quarterback Jake Fromm before the shutdown.</p>
<p>“Everybody’s had to give up something,” Blankenship said. “Assuming I can have a successful career, those opportunities will be there in the future.”</p>
<p>Judging from all the records and big moments Blankenship had at Georgia, it’s just a matter of time.</p>

<h3 id="7-georgia-bulldogs-taken-in-drama-filled-draft">7 Georgia Bulldogs taken in drama-filled draft</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.ajc.com/rf/image_large/Pub/p10/CmgSharedContent/Blog/DawgNation/2019/10/26/Images/154223_101319-uga-photos-HS20_cvchbr.jpg" alt="img">
When it finally ended late Saturday evening seven Bulldogs received calls from NFL teams during the seven-round draft. The first selected was junior tackle Andrew Thomas with the fourth pick of the first round to the New York Giants. The last was senior linebacker Tae Crowder, who was literally the last pick of the entire draft. As such, he receives the label of “Mr. Irrelevant” for the 2020 draft, a joking reference to the final prospect to go off the board.</p>
<p>That gave the Bulldogs seven draft picks in 2020 draft. That is the second-most in school history (Georgia had eight in 2002 and 2013) and ties for the most under coach Kirby Smart, who saw that many UGa players get calls last year and 21 in his four seasons.</p>
<p>LSU set a draft record with 14 players selected this year.</p>
<p>It was thought going in that Georgia might have as many as players drafted. But the surprising omissions of safety J.R. Reed and kicker Rodrigo Blankenship didn’t help the total. They each had landed free-agent deals less than an hour after the draft had concluded, Reed with the Jaguars and Blankenship with the Colts.</p>
<p>Fromm, by lasting until the 167th pick, found himself as one of the focal points of ESPN’s third-day draft coverage. The 6-2, 220-pound junior from Warner Robins was projected as a second- or third-round prospect. Instead, he lasted until late in the fifth round, when the Buffalo Bills finally called his number. Fromm was the eighth quarterback drafted.</p>
<p>“I thought my phone was broken,” Fromm quipped in a Zoom call with reporters Saturday. “Man, I’m just super thankful to get that ophone call. It was an amazing one, just surreal. I’m just really thankful for my family. They’ve been hanging with me for a lot of hours here recently. Just thankful to finally get it.”</p>
<p>Fromm, who has played every meaningful snap taken for the Bulldogs the last three years, will find his path to the field much more difficult in Buffalo. The Bills’ starter is Josh Allen, drafted with the seventh overall pick just two years ago.</p>
<p>The wait for Fromm the call was excruciating for the Georgia coach as well/</p>
<p>“I’m just so happy for him,” Smart said on a digital video call with ESPN. “I was thinking to myself, if I go on Zoom at 3, surely Jake will be drafted then. He wasn’t, and I’ve been sitting here holding my breath. Now he’s going to cold, cold Buffalo.”</p>
<p>In Buffalo, Fromm will be able to join former teammate Isaiah McKenzie, a kick-return specialist and receiver for the Bills.</p>
<p>Perhaps as surprising as Crowder’s call was Woerner getting drafted by the San Francisco 49ers. The 6-5, 244-pound tight end from Tiger had only 34 catches in four seasons with the Bulldogs.</p>
<p>The local scribes asked Woerner about that lack of productivity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I kind of see myself as a do-it-all guy,” said Woerner, who also played a lot of special teams for the Bulldogs. “I’m a guy who can do anything and really just going to do what the team asks me to do. That&rsquo;s what I did at Georgia and I&rsquo;ll do whatever it takes to win a ball game. I&rsquo;m excited to go to the 49ers and win some ball games.”</p>
<p>Kindley was the only other Georgia player drafted on Saturday. He went with the fourth pick of the day, 111th overall, to the Miami Dolphins. The 6-3, 337-pound guard hails from Jacksonville and his father is from Miami, where much family still resides.</p>
<p>Kindley was excited about getting to block for former foe Tua Tagovailoa, who the Dolphins drafted out of Alabama with the fifth pick.</p>
<p>“I’m going to do whatever I can to protect him,” Kindley said. “He’s a great quarterback. I’m ready to work with him.”</p>
<p>Reed and Blankenship getting passed over was a bit of a shock. Both projected as early third-day draftees.</p>
<p>Blankenship, who walked on at Georgia and had to win the place-kicking job through competition, expressed his sentiments on Twitter.</p>
<p>Fuel to the fire&hellip; — Rodrigo Blankenship (@RodTheKicker3) April 25, 2020</p>
<p>Thomas was the only first-rounder selected and running back D’Andre Swift (second round, Lions) and tackle Isaiah Wilson (first round, Titans) got their calls on Friday.</p>
<p>At least eight other Georgia players are hopeful of landing free-agent deals. They’ll tell you that a long wait for a call is better than no call at all.</p>
<p>“I’m going to go in humble and hungry and serve in any way I can,” Fromm said. “I hate it a little more for my family than for me. The wait was tough, a little longer than expected. But, hey, I’m excited and blessed. There’s only so many people who get the opportunity to get that phone call.”</p>
