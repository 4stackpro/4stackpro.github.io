<p>Maanzoni Lodge, a meeting and conference facility in Machakos County, has been closed indefinitely for hosting hundreds of youth in breach of government order on public gatherings as Kenya battles to arrest the spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p>Sources on Tuesday told the Nation that the young people, most drawn from informal settlements in the capital Nairobi, arrived on Sunday.</p>
<p>They spent Monday in training and meetings whose financier(s) and agenda were not immediately clear.</p>
<p>A standoff ensued at the facility on Tuesday morning as police and the hotel management faced off over the illegal meeting.</p>
<p>Police questioned the managing director Chris Musau and two youth who organised the event, according to Athi River Sub-county Police Commander Catherine Ringera.</p>
<p>But through its lawyers, the lodge held that it did not err in hosting the youth.</p>

<p>After hours of impasse, Machakos County Commissioner Esther Maina stormed the facility and ordered it shut following government directives on Covid-19.

<h3 id="govt-declares-maanzoni-lodge-a-quarantine-zone">Govt’ declares Maanzoni Lodge a quarantine zone</h3>
<p><img src="https://3dwnh01icn0h133s00sokwo1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/maanzoni-lodge.jpg" alt="img">
The Ministry of Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe has declared Maanzoni Lodge a quarantine zone after 720 youth were found in a meeting.</p>
<p>While the circumstances of the meeting remain unclear, Citizen Digital understands it was in total disregard of the requisite social distancing.</p>
<p>The 720 have now been quarantined and will be released once they are tested for the new coronavirus.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, police officers had stormed the lodge after getting wind that the youths drawn from Machakos were meeting to strategize for the 2022 General Election.</p>
<p>In the aftermath, a manager and the leader of the group were arrested for flouting the directive from the Ministry of Health that had banned all public gatherings over the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The two were held at the Athi River police cells throughout Tuesdays pending further consultation.</p>
<p>This comes just days after CS Mutahi Kagwe said that Kenya only has 2050 people in mandatory quarantine.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the government of Kenya has confirmed an additional 9 cases of the new coronavirus, bringing the total number of infections to 59.</p>
<p>According to Chief Administrative Secretary Dr. Mercy Mwangangi, tracing of contacts of the 59 patients is ongoing.</p>
<p>“So far, total close contacts reported were 1658 and out of this number, 508 have been discharged after completing 14-day mandatory follow-up,” she said.</p>
<p>The CAS further noted that health teams are currently monitoring 1160 close contacts.</p>
<p>She stated that the Kenyatta University Teaching Referral and Research Hospital, which now has a bed-capacity of 300, will boost response services offered at the Mbagathi Hospital isolation centre.</p>
<p>The CAS also reiterated that the National Government is exploiting usage of boarding schools as isolation units in the event the situation worsens.</p>
<p>At the same time, the government has asked Kenyans to follow the routine directives from the ministry of health to stem the spread of the pandemic.</p>
<p>The directives include: social distancing, observing personal hygiene, avoiding public gatherings and observing the daily 7pm to 5am curfew.</p>

<h3 id="kenya-govt-deletes-tweet-that-ordered-720-youths-quarantined-at-maanzoni-lodge">Kenya: Govt Deletes Tweet That Ordered 720 Youths Quarantined at Maanzoni Lodge</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn07.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-128x128.png" alt="img">
The Ministry of Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe on Tuesday evening ordered Maanzoni Lodge locked and all the 720 youths who were allegedly holding a meeting quarantined.</p>
<p>Maanzoni Lodge, a meeting and conference facility in Machakos County, had hosted hundreds of youth allegedly in breach of the government order on public gatherings as Kenya battles the spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p>In a tweet shared on the government spokesperson handle @spokespersonGoK, which has since been deleted, CS Kagwe had said all the 720 youth who were found meeting at the facility despite social distancing directive will be force-quarantined for 14 days and tested before being released.</p>
<p>The youths, most drawn from informal settlements in the capital Nairobi, are believed to have arrived at the lodge on Sunday and spent Monday in training.</p>
<p>But in a statement, a company by the name Samasource claimed those who were detained at Maanzoni Lodge were its employees. The statement added that the company had received approval from the Ministry of Health to accommodate its staff in the home-away-from-home work-space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maanzoni Lodge has been inspected by the county ministry of health and stated that the facility passed all health requirements,&rdquo; said Faith Nbutu, Samasource HR senior director.</p>
<p>According to Ms Ndutu, the company had announced the rollout of its work from home equivalent programme, admitting 820 employees in different facilities in Machakos county in response to work from home guidance issued by the Kenyan government amid the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Earlier on Tuesday, a standoff ensued at the facility on Tuesday morning as police and the hotel management faced off over the presence of the hundreds of youths.</p>
<p>Police questioned the managing director Chris Musau and two youth who organised the event, according to Athi River Sub-county Police Commander Catherine Ringera.</p>
<p>But through its lawyers, the lodge held that it did not err in hosting the youth.</p>
<p>In the aftermath, a manager and the leader of the group were arrested for flouting the directive from the Ministry of Health that had banned all public gatherings over the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The two were arraigned at Mavoko Law Courts and charged with facilitating an unlawful assembly of the youth and contravening the government&rsquo;s directives and order of holding public meetings and assemblies over the Covid-19 threat.</p>
<p>They spent the night at Athi River police station.</p>
<p>Kenya has as at Tuesday, March 31, reported 59 cases of the virus, which has claimed the life of a 66-year-old patient, who had a pre-existing condition.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health Monday projected a significant rise in the number of coronavirus cases to 10,000 by April 30 if Kenya does not rapid measures.
