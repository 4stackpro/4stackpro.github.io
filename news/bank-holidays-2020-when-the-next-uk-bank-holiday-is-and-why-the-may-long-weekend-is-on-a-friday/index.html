Bank holidays 2020: when the next UK bank holiday is, and why the May long weekend is on a Friday</p>
<p>The coronavirus lockdown restrictions mean some of this year&rsquo;s bank holidays will be very different to usual</p>

<p>For many people, bank holidays are some of the high points of the year, giving us a few bonus days off to travel down to the beach or to fly off to Prague on a whim.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say they won&rsquo;t be welcome, though - many will be eagerly counting down the days to get some precious time off work to recharge the batteries, even if it&rsquo;s just for a daily exercise walk and a family Zoom quiz.</p>

<p>Here are all the dates you need to know, and why 2020&rsquo;s bank holidays are following a slightly different pattern to usual.</p>
<p>When is the next bank holiday?</p>
<p>People dance on bank holidays (Photo: Niklas Halkle&rsquo;nAFP via Getty Images)</p>
<p>One of our two May bank holidays, the early one, known as May Day, was moved by the Government to coincide with the 75th anniversary of VE Day, or Victory Day in Europe.</p>
<p>VE Day marks the the day in 1945 when the Nazis surrendered to the Allies in the Second World War.</p>
<p>This was meant to ensure that the long weekend would coincide with the extended 75th anniversary celebrations of the surrender of Nazi Germany, which ended the Second World War in Europe.</p>
<p>As part of the VE Day commemorations, more than 20,000 pubs were going to encourage drinkers to toast the heroes of the war, while churches were set to take part in a Ringing Out For Peace.</p>
<p>However, like all other mass gatherings and general activities involving leaving our homes, all public VE Day events have now been cancelled - so all commemorations will have to be kept indoors.</p>
<p>In total, there are six days in 2020 for those living in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, though some nations have additional holidays.</p>
<p>Here is a list of 2020&rsquo;s bank holidays:</p>
<p>New Year’s Day: Wednesday 1 January</p>
<p>New Year’s Holiday: Thursday 2 January (Scotland only)</p>
<p>St Patrick’s Day: Tuesday 17 March (Northern Ireland only)</p>
<p>Good Friday: Friday 10 April</p>
<p>Easter Monday: Monday 13 April (England, Wales and Northern Ireland only)</p>
<p>Early May bank holiday: Friday 8 May</p>
<p>Spring bank holiday: Monday 25 May</p>
<p>Battle of the Boyne (substitute day): Monday 13 July (Northern Ireland only)</p>
<p>Summer bank holiday: Monday 3 August (Scotland only)</p>
<p>Summer bank holiday: Monday 31 August (England, Wales and Northern Ireland only)</p>
<p>St Andrew’s Day: Monday 30 November (Scotland only)</p>
<p>Christmas Day: Friday 25 December</p>
<p>Boxing Day (substitute day): Monday 28 December</p>
<p>As ever, there are various other key dates to remember in 2020. None provide paid, free time off work but all are important nonetheless.</p>

<p><img src="https://inews.co.uk/images-i.jpimedia.uk/imagefetch/https://inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1146937581-1.jpg" alt="img">
Why did the May bank holiday 2020 change? When the next long weekend is, and why it&rsquo;s on a Friday</p>
<p>The early May bank holiday was moved to a Friday in 2020 with the intention of commemorating VE Day - until coronavirus changed everything</p>

<p>Many people across the UK will have received a 2020 calendar or diary for Christmas – only to find out that one of the key dates was wrong.</p>
<p>This is because the early May bank holiday was switched from its usual position with the intention of commemorating the 75th anniversary of VE Day, the end of the Second World War in Europe.</p>
<p>The change of date was announced last June, which resulted in as many as 30 million diaries and calendars being incorrectly printed, according to a report in The Sun.</p>

<p>As well as causing printing companies some unexpected grief, switching the date also threatened to cause chaos for many Brits who had already made holiday arrangements (or even planned the dream wedding).</p>
<p>This, of course, was until the coronavirus pandemic and accompanying social distancing and lockdown rules ruined all such plans anyway - here&rsquo;s everything you need to know.</p>
<p>Some Brits had already made holiday arrangements before the date changed (Photo: Getty Images)</p>
<p>When is the early May 2020 bank holiday?</p>
<p>Every year, May has two bank holidays in the UK, which fall on the first and last Monday of the month.</p>
<p>But in 2020, instead of taking place on 4 May, the early bank holiday will be on Friday 8 May – VE Day.</p>
<p>This was meant to ensure that the long weekend would coincide with the extended 75th anniversary celebrations of the surrender of Nazi Germany, which ended the Second World War in Europe.</p>
<p>As part of the VE Day commemorations, more than 20,000 pubs were going to encourage drinkers to toast the heroes of the war, while churches were set to take part in a Ringing Out For Peace.</p>
<p>However, like all other mass gatherings and general activities involving leaving our homes, all public VE Day events have now been cancelled - so all commemorations will have to be kept indoors.</p>
<p>When the decision to move the holiday was originally announced, Sir Andrew Gregory, chief executive of SSAFA, the Armed Forces charity, said it was a &ldquo;fitting&rdquo; idea.</p>
<p>There are two bank holidays every May – although the weather doesn&rsquo;t always play ball (Photo: Getty Images)</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;It is our duty to keep the events of the past alive in collective memory, including future generations - this is how we ensure that such a conflict never happens again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is our hope that the nation takes a moment to reflect on the significance of this date, as a milestone that changed the course of history for the whole world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The May Day bank holiday has only been moved once before, when it was shifted from 1 May to 8 May in 1995 to mark the 50th anniversary of VE Day.</p>
<p>However, the later Spring bank holiday will be held in its usual spot, falling on Monday 25 May.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-may-bank-holiday-on-a-friday-this-year">Why is May Bank Holiday on a Friday This Year?</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.gizmodo.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/vincent-keiman-ul_m5dHThaM-unsplash.jpg" alt="img">
So this year, instead of the first May bank holiday falling on the first Monday of the month, the government decided to make a change. Rather than having 4th May off, as the calendar people expected, the national day off is actually on the following Friday - better known as the 8th. In other words, the people out there who are still working through this pandemic have to wait an extra four days to enjoy a day stuck inside the house doing nothing.</p>
<p>So why did the government decide to change things up this year? It&rsquo;s all thanks to World War 2, actually. Or more specifically, the fact that it ended 75 years ago.</p>
<p>Initially the change in dates was announced back in June of last year, though most people didn&rsquo;t really register that news until around December. And since all the 2020 calendars had been printed, many of them turned out to be wrong, all so the government could tie the Bank Holiday in with the 75th anniversary of VE day.</p>
<p>We won two world wars don&rsquo;t you know, and because of that the anniversary was set to come with a load of celebrations to commemorate the war efforts. World War 2 fetishism is a big thing among the post-war boomer generation, who like to pretend they were involved, so they&rsquo;re going to make a big deal out of the whole thing. At any rate shifting the bank holiday was supposed to ensure people could take part in the anniversary celebrations, and help commemorate the sacrifices made by everyone who helped defeat the Axis powers. No doubt involving plenty of drinking, barbecues, and a parade or two in London and other big cities.</p>
<p>Obviously the whole coronavirus thing got in the way, and with the next review ready to take place on 7th May , and no sign of lockdown lightening up anytime soon, it doesn&rsquo;t rightly matter what was supposed to happen - because none of us are going to be able to enjoy anything beyond our own houses anyway.</p>
<p>But in any case, rather than giving people an extra day off in addition to the existing bank holiday, the decision was made to shift the day forward and have the two celebrations intermingle. Then again there is a precedent for shifting the May bank holiday, because it also happened back in 1995 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of VE day. Though back then everyone had to wait a week, with the annual day off shifting from 1st to 8th May.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably not a great idea to offer up an extra day off so readily anyway, otherwise us plebs might decide we need more of them - like on the VJ Day anniversary, or next time a royal has a baby. But hey, at least the late May bank holiday is still going to happen on 25th. So we have a little sense of normalcy, not that it looks like we&rsquo;ll be able to do very much if things carry on as they are.</p>
