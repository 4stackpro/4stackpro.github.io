Zack Snyder may have been the overseer of the DC Extended Universe , but as we give up all hope of seeing another movie from the house that Henry Cavill&rsquo;s Superman built, the director is shedding some light on the ambitious Justice League arc you&rsquo;ll (probably) never get to see."/>

From Men&rsquo;s Health</p>
<p>Zack Snyder may have been the overseer of the DC Extended Universe , but as we give up all hope of seeing another movie from the house that Henry Cavill&rsquo;s Superman built, the director is shedding some light on the ambitious Justice League arc you&rsquo;ll (probably) never get to see.</p>
<p>While Snyder and Joss Whedon shared directorial duties on 2017&rsquo;s box-office bomb, it was supposed to form the first part of a trilogy, which looks like it would have pre-empted Avengers: Endgame .</p>
<p>To help pass the time during the coronavirus pandemic, Snyder shared a rewatch of 2016&rsquo;s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice with a commentary from the man himself. Although there were a tonne of big reveals , the one that stood out more than most was Snyder&rsquo;s insight into his harrowing &ldquo;Knightmare&rdquo; sequence .</p>
<p>Depicting Ben Affleck&rsquo;s grizzled Bruce Wayne dealing with a dystopian future and a sadistic Superman who&rsquo;d been corrupted by the Anti-Life equation, it left fans with more questions than answers for nearly four years.</p>
<p>View photos Photo credit: Warner Bros. More</p>
<p>In Batman v Superman, Ezra Miller&rsquo;s Barry Allen/Flash was briefly introduced to the DCEU when sent back in time with the use of the Cosmic Treadmill to warn Batman of what&rsquo;s to come.</p>
<p>Amy Adams&rsquo; Lois Lane was key to the future, and her impending death at the hands of Darkseid was the catalyst that would have seen the Knightmare future become a reality.</p>
<p>Fans already knew Snyder planned on expanding the Knightmare timeline at some point in his DCEU future, but now, he&rsquo;s explained this was one of two timelines he wanted to explore. Speaking to fans during the live stream, Snyder confirmed Flash was going to be sent back in time on a second occasion to kickstart a whole new timeline.</p>
<p>For those who were disappointed by the lack of character development for Ray Fisher&rsquo;s Cyborg, Snyder went on to reveal the mechanical hero was integral to the time-travel plot as the one who came up with the brainwave to send Flash back to a different point of Bruce&rsquo;s past. Coming straight from the horse&rsquo;s mouth, Comic Book translated Snyder&rsquo;s words from the viewing party:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the future, Bruce says to Cyborg &lsquo;Well, what times would you send me back to&hellip; What time right now would you send me back?&rsquo; And Cyborg says &lsquo;I&rsquo;m leaning toward this.&rsquo; And Bruce says &lsquo;Do the other one, because you already sent him back here and it was too early – so send me to the other one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s how he&rsquo;s able to get him [Flash] back again. Because in the new timeline he goes to a different point in time that&rsquo;s closer to the event that we haven&rsquo;t seen yet in this film.&rdquo;

‘Justice League’: New WarnerMedia CEO Is Liking Zack Snyder Cut Tweets</p>
<p>WarnerMedia’s new CEO Jason Kilar is liking Tweets regarding the Zack Snyder cut of Justice League.</p>
<p>Earlier today it was announced that Jason Kilar would be taking over as CEO for WarnerMedia. The former Hulu boss is coming in at an interesting time for Warner Bros as the coronavirus grinds the entertainment industry to a halt and streaming services become more important than ever. But now WarnerMedia’s new CEO may have inadvertently given hope to those who want to see Zack Snyder’s cut of Justice League.</p>
<p>In response to the announcement, a fan posted his congratulations to Jason Kilar and asked that he release the Zack Snyder cut of Justice League. Another said that he seemed to think that the incoming CEO knew what he was doing and saw this as a sign of things to come. While Jason Kilar did not respond to these Tweets he did like them, giving the fans hope that the Zack Snyder cut of Justice League may see the light of day.</p>
<p>You can see the Tweets below:</p>
<p>A big congratulations to @jasonkilar on the new Warner Media Promotion. I think he knows what he’s doing 😉 pic.twitter.com/0TrAcQnPvn — John Aaron Garza ⚪️ Nkl-n-D1med (@Ser_Jon_Arryn) April 1, 2020</p>
<p>What do you all make of this? Could Jason Kilar be teasing at a Zack Snyder cut of Justice League? Is WarnerMedia’s new CEO simply acknowledging the people who are supporting him? Let us know what you think in the comments below!</p>
<p>Here is the official synopsis for Zack Snyder’s Justice League:</p>
<p>Fueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman’s selfless act, Bruce Wayne enlists the help of his newfound ally, Diana Prince, to face an even greater enemy. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to find and recruit a team of metahumans to stand against this newly awakened threat. But despite the formation of this unprecedented league of heroes—Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and The Flash—it may already be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions.</p>
<p>Directed by Zack Snyder, Justice League stars Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, Ray Fisher, Jeremy Irons, Diane Lane, Connie Nielsen, J. K. Simmons, and Ciarán Hinds.</p>
<p>Justice League is now available on Blu-Ray, DVD, and Digital HD.</p>

<h3 id="superman-gets-a-life-size-justice-league-bust-from-infinity-studios">Superman Gets a Life Size &lsquo;Justice League&rsquo; Bust from Infinity Studios</h3>
<p><img src="https://bleedingcool.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/infinity-studio-superman-bust-021-1-1200x628.jpg" alt="img">
Infinity Studios is bringing Henry Cavill&rsquo;s Superman to life with a new DC statue bust. This is no ordinary bust either as it is life size and hyper realistic. It is from the movie, Justice League, and Superman is here to save the day and also your collection. The bust stands quite tall at 2ft and 11inches and shows off Clark Kent changing into the Man of Steel himself. His hands and head use realistic styled skin that was all made from medical-grade platinum silicone. Infinity Studios even went as far as punching 100,000 artificial hairs into this piece to give fans a high quality Superman collectible they deserve.</p>
<p>Cavill&rsquo;s Superman is my favorite of the actors who portrayed this iconic hero. This bust brings him to life in a way no one would have thought was imaginable. The trenchcoat, suit, and tie are all cloth pieces that defiantly gives a nice dynamic feel to the bust. The realistic use of skin and hair make this a truly unique piece that any Justice League or Superman will love too own.</p>
<p>The Justice League Life Size Superman Bust from Infinity Studios is priced at $3,099. He is very limited with only 650 units being made and they are expected to ship out between September and November 2021. Pre-orders for this unique collectible are already live and you can find him located here.</p>
