<p>Sir Elton John enjoyed a less than quiet night in on Sunday as he was digitally joined by quarantined stars from around the music world for a virtual coronavirus benefit concert.</p>
<p>The British pop legend hosted the iHeart Living Room Concert For America from his home in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The online festival featured performances from the likes of Billie Eilish, Dave Grohl and Mariah Carey from their sofas and home studios.</p>
<p>It raised funds for two US charities.</p>
<p>Broadcasting from what he claimed was his only house without a piano, the Rocketman dug out his son&rsquo;s keyboard for a rendition of Don&rsquo;t Let the Sun Go Down on Me, and also serenaded a delighted Lizzo with an a capella snippet of her track Juice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not long ago, there was another infectious disease that was ignored,&rdquo; said Sir Elton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Day in and day out, the disease got worse, because we did nothing. Too many forgot about compassion and decency, and so millions and millions of people perished from Aids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this time, we aren&rsquo;t going to let that happen. So, stay home for the ones you love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The star was criticised online by some afterwards, however, for comparing the Covid-19 pandemic with the spread of Aids in the 1980s and 90s.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The host with the biggest heart&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Gaga, who did not sing but did wear sunglasses indoors, described him as &ldquo;the host with the biggest heart&rdquo; during the one-hour televised special and told viewers to &ldquo;find joy however you can&rdquo; during this period of isolation, and to help their &ldquo;local communities&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Grammy winner Billie Eilish and her brother and musical partner Finneas O&rsquo;Connell delivered a chilled out version of her breakout hit Bad Guy - precisely one year after its release.</p>
<p>Eilish, who was relaxing on the couch underneath a baseball cap, sang the track&rsquo;s signature electronic synth line.</p>
<p>Just like opening act Alicia Keys before him, Foo Fighter Dave Grohl dedicated his song to the first responders and healthcare professionals who are treating people with coronavirus, which has taken 2,503 lives in the US so far and killed 1,228 people in the UK.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to dedicate this song to all the people out there who are on the frontlines,&rdquo; he said when introducing My Hero. &ldquo;That are doing their best to get us through all of this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you sing that last chorus every time you wash your hands, I think you might be in good shape,&rdquo; joked Grohl.</p>
<p>Fellow rocker Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day said it was &ldquo;an honour&rdquo; to offer up an acoustic rendition of Boulevard of Broken Dreams.</p>
<p>Camila Cabello and boyfriend singer Shawn Mendes are self-isolating together and gave fans a domestic dose of her recent hit My Oh My.</p>
<p>The US-Cuban singer even sang the DaBaby part - in the rapper&rsquo;s absence - after briefly checking the lyrics on her phone.</p>
<p>Manband Backstreet Boys rolled back the years with a performance of their 1999 hit I Want It That Way.</p>
<p>Unlike in the glory days, however, the guys were singing separately, from their respective family homes (with kids popping in and out), and joined together in a WhatsApp/Zoom-style grid - essentially a retro pop version of your post-coronavirus work meetings, but with added Los Angeles swimming pool, courtesy of Nick Carter.</p>
<p>Aside from the host, the UK was represented by Sam Smith, who sang their ballad How Do You Sleep, snapping their fingers for added percussion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t play an instrument,&rdquo; admitted Smith, adding. &ldquo;So this is just my voice&hellip; I hope that&rsquo;s OK?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mariah Carey thanked her twins - aka &ldquo;Dem Babies&rdquo; - for &ldquo;staying patient with me at home and not complaining too much&rdquo;.</p>
<p>She also belted out her 1996 track Always Be My Baby alongside a keyboard player and some remotely placed backing singers, who were beamed in.</p>
<p>The show, which was broadcast on Fox TV and iHeart Radio in the US, raised funds for Feeding America and the First Responders Children&rsquo;s Foundation.</p>
<p>The amount raised was not immediately revealed, but household goods giant Procter &amp; Gamble gave $500,000 (£400,000), which was matched by Fox.</p>
<p>The event filled the gap in the schedule that was left when the iHeart Radio Music Awards were cancelled.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, James Corden is hosting a similar fundraiser from his garage on Monday, with Eilish, Dua Lipa and BTS among those due to join him remotely.</p>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/PRC_147981176_1585578718.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;crop=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">

<p>Elton John is currently self-isolating during the coronavirus pandemic in his Los Angeles home with husband David Furnish and their sons, Zachary and Leighton.</p>
<p>And the music legend, 73, gave fans a sneak peek into his luxury pad, located in Beverly Hills, while hosting iHeart Radio’s coronavirus benefit concert live from his kitchen.</p>
<p>Elton was seen sitting at the table in his swanky kitchen that comes complete with mirrored walls, fancy light fittings and bright vases decorating his worktops.</p>
<p>But, while his house is filled with cool art prints a plenty, the thing it’s lacking is a piano.</p>
<p>Yup, Elton revealed while hosting Sunday night’s gig that he’s ended up in quarantine in the only house he’s ever been in that doesn’t have a piano.</p>
<p>Given that Elton John and tinkling on those ivories come hand in hand, we’re pretty surprised at this.</p>

<p>His LA home is the only one of his homes that doesn’t have a piano, but Elton did manage to find a keyboard (Picture: Fox)</p>
<p>He told fans watching at home: ‘I happen to be quarantined in the only house I’ve ever been in without a piano.’</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Although, Elton can still get his piano fix as mid-way through the live (virtual) broadcast, that saw the star joined by the likes of Lizzo and Mariah Carey, he managed to find a keyboard to give us all a rendition of Don’t Let The Sun Go Down On Me.</p>
<p>Where there’s an Elton, there’s a way.</p>
<p>He was also seen hosting from his study/living room in front of huge shelves stacked with books (Picture: Fox)</p>
<p>Fans also saw Elton in his study/living room area, where he presented in front of a row of shelves stacked with cool ornaments, photos of his sons Zachary, nine, and Elijah, seven, and piles of books.</p>
<p>We wonder if he’s got a copy of his new memoir, Me: Elton John, sitting pretty on there?</p>
<p>Of course, it wouldn’t be Elton’s home without some pretty-out there prints, with one of his sitting rooms boasting an eye-catching zebra print rug, a bold pink coffee table, fluffy chairs and a graphic art print on the wall, as seen in Architectural Digest.</p>

<p>The house, which Elton reportedly bought back in 2012 for a cool $7.2million (£5,814,720) is also home to a swimming pool out the back.</p>
<p>Not a bad place to self-isolate, eh.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>‘We’re in the house here, the boys are here, David, me, Zachary and Elijah,’ Elton, who celebrated his birthday at home in isolation, told Apple Music recently.</p>
<p>‘We’re hunkering down and everything is so far, so good.’</p>
<p>Sharing his thoughts on lockdowns taking place across the globe to try and control the coronavirus pandemic, Elton said.</p>
<p>‘Maybe it will bring people together and people will be more thoughtful of each other.’</p>

<p>Fox</p>
<p>Musicians from across the country joined together from their respective homes on Sunday night for the iHeart Living Room Concert for America, an effort to raise money to fight the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Elton John pulled double duty as host and performer for the hour-long benefit, which was televised on Fox and livestreamed online. It provided confined music fans across America with some much-needed entertainment while also raising money for First Responders Children&rsquo;s Foundation and Feeding America. This living room concert raise over $8 million for coronavirus relief and attracted almost 9 million TV viewers.</p>
<p>The benefit featured performances from Alicia Keys, Backstreet Boys, Dave Grohl, Camila Cabello and Shawn Mendes, Sam Smith, Tim McGraw, Demi Lovato and Green Day&rsquo;s Billie Joe Armstrong. Music fans were treated to special appearances by Lizzo and Lady Gaga, who encouraged fans to remain positive, have hope and stay home to help stop the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Highlights included Backstreet Boys delivering an epic rendition of I Want It That Way from their five different locations around the country. Alicia Keys opened the show with an acoustic rendition of her latest single Underdog. Also, Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas O&rsquo;Connell live streaming from her bedroom her No. 1 hit Bad Guy.</p>
<p>One of the more unexpected and sublime moments came when two-time Grammy-winning R&amp;B crooner H.E.R. broke out some new music from her couch in New York City with just an acoustic guitar. H.E.R flawlessly performed a passionate debut track, Keep Holding On.</p>
<p>Mariah Carey&rsquo;s intimate performance of her classic Always Be My Baby closed out the evening live from her home studio in New York. Her backup singers harmonized with her perfectly over the livestream.</p>
<p>Daily livestreams from musicians and bands have become common during these unusual days of quarantine.</p>
<p>Watch the Full iHeart Living Room Concert For America below until Wednesday, April 1, at 7 p.m. PT.
