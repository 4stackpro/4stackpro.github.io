<p>Country music star Mike Denver admitted it was horrible missing the birth of his baby girl due to Covid-19 restrictions.</p>
<p>However, the new dad, 39, said he has found a silver lining in the fact he has been forced off work and left to bond at home with his wife and their newborn.</p>
<p>The Galway singer, who welcomed his daughter Mia, with his wife Liz, five weeks early, last week, said: “We are on a pause now and it seems to be a longer pause than we were expecting but it is a great time for me.</p>
<p>“Mum Liz and baby Mia are doing great it is a very exciting time for us, so we are having a great time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Opening up about some of the complications along the way, heightened by the strict hospital restrictions in recent weeks, he added: “The baby is doing mighty, she is getting stronger everyday, she was a few weeks early but she is back on track now and feeding well, and she is keeping us all on out toes.</p>
<p>(Image: Mike Denver Instagram)</p>
<p>“We were expecting it, [ to be early ] but I suppose difficult times in the last few weeks, the last month really, it made it a little more difficult than normal.</p>
<p>“It was very strict and partners weren’t allowed in.”</p>
<p>“It was a long road, from October really, it’s been a long road where she has been nearly bed bound for the past few months.</p>
<p>“Between bed rest and hospitals, it’s been a long road but it is definitely worth it when you see the end result.</p>
<p>“There is nothing really like it.”</p>
<p>“She was a little on the small side, she was 4lb 13 only, but as I said she is thriving.”</p>
<p>The devoted husband, who celebrated his eight year anniversary with his wife Liz yesterday from their home also told how difficult it was to have to be kept away from his wife after she gave birth.</p>
<p>Speaking to Oliver Callan on RTE Radio One, he said: “It was a difficult time for everyone, there were people giving out and upset they couldn’t get in for the birth but I didn’t get a chance to go in.</p>
<p>“I got to see baby Mia as they were bringing her up to the up to a nice unit upstairs.</p>
<p>“It is always the wife or the partner that needs support more than the baby in the early days and that was more difficult I suppose that I wasn’t allowed in to see Liz.</p>
<p>“I spent, that first night in the nico unit, with Mia, it’s intensive care basically for the babies so I spent the night up there with her.</p>
<p>“But as I say we got through it and with the times we are in we just have to abide by the rules and do the best we can.”</p>
<p>In a message to all of the other men out there, set to miss the birth of their babys over the next few weeks he said: “I’d definitely say, it is disheartening and you’d love to be there to spend time with them and see the birth.</p>
<p>“And I suppose it is a huge part of life for ourselves and everyone having a baby but it’s horrible not being let in and I suppose when you do get them home it brings the excitement out and you forget all the bad times really.”

<p>Mike Denver has shared the first pictures of baby Mia after coming home to Portumna.</p>
<p>He country music superstar got an amazing surprise this week when his wife Liz and their little one came home from hospital early.</p>
<p>He told RSVP Live: &ldquo;Liz was supposed to stay in until at least Thursday and it could have been another week for Mia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I arrived at the hospital the other morning and the doctors said, &lsquo;I think the whole crew are coming home with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was lovely for Liz to be allowed home because it would have broken my heart to see her separated from her baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mia arrived into the world five weeks early, weighing just under five lbs. So it was no surprise that doctors in Galway University Hospital wanted to take all precautions before she was allowed home.</p>
<p>At just 10 days old, she is already proving to be strong little lady.</p>

<p>Mike added: &ldquo;Mia was a little bit small. The nurses said that she was very healthy and she was making great progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no need to keep her in because everything was good- she is absolutely flying it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mike and Liz have now cut themselves off from the outside world as they self-isolate at home.</p>
<p>He explained: &ldquo;We have put ourselves into total isolation and I have the shelves stocked up to make sure we have enough of everything for Mia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is our main concern and there is no fear of us, we will survive on porridge, pasta and a four stone bag of spuds!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snoopy has taken well to her and he didn&rsquo;t mind her coming in at all, that was one thing that we were worried about because he can be funny about new people coming into his territory.&rdquo;
