(CNN) Former President Barack Obama wished the nation a &ldquo;joyful&rdquo; Easter Sunday, while remarking on the dramatic differences in celebrating this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although our celebrations may look different this year, our unwavering faith remains the same. For me, Easter is a time of hope &ndash; a reminder of rebirth and renewal &ndash; and a belief in a better day to come. From my family to yours, we wish you all a blessed and joyful Easter,&rdquo; the former president wrote on Twitter.</p>
<p>Due to the coronavirus pandemic, US officials have recommended social distancing and urged Americans not to attend services larger than 10 people — leaving churches empty and congregations to celebrate online.</p>
<p>Former first lady Michelle Obama on Instagram wrote that this year, she has been &ldquo;feeling a newfound sense of gratitude for all the little moments I used to take for granted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As many of us celebrate Easter and Passover during this time of physical distancing, I know that we may be missing the togetherness and traditions we&rsquo;ve shared in years past,&rdquo; she wrote.</p>
