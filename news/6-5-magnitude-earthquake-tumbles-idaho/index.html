BOISE, Idaho — An earthquake struck north of Boise Tuesday evening, with people across a large area reporting shaking.</p>
<p>The U.S. Geological Survey reports the magnitude 6.5 temblor struck just before 6 p.m. It was centered 73 miles (118 kilometers) northeast of Meridian, near the rural mountain town of Stanley. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.</p>
<p>More than 2 million live in the region that could feel the Idaho quake, according to the USGS, with reports of shaking coming in from as far away as Helena, Montana, and Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
<p>Marcus Smith, an emergency room health unit coordinator at St. Luke’s Wood River Medical Center, said the hospital, about 65 miles (104 kilometers) south of the epicenter, shook but the quake didn’t interfere with the treatment of any patients. The hospital in Blaine County is on the front line of Idaho’s coronavirus outbreak, in a region with the nation’s highest per-capita rates of known COVID-19 cases outside of New York City and its surrounding counties.</p>
<p>“It felt like a wave going through the ground, so I knew right away what it was. It just felt like waves going through the ground,” he said.</p>
<p>The earthquake added stress during an already tense time for the region, but Smith said everything seemed fine, for now. “Until the next one, I guess,” Smith said. “I mean, that’s what we do. We’re all good.”</p>
<p>Brett Woolley, the owner of Bridge Street Grill in Stanley, said he heard the earthquake coming before he felt it.</p>
<p>“I heard the roar, and at first it sounded like the wind but then the roar was tremendous,” Woolley said about 10 minutes after the earthquake. “The whole house was rattling, and I started to panic. I’m sitting here perfectly still and the water next to me is still vibrating.”</p>
<p>Dr. Lucy Jones, a seismologist at Caltech and the founder of the Dr. Lucy Jones Center for Science and Seismology, said the Idaho region has an earthquake of about this size every 30 or 40 years. The most recent one, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake near Borah Peak in 1983, killed two children in Challis and caused an estimated $12.5 million in property damage across Challis and Mackay.</p>
<p>That quake was along what scientists call a “normal fault,” with the quake causing vertical movement, she said. Tuesday’s quake appeared to be on an unmapped “strike-slip fault,” causing mostly horizontal movement along the fault line.</p>
<p>“This is one that wasn’t obvious enough to be mapped before now,” Jones said.</p>
<p>Unmapped faults of this size are rarer in highly populated areas like California, she said, but in sparsely populated and remote regions like central Idaho they’re less likely to cause damage and less likely to be a focus of geologists and seismologists.</p>
<p>Residents in the region will likely continue to feel aftershocks, she said. The area had already recorded five aftershocks within the first hours after the 6.5 earthquake.</p>
<p>“An aftershock is just an earthquake, but it happens at a time that doesn’t surprise us,” she said. “They do every bit as much damage.”</p>
<p>People in an earthquake should drop to the floor and cover their heads with their arms, she said.</p>
<p>“Get to the floor before the earthquake throws you there, and if you have a table nearby, get under it and hold onto it,” Jones said. “Running in an earthquake is incredibly dangerous — people die from running in an earthquake. Just get down and try to cover.”

<h3 id="earthquake-shakes-boise-idaho-area-damage-limited-so-far">Earthquake shakes Boise, Idaho, area; damage limited so far</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.idahostatesman.com/latest-news/4y9kee/picture241668731/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/idaho%20quake.jpg" alt="img">
An earthquake shook Boise and the Treasure Valley at 5:52 p.m. Tuesday, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.</p>
<p>The shaking lasted for 20-30 seconds, with a small pause, at a home in East Boise and at the Idaho Statesman building on the Boise Bench.</p>
<p>The U.S. Geological Survey pegged the earthquake at 6.5 magnitude, with an epicenter in the mountains northwest of Stanley and 45 miles west of Challis. The quake hit near the northern-most turn in Idaho 21 between Stanley and Lowman, or 73 miles northeast of Meridian.</p>
<p>There were at least 20 aftershocks, according to USGS, with a magnitude-4.6 tremor giving parts of Boise a strong, brief shake at 6:27 p.m. A 4.4 struck at 8:09 p.m.</p>

<p>Stanley Mayor Steve Botti told the Idaho Statesman about 8:45 p.m. that he hadn’t seen any damage but the town was “still surveying for damage.”</p>
<p>“Stuff was flying all over the place,” Botti said earlier. “I was upstairs and I tried to walk down the steps and I couldn’t because it was shaking too much.”</p>
<p>Officials in the Treasure Valley also had encouraging early news.</p>
<p>“We don’t have any reports of damage just yet,” Hayley Williams of the Boise Police Department said shortly after the first quake.</p>
<p>“We haven’t sent any first responders out — police or fire,” said Stephany Galbreaith, of the Meridian Police Department.</p>
<p>Boise Mayor Lauren McLean said that “first responders are out doing building checks downtown. We’ve already done a scan of all of our public works facilities and they all look good.”</p>
<p>According to past Idaho Statesman research, the magnitude-6.5 quake would be the second-largest in Idaho history if it stands (the number often is adjusted with more information). The Borah Peak earthquake in 1983, which was a magnitude 6.9, killed two people in Challis near the quake’s epicenter. The second-largest on the books now is a three-way tie at 5.8 from 1983-84.</p>
<p>The five strongest previous Idaho earthquakes were all in the Challis area.</p>
<p>Expect more earthquakes in the days to come, USGS says. There’s a 48% chance of a magnitude-5.0 quake or higher, its forecast says.</p>
<p>“According to our forecast, over the next one week there is a 4% chance of one or more aftershocks that are larger than magnitude 6.5,” the USGS forecast says. “It is likely that there will be smaller earthquakes over the next one week. … Magnitude 3 and above are large enough to be felt near the epicenter. The number of aftershocks will drop off over time, but a large aftershock can increase the numbers again, temporarily.”</p>
<p>Local resident Anna Eberlin sent the Idaho Statesman a photo of a mirror that crashed to the floor in her house.</p>
<p>“It scared my kids and me half to death,” she said. “Everyone is OK after some tears and nervous excitement about their first earthquake.”</p>
<p>Provided by Anna Eberlin</p>
<p>Typically, Idaho earthquakes occur in the central and southeast parts of the state. Recently, a swarm of low-magnitude quakes rumbled across parts of Idaho, Utah and California.</p>
<p>Two earthquakes rattled the Boise area in the mid-1940s, according to the Idaho Geological Survey. Another in 1916 “wrecked several brick chimneys at Boise and sent residents rushing into the street.”</p>
<p>Central Idaho has seen its share of seismic activity in recent years. The region saw swarms of earthquakes in December 2015; December 2014 to January 2015; December 2014; and April to May of 2014. Those included a 5.0 earthquake on Jan. 3, 2015, and a 4.8 earthquake on April 13, 2014.</p>
<p>There were immediate reports that Tuesday’s earthquake was felt in Coeur d’Alene, Twin Falls and Hailey in Idaho; Spokane, Washington; Utah; and Missoula and Bozeman in Montana.</p>
<p>“I am from Florida and we have always had hurricanes growing up, but I had never been in an earthquake,” said Kurt Wisehart, of Boise. “This was the first time for me, which is why I walked out ’cause this is weird. Like, what’s everyone do?”</p>
<p>Meridian resident Zach Borman said he and his wife experienced nausea after the quake.</p>
<p>“Felt a bit longer than a minute,” Borman said. “While minding our social-distancing business, the house started a low rumbling. I assumed it was a heavy wind, or some sort of issue with our air conditioning, but my wife and the dogs were both reacting to it and it just kept going.</p>
<p>“My first thought when I realized it was probably an earthquake was: ‘Wow. More stacked on top (of the coronavirus pandemic)? Way to add insult to injury.’ ”</p>
<p>Spencer Tangen of the National Weather Service in Boise said it might not be unusual to feel aftershocks with an earthquake that size. So did McLean.</p>
<p>“I’d just like the community to know that there is likely a very real possibility with a quake of that size that you’ll feel more,” McLean said.</p>
<p>Intermountain Gas spokesman Mark Hanson said the company had received some calls from people smelling gas, and technicians were responding and assessing. He didn’t have further information.</p>
<p>Idaho Power immediately began inspecting its 17 hyrdoelectric plants across Idaho after the earthquakes, spokesman Jordan Rodriguez said. That was the main infrastructure concern, he said. The dams are mostly along the Snake River.</p>
<p>“We have completed onsite inspections at each of our power plants and found no damage,” Rodriguez texted Tuesday night. “In addition, no power outages or system problems were reported as a result of the quake.”</p>
<p>The Ada County Sheriff’s Office tweeted a request for people to stop spreading “false online rumors” about damage to Lucky Peak Dam. A message left with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which manages the Lucky Peak Dam and Lake area, wasn’t immediately returned.</p>
<p>Suez Water Idaho also didn’t immediately return a message.</p>
<p>Savannah Brehmer, spokeswoman for Federal Emergency Management Agency region 10, which includes Idaho, Washington, Oregon and Alaska, said you should not attempt to run outside or hide in a doorway during an earthquake.</p>
<p>”Dropping, covering and holding on is the best action to take as soon as you realize an earthquake has hit,” Brehmer said. “That’s what’s going to keep your most precious organs safe from potential injury.”</p>
<p>Reporter Michael Lycklama, Breaking News Editor Jim Keyser and special correspondent Rocky Barker contributed.
