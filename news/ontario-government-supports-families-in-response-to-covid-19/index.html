Ontario Government Supports Families in Response to COVID-19</p>
<p>Province Providing One-time Financial Assistance During School and Child Care Closures</p>
<p>April 6, 2020 1:15 P.M. Office of the Premier</p>
<p>TORONTO — The Ontario government is offering direct financial support to parents while Ontario schools and child care centres remain closed as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>The new Support for Families initiative offers a one-time payment of $200 per child 0 to 12 years of age, and $250 for those 0 to 21 years of age with special needs.</p>
<p>The announcement was made today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During this extraordinary time, we&rsquo;re doing everything we can to support parents to keep everyone safe and ensure our children continue to learn and stay mentally active,&rdquo; said Premier Ford. &ldquo;This one-time funding will allow parents to access additional tools for our kids to use while at home and studying remotely. I want to remind everyone to stay at home and only go out if absolutely necessary. It&rsquo;s the only way we are going to defeat this terrible virus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our aim during these extraordinarily challenging times is to continue supporting those impacted hardest by the COVID-19 outbreak — Ontario families,&rdquo; said Minister Lecce. &ldquo;School and child care closures have disrupted family life a great deal and our government will do whatever it takes to support them and keep them safe. This funding will flow to parents directly, to offer them immediate relief during this difficult time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Families can complete a simple online application at Ontario&rsquo;s Support for Families web page to access this financial support. Parents already receiving Support for Parents payments through direct deposit will be automatically eligible for this financial support and do not need to submit a new application.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we reach a critical juncture in our fight against COVID-19, it&rsquo;s important schools and child care centres remain closed,&rdquo; said Minister Elliott. &ldquo;Keeping Ontarians safe is our number one priority and it&rsquo;s also our duty to help parents who are supporting their children and families during this unprecedented time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through this initiative the government is providing over $300 million in relief to parents across Ontario as part of Ontario&rsquo;s Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With schools and child care closed, life has become more difficult for families and they need some extra help,&rdquo; said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. &ldquo;Ontario&rsquo;s Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19, includes $7 billion in direct support for people and jobs, and $10 billion in cash flow support for people and businesses. This $17 billion plan includes direct relief for parents when they need it the most.&rdquo;

<p><img src="https://www.jpost.com//HttpHandlers/ShowImage.ashx?id=370634&amp;w=822&amp;h=537" alt="img">
The province bought two orders of almost 4 million medical masks from manufacturer 3M Co&rsquo;s plant in South Dakota, and one batch of nearly 3 million was halted, Premier Doug Ford told reporters. Speaking to Global News, he called the incident &ldquo;absolutely unacceptable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ford, a populist conservative, said that after the Ontario and Canadian governments complained, he had been assured 500,000 of the masks would soon be released.</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump signed an order last week to stop personal protective equipment from being exported, and Ford said it was &ldquo;absolutely critical&rdquo; that Canada be exempted.</p>
<p>Ford said he would be calling U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to press home the point.</p>
<p>Ontario, which has the second-highest number of coronavirus cases among the 10 provinces, would run out of personal protective equipment in a week, Ford added. About 14 million people live in Ontario, representing over a third of Canada&rsquo;s population.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke to Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne on Monday and &ldquo;reiterated the U.S. desire&rdquo; to work with Canada to ensure the viability of international supply chains for medical supplies and personnel, a Pompeo spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters that &ldquo;we are working intensely with the United States to ensure that all the masks that have been bought can be exported to Canada.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allies of the United States have complained about what they call its &ldquo;Wild West&rdquo; tactics in outbidding or blocking shipments to buyers who have already signed deals for medical equipment.</p>
<p>Canada&rsquo;s death toll from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, had climbed to 340 by 5 p.m. (2100 GMT) on Monday, from 258 on Sunday, according to a tally of provincial announcements compiled by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. The number of cases rose to 16,568 from 14,426.</p>
<p>In a sign of the economic challenge, officials said a total of 3.18 million people in Canada had filed unemployment claims since March 16, including for an emergency benefit that launched on Monday.</p>
<p>Industry groups and tenants said landlords should brace for rent strikes in May unless the government steps in with rental subsidies for occupants as the outbreak decimates wages.</p>
<p>Ontario, the most-populous province in Canada, complained on Monday the United States had blocked the export of more than 3 million face masks it bought to fight the coronavirus outbreak, while Ottawa said it was pressuring Washington to release the gear.

Ontario Takes Steps to Keep Food on the Table during COVID-19</p>
<p>New online portal connects employers with workers looking to make a difference</p>
<p>April 4, 2020 1:00 P.M. Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs</p>
<p>TORONTO - In order to ensure grocery store shelves remain full and families have food on the table during the COVID-19 outbreak, the Government of Ontario is launching a new web portal, connecting workers with employers looking to fill positions in the agri-food sector. This new online tool will make it easier to match people to essential jobs and training resources throughout the provincial food supply chain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right now, there are important jobs that need to be filled across the food supply chain and we are looking for individuals who embody the Ontario spirit to step up and provide an essential service,&rdquo; said Ernie Hardeman, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. &ldquo;From farm to fork, it&rsquo;s these dedicated heroes in the agri-food sector who are working through this difficult period each and every day to keep food on our kitchen tables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ontario&rsquo;s agriculture and food industry relies on hundreds of thousands of people to work in diverse jobs from farming and food processing to transport and food retail, and the need for workers in many other parts of the food system remains strong. Ontario.ca/AgFoodJobs provides access to information on job opportunities and training resources in all parts of Ontario&rsquo;s food supply chain - from grocery retailers to bakeries and cheese processing plants to opportunities on farms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Working in the agri-food sector is a great way to contribute to your community and join the thousands of hard-working men and women helping to feed the province during this unprecedented time,&rdquo; said Minister Hardeman. &ldquo;Our food supply chain is one of the strongest in the world and our government wants to thank all of the people who work everyday to ensure individuals and families can access healthy and nutritious Ontario-produced foods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quick Facts Ontario’s agri-food sector is comprised of primary agriculture, food, beverage and wholesale, and retail and food services.</p>
<p>In 2018, Ontario&rsquo;s agri-food industry employed more than 837,000 people, representing 11.6 per cent of the province’s labour force and contributed $47.7 billion in GDP to the provincial economy (6.6 per cent of total Ontario GDP).
