Club Penguin has been rebooted and it already has 6 million users</p>
<p>Club penguins has been rebooted. Picture: Club Penguins</p>
<p>Childhood game Club Penguin has been resurrected after it was shut down in 2017.</p>
<p>If you used to spend your evenings playing online games in the noughties, you might remember Club Penguin.</p>
<p>Set up in 2005, kids everywhere would fire up their Windows XP computers and sign into the online community set in a virtual winter world full of penguins.</p>
<p>But while the game was taken down in 2017 due to a decline in popularity, now ‚ÄòClub Penguins Online‚Äô has been rebooted to help cure people&rsquo;s self-isolation boredom.</p>

<p>What‚Äôs more, the new version seemingly has all the same features and membership is also totally free, with the creators choosing to ditch the old ¬£2.99 fee.</p>
<p>And it looks as though the game is already proving very popular, as over six million people have already signed up to play following its launch last month.</p>
<p>In fact, the creators announced the huge increase of users over the past few weeks has meant they‚Äôve had to update the servers to stop the game running slowly.</p>
<p>Many fans of the game are even using it to host parties and graduations that they‚Äôve had to cancel due to coronavirus.</p>
<p>One excited person wrote on Twitter: ‚ÄúWow. It took a pandemic to bring club penguin back.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúCLUB PENGUIN IS BACK!!,‚Äù said a second, while a third added: ‚Äúif you miss me , imma be on club penguin.‚Äù</p>

Studies say that nostalgia has powerful benefits during times like these.</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.insider.com/5e825d6d487c2264234c6d14?width=1200&amp;format=jpeg" alt="img">
I used to be an avid player of Club Penguin, an online game where you create a penguin avatar, more than a decade ago.</p>
<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been drawn back into the game ‚Äî and while playing I was the happiest I&rsquo;ve been in weeks.</p>
<p>Research says we turn to nostalgia during times of instability, and it can help us find a sense of meaning ‚Äî and buffer us from the things that scare us.</p>
<p>Visit Business Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>This weekend, I spent over six hours doing something I hadn&rsquo;t done since 2009: I logged onto Club Penguin.</p>
<p>Well, to be clear, I logged onto Club Penguin Rewritten, a version of the game lovingly recreated from old game files; the actual Club Penguin shut down in 2017.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a writer and editor in the thick of coronavirus coverage. Every weekday morning I start my day by updating Business Insider&rsquo;s running list of countries on lockdown ‚Äî a task that includes updating the death tolls. They climb unimaginably higher every 24 hours.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an important list to update, and I know it&rsquo;s informing people around the world. I don&rsquo;t consider myself to be on the frontlines of coronavirus by any stretch ‚Äî I&rsquo;m just writing out words and numbers while our extraordinary healthcare workers are trying to save human beings each and every day. But it&rsquo;s still been taking its toll on me.</p>
<p>I also have anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>While experts recommend unplugging as one way to reduce anxieties, that&rsquo;s just not really possible in my job, the whole point of which is always staying plugged in, to better inform the public. I go to bed exhausted and drained most days, then usually dream about how much I want to go outside.</p>
<p>But over the weekend I felt a deep urge. And that was to investigate this new Club Penguin. In Club Penguin, your main (and only) objective is to build a life as a pastel-colored penguin. You can play simple, somewhat repetitive games to earn coins, and the coins can be used to buy clothes for your penguin, buy furniture for your igloo, or to adopt puffles ‚Äî basically pet pom-poms. Sometimes there&rsquo;s a dance party.</p>
<p>Perhaps my desire to create a new purple penguin was due to the power that nostalgia has ‚Äî research shows that we are likelier to feel nostalgic during times of instability, and this period could serve as the dictionary definition of unstable. It could be that Club Penguin reminded me of a happier and simpler time sitting in the living room of my childhood home ‚Äî one where I could go outside and had never heard of Twitter.</p>
<p>All I know is that the happiest I&rsquo;ve been in weeks was while playing Club Penguin. I grinned the whole time. Yes, I even dreamed about it.</p>
<p>Why am I so enamored with this game again? There could be something a little deeper at play: Research shows that nostalgia can help us find meaning. Not only does it increase our sense of social connection, but it actually acts as a buffer for the scary thoughts that each of us probably encounters on a daily basis these days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In particular, [nostalgia] shields against meaning threat, and buffers the impact of mortality salience on meaning, collective identity, accessibility of mortality-related thoughts, and death anxiety,&rdquo; psychologists Constantine Sedikides and Tim Wildschut conclude in &ldquo;Finding Meaning in Nostalgia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other words, retreating into Club Penguin for hours was probably a fairly healthy way to cope with my fears about the virus and the impact it could have on myself and those that I love.</p>
<p>Playing a game that I loved a decade ago also helped me establish what Sedikides and Wildschut call &ldquo;self-continuity&rdquo; ‚Äî I felt connected to a past sense of myself, and was able to build a mental connection between the child I was and the currently confined adult I am. It helps me place myself in time, and know that this is simply yet another period that I will look back on in 10 years.</p>
<p>But one of the best parts of Club Penguin was that it was, at its peak, a kid&rsquo;s corner of the late, great, wild Internet ‚Äî all you had to do was make a username and a penguin. It didn&rsquo;t require linking to Facebook, nor could it follow you to a job. It was an anonymous land of brightly colored penguins ‚Äî and so is Club Penguin Rewritten.</p>
<p>In a time of what feels like ultra-regulation ‚Äî I can&rsquo;t even walk down the street as I usually would ‚Äî the PG anarchy of Club Penguin felt deeply reassuring. Everyone in the real world may be stuck at home, but the penguins are out there like we&rsquo;d like to be, sledding and dancing.</p>
<p>So, while it&rsquo;s no substitute for spending time in person with friends, I&rsquo;ll be playing hide and seek with my new cohort on Club Penguin for the foreseeable future. After all, with a little nostalgia, you can go wherever you want.

<h3 id="opinion-satire-online-graduation-should-be-on-club-penguin">Opinion: Satire: Online graduation should be on Club Penguin</h3>
<p><img src="https://dailyevergreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/graduation-900x616.png" alt="img">
Use online video games to make pain of a cancelled graduation go away</p>
<p>WSU needs to think about all of the ways online graduation could work</p>
<p>With the coronavirus shutting down universities all over the country, many have had to find alternate means to carry on business. While I‚Äôm a big fan of Zoom classes, because I don‚Äôt have to put on pants, many other things are not as easily transferred online. For example, college sports have been postponed, leaving athletes stranded.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYeah, we thought about putting two of our wrestlers in these experimental VR suits we got from the Department of Defense, and making them play ‚ÄòMortal Kombat‚Äô in virtual reality,‚Äù said WSU wrestling coach Tarya Hedoff. Hedoff has been strategizing with other staff on how to provide alternative sports for students.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut when one of our guys came out with his spine snapped in half and one of them came out frozen into a block of ice, we figured we‚Äôd cut our losses,‚Äù Hedoff said.</p>
<p>Graduation has been another point of contention among WSU staff and students. How do you transfer something online that is, by its very nature, deeply personal?</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe tried a test run of a Minecraft graduation,‚Äù said WSU President Bill Edrock. ‚ÄúPlayers kept blowing up the stage, and some 12-year-old in voice chat called me a ‚Äòsh-t eating p-ssbaby‚Äô for not having diamond armor. Serves us right for making a public server, I suppose.‚Äù</p>
<p>Students everywhere have taken up arms to protest the school‚Äôs mishandling of the graduation fiasco.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey haven‚Äôt told us what it is, where it is, what school I go to, what my major is,‚Äù said seventh-year business major Ira Te. ‚ÄúMan, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm living in communist Vietnam, dude.‚Äù</p>
<p>When informed Vietnam was not a communist country, Te stared at the wall for a solid 10 minutes, and then left the interview room.</p>
<p>Members of the WSU elite have offered their services for alternate graduation locations, including the son of a rich English landowner, attending WSU on a Fulbright scholarship.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy father, Sir Edward Wesleyberg, the Lord of the Isle of Wight, offers to fly the graduating class to his private South Pacific island,‚Äù said Edmund Wesleyberg, a junior philosophy major. ‚ÄúThere will be ceremonies, feasting and games ‚Ä¶ the most dangerous game! Ahaha! Hahaha! And may the most cruel, the most vicious, the most violent of all the seniors take their place as WSU‚Äôs victor!‚Äù</p>
<p>Wesleyberg continued to monologue for about 30 minutes, none of which is printable here, due to the high volume of antiquated racism, and threats to the ‚Äúfilthy Irish.‚Äù</p>
<p>Succinctly, Wesleyberg‚Äôs potential cover for an island-based manhunt was struck down by both administration and students, due to its ‚Äúhigh cost‚Äù and ‚Äúgeneral weird vibe.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt hunt students anymore,‚Äù Edrock said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just not cost-effective.‚Äù</p>
<p>Regardless of student complaints and admin ineptitude, a player from the past has stepped up to fill in the gap and pick up the slack. A Serbian company, Online Having Fun Zone, has purchased the late 2000s website for kids, ‚ÄúClub Penguin,‚Äù and retrofitted it to allow massive amounts of players to attend their school‚Äôs graduation.</p>
<p>Online Having Fun Zone, a post-Balkans war slush fund, acquired the Club Penguin domain name for $100 in February of 2020. The company‚Äôs CEO, Wojakslaw Milovanovic, an Eastern European financial guru, said his decision was motivated by the coronavirus‚Äôs impact on in-person activities.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYes, is massive good business decision,‚Äù Milovanovic said. ‚Äúclubpenguin.com is no longer use, we buy URL and make big ton of money! Big time American man, ‚ÄòWolf Of Wall Street‚Äô, yes!‚Äù</p>
<p>In a post-modern world, we require post-modern solutions. So, class of 2020, grab your laptops and your mortarboards, because it‚Äôs time for Graduating Class Penguin.</p>
