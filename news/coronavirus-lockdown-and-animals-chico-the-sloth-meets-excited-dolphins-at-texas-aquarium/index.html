<p>The coronavirus lockdown has resulted in an unexpectedly happy meeting at a US aquarium.</p>
<p>Three-year-old Chico the sloth got to meet many species during a tour of Texas State Aquarium, but by far the best reaction came from the dolphins, who seemed over-the -moon by their furry visitor.</p>
<p>They even seemed to imitate Chico&rsquo;s upside-down appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Liko and Schooner were very curious, and Liko was even inspired to attempt an upside-down sloth impression!&rdquo; the aquarium said on Facebook.</p>
<p>It is not the first time that animals have been brought on a tour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We frequently give the animals a chance to &lsquo;meet&rsquo; each other as a form of enrichment,&rdquo; the aquarium said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As some of our most popular animals, it seemed an obvious choice for our sloths and dolphins to get a chance to see each other while we were temporarily closed,&rdquo; reported Bored Panda.</p>
<p>Just last month, staff at the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago decided to let a few waddling residents out of their enclosures for a field trip.</p>
<p>Some of the penguins went on a field trip to meet other animals at Shedd. Wellington seemed most interested in the fishes in Amazon Rising! The black-barred silver dollars also seemed interested in their unusual visitor.</p>
<p>The aquarium shared videos on Twitter of three penguins checking out exhibits from the other side of the glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without guests in the building, caretakers are getting creative in how they provide enrichment to animals,&rdquo; the aquarium said in a statement. &ldquo;Introducing new experiences, activities, foods and more to keep them active, encourage them to explore, problem-solve and express natural behaviours.&rdquo;</p>

<p><img src="https://ticotimes.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Oatmeal-Electrocution-Survivor-700x467.jpg" alt="img">
Toucan Rescue Ranch has made a huge sustainable improvement moving into 2020: going solar!</p>
<p>The Toucan Rescue Ranch has been working with a company called Avolta, whose professionals have experience installing more than 10 Megawatts of power generation capacity across large-scale, industrial, commercial, institutional and residential projects. They use solutions built around world-class German technology, and Avolta is part-owned by the Demain Foundation in the United States. With Toucan Rescue Ranch’s set-up, the system has 36 panels totaling a capacity of 11.7 kW!</p>
<p>The inspiration behind TRR going solar is simple: become a leader in sustainable energy while saving lives. Electric power lines are one of the main drivers of injury for canopy dwelling wildlife. Annually, the Toucan Rescue Ranch receives dozens of animals who suffer from critical third-degree burns from using dangerous, live power lines as a means of crossing fragmented habitat. Too often, this results in sloths, monkeys, and other wildlife suffering injuries that require serious procedures, such as cell regenerative treatment, and sometimes amputation of necrotic limbs.</p>
<p>As ambassadors for wildlife, Toucan Rescue Ranch wanted to make a change that impacted not only the animals we rescue but also allows for a greener 2020. This is why we have coined the expression, “Save a sloth, go solar.” This tagline goes beyond just sloths but applies to all of the incredible wildlife that is injured due to unsafe manmade infrastructures, such as transformers and power lines.</p>
<p>By going solar, the center can look forward to a future that will reduce its impact on the environment by lowering its consumption of nonrenewable energy. TRR will be able to lessen its energy bill, which will result in the reallocation of funds to help more animals for decades to come!</p>
<p>We are so excited about this improvement! We hope you get a little inspired and look into taking steps to #saveaslothgosolar!</p>

Texas State Aquarium</p>
<p>The Texas State Aquarium is currently closed to the public due to social distancing requirements, but that hasn&rsquo;t stopped the animals inside from hanging out with new friends.</p>
<p>Texas State Aquarium staff have apparently been giving some animals a chance to explore parts of the aquarium and meet other creatures in different habitats. When a celebrity sloth named Chico got to meet some new dolphin buddies, the dolphins appeared to love the playdate.</p>
<p>The 3-year-old sloth took a break from his usual enclosure when the staff took him on a tour around the Gulf of Mexico exhibit, which included meeting ducks, seahorses and jellyfish. Because roaming around on his own would have been difficult, staff carried him around hanging by a large branch.</p>
<p>The highlight of the trip seemed to be when the dolphins met Chico. &ldquo;Liko and Schooner were very curious, and Liko was even inspired to attempt an upside-down sloth impression,&rdquo; the aquarium posted on Facebook.</p>
<p>With the Aquarium temporarily closed, Chico the sloth had the opportunity for an up-close and personal meeting with some&hellip; Posted by Texas State Aquarium on Thursday, March 26, 2020</p>
<p>The aquarium frequently give its animals a chance to &ldquo;meet&rdquo; each other as a form of enrichment &ldquo;which helps keep them active in body and mind,&rdquo; a Texas State Aquarium spokesperson told the Bored Panda blog on Thursday. &ldquo;As some of our most popular animals, it seemed an obvious choice for our sloths and dolphins to get a chance to see each other while we were temporarily closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sloths and dolphins aren&rsquo;t the only animals having fun during aquarium lockdowns. In March, a group of curious penguins roamed Chicago&rsquo;s Shedd Aquarium to visit other animals and tour the exhibits.
