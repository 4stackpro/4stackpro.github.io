Amazon has decided to shut down all of its fulfillment centers in France after a French court ruled the company could be fined €1 million per item for shipping anything not directly related to medical supplies, hygiene products, and food items. The company, which plans to appeal the ruling, says that at the moment the “risk [is] too high” that it will run afoul of the ruling due to complexities in its warehouse operations. The shutdown will last from at least April 16th to April 20th. Reuters originally published the news on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>“Following the judgement of a French court on Tuesday, we have to temporarily suspend operations in our Fulfilment Centres in France. This is in spite of the huge investment we made in additional safety measures to keep our hard-working, dedicated colleagues safe, while ensuring they had continued employment at this difficult time,” an Amazon spokesperson tells The Verge in statement. “Our FC operations are complex and varied, and with the punitive 1M euro per incident fines imposed by the court, the risk was too high. We remain perplexed by the court’s decision, which was made in spite of the overwhelming evidence we provided about the safety measures we have implemented, and have launched an appeal.”</p>
<p>“with the punitive 1M euro per incident fines imposed by the court, the risk was too high”</p>
<p>Amazon has come under fire both in the US and overseas for its handling of health and safety concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. The health crisis has only made the e-commerce giant’s services more vital as people shelter at home and rely more on online ordering and delivery of household goods, food, and other items. But more than 50 Amazon-owned facilities have confirmed COVID-19 cases, according to the Financial Times, and the company is now building its own testing lab to try to keep its operations running amid panic surrounding the virus’s rapid spread through its warehouses.</p>
<p>Throughout the crisis, Amazon has been criticized by workers, activists, and politicians for not properly communicating to warehouse workers when a co-worker has been diagnosed with the illness and for not taking enough precautionary measures to prevent the illness from spreading by closing down facilities and deep cleaning them. In some cases, Amazon workers say they only hear about a COVID-19 diagnosis from co-workers, and in Kentucky, the governor ordered Amazon to keep its returns facility closed after numerous confirmed cases among the workforce.</p>
<p>According to Amazon, the Kentucky warehouse reopened on April 1st. The company provided this statement to The Verge regarding its measures to ensure employee health and safety:</p>
<p>Nothing is more important than the health and safety of our teams. Since the early days of this situation, we have worked closely with health authorities to proactively respond, ensuring we continue to serve people while taking care of our associates and teams. We have also implemented proactive measures at our facilities to protect employees, including mandatory social distancing, adding distance between drivers and people in the community when making deliveries, and providing masks for everyone to use, as we remain committed to keeping our teams healthy and safe.</p>
<p>In one particularly high-profile controversy, Amazon also fired a warehouse worker in New York City who organized a protest against the company’s handling of health and safety issues related to COVID-19. The situation, in which Amazon claimed the worker violated the company’s self-isolation guidelines to attend the protest, drew the attention of Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and accusations of retaliation. It was later discovered Amazon executives internally discussed how to smear the organizer in the media.</p>
<p>In France, the Union Syndicale Solidaires trade union filed complaints pushing for more oversight of Amazon’s handling of health issues during the pandemic and calling for the closure of facilities due to overcrowding. Amazon now says it is asking its fulfillment center workers to stay home. Amazon employs about 10,000 people in warehouses in France, according to Reuters.</p>
<p>“In the mean-time, we are working through what this court’s decision means for them and our French operation,” the statement reads. “While we will do our best to minimize the impact on French small businesses, those who depend on our FC network to deliver their products will be negatively impacted by this ruling.”</p>
<p>Amazon says it will continue to serve French customers using its Marketplace sellers and “robust global fulfillment network.” However, it’s not clear if that means French customers will have to order from Marketplace sellers outside the country and have those products shipped in without routing through a warehouse, or if French Marketplace sellers will be able to ship the items directly or through an Amazon partner.</p>
<p>Update April 15th, 5:05PM ET: Added additional comment from Amazon regarding its measures to protect employees during COVID-19.

<h3 id="south-africa-flattens-its-coronavirus-curveand-considers-how-to-ease-restrictions">South Africa flattens its coronavirus curve—and considers how to ease restrictions</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/southafrica_1280p_0.jpg?itok=UcZYr9b5" alt="img">
South Africa flattens its coronavirus curve—and considers how to ease restrictions</p>
<p>Science ’s COVID-19 reporting is supported by the Pulitzer Center.</p>
<p>With South Africa in its third week of a COVID-19 lockdown that will last at least through April, scientists advising the government gave a preview of the next phase of the response in a televised address on Monday evening. They offered “a glimpse at the science behind the decision-making,” Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize said during the briefing—and a road map for reopening the country.</p>
<p>South Africa detected its first novel coronavirus infection on 5 March. For the next few weeks, the epidemic followed an exponential curve similar to those in the United Kingdom, the United States, and many other countries. On 15 March, the country’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, declared a national state of emergency banning visitors from high-risk countries, stopping large gatherings, closing more than half of its land borders, and shutting schools. On 27 March the country started a 21-day lockdown, closing all borders and confining everyone except those performing essential services to their homes except to buy groceries and medicine or to collect welfare payments.</p>
<p>Based on other countries’ trajectories, disease modelers expected total cases to rise to 4000 by 2 April even with social distancing measures—but after the lockdown, the daily increase in cases slowed abruptly, and the number has remained more or less constant at about 70 new cases daily. On 14 April, the country had 2415 confirmed cases and 27 deaths.</p>
<p>Some people have wondered whether the slowdown in new cases is a result of less testing as the epidemic has moved into poorer areas. However, HIV scientist Salim Abdool Karim, who chairs Mkhize’s COVID-19 advisory group, said at the briefing that the slowdown in new cases actually coincided with increased testing in poorer communities.</p>
<p>Instead, he said, it’s likely that the country’s border closures, social distancing measures, and eventual lockdown worked to slow the spread of the virus. “We can’t say it definitively, but we can say it’s likely,” he said.</p>
<p>However, Abdool Karim had some bad news, too. It is “very, very unlikely,” he said, that the country will avoid a future surge in cases. The added weeks in lockdown were needed to help decision-makers decide on the way forward. “The lockdown has bought us some time to become more proactive,” he said.</p>
<p>The country is using that time to prepare by sending tens of thousands of community health care workers into villages and towns to screen people and refer those with symptoms for testing. By catching small community outbreaks and isolating cases, the South African response hopes to stop small flare-ups from turning into large wildfires of infection.</p>
<p>The country is also erecting field hospitals and expanding its capacity for burials, Abdool Karim said. In the future, South Africa plans randomized screenings in hospitals, schools, and companies to further gauge the community spread of the virus.</p>
<p>A drop in case numbers After South Africa instituted a lockdown on 27 March, its new COVID-19 cases fell quickly and have remained relatively low. 6 Mar. 11 Mar. 16 Mar. 21 Mar. 26 Mar. 1 Apr. 6 Apr. 11 Apr. 0 63 125 188 250 Daily change in positive cases 0 63 125 188 Data: abcdefg hijkl mnop qrstu vwxyz 1234 56789</p>
<p>Once new cases decline from one week to the next, South Africa will lift the lockdown in carefully considered stages, Abdool Karim said. It might start by unlocking transport hubs in low-transmission areas and asking vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with impaired immune systems to continue to stay home—possibly until there are vaccines or treatments. “If we end the lockdown abruptly, we may undo the benefit we’ve achieved,” he said.</p>
<p>Many other sub-Saharan African nations are also wrestling with how to move on from closing their borders and confining their populations to their homes. “Countries in the region will probably take the good pieces from the South African experience, plus good pieces from elsewhere to craft their own response,” Catherine Kyobutungi, executive director of the African Population and Health Research Center, a nonprofit organization in Nairobi, Kenya, told Science Insider.</p>
<p>Wafaa El-Sadr, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, says South Africa’s “energetic and evidence-based” response to COVID-19 “starkly contrasts” with the country’s early halting response to its HIV epidemic in the late 1990s and 2000s, which saw the government obstructing treatment rollout and denying the connection between HIV and AIDS.</p>
<p>But, she says, vigilance will be needed not just to keep an eye on the epidemic, but also to monitor the impact of the lockdown measures on the social and economic well-being of the population, particularly in areas where many people already live hand-to-mouth. “This is the challenge that South Africa and other countries face today.”

<h3 id="coronavirus-stimulus-checks-new-irs-tool-tracks-your-payment--but-its-down-for-many">Coronavirus stimulus checks: New IRS tool tracks your payment — but it&rsquo;s down for many</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/e2GQiteKrIKkPd4D7U6hQQ--~B/aD0xMzk4O3c9MjkxNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/1c3f11e0-7f2e-11ea-b666-598ebb595f6b" alt="img">
While 80 million Americans have received stimulus checks, those still waiting can now track the payment on the Internal Revenue Service website.</p>
<p>If it works for them.</p>

<p>“The free ‘Get My Payment App’ will allow Americans who do not have their direct deposit information on file with the IRS to input it, track the status, and get their money fast,” Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.</p>
<p>However, on Wednesday morning, the tool apparently wasn’t working for some. Several Yahoo Finance reporters received a “Payment Status Not Available” response when they entered their information. Others on Twitter reported a similar result.</p>

<p>About 175 million Americans are eligible for the stimulus payments, according to the White House. Mnuchin stated on Wednesday morning that &ldquo;more than 80 million Americans have already received their Economic Impact Payments by direct deposit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new tool allows Americans to follow the scheduled payment date for either a direct deposit or mailed check. It’s an online app that works on desktops, phones, or tablets and doesn’t need to be downloaded from an app store, The Treasury said.</p>
<p>To track your payment, you must provide basic information including:</p>
<p>Social Security number</p>
<p>Date of birth</p>
<p>Mailing address</p>
<p>The tool also lets people provide their bank account details to get their payment by direct deposit instead of waiting for a mailed check, which go out April 24.</p>

<p>If you filed a tax return in 2018 or 2019 but didn’t provide direct deposit information, you’ll be able to identify yourself, input that banking information, and receive the payment in several days in your account, according to Mnuchin.</p>
<p>To add direct deposit information, you will need to provide:</p>
<p>Adjusted gross income from your most recent tax return submitted, either 2019 or 2018</p>
<p>The refund or amount owed from your latest filed tax return</p>
<p>Bank account type, account, and routing numbers</p>

<p>As part of a $2 trillion coronavirus relief package, many Americans will get government checks up to $1,200 — plus $500 per child — to help them ride out a job loss, reduced work hours, and other money challenges as the country tries to stem the pandemic.</p>
<p>But some Americans could see a delay for their paper checks after the Treasury Department ordered that President Donald Trump’s name to be included on the printed checks.</p>
<p>Here’s everything you need to know about the stimulus check.</p>
<p>Who gets a stimulus check?</p>
<p>“Our updated estimate is that 93.6 percent of [tax] filers will have a rebate,” said Garrett Watson, senior policy analyst at The Tax Foundation. “And this works out to approximately 140 million households.”</p>
<p>Your eligibility is based on your most recent tax return and your adjusted gross income. If you already filed your 2019 taxes, your eligibility will be based on that. If not, the Internal Revenue Service will use your 2018 taxes to determine if you qualify.</p>
