<p>Liverpool players, staff and supporters have observed a minute&rsquo;s silence to remember fans who lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster.</p>
<p>Ninety-six men, women and children died when a crush developed during the FA Cup semi-final on 15 April 1989.</p>
<p>A final memorial service was due to be held at Anfield on the 31st anniversary of the tragedy but had to be postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The silence was held at precisely 15:06 BST, the time the match was halted.</p>
<p>A date for a full service will be confirmed in the &ldquo;near future&rdquo;, the club said.</p>
<p>Flags at civic buildings in the city were also flown at half mast throughout the day in memory of those who died in the UK&rsquo;s worst sporting disaster.</p>

<p>Speaking in a video published on the club&rsquo;s Twitter account, manager Jurgen Klopp said it was &ldquo;the most significant day for our football club each year&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plan was that we would be together at Anfield today, but this is not possible,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only thing that we can make sure is that we are in each other&rsquo;s thoughts, and believe me you are in our thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have our thoughts, you have our prayers, and most of all you have our love. You&rsquo;ll never walk alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Club captain Jordan Henderson said this year&rsquo;s anniversary was &ldquo;particularly hard&rdquo; for the Hillsborough families.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not one for making speeches, but on behalf of all the players at Liverpool, I just wanted everyone affected to know that you are in our thoughts today,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Margaret Aspinall, who chairs the Hillsborough Family Support Group, earlier called on supporters to &ldquo;join us in our prayers to remember the 96 and keep the families and everyone who has been affected in your thoughts at this difficult time&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hope to provide an update in the near future on a rescheduled date for the service,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The victims&rsquo; families had originally wanted to hold the final memorial service on the 30th anniversary but that coincided with the trial of David Duckenfield.</p>
<p>The former police match commander was cleared of the gross negligence manslaughter following a retrial in November.

<h3 id="hillsborough-epg-votes-to-rescind-curfew-wont-require-masks">Hillsborough EPG Votes to Rescind Curfew, Won&rsquo;t Require Masks</h3>
<p><img src="https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/tampa_masks_417_jpg" alt="img">
TAMPA, Fla. — The Hillsborough County Emergency Policy Group voted 8-0 on Thursday to rescind the newly enacted curfew.</p>
<p>The rules surrounding the curfew - which ran from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. - have confused residents and county commissioners alike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I read it when I got it and I tried to understand it,&rdquo; said Commissioner Pat Kemp. &ldquo;But it is not easy to discern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curfew went into effect Monday night but didn&rsquo;t survive the week.</p>
<p>The group also voted against requiring residents to wear masks and face covers in public settings.</p>
<p>Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said earlier this week that she preferred if residents wore masks in grocery stores or other stores.</p>
<p>School board Member Melissa Snively said the group should work on transparency with public before voting on issues. This comes after backlash on the immediate implementation of the curfew. The group agreed.

<h3 id="hillsborough-superintendent-riled-by-shameful-act">Hillsborough Superintendent Riled By &lsquo;Shameful&rsquo; Act</h3>
<p><img src="https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/web-bf-meals-on-wheels-03182020-1jpg" alt="img">
TAMPA, Fla. — The Hillsborough County Superintendent called it shameful.</p>
<p>School district hands out a week&rsquo;s-worth of meals on Wednesdays</p>
<p>Hillsborough Superintendent said some residents took extra food</p>
<p>School District of Hillsborough County meal information</p>
<p>Addison Davis said some residents took advantage of the district&rsquo;s generosity at the expense of children.</p>
<p>The district started distributing one week&rsquo;s worth of food to families Wednesday, instead of daily meals. Some people apparently took more than they should have. The district moved to a once-weekly distribution instead of daily to minimize contact.</p>
<p>Superintendent Davis said other people even went as far as selling the food on social media.</p>
<p>“It’s a shame that our community members, a few of our community members, would go to multiple sites, take food, away from children and seek to build their financial portfolio on children who did not, will not have the food today,” Davis said. “So we have learners that will go home today and potentially not have the appropriate meals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are 147 sites in Hillborough County where parents can pick up one week&rsquo;s worth of food every Wednesday from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m.</p>
<p>Officials say they&rsquo;re setting up extra measures next week to make sure it doesn’t happen again.
