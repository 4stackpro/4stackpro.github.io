Rupert and Georgia have been dating since 2011 (Picture: Getty)</p>
<p>Rupert Grint and his girlfriend Georgia Groome are expecting their first child together and it was a lot to take in.</p>
<p>The world of Harry Potter and Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging becoming one was something some of us never expected (or even knew about).</p>
<p>Despite the fact the two have been dating for a while, many were still shocked at the news.</p>
<p>What? How? Who? And most importantly, when?</p>
<p>Expecting their first child</p>

<p>The Harry Potter actor’s rep confirmed their exciting baby news in a statement shared with Metro.co.uk.</p>
<p>’Rupert Grint and Georgia Groome are excited to announce they are expecting a baby and would please ask for privacy at this time,’ it read.</p>
<p>And the pregnant actress was then later seen in north London with Rupert, showing off her baby bump.</p>

<p>Boy, do we feel old.</p>
<p>When did they start dating?</p>
<p>Basically a decade, you say? (Picture: Twitter)</p>
<p>The two have been notoriously private about their relationship and fans didn’t even find out they have been dating for a while until long into their relationship.</p>
<p>In December 2018, the world went into a frenzy discovering Rupert and Georgia. have been dating since 2011 after seeing a photo of them on Twitter.</p>
<p>It’s still not confirmed exactly how long the adorable couple have been dating, but almost a decade has passed.</p>
<p>The photo circulated the internet with the caption: ‘I was today years old when I found out Georgia from Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging has been going out with Ron Weasley since 2011?’</p>
<p>Alongside the tweet was a snap of them together, with Georgia’s arm around Rupert.</p>
<p>What have they said about their relationship?</p>
<p>They have known each other since they were young (Picture: McCormack/Knotek/REX/Shutterstock)</p>
<p>Both stars hadn’t said much about their relationship in interviews until Rupert sat down and spoke with The Guardian shortly after turning 30.</p>
<p>He opened up about taking the next step in life and his plans about having a child.</p>
<p>Chatting to the Guardian, he said: ‘Turning 30 felt strange. It just doesn’t feel like I’m there yet and I don’t know what the future holds.</p>
<p>‘I’m just going to go with the flow, keep playing interesting characters and see what happens.’</p>
<p>‘I’d like to settle down and have kids soon.’</p>

<p>Are they married?</p>
<p>The two even sparked wedding rumours (Picture: Alo Ceballos/GC Images)</p>
<p>Rupert and Georgia were spotted walking around Highgate, London, in April 2019 wearing what looked like wedding bands.</p>
<p>The actress sparked rumours that she and the Harry Potter actor had tied the knot in secret after wearing a gold band on her ring finger.</p>
<p>She was enjoying lunch with Rupert and two friends and the ring could be seen glinting away on her left hand.</p>
<p>However, Rupert’s similar band was worn on his right hand, and a rep for the actor denied they had got married.</p>
<p>With how good the duo are at keeping things low-key, we guess we’ll never know.</p>

<p>Harry Potter star Rupert Grint is expecting his first child with actress girlfriend Georgia Groome.</p>
<p>The pair proclaimed their “excitement” as they shared news via a representative on Friday (10 April) and have asked “for privacy”.</p>
<p>The statement reads: “Rupert Grint and Georgia Groome are excited to announce they are expecting a baby and would please ask for privacy at this time.”</p>

<p>The 31-year-old became a household name after being cast as the role of Ron Weasley, wizarding sidekick to Harry Potter in the hugely successful movie franchise which spanned eight films, Grint enjoying a starring role in each.</p>

<p>He played the character between 2001 and 2011, starting as an 11-year-old with next to no acting experience.</p>
<p>Groome, herself a child actress, had starring roles in 2006 crime drama London To Brighton and 2008 teenage dating comedy Angus, Thongs And Perfect Snogging.</p>
<p>The pair have been an item since 2011, though their relationship has largely been kept under wraps.</p>
<p>Grint has discussed fatherhood in the past. He told The Guardian: &ldquo;Turning 30 felt strange. It just doesn’t feel like I’m there yet and I don’t know what the future holds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I’m just going to go with the flow, keep playing interesting characters and see what happens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I’d like to settle down and have kids soon. If I had a son, would I call him Ron?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It’s quite a good name, but probably not. And Grint’s a tough name to pair a one-syllable first name with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While former co-stars Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson have enjoyed Hollywood success since final movie Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows - Part 2, Grint has mainly focussed on television.</p>
<p>His roles include Sky One comedy Sick Note, crime drama Snatch and Agatha Christie adaption The ABC Murders.</p>
<p>His last movie role was 2015 French film Moonwalkers. He also voiced Josh in Postman Pat: The Movie in 2014.
