After just more than a month in a maximum-security prison, Ronaldinho was released and placed into house arrest by Paraguayan authorities on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Brazilian astro was twice denied bail and pleaded to be transferred into house arrest despite reportedly offering $1.6m for his and his brother’s release.</p>

<p>Both Ronaldinho and Roberto de Assis Moreira were taken into custody by Paraguayan police from their presidential suite in a golf club in Paraguay’s capital on 6 March, having allegedly entered the country with fake Paraguayan passports and IDs despite never having begun a process to obtain Paraguay citizenship. Brazilians do not need passports to enter their bordering neighbor to the south west.</p>
<p>Their lawyer maintains that his clients did not know the documents were falsified, as they were given to him by a local sponsor. The two had landed two days earlier to promote Gaucho’s new book, Genius in Life, and a health initiative for underprivileged children in the country. The documents allegedly use the same headshots used to promote the book tour.</p>
<p>Fiscalía Paraguay (@MinPublicoPy) Caso Ronaldinho: Fue allanada la suite donde está hospedado Ronaldinho. Se encontraron, documentos varios, C.I. y pasaportes paraguayos con los nombres de Ronaldinho y su hermano. Investigación en curso. pic.twitter.com/jGO4ZoHNWn</p>
<p>Leaving from Agrupación Especializada, a prison for high-profile criminals which “looks more like a hotel”, according to Paraguay’s home secretary, the De Assis brothers will carry out the rest of their sentence at the Palmaroga Hotel, a luxury hotel back in the city’s center. A room there costs on average $80 to $90 per night, while Ronaldinho’s suite costs $380.</p>
<p>The Brazilian’s case is just one of multiple arrests in a national political money laundering scandal that saw the resignation of Paraguay’s top immigration authority and includes Dalia López Troche, his sponsor in the country, at the center.</p>
<p>As the world of sports news died down due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the media scrutinized every detail of Ronaldinho’s bizarre arrival behind bars. According to the warden, he spent time talking to his mother, drinking mate and coffee and taking up carpentry.</p>
<p>Quickly rumors spread of wether the World Cup and Ballon d’or winner would put his famous left foot to use in custody.</p>
<p>After much speculation, in an intramural league against other inmates, he did. In his first match, it was reported he scored five and assisted six goals. His squad, Negro Cumbiero, won the championship and the purse that came with it, a 16kg pork for barbecuing.</p>
<p>ESPN reported that inmates held a barbecue to celebrate the Barcelona star’s last night in the jail where he turned 40 years old.

Ronaldinho Gaucho leaves the Paraguayan Public Ministry where he testified along with his brother Roberto de Asis on March 5, 2020.</p>
<p>Brazilian World Cup winner Ronaldinho Gaucho will be released from jail into house arrest in Paraguay on Tuesday after he and his brother paid $1.6 million in bail, the judge in his case said.</p>

<p>The former Barcelona, Paris St Germain and AC Milan midfielder, who won the World Cup with Brazil in 2002, was arrested on March 6 with his brother and business manager Roberto Assis.</p>
<p>They were accused of possessing adulterated Paraguayan passports. The brothers&rsquo; lawyer has called their detention &ldquo;arbitrary, abusive and illegal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pair had been previously denied bail but the judge on Tuesday said the investigation carried out in the days since favoured the detainees.</p>
<p>Judge Gustavo Amarilla gave no further details but said there was no reason to keep the pair in custody given their huge bail payment and on the condition they do not leave the country.</p>
<p>The judge relayed his decision to the brothers in a video call and granted them permission to move into the four-star Palmaroga hotel in Asuncion while they awaited their trial.</p>
<p>They are expected to leave prison on Tuesday and they will be allowed to receive visits in the hotel.</p>
<p>The two men deposited $800,000 each as bail into a local bank account on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It’s a significant bail in cash to guarantee they will not flee,&rdquo; Amarilla said.</p>
<p>Although he last played professionally in 2015, Ronaldinho, who also represented Brazilian clubs Gremio, Atletico Mineiro, Flamengo and Fluminense, is still hugely popular with global football fans.</p>
<p>He also won the Champions League with Barcelona in 2006 and was named FIFA world player of the year in 2004 and 2005.</p>

<h3 id="fake-news---messi-makes-furious-double-denial-over-inter-and-ronaldinho-rumours">&lsquo;Fake news!&rsquo; - Messi makes furious double denial over Inter and Ronaldinho rumours</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png" alt="img">
&lsquo;Fake news!&rsquo; - Messi makes furious double denial over Inter and Ronaldinho rumours</p>
<p>The Barcelona forward took exception to reports in Argentina he had paid the Brazilian&rsquo;s bail, and that he would be moving to Serie A this summer</p>
<p>Lionel Messi has used social media to brand a series of stories in the Argentine media - including that he had paid former team-mate Ronaldinho&rsquo;s bail - as &ldquo;fake news&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The star issued the angry denial on Thursday evening after TNT Sports reported that he had put down the money to free the ex-Camp Nou star from prison in .</p>
<p>Ronaldinho and his brother Roberto Assis were released from prison in Paraguay on Tuesday and placed under house arrest after 32 days behind bars. The pair were arrested in early March after allegedly using a false passport to enter the country.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Ronaldinho and Assis have posted a $1.6 million (£1.3m) bail on behalf of their clients, after a previous application was denied because authorities deemed the pair to be a flight risk.</p>
<p>The sudden payment of such a substantial fee has led to speculation as to where the money came from - however, Messi made it clear via his Instagram page that it was nothing to do with him.</p>
<p>He also refuted recent stories linking him with a move away from Barcelona, with being heavily touted as a possible next destination.</p>
<p>Screenshotting a tweet from TNT Sports, Messi wrote &ldquo;#FakeNews&rsquo;&ldquo;and &ldquo;Lie 1: Messi to Inter, Lie 2: Messi gave money to Ronaldinho in jail&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He then added another sentence, which translates as: &ldquo;What they said about Newell&rsquo;s Old Boys a few weeks ago is also false, thank God no one believed them&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Former Inter president Massimo Moratti claimed that a deal for Messi was possible for the Serie A side . He told Radio Rai: “I don’t think it’s a forbidden dream at all. Maybe it wasn’t even before this misfortune [the coronavirus lockdown].</p>
<p>&ldquo;Messi is at the end of his contract and it would certainly be attempted to bring him home. I don’t know if this situation will change anything, but I think we will see strange things at the end of the year.”</p>
<p>Former Inter midfielder Benoit Cauet also insisted the Nerazzurri can sign Messi , while even La Liga president Javier Tebas suggested their biggest name player leaving the league &ldquo;would not be a drama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think that the arrival of Messi can solve the problems of Serie A, which are linked to the bad relationship between debts, high and insufficient collections,&rdquo; Tebas said on a video conference with reporters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serie A&rsquo;s figures are stressed, and these economic problems certainly are not solved by Leo Messi. I would like Messi to stay here, but if he leaves it would not be a drama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, all of this has been strongly denied by Messi, who posted his fierce rebuttal on Instagram to his 147 million followers.
