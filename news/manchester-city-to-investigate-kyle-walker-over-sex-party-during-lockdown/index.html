Manchester City will conduct a disciplinary investigation following reports Kyle Walker broke quarantine rules by hosting a party with two sex workers while the UK remains in lockdown because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Jack Grealish apologises for &lsquo;stupidly&rsquo; ignoring lockdown to visit friend Read more</p>
<p>A report in the Sun said Walker and a friend paid £2,200 for Louise McNamara and a 24-year-old Brazilian woman to visit his home last Tuesday. It was reported the escorts left on Wednesday, the same day the City and England right-back used social media to urge the public to follow government guidelines on social distancing and protect the NHS by staying indoors.</p>
<p>A City spokesman said: “Manchester City are aware of a story in a tabloid newspaper regarding the private life of Kyle Walker in relation to a breach of the UK lockdown and social distancing rules. Footballers are global role models and our staff and players have been working to support the incredible efforts of the NHS and other key workers in fighting the effects of Covid-19, in any way we can.</p>
<p>“Kyle’s actions in this matter have directly contravened these efforts. We are disappointed to hear the allegations, note Kyle’s swift statement and apology, and will be conducting an internal disciplinary procedure.”</p>
<p>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</p>
<p>Walker, who has 48 England caps, said: “I want to take this opportunity to issue a public apology for the choices I made last week. I understand that my position as a professional footballer brings the responsibility of being a role model. As such, I want to apologise to my family, friends, football club, supporters and the public for letting them down.’</p>
<p>Walker is not the first player to step out of line during the lockdown. Aston Villa punished Jack Grealish with a fine that was donated to the University Hospitals Charity in Birmingham after he defied the ban on non-essential travel by going to visit a friend. Grealish apologised after being pictured at the scene of a road accident last Sunday.

Manchester City and England star Kyle Walker has issued an apology after published reports said he hosted a sex party while on lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Walker and a friend apparently paid to have two escorts spend Tuesday with them, with the defender ironically issuing a Wednesday message imploring people to observe quarantine rules.</p>
<p>[ VIDEO: Premier League highlights ]</p>
<p>Here is Walker’s apology, via The Telegraph:</p>
<p>“I want to take this opportunity to issue a public apology for the choices I made last week. I understand that my position as a professional footballer brings the responsibility of being a role model. As such, I want to apologise to my family, friends, football club, supporters and the public for letting them down.”</p>
<p>Man City issued a stinging rebuke of Walker, saying they’ll be conducting an “internal disciplinary procedure.”</p>
<p>“Footballers are global role models and our staff and players have been working to support the incredible efforts of the NHS and other key workers in fighting the effects of the Covid-19 coronavirus, in any way we can. Kyle’s actions in this matter have directly contravened these efforts. We are disappointed to hear the allegations, note Kyle’s swift statement and apology, and will be conducting an internal disciplinary procedure.”</p>
<p>Footballers certainly have not been above reproach during the pandemic, though so many have made positive news via donations or spreading the message of social distancing.</p>
<p>Aston Villa’s Jack Grealish was allegedly involved in a car crash, while curfew-breaking Serbian international Aleksandar Prijovic has been sentenced to three months house detention. Fellow Serbian striker Luka Jovic of Real Madrid was investigated for a similar offense earlier this month.</p>

<p><img src="https://wp-images.onefootball.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/Bayern-Muenchen-v-Tottenham-Hotspur-Group-B-UEFA-Champions-League-1586101594.jpg" alt="img">
Kyle Walker-Peters has revealed that he needed help from parent club Tottenham during the current UK lockdown.</p>
<p>Walker-Peters is currently on loan from Spurs with Southampton but has played just a single Premier League game for the Saints since his deadline day move.</p>
<p>The young defender is back in London for the recent lockdown that the British Government has enforced for the past 10 days’ now.</p>
<p>And the 22-year-old has revealed that he actually had to get Spurs to send him some football to practice with during his period of isolation.</p>
<p>“I did actually contact Tottenham because I didn’t have any footballs at my house,” he told talkSPORT.</p>
<p>“I’m back in my house in London at the moment, and luckily Tottenham brought me over some balls.”
