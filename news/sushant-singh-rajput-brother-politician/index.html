<p>Sushant Singh Rajput was found hanging on June 14, 2020</p>
<p>Key Highlights PM Narendra Modi on Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s death: Gone too soon Sushant Singh Rajput was found hanging at his Bandra apartment The late Bollywood actor last appeared in Nitesh Tiwari&rsquo;s 2019 film &lsquo;Chhichhore&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mumbai: Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his Bandra apartment in Mumbai on June 14, Sunday. The post-mortem has been completed at Dr RN Cooper Municipal General Hospital and the autopsy report conducted by a team of three doctors has said that the provisional cause of death was asphyxia which was caused due to hanging. The provisional post mortem report has been given to the Bandra Police Station. Earlier, the organs of Sushant Singh were sent to JJ Hospital for analysis to check any poisonous substance in the organs.</p>
<p>The last rites of the deceased actor will be performed after his father and other family members arrive in Mumbai from Patna today.</p>
<p>The actor, who was last seen in Nitesh Tiwari&rsquo;s 2019 film ‘Chhichhore’, was reportedly suffering from depression and was undergoing treatment for the last 5-6 months at a private hospital in Mumbai. Some reports also said that anti-depressant pills were recovered from his house.</p>
<p>His death sent shockwaves not only across the Hindi film industry but also amongst the political fraternity. He will be best remembered for his lead roles in &lsquo;Kai Po Che!', &lsquo;MS Dhoni: The Untold Story&rsquo; and &lsquo;Chhichhore&rsquo;</p>
<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed grief and offered condolences to late Bollywood actor&rsquo;s family. “He excelled on TV and in films. His rise in the world of entertainment inspired many and he leaves behind several memorable performances. Shocked by his passing away. My thoughts are with his family and fans. Om Shanti,&rdquo; the prime minister said on Twitter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the deceased actor&rsquo;s brother-in-law OP Singh, who is the Additional Director General of Police and posted as Special Officer in the Haryana Chief Minister&rsquo;s Office, suspected some foul play in the crime, IANS reported.</p>
<p>Earlier on Sunday, Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s maternal uncle alleged that the actor was murdered and urged PM Modi and Union Home Minister Amit hah to initiate a CBI probe.</p>
<p>Expressive shock over Rajput&rsquo;s alleged suicide, many Bollywood celebrities like Anil Kapoor, Karan Johar, Deepika Padukone, Anushka Sharma, Zoya Akhtar, stressed on mental health care for those facing troubled times.</p>
<p>While saying that the actor&rsquo;s death is a &lsquo;huge wake-up call&rsquo; for him, Johar said, &ldquo;Sushant&rsquo;s unfortunate demise has been a huge wake up call to me to my level of compassion and to my ability to foster and protect my equations. I hope this resonates with all of you as well&hellip; will miss your infectious smile and your bear hug.&rdquo;

<h3 id="two-minor-hindu-girls-abducted-by-brother-of-a-politician-in-pakistan">&ldquo;Two minor Hindu girls abducted by brother of a politician in Pakistan&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pakistan-sindh-hindu-girls-abducted-25042020.jpg?fit=700%2C387&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
In yet another incident of abduction and forced conversion of girls belonging to the minority community in Pakistan, two Hindu girls, Suthi and Shama were forcibly abducted from Chundiko town of Sindh.</p>
<p>It has been alleged that two minor Hindu girls have been abducted by the brother of an influential local politician in Sindh province, and the family of the girls have alleged that they are facing constant threats. In a video, the victims’ family said that their minor daughters Suthi and Shama were forcibly abducted by the brother of Pir Faisal Shah Jeelani, a member of the National Assembly.</p>
<p>A family member said that Hindu minorities continue to face persecution in Sindh and they fear that girls will be converted to Islam. He said: “Minorities here are facing persecution. They have abducted our daughters. We are not getting justice and are continuously facing atrocities. The brother of a Member of National Assembly (MNA) Pir Fasil Shah Jeelani threatens more abduction if we complain about it. Hindu minorities are facing threats. We can’t face this torture and would like to move out of Sindh”.</p>
<p>The family also said that police are not helping the victims but deliberately not taking any action due to the influence of the politician.</p>
<p>The family said that when they went to court in connection with the case, Suthi was in the vehicle of Pir Faisal Shah Jeelani, and they didn’t let them meet the girl. They said that the girl was crying, and they don’t even know where the other girl Shama is. The family also alleged that the police is taking the side of the abductors, and have refused to file any FIR.</p>
<p>“They are forcefully converting our daughters and are threatening us to not voice up or else the consequences will cost more Hindu daughters. We demand the state to protect us or throw us out of Pakistan because we can’t afford our more daughters, we just can’t take this pain anymore. Police is also with them. SHO Thari Mir is also supporting them. He didn’t collaborate with us. They blackmailed us and took us to Khairpur court with two police cars and 2-3 cars of Pirs, but our daughter wasn’t there then they took us to Gambhat court where they didn’t let us meet our daughter and said now you leave this place as soon as possible even when the girl was crying. Our daughter wasn’t in Police custody. She was with Pir Shah, and we don’t even know where our other daughter Shama is. SHO isn’t lodging FIR. He is misbehaving and misguiding us” said Suthi’s father.</p>
<p>“I went to court. My daughter was helplessly crying outside the court in the custody of Pir Hussain. They didn’t let us meet with her…,” Suthi’s mother said before she started crying in the video.</p>
<p>“Our two daughters are taken by Dhareja. Police are also with them. They are fully supporting them. We are poor. We don’t have money to raise our voice. We are being threatened. Our one daughter was brought to the court where they didn’t let us meet our daughter while she was crying and we have no clue of our other daughter. Throw us out of Pakistan but please don’t do such atrocity,” an uncle of the girls said.</p>
<p>The World Sindhi Congress has condemned the abduction and forceful conversion of two Hindu minor girls in the Sindh province of Pakistan. Rubina Greenwood, the Chairperson of World Sindhi Congress said that it is heart-wrenching to see the brutalities especially on the minorities of Pakistan. Rubina informed, “Whereabouts of Shama are unknown and the local police have refused to register the complaint. Fourteen-year-old Suthi was produced in the court and was declared Muslim and married to a 40-year old man.”</p>
<p>She added, “The parents of the minor were crying and when the girl was produced in the court, she was also crying. They said that everyone, police, judiciary, politicians are supporting the perpetrators. They are simply helpless. They requested to allow them to migrate to save their daughters.”</p>
<p>Although the WSC has been raising the issue on the several international platforms consistently for the last many years, the situation on the ground has worsened. No mercy has been shown to the minority section of the theocratic nation.</p>
<p>Rubina Greenwood said that it is a matter of international attention and calls for international pressure on the Pakistani government to provide protection to vulnerable Sindhi Hindus and their family. She repeated that we genuinely believe that this is a systematic policy of the state to victimize Sindhi Hindus forcing them to leave their motherland and tear down the secular and civil fabric of Sindhi society.</p>
<p>Rubina demanded the Pakistan government that the policies to persecute Sindhi Hindus should be halted, the women from minority community should be allowed to live according to their choices without any force, fear and perpetrators should be prosecuted.</p>
<p>Concluding her statement she said that she will continue to raise the issue on relevant international platforms to force Pakistan to stop persecution against the minorities.

<p><img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2020-04/ag8c6id8_2-hindu-girls-abducted-in-pak650_625x300_24_April_20.jpg" alt="img">
These incidents are reportedly happening without the consent of the girls&rsquo; family.</p>
<p>At a time when the world is fighting against deadly COVID-19, minority Hindus in Pakistan continue to face religious persecution.</p>
<p>Two minor Hindu girls have been abducted by the brother of an influential local politician in Sindh province whereas the victims&rsquo; family is facing constant life threats.</p>
<p>In a video, the victims&rsquo; family demanded justice after their minor daughters &ndash; Suthi and Shama &ndash; were forcibly abducted by the brother of Pir Faisal Shah Jeelani, a member of the National Assembly.</p>
<p>A family member said that Hindu minorities continue to face persecution in Sindh and they fear that girls will be converted to Islam.</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;Minorities here are facing persecution. They have abducted our daughters. We are not getting justice and are continuously facing atrocities. The brother of a Member of National Assembly (MNA) Pir Fasil Shah Jeelani threatens more abduction if we complain about it. Hindu minorities are facing threats. We can&rsquo;t face this torture and would like to move out of Sindh&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The family also said that police are not helping the victims but deliberately not taking any action due to the influence of the politician.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Police is not cooperating with us. They took us to a court but did not produce the victims before the magistrate. Police is also favouring the culprits,&rdquo; said a family member.</p>
<p>Uncounted incidents are reported from Sindh province and other parts of Pakistan where Muslims have forcibly abducted and converted Hindu minor girls to Islam for marriage.</p>
<p>These incidents are reportedly happening without the consent of the girls&rsquo; family.</p>
<p>Hindus make up 1.85 per cent of Pakistan&rsquo;s population according to the 1998 census. The list of atrocities perpetrated against Hindus includes forced conversions, forced abduction of young girls, lack of voting rights, and desecration of places of worship, to name a few.</p>
<p>However, the most barbaric of these monstrosities is the forced abduction of young Hindu girls.</p>
<p>The Global Human Rights Defence (GHRD) estimates that more than 1,000 Hindu and Christian girls are kidnapped and forced to convert to Islam annually.</p>
<p>The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has estimated that about 25 girls are abducted every month.

<h3 id="roop-durgapal-wishes-to-play-a-politician-on-screen">&ldquo;Roop Durgapal wishes to play a politician on screen&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-75743716,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-50876/75743716.jpg" alt="img">
While she feels that she has a flair for it, Roop Durgapal is not keen to enter politics in real life. However, the actress is more than willing to do some netagiri on reel. Roop, who has played an actress in ‘ Swaragini ’, a businesswoman in ‘ Kuch Rang Pyar Ke Aise Bhi ’ and a doctor in ‘ CIF ’, says that it’s her dream to play a politician. The actress, who catapulted to fame as Sanchi in ‘ Balika Vadhu ’, says, “I would love to play a politician someday. As a person, I have strong opinions about what’s happening around us, and aspire to bring about positive changes in society. Also, I am politically inclined. In fact, those who are close to me say that I should try my hands at politics. While I am not sure about that, I would definitely love to explore that side of me on screen.”So far, the actress has played similar roles in love triangles. However, she has no qualms about it. She says, “I don’t mind it as long as my character has meat. Typecasting is quite normal in TV and yes, I have mostly played the ‘other woman’ — a rich, beautiful NRI girl, who the guy falls for. Having said that, I am hoping for a change in this perception and someone to cast me as the heroine.”She adds, “I would love a change, but I feel fortunate about every opportunity that has come my way. Every role I have played so far has struck a chord with the audience. Besides, they offered great scope to perform. But, I am greedy and definitely want more.”Meanwhile, Roop, who was last seen in ‘Tujhse Hai Raabta’, is making the most of the lockdown period. She is regularly practising singing these days. “I am spending my time creatively. Apart from singing, I’m doing a lot of art work and learning Marathi as well,” she signs off.
