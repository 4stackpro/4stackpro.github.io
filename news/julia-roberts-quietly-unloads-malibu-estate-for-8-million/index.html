Oscar-winning actress Julia Roberts, who earlier this year was making moves in San Francisco, has quietly sold a Malibu property she owned in a trust for $8 million. Details are scant, as the transaction took place outside of the Multiple Listing Service.</p>
<p>The roughly one-acre estate sits across the street from the actress’ longtime residence in the Point Dume area.</p>
<p>The gated estate sits on more than an acre in Malibu’s Point Dume area. (NearMap)</p>
<p>Past a gated entry, the property contains a three-bedroom ranch house, gardens and a riding ring. A motor court and large grassy field fill out the front.</p>

<p>The property had been in the process of foreclosure before Roberts bought it in 2015 in another off-market deal for $6.84 million, The Times previously reported.</p>
<p>Roberts, 52, has scores of film credits including “Steel Magnolias,” “Pretty Woman” and “My Best Friend’s Wedding.” She won an Academy Award for her leading role in the 2001 film “Erin Brockovich.”</p>
<p>On the real estate front, the actress maintains other property in California including a century-old Victorian home in San Francisco that she bought through the same trust this year for $8.3 million. Four years ago, she sold a two-acre estate on the North Shore of Kauai for $16.2 million.

<p><img src="https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5e7e6b8defdd870008cd5b47/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-1191566979.jpg" alt="img">
Julia Roberts’s real estate switch-up is continuing with the recent sale of a Malibu estate. She bought it in an off-market deal for $6.84 million in 2015, and according to The Los Angeles Times, the Oscar-winning actress has now sold the three-bedroom ranch house for $8 million.</p>
<p>The transaction reportedly utilized the same trust that she used to purchase a century-old Victorian home in San Francisco earlier this year. Though details are limited, what is known about the dwelling she&rsquo;s parting ways with is that it sits on a roughly one-acre lot is situated across the street from her other Malibu home, and that it features a grand motor court hedged by a large grassy field, a riding ring, and plentiful gardens.</p>

<p>The neighboring house she still owns is a bluff-top estate that she bought in 2003 for $9.5 million. The Pretty Woman star also owns yet another dwelling in the beachfront area, a $3.895 million single-story ranch-style residence with three bedrooms and one bathroom and access to Little Dume, one of Malibu’s most private beaches. (She previously put this home up for rent at a rate of $10,000 a month.) In addition to her Malibu properties and the aforementioned $8.3 million San Francisco home, the Ben Is Back star maintains a secluded ranch in Taos, New Mexico.

<p><img src="https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/julia-roberts-timeline-rex-ftr.jpg" alt="img">
Can you believe it’s been 30 years since ‘Pretty Woman’ hit theaters? Decades later, Julia Roberts is still killing it, whether she’s rocking giant curls or sexy gowns. See her best looks in honor of the anniversary!</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, Julia Roberts, now 52, became an instant style icon when she transformed into Vivian for Pretty Woman. The 1990 classic romance saw Julia playing a prostitute who turns into a Beverly Hills high society woman with the help of her very rich, very handsome leading man, Richard Gere. And with that came tons and tons of costumes, running the gamut from thigh-high boots and pleather mini skirts, to demure polka dot dresses and opera gloves. And in her own life, the actress has had plenty of style and beauty revolutions herself. Take a look back through three decades of Julia’s most gorgeous outfits, hairstyles, and beauty choices.</p>
<p>She’s now 52 years old, but she doesn’t look a day older than she did in Pretty Woman. Just look at the photo of her below and dare to disagree! While accepting her Golden Globe in 1991 for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy (for Pretty Woman), Julia tried to go for the polar opposite of what her character would have worn. She styled her hair into a chic bob with delicate curls, and rocked an oversized, pinstripe blazer. Just the epitome of class! From there, she expanded her style repertoire. She grew her hair back out and embraced those huge, natural curls. While promoting her film Pelican Brief, in 1993, she looked radiant and happy with those bouncy locks. She brought them back several times over the years, experimenting with stick-straight hair in the interim.</p>
<p>Her red carpet looks have always been impeccable, too. While attending the 1999 Emmy Awards with then-boyfriend Benjamin Bratt, Julia opted for a curly updo and a simple black dress with spaghetti straps. Nearly 10 years later, she stunned on the amfAR Inspiration Gala red carpet in a black mini dress that flaunted her perfect legs. She contains multitudes, people.</p>
