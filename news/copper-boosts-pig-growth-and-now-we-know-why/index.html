Pigs have better feed conversion rates with copper in their diets, but until now, scientists didn&rsquo;t fully understand why. Existing research from the University of Illinois shows copper doesn&rsquo;t change fat and energy absorption from the diet. Instead, according to new research, the element seems to enhance pigs&rsquo; ability to utilize fat after absorption, resulting in increased energy utilization of the entire diet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our results indicate copper hydroxychloride is enhancing metabolism of fat, and that&rsquo;s how the pigs get more energy. And that, we believe, can explain why pigs have better feed conversion rates when we feed this copper source in the diets,&rdquo; says Hans H. Stein, professor in the Department of Animal Sciences at Illinois and co-author of a new study in the Journal of Animal Science.</p>
<p>In the study, Stein and his collaborators fed pigs one of two diets. Both primarily contained corn, soybean meal, and distillers dried grains with solubles, but one diet (a control) contained only 20 milligrams of copper chloride per kilogram. The experimental diet was identical, except it also contained 150 milligrams of copper hydroxychloride per kilogram.</p>
<p>Pigs consuming the experimental diet experienced greater average daily gain and gain-to-feed ratio, representing better feed conversion and economic savings for producers.</p>
<p>Stein&rsquo;s previous work showed fat and energy digestibility didn&rsquo;t change with inclusion of similar rates of copper hydroxychloride. So, to really understand copper&rsquo;s effects on post-absorptive fat metabolism, the researchers evaluated gene expression in tissue samples from the pigs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw greater expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and lipid utilization in the liver, adipose tissue, and to a lesser degree in the muscle,&rdquo; Stein says. &ldquo;This indicates that dietary copper may affect signaling pathways associated with lipid metabolism by improving the uptake, transport, and utilization of fatty acids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Copper&rsquo;s ability to boost feed conversion rates is welcome news with agencies regulating antibiotics as growth promoters.</p>
<p>But copper isn&rsquo;t necessarily a perfect workaround.</p>
<p>In Europe, Stein says, environmental concerns prompt copper regulation in waste streams. That&rsquo;s why understanding copper&rsquo;s role in pig nutrition is so important. If less copper or a different form with a smaller environmental footprint could fulfill the same biological function, producers could continue to benefit while also protecting the environment.

<h3 id="wrapping-up-march-whats-new-in-the-world-of-pigs">Wrapping up March: What’s new in the world of pigs?</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.pigprogress.net/Resizes/mainarticleimage/PageFiles/01/01/40101/001_299_IMG_PPR_26_BusinessUpdateMarch_MAIN.jpg" alt="img">
March 2020 has been a month like nothing before. Covid-19 caused the global pig business to stay indoors, cancelling events and meetings and upset plans. That doesn’t mean, however, that there was no pig business news to report on. Especially pig breeding companies announced new plans.</p>
<p>PIC and Otrada join forces for pig genetics</p>
<p>Pig genetics company PIC and Russian genetics distribution company Otrada have entered a strategic relationship, as from the 1st quarter of 2020. Otrada will become the exclusive partner in Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia and Armenia for PIC’s lines X54 (F1 female), L04 (Landrace), L05 (Yorkshire) and the PIC800 (Duroc). The deal combines PIC’s genetic programme and genetics with Otrada’s know-how in genetic production and distribution.</p>
<p>Hendrix Genetics upgrades swine app</p>
<p>Hendrix Genetics’ swine breeding brand, Hypor, has launched a new version of its mobile app for clients, which can run both in Android and IOS and which works both offline and online, sending data to the cloud. The original app included track and trace, genetic defects and losses, with all measurements linked to an individual animal. Data was sent to a breeding database where it was processed and used to estimate genetic breeding values.</p>
<p>Zinpro: New video demonstrating trace minerals</p>
<p>Zinpro has produced an animated video, Take the Proven Path, to educate the industry about the difference in trace mineral absorption and metabolism. The company believes that its range of performance minerals are more efficiently absorbed and utilised, maximising animal wellness and genetic potential.</p>
<p>Thermo Fisher Scientific acquires Qiagen</p>
<p>Thermo Fisher Scientific’s proposal to acquire Qiagen has been approved. Qiagen is a provider of life science and molecular diagnostic solutions and employs about 5,100 people at 35 locations in more than 25 countries. The company generated 2019 revenue of $ 1.53 billion. Its sample preparation technologies are used to extract, isolate and purify DNA, RNA and proteins from a wide range of biological samples.</p>
<p>Bayer launches global Care4Pigs grant</p>
<p>Bayer Animal Health has launched the new global Care4Pigs grant initiative which is a collaboration with the Farm Animal Welfare Education Centre and Korean Association of Swine Veterinarians. The initiative offers 3 projects the chance to receive € 10,000 each to support innovation aimed at enhancing swine well-being. Grant applications must be submitted by 30 June 2020.</p>
<p>CPF takes 20% stake in Tesco</p>
<p>CP Merchandising (CPM), which is a subsidiary of Thai agribusiness Charoen Pokphand Foods, is acquiring up to 20% of total issued shares in Tesco Asia Group in Thailand and Malaysia. The acquisition is aimed to strengthen CPF’s value chain in terms of distribution channels in the 2 countries and to enhance the range of consumer options in this space. CPF is planning to modernise its distribution channels of meat products to better suit consumers’ behaviour.</p>
<p>Olmix and INRAE partner for the promotion of algae</p>
<p>The French National Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment (INRAE) and Olmix will evaluate the effect of different compounds rich in marine sulfated polysaccharides on a wide range of biological activities able to improve production performance and the resistance of animals to infections. Research highlighted that some of the tested extracts could be used in feeds as natural products to e.g. stimulate the immune response of livestock animals.</p>
<p>AB Vista and partners: 9 swine research papers</p>
<p>AB Vista presented the methodologies and findings from 9 new studies examining the effects of calcium, phosphorous, phytase, xylanase and xylo-oligosaccharides on swine performance at the ASAS Midwest Section/ADSA Midwest Branch Joint Meeting in the US. Highlights indicated that using a high dose of phytase and xylanase enabled a reduction in formulation cost, improved performance and reduced CO 2 e emissions from animals fed less dense diets.</p>
<p>Animine presents the impact of copper in piglet feeds</p>
<p>At the 52nd Swine Research Days held in Paris, Animine looked at copper in piglets’ feeds. One study evaluated the impact of the reduction of copper level, from 140 ppm to 90 ppm, on 560 piglets during the starter phase. Performance wasn’t affected when copper sulfate was replaced by copper(I) oxide (CoRouge). Results may be explained by a stronger effect of CoRouge on E. coli population in the piglet intestine compared to copper sulfate.</p>
