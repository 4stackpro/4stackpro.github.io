<p>Image caption Ricky Valance&rsquo;s single Tell Laura I Love Her sold more than a million copies in 1960</p>
<p>Welsh singer Ricky Valance has died at the age of 84, his agent has confirmed.</p>
<p>Valance, who was born David Spencer, became the first Welshman to have a solo UK Number One hit with the song Tell Laura I Love Her in 1960.</p>
<p>The singer was born in Ynysddu, now in Caerphilly county, and joined the RAF aged 17 before going into the music business.</p>
<p>His agent said he had been diagnosed with dementia and had been in hospital since before the start of lockdown.</p>
<p>Valance was lead soprano in his local church choir as a child, before joining the air force, where he saw active service in north Africa before returning three years later.</p>
<p>It was then he started performing in clubs in the north of England, before being signed and recording Tell Laura I Love Her.</p>
<p>The song tells the tragic story of a boy called Tommy and his love for a girl called Laura.</p>
<p>Image copyright One Media iP Ltd Image caption Valance released a final single, called Welcome Home, in 2017</p>
<p>It was controversial at the time and reportedly banned from airplay by the BBC, but went on to be a number one single, selling more than a million copies.</p>
<p>It spent 16 weeks in the chart, three of those at number one, but was to prove his only big hit in the UK.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, fans have taken to social media to express their sadness at his death.</p>
<p>Hyder Ali Pirwany tweeted: &ldquo;Ricky Valance, RIP. Great singer from Wales. His &ldquo;Tell Laura I love her&rdquo; song was tear jerking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While another fan wrote: &ldquo;Another one gone. RIP. Hope Laura is waiting for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2015, Valance was given an award at a St David&rsquo;s Day concert at the Wales Millennium Centre for being the first Welshman to have a UK Number One hit.</p>
<p>In 2017, he released a final single, called Welcome Home, to raise money for the Royal Air Force Museum and RAF Association.</p>
<p>Valance and his wife Evelyn were living in Skegness, Lincolnshire, at the time of his death.

Katherine Williams-Dunning, daughter of singer Hank Williams Jr. and granddaughter of Alabama-born country music legend Hank Williams, was killed in a car crash in Tennessee on Saturday night. She was 27.</p>
<p>Williams-Dunning, called “Katie” by family, was driving a 2007 Chevrolet Tahoe and towing a boat at about 7:45 p.m. on Highway 79 near Paris, Tenn., west of Kentucky Lake and about 110 miles west of Nashville, when the vehicle crossed the median, rolled over, and came to a stop on the shoulder, according to WKRN. She died at the scene.</p>
<p>Her husband, Tyler Dunning, 29, was in the vehicle. He was airlifted to Vanderbilt University Medical Center and was awake and responding, according to a social media post by Katherine’s sister, singer Holly Williams, who was born in Cullman.</p>
<p>The Dunnings were married Oct. 15, 2015 and have two children, Beau, 5, and Audrey, 2.</p>
<p>Williams-Dunning was Hank Jr.’s daughter with his third wife, Mary Jane Thomas, according to CMT. They have been married since 1990. Hank Jr. has five children, including from previous marriages to Becky White and Gwen Yeargain. Sam Williams, the youngest of the five children, pursued a musical career. Unlike her siblings, Katherine never pursued a singing career.</p>
<p>Hank Jr., who has lived in Alabama at times, followed his famous father into country music stardom, often performing his father’s songs, but steered his own course and is best known for hit songs including “A Country Boy Can Survive,” “Family Tradition,” and “All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight,” which became the theme song to open NFL broadcasts for Monday Night Football. Hank Jr. performed at Oak Mountain Amphitheater in Pelham on Oct. 25, 2018, as part of the Lynyrd Skynyrd Farewell Tour. He played June 14, 2019, at the Tuscaloosa Amphitheater.

Singer Bonnie Pointer, best known as a member of the Grammy-winning group The Pointer Sisters, has died at the age of 69, a representative has said.</p>
<p>She died on Monday, according to her sister and fellow singer, Anita. No cause of death was revealed.</p>
<p>In a statement to the PA news agency, Anita said: “It is with great sadness that I have to announce to the fans of The Pointer Sisters that my sister, Bonnie died this morning.</p>
<p>“Our family is devastated, on behalf of my siblings and I and the entire Pointer family, we ask for your prayers at this time.”</p>
<p>During Bonnie’s time as part of The Pointer Sisters, they scored a hit with Yes We Can Can in 1973 and Fairytale in 1974, which also co-wrote. The latter song went on to win a Grammy.</p>
<p>After she left the group in 1977, Bonnie signed with Motown and proceeded to have a successful solo career with three albums and the hit Heaven Must Have Sent You. In the years since, she returned to perform with the remaining members of the group and returned with a solo album in 2011. She also played herself in the 2010 film Road to Nowhere.</p>
<p>“Bonnie was my best friend and we talked every day,” Anita said in a statement. “We never had a fight in our life. I already miss her, and I will see her again one day.”</p>
<p>Gloria Gaynor also paid tribute to the singer on Twitter. “So sorry to hear of the passing of Bonnie Pointer of the Pointer Sisters,” she wrote. “My prayers &amp; heartfelt condolences go out to her family, friends &amp; fans.

<h3 id="death-of-exiled-singer-sparks-controversy-in-iran">&ldquo;Death of exiled singer sparks controversy in Iran&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.malaymail.com/resize_cache/uploads/articles/2020/2020-06/marjan1506-seo.jpg" alt="img">
YouTube image of Shahla Safi Zamir, better known by her stage name Marjan, died aged 71 in a Los Angeles hospital on June 6.</p>
<p>NICOSIA, June 15 — The death this month of exiled Iranian actress and singer Marjan has sparked controversy in her home country, with conservative pressure forcing some famous Iranians to retract their condolences.</p>
<p>Shahla Safi Zamir, better known by her stage name Marjan, died aged 71 in a Los Angeles hospital on June 6, the Boston Globe reported, citing a statement by outlawed opposition group The National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI).</p>
<p>After starting her career in Iranian cinema, Marjan became a pop singer, famous for her disco hit Kavire Del (Desert of the Heart), before the Islamic Revolution of 1979 halted her career.</p>
<p>Several celebrities in Iran paid homage to her, including film director Tahmineh Milani who offered condolences “to the daughter and family of Marjan.”</p>
<p>Popular ex-footballer Ali Karimi published a Marjan song on his Instagram page.</p>
<p>These messages were aggressively attacked by ultraconservatives like Raja News website, which published an article accusing celebrities of encouraging people “to admire hypocrites” or Monafeghin in Persian.</p>
<p>Monafeghin is a term Iran uses to refer to the People&rsquo;s Mujahedeen of Iran, an exiled opposition group it considers a “”terrorist” cult led by Maryam Rajavi.</p>
<p>Rajavi, who is also head of the NCRI, paid her respects to Marjan and her “songs of freedom.”</p>
<p>She also claimed that the actress had joined the People&rsquo;s Mujahedin after “long and painful years of incarceration” in Iran.</p>
<p>Following the attacks by ultra-conservatives, several of the targeted personalities accused the People&rsquo;s Mujahedin of appropriating their condolences for propaganda purposes.</p>
<p>The condolences were not “proof of any political alignment with Rajavi&rsquo;s positions,” Milani said on Instagram.</p>
<p>The director, who is also a feminist activist, said she was unaware Marjan was sympathetic to the People&rsquo;s Mujahedin.</p>
<p>“I have never been member to any party,” actor Ashkan Khatibi wrote on Instagram, accusing the People&rsquo;s Mujahedin of exploiting the condolences of artists. “Shame on you,” he wrote.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the ultra-conservative newspaper Kayhan wrote that it regretted that “censorship” prevented Iranian media from reporting on these messages of “condemnation” of the People&rsquo;s Mujahedin. — AFP

<p><img src="https://www.dw.com/image/53537377_304.jpg" alt="img">
Guinean singer Mory Kante who helped spread African music to the world in the 1980s died on Friday at the age of 70, his son has announced.</p>
<p>Kante is best known for the dance song Yeke Yeke which was a huge hit across the African continent before becoming a Number 1 in several European countries, including France and Germany, in 1988. It was the first ever African single to sell over one million copies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He suffered from chronic illnesses and often traveled to France for treatment, but that was no longer possible with the coronavirus,&rdquo; his son Balla Kante told AFP news agency. Guinea has seen over 3,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 18 people have died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw his condition deteriorate rapidly, but I was still surprised because he&rsquo;s been through much worse times before,&rdquo; he added. There was no suggestion that coronavirus was his direct cause of death.</p>
<p>Mory Kante performs during the 2010 International Carthage festival in Tunisia</p>
<p>Kante was nicknamed the &ldquo;electronic griot.&rdquo; A griot is a name for traditional West African musicians and storytellers.</p>
<p>He will be remembered as a founding member of the &ldquo;African wave&rdquo; and inspiring many other African musicians to share their music with an international audience.</p>

<p><img src="https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/70b/2d2/439db1d1c1fe978c113e1846c0d3f447d4-14-robertfuller.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg" alt="img">

<p>Protesters gathered in Palmdale, California, over the weekend, to call for renewed investigation into the death of Robert Fuller, a 24-year-old black man whose body was found hanging from a tree outside City Hall last week. Officials initially suggested Fuller died by suicide, but the circumstances bear an eery resemblance to a recent death in nearby Victorville, about 45 miles away: Days earlier, the body of Malcolm Harsch, a 38-year-old black man, was found in a tree outside the city’s library. The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department says it does not currently suspect foul play, but both Harsch’s family members and Fuller’s remain skeptical. In both cases, people who knew the men suspect they were murdered.</p>
<p>Here, everything we know so far about Fuller and Harsch’s deaths.</p>
<p>Malcolm Harsch’s body was found on May 31.</p>
<p>According to the Victor Valley News, firefighters found Harsch’s body hanging from a tree outside the Victorville City Library around 7 a.m. on May 31. “There were no indications at the scene that suggested foul play; however, the cause and manner of death are still pending,” San Bernardino County Sheriff’s spokeswoman Jodi Miller told the outlet, adding that the investigation remains open.</p>
<p>Still, Harsch’s family members — most of whom live in Ohio — told the VVN in a statement that they “are concerned that his death will be labeled as a suicide, as this is what was communicated to us upon confirmation of his death.” They say the sheriff’s deputy who called to inform them of Harsch’s death on June 1 said Harsch hanged himself with a USB cable, which they found implausible, considering his “six-foot-three-inches-long body wasn’t even dangling from the tree.” The deputy asked about Harsch’s drug and alcohol use, the family said, and also “made a statement about how the coronavirus has ‘hit people really hard.’”</p>
<p>Further, the family’s statement said, Harsch was found with blood on his shirt, although investigators reported no signs of a struggle and no open wounds.</p>
<p>“[We] feel that our brother’s death will be waved off as a suicide to avoid any further media attention,” they continued. “Malcolm had very recent conversations with his children about seeing them soon. He didn’t seem to be depressed to anyone who truly knew him. EVERYONE who knew our brother was shocked to hear that he allegedly hung himself and don’t believe it to be true as well as the people who were there when his body was discovered … There are many ways to die but considering the current racial tension, a black man hanging himself from a tree definitely doesn’t sit well with us right now. We want justice not comfortable excuses.”</p>
<p>Robert Fuller’s body was found on June 10.</p>
<p>Around 3:39 a.m. on June 10, a passerby saw Fuller’s body in a tree at the edge of Poncitlán Square, a courtyard outside Palmdale City Hall. According to the Daily Beast, homicide investigators reported that his body showed “no signs of a struggle,” and both the city and the Los Angeles County medical examiner’s office initially pointed to suicide. “Sadly, it is not the first such incident since the COVID-19 pandemic began,” read an early statement from city officials, according to the Daily Beast.</p>
<p>But Fuller’s family and loved ones do not believe he killed himself. One of his friends from high school, Tommie Anderson, told the Los Angeles Times that the tree where Fuller was found was too thin to have supported his weight for very long, and he was too tall for his body to have dangled from its lower branches. Anderson, who also expressed skepticism that Fuller would’ve been out that late, said, “For people to say he did this, this wasn’t Robert. For him to tie himself to that tree, it’s not possible.”</p>

<p>Fuller’s sister, Diamond Alexander, said she did not believe that Fuller — who had attended a Black Lives Matter protest a few days before he died — hanged himself. “My brother was a survivor,” she told the Times. “We want to find out the truth of what really happened. Everything that they’ve been telling us has not been right.”</p>
<p>Officials say there are no security cameras in the park where Fuller was found that could provide more information on what happened. For some, that claim strains credulity, given the tree’s proximity to City Hall.</p>

<p>Protesters and activists suspect Fuller and Harsch were lynched.</p>
<p>According to the Anti-Defamation League, Southern California — and San Bernardino County in particular — has seen a large spike in white-supremacist activity in recent years. Neo-Nazi groups have been active in Antelope Valley for decades, and in 2007, KKK flyers depicting Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton hanging from trees were distributed in Palmdale, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, elected officials in Palmdale conspired for years with the L.A. Housing Authority to push out low-income black families using harassment and bullying tactics, pointing to a pattern of race-based discrimination in the area.</p>
<p>That Fuller and Harsch’s deaths came amid weeks of national protests in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, combined with the location of the bodies — both in front of municipal buildings — has led many to believe that both men were lynched. On Saturday, thousands gathered in Palmdale to demand a full investigation into Fuller’s death.</p>

<p>The incidents caught the attention of various celebrities over the weekend, with actor Viola Davis labeling Fuller’s death “murder” and singer Becky G questioning the suicide designation. Kim Kardashian West also circulated a change.org petition demanding a “thorough and proper investigation” and justice for Fuller.</p>
<p>Palmdale officials now say they support an independent investigation and autopsy.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger formally requested that California Attorney General Xavier Becerra “lend additional expertise and oversight into this important investigation and provide the community with the answers they deserve” by opening an independent investigation into Fuller’s death. The City of Palmdale also released a statement saying it “is officially supporting the call for an independent investigation and an independent autopsy of Mr. Fuller,” and that officials are “joining the family and the community’s call for justice.”</p>
<p>“We do support a full investigation into his death,” it continues. “We will settle for nothing less than a thorough accounting of this matter.”</p>
