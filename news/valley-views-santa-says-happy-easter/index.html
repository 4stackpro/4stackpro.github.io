<p>Every morning I have coffee with my daughter. We chat and laugh and discuss buying groceries more than two sane women should. I report I took a walk around my neighborhood. She tells me they put up their tent in the backyard.</p>
<p>Although we live two miles apart, our coffee klatches are done via FaceTime for obvious reasons. Nonetheless they brighten my days and give them structure.</p>
<p>We usually begin with her iPad propped up on one side of the kitchen table so I can watch my 8-year-old granddaughter and 4-year-old grandson eat breakfast, and they make it look so delicious that I immediately crave cereal or whatever they are eating. Now I know why commercials use kids.</p>
<p>Sometimes they have something exciting to show me, like an art project. One morning, the boy declared after less than a minute: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s turn Grandma off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare!&rdquo; I replied, with exaggerated shock.</p>
<p>I thought it might be fun to surprise them some time by playing a musical instrument although my talent is sadly lacking. My husband played piano and guitar, and in an effort in the &rsquo;70s to bring out my inner musician, he bought two recorders, alto and soprano, and we learned a Mozart duet.</p>
<p>When I downsized a few years ago, our piano went to my daughter, and my son took possession of the guitar. The recorders stayed in the guest room nightstand drawer where they had been for decades.</p>
<p>So last week, I went to the guest room to pull out the music and relearn the Mozart. The drawer contained the sheet music and a long recorder brush for cleaning, but no recorders. I vaguely recalled something about them when my son had visited in January with his 3-year-old twins.</p>
<p>I texted him: &ldquo;I am looking for the recorders. Did you take them back to Berlin with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He replied that the twins had discovered them, so he had tucked them away somewhere safe. &ldquo;Look up high,&rdquo; he advised. I looked â€“ and looked. Which led to cleaning out many top closet shelves but not finding any recorders.</p>
<p>So! On to my next lone pursuit.</p>
<p>Since the grandkids like mail, I send them cards for every holiday and tuck in stickers and crisp dollar bills. My aunt used to send me $1 bills when I was a child so I know maybe I should adjust for inflation. But the kids seem happy, so I stick with $1, calling it a family tradition.</p>
<p>I went into solitary confinement before buying Easter cards, so I decided to access my inner artist and make some. An online search yielded dozens of clever ideas for creating cute cards replete with chicks, bunnies and three-dimensional eggs.</p>
<p>First, since I would need envelopes, I went to the garage to retrieve boxes of Christmas cards I&rsquo;d tucked in with the decorations. I was pleased to find new cards with multiple cheery Santas on the front and the message inside, &ldquo;Happy Holidays!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I gathered construction paper, markers, scissors and glue when it hit me: I am not an artsy/Etsy-type person, so why couldn&rsquo;t these friendly Santas deliver my message? Inside two of the cards, I crossed out the word &ldquo;holidays&rdquo; and wrote in &ldquo;Easter,&rdquo; and drew bunny ears on one of the Santas. I enclosed stickers and the $1 bills and put them in the mail.</p>
<p>The cards should arrive soon, and I will learn the reaction, which might be, &ldquo;How funny Grandma is!&rdquo; But there is an equal chance of the response, &ldquo;Grandma is losing it&rdquo; or &ldquo;Grandma got lazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are discovering so many inner me&rsquo;s these days. When friends on social media began to dig out their old jigsaw puzzles, I decided to harness my inner puzzler.</p>
<p>Someone had just sent me a 500-piece jigsaw puzzle picturing historic figures who helped achieve women&rsquo;s suffrage, thinking I might enjoy doing it with my granddaughter. That isn&rsquo;t going to happen any time soon, so I worked alone on the suffragettes this week on my dining room table.</p>
<p>All of which brings me to my latest existential question: What does one do with a completed jigsaw puzzle? I will discuss it with my daughter tomorrow morning over coffee.

<p><img src="https://editorial.fxstreet.com/images/Markets/Currencies/Majors/DollarIndex/us-currency-with-one-quarter-coins-50559936_Large.jpg" alt="img">
US Dollar: June USD is Down at 100.010.</p>
<p>Energies: May&rsquo;20 Crude Up at 26.58.</p>
<p>Financials: The June&rsquo;20 30 year bond is Up 11 ticks and trading at 178.20.</p>
<p>Indices: The June S&amp;P 500 emini ES contract is 32 ticks Lower and trading at 2727.00.</p>
<p>Gold: The June &lsquo;20 Gold contract is trading Up at 1703.20. Gold is 189 ticks Higher than its close.</p>
<p>Initial Conclusion</p>
<p>This is not a correlated market. The dollar is Down- and Crude is Up+ which is normal but the 30 year Bond is trading Higher. The Financials should always correlate with the US dollar such that if the dollar is lower then bonds should follow and vice-versa. The S&amp;P is Lower and Crude is trading Higher which is correlated. Gold is trading Higher which is correlated with the US dollar trading Down. I tend to believe that Gold has an inverse relationship with the US Dollar as when the US Dollar is down, Gold tends to rise in value and vice-versa. Think of it as a seesaw, when one is up the other should be down. I point this out to you to make you aware that when we don&rsquo;t have a correlated market, it means something is wrong. As traders you need to be aware of this and proceed with your eyes wide open.</p>
<p>At this time all of Asia is trading mainly Higher with the exception of the Nikkei exchange which is Lower. Currently Europe is trading Mixed.</p>
<p>Possible Challenges To Traders Today:</p>
<p>Unemployment Claims are out at 8:30 AM EST. This is Major.</p>
<p>PPI is out at 8:30 AM EST. This is Major.</p>
<p>Core PPI is out at 8:30 AM EST. This is Major.</p>
<p>Fed Chair Powell Speaks at 10 AM EST. This is Major.</p>
<p>Prelim UoM Consumer Sentiment is out at 10 AM EST. This is Major.</p>
<p>Prelim UoM Inflation Expectations is out at 10 AM EST. This is Major.</p>
<p>Final Wholesale Inventories is out at 10 AM EST. This is not Major.</p>
<p>Natural Gas Storage is out at 10:30 AM EST. This is Major.</p>
<p>Treasuries</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve elected to switch gears a bit and show correlation between the 30 year bond (ZB) and The S&amp;P futures contract. The S&amp;P contract is the Standard and Poor&rsquo;s and the purpose is to show reverse correlation between the two instruments. Remember it&rsquo;s liken to a seesaw, when up goes up the other should go down and vice versa.</p>
<p>Yesterday the ZB made a move at around 10 AM EST. The ZB hit a High at around that time and the S&amp;P moved Higher. If you look at the charts below ZB gave a signal at around 10 AM and the S&amp;P moved Higher at around the same time. Look at the charts below and you&rsquo;ll see a pattern for both assets. ZB hit a High at around 10 AM EST and the S&amp;P was moving Higher shortly thereafter. These charts represent the newest version of MultiCharts and I&rsquo;ve changed the timeframe to a 15 minute chart to display better. This represented a Shorting opportunity on the 30 year bond, as a trader you could have netted 30 plus ticks per contract on this trade. Each tick is worth $31.25. Please note: the front month for the ZB is now June &lsquo;20. The S&amp;P contract is now June &lsquo;20 as well. I&rsquo;ve changed the format to Renko bars such that it may be more apparent and visible.</p>
<p>Charts Courtesy of MultiCharts built on an AMP platform</p>
<p>ZB - June 2020 - 4/8/20</p>
<p>SP June 2020 - 4/8/20</p>
<p>Bias</p>
<p>Yesterday we gave the markets a Neutral bias as we didn&rsquo;t see much evidence in the way of Market Correlation. What we saw was instruments flip flopping between positive and negative territory. Today we aren&rsquo;t dealing with a correlated market and our bias is Neutral.</p>
<p>Could this change? Of Course. Remember anything can happen in a volatile market.</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<p>Yesterday morning we witnessed various instruments flip flopping between positive and negative territory. We didn&rsquo;t see any firm conviction in terms of Market Correlation hence the Neutral bias. For those of you who are new to us, a Neutral bias means the markets could go in any direction and often does. The Dow gained 780 points and the other indices gained ground as well. Today is the last trading day prior to Easter Sunday as tomorrow is Good Friday and the markets are closed until Monday, April 12. Given that it is the Easter Holiday let&rsquo;s try to give thanks for all we have regardless of how small it is. We&rsquo;ll be back on Monday, have a safe and Happy Holiday!!!
