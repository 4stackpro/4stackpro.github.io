<p>In Photos: From Maanav in Pavitra Rishta to Annirudh in Chhichhore, roles that defined Sushant Singh Rajput 1 12 Tracing Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s life in films Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s tryst with the camera began with a chance sighting. Ekta Kapoor&rsquo;s casting team spotted him in a play by Nadira Babbar&rsquo;s theatre company and invited him to audition for a show. It set the ball rolling on the then-aspiring hero&rsquo;s career. A look: Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil (2008) Sushant made his television debut as Preet Juneja on this show. The character was killed early on, but was brought back as a spirit for the series finale, owing to his popularity. Pavitra Rishta (2009) The next year, he landed the lead role of Manav Deshmukh in the hit show, widely considered to be his breakout role and a stepping stone to films. While working on this Ekta Kapoor production, he also met his future girlfriend, Ankita Lokhande, who played the female lead. Kai Po Che! (2013) After participating in two dance-based reality shows— Zara Nachke Dikha 2 and Jhalak Dikhhla Ja 4—Sushant auditioned for this Abhishek Kapoor directorial, and bagged one of the three lead roles alongside Rajkummar Rao and Amit Sadh. His portrayal of former district-level cricketer Ishaan Bhatt, who falls prey to politics in the selection process, in the critical and commercial success earned him raves. Shuddh Desi Romance (2013) Sushant followed it up with this Maneesh Sharma-directed Parineeti Chopra and Vaani Kapoor co-starrer. The romance comedy-drama was set in Jaipur and revolved around youngsters’ take on love and live-in relationships. PK (2014) In Rajkumar Hirani’s satirical comedy-drama led by Aamir Khan and Anushka Sharma, Sushant had a brief yet notable role. Detective Byomkesh Bakshy (2015) Dibakar Banerjee’s mystery thriller featured the actor in the titular role, a character created by Bengali writer Sharanindu Bandopadhyay. Set in the Kolkata of the 1940s, the film was reportedly to get a sequel with Sushant reprising his role. MS Dhoni: The Untold Story (2016) Neeraj Pandey’s biographical drama that traces the journey of the eponymous former Indian skipper-wicket keeper saw Sushant take on another titular role. The film, which also featured Kiara Advani and Disha Patani, secured for Sushant his first Filmfare Best Actor nomination the following year. Raabta (2017) In Dinesh Vijan’s directorial debut, a reincarnation-themed romance actioner, Sushant was paired opposite Kriti Sanon and the duo played star-crossed lovers. The film featured Jim Sarbh, Rajkumar Yadav and Varun Dharma in supporting roles. Kedarnath (2018) The actor reunited with Abhishek ‘Gattu’ Kapoor to headline Sara Ali Khan’s launch vehicle. The inter-faith love story was set against the backdrop of the pilgrim site and revolved around a Muslim boy who falls in love with a rich Brahmin girl. Sonchiriya (2019) Co-written and directed by Abhishek Chaubey, the film is set in the Chambal ravines of 1975 and tells the story of a group of dacoits. It also featured Manoj Bajpayee, Bhumi Pednekar, Ranvir Shorey and Ashutosh Rana. Chhichhore (2019) Sushant followed it up with one of the biggest successes of his career with this Nitesh Tiwari-directed campus comedy-drama. The film won five Filmfare nods, including Best Film and Best Director. It was also Sushant’s last theatrical release.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput was known as someone perennially brimming with ideas and young energy. So, many didn&rsquo;t bat an eyelid while reading his last post on Instagram. Shared with a picture of his late mother on June 3, the post seemed like an inconspicuous observation in line with the general mood across social media feeds&hellip; until Sunday afternoon, when news of the actor’s suicide broke.A student of metaphysics and spirituality, Sushant was a stickler for perfection when it came to his craft. He passed up six films and devoted six months to Shekhar Kapur&rsquo;s futuristic sci-fi romantic drama, Paani, which revolved around water wars. Prep for the 34-year-old actor meant reading and re-reading the script, understanding the character, his back story, where he was coming from and where he was headed. Talking to Mirror (September 14, 2015), he had pointed out that he could have sixpack abs but not for show, “because this guy lives in the Lower City, where everybody fights to get something to eat and then, there&rsquo;s no water”. It was only when he realised thatwould go on the floors before Paani, that he shifted focus to the biopic, spending 18 months ‘becoming’ the titular character with former Indian wicketkeeper Kiran More. “Complete immersion is important, more so when you&rsquo;re playing a real-life living character. Viewers must feel you are him and not pretending to be him,&rdquo; he had reasoned, admitting that there were times when he felt like he was talking like Dhoni.During that interview, he was asked what if he could fast forward to 2040, when Paani unfolds, and he looked horrified, “I wouldn&rsquo;t even jump a year ahead, forget 25 years. I’m a control freak, which is why I can&rsquo;t sleep at night for longer than four-five hours. My friends insisted that I consult a doctor, who told me that I was excited and restless for no particular reason, which is why I couldn&rsquo;t sleep. Also, I was afraid that if I did, I would lose control.”Sushant was a National Olympiad winner in physics, and having grown up in a large family, had learnt the value of money early on, when he couldn’t pursue his dream of going to Stanford University. Instead, he took the All India Engineering Entrance Exam (popularly known as AIEEE) and came seventh, securing a seat in the prestigious Delhi College of Engineering. However, he dropped out in the final year. “If I had waited another six months, I could have come to Mumbai with a degree. I take time to make decisions, but once it is made, there are no regrets or uncertainty,” he had pointed out.Starting out with TV soaps like Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil and Pavitra Rishta, he made a smooth transition to films with Abhishek Kapoor’s!, for which he bagged a Filmfare Award for Best Debut. With just 10 releases, his filmography is short but varied, with films like, Detective Byomkesh Bakshy, PK, Kedarnath and his last release, Chhichhore, in which Sushant played a doting dad trying to revive his son from a coma caused by a suicide attempt.Around the release of the Abhishek Chaubey-directed dacoit drama,, the actor had told Mirror that he has 12 films in the pipeline. “It’s for me to decide what to do next…There is no film that I want to do that I can’t do,” he had stated confidently. His last film, Dil Bechara, an official adaptation of The Fault In Our Stars, was gearing up for a direct-to-digital release.Two years ago, the actor had flown down to National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to train as anto play one in a film, which he later opted out of, but not before buying a piece of land on the moon and promising to come up with his own space film. Then, as a part of his 50-dreams-to-realise list, he wanted to send kids for workshops at Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and NASA. He would regularly study constellations in the sky from the terrace of his Pavana home, also going fishing, boating and swimming in the lake close by. But he had clarilifed that both the Bandra apartment and this holiday home were rented. “The only property I own is on the Moon, besides the Maserati, which was a childhood dream,” he had informed.During the lockdown, the actor was learning how to code for his love of computer games. He even listed down tried-and-tested methods to optimise Return of Investment on time, advising fans to get seven hours of sleep, meditate regularly, journal, exercise, optimise digital time and practice intermittent fasting to upgrade their quality of life. His words, &ldquo;If you give me more money and fame, I will keep it because I am smart, but if I don’t get it, I won’t worry because I have enough already,” spoken during an interview, resonate as we bid him adieu.Last year, he had confided that for his 33rd birthday on January 21, he had wanted to fly to Norway and paint the Northern Lights. It was one of the many things on his 150-to-do list that remained incomplete.

Year 2020 भारतीय सिनेमा इंडस्ट्री के लिए इतना बुरा साबित हो रहा है जिसके बारे में किसी ने कल्पना भी नहीं की होगी. कोरोना ने बॉलीवुड की चलती-फिलती गाड़ी पर ऐसे ब्रेक लगाया कि सबकुछ पलट गया. उसके बाद अप्रैल महीने में इरफान खान और ऋषि कपूर की असामयिक मौत ने फैंस के दिलों में ऐसा सुनापन भरा कि वे अब तक इस सदमे से उबर नहीं पाए थे. और अब बॉलीवुड के इमर्जिंग स्टार और अगला शाहरुख खान माने जाने रहे सुशांत सिंह राजपुत की खुदकुशी (Sushant Singh Rajput Suicide death news) में ऐसा दर्द दे दिया है कि वे साल 2020 को ताउम्र ऐसे मातम के रूप में याद करेंगे, जिसे उबर पाना आसान नहीं है. हाल ही में सुशांत सिंह राजपूत के मैनेजर ने भी मुंबई में ही खुदकुशी कर ली थी. सुशांत की खुदकुशी के पीछे की वजहों का पता नहीं चल पाया है.</p>
<p>पिछले साल ‘छिछोरे’ फिल्म में लीड किरदार में नजर आए सुशांत सिंह राजपूत ने रविवार को मुंबई स्थित अपने घर में फांसी लगाकर जान दे दी. जब लोग कोरोना संकट से बुरी तरह त्रस्त हैं, वैसे समय में अपने फेवरेट एक्टर फिर कभी न देख पाने की कल्पना मात्र से ही डर जाते हैं. बिहार की राजधानी पटना में जन्मे सुशांत सिंह राजपूत ने 34 साल की उम्र में ही इतना बड़ा मुकाम हासिल कर लिया, जिसके बारे में लोग सोच भी नहीं पाते हैं. टीवी से फिल्म ऐक्टर के सफर और बॉलीवुड के सबसे फेसस डायरेक्टर्स के साथ काम करने वाले सुशांत सिंह राजपूत छोटे शहर के ऐसे लोगों के लिए सपने की तरह थे, जिन्होंने सिनेमा इंडस्ट्री में कुछ करने का हौसला पाला था.</p>
<p>पुर्णिया से वाया पटना दिल्ली और फिर मुंबई</p>
<p>सुशांत सिंह राजपूत ने ऐक्टर बनने का सपना बचपन में ही पाल लिया था. मूल रूप से बिहार के पुर्णिया के रहने वाले सुशांत ने पटना के बाद दिल्ली का सफर तय करते हुए साल 2003 में दिल्ली टेक्नोलॉजिकल कॉलेज में इंजीनियरिंग के लिए दाखिला लिया. वह काफी मेधावी स्टूडेंट थे. इंजीनियरिंग करने के साथ ही सुशांत ने श्यामक डावर डांस क्लास में भी एडमिशन कराया और ऐसा जलवा बिखेरा कि साल 2005 में उन्हें श्यामक डावर डांस ग्रुप के साथ 51वें फिल्मफेयर अवॉर्ड में बैकग्राउंड डांसर बनने का मौका मिला. यहीं पर सुशांत की किस्मत पलटी और बॉलीवुड की चकाचौंध का उनका ऐसा प्रभाव पड़ा कि उन्होंने सोच लिया कि बनना है तो एक्टर ही. इसके बाद सुशांत सिंह ने इंजीनियरिंग छोड़ दी और मुंबई चले गए. सुशांत सिंह के जीवन पर शाहरुख खान का काफी प्रभाव था. दिल्ली कनेक्शन ने दोनों की किस्मत को एक रास्ते पर ला खड़ा किया था.</p>
<p>इंजीनियरिंग छोड़ एक्टर बनने मुंबई चले गए</p>
<p>साल 2006 की शुरुआत, मुंबई आने के बाद सुशांत सिंह ने नादिरा बब्बर के थिएटर ग्रुप ‘एकजुट’ को जॉइन किया और पूरी तरह एक्टिंग पर फोकस किया. सुशांत लगभग ढाई साल तक मुंबई में अपना सिक्का जमाने की कोशिश करते दिखे और आखिरकार एक दिन उन्हें नेस्ले का ऐड मिला और इस ऐड ने उन्हें देशभर में फेमस कर दिया. एक गुड लुकिंग लड़का, जो अच्छा डांस भी कर लेता और अच्छा बोल लेता है. सुशांत की मेहनत और कोशिश को बाद में टीवी इंडस्ट्री की क्वीन मानी जाने वालीं एकता कपूर ने परखा और फिर सुशांत की किस्मत रंग लाई.</p>
<p>साल 2008 में एकता कपूर की बालाजी टेलीफिल्म्स के बैनर तले बने टीवी सीरियल ‘किस देश में है मेरा दिल’ में सुशांत को पहली बार ब्रेक मिला. हालांकि इस सीरियल में सुशांत के लिए ज्यादा कुछ था नहीं, लेकिन एंटरटेनमेंट इंडस्ट्री को एक हीरा मिल चुका था. जून 2009 में एकता कपूर ने अपने फेमस सीरियल ‘पवित्र रिश्ता’ में सुशांत सिंह राजपूत को मानव का किरदार दिया और इस कैरेक्टर ने अपनी बेहतरीन अदाकारी और सादगी से ऐसा जादू चलाया कि मानव देशमुख घर-घर का प्यारा हो गया. इस दौरान को-एक्टर अंकिता लोखंडे से रिश्ते को लेकर भी सुशांत सिंह काफी चर्चा में रहे. जब सुशांत की गाड़ी चल पड़ी तो उन्हें जरा नचके दिखा और झलक दिखला जा जैसे टैलेंट हंट शो में भी शिरकत करने का मौका मिला, लेकिन सुशांत को तो फिल्म में काम करना था, इसलिए उन्होंने टीवी करियर छोड़ फिल्मों में हाथ आजमाना शुरू किया.</p>
<p>7 साल के फिल्मी करियर में बहुत कुछ किया</p>
<p>आखिरकार साल 2013 में सुशांत सिंह राजपूत ने अभिषेक कपूर की फिल्म ‘काई पो छे’ से बॉलीवुड डेब्यू किया और इस फिल्म ने वाकई सुशांत को हीरो बना दिया. बाद में सुशांत सिंह राजपूत को बड़े प्रोडक्शन हाउस की फिल्में मिलने लगी, जिसमें यशराज प्रोडक्शन की मनीष शर्मा निर्देशित फिल्म शुद्ध देशी रोमांस भी थी. शुद्ध देशी रोमांस में परीणिति चोपड़ा और वाणी कपूर के साथ सुशांत सिंह की जोड़ी काफी हिट रही और उन्हें चॉकलेटी बॉय माना जाने लगा. इसी समय बॉलीवुड में रणवीर सिंह और वरुण जैसे एक्टर का बोलबाला दिखने लगा था, लेकिन एक छोटे शहर के सुशांत ने अपनी एक्टिंग का ऐसा जादू बिखेरा था कि बड़े-बड़े डायरेक्टर्स उनके साथ काम करना चाहते थे. इसी कड़ी में साल 2014 में सुशांत सिंह के हाथ लगी राजकुमार हिरानी की फिल्म पीके. इस फिल्म में अपने छोटे किरदार में ही सुशांत इतने प्रभावी दिखे कि हर कोई उन्हें अगला शाहरुख खान मानने लगा. वाकई बंदे में दम थी, लेकिन!</p>
<p>‘धोनी’ ने दी अलग पहचान</p>
<p>सुशांत सिंह राजपूत को उनकी एक्टिंग करियर में सबसे बड़ा मुकाम मिला ‘महेंद्र सिंह धोनी: द अनटोल्ड स्टोरी’ से. नीरज पांडे की इस फिल्म में धोनी की शानदार एक्टिंग ने उन्हें सबका फेवरेट बना दिया. सुशांत की इस फिल्म ने 100 करोड़ रुपये से ज्यादा कमाया और उन्हें बॉलीवुड के ए लिस्टर स्टार की कैटिगरी में ला खड़ा किया. इस फिल्म के लिए सुशांत सिंह राजपूत को फिल्मफेयर बेस्ट एक्टर अवॉर्ड नोमिनेशन मिला था. साल 2017 सुशांत के लिए खास नहीं रहा और कृति सैनन के साथ आई उनकी फिल्म ‘राब्ता’ बुरी तरह पिट गई. फिल्मी गलियारों में तब तक कृति सैनन को सुशांत की गर्लफ्रैंड माना जाने लगा था, लेकिन उनका रिश्ता ज्यादा दूर जा नहीं पाया, जिसकी वजह से सुशांत काफी विवादों में भी रहे थे.</p>
<p>सोनचिड़िया और छिछोरे की एक्टिंग याद करेगी दुनिया</p>
<p>साल 2018 में सुशांत सिंह राजपूत को एक बार फिर से उनके मेन्टॉर माने जा रहे अभिषेक कपूर का साथ मिला और ‘केदारनाथ’ फिल्म में सारा अली खान के साथ सुशांत की जोड़ी हिट रही. इसके बाद साल 2019 में अभिषेक चौबे की फिल्म सोनचिड़िया में एक अपने चॉकलेटी किरदारों से अलग डाकू का किरार निभाकर सुशांत सिंह ने एक्टिंग के एक और पायदान को पार कर लिया. साल 2019 में सुशांत नेटफ्लिक्स फिल्म ड्राइव में दिखे, लेकिन यह फिल्म कुछ खास नहीं कर पाई. सुशांत के अचानक इस तरह दुनिया से चले जाने से बॉलीवुड को भारी क्षति हुई है. सुशांत आने वाले दिनों में कास्टिंग डायरेक्टर मुकेश छाबड़ा की फिल्म ‘दिल बेचारा’ के साथ ही साइंस फिक्शन फिल्म ‘चंदा मामा दूर के’ में आर. माधवन के साथ दिखने वाले थे. इससे इतर कई अन्य प्रोजेक्ट के साथ ही अपनी हालिया गर्लफ्रैंड रिया चक्रवर्ती को लेकर भी सुशांत अक्सर चर्चा में रहते थे. लेकिन इस तरह कौन भला चर्चा में आना चाहेगा खुद की जान देकर!</p>
<p>समय का पहिया किस करवट बैठ जाए, ये कोई कह नहीं सकता और आज बॉलीवुड से जुड़े लोग समेत सुशांत के करोड़ों फैंस यहीं महसूस कर रहे होंगे. एक ऐसा एक्टर, जिसने महज 34 साल की उम्र में अपनी अदाकारी से हमें मानव जैसा केयरिंग पति होना सिखाया, एक हरफनमौला क्रिकेटर होना सिखाया, छोटे शहरों से होते हुए भी बड़ा सपना देख बड़ा ऐक्टर होना सिखाया और अपने सपने को जीना सिखाया. सुशांत सिंह राजपूत ने किन कारणों से खुदकुशी का रास्ता अपनाया और अपनी जीवन लीला समाप्त की, ये तो आने वाला समय ही बताएगा, लेकिन बॉलीवुड ने एक नायाब हीरा खो दिया. साथ ही सुशांत का इस कदर जाना वैसे लोगों के लिए झटका है, जो सपने देखते हैं और एक्टिंग की दुनिया में नाम कमाना चाहते हैं.

<p>Chhichhore</p>
<p>Iyer Tiwari</p>
<p>In Photos: From Maanav in Pavitra Rishta to Annirudh in Chhichhore, roles that defined Sushant Singh Rajput 1 12 Tracing Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s life in films Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s tryst with the camera began with a chance sighting. Ekta Kapoor&rsquo;s casting team spotted him in a play by Nadira Babbar&rsquo;s theatre company and invited him to audition for a show. It set the ball rolling on the then-aspiring hero&rsquo;s career. A look: Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil (2008) Sushant made his television debut as Preet Juneja on this show. The character was killed early on, but was brought back as a spirit for the series finale, owing to his popularity. Pavitra Rishta (2009) The next year, he landed the lead role of Manav Deshmukh in the hit show, widely considered to be his breakout role and a stepping stone to films. While working on this Ekta Kapoor production, he also met his future girlfriend, Ankita Lokhande, who played the female lead. Kai Po Che! (2013) After participating in two dance-based reality shows— Zara Nachke Dikha 2 and Jhalak Dikhhla Ja 4—Sushant auditioned for this Abhishek Kapoor directorial, and bagged one of the three lead roles alongside Rajkummar Rao and Amit Sadh. His portrayal of former district-level cricketer Ishaan Bhatt, who falls prey to politics in the selection process, in the critical and commercial success earned him raves. Shuddh Desi Romance (2013) Sushant followed it up with this Maneesh Sharma-directed Parineeti Chopra and Vaani Kapoor co-starrer. The romance comedy-drama was set in Jaipur and revolved around youngsters’ take on love and live-in relationships. PK (2014) In Rajkumar Hirani’s satirical comedy-drama led by Aamir Khan and Anushka Sharma, Sushant had a brief yet notable role. Detective Byomkesh Bakshy (2015) Dibakar Banerjee’s mystery thriller featured the actor in the titular role, a character created by Bengali writer Sharanindu Bandopadhyay. Set in the Kolkata of the 1940s, the film was reportedly to get a sequel with Sushant reprising his role. MS Dhoni: The Untold Story (2016) Neeraj Pandey’s biographical drama that traces the journey of the eponymous former Indian skipper-wicket keeper saw Sushant take on another titular role. The film, which also featured Kiara Advani and Disha Patani, secured for Sushant his first Filmfare Best Actor nomination the following year. Raabta (2017) In Dinesh Vijan’s directorial debut, a reincarnation-themed romance actioner, Sushant was paired opposite Kriti Sanon and the duo played star-crossed lovers. The film featured Jim Sarbh, Rajkumar Yadav and Varun Dharma in supporting roles. Kedarnath (2018) The actor reunited with Abhishek ‘Gattu’ Kapoor to headline Sara Ali Khan’s launch vehicle. The inter-faith love story was set against the backdrop of the pilgrim site and revolved around a Muslim boy who falls in love with a rich Brahmin girl. Sonchiriya (2019) Co-written and directed by Abhishek Chaubey, the film is set in the Chambal ravines of 1975 and tells the story of a group of dacoits. It also featured Manoj Bajpayee, Bhumi Pednekar, Ranvir Shorey and Ashutosh Rana. Chhichhore (2019) Sushant followed it up with one of the biggest successes of his career with this Nitesh Tiwari-directed campus comedy-drama. The film won five Filmfare nods, including Best Film and Best Director. It was also Sushant’s last theatrical release.</p>
<p>The news that Sushant is no more is shocking. Yes, shocking would be the correct word to describe it as he was a person full of energy and enthusiasm. He wanted to do so many things, had so many plans, so when you hear one fine day that this person is no more, it’s hard to believe. I had to call a few friends to check if the speculation was true. Turned out it was a sad reality. And that made it even more shocking.I knew him before we collaborated on Chhichhore through common friends. I had met him on a few occasions before we started working together and grew close during the making of the film. He was like a younger brother to Ashwiny (, wife and director) and me; so full of life and excited about the projects he was doing. He wanted to launch some things. We exchanged m e s s a g e s around 10 days ago. It was just a casual chat; he enquired about Ashwiny and our kids and I asked him how he was doing. He shared that he was learning coding and I told him that my son, Aaradhya, was learning it too. As always, we ended our chat saying, “Keep in touch.”
