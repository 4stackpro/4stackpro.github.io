Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Remastered lets you revisit the campaign with fresh visuals, and you&rsquo;ll be rewarded with a special Trophy for your attention to detail in the first mission.</p>
<p>All you need to do to earn the Trophy is start the first mission, S.S.D.D., and make your way through the training course. Once you get to The Pit, you&rsquo;ll see General Shepherd standing up on an observation platform to the left of the entrance between two soldiers. All you need to do to avert his tragic betrayal is line it up and take the shot. Of course, it still counts as friendly fire at this point, so you&rsquo;ll fail the mission and start over at the last checkpoint. But then you&rsquo;ll see the &ldquo;Precognitive Paranoia&rdquo; Trophy pop up to reward you for your time-traveling vigilance.</p>
<p>This is a followup to Modern Warfare Remastered&rsquo;s famed Time Paradox trophy, which rewarded you for paradoxically sniping Makarov in Chernobyl back in 1996 before he could take his proper place as the big bad in the Modern Warfare sequels. It turns out Modern Warfare 2 Remastered has another call back (or call forward) to Modern Warfare 3 in its new version of No Russian.</p>
<p>In the course of playing Modern Warfare 3, you take control of Yuri as he tries to prevent the airport massacre perpetrated by Makarov&rsquo;s ultranationalists. He ends up passing out from blood loss as he witnesses the tail end of the atrocity. It was a bit of a ret-con because you never saw Yuri at the airport in Modern Warfare 2 - but now you do.</p>
<p>As you can see in this video, after riding down the escalators near security you can turn to the left and see Yuri stagger forward a bit before dropping. You can also shoot near his feet to make him pop back up, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s meant to be canonical.

<h3 id="call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-has-been-remastered-and-is-out-today">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has been remastered and is out today</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wuhskss57h1LdOb20_QCADDcye8=/0x20:1024x556/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19862297/CoD_MW2_Remastered.jpg" alt="img">
After years of speculation, a remastered version of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2’s single-player campaign is finally here, bringing an enhanced version of one of the most iconic FPS games of the late 2000s onto modern hardware.</p>
<p>The enhanced version of Modern Warfare 2 only includes the single-player campaign. The remastered version adds high-definition visuals and audio improvements to the original story from 2009, according to a blog post by Activision. The game is available digitally on PS4 for $19.99 and will be a timed exclusive until April 30th, when it launches on PC and Xbox One, though preorders are currently not available at this time.</p>
<p>‘Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2’ was originally released in November 2009</p>
<p>PS4 owners who purchase the remastered Modern Warfare 2 — which, it should be noted, is not a sequel to last year’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare — will also get in-game items in both the 2019 game and the battle royale spinoff Warzone, which launched earlier this month. Some items featured in the bundle include a new character skin as well as a couple of weapon blueprints, which grant you access to stronger weapons without having to earn them through progression.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 was originally released in November 2009 and is often regarded as one of the best games of that year, thanks in part to its strong single-player narrative as well as a robust multiplayer mode. The title also ignited controversy over its optional fourth mission, “No Russian,” which had players take part in a terrorist attack.</p>
<p>After a remastered version of Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare was released in November 2016, many were speculating as to when its sequel would receive the same treatment. Microsoft made the original Modern Warfare 2 backwards compatible on Xbox One in late 2018, but Activision didn’t announce the game would be remastered before today.

With the NBA season suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic, many NBA players have a lot of newfound free time on their hands.</p>
<p>Including Trail Blazers point guard Anfernee Simons who has been streaming on Twitch games such as Madden and the newly released Call of Duty: Warzone. He&rsquo;s even streamed with Blazers Outsiders host Danny Marang lately.</p>
<p>We live!</p>
<p>Come join @AnferneeSimons and I on Twitch- it&rsquo;s full send it every time!https://t.co/upWXrsSF3hhttps://t.co/BuduLd9RUc</p>
<p>— Danny Marang (@DannyMarang) March 15, 2020</p>
<p>Given Ant&rsquo;s age of 20, it checks out he&rsquo;d be attracted to playing Call of Duty since he grew up in the golden age of Call of Duty between Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare up until Call of Duty Black Ops II during his late elementary to high school years.</p>
<p>The installment from that time that&rsquo;s usually seen in the highest regard is Activision&rsquo;s sequel to Modern Warfare; Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, which broke the record as the biggest entertainment launch in history at the time. In less than three months, the game had generated over a billion dollars in revenue and that doesn&rsquo;t include microtransactions.</p>
<p>Also, personally, as I&rsquo;m just a few years older than Simons, some of my fondest memories growing up was playing Modern Warfare 2 with my best friends online all night, so when a remaster of the game got leaked last month, I was hyped. The campaign was fun, but what made the game iconic was the most fun multiplayer the series has ever produced.</p>
<p>Well, Monday afternoon, the Playstation Store in Germany accidentally leaked the reveal trailer for a remastered version of Modern Warfare 2 with one catch: it&rsquo;s only the campaign which disappointed many, including Simons.</p>
<p>Story continues</p>
<p>How u gonna drop just the campaign? Y&rsquo;all playing with my emotions https://t.co/xS66EL0d4V — Anfernee Simons (@AnferneeSimons) March 30, 2020</p>
<p>How u gonna drop just the campaign? Y&rsquo;all playing with my emotions</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t alone in his disappointment.</p>
<p>If MW2 remastered is just campaign&hellip;</p>
<p>Like why?? One of the greatest multiplayer games to ever release and they bring back campaign. I swear game developers get more dumb every year.</p>
<p>— LG Randumb (@Randumb) March 30, 2020</p>
<p>Idk man, my hype level is not all there with MW2 campaign remastered. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, playing that legendary campaign with new graphics will be amazing, but for how long? 6 hours? IW releasing it without the most iconic multiplayer is such a tease. — Scope (@x_Scp) March 30, 2020</p>
<p>Someone even started a petition.</p>
<p>However, it makes sense for the game to not offer multiplayer since Call of Duty: Warzone, a multiplayer-only experience, came out earlier this month of March 10 to great success. Activision doesn&rsquo;t want to split the player base by offering two competing titles within the same franchise.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered will launch one day after the leak of the trailer on March 31, 2020.</p>
