Reynold Poernomo first appeared on MasterChef back in 2015.</p>
<p>And it seems the dessert king and his &lsquo;Zen vibes&rsquo; are a welcome return to the current series, with viewers flocking to Twitter to swoon over the 26-year-old chef.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, one fan wrote: &lsquo;Reynold is legit just out there doing wild stuff with dessert on his own. It&rsquo;s his world and we are all just living in it&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m soo in love!&rsquo; On Tuesday night, viewers swooned over MasterChef star Reynold Poernomo (pictured) on Twitter</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m soo in love with how unbothered Reynold is,&rsquo; another fan tweeted.</p>
<p>While a third commented: &lsquo;Reynold gets very little airtime because Gordon (Ramsay) has nothing to scream at him about, because why would you scream at a literal angel sent from heaven?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another admirer continued in the same theme: &lsquo;That wasn&rsquo;t liquid nitrogen guys, Reynold has actually ascended to the heavens to cook his dessert&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So in love&rsquo;: The 26-year-old chef, who rose to fame after he first appeared on the show back in 2015, was the subject of talk among female fans on Tuesday night</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s only two episodes in to the new series, it appears Reynold is once again establishing himself as a fan favourite.</p>
<p>However, while he became known as the &lsquo;king of desserts&rsquo; during his last run on the program, he is hoping his return to the show will prove he can do more than that this time around.</p>
<p>Speaking to The Daily Telegraph on Saturday, Reynold said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got my businesses name to uphold and my family&rsquo;s name to make sure they are proud of me&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got a name to uphold&rsquo;: The MasterChef star admitted this week that he&rsquo;s taking a gamble returning to the hit show and wants to prove he can &lsquo;do more than just desserts&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;People have always just recognised me as the dessert guy&hellip; I want to prove I can do more than just that,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Since his original stint on the hit cooking program, Reynold has opened an award-winning dessert bar in Sydney called KOI, with his brothers Ronald and Arnold.</p>
<p>And if his Instagram is anything to go by, he&rsquo;s been dating girlfriend Chelia Dinata since 2018.</p>
<p>MasterChef continues Wednesday at 7.30pm on Channel 10</p>

Reynold Poernomo has admitted that he&rsquo;s taking a gamble by returning to MasterChef this year.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old - who is known for his sweet treats - told The Daily Telegraph on Saturday that he has a &lsquo;name to uphold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The TV star first appeared on the show back in 2015 and became known as the &lsquo;king of desserts,&rsquo; but wants to prove that he can do more than that.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got a name to uphold&rsquo;: MasterChef&rsquo;s Reynold Poernomo admitted this week that he&rsquo;s taking a gamble returning to the hit show and wants to prove he can &lsquo;do more than just desserts&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got my businesses name to uphold and my family&rsquo;s name to make sure they are proud of me,&rsquo; Reynold told the publication.</p>
<p>He added: &lsquo;People have always just recognised me as the dessert guy&hellip; I want to prove I can do more than just that,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Since his original stint on the hit cooking programme, Reynold has gone on to open an award-winning dessert bar in Sydney called KOI, with his brothers Ronald and Arnold.</p>

<p>Reynold will be competing against an all-star cast of returning favourites in MasterChef Australia: Back To Win, including season one runner-up Poh Ling Yeow.</p>
<p>The talented pastry chef recently revealed earlier this month that the hit program is pressing forward with filming, despite the current COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>Speaking to Hit105&rsquo;s Stav, Abby and Matt, Poh said Channel 10 had no plans to shut down or postpone, production of the ratings hit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;re following all the government regulations&rsquo;: Poh Ling Yeow (pictured) confirmed MasterChef Australia has adapted to coronavirus rules as they continue filming Channel Ten&rsquo;s 2020 season of the cooking show in Melbourne</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s going ahead following all the government regulations for the virus,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>Poh, who hosts her own SBS program: Poh &amp; Co, said all 24 contestants were social-distancing on set by staying 1.5 metres away from each other while competing.</p>
<p>MasterChef - Back To Win will see 24 contests from past seasons of the show return to the kitchen in a bid to win a cash prize of $250,000.</p>
<p>The contestants include Poh, Reynold, Hayden Quinn and Callum Hann.</p>
<p>The new judges are former MasterChef contestant Andy Allen, Jock Zonfrillo and Melissa Leong.</p>
<p>MasterChef Australia: Back To Win premiers at 7:30pm on Monday on Channel 10.

<h3 id="why-masterchefs-reynold-poernomo-has-reopened-restaurants-amid-coronavirus-restrictions">Why MasterChef&rsquo;s Reynold Poernomo Has Reopened Restaurants Amid Coronavirus Restrictions</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e8bdb8b250000b3066b749e.png?ops=1200_630" alt="img">
After closing the doors on his two restaurants following the government’s strict no dine-in rule, ‘MasterChef Australia’ star Reynold Poernomo has revealed why he’s back in business. The 26-year-old’s two Koi Dessert Bars in Sydney’s Chippendale and Ryde have reopened for takeaway and delivery ahead of the Easter long weekend, a decision Reynold made to save his livelihood.</p>
<p>Last month Prime Minister Scott Morrison said pubs, registered and licensed clubs, gyms and indoor sporting venues would shut down, while restaurants and cafes will be limited to takeaway orders only. With “no specific dates” surrounding these social distancing rules, Reynold said the waiting game wasn’t practical for him and his brothers, whom he opened the restaurants with. “We weren’t sure, the government didn’t really say anything about how long this lockdown would be,” he told HuffPost Australia.</p>
<p>Channel 10 MasterChef Australia&rsquo;s Reynold Poernomo</p>
<p>“We thought about it like, ‘Yeah we can’t just sit around and do nothing. We need to do something’. “It’s getting really boring and everyone in isolation was very bored,” he explained. “There’s a lot of home cooking happening and it’s time for us to come get back into work and support our staff as well, and of course support ourselves.”</p>
<p>Reynold’s two Koi Dessert Bars and savoury restaurant Monkey’s Corner have reopened for takeaway and delivery because, “We can’t forget Easter, we’ve already planned Easter with what we wanted to do”, he explained. ″[It’s] our cakes and it’s something that we don’t want to miss out&hellip;. we’ve always got delivery and we’re making sure that over the Easter weekend, people can enjoy their desserts while they watch MasterChef.”
