China has sent a team to North Korea including medical experts to check on Kim Jong-un, according to three people familiar with the situation.</p>
<p>The trip by the Chinese doctors and officials comes amid conflicting reports about the health of the North Korean ruler. It was not immediately clear what the trip by the Chinese team signalled in terms of Kim’s health.</p>
<p>A delegation led by a senior member of the Chinese Communist party’s international liaison department left Beijing for North Korea on Thursday, two of the people told Reuters.</p>
<p>The department is the main Chinese body dealing with neighbouring North Korea. The sources declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter.</p>
<p>The liaison department could not be reached for comment late on Friday. China’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment late on Friday.</p>
<p>Daily NK, a Seoul-based website, reported earlier this week that Kim was recovering after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure on 12 April. It cited one unnamed source in North Korea.</p>
<p>South Korean government officials and a Chinese official with the liaison department challenged subsequent reports suggesting that Kim was in grave danger after surgery.</p>
<p>South Korean officials said they had detected no signs of unusual activity in North Korea.</p>
<p>On Thursday the US president, Donald Trump, also played down earlier reports that Kim was gravely ill. “I think the report was incorrect,” Trump told reporters, but he declined to say if he had been in touch with North Korean officials.</p>
<p>On Friday a South Korean source told Reuters their intelligence was that Kim was alive and would likely make an appearance soon. The person said he did not have any comment on Kim’s current condition or any Chinese involvement.</p>
<p>An official familiar with US intelligence said that Kim was known to have health problems but they had no reason to conclude he was seriously ill or unable eventually to reappear in public.</p>
<p>The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, when asked about Kim’s health on Fox News after Trump spoke, said: “I don’t have anything I can share with you tonight, but the American people should know we’re watching the situation very keenly.”</p>
<p>North Korea is one of the world’s most isolated and secretive countries, and the health of its leaders is treated as a matter of state security. Reuters was not able to independently confirm any details on Kim’s whereabouts or condition.</p>
<p>North Korea’s state media last reported on Kim’s whereabouts when he presided over a meeting on 11 April. State media did not report that he was in attendance at an event to mark the birthday of his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, on 15 April, an important anniversary in North Korea.</p>
<p>Kim, believed to be 36, has disappeared from coverage in North Korean state media before. In 2014 he vanished for more than a month and North Korean state TV later showed him walking with a limp. Speculation about his health has been fanned by his heavy smoking, apparent weight gain since taking power and family history of cardiovascular problems.</p>
<p>When Kim Jong-un’s father, Kim Jong-il, suffered a stroke in 2008, South Korean media reported at the time that Chinese doctors were involved in his treatment along with French physicians.</p>
<p>In 2019 Xi Jinping made the first state visit in 14 years by a Chinese leader to North Korea, which depends on Beijing for economic and diplomatic support.</p>
<p>China is North Korea’s chief ally and the economic lifeline for a country hard hit by UN sanctions, and has a keen interest in the stability of the country with which it shares a long, porous border.</p>
<p>Kim is a third-generation hereditary leader who came to power after his father Kim Jong-il died in 2011 from a heart attack. He has visited China four times since 2018.</p>
<p>Trump held unprecedented summits with Kim in 2018 and 2019 as part of a bid to persuade him to give up North Korea’s nuclear arsenal.

<h3 id="why-the-confusion-about-kim-jong-uns-health-actually-makes-sense">Why the confusion about Kim Jong Un&rsquo;s health actually makes sense</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200421005544-30-kim-jong-un-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) Confusing and sometimes conflicting reports emerged Tuesday about the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. That was followed by intense speculation on his whereabouts, his medical condition and the future of the world&rsquo;s only hereditary communist state.</p>
<p>Initial rumblings began after North Korea&rsquo;s most important holiday came and went on April 15 without an appearance by Kim, which was unusual.</p>
<p>Then Daily NK, an online publication based in South Korea that focuses on the north, reported that Kim had received a cardiovascular system procedure on April 12, and was being treated in a villa in Hyangsan County.</p>
<p>CNN was unable to confirm the report, but a US official said that Washington is monitoring intelligence that suggests Kim is in grave danger after undergoing a previous surgery. A second source familiar with the intelligence told CNN that the US has been closely monitoring reports on Kim&rsquo;s health.</p>
<p>But a South Korean official told CNN that Kim is &ldquo;believed to be in other parts of North Korea than Pyongyang with other North Korean top officials,&rdquo; and &ldquo;no unusual signs supporting reports about his health conditions have been detected.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s rare for the South Korean government to divulge information about Kim&rsquo;s whereabouts.</p>
<p>The truth is, few people outside of Kim&rsquo;s inner circle know for sure &ndash; his daily routine and health are some of North Korea&rsquo;s most closely guarded secrets. In that environment, rumors and misinformation are almost inevitable.</p>
<p>The young North Korean leader is revered almost like a deity within the country, and he&rsquo;s protected as such &ndash; just think back to the images of Kim&rsquo;s bodyguards running alongside his limousine during his meetings with other world leaders in 2018. His movements and whereabouts are protected with an intense secrecy unmatched in much of the world. Even discussing rumors or misinformation about his health can get you in trouble with the state&rsquo;s security services, experts say.</p>

<p>Andrei Lankov, a professor at Kookmin University in South Korea and an expert in North Korean affairs, says very few people know the intimate details of Kim&rsquo;s personal life &ndash; and they are &ldquo;not inclined to talk about it, because they would much prefer to remain alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a very murky business,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They (people close to Kim) have very little to gain by telling everybody what they know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The debate about Kim&rsquo;s health and whereabouts is a timely reminder on an important caveat that should accompany nearly all stories on the inner workings of North Korea: The country is a black hole when it comes to gathering independent and trustworthy news.</p>
<p>Very few details about North Korea are revealed that are not state-sanctioned. Those who have fled the country offer invaluable insight, but defection can take weeks, months &ndash; even years. Experts and analysts who study North Korea rely on everything from satellite images of personnel movements to a line-by-line analysis of state media dispatches to find out the truth.</p>
<p>NK News, a well-respected English-language North Korean monitoring website, even runs a North Korean Leadership Tracker which allows users to see the number of appearances or mentions of Kim and other high-ranking leaders in state media.</p>
<p>Speculation about the leader&rsquo;s health or whereabouts is often educated guesswork, and it often turns out to be wrong. But there are two major reasons why it happens so regularly.</p>
<p>No apparent heir</p>
<p>Any conjecture about Kim&rsquo;s death usually feeds into a popular narrative of North Korea as a modern-day Shakespearean tragedy.</p>
<p>The country has been ruled as a hereditary dictatorship since its founding in 1948 by Kim Il Sung. His son, Kim Jong Il, took over after his father&rsquo;s death in 1994. And Kim Jong Un took power 17 years later when Kim Jong Il died. Their eventual takeovers were telegraphed to the public before their respective fathers&rsquo; deaths.</p>
<p>But Kim&rsquo;s three children are not believed to have reached adulthood yet. Even if one was being groomed for future leadership, the child would need some sort of regent to rule in an interim capacity &ndash; something that&rsquo;s never happened in North Korea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a monarchy officially. It&rsquo;s a monarchy for all practical purposes,&rdquo; Lankov said.</p>
<p>Michael Madden, an expert on North Korea&rsquo;s leadership, believes there are about 10 to 20 different scenarios that could play out should Kim be incapacitated, though cautioned against reading the tea leaves too much.</p>
<p>He said it&rsquo;s possible North Korea could choose to follow the model the Soviet Union did after the death of Joseph Stalin, another communist dictator who ruled by cult of personality, and turn to some form of collective leadership. It would likely be led Kim Jong Un&rsquo;s sister and close aide, Kim Yo Jong, an it&rsquo;s possible the body would serve until Kim Jong Un&rsquo;s heir is old enough to take the reins.</p>
<p>JUST WATCHED Everything we know about Kim Jong Un&rsquo;s sister (2018) Replay More Videos &hellip; MUST WATCH Everything we know about Kim Jong Un&rsquo;s sister (2018) 01:10</p>
<p>Kim Yo Jong has been one of the most visible members of her brother&rsquo;s leadership team since her trip to the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea, save for a few months when she disappeared from the public eye. The other option within the family is Kim Jong Un&rsquo;s other brother, Kim Jong Chol, but he is best known as an Eric Clapton fan and is not as involved in politics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The continuity of the regime is the key,&rdquo; Madden said.</p>
<p>Madden said it&rsquo;s important to note that though North Korea may not have a transparent, well-defined succession plan, &ldquo;in terms of continuity of government, they have that setup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the reason they have that setup is because they have nuclear weapons, they have got to maintain constant command and control over the nuclear weapons assets,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>The nuclear question</p>
<p>The security and question of what happens to North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear weapons in the event of some sort of leadership transition is likely the one that concerns officials in Washington, Seoul and Beijing.</p>
<p>Most countries aim to share what Vipin Narang, a professor of political science at MIT and expert in nuclear weapons issues and strategy, calls a &ldquo;Goldilocks position on their nuclear weapons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;States want the public and others to know just enough. They want to be transparent about the capability, but kind of opaque about the procedures and the actual line of deployment to enhance deterrence,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear weapons are another closely guarded secret inside the country. Little is known about how many Pyongyang has, how reliable they are, if its missiles and submarines could successfully fire them or even how Kim oversees their command and control apparatus. Intelligence experts estimate Pyongyang has dozens of warheads based on the amount of radioactive material produced at its nuclear weapons facilities, but the exact number is unclear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know a lot about how they manage their nuclear weapons during peacetime,&rdquo; Narang said.</p>
<p>Though North Korea is still technically at war with the South and the United States, many of Pyongyang&rsquo;s nuclear weapons may be sitting disassembled and &ldquo;there are probably very few ready systems,&rdquo; Narang said.</p>
<p>But Narang said he wouldn&rsquo;t be terribly concerned about the security of North Korea&rsquo;s nuclear weapons in the event Kim died of natural causes. Kim is, by most accounts, not a healthy man. He is overweight, under stress and was reported to be a heavy drinker at meetings with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m usually pessimistic,&rdquo; Narang said, &ldquo;but you have a guy who&rsquo;s obese, a chronic smoker, has gout, presumably some form of diabetes. They&rsquo;ve surely thought about this contingency given his health. And with Kim Yo Jong assuming a much greater role, it&rsquo;s possible they&rsquo;ve already thought about what succession look like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While those poor lifestyle choices do not mean Kim is knocking on death&rsquo;s door by any stretch, when combined with his absence it does remind policy and intelligence officials with a stake in North Korea&rsquo;s future that they should at least be thinking about an important but uncomfortable question: How exactly does a leader lionized as a near demigod hand over the reins, whether he goes under anesthesia for a medical procedure or in the event of his death?</p>
<p>The truth is few people &ndash; if any &ndash; outside the country know for sure. But the answers carry significant implications for officials from Beijing to Seoul to Washington, because they must consider whether Kim would leave behind a massive power vacuum in a state that has successfully tested nuclear weapons, and the intercontinental-range ballistic missiles to deliver them.
