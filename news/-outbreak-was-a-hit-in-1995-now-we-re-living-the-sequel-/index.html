Right behind it, at No. 5, was John Sayles’s “The Secret of Roan Inish,” a departure from Sayles’s ambitious social-realist dramas, like “Eight Men Out” and “City of Hope.” This one’s a quiet Irish fable with a whiff of magic. Sayles never gets talked about in the same breath as Scorsese, Spike Lee and Woody Allen. He was, locationally speaking, New Jersey to their New York. But he’s feeling and intelligent and maybe the best white American filmmaker ever to consistently consider race and class as systemic, historical and personal matters. He gets it. Naturally, one of his biggest hits had nothing to do with any of that.</p>
<p>But it might be hard to remember during these keyed-up times — when good HR is as crucial to a movie’s moral success as a great trailer is to its commercial prospects — that, in the ’90s, movies with nonwhite people and stories about race weren’t rare. I don’t know if the folks who made “Man of the House” (an obnoxious hit at No. 6, in its fourth week out) know it’s a movie about a kind of whiteness, but Jonathan Taylor Thomas, at peak Tiger Beat swag, giving his mom’s new boyfriend the business, feels like WASP karma, because the boyfriend is played by Chevy Chase. And an ensemble divorced-dude comedy like “Bye Bye Love,” with Paul Reiser, Matthew Modine, and Randy Quaid and down at No. 10, is, by 2020 standards, practically a privilege-palooza and, by 1995 standards, not unfunny.</p>
<p>That week’s Top 10 was also full of movies with black actors in big and small parts. Down at No. 8 and 9 were “Just Cause” and “Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh,” (street name: “Candyman 2”) two movies about racism. They’re terrible. And even though they revolve around white people — Sean Connery in the first; Kelly Rowan, a dead ringer for Bridget Fonda, in the other — they need to be seen to be believed. “Just Cause,” in its sixth week out, has Connery as a retired lawyer trying to get Blair Underwood off Florida’s death row for the rape and dismemberment of a white girl.

(CNN) Get ready to possibly be even more freaked out.</p>
<p>With all the coverage of and conversation surrounding the coronavirus, the anniversary of the film &ldquo;Outbreak&rdquo; probably could have not come at a worse time.</p>
<p>The 1995 drama starring Dustin Hoffman, Morgan Freeman, Rene Russo and Cuba Gooding Jr. was released widely in the US on March 10, 1995.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how Netflix describes the movie : &ldquo;In this doomsday thriller, an Army virologist tries to thwart a global biological meltdown in the form of a killer virus infesting a California town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not really what we want to think about at the moment, right?</p>

<p><img src="https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/202029/rs_600x600-200309113322-600-outbreak-25th-anniversary-5.jpg?fit=around%7C600:467&amp;crop=600:467;center,top&amp;output-quality=90" alt="img">
How&rsquo;s this for timing?</p>
<p>As the planet deals with the spread of the coronavirus, now infecting more than 105,000 people in over 80 countries with over 3,600 succumbing to the potentially deadly virus since the start of January (as of March 8), a film depicting the Hollywood big budget version of the lengths some might go to contain such a pandemic is celebrating 25 years since first scaring the pants off audiences.</p>
<p>On March 10, 1995, Outbreak arrived in theaters, pitting heroes Dustin Hoffman and Rene Russo against the spread of a fictional, Ebola-like virus known as Motaba, brought to America by an African monkey, and villainous military leaders played by Donald Sutherland and Morgan Freeman. The film, directed by Wolfgang Petersen, was a smash hit. It also wasn&rsquo;t exactly the most accurate thing out there.</p>
<p>Unlike Stephen Soderbergh&rsquo;s 2011 hit Contagion, which more closely resembles the situation we all find ourselves in currently (albeit amped up to the nth dramatic degree), Outbreak was deemed by disease expert and ecologist for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Brian Amman to be the least accurate portrayal of disease outbreak in modern film and TV.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one has so many flaws,&rdquo; he told Wired in October. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s total chaos. It&rsquo;s a mess. It&rsquo;s pure Hollywood fiction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(And if you&rsquo;re panicked that anything you&rsquo;ve seen in films from Outbreak to Contagion might happen with COVID-19, Amman had this to say: &ldquo;Viruses that you&rsquo;ve seen in these clips are basically Hollywood fiction, and the real-life viruses that are out there are hardly ever, if at all, as fast-acting as what you&rsquo;ve just seen in these clips.&quot;)
