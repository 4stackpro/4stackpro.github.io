U.S. President Donald Trump has this week enrolled WWE owner, chairman and former part-time wrestler Vince McMahon as one of his advisers to reopen the nation’s economy.</p>
<p>No, we’re not going back to revisit the WrestleMania 23 match in which Donald Trump received a stunner from Stone Cold Steve Austin and helped shave Vince McMahon bald, or at least we hope not.</p>
<p>Instead, McMahon is one of several “key” figures from a number of industries that include sport, agriculture, banking, retail and technology, announced as members of the Great American Economic Revival Industry Group.</p>
<p>This comes after the news that WWE was listed under “key businesses” which are to keep plying their trade during these uncertain times.</p>
<p>So uncertain that WWE laid off dozens of wrestlers and off-screen talent yesterday in the company’s biggest cull for quite some time.</p>
<p>WWE has been running their weekly shows, including RAW, SmackDown! and NXT, from their Performance Center, as well as hosting WrestleMania over two nights in front of no fans.</p>
<p>Big names will form this stable, including Amazon owner Jeff Bezos, Tesla owner Elon Musk, Apple CEO Tim Cook amongst many others including Mark Zuckerberg and Dana White.</p>
<p>Informing the world’s press, Trump said: &ldquo;Now, we have a list of people that I&rsquo;ll be speaking to over the next very short period of time, in many cases, tomorrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a list of different industries that I&rsquo;ll be discussing by, meeting by telephone, because we don&rsquo;t want people travelling right now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are the names we have on our list. The names that are, I think, the best and the smartest, the brightest, and they&rsquo;re going to give us some ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>American sports franchises haven’t avoided membership, as Trump had announced chiefs from the NBA, NFL, MLB that were part of the group whilst New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was also named.</p>
<p>Trump has yet to reveal which members will take on certain roles and what those roles will wholly entail.</p>
<p>During the press briefing, Trump revealed the importance of sports following the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;We have to get our sports back, I&rsquo;m tired of watching baseball games that are 14 years old. I haven&rsquo;t actually had too much time to watch - I would say maybe I watch one batter and then I get back to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The White House released a press release that read: &ldquo;These bipartisan groups of American leaders will work together with the White House to chart the path forward toward a future of unparalleled American prosperity.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="for-hate-of-a-sneeze-why-the-wwe-is-still-live-during-a-pandemic">For Hate of a Sneeze: Why the WWE is Still Live During a Pandemic</h3>
<p><img src="https://images1.houstonpress.com/imager/u/original/11465772/1.26.2020_wwe_royalrumble_hou_jackgorman-197.jpg" alt="img">
Of all the things that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis thought he might end up talking about during a pandemic, one imagines that World Wrestling Entertainment was not a subject near the top of the list. &ldquo;Controversy&rdquo; isn’t the right word, but many an eyebrow was raised recently when it was announced that the company was considered an “essential service” by the state, meaning they could have their workers resume live television production. As pro wrestling involves physical contact, holding matches during a pandemic seems to some to be reckless at best and dangerous at worst, especially given the news that at least one on-air talent had tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Surely the Governor would have a good answer for this; with many small businesses closed, there’d have to be a compelling reason to let a company from out of state (the WWE is headquartered in Connecticut) operate while local businesses remained shuttered. You can listen to his reasoning for yourself, and decide if his word salad about “content” makes him sound like anything other than the social media guy at a third rate Buzzfeed knock off.</p>
<p>Many have suggested since the news about their return to live TV broke that the WWE’s return to the airwaves has less to do with the public good and more to do with the fact that company owner Vince McMahon’s wife Linda McMahon is the head of a SuperPac that is going to spend millions of dollars in Florida on behalf of President Trump. The announcement that her SuperPac will be spending $18.5 million in the state happened the same day the Governor decided that wrestling was a thing allowed in the state as long as there was no audience present.</p>
<p>Truth is though that the “how?” of WWE’s return to live television is less interesting than the “why?” of their return to live television. The WWE is putting at risk not just the health of their performers but the goodwill the company had built up over the last few weeks. Their decision to run Wrestlemania, their biggest show of the year, in an empty gym, came with no small amount of debate among wrestling fans, but against all odds, they managed to deliver one of the best Wrestlemanias of all time while managing to comply with Florida’s regulations on social distancing at that time. Putting on a good Wrestlemania is hard to do even with the best health and economic conditions, so what they pulled off felt like a minor miracle of sorts.</p>
<p>So what is to gain by pulling their workers back from home and putting them back on television to punch and yell and sweat? The obvious answer is that it’s a calculated business decision; they have TV time they’re obligated to fill with live content, and failure to meet that obligation would cost the company millions of dollars. Vince McMahon has already lost the XFL to this pandemic - the league recently declared bankruptcy - so keeping his television partners happy has to be a thing that looms large in his mind. But if you’re the type of person that follows the behind the scenes action that really makes wrestling a hobby worth following, Vince McMahon’s decision to start putting his workers back in the ring during a global pandemic seems like the most Vince McMahon thing he could do for one simple reason.</p>
<p>Vince McMahon hates sneezing.</p>
<p>Everyone has something weird that drives them mad, and for Vince McMahon it’s sneezing. While some under his employ have chalked his dislike of the bodily function to simply thinking it is a gross thing to do, his daughter is on record as stating that McMahon sees sneezing as a bad thing because it’s something he can’t control, something closer to a personal weakness rather than an involuntary thing our bodies do on a regular basis. It&rsquo;s said that if you sneeze around McMahon, don&rsquo;t bother telling him anything for at least 20 minutes because he&rsquo;s not likely to take you seriously.</p>
<p>A global pandemic must rank pretty high on the list of worst-case scenarios for McMahon. For someone who yearns for complete control over his body and business, a disease that causes involuntary bodily responses while also taking away his ability to do business the way he sees fit is the ultimate body blow. McMahon can only respond the only way he knows how: like a professional wrestler. Putting his workers back In the ring is thumb to the eye of a more powerful opponent, a way to take back control from a situation that made him feel less powerful. It&rsquo;s not without risks, but if time has proven anything, it&rsquo;s that Vince McMahon knows how to navigate tragedy and come out largely unscathed.</p>
<p>The same day the governor of Florida was answering questions about the WWE, Vince McMahon came up during a different political press conference. He’s part of a group talking to President Trump about how to bring sports back to America. Trump even went as far as to label McMahon as “great” when mentioning him by name. A pandemic may have slowed him down, but Vince McMahon refuses to let anything stop him. Not a pandemic. Not a stay at home order. Certainly not a sneeze.

<p><img src="https://i.insider.com/5e9775ccd5873a06ef2e0184?width=1200&amp;format=jpeg" alt="img">
WWE fans are livid with Vince McMahon and the company for firing dozens of wrestlers and other talent on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The company had been deemed an &ldquo;essential business&rdquo; by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, meaning it could continue to broadcast live shows from its facility as long as fans weren&rsquo;t in attendance.</p>
<p>WWE said in a statement that the personnel decisions were necessary cost reductions made in response to the coronavirus.</p>
<p>In the same statement, the company said it had &ldquo;substantial financial resources, both available cash and debt capacity, which currently total approximately $0.5 billion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Visit Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>WWE released a slew of wrestlers suddenly on Wednesday, including Kurt Angle, Drake Maverick, Curt Hawkins, Karl Anderson, Luke Gallows, Heath Slater, Zack Ryder, and more. Several producers and other talent were let go as a part of the cuts as well.</p>
<p>In a statement, WWE wrote that &ldquo;the implementation of various short-term cost reductions and cash flow improvement actions including&rdquo; was necessary due to the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Given the uncertainty of the situation, the Company also identified headcount reductions and made the decision to furlough a portion of its workforce effective immediately,&rdquo; the statement read.</p>
<p>The decision to fire so many performers was especially shocking as WWE had just been deemed an &ldquo;essential business&rdquo; by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, meaning the company would be allowed to continue taping live shows from its Florida studios and thus maintain its profitable television contracts with Fox and USA Network.</p>
<p>To the state government, McMahon&rsquo;s business was essential and thus could continue to operate as close to normal as possible despite a statewide stay-at-home order. But to his employees, McMahon was facing dire financial repercussions due to the pandemic, and severe cuts were necessary in order to keep the company afloat.</p>
<p>Viewed together, the two ideas did not compute.</p>
<p>In the same statement that announced WWE&rsquo;s planned cuts, the company also wrote that it had &ldquo;substantial financial resources, both available cash and debt capacity, which currently total approximately $0.5 billion, to manage the challenges ahead.&rdquo; With $500 million ready for use, the need to cut so many performers is tougher to justify.</p>
<p>Further clouding matters is McMahon&rsquo;s wife, Linda McMahon, runs a pro-Trump super PAC which recently committed $18.5 million in Florida markets.</p>
<p>On Twitter, fans voiced their displeasure with McMahon and the company and expressed their best wishes to the wrestlers who had suddenly lost their jobs.</p>

<p>In addition to the significant cuts made to WWE on Wednesday, McMahon is also currently dealing with the bankruptcy of his revamped XFL, which was forced to shut down all operations in response to the pandemic.</p>
