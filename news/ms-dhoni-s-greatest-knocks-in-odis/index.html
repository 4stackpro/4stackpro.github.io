April 5 marks the 15th anniversary of MS Dhoni &lsquo;s first international century - a knock that marked his arrival as the &ldquo;next big thing in Indian cricket&rdquo;.Overall, Dhoni has played 350 ODIs, with 10,773 runs and 10 centuries to his credit, with a highest score of an unbeaten 183 and an average of 50.57.Dhoni has not played since India&rsquo;s World Cup semi-final loss to New Zealand in July.Here is a look at the former Indian captain&rsquo;s greatest knocks in ODIs:After a few failures in his first four matches, Dhoni announced himself on the international stage with a swashbuckling innings against Pakistan, following captain Sourav Ganguly &lsquo;s decision to promote him to the No. 3 batting slot.India were chasing 299 to win against a Lankan side that had Vaas and Muralitharan . Dhoni plundered the attack to help the hosts win with 23 balls to spare.Perhaps Dhoni &lsquo;s most celebrated innings, coming as in it did in a World Cup final while chasing. MSD wasn&rsquo;t in the best of form till the final, but he promoted himself in the batting order to counter Sri Lanka&rsquo;s off-spinners. He made sure India won the World Cup after 23 years with an unforgettable six over long on.India were tottering at 154/6 but Dhoni made sure the team crossed the 300-run mark with another dominating innings peppered with his trademark &lsquo;helicopter&rsquo; shot.Dhoni came up with another entertaining and resourceful knock in the final of a tri-series also involving West Indies. India needed 202 to win the title and were reduced to 167-8. Dhoni farmed the strike brilliantly and took the match into the last over with 15 runs to win. Shaminda Eranga was given the task to bowl the final over and Dhoni flattened him with a sequence of 6, 4, 6 off the second, third and fourth deliveries. India won by 1 wicket.Another of Dhoni&rsquo;s last-over heroics. At the receiving end this time was Australian medium-pacer Clint McKay . India needed 13 to win off the last over and Dhoni clobbered a 112 metre, awe-inspiring maximum to win the match for India.

<p><img src="https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/20200404130057/GettyImages-1159557868.jpg" alt="img">
Indian Captain Virat Kohli and former England batsman Kevin Pietersen had a fun chat on Instagram live. The duo talked about a lot of things ranging from their playing together for RCB to Kohli’s nickname. The viewers also witnessed a cute banter between the two on Kevin being former Indian skipper MS Dhoni’s first test wicket.</p>
<p>There has been an ongoing trolling between MS Dhoni and Kevin Pietersen since 2011. The incident that happened was that Dhoni had Kevin caught behind the stumps during a test match in England in 2011. Since then Mahi refers to Pietersen as his first test wicket.</p>
<p>KP’s clarification to Virat Kohli</p>
<p>Kevin Pietersen brought up this issue during the live chat with Kohli on Thursday. He gave clarification on how he wasn’t out after a close DRS call. The England star also described Mahi’s bowling as ‘filth’.</p>
<p>Pietersen mentioned, “A lot of people told me, I am Dhoni’s first test wicket. I referred it &amp; I was given not out remember?”</p>
<p>However, Kohli was up for backing his former captain and gave a fitting reply to the England all-rounder.</p>
<p>Kohli replied,” Yeah, I know. Look the thing is, MS has a point, It came upon the stump mics and nothing came on the hotspot so he has a point.”</p>
<p>To this, a frustrated KP added, “Oh, you stop backing him.”</p>
<p>Here watch this hilarious conversation between KP and Virat Kohli:</p>
<p>MS Dhoni trolled on-air commentator Kevin Pietersen</p>
<p>This was not the first time this incident was brought into the limelight. Dhoni himself had once trolled Pietersen on the same.</p>
<p>It happened during a match between MS Dhoni’s Rising Pune Supergiant and Mumbai Indians in IPL 2017. Kevin Pietersen was preforming his commentary duties in that match. In between the match, KP requested on mic fielder Manoj Tiwari to give a message to his skipper MS Dhoni.</p>
<p>Kevin said, “Can you do me a favor? Can you just whisper MS that I’m a better golfer than him.”</p>
<p>Manoj Tiwari passed on this message to Dhoni who further replied to KP in his usual comical self.</p>
<p>Dhoni answered in the stump mic, “He is still my first Test wicket.”</p>
<p>Check a video of this banter:

<h3 id="what-ms-dhoni-was-curious-to-see-when-he-handed-over-india-captaincy-to-virat-kohli">What MS Dhoni was curious to see when he handed over India captaincy to Virat Kohli</h3>
<p><img src="https://d1u4oo4rb13yy8.cloudfront.net/book/66522-njolukddcq-1505164741.jpg" alt="img">
Kevin Pietersen interviewed Virat Kohli live on Instagram on Thursday, with the duo talking about an array of topics during the ongoing coronavirus lockdown.</p>
<p>One of the things they spoke about was Kohli’s leadership style and his aggressive attitude. Pietersen narrated a conversation he once had with former India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, where the latter reflected on the incumbent’s demeanour on the field.</p>
<p>“I was running on a treadmill once, it was around the time MS was finishing as captain, and he came and jumped on to a treadmill next me and we started talking,” said Pietersen. “We spoke about you and your leadership. One of the things that he said that would interest him would be to see whether or not you’re able to maintain that energy, excitement and aggressive leadership on the field.</p>
<p>“And I said to myself that surely you can’t love cricket that much that you start swinging punches every time you walk out on to the field. But you’ve done just that. Is it because of your diet or does it have to do with something in your head. I know there isn’t much up there (laughs).” added the former England cricketer.</p>
<p>Kohli was candid in his reply and explained why he does what he does. The India captain said that going all-out on the field is just who he is.</p>
<p>“There is a bit of crazy up here as well (laughs), I wouldn’t deny it,” said Kohli. “Look, you can ask MS as well, even when I played under him, I would be in his ear all the time – ‘maybe we can do this, maybe we could do that’. I would run from long-on to long-on each over, I wanted to be in the right place at the right time.</p>
<p>“Even now, it doesn’t matter if I’m captain or not, I don’t think I need to behave myself when I’m on the field. I need to be able to enjoy the game first and think about strategy and all later, because that is who I am. I cannot play any other way, I will give 120% on every ball. I have made a promise to myself – the day I can’t do things this way, I will stop playing.”</p>
<p>Kohli is known for celebrating wickets with plenty of excitement and the 31-year-old said that he simply can’t control himself in those moments.</p>
<p>“Bowlers say that I celebrate more than them when a wicket falls,” he said. “I just tell them that I can’t control myself. It’s a good thing, being an aggressive leader helps (laughs). If my teammates ever wonder if they should say something on the field, they just look at me and say to themselves: ‘no problem, go for it’.”
