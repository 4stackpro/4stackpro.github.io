<p>50 Cent may keep himself embedded in our pop culture dialogue by way of his extremely active social media accounts, however, for all intents and purposes he is a rather private person. Thus, when he revealed his girlfriend to the world in the summer of 2019, it received quite a bit of attention.For good reason, after all, Jamira Haines&ndash; better known as Cuban Link across social media and YouTube&ndash; is breath-taking. Since walking the red carpet together for the premiere of 50&rsquo;s popular TV show Power, the couple have hit more than one red carpet&ndash; she even joined Fif as he earned his Walk of Fame star&ndash; and they&rsquo;ve become frequent fodder on each other&rsquo;s social media channels.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, she&rsquo;s got the brains to match the beauty. Haines is reportedly studying to become a lawyer, in between gigs modeling and working on her personal fitness goals. We&rsquo;ve dedicated this IG Gallery to each of her pursuits, and even Fif makes a brief (trolling) appearance.</p>

<h3 id="snoop-dogg-shares-50-cents-mugshot-on-ig-fans-react">&ldquo;Snoop Dogg Shares 50 Cent’s Mugshot On IG, Fans React&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://urbanislandz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Snoop-Dogg-and-50-Cent.jpg" alt="img">
Snoop Dogg shared not just 50 Cent’s mugshot on the Gram but also his own and Tupac and Biggie Smalls.</p>
<p>Snoop Dogg’s own legal woes go back to the ’90s when he was frequently in and out of jail for possession and sale of drugs. In 1993, the “Gin &amp; Juice” rapper was arrested in connection with the death of a member of a rival gang who was shot and killed by Snoop’s bodyguard and has dealt with other arrests on charges of firearm possession, vandalization, and possession of illegal substances. Snoop is not hiding away from his shady past and has now shared his mug shot with the world as he seems to be in illustrious company.</p>
<p>The 48-year-old posted a black and white montage to Instagram that included his mug shot alongside that of Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G., and 50 Cent. All four players have had more than one arrest in their lifetimes, but Fifty is the only one who didn’t serve out jail time. A young Curtis Jackson was arrested in 1994 after he tried to sell cocaine to an undercover cop, and a search of his home turned up other drugs. Although he was sentenced to three to nine years in prison, the teenager instead served six months in a boot camp where he earned his school-leaving diploma.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know 50 cent got arrested in 1845,” one fan wrote while another added, “50 looks like he can read everybody’s thoughts.”</p>
<p>Snoop’s run-in with the law became ammunition for Tekashi 6ix9ine during their recent beef. Snoop declared the “GOOBA” rapper to be a rat for snitching on his Nine Trey Gangsta Blood gang members and 6ix9ine shot back by accusing Snoop of being a snitch himself and ratting out Suge Knight back in the day.

<h3 id="50-cent-explains-turning-off-ig-comments">&ldquo;50 Cent Explains Turning Off IG Comments&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://urbanislandz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/50-Cent-365.jpg" alt="img">
50 Cent is sick of all the bots on Instagram.</p>
<p>Followers of Fifty’s IG account are used to the rapper posting several pics a day. His feed is usually filled with memes, some trolling, and pictures of the man looking dapper, but his latest content has been focused on the atrocities in America in the wake of George Floyd’s murder.</p>
<p>It has been a heavy week in the U.S. as citizens of all colors take a stand against police brutality inflicted upon the African-American community and call for justice through mass protests. Fifty has been using his Insta account, which has 25.7 million followers, to raise awareness by posting videos along with social commentary.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for a post by the “Power” actor to receive comments in the range of two to three thousand, but Fifty has now declared that he is turning off that function. “I’m turning my comments off on IG too many Bots trying to sway public opinions,” he wrote alongside an image of someone wearing a Guy Fawkes mask that has become synonymous with the Anonymous hackers group which has recently threatened to expose the alleged crimes of the Minneapolis police to the public. Ironically, that post has received almost 2,000 comments itself.</p>
<p>Bots are not a new occurrence on social media. There have always been thousands of fake accounts that follow real accounts and typically post spam, but it seems that in light of the gravity of the situation at hand, Fifty is not keen to mess around. He has suggested that his fans rather follow him on Twitter instead, but has continued to post content on IG, including a black square to represent Blackout Tuesday — a campaign dedicated to urging people to refrain from posting on social media and take the time to educate themselves about the Black Lives Matter movement.

<p><img src="https://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2020/03/50-cent-coronavirus-health.jpg?w=1200" alt="img">
50 Cent hopped on social media today to address the attack of an Australian street painter who has created countless mash-up murals of Fif as other public figures.</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon (May 20), the 44-year-old rapper responded to artist Lushsux&rsquo;s claims that he was beaten for creating the artwork he made of 50 Cent. Fif denounces any connection to the incident that took place sometime this month. In an Instagram post, Fif shared a message to the street artist and his fans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The artist got 👊in the 😆that wasn&rsquo;t me I didn&rsquo;t do that. 😠#STARZ #BMF,&rdquo; 50 Cent wrote in a short caption of a photo showing an unfinished mural of the rapper as Oprah Winfrey. In another post, Fif shared the finished version of the mural, sending well wishes to the street artist.</p>
<p>50&rsquo;s comments come a day after Lushsux posted a message to Instagram claiming that a group of angry people attacked him. The artist uploaded the IG post shortly after 50 Cent posted a photo of Lushsux&rsquo;s mural of 50 as former boxer Mike Tyson, with a caption insisting the artist needs an &ldquo;ass whoppin’.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;50 seems to want some more walls?,&rdquo; Lushsux wrote in the IG caption. &ldquo;Unfortunately, some 6 or 7 smooth brains at one time on the street already put me in hospital already this month because of this shit. I don&rsquo;t like to bring up all the bad stuff I have to deal with just to paint some haha funny you laugh now images on walls, but I guess now is a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other claims made in the post, the portrait painter insists that despite the several attempts made to deter him from completing his artwork, he won&rsquo;t be stopped.</p>
<p>The artist, who has also painted murals of Doja Cat, Eminem and more, has yet to respond to Fif&rsquo;s latest comments. This isn&rsquo;t the first time the two men have gone back-and-forth via social media. In April, the rhymer responded to a portrait of himself and Donald Trump fused together that was created by Lushsux. Fif&rsquo;s response to the mash-up of himself and Trump was one of the many public statements he has has made about Lushsux&rsquo;s artwork since they started popping up in Australia and on the internet.

<h3 id="50-cent-breakup-with-cuban-link-kicked-her-out-his-mansion-report">&ldquo;50 Cent Breakup With Cuban Link, Kicked Her Out His Mansion: Report&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://urbanislandz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/50-Cent-and-Cuban-Link.jpg" alt="img">
Did 50 Cent dumped Cuban Link and kicked her out his mansion?</p>
<p>It’s looking likely that 50 Cent may have “broken” his Cuban Link if social media is to be believed. Coronavirus has been tough on relationships. With couples quarantining together and being in each other’s space 24/7, COVID-19 has claimed more casualties than just lives lost. The divorce rate saw a spike in China where the pandemic began, and even Saudi Arabian marriages have taken a hit as the enforced lockdown to curb the spread of the virus has left many break-ups in its wake. Now it seems as though Fifty and Cuban Link’s relationship may have bitten the bullet as well.</p>
<p>No one knew who the beauty was when she showed up on the New Yorker’s arm at the premiere of the sixth season of his show Power. But fans quickly learned that the lady was Jamira Haines, who most often went by her nickname and IG handle, Cuban Link.</p>
<p>The fitness trainer/aspiring lawyer began showing up on Fifty’s feed, and soon it was confirmed that she and the “Animal Ambition” rapper were an item. Over the past year, we’ve seen Cuban Link bring out Fifty’s sweet side, his sassy side, his jealous side, and his submissive side as the 25-year-old appears to have him wrapped around her little finger.</p>
<p>But it now appears as if the “power couple” is no more. While Fifty was once a common feature on her socials, Cuban has now deleted almost all evidence of her (former?) man and also posted a picture that made it seem as though she has moved back into her own apartment. Fifty is usually quite vocal on the ‘Gram and known to even troll, but has remained hush so far.</p>
<p>If the pair really have called it quits, we could be seeing a rather moody 50 Cent for the foreseeable future. In the meantime, Cuban Link is showing off all her glory on the Gram in her old apartment, perhaps even rubbing it in 50 Cent’s face.

<p>In early April 2020, the rap heavyweight gave Link a major ultimatum. Curtis Jackson told her she would either have to start cleaning around his place or be forced to leave and deal with the coronavirus epidemic on her own.</p>

New York rapper 50 Cent‘s girlfriend Cuban Link wants everyone to put positivity over negativity. The hip-hop veteran’s publicized boo went online this week to give motivation for people on their journeys to success.</p>
<p>Cuban x Motivate</p>
<p>On Sunday, Cuban Link hit up Instagram to share some new pics, give motivation and a thoughtful message. Cuban encouraged followers to trust the process and avoid letting stress or fear dominate their minds.</p>
<p>“.. .. everything will work out exactly how and when it’s supposed to if you allow the faith in your journey to be stronger than your doubts and fears! Be patient with yourself and your growth, knowing that (good things always take time). Give yourself time and space to try things and explore different paths .
