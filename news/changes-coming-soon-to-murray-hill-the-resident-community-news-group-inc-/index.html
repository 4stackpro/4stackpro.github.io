<p>Murray Hill’s thriving Edgewood corridor will soon get busier, as plans for new businesses, a new place for families to live, and preparation for new public artwork is put into place.</p>
<p>Residents will soon see the gap Jones College Edgewood campus once occupied fill up with a new retail storage unit complex and a new retail space. Meanwhile, plans are moving forward for the creation of a new residential complex on the current Bank of America site at 840 Edgewood Avenue South, and while all that is happening, the City has also put aside money for a public art display composed of synchronized lights at the Roosevelt Boulevard and Edgewood Avenue South overpass, although that will take longer to implement.</p>
<p>Developers plan to construct new retail spaces between Edgewood Avenue and a large, new storage building.</p>
<p>The first project to begin was the storage complex. In early June, crews began constructing the three-story, 97,000-square foot complex at Plymouth and Edgewood, with plans not far behind to create new retail space fronting Edgewood, filled with local business tenants.</p>
<p>Leed Silverfield, president of Jacksonville-based Silverfield Group, said the firm closed on the financing for the storage project at Edgewood and Plymouth at the end of May. It will eventually contain 788 units and be fronted by about 5,000 square feet of retail near Fishweir Brewing Company and across from Wok N Roll and the Stout Snug. Maitland-based Birchmier Construction is on the project, which will likely take about 11 months depending on weather and construction delays. New construction on the 5,000-square-foot retail portion of the project will probably not move forward until Silverfield Group identifies the tenants. That’s taking longer than normal as the economy re-opens after months of closures.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, the COVID effects, especially for retail and real estate, have really slowed things down – people are pushing the pause button,” Silverfield said. “Hopefully, as things start to normalize, we will get some interest.” Feedback from residents led to the setback of the storage units behind the planned retail facilities, so that pedestrians and motorists in the area see the retail space first when they enter the area. The Silverfield Group wants it to be attractive and fit in with the neighboring small businesses and is hoping to populate it with local retailers. The main entrance to the storage units will be along Plymouth Street.</p>
<p>The storage unit project has not been particularly popular in the neighborhood, to say the least. Last year, 500 residents attended two public meetings about the proposed facility and 5,000 signed a petition against it, concerned that it would change the feel of the neighborhood and leave a vacant space where the college building had been. However, the City approved demolition of the Jones site last year.</p>
<p>A few blocks further northwest, the long vacant Bank of America Building at 840 Edgewood Avenue South is set for demolition. In its place will rise a four-story, 117-unit multi-family residential complex called the Lofts at Murray Hill. The project has drawn community discussion, and dissension, about how the new building will affect the area in terms of traffic and density. The property is located between College and Kerle Streets and also features a Calvin and Hobbes mural by New York-based artist Jerkface. That mural is set to be demolished with the building.</p>
<p>The City Planning Commission approved zoning exceptions for the new complex last year despite vocal opposition from some Murray Hill residents who were worried about whether the project would attract low-income tenants and make it harder to park. The exceptions included reducing required parking spaces from 248 to 196 and doing away with the need to construct loading spaces. Steve Diebenow of the law firm Driver, McAfee, Hawthorne &amp; Diebenow, spoke on behalf of Vestcor, the developer. He said the units would be workforce housing for professionals such as teachers, firefighters, and police officers, and that tenants would be screened.</p>
<p>Some business owners view the project, including the addition of more population density, as a boost.</p>
<p>Stacey Flores, who co-founded Fishweir Brewing Company with her husband, Broc, four years ago, thought the short distance from the Lofts to the South Edgewood corridor near the intersection would make the area more walkable and bring in more flow.</p>
<p>“As a business owner and as a resident, we are really excited to have semi-affordable housing come to the neighborhood,” she said. “We think the thing we are missing here is population density. Bringing people in who are out in the community will be really beneficial.”</p>
<p>She also said she thought that more people within walking distance of the corridor would make traffic and parking less difficult.</p>
<p>Flores is also president of the fledgling Murray Hill Merchants Association, which is still forming and does not, collectively, have a view on the project. She said the association was just getting off the ground and had its first election right before COVID-19 shutdowns.</p>
<p>“Hopefully, when this all clears up, we can reconfigure,” Flores said. “Some of our main goals are beautifying our corridor, making things more friendly to pedestrian and bikers.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the overpass at Roosevelt Boulevard and Edgewood Avenue a few blocks away was primed for a new public art display installation composed of light. San Antonio-based artist Bill Englewood has been tapped to create the spectacle based on community input. During a community meeting last year, he said that his illumination projects in other areas have helped transform boring concrete to areas that pedestrians love to frequent.</p>
<p>District 14 City Councilwoman Randy DeFoor said in early June that the City has already set aside funding and that the art project was about two years off. In the meantime, the City of Jacksonville and the Florida Department of Transportation are working on a $4.4 million project that would transform Edgewood Avenue from U.S. 17 to the Lenox Avenue intersection and beyond. Part of the project includes cleaning the Roosevelt overpass.</p>
<p>Hampton Ray, an FDOT spokesman, said that the lane reassignment and improvement project is still on schedule and will begin in mid-2021. It’s expected to go out to bid in March 2021 and general construction would likely begin a few months after that. The project includes buffered bicycle lanes, more on-street parking, ADA improvements in addition to cleaning and painting the overpass.</p>

<p>Key Highlights Vijay Shekhar Sharma and Paytm take a bold step during COVID-19 to enter general insurance Will brand its insurance products ultimately as Paytm General Insurance Next up is a new age equity trading platform; all approvals in place</p>
<p>New Delhi: At a time companies are globally conserving cash and consolidating operations, self-made billionaire Vijay Shekhar Sharma and his firm Paytm have decided to enter a brand new business of health and auto insurance via a Rs 568 crore buyout. Next on the cards, and before the end of this quarter is a &ldquo;new age stock market trading platform&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Paytm and its founder are buying 100% stake in Raheja QBE, and are applying to the insurance regulator IRDAI for all the requisite approvals.</p>
<p>The insurance acquisition will enable Paytm to take a big step towards realising its stated goal of becoming a tech-led full financial services firm. &ldquo;This buyout will accelerate Paytm&rsquo;s insurance plans by 24-36 months&hellip;we can leverage crores of users on the Paytm platform to offer bite-sized and custom-made insurance products at very affordable rates in small towns and go beyond the top 30 cities,&rdquo; said Paytm president Amit Nayyar in an exclusive interview to ET Now. In fact, this is Paytm&rsquo;s only interview on the acquisition and insurance play.</p>
<p>Paytm&rsquo;s focus is currently on providing customised digital general insurance products including health, automobile and for business liability. All of this will ultimately be branded as Paytm General Insurance. Life insurance is not on the cards for now.</p>
<p>But insurance is a capital intensive and highly regulated business. And as it becomes a big play for Paytm, the firm is in the process of evaluating existing businesses to reallocate capital as well as human resources towards new businesses like insurance.</p>
<p>The opportunities in insurance, especially non-life, are immense. In FY19, total gross premiums written in India had reached Rs 5.78 lakh crore out of which the non-life insurance made up less than 30% at Rs 1.69 lakh crore. What&rsquo;s more, Warren Buffett&rsquo;s Berkshire Hathway is an investor in Paytm and owns one of the world&rsquo;s largest auto insurance company ie Geico. So Vijay Shekhar Sharma will have unenviable access to the Oracle of Omaha for his new business.</p>
<p>Now, coming to equity trading. Paytm Money has already got licences from market regulator SEBI for mutual fund distribution and stockbroking. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to jump the gun but in a matter of weeks and before the end of the quarter, Paytm will launch a new age digital stock market trading platform&hellip;Maybe in the future, we will even get into the mutual fund business,&rdquo; said the Paytm president.</p>
<p>He went on to add there is no fundraising on the cards, as Paytm is still well capitalised after last year&rsquo;s fundraiser of $1billion.

<p><img src="https://media.graytvinc.com/images/MGN_1280x720_00320C00-SWPEU.jpg" alt="img">
The effort to expand coronavirus testing in Maine is well underway.</p>
<p>During Monday&rsquo;s CDC briefing, Dr. Nirav Shah said they are getting closer to finding parties to operate the proposed 20 swab and send sites.</p>
<p>They would be located across the state to allow those living in more rural area much easier access.</p>
<p>The CDC is now working through those applications.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have received a fair number of them,&rdquo; said Shah. &ldquo;The team is actually reviewing those this week to try to make sure that they conform with what the state is looking for. Once that process is underway, and it&rsquo;s a fairly quick process, we&rsquo;ll be able to start working with the entities that have expressed interest. Getting them the funding that they would need to move forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maine CDC also hopes to open its mobile testing lab later this month.</p>
<p>Dr. Shah said the target date is July 17th.</p>
<p>He says once running at capacity, that lab could process 25,000 tests a week.

WhatsApp features: List of new and upcoming WhatsApp features (Express Photo) WhatsApp features: List of new and upcoming WhatsApp features (Express Photo)</p>
<p>Last week, WhatsApp introduced new features for its users globally. A few of them such as dark mode for web and Status support for Kaios are already available while other features such as animated stickers, QR codes, among others are yet to roll out. The Facebook-owned messaging platform has confirmed that all the recently announced WhatsApp features will be available for all users globally in the days/weeks to come.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the messaging platform is working on new features to bring very soon such as multi-device support, among others. Here’s a list of new and upcoming WhatsApp features you must know.</p>
<p>New WhatsApp features</p>
<p>Animated stickers</p>
<p>A lot was talked about animated stickers before the official launch. WhatsApp introduced animated stickers last week for users globally. The stickers will roll out to all users in the days to come the company has confirmed. Playful Piyomaru is the only animated sticker that has been confirmed for now which is 2.8 MB in size. However, there is a big drawback to these animated stickers. As per the current implementation, these animated stickers don’t play on the loop. There is still no clarification on whether WhatsApp will decide to loop these stickers or enable users to add the ability.</p>
<p>QR codes</p>
<p>A new way to add someone on your WhatsApp without asking for a phone number. The feature will help WhatsApp users add someone’s contact number by just scanning a QR code. This will also help the sharing group invites easily. The QR feature was available on Blackberry messenger a long time ago. WhatsApp has already launched QR codes. The roll out is set to begin soon.</p>
<p>Dark mode for web</p>
<p>WhatsApp introduced dark mode for mobile earlier this year. The web version now gets the dark theme. The feature is already available for all users globally. Similar to the mobile version in web too the messaging platform has provided two options light and dark theme. Here’s how to turn on WhatsApp dark mode on web.</p>
<p>Here are all the recently launched WhatsApp features (Image: WhatsApp) Here are all the recently launched WhatsApp features (Image: WhatsApp)</p>
<p>Video calls improvement</p>
<p>So far WhatsApp has not been able to enter the league of top video-calling apps. Video-calling has become essential for people, especially in a Covid-19 affected world. The new version aims at improving the quality of video calls. It will also let the users maximise the video of a particular contact to full screen with just a tap.</p>
<p>KaiOS gets updates too</p>
<p>KaiOS, a Linux based mobile operating system will get an update that has been there for Android and iOS users for a while now. The disappearing stories feature after 24 hours, common on apps like Instagram, Facebook, etc, now available for KaiOS.</p>
<p>Upcoming WhatsApp features</p>
<p>Multi-device support</p>
<p>The multi-device feature will help users to use their WhatsApp account on multiple devices. The users will be available to use WhatsApp on two or more smartphones or tablets. This feature is already available on Telegram. WhatsApp is testing the feature for quite some time and is expected to release it in the coming days. No specific release timeline has been revealed by the messaging platform yet.</p>
<p>Self-destructing messages</p>
<p>WhatsApp has been testing this feature for quite some time but hasn’t revealed any release timeline yet. It will work just the way WhatsApp Stories or Status work and disappear after 24 hours. Basically, users will soon be able to send messages that will disappear automatically after a set time period.</p>

<h3 id="coming-soon-thornburys-umberto-espresso-bar-is-moving-into-a-three-level-building-with-a-rooftop-bar">&ldquo;Coming Soon: Thornbury’s Umberto Espresso Bar Is Moving Into a Three-Level Building (With a Rooftop Bar)&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.broadsheet.com.au/cache/2b/84/2b842187cba2dc691e68147dd61e65b2.jpg" alt="img">
After 10 years on High Street, Thornbury’s Umberto Espresso Bar is moving into a 100-year-old former shoe store just 100 metres up the road. The laid-back Italian spot gets a lot of its charm from its snug scale, but owner Marco Finanzio assures us he’s concerned less with the bells and whistles of modern design, and more with replicating the feel of the OG Umberto. “It’s still gonna be cosy and poky and old world-y, like those espresso bars that arrived in Melbourne in the ’50s,’ he says. “I want people to walk in and think: ‘Shit, it’s exactly the same’.”</p>
<p>But with one main difference: plenty more room. Umberto 2.0 will seat 200 (compared to its predecessor’s 40), spread across several rooms and nooks. Finanzio has renovated the new space in the two years since buying it in 2018, and slowly doubled the building’s footprint by extending the first floor and creating a second. “I haven’t been in a rush because this will be our home forever, and I really want it done properly,” he says. On street level, two huge windows flank the entrance, and there&rsquo;ll be dark-wood panelling and familiar fixtures such as the cake display, light box with Italian soccer graphics, and box shelving.

<h3 id="devolver-digital-announces-shadow-warrior-3-gameplay-coming-soon">&ldquo;Devolver Digital announces ‘Shadow Warrior 3’, gameplay coming soon&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Shadow-Warrior-3.jpg" alt="img">
Devolver Digital has announced Shadow Warrior 3, with a gameplay reveal coming on July 11 as part of the Devolver Digital Direct stream.</p>
<p>The game is being developed by Flying Wild Hog and is set to release sometime in 2021. Alongside the reveal is a new trailer which provides players a cinematic teaser of what the future instalment holds. Series protagonist Lo Wang returns alongside the meta humour that the franchise is known for.</p>
<p>While no gameplay is shown, the teaser trailer highlights some of the brand new features coming to Shadow Warrior 3, including a grappling hook which will be used for new traversal methods around the environment. The footage finally ends in a crescendo of gore as Wang utilises the many supernatural powers he possess to defeat a variety of demons.</p>
<p>Check out the announcement trailer below:</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The official Steam store page for Shadow Warrior 3 reads: “Fallen corporate shogun Lo Wang and his former employer turned nemesis turned sidekick Orochi Zilla embark on an improbable mission to recapture an ancient dragon they unwillingly unleashed from its eternal prison.”</p>
<p>“Armed with a punishing mix of blades and bullets, Lo Wang must traverse uncharted parts of the world to track down the dark beast and push the apocalypse back yet again. All it will take is the mask of a dead god, a dragon’s egg, a touch of magic, and enough firepower to hold off the impending cataclysm.”</p>
<p>The Devolver Digital Direct is set to reveal the company’s releases and plans for the future. After the show, multiple demos will be available for players to download, including Carrion and Disc Room.
