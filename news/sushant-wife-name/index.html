<h3 id="from-shoba-to-sushant-singh-rajput-a-look-at-suicides-in-indian-cinema">&ldquo;From Shoba to Sushant Singh Rajput: A look at suicides in Indian cinema&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.manoramaonline.com/content/dam/mm/en/entertainment/entertainment-news/images/2020/6/15/sushant-soba-silk-smitha-suicide.jpg" alt="img">
The curse of suicide has haunted the showbiz since time immemorial with the likes of iconic actor-director Guru Dutt, South star Shoba, Silk Smitha, actor Jiah Khan and now Bollywood star Sushant Singh Rajput giving up on life in the Indian film industry known for being harsh and demanding of its stars.</p>
<p>Known for films like &ldquo;Kai Po Che!&quot;, &ldquo;MS Dhoni: The Untold Story&rdquo;, &ldquo;Chhichhore&rdquo;, Rajput was found hanging at his Bandra home, the police said on Sunday. He was 34.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: Shocking suicides: Actors who stunned us with their sudden exits</p>
<p>Rajput&rsquo;s last screen appearance was Nitesh Tiwari&rsquo;s 2019 film Chhichhore. And his last social media post, dedicated to his late mother who died in 2002 when he was a young teen, was on June 3, a foretelling perhaps on what to come.</p>
<p>Rajput&rsquo;s sudden death comes days after his former manager, 28-year-old Disha Salian, ended her life by jumping from a high rise building on June 9.</p>
<p>Guru Dutt, known for black-and-white classics like &ldquo;Kaagaz Ke Phool&rdquo;, &ldquo;Baazi&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Pyaasa&rdquo;, was found dead on October 10, 1964 in his bed in his rented apartment at Pedder Road in erstwhile Bombay. He was 39. The filmmaker, whose real name was Vasanth Kumar Shivashankar Padukone, was said to have been mixing alcohol and sleeping pills.</p>
<p>Dutt&rsquo;s death may have been suicide or just an accidental overdose. His son, Arun Dutt, considered the death to be an accident.</p>
<p>Guru Dutt</p>
<p>South star Mahalakshmi Menon, best known by her stagename Shoba committed suicide at the age of 17. She got herself a National Award for Best Actress for the film Pasi and on May 1, 1980, she was found to have killed herself in her house in Chennai, then Madras. The manner of Shoba’s death, however, still remains cloaked in mystery.</p>
<p>Four years after Shoba died, her mother Prema who was also an actress too killed herself. KG George&rsquo;s 1983 film Lekhayude Maranam – Oru Flashback is said to be loosely based on her life.</p>
<p>Actor Vijaylakshmi, who reached the iconic status of a sex symbol in Tamil cinema during her time, as Silk Smitha died at the age of 33 as the result of a suspected suicide in 1996. She appeared in over 200 films, including &ldquo;Vandichakkaram&rdquo;, &ldquo;Moondru Mugam&rdquo;, a most sought after actor at a time was said to be neck deep in controversies.</p>
<p>Silk Smitha</p>
<p>She was immortalised on screen in the 2011 film &ldquo;The Dirty Picture&rdquo;, starring Vidya Balan as Silk. The Milan Luthria-directed film, which showed the highs and lows of the dancing star, was inspired by the actor&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Former Miss India and video jockey Nafisa Joseph was found hanging at her residence in Versova in 2004 at the age of 25.</p>
<p>Joseph, who won the Miss India title in 1997, had worked as a model and had been involved in activities related to animal rights.</p>
<p>In 2006, model-turned television actor Kuljeet Randhawa, known for starring in high-school drama &ldquo;Hip Hip Hurray!&quot;, suspense serial &ldquo;Kohinoor&rdquo; and crime thriller drama &ldquo;Special Squad&rdquo;, allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself in her single room apartment in suburban Juhu. She was 25.</p>
<p>Kunal Singh, best known for starring opposite actor Sonali Bendre in the 1999 Tamil romance film &ldquo;Kadhalar Dhinam&rdquo;, was found hanging from the ceiling fan in his Mumbai apartment in 2008. He was 30.</p>
<p>Jiah Khan</p>
<p>British-American actor Jiah Khan, best known for films like &ldquo;Nishabd&rdquo; with megastar Amitabh Bachchan and &ldquo;Ghajini&rdquo; with Aamir Khan, was found hanging at her Mumbai residence on June 3, 2013 by her mother Rabiya Khan. Khan was 25.</p>
<p>It was deemed a suicide and reconfirmed as a suicide in 2016 following an extensive investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and a hearing at the Bombay High Court.</p>
<p>Khan&rsquo;s mother blamed her boyfriend, actor Sooraj Pancholi, for her death. He was charged with abetting Khan&rsquo;s suicide. The case has not yet been settled.</p>
<p>Last year, actor Kushal Punjabi, who appeared in films such as &ldquo;Kaal&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lakshya&rdquo; as well as the reality show &ldquo;Fear Factor&rdquo;, was found hanging in his Bandra apartment. He was 42.</p>
<p>Punjabi, whose body was found by his parents in the wee hours of December 27, left behind a suicide note in which he said nobody should be held responsible for his death.

<p><img src="https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/715_-/2020/06/sushmita-1592184964.jpg" alt="img">
The country was left in shock after the news of actor Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s suicide started doing rounds. The 34-year-old Bollywood actor was found hanging at his Bandra residence on June 14. When there was no response after repeated knocks, his domestic help called the neighbours after which police arrived shortly and broke into his room where he was found hanging around 12.30 pm. It came to light that he was suffering from depression and was even getting treatment from Hinduja hospital for the last six months. After the untimely death of the stay, various celebrities were left in shock and had only one question as to why he took the drastic step. One amongst those was actress Sushmita Sen who took to her social media to share a long post and spoke about how it is important to stay positive in life because a person is only responsible for his own happiness. She even spoke about how insecurities can grow in the life of a celebrity with name and sometimes, bank balance.</p>
<p>Sushmita shared a photo that read, &lsquo;protect your peace.&rsquo; Alongside she wrote the long post reading, &ldquo;Look good, show good&hellip;be good..ALL THE TIME!! Projection becomes one’s life, both on &amp; off screen. Insecurities grow with name &amp; sometimes, bank balance. All these may be known triggers in an actors life&hellip;but it’s actually true about a lot of us from all different walks of life&hellip;only differing in magnitude &amp; visibility!! Young people with so much life &amp; promise ahead of them, some with great depth &amp; will power&hellip;can choose to take their own life is deeply disturbing. How do we say, we know people &amp; still not see it coming? Have we become experts at hiding our pain or does no one have the time to really SEE it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further, she said, &ldquo;How lonely &amp; hopeless can prolonged silence make you? Do we alienate a life by judging it constantly? In the race of the projection of “look good, show good, be good” have we lost the most important ability to FEEL GOOD? Life has its share of pressures for EVERYONE&hellip;no one is excused that, no matter what your standing!! Life is a graph with its ups &amp; downs for EVERYONE, even if we can’t always see it. Yet, FIGHT FOR LIFE WE MUST&hellip;it’s the only vehicle that will help lead us from bad times to GOOD ONES again!!! “WHEN YOU’RE TIRED&hellip; LEARN TO REST, NOT QUIT.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She also wrote about how building a life takes a lot of faith and courage while taking one&rsquo;s life just needs a moment of madness. She said, &ldquo;We can’t change the world, but we can choose self preservation over the noise, chaos, demands, insensitive scrutinisation &amp; conditioned insecurities&hellip;.by befriending ourselves, being around people who really LISTEN, having faith in God’s unique plan JUST FOR YOU!!! Be unafraid to ask for help &amp; know that you are NOT ALONE. Building a life demands a lot of faith, courage, resilience &amp; hard work&hellip;whereas taking your life just needs a MOMENT of madness&hellip;choose to distract yourself from THAT moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the professional front, Sushmita will be making her &lsquo;incredible&rsquo; comeback through her upcoming web series &lsquo;Aarya&rsquo; in which she will be seen playing the role of a mother who is willing to go to any length to protect her children. The show also features Namit Das, Sikandar Kher, Jayant Kripalani, Sohaila Kapoor, Sugandha Garg, Maya Sareen, Vishwajeet Pradhan and Manish Chaudhary. It is directed by Ram Madhwani, is scheduled to hit Disney+ Hotstar VIP on the 19th of June 2020.</p>

Veteran Marathi actress Usha Nadkarni played late actor Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s mother in his debut TV show &ldquo;Pavitra Rishta&rdquo;. The show made Sushant a household name and an overnight star.</p>
<p>Usha said, &ldquo;Sushant was a quiet boy. We had worked together for almost two and a half years on the show ‘Pavitra Rishta&rsquo;. It was a good experience playing the role of his ‘aai&rsquo; ( mother).</p>
<p>When my hairdresser contacted me in the morning and shared the news of Sushant&rsquo;s demise, I could not believe it. I thought it was a hoax. My immediate reaction was Sushant aatmahatya kashi karu shakto (why would Sushant commit suicide)? But then, the news was all over and it sadly turned out to be true.</p>
<p>My whole body started shaking as read the news of his death. I just had tears rolling down my eyes. I was numb for a moment. May his soul Rest in peace.</p>
<p>I was not in touch with Sushant after he left the show. He then made foray into films and became a big and successful person. His life was different and I never tried to bother him by contacting him. He was a shy, quiet and calm person. He used to quietly sit on the sets and would always go out of his way to make others comfortable.</p>
<p>Apne kaam mein kaam rakhne wala ladka tha (he used to mind his business). He was a good boy. I will always remember him.&rdquo;</p>

He wants to put an end to his playboy image and get settled down while the actress is taking her own sweet time to give her answer to him. A closed source told Pinkvilla that marriage isn&rsquo;t on cards for the two of them now. The source said, &ldquo;Both Rhea and Sushant are close friends who enjoy each other&rsquo;s company, however marriage isn’t on the cards as of now as the actors are currently focusing on their respective careers. Sushant is busy with the promotion of his upcoming film Chhichhore and Rhea has a film announcement soon. They have just started seeing each other. It&rsquo;s been a few months and they are now getting to know each other well. There&rsquo;s enough time before they decide to take the marital plunge. Right now, it&rsquo;s not even a thought playing on their mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Previously during an interview that the MS Dhoni: An Untold Story actor spoke about his relationship with Rhea and told Man&rsquo;s World India Magazine, &ldquo;I’m seeing many. Oh, you mean it as a metaphor? I’m not allowed to say. It’s not that someone else is saying that I’m not allowed to say it. I cannot allow myself to say anything. Right now, it’s not right to say. People shouldn’t start talking about things in a nascent stage as if they are very sure of it.”</p>
<p>He continued, “Why do that? If you ask me any question that has to do with me, I can say it. If I was seeing somebody, I’d have to ask that somebody. Probably your question, if well-founded, will help me insinuate it to the other person to know what to say next time. And probably when you put me on the cover next time, I’ll say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sushant was previously dating actress Kriti Sanon, who was as per reports the reason why the actor split with her long-time girlfriend Ankita Lokhande, whom he met during the show Pavitra Rishta.</p>

<p><img src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202001/rhea_0-647x363.jpeg?17NjiI.ILMYOt4RW2HQ2ZkYvdY.Z4gXy" alt="img">
Sushant Singh Rajput turned 34 today. And probably the first one to shower him with love on the occasion is his girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty. Needless to say, Rhea&rsquo;s birthday wish has found a place in the gossip columns. More than the adorable birthday wish for Sushant, her post has grabbed our attention for the fact that they have finally made their &ldquo;hush-hush affair&rdquo; Insta official.</p>
<p>Rhea, who has been reportedly dating Sushant for a year, took to Instagram to wish him a happy birthday. In her post, Rhea called Sushant a &ldquo;supermassive black hole&rdquo; and we wish we knew what that meant!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy birthday to the most beautiful &ldquo;supermassive black hole&rdquo; that is known to mankind! Shine on you crazy diamond @sushantsinghrajput #boywithagoldenheart #rheality,&rdquo; read Rhea&rsquo;s caption.</p>
<p>The actress shared two pictures with her boyfriend on the handle. In the first picture, the lovebirds can be seen sitting together on a bench at the park. While Rhea is making a weird face with her arm resting on his shoulder, Sushant is happily enjoying the moment with his lady love.</p>
<p>The second photo shows Rhea and Sushant on a boat against the backdrop of a sea, and it seems to have been clicked on a holiday.</p>
<p>Rhea and Sushant were holidaying together in Paris, Italy and Ladakh last year, glimpses of which went viral on social media thanks to several fan clubs. The couple shared solo photos of themselves from the vacations and ensured that they do not put out any picture where they are seen together. Except for one photo with their close friends.</p>
<p>Speaking of Sushant Singh Rajput, he has been tight-lipped about his relationship status to the extent of saying that he is single. At the India Today Mind Rocks Delhi 2019, the Chhichhore actor had said, &ldquo;I am single. I am not in a relationship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhea and Sushant have also been spotted by the paparazzi several times.</p>
<p>It was in May last year when a source close to Sushant Singh Rajput revealed that they are dating each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sushant is currently seeing Rhea Chakraborty. They have known each other for a while and they hit it off really well in the last few weeks. In fact, things moved from one thing to the other quite quickly and now, they are already dating each other,&rdquo; the source had said.</p>
<p>Talking about their hush-hush affair, the source added, &ldquo;Rhea and Sushant have been spending a lot of quality time nowadays. They are still calling each other &lsquo;good friends&rsquo; but the reality is that they are already seeing each other. When Sushant is not in town, he is chilling at his Lonavala house, Rhea also accompanies him sometimes. They are keeping their relationship hush-hush for now before taking it to the next level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Rhea, Sushant Singh Rajput has been linked with Kriti Sanon and Sara Ali Khan. But looks like Sushant has found his true love in Rhea Chakraborty.</p>
