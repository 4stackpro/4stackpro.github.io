The Boss, AKA Bruce Springsteen, may be the salt of the earth but he’s read his way across the literary world. So we’re taking a look back at a list of his most treasured books.</p>
<p>In an interview with The New York Times Springsteen is asked to compile the list through a series of intriguing questions. The 2014 interview remains a wonderful insight into the creative mind of one of America’s greatest songwriters, Bruce Springsteen.</p>
<p>Some are your usual affair, such as “You’re hosting a literary dinner with three writers. Who’s invited?”, to which the Boss answers “Philip Roth, Keith Richards, Tolstoy — and one extra, Bob Dylan. A lot of life experience there, and the babbling in different tongues would be wonderful.”</p>
<p>While others require Springsteen to dig a little deeper, asking him for the book that “made him”. Springsteen answers, “One would be difficult, but the short stories of Flannery O’Connor landed hard on me. You could feel within them the unknowability of God, the intangible mysteries of life that confounded her characters, and which I find by my side every day.”</p>
<p>The questions continue to light the way for us fans to try and understand the Boss’ inner workings. They go on, “What’s the last book you read that made you laugh?”, Bruce replies “Richard Ford’s The Lay of the Land.“, as well as, “The last book that made you cry?” with the ‘Born To Run’ singer answers, “Cormac McCarthy’s The Road.” There are also mentions of Leo Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, and Anton Chekov to show that Springsteen liked to challenge himself with his books.</p>
<p>It is from these answers that the good people of Open Culture pulled together this list of the 20 mentioned books in the interview. You can read the full thing here. It’s a reading list that shows off that while The Boss has always been a blue-collar rocker, he knows a good read when he sees one.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/17/PAPP/2123f82f-d73f-4ef4-955f-fbda93f9d071-brucespringsteen15PRESTO.jpg?crop=1599,899,x0,y368&amp;width=1599&amp;height=899&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" alt="img">
Bruce Springsteen and wife Patti Scialfa stuck inside their home just like everyone else.</p>
<p>The rocker called into E Street Radio on SiriusXM for an interview with Jim Rotolo that aired Friday, to give an update on how the Springsteens are faring during the coronavius outbreak.</p>
<p>So far, so good, Springsteen said from his Colts Neck, New Jersey home.</p>
<p>“Everyone is just trying to stay busy,” he said. “Patti and I are hanging out a lot which is great, we are having a good time together. We are on a farm so we have our horses here and we get to spend a little time with them &hellip; that’s been nice. I have been busy a little bit working on some music. I try to keep my day as full as possible and keep myself from going completely cabin fever crazy.”</p>
<p>Jersey bred: The musical lesson Charlie Puth learned from a Bruce Springsteen concert</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s listening to music and reading when he&rsquo;s not working on music.</p>
<p>“I have all kinds of old music that I listen to, old blues,” Springsteen said. “I have playlists of the fathers of rock, where I have Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley. This morning I was listening to Del Shannon who is sort of undersung as a hero of rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll. I have a playlist of him and Dion, two of the great, great singers in rock music so I listen to them quite a bit. Future Islands, I like that band. You know I am all over the place.”</p>
<p>Scialfa was filling out a list of the Top 50 greatest rock bands for Rolling Stone, she said.</p>
<p>Listen:Social distancing the Bruce Springsteen and E Street Band way with &lsquo;London Calling&rsquo; stream</p>
<p>Working on music is also part of the downtime. “It’s going well so hopefully it keeps going well. I have no predictions on it yet,” Springsteen said.</p>
<p>Asbury Park:Bruce Springsteen fans postpone annual Spring-Nuts Serenade</p>
<p>The Boss did recently record a video message for the New Jersey Pandemic Relief Fund. Jon Bon Jovi, Jon Stewart, Danny Devito, Whoopi Goldberg and more also filmed for the spot.</p>
<p>“There are so many problems with a lot of people being overwhelmed and facilities being overwhelmed and we are just, we don’t know where we are in the whole thing. How much longer is it going to go, how much worse is it going to get. There is something there that people can get involved with if they’d like to. It’s going to be a helpful and good thing,” he said.</p>
<p>He said he recently spoke with Jackson Browne, who has tested positive for COVD-19, and he&rsquo;s doing well.</p>
<p>“Jackson I’ve known forever he was one of the kindest people to us when we very first got started,” Springsteen said. “He actually put us on the bill and let us open up. He is a great, great, great friend of mine. Not only is he also one of my great heroes as a songwriter, I’ve spoken to him a little bit and he seems to being alright at the moment. Just wishing him well and a lot of love.”</p>
<p>Springsteen talks to life-long friend and fellow E Street Band member Steven Van Zandt often.</p>
<p>“I’ve talked to Steve quite a bit, which is always a source of great entertainment, so he keeps my spirits up,” Springsteen said.</p>
<p>There was a special message for New York, Italy and Spain, coronavirus hot spots.</p>
<p>“We want to send out our thoughts and prayers to all of our fans and friends in New York who are going through such a tough time right now, and fans in Italy and Spain who we love so much,” Springsteen said. “Stay safe, that&rsquo;s all we can say, and everyone everywhere, we&rsquo;re thinking about you and praying for you, so God bless.”</p>

<h3 id="listen-a-springsteen-playlist-for-dreaming-of-escape-in-a-time-of-isolation">Listen: A Springsteen playlist for dreaming of escape in a time of isolation</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/4qdUIKMz7EpT1d1AebDqYphwnHA=/1200x0/filters:quality(80)/arc-anglerfish-tgam-prod-tgam.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KIYD7CUACFGQFE6S7JFUCQ6CFU.JPG" alt="img">
The view from my window looks like it’s painted onto the glass. I stare at that patch of sky and roof so much these days, it no longer seems like a portal to the world, so much as a kind of mural. The outdoors have taken on a static quality, now that there’s so little to do in them.</p>
<p>In my confinement – not medical self-isolation, just the “staying at home” that’s required of everyone – the eyes don’t offer escape nearly as well as the ears. It’s music that smuggles me out, through the white rubber thread of my headphones. I go to mushroomy forests, deserts at sunrise, auto plants as painted by Diego Rivera, dance floors.</p>
<p>In particular, during these first 10 days of social distance, I have been going wherever Bruce Springsteen takes me. No other artist has been as capable of drawing out and salving what I feel, or as useful a companion on my auditory tunnelling expeditions.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>It seemed unintuitive at first that pop music’s bard of the open road, and arguably the greatest live performer of his generation, would resonate so powerfully to someone cooped up in a third-story apartment, listening on an iPhone.</p>
<p>But of course it makes perfect sense. Springsteen has always managed to conjure feelings of both escape and togetherness, the paradoxical twin cravings of quarantine.</p>
<p>I’ve been an initiate to the cult of Bruce since early childhood, when I would sit in my parents’ Jetta playing air drums to Candy’s Room, but, like the pandemic itself, this cult is ecumenical and worldwide. Last year alone, we got a film about Springsteen’s resonance to a Pakistani-British teenager in the Thatcherite ’80s (Blinded by the Light), articles in The Atlantic and The Nation respectively titled “Bruce Springsteen is Jew-ish” and “The Queerness of Bruce Springsteen,&rdquo; and an admission from Angela Merkel that her dream while living under Communism in East Germany was to drive across America listening to The Boss. Here is a musician who inspires not only love but identification from the most disparate groups of people. That sounds like the kind of musician we need now.</p>
<p>With COVID-19, we are all in it together. It will be a little easier if we are also in it with Bruce. These songs are taken, one each, from his first 16 studio albums and a movie soundtrack, and arranged in chronological order.</p>
<p>It’s Hard To Be A Saint In The City</p>
<p>The title evokes a dilemma of this outbreak: many of us want to help, but the most helpful thing we can do is sit at home and avoid others. In fact, this song has refreshingly little to say about the pandemic. It’s an escapist slice of light in Bruce’s trippy poetry phase, about being young and cool and tempted.</p>
<p>New York City Serenade</p>
<p>The hardest-hit places force you to bow your head in sad solidarity. Wuhan. Lombardy. Mulhouse. Increasingly, New York City. It had more than 15,000 cases on Tuesday, and counting. New York is like nowhere else on earth. As the travel writer Jan Morris once observed, it is a universal port, truly foreign to no one. This jazzy epic, whose narrator asks us longingly to “take my arm and move with me down Broadway,” reaches for the sky like the city itself.</p>
<p>Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out</p>
<p>A short, sharp burst of joy and horns, the sound of a city united in rollicking celebration. We’ll get there.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>Racing in the Street</p>
<p>Springsteen in his best ruminative storytelling mode. The characters in his songs have matured with him over the years, and in this album, released a few years after the fist-pumping Born to Run, the greasers and drag racers have crashed into reality and now stare “off alone into the night/With the eyes of one who hates for just being born.”</p>
<p>Hungry Heart</p>
<p>An ode to, almost a pastiche of, the ’50s girl groups that so influenced him – down to his stilted, Martha Reeves-inflected vocals. Shimmery bubblegum fun, a perfect three-minute pop song, with a refrain that captures our collective longing for each other as we hunker down, alone together.</p>
<p>Reason to Believe</p>
<p>Chugging harmonica and yelping vocals that are the sound of carrying on with an unreasonable optimism in your chest.</p>
<p>Dancing in the Dark</p>
<p>Gotta keep dancing, even if it’s alone in our apartments, even if we get “tired and bored with” ourselves. The pulsing rhythm of one of Springsteen’s biggest hits makes it hard not to “shake the world off my shoulders.”</p>
<p>Two Faces</p>
<p>A breakup song drenched in regret, from Springsteen’s divorce album. A reminder to be kind to each other in isolation. We all have two faces: Show your loved ones the side that laughs, the side that says hello.</p>
<p>Living Proof</p>
<p>In a time when the death toll is already numbing, this cry of almost anguished happiness about the birth of Springsteen’s first son feels like an antidote.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>Human Touch</p>
<p>The title track from arguably his worst album is one of my favourite Springsteen songs. It’s perfectly paced and full of those wonderful inarticulate Bruce wails, theology-infused lyricism and a core theme that couldn’t be more pertinent or simple as we physically recoil from each other, and recoil from the recoiling.</p>
<p>Streets of Philadelphia</p>
<p>Is it too obvious and too painful to include this Oscar-winning song inspired by the AIDS epidemic? Or too poignant and lovely not to? One of Springsteen’s most haunting lyrics clinches it. “At night I could hear the blood in my veins,” he sings. “It was just as black and whispering as the rain.”</p>
<p>Dry Lightning</p>
<p>What beauty there is in this often-neglected track from the back end of a famously sombre, politically militant album. The “corral-smelling rain” and the low thunder over the mesquite, a backdrop to one man’s pining for a lost partner. Worth listening to just for the way Bruce sings “on the horizon liiiine.”</p>
<p>Mary’s Place</p>
<p>The most carefree, hopeful song on Springsteen’s 9/11 album, and a showcase for the late sax god Clarence Clemons, whose solos always raise me up.</p>
<p>Long Time Comin’</p>
<p>A breezy tune that clears away the cobwebs, with vivid lyrics about parenting, a man’s redemption and coming out on the other side of life’s dark tunnels.</p>
<p>O Mary Don’t You Weep</p>
<p>Bruce never quite stopped being the mother-worshipping Catholic boy he was raised as, and returns often to the Mary motif. But this album was a stylistic departure – shaggy interpretations of various kinds of American folk music, heavy on brass, boogie-woogie piano and fiddle.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>Livin’ in the Future</p>
<p>The apocalyptic imagery of the lyrics collides with the church revival ecstasy of the arrangement, with its sheets of cleansing-rain organ and punches of indignant sax. The sound of insisting on joy in a terrible time.</p>
<p>The Wrestler</p>
<p>“My only faith’s in the broken bones and bruises I display.” It’s a marvel that Springsteen continued putting out such vital music well into his sixties. Here, he sounds weathered, exhausted even – but somehow sustained by the off-kilter pleasure of the ideas in his head. I know the feeling.</p>
