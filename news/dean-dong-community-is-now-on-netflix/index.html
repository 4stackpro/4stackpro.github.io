<p>Not since the American reboot of Inspector Spacetime have we been so excited about streaming news. Starting April 1, all six seasons of Community will be available on Netflix. Yes, that’s April Fools’ Day, but no, this is not a prank. For fans who have been enjoying the NBC comedy on Hulu since it first acquired the rights to the doomed Yahoo Screen season in 2016, there’s no reason to panic. Sony Pictures TV, which owns Community, made the multiyear Netflix deal nonexclusive, meaning it will still be available to watch on Hulu, which really is the Greendale to Netflix’s City College. The move to Netflix, however, could expose Dan Harmon’s cult-favorite community-college sitcom to a whole new audience: for example, Childish Gambino fans. Or Chevy Chase defenders. Or your roommate who has spent this entire self-isolation period rewatching The Office in your living room. When they’re not looking, you can switch over to a classic quarantine-themed episode of Community, like “Epidemiology” or “Cooperative Calligraphy,” and hide the remote, telling them it’s all in the spirit of their beloved Jim’s epic japes.</p>

<h3 id="community-was-one-of-the-most-inventive-shows-in-tv-history-it-just-started-streaming-on-netflix">Community was one of the most inventive shows in TV history. It just started streaming on Netflix.</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a4wheC2aE8kmNWLkgKuNSTx-IaU=/0x0:5760x3016/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3749114/communitygroup.0.jpg" alt="img">
Few TV shows have changed my life like Community has.</p>
<p>That sounds like hyperbole, I realize, but it’s really not. The sitcom about a group of study buddies at a community college, which very quickly became a free-wheeling parody of nearly all pop culture, was one of my favorite shows of its era, and when I was a young critic, it helped me codify many of the ways I think about TV.</p>
<p>I reviewed every episode of the show’s first five seasons in my old job at the A.V. Club, and doing so caused my career to explode. It’s 100 percent true that I would not be sitting here, writing these words to you right now, if it weren’t for Community. Deep inside the show’s story about broken but good people trying to make each other whole was a story that I — and then lots and lots of other people — sparked to, and in trying to capture the joy it made me feel, I found my critical voice.</p>
<p>But I realize that “I want to better understand Emily VanDerWerff’s career” maybe isn’t the greatest hook to get you to watch a TV show. So let me explain — let her explain! — why Community holds up as something more than a cult sitcom, as something funny and bruised and real that you should absolutely check out between your other sitcom binges.</p>
<p>(And if you’re already sold, it’s newly available on Netflix, while it remains available on its original streaming home of Hulu as well.)</p>
<p>Community celebrated the sheer, unbridled freedom of the network sitcom with 22-plus episodes to fill</p>
<p>Community aired from 2009 to 2014 on NBC, with its sixth and final season airing on Yahoo Screen in 2016. (Remember when Yahoo was going to make television?) In that time, it became famous for three things: concept episodes (where the show would ditch its basic premise in favor of a satirical spin on some other genre entirely), a rabid cult fanbase, and low ratings. (The show was perpetually scheduled against mega-hit The Big Bang Theory, and the two shows’ numbers &hellip; did not compare.)</p>
<p>The concept episodes were the reason I fell so hard for Community. The show’s first season is its most sitcom-like, spinning 25 episodes about the characters learning to love Greendale Community College (a fictional school in Colorado). But late in that first season, the show unleashed “Modern Warfare,” an action movie parody about a paintball game spreading across the Greendale campus that simultaneously revealed two characters hooking up for the first time.</p>
<p>And the internet (or at least the parts of the internet I hung out on) exploded. The show’s pitch-perfect evocation of ’80s action cinema was something you weren’t supposed to be able to do in a TV sitcom.</p>
<p>In Community’s second season — the show’s best, even if it was a little more all over the place than the first — “Modern Warfare” became its new template. Even in episodes ostensibly about on-campus shenanigans, Community would offer up some prime silliness, as when one episode took a left turn and abruptly tossed in a dramatic chase scene through a blanket and pillow fort. There were stop-motion Christmas specials and Dungeons &amp; Dragons games and homages to the film My Dinner With Andre. It was amazing TV.</p>
<p>Subsequent seasons — especially season four, whose disappointing nature we’ll get to in a minute — never quite reached that high level, but there is amazing stuff in seasons three and six, especially. And even when the show had an off episode, an ensemble cast that included Joel McHale right as he was starting to blow up, Donald Glover right before he blew up, and Alison Brie at the very start of her career — and that’s honestly just for starters — meant that at the very least, you’d get some funny line readings to take home.</p>
<p>Community’s creative team was vital to its reputation for innovation. Creator Dan Harmon was not always a champion human being, but he’s as good as anybody in TV history at coming up with oddball riffs on pop culture and sitcom tropes. When he was fired ahead of Community’s fourth season (he was rehired for the final two), it played almost as an object lesson in how tied some shows are to the voices of their creators.</p>
<p>And in its first three seasons, the show’s chief directors were Joe and Anthony Russo — a.k.a. the guys behind two Captain America movies and two Avengers movies (who keep working Community alums into their films). Their ability to ape big-budget movies on a network TV budget landed them the Marvel gig.</p>
<p>There are elements of Community that play differently to modern eyes, particularly the attraction between grown-ass adult Jeff (McHale) and actual-18-year-old-when-the-show-starts Annie (Brie). It drew plenty of criticism when the show aired, but it plays differently in light of revelations about Harmon’s sexual harassment of a young staffer in his writers’ room. (He has since apologized, in one of the few genuinely exemplary apologies of the #MeToo era.) And the show’s attempts to tell jokes about race could be &hellip; a little tone-deaf, to be generous.</p>
<p>But Community’s handful of misfired jokes and one romantic plotline that never really went anywhere don’t negate it from being one of the all-time great TV sitcoms. Don’t just watch Community because I love it. Watch it because, if literally anything I wrote above — even just the words “Donald Glover” — makes you think you might love it, you almost certainly will.</p>
<p>Community is available to stream on Hulu and on Netflix. We’re still waiting on that movie.</p>

<h3 id="with-black-community-hard-hit-by-covid-bayview-groups-demand-aid">With Black community hard-hit by COVID, Bayview groups demand aid</h3>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/48hills.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gloria-Berry-Beds-4-Bayview.jpg?fit=700%2C568&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
As tragic stories about COVID cluster deaths in Black communities begin to emerge from New York and Detroit to Georgia and beyond, many are pointing out the dangers of ignoring racial disparities when it comes to healthcare, economic opportunity, and government support.</p>
<p>Now, the Bay View newspaper, Beds 4 Bayview, and several community groups and activists are calling on the city to provide emergency aid for essential community institutions such as Mother Brown’s Dining Room, which provides “food, fellowship and a place to rest are elderly, disabled or have chronic health problems, making them particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus.”</p>
<p>“We, the community of Bayview Hunters Point, demand a robust emergency response from our local government to ensure that our basic needs are being met,” reads an open letter to Mayor London Breed and District 10 Supervisor Shamann Walton, published in the newspaper March 30.</p>
<p>The letter also called for correcting the homeless services disparity facing the district, which contains the second-highest number of homeless people (1500) in the city. “Yet there are very few homeless services, compared to neighborhoods like SoMa and the Tenderloin that also have many people in need,” says the letter.</p>
<p>The letter also demands more contact with the community about COVID risks and aid, as well as a demand that unsheltered people in the district, who tend to be elderly, disabled, and suffer from underlying health conditions, be housed in empty hotel rooms as part of that effort. As Beds 4 Bayview activist Gloria Berry says in a video accompanying the letter, while steps like opening the Moscone Center to unhoused people are laudable, very little COVID-aid attention has been directed to the Bayview Hunters Point neighborhood.</p>
<p>Read the full letter published in the Bay View below.</p>
<p>Emergency COVID-19 aid needed in Bayview-Hunters Point</p>
<p>Open letter to San Francisco Mayor London Breed and Supervisor Shamann Walton</p>
<p>While the City of San Francisco has taken dramatic steps in the face of the COVID-19 crisis – declaring a state of emergency, ordering shelter-in-place and opening the Moscone Center as an emergency shelter – very little of the response has been directed towards the Bayview. This is part of a longstanding pattern of ignoring the Bayview unless there are condos to build or a sewage treatment plant to locate.</p>
<p>We, the community of Bayview Hunters Point, demand a robust emergency response from our local government to ensure that our basic needs are being met.</p>
<p>Our present crisis is stressing service providers who are already overburdened. District 10, which contains Bayview Hunters Point, has the second highest unsheltered homeless population in the City with over 1,500 going without shelter. Yet there are very few homeless services, compared to neighborhoods like SoMa and the Tenderloin that also have many people in need.</p>
<p>The USDA considers Bayview-Hunters Point to be an “urban food desert,” which means community kitchens like Mother Brown’s, which cooks hundreds of meals a day, have to work overtime to meet the needs of food insecure residents even in normal times. With the economic downturn, closures of businesses and suspension of some community meals and pantries, it has become even harder for poor and homeless Bayview residents to find a meal.</p>
<p>The City should be working closely with and providing emergency aid to Mother Brown’s and other community resources during this time, not turning its back.</p>
<p>We demand emergency funding be made available so that Mother Brown’s and other organizations can hire adequate staff to cook additional meals, safely provide additional showers and hygiene services, and deliver meals to seniors and disabled members of the community. Alternatively, the City could directly provide staff to aid in these life-sustaining activities.</p>
<p>In addition, with no way to shelter in place, the large unsheltered population in the Bayview and surrounding neighborhoods is at severe risk of contracting coronavirus. Since these individuals are disproportionately elderly, disabled and with health conditions that put them at increased risk of severe symptoms if infected, we demand that they be housed as part of the City’s emergency efforts to secure hotel rooms.</p>
<p>Since there are no hotels in the neighborhood, the City must make an effort to locate temporary housing options in the Bayview and surrounding neighborhoods, so that people who are temporarily housed don’t lose contact with their support networks.</p>
<p>Lastly, we demand that representatives from the Mayor’s office, HSH (Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing), DEM (Department of Emergency Management) and HSA (Human Services Agency) be in regular contact with service providers like Mother Brown’s and with other community leaders in the Bayview so that its unique needs can be taken into account and so the neighborhood is not forgotten in the implementation of emergency measures.</p>
