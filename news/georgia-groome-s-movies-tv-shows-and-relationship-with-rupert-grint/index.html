Georgia Groome has been acting professionally since 2001. (Picture: Karwai Tang/WireImage)</p>
<p>Georgia Groome and Harry Potter star Rupert Grint have been in a low-key relationship for years, but the normally media-shy couple have hit the headlines this weekend after confirming that they are expecting a child together.</p>
<p>Georgia, 28, and Rupert, 31, will both become first-time parents when they welcome their baby later this year.</p>
<p>Rupert’s rep confirmed the couple’s happy baby news in a statement shared with Metro.co.uk that said: ’Rupert Grint and Georgia Groome are excited to announce they are expecting a baby and would please ask for privacy at this time.’</p>
<p>But how long have the stars been together and where might you have seen Georgia on TV and in the movies before?</p>
<p>Georgia Groome movies and TV shows</p>
<p>Georgia, who is originally from Nottingham in the UK, shot to fame aged just 16-years-old when she got the lead role in Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging in 2008.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging is based on the book series by author Louise Rennison and saw Georgia take on a character of the same name – Georgia – who is 14 and trying to navigate the tricky obstacles of being a teenager as she approaches her fifteenth birthday.</p>

<p>Although the film was her first prominent role, Georgia – who went to acting classes at her mother’s drama school as a child – had appeared in a few TV movies and shows before the movie.</p>
<p>Her first professional acting role was in a TV movie called A Fish Out of Water in 2001.</p>
<p>She had also won a role in London to Brighton in 2006, a film about a woman and a child on the run which won awards at the British Independent Film Awards and Raindance Film Festival.</p>
<p>After her appearance in Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging, Georgia went on to take lesser known roles in TV series such as The Bill, Lewis and Up the Women.</p>

<p>She also appeared in films including Double Date, Taking Stock and The Great Ghost Resuce – although none of these roles gained her the same notoriety as her role when she was 16.</p>
<p>How long have Rupert Grint and Georgia Groome been together?</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Georgia and Rupert have been notoriously private about their relationship, preferring to stay out of the public eye where possible.</p>
<p>As a result of this, no one actually knows exactly when the pair started dating, but many reckon they’ve been together since at least 2011.</p>

<p>This theory is based on an old photo of the couple which dates their relationship back nearly a decade ago, that only surfaced on Twitter in 2018.</p>
<p>The photo circulated the internet with the caption: ‘I was today years old when I found out Georgia from Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging has been going out with Ron Weasley since 2011?’</p>

<p>Alongside the tweet was a snap of them together, with Georgia’s arm around Rupert.</p>
<p>If the pair started dating in 2011, this would mean they met three years after Georgia appeared in Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging and at around the time that Rupert was finishing his turn as Ron in the Harry Potter series of films.</p>
<p>The pair sparked wedding rumours in April 2019 when Georgia was seen wearing a gold band on her ring finger, but a rep for the couple denied that they had wed.</p>

<p>They’ve never spoken publicly about each other in an interview, but Rupert did express his desire to ‘have kids soon’ during an interview with The Guardian in December 2018. Could that have been a hint at the good news to come from Mr Grint?</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>‘I’d like to settle down and have kids soon,’ he mused on the subject of turning 30.</p>
<p>‘If I had a son, would I call him Ron? It’s quite a good name, but probably not. And Grint’s a tough name to pair a one-syllable first name with.’</p>
