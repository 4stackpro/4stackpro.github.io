<p>Buried 984 feet below the Earth’s surface, you’ll find an otherworldly landscape of crystals dwarfing human visitors. Located in the subterranean depths of the Naica Mountain in Chihuahua, Mexico, this strange landscape has been dubbed the “Sistine Chapel of Crystals.”</p>
<p>Some crystals in the cave measure upwards of 36 feet long. And the heaviest ones weigh as much as 55 tons, Believe It or Not! Until recently, the natural processes involved in forming these larger-than-life crystals remained a mystery.</p>
<p>Here’s what scientists have since learned about how these crystals grew to such immense size.</p>
<p>A Natural Marvel Like None Other</p>
<p>Two miners working for Industria Peñoles discovered Mexico’s Cueva de los Cristales (Cave of Crystals) by accident while excavating a new tunnel in 2000. They were amazed by the sight of the natural marvel and its massive crystal structures.</p>
<p>A cavity in the limestone rock, the Cave of Crystals is horseshoe-shaped. It measures approximately 30 feet wide by 90 feet long. Perfectly faceted, crystalline blocks cover the floor. Massive crystal beams jut out from both the floor and walls, creating a prismatic effect.</p>
<p>According to Juan Manuel García-Ruiz, from the University of Granada in Spain, “There is no other place on the planet where the mineral world reveals itself in such beauty.”</p>
<p>Journey to the Center of Crystal Cave</p>
<p>Yet, it would take years of scientific study before researchers determined how the giant-sized crystals grew. García-Ruiz and a team of researchers have labored away in the inhospitable environment of the cave for answers. Their working conditions proved brutal.</p>
<p>Temperatures in the cave reach upwards of 136 degrees Fahrenheit with 90 to 99 percent humidity. If that isn’t bad enough, the air in the caves is acidic. And, of course, there are no natural sources of light.</p>
<p>While these peculiar conditions have been ideal for generating crystals of epic proportions, they’re downright dangerous for researchers. As a result, García-Ruiz and his team wear special cooling suits each time they enter the cave. They also strictly adhered to no more than 45 minutes inside.</p>
<p>The Mystery of the Gigantic Crystals Solved</p>
<p>After studying tiny pockets of fluid trapped inside the crystals, García-Ruiz and his team concluded that the geological formations thrived for one reason: the strange environment of the cave. They remained submerged in mineral-rich water at the constant temperature of just below 140 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>About 26 million years ago, volcanic activity birthed Naica. It also filled the mountain with high-temperature anhydrite, a building block of crystals. Anhydrite is the anhydrous (lacking in water) form of gypsum. At 136 degrees Fahrenheit, anhydrite is stable. Below that temperature, it transforms into gypsum.</p>
<p>García-Ruiz and his team hypothesize that when the magma beneath the mountain started to cool, the temperature dropped. As a result, the anhydrite began to dissolve. As it slowly enriched the waters with calcium and sulfate molecules, these minerals deposited in the cave as giant selenium gypsum crystals.</p>
<p>An Ancient Masterpiece</p>
<p>As García-Ruiz notes, “There is no limit to the size a crystal can reach.” That said, the conditions to support such massive growth had to remain consistent for thousands of years. Just below the anhydrite-gypsum transition temperature. Researchers now believe the largest crystals inside the cave took more than 500,000 years to form.</p>
<p>Of course, the only reason humans have recently had access to the caves is because of the mining activity beneath Naica Mountain. It involves pumping the caves of their subterranean waters. The Naica mining complex contains some of the largest deposits of silver, lead, and zinc on the planet.</p>
<p>How to Preserve the Cave of the Crystals</p>
<p>How to preserve the Cave of Crystals has left the mining company in a quandary. If they stop mining operations and allow the caves to refill, then the crystals will again enjoy the ideal conditions for growth. If the caves remain drained, however, visitors can see these marvelous formations firsthand.</p>
<p>At present, the caves are closed to all but members of the scientific community. This decision is based on a variety of factors, including the cave’s extreme conditions. Without cooling suits, people who enter the mine could perish in a matter of minutes from overheating. However, it’s possible to see one of the crystals extracted from the cave, a 32-inch Selenite formation, at the Astro Gallery in New York City.</p>

<h3 id="the-bird-way-by-jennifer-ackerman-review--an-enthralling-study">&ldquo;The Bird Way by Jennifer Ackerman review – an enthralling study&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/485fbb8cd7f9e7aa8952ba582181d8c3490fe496/0_33_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=9d0e66a3578e51fd718299f0e11b2381" alt="img">
Jennifer Ackerman’s The Genius of Birds was a surprise bestseller – a peppy survey of the science of bird intelligence rivalled only by Tim Birkhead’s masterful Bird Sense in its ability to overthrow our misconceptions about the complexity and ingenuity of bird brains. Now Ackerman, one of the most acclaimed science writers in the US, is back with another book about birds, one that delves deeper into the wonders and peculiarities of the avian world, seeking to explode the conventional idea that, as the opening of the book puts it, “there is the bird way, and there is the mammal way”. This book is a celebration of the dizzying variety of bird life and behaviour, one that will enthral birders and non-birders alike.</p>
<p>The recent vogue for books about birds – started by Helen Macdonald’s H Is for Hawk and continued by Birkhead as well as in memorable titles by Adam Nicolson, Tim Dee and Ackerman herself – seems to have been mirrored by an avian turn in scientific research. Despite there being only four years between The Bird Way and its predecessor, it feels like a revolution has taken place in our understanding of birds in that time. The science here is hard, compelling and presented in Ackerman’s engaging and jargon-free prose, and on every page there is evidence to support the book’s thesis: that to speak of birds en masse is to make a category error, one that blinds us to the extraordinary variance in behaviour, appearance and even biology in these creatures we attempt to trap under the same ontological net. As American naturalist EO Wilson said: “Once you have seen one bird, you have not seen them all.”</p>
<p>Ackerman gets into a steamy fluster over the sex lives of birds in her sections on &lsquo;love&rsquo;</p>
<p>The book is arranged according to different aspects of bird behaviour. It begins with birdsong, moving from the dawn chorus to alarm calls to mimicry; then there’s a series of chapters on “work” – how birds go about providing for themselves and their offspring. After this comes “play”, perhaps the most remarkable section in the book, where Ackerman looks at “one of the most playful animals on the planet”, the raven, in a way that means you’ll never be able to read Edgar Allan Poe again without laughing.</p>
<p>Like Birkhead, Ackerman gets into a steamy fluster over the sex lives of birds in her sections on “love”, describing in intimate detail the “billing of Atlantic puffins, a gentle rubbing together of beaks in anticipation of sex”. She gives us “the sweet-seeming presentation of flower petals by male superb fairy-wrens” and the “tender mutual attentions of Fischer’s lovebirds”. She’s careful not to sentimentalise or anthropomorphise, though, noting that groups of mallard drakes will “force themselves on an unwilling female, sometimes attacking with such force and in such numbers that they kill her in the process”. We learn that while most birds have no penis, and many only copulate for a second or two in a “cloacal kiss”, 3% of living bird species (many of them waterfowl) retain the phallus found in their reptilian ancestors. Arabian babblers appear so ashamed of the sexual act that mating birds take elaborate pains to conceal the act from their fellow flock members.</p>
<p>Ackerman’s life appears to be a continent-hopping succession of astonishing encounters with birds, and there’s something powerful in a book that never feels tied to any one place, moving easily from the cave-dwelling oilbirds of north-eastern Venezuela to the keas of New Zealand to the honeyguides of Mozambique. The chain that links these birds is Ackerman’s deep interest in their behaviour and the way it adheres to the thesis of her book. It’s clear that there’s a virtuous circle at work in the scientific study of birds, so that the more we learn about them, the more we recognise the oversimplification and errors of our previous assumptions, the strange and remarkable otherness of life seen through a bird’s eye view. The Bird Way crystallises and threads together these revelations into a book full of wonders large and small.</p>

Image copyright EPA Image caption The move comes days after another mining company sparked anger by destroying ancient caves</p>
<p>The mining giant BHP has halted plans to expand a mine in Western Australia because of concerns it could destroy dozens of indigenous heritage sites.</p>
<p>It follows a public outcry over the destruction of a 46,000-year-old site by another firm, Rio Tinto, last month.</p>
<p>BHP had been granted approval to work on up to 40 sites in the remote Pilbara region as part of its expansion of an iron ore mine.</p>
<p>But on Thursday, it said it would consult further with Aboriginal groups.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will not disturb the sites identified without further extensive consultation with the Banjima people,&rdquo; a statement said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That consultation will be based on our commitment to understanding the cultural significance of the region,&rdquo; it added. &ldquo;This will include further scientific study and discussion on mitigation and preservation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not clear how the delay will affect the development of the AUD$3.6bn (USD$2.5bn; £2bn) South Flank mine, which is near the town of Newman.</p>
<p>It is due to start producing iron ore next year, local media report.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Western Australia&rsquo;s Aboriginal Affairs Minister Ben Wyatt said he had approved BHP&rsquo;s application to &ldquo;impact&rdquo; 40 heritage sites in the iron-ore rich region.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No objections were filed and I approved the notice on 29 May,&rdquo; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Mr Wyatt, who is Aboriginal, added that the area covered by the application was subject to a 2015 land use agreement that limited the Banjima people&rsquo;s ability to contest government approval, but promised co-operation from the mining company.</p>
<p>The chairman of the Banjima Native Title Aboriginal Corporation, Maitland Parker, said in a statement: &ldquo;As a matter of lore and culture&hellip; the Banjima people do not support the destruction of sites of cultural significance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Image copyright AFP Image caption The Juukan Gorge caves, in the Pilbara region, were destroyed last month</p>
<p>The decision to halt the expansion of the mine comes shortly after Rio Tinto destroyed two indigenous caves in the Juukan Gorge, about 1,075 km (667 miles) north of Perth.</p>
<p>The company later apologised for blowing up the caves, which date back to the last Ice Age, saying it was &ldquo;sorry for the distress we have caused&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are reviewing the plans of all other sites in the Juukan Gorge area,&rdquo; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>Many prehistoric artefacts have been found at the remote heritage site.</p>
<p>The destruction of the caves sparked protests and calls for urgent reform of heritage protection laws in Western Australia.

Dozens of sacred sites in the Pilbara and Goldfields regions of Western Australia are under threat from approvals granted by the State Government since the destruction of the 46,000-year-old Juukan Caves last month by Rio Tinto.</p>
<p>Key points: A letter from Banjima native title holders in the WA Pilbara said they were &ldquo;angry and hurt&rdquo; about possible destruction of 40 sacred sites</p>
<p>A letter from Banjima native title holders in the WA Pilbara said they were &ldquo;angry and hurt&rdquo; about possible destruction of 40 sacred sites The sites include ochre pits, ceremonial grounds and rock shelters with evidence of human occupation going back at least 10,000 to 15,000 years</p>
<p>The sites include ochre pits, ceremonial grounds and rock shelters with evidence of human occupation going back at least 10,000 to 15,000 years Ngalia traditional owners oppose the destruction of another seven sites in WA Goldfields region by Australian Potash</p>
<p>The latest sites under threat are in the WA Goldfields, where traditional owners claim a &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; Section 18 approval across 148 square kilometres of Ngalia land for mining company Australian Potash could destroy seven Indigenous heritage places.</p>
<p>Ngalia traditional owner Kado Muir told RN Breakfast that the heritage protection system is &ldquo;broken&rdquo; in the Goldfields region.</p>
<p>Mr Muir, an anthropologist and archaeologist, said Aboriginal people had no power to object to Section 18 approvals under the Aboriginal Heritage Act, which allows developers to disturb or destroy sites.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an expectation from government and industry in this development mindset that you [should] no longer protest or stand up for the sites on your country,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It becomes a rubber-stamp exercise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The opposition by Ngalia traditional owners in the Goldfields is similar to the concerns of traditional owners from the Banjima people in the Pilbara over the potential destruction of 40 sites in the Djadjiling Range area by BHP.</p>
<p>Traditional owners wrote in opposition to BHP development in April</p>
<p>Earlier this week, RN Breakfast revealed BHP was planning to destroy 40 Aboriginal cultural sites as part of an expansion of the $4.5 billion South Flank mine.</p>
<p>RN Breakfast has been supplied a letter that confirms senior traditional owners from the Banjima people in the Pilbara had already explicitly stated their opposition to an application for the destruction of the sites in the Djadjiling Range.</p>
<p>Banjima traditional lands around Karijini National Park in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. ( Supplied )</p>
<p>Charles Smith, senior Martidja Banyjima elder, said in the letter that he and his family were &ldquo;angry about [the Section 18 approval] and don&rsquo;t support the destruction of those sites at South Flank for any reason&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Dated April 16 this year and sent by the Banjima Native Title Aboriginal Corporation (BNTAC) to the director of Aboriginal Heritage Operations in WA, Aboriginal Affairs Minister Ben Wyatt&rsquo;s department, the letter documents senior traditional owners explicitly stating their opposition to the Section 18 approval and destruction of the sites.</p>
<p>The letter states that BNTAC&rsquo;s current chair, Maitland Parker, said he knew that the Banjima people had no legal right to object to the Section 18 approval &ldquo;in accordance with the comprehensive agreement between BHP and the Banjima People&rdquo; signed in 2015, but that the Banyyjim people felt a cumulative loss every time a site was destroyed.</p>
<p>Mr Parker said in the letter that he felt it was very important that the feelings of the Banjima people were put on record for future generations &ldquo;so they know we didn&rsquo;t just sign off on this stuff and forget about it, we put up a fight about these places, about our lore and culture&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need people to know that,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Dozens of historic Aboriginal sites across the Pilbara and Goldfields regions of WA could be under threat of destruction. ( AAP: BHP Billiton )</p>
<p>The letter states: &ldquo;The significance of the sites impacted by the Notice to Banjima People is such that Banjima People cannot and do not support the destruction of those sites as proposed by the Notice as to do so would be inconsistent with [our] cultural obligations to protect those sites[s]&quot;.</p>
<p>The cultural sites in the Ddjajaling Range were approved for destruction by Mr Wyatt on May 29 — just five days after the 46,000-year-old Juukan Caves in the west Pilbara were blown up by Rio Tinto.</p>
<p>On Thursday, BHP said it would not damage the Ddjajaling Range sites without &ldquo;further extensive consultation&rdquo; with traditional owners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That consultation …will include further scientific study and discussion on mitigation and preservation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Section 18 application by Australian Potash considered</p>
<p>The WA Government&rsquo;s Aboriginal Cultural Materials Committee (ACMC) met on Tuesday this week to consider Australian Potash&rsquo;s Section 18 application to destroy sites on Ngalia land in the Goldfields.</p>
<p>Mr Muir, who has previously served as a specialist anthropologist for the ACMC, claims Australian Potash has refused to negotiate with native title holders and is using Section 18 to avoid its responsibilities to protect heritage sites.</p>
<p>He said there were seven known cultural sites, but Australian Potash lodged their Section 18 application without conducting an Aboriginal heritage survey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need greater capacity for traditional owners and native title holders to have a veto over Section 18 applications, to have a final say over what happens to their heritage,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Australian Potash was contacted for a response but chief executive Matt Shackleton said the company would prefer not to comment at this time.</p>
<p>Minister says he approved destruction after Banjima letter</p>
<p>In a statement to RN Breakfast, Mr Wyatt said that a number of Section 18 notices had been lodged by BHP for its South Flank mine in the Pilbara, with the most recent on October 16, 2019.</p>
<p>WA Treasurer Ben Wyatt said he had asked BHP to &ldquo;avoid or minimise&rdquo; impacts on heritage sites. ( ABC News: James Carmody )</p>
<p>&ldquo;No objections were filed and I approved the notice on May 29, 2020. This notice covers 40 Aboriginal sites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sites include ochre pits, ceremonial grounds and rock shelters with evidence of human occupation going back at least 10,000 to 15,000 years, but also archaeological evidence of &ldquo;occupation of the surrounding landscape has been ongoing for approximately 40,000 years.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the Banjima people&rsquo;s opposition to the destruction of the Djadjiling Range site, Mr Wyatt said he had &ldquo;asked BHP to work with Banjima to do what it can to avoid or minimise the impact on this site, regardless of the Section 18 approval&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In a statement to RN Breakfast, BHP said it hoped to continue working with the traditional owners throughout the development of the South Flank mining operations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As part of our ongoing engagement, we speak regularly with the Banjima community and have reiterated our commitment to working closely with them through the lifecycle of the South Flank development to minimise impacts on cultural heritage,&rdquo; the statement said.</p>
<p>A Labor motion supported by the Government in Federal Parliament on Thursday will see the destruction of the Juukan Caves investigated by the Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia, including &ldquo;the interaction of state Indigenous heritage regulations with Commonwealth laws&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id="on-the-hunt-for-the-next-deadly-virus">&ldquo;On the hunt for the next deadly virus&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/science/2020/06/03/virus-hunter/virushunters_27832268445_48744d9de8_k.ngsversion.1592320488079.adapt.1900.1.jpg" alt="img">
The special packages arrived in January at the Bangkok laboratory of a virus expert named Supaporn Wacharapluesadee. They contained tubes of saliva and mucus from five people who had just landed at the city’s main airport from Wuhan, China. Days earlier, Chinese authorities had announced a cluster of mysterious pneumonia cases in Wuhan. Officials in Thailand, a top destination for Chinese tourists, rushed nurses to airports to screen arriving passengers for fevers or coughs. Health officials feared the culprit might be something nobody had ever seen.</p>
<p>“They asked me, could I detect the unknown or not?” says Wacharapluesadee.</p>
<p>There are as many as 1.6 million viruses we know nothing about lurking in mammals and birds, and as many as half might have the potential to jump to humans and infect us. That’s an estimate, based on mathematical models, but the threat is clear. Six out 10 infectious diseases that strike us come from animals. The list includes HIV/AIDS, Ebola, MERS, SARS, and in all probability COVID-19.</p>
<p>View Images Researchers with PREDICT spent several days collecting blood and other samples from bats in a colony near Wat Luang Phrommawatin temple in Chonburi, about an hour&rsquo;s drive southeast of Bangkok. To keep from testing bats more than once, researchers painted their nails purple. Photograph by Montakan Tanchaisawat, USAID</p>
<p>Scientists identified the pathogens responsible for most recent pandemics only after they started killing people. Researchers such as Wacharapluesadee say that’s too late. She’s part of a dogged international effort to find deadly viruses before they find us, in hopes of stopping lethal outbreaks.</p>
<p>For more about the work of virus hunters, check out our podcast, “Overheard at National Geographic.” Listen here.</p>
<p>Those hopes have sent Wacharapluesadee into forests, remote villages, and musk-scented caves across Thailand. Wearing thick leather gloves and holding fine-mesh, long-handled nets, she and her colleagues captured 932 bats in the early 2000s, drew their blood, released the animals, and returned to the lab to test for rabies-causing lyssaviruses. She then turned her attention to the deadly Nipah virus, which crossed from pigs to humans in Malaysia and Singapore in 1998. She tested thousands of samples of saliva, urine, and blood from 12 bat species and discovered worrisome signatures of Nipah infection in the sociable, pointy-eared Lyle’s flying fox.</p>
<p>Most bats are protected in Thailand, but their fresh blood is treasured as an aphrodisiac. Wacharapluesadee’s research led her to warn in a 2006 letter to a journal called Clinical Infectious Diseases: “Drinking bat blood may be hazardous to your health.</p>
<p>A novel cornavirus on the loose</p>
<p>For the past decade, Wacharapluesadee has collaborated with PREDICT, a U.S. Agency for International Development initiative to accelerate and coordinate global virus discovery and surveillance. The project has identified 949 novel viruses, created an extensive database of known viruses in wildlife, and trained nearly 7,000 scientists, lab technicians, and field workers in 30 countries to be on the lookout for emerging diseases.</p>
<p>PREDICT also developed low-cost tools to test blood and other specimens from animals or humans for the genetic signatures of a virus family. Conventional tests look for a specific, known virus. These broader tests make it possible to identify a mystery virus by analyzing pieces of its DNA and matching the results to the genetic profiles of well-studied relatives.</p>
<p>It was 10 p.m. in Bangkok when I Skyped with Wacharapluesadee. She was wearing a white lab coat, winding up a long day of work at the Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases Health Science Center. She told me she’d planned to begin the year on an Ebola virus hunting expedition at the famous bat cave at Wat Khao Chong Pran, where swarms of bats lift off from their roosts at sunset to form a spectacular undulating wave in the sky as they seek food. When she was alerted about the specimens from the airport, she canceled the trip. She tested them for 33 pathogens known to cause respiratory illnesses and for two virus families: influenzas and coronaviruses, which include the viruses responsible for the SARS pandemic in 2002-2003 and MERS nine years later.</p>
<p>Samples from the first four passengers turned up nothing. Then, from passenger No. 5, she detected a coronavirus. She sequenced the genome and ran the results through GenBank, a go-to DNA database for identifying novel pathogens. The virus looked much like a SARS virus found in the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat, but it was unlike anything previously detected in humans.</p>
<p>On January 9, she alerted Thai health officials that a new coronavirus was on the loose—two days before China reported to the World Health Organization that a new coronavirus had sickened 41 people in Wuhan, killing one. When China posted the virus genome online, Wacharapluesadee determined it was identical to the sequence she had found. It was the first confirmed case of the new coronavirus outside China.</p>
<p>Tracking down the viral hosts</p>
<p>View Images Researchers also tested pigs at farms located near the bat colony. Such surveillance can detect viruses that have moved from bats to swine and could also the threaten human health.

<p>Virus hunters are the swashbucklers of science, tromping through the wild and risking exposure to wretched diseases to unravel the mysteries of infectious nanoparticles. Picture the U.S. Army physicians who set up camp in a Cuban jungle during a yellow fever outbreak in the early 1900s. They hatched mosquito eggs, let the bugs suck the blood of the sick and then bite healthy volunteers, including the doctors themselves, to prove the disease was caused not by bacteria spread by poor sanitation, but by a virus carried by female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Or imagine Beatrice Hahn, a German-born microbiologist now at the University of Pennsylvania whose years-long search for the source of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) led her to chimpanzee colonies from Tanzania to the Congo River and southern Cameroon. She and her team would wake up early every morning, stand with collection baskets under the trees where chimps slumbered safely out of tigers’ reach, and catch the day’s first urine shower, then scoop feces off the jungle floor. Hahn’s research confirmed suspicions that chimps are the natural reservoir of the closest viral relative to HIV. It likely passed to people through bushmeat, causing an ongoing pandemic that has killed 32 million people.</p>
<p>The risk of zoonotic diseases—infections transmitted from animals to humans—is increasing as we muscle in on the wild. The more we raze habitat for farmland and cities, hunt and trade wildlife, vacation in remote forests, and hike through once-inaccessible caves, the greater the chances of “spillover,” as scientists call it when a virus vaults from a species it doesn’t harm into one it does, such as ours.</p>
<p>Scientists have identified about 260 viruses that infect people—a tiny fraction of what’s out there. Viruses are ubiquitous. Add them all up and they’d weigh more than all the plants and animals, though they are tiny. About 100 million particles of the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, can fit on a pinhead, virologist Peter Piot told a TEDMED interviewer earlier this year.</p>
<p>An international collaboration of scientists has announced the formidable goal of finding, identifying, and mapping 99 percent of viral threats to human health and food security within 10 years. But their effort, The Global Virome Project, faces the equally formidable task of raising the estimated $3.7 billion it would need to reach such an ambitious goal.</p>
<p>Searching for the next killer virus</p>
<p>Hunting down viruses is challenging, but it may be the easier part. The complicated part is figuring out which ones to worry about.</p>
<p>As Simon Anthony, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia University, puts it: “Of all the viruses out there, which have the genetic prerequisites to be able to infect people?”</p>
<p>And if a virus can infect people—that is, if the virus can bind to receptors on a human cell and penetrate it—will that infection kill us, cause a mild ailment, or trigger no symptoms at all? Which potentially dangerous viruses are most likely to jump from their animal hosts to humans? And where in the world would it be most likely to happen?</p>
<p>These questions drive Anthony’s research. In looking for answers, he has focused on two virus families: filoviruses, which include Ebola, and coronaviruses, which include several common viruses that cause sniffles or coughs. Nobody recognized the coronavirus family as a big problem until SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) emerged in southern China, infected nearly 8,100 people across 26 countries and caused 774 deaths.</p>
<p>Anthony was part of a major study of coronaviruses in the wild, testing more than 19,000 animals—bats, macaques, bonobos, gorillas, mandrills, rats, mice, porcupines, squirrels and more—in 20 countries over five years. The research, published in 2017, turned up 100 different coronaviruses, overwhelmingly found in bats, and helped the scientists begin to understand why some viruses can infect people and others cannot.</p>
<p>In 2018 he was part of a PREDICT team that identified a new Ebola virus, called Bombali, in free-tailed bats roosting inside people’s homes in Sierra Leone. It is the sixth known Ebola virus and the first to be discovered before triggering a deadly outbreak. Another research group soon found the virus in bats in Kenya, and a PREDICT team isolated it from bats in Guinea. “That tells us this virus is widely distributed, and we need to be able to be prepared,” said Tracey Goldstein, the PREDICT research leader, director of the One Health Institute at the University of California-Davis, and leader of the research in Sierra Leone and Guinea.</p>
<p>Spurred by the discoveries, EcoHealth Alliance, a PREDICT partner, created a picture book, Living Safely With Bats, in 12 languages. PREDICT field teams used the book in education campaigns in villages in Sierra Leone and the forest region of Guinea. The message: Don&rsquo;t eat the animals or fruit they may have contaminated. But don&rsquo;t exterminate them either, because they are important pollinators, they protect crops by eating beetles and other pests, and they can spread infection if they are disrupted. The Minister of Education in Sierra Leone brought the campaign into schools. The PREDICT effort reached thousands of people, but whether it changed behavior is unknown.</p>
<p>The Bombali discovery raised more scientific questions that it answered. “On one hand you think, OK, that&rsquo;s really scary. We have an Ebola virus living in such close proximity to people,” Anthony recalled recently. “On the other hand, you think, well, if it&rsquo;s living in such close proximity to people, and Ebola virus is really, really bad, then why aren’t we seeing outbreaks?”</p>
<p>In lab studies, Anthony demonstrated that the virus can infect human cells but less efficiently than Ebola Zaire. That strain has been responsible for most Ebola outbreaks, including the devastating epidemic in West Africa from 2014 to 2016. But three of the other four strains also can cause serious human disease, and the fourth is known to sicken pigs and non-human primates.</p>
<p>In 2019, Anthony and colleagues found genetic evidence of Ebola Zaire in a greater long-fingered bat in an abandoned mineshaft in northeast Liberia. No cases were linked to the discovery, but the country was still seared by memories of the Ebola outbreak five years earlier, which struck so furiously that bodies piled up in the capital, Monrovia. The researchers alerted the government. Officials immediately announced the findings and urged people to avoid contact with these particular cave- and forest-dwelling bats.</p>
<p>PREDICT was established in 2009 to strengthen and coordinate what had been a hit-or-miss approach to discovering viral threats and improve the scientific and technical capabilities to monitor the danger in high-risk regions. The name suggested an early warning system, like an air-raid siren screeching at us to seek cover from incoming bombs, but that is a fanciful aspiration.</p>
<p>With $207 million in funding over a decade and an unimaginably vast universe of viruses to uncover, the project had to pick its shots. PREDICT focused on five of the 71 virus families, a few dozen hot-spot regions, and the basic drivers of spillover—the complex relationship among human activity, environmental degradation, animal behavior, and virus microbiology.</p>

<p>“We are literally only at the beginning of generating the foundational knowledge that we need to try to move the needle on getting better at prediction,” Anthony said.</p>
<p>A scientist&rsquo;s predictions come true, unfortunately</p>
<p>In February 2019, a well-known virus hunter, Linfa Wang, published a virus watch list of sorts in the journal Current Opinion in Virology. It assessed the viruses most likely to jump from bats to humans, directly or through an intermediate host, and cause a pandemic. He ranked coronaviruses at the top of the list for several reasons. They spread readily, generally though coughing and sneezing. They adapt to a wide variety of hosts, including pigs, rodents, cows, civet cats, and camels—any one of which could become the intermediary between bats and us. And coronaviruses often undergo mutations and other genetic changes that can transform a benign strain into a vicious pathogen.</p>
<p>Wang directs the Program in Emerging Infectious Diseases at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. When I Skyped with him recently as COVID-19 cases swamped hospitals in the United States, I told him his assessment seemed eerily prescient. “I made a stronger, better prediction in 2013,” he said jovially. “A local newspaper interviewed me.” He promptly emailed me the article from the Straits Times with his quote: “I am almost certain that in the next 10 years, a new killer virus spread by bats will emerge.”</p>
<p>Wang was in the news at the time because he and Shi Zhengli of the Wuhan Institute of Virology had just published a paper confirming that horseshoe bats were the original carriers of the virus that had caused SARS a decade earlier. Masked palm civets, initially seen as the source, were only the intermediary. Although camels were implicated in the outbreak of MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), Wang was pretty sure they’d turn out to be middlemen, and that virus, too, would trace back to bats.</p>
<p>“That really scared me because we knew for a fact there are hundreds of thousands of coronaviruses circulating in bats all over the world,” he told me, “and now we had two major outbreaks in the space of nine years.”</p>
<p>Wang has studied bat-borne viruses for a quarter of a century, seeking to understand why bats harbor so many viruses and what their resistance to viral illness can teach us about protecting human health. His curriculum vitae lists 301 journal citations. Many warn of the possibility of pandemics, in the technical language of serology and genetics.</p>
<p>Wang and Shi—the scientist who first isolated the virus that causes COVID-19—followed up their research on SARS and bats by investigating an obvious question: How often do people get infected directly from bats? The researchers drew blood samples from 218 villagers living near bat caves in Yunnan Province. Six people had antibodies to SARS-like viruses—evidence of prior infection. None had ever been sick with SARS or had contact with SARS patients, but all had seen bats flying in their villages. The study, published in 2018, provided the first evidence of that people probably could get SARS-like infections directly from bats.</p>
<p>I asked Wang how it feels to see his most dire forecasts come to pass.</p>
<p>“As a scientist I have very mixed feelings,” he said. “I have been warning people and predicting what&rsquo;s going to happen. But now that was proved, I feel like I should not have predicted it.”</p>
<p>More investment in virus hunting needed, scientists say</p>
<p>More than two months passed between the day Wacharapluesadee identified the new coronavirus and when Thailand’s government announced one of the strictest national lockdowns. Officials came under criticism for not acting faster, but Thailand has contained the virus more effectively than most countries, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p>
<p>The center credits the country’s model health care system and its investments in health security, including infectious-disease reporting, epidemiological training, and laboratory testing. With a population of more than 69 million, Thailand had 3,125 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 58 deaths as of June 10. In a stark contrast, New York City, with 8.4 million, had 205,011 confirmed cases, 17,255 confirmed deaths, and 4,705 probable ones.</p>

<p>Virus hunting fieldwork is on hold throughout the world as countries shut down, and Wacharapluesadee doesn’t know when she’ll get back to the bat caves. But her lab is running nearly round the clock, testing specimens sent by hospitals. She’s studying the biology and activity of the new coronavirus in hopes that the knowledge can fortify us against another, inevitable viral assault. “The next pandemic could not be predicted, but we can prepare and slow down the outbreak,&rdquo; she told me.</p>
<p>While Singapore confronted two waves of COVID-19, Wang and his lab team there worked in shifts to maintain social distance as they labored frantically to develop an antibody test that would check for viral immunity. They recently they announced they had created a rapid blood test for two antibodies responsible for clearing the viral infection.</p>
<p>PREDICT was scheduled to end in March but received a six-month, $2.26 million extension to help laboratories in Asia, Africa, and Latin America with testing for COVID-19. The U.S. government has announced a successor initiative, Stop Spillover, focused more narrowly on specific zoonotic viruses, such as Ebola, Nipah, and coronaviruses, in select high-risk countries in Asia and Africa. The five-year, $100 million initiative will award funding in September.</p>
<p>Scientists who have dedicated their lives to discovering and understanding viruses say the knowledge is essential for reducing the risk and averting the next pandemic. How can you persuade people to stop drinking bat blood or get governments to clamp down on wildlife trading if you can’t tell them what viruses are out there and how likely they are to harm us?</p>
<p>The knowledge also can jumpstart the development of tests and treatments when new viruses strike—or, better yet, before, said Jonna Mazet, who was global director of PREDICT for 10 years and now runs the One Health Institute at the University of California, Davis. “If we study them all, the ones that make us sick and the ones that don’t, and if we know what makes a virus jump from species to species, we can greatly improve our diagnostics and greatly improve our risk ranking so we can start to target studies for therapeutics and maybe even a vaccine,” she said.</p>
<p>The federal government has made minuscule investments in PREDICT and Stop Spillover, compared to the $3 trillion that Congress authorized in March and April for COVID-19 response and economic relief, with no end in sight to the pandemic. But it’s hard to drum up public interest in or major funding for invisible threats before they explode into crisis.

<h3 id="doubts-about-the-nerja-cave-art-having-been-done-by-neanderthals">&ldquo;Doubts about the Nerja cave art having been done by neanderthals&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.eurekalert.org/multimedia/pub/web/233504_web.jpg" alt="img">
Dating cave art is a key issue for understanding human cognitive development. Knowing whether the ability for abstraction and conveying reality involved in artistic development is unique to Homo sapiens or if it was shared with other species, or simply knowing at what moment these abilities developed, is vital in order to understand the complexity of human evolution.</p>
<p>Currently in Spain, for the most part, when trying to find out the age of artistic expressions in caves, dating is done with U-series dating, using the two elements uranium and thorium in the underlying and overlapping layers of calcite in the paint itself.</p>
<p>However, the timeline this system proposes seems to provide evidence for erroneous ages and an inverse relationship between the concentration of uranium and the apparent ages. In order to test the reliability of this dating method, Prehistory Professor at the University of Córdoba, José Luis Sanchidrián Torti and associate researcher in Prehistory at UCO María Ángeles Medina Alcaide, who do not doubt the cognitive abilities of the Neanderthals but rather adhere to scientific rigor, performed a study in which they analyzed the reliability of Uranium-thorium dating and refute Neanderthals being the creators of the Paleolithic art in Spanish caves via the Nerja Cave. The key, according to the Cordoba team, seems to be in the mobility of uranium, which would have assigned older (and inaccurate) ages to the cave art in some Spanish caves, ascribing the art to Homo neanderthalensis.</p>
<p>The research team analyzed several samples of calcite related to the chronometric test of a set of rocks in the Nerja Cave, obtaining proof of the complexity of the dating on calcite for the study of the chronology of cave art. In this way, they directly question the generally accepted conclusions to date about the artistic manifestations in several caves being the work of Neanderthals, which had been determined based solely on the Uranium-thorium dating method.</p>
<p>In order to reconstruct the timeline of the history of cave art, Sanchidrián and Medina&rsquo;s research proposes an action protocol for dating Paleolithic art samples that uses data from three measuring systems: Uranium-thorium testing, Carbon 14 (C14) testing and a second mineralogical study of the sample before dating.</p>
<p>It is essential to study in more detail the evolution of these artistic manifestations in order to establish a rigorous and reliable chronological framework that allows us to understand and comprehend human artistic development.</p>
<h3 id="heading"></h3>
<p>This research is part of several national and international projects, listed as follows: the General Research Project of the Nerja Cave, headed by Professor Sanchidrián, and also the national project called Learning and Development of Artistic Capacity in Anatomically Modern Humans: A multidisciplinary approach (HAR2017-87739-P) (led by the University of Salamanca), the Before art: social investment in symbolic expressions during the Upper Palaeolithic project (directed by the Universidad of Cantabria) and the Cross dating by uranium-thorium, uranium-protactinium and radiocarbon of secondary carbonate cave deposits: the search for validation criteria of samples and ages. Application to rock art project?(headed by the French National Centre for Scientific Research).

<h3 id="biggest-ever-yellowstone-eruption-revealed">&ldquo;Biggest Ever Yellowstone Eruption Revealed&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/FA138D40-18AB-4258-AF2F48F3A093D9B5.jpg" alt="img">
Roughly 8.7 million years ago, in areas that would become southern Idaho and northern Nevada, the grasslands began to break open, unleashing curtains of lava and clouds of gas and ash that rolled across the North American landscape. Within hours, if not minutes, the land would have been pummeled by black volcanic glass that rained from above, killing animals such as rhinoceroses, camels, and horses that roamed the region, and destroying plants. Soon the ground would cave in altogether. The event was the largest explosion ever from the supervolcano in Yellowstone National Park.</p>
<p>And scientists just found out about it. A recent study published in Geology identified evidence for this supereruption and estimated it was 30 percent larger than the previous record holder, which occurred 2.1 million years ago. Both eruptions were colossal. Supervolcanoes have the ability to destroy entire regions and send enough ash and gas into the air to alter the climate. The one at Yellowstone, scientists believe, is fueled by a column of hot rock that emerges from deep within the planet. As North America’s tectonic plate slowly drifts over that plume, the supervolcano’s surface activity moves from place to place. Over the past 16.5 million years, it has spouted major eruptions from Oregon to Wyoming. Today it powers Yellowstone’s simmering landscape of geysers and hot springs and is is often a favorite doomsday topic on social media and Web sites trafficking in rumors. The new research indicates the volcano’s history was even more violent than geologists had thought, but there are hints the hotspot could be waning in intensity.</p>
<p>[Read about the difference between supervolcanoes and smaller eruptions.]</p>
<p>Researchers led by geochemist Thomas Knott of the University of Leicester in England first analyzed volcanic deposits that were previously believed to belong to smaller discrete eruptions. But when Knott and his colleagues took a closer look at the rocks—determining their chemical composition and age—it was clear that they shared the same origin. John Wolff, a volcanologist at Washington State University, who reviewed the new paper but was not directly involved in the research, calls the rock-matching work “first-class.” It took a significant effort from Knott’s team, with months spent in the field and an array of analytic techniques used back in the lab. “I don&rsquo;t know how many different ways you can look at rocks, but this is most of them,” says Michael McCurry, a geologist at Idaho State University.</p>
<p>The volcanic deposits were scattered across tens of thousands of square kilometers. Only a supereruption could spread gas and ash so far. “When you get your maps out and measure the scale, you think, ‘That can’t be right. They can’t possibly be that far apart and be from the same volcanic eruption,’” Knott says. “And when you realize they are, you realize just how insignificant you are in terms of the colossal power of things that nature can put upon us.”</p>
<p>The event, now dubbed the Grey’s Landing supereruption (after a spot in Idaho where the deposit is best preserved), likely ejected 2,800 cubic kilometers of material, Knott’s team calculated. So much ash and rock could fill nearly three quarters of the Grand Canyon. The amount places Grey’s Landing in the ranks of the top supereruptions of all time. And it puts the event on par with the infamous Toba superuption in Indonesia about 74,000 years ago, which some scientists have theorized may have brought humans to the brink of extinction.</p>
<p>The investigators also uncovered a second supereruption, which occurred nine million years ago and likely blew out 1,700 cubic kilometers of material. Although the extent of both that occurrence and Grey’s Landing are estimates, given that the team was not able to overturn every rock, Wolff agrees that it would be inconceivable for volcanic deposits to stretch across such vast distances unless they were created by supereruptions.</p>
<p>Knott’s team notes that these two events look vastly different from more recent Yellowstone eruptions. Not only were they larger, but they were also hotter and occurred in rapid succession. At that time, supereruptions ravaged the Yellowstone hotspot track once every 500,000 years. Today that rate has dropped to 1.5 million years. All clues indicate that Yellowstone was much more violent in its adolescence, and Knott’s next project is to find out why. Is the hotspot itself is dying out? Or is the continental crust above that plume thicker than it once was, providing a lid that dampened the most recent events?</p>
<p>Although the current rate of eruptions suggests that another explosion will not occur for roughly 900,000 years, Knott points out this estimate is simply a historical average, and it does not forecast how and when nature will act. “We don’t want to encourage complacency—nor do we want to fearmonger,” he says.
