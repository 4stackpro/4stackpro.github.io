<p>This story is from November 26, 2019</p>
<p>Hyderabad: US-based chipmaker Intel is all set to step up its presence in Hyderabad with plans to open its new technology development centre in the IT hub of Madhapur shortly.</p>
<p>The new Intel tech development centre spread over nearly 3 lakh sq ft is coming up at an IT park next to ITC Kohenur and will have a capacity to seat close to 1,500 people, realty sources told TOI.</p>
<p>“Intel has acquired 5-6 floors at the upcoming Salarpuria Sattva Knowledge City for the design centre which will be opening next week,” sources said.</p>
<p>According to sources, the new tech development centre will have SoC (system on chip) capabilities. Incidentally, Intel had acqui-hired about 100 engineers of Hyderabad-based fabless semiconductor player Ineda Systems for their skills in graphics earlier this year and had said the transaction would provide it “with an experienced SoC (system on chip) team to help build a world-class discrete GPU business”.</p>
<p>It was only in November last year that a delegation led by Intel India chief Nivruti Rai had met then IT minister KT Rama Rao and communicated Intel’s intent to set up a development centre with a capacity of around 1500 engineers in the city.</p>
<p>Intel’s new tech development centre comes on the heels of US-based ecommerce giant Amazon opening its largest office building anywhere in the world in the city in August this year, even as Chinese smartphone maker OnePlus dialed Hyderabad for its largest R&amp;D centre in the world in the city soon after.</p>

The semiconductor world and companies like Google are looking at India talent to create the new kinds of chip&hellip; Read More</p>
<p>• Google, Facebook , Amazon, Alibaba, Apple, Samsung and Microsoft are all accelerating efforts to design chips• Most are poaching talent from traditional chip designers like Intel, Qualcomm, Nvidia, and from each other• Google’s setting up a team in Bengaluru for chip design, and the majority of its 66 job openings in the city are for this function• Qualcomm has 263 job openings now in India (130 in Bengaluru, 107 in Hyderabad), second only to California at 458. Only other country with a three digit figure is China• Intel’s city-wise job openings has Bengaluru at the top, with 403, followed by Hillsboro (Oregon, US) at 244Put all of that together, and what we have is a picture of something dramatically new happening in chip design, and India, alongside the US, being at the centre of it. That new is an effort to integrate new digital technologies such as AI, machine learning, and internet-of-things (IoT) with silicon. The more tightly software and hardware features are integrated, the better the applications run.Apple did it for iPhones, and is now increasingly doing it for other products. Google’s doing it for its Pixel phones and AI-controlled gadgets. Amazon’s created a chip focused on AI, and is working on one for its cloud infrastructure. The traditional chip giants, at risk of losing business from some of their biggest customers, are on the same path.“Silicon has come back into vogue. There’s this big resurgence of specialised hardware, of chip design,” says Anirudh Devgan, president of Cadence Design Systems, one of the world’s biggest suppliers of software tools to the semiconductor industry.He says specialised AI chips can beat the traditional CPU by orders of magnitude. “You will see more of the car companies designing their own chips, cloud providers doing it, mobile phone companies and systems companies doing it,” he says.Vincent Roche, CEO of Analog Devices, which designs chips that sense real-world phenomena like temperature, vibration, and air quality, says such analog chips integrated with AI algorithms can analyse and interpret data much better, and have a variety of applications, including predicting machine failure in factories.Pradip Dutta, MD for India of semiconductor tools company Synopsys, says IoT-driven chips are going into the sensors on big turbines and aircraft engine blades to instantly communicate data about how they are functioning. “Security is another big area that’s being integrated into hardware design,” he says.The US and China both have excellent chip design talent. But the US talent is just not enough for US companies, and it is to India that they typically look for the talent they need. Bipin Pendyala, managing committee member of the Hyderabad Software Enterprises Association (HYSEA), says new developments in chip design has spurred a huge demand for skillsets in analog design, physical design, digital design, ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) design and ASIC verification. “Electronics engineers with these skillsets command a 20-30% premium over their software counterparts in the IT industry,” he says. Fathima Farouk, HR head for India at semiconductor company AMD, says they plan to add over 350 engineers in 2019, and there are a variety of openings, including for performance architecture, physical design, performance verification, machine learning, drivers and compiler development, and in embedded.Dasaradha Gude, whose Hyderabad-based chip design company Ineda was bought by Intel earlier this year, says China is falling out of favour globally because of issues like the trade war. So India is becoming a particularly favoured destination for chip design. “Every major semiconductor player is looking at India, which is why the number of jobs in this space, which currently stands at around 40,000, is poised to double over the next five years,” he says.

<p>Intel Corporation will open its new design and engineering centre in Hyderabad on December 2. “Happy to share that global tech leader Intel will be unveiling their new design and engineering centre in Hyderabad on December 2. Excited that this will further boost Hyderabad’s position as a key product innovation destination,” Telangana’s Information Technology Minister K. T. Rama Rao tweeted.</p>
<p>The US-based firm has set up the huge facility at Salarpuria Knowledge City in the IT corridor of Madhapur. The firm is reported to have taken four floors on lease for the centre, which will have seating capacity of 1,500.</p>
<p>It was in November last year that the minister had made the announcement of Intel setting up shop here after Intel India country head Nivruti Rai had met him.</p>
<p>Intel, which has completed 20 years in India, earlier this year acquired part of Ineda Systems, a Hyderabad-based semiconductor design startup. The US-based firm acquired 100 engineers of Ineda for their skills in graphics, an area on which the design and engineering centre is likely to focus along with Artificial Intelligence and 5G.</p>
<p>Intel facility will be the latest addition to the list of marquee names in Hyderabad that includes Microsoft, Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. Intel facility has come up three months after US-based e-commerce giant Amazon opened its largest office building anywhere in the world.</p>

This story is from February 18, 2019</p>
<p>HYDERABAD: US-based chip giant Intel Corporation, which has been shopping for new technologies and skilled talent, has quietly snapped up Hyderabad-based startup Ineda Systems , a low-key fabless semiconductor product company, for an undisclosed amount.</p>
<p>The all-cash deal sealed last week is more in the nature of an acquihire — a transaction in which a company is acquired mainly for the skill sets of its workforce rather than products or services. According to sources, Intel has acquired around 100 engineers of Ineda for their skills in graphics, an area where the US giant has chalked out ambitious plans. It is learnt that Intel will also be acquiring the leased Ineda Systems office in Kondapur, located near Google, which currently houses the engineering talent acquired.</p>
<p>Ineda shot to fame after its chips for wearables</p>
<p>Ineda Systems founder Dasaradha Gude confirmed the development, but refused to divulge any details. When TOI reached out to Intel, officials confirmed the deal but they too declined to disclose transaction details.</p>
<p>“Intel acquired engineering resources from Ineda Systems, a silicon and platform services provider based in Hyderabad. This transaction provides Intel with an experienced SOC (system on chip) team to help build a world-class discrete GPU business,” an Intel spokesperson told TOI.</p>
<p>Ineda Systems, which was set up in 2010-11 by Hyderabad based serial entrepreneur Dasaradha Gude, operates in the sphere of autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and IoT. The startup hit the headlines in 2013-14 for its design and development of low-power Dhanush chips for wearable devices and had raised over $60 million from big-ticket investors, including Samsung Catalyst Fund, Qualcomm Ventures, Walden-Riverwood Ventures, Imagination Technologies, among others, but ran into rough weather after it shifted gears to automotive technologies. Gude, who founded Ineda after he quit as AMD India managing director, remained an investor in Ineda though he went on to set up Invecas in 2014 and regained 100% stake in Ineda in Nov 2018. Intel, which has a few hundred engineers engaged in software development in Hyderabad, is also planning to set up a global technology centre in Hyderabad housing around 1,500 engineers initially, which may be ramped up to 5,000 people, as per an announcement made by then IT minister KT Rama Rao’s office in Nov 2018.</p>

<h3 id="twins-to-re-sign-michael-pineda">&ldquo;Twins To Re-Sign Michael Pineda&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.mlbtraderumors.com/files/2019/06/michael-pineda-twins-1024x683.jpg" alt="img">
The Twins have re-signed right-hander Michael Pineda to a two-year deal, Pierre Noujaim of FOX 9 Minneapolis reports (Twitter link). The Athletic’s Dan Hayes reports that Pineda will earn $20MM on the deal, which will become official after Pineda passes a physical. Pineda is represented by ISE Baseball.</p>
<p>Pineda will exactly double the two-year, $10MM deal he originally signed with Minnesota in the 2017-18 season, a contract that was really a one-year pact given that Pineda had undergone Tommy John surgery and missed all of 2018. This new contract also comes in the midst of some extenuating circumstances, as Pineda is still in the midst of a 60-game PED suspension and will miss the first 39 games of the 2020 season. That 60-game absence was originally an 80-game suspension, reduced on appeal since Pineda (who turns 31 in January) was able to provide evidence that the hydrochlorothiazide found in his system wasn’t being used as a PED masking agent.</p>
<p>While this situation could have made some teams wary about Pineda’s 2019 performance, and perhaps paved the way for him to return the team that knew him best, there was ample interest in his services. Darren Wolfson of 5 Eyewitness News reports that the Blue Jays, Giants, Rangers, Braves, and White Sox also looked at adding Pineda in free agency. MLBTR ranked Pineda 17th on our list of the winter’s top 50 free agents, and his contract fell just shy of the $22MM we projected he would land on a two-year deal.</p>
<p>In the wake of his TJ surgery, Pineda delivered arguably the best season of his career in 2019, posting a 4.01 ERA, 8.6 K/9, and 5.00 K/BB rate over 146 innings. It wasn’t an entirely smooth year, since he had two minimal injured list stints (for a triceps strain and knee tendinitis), and Pineda also had one of the game’s least-impressive spin rates.</p>
<p>Still, a 2.7 fWAR season coming off Tommy John surgery is certainly sturdy, and the Twins can expect even more from the righty once he returns in May. While multiple injuries and issues with the home run ball have dimmed the profile of a player who was considered one of the sport’s top pitching prospects, Pineda looks like a very solid mid-rotation candidate in this next phase of his career.</p>
<p>Facing one of the more dire pitching situations of any contender heading into the offseason, the Twins have now brought back both Pineda and Jake Odorizzi, who accepted the club’s one-year, $17.8MM qualifying offer. Getting Odorizzi and Pineda back at reasonable prices before the Winter Meetings is already a nice result for Minnesota, who still have up to two more rotation spots to fill beyond ace Jose Berrios. The next arm could come at a much higher price, as the Twins are making a push to sign Madison Bumgarner, and they also made Zack Wheeler an offer before Wheeler signed with the Phillies.</p>

Intel buys Hyderabad-based semiconductor startup Ineda Systems</p>
<p>The all-cash deal will see Intel acquiring 100 engineers from Ineda for their skill in graphics.</p>
<p>Atom Tech Shorts</p>
<p>Ineda Systems, a Hyderabad based firm has been quietly acquired by chipset making giant Intel Corporation. Though the financial details of this transaction have not been disclosed, it is being 100-odd engineers working with Ineda Systems who have skills in graphics will now be moved to Intel. Intel seemingly has been scouting for talent in this area of graphics and by securing the services of these skilled engineers in one shot, Intel would have felt investment it made is worth the dollars it would have parted with. Along with the staff located in the Telangana capital, Intel plans to buy out the building they are currently housed in, which is on lease.</p>
<p>A confirmation on this development has come from the Ineda side but the full details of the deal are not in public domain. Intel on the other hand has also issued a broad statement without going into the nitty-gritties. “Intel acquired engineering resources from Ineda Systems, a silicon and platform services provider based in Hyderabad. This transaction provides Intel with an experienced SOC (system on chip) team to help build a world-class discrete GPU business” is what Intel has shared with Economic Times, which has reported the development.</p>
<p>Ineda Systems has been working on new generation technologies, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and IoT. Having started in 2011, the company came up with a chip for wearables called Dhanush, in 2013-14. This turned the focus on the startup and it could receive investments to the extent of over $60 million and the investments came from the investment arms of Samsung and Qualcomm besides others.</p>
<p>Intel appears to be having ambitious plans for its facility in Hyderabad, where it hopes to ramp up the employee count to 5000 engineers. This is expected to be a technology centre of global scale and size.

<p>An Israeli company with an office in San Francisco, Moovit also has created a mobility journey planner app. This morning, the tech giant confirmed the acquisition but at a price of $900 million. The buy marks Intel’s first known buy of 2020, according to Crunchbase data.</p>
<p>Moovit operates as a software-as-a-service provider and has 800 million users across all platforms, according to its website. It offers its services in 3,200 cities across 103 countries. Moovit first launched as a free app in 2012 for iOS, Android and Web browsers to help “guide people in getting around town effectively and conveniently using any mode of transit.”</p>
<p>The company has raised $131.5 million over its lifetime, according to Crunchbase data. Intel’s venture arm, Intel Capital, led the company’s $50 million Series D in February 2018, according to Crunchbase, which shows that at the time the company was valued at $131.5 million. So, an acquisition for a $900 million purchase price just two years later is impressive.</p>
<p>Other backers include Sequoia Capital Israel, Gemini Israel Ventures, and BMW iVentures, among others.</p>
<p>Moovit has around 200 employees, according to Intel, which noted that in the past two years, “Moovit has achieved a seven-times increase in users.”</p>
<p>In 2017, Intel acquired Mobileye, also based in Israel, for $15.3 billion.</p>
<p>Upon close of this latest acquisition, Moovit will join the Mobileye business while retaining its brand and existing partnerships, according to Intel.</p>
<p>“Mobileye’s [advanced driver assistance systems] technology is already improving the safety of millions of cars on the road, and Moovit accelerates their ability to truly revolutionize transportation — reducing congestion and saving lives — as a full-stack mobility provider,” said Intel CEO Bob Swan, in a press release.</p>
<p>Acquisitive</p>
<p>In late 2019, Intel picked up another Israeli company, Habana, for $2 billion. With reports of the latest buy, we thought it would be a good time to take a quick look at Intel’s acquisition history.</p>
<p>We found that since its 1968 inception, Intel has made 97 known acquisitions. In 2019, Intel made five known buys, according to Crunchbase data. Besides Habana, it also picked up Smart Edge for $27 million, Barefoot Networks, Omnitek and Ineda Systems.</p>
<p>That compares to three acquisitions in 2018 and just one in 2017. But 2019 wasn’t Intel’s most acquisitive year. In 2016, the tech giant scooped up a total of nine companies.</p>
<p>Intel’s acquisition of Moovit is reminiscent of Google’s 2013 buy of Waze. In April, Shmulik Karpf, a global equity analyst for Israel’s Bank Leumi, told Cacalist in an interview that “in both cases, the acquired company is the developer of a free mobile app providing a navigation optimization service to individuals and companies.”</p>
