The children got Malory Towers. Now it’s the grownups’ turn. Just as the BBC’s Enid Blyton adaptation was brought forward to keep the juvenile masses entertained when the schools shut early, so the corporation has pulled season three of Killing Eve (BBC Three) from its intended summer slot and placed it before us. Hopefully it can provide some welcome relief to the unique and uniquely wearing combination of panic and boredom that characterises life in lockdown.</p>
<p>It will, I hope, not count as a spoiler if I say that Eve (Sandra Oh) is alive. She survived Villanelle’s (Jodie Comer) bullet in Rome. Somehow the supreme assassin did not linger to see if she had done her job properly, or put an extra couple of bullets through her victim’s head to make sure, meaning Eve is now back in England, working in the kitchen of a Chinese restaurant and occasionally visiting her husband, Niko, who is in rehab.</p>
<p>Villanelle is marrying a rich Spanish woman and inappropriately musing, as secret pseudo-lover killers will, about her ex during the wedding speech (“I’m so much happier now she’s dead”) before launching herself at an unexpected guest – her former trainer and handler Dasha (Harriet Walter). After a knockdown, drag-out fight between erstwhile mentor and mentee, Villanelle is restored to the assassin fold via the promise of being made a “keeper” (management-level stuff, which promises to work out as well for the world’s most dedicated and impatient loner as you might think) and sent out on another job to check her murderous skill set hasn’t rusted since it was last exercised.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Carolyn (Fiona Shaw, whose character is given more emotional meat to chew on by the end of the first episode than she has had for the entire run so far) is being punished for her various unauthorised actions over the past series. A “Whitehall warrior”, Paul Bradville, has been given her office and most of her authority. He is played to perfection by Steve Pemberton, who specialises in people who make your hackles rise and your teeth itch as soon as they open their mouths.</p>
<p>Carolyn’s son, Kenny, is still living with her but has left MI6, disgusted and infuriated by the events of last season and his mother’s hand in them, and is working as a journalist for a website called Bitter Pill. While you might be able to take the boy out of the intelligence services, the boy remains curious, and is continuing to investigate – to his ultimate detriment – the activities of The Twelve, who do not seem as chastened as you might hope. “Now I’m back,” he says, when Carolyn recalls his “defection” from his original post at MI6 for the Foreign Office. “With bells on!” “So we can hear you coming,” says Carolyn, because Carolyn gonna Carolyn til the end of time, and I, for one, will slavishly follow her until the scroll rolls up.</p>
<p>And it’s all fine. It’s fun, with gasp-out-loud moments, and the series remains visually more appealing than almost anything else currently on screen. Comer is compelling, and with Eve in the aftermath of trauma, Oh gets the chance to add some depth to the detective. But there are fewer glorious flourishes so far, aesthetically, verbally or narratively. Even Villanelle’s first job, though lauded as a triumphant improvement on a legendary hit by Dasha back in her own heyday, feels underpowered (though in fairness this may partly be in order to lull us into a false sense of complacency before the closing scenes back in London).</p>
<p>Like the second series, it is still a high-quality, high-wire act, but it cannot quite match the verve and wit of Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s original episodes. A further burden now – and one shouldered by any subsequent series after one based on a cat-and-mouse premise – is that the artifice is showing. More and more elaborate ways must now be found to keep Eve and Villanelle apart, and other plotlines added to keep the central relationship from fulfilment and – given this one’s essentially fatal nature – ending. So Killing Eve is becoming less dark, less knotty and more traditionally procedural, which feels like a sad loss even if what remains is still head and shoulders above the competition.</p>
<p>Only a supreme cynic would wonder if its transfer from the summer slot to now, with a wholly captive audience, wasn’t just a very welcome supplement to our viewing diets but also a useful boon for the programme itself. But here we are. Even if Killing Eve isn’t quite killing it as she used to, it’s good to have her back.

<h3 id="killing-eve-series-3-star-wars-episode-ix-and-more-heres-the-latest-releases-on-netflix-amazon-prime-and-other-streaming-services">Killing Eve Series 3, Star Wars Episode IX and more: here&rsquo;s the latest releases on Netflix, Amazon Prime and other streaming services</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.kentonline.co.uk/_media/img/YCFGBLUPFIB1NRKIM4Z4.jpg" alt="img">
Desperate to see another slice of Killing Eve, or catch up on the latest episode of Star Wars?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s this week&rsquo;s biggest releases on Netfix, Amazon Prime and other streaming services:</p>
<p>Killing Eve – Series 3 Picture: PA Photo/BBC/Sid Gentle</p>
<p>SERIES Killing Eve</p>
<p>BBC iPlayer</p>
<p>The first two series are already available to stream, but let&rsquo;s face it, what we really want to see is the third run. Well, it&rsquo;s here at last. Will it live up to expectations? There&rsquo;s every reason to believe so. The last time we saw the central characters, Villanelle shot Eve, leaving fans with one helluva cliffhanger to deal with. When we pick up with them again, Eve is dead to Villanelle, but very much alive to everyone else. She&rsquo;s hiding in plain sight, hoping that her nemesis won&rsquo;t come looking for her. Life seems to be reverting back to normal when a shocking death sets them on a collision course once again. If for some reason you don&rsquo;t or can&rsquo;t catch it online from Easter Monday, don&rsquo;t panic - the series debuts on BBC One from Sunday.</p>

<p>FILM OF THE WEEK</p>
<p>Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise Of Skywalker</p>
<p>Amazon Prime Video, Sky Store and other download services</p>
<p>Following the death of mentor Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Rey (Daisy Ridley) finds herself on a parallel journey of self-discovery to Kylo Ren, who has assumed the position of Supreme Leader of the First Order after the demise of Snoke. Finn, Chewbacca, X-Wing pilot Poe Dameron and C-3POaccompany Rey on her daredevil mission, while General Leia Organa presides over the entrenched Resistance. The Rise Of Skywalker shoehorns every conceivable reason for viewers to whoop, cheer and - yes - surrender to steady trickles of saltwater into 141 minutes. It&rsquo;s not always the most elegant film-making and the opening 20 minutes are extremely clunky. However, when planets align, director JJ Abrams delivers rousing action sequences, including one of the series&rsquo; most visually stunning lightsaber duels, and he engineers a fitting farewell to the late Carrie Fisher using unreleased footage.</p>
<p>Rating: ***</p>

<p>DOCUMENTARY The Innocence Files</p>
<p>Netflix</p>
<p>True crime stories are at the fore once again in Netflix&rsquo;s latest documentary series. The nine episode run is split into three compelling parts - the evidence, the witness and the prosecution - while discussing eight cases of wrongful conviction dealt with by the non-profit Innocence Project. Among those featured are Chester Hollman III, who spent 28 years behind bars after being convicted of murder, death row exoneree Alfred Dewayne Brown, and Levon Brooks, who was sentenced to life in prison after false forensic testimony &lsquo;proved&rsquo; he raped and killed his ex-girlfriend&rsquo;s daughter, allowing the real culprit to remain free to commit other atrocities. It&rsquo;s not easy viewing, but the programme does highlight the need for the Innocence Project&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Here We Are: Notes for Living on Planet Earth</p>
<p>Apple TV+</p>
<p>Next Wednesday, April 22, is Earth Day, not that any of us will get to see much of the planet, seeing as we&rsquo;re all still in lockdown. Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s a 24-hour period in which we&rsquo;re meant to demonstrate our support for the environment. Apple TV+ is marking it a little early via this short animation based on Oliver Jeffers&rsquo; bestselling book. The tome is designed to act as a kind of visitors&rsquo; guide, to inhabitants both old and new, revealing fascinating facts about our extraordinary planet. The animation does the same by following a seven-year-old boy as he learns about Earth from his parents. Jacob Tremblay, Meryl Streep, Chris O&rsquo;Dowd and Ruth Negga are among the vocal cast.</p>
<p>Here We Are on Apple TV</p>
<p>FILM Richard Jewell</p>
<p>Amazon Prime Video, BT TV Store and other download services</p>
<p>American biographical drama film directed and produced by Clint Eastwood. American security guard Richard Jewell saves thousands of lives from an exploding bomb at the 1996 Olympics, but is vilified by journalists and the press who falsely reported that he was a terrorist. Based on a Vanity Fair article, Richard Jewell is a quietly indignant drama that sees scriptwriter Billy Ray distil three months of trial by media and at least one potential violation of Jewell&rsquo;s civic rights into a compelling character study. The film is anchored by a winning performance from Paull Walter Hauser as the do-gooder, who pursues public service with a tenacity that errs uncomfortably close to obsession.</p>
<p>Rating: ****</p>
<p>Richard Jewell starring Sam Rockwell as Watson Bryant, Paul Walter Hauser as Richard Jewell and Kathy Bates as Barbara Jewell Picture: PA Photo/Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc./Claire Folger</p>
<p>SERIES Mafia Only Kills in Summer s2</p>
<p>All 4</p>
<p>The Italian series offering a hugely original, comedic insight into the Mafia during the 1970s is back for its second 12-part run. During the previous season, the Gianmmarresi family had contemplated leaving Sicily, but Salvatore had decided against it, unwilling to leave his homeland at the mercy of murderous villains. The story picks up as the clan returns home, determined to carry on as normal, despite the threat of Mafia retaliation forming a shadow over their lives. Lorenzo, however, is ready to ask for a transfer north to escape the situation, while Pia lands a new teaching job - and finds herself fatally attracted once again to mobster Tommaso Buscetta.</p>
<p>SERIES Run</p>
<p>Eight episodes, exclusively on NOW TV</p>
<p>The past wreaks havoc in the present in the eight-part HBO comedy Run from the team behind Fleabag, which screens in weekly instalments on Sky Comedy and streams exclusively on NOW TV. Ruby and her college sweetheart Billy make an outlandish pact. If one of the them texts the word &ldquo;Run&rdquo; and the other replies in kind, they will both drop everything and head immediately to Grand Central Station in New York City to embark on a cross-country American odyssey. Seventeen years later, Ruby lives in the suburbs with her husband Laurence while Billy is forging a career, separate from former PA Fiona. When the word &ldquo;Run&rdquo; appears on each other&rsquo;s mobile phones, Ruby and Billy instinctively honour their pact and board a train in Manhattan without a clue to their ultimate destination.</p>
<p>Domhnall Gleeson as Billy and Merritt Wever as Ruby in Run</p>
<p>SERIES Noughts + Crosses</p>
<p>Amazon Video, BBC iPlayer and other download services</p>
<p>Based on Malorie Blackman&rsquo;s series of young adult novels, Noughts + Crosses is a provocative drama set in an alternative historical timeline. In this 21st century, Africans have made Europeans their slaves and segregation is robustly enforced to keep apart the white underclass (Noughts) from the black elite (Crosses). Against a backdrop of simmering social tension, Sephy, the daughter of the Home Secretary, sparks forbidden love with her childhood friend Callum McGregor. He is the son of the family&rsquo;s housekeeper, Meggie (Helen Baxendale from Friends). Sephy&rsquo;s boyfriend, military officer Lieutenant Lekan Baako, becomes suspicious and when he discovers her betrayal across the class divide, he vows swift revenge.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-watch-killing-eve-online-stream-season-3-from-anywhere">How to watch Killing Eve online: stream season 3 from anywhere</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xwprLPS5h32RatztA8GGSL-1200-80.jpg" alt="img">
It&rsquo;s back! Phoebe Waller-Bridge&rsquo;s Killing Eve returns for a third season and its stars Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer are still in the midst of their endless cat-and-mouse game. Ready to jump right back in? Here&rsquo;s how to watch Killing Eve online and stream season 3 no matter where you are in the world.</p>
<p>Killing Eve season 3 cheat sheet Killing Eve premiered in 2018 on the BBC and has already been renewed for a fourth season - so fans can rest assured that 2020 isn&rsquo;t the last they&rsquo;ll see of Eve and Villanelle&hellip;or could it be? Those keen to jump ahead in the plot can always look to the Villanelle novel series, by author Luke Jennings, which serves as the basis for Killing Eve as adapted and produced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s safe to say that Killing Eve was a critical hit when it was first released, one that was praised for the way to cleverly moulded classic elements of suspense with quirky dark humour - the latter being one of Waller-Bridge&rsquo;s specialities.</p>
<p>Prime example, when you see that the new episode of a BAFTA-winning TV show is called &lsquo;Slowly Slowly Catchy Monkey&rsquo; - who else could it really be?</p>
<p>Killing Eve season 3 reviews have been more mixed, but anyone who has gotten this far into the show will no doubt want to see what it&rsquo;s like for themselves - and given the current circumstances in many countries around the world, what&rsquo;s to stop you?</p>
<p>In the US, it can still comfortably rival most of the best Hulu shows around - so follow our guide as we explain all the easiest ways to watch Killing Eve season 3 and stream the show online from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Nerves of steel? Here&rsquo;s how to watch Contagion online</p>
<p>Watch Killing Eve online from outside your country</p>
<p>The coronavirus may have put old paradigms like holidays and work trips to bed temporarily, but the fact is international travel will one day resume in full - and you may even be stuck outside your country of origin, for whatever reason. If and when that&rsquo;s the case, you could be forgiven for wanting a taste of home comforts, especially now.</p>
<p>If that means streaming the services you normally would, geo-blocking can prove to be a major obstacle - but fortunately there&rsquo;s an easy solution. Using a little handy trick, you can get around these pesky digital borders using a VPN. This will allow you to gain access to Killing Eve as it happens by changing your IP to your nation of residence. But which VPN is best for you?</p>
<p>After extensive testing, our personal favourite is ExpressVPN, which lets you change your IP address on pretty much whatever device you have, be it laptop, mobile, Roku, Amazon Fire TV Stick, Apple TV, games console, etc, so that it thinks it is in a different location. We consider ExpressVPN to be the best because it&rsquo;s so easy and straightforward. It also has very fast connections and watertight security. You can try it with a 30-day money back guarantee, or go for a much better value annual plan where there&rsquo;s a massive 49% off and an extra 3 months free. Once you have it, go ahead and open the VPN app, hit &lsquo;choose location&rsquo; to virtually transport yourself home - it&rsquo;s super easy to do. Once you&rsquo;ve changed to an appropriate region, you just need to go to your home broadcaster and then you&rsquo;re ready to watch all the Killing Eve action.</p>
<p>How to watch Killing Eve season 3 online for free in the UK</p>
<p>The BBC is doubling-down on its digital credentials with Killing Eve season 3, airing the hit spy thriller on iPlayer before dropping it on terrestrial TV. This means that in the UK you&rsquo;ll be able to watch the first episode of Killing Eve season 3 online via the Beeb&rsquo;s streaming service on Monday, April 13 - it should be uploaded by around 6am BST, we&rsquo;re told, and subsequent episodes are expected to get the same release date and time. It also means that a large number of people can watch Killing Eve for free - as all you need to stream iPlayer is a valid UK TV license. For more analogue types, Killing Eve season 3, episode 1 will be aired on BBC One at 9pm on Sunday, April 19.</p>

<p>How to watch Killing Eve season 3 online in the US</p>
<p>The US has it even better than UK when it comes to watching Killing Eve season 3 online. That&rsquo;s because the Beeb has given first dibs to its BBC America off-shoot - where the Killing Eve season 3, episode 1 release date is slated for 9pm ET / 8pm CT on Sunday, April 12. The only catch is you can also watch it on AMC at the same time. The good news is that many cable packages offer these channels as part of their bundles - consult your local provider for details. But for cord-cutting types, the best option may be Hulu, which offers both! The popular over-the-top streaming service offers packages starting from just $5.99 a month - and they include BBC America and AMC. Better still, you can take advantage of a FREE Hulu trial period to see if it&rsquo;s right for you. And remember, if you&rsquo;ve mismatched a holiday or just so happen to be out of the US when you want to watch it - you can always use a VPN.</p>
<p>How to watch Killing Eve online in Australia</p>
<p>Aussies have it pretty sweet when it comes to where to watch Killing Eve - ABC&rsquo;s iview streaming service promises the season premiere will be live for streaming on Monday, April 13 at 12pm local time. And as ever, anyone who normally resides Down Under but finds themselves out of the country during this particularly difficult time can use a VPN to reconnect to the services and platforms they would normally use at home.</p>
<p>How to watch Killing Eve online: free streaming guide for seasons 1 and 2</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re new to Killing Eve, then there are worse things to do during a global pandemic than watch the first two seasons of the hit show.</p>
<p>Anyone in the UK or the US has it good, as the BBC show is available on a number of convenient streaming services.</p>
<p>In the US, simply check out a FREE Hulu trial and you&rsquo;ll get the first two seasons of Killing Eve. But do note that you&rsquo;ll need its higher-end Hulu + Live TV package, which normally costs $54.99 a month but gives you on-demand and live access to loads of shows including Killing Eve - get a free Hulu + Live TV trial here.</p>
<p>Although BBC America does also offer its own option for a free season 2 Killing Eve stream - as does AMC to the best of our knowledge.</p>
<p>In the UK, it&rsquo;s all gratis provided you hold a valid TV license in the country - in which case just tune into BBC iPlayer and watch Killing Eve seasons 1 and 2 for free online.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in Australia, you can watch Killing Eve season 1 on Stan - but beyond that you&rsquo;re looking at paying to buy the show via a platform like iTunes.
