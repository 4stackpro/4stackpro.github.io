Covid-19 has pushed media houses to ICU</p>
<p>As the coronavirus continues its relentless spread across the world, infecting over a million people and killing tens of thousands, news stories of lockdowns, social distancing and overwhelmed hospitals have been making the headlines just about everywhere. Newsrooms have been working overtime to keep the communities they serve updated. Audiences have surged. Apart from news reports, people are turning to analysis and commentaries, videos and explainers, to help them make sense of the fast-evolving and far-reaching crisis. Amid the welter of information swirling about on social media, professional newsrooms which have long invested in building expertise, have been meeting the public’s hunger for objective reporting, based on journalists speaking to informed sources, providing context and perspective, drawing on historical knowledge and institutional memory.</p>
<p>SEE ALSO: Here are our top 10 most read stories in 2019</p>
<p>These have also helped inoculate communities against that other virus that is on the rampage - fake news - which is sowing anxiety and confusion, as well as undermining the public’s trust in the reliability of information they receive at this critical time. Amid all of these, some reporters have succumbed to the virus while on the job. Some newsrooms have had to evacuate hurriedly, with staff rushing home, laptops in hand, to try to keep their platforms updated and the presses rolling. But here’s the heart-breaking news: Among the victims in the intensive care unit, gasping for breath, are some of the media organisations themselves, alongside many others from sectors that have also been hard hit, from aviation to retail.</p>

<p>Several, especially local and vernacular titles, might not be able to meet their financial commitments, or even pay staff salaries, in the months ahead.</p>

<p>Advertising is drying up, plunging by between 30 per cent and 80 per cent, according to a recent survey by the World Association of News Publishers. Revenues from media-related events, a new and growing source of funds, have also plunged, as social distancing measures are put in place. Many newsrooms, including The Standard Group PLC, have also made content on the pandemic freely available, as a public service, thereby constraining their ability to grow revenues from subscriptions. The upshot of this is both ironic and tragic: At a time when audiences are turning increasingly to established media titles, as recent surveys have shown, newsrooms are seeing their resources gutted, and some are even being shut. In the United States, Gannett, the largest American newspaper chain, announced last week plans to cut salaries and lay-off some staff temporarily, while Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp has said it will stop print editions of 60 newspapers in Australia, with similar measures being taken in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. This has heightened concerns about the emergence of “news deserts” - communities with no access to local government and community news as media groups cease to exist there.</p>

<p>There is also much angst over “ghost newsrooms”, titles which are snapped up by investors as they are still profitable, who then slash their reporting capabilities to boost margins, resulting in a lack of resources to produce local, original or independent content. The implications of these developments for society are grave. At a time when communities are most in need of critical information, many newsrooms are increasingly hampered and finding it harder to deliver on their mission. This has led the WHO to warn of a coming “infodemic”, with misinformation spreading and undermining public trust at a crucial time. To be sure, the financial struggles faced by newsrooms is hardly news. Oxford historian Timothy Garton Ash pointed to this in a keynote address at the St Gallen Symposium in Switzerland in May 2017. He said: “Very simply, the Internet is destroying the business model of newspapers. For at least two centuries, we have had a public good - news, the information we need for democracy - delivered by private means…People would pay for a newspaper and (there was also) advertising revenue. The Internet has just knocked away both these pillars. So the newspapers produce the information. Facebook and Google get the profit.</p>

<p>“And this has a very negative effect on the newspapers on which we have relied for our news&hellip;The amount of serious news, investigative journalism and foreign reporting is going down because that’s expensive. “This is a real problem for the journalism we need for democracy.” Covid-19, however, has mercilessly compounded this challenge and hastened both the shift to digital and the plunge in advertising. So, is there an antidote to the virus-induced media malaise? Among the proposals that media leaders have been making to their stakeholders are: - Declaring the media an essential service: To enable journalists to go about their jobs during lockdowns, keeping newsrooms functioning and news agents running; - Granting financial assistance: These include tax breaks or holidays, short-term loans and wage subsidies to help newsrooms pay their staff and bills in the face of falling revenues. Denmark has set up a Euro 25 million fund which will grant news outlets that have recently seen revenues fall by between 30 per cent and 50 per cent relief of up to 60 per cent of their losses, while in Lithuania, state subsidies are also given for critical infrastructure such as broadcasting and printing facilities; - Giving tax incentives for advertisers and subscribers: In Italy, advertisers are given tax deductions of 30 per cent of their spending in newspapers and online, while Canada allows subscribers to news titles to claim tax relief; - Stepping up government advertising: Public education campaigns tied to the pandemic can help make up for the fall in private advertising;- Making Big Tech pay: Technology platforms should be pressed, as France has done, to make more meaningful contributions to the news outlets they rely on for content. While these steps might see media groups through the crisis, they are not without risks. Not least of which is the damage that could be done to the credibility of the media if it becomes overly dependent on state funding. This is especially a concern in societies with painful experiences of governments seeking to muzzle the media, through cuts in funding and advertising, shutdowns of newsrooms and arrests of journalists. To safeguard against this, beyond the crisis, new business models will also have to be fashioned to ensure the media remains viable and sustainable for the long haul. Various experiments are underway. While some big players like New York Times and Financial Times are growing subscription revenues from readers, others such as the Washington Post, the South China Morning Post and Los Angeles Times, have been bought by wealthy business leaders, who have given these newsrooms a boost, by investing in journalism and technology. Elsewhere, media groups have been given mandates by the state, with funding for public service broadcasts and journalism, as in France, Britain and the Scandinavian countries. Some newsrooms have opted to be public trusts or not-for-profit companies, with a mission to provide public service journalism, such as the Guardian in the UK, and The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Salt Lake Tribune in the US, and also Japan’s Nikkei group. Which of these models works best remains unclear; nor perhaps is there likely to be one model that works for all, given the very different political histories and cultures that newsrooms operate in around the world. People will need to make sense of developments unfolding around them as well as to figure out the way forward. To do so, they will need news organisations they consider credible, which they can rely on, and trust.</p>

Couple holds 30-minute wedding worth Sh80k with nine guests</p>
<p>Rachael Wanjugu with her husband George Lewis Kariuki after they had a 30 minutes wedding. [Boniface Gikandi]</p>
<p>For two months, George Lewis Kariuki and his fiancée Rachael Wanjugu have been anxious as they made final plans for their so-to-be ‘big wedding day’.April 25 was the day the lovebirds had scheduled for the event, when they would say ‘Yes I Do’ committing to a lifetime relationship. Most things went down as planned except for the date, the list of guests to witness the exchange of vows and the amount of time they took, thanks to Covid-19 crisis that has disrupted daily life across the world. PCEA Muhito church in Mukurwe-ini, Nyeri County would have been packed to capacity as friends and family witness the vows but only two seats were occupied in the church with guests keeping the one-and–half metre rule.</p>

<p>Kariuki swapped over 500-person park wedding to a nine-person ceremony after a deliberate agreement not to cancel or postpone the event as Covid-19 crisis continue wreak havoc on social activities. The wedding was held on Monday, three weeks before the scheduled date. The family had to forgo a glamorous wedding detail, from an exquisite table setting, floral arrangements, elegantly dressed maids and grooms, for a simple ceremony that lasted 30 minutes. Only nine family members and friends and the officiating priest were allowed. The initial wedding budget stood at Sh1.2 million but they spent Sh80,000 only for a ceremony that took 30 minutes. One item they had to add on their list of must have was bottles of sanitiser for their guests.</p>

<p>“It did not happen as we had wished but we had fun at the church and at the reception party. It was a simple but beautiful ceremony,” said Wanjugu. The State has restricted weddings and funerals to have only 15 people and to take just 30 minutes.</p>

<p>“We could not cancel the wedding because we were on the final stage of arrangements. Bookings for the reception venue had been done, we had already hired a photographer and our guests had invitation cards,” said Kariuki.</p>

Family demands autopsy for kin buried at 2am</p>
<p>The grave where James Onyango, a suspected Covid-19 victim was hurriedly buried at night. [Collins Oduor, Standard]</p>
<p>The family of a man said to have died from coronavirus and hurriedly buried in Siaya County now wants the body exhumed and a postmortem examination performed.Zack Onyango, the victim’s brother who is also the family spokesperson, said yesterday in a phone interview that the family was demanding a postmortem examination to establish the real cause of his death. James Onyango, who was a senior Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) official, was buried at 2am on Sunday, barely four hours after his death. Zack, who is currently locked in quarantine with 15 other family members after coming into contact with his brother, said his bother may have died of injuries he suffered during an accident at Awasi, while on his way to Kisumu.</p>

<p>Zack was yesterday heart-broken as he narrated his brother’s final moments. “They buried him like a dog. They did not give us a death certificate. We don’t know what killed him. We are devastated. It is sad beyond human imagination.” He added: ”Even if it’s true he died of coronavirus, he did not deserve this heartless treatment. We have coronavirus victims who have been accorded decent burials, complete with eulogies. We want him exhumed and a postmortem performed. Then we can accord him a decent burial.”</p>

<p>He further explained how soon after confirming that his brother had died, the family went to Ukwala and placed an order for a coffin. “We paid Sh11,000 deposit and I returned home to prepare for the burial. Shortly after 9pm, a team came to our home. I called the chief to report the turn of events. I soon realised my brother was to be buried the same night,” said Zack.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Siaya County Covid-19 Emergency Committee officials fumbled while trying to explain their role in the night burial. Area governor Cornell Rasanga, who chairs the committee, apologised to the family. Mr Rasanga said he did not issue any orders for such a burial to take place. The committee’s vice-chairman Michael ole Tialal refused to comment on the matter. Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe on Sunday said tests done at Kenya Medical Research Institute, and whose results he said were released long after Onyango’s death, proved he had Covid-19. By yesterday, the government had confined 45 people who came into contact with Onyango and was still hunting for 70 more.</p>

<p>The Law Society of Kenya (LSK) said it will move to court to seek orders to exhume Onyango’s remains in preparation for a decent burial. Society’s President Nelson Havi said he has already liaised with LSK West Kenya branch to file the suit under a certificate of urgency. The lawyer’s body said it will ask the court to declare that the rights of the deceased and his family were violated as per international and Luo customary laws. “We want the body exhumed and given a decent daytime burial with a coffin,” said Havi. Siaya Senator also added his voice to those condemning the burial.</p>

<p>“I witnessed an undignified burial in the dead of the night. We are confronted with challenges but let’s not forget our humanity even as tragedy strikes,” said Mr Orengo. Only hours after he died at a private hospital in Ukwala, Onyango’s body was wrapped in two body bags, loaded into a double cabin pick-up, and driven to his home in Kamalungi village. There, his burial took less than five minutes. No one spoke; no one prayed; no one saw the body.</p>
