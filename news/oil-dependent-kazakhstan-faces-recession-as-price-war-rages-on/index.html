The government in Kazakhstan has, in the light of the unfolding coronavirus pandemic and the concomitant fall in global oil prices, revised its economic projections for this year to forecast a 0.9 percent contraction.</p>
<p>Before the current crisis hit, gross domestic product, or GDP, had been expected to expand by 4 percent.</p>
<p>National Economy Minister Ruslan Dalenov said on April 2 that the value of Kazakhstan’s exports has been especially badly hit.</p>
<p>“Exports will drop by $16.3 billion to $35.1 billion. Imports will decline by $7.5 billion to $26.6 billion,” he said. “(Anticipated) nominal GDP is estimated at 69.7 trillion tenge ($155 billion), which is 4.8 trillion tenge ($10.6 billion) lower than the earlier forecast.”</p>
<p>Dalenov pointed to the confluence of negative global factors as the main contribution to the slowdown. The government’s radical measures to halt coronavirus in its tracks have brought vast swathes of the economy to a standstill.</p>
<p>The fall in the value of Kazakhstan’s most valuable commodities has been precipitous. By the government’s own estimates, the value of its oil exports has collapsed by 65.7 percent since the start of the year, and the average price for metals has fallen by 15.6 percent.</p>
<p>“Bearing that in mind, the average (assumed) price for oil in April-December this year has been set at $20 per barrel. The estimated dollar rate is 440 tenge and annual inflation will be in the range of 9-11 percent,” Dalenov said.</p>
<p>This is a dramatic change from the assumptions underlying earlier budget plans, which saw oil at $55 per barrel, the tenge at 380 to the dollar and inflation targeted at 4-6 percent.</p>
<p>Forecasts on oil production are being trimmed too. Output is now set at 86 million tons, down by 4 million tons. Large slumps are anticipated in the mining, manufacturing, agriculture, construction and service industries, as well as in trade.</p>
<p>Speaking at a press conference on April, First Deputy Finance Minister Berik Sholpankulov said that the government intends to raise 2.4 trillion tenge ($5.3 billion) in debt to paper over its budget deficit. About $3 billion will be raised on the international debt market, he said.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan is loosening its purse strings to minimize the broader social impact of the crisis. On March 31, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev announced more details of a package intended to bolster support for welfare recipients and help business weather the storm. Sholpankulov said 5.9 trillion tenge ($13 billion) were being earmarked for that purpose.</p>

<p>The scale of the economic slump, which will, if the government’s own projections are accurate, outdo even the 2008-2009 crash in gravity, is forcing Nur-Sultan to dig deep into its pockets. One important source of relief is the rainy-day National Fund, which will be central to the government’s plan to spend its way out of trouble.</p>
<p>Those reserves are currently worth around $60 billion. Reuters news agency has reported that the government intends to use up 4.8 trillion tenge ($10.6 billion at current rates) from that pot this year, up from the 2.7 trillion tenge ($6 billion) it intended to use previously.</p>
<p>Economist Meruert Makhmutova wrote on Facebook that the recurrent need to raid the piggybank is forcing the government to learn some hard lessons.</p>
<p>“In 2015-2016 (when oil prices were low), Kazakhstan spent twice as much (out of the National Fund) as it earned from oil. This year, that difference between revenues and spending from (fund reserves) will evidently be threefold. We will have to learn to live without oil.”</p>

<h3 id="iea-this-oil-shock-is-the-worst-in-history">IEA: This Oil Shock Is The Worst In History</h3>
<p><img src="https://d32r1sh890xpii.cloudfront.net/news/718x300/2020-04-02_482agkirxv.jpg" alt="img">
The world has seen some oil shocks before, but “none has hit the industry with quite the ferocity we are witnessing today,” the IEA said on Wednesday in an article on its website, referring to the effects of the coronavirus crisis that have caused oil prices to crumble.</p>
<p>“The impacts will be felt throughout oil’s global supply chains and ripple into other parts of the energy sector,” the IEA said.</p>
<p>While focusing on the coronavirus, the IEA also mentions the supply shock, which it tactfully blames on the “end of restraints on production from OPEC producers and Russia (OPEC+),” stopping short of singling out a few OPEC producers that have promised to purposefully flood the market with millions of extra barrels of oil per day, such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE.</p>
<p>The reason the shock is unique this time around, the IAE says, is because one of the usual stabilization factors, consumers, is not able to do its part. As billions of people around the world still in lockdown, consumers are unable to react to falling prices like they usually do—by consuming more. So for as long as the pandemic lasts, boosts in demand that were seen during other oil shocks are “highly unlikely.”</p>
<p>“Instead, a rapid buildup of oil stocks is starting to saturate available storage capacity, pushing down prices further,” the IEA said.</p>
<p>The IAE also outlined five key dimensions to the current crisis, which it promises to detail further in its upcoming Oil Market Report that will be forthcoming in a couple of weeks. Those five elements are current production grinding to a halt, “sharp” cuts to new investments all the way down the supply chain, pressure on refiners, “massive” strains on fossil-fuel-revenue-dependent countries, and low oil prices spilling over into the rest of the energy sector such as natural gas.</p>
<p>The IEA said that comparing the current shock to previous oil market disruptions “are inevitable but misplaced,” adding that we have “never seen anything like 2020.</p>

<p><img src="https://d32r1sh890xpii.cloudfront.net/news/718x300/2020-04-02_jjefqw7r8d.jpg" alt="img">
While oil firms race to announce spending cuts, Apache Corporation said on Thursday it had made a significant oil discovery offshore Suriname in South America, its second major oil find in the area this year.</p>
<p>Apache and France’s Total struck oil at the Sapakara West-1 well drilled on Block 58 offshore Suriname, a country and a basin neighboring Guyana, where ExxonMobil has found recoverable resources estimated at 8 billion oil-equivalent barrels.</p>
<p>In January this year, Apache and Total announced a significant oil discovery on Block 58, stoking hopes that the prolific Guyana discoveries are extending into the waters of neighboring Suriname. Apache and Total made their first oil discovery in Suriname at the Maka Central-1 well drilled offshore Suriname on Block 58, in which Total had just acquired a 50-percent working interest and operatorship.</p>
<p>“The new license expands our positions in the Guyana-Suriname Basin, a highly favorable petroleum province,” Arnaud Breuillac, President, Exploration &amp; Production at Total, said at the end of December, when the French company announced the deal.</p>
<p>Related: U.S. Drillers Face Doomsday Scenario As Some Crude Blends Hit $1</p>
<p>Commenting on the new discovery offshore Suriname, John J. Christmann, Apache CEO and President, said today:</p>
<p>“Our second discovery offshore Suriname this year further proves our geologic model and confirms a large hydrocarbon system in two play types on Block 58. Based on a conservative estimate of net pay across multiple fan systems, we have discovered another very substantial oil resource with the Sapakara West-1 well.”</p>
<p>Apache has identified at least seven distinct play types and more than 50 prospects within the thermally mature play fairway, the company said.</p>
<p>Major discoveries offshore Suriname could turn the South American country into an oil producer, the way significant oil discoveries made its neighbor Guyana the world’s newest oil producer. At the end of last year, Guyana officially joined the ranks of oil producing nations, after ExxonMobil and its partners began oil production offshore the South American country.</p>
