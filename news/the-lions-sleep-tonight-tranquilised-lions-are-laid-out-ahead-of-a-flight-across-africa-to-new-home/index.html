<p>A conservationist has undertaken one of &lsquo;history&rsquo;s biggest habitat recovery projects&rsquo; and moved 24 lions from five locations across South Africa to a new home hundreds of miles away.</p>
<p>Ivan Carter and his team transported the animals by plane and truck to the Zambeze Delta in Mozambique, an area which has been without the predators for 30 years due to poaching.</p>
<p>The conservationists carefully selected lions with good pedigree which had been roaming free all of their lives. The animals were then kept in a large enclosure for six weeks so they could get to know each other.</p>
<p>Mr Carter is delighted to report that the movement of the lions - which took place in May 2018 - has been an amazing success and the number of lions on the nature reserve has trebled to 60.</p>
<p>A hundred years ago more than 200,000 lions roamed across Africa. Habitat loss and human conflict has decimated their population, now thought to be in the region of 20,000.</p>

<p>Ten tranquilized lions have hoods put over their heads by the conservationists as they prepare to move them to their new home at the Zabeze Delta Conservation in Mozambique. The conservationists carefully selected lions with good pedigree who had been roaming free all of their lives. The animals were then kept in a large enclosure for six weeks so they could get to know each other.</p>
<p>Lions lying in the back of the plane for transportation to Mozambique. After careful consideration, Mr Carter and the team, selected the healthiest lions to transport via car and plane to their forever home which has two million acres of land in May 2018. The project was a massive success as they have now tripled in numbers and theres over 60 lions</p>
<p>Fifteen of the 24 Lions released into the Zambezi Delta have been tagged to allow for monitoring. Additional satellite collars have been placed on buffalo, sable, zebra, reedbuck and warthog. The tracking data allows the staff to measure changes in their behaviour</p>

<p>The Cabela Family Foundation has partnered with Zambeze Delta Conservation, Ivan Carter Wildlife Conservation Alliance, and ANAC to reverse this trend in the Zambeze Delta Ecosystem.</p>
<p>Mark Haldane, CEO of Zambeze Delta Safaris, who works with the Cabela Family Foundation, started a mission on 1995 to bring game back to the region.</p>
<p>On its 24Lions website, the group says: &lsquo;In 1995 when Haldane started on this mission, wildlife was almost zero. Well managed responsible use of wildlife and the ecosystem has resulted in an expansion of game numbers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is the very foundation upon which this initiative has been made possible, and with the very highest rate of success. The hunter&rsquo;s dollars that flow through this area have funded this recovery in its entirety.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In 2018, 66 tons of sustainably harvested meat was distributed to the local community in return for a zero poaching policy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Carter from White River, South Africa, said: &lsquo;It was quite exciting moving the lions from around five different locations in South Africa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We had to pick those with good genetics and health who have been roaming free all of their lives - this was done by taking them to the vets for tests prior to putting them into quarantine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They were in a large enclosure for six weeks and put into groups so they could integrate, otherwise, they would have just walked straight off and the habitat recovery project would have been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We had to get various permits and vet certificates and had to ensure the Zabeza Delta conservation had enough prey base there for the lions to survive.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The whole project took ten weeks, from the moment the first dart was shot to the second the first lion stepped foot back into the wild.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was an unbelievably momentous moment watching the majestic lion repopulating the area!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr Carter praised Cabela Family Foundation for funding the relocation, seven years of follow up science and research and protection for the lions.</p>
<p>He said: &lsquo;Without the foundation, we would have never been able to make this happen.</p>

I loved high school; despite my red hair I had a great time. &ldquo;So you weren&rsquo;t bullied, like at all?&rdquo; new friends probe. My pleasurable high school experience is confounding to some. &ldquo;So you were a nerd then?&rdquo; they press further. &ldquo;No, I was into sport mostly,&rdquo; I reply.</p>
<p>As we know it&rsquo;s one or the other, you&rsquo;re sporty or good at physics, a crossover is very rare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So were you naughty, always in trouble then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The questions keep coming, trying to pinpoint how I survived the high school ecosystem with red, curly hair and an unhealthy obsession with Peter Andre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was naughty once, and once only,&rdquo; I reply.</p>
<p>I wagged the interhouse choral competition in 1999. What a weight off my chest - finally admitting that.</p>
<p>Each house had to prepare a hymn and a song of their choice to sing against the other houses. The song of choice had to be &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; and also able to be played on the piano in the hall by someone from the music staff.</p>
<p>My house, Tennyson, prepared a hymn that I don&rsquo;t remember, and our contemporary song was The Lion Sleeps Tonight. We had worked on some basic choreography and really made the most of the &ldquo;A-weema-weh&rsquo;s&rdquo; by throwing our hands up in the air, teamed with a sidestep hoping for extra points from the judges.</p>
<p>Mel Buttle wagged her interhouse choral competition in 1999.</p>
<p>Singing and dancing are not my strong points, and in my 17-year-old head I allowed myself to believe all eyes would be on me, and my shonky dance moves and off-key singing would be the topic of ridicule. The bell rang to end lunch and we were all due in the hall. I hung back while everyone filtered off, I was cooking a plan up, still not sure what I was going to do.</p>
<p>Eventually it was just me. I was about to wag for the first time. I hadn&rsquo;t thought this through and panic set in. It was too late to slip into the hall without being noticed, so I hid behind a door. Of course. From 12.50pm until the bell went at 3.20pm. Nothing to do, no phone, no book to read. I just stood there, terrified of being caught.</p>
<p>Now whenever I hear The Lion Sleeps Tonight, my heart races and my palms get sweaty, then they fly up in the air and I have an urge to sidestep.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.americansongwriter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/15195139/broken-poet-elliott-as-Jake-Lion.jpg" alt="img">
Elliott Murphy is the anonymous rock star. A recording artist for 40 years with 35 albums to his name, he lives in the anonymity of fame, or perhaps it’s the fame of anonymity. A staple of the New York underground scene in the ‘70s who counts Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen as fans and friends, he’s been awarded the Chevalier des Arts et Lettres by the French Minister of Culture, the country where he’s lived since the ‘70s. He’s never had a huge hit, but still performs regularly to good-sized crowds, and for the most part can walk the streets without recognition.</p>
<p>Touted in the early ‘70s as one of the new Dylans, Murphy was one of several artists (along with Springsteen, Loudon Wainwright and John Prine) destined to grab the musical poetry baton and lead us into a new wave of folk enlightenment. It’s a label he doesn’t particularly think fits, and one we’re only using to give historical context. But like Dylan, he did get the travelin’ bug when he was young, and in 1971 the wordsmith of Garden City, NY hit the road for Europe with guitar in hand and set up shop in Paris, where he built a dedicated following.</p>
<p>All this leads to Broken Poet, the new movie written by Murphy and directed by Spanish director Emilio Ruiz, which, in a roundabout, metaphysical way, parallels a few elements of his own career.</p>
<p>Based on a short story Murphy wrote in 1985 entitled “The Lion Sleeps Tonight,” the plot centers around the ‘70s rock star Jake Lion, who is presumed to have committed suicide 40 years ago in Paris. A former roadie happens to be riding the Paris Metro years later and hears an old street musician singing who sounds just like him. Is it Jake? Time to investigate, says Rolling Stone magazine, who sends a journalist to unravel the mystery.</p>
<p>Broken Poet’s plot line is cleverly advanced via key songs in Murphy’s music catalog sprinkled throughout the film, from “Last Of The Rockstars,” the first song off his debut Aquashow to his most recent releases.</p>
<p>Broken Poet also features a rare cameo appearance by Bruce Springsteen and his wife Patti Scialfa, playing themselves. The two discuss their time as contemporaries of Lion and reflect on what made him tick and why he may (or may not) have killed himself.</p>
<p>The film also features Michael O’Keefe, Marisa Berenson, Joanna Preiss and Françoise Viallon. Originally intended to premiere in March as the opening film of the 2020 New York City International Film Festival, but cancelled due to the pandemic, Broken Poet is available online via Vimeo On Demand at the Springsteen fan site Backstreets.</p>
<p>We chatted with Elliott via phone recently to get his take on the mythology of dead rock stars, fame, New York City in the ‘70s and rock journalism.</p>

<p>Did you enjoy acting?</p>
<p>I did in this particular role. It wasn’t that big of a stretch for me. The guy I’m playing is a musician who’s my age. And I wrote the original story the movie was based on, so I had a lot of sources to dig into to play the role. I had done a bit of acting before, but this was my first real role.</p>
<p>Have you ever played on the streets like the character does?</p>
<p>I did. When I first came to Europe in 1971, I played on the streets in Amsterdam, Paris, Rome. Quite a few songs on my first album Aquashow I began there. I realized it didn’t matter what you were playing on the streets. If people heard a good sound, they would throw money in your hat.</p>
<p>When did production for the movie start and end?</p>
<p>It was in the fall of 2018. I had a book of short stories published called “Paris Stories,” which was picked up for Spanish translation. I did a festival in Spain in the spring of 2018 and I met this director Emilio Ruiz and we hit it off. I gave him one of my books and then he searched and found another. He got back to me and thought that particular story would make a good film. Over the summer we wrote the script, started the casting process and I reached out to people I knew, like Michael O’Keefe. Things came together quickly. We did three weeks in Paris and then another week in New York.</p>
<p>How did you decide to feature Bruce Springsteen in the movie playing himself, along with his wife Patti?</p>
<p>We had finished shooting the film in Paris and were heading to New York. Emilio felt it still needed something else to give it a sense of reality- a real rock star talking about this fictional rock star. And I suggested Bruce. There was a documentary about my career a few years back called “The Second Act of Elliott Murphy” and Bruce had appeared in that, along with Billy Joel. I called Bruce and being the incredible, generous and supportive guy, he agreed. I wanted Patti in there too. I thought it would be more interesting to have them as a couple, and also to get a woman’s point of view.</p>
<p>I was not there when they did the scene. Bruce had to change the date because he was doing the Broadway show. Patti stuck more to the script and I think she kind of led Bruce in the way they responded. Bruce didn’t stick to the lines. It was his general picture and view of the character Jake and when he knew him, and it was accurate.</p>
<p>Bruce improvised some of the dialogue?</p>
<p>I gave Bruce the script but most of what he said, he said off the top of his head. He knew the story. He talked about how that kind of fame, that huge kind of fame, is not for everybody. And it’s not. You lose that anonymity where you can’t go out on the street without security. That’s living in a whole different world. Unfortunately, in our world of rock and roll, the usual way out is drugs, rather than faking your death or settling in Tasmania.</p>
<p>His performance in the scene is very believable.</p>
<p>Not only in the way that he spoke about Jake, but in the way he responded. You can hear him thinking in the scene. When I saw it afterwards I was amazed. I can’t thank him enough.</p>
<p>How did you come up with the name Jake Lion?</p>
<p>The original story was ‘The Lion Sleeps Tonight.’ I wrote it in the early ‘80s during what I call ‘my dark period.’ I left the majors, or they left me. I had done four albums and was trying to find my way as an independent, which hardly existed at that time. My career was slowly shifting from America to Europe. I was writing a lot of fiction, including a story for Rolling Stone magazine. And I wrote quite a few stories for a magazine called Music and Sound Output. And one of them was ‘The Lion Sleeps Tonight.’ The song factors into the story. ‘We’re going to let that Jake Lion sleep wherever he wants.’</p>
<p>When it came time to make the movie, there had just been a movie with that same name, so Emilio decided to call our movie “Broken Poet” and that was fine with me.</p>
<p>There’s a connection made with Phantom of the Opera.</p>
<p>I don’t really know it that well. That was Emilio. He was really into it and saw a connection between the two. There are elements that were brought into the film that weren’t in the original script. We needed to put a backstory to Jake.</p>
<p>You threw some subtle New York music references into the movie, like the Max’s Kansas City T-shirts, which I thought was a nice touch.</p>
<p>That is my original T-shirt by the way! A lot of New York artists had our musical homes and Max’s was definitely my club. I was a little before the CBGB’s scene. I liked the history of Max’s. The Velvet Underground played there. It was also home to a lot of singer/songwriters where CBGB’s wasn’t.</p>
<p>You also quoted Willy Deville in one scene.</p>
<p>I knew Willy. I once interviewed him for an Italian magazine. He had just come back from a shopping expedition for walking canes. He was quite a dandy.</p>
<p>What is the difference between song lyrics and memorizing movie lyrics?</p>
<p>That is a very good question. That was the biggest difficulty for me, memorizing the lines of the script. Once the camera is on and you go blank in the middle of a scene, you have to start again. It’s terrible. Luckily my wife Francoise, who I’ve been married to for thirty years, is an actress and she helped me. And Michael O’Keefe came here and helped me with the emotional input as well as the lines.</p>
<p>The biggest difference is, with songs, you have the music guiding the words. You know when you’re going to the chorus or the bridge. The music is the river that you flow down. The movie is free flowing. You really have to memorize it so well that you don’t think about it.</p>
<p>Plus, when you’re performing you have a guitar in your hand, which is almost like a security blanket.</p>
<p>Exactly! It’s the greatest prop. Who is the Peanuts character? Linus. That’s kind of the same deal. But yeah, once I learned the lines, it wasn’t so bad.</p>
<p>I think if it wasn’t for Francoise and Michael, I would have learned the lines. But to really own the character the line has to become second nature to you and just become part of the character as you’re playing them.</p>
<p>Do you keep up on new music and see new artists?</p>
<p>I do. Seeing them and hearing them are different things. My son Gaspard is a producer and mixer so he’s my source of what’s going on and new. He told me to listen to Lana Del Rey, so I did. But getting out to shows, not so much. When you tour as much as I do, it’s a holiday to not go out. The last show I did see, though, was John Prine.</p>
<p>Tell us about your relationship with John.</p>
<p>John, myself and Bruce were branded by the press as the new Dylan’s when we first came out in the early ‘70s. John may have been a little before. Bruce’s second album and my first were next to each other in a Rolling Stone review, as the ‘Best new Dylan’s since 1968.’ I was aware of John and met him in 1975 when I was recording my second album.</p>
<p>This time in Paris was the first time I really talked to him. It was like two veterans of the war getting together. We laughed about the new Dylan stuff because when that first happened Dylan was in his thirties and he we were both in our seventies.</p>
<p>John liked Europe. We talked about doing some shows together in Spain. My big regret was not taking a picture. But it was great to see him and chat for a while.</p>
<p>Speaking of your son, he scored the movie. Did you assist?</p>
<p>I pretty much let Gaspard go on his own. He studied production and all that at SUNY-Purchase. He knows how to do it. All that ambient music was composed, scored and arranged by him. Most of my songs in the film were chosen by Emilio. I had a few I put in and I wrote the theme song “Theme For A Broken Poet” with Gaspar.</p>
<p>Was it a challenge for you to place the sequence of songs in specific scenes in the movie?</p>
<p>I wanted Emilio to be free to put them where he wanted. We moved things around a little bit. As you know, a songwriter’s view of his songs is quite different than the way a listener interprets the lyrics. Where I sit it might be too subjective.</p>
<p>I was happy that we were able to get the rights from Polydor to put in the original recording of “Last of the Rockstars.” We re-recorded the song “Lost Generation” and most of the other songs were from the last ten years.</p>
<p>Do you own your own publishing?</p>
<p>Not for everything. I own a lot of it, everything except my two RCA albums. I own half the publishing on those.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the scene where you describe playing Madison Square Garden. You make a point of saying how different it is when you’re playing for record executives who are in the first two rows rather than fans. That’s a perspective most people don’t have.</p>
<p>Ironically, there’s another line I had after that where I said, ‘and the sound sucks.’ Two weeks after we filmed that scene, I was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame by none other than Billy Joel. Another fantastic, generous guy and one of the finest musicians I know. After that, he invited me to come join him onstage at his Madison Square Garden show to sing “Walk On The Wild Side.” So I got up and sang it. And the sound was fantastic! (laughs). So I told Emilio “you have to get rid of that line because it’s not true!”</p>
<p>It must have been a thrill to be inducted into the Hall of Fame in the area where you grew up.</p>
<p>It was. Billy gave a really nice speech. I paraphrased a quote from Bing Crosby or Tony Bennett talking about Frank Sinatra. ‘A great singer like Sinatra only comes along once in a lifetime but why does it have to be my lifetime!’ Billy got a kick out of that.</p>
<p>You have quite an output of material with 35 albums. Are you always writing?</p>
<p>Not too much lately. That is a whole other discussion. I haven’t found the coronavirus or confinement to be too inspiring to write songs. There was a period when I was writing a lot. I tend to record it and then get out and play it. I had a good situation with a studio in France and my collaborator Olivier Durand, who I’ve played with for 25 years. Sometimes it was hard to know when one album was finishing, and another was starting. I’ve always thought that musicians have too much time on their hands. An album a year is a reasonable output.</p>
<p>The line in the movie “his songs knew more about him than he knew about the songs” is very on point. Where did that come from?</p>
<p>It’s the other side of what I like to say, ‘I wish I could be the man who writes my songs.’ Not that I am not that person. But I wish I could have the faith, the insight and the trust I have in the songs. I think your songs know more about you than you do.</p>
<p>Writing songs is a bit of therapy. Bruce and I once had a conversation about what went wrong with Elvis. And Bruce made this point ‘well, he didn’t write his songs.’ He never had to come face to face with himself, like songwriters do. That always struck me.</p>
<p>How important was press and getting record reviews back in the ‘70s?</p>
<p>There was this golden age back then where music journalists were leading the industry. When the music we love so much now started taking off in the ‘60s it took the record labels by surprise. They were just along for the ride and counting the money. It was really the journalists who were showing them the way, an amazing group of writers. Jon Landau, Dave Marsh, Robert Christgau, Robert Hilburn and Paul Nelson. Paul had come from the folk scene and started a magazine called the Little Sandy Review. He went to college with Bob Dylan. Bob stole his Woody Guthrie albums from his dorm room, I think. So we have Paul to thank for Bob! Paul really discovered me and wrote a glowing review of Aquashow in Rolling Stone. That really opened the doors for me on radio and all over.</p>
<p>Rolling Stone changed a lot of the perspective for what you could write. You had Downbeat but that was jazz. The rest of the magazines would ask ‘what’s your favorite color’ or ‘who’s your girlfriend?’ ‘what do you do on a Saturday night?’</p>
<p>I think that was a golden age that does not exist anymore. And once MTV came along, the visual replaced the written word. That changed a lot.</p>
<p>Besides being a ‘new Dylan’ were there other artists you were compared to early on?</p>
<p>There was a lot of Lou Reed. In those early days, they mentioned either Lou Reed, Bob Dylan or F. Scott Fitzgerald. That’s kind of where I fit in! The interesting thing I always say about the ‘new Bob Dylan’ comparisons we all got was that none of us sounded like each other. I didn’t sound like John Prine or Loudon Wainwright or Bruce. I was just honored to be mentioned in the same breath as any of them.

<h3 id="the-lion-sleeps-tonight-the-ongoing-saga-of-pops-most-contentious-song">&ldquo;‘The Lion Sleeps Tonight’: The Ongoing Saga of Pop’s Most Contentious Song&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/lion-sleeps-tonight.jpg" alt="img">
Three years ago, when Disney announced a remake of its animated classic The Lion King, it was easy to be skeptical: With the original still so beloved, was an upgrade even necessary? But at least one family in South Africa was hopeful. In both the first movie and a later stage production, The Lion King features “The Lion Sleeps Tonight,” a Sixties pop hit that has its roots in “Mbube,” a song written and recorded in the Thirties by South African singer and migrant worker Solomon Linda. For decades, Linda barely received any compensation for the incorporation of his song into “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.” That situation ended in 2006. Six years earlier, a Rolling Stone story had tipped the world off to the situation and Linda’s family sued Disney, resulting in an out-of-court settlement. Linda, who died in 1962, would belatedly receive a co-writing credit on “The Lion Sleeps Tonight,” and his family would be handed a lump sum for past royalties and a cut of future revenue.</p>
<p>Cut to early 2019, when the Linda family learned that a new version of “The Lion Sleeps Tonight,” sung by Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner, would be used in the remake of The Lion King. Again, this appeared to be good news: With a cast that already included Beyoncé and Donald Glover, the new Lion King had all the signs of a potential blockbuster. And despite mixed reviews, it has pulled in more than $500 million in the States (and over $1 billion outside the U.S.). The soundtrack album broke into the Top 20 on the Rolling Stone Top 200 album chart.</p>
<p>But once again, it seems as if the Linda family won’t be benefiting from the song. The family’s settlement arrangement with Disney ended on the last day of December 2017, a year and a half before the new movie opened, which means, as it stands now, that Linda’s heirs don’t stand to profit from the inclusion of the song in The Lion King. Nothing in the situation is unlawful: The contract between Disney and the Linda family was finalized, and the family has no legal right to continue receiving royalties. (Disney declined to comment on the record for this story.)</p>
<p>And when the paperwork for that deal was worked out over a decade ago, no one imagined that The Lion King would be remade with computer-generated animals. “Nobody knew in advance into the future,” sighs Hanro Friedrich, a South African lawyer who worked with the family at the time. “I’ve got more than a bit of melancholy in my head now.” (The new movie also includes a remake of “Mbube” by South African singer Lebo M., and according to a lawyer for Folkways, the publisher of “Mbube,” the family will be receiving songwriting royalties from its placement in the film.)</p>
<p>But the idea that the family is again missing out on a windfall for Solomon Linda’s contribution to pop music is the latest in a seemingly endless number of cruel twists in the saga of “The Lion Sleeps Tonight,” one that has reopened old wounds and exposed other financial issues that have emerged since the original deal with Disney. “The family would like to know the implications of [‘The Lion Sleeps Tonight’] featured in The Lion King to the rights of Solomon Linda,” says Themba Dladla, a grandson of Solomon Linda who is currently working with the estate. “They want to know who still holds the international rights and how can we work toward having those rights. They still want to know. I would not say it’s a happy ending.”</p>
<p>As South African journalist Rian Malan laid out in his deeply reported RS exposé “In the Jungle: Inside the Long, Hidden Genealogy of ‘The Lion Sleeps Tonight’” in 2000, the song’s story is as tangled as just about any in pop history. After Linda and his group the Evening Birds released “Mbube” in 1939, a copy of the record — featuring Linda’s beguiling falsetto lilt — wound up with Pete Seeger. Mishearing the lyric and assuming it was a folk song, he changed the title to “Wimoweh,” recorded it with the Weavers in 1952, and mainlined Linda’s melody onto the pop charts. Nine years later, the next phase of the song’s history began when the New York group the Tokens wanted to morph “Wimoweh” into a pop song with fresh lyrics, and songwriters George David Weiss, Hugo Peretti, and Luigi Creatore were commissioned to write new words for what became “The Lion Sleeps Tonight,” a Number One hit in 1961.</p>
<p>Director Sam Cullman’s movie The Lion’s Share — which premiered earlier this year on Netflix as part of the network’s ReMastered series — expertly laid out the song’s journey, the impact of Malan’s work, and the financial issues that continued after the family reached its settlement with Disney. The film revealed the expiration of the deal in 2017. Picking up where Malan’s story left off, The Lion’s Share detailed how the Linda estate, with the help of South African lawyer and copyright expert Owen Dean of the South African law firm Spoor and Fisher, sued Disney for copyright violation in 2004 — and how the story of a poor African family taking on a mega-corporation reverberated around the world.</p>
<p>“Disney couldn’t fight it,” Mark Spier, whose publishing company, Memory Lane, administered Abilene Music (the original publisher of “The Lion Sleeps Tonight”) at the time, tells RS. “There was no way to win a case in South Africa based on the situation that was going on. You have to know when to fight your battles and when not to. This one wasn’t winnable. It just became less of a hassle to give [the estate] 10 or 15 percent than fight it. They had all the press on their side.”</p>
<p>According to a source who has seen the document, Disney agreed to pay a sizable lump sum to the Linda estate, representing past royalties. From then until 2017, the family would also receive a small percentage of all income derived from “The Lion Sleeps Tonight.” (South African copyright law ends 50 years after death; since Linda died in 1962, the Linda estate would have stopped receiving royalties in 2012. Disney and Abilene offered to add an additional five years of royalties, extending the period to 2017.) As Owen Dean tells RS, the terms of the settlement were “far beyond our wildest dreams. It was an amazing, generous settlement offer.” Although the deal deprived the Linda estate of extended royalties in certain countries (in the U.S., the copyright would have continued until 2032, 70 years after Linda’s death), Dean argues, “We were sitting on a South African copyright, and the fact that Disney and Abilene were prepared to pay five years beyond the copyright was a victory, as far as I was concerned.”</p>
<p>As part of the settlement, a trust was set up to administer those funds, but in The Lion’s Share, both sides — the trust on one hand, Linda’s three surviving daughters Delphi, Elizabeth, and Fildah on the other — accused the other of mismanaging the windfall. Both sides confirm that situation to RS. According to a source who worked on the family’s legal team at the time, “some of the substantial initial payments” made to the family amounted to about $120,000. But in The Lion’s Share, the sisters admit to being startled by the legal fees, which, the source says, were in the six figures. Former Spoor and Fisher general manager Glen Dean, no relation to Owen Dean, defends the fees to RS — “Those costs were needed to get to the agreement” — and says the sisters did not listen to the trust’s advice on how to manage the money.</p>
<p>“This narrative is incorrect,” counters Dladla. “My aunts have made very good use of moneys received. This includes extending their family houses and supporting educational needs of their children. All of them are each living in their refurbished individual homes and not at the original place of their birth. None of them are in debt. Having not accepted advice given by former Trustees does not mean they could not use funds received profitably as matured adults.”</p>
<p>According to that same family legal source, the family made roughly between $20,000 and $65,000 per year from “Lion Sleeps Tonight” royalties during the settlement years. (Friedrich says that, pre-settlement, the most the family received from “Mbube” and “Wimoweh” royalties was about $340 in one year.) As Spier tells RS, “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” earned respectable income during the first roughly 15 years of this century. But since the royalties were divided equally between the publisher and the songwriters, that meant the Linda family would receive respectable if not huge amounts of cash (a fraction of the songwriters’ half). “It was one of those really popular songs that didn’t make a boatload of money toward the end,” Spier insists. “It made money from the Broadway show and an occasional [movie or TV] sync.” The song wasn’t included on the 1994 soundtrack, but was covered by artists like ‘NSync and R.E.M.</p>
<p>But in light of Malan’s estimate of how much “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” had earned over decades — upwards of $15 million— the settlement money seemed paltry to the Linda clan. According to Glen Dean, one income source didn’t forward any royalties to the Linda family for at least a year, and Spoor and Fisher hired an American lawyer to help retrieve the money (at least $50,000, according to Glen Dean). But that delay was also one of several instances that added to the family’s suspicions that something was amiss. “We said, ‘We’re struggling — the money has dried up and we want to get the money out of the people in New York,’” says Glen Dean. “There wasn’t sufficient amount in the accounts to pay the sisters their monthly stipend and that caused a lot of anxiety with the sisters.”</p>
<p>By 2013, the trustees, including Glen Dean and Friedrich, had resigned, and Dladla began overseeing the trust. “The family will not work with former Trustees that managed the proceeds of the settlement,” says Dladla, “as they decided to resign from the Solomon Linda Trust for reasons better known to them.” Once again, the situation was a mess.</p>
<p>Precisely how much the family would have earned from the remake of “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” in the new Lion King is unclear. Generally, movie licenses of that sort rarely exceed $75,000, according to an industry lawyer who has negotiated such deals — although it’s possible that a Disney license could have been much higher. Given that the Linda estate would still only receive a fraction of what was owed to the songwriters, their payout for the use of “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” and “Mbube” in the movie could have only amounted to a few thousand dollars. (When the Disney deal ended, the publishing royalties reverted to Abilene Music and Luigi Creatore Music. In another interesting twist, both companies are now run by George David Weiss’ widow Claire, who married Creatore after Weiss’ death in 2010.)</p>
<p>Still, Linda’s heirs still feel stung by the way they claim Disney handled the situation. “The family feels aggrieved by this for two reasons,” says Dladla. “There was no courtesy of informing the family about inclusion of a new version of the song in the movie. And we are not convinced the family is not supposed to derive revenue from the use of a new version of ‘The Lion Sleeps Tonight’ and are currently in the process of procuring legal advice.” (Dladla also says the family has “not been informed” about an impending payment for the use of “Mbube” in The Lion King, even though the song’s publisher, Folkways, says it has negotiated a deal for that usage; when asked about the terms of the deal, Folkways cited a confidentiality agreement).</p>
<p>But other avenues of income may be in sight. Owen Dean, who stopped working for the family once the settlement the Disney was reached, admits in The Lion’s Share that he felt his contributions to the settlement deal were never fully acknowledged by the family. Yet he now says he would be willing to work with them again to help generate additional income from “Mbube” and “Wimoweh.” Dean says he is “in principle willing to act as the family’s attorney if they ask me to do so,” and Dladla says the Linda trust “would still consider” working with Dean on “other outstanding matters.”</p>
<p>The Linda family could also pursue an audit of Abilene (which has since been combined with another publisher, Creatore Music). Abilene moved its business to another handler, the Dutch company Imagem, in 2013, which in turn was bought by Concord Music two years ago. (Citing the confidentiality of the settlement of 2006, Concord declined comment on whether the company is paying royalties for “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” in the new Lion King, despite the settlement having ended nearly three years ago.) “If they audit, what are they fighting for?” says Spier, who could be on the receiving end of some of that audit. “Ten or 15 thousand dollars? That’s going to cost them a lot more. The song is not making millions of dollars, and they’re not missing out on millions of dollars.”</p>
<p>Others are simply holding out hope that the parties involved, like Disney and Abilene, would simply cut the family in on some of the “Lion Sleeps Tonight” income despite the lapsing of the deal. Those advocates include Bobby Weiss, one of George Weiss’ three children — none of whom receive any income from a song their father used to call “a novelty.” “You go back and listen to that recording from the Thirties, and the progression and melody are there,” says Weiss. “What the fuck, man? [Linda] wrote half that song! There’s copyright law and hiding behind all that bullshit, and there’s doing the right thing.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a refrain that has become hauntingly familiar over decades, the Linda family awaits. “There has been nothing transferred yet,” says Dladla. “But, yes, there is some hope.”</p>
