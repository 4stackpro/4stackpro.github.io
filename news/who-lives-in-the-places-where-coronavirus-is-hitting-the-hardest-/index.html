Every day since the COVID-19 pandemic began surging, The New York Times and other sources have reported the size and geographic scope of coronavirus cases. But in addition to these raw numbers, it is useful to know the key demographic attributes of places with the most cases, in comparison to those with lower (but likely increasing) exposure. Based on the Times’ data for counties reported through April 6, the figures below provide a glimpse of how these shifts are taking place on key measures of urban-suburban-rural status, race-ethnicity, and voting in the 2016 presidential election.</p>
<p>U.S. urban cores, racial minorities (especially Black Americans), and those who cast votes for Hillary Clinton in 2016 disproportionately comprise counties where COVID-19 cases are currently clustered—a stark contrast to areas where there is a low level of coronavirus exposure. These characteristics are not necessarily factors that make a place more susceptible to the virus (although high population density in urban cores can speed the spread), but instead they reflect similarities among harder-hit regions.</p>
<p>About one-fifth (21.3%) of Americans reside in counties with the highest COVID-19 prevalence (more than 100 cases per 100,000 population), with a similar number of residents living in counties with a smaller, but still large, prevalence (between 50-100 cases per 100,000 population). Thus, as of Monday, well over half of U.S. residents live in counties with a lower COVID-19 prevalence, though that may be changing.</p>
<p>People living in the urban cores of large metropolitan areas make up more than three-fifths of residents who live in counties with the highest COVID-19 prevalence. Residents of outer suburbs, smaller metropolitan areas, and rural America represent far smaller shares of those living in high-prevalence areas. Persons living in large-prevalence counties are also more likely to be urban core residents. In contrast, more than half of those living in lower-prevalence counties reside outside of urban cores and their close-in suburbs.</p>
<p>The race-ethnic makeup of high-prevalence county residents is also distinct from the rest. While whites comprise 60% of the U.S. population, they make up only 53% of high-prevalence county residents. Much of this difference has to do with the larger presence of Black Americans in high-prevalence counties, comprising fully 18% of their residents—compared with 9.8% in lower-prevalence counties. This is also the case for the child population in these places, of which whites make up less than half for the nation. In the highest-prevalence counties, whites comprise only 44% of the child population.</p>
<p>While white and Black shares of the highest-prevalence county residents differ markedly from those in low-prevalence areas, Latino or Hispanic representation does not differ much across categories. And the smaller Asian American population shows a modest increase in share in the high-prevalence county populations than for the U.S. as a whole.</p>
<p>The strong relationship between the Black population of a county and its COVID-19 prevalence can be seen in Table 2. Counties with large Black population shares display COVID-19 prevalence rates well over 100 per 100,000 population, and much higher death prevalence rates than counties with smaller Black populations. Among residents in counties where Black residents comprised more than nine-tenths of the population, the death prevalence is 8.8 per 100,000 people, in contrast to 3.1 for the nation as a whole.</p>
<p>Many of these counties are rural and small metropolitan counties in the South. Conversely, counties with small Black populations display far lower COVID-19 case and death prevalence</p>
<p>The opposite is true for white populations. Counties that are 95% white display COVID-19 case prevalence rates of just 26 per 100,000 people, and death prevalence rates of 0.9 per 100,000. These rates rise as the county’s white population share declines.</p>
<p>For Latinos or Hispanics, there is not a direct relationship between their population representation and COVID-19 case and death prevalence. The highest rates of both occur in counties where Latinos or Hispanics comprise between 20% and 30% of the population. These include counties in metropolitan New York, Chicago, Boston, and Dallas, among others.</p>
<p>Another distinguishing feature of residents in counties with the highest COVID-19 prevalence is their vote for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in the 2016 election: a 60-35 margin. This stands in contrast with voters in the lowest-prevalence counties, who favored Trump over Clinton by 52-42. Much of this distinction draws from the urban and rural difference between these populations. It remains to be seen whether the political attitudes of these groups change as they assess the current administration’s handling of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Public health experts make plain that the nation can expect a continued expansion of the coronavirus across the country. It will be important to monitor the demographics of this expansion, even as it is apparent that current high-concentration areas are disproportionately urban, and comprised heavily of racial minorities and Democratic voters.

<h3 id="us-now-has-more-coronavirus-deaths-than-any-other-country-but-the-worst-of-epidemic-may-not-be-far-off">US now has more coronavirus deaths than any other country, but the worst of epidemic may not be far off</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/09/USAT/acc68ed2-2762-4733-8ca7-3226f86bd994-GTY_1209563147.JPG?crop=3079,1732,x456,y455&amp;width=3079&amp;height=1732&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" alt="img">
The United States has passed Italy to become the country with the most coronavirus deaths. However, as a proportion of the total population in the U.S., virus deaths remain at about one-sixth of those in hard-hit Italy or Spain.</p>
<p>More than 19,700 people in the U.S. have died due to complications from the coronavirus as of Saturday afternoon, according to data from the Johns Hopkins University dashboard. Friday, the U.S. saw its highest daily death count yet, at 2,108.</p>
<p>Italy&rsquo;s death toll was at 19,468 and Spain, the nation with the third-most fatalities, had 16,353 reported deaths. Worldwide, the death count has surpassed 104,000.</p>

<p>Estimates on how many people will end up dying in the U.S. have fluctuated in recent weeks as new data continues to pour in.</p>
<p>A leading projection model from the University of Washington has forecast about 60,000 deaths in the country, far less than the 100,000 to 240,000 deaths that were projected in a White House release less than two weeks ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The real data are telling us that it is highly likely that we&rsquo;re having a definite positive effect by this mitigation things that we&rsquo;re doing – this physical separation – so I believe we are gonna see a downturn in that,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told NBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Today&rdquo; show on April 9.</p>
<p>“And it looks more like the 60,000 than the 100,000 to 200,000.”</p>
<p>Dr. Deborah Birx of the White House task force said Friday the U.S. is starting to see its curve level off, but she warned that we haven&rsquo;t reached the worst of the epidemic – despite the University of Washington&rsquo;s model projecting Friday as the peak of daily deaths.</p>
<p>Italy&rsquo;s curve flattening</p>
<p>While Italy is far from out of the woods, the country&rsquo;s daily increases in new cases have stabilized. On Thursday, April 9, Italy reported 4,204 new cases and 610 deaths, both figures on par with recent days.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. reported 32,385 new cases and 1,783 on the same day.</p>
<p>Raw totals aren&rsquo;t the best measurement due to the enormous differences in population — Italy has about 60 million people, while the U.S. has upwards of 320 million. But the flattening of Italy&rsquo;s curve after spikes over the past month may provide an effective model for projecting the virus&rsquo; future toll in the U.S.</p>
<p>Italy became the epicenter once the virus expanded outside of China, and hospitals in the country – particularly the northern regions – quickly became overrun. The country instituted a nationwide lockdown on March 9 that has been extended through April 13 and is expected to be extended even further.</p>
<p>Birx said Friday that the U.S., for the first time, is starting to see its curve level, &ldquo;like Italy&rsquo;s did about a week ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Your coronavirus questions, answered:How can I disinfect a face mask? Should I wear gloves?</p>
<p>What did previous US death estimates say?</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, the same University of Washington model projected about 82,000 deaths, a drop from previous iterations. Changes to the model reflect “a massive infusion of new data,” said Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the school’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.</p>
<p>On March 31, the White House released estimates that as many as 240,000 Americans may die in the crisis.</p>
<p>And in mid-March, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&rsquo;s worst-case-scenario had about 160 million to 210 million Americans infected by December and an estimate that between 200,000 and 1.7 million people could die by the end of the year.</p>
<p>When will life return to normal? Expert says US testing is too far behind to know, expects second wave of cases</p>
<p>Speaking to CNN, senior faculty member Dr. Gregory Roth explained that the models are ever-changing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The changes in the model are driven by new data and improved methods, particularly around estimating how uncertain the forecasts may be,&rdquo; Roth said. &ldquo;As we receive more data on COVID-19 deaths, we expect our projections to adjust to follow those new trends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, the more optimistic projections are based on the assumption that Americans will continue to stay vigilant about social distancing.</p>
<p>“It is unequivocally evident that social distancing can, when well implemented and maintained, control the epidemic, leading to declining death rates,” Murray told CNN.</p>
<p>Said Roth: &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t seen a relaxing of social distancing in any parts of the United States yet. In the future, if social distancing was relaxed, we would be concerned that there would be a rise again in the number of cases.&rdquo;

<h3 id="cdc-data-finds-african-americans--13-of-us-population--account-for-33-of-covid-19-hospitalizations">CDC Data Finds African Americans — 13% Of U.S. Population — Account For 33% of COVID-19 Hospitalizations</h3>
<p><img src="https://laistassets.scprdev.org/i/224ee977da87e6c00de8801a0beabcfe/5e8149ddb18a9b000a3f59d6-eight.jpg" alt="img">
The L.A. Convention Center is being converted into a field hospital to be managed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in case of an influx of COVIC-19 patients. (Via L.A. Mayor&rsquo;s Twitter account)</p>

<p>About 1 in 3 people who become sick enough to require hospitalization from COVID-19 were African American, according to hospital data from the first month of the U.S. epidemic released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Even though 33% of those hospitalized patients were black, African Americans constitute 13% of the U.S. population. By contrast, the report found that 45% of hospitalizations were among white people, who make up 76% percent of the population. And 8% of hospitalizations were among Hispanics, who make up 18% of the population.</p>
<p>The study of about 1,500 hospitalized patients in 14 states underscores the long-standing racial disparities in health care in the U.S. It also echoes what&rsquo;s been seen in other coronavirus outbreaks around the world — people with chronic health conditions have a higher likelihood of developing a serious illness after being infected with coronavirus. The findings appear in the MMWR, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.</p>

<p>Overall, the report found that about 90% of people in the hospital with COVID-19 had at least one underlying health condition. Half (50%) had high blood pressure, 48% were obese, 35% had chronic lung disease ,and 28% had diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>Hospitalizations were highest among people 65 and older, and about 54% of those hospitalized were men.</p>
<p>People who were hospitalized had a wide range of symptoms. The most common symptoms at the time of hospital admission were cough (86%), fever or chills (85%), and/or shortness of breath (80%). Upset stomach and gastrointestinal symptoms were documented as well: 27% had diarrhea and 24% reported nausea or vomiting.</p>
<p>Asked about the reports of health disparities and racial divide at a White House coronavirus task force briefing on Tuesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health said that African Americans do not seem more likely to be infected by coronavirus.</p>
<p>But he added that &ldquo;underlying medical conditions, [including] diabetes, hypertension, obesity, [and] asthma,&rdquo; might make it more likely that African Americans are admitted to the ICU or die from the sickness. &ldquo;We really do need to address&rdquo; the health disparities that exist in the U.S., Fauci said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These findings underscore the importance of preventive measures (e.g., social distancing, respiratory hygiene, and wearing face coverings in public settings where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain),&rdquo; the authors of the report write, &ldquo;to protect older adults and persons with underlying medical conditions, as well as the general public.&rdquo;</p>
