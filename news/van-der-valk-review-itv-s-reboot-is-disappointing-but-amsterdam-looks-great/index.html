<p>People think it must be jolly good fun, writing a negative review. And yes, honestly, sometimes it is: oh, the perfectly-crafted putdowns you can throw at a terrible TV show! Oh the clever barbs you can pen! I also have to admit that I love to read a brilliantly-scathing review myself. (Jay Rayner’s occasional damning restaurant write-ups being a particular delight.)</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>But much of the time, when I’m about to slag off an upcoming TV drama, I actually feel pretty guilty. All that time and love and effort that has gone into making this and offering it up to the viewing public! And yet… and yet…</p>
<p>So I take little pleasure in writing to tell you that Van Der Valk is, in this reviewer’s opinion, a massive disappointment. Sorry.</p>
<p>The drama is back with three feature-length episodes on ITV. I say it’s back, because of course Van Der Valk was a classic of 1970s British TV with a catchy theme tune which made it to the top of the charts (but did not make it into this reboot, except for a tiny little bit of the melody).</p>
<p>Based loosely on the novels by Nicolas Freeling, the original series starred the late Barry Foster as Commissaris Simon “Piet” Van Der Valk, a cynical but intuitive detective who solved murders and fought crime in the city of Amsterdam. He returned for a couple of series in the early ’90s – and now Van Der Valk has been revived for 2020, this time with Marc Warren in the lead role.</p>

<p>Warren’s Van Der Valk is an English-accented Dutch detective who sulks around town solving crimes, generally being a maverick and disobeying his exasperated boss, Chief Commissaris Dahlman (Emma Fielding). His partner and second-in-command (Inspector Lucienne Hassell, played by Maimie McCoy) tolerates his antics and supports him, because she knows he is brilliant and possibly troubled. New to the team is Elliot Barnes Worrell as over-keen rookie officer Job Cloovers, who initially annoys Van Der Valk – but wouldn’t you know it, his skills soon prove useful.</p>
<p>Completing the core cast are Luke Allen-Gale as Sergeant Brad De Vries (key traits: unambitious, constantly eating) and Darrell D’Silva as pathologist Hendrik Davis (key traits: talented, constantly hungover).</p>
<p>In the first episode, the team must swing into action when two seemingly-unrelated men are found dead in different parts of Amsterdam on the same day, and another young left-wing activist goes missing. Meanwhile, there’s plenty of drama going on in the political world with left-wing and far-right politicians facing off in an election campaign; and is there also an art world link? Van Der Valk is on the case.</p>
<p>It took me four attempts to finish the first episode, because I just kept getting bored. Everything seemed kind of… clunky? Perhaps it’s the kind of drama that would have benefitted from being a little bit funnier and a little bit more wry, which is what saved ITV’s recent detective drama McDonald &amp; Dodds from its own tortured plots (thanks, Jason Watkins). Perhaps the actual murder mystery itself could have been more of a fun puzzle, which is part of what fans love about Midsomer Murders?</p>
<p>Or perhaps it was the characters, none of whom are particularly engaging (except for Emma Fielding as the boss, who has potential; she also has an excellent dog). After the first episode, I just find Commissaris Piet Van Der Valk kind of irritating and charmless. He also seems like he’d be a really, really annoying person to work with.</p>
<p>On the plus side, there are the locations! Visually, Van Der Valk is a treat. The drama takes us through the canals of central Amsterdam and into the famous canal houses, but it also takes us to some lesser-known corners of the city. And then there’s the crown jewel of episode one: a visit to the actual Rijksmuseum. Despite the murders and despite the dodgy drama, this is a TV show which should make you want to book a holiday to the Dutch capital… just as soon as the pandemic has passed.</p>

<p>Van Der Valk begins on Sunday 26th April at 8pm on ITV. Check out what else is on with our TV Guide.

<h3 id="meet-the-cast-of-itvs-van-der-valk">Meet the cast of ITV’s Van Der Valk</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2020/04/Van-Der-Valk-cast-a526f04.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=620,413" alt="img">
In ITV’s new reboot of Amsterdam-based detective drama Van Der Valk, Marc Warren takes over the classic role from the late Barry Foster. He’s joined by a line-up of British and Dutch actors, with a core cast of cops as well as brand-new guest stars for each episode.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Here are the cast and characters you’ll meet as Commissaris Van der Valk investigates a string of high-profile cases in the Dutch capital:</p>
<p>Marc Warren plays Piet Van der Valk</p>
<p>Who is Piet Van der Valk? A Commissaris in the Dutch police, who has earned the respect of his team. He loves Amsterdam, lives on a boat, and is described as “comfortable in his own skin, street smart, instinctive and unapologetic.” Marc Warren says: “Van Der Valk is an everyman sort of character. He reflects the energies of Amsterdam: its tolerance and liberalism. He can be a loner, and at times he might seem a little taciturn or moody but he has some stuff going on that we find out about as the show goes on. There’s definitely a sadness there and by the end of the series we find out why.”</p>
<p>What else has Marc Warren been in? The actor is perhaps best-known for playing Danny Blue in Hustle, Albert Blithe in Band of Brothers, or Nick Saverese in The Good Wife. He recently starred as the dastardly Samuel Parker in Beecham House, and he was Pete Mayfield in the Netflix drama Safe. Other credits include Doctor Who (as Elton Pope), State of Play, The Vice, Flack, The Musketeers, Mad Dogs, and Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell.</p>
<p>Maimie McCoy plays Lucienne Hassell</p>
<p>Who is Lucienne Hassell? Inspector Hassell works alongside Van der Valk. She is his trusted confidante, and is described as “calm amid a storm, centred, down to earth”.</p>
<p>What else has Maimie McCoy been in? The actress previously starred in The Musketeers as Milady de Winter, alongside her Van Der Valk co-star Marc Warren. You may have seen her recently as Nancy Raynott in White House Farm, or as DC Tracy Joyce in A Confession – and she played Grace Harper in the BBC daytime drama London Kills. In 2016 she also had a role in DCI Banks, playing Tamsin Richards.</p>

<p>Elliot Barnes Worrell plays Job Cloovers</p>
<p>Who is Job Cloovers? Junior police officer Cloovers is “fresh-faced, keen and eager to impress”. He is a diligent and talented investigator with a fondness for stats.</p>
<p>What else has Elliot Barnes Worrell been in? As a relative newcomer to our screens, the actor has appeared in Dolittle (playing Captain William Derrick), The Strangers, and Ready Player One. He also played the character Easter in Jericho, but Elliot Barnes Worrell is perhaps best-known for his stage work.</p>
<p>Luke Allen-Gale plays Brad De Vries</p>
<p>Who is Brad De Vries? A member of Van der Valk’s team. He is described as “no Einstein, a good-looking mid-ranking Sergeant, more interested in women than promotion”.</p>
<p>What else has Luke Allen-Gale been in? His biggest roles so far have included William Whele in the TV series Dominion, Daniel Springer in Monroe, and Fredirigo in The Borgias. Luke Allen-Gale is also a voice actor, including for the Final Fantasy video games.</p>
<p>Darrell D’Silva plays Hendrik Davis</p>
<p>Who is Hendrik Davis? The pathologist. He’s “foul-mouthed, hard living, hard-drinking but effective”.</p>
<p>What else has Darrell D’Silva been in? The actor, who is a veteran of the Royal Shakespeare Company, has appeared on-screen in a number of TV shows – including Informer, Strike Back, and Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>Emma Fielding plays Julia Dahlman</p>
<p>Who is Julia Dahlman? The Chief Commissaris, i.e. Van der Valk’s boss. Four years ago she sustained injuries which continue to hamper her physically. Dahlman is “a velvet fist in an iron glove, a politician and sincere supporter of the team”.</p>
<p>What else has Emma Fielding been in? Aside from being Oliver-nominated for her theatre work, Emma Fielding has appeared in a ton of TV shows.
