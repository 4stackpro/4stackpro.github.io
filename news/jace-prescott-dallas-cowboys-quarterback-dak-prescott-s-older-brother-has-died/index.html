<p><img src="https://www.wlox.com/pb/resources/images/fallback-promo-image.png" alt="img">
KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs wrapped up the first round of the NFL draft when the Super Bowl champions picked LSU running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire with the 32nd overall selection. The Chiefs were long rumored to have interest in trading down since they have just five selections during the three-day draft. The Chiefs wound up having their pick of running backs after none had been taken in the first round. Edwards-Helaire was picked because of the way his game fits the Chiefs&rsquo; scheme, particularly his ability to catch the ball out of the backfield.

<h3 id="dallas-cowboys-draft-pick-ceedee-lamb-sends-note-to-dak-prescott">Dallas Cowboys draft pick CeeDee Lamb sends note to Dak Prescott</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3media.247sports.com/Uploads/Assets/576/741/9741576.png?fit=bounds&amp;crop=1200:630,offset-y0.50&amp;width=1200&amp;height=630" alt="img">
Shopping for another offensive weapon ahead of the 2020 season, the Dallas Cowboys and first-year coach Mike McCarthy landed a play-making gem on Thursday night in the first round of the NFL Draft, taking Oklahoma&rsquo;s CeeDee Lamb at No. 17 overall. In a class loaded with elite-level wideouts, the Cowboys seized their opportunity at landing one of the Big 3 after Alabama&rsquo;s Henry Ruggs and Jerry Jeudy had already come off the board.</p>
<p>Paired with Amari Cooper and Ezekiel Elliott, Lamb gives franchise quarterback Dak Prescott a third talented option next season. Lamb was asked after his selection what he thought about playing with one of the NFL&rsquo;s top signal callers.</p>
<p>“He’s definitely going to get an ultimate competitor,” Lamb told ESPN after he got the call from Jerry Jones. “A guy that’s willing to learn and can’t wait to get used to helping him look like a better quarterback and he’s helping me look like a better receiver.”</p>
<p>A physically-gifted wideout, amb is coming off a noteworthy junior season featuring 62 receptions for 1,327 yards and 14 touchdowns on his way to All-American honors. He finished his Oklahoma career with 173 receptions for 3,292 yards and 32 touchdowns, individual marks that rank third, second and sixth in program history, respectively.</p>
<p>Dallas franchise-tagged Prescott last month, an effort to make sure he is the Cowboys&rsquo; quarterback this fall while the two sides work out a long-term extension. Prescott has reportedly not yet signed the franchise tender.</p>
<p>According to NFL.com insider Ian Rapoport, Prescott’s franchise tag number was recalculated and has now reached $31.4 million for the 2020 season. That’s an increase from $26.824 million, where it was when he was initially tagged on March 16. According to Rapoport, the tag price is based on the 2020 restricted free agent numbers and finalized after the restricted free agent period ends.</p>
<p>Prescott&rsquo;s brother, Jace, died on Thursday unexpectedly. The 31-year-old was reportedly at home with his girlfriend, but no other information has been made available. The Cowboys confirmed the death and released a statement on Thursday night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is with great sadness and support that we share the news of the passing of Jace Prescott today,&rdquo; the statement read. &ldquo;The loss of Tad and Dak&rsquo;s brother is devastating. At this incredibly difficult time, the Prescott family asks only for prayers and respect for their privacy. &quot;
