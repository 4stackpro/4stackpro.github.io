As the black market trade of its N95 respirator masks has continued to swell, pressure is mounting on 3M, which manufactures the masks and other protective gear, to crack down on price gouging among its distributors. Tuesday, amid widespread reports that vendors of medical supplies are wildly overcharging for the desperately needed protective devices, the Minnesota-based company insisted that it is committed to combating the inflation of prices for its products used during the coronavirus pandemic. In a statement about both price gouging and the sale of counterfeit masks, which also appears to be a problem, 3M promised that it “will aggressively pursue third-parties that seek to take advantage of this crisis. We are working with law enforcement authorities around the world — including, in the U.S., the U.S. Attorney General, state Attorneys General, and local authorities.” But some civic groups are asking the company to do more. The Metro Industrial Areas Foundation, or Metro IAF, a Queens-based nonprofit, responded to 3M’s statement yesterday with a letter to the company’s CEO, Mike Roman, insisting that Roman make it clear to the company’s distributors that if they take advantage of the desperate need for protective gear they won’t be able to sell 3M’s products in the future.</p>
<p>The group is also demanding that, within 72 hours, 3M put together a database of its worldwide inventory of N95 masks, with product information, quantities, pricing, payment terms, location, and contact information — and make it available to health care providers. “We believe that putting the burden on healthcare buyers and law enforcement to fix the problem of price gouging is unrealistic and sidesteps 3M’s duty of responsible care for its products,” Rev. Patrick O’Connor of the First Presbyterian Church of Jamaica, Queens, wrote on behalf of the organization. Metro IAF, an affiliate of a 75-year-old organizing network, isn’t usually involved in procuring emergency medical gear. The group has a history of working on issues such as jobs, criminal justice, education, and housing. But its focus has changed in recent weeks as clergy in some of the churches that belong to the network began to get desperate reports from their members on the front lines. “We were all hearing the same story over and over again: We don’t have the equipment we need, we don’t have masks, we don’t have what we need to protect ourselves,” said Rev. David K. Brawley of the St. Paul Community Baptist Church in East Brooklyn. Many of Brawley’s congregants are front-line health care workers — “the folks who work in services within the hospitals, and not just doctors, also the folks who people tend to forget about,” he said. “These are people I deeply care about and love.” So organizers from the group, whose member organizations include religious congregations, unions, schools, community health centers, and other civic institutions, began to investigate whether they might be able to arrange a purchase of some of the supplies themselves — and quickly found themselves in what has become the “Wild West” global market of medical supplies. Among the suppliers they identified was a Canadian distributor who claimed last week to have millions of N95 masks, but demanded a minimum purchase of 20 million. Within hours of the distributor’s demand, the group had assembled a consortium of 19 different entities in need of the masks, including two major hospital chains, one city health department in Colorado, six county governments in three states, and one governor’s office. Though several of the buyers were also hoping to purchase gowns, gloves, ventilators, and other supplies, they were pooling resources to be able to put in the minimum order of 3M’s 1860 N95 mask, which protects health care workers against airborne particles and is “resistant to splash and spatter of blood and other infectious materials.” Although the 1860 N95 masks should cost $1.27 each, according to a price list 3M issued yesterday, the Canadian dealer was charging more than $7 per mask. But the jacked-up price isn’t what killed the deal. Even the major hospital chains were desperate enough to spend the money. Instead, the group’s purchase began to fall apart when the dealer said that the Canadian military had seized 10 million of the masks and then insisted that the group not only commit to buying the remaining 20 million masks but also to five additional monthly purchases of 20 million masks, totaling $140 million. While it is still exploring how to help purchase managers find supplies, Metro IAF has pivoted since that and other deals fell through. “After a few of these experiences, our team regrouped and realized that 3M and other larger players needed to help clean up this mess,” said Joe Morris, an organizer with the group. “They maintain that they don’t have control,” Morris said of 3M. “We maintain they need to get control. Their duty doesn’t end after manufacture.”

<h3 id="us-industrial-giant-3m-scrambles-to-meet-demand-for-face-masks-as-coronavirus-spreads">US industrial giant 3M scrambles to meet demand for face masks as coronavirus spreads</h3>
<p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106367653-1580503887264gettyimages-1197628026.jpeg?v=1580503965" alt="img">
The maker of Post-It notes and Scotch Tape is also the maker of perhaps one of the most desperately needed medical supplies in the world right now.</p>
<p>A face mask.</p>
<p>The $32 billion Minnesota conglomerate 3M is one of the world&rsquo;s largest manufacturers of N95 filtering face masks, which have been in high demand in the U.S. and around the world since the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>N95 respirators are so named because they are capable of filtering out 95% of large and small particles, including certain types of bacteria.</p>
<p>They are considered essential equipment in occupations ranging from construction to medicine.</p>
<p>And in early 2020 health officials worried there were not nearly enough of them. In early March, officials from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the country had only about 35 million of the 3.5 billion N95 respirators needed in the event of a full-blown pandemic.</p>
<p>3M doubled global production to 1.1 billion per year from about 400 million per year, and the company said in late March it plans to double production again to 2 billion within 12 months.</p>
<p>The explosion of face mask demand could provide a small boost for 3M, which reported sales of about $32 billion in 2019. The company does not break down the actual size of its face mask business, but some Wall Street analysts estimate 3M sold anywhere from $100 million to $325 million in face masks prior to the outbreak of the disease. The outbreak could add another $300 million in sales, said one analyst.</p>
<p>This would be only a tiny portion of 3M&rsquo;s overall business, but the importance of the product still has focused a tremendous amount of attention on the company.</p>
<p>Shares of 3M, which are valued at about $78 billion, have fallen more than 22% since the start of the year.

<h3 id="why-are-n95-face-masks-so-expensive-and-hard-to-find-mark-cuban-blames-3m">Why Are N95 Face Masks So Expensive and Hard to Find? Mark Cuban Blames 3M</h3>
<p><img src="https://observer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/03/GettyImages-1210628230.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip" alt="img">
Since the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has insistently advised against wearing a face mask if you are healthy. But with COVID-19 transmitting among sick patients and asymptotic carriers alike, how do you know? As infected cases keep rising and show no sign of slowing down, demand for N95 respirators, the gold standard for pandemic protection, is bound to skyrocket in the coming days.</p>
<p>However, 3M Co., one of the best-known brands making these face masks, is doing a poor job of ensuring that enough N95 respirators will be available at a reasonable price, according to billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban, who has been working with a nonprofit to source N95 masks and other medical supplies for health care workers.</p>

<p>In an interview with Bloomberg on Saturday, Cuban called out 3M’s distribution model that he said could allow price gouging at the retail level and hamper hospitals’ access to the protective gear.</p>
<p>“3M lists all its distributors online, the ones buying and selling these things, and these distributors are making as much money as they possibly can. It’s wrong, it’s criminal,” Cuban said in the interview. “It’s operating like an illegal drug market, not a legitimate market. I get wanting to make millions of dollars, but people are dying.”</p>
<p>Cuban said he realized the problem of N95 distribution after receiving an influx of emails from third-party sellers trying to sell him these masks at inflated prices.</p>
<p>“I have emails saying, ‘I have a 100,000 masks per sale at $8 per piece.’ I would ask if these were 3M masks, N95s, and if they could prove it. I literally have been offered billions of masks at premium prices from $4 to $8, million-dollar minimum orders, who knows what’s real,” he said. For comparison, just six weeks ago, a N95 respirator could be bought at pharmacies for $1.25.</p>
<p>3M hasn’t directly responded to Cuban’s criticism. On March 20, CEO Mike Roman announced that the company would double global production of N95 masks to about 100 million a month through the end of 2020.</p>
<p>“It would have been very easy for them to say very strongly, ‘If you don’t sell if you don’t take the inventory we’re providing you and sell directly to hospitals and healthcare providers that need the masks, when your contract comes up, we’re going to end that contract,'” Cuban told Fox News. on the same day of 3M’s announcement. “But that’s not what they did. And I have a huge problem with that. ”</p>
<p>“I’m excited that 3M has increased capacity. But supply hasn’t been matched with demand,” he told Bloomberg in the latest interview. “Why is 3M not telling distributors, pick up the phone, sell your inventory to the hospitals, or will never let you buy more product?”</p>
<p>In a letter to Attorney General William Barr, who condemned 3M for profiting from the pandemic, last week, Roman said 3M has not increased prices due to the coronavirus. “3M will not increase its current pricing for respirators being used to help address the pandemic,” he promised.</p>
<p>Per Bloomberg, Cuban has been in touch with “higher ups” at the White House about price gouging among face mask distributors but hasn’t started on any specific effort with the Trump administration.
