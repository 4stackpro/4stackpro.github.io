<h3 id="seanad-fills-first-agricultural-panel-seat-but-no-first-count-result-for-nui-panel-today">Seanad fills first Agricultural Panel seat but no first count result for NUI panel today</h3>

Outgoing Independent Senator Victor Boyhan was the first to be elected to the highly competitive Agricultural Panel, which has 11 seats to be filled.</p>
<p>Mr Boyhan was elected on the sixth count having exceeded the quota of 94,167.</p>
<p>Former Sinn Féin MEP Lynn Boylan was set to be elected to the Seanad along with Cathaoirleach Denis O’Donovan in the ongoing count for the agricultural panel.</p>
<p>Green Party Senator Pippa Hackett was in fourth place and in contention to hold onto the seat she won in a by-election.</p>
<p>Eleven Senators will be elected out of 26 candidates from an electorate of just under 1,200 TDs, Senators and city and county councillors.</p>
<p>Breaking: Count 6 for the Agricultural Panel. Victor Boyhan surpassed the quota and is deemed to be elected&hellip; just 10 seats to go #iestaff pic.twitter.com/TNsJ0fWHKs — McConnellDaniel (@McConnellDaniel) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the NUI Seanad race, it appears from early tallies that the three outgoing senators – Michael McDowell, Ronan Mullen and Alice Mary Higgins – all are well placed to be returned.</p>
<p>However, due to social distancing requirements, the count was delayed leading to the returning officer announcing that it would be not until tomorrow before a first count could be declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems unlikely that we will have a first count result till tomorrow, this is due to the social distancing protocols and fewer staff than normal,” Dr Attracta Halpin, the NUI returning officer said.</p>
<p>Three former TDs are among the first five people to be elected to the Seanad.</p>

<p>Former government chief whip and Fine Gael TD Sean Kyne was the first person to be elected today on the upper chamber&rsquo;s Cultural and Educational panel.</p>
<p>Former Fianna Fáil TDs Lisa Chambers and Malcolm Byrne who also lost their seats in February&rsquo;s general election were elected.</p>
<p>Former Sinn Féin senator Fintan Warfield and Fine Gael county councillor John McGahon were also elected.</p>
<p>Mr Kyne was the first person elected to the new Seanad having passed the quota on the 14th count on the Cultural and Educational Panel.</p>
<p>Benefitting from significant from transfers from party colleagues eliminated, Mr Kyne lost his Dáil seat in the February General Election but is seen as close to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.</p>
<p>Green Party hopeful Saoirse McHugh had secured a strong first preference vote and was well placed up until the end, but she ultimately struggled to remain transfer friendly and was pipped by Mr McGahon.</p>
<p>This election has seen some high-profile losses with former Fianna Fáil TD Declan Breathnach eliminated on the ninth count. Mr Breathnach said that in estimating the support of voters “you should count the number of votes you’re promised and divide by two”.</p>
<p>Fine Gael’s Tom Neville, lost his Limerick Dáil seat in the general election also lost out on seat when counting stopped shortly before midnight on Monday.</p>
<p>Along with Mr Neville failing to secure a seat, his outgoing Senate colleague Westmeath senator Gabrielle McFadden lost her seat and was eliminated on the 10th count.

<h3 id="seanad-elections-traveller-candidate-narrowly-loses-out-on-election">Seanad elections: Traveller candidate narrowly loses out on election</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.irishtimes.com/image-creator/?id=1.4217791&amp;origw=1440" alt="img">
All six university Senators have been re-elected to the Seanad following the final count in the Trinity College constituency.</p>
<p>Lynn Ruane was elected on the eighth count with 4,072 votes winning out over fourth-placed former Ireland rugby international Hugo MacNeill, who had 2,961 votes.</p>
<p>On the vocational panels, Eileen Flynn, who is a Traveller, narrowly lost out. In a tight four-way contest on the Labour panel, she missed out and the seats were taken by Sinn Féin Senator Paul Gavan, Green Party councillor Pauline O’Reilly and Labour councillor Marie Sherlock. Ms Flynn would have been the first Traveller woman in the Oireachtas.</p>
<p>Counting concluded shortly before 11pm on Wednesday night and resumes at 9am on Thursday.</p>
<p>After the final count in the Labour panel Fianna Fáil has 10 seats, Fine Gael eight and Sinn Féin three.</p>
<p>Labour, the Green Party and Independents have two seats each.</p>
<p>A total of 27 seats have now been filled on the vocational panels with 16 seats to be decided on the two remaining panels – Industrial and Commercial, and Administrative.</p>
<p>Earlier, Senators David Norris and Ivana Bacik retained their seats in the Trinity constituency.</p>
<p>The pair joined Senator Rónán Mullen and Michael McDowell, who were re-elected for the National University of Ireland (NUI) constituency.</p>
<p>Mr Mullen topped the poll and was elected on the first count, the first time a Senator has been elected on the first count since 1989.</p>
<p>Then third-placed NUI candidate Senator Alice-Mary Higgins was re-elected late on Wednesday night with transfers from former USI president Laura Harmon to end up with 9,778 votes compared with 6,219 votes for former Solidarity TD Ruth Coppinger.</p>
<p>Mr Norris topped the poll in the Trinity constituency and was re-elected on the fifth count. His surplus secured the re-election of Ms Bacik. Ms Ruane was elected in third place.</p>
<p>Mr McDowell was elected on the ninth count, after a first count showing just 600 votes off the 9,530 quota.</p>
<p>Mr Mullen, a long-time anti-abortion campaigner, was re-elected to the NUI panel with 9,642 votes.</p>
<p>Four Fianna Fáil Senators were elected to the vocational panels including former TDs Shane Cassells and Pat Casey, while Senators Ned O’Sullivan and Robbie Gallagher held their seats.</p>
<p>Earlier, outgoing Sinn Féin Senator Maire Devine was eliminated.</p>
<p>Six former TDs will return to the Oireachtas led by Ministers of State Michael D’Arcy and Seán Kyne. Also elected were former Fianna Fáil TDs Eugene Murphy, Niall Blaney, Lisa Chambers and Malcolm Byrne. Sinn Féin’s former Dublin MEP Lynn Boylan also secured a seat.</p>
<p>Green Party Senator Pippa Hackett retained her seat and Labour had their first victory for Cllr Annie Hoey. Fine Gael Seanad leader Jerry Buttimer topped the poll and was re-elected to the Labour panel followed by the party’s Waterford councillor John Cummins.</p>
<p>Vocational panels</p>
<p>Outgoing Senators, TDs and local and city county councillors make up the 1,691 voters who get to elect the new Upper House and have a vote on each of the five vocational panels –Agriculture (which has 11 seats), Culture and Education (5), Labour (11), Industrial and Commercial (9) and the Administrative panel (7).</p>
<p>The university panels elect three Senators each on the National University of Ireland and Trinity College panels.</p>
<p>The coronavirus “cocooning” rules resulted in registrar Dr Attracta Halpin taking over as returning officer for NUI Chancellor Maurice Manning who was forced to stay at home because he is over 70.</p>
<p>Some 38,000 NUI graduates returned ballots, a higher turnout than in 2016 but the number of graduates rose by 12,000 to 112,206.</p>
<p>The Trinity turnout was an estimated 16,000 from a total electorate of 64,585.
