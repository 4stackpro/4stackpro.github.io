There are many weapons in VALORANT, the tactical first-person shooter made by Riot Games. In order to become a master of the game, it&rsquo;s pivotal that you learn to master the weapons in it. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve made a series of weapon guides for VALORANT weapons discussing the weapon cost, the weapon damage, and controlling the weapon&rsquo;s recoil. In this guide, we&rsquo;ll be talking about the Ghost pistol.</p>
<p>Cost</p>
<p>The Ghost is on the expensive side of the sidearm spectrum, costing a total of 500 credits. This means that, at the start of each half in VALORANT, you cannot pair a Ghost purchase with a Light Shield too. Instead, it only leaves room for ability purchases. It&rsquo;s a significant tradeoff to make, and one that cheaper guns such as the Frenzy or the Classic don&rsquo;t force you to make. A massive upside is that the Ghost is the only pistol in VALORANT with a silencer, meaning it&rsquo;s easier to land multiple shots on enemies while they&rsquo;re trying to find out where the shots are coming from.</p>
<p>Damage</p>
<p>The Ghost does a lot of damage for a handgun and is especially rewarding for precise aim. Hitting the target&rsquo;s body or leg with the Ghost deals slightly more damage than shots with the Classic or the Frenzy would. However, headshots deal vastly more damage. Up to thirty meters, landing a headshot with the Ghost instantly kills an opponent not wearing a shield.</p>
<p>The Ghost&rsquo;s headshot damage does drop off significantly after thirty meters. However, the Ghost remains incredibly powerful, dealing more damage at any range than all other sidearms except for the Sheriff. In the table below, you can see the exact numbers for the Ghost&rsquo;s damage in VALORANT:</p>
<p>Target: 0-30 meter range 30-50 meter range Body 30 damage 25 damage Head 105 damage 88 damage Leg 26 damage 21 damage</p>
<p>With fifteen bullets in its magazine, firing at a 6.75 rounds per second rate, the Ghost is capable of dealing a lot of damage in a short amount of time. Even if you&rsquo;re just landing body shots, it&rsquo;ll take anywhere from four to six bullets to take down the enemy.</p>
<p>Recoil</p>
<p>The Ghost is a very precise weapon, especially for a sidearm. Its rapid fire rate has very low impact on its accuracy when compared to other pistols such as the Frenzy and the Sheriff. Up to twenty meters, you can relatively safely blast away with the Ghost and reliably hit your target. And even at thirty meters, the first few bullets will still be very accurate.</p>
<p>The Ghost&rsquo;s recoil pattern at various distances.</p>
<p>The Ghost isn&rsquo;t a weapon you actively think about recoil control with. In VALORANT, there simply aren&rsquo;t many locations with distances so long that the Ghost&rsquo;s recoil becomes an active problem. In the few cases where you are staring down an opponent from across thirty meters or more, the best strategy to apply is double-tapping: the Ghost&rsquo;s first two bullets are incredibly accurate even at a fifty-meter range.</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that many seasoned first-person shooter players are in love with the Ghost. Its combination of damage, accuracy, and the silencer make it a reliable, powerful sidearm. It&rsquo;s a great weapon for rounds where you&rsquo;re low on money to spend, but still want to deal a hefty amount of damage. If you&rsquo;re confident in your aim, or like to sneak up on your enemies, the Ghost is your go-to weapon.

<h3 id="the-rolling-stones-land-number-one-song-on-itunes-with-living-in-a-ghost-town">The Rolling Stones Land Number One Song On iTunes With ‘Living In A Ghost Town’</h3>
<p><img src="https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/rs-no-filter-photo-credit-dave-hogan.jpg?w=1024" alt="img">
More than 40 years since their last number one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles Chart, The Rolling Stones have landed at number one on iTunes.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the band dropped “Living in a Ghost Town,” a surprise new song and accompanying video. Mick Jagger said he thought the tune “would resonate through the times that we’re living in right now.” He was right.</p>
<p>One day later, “Living in a Ghost Town” sits atop iTunes’ song chart, well above recent efforts by Travis Scott, The Weeknd, Drake, Megan Thee Stallion and Justin Bieber.</p>
<p>Credit the Stones’ longevity and also a hunger for new music from the band, which has not released a new composition since “Doom and Gloom” and “One More Shot” in 2012.</p>
<p>While very relevant to our quarantine-ravaged times, “Living in a Ghost Town” was actually written a year ago.</p>
<p>“We cut this track well over a year ago in L.A. for part of a new album, an ongoing thing,” said Keith Richards. “And then sh*t hit the fan [and] Mick and I decided this one really needed to go to work right now and so here you have it.”</p>
<p>Watch the video below.

<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/23/20/27568866-0-image-a-17_1587668774689.jpg" alt="img">
The Duchess of Cambridge put on a stylish display in an £129 floral blue dress by Ghost as she joined Prince William, 37, Prince George, six, Princess Charlotte, four, and Prince Louis, two, to clap for the NHS tonight.</p>
<p>In a new family picture released to the Kensington Palace Instagram account at 8pm on Thursday night to mark the weekly #clapfortheNHS, Kate, 38, opted for the Anouk Dress, which features fabric-covered buttons all the way down and romantic ruffles along the collar and hem, and is currently on sale for £90.30 and in stock.</p>
<p>Wearing her hair perfectly blow-dried and accessorising with drop earrings, she matched Prince William, who coordinated in a blue sweater and shirt as they stood in front of Amner Hall, their Norfolk country home.</p>
<p>Taking after her mother, little Charlotte was also seen wearing a pale blue paisle cotton dress, while Louis wore navy shorts, a collared shirt and dark blue jumper.</p>
<p>The Duchess of Cambridge put on a stylish display in an £129 floral blue dress by Ghost as she joined Prince William, 37, Prince George, six, Princess Charlotte, four, and Prince Louis, two, to clap for the NHS tonight</p>
<p>George, mirroring his father in blue slacks, wore a check shirt much like the one Louis wore in his birthday pictures.</p>
<p>Blue is said to have calming effect, and reprsents trust, loyalty, wisdom, confidence, intelligence, faith and truth.</p>
<p>Earlier today Kensington Palace released picture of Prince Louis to mark his second birthday.</p>
<p>The Duchess of Cambridge opted to dress Prince Louis in a £12 Tu check bodysuit from Sainsbury&rsquo;s to take the adorable pictures released for the royal&rsquo;s 2nd birthday today.</p>
<p>Prince Louis can be seen beaming having smeared rainbow colours across his cheeks in an adorable unseen picture taken by Kate Middleton, 38, to mark her youngest child&rsquo;s special day.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Cambridge opted to dress Prince Louis in a £12 Tu check bodysuit from Sainsbury&rsquo;s to take the adorable pictures released for the royal&rsquo;s 2nd birthday today</p>
<p>The snap, which was released on Kate Middleton, 38, and Prince William&rsquo;s, 37, official Kensington Royal Twitter page today, shows the adorable Prince grinning having covered his face in paint.</p>
<p>And the little boy appears to be taking after his father, wearing the same checked navy shirt the Duke of Cambridge wore during a tour of Australia almost exactly six years ago to the day, in 2014.</p>
<p>Posting the cute image alongside one of the Prince showing off his rainbow painted hands, Kensington Palace captioned the post: &lsquo;Sharing a sneak peek of Prince Louis’ handiwork ahead of his second birthday!</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are pleased to share new images of Prince Louis, taken by The Duchess this April.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They then shared more of the little boy, writing: &lsquo;Instagram vs Reality. Thank you for all your lovely messages on Prince Louis’ second birthday!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The 100 per cent cotton shirt style bodysuit comes with a pair of black dungarees, and is still available in all sizes from newborn to 24 months.</p>
<p>fans quickly remarked on how much the little boy was taking after his father, wearing the same checked navy shirt the Duke of Cambridge wore during a tour of Australia almost exactly six years ago to the day, in 2014 (seen with George, far right)</p>
<p>The pictures of Prince Louis were taken at Anmer Hall, their Norfolk home, this month by his doting mother Kate.</p>
<p>In the snaps, the young royal can be seen dressed in a smart, blue checked shirt, and has the same heart-shaped faces, rosy cheeks and enchanting gap-toothed smiles as his brother, Prince George, six.</p>
<p>The image was shared after an initial series of charming photos showing the well behaved royal enjoying an arts-and-crafts session as he painted rainbows to celebrate the NHS.</p>
<p>The young prince raised his rainbow coloured hands to his face, that were carefully painted on him by his mother Kate</p>
<p>Prince Louis looked absolutely thrilled with his rainbow coloured handprint to stick on the front window of the family home in Norfolk</p>
<p>The playful Prince! As Louis celebrates his 2nd birthday today, his parents released this adorable snap of the youngster smearing rainbow paint across his cheeks in an outtake from his birthday photoshoot with mother Kate Middleton, 38</p>
<p>Pictures of rainbows started springing up up in windows across the country after schools closed in response to the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>They originated in Italy and quickly spread to the UK, where they are seen as a message of hope and something fun for children spot on their daily hour of exercise. Kate even carefully painted a rainbow on his hands to make a perfect print.</p>
<p>Their three children are also encouraged to take part in the &lsquo;clap for carers&rsquo; every week, which will take place again tonight at 8pm.</p>
<p>Adorable: With his little hands smudged with paint and a broad grin on his face, Prince Louis is clearly pleased with his artistic creation
