NATO Foreign Ministers directed NATO’s top commander, General Wolters, to coordinate the necessary military support to combat the coronavirus crisis and to start using fast-track paths through Europe’s airspace for military flights carrying medical supplies, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday (2 April 2020).</p>
<p>“NATO was created to deal with crises. So we can help and our Alliance is playing its part”, the Secretary General said. Mr Stoltenberg’s remarks came after a meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers, held by secure videoconference for the first time in NATO’s history. The Secretary General also announced that he would convene an extraordinary meeting of defence ministers in April to review the support provided to Allies and take decisions on any further steps.</p>
<p>The Alliance is already coordinating and supporting national efforts against the pandemic with logistical, transport and medical help. “I am grateful for the further offers of assistance, which NATO Allies made today and for the substantial support that Allies have already provided”, the Secretary General said, citing the airlift of medical supplies, provision of medical personnel and the use of innovative technologies. Mr Stoltenberg stressed that NATO&rsquo;s main task remained the protection of NATO’s almost one billion people, and that NATO’s ability to conduct operations had not been undermined.</p>
<p>Today’s meeting also focused on NATO missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, and support for Georgia and Ukraine. On Iraq, the Secretary General said that NATO would take on some additional activities including the training and the education of non-commissioned officers, engineers, and federal police. On Afghanistan, the Secretary General welcomed efforts to set up an inclusive team for the inter-Afghan negotiations, calling on the Taliban and all political actors to play their part.</p>
<p>North Macedonia, which on Friday (27 March 2020) became the alliance’s 30th member, attended a NATO Ministerial meeting for the first time as an Ally.

<h3 id="nato-launches-call-for-interns-for-2021">NATO launches call for interns for 2021</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pictures/images_mfu/2020/4/stock/200204-internships.jpg" alt="img">
As an international organisation, NATO is characterised by diversity. People from different backgrounds and cultures, work styles and ways of thinking work here. This is reflected in the Alliance’s internship programme, which offers opportunities in a variety of fields, including communications, finance, human resources, international relations, IT, law and political science. The 18th cycle of the programme opened on 30 March 2020 for placement in 2021. Each vacancy will be opened for four weeks.</p>
<p>Enriching and professional</p>
<p>What are the benefits of a NATO internship? We asked some recent interns for their thoughts.</p>
<p>“Working alongside officers in the Defence Planning and Policy Division proved immensely rewarding and enriching with topics ranging from burden-sharing and the NATO Defence Planning Process to Space Policy. From early on, I was given an opportunity to put my skills and knowledge into practice by presenting background research relevant to various topics, as well as assisting in the proper functioning of committee work.”</p>

From early on, I was given an opportunity to put my skills and knowledge into practice by presenting background research relevant to various topics, as well as assisting in the proper functioning of committee work.” “The Budget Planning and Analysis team coordinates with all NATO Divisions, which necessitates good communication skills. It offers a unique opportunity to meet many people around NATO and learn about their work. I worked on several case studies and contributed to the production of budget reports, which required me to deal with huge amounts of data. These exercises greatly impacted my analytical, mathematical and writing skills. The team is small but very dynamic and dependent on each other, so I also improved my teamwork skills.”</p>

As an intern, one can expect to gain relevant experience in managing external networks and partnerships, dealing with diverse stakeholders, and planning and implementing public diplomacy activities and events both in NATO member nations as well as in partner countries. If you are interested in communications from a public relations and outreach perspective, the Engagements section would be the right choice for you.”</p>

If you are interested in communications from a public relations and outreach perspective, the Engagements section would be the right choice for you.” “The Communication Services Section of the Public Diplomacy Division is a very dynamic and welcoming environment. NATOChannel is one of the parts of the division that handles content that narrates with great videos the ongoing projects of the Alliance and delivers information on NATO’s identity. I have a background in International Relations but also have had some experience in script writing and creating media. So being taken in COMs helped me develop these skills and allowed me to contribute in creating content, all the while still letting me make use of my academic background when working on pieces that talk about cooperation and joint efforts between the Allies.”</p>
<p>A wealth of opportunities</p>
<p>The range of possible thematic orientations is broad: graduate students of aeronautics, engineering, graphic design, journalism, law enforcement, library science, or translation, might also find a unique opportunity to gain international experience in the field of peace and security.</p>
<p>Although some interns stay on at NATO after the internship to complete ongoing assignments or to take up full-time employment, many move on to other international organisations. Whatever their long-term ambitions, NATO interns gain invaluable experience as they strive to achieve them.</p>

<h3 id="tensions-flare-up-between-greece-and-turkey-during-nato-meeting">Tensions flare up between Greece and Turkey during NATO meeting</h3>
<p><img src="https://greekcitytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-03-at-8.11.24-pm.png" alt="img">
Paul Antonopoulos</p>
<p>Tensions erupted between the Greek and Turkish Foreign Ministers during a meeting on Thursday, according to diplomatic sources who spoke to CNN Greece. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu reiterated some of the fake news that his country’s media and leaders have been spreading about Greece during the migration crisis that Turkey unleashed in March.</p>
<p>Ankara claimed that Greek border forces tortured and killed illegal immigrants, something that Turkey attempted to disseminate to international media to discredit Greece with little effect or success. Greek City Times has already debunked the Turkish fake news relating to the migration crisis. However, we must remind our readers that Turkey is one of the lowest ranked countries for media freedoms in the world, is the second most susceptible country surveyed on the European continent to fake news, has the most imprisoned journalists in the whole world, and 90% of media is government controlled.</p>
<p>Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias was not tolerating any of the allegations made by Çavuşoğlu and immediately took the floor during the online NATO conference to inform the alliance that Greece faced an orchestrated and unprecedented attack on its border and a disinformation campaign from Turkey. The methods used by Turkey violated the supposed values ​​of NATO, adding that all so-called allies have the right to call for NATO’s solidarity, but only if they honour their commitments.</p>
<p>The Turkish Foreign Minister became so enraged by Dendias’ comments that he called for a second opportunity to speak. This was promptly rejected by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. Çavuşoğlu clearly thought he was dealing with the Turkish public where he can disseminate the fake news with a high level of believability and little scrutiny, and became frustrated with the rejection that he resigned from the meeting even before the conference was over.</p>
<p>On Twitter, Dendias said “During the Council of Foreign Ministers of the NATO member states, I referred to the recent developments in Evros and the instrumentalization of people, which undermines the values of the Alliance,” but offered no further details to what the diplomatic source revealed.</p>
<p>Both Greece and Turkey became NATO members in 1952, becoming the first new members of the alliance since the formation of it from the original 12 founders. Despite technically becoming NATO ‘allies’, relations have remained hostile between Greece and Turkey, mostly notably during the 1955 Istanbul pogrom when the Greek population of the city decreased from 116,108 to 49,081, the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 and the 1996 Imia Island crisis.</p>
<p>In 2019, Turkish war planes violated Greece’s airspace 4,811 times and Ankara redrew the maritime borders of the Eastern Mediterranean on a new map with the Muslim Brotherhood government in Libya. The new map claimed large swathes of Greece’s maritime space. NATO has not condemned or punished Turkey for any of its hostile actions against Greece.</p>
<p>Spread the love</p>
