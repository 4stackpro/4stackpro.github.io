<p>Michael Gove’s family is in isolation because his daughter developed coronavirus symptoms, his wife Sarah Vine has said.</p>
<p>Ms Vine, a newspaper columnist, wrote about her family’s lockdown in the Daily Mail.</p>
<p>She said daughter Beatrice, 17, had come down with a high fever and “assorted Covid-19 symptoms” on Sunday.</p>
<p>“She seems perfectly fine now (oh, blissful youth),” she added.</p>
<p>“But, as a precaution, the rest of us are now self-isolating, including my husband.”</p>
<p>She went on: “It’s unlikely, in my view, that he will have caught it from her — being a typical teenager, she spends most of her time in voluntary self-isolation in her bedroom.</p>
<p>“On the rare occasions that she does emerge, she studiously avoids all contact with either of us for fear of eliciting unwanted and embarrassing displays of affection.</p>
<p>“Fellow parents of teenagers will know what I’m talking about. Still, better safe than sorry.”</p>

<p>Mr Gove tweeted confirmation of his family’s isolation yesterday.</p>
<p>He wrote: “Many thanks for kind messages. In accordance with the guidance, I am isolating at home after a member of my family started to display mild symptoms of coronavirus on Sunday.</p>
<p>“I have not displayed any symptoms and am continuing to work as normal.”</p>
<p>Aides insisted he was working as normal. But Mr Gove - who does not have symptoms himself - is yet another senior Cabinet minister to be hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>PM Boris Johnson remains in intensive care in London&rsquo;s St Thomas&rsquo; Hospital, where he has been treated with oxygen and could have to be put on a ventilator.</p>
<p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty have both had, then recovered from Covid-19, while other Cabinet ministers have shown symptoms.

<p>Michael Gove is self-isolating after a family member began showing symptoms of coronavirus.</p>
<p>The cabinet office minister is understood to be feeling well himself and is not currently displaying symptoms.</p>
<p>If a relative displays signs of having coronavirus, the guidance suggests you should self-isolate for 14 days.</p>
<p>Mr Gove took part in a round of TV interviews this morning from home, but his self-isolation is another hit for the under pressure Government following Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s admission to hospital.</p>

<p>As one of the most senior members of the PM’s government, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster continues to work, ITV’s political correspondent Paul Brand tweeted.</p>

<p>Earlier, Mr Gove told BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme that ‘the prime minister has received some oxygen support’ but does not yet require a ventilator.</p>

<p>He described Mr Johnson’s condition as ‘a cause for concern’ but said he is ‘in the best hands’ at St Thomas’ Hospital in London.</p>
<p>Mr Gove added that First Secretary of State Dominic Raab has taken over running the country while the PM is being treated for Covid-19.</p>
<p>The deterioration in the Prime Minister’s condition comes at a critical moment in the coronavirus crisis, with the epidemic expected to reach its peak in the UK in the coming days.</p>

<p>There was a palpable sense of shock in Westminster and beyond at the speed of his apparent decline following his admission to hospital on Sunday.</p>
<p>Downing Street said at the time that the move was a ‘precautionary step’ as his symptoms of a cough and high temperature were continuing to persist after 10 days in self-isolation. Initially he was said to have been continuing to work from his hospital bed and was receiving his ministerial red boxes.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>But by 7pm last night, the decision was made to transfer him to intensive care so that a ventilator was close at hand if required. The Cabinet was informed shortly afterwards and the move was made public in an announcement by Number 10 shortly after 8pm.</p>
<p>Mr Gove told the BBC today: ‘We’re all working together to implement the plan the Prime Minister set out in order to try to ensure that we can marshal all the resources of government, indeed all the resources of our country, in the fight against this invisible enemy. The work of government goes on.</p>
<p>‘We have a superb Civil Service and they have ensured that the machinery is there for decisions to be made by ministers, by medical and scientific experts, and for those decisions to be followed through in a way which enables us to help those at the front line.’</p>

<p>Michael Gove has urged Piers Morgan not to stop ‘being himself’ amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The Good Morning Britain host has been holding government ministers to account on the show, however, Gove doesn’t blame him in the slightest.</p>
<p>During an interview after Boris Johnson was taken into intensive care, Piers questioned who was now leading the country.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Mr Gove told him: ‘It’s absolutely right that you and others should challenge us robustly.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>‘I know the reason you do it is because you want us to do the best thing for our country, so don’t stop being yourself. Because all of us want the country to pull through.’</p>
<p>Gove urged him to continue being himself (Picture: ITV)</p>
<p>Piers went on to say: ‘I completely agree, we’re on the same team.’</p>
<p>The presenter also took the opportunity to slam trolls amid the Prime Minister’s coronavirus battle.</p>
<p>‘To those people on social media – I saw this happen last night and I’ve seen this happen again today – who can’t find it in themselves to be positive for the Prime Minister, who want to abuse him, I think it has to be said if you’re of that mindset, just shut up,’ Piers began.</p>
<p>‘Nobody wants to hear this. Nobody wants to hear trolling against Boris Johnson.’ ‘Just stop it,’ Piers demanded.</p>

<p>‘Honestly, it’s against imagination that that should be your thought process. The man is fighting for his life…’</p>
<p>Co-host Susanna Reid then offered: ‘I think it [Boris in intensive care] has alerted more and more people that this disease does not discriminate.’</p>
<p>The Prime Minister, 55, was admitted to hospital as a ‘precaution’ and for tests after suffering from the virus for ten days.</p>
<p>A Number 10 spokesman said: ‘Since Sunday evening, the Prime Minister has been under the care of doctors at St Thomas’ Hospital, in London, after being admitted with persistent symptoms of coronavirus.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>‘Over the course of this afternoon, the condition of the Prime Minister has worsened and, on the advice of his medical team, he has been moved to the intensive care unit at the hospital.</p>
<p>‘The PM has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is the First Secretary of State, to deputise for him where necessary.</p>
<p>‘The PM is receiving excellent care, and thanks all NHS staff for their hard work and dedication.’</p>
<p>Good Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.</p>
