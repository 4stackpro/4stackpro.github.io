<p>Rebeccah Blum, an independent curator based in Berlin who ran a namesake art management firm, has died. The news was confirmed by her daughter Emma Blum in an Instagram post.</p>
<p>In her Instagram post, Emma Blum wrote, “I want to take a moment to talk about my mom. Rebeccah. The person who supported me through every crisis, who raised me and loved me unconditionally. The amazing cook, who could open the fridge and magically make a dish out of something nobody would ever expect to taste good. Who, when she told a story, would sometimes get up, gesturing all over the place, so animated and excited in what she had to tell. I miss her silly ways and the conversations we had in the evening while cooking together. She taught me card tricks and games, took me to the forest to go mushroom hunting.”</p>
<p>Emma Blum’s post continued, “I love her so much and I miss her so terribly. She was just by taken from me, without warning and in such a violent way by one of the people she loved. I can never forgive this and I can never forget this. I want her name to be remembered and nobody else’s.”</p>
<p>Rebeccah Blum was found dead last week. Several media outlets reported the death as a murder-suicide committed by British-born photographer Saul Fletcher. In a statement sent to ARTnews, a spokesperson for the Berlin Public Prosecutor’s Office confirmed the news. The statement added, “According to the present state of knowledge, [Fletcher] first killed the woman you named [Rebeccah Blum] and then committed suicide. Investigations into the causes of death and the circumstances of the crime are still ongoing.”</p>
<p>Rebeccah Blum was well-known in the Berlin art scene. Prior to starting her Berlin-based firm, Blum Fine Art Management, she had been a director at ScheiblerMitte gallery in Berlin (an adjunct exhibition space of Aurel Scheibler in the downtown area of the German capital), joining the enterprise when it opened its space in the city in 2006. Among the exhibitions mounted at ScheiblerMitte, which staged its last presentation in 2011, were solo shows of work by Joe Zucker, Anthony Goicolea, and Michel Auder. Oftentimes, the exhibitions were the artists’ first in Berlin. She also worked on the gallery’s production of its exhibition catalogues and contributed texts on the work of Ad Reinhardt, Alice Neel, and others.</p>
<p>Among Blum’s curatorial credits at ScheiblerMitte was a 2009 group exhibition titled “Shadow/Existence” that Blum organized with Jennifer Bork. The show included work by Jonathan Bragdon, Tom Chamberlain, Öyvind Fahlström, Neil Gall, Nico Glaenzel, Mark Lombardi, Alexander Schellow, David Schutter, Jorinde Voigt, and Michael Wutz.</p>
<p>In the press release to the “Shadow/Existence,” Blum and Bork wrote, “[Chaos and order] alternate rhythmically yet form a whole that refers to the ambivalence of all that is. ‘Shadow/Existence’ addresses this ambivalence in its notion of presence and absence. Oneʼs own shadow cannot exist alone but requires a source of light and an object. It is not representational and not present yet carries the trace of presence within.”</p>
<p>Blum also operated Wordsmith, an editing service focused on German-to-English translation and the production of texts in those two languages. According to the company’s website, clients included the Goethe Institute, Satellite Berlin, the Vitra Design Museum, and the publisher Hatje Cantz, for which she translated some of the essays for an exhibition catalogue of Stephan von Huene.</p>
<p>Blum also worked as the European representative for New York’s David Nolan Gallery for over 10 years. During her tenure at David Nolan, she helped coordinate exhibitions with the gallery’s Europe-based artists at the New York location and worked in the gallery’s art fair booths.</p>
<p>In an email to ARTnews, the gallery’s owner, David Nolan, said, “Rebeccah excelled at explaining art to clients and curators. She was a great communicator and a very warm person that always put the artists and clients at ease. I could trust her totally to choose works from an artist’s studio and make studio visits and liaise for me with dealers and others in our complicated contemporary art world.”</p>
<p>Nolan said that one of the artists whom Blum introduced him to was Berlin-based artist Jorinde Voigt, whom he first met in 2009 and has represented for around 10 years. Nolan subsequently included Voigt in the gallery’s summer exhibition in 2010 and has since mounted six solo shows of Voigt’s work, including one this past spring.</p>
<p>Nolan added, “I will remember her for her honesty, humor, and intelligence. A lovely person who was the most loyal friend one can be fortunate enough to know.”</p>
<p>Update, 7/30/20 2:05 p.m.: This article has been updated to include confirmation from the Berlin Public Prosecutor’s Office that Blum is believed to have been murdered by artist Saul Fletcher.

<p>Rebeccah Blum, a noted arts curator, and Saul Fletcher, a British photographer, have died in Berlin. Although it has not yet been officially verified, multiple media sources reported Blum, 53, was murdered by Fletcher, 52, at his Berlin flat. He is believed to have subsequently committed suicide at Blum’s country home in Brandenburg, west of Berlin. Their bodies were discovered on 22 July.</p>
<p>Fletcher, whose friends say suffered from serious mental health issues, and Blum had been in an on-off relationship for many years. Berlin authorities confirmed that they are not seeking anyone else in conjunction with the case, and Blum&rsquo;s daughter confirmed her mother&rsquo;s death on social media.</p>
<p>Blum, the mother of two children, was born in 1967 and was raised close to Philadelphia. She studied art history in Washington DC before moving to San Francisco to work in an art gallery, supporting herself with restaurant work.</p>
<p>Blum moved to the German city of Düsseldorf in 1992, at the age of 25, before settling in Berlin in 1995, where she co-founded the non-profit arts organisation Base e.V. and the independent publishing platform txt.de. Blum became a director of the ScheiblerMitte gallery Aurel Scheibler in 2007 before founding her own art management firm, Blum Fine Art Management. As a freelancer, she supported the Berlin office of publisher Verlag der Kunst amid countless other projects.</p>
<p>The Berlin-based Mexican artist Julieta Aranda, a friend and colleague, says in an Instagram post that she pays tribute to Blum on behalf of the Berlin artistic community. Aranda remembers “a woman with a name, a profession, a rich life and a precious smile that we want to share with everyone. We are here to express our condolences and sorrow, to pay respect to her achievements and to honour her memory, as the brilliant woman she was and as a dear friend for many. We want to recall her name, and firmly condemn the brutality that took her life away, a too well known violence that needs to stop.”</p>
<p>Emma Blum, 22, one of Rebeccah’s two daughters, used Instagram to remember a committed mother, a ceaselessly inventive cook and an adventurous and enthusiastic lover of life “who supported me through every crisis, who raised me and loved me unconditionally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love her so much and I miss her so terribly,” Blum’s daughter wrote. “She was just taken from me, without warning and in such a violent way by one of the people she loved. I can never forgive this and I can never forget this. I want her name to be remembered and nobody else’s.”</p>
<p>Fletcher was born in 1967 to a working class family in the village of Barton-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire, and spent his early adulthood ferrying coal on cargo ships in Hull harbour. His earliest photographs, made after he joined an amateur photography club, were of North Lincolnshire&rsquo;s docks.</p>
<p>After moving to London in the early 1990s, he set up a makeshift studio in Crouch End and began to explore a form of carefully constructed portraiture, of himself and others. He supported himself by assisting the photographer Juergen Teller.</p>
<p>Fletcher moved to Berlin around the turn of the millennium. Those close to him remembered a warm but erratic man who often seemed happy and content but, at the depths of depression, would rarely leave the confines of his home or studio, where much of his work was created.</p>
<p>Most of his photographs used the walls of his studio as a canvas or backdrop for self-portraits. He would arrange found objects, vegetation, dead animals, Polaroids, paintings, drawings or pages torn from his notebooks, before photographing the composition, or himself in the midst of the composition, with an obsessive repetition.</p>
<p>After gaining representation from New York’s Anton Kern Gallery, Fletcher gained critical recognition for shows at London’s Courtauld Gallery; the Atlanta Contemporary Art Center; the Hessel Museum of Art, New York; MUMOK, Vienna; and the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, among others. He gained some populist fame for his visual work for the London-based alt rock band Placebo and, recently, a friendship with the actor Brad Pitt.</p>
<p>Fletcher’s last solo exhibition, titled Four Loom Weave, went on show at Anton Kern Gallery, New York, in Autumn 2018. Fletcher told the Financial Times at the time: &ldquo;I use whatever I have to hand, trying to create something, trying to make something good out of something bad.”</p>
<p>Fletcher’s most recent artwork, titled Don’t Let the Darkness Get You Down, is part of the exhibition Untitled 2020 on show at Punta della Dogana, Venice, until 13 December 2020.

<h3 id="reflecting-on-the-life-of-rebeccah-blum-accomplished-curator-editor-and-translator">&ldquo;Reflecting on the Life of Rebeccah Blum, Accomplished Curator, Editor, and Translator&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://hyperallergic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/E00E5D8D-E329-45DD-BEF0-3A1903924E30-e1596057278854.jpeg" alt="img">
Rebeccah Blum, a curator, translator, editor, and mother, died in Berlin on July 22. She was murdered by her former partner, British-born photographer Saul Fletcher, who subsequently committed suicide at Blum’s country home. Blum was 53 years old.</p>
<p>Born in 1967, Blum grew up outside of Philadelphia. In 1985 she headed to American University in Washington, DC, to study art history under feminist luminaries like Norma Broude and Mary Garrard, who cemented her interest in gender parity in the art world. After completing her studies, Blum worked at an art gallery and various restaurants in San Francisco.</p>
<p>In 1992, she relocated to Düsseldorf. Three years later, she moved to Berlin where she co-founded and chaired arts non-profit art Base e.V., a rhizomatic entity that held online exhibitions as early as 1995. In 1997, Blum played an integral role in the formation of txt.de, a marketing platform for independent publishers. The ethos of these projects reflected her belief in non-hierarchical collaboration and her penchant for curatorial experimentation and play, not to mention her prescience.</p>
<p>Blum became a director at Berlin-based gallery Aurel Scheiblerin 2007. At the gallery’s ScheiblerMitte outpost, she curated and co-curated several exhibitions, including a show of work by French-American video artist Michel Auder in 2009. She went on to co-found and direct SATELLITE BERLIN, a nonprofit platform committed to forging fruitful connections between artists and scientists, and launched her own eponymous art management firm, Blum Fine Art Management. Blum, who was fully bilingual in German and English, simultaneously built a career as a freelance editor and translator. She worked on monographs, exhibition catalogues, magazines, and more for Anton Kern Gallery, David Noland Gallery, and Hatje Cantz, among other clients. Blum returned to school in 2017 for a Master’s in Management of Cultural and Nonprofit Organizations at University of Kaiserslautern. She graduated this June and was gearing up for a new chapter professionally. Blum was also in the process of writing a book about the art world, her 22-year-old daughter Emma told Hyperallergic.</p>
<p>“She was the most animated person,” Emma continued. “When she told a story, she would get up from the table to gesture with her hands — she told it with her whole body.” Emma described an exuberant woman, someone who laughed easily, made jar after jar of chutney and marmalade, packed her house with art, and was surrounded by friends. Fletcher, Emma explained, was her mother’s on-and-off partner for eight years before he killed Blum and himself.</p>
<p>Posts commemorating Blum have been circulating on Instagram — an effort that is imperative in light of the coverage of her death, pieces that have glossed over her personhood to instead laud Fletcher’s art career or sensationalize his personal connections.</p>
<p>Berlin-based gallery ChertLüdde captioned an image of a beaming Blum, “She was a beautiful person who dearly deserves to be remembered as such, a Woman with a name, a profession, a rich life and a precious smile that we want to share with everyone.” The caption went on to express that the gallery “firmly condemn[ed] the brutality that took her life away, a too well known violence that needs to stop.”</p>
<p>Jane Rosenzweig, a close friend of Blum’s since their freshman year of college, portrayed Blum as someone who loved beautiful things, the type of person to pack a picnic on a whim. “Everyone felt this magnetic pull toward her because she was so special, so loving, so curious. She wanted to understand everything; that’s how she was in every interaction,” she told Hyperallergic. “We can’t measure what we’ve lost.”

<p><img src="https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/AP_080911011155.jpg?w=1024" alt="img">
Editor’s Note: ARTnews has issued an apology to the family of Rebeccah Blum regretting that the original version of this article covering the shocking news of Blum’s murder hadn’t been more respectful of her and her many accomplishments. Read a separate obituary of Blum, published on July 29, 2020, here.</p>
<p>Saul Fletcher, a British-born, Berlin-based artist, is the subject of an investigation “on the suspicion of murder” of Rebeccah Blum, a well-regarded Berlin-based curator who was found dead last week before Fletcher reportedly committed suicide. Blum’s death was confirmed this week by her daughter, Emma Blum.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to ARTnews, a spokesperson for the Berlin Public Prosecutor’s Office confirmed the news. The statement added, “According to the present state of knowledge, [Fletcher] first killed the woman you named [Rebeccah Blum] and then committed suicide. Investigations into the causes of death and the circumstances of the crime are still ongoing.”</p>
<p>The spokesperson did not provide further details about the investigation, including those that have been circulating in the press surrounding the story, which was first reported by the Daily Mail.</p>
<p>Rebeccah Blum, who was in a romantic relationship with Fletcher, was a well-regarded independent curator in Berlin. She had previously worked as director at ScheiblerMitte, an outpost of Berlin’s Aurel Scheibler gallery. She also ran a fine art management services, Blum Fine Art Management, and an editing service focused on German-to-English translation, Wordsmith. She also worked for over 10 years as the European representative for David Nolan Gallery in New York. Read a full obituary for Blum.</p>
<p>“I love her so much and I miss her so terribly,” Emma Blum, her daughter, wrote on Instagram. “She was just by taken from me, without warning and in such a violent way by one of the people she loved. I can never forgive this and I can never forget this. I want her name to be remembered and nobody else’s.”</p>
<p>The three galleries that represented Fletcher at the time of his death—Anton Kern Gallery in New York, Knust Kunz Gallery Editions in Munich, and Grice Bench in Los Angeles—provided to ARTnews a joint statement regarding the reports: “We are devastated, appalled, and shocked by the tragic loss of Rebeccah Blum and Saul Fletcher. We are all grief-stricken and confused. We offer our deepest condolences to their families and together are offering our support and help.”</p>
<p>Fletcher first came to prominence in the late 1990s when he began showing with New York’s Anton Kern Gallery. His work has appeared in major international exhibitions as well, including the 30th Bienal de São Paulo in 2012, the 4th Berlin Biennale in 2006, and the 2004 Carnegie International in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Update, July 30, 2020: This article has been updated to include a statement from the Berlin Public Prosecutor’s Office confirming that Saul Fletcher is a suspect in the investigation into Rebeccah Blum’s murder.

<h3 id="germany-increases-national-art-acquisition-budget-by-600-percent">&ldquo;Germany Increases National Art Acquisition Budget by 600 Percent&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.artforum.com/uploads/upload.002/id18112/featured00_landscape.jpg" alt="img">
On Monday, the German government announced a surprise six-fold addition to the Federal Art Collection’s acquisition budget as part of a new cultural initiative to help artists, galleries, and dealers impacted by the pandemic. The ministry’s funds will increase from $590,000 to $3.5 million.</p>
<p>The bonus aims to “provide a rapid and effective impulse to revive art production in the current difficult situation,” according to Culture Minister Monika Grütters. It is an addendum to the country’s $1.17 billion New Start initiative, a bailout for the cultural sector that launched in June and has been favorably compared to the Depression-era Federal Art Project in the United States.</p>
<p>The majority of the June relief package was earmarked for institutions that do not already receive public funding. Its focus on institutions was criticized by organizations including the Association of Visual Artists in Berlin, which charged the culture ministry with ignoring the needs of freelancers.</p>
<p>The pandemic-response initiative is tasked with purchasing about 150 works from art fairs, from small galleries, and directly from artists’ studios, with the stipulations that individuals and organizations may not apply to be considered and that no acquisition is to be valued above $24,000. All decisions will be based on recommendations from five jurors, who will serve for a period of five years: the Kunstmuseum Stuttgart’s Ulrike Groos, the Hamburger Bahnhof’s Anna-Catharina Gebbers, the Kunsthalle Bielefeld’s Friedrich Meschede, and the MARTa Herford’s Roland Nachtigäller. The Federal Art Collection was founded in 1970 and holds about 1,700 works of art, which are loaned out to national museums.</p>

<h3 id="brigid-berlin-19392020">&ldquo;Brigid Berlin (1939–2020)&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.artforum.com/uploads/upload.002/id18066/featured00_landscape.jpg" alt="img">
Brigid Berlin, the wayward ex-debutante who rose to Superstardom as a denizen of Andy Warhol’s Silver Factory—voraciously documented in thousands of her Polaroids and recordings—has died at age eighty. Born into New York high society, Berlin made her way to its underground by the mid-1960s, becoming Warhol’s closest confidante. He debuted her in his breakthrough film Chelsea Girls (1966), in which she played a loquacious lesbian drug dealer. She took a job as a secretary at the Factory and, like many there, began compulsively recording its goings-on; her taped phone conversations with Warhol provided a bulk of the material in the artist’s 1975 book The Philosophy of Andy Warhol: From A to B &amp; Back Again (she was the B). She carried her recorder everywhere, from the back room at Max’s Kansas City to the Waldorf Astoria for tea with the Duchess of Windsor. “Berlin wasn’t recording for posterity; she was recording for the present,” wrote Rachel Churner in a 2015 Artforum review. “Capturing it all was a means of validating her presence.”</p>
<p>Born in 1939, Berlin was the third and eldest child of Richard E. Berlin, the longtime chair of the Hearst empire, and socialite Muriel “Honey” Berlin. The couple’s orbit included some of Hollywood’s biggest names, European royalty, and a handful of American presidents. “My mother wanted me to be a slim, respectable socialite,” Berlin once said. “Instead, I became an overweight troublemaker.” After scandalizing her parents by marrying (and quickly divorcing) John Clark, a gay window dresser, Berlin took up residence at the Chelsea Hotel in 1964. That year, curator Henry Geldzahler took her to Warhol’s aluminum-walled loft on Forty-Seventh Street, where she soon became a fixture known for her exhibitionism and intravenous speed habit, which earned her the nickname “Brigid Polk.” In addition to becoming a lifelong friend and attaché of Warhol’s, she went on to appear in several of his films, including Imitation of Christ (1967), Women in Revolt (1971), and Bad (1977); in Edie Sedgwick’s final film, John Palmer’s Ciao! Manhattan (1972); and in John Waters’s Serial Mom (1994) and Pecker (1998). She was an editor at Warhol’s Interview magazine into the 1980s.</p>
<p>In 1969, Warhol infamously told Time magazine that Berlin was the creator of all his paintings—a joke he quickly retracted due to his work’s instant decline in value. In fact, although Berlin has gained recognition in recent years as an innovative conceptualist in her own right, she repeatedly rejected the term artist. Even so, she helped shape the Warholian canon and was a vital presence at the Factory. She became known for her “Tit Prints,” 1966–96—canvases onto which she stamped her paint-dripped breasts—and for outrageous performances that featured her on the phone with unsuspecting callers, including her mother. Berlin also organized The Cock Book, a legendary three-volume scrapbook, eventually bought by Richard Prince for $175,000, of penis drawings by Jasper Johns, Jane Fonda, Larry Rivers, Leonard Cohen, and several others. Her witty, deadpan snapshots and double exposures inspired many, including Gerhard Richter—he included them in his epic “Atlas” project—and introduced Warhol to the Polaroid camera, which would famously accompany him everywhere.</p>
<p>“I got into Polaroids even before Andy got into them because of some pictures I saw in Vogue in the early ’60s by Marie Cosindas,” Berlin explained in a 2015 Artforum interview. “She was one of the first photographers to use Polaroids seriously. I wanted to take pictures like hers.” In 2015, some of these images were compiled by Reel Art Press into a book, Brigid Berlin: Polaroids, and shown at Invisible-Exports gallery on the Lower East Side. “I had access to all these people because I was a peer, I was considered one of them,” she said of her subjects, a who’s who of the ’60s and ’70s New York art world. “I was never a groupie.”</p>
<p>For the past couple of decades, Berlin lived as a self-described recluse in her apartment near Gramercy Park, going out only “on the phone.” She worked on digitizing her trove of recordings, stitched exquisite needlepoint pillows of tabloid covers, starred in a 2000 documentary by former Warhol studio manager Vincent Fremont titled Pie in the Sky, doted on her various pugs, and binged cable news. “I don’t regret anything,” she told Interview in 2015. “I mean, what’s the point of it?”</p>

<h3 id="metropolitan-museum-of-art-and-philadelphia-museum-of-art-make-deep-cuts-to-staff">&ldquo;Metropolitan Museum of Art and Philadelphia Museum of Art Make Deep Cuts to Staff&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.artforum.com/uploads/upload.002/id18116/featured00_landscape.jpg" alt="img">
New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art, which laid off more than eighty employees after it closed to the public in March due to concerns around Covid-19, has issued a second round of staff cuts in anticipation of a $150 million drop in revenue. In a memo sent Wednesday, chief executive officer Daniel H. Weiss and director Max Hollein informed Met employees that seventy-nine staff members were laid off, ninety-three voluntarily retired early, and a further 181 were furloughed, reducing the museum’s overall ranks by 20 percent since March of this year.</p>
<p>Cuts took place across the museum, with retail, security, and visitor service departments hit the hardest. The museum expects furloughs to be in effect for no longer than six months. The New York Times reports that 48 percent of those who lost their positions are people of color, who represent 43 percent of the Met’s total number of staffers. Those affected will remain on the museum’s payroll through August 29 and will receive health coverage through the end of the month.</p>
<p>According to Weiss and Hollein’s memo, other retrenchment measures taken by the museum include a hiring freeze, programming cuts, and a redirection of the funds generated by the Met’s $3 billion endowment. Both men took 20 percent pay cuts on their high six-figure salaries, while eleven other executives each forfeited 10 percent. The museum plans to begin welcoming visitors five days a week on August 29 but has acknowledged that the date might be pushed back further.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Museum of Art (PMA)—whose staff officially voted to form a union today with AFSCME District Council 47—has similarly eliminated a large percentage of its workforce to balance budgets upset by financial stress brought on by the pandemic. The first round came in April, when the PMA cut more than one hundred positions through furloughs and voluntary retirements. On Tuesday, the museum announced that eighty-five employees would be laid off, with another forty-two having accepted voluntary separation agreements, bringing the total number of staffers down by 23 percent since the pandemic began. The news arrived as workers were concluding their months-long union drive, launched after employees raised concerns over a culture of abuse and discrimination at the museum, whose former director Joshua Helmer departed the Erie Art Museum in January amid sexual harassment allegations. The Philadelphia Inquirer reports that the PMA, which intends to partially reopen in September, faces a loss of $16 million in income.</p>
