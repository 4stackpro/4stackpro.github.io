<p>A bill aimed at increasing Colorado’s childhood vaccination will get another hearing this Sunday. Despite coronavirus and racial justice protests, it’s expected to draw what will be the biggest crowds of this mid-pandemic legislative session.</p>
<p>The measure already caused a delay in the House calendar when Republicans slowed the pace of debate on Friday.</p>
<p>Roxborough Park Republican Rep. Mark Baisley said he was furious at the sudden scheduling of a bill for a Sunday hearing at noon. Lawmakers occasionally work on a Saturday, but a Sunday is almost unheard of.</p>
<p>“This may be the final weekend before the 2020 Session finally comes to a close and I was close to allowing myself to believe that the Democrats would give Colorado’s parents some relief — Relief from the fear of having a critical choice taken from them; choice in what goes into their children’s bodies. My heart sank when they informed me that a rare meeting of the committee will meet on Sunday to introduce Senate Bill 163. SUNDAY!” Baisley said.</p>
<p>The bill would require parents who want to opt a child out of vaccines to either get a signature from an immunization provider or watch an online informational video produced by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. It would also set a state goal of reaching a 95 percent immunization rate.</p>
<p>Right now parents need to fill out a form and return it to the school.</p>
<p>“To know that we&rsquo;re still at risk for that with the rates that we have is extremely scary,” said Democratic sponsor and emergency room nurse, Rep. Kyle Mullica of Northglenn. “This pandemic has shown us is what life is like to deal with something when we don&rsquo;t have a vaccine for.”</p>
<p>Most parents in Colorado do vaccinate their children. However, the percentage of Colorado kindergartners vaccinated for measles, mumps and rubella has dropped to 87 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — the lowest rate in the country. Public health officials say that makes pockets of the state especially prone to a measles outbreak. That was before COVID-19.</p>
<p>Sean O’Leary, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Children&rsquo;s Hospital Colorado, said the state has since “seen dramatic drops in vaccination because of all the social and physical distancing measures” and people’s infection concerns about visiting their doctors.</p>
<p>“So our vaccination rates in Colorado have already taken a hit because of COVID-19,” O&rsquo;Leary said “So it&rsquo;s really important that we do everything we possibly can to bring those rates up. And I think this bill would go a long way towards doing that.”</p>
<p>The bill originally cleared the Senate back in February after a marathon committee hearing, before the legislature temporarily adjourned the session for the pandemic.</p>
<p>Yael Cohen, a special education advocate from Boulder, opposes the bill and doesn’t understand why lawmakers have taken it back up. Because she’s in a high-risk category for the coronavirus, she’s concerned she won’t be able to testify against it in person.</p>
<p>“With everything going on with the virus and with the protests and riots, this is the priority?” she questioned.</p>
<p>Lawmakers will allow written remarks but Cohen is dismissive of that as “it’s not like they read those and consider those before they vote.”</p>
<p>Another critic of the bill, Theresa Wrangham, the executive director for the National Vaccine Information Center, feels the measure is an effort to coerce people into vaccinating their children.</p>
<p>“You&rsquo;re assuming that this group of people who have come to a different decision are ignorant,” she said. “They require education, and you&rsquo;re going to make them give up their federal privacy rights in order to get their personal and religious beliefs approved so that their children can attend school. That is wrong to so many of us.”</p>
<p>Supporters are just as steadfast.</p>
<p>Denver Democratic Rep. Susan Lontine, chair of The House Health &amp; Insurance Committee which will hear the bill, said holding the hearing on Sunday was responsible. Each side will be limited to an hour and a half of testimony.</p>
<p>“We have an abbreviated session to finish up a lot of work and we missed two days last week. There wasn’t a lot of time. The other reason I suggested it, was to do what I could to minimize exposure to the staff because there wouldn’t be any other business in the building on Sunday.”</p>
<p>Lontine said she won’t be “held hostage” by a vocal minority.</p>
<p>“It’s business the state needs to finish.&rdquo; She thinks it’s in the best interest of public health. As one supporter said, “if we can’t pass a vaccine bill during a pandemic, when can we?”

<h3 id="classes-that-click-a-semester-to-remember">&ldquo;Classes that click: a semester to remember&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="http://news.emory.edu/stories/2020/05/er_covid_remote_classes_wrap_up/thumbs/story_main.jpg" alt="img">
“I was really impressed with my students’ resilience and their ability to roll with this transition, but also their need to maintain interpersonal connection – even if it’s only through the Zoom grid,&rdquo; says Christina E. Crawford, assistant professor of modern and contemporary architecture.</p>
<p>“Classes that Click” is a series spotlighting how Emory is adapting undergraduate courses to remote learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Each column will showcase one course, with insights and tips from both the professor and students. View more “Classes that Click” stories.</p>
<p>From taping class schedules to bedroom walls to keep time zones straight to creating whiteboard teaching surfaces on bookcases, Emory’s faculty, students and staff did whatever they could to make remote learning work during the second half of spring semester. Countless lessons – during class times and beyond – were learned along the way that many believe will serve them well when the Emory community returns to campus.</p>
<p>Gathering student input</p>
<p>One of the first decisions faculty needed to make was whether to teach synchronously, asynchronously or a combination of the two.</p>
<p>Mike Rogers, associate professor of mathematics and computer science at Oxford College, says one primary goal was to ensure that students had the best opportunity to learn. When he invited students from his Calculus I course to meet during spring break via Zoom to discuss ways they might carry the course forward, most participated.</p>
<p>“The trials and testing we did before and after the end of spring break rebuilt the trust we had established at the beginning of the course,” Rogers says. “We could meet their learning goals, the rules and logistics of assignments and assessments would be manageable, they wouldn’t have to stress out about meeting requirements. I appreciated the students’ help as we [Rogers and his co-teacher, Nicolas Petit] put together our new plans.”</p>
<p>Andra Gillespie, associate professor of political science, surveyed her students to get a sense of their physical locations and internet access. That was important for Gillespie&rsquo;s students and others across campus, since some such as Esteban Ancona Garcia, a sophomore from Merida, Mexico, hadn’t studied at home in several years.</p>
<p>Based on what she learned from her students and through department training, Gillespie decided to teach her classes synchronously and then provide lecture recordings for students who could not attend class.</p>
<p>Katherine Ostrom, senior lecturer in Spanish and Portuguese, opted for a different type of combination approach. She held shorter synchronous sessions during the original course time and make-up sessions later in the day (both of which were recorded). She also posted about half the day’s material in a video for students to watch at their convenience.</p>
<p>“It took a little extra time, but a nice side benefit was getting to work with a smaller group each time and devote the whole meeting to discussion,” she says.</p>
<p>Connecting beyond class</p>
<p>The remote environment led some students to reach out to professors for the first time.</p>
<p>“Many students had managed the first part of the semester on their own and not sought any personal help from me,” Rogers says. “During the initial transition I dealt with more students on an individual basis than normal. When two people come together committed to a shared goal – in this case, what the student needs to be able to learn the material – it is such a joy to listen to them, discuss possible solutions and feel the tension dissolve as you move from a problem to a solution you can both be happy with.”</p>
<p>Remote learning also gave faculty and students opportunities to learn more about each other than they might in a typical classroom, from seeing siblings or pets on screen to taking extra time to chat.</p>
<p>“I would arrive to Zoom meetings a few minutes early to talk to others about how they were doing,” says Kevin Kim, a student in Nosayba El-Sayed’s “Introduction to Database Systems” class. “Catching up with professors and classmates made me realize what unique individuals all of us are and that not taking that first step in getting to know the people around you is an opportunity lost.”</p>
<p>Goizueta Business School student Tate Stevenson agrees. “I have gained a greater appreciation for the value and need of community and belonging. Checking in on others and making an effort to remain connected and engaged is critical.”</p>
<p>Students also took it upon themselves to connect outside class. For example, Sally Kim, who graduated with double majors in computer science and psychology, says one of her friends created weekly “Silent Disco” nights on Zoom so students could see their friends and meet new ones.</p>
<p>“I was really impressed with my students’ resilience and their ability to roll with this transition, but also their need to maintain interpersonal connection – even if it’s only through the Zoom grid,” says Christina E. Crawford, assistant professor of modern and contemporary architecture in the Art History Department. “I lost Wi-Fi connection between our Zoom opening chitchat and delivering my first online lecture. I was offline for 10 minutes and when I came back they were still all there, asking me to give the lecture.”</p>
<p>Factoring in fun</p>
<p>“One challenge was to maintain student engagement and motivation levels in an online setting while making sure classes stayed interactive and fun,” says El-Sayed, a computer science lecturer. “Another challenge was getting the students to turn on their webcams to create a more interactive class experience.”</p>
<p>To help meet those challenges, El-Sayed invited everyone to pick a Zoom background based on a theme for each lecture. Themes included Hogwarts School of Magic, baby photos of themselves, monuments from the cities where they currently resided, White Hall 206 (their classroom on campus) and graduation ceremonies.</p>
<p>“If students were shy or couldn’t turn on their cameras, they could change their Zoom avatar to match the theme,” El-Sayed says.</p>
<p>“Seeing others in the lecture hall seemed surreal, but was funny in a way,” says Kevin Kim, who would change his virtual background in other classes as well. “In one class I changed my virtual background to a picture of a grocery store aisle. Many, including the professor, got a good laugh out of it. Some even changed their backgrounds to join me.”</p>
<p>Incorporating current events</p>
<p>While faculty often incorporate aspects of current events into their classes, the pandemic provided avenues for that across multiple subjects.</p>
<p>“I tried to lean into the crisis and use it to advance learning goals,” Gillespie says. “I was somewhat intentional about using examples from the crisis in lecture examples and test questions. There were times when I purposely didn’t talk about the crisis to avoid raising anxieties, but it sometimes provided excellent examples of the concepts we were studying in class.”</p>
<p>El-Sayed also found ways to connect her database systems course to COVID-19. A friend who is an epidemiologist told El-Sayed that scientists would benefit from a database system that consolidates information from multiple sources, enabling easier analysis. El-Sayed turned her friend’s observation into a class assignment, asking students to design a “schema” for a database system that could eventually be used by scientists analyzing the pandemic.</p>
<p>Looking to the future</p>
<p>“There are lots of ways to come together as a classroom community, and virtual does not have to mean cold or impersonal,” says Melissa Williams, Goizueta term chair and associate professor of organization and management. “This crisis drew attention to just how committed everyone at Emory is to taking care of those we’re responsible for.</p>
<p>“Our medical colleagues stepped up patient care and faculty rose to the challenge of remote teaching – even the ones who didn’t necessarily consider themselves to be technically savvy. It’s clear that we are all committed to delivering a world-class education, even during a pandemic.”</p>
<p>However, even the positives associated with remote learning don’t outweigh the belief by faculty and students that being together on campus is special. Kara Trotman, a biology and Spanish double major from Seattle, and Yael Cohen, a finance major from Costa Rica, both look forward to when they can learn face-to-face with their professors and fellow students.</p>
<p>“When the pandemic is over, I will be appreciative every day for the opportunity to walk around campus with my friends, sit inside a classroom, run in Lullwater Preserve and attend club meetings in the business school or study groups at the library,” Cohen says.</p>
<p>“We are all making it work online, but face-to-face learning is invaluable – a true gift, actually,” Crawford says. “The diverse scholarly community that grows inside the four physical walls of a classroom is one of the most memorable aspects of the college experience. I suspect that once we’re through this we’ll appreciate campus and classroom life more than ever.”

<p>Scooter Braun and his wife make their romance work by &ldquo;giving each other space&rdquo; when they need it.</p>
<p>The 38-year-old record executive has been married to businesswoman Yael Cohen - with whom he has Jagger, five, Levi, three, and Hart, 15 months - since 2014, and Yael has now dished on the secret to their lasting love, which she says comes from being able to support one another in &ldquo;whatever way&rdquo; they need it, including backing off and giving space where appropriate.</p>
<p>She said: &ldquo;Whether that is time together to figure it out or it&rsquo;s giving each other space to know the processing, giving each other grace when life is low. Sometimes things are going to have more attention and sometimes things are going to have less attention, but knowing that we signed up for better or for worse and giving each other what we need in that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I look at everything through the lens of 20 years down the road. Am I going to look back and be proud of how we responded to something, how we dealt with something, how we figured it out? I always want the answer to be yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scooter and Yael, 33, keep romance alive by enjoying date nights together, which can range from nights out to watching Netflix shows on the couch.

Making it work! Yael Braun is a busy career woman and a mother of three, but she still makes time for date nights with husband Scooter Braun between it all.</p>
<p>“Sometimes they’re really exciting and we go and do something fun where we go and take a night with friends and do something that we love,” Yael, 33, told Us Weekly exclusively while attending AllBright’s BrightList Awards — where she was an honoree — in West Hollywood on Monday, March 9. “And sometimes it’s literally just making dinner and watching Love Is Blind on the couch, which is equally as exciting, not gonna lie.”</p>
<p>The F–k Cancer founder continued, “I think it’s just turning off the phone and being with each other, wherever that is. Sometimes that’s at home and sometimes that’s out, but being intentional and purposeful because that’s our time.”</p>
<p>Both Yael and Scooter lead busy lives not just as parents, but through their respective career paths. Yael is an award-winning businesswoman, while Scooter is a famed manager to stars including Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande. Speaking to Us at Monday’s event, Yael revealed that the couple support one another in “whatever way we need it.”</p>
<p>“Whether that is time together to figure it out or it’s giving each other space to know the processing, giving each other grace when life is low,” the South African native explained. “Sometimes things are going to have more attention and sometimes things are going to have less attention, but knowing that we signed up for better or for worse and giving each other what we need in that moment.”</p>
<p>Yael added, “I look at everything through the lens of 20 years down the road. Am I going to look back and be proud of how we responded to something, how we dealt with something, how we figured it out? I always want the answer to be ‘yes.’”</p>
<p>Yael wed Scooter in July 2014 in Whistler, Canada. The couple are now the parents of three children: sons Jagger, 5, and Levi, 3, and daughter Hart, 15 months.</p>
<p>On Monday, Yael admitted that she balances parenthood “with a lot of help,” adding, “[It’s] a lot of asking for help, and a lot of grace. A lot of scheduling and understanding when you can and when you can’t and also knowing your personal priorities.”</p>
<p>Yael, meanwhile, launched her F–k Cancer in 2009 after her mother, Diane Cohen, was diagnosed with the disease. The nonprofit health organization works toward early detection and cancer prevention. She was honored for her efforts at Monday’s AllBright’s BrightList Awards, where she was named BrightList Philanthropic Leader.</p>
<p>In the wake of her accomplishment, she told Us how she was “very grateful” to be recognized and how other women can get into entrepreneurship. “Believe in yourself, first and foremost. You’ve got to really believe in what you’re trying to do because if you don’t, nobody else will,” she shared. “And ask for help. I think so often we think it’s a sign of weakness to ask for help, but it’s not, actually.”</p>

<h3 id="who-is-yael-cohen-braun-a-canadian-philanthropist-whos-married-to-scooter">&ldquo;Who Is Yael Cohen Braun? A Canadian Philanthropist Who&rsquo;s Married To Scooter&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d1bc28c2400003400faa440.jpeg?cache=qXG0zJ82iJ&amp;ops=1778_1000" alt="img">
Maybe you missed it, maybe you didn’t, but in either case, maybe you aren’t yet too familiar with Yael Cohen Braun, one of the key Canadian characters in the dramatically unfolding Taylor Swift vs. Scooter Braun controversy, which has been infecting the far reaches of the internet since Sunday.</p>
<p>In the event that you have managed to stumble through the last two days without hearing about snakes, or scooters, or Scotts, here’s the quick and dirty: a major music manager now owns all of Taylor Swift’s master recordings, and she isn’t too happy about it.</p>
<p>In a Tumblr post on Sunday, Swift referred to Scooter Braun as an “incessant, manipulative bully,” at which point his wife, Yael Cohen Braun, sprang into the ring and tried to ring the final bell.</p>
<p>Watch: Here are all the Canadians caught up in the feud between Taylor Swift and Scooter Braun. Story continues below.</p>
<p>Yael Cohen — who was born in South Africa but raised in Vancouver — is most known for being the founder of Fuck Cancer, a nonprofit organization dedicated to “prevention, early detection and providing emotional support and guidance to those affected by cancer.”</p>
<p>Cohen, who also earned a B.A. in Political Science from the University of British Columbia, started the organization in 2009, when she was 22 and her mother had just been diagnosed with breast cancer.</p>
<p>After witnessing her mother’s first surgery, Cohen made her a T-shirt that would become the beginnings of her charity: it read, “Fuck Cancer.”</p>
<p>“My mother is not the type of woman to say [that] word, never mind wear it,” Cohen said in an interview with Makers. “She wore the damn thing day in and day out.”</p>
<p>Fuck Cancer resonated far beyond Cohen’s own family, exceeding her expectations and becoming a force in engaging millennials, through social media, to spread awareness about cancer and early detection.</p>
<p>She began to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars by selling T-shirts and other products — money she directed toward cancer-education measures.</p>
<p>In 2011, Cohen was named one of “12 people who are transforming philanthropy” by The Globe and Mail, alongside the likes of Bill Gates and Bono.</p>
<p>Other titles she’s scooped up along the way: one of Canada’s Most Powerful Women, per the Financial Post; one of Vancouver’s 40 under 40 in Vancouver Magazine; one of Elle’s 2012 Genius Award recipients … the list continues.</p>

<p>In 2014, amid her mounting success, Cohen married a man named Scott Braun, who goes by “Scooter.” Scooter was an American music manager who had already started making a name for himself, having already appeared on the cover of Billboard as one of 40 “Power Players On The Rise.”</p>
<p>Yael Cohen became Yael Cohen Braun — not, as it happens, Yael Cohen Scooter — and the following year, the couple announced that they were expecting their first child together.</p>
<p>In 2016, Cohen Braun launched Motherlucker, an online forum that billed itself as a website for “parenthood, uncensored.”</p>
<p>It was designed in the kind of DIY blog-style that evokes a parent’s notebook rather than a how-to rulebook, and takes on topics like miscarriages, public breastfeeding and how to respond to strangers touching your baby.</p>
<p>It made sense — months after the site launched, Cohen Braun had another baby, and had already become comfortable enough with saying “Fuck Cancer” that her website could be tinged with profanities and nobody would bat an eyelash.</p>
<p>The now-mother of three has since expanded her empire and become a senior advisor at Bumble, which acquired the assets of Motherlucker.</p>
<p>At Bumble, Cohen Braun has been tasked with growing the company’s three platforms, as well as working on brand partnerships and continuing, in general, the growth of its business.</p>

<p>All of this is to say that there’s no doubt Cohen Braun is, in her own right, a powerhouse, but also that it’s surprising she hasn’t made any forays into fashion, considering how talented she is at — in her words — the public “airing of laundry.”</p>
<p>She also seems to have an ear for poetry, apparent in her claim that Swift has amassed and discarded friends “like wilted flowers.” Is there anything, then, that Cohen Braun can’t do?</p>
<p>Anyway, if your interest description includes watching celebrities dogpile and wrestle and fight over some obscure and distant situation that really has nothing to do with you, but that you can’t stop paying attention to anyway, just keep your eyes glued to Twitter. The Swifties, like little investigative journalists, are bound to dig up more and more dirt to feed your private entertainment.

Yael Cohen Braun and Scooter Braun attend the MOCA Benefit 2019 at The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA on May 18, 2019 in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Pop stars like Halsey and Justin Bieber have already picked sides after Taylor Swift spoke out today (June 30) about Scooter Braun acquiring her Big Machine catalog, and now Braun&rsquo;s wife Yael Cohen Braun has taken to Instagram to call out Swift and share her side of the story.</p>
<p>In a post captioned, &ldquo;@taylorswift, I&rsquo;m here to talk privately any time,&rdquo; Cohen Braun alleges that Swift was given a heads-up about the deal, writing, &ldquo;Your dad is a shareholder and was notified, and Borchetta personally told you this before it came out. So no, you didn&rsquo;t find out with the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Swift denied that her father Scott knew of the deal in advance, telling People, &ldquo;Scott Swift is not on the board of directors and has never been. On June 25, there was a shareholder phone call that Scott Swift did not participate in due to a very strict NDA that bound all shareholders and prohibited any discussion at all without risk of severe penalty.&rdquo; Billboard has reached out for additional comment.</p>
<p>Cohen Braun also responds to Swift&rsquo;s comment about Braun&rsquo;s &ldquo;incessant, manipulative bullying,&rdquo; writing, &ldquo;Girl, who are you to talk about bullying? The world has watched you collect and drop friends like wilted flowers. My husband is anything but a bully, he&rsquo;s spent his life standing up for people and causes he believes in.&rdquo;</p>

Doing it differently! Yael Braun and Scooter Braun are intentional about not teaching their three children gender stereotypes at a young age.</p>
<p>“It starts so young, and I didn’t realize it until I had boys,” the F–k Cancer creator, 33, exclusively reveals of Jagger, 5, and Levi, 3, in the new issue of Us Weekly. “They’d be at school and come home and be like, ‘Boys don’t do that. Your favorite color is pink because you’re a girl.’ And i’m like, ‘Actually, Mommy likes dark blue, and you can like whatever color you like.’”</p>
<p>She and the record executive, 38, know that these biases run deeper than color preferences, though, which is why they also encourage their sons to cry.</p>
<p>“[I tell them], ‘Cry if your body is hurting or your heart is sad. We just don’t cry to get our way,’” Yael, who also shares her 16-month-old daughter, Hart, with Scooter, tells Us. “It’s a lot of soundbites, trying to teach them that whatever they’re being taught through pop culture isn’t what we believe. We believe men and women, boys and girls, are equally strong, smart and capable. They can like the same things or they can like different things.”</p>
<p>The South Africa native isn’t always perfect when it comes to getting this across, she admits to Us.</p>
<p>“If I make a mistake, I [tell them so],” the businesswoman explains. “I think it’s important for them to also see that we make mistakes and then it’s okay to fix it and make it better. Often we want to pretend that everything goes right. So I’ll go, ‘Oh! I don’t why I said that,’ or ‘Actually, I was wrong,’ and then we talk about it and take the opportunity to teach.”</p>
<p>She and the New York native tied the knot in 2014 in Canada. They started growing their family the following year.</p>
<p>The couple make time for their marriage with date nights, from “fun and exciting” nights out to Love Is Blind marathons on the couch. “I think it’s just turning off the phone and being with each other, wherever that is,” Yael says.</p>
