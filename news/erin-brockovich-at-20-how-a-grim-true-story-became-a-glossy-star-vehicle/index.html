In 1989, Steven Soderbergh changed the independent film business forever with sex, lies and videotape. A decade later, he conquered Hollywood. But it’s important not to yadda yadda away the years in between, when his sophomore slump (1991’s Kafka) extended to a junior slump (1993’s King of the Hill) and a senior slump (1995’s The Underneath), and he seemed lost in a wilderness of his own design. Arguments can (and should) be made for his work during this period – the Depression-era drama King of the Hill is one of his best films, and all three are varied and conceptually adventurous – but Soderbergh himself felt so discombobulated by failure that he wrote, directed, starred, edited and photographed 1996’s Schizopolis, an experimental doodle, just to give his career a hard reboot. Two years later, he made the superb Elmore Leonard adaptation Out of Sight for Universal Pictures, and he was off and running again.</p>

<p>When Soderbergh started 2000 with Erin Brockovich and ended it with Traffic, both earning him best director nominations at the Oscars (he won for the latter), it almost felt calculated, like he had made a bet with himself that he could pivot from indie iconoclast to commercial juggernaut over the course of a four-year period. As many of the era’s biggest stars – George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Matt Damon chief among them – strolled out to the Fountains of the Bellagio in Las Vegas at the end of his Ocean’s Eleven remake in 2001, it was the capper to a time when Soderbergh had cracked the code, squaring his sensibility with mass-market entertainment.</p>
<p>Soderbergh would go back to the lab soon afterwards with the digital experimentation of Full Frontal and Bubble, and studio films such as Solaris and Ocean’s Twelve, which were much further afield. Now 20 years old, Erin Brockovich stands out as the closest Soderbergh has gotten to making an old-fashioned star vehicle, one that’s issue-driven to a point, but more about harnessing the power of Julia Roberts, who dominates every scene she’s in – which happens to be almost all of them. Soderbergh’s wizardry with the environmental procedural owes much to All the President’s Men, a touchstone for many of his films about how complex systems work, from the drug war (Traffic) to viral outbreaks (Contagion) to financial fraud (The Laundromat). But he’s also doing for Roberts what Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore did for Ellen Burstyn or Norma Rae did for Sally Field, giving her a platform to be her best and biggest self.</p>

<p>Working through a succession of wardrobe changes to rival a pop star’s arena show, Roberts plays Brockovich as a casual-Friday provocateur who uses plunging necklines and miniskirts to terrorize her adversaries. And if that’s not enough to intimidate them, she backs it up with salty invective. As the film opens, she’s an unemployed single mother of three who’s trying to fake her way through job interviews, confident enough that her work ethic and people skills will allow her to learn on the fly. When her attempt to get legal restitution for a car accident doesn’t pan out, Brockovich simply turns up at her lawyer’s office and bullies him into giving her a job.</p>
<p>The bulk of Erin Brockovich is about the class-action lawsuit she and the lawyer, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), bring against Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) for contaminating the groundwater of its plant in Hinkley, California, with a chemical called hexavalent chromium. Through her initiative and drive, she picks up a client base plagued by medical problems and shimmies her way through the county water board offices to find the damning files to prove that PG&amp;E acted with deliberate malice. She also dates a biker (Aaron Eckhart) next door. His name is George. He watches her kids.</p>
<p>As written by Susannah Grant, Erin Brockovich seems deliberate in turning George into the type of perfunctory romantic partner that’s common in films where men are out doing something important and the women are left to complain about their absence. Grant and Roberts turn Brockovich into the type of person who has been wronged so often that she’s always spoiling for a fight, especially when she identifies other underdogs in need of an ally. It takes time for Masry to see that this steamroller can be of use to him – at least when he’s not being flattened by it – and the two become a wonderful pair, the modest old legal hand and brassy go-getter who shakes him out of complacency.</p>

<p>With this film and Traffic the same year, Soderbergh would prove to be a master at connecting the dots without making it seem like an information dump. In Erin Brockovich, Roberts is the spoonful of sugar that makes the medicine go down: as we learn about different types of chromium, the range of medical abnormalities, and the ins and outs of real estate documents and toxicology reports, she’s ripping some poor suit with invective or using her body as a diversionary tactic. It never feels difficult to sort through the facts – and, more crucially, the emotional stakes of the case are never lost in them. That’s Brockovich’s gift. And that’s Roberts’, too.</p>
<p>The lightness of Erin Brockovich is the reason why one of the biggest hits of Soderbergh’s career, topped only by Ocean’s Eleven the next year, succeeds but it does rob the film of a more serious sense of purpose. Soderbergh cares about the harms of corporate malfeasance, as he has proved multiple times since, but this isn’t an angry film like Todd Haynes’ recent Dark Waters, which views a similar case of water-poisoning as a much darker statement on how government and big business treats ordinary people. It says something that Erin Brockovich ends with its hero getting a $2m bonus check – hers is the most important triumph, and the justice she gets for hundreds of others is merely the vessel for it. Anger is a burden that Brockovich alleviates for her clients, and all that’s left is the winning.

<h3 id="erin-brockovich-why-fire-victims-should-accept-pge-settlement">Erin Brockovich: Why fire victims should accept PG&amp;E settlement</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/11/33/35/19248968/5/rawImage.jpg" alt="img">
A quarter century ago, I worked to achieve justice for residents of the Mojave Desert town of Hinkley who got sick after PG&amp;E dumped chromium-6 into their water. When we won those folks $333 million, Julia Roberts made a movie about it: “Erin Brockovich.” I later went on to fight PG&amp;E for damages caused by its Kettleman Hills Compressor Station in Kings County, and residents there settled for $335 million. Later PG&amp;E paid $565 million to the victims of its San Bruno pipeline explosion in 2010 and was convicted in federal court of felonies.</p>
<p>PG&amp;E is a convicted felon, a bad company that needed to be punished.</p>
<p>When PG&amp;E started the Butte Fire in 2015, killing two and burning 475 residences, I boiled with anger. So, I traveled to Sonoma County countless times to meet with victims of the 2017 North Bay fires, where PG&amp;E’s equipment killed 44 people and burned down 8,900 homes and buildings, and again to Butte County many times since late 2018 after the Camp Fire there killed 85 people and burned down almost 19,000 homes and buildings. My goal was simple — I wanted every person who was a victim of fires caused by PG&amp;E to be paid in full by the company that destroyed their homes, forever changing their lives.</p>
<p>I watched carefully as PG&amp;E initially dodged responsibility, predictably fought the lawsuits, and sought immunity in our state Capitol for the damage it caused. When that didn’t work, PG&amp;E sought protection in bankruptcy court.</p>
<p>I joined those people in Sacramento, protesting against PG&amp;E’s bill in 2018 that was designed to eliminate “inverse condemnation.” And the people of California won. After PG&amp;E started the Camp Fire, I demanded a criminal investigation that then took place. This week, PG&amp;E pleaded guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter.</p>
<p>But I have also seen something else — the people of the state of California stood up to this corporate bully and said “no more!” Gov. Gavin Newsom said “Not on my watch!” The California Public Utilities Commission has demanded and achieved a massive overhaul of this company’s culture. The bankruptcy judge made it clear that the victims must be fully paid before it could exit from bankruptcy. And all this pressure has led to a complete win by the people of this state against what was a really, really bad company.</p>
<p>Why — after 25 years — do I believe that this time will be different? Because old PG&amp;E has been shown the door. Those owning the company have been replaced by new investors, not involved before these fires. The governor demanded a refreshment of the board of directors of PG&amp;E for the second time in two years to ensure that the distorted culture of PG&amp;E is repaired for good. The chief executive officer? Replaced! Not enough tree trimmers? PG&amp;E is now under the thumb of a federal judge requiring that thousands of tree trimmers work around the clock to reduce wildfire risk. Unilateral control over how much is spent on safety? No more! Newsom wisely insisted on safety benchmarks, which if not met will lead to a loss of PG&amp;E’s license. And this company’s reign of safety terror over our state is now over.</p>
<p>So why do I advocate that wildfire victims accept the $13.5 billion settlement? Because it is one of the largest settlements in history, providing the money needed to rebuild your homes and your communities now. Because there is no other deal available. Because the owners, directors and officers of the old company are gone, and because the new company is now compelled to safely deliver electricity to the good people of California. Fire victims should vote “yes” to accept this settlement, and rebuild now. And if the new company somehow messes up in the future? The people will rise up again, and I’ll be standing with them fighting to make them pay.</p>
<p>Erin Brockovich is a consumer advocate and environmental activist.

<h3 id="erin-brockovich-20-years-later-i-see-so-many-of-us-finding-that-courage-to-stand-up">&lsquo;Erin Brockovich,&rsquo; 20 Years Later: &lsquo;I See So Many of Us Finding That Courage to Stand Up&rsquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2020/03/erin_brockovich_-_h_-_2000.jpg" alt="img">
The activist who inspired Steven Soderbergh&rsquo;s 2000 drama reflects on its legacy amid current crises as citizens &ldquo;no longer have the comfort to believe an agency has our back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amid a coronavirus pandemic, the harrowing outlook of climate change and the rollback of Environmental Protection Agency guidelines, Erin Brockovich may be just as resonant today if not more so than when it was released two decades ago on March 17, 2000. And the activist herself keeps fighting the good fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were somehow convinced that our voice wasn’t going to matter, or we felt silenced or not heard,&rdquo; Brockovich recalls to The Hollywood Reporter of her work to help spotlight a utility’s poisoning of residents in California’s Mojave Desert.</p>
<p>The twice-divorced mother of three, with no formal legal education, was instrumental in the class-action lawsuit against the Pacific Gas and Electric Company in 1993. The lawsuit exposed that the company had been leading toxic chemicals into the groundwater in Hinkley, California. In 1996, the investor-owned utility paid $333 million to the residents of the tiny desert community — the largest settlement the company had paid out for an environmental lawsuit.</p>
<p>Since then, Brockovich has sensed a shift in the culture concerning the environment. &ldquo;That’s what the past 20 years has kind of been. From so many young girls saying, &lsquo;I loved the film. It inspired me to go to law school. It inspired me to get involved in environmental policy,'&rdquo; Brockovich says. &ldquo;About 99 percent of the time, it’s the mothers. They are actually getting things done in their own city council, in their own backyard. They no longer have the comfort to believe an agency has our back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because she spent so much time in Hinkley examining the water supply, Brockovich got sick during the time of the lawsuit. There are scenes in the film in which her character seems to have the flu, though a sequence shot in the hospital was ultimately cut. &ldquo;My white [blood cell] count was dropping dramatically,&rdquo; she explains. &ldquo;My immune system was failing.&rdquo; And she has yet to get her white count tested. &ldquo;I still worry about it today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Produced by Jersey Films (Danny DeVito, Michael Shamberg, Stacey Sher), directed by Steven Soderbergh and penned by Susannah Grant, Erin Brockovich starred Julia Roberts as the environmental activist and consumer advocate.</p>
<p>But Erin Brockovich may not have made it to the big screen without a story-savvy chiropractor telling patient Carla Santos Shamberg — the wife of producer Michael Shamberg — about the activist who was also a patient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly, without Carla it wouldn’t have happened,&rdquo; notes Sher, whose latest production is the upcoming FX on Hulu series Mrs. America. &ldquo;Carla’s chiropractor literally said, &lsquo;I know this woman and her life would make an incredible movie,'&rdquo; she recalls. &ldquo;So, part of the miracle of this is Carla meeting Erin and instantly recognizing how extraordinary Erin was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We think of her as such a superhero,&rdquo; Sher says. &ldquo;It’s easy to forget how vulnerable she was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact, Sher notes, the trait was the key to portraying Brockovich. &ldquo;I was really struck by the story she told me about how she discovered [the contamination on Hinkley]. She’s dyslexic and was worried she was going to file something wrong and was going through everything really carefully and then started finding these medical records and trying to figure out why there were medical records in real estate files. She started asking questions because she’s so bright and cares so much. I think she said to me once, &lsquo;I always felt destined to do something. I just didn’t know what it was.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>Screenwriter Grant recalls that at this time in Brockovich’s life, &ldquo;she has just as many weaknesses as she has strengths. What I kind of loved about her was the moment in her life in which so many calamities which had been a liability to her in other situations — her relentlessness, her inability to take no for an answer; suddenly, they were exactly what was needed.”</p>
<p>The screenwriter spent time with Brockovich while developing the film. &ldquo;At that time in her life, she was doing a lot of driving around in that area because there were other claims that were going on. She was driving back and forth and visiting with people. I would just ride along and had a tape recorder going the whole time,&rdquo; Grant says. &ldquo;She introduced me to a number of the people who had been plaintiffs in the case — all of whom had gag orders based on their settlements. What was wonderful was that Erin in her wisdom early on before the gag order been imposed had done videotape interviews with the plaintiffs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon its initial March 2000 release, Erin Brockovich received favorable notices from critics. &ldquo;More akin to Silkwood or Norma Rae, the film zeroes in on a woman&rsquo;s voyage of self-discovery brought about by a passionate conviction that a serious wrong must be righted,&rdquo; read THR&rsquo;s review at the time. The film went on to earn $256.3 million globally and five Oscar nominations, including best film, director, screenplay, supporting actor for Albert Finney (who played Erin’s boss, lawyer Ed Masry) and best actress for Roberts. In addition to claiming the Oscar, Roberts also won the SAG Award, Golden Globe and BAFTA for her performance as the most unlikely heroine who was outspoken, passionate, had a penchant for R-rated words and dressed in the shortest of skirts and the lowest cut of blouses.</p>
<p>Brockovich gets emotional when she talks about Masry, who died in 2005. &ldquo;Ed was incredible,&rdquo; she notes. &ldquo;He allowed me to do me and didn’t stifle that. He said &lsquo;No, I think she’s on to something and I’m going to support that.&rsquo; We did everything together. Those were some of the best times in my life. He had a great sense of humor. He understood people. He was OK to learn something from me and we learned from each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pauses. &ldquo;He was always the best,&rdquo; Brockovich says softly. &ldquo;I was holding his hand with his son and his wife when he passed. One of the best friends I ever had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides lecturing about the environment, Brockovich is planing an upcoming podcast, a pilot at ABC called Rebel, which is inspired by her life, and a new book due in August titled Superman Is Not Coming. She also is a popular fixture on the lecture circuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It starts as a child because I’m dyslexic,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Dyslexics are smart but because I was different, I was put in a box. It was a judgment. It was the perception you can’t dare to be different. When I started my work in Hinkley, I was relieved because I realized I wasn’t alone. They, too, were being pushed on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brockovich remembers being told, &ldquo;You’re not a doctor or lawyer or scientist. You’re a single mom.&rdquo; She responds, &ldquo;&lsquo;What? Where do you even think that I have to be any of that to be a human and tell you what I see is not right?&rsquo; That’s where I came from and I continue to be the same today. I see so many of us finding that courage to stand up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She describes Grant and Soderbergh as visionaries. &ldquo;They just get the importance and value and the protection that we should have of the environment, how we need to find our voices and how we need to fight for it,&rdquo; Brockovich notes.</p>
<p>Sher notes that Soderbergh took a chance on the directing style on Erin Brockovich. &ldquo;He said at one point, &lsquo;I’m going to shoot this like a Ken Loach film, really naturalistic,'&rdquo; she notes. &ldquo;&lsquo;So, you can forget that you’re watching that biggest movie star in the world.’ And we&rsquo;re like, &lsquo;That is brilliant. We’re all in on that, just don’t tell the studio.'&rdquo;
