When European settlers arrived in North America, they were stunned to discover a gorgeous parrot.</p>
<p>The face of the Carolina parakeet was red; its head was yellow, its wings green. Measuring a foot or more from beak to tail, the parakeets thrived in noisy flocks from the Atlantic Coast to what is now Oklahoma.</p>
<p>“I have seen branches of trees as completely covered by them as they could possibly be,” John James Audubon wrote in 1830. When the parrots landed on a farmer’s field, “they present to the eye the same effect as if a brilliantly coloured carpet had been thrown over them.”</p>
<p>Within a century, the Carolina parakeet was gone. In 1918, the last captive died in a Cincinnati zoo. After a few possible sightings in the wild, the species was declared extinct.</p>
<p>Today, scientists are left with little information about the bird. But now a team of researchers has sequenced the genome of a specimen that died a century ago. The genome offers clues to how the Carolina parakeet became America’s native parrot millions of years ago, and how it disappeared.

MONDAY PUZZLE — It’s interesting to observe the evolution of a crossword puzzle. Occasionally, an idea might come pouring out of a constructor’s brain in stellar condition, like one of Mozart’s works, but most of the time, puzzle makers spend hours polishing their opuses. That means moving black squares around, hopefully dropping entries or even entire sections that obstruct the build, filtering word lists for crackling entries and rewriting clues.</p>
<p>Eight New York Times constructors gave readers a peek at this process in our “How to Make a Crossword Puzzle” series.</p>
<p>And while Monday puzzles are made to be the most straightforward crosswords of the week (I hesitate to use the word “easy,” because nothing is easy to a beginner, and much respect to them), you might be surprised to learn that they can be some of the hardest to construct. The vocabulary and the cluing must work together to get solvers from point A to point B using the shortest route possible. The theme should be polished until it glitters.</p>
<p>It’s even better when the solve is smooth, which means — to me, at least — that working the puzzle feels as if you touch your pencil or pen to paper and don’t stop writing until the grid is complete. Substitute “typing” for “pencil or pen” if you solve online or in the app. There’s an odd satisfaction to a puzzle like that. You almost feel as if you are reading and sussing out the next clue while you’re still writing in the current one, and that one leads to the next until you’re done. It’s the closest I’ve come to feeling psychic, and that’s what veteran solvers mean when they talk about “being on the constructor’s wavelength.”

New Zealand today is home to a number of physically impressive parrots. Kakapo, the heaviest psittacines alive, are too chubby to fly. Sharp-beaked keas are strong enough to attack sheep and yank rubber parts off cars.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, though, there was a prehistoric Polly in New Zealand who had them all beat. This bruiser of a bird — whose discovery was announced Wednesday in Biology Letters — was perhaps three feet tall. At about 15.4 pounds, it was as heavy as some bowling balls, and twice as massive as the kakapo, which had previously held the record. That’s a lot of crackers.</p>
<p>“To have a parrot that big is surprising,” said Trevor Worthy, a vertebrate paleontologist at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia and the paper’s lead author. “This thing was way outside of expectations.”</p>
<p>[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]</p>
<p>The parrot’s bones were found near St Bathans on New Zealand’s South Island, where fossil deposits are filled with creatures from the early Miocene, a period that spanned 19 million to 16 million years ago.

<h3 id="meet-squawkzilla-the-massive-prehistoric-parrot-scientists-say-terrorized-other-birds">&ldquo;Meet ‘Squawkzilla,’ the massive prehistoric parrot scientists say terrorized other birds&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AQUOCLVYXMI6TDUDJZTIP2MYCQ.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
Scientists have been finding enormous prehistoric birds for years, but this one still shocked them. It’s the largest parrot ever known to have walked the Earth. It might have even preyed on other birds.</p>
<p>At an estimated 15 pounds, the now extinct bird beats out all the other parrot competitors, at nearly double the weight of the endangered kakapo, New Zealand’s reigning giant parrot.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The scientists approximated its size based on two leg bones, called tibiotarsi, under the assumption that they both came from the same bird.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The fossils were dug up in 2008 in St. Bathans, New Zealand, in a massive fossil deposit that was once a prehistoric lake, where a team of paleontologists go every year to collect bones.</p>
<p>“My guess is, at the best of times, you could barely see the lake for all the birds that were sitting on it,” Michael Archer, a co-author of the research and paleontologist at the University of New South Wales, told The Washington Post.</p>
<p>The large bones, believed to be those of an ancient eagle, flew under the radar for a decade. It was during a research project in the lab of Flinders University paleontologist Trevor Worthy that a graduate student rediscovered the bones. The student wanted to look at old eagle bones and quickly realized these did not fit the bill. After that, a team of researchers began reanalyzing the findings earlier this year.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The researchers compared the drumstick-like bones to bird skeletons in the South Australian Museum collection and the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History’s electronic collection. They wanted to see if the remains matched any earlier descriptions of an existing bird species.</p>
<p>“Then, by elimination, we concluded that there was nothing left, and it had all the features of a parrot,” Worthy said. “And while no parrot had ever been found this big, it had to be a parrot.”</p>
<p>The bird probably lived during the Early Miocene, which spanned from about 23 million to 16 million years ago.</p>
<p>Researchers concluded that the bird probably couldn’t fly and consumed what was along the ground and easy to reach, like berries, nuts and seeds, Worthy said.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>But that might not have been enough to satiate the giant parrot.</p>
<p>It’s possible the bird had more carnivorous ways, like another New Zealand parrot, the kea, which has been known to attack and subsequently munch upon living sheep if they are stuck in the snow. They can also dig up sea birds from their burrows and eat the chicks, according to Worthy.</p>
<p>Heracles might have even been eating other parrots, Archer said, giving way to a nickname: “Squawkzilla.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Though researchers do not have the bird’s beak, Archer said he suspects it was large and ferocious. If the bird’s skull is found, scientists will be able to tell whether it had a beak for nuts and seeds, or one for chomping down on other, smaller birds.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Heracles won’t be the final unforeseen fossil from the area. Archer said the team has also found evidence of long-extinct bats, crocodiles and other birds in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“One of the nice aspects of paleontology is how much of what happens depends on serendipity,” Archer said.</p>
<p>There are probably thousands more fossils waiting to be discovered, which will offer clues into who and what used to roam the planet.

<p>… and STRAPPERS certainly are big lads. But they haven’t always been; here’s the start of a poem from 1839 that appears to be by John Hughes:</p>
<p>from The Three Literary Graces: A Rhapsody</p>
<p>Indeed, the further back you go, “strapping” is used more and more of lasses rather than lads – and originally only of lasses. It is since the first world war that STRAPPERS have been primarily male:</p>
<p>Usage of “strapping lass” v “strapping lad” in Google’s corpus</p>
<p>The subject of our next challenge has gone in the other direction. Here is an entry from the 1696 dictionary, The New World of Words:</p>
<p>Coquet</p>
<p>an Amorous Courtier, one that makes it his business to cause himself to be belov’d, and gain the love of Women</p>
<p>Flash forward to the 1720s, and in The Beggar’s Opera, John Gay is keen to stress that women can also cause themselves to be belov’d …</p>
<p>The Coquets of both Sexes are Self-lovers, and that is a Love no other whatever can dispossess.</p>
<p>… and before long, the men are referred to as “male coquets”, “male coquettes”, then … not at all. So, reader: how would you clue the problematic term we’re left with, COQUETTE?</p>
<p>Cluing competition</p>
<p>Thanks for your clues for CAPER. Zedible gets the audacity award for “About. About. About. About. Skip. Back.

And staying with crosswords about crosswords, Lizard tips a hat to Arthur Wynne in “Origins of crossword – American paper’s editor reinventing ‘Fun’”.</p>
<p>Respect to everyone attempting a carrollism/portmanteau, especially in the case of PeterMooreFuller’s “Cayenne pepper, according to Carroll, is good on pizza”.</p>
<p>The runners-up are DeetotheGee’s snappy “Carry On Doctor recap” and PeterMooreFuller’s plausible “Bound to find parrot in Costa Rica”; the winner is Patjberry’s misleading-but-fair “Leaders of church raging about primate’s highjinks”.</p>
