BROOKINGS – Tim Reed has announced his intention to seek re-election to the South Dakota House of Representatives in Legislative District 7.</p>
<p>“It has been an honor to serve in the South Dakota House of Representatives. I hope to continue advocating for the citizens of District 7 and positively affecting policies for all citizens of South Dakota,” Reed said. “The coronavirus pandemic will put economic and social burdens on our lives, I will use my 17 years of experience in public service to make sure South Dakota recovers as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>Reed is completing his second term in office. He is a member of the House Taxation and Local Government committees. He served on the 2018 Access to Mental Health Care Services Study and chaired the 2019 Increase Community Services and Caregivers Supports Task Force. In 2019, he also served on the Electric Services in an Annexed Area Interim Study as a voice for communities with municipal electric service.</p>
<p>Appointed by Chief Justice David Gilbertson, Reed serves on the Drug Court Advisory Council. He also serves on the Criminal Justice System Response to Mental Health Oversight Council for the Unified Judicial System. In 2019, he was appointed to the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education Legislative Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>Reed represents South Dakota on the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board and is currently serving on the executive board. The Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board works with members of the business community, state legislatures, and tax administrators to simplify and modernize the sales and use tax systems throughout the country to help make the collection of remote taxes as simple and burden-free as possible, while at the same time protecting state sovereignty.</p>
<p>“During the past four years in the Legislature, I’ve been able to effectively serve District 7 and South Dakota through pragmatic legislative activity and serving on governing boards, study committees, task forces, and advisory committees,” he said.</p>
<p>Reed was active with city and county government, South Dakota State University, mental healthcare, sex trafficking, and sexual assault victim assistance bills. He sponsored and successfully passed bills lengthening the time anonymous forensic sexual assault evidence kits are stored, allowing school, city and county governing boards to go into executive session to discuss security plans, and providing for a resident of a mental health care treatment facility to designate a caregiver to receive information regarding their care.</p>
<p>Reed, a Republican, has served District 7 for four legislative sessions. Before serving in the Legislature, he served in Brookings city government for 13 years, including three terms as mayor. He is a graduate of SDSU with a degree in commercial economics. After graduation, Reed worked in supply chain planning, information technology, and college development.</p>
<p>Primary races</p>
<p>There will be a Republican primary election June 2 for the District 7 race for state House of Representatives. Having filed petitions are incumbents Reed and Doug Post along with former lawmaker Larry Tidemann.</p>
<p>The two winning Republican candidates will face Democrats Bill Adamson and Louise Snodgrass, both of Brookings, in the November election for two District 7 House seats.</p>
<p>A Republican primary is also needed in the Brookings County Commission race for two open seats. In the running are Shawn Hostler and incumbents Mike Bartley and Ryan Krogman. No other candidates have filed for the posts.</p>
<p>No primaries in some races</p>
<p>Only one candidate has filed for the state Senate races in both districts 4 and 7. Incumbents John Wiik and V.J. Smith, both Republicans, have filed for re-election.</p>
<p>There is also no primary needed for the District 4 House race. In the running are Democrat Becky Holtquist of Milbank and Republican incumbents Fred Deutsch of Florence and John Mills of Volga. They will face off in November for the two District 4 House seats.</p>
<p>And incumbent Dan Nelson, a Republican, is so far the only candidate for Brookings County state’s attorney.</p>
<p>The filing deadline for district and county candidates running with a party affiliation has passed, but independent candidates have until 5 p.m. April 28 to file nominating petitions.</p>
<p>Legislative posts have two-year terms, and the county seats have four-year terms.</p>
<p>South Dakota’s Primary Election will be on June 2, with polls open from 7 a.m.-7 p.m. Voter registration deadline is May 18, and absentee voting begins April 17.</p>
<p>The 2020 General Election will be on Nov. 3. Voter registration for this election is due Oct. 19, and absentee voting begins on Sept. 18.</p>

Despite Outbreak, South Dakota Governor Hesitant To Issue Stay-At-Home Order</p>
<p>Enlarge this image toggle caption Jabin Botsford/Getty Images Jabin Botsford/Getty Images</p>
<p>Despite pleas from cities across the state, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican, has held out on issuing a statewide stay-at-home order to slow the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>An outbreak of COVID-19 at Smithfield Foods in Sioux Falls, S.D., has infected nearly 450 workers and caused the number of cases the city to grow so quickly that the mayor, Paul TenHaken, calls it an explosion. &ldquo;The window of time for mitigation is certainly dwindling right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smithfield Foods is shutting its doors indefinitely and TenHaken is asking for a shelter-in-place order from the state. By law, it would take Sioux Falls a week to enact an ordinance on its own, but he says the city is pursing that if all else fails.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our time to act on this is right now,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>But Gov. Noem — an ally of President Trump — has been hesitant to issue a shelter-in-place or statewide stay-at-home order. Instead, she says she&rsquo;s taking a &ldquo;targeted&rdquo; approach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been very clear about the fact that I don&rsquo;t think decisions for Sioux Falls are the same decisions that are correct and right for a town like Faith, South Dakota, or Lemmon, South Dakota,&rdquo; Noem says.</p>
<p>Neil Pinnow is the mayor of Lemmon, a small city that borders North Dakota on the western side of the state. He says their nearest hospital is 25 miles away and serves small communities in both North and South Dakota.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They get 50 people that are hospitalized with this, they&rsquo;re going to be full,&rdquo; Pinnow says. &ldquo;The doctors and nurses over there are going to be overrun. Then what are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And if that hospital is overrun, Pinnow says next closest one is 140 miles away in Bismarck, N.D.</p>
<p>Pinnow is trying to make decisions without a lot of direction from the state or the Department of Health, and says more guidance and help would be &ldquo;appreciated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So far, Gov. Noem has put out an executive order that says people &ldquo;shall&rdquo; follow guidance from the Centers For Disease Control. She says that guidance directs businesses how to operate if they want to keep their doors open.</p>
<p>And in two of the South Dakota&rsquo;s 66 counties, Noem has ordered all people over the age of 65 to stay home.</p>
<p>But she has continually pushed back on the idea of a stay-at-home order saying that it would flatten the curve so much that she would have to keep it in place until October to be effective. It is unclear what models the governor is using to make that prediction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re allowing people to mix within an establishment—essentially interact—then the virus is going to spread,&rdquo; says Drew Harris — a population health researcher at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. He says Noem&rsquo;s approach may not accomplish what the state hopes it will.</p>
<p>Numbers in South Dakota are relatively low right now, but Harris says without stronger mitigation, cases could rapidly increase.</p>
<p>He likens the epidemic to a prairie wildfire and a stay-at-home order to a fire break intended to suppress the flame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You always know that some embers are going to jump over the fire break that starts new fires. But they&rsquo;re much more manageable and you just put out those hot spots one at a time,&rdquo; Harris adds.</p>
<p>Noem does have another idea for combating the coronavirus, though. She says she spent the last week urging the White House Coronavirus Task Force to allow South Dakota to begin a statewide trial of hydroxychloroquine — a drug touted by the Trump administration as a potential therapy for COVID-19.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This would be the first-ever state-endorsed, state-backed, statewide clinical trial available in the United States,&rdquo; Noem says.</p>
<p>But in what little research has been done on the drug to treat the coronavirus, there have been no reported results. Despite that, Noem says the trial will put the state on offense against the pandemic.

<h3 id="south-dakota-to-begin-clinical-trials-for-hydroxychloroquine-as-coronavirus-treatment">South Dakota To Begin Clinical Trials For Hydroxychloroquine As Coronavirus Treatment</h3>
<p><img src="https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-13-at-3.08.15-PM.png" alt="img">
South Dakota Republican Gov. Kristi Noem announced Monday that her state would be the first to begin a statewide clinical trial for the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment for the novel Wuhan coronavirus sweeping the globe.</p>
<p>“From day one, I’ve said we’re going to let the science, facts, and data drive our decision-making,” Noem told Fox News in a statement.</p>
<p>The announcement comes days after talks with the White House where Noem told administration officials “that South Dakota’s medical community was ready to step up and lead the way on research efforts.”</p>
<p>Noem said she made “direct requests” to the president to provide “enough hydroxychloroquine so that it could be made available for every hospitalized person the state may have, as well as those for health care workers on the frontlines and those in the most vulnerable populations,” according to Fox.</p>
<p>“Today, I’m pleased to report we have received the initial doses we need, and thanks to the leadership of Sanford Health and the assistance of medical teams at Avera and Monument Health, we’re going to be the first state in the nation to do a comprehensive clinical trial to assess whether hydroxychloroquine can treat and perhaps even prevent COVID-19,” the governor told Fox.</p>
<p>Trump derangement syndrome turned the malaria medicine controversial last month when President Donald Trump touted the drug’s potential effectiveness in the battle against the coronavirus with very few negative side effects.</p>
<p>“It’s been around for a long time, so we know if things don’t go as planned, it’s not going to kill anybody,” Trump said during a White House press briefing.</p>
<p>Days later, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug for treatment in coronavirus-infected patients, and after media vilification of Trump’s comments pinning the tragic death of an uninfected man who ingested fish-tank cleaner in the absence of medical guidance on the president, the New York Times conceded that the medicine “helped speed the recovery in moderately ill patients.”</p>
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) announced last week that clinical trials had begun on a smaller scale last week among 500 patients hospitalized or in emergency rooms anticipating hospitalization over the virus in Tennessee.</p>
<p>Dr. Anthony Fauci of the White House coronavirus task force team has maintained that health care providers should use caution when considering the drug as COVID-19 treatment.</p>
<p>“We still need to do the definitive studies to determine whether any intervention, not just this one, is truly safe and effective,” Fauci said on Fox News.
