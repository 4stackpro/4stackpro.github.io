I have a love/hate relationship with Ozark. On the plus side, the Netflix crime drama’s ensemble — buoyed by Julia Garner’s breakout, Emmy-winning performance as the ferocious and fierce Ruth Langmore — is an embarrassment of prestige TV riches. On the down side, the series’ frustrating tendency to prioritize plot over character regularly undermines the emotional stakes and reduces potentially interesting and complex characters to one-dimensional pawns in what can feel like a contrived version of Breaking Bad.</p>
<p>Ozark infuriates me while simultaneously entertaining me and I resent it but I also kind of admire it.</p>
<p>For example, Marylouise Burke is an absolute hoot in the just-dropped third season as Marty and Wendy’s morally flexible marriage counselor Sue. And the show does a masterful job of creating a wholly unique character filled with hilarious and endearing contradictions. But there is absolutely no plausible explanation for why Dr. Sue would show up at the Byrde’s house unannounced to “check in on them.” None whatsoever.</p>
<p>The story, however, demanded that the couple’s quasi crime boss Helen not only meet their shrink but witness her driving a brand new mustard-yellow McLaren because how else would Helen realize the doc had been compromised and needed to die? As a result, Sue’s eventual murder packed nary a punch because the strings the writers pulled to get us from Point A to Point B were visible to the naked eye. Ozark Season 3: The Biggest Twists</p>
<p>This is my long-winded way of saying I breezed through all 10 of Season 3’s intermittently flawed, occasionally inspired episodes and promptly jotted down the 15 moments that caused my jaw to drop (sometimes while my eyes rolled). Scroll throw the gallery above — or click here for direct access — and riddle me this in the comments: Which of Season 3’s big developments shocked and awed you?

<h3 id="ozark-season-3-fans-react-to-an-unexpected-and-uncomfortable-new-relationship">‘Ozark’ Season 3: Fans React to an ‘Unexpected’ and ‘Uncomfortable’ New Relationship</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Wyatt-Darlene-Ozark-640x427.jpg" alt="img">
In Season 3 of Ozark, an unexpected relationship formed that made some viewers uncomfortable. Others believe they understand what’s happening, and think both parties are potentially “playing the long game.”</p>
<p>Cast of Ozark | Emma McIntyre</p>
<p>[SPOILER ALERT: This article contains information revealed in Ozarks Season 3 Episode 5.]</p>
<p>Wyatt and Darlene get into a sexual relationship in ‘Ozark’ Season 3</p>
<p>In Ozark Season 3, Wyatt (Charlie Tahan) refuses to talk to his cousin, Ruth (Julia Garner), after he finds out that she killed his dad and uncle. He begins breaking and entering to support himself before a homeowner caught him and called the cops.</p>
<p>The smart local refused to take Ruth’s money, so he stayed in jail. Darlene (Lisa Emery) overheard Ruth yelling to her cousin at the station, and decided to bail him out herself.</p>
<p>The widow, who raised Zeke as her own and sold goods at a local market, asked for Wyatt to help her with the farm as payback. He agreed, and the two eventually began a sexual relationship.</p>

<p>Wyatt stood by Darlene and testified at a hearing against the Byrds so that Zeke could remain in their custody. He then invited his younger brother to stay with them and also help out with the farm. Additionally, Wyatt later revealed he fell in love with her.</p>
<p>By the end of the series, Darlene, who replanted her poppy fields, recruited Ruth, who quit Byrd Enterprises, and the Kansas City Mob, who Marty Byrd (Jason Bateman) cut ties with, alongside Wyatt and his brother to distribute her heroin.</p>
<p>Many fans find Wyatt and Darlene’s relationship disgusting and uncomfortable</p>
<p>After watching the episode where Wyatt and Darlene had sex, many fans took to social media to share their reaction to the unexpected relationship. One Reddit user called it “f*****g disgusting” and admitted they felt “wildly uncomfortable” watching the intimate scene.</p>
<p>Others didn’t understand why the writers made their relationship sexual, and feel like it’s “set up to emphasize how the Snells and Langmores are the weird a*s inbred hillbilly type” as well as the “locals vs. outsiders” storyline “they’ve set up for the next season.”</p>
<p>Some believe Wyatt and Darlene should have had a mother/son relationship as opposed to lovers because he has “mommy issues,” and the widow “always wanted children.”</p>
<p>Another viewer agreed and shared they “thought when she bailed him out, she would turn him into the new Ash.” They believe that storyline “would have been less creepy” and “more interesting” because viewers would learn more about Ash without having to flashback.</p>
<p>Additionally, many fans don’t understand why Wyatt cut Ruth off “yet fell in love with Darlene, who admitted she killed her husband.”</p>
<p>Other fans understand why Wyatt and Darlene became involved</p>
<p>Other users understand why the unexpected relationship formed and believe they are both “playing the long game.” One viewer noted that “Wyatt is a young Marty” as he’s “the most book smart of the locals and has the same street smarts as Ruth.”</p>
<p>The user continued, “Right now, he’s looking to be cared for and is upset over his dad being killed by a family member.” Therefore, they believe Wyatt could “wind up in charge of it all” when everything is said and done.</p>
<p>Another user noted that no one should be surprised by Darlene “seducing” the young local because she’s done it before. As the fan recalled, Jacob shared how he and Darlene met and explained, “another chick was flirting with him” at the time.</p>

<p>But Darlene “scooted her out of the way and bulldozed Jacob.” The user feels that the now widow was charming “back in the day and still carries that attitude.” Therefore, it “was easy to seduce” an angry, confused, frustrated, and lost Wyatt, who was looking for “stability and comfort,” which he found in Darlene.</p>
<p>One fan believes everyone will understand the “general grooming and manipulation by Darlene” by the end of the series as “the woman we thought was just bats**t insane turns out to have a master plan in play.”</p>
<p>Regardless, with the way Darlene singlehandedly assembled a new crew by the end of the series, the Byrds are in for a rude awakening once they return from Mexico.

<p><img src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/750x445/1262003.jpg" alt="img">
Season three of Ozark ended with some big moments and a huge power shift, which will see Marty Byrde (played by Jason Bateman) and his wife Wendy (Laura Linney) face new danger. But what happened at the end of the latest series?</p>
<p>Trending</p>
<p>What happened at the end of Ozark season 3? WARNING: This article contains spoilers from Ozark season 3 There were some major developments at the close of season three, which set the stage up nicely for a potential fourth outing. Netflix has yet to renew Ozark for season four and a recommission will be based on viewer figures. Much like Steven Knight and Peaky Blinders, Ozark creator and showrunner Chris Mundy rarely takes his show in a predictable direction. Consequently, the new series could take a completely fresh trajectory with the cliff-hanger ending of the third outing only have some baring on the plot.

<p>READ MORE Ozark season 3 cast: Who is in the cast of Ozark? Helen Pierce was killed by Navarro The big moment in the final scene saw cartel lawyer Helen Pierce (Janet McTeer) getting killed by one of Omar Navarro’s (Felix Solis) men. Helen, Marty and Wendy had flown to Mexico after Navarro summoned them there supposedly for his new-born son’s second baptism after the first one turned into a bloodbath. The lawyer’s death was foreshadowed by scenes right in episode one after Helen was tortured when the cartel suspected her husband knew about their business. Throughout the finale, Helen was also making plans to kill the Byrdes and take over their business. However, they were saved by Navarro at the last moment.</p>

<p>Marty and Wendy are working directly for Navarro Navarro hugged Marty and Wendy as they reeled from the shock of Helen’s death, covered in the late attorney’s blood and viscera. The couple are now reporting directly to Navarro and will be getting their hands very dirty indeed. Wendy also outlined plans about ending the war with the Lagunas Cartel by giving evidence to the FBI of members of gang murdering men from the Kansas City Mob on US soil. Much like the Riverboat casino had a huge role this year, season four could see this new dynamic with Navarro developing. DON&rsquo;T MISS&hellip;</p>

<p>Ruth Langmore joins Darlene Snell A furious Ruth Langmore (Julia Garner) joined forces with Darlene Snell (Lisa Emery) after quitting her job with the Byrdes. She was fuming after her boyfriend Ben Davis (Tom Pelphrey) was killed. When she failed to get any answers from Wendy, who blamed her for Ben’s murder, she handed in her notice. Ruth has now teamed up with Darlene, who was already working with her cousin Wyatt Langmore (Chris Tahan), to run the Snell heroin business. Darlene took advantage of the situation and got Ruth on side. She also castrated Frank Cosgrove Jr (Joseph Sikora) for beating up Ruth after Marty had said the youngster was “untouchable”. The KC Mob and Darlene are working together Darlene then went to pacify the KC Mob boss Frank Cosgrove (John Bedford Lloyd) after shooting his son in the groin. She made Frank Sr an offer which would see the KC Mob getting a 50-50 split distributing her heroin. Darlene gave him an additional sweetner by awarding him building contacts for three opioid rehabilitation centres, telling him without a hint of irony in her voice how she wanted to “tackle this plague”. She asked Frank Sr whether he would be willing to take the deal or go to war. Things were left open-ended as the gangster weighed up her proposal.
