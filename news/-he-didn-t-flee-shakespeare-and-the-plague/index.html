During the 16th century, a young couple in Stratford-upon-Avon, England, lost two of their children to the bubonic plague.</p>
<p>The pair barricaded themselves inside to protect their 3-month-old son — William Shakespeare. The legendary playwright’s life was shaped by the plague.</p>
<p>Waves of the bubonic plague killed at least a third of the European population across centuries. A year or so before Shakespeare wrote “Romeo and Juliet,” a powerful plague struck London in 1593.</p>
<p>Theatres closed for 14 months and 10,000 Londoners died, says Columbia University professor and author James Shapiro. In “Romeo and Juliet,” Shakespeare uses the plague as source material.</p>
<p>The play features a scene where Friar John is sent to deliver the message to Romeo about Juliet’s faux death. But the Friar is suspected of being in an infected house and quarantined — making him unable to deliver the message to Romeo.</p>
<p>“That would have been lived experiences for Londoners just coming out of what I hope we&rsquo;ll be coming out of quite soon, but a far more lethal pandemic” than the coronavirus, he says.</p>

<p>This use of the plague is “terrifying” in part because Shakespeare and his fellow playwrights seldom wrote about the subject, Shapiro says.</p>
<p>Now, he predicts artists will write about this pandemic in their diaries and it will take time before people want to go see movies about pandemics again.</p>
<p>“People died in all kinds of ways in Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays. Nobody ever dies of plague. It&rsquo;s just taboo,” he says. “So the few times that he does mention plague, mostly in his tragedies, it hits with incredible force.”</p>
<p>In the early 1600s, more bubonic plague outbreaks struck and shuttered the doors of London’s Globe Theatre. A 1603 outbreak killed over a fifth of Shakespeare’s fellow Londoners and the plague returned again in 1610, he says.</p>
<p>During and after the worst outbreaks of his lifetime, Shakespeare wrote some of his greatest works: “King Lear,” “Macbeth,” “Antony and Cleopatra,” “Coriolanus” and “Timon of Athens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“These plays really bear the mark of living through such a terrible experience,” he says. “And it may well be that his move toward writing tragedy at this time is a kind of response to the tragedy that his society was experiencing in these years.”</p>

<p>In “King Lear,” the title character mentions the plague when cursing his eldest daughter, Shapiro says.</p>
<p>The character King Lear is changed throughout the course of the play. In the end, the ruler acknowledges the suffering of his people and that he hasn’t done enough to take care of them, he says.</p>
<p>“It may be too much to hope that our national leaders and international leaders right now may have a similar response: feel that they, too, have taken too little care of the social problems that are under the magnifying glass right now,” he says.</p>
<p>What strikes Shapiro about Shakespeare and the bubonic plague is the playwright never fled London. He stayed in the city because he understood his job as an artist was to help people come out of difficult periods when the theaters reopened, Shapiro says.</p>
<p>Despite the uncertainty in the theater world right now, Shapiro is sure Shakespeare will still be there when the crisis ends — like he stuck around for the people of London during his lifetime.</p>
<p>“His works were there to give them comfort and clarity,” he says. “I do know that when we come out on the other side of this, we&rsquo;re going to need theater and we&rsquo;re going to need Shakespeare — and it&rsquo;ll be there for us.”</p>

<p><img src="https://www.gpb.org/sites/www.gpb.org/files/blogs/images/2020/04/02/screen_shot_2020-04-02_at_2.11.21_pm.png" alt="img">
Quick, name a play that uses a pandemic and the consequent need for social isolation as a plot twist that leads to tragedy. If you answered Romeo and Juliet, congratulations, you’re right!</p>
<p>For hundreds of years — literally, hundreds of years — students and adults alike have struggled to read Shakespeare’s plays. That’s in large part because he wrote his plays to be seen and heard, not read. Reading Shakespeare is like reading a movie script — something that is written for actors so they learn and then perform the lines for our entertainment. Or, put another way, the score for a song you like is not the actual song — it’s the instructions that musicians use to play the notes in the right sequence, and with the right emphasis.</p>
<p>About six years ago, the folks at WordPlay Shakespeare decided to tackle this problem by filming several of Shakespeare’s plays in their entirety, and then placing the performers “onto the page,” next to The Bard’s words. Now, when you read the play, you can trigger the performers on the righthand “page,” and you can hear and see them performing the lines - their emphasis, their positioning, their inflection, their emotion. Everything comes alive, right next to the words of the play. The team at WordPlay has added modern English translations, modern Spanish translations, glossaries, quiz questions on each page, summaries, and other links and materials to help you work with (and enjoy) Shakespeare’s text.</p>
<p>From a technology perspective, all that’s required is a device that supports a Safari or Chrome browser (even smart phones work) and an internet connection. For the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, WordPlay will provide free licenses to all schools and teachers that request one.

<h3 id="shakespeares-secret-co-writer-finally-takes-a-bow--430-years-late">Shakespeare’s secret co-writer finally takes a bow … 430 years late</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2a8e58113151bfc2eab6011e2b0226934101eab/0_195_3162_1898/master/3162..jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=e4e2cd66e8244faa30d171c89371e77c" alt="img">
He was one of the most celebrated English playwrights of the 16th century, yet none of his plays survived, and today the name of Thomas Watson is virtually unknown. Now the writer, poet and pioneer of the English madrigal – who also saved the life of the playwright Christopher Marlowe in a street brawl – is being seen in a new light.</p>
<p>Watson has been identified as the most likely primary author of Arden of Faversham, the first domestic tragedy in English, which was published anonymously in 1592. Many scholars believe that five of the play’s scenes were co-authored with William Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Based on a notorious murder of 1551, Arden is about a woman from Faversham, Kent, who conspires with her lover to kill her husband and struggles to “wash away this blood”, just like Lady Macbeth.</p>
<p>Over five years of research, Professor Gary Taylor, a leading Shakespeare scholar, has found stylistic, biographical and historical links to Watson in almost every scene. He concludes that there is “strong and consistent evidence” for his authorship.</p>
<p>Watson was a polymath whose talents extended from writing poetry in Latin to creating the first published set of English madrigals. In 1595, Shakespeare was described as “Watson’s heire” by William Clerke, in a work titled Polimanteia, but only recently have scholars even realised that Watson was a playwright.</p>
<p>Watson was greatly admired at the time, celebrated for tragic plays before Marlowe or Shakespeare became famous Gary Taylor, Shakespeare scholar</p>
<p>“Almost everything Watson did was original,” said Taylor, professor of literature at Florida State University and general editor of The New Oxford Shakespeare. “Even specialists only know one tiny aspect of his work, instead of putting it all together.”</p>
<p>Taylor’s new research will be published in The Review of English Studies later this year. He is also among leading contributors to Early Shakespeare, 1588-1594, a major reappraisal of Shakespeare’s early career, to be published this month by Cambridge University Press. This will contain essays on Arden by other scholars.</p>
<p>Dr Rory Loughnane, its co-editor and a senior lecturer at the University of Kent, said: “Taylor’s identification of Watson’s hand in Arden … is a major finding, not least for our understanding of Shakespeare’s early career. Though obscure now, Watson was a polymath and, like his close friend Marlowe, a celebrated poet, translator and dramatist. Watson was also extremely well-connected within London’s literary scene; that he collaborated with Shakespeare, who was then in his mid-20s, reveals the sorts of influential circles the ambitious Stratford man moved in at the very beginning of his career.”</p>
<p>Taylor said: “We’re looking for a writer who is capable of writing a great play. Watson was greatly admired at the time, celebrated for tragic plays before Marlowe or Shakespeare became famous.”</p>
<p>Arden authorship contenders have included Thomas Kyd, who wrote The Spanish Tragedy. Taylor said: “Watson looks more likely than any other writer of the 1580s or early 1590s. As a native Londoner with legal training, born in the 1550s and praised by his contemporaries as an early master of tragedy in the commercial theatres, Watson shares the biographical profile that first led critics to suspect Kyd’s hand in the play.”</p>
<p>He added: “A lot of the material is funny, and Watson … was also famously funny. In 1596, one writer remembered ‘the froth of witty Tom Watson’s jests’.”</p>
<p>Among other biographical evidence, Taylor draws parallels between Arden and Watson’s defence of Marlowe when he was attacked in the street in 1589: “The husband who would be famously murdered is defended by a friend in an earlier attack. That incident in the play is not in the historical sources. It’s totally made up by the playwright. The friend is also totally made up.”</p>
<p>Taylor has compared Arden with Watson’s surviving literary prose and poetry, using databases of playwrights working between 1585 and 1595. The study revealed that “some features of Arden are shared with no one but Watson”.</p>
<p>He added: “If Watson did write most of Arden, then we need to seriously consider him for other plays written before September 1592 when he died, probably of the plague.”
