<p>Welsh singer Charlotte Church had a surprise up her sleeve when she called up a friend during an appearance on a celebrity version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?</p>
<p>When she got stuck on the £32,000 question, she called up a very clever friend - Mark Labbett- who is better known as The Beast on ITV quiz show The Chase.</p>
<p>Charlotte, who admitted she had got really interested in quantum psychics a couple of years ago, got off to a flying start, answering question after question with no problem at all and it seemed she was on to a winner.</p>

<p>However, she got stuck when Jeremy Clarkson asked her: “Which of these publications was discontinued in print form in 2019?”</p>
<p>The choices available to her were the Argos Catalogue, The Independent, Yellow Pages or Beano, and she admitted not knowing the answer.</p>

<p>Using one of her lifelines, the opera star asked Jeremy if she could call on a man she simply named as &ldquo;Mark&rdquo; and when the presenter revealed he was The Beast, there was a big cheer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That’s quite clever,&rdquo; the host remarked, commending the contestant on using a world-renowned quiz master as the person to call on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do know him, he’s my friend I know him from the Robin Hood pub,” Charlotte replied before Mark finally answered the call, but unfortunately he wasn’t of any help to the singer to begin with.</p>
<p>Charlotte&rsquo;s parents ran the pub in Cardiff and Mark said he had known the family for a time.</p>

<p>After being told the questions and the choice of answers by the celebrity, The Chase star told her: &ldquo;I don’t know. It could be Yellow Pages, but that’s a guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following Mark’s efforts to help, Charlotte had to use another lifeline as she asked Jeremy to remove two of the four options.</p>
<p>This left her with Yellow Pages and The Independent, of which the singer then knew which was the correct answer.</p>
<p>Mark had told her during their phone call that The Independent had stopped printing in 2017, meaning the only option to go for was the former.</p>
<p>Charlotte answered a few more questions before hitting another roadblock, at which point she told Jeremy she was going to bow out.</p>
<p>The contestant walked away with a grand sum of £32,00 for her two chosen charities.</p>
<p>She was raising money for The Awen Project, a charity she has set up to build creative schools in the UK, and the Welsh-based Safe Foundation, which provides support for under privileged children around the UK.</p>
<p>The £64,000 question was &lsquo;Where did the 1876 battle often known as Custer&rsquo;s Last Stand?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The choices were Little Bighorn, The Alamo, OK Corral or Gettysberg. Jeremy couldn&rsquo;t help her, so she decided to go home with £32,000.</p>
<p>After making the decision to now go for that answer, he said she would have gone for Little Bighorn which would have been the right answer.

Welsh singer-songwriter Charlotte Church, 34, previously explained what made her former boyfriend Gavin Henson seemingly &ldquo;grow up&rdquo;, before they sadly went their separate ways. The singer spoke out in a candid interview, saying she saw a different side to the rugby player before their split 10 years ago.</p>
<p>He’s a lot more grown up and open. Charlotte Church</p>
<p>In an interview with Marie Clare a decade ago, Charlotte claimed that after Gavin returned home from the Arctic after filming 71 Degrees North with ITV, he had changed following their time apart. The classical performer said: &ldquo;He’s a lot more grown up and open. &ldquo;I think he learned a lot about himself and he’d never had time to sit back and reflect before.&rdquo; At the time of him filming for the show, the pair were still together. The series aired later that year in September after they parted ways. READ MORE: Gavin Henson: Rugby player and former Strictly star opens pub in Wales</p>

It was amazing. I really was going to marry Gav and spend the rest of my life with him.&rdquo; She then added: &ldquo;But then he came back from Norway and he’d changed and I’d had time to think. &ldquo;We had both had a change of heart – so we were both of the same mind.&rdquo; Their five-year romance came to an end in May that year.</p>

<p>The star also added that she only started dating her now-husband, Jonathan Powell, once she had spoken to Gavin about how she was feeling. The political activist told the publication: &ldquo;I’d been writing with Johnny for a while, but it was a good couple of months after me and Gav split. &ldquo;I kind of asked Gav’s permission in a way. I said to him, &lsquo;I really want you to know that nothing ever went on between me and Johnny while we were still together.’&rdquo; Charlotte went into detail about the bond she and Johnny have and how they have similar interests.

We just like the same stuff, the same films – it’s nothing groundbreaking.'&rdquo; Charlotte and Johnny married in a secret ceremony in 2017, three months after they lost their baby to a miscarriage. Meanwhile, the singer has been open about her ups and downs in the limelight after she rose to fame when she was just 12-years-old.</p>
