McDonald’s has responded to reports that it&rsquo;s going to reopen its restaurants across the UK.</p>
<p>The fast food giant took to Facebook - but told fans the wait for a Big Mac is far from over as the coronavirus lockdown goes on.</p>
<p>It has yet to confirm a date – but Irish Farmers Journal understands that they will re-open in a limited capacity in the UK and Ireland in May.</p>
<p>This includes drive-throughs and deliveries, it is reported.</p>
<p>In response, the company wrote: &ldquo;Well, our notifications are going wild tonight – we miss you too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We promise we will update you here as soon as we have confirmed our plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay safe, stay at home and we will see you soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report claimed that McDonald&rsquo;s had originally planned to re-open on July 1, but the date for limited services has been brought back to mid-May.</p>
<p>When a user responded asking for specific information, McDonald&rsquo;s said: &ldquo;When we have confirmed plans, we’ll be updating restaurants and employees via Our Lounge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no confirmed plans at this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a statement last month, the chain said: “This is not a decision we are taking lightly, but one made with the well-being and safety of our employees in mind as well as in the best interests of our customers.</p>
<p>“We will work with local community groups to responsibly distribute food and drink from our restaurants in the coming days.”</p>
<p>The company has donated more than 300 tonnes of food and 100,000 litres of milk to key workers and vulnerable people through food banks, across 1,900 towns and cities in the UK.

<h3 id="chef-reveals-how-to-make-mcdonalds-hash-browns-at-home-using-just-a-potato-and-egg">Chef reveals how to make McDonald’s hash browns at home using just a potato and egg</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/VP-COMP-MC-HASHBROWN.jpg?strip=all&amp;quality=100&amp;w=1200&amp;h=800&amp;crop=1" alt="img">
WE don&rsquo;t know about you but we&rsquo;re at the point in lockdown where we would literally give anything for a McDonald&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Since they closed their stores last month amid the coronavirus outbreak, we’ve tried everything from homemade Big Mac to cheese melt dippers.</p>
<p>⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news &amp; updates</p>
<p>7 Poppy O&rsquo;Toole is a Michelin-trained chef who shared her genius hash brown recipe on TikTok Credit: poppy_cooks/TIKTOK</p>
<p>But so far, nothing compares to their crispy hash browns. Or at least, that&rsquo;s what we thought.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, a Michelin-trained chef has taken one for the team by perfecting the art of the McDonald&rsquo;s hash brown - and you only need two ingredients.</p>
<p>Posting on her TikTok channel, Poppy O&rsquo;Toole recreated the delicious snack using a large potato and a single egg.</p>
<p>She started by grating the potato into very thin slices using a cheese grater and patting it down a piece of paper towel.</p>
<p>7 After grating the potato, Poppy patted it dry Credit: poppy_cooks/TIKTOK</p>
<p>7 She then transferred it into a clean tea towel and squeezed out any excess moisture Credit: poppy_cooks/TIKTOK</p>
<p>But just to make sure the potato was extra dry, Poppy then transferred it onto a clean tea towel to get rid of any excess moisture.</p>
<p>She explained: &ldquo;Put a little bit in at a time and squeeze the living life out of it! You&rsquo;ll be surprised by how much juice you get out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although this may seem like an unnecessary step, this is what will get the hash brown so crispy when it goes in the frying pan.</p>
<p>Next, Poppy cracked the egg over the dry potato shreds and made sure to put plenty of salt and pepper over the top before mixing it all together.</p>
<p>7 The next step was to add an egg and season Credit: poppy_cooks/TIKTOK</p>
<p>7 Poppy moulded the hash brown into shape before gently frying it Credit: poppy_cooks/TIKTOK</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it a good ol&rsquo; mush,&rdquo; Poppy added. &ldquo;And get it shaped in your hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once she had the perfect shape, Poppy then popped the hash brown into a frying pan and cooked it on a medium to low heat.</p>
<p>And while it might be tempting to fry it as quickly as possible, Poppy recommends only flipping the hash brown when it&rsquo;s golden brown on one side.</p>
<p>To finish it off, Poppy tilted the pan so the hash brown was covered in the hot oil and crispy all over.</p>

<p>7 Fans have been going wild for Poppy&rsquo;s simple recipe Credit: poppy_cooks/TIKTOK</p>
<p>Proudly showing off the results, she added: &ldquo;It was so good, I was so surprised by how well this worked and it&rsquo;s delicious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the McDonald&rsquo;s tutorial was a hit with Poppy&rsquo;s 4,000 followers.</p>
<p>One replied: &ldquo;Excellent! Making them for my family now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I need to try these,&rdquo; another gushed.</p>
<p>And while labelled the likeness to the real McDonald&rsquo;s hash browns &ldquo;witchcraft&rdquo;, a third raved: &ldquo;Good work Pops! Keep the ideas coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p><img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/26/13/untitled-design-79.jpg" alt="img">
Exactly a month ago, McDonald’s across the UK closed for the first time ever as a precautionary measure due to Covid-19.​</p>
<p>Despite restaurants remaining closed, employees and franchisees have continued serving their local communities and supporting national organisations, helping those that need it the most.</p>
<p>In addition, this week McDonald’s handed over use of its Meridian Business Park Drive Thru in Leicester for use by DHU Healthcare for COVID-19 testing for NHS workers.
