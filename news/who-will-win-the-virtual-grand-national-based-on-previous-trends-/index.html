The Virtual Grand National will be shown on ITV1 at 5pm on Saturday. It aims to resemble the real race using algorithms and a computer simulation and James Stevens has looked at what factors are key to finding the winner.</p>
<p>Winning form</p>
<p>There is a big emphasis on form, with seven of the top four finishers in the past three runnings having won on their previous start. That number includes all three winners of the race.</p>
<p>That top four figure stretches to ten if you include horses who have finished in the placings on their last starts.</p>
<p>In this year&rsquo;s field, nine of the 40 runners are last-time-out winners, including the well-fancied Any Second Now, Burrows Saint, Definitly Red and Kimberlite Candy.</p>
<p>Virtual Grand National history</p>
<p>2019: 1. Rathvinden 2. Tiger Roll 3. Jury Duty 4. Anibale Fly</p>
<p>2018: 1. Tiger Roll 2. Chase The Spud 3. Total Recall 4. Houblon Des Obeaux</p>
<p>2017: 1. Cause Of Causes 2. Pleasant Company 3. Vieux Lion Rouge 4. Vicente</p>
<p>Distance</p>
<p>One of the toughest elements for horses in the Grand National is the distance, and that has proved key in recent runnings. All three winners of the previous virtual Nationals had won over a trip of at least four miles before heading to Aintree.</p>
<p>Only two horses in this year&rsquo;s Virtual Grand National have won over four miles or longer, Tiger Roll and Potters Corner. But Ballyoptic, Elegant Escape, Talkischeap, Burrows Saint and Kimberlite Candy have all won big handicaps over staying distances.</p>
<p>All aspects of the race are aimed to be as realistic as possible</p>
<p>Weight</p>
<p>The average weight of top four finishers in the virtual National works out at 10st 13lb, a weight that Cause Of Causes carried to win the inaugural running in 2017 and Tiger Roll the following year. A number of horses have also run well off 10st 12lb.</p>
<p>Of Saturday&rsquo;s runners carrying similar marks, Total Recall, Magic Of Light and Ballyoptic are interesting.</p>
<p>Other factors</p>
<p>Irish-trained runners have dominated the race in previous years with 2018 runner-up Chase The Spud the only British-trained horse to finish in the top two.</p>
<p>Seven of the 12 top-four finishers were making their debut over the National fences, a further four had only one run previously. So Aintree experience does not appear to be a major factor.</p>
<p>Similar to the real race itself, the simulation tends to favour horses aged between nine and 11. The ideal age, on previous form, is nine, and eight runners fit that profile.</p>
<p>What do the creators of the Virtual National say?</p>
<p>Steve Rogers, chief commercial officer for Virtual Sports at Inspired Entertainment: &ldquo;Information about the horses is fed into the software, which helps to determine the probability of their potential finishing positions.</p>
<p>Virtual Grand National: making a fourth appearance on ITV</p>
<p>&ldquo;This probability is based on their past form and performance in other races. Layered on top of this, an element of AI (Artificial Intelligence) is involved in how the horses move around the course, how they jump fences and how they interact with each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, as always with the Grand National, there is an element of unpredictability, which makes it so fascinating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The final verdict</p>
<p>Tiger Roll certainly deserves his place at the top of the betting market. He is sure to run another big race, but the major concern is his handicap weight.</p>
<p>Ballyoptic seems to fit the right profile having won last time out, has run well over four miles and goes off a weight of 10st 11lb, just under the average.</p>
<p>Ballyoptic: selection for the Virtual Grand National</p>
<p>Potters Corner has won over a staying trip and comes here off a win so has a leading chance while Classic Chase winner Kimberlite Candy is another danger.</p>
<p>Prediction: 1. Ballyoptic 2. Potters Corner 3. Tiger Roll 4. Kimberlite Candy</p>

<p><img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/racing/2020/04/01/VGN_InRace_01_1-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNJjoeBT78QIaYdkJdEY4CnGTJFJS74MYhNY6w3GNbO8.jpg?imwidth=1200" alt="img">
If you don&rsquo;t know by now that all professional sport in this country has been cancelled, then we both admire and fear you. The Grand National, as surely everyone knows, has been one of the events to go.</p>
<p>The much-loved Aintree horse race was due to be run this Saturday April 4th but it is no longer on with the country in lockdown over coronavirus.</p>
<p>However, where there is a will there is a way, especially if there are opportunities to gamble on sport involved, and instead racing has cooked up a Virtual Grand National.</p>
<p>Virtual racing is not a new thing – some of the country&rsquo;s best and brightest can be seen following it in betting shops on any day of the week. But it is not generally televised on ITV on a Saturday at 5pm.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s find out who is running in the race, how they are going to do it, who is going to win and how you can have a punt.</p>
<p>Telegraph Sport columnists Jamie Carragher, Will Greenwood and Michael Vaughan have picked their winners here.</p>
<p>What is the Virtual Grand National?</p>
<p>It is a horse race featuring the horses who would have run in the real race, with their details fed into a computer simulation done by a company called Inspired.</p>
<p>How do they do that?</p>
<p>Steve Rogers, head of virtual sports at Inspired, said: “Information about the horses is fed into the software which helps determine the probability of their potential finishing positions based on form and past performance.”</p>
<p>The machine has a reasonable record at predicting how the race will turn out - it reckoned Rathvinden would be first and Tiger Roll Second last year, those two finished third and first.

THE Virtual Grand National is just a couple of days away!</p>
<p>Here is your ultimate guide to the final field of 40.</p>
<p>4 Tiger Roll will bid for a third straight victory in the Grand National</p>
<ol>
<li>Tiger Roll/Davy Russell</li>
</ol>
<p>What can you say that’s not already been said?</p>
<p>A wonderful servant to connections, he’s won the last two runnings of this race.</p>
<p>Not quite at his brilliant best at Cheltenham last time but still needs utmost respect back at his favourite course.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Bristol De Mai/Daryl Jacob</li>
</ol>
<p>Supremely talented at his beloved Haydock and not too shabby at Cheltenham either.</p>
<p>Has to carry a big weight here and this test on good to soft ground may not suit him as well as others.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Aso/Charlie Deutsch</li>
</ol>
<p>Ran the race of his life in last year’s Ryanair but that seems to have left its mark.</p>
<p>Too high in the weights and unproven at this distance makes him easily left out.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Elegant Escape/Jonjo O&rsquo;Neill Jnr</li>
</ol>
<p>Former Welsh Grand National winner loves a slog but this is bound to go too fast for him.</p>
<p>Not as good as he once was and could struggle.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Anibale Fly/Barry Geraghty</li>
</ol>
<p>Once classy enough to finish second in a Gold Cup, he’s become inconsistent and erratic.</p>
<p>However, he gets the services of Barry Geraghty and will like the ground, so all is not lost.</p>

<ol start="6">
<li>Top Ville Ben/Tommy Dowson</li>
</ol>
<p>A much improved performer this term but is undoubtedly overburdened and would much rather this was run at Wetherby.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Beware The Bear/Jerry McGrath</li>
</ol>
<p>Winner at the Cheltenham Festival last year, he’s often been one to think hard about the game.</p>
<p>Has a chance if putting it all together, but it’s a big ‘if’.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Peregrine Run/Kevin Sexton</li>
</ol>
<p>Has a big question mark over his stamina but can be given a chance at a mammoth price.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Jett/Sam Waley-Cohen</li>
</ol>
<p>Sam Wayey-Cohen takes the reins here, which is a plus straight away as he knows the course like the back of his hand.</p>
<p>Likely to have a willing partner who may just fade in the closing stages.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Alpha Des Obeaux/Richard Johnson</li>
</ol>
<p>Old boy who’d have a chance in his heyday but will probably struggle now.</p>
<p>That said, Richard Johnson is aboard and he can’t be discounted.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Total Recall/Paul Townend</li>
</ol>
<p>Rediscovered some of his spark this season and as a former Hennessy winner we know he’s on a good mark.</p>
<p>However, never stayed this far and could struggle at the business end.</p>
<p>4 Magic Of Light (left) was second in last year&rsquo;s race Credit: EPA</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>The Storyteller/Keith Donoghue</li>
</ol>
<p>Produced a fine performance at Cheltenham so we know he’s in good heart.</p>
<p>That was over hurdles, though, and he needs to jump better back over fences.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>Magic Of Light/Robbie Power</li>
</ol>
<p>Second in the contest last year, star mare has a big chance once again as she clearly loves the track.</p>
<p>She jumps very well and must have fine prospects of going one better.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>Talkischeap/Tom Cannon</li>
</ol>
<p>Very strong stayer and would have big prospects if he jumped a little better.</p>
<p>As it is, he’ll enjoy the ground and has a big chance.</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>Yala Enki/Bryony Frost</li>
</ol>
<p>Another strong stayer who had some very fine form in the book earlier in his career.</p>
<p>Has rediscovered some form for Paul Nicholls but needs a little more now.</p>

<ol start="16">
<li>Ballyoptic/Sam Twiston-Davies</li>
</ol>
<p>Needs soft ground to be seen at his best and won’t get that here.</p>
<p>Won the Charlie Hall earlier in the season and has claims for the Twiston-Davies clan.</p>
<ol start="17">
<li>Burrows Saint/Rachael Blackmore</li>
</ol>
<p>Irish Grand National winner from last season has stamina in spades and will be going longer than most.</p>
<p>Has the services of Rachael Blackmore and holds outstanding claims for Gold Cup-winning trainer Willie Mullins.</p>
<ol start="18">
<li>Definitly Red/Brian Hughes</li>
</ol>
<p>Smart chaser who comes here following a convincing win at Kelso.</p>
<p>One of the stronger challengers from the north but may struggle to stay.</p>

<ol start="19">
<li>Sub Lieutenant/JJ Slevin</li>
</ol>
<p>Front-runner who’s smart at his best but this is surely too tough.</p>
<ol start="20">
<li>Ok Corral/Derek O&rsquo;Connor</li>
</ol>
<p>SkyBet Chase winner has plenty of stamina and should have more to come given he’s so lightly raced.</p>
<p>Derek O’Connor has been booked and he must have a good chance, though Nicky Henderson has never won the race.</p>
<ol start="21">
<li>Tout Et Permis/Sean Flanagan</li>
</ol>
<p>Galloping grey should have exploited lower marks over hurdles this season and this is far too hard.</p>
<ol start="22">
<li>Vintage Clouds/Danny Cook</li>
</ol>
<p>Haydock specialist destroyed them in the Peter Marsh and relishes a slog.</p>
<p>May not get that here and could just be tapped for toe.</p>

<ol start="23">
<li>Crievehill/Tom Bellamy</li>
</ol>
<p>Rapid improver this term but has reached his ceiling and probably won’t stay.</p>
<ol start="24">
<li>Lake View Lad/Henry Brooke</li>
</ol>
<p>Done well up north and has performed well at Cheltenham, but this isn’t likely to suit this heavy-ground mud lover.</p>
<ol start="25">
<li>Jury Duty/Mark Enright</li>
</ol>
<p>Probably should have won last time out and doesn’t appear to be the weapon he once was.</p>
<p>Respected for Gordon Elliott but might just find a few too strong.</p>
<ol start="26">
<li>Pleasant Company/David Mullins</li>
</ol>
<p>Second in this two years ago was a fine effort and we know he stays well.</p>
<p>Not as good last year and could struggle now he’s another year older.</p>

<ol start="27">
<li>Acapella Bourgeois/Danny Mullins</li>
</ol>
<p>A fine front-runner in his youth has rediscovered some of his old zest of late.</p>
<p>Could go well at a big price.</p>
<ol start="28">
<li>Shattered Love/Lisa O&rsquo;Neill</li>
</ol>
<p>Mare with plenty of ability but hasn’t fired in the last couple of seasons.</p>
<p>Owners have a much better chance with Tiger Roll.</p>
<ol start="29">
<li>Any Second Now/Mark Walsh</li>
</ol>
<p>Won a Grade 3 in fine style last time and has been targeted at this ever since.</p>
<p>Has very strong claims if staying the distance.</p>
<ol start="30">
<li>Potters Corner /Jack Tudor</li>
</ol>
<p>Welsh National winner loves a stamina test and may not necessarily need heavy ground to be seen at his best.</p>
<p>Jack Tudor takes the ride and we’ve seen how good he is.</p>
<ol start="31">
<li>Dounikos/Luke Dempsey</li>
</ol>
<p>Pulled-up in three of his last four starts, including in this race last year, and surely faces too big an ask here.</p>
<ol start="32">
<li>Kildisart/Nico de Boinville</li>
</ol>
<p>Ran a huge race at the Cheltenham Festival and gets in off a nice weight here.</p>
<p>Has it to prove over this trip but has a chance if he gets it.</p>
<p>🗣️“It was John Gosden – he congratulated her and told her to pass it on to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David Bridgewater says Ultima winner The Conditional will be aimed at the Ladbrokes Trophy again next season plus reveals an interesting story regarding John Gosden! ⬇️https://t.co/g5Ff7v8P4o pic.twitter.com/jLu1dAm0TA — Racing TV (@RacingTV) March 18, 2020</p>
<ol start="33">
<li>Death Duty/Gavin Brouder</li>
</ol>
<p>Couldn’t get to grips with a fine jumper last time out after a long absence and is certainly best watched in these tougher waters.</p>
<ol start="34">
<li>Ramses De Teillee/Tom Scudamore</li>
</ol>
<p>Fine stayer with plenty of exceptional form over hurdles this season.</p>
<p>Has run well in the Welsh National before but probably needs softer ground.</p>
<ol start="35">
<li>Valtor/James Bowen</li>
</ol>
<p>Decent on his day but has plenty to prove, even under James Bowen.</p>
<p>4 Valtor will run in the Virtual Grand National for Nicky Henderson Credit: PA:Press Association</p>
<ol start="36">
<li>Saint Xavier/David Maxwell</li>
</ol>
<p>Has some good form this term but it would be some achievement if David Maxwell were to win this on his first attempt.</p>
<ol start="37">
<li>Warriors Tale/Harry Cobden</li>
</ol>
<p>Won the 2018 Grand Sefton Chase over these fences, form which would give him a shout.</p>
<p>However, has stamina to prove and is coming into this out of form.</p>
<ol start="38">
<li>Double Shuffle/Jonathan Burke</li>
</ol>
<p>Very little form to suggest he has a chance in this.</p>
<ol start="39">
<li>Kimberlite Candy/Richie McLernon</li>
</ol>
<p>Has got a very low weight and that gives him a huge chance considering he improved markedly to win Warwick’s Classic Chase last time.</p>
<p>Has all the hallmarks of a Grand National winner and might just the one to put it up to the market principals.</p>
<ol start="40">
<li>Walk In The Mill/James Best</li>
</ol>
<p>Loves Aintree and finished fourth in the race last year.</p>
<p>A year older and wiser now and his Becher Chase victory suggests he’ll produce another big run.
