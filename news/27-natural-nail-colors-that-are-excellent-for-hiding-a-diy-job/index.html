<p>There&rsquo;s nothing like a manicure to make yourself feel a little better. Whether you go to a salon or going the DIY route, looking down at freshly painted nails has the effect of making you feel put together, even when everything else in your life isn&rsquo;t exactly that way at the moment. And because nude nails are an under-the-radar look that others around you might not notice, for me, a manicure just gives me a secret little boost of feel-good confidence. And don&rsquo;t we all need just that sometimes?</p>
<p>While we love the dramatic look of deep red, springy pastels, and creative nail art, you really can&rsquo;t go wrong with a natural hue. It looks effortless, elegant, and understated all at once. Plus, these shades will look good even if you&rsquo;re giving yourself an at-home manicure and are struggling with a shaky hand. Take a look at some of our favorites below for all skin tones.

<h3 id="celeb-manicurists-say-these-are-the-best-nude-nail-colors-for-every-skin-tone">&ldquo;Celeb Manicurists Say These Are the Best Nude Nail Colors for Every Skin Tone&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/278527/best-nude-nail-colors-278527-1552697165453-fb.700x0c.jpg" alt="img">
According to celebrity nail artist Tom Bachik (whose clients include Jennifer Lopez, Margot Robbie, Selena Gomez, Kerry Washington, Kim Kardashian West, and Shay Mitchell), there&rsquo;s some artistic strategy to choosing the most flattering shade of nude nail polish for your skin tone—but it&rsquo;s probably not what you think. Personally, I&rsquo;ve always assumed that the best shade of nude would mirror the color of my fingertips to a tee, but as Bachik and other celebrity manicurists promptly informed me, that&rsquo;s not exactly the most strategic shopping plan if you&rsquo;re hunting for your personal perfect hue of nude. Oops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The current trend for a chic, sophisticated nude nail color is to either go a shade lighter or a shade darker than your actual skin tone, which gives a subtle yet intentional vibe to your manicure,&rdquo; Bachik explains to me. That said, and as we&rsquo;ve previously mentioned, one of the things we love most about the beauty industry right now is that there are no rules, and you should never feel limited when it comes to your beauty aesthetic—whether it be nail finish, color, shade pairings—your options extend to infinity and beyond.</p>
<p>Bachik agrees: &ldquo;The thing I don&rsquo;t want to happen is for someone to look at a particular color as only for a particular skin tone or shade,&rdquo; he tells us. &ldquo;Color is about style, fashion preference, and fun! If you love a color, rock it—whether it&rsquo;s a traditional or trendy shade for your skin tone or not.&rdquo; We couldn&rsquo;t agree more, so we compiled a hearty list of 27 (yes, 27) of the best nude nail colors. And, yes, we asked four of the top celebrity nail artists in the industry which ones they especially love for certain skin tones, but we invite you to use the below as a very loose guide and more of a large smattering of shade inspiration instead. Curious to see which nude nail colors celebrity manicurists hoard to suit clients of all skin tones? Keep scrolling.

For those seeking a break from bright nail colors and intricate nail art, it may be time for a polish palette cleanser. The answer we go back to time and time again? A go-to neutral. Arguably the most versatile nail color range, neutrals are also a big trend for 2020 (but really, did they ever go away?). By definition, they go with every outfit, so you’ll never have to worry about clashing colors. Plus, they tend to camouflage chips a little better than say, bright red, just in case your next manicure appointment is a little further away than you’d like.</p>
<p>You can always rely on a neutral for anything from weddings to work. We rounded up 20 of the coolest polishes—from light to dark, shimmery to opaque—for every skin tone, to keep your neutral nail game feeling fresh.

<h3 id="fashion-hits-and-misses-from-the-2020-grammy-awards">&ldquo;Fashion hits and misses from the 2020 Grammy Awards&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.wonderwall.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/01/1072756-62nd-annual-grammy-awards-arrivals.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2784px%2C1461px&amp;resize=1200%2C630&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
Anything goes on the Grammys red carpet, which makes it one of the most fabulous nights of the year for fashion. Now that the 2020 Grammy Awards have been handed out, Wonderwall.com is rounding up the best and worst dressed stars of the night. First up? Billie Eilish, who sported this custom Gucci black and green suit. And even though it stayed true to her very unique personal style, we just couldn&rsquo;t get behind this funky wide-legged ensemble. From that seriously sequined turtleneck to the fingerless gloves to the sheer face mask, we do give her props for nothing about this look being expected. Next up, a better view of some of these wild accessories and more of the night&rsquo;s hits and misses… RELATED: Stars at their first Grammy Awards</p>
<p>Bet you didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d see a Gucci-emblazoned face mask on the Grammy carpet! But Billie Eilish strangely added this accessory to her wacky Gucci getup, and also threw in tiny shades and fingerless gloves for good measure. And an honorable mention goes to those wild dark green Gucci nails she added to the mix. RELATED: Memorable looks of past Grammy awards</p>
<p>Ariana Grande had a serious cinderella moment in this frothy Giambattista Valli confection. Her pale gray gown featured layer upon layer of fluffy tulle and was accessorized perfectly by her matching evening gloves. The silhouette lent itself to a pretty unique red carpet pose… RELATED: Most buzzed about moments of Grammys past</p>
<p>We loved the way Ariana Grande posed on the red carpet and showed off the full effect of her dramatic ballgown. Next up? A look at her equally phenomenal jewels…</p>
<p>When it came time to add jewels to her Giambattista Valli gown, Ariana Grande donned 30-carat Lorraine Schwartz diamond stud earrings worth $2.5 million to add some sparkle to her dramatic red carpet moment. Completing this flawless look? That perfect cat-eye makeup and nude lip shade.</p>
<p>Though we appreciated that burgundy shade, we were totally bored by Shawn Mendes&rsquo;s Louis Vuitton Grammy getup. He added an unbuttoned white dress shirt underneath his three piece suit for a cool, undone feel, but we wish he would have pushed the envelope a little more for music&rsquo;s biggest night. One element we did like? The funky chain detail he had draped from his buttons…</p>
<p>Unique accessories always impress us! So despite not loving Shawn Mendes&rsquo;s three piece Louis Vuitton suit, we loved the funky chain detail he had hanging from his waistcoat. Next up, another accessory we were feeling…</p>
<p>Shawn Mendes accessorized his suit with another pleasant surprise — this pretty diamond and green-stoned necklace.</p>
<p>One of the stars we were most excited to see on the red carpet at this year&rsquo;s Grammys? Lizzo — who certainly didn&rsquo;t disappoint in this angelic Atelier Versace confection. The white gown featured a slinky silhouette embroidered with sparkling crystals and was topped with a white fur stole. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look…</p>
<p>Check out the way Lizzo&rsquo;s fur stole included stunning crystal-covered bracelets to keep it in place. We loved that extra sparkly detail, and the way she added some more simple diamond bracelets to the mix. And there&rsquo;s one more blinged-out element of her look we need to check out before we move on…</p>
<p>Those nails! To complete her heavenly white Versace ensemble, Lizzo&rsquo;s nails included silver embellishments and diamonds dripping from each nail.</p>
<p>Chrissy Teigen made a splash in this bold orange Yanina Couture gown. And though we loved the color and the peplum layer at the waist, we could&rsquo;ve done without the dramatic mismatched sleeves and distracting slit. She completed her look with rose gold Giuseppe Zanotti heels and some standout jewelry. See that next…</p>
<p>Though we weren&rsquo;t in love with the silhouette of Chrissy Teigen&rsquo;s frock, we loved her accessory decisions. The star added some dramatic drop earrings and multiple chunky rings.</p>
<p>Gwen Stefani sported seashells on the red carpet at the Grammys! Yep, you read that right — her Dolce &amp; Gabbana minidress was adorned with tons of tiny seashells, some of which she claimed were collected by her beau Blake Shelton. He also inspired her dress in another way, she joked that the unexpected embellishments were a tribute to part of Blake&rsquo;s last name Shelton. The star paired her short frock with a pair of matching ivory thigh-high boots. Next up, we&rsquo;ve got to take a closer look at those shells…</p>
<p>Seashells on the red carpet aren&rsquo;t something we&rsquo;re used to seeing, but we were feeling this exotic twist on Gwen Stefani&rsquo;s minidress. She accessorized with a subtle little pearl earring to add a little more ivory to the mix.</p>
<p>We know to expect outlandish looks from FKA twigs, but this Ed Marler outfit amounted to a fashion miss on the Grammy carpet. The star&rsquo;s gothic pink and black gown felt more costume-like than couture, with a dramatic ruffled neckline and sheer fabric along the sleeves and up the skirt with black and silver embroidery over top. Despite the over-the-top confection, we did appreciate the way she added antique jewelry to complete this throwback vibe. See her earrings and necklace next…</p>
<p>FKA Twigs added incredibly unique pieces from Bentley and Skinner to her Grammy ensemble. The antique jewelry certainly wowed, but unfortunately was drown out by the busy frock.</p>
<p>The best dressed man at the Grammys this year? That honor goes to Lil Nas X, who made a splash on the red carpet in this hot pink head-to-toe Versace ensemble. The rapper&rsquo;s fuchsia leather suit featured studs, crystals and a foulard detail along the wrists to bring in the fashion house&rsquo;s signature baroque print. Next up, a closer look at all these extra touches…</p>
<p>We loved the way Lil Nas X&rsquo;s silky foulard additions added a different texture to the full leather look. It also tied in another prominent theme in his custom ensemble — gold! Check out all the studding next…</p>
<p>Lil Nas X&rsquo;s bright pink getup also featured plenty of gold studding and embellishments — including bold gold Medusa buttons on the pockets that matched his Medusa-clad earrings. We also loved the double collar and double belt detail, and the way he topped things off with a Medusa-emblazoned matching cowboy hat.</p>
<p>We were seriously underwhelmed by Lana Del Rey&rsquo;s silver design on the Grammy carpet. The star arrived in this dull short-sleeved silver gown with a keyhole cutout and fringe in a zigzagged pattern down the skirt. Even her cat-eye and updo couldn&rsquo;t salvage this unimpressive look.</p>
<p>We loved Dua Lipa&rsquo;s sleek Alexander Wang slip dress on the Grammy carpet. The star&rsquo;s &rsquo;90s throwback proved sometimes simplicity is best — with its spaghetti straps and simple silhouette. Next up? A look at hew accessories, which also channeled that decade…</p>
<p>Dua Lipa added some hoops and a diamond choker to her white Alexander Wang frock. But unfortunately the star lost us when it came to her bizarre makeup selection — all-over bright blue eye shadow and a surprisingly dark lip. Equally disappointing? Her odd updo.</p>
<p>Though we applaud H.E.R. for the print mixing, we weren&rsquo;t wild about her bold long-sleeved gown. The multicolored DSquared2 frock featured a gold thick belt detail at the waist, but we found all the different designs too distracting to put the look on the hit list.</p>
<p>Upon first glance, it looked like Camila Cabello was having a serious princess moment in this black ballgown by Versace. But up close you could see there was an edgier element to this seemingly feminine design…</p>
<p>The bodice of Camila Cabello&rsquo;s Versace gown was actually made of leather, giving the frock a surprising twist. The stitched leather texture also included crystal embellishments and contrasted perfectly with the full crinoline skirt. Equally stunning? The necklace the star wore…</p>
<p>Camila Cabello added some serious bling in the form of a $2 million necklace from Le Vian, which featured layer after layer of diamonds.</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t feeling Jameela Jamil&rsquo;s electric blue ballgown by Georges Chakra. Her strapless frock included thick ruffled detailing over the bodice and down the full skirt, and also inexplicably featured a stripe of sheer black fabric in the middle.</p>
<p>Phillip Sweet, Kimberly Schlarpman, Jimi Westbrook and Karen Fairchild of Little Big Town looked phenomenal all decked out in Dolce &amp; Gabbana. Philip stood out in a red suit and Kimberly wowed in this stunning teal gown with plenty or tiered ruffles, while Karen opted for an amazing tan number with a plunging neckline, a tie detail at the waist and fur-trimmed tiers and Jimi rounding out the group in a gray and black tux with a pink shirt underneath.</p>
<p>Well, we have to give him an A for effort. Billy Porter arrived in this wild custom Baja East look that turned heads and made headlines. The glittering teal jumpsuit was topped with a cropped three-quarter-length jacket and featured silver fringe from the knees down. On anyone else this might have been shocking, but with Billy&rsquo;s fashion track record this look was actually tame. The most interesting feature? The Sarah Sokol Millinery hat that featured chandelier fringe that certainly made a statement — and moved! Take a look…</p>
<p>Billy Porter&rsquo;s hat featured moving fringe! And he added even more sparkle with pieces from Alexis Bittar Jewelry.</p>
<p>Red hot! Rosalia donned this show-stopping red leather number by Alexander Wang at the Grammys, which had an interested triple belt detail and ended in asymmetrical fringe. Equally worthy of a closer look? Her incredible jewels and nail art…</p>
<p>Rosalia complemented her killer red getup with jewel-encrusted nails and a massive teardrop diamond ring on her left hand, adding some sparkle to her Grammy look.</p>
<p>Though we adore Lewis Capaldi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Someone You Loved,&rdquo; we couldn&rsquo;t get behind his super casual Grammy getup. The talented singer rocked a black jacket, pants and white t-shirt that he completed with a pair of Vans.</p>
<p>While dual-colored looks have been seriously trending this award season, Alessandra Ambrosio took it to a whole new level in this black and white Balmain frock. The supermodel stunned in this half full-length frock, half white black-belted bodysuit, which she paired with cool Gianvito Rossi sandals. She also added equally show-stopping earrings to complete her look…</p>
<p>We loved Alessandra Ambrosio&rsquo;s bold earring choice, opting for geometric shapes with these Tasaki earrings.</p>
<p>Bellhop chic? Tyler the Creator donned this strange pale pink getup by Golf Le Fleur with gold button details, and really committed to the theme with a red bellhop hat, white gloves and a matching pink suitcase. Despite the very unique theme, we just couldn&rsquo;t get behind this funky choice.</p>
<p>Though at first glance it looked like Bebe Rexha&rsquo;s photo might have been pixelated, upon closer inspection the star&rsquo;s cool Christian Cowan pantsuit actually featured a netted detail with black and sparkly sequins. Let&rsquo;s take a closer look…</p>
<p>The netted feature on Bebe Rexha&rsquo;s Christian Cowan getup certainly stood out on the red carpet. We liked the unique take on the sheer trend, and the way it extended to her sleeves to create a glove-like detail.</p>
<p>Rising star Maggie Rogers embraced her status and rocked this star-clad Chanel design. The short-sleeved black frock featured subtle sheer paneling and golden stars embellished all over, but overall the frock felt too underwhelming for such a big moment in the star&rsquo;s career.</p>
<p>It was Balmain for Ben Platt on the Grammy carpet. We loved the star&rsquo;s eye-catching black and white checkered coat, and the way he paired it with a black turtleneck. He completed his look with a pair of black Jimmy Choo shoes.</p>
<p>Though there are different rules on the Grammy carpet, we&rsquo;re still not sold on Pia Mia&rsquo;s fringe-clad silver minidress. The halter-style frock felt more appropriate for a night out than a fancy red carpet.</p>
<p>Ty Dolla $ign looked sharp at the Grammys in this black and white getup. The rapped donned a black shirt and jeans topped with a white blazer with black pinstripes and stark white pointy-toe boots for a crisp look.</p>
<p>We feel like we&rsquo;ve seen Heidi Klum&rsquo;s mostly sheer Dundas dress a dozen times before. The model&rsquo;s long-sleeved frock featured a plunging neckline and center slit, which helped show off her Giuseppe Zanotti heels, but unfortunately the ensemble landed her on the miss list.</p>
<p>Diplo continued his cowboy fashion streak with this chic Dior number. We loved the hat and overall Southwestern vibe — including the turquoise embellishments — that his sharp look brought to the red carpet.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re massive Shania Twain fans, but we couldn&rsquo;t get behind this black frock. The country star embraced the overdone sheer trend to our dismay, rocking sheer sleeves and a completely see-through tulle skirt.</p>
<p>Elle Mai wowed in a cherry red design by Giorgio Armani. The star&rsquo;s standout frock featured a structured strapless neckline and ruffling at the top of the thigh-high slit, and paired perfectly with her strappy red heels.</p>
<p>JoJo ushered in the high slits on the red carpet, arriving in this strapless slinky silver gunmetal gray number complete with navy sparkles and ruching. Though we weren&rsquo;t wild about the silhouette, we did appreciate the gown&rsquo;s interesting feature — a bedazzled chain across the slit. Get a better look next…</p>
<p>We love this twist on the tired thigh-high slit look! This tiny detail was our favorite part of JoJo&rsquo;s Grammy getup, even over those strappy high heels.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got to give it to Shaun Ross! Though this Grammy ensemble was pretty funky, the continuity is incredible. Every inch of his golden look is embellished with pearls — from his earlobes down to the bottom of his boots!</p>
<p>Lilly Singh sported this one-shouldered lime green Georges Chakra gown on the Grammy carpet, bringing a pop of bright color to the mix. Even though we weren&rsquo;t wild about the overdone thigh-high slit, the satin trim and that unique shade won us over in the end.</p>
<p>We appreciate the sweet touch on Tess Holiday&rsquo;s pale pink dress — check out those cute strawberries — we felt the dress was a little too playful for an award show. Though we do give her props for the way she accessorized with those cute red sandals.
