<h3 id="coronavirus-boris-johnson-still-in-charge-despite-hospital-admission">Coronavirus: Boris Johnson &lsquo;still in charge&rsquo; despite hospital admission</h3>
<p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B28E/production/_111601754_borisj.jpg" alt="img">
Image caption The PM took part in the clap for carers on Thursday outside No 11 Downing Street</p>
<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson is &ldquo;still very much in charge of the government&rdquo; despite spending the night in hospital with coronavirus, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has said.</p>
<p>The PM was taken to a London hospital on Sunday evening with &ldquo;persistent symptoms&rdquo; - including a temperature - for a series of routine tests.</p>
<p>It is said to be a &ldquo;precautionary step&rdquo; taken on the advice of his doctor.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson, 55, tested positive for coronavirus 10 days ago.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab will chair Monday morning&rsquo;s coronavirus meeting in his place, Mr Jenrick said.</p>
<p>Last month, the prime minister&rsquo;s spokesman said if Mr Johnson was unwell and unable to work, Mr Raab, as the first secretary of state, would stand in.</p>
<p>Mr Jenrick told BBC Breakfast: &ldquo;We hope that as a result of these tests [the prime minister] will be able to come back to Downing Street as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been working extremely hard leading the government and being constantly updated. That&rsquo;s going to continue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure this is very frustrating for him, for somebody like Boris who wants to be hands [on] running the government from the front, but nonetheless he&rsquo;s still very much in charge of the government,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump is among those who has sent his wishes to Mr Johnson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All Americans are praying for him. He&rsquo;s a great friend of mine, a great gentleman and a great leader,&rdquo; Mr Trump said, adding that he was sure the prime minister would be fine because he is &ldquo;a strong person&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And Labour leader Keir Starmer said he hoped the prime minister had a &ldquo;speedy recovery&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Health Minister Nadine Dorries, who herself tested positive for coronavirus last month, said many of those with the virus would be &ldquo;felled&rdquo; by fatigue and a high temperature and use isolation to sleep and recover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boris has risked his health and worked every day on our behalf to lead the battle against this vile virus,&rdquo; she said in a tweet.</p>
<p>Although Downing Street insist the PM is still in charge, if the medics insist he needs to rest and recuperate then he may well have to take a step back for a period of time.</p>
<p>In the UK we no longer have a deputy prime minister - the last one was Nick Clegg under David Cameron.</p>
<p>Technically, Dominic Raab - as first secretary of state - would be expected to step up.</p>
<p>His position as foreign secretary, however, does not put him at the centre of the fight against coronavirus.</p>
<p>It would seem likely therefore that the two figures who would be expected to take a key role would be Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove and Health Secretary Matt Hancock.</p>
<p>Both men have been frequent representatives of the government at the daily news conferences.</p>
<p>Fortunately, however, many of the key decisions - namely how long the lockdown should continue and what the exit strategy should be - still appear some way off.</p>
<p>At the moment the focus is on &ldquo;flattening the curve&rdquo; and reducing the level of infections and admissions to hospital.</p>
<p>The day-to-day decisions are therefore likely to depend much more on the advice of the scientists and officials.</p>
<p>The really big decisions are some way off - when it is hoped the prime minister will have recovered.</p>
<p>Dr Sarah Jarvis, a GP and broadcaster, told the BBC that Mr Johnson would be likely to have his chest X-rayed and his lungs scanned, particularly if he had been struggling for breath.</p>
<p>She said he is also likely to have an electrocardiogram to check his heart&rsquo;s function, as well as tests on his oxygen levels, white blood cell count, and liver and kidney function before he is released from hospital.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson has worked from home since it was announced that he had tested positive for coronavirus on 27 March.</p>
<p>He was last seen in public applauding the NHS and other key workers from his flat in Downing Street on Thursday evening, and chaired a coronavirus meeting remotely on Friday morning.</p>
<p>Also on Friday, the prime minister posted a Twitter video in which said he was still displaying minor symptoms.</p>
<p>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Boris Johnson posted a video message on Friday</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still have a temperature. So in accordance with government advice I must continue my self isolation until that symptom itself goes,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;re working clearly the whole time on our programme to beat the virus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Saturday, his pregnant partner Carrie Symonds tweeted that she had spent a week in bed with the main symptoms.</p>
<p>She said she had not been tested for the virus.</p>
<p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock had also tested positive for the virus and returned from self-isolation on Thursday to host the daily Downing Street news conference.</p>
<p>The government&rsquo;s chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, has also had to self-isolate after showing symptoms.</p>
<p>The news of Mr Johnson&rsquo;s admission to hospital came shortly after the Queen delivered a rallying message to the nation, saying the UK &ldquo;will succeed&rdquo; in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>In a rare speech, the monarch thanked people for following government rules to stay at home and praised those &ldquo;coming together to help others&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In other developments:</p>
<p>On Sunday the Department of Health said 621 more people had died in hospital in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total death toll to 4,934.</p>
<p>As of 09:00 BST on Sunday, 47,806 people had tested positive for coronavirus, the department said.</p>

<h3 id="coronavirus-boris-johnson-admitted-to-hospital-over-virus-symptoms">Coronavirus: Boris Johnson admitted to hospital over virus symptoms</h3>

Image caption The PM took part in the clap for carers on Thursday outside No 11 Downing Street</p>
<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been admitted to hospital for tests, 10 days after testing positive for coronavirus, Downing Street has said.</p>
<p>He was taken to a London hospital on Sunday evening with &ldquo;persistent symptoms&rdquo; - including a temperature.</p>
<p>It is said to be a &ldquo;precautionary step&rdquo; taken on the advice of his doctor.</p>
<p>The prime minister remains in charge of the government, but the foreign secretary is expected to chair a coronavirus meeting on Monday morning.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson, 55, spent the night in hospital and is having what has been described as a series of &ldquo;routine tests&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In a statement, a Downing Street spokeswoman said: &ldquo;On the advice of his doctor, the prime minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a precautionary step, as the prime minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus 10 days after testing positive for the virus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She added: &ldquo;The prime minister thanks NHS staff for all of their incredible hard work and urges the public to continue to follow the government&rsquo;s advice to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>US President Donald Trump began a White House press briefing by sending &ldquo;our nation&rsquo;s well wishes&rdquo; for Mr Johnson&rsquo;s &ldquo;own personal fight with the virus&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All Americans are praying for him. He&rsquo;s a great friend of mine, a great gentleman and a great leader,&rdquo; Mr Trump said, adding that he was sure the prime minister would be fine because he is &ldquo;a strong person&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Labour leader Keir Starmer also wished Mr Johnson well, saying he hoped for a &ldquo;speedy recovery&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Coronavirus is straining the highest levels of government</p>
<p>The prime minister, alongside the Queen, personifies the country&rsquo;s public response to this pandemic.</p>
<p>And Boris Johnson is continuing to personally experience the unpleasant reality of the virus.</p>
<p>Downing Street officials are adamant Mr Johnson remains in charge of the government and is in contact with ministerial colleagues and civil servants.</p>
<p>But the undeniable reality is there is nothing conventional, nothing normal about this - however routine the tests are that the prime minister is receiving.</p>
<p>The coronavirus has repeatedly proven its capacity to turn the far-fetched into reality, over and over again.</p>
<p>Advisers, officials and ministerial colleagues have all been forced to self-isolate.</p>
<p>Covid-19, the illness which the virus causes, is crippling the economy, robbing us of our usual liberties - and now it is straining the personal capacity of those at the highest level of government to respond to it.</p>
<p>Dr Sarah Jarvis, a GP and broadcaster, told the BBC that Mr Johnson would be likely to have his chest X-rayed and his lungs scanned, particularly if he had been struggling for breath.</p>
<p>She said he is also likely to have an electrocardiogram to check his heart&rsquo;s function, as well as tests on his oxygen levels, white blood cell count, and liver and kidney function before he is released from hospital.</p>
