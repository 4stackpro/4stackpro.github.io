<p>We are providing free access to the most important news and useful guidance on the coronavirus outbreak to help you understand the pandemic. Get the latest news and more information here.</p>
<p>Mental Health</p>
<p>What can I do to ease my anxiety about this? + Some of the most important measures you can take to help manage anxiety, experts say, include staying informed on the facts, asking for help and practicing self-compassion. For some people, anxiety manifests in feeling helpless or underreacting to what they’re experiencing. Recognize your own agency and start taking care of the common-sense precautionary measures that are within your control, like stocking up on a couple of extra weeks’ supply of food or medication. Maintaining social connection, despite physical distance, is also important. Reach out to others via phone calls, emails or video chats, and talk through the feelings you’re experiencing. It’s important to be gentle with yourself, and maintain any kind of routine you can to have a sense of stability. Practice self-care, whether that means doing an at-home workout, baking, maintaining a regular religious practice or journaling. Focusing on these things can help bring some peace of mind. If your anxiety is debilitating, seek out a mental health professional or other clinical mental health services. I’m having trouble sleeping. Any tips? + While there’s no single trick that works for everyone, one thing you can try now to improve your sleep is setting up a consistent schedule. That means sticking to a regular bedtime and wake time. Try to go 90 minutes without any screen time before bed &ndash; that means no emails, social media or watching T.V. You can also take baby steps, beginning with 15 minutes, then working your way up. Working out, whether that means taking a socially distant walk or doing an at-home routine, can also help tire you out and dispel extra nervous energy. Taking a warm shower or bath 90 minutes before lights out may also help prime you for a better night’s sleep. Be sure to nix the coffee, alcohol and any eating before bed &ndash; these things don’t promote quality rest. Finally, manage your anxiety through meditation, deep breathing techniques and, in some cases, medication. If your anxiety is debilitating, seek out a mental health professional or other clinical mental health services. How can I deal with grief during this time? + One of the most important things you can do to help manage your grief includes acknowledging it in the first place. “The more we can say to ourselves and the people around us, ‘Yes, these are meaningful losses,’ the more seen and soothed we will feel,” Lori Gottlieb, a therapist and author, recently wrote in The Times. Ms. Gottlieb recommends staying in the present as much as possible, versus thinking about the future or ruminating on things that haven’t happened yet. Try the “both/and” method: Let yourself feel your loss in the present while simultaneously promoting feelings of safety by taking actions like reading a book or video-chatting a friend. And realize that there’s no one-size-fits-all for grief &ndash; everyone expresses it differently. Let yourself do whatever makes you feel best, whether that’s taking some alone time in your room or stress-cooking. How can I better take care of myself at home, aside from cleaning? + Having a conversation with everyone in your household, particularly children, about what’s going on is a good idea to help manage stress and keep everyone at home on the same page. Maintaining your mental fitness, in addition to physical fitness, is also important. Read a book, play a game, call a friend or just otherwise give yourself a break from the news to take care of your emotional and mental health. Open your windows to let in some fresh air. To improve your indoor air quality, turn on the ventilation hood above your stove and open windows when cooking, if you can. If you smoke or vape, you should try to quit, or at the very least limit second hand smoke in the house by stepping outside (while maintaining social distance). And if you can afford an air purifier, it might be a good investment as well. My eating habits have drastically changed. How can I better manage them? + Of course, eating too much or too little in the short term is not a huge cause of concern for someone who is healthy, experts said. But in the long term, moderation is important. Your body’s physical stress response may affect what kinds of foods you are reaching for, drawing you more toward carbohydrates and foods that are high in fat. Take stock of how any stress and anxiety may have affected your eating habits. If you think you’re snacking too much when you’re not hungry, it may help to allow some time to pass and distract yourself with another activity before grabbing more food. Try to add some healthy snacks like fruits and vegetables into your routine, if you can. If you’re regularly not eating enough, find something you can tolerate eating, or drink a calorie-rich beverage, like a protein shake. If you’re forgetting to eat entirely, schedule your mealtimes into your calendar and treat meals like any other essential appointment. You can also set alarms as a reminder to drink some water, or eat something.</p>
<p>How Can I Help</p>
<p>Can I give blood? + You can. Donor blood is not being used to treat coronavirus patients, but transfusions are still needed for cases like organ transplants or complications of childbirth. But thousands of community blood drives have been canceled, cutting short a crucial supply. The American Red Cross is still collecting donations at blood banks, which have enacted new safety measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Those measures include checking the temperatures of staff members and donors before they enter a drive facility, providing hand sanitizer for use before and during the donation process, enhancing their disinfection of surfaces and equipment, and spacing beds — when possible — to enable social distancing between donors. And even if you’re under a stay-at-home order, donating blood is an essential need, so public health officials have made an exception for your trip to the donation center. To find a donation center, check the American Association of Blood Banks locator, visit the Red Cross website or call 1-800-RED-CROSS. Read More Here’s how to donate blood during the outbreak. Where can I donate? + Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. More than 20,000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal, though.) Read More You can find more relief organizations and ways to give here. Want to give toward medical supplies? + Relief International, which operates in 16 countries throughout Africa, the Middle East and Asia, has focused some of its efforts on helping Iran, where more than 20,000 infections and at least 1,500 deaths have been reported. Heart to Heart International is distributing urgently needed equipment and medication to its partners around the world. Medical supplies are also being delivered to providers on the front lines. Want to simply give money? + GlobalGiving is a large global crowdfunding community that connects nonprofits, donors and companies. It has set a goal of reaching $5 million in donations. Money received will go toward sending emergency medical workers to communities in need, providing medical supplies to hospitals and helping deliver essentials to families. I have a sewing machine. Can I make masks? + You can! There are patterns circulating online, and some sewing stores have been handing out kits. They won’t be the high-grade N95 masks that are the most effective devices to filter out the coronavirus, nor will they even be as tough as surgical masks. But the D.I.Y. pieces offer at least some protection. Some doctors are wearing the homemade fabrics over surgical or N95 masks, trying to prolong the coveted masks’ limited life spans. Other masks are being handed out at health clinics and nursing homes. “It frees up the surgical masks for the people who are the highest risk,” Dr. Nicole Seminara, a doctor at NYU Langone Health, told The Times. I’m worried about my favorite local business. + By the time the coronavirus crisis is over, we might emerge from our homes only to find some of our favorite shops, restaurants and other local businesses permanently shuttered. As part of the sweeping stimulus bill, federally guaranteed loans would be available at community banks to small businesses that pledge not to lay off their workers. One way you as an individual could help your favorite small business would be to consider buying a gift card online. I have older neighbors. How can I help them? + Older people seem to be particularly susceptible to contracting the coronavirus, according to health officials. Some are staying at home and, as a precaution, may not open their doors to visitors. One way to check on homebound older residents without jeopardizing their health is to call or send a text, said Eric. S. Goldstein, the chief executive officer of the UJA-Federation of New York, which provides food, health care and other services to people in need. If telephone calls and texts are not an option, “talk through the door,” Mr. Goldstein said. Because some people may recoil at the suggestion that they are not self-sufficient, Mr. Goldstein suggested offering to help in a low-key way, such as saying, “I’m running to the market, can I get you anything?”</p>
<p>Staying In</p>
<p>Going Out</p>
<p>My state isn’t under any orders to stay at home. So I don’t have to, right? + The situation is changing daily, as it becomes clear the outbreak has spread to more parts of the country. The federal government is largely leaving the decision up to states, and some state leaders are leaving the decision up to local authorities. Even if you aren’t being told to stay at home, it’s still a good idea to limit trips outside and your interaction with other people. Can I go to the park? + Yes! Getting exercise outside is a great alternative to going to the gym, where touching high-contact equipment can pose a risk (if your gym is even still open). A study last year found infectious germs on about a third of the surfaces at 16 different fitness facilities. Exercise boosts our immune systems, and even a single workout can improve our ability to fight off germs, according to the latest research. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea. Should I get on the subway? Go to the grocery store? + This decision is personal and depends on your tolerance for risk. Many places around the world have ordered — or strongly urged — residents to stay indoors, unless they absolutely need to be outside. If you can avoid the subway, that may be smart, but if you can’t, there are things you can do to minimize your risk. Avoid jam-packed cars. If you need to hold onto a pole, use a disposable glove that you can throw away when you leave the subway. Avoid touching your face. At the grocery store, wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home. What’s an essential service? Who decides that? + In places where officials have called for workplaces to be shuttered, there are exemptions for “essential” services and businesses. Those institutions can remain open for customers and have workers onsite. In the United States there are federal guidelines for what is considered an essential service, but decisions are often made at the state level. For example, here are some lists of essential services in New York, Massachusetts, California and Illinois. All four states consider pharmacies, gas stations, laundromats and groceries to be essential, and all of them say restaurants can stay open for take-out and delivery orders. Typically, essential services also include utilities, telecommunications and transportation providers; animal shelters and veterinary services; manufacturers and distributors of basic goods; and child care for those who work in essential services. Can I take my laundry to a laundromat? Is that safe? + The C.D.C. has guidelines about laundry. It says do not shake dirty laundry, to minimize the possibility of dispersing the virus through the air. If possible, wash items using the warmest water setting, and dry thoroughly. Dirty laundry that has been in contact with an ill person can be washed with other people’s items, the C.D.C. said. Clean and disinfect hampers or other carts for transporting laundry, according to the guidelines for cleaning surfaces. The need for physical distancing has prompted some laundromats to dismantle their seating areas, according to Planet Laundry, the magazine of the Coin Laundry Association. Some laundromats are asking people to stay in their cars during their wash and dry cycles, and some have removed chairs and tables to discourage people from mingling. Commercial-grade washers and dryers operate at higher temperatures and with more rigorous mechanical action that, when combined with hot water and proper detergent use, can effectively flush contaminants from clothing better than residential machines, says the association, which represents 30,000 small businesses.</p>
<p>Just for Kids</p>
<p>Can I visit my grandparents? + You shouldn’t. But if Skype, FaceTime or another app is an option, you can make a virtual visit. And there’s always the old-fashioned telephone call, too. The virus is especially bad for older people like your grandma and grandpa, which means it’s even more important for them to stay away from other people. It can be hard, but this keeps them healthier. Can I play on the playground? + Probably not. You shouldn&rsquo;t touch the slides or swings (the virus can live on them, whether they are plastic or metal), and you&rsquo;d have to stay about six feet away from other kids. Maybe go to a field and try a game of catch with one of your parents. My school is closed. When will it reopen? + It depends. Schools are closed for different lengths of time, and it&rsquo;s unclear when it will be safe to go back. Some schools are trying learning-from-home programs, and others are offering free lunches for pick-up. Ask your parents. Can I have a playdate? + Probably not. You&rsquo;d have to stay about six feet away from your friend. Maybe a bike ride or walk, with some distance between you? Or you could try a video-chat if that&rsquo;s an option.</p>
<p>Science</p>
<p>Why is it called the coronavirus? + Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that infect animals and people. In February, the W.H.O. gave official names to both this virus (SARS-CoV-2, for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and the disease it causes (Covid-19, for coronavirus disease 2019). You may have heard it called the “new” or “novel” coronavirus, and those mean just what they sound like: that it’s new. How does it spread? + It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. Read More Here’s more about the latest research. What makes this outbreak so different? + Unlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions particularly hard — not just those with respiratory diseases. I heard ibuprofen doesn’t work. Is that true? + The health minister of France, Olivier Véran, recently left global health officials puzzled when he warned that people ill with the coronavirus should stay away from painkillers like ibuprofen and aspirin. He said such nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, or Nsaids, could aggravate symptoms of the coronavirus, and suggested that people take acetaminophen instead. Because the coronavirus is a new pathogen, there is not a lot known on how patients respond to common medications, but other experts pushed back on the French minister’s warning. “It’s all anecdote, and fake news off the anecdotes,” said Dr. Garret FitzGerald, chair of the department of pharmacology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. The World Health Organization has said that it is aware of no research showing that ibuprofen should not be taken by patients with Covid-19, and the F.D.A. said it was investigating the issue further and would provide more information when it becomes available. Read More Is ibuprofen really risky for coronavirus patients? How long can the virus live on a doorknob? On cash? On my keyboard? + The coronavirus can live up to 72 hours on some surfaces, like plastic and steel, according to a recent study. It can survive on cardboard for up to 24 hours. The good news is that coronaviruses are easy to destroy. A disinfectant on a surface will render it harmless, according to Gary Whittaker, a professor of virology at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. Although the W.H.O. has not said that cash transmits the virus, the organization said in a statement that “it is good hygiene practice to wash your hands after handling money, especially if eating or handling food.” Are you sensing a theme? Wash your hands after touching almost anything, especially if it’s a surface outside your home. Can the coronavirus live on my clothes? + Yes, but a different question is what you should do about it. A virus tends to live longer on some nonporous surfaces, like steel or plastic, as compared to fabrics like cotton or leather. But after numerous people who attended a Buddhist temple in Hong Kong fell ill, health workers did find coronavirus on the cloth covers of prayer books, among other items. It’s probably not worth looking up stats and studies about every kind of surface in your life. The takeaway is the same: Disinfect surfaces that are touched a lot and wash your hands after touching anything, and especially before touching your face or eating. (Two Broadway composers even wrote you a song to sing while you wash).</p>
<p>Travel</p>
<p>Can I still travel? + Depending on where you want to go, not easily. In March, as more and more governments around the world hoped to slow the spread of the coronavirus, they began to impose travel restrictions and even close their borders. In the United States, President Trump has said he is considering some restrictions on domestic travel. (The military has curtailed domestic travel for service members and their families.) And if you do go anywhere, remember to practice social distancing: stay away from groups and keep at least six feet of distance between you and other people. Read More Here are more answers to questions about travel. I don&rsquo;t mind being alone, but I&rsquo;d like to do it somewhere else. Is it possible to road trip responsibly? + People around the United States are being told to stay home, but you might still need to make a road trip, whether to care for a loved one or for work. If so, follow a general rule: “Don’t go far, stay in your car,” said Robert Sinclair Jr., a Northeast regional spokesman for AAA. Mr. Sinclair offered other advice. When pumping gas, sanitize your hands after replacing the pump and before you touch the car door handle, steering wheel and any other part of the vehicle. If an attendant pumped the gas for you, sanitize your credit card after it is handed back to you. Minimize bathroom breaks as much as possible. While this advice goes against AAA’s general advice to take a break every 100 miles, Mr. Sinclair said drivers could rest in vehicles at scenic overlooks or in parking lots of rest stops. Otherwise, wash your hands after using a public restroom and before touching your car. And remember: With guidelines on travel changing rapidly state by state, the rules at your starting point may be different than the rules at your destination. Read More Here’s what else to consider if you’re traveling by car. What about a national park? Can I go off into the wilderness and be alone? + It’s a tempting idea, isn’t it? To explore a national park and be away from other people. Unfortunately, it was also a popular idea. As millions of Americans were asked to stay at home, so many of them decamped to national parks that in mid-March the National Park Service ordered three of the busiest — Yellowstone, Grand Teton and the Great Smoky Mountains — to close because of congestion. What about my summer vacation? Should I cancel that? + No one really knows what the course of the outbreak will be. Some airlines have already announced cuts through May, and President Trump has mentioned isolation measures lasting through July or August. The prevailing optimistic guess among experts for when the outbreak will abate hovers at about two months. My plans got derailed. Can I get a refund? + With airlines cutting trans-Atlantic flights and cruise lines canceling sailings, travel conditions and refund policies are changing daily. Keep an eye on social media and official communications from your airline, hotel, cruise or wherever you booked to stay up to date with any changes to refund policies. And expect long wait times if you do need to contact a company. Read More Here are more answers to questions about travel. If I cancel my flight, will I get my money back? + You might! Typically, you would have to at least pay a cancellation fee or booking penalty if you did not buy a fully refundable ticket, which is usually more expensive. But many airlines, including Delta, United and American, are loosening their booking policies and suspending cancellation or rescheduling fees. Read More Here are more answers to questions about travel. What about travel insurance? + Typically, insurance companies will cover disrupted or canceled trips only under very specific circumstances. But if you purchased cancel-for-any-reason insurance for your trip, there’s a good chance you will get a good share of your money back. Be sure to read the fine print on your coverage before speaking with a representative. Read More Here are more answers to questions about travel. I can’t get my airline on the phone. What should I do? + “Obviously, the 800 numbers are overwhelmed,” said Michael Holtz, the founder and chief executive of SmartFlyer, a luxury travel agency. Many airlines in the United States have informed travelers that they could expect longer wait times to speak to a customer service agent. Some have redirected callers to their websites and their apps, or asked travelers to leave their contact information for an agent. Contacting an airline via social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook may be your best option right now. “My advice is to use technology,” he said. Read More Here are more answers to questions about travel.

<h3 id="traveling-nonstop-for-a-month-gave-me-early-exposure-to-coronavirus-panic-heres-my-advice-for-battling-stress-around-the-outbreak">Traveling nonstop for a month gave me early exposure to coronavirus panic. Here&rsquo;s my advice for battling stress around the outbreak.</h3>

Traveling internationally for a month in countries with dozens of cases of coronavirus gave me an understanding of what it is like to live in a constant state of low-grade concern about getting sick.</p>
<p>While I was never too worried about catching coronavirus, I realized I had to take action to avoid letting the constant flood of news and anxiety about the evolving situation control my life.</p>
<p>Here are six things I did to educate myself and stay safe, without letting concerns about the coronavirus outbreak take over.</p>
<p>Visit Business Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>Traveling internationally over the last five weeks, visiting four countries with confirmed cases of coronavirus, gave me a window into how different regions are responding to the outbreak.</p>
<p>It also gave me a look into what it is like to live in a state of constant low-grade coronavirus panic before similar concerns hit parts of the US.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak for people whose communities have been deeply impacted by the outbreak. None of the places I visited (including South Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand) had more than 100 confirmed cases while I was in the country. But, everywhere I went was already feeling the economic impact of the outbreak and fighting the spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p>Closely monitoring the news and swiftly changing local warnings, fielding constant concerns from friends and family, and changing plans at the last minute gave me a taste of the practical side of what it means to be in an area battling coronavirus on a smaller scale. While I learned plenty of safety tips, I also learned how to avoid letting the coronavirus take over my daily life.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t an article where I&rsquo;m going to tell you not to worry about the coronavirus. Telling people to chill out feels reductive, especially for those in jobs with less flexibility, people who are elderly, and people with preexisting conditions. At the same time, experts say that reducing stress can help reduce the chances of getting sick.</p>
<p>As the number of cases in the US swiftly grow, I&rsquo;ve heard from people who aren&rsquo;t sure what to do. This is my attempt to explain what I did to educate myself and try to stay safe, without letting the outbreak take over every aspect of my life.</p>
<p>As I prepare to head back to US, here are my six biggest takeaways on the practical realities of dealing with the panic around the coronavirus outbreak.

Coronavirus Travel Tips: To Fly Or Not To Fly? What Happens If You Cancel?</p>
<p>Enlarge this image toggle caption Bim/Getty Images Bim/Getty Images</p>
<p>How safe — or risky — is it to fly?</p>
<p>Should I cancel a trip I&rsquo;ve planned?</p>
<p>Can I come home early from my trip?</p>
<p>These are some of the questions that would-be travelers are asking in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. We talked to travel and health specialists to get answers.</p>
<p>Can I cancel a trip I&rsquo;ve booked because I&rsquo;m afraid of the coronavirus?</p>
<p>Depends on whether you bought a refundable ticket or have the right kind of travel insurance. Regular travel insurance won&rsquo;t cover a cancellation because of fears about the coronavirus outbreak. For that, you need to buy a &ldquo;Cancel for Any Reason&rdquo; (CFAR) policy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve become quite popular in the last few weeks,&rdquo; says Jonathan Breeze, CEO of AardvarkCompare, a travel insurance comparison website. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing about a 50% increase in the amount of policies being sold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few things to note: A CFAR policy typically needs to be purchased within a couple of weeks from the time you booked your trip, it will usually only cover about 75% of your costs, and New York state does not allow residents to buy CFAR policies.</p>
<p>In addition, some credit cards have automatic travel insurance for trips purchased by their cardholders. Check with your provider to see whether you would be covered.</p>
<p>How do I pick a travel insurance policy?</p>
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all policy, according to Christopher Elliott, founder of a consumer advocacy organization, Elliott Advocacy. Factors such as your age, the length of your trip and what you want covered all figure into the decision. Elliott recommends reading the insurance contract before buying to check whether it applies to &ldquo;worst-case scenarios,&rdquo; such as sickness or flight delays. See this column for more advice.</p>
<p>What if I booked a flight and want to reschedule it to avoid traveling during the outbreak?</p>
<p>Several airlines — including American, Delta, Frontier, JetBlue and United — have been waiving change fees for flights purchased between certain dates. And even if your purchase falls outside that window, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s always worth asking,&rdquo; says Seth Kaplan, transportation analyst for WBUR&rsquo;s Here &amp; Now. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re asking for an exception,&rdquo; he says — but if you&rsquo;re polite and explain your situation, you might get a break.</p>
<p>What if I want to end my trip early, say, because the outbreak has spread to a country I&rsquo;m visiting?</p>
<p>In most cases, &ldquo;somebody abroad saying, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to be here anymore,&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t covered by regular travel insurance,&rdquo; says Breeze. Again, this is where a Cancel for Any Reason policy would come in handy. With many CFAR policies, a traveler can not only recover some of the initial cost of the trip, he says, but in many cases, the policy will also cover the additional cost of coming home.</p>
<p>Is international travel riskier to my health than domestic travel?</p>
<p>It depends. Shira Doron, a hospital epidemiologist and infectious disease specialist at Tufts Medical Center, says she would not recommend traveling to countries that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has put on its &ldquo;warning&rdquo; list to avoid nonessential travel, such as China, Iran, Italy and South Korea.</p>
<p>But that doesn&rsquo;t mean domestic travel is risk-free. To put things in perspective, the virus is here, with case numbers on the rise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We already have community transmission within the United States,&rdquo; says Doron. &ldquo;So, at some point, it&rsquo;s not going to be any riskier to go to another country than it is to stay right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the virus is already out there, should I avoid plane travel just to be safe? After all, when you fly aren&rsquo;t you breathing in recycled air?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The air&rsquo;s actually pretty clean. It gets recirculated through these HEPA filters that really are very good at clearing stuff out,&rdquo; says Vicki Hertzberg, director of Emory University&rsquo;s Center for Nursing Data Science, who co-led a study on flights and disease transmission with scientists at Boeing. &ldquo;So in some aspects, the air on a plane is cleaner than what&rsquo;s going on in your new office buildings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moreover, Dr. Mark Gendreau, chief medical officer at Beverly Hospital in Massachusetts, says that airlines have a high incentive to keep their ventilation systems well-maintained: &ldquo;If the HEPA filter is not changed regularly, if the system is not maintained well, it puts a lot of drag on the engines, which will increase the fuel consumption, which is quite an expensive proposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another important thing to know: The new coronavirus is not airborne. Instead, it&rsquo;s transmitted through droplets of fluid or mucus that you cough or sneeze out, which generally don&rsquo;t travel farther than 6 feet. But if those droplets land on a surface that you later touch, you can pick up the virus that way.</p>
<p>People can help protect themselves and one another by taking precautions such as washing hands frequently, coughing into an elbow and trying not to touch eyes, nose and mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good hand hygiene is the solution,&rdquo; Doron says.</p>
<p>And not just in the bathroom. Even on the way back to your seat after a bathroom visit where you washed your hands, &ldquo;one may be touching doors, doorknobs, seats,&rdquo; says Dr. Lin Chen, president of the International Society of Travel Medicine and director of the travel medicine center at Mount Auburn Hospital in Massachusetts. So it&rsquo;s a good idea to use hand sanitizer at your seat before eating pretzels or sweeping hair from your face.</p>
<p>The CDC says your sanitizer should have at least 60% alcohol content.</p>
<p>How clean are planes anyway?</p>
<p>Airline sanitization is also something to consider. Some airlines are stepping up their cleaning game. American Airlines says it is conducting a &ldquo;more thorough cleaning of all hard surfaces&rdquo; and removing self-serve snack baskets on some international flights. Alaska Airlines says that, since March 2, it has been &ldquo;enhancing&rdquo; aircraft cleaning between flights. For planes whose schedules allow, the cleaning policy now includes seats, overhead air vents, bathroom door handles, window shades and luggage compartment handles.</p>
<p>Flights often turn around quickly, which could lead to possible lapses in the cleaning process, so Chen suggests bringing alcohol wipes to clean the areas you personally touch — including your seat belt, tray table and armrests. In a pinch, squeezing hand sanitizer onto a tissue and wiping down your armrest would probably work, she says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We really don&rsquo;t have data about how long the coronavirus survives on surfaces,&rdquo; Chen says. Other coronaviruses can last for a few hours or a few days on different materials, so for the time being, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s best to be more cautious,&rdquo; she says.</p>
