The Wizarding World just got bigger.</p>
<p>“Harry Potter” author JK Rowling has launched an online Potter hub to keep children educated and entertained during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>“Harry Potter at Home” brings together a number of resources related to the international franchise, including free access to the audiobook version of the first installment in the series.</p>
<p>“Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone” has been added to Audible’s library of free books as part of its partnership with the platform, making it immediately available in several different languages for free, and without requiring a subscription to the Amazon-owned audiobook service.</p>
<p>Other features of the hub include articles, puzzles and videos, made available by publishers Bloomsbury and Scholastic.</p>
<p>“Parents, teachers and carers working to keep children amused and interested while we’re on lockdown might need a bit of magic,” Rowling said as she announced the launch.</p>
<p>“For over twenty years now, Hogwarts has been an escape for all — for readers and fans, young and old,” the website organizers added in a post introducing the platform.</p>
<p>“During the strange times we now find ourselves in, we want to welcome you back to Hogwarts, where you will find a friendly retreat for you, your family and those you are caring for.”</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic has closed schools and workplaces and confined hundreds of millions of people around the world to their homes, leading to a surge in internet use and increased interest in a number of online tools.</p>
<p>Rowling previously announced she was relaxing copyright permissions around the “Harry Potter” series, allowing teachers to post videos of themselves reading aloud from the books for their students.

Update: 4/1/20 1:55 p.m.</p>
<p>J.K. Rowling and her Wizarding World team are making it easier for everyone to experience all things Harry Potter in the less-than-magical reality we currently face. With a project called Harry Potter At Home , everyone from longtime fans to Harry Potter newbies can add a touch of Harry Potter magic to their new daily lives.</p>
<p>Parents, teachers and carers working to keep children amused and interested while we’re on lockdown might need a bit of magic, so I’m delighted to launch https://t.co/cPg0dZpexB pic.twitter.com/i0ZjTplVoU — J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) April 1, 2020</p>
<p>“For over twenty years now, Hogwarts has been an escape for all – for readers and fans, young and old,” the Wizarding World team wrote on the website. “During the strange times we now find ourselves in, we want to welcome you back to Hogwarts, where you will find a friendly retreat for you, your family and those you are caring for.”</p>
<p>The digital hub houses magical craft videos, quizzes, fun articles, and puzzles. That’s not all, though. In partnership with Audible, people can listen to the first Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, as many times as they want in the coming weeks for free. The first book will also be free for select libraries to borrow as an eBook or audiobook. Bonus: You can sign up for a Harry Potter At Home newsletter to stay updated on their latest news and activities.</p>
<p>Well, what are you waiting for? Go check out the magic. Learn how to draw a niffler or put your Harry Potter knowledge to the test .</p>

<p>Teachers who want their students to experience the magic of Harry Potter through the books that started it all can still make that happen during social isolation, thanks to a decision by J.K. Rowling. The author is relaxing copyright permissions in order to allow teachers to post videos of themselves reading the Harry Potter books aloud. The temporary open license aims to support educators who are providing home study for students during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Until the end of the school year, teachers can post videos of themselves reading any and all of the seven Harry Potter books. They must be posted “onto schools’ secure networks or closed educational platforms,” according to the announcement . The videos can’t be posted on social platforms like YouTube. Other guidelines include displaying the book cover and not changing any of the text when reading the books, if possible.</p>
<p>Delighted to help teachers reach kids at home by relaxing the usual licence required to post videos of themselves reading Harry Potter books. Go to https://t.co/77d90pkiYK to find the guidelines. Be well, everyone. More soon! 💫#HarryPotterAtHome — J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) March 20, 2020</p>
<p>“Delighted to help teachers reach kids at home by relaxing the usual license required to post videos of themselves reading Harry Potter books,&rdquo; J.K. Rowling wrote in a tweet regarding the news. &ldquo;Be well, everyone. More soon! #HarryPotterAtHome.”</p>
<p>J.K. Rowling and her literary agency, The Blair Partnership, “recognise the importance of sharing story time and reading aloud in times of adversity,” according to the video guidelines . The open license is sure to bring a bit of magic into the homes of children all over.</p>
