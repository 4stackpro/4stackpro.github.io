<p>In Photos: From Maanav in Pavitra Rishta to Annirudh in Chhichhore, roles that defined Sushant Singh Rajput 1 12 Tracing Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s life in films Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s tryst with the camera began with a chance sighting. Ekta Kapoor&rsquo;s casting team spotted him in a play by Nadira Babbar&rsquo;s theatre company and invited him to audition for a show. It set the ball rolling on the then-aspiring hero&rsquo;s career. A look: Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil (2008) Sushant made his television debut as Preet Juneja on this show. The character was killed early on, but was brought back as a spirit for the series finale, owing to his popularity. Pavitra Rishta (2009) The next year, he landed the lead role of Manav Deshmukh in the hit show, widely considered to be his breakout role and a stepping stone to films. While working on this Ekta Kapoor production, he also met his future girlfriend, Ankita Lokhande, who played the female lead. Kai Po Che! (2013) After participating in two dance-based reality shows— Zara Nachke Dikha 2 and Jhalak Dikhhla Ja 4—Sushant auditioned for this Abhishek Kapoor directorial, and bagged one of the three lead roles alongside Rajkummar Rao and Amit Sadh. His portrayal of former district-level cricketer Ishaan Bhatt, who falls prey to politics in the selection process, in the critical and commercial success earned him raves. Shuddh Desi Romance (2013) Sushant followed it up with this Maneesh Sharma-directed Parineeti Chopra and Vaani Kapoor co-starrer. The romance comedy-drama was set in Jaipur and revolved around youngsters’ take on love and live-in relationships. PK (2014) In Rajkumar Hirani’s satirical comedy-drama led by Aamir Khan and Anushka Sharma, Sushant had a brief yet notable role. Detective Byomkesh Bakshy (2015) Dibakar Banerjee’s mystery thriller featured the actor in the titular role, a character created by Bengali writer Sharanindu Bandopadhyay. Set in the Kolkata of the 1940s, the film was reportedly to get a sequel with Sushant reprising his role. MS Dhoni: The Untold Story (2016) Neeraj Pandey’s biographical drama that traces the journey of the eponymous former Indian skipper-wicket keeper saw Sushant take on another titular role. The film, which also featured Kiara Advani and Disha Patani, secured for Sushant his first Filmfare Best Actor nomination the following year. Raabta (2017) In Dinesh Vijan’s directorial debut, a reincarnation-themed romance actioner, Sushant was paired opposite Kriti Sanon and the duo played star-crossed lovers. The film featured Jim Sarbh, Rajkumar Yadav and Varun Dharma in supporting roles. Kedarnath (2018) The actor reunited with Abhishek ‘Gattu’ Kapoor to headline Sara Ali Khan’s launch vehicle. The inter-faith love story was set against the backdrop of the pilgrim site and revolved around a Muslim boy who falls in love with a rich Brahmin girl. Sonchiriya (2019) Co-written and directed by Abhishek Chaubey, the film is set in the Chambal ravines of 1975 and tells the story of a group of dacoits. It also featured Manoj Bajpayee, Bhumi Pednekar, Ranvir Shorey and Ashutosh Rana. Chhichhore (2019) Sushant followed it up with one of the biggest successes of his career with this Nitesh Tiwari-directed campus comedy-drama. The film won five Filmfare nods, including Best Film and Best Director. It was also Sushant’s last theatrical release.</p>

<p>Mumbai</p>
<p>ByOne of the sharpest inquisitive thoughts when a person in the limelight meets his end is what was the last thing on their mind. In the case of 34-year-oldit would be his last Instagram post where he put up a picture of his mother with a caption stating, ‘Blurred past evaporating from teardrops, unending dreams carving an arc of smile, and a fleeting life, negotiating between the two…’. These lines were being dissected and analysed through Sunday by a multitude of people – the talented star’s fans as well as colleagues in the film industry.It’s what happens when one is compelled to accept the unexpected. In his seven-year-old career in the movies, which he chose over engineering, Rajput rode the crest with films like!, Shuddh Desi Romance, Detective Byomkesh Bakshi, MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, Kedarnath and Chhichhore. He had just about come into his element; and one looked forward to more.The actor allegedly died of suicide in his sixth floor residence in Mount Blanc on Carter Road, Bandra, which he shared with art designer Siddharth Pithani, on Sunday morning. He was found hanging in his bedroom by a member of his house staff. On June 9, Rajput’s former manager Disha Salian had allegedly jumped to her death from her Malad residence; it is speculated over financial matters. While an inquiry into Rajput’s death has been instituted, cops have found no connection between the two.He woke up at 6.30 am on Sunday whereupon he was served a glass of pomegranate juice. Subsequently, he went into his bedroom. An hour later when one of the members of his staff knocked at his door wanting to enquire about the lunch menu &ndash; he received no response. He continued the act intermittently but on receiving no response the house staff and his flat mate summoned Rajput’s sister. On her arrival, together they broke into his room to find him hanging from the ceiling with a bedsheet.He was taken towhere he was declared dead. There was no suicide note. The post-mortem report is awaited.The Unit IX of crime branch will scrutinise Rajput’s mobile phone record. His staff – two cooks and a housekeeper who stayed in the flat – are being interrogated, along with neighbours and relatives. Rajput shifted to this rental accommodation six months ago and was supposed stay on till 2022. He was paying Rs 4.5 lakh in the rent.A decade ago when Rajput’s then roommate and friend TV actor Manav Verma turned to him during a low patch, the actor had advised, “If you ever feel low in life, go and sit on the rocks at Versova Beach and talk to the waves gushing in and just stare into the sea.” The two began their careers with Ekjute theatre group before Rajput made his TV debut in Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil. The two would often go down to Andheri station in the middle of the night to share a smoke and sip on tea, when things were not so smooth. For someone “as motivated and passionate as Sushant”, Verma is yet to come to terms with the fact that his friend could resort to such extreme measures.Fellow actor Amir Ali says Rajput’s “main aim in life was to be happy”. “He would say, ‘My career will sort itself out. If things don’t work out, I can always return to television’. And when I’d nudge him to buy a house, he’d brush me off saying, he would rather have cars and bikes instead. He had his own fundas and was happy with it,” remembers Ali.However, recently, when Rajput’s fitness trainer of four years, Samee Ahmed, spoke to the late actor on June 1 when the actor had called to convey his condolences to Ahmed on his mother’s death, he “sounded moved because he looked up to my mom”. Rajput had then revealed, ‘I know how it feels when one loses one’s mother because my mother passed away when I was 16. It’s a terrible time but I am there if you need anything or just someone to talk to’.Ahmed also shares that the actor had stopped working out following a bout of dengue last December and he feels that “things began declining for him ever since&rdquo;. “He told me that he didn’t feel like going out much. He had taken up yoga and would go for occasional walks,” Ahmed said.Verma, who had lost touch with the Rajput since he had shifted into his Bandra residence, adds, “When one becomes a star, their priorities change and so do their friends. But Sushant remained the same, and every time we’ve met over the years, we picked up from where we had left off.” He does have a grouse with Rajput, however. “I am also a bit angry about this because the opportunity he got is something lakhs of people only dream of. We’ve shared a time when we didn’t have money for our next meal. If he was still in touch with me, I would have reminded him of how fortunate he was,” laments Verma.Rajput was a star-gazer with a bucket list that went beyond Bollywood; he was interested in the mysteries of the universe and loved looking at the skies through his Meade 14” LX600 telescope when not working on a movie set. Last year, the actor had shared his bucket list of 50 dreams with his fans on Twitter, where among other things, he talked about visiting faraway places, painting aurora lights, writing a book and getting a selfie with his favourite star Robert Downey Jr.Sushant Singh Rajput&hellip;a bright young actor gone too soon. He excelled on TV and in films. His rise in the world of entertainment inspired many and he leaves behind several memorable performances. Shocked by his passing away. My thoughts are with his family and fans. Om Shanti.He loved me so much&hellip;I will miss him so much. His energy, enthusiasm and his full happy smile. May Allah bless his soul and my condolences to his near and dear ones. This is extremely sad&hellip;. and so shocking!!This is heartbreaking&hellip;.I have such strong memories of the times we have shared&hellip; I can’t believe this&hellip; Rest in peace my friend&hellip;When the shock subsides, only the best memories will remain.Shocked to hear about Sushant Singh Rajput. This is so difficult to process. May his soul RIP and may god give all the strength to his family and friends.An effortlessly talented actor who will always be remembered. Rest in peace.I have no words, no understanding of why you left the way you did. From a bright young kid who came to Balaji to a star who made the Nation swoon… You had come a long way and had many more miles to go. You will be missed #SushantSinghRajput.

<p><img src="https://img.manoramaonline.com/content/dam/mm/en/entertainment/entertainment-news/images/2020/6/15/sushant-soba-silk-smitha-suicide.jpg" alt="img">
The curse of suicide has haunted the showbiz since time immemorial with the likes of iconic actor-director Guru Dutt, South star Shoba, Silk Smitha, actor Jiah Khan and now Bollywood star Sushant Singh Rajput giving up on life in the Indian film industry known for being harsh and demanding of its stars.</p>
<p>Known for films like &ldquo;Kai Po Che!&quot;, &ldquo;MS Dhoni: The Untold Story&rdquo;, &ldquo;Chhichhore&rdquo;, Rajput was found hanging at his Bandra home, the police said on Sunday. He was 34.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: Shocking suicides: Actors who stunned us with their sudden exits</p>
<p>Rajput&rsquo;s last screen appearance was Nitesh Tiwari&rsquo;s 2019 film Chhichhore. And his last social media post, dedicated to his late mother who died in 2002 when he was a young teen, was on June 3, a foretelling perhaps on what to come.</p>
<p>Rajput&rsquo;s sudden death comes days after his former manager, 28-year-old Disha Salian, ended her life by jumping from a high rise building on June 9.</p>
<p>Guru Dutt, known for black-and-white classics like &ldquo;Kaagaz Ke Phool&rdquo;, &ldquo;Baazi&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Pyaasa&rdquo;, was found dead on October 10, 1964 in his bed in his rented apartment at Pedder Road in erstwhile Bombay. He was 39. The filmmaker, whose real name was Vasanth Kumar Shivashankar Padukone, was said to have been mixing alcohol and sleeping pills.</p>
<p>Dutt&rsquo;s death may have been suicide or just an accidental overdose. His son, Arun Dutt, considered the death to be an accident.</p>
<p>Guru Dutt</p>
<p>South star Mahalakshmi Menon, best known by her stagename Shoba committed suicide at the age of 17. She got herself a National Award for Best Actress for the film Pasi and on May 1, 1980, she was found to have killed herself in her house in Chennai, then Madras. The manner of Shoba’s death, however, still remains cloaked in mystery.</p>
<p>Four years after Shoba died, her mother Prema who was also an actress too killed herself. KG George&rsquo;s 1983 film Lekhayude Maranam – Oru Flashback is said to be loosely based on her life.</p>
<p>Actor Vijaylakshmi, who reached the iconic status of a sex symbol in Tamil cinema during her time, as Silk Smitha died at the age of 33 as the result of a suspected suicide in 1996. She appeared in over 200 films, including &ldquo;Vandichakkaram&rdquo;, &ldquo;Moondru Mugam&rdquo;, a most sought after actor at a time was said to be neck deep in controversies.</p>
<p>Silk Smitha</p>
<p>She was immortalised on screen in the 2011 film &ldquo;The Dirty Picture&rdquo;, starring Vidya Balan as Silk. The Milan Luthria-directed film, which showed the highs and lows of the dancing star, was inspired by the actor&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Former Miss India and video jockey Nafisa Joseph was found hanging at her residence in Versova in 2004 at the age of 25.</p>
<p>Joseph, who won the Miss India title in 1997, had worked as a model and had been involved in activities related to animal rights.</p>
<p>In 2006, model-turned television actor Kuljeet Randhawa, known for starring in high-school drama &ldquo;Hip Hip Hurray!&quot;, suspense serial &ldquo;Kohinoor&rdquo; and crime thriller drama &ldquo;Special Squad&rdquo;, allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself in her single room apartment in suburban Juhu. She was 25.</p>
<p>Kunal Singh, best known for starring opposite actor Sonali Bendre in the 1999 Tamil romance film &ldquo;Kadhalar Dhinam&rdquo;, was found hanging from the ceiling fan in his Mumbai apartment in 2008. He was 30.</p>
<p>Jiah Khan</p>
<p>British-American actor Jiah Khan, best known for films like &ldquo;Nishabd&rdquo; with megastar Amitabh Bachchan and &ldquo;Ghajini&rdquo; with Aamir Khan, was found hanging at her Mumbai residence on June 3, 2013 by her mother Rabiya Khan. Khan was 25.</p>
<p>It was deemed a suicide and reconfirmed as a suicide in 2016 following an extensive investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and a hearing at the Bombay High Court.</p>
<p>Khan&rsquo;s mother blamed her boyfriend, actor Sooraj Pancholi, for her death. He was charged with abetting Khan&rsquo;s suicide. The case has not yet been settled.</p>
<p>Last year, actor Kushal Punjabi, who appeared in films such as &ldquo;Kaal&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lakshya&rdquo; as well as the reality show &ldquo;Fear Factor&rdquo;, was found hanging in his Bandra apartment. He was 42.</p>
<p>Punjabi, whose body was found by his parents in the wee hours of December 27, left behind a suicide note in which he said nobody should be held responsible for his death.

<p>Sushant Singh Rajput had put up a moving post just last week when his former manager Disha Salian was found dead. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s such devastating news,&rdquo; the actor had written on Instagram.</p>
<p>His last post on Instagram was dedicated to his mother, whose death in 2002 left him devastated. &ldquo;Blurred past evaporating from teardrops, unending dreams carving an arc of smile And a fleeting life, negotiating between the two,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>

<p>Actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death should be investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Jan Adhikar Party chief Pappu Yadav demanded on Monday.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput, who dropped out of an engineering college to pursue a career in Bollywood and delivered several hit films over the past decade, was found dead in his apartment in Mumbai on Sunday. He was 34.</p>
<p>Dattatreya Bargude, an assistant commissioner of Mumbai Police, confirmed the actor’s death and said that no “note” was found at his residence.</p>
<p>“I cannot imagine how this happened. I request the government to launch a CBI inquiry. I think there is a deep conspiracy behind his death. Sushant cannot commit suicide,” Pappu Yadav told reporters.</p>
<p>“I want a CBI inquiry in the matter. Sushant was a workaholic and good man, not the kind of person that would commit suicide. He rose from the bottom. Made Bihar proud. Now the state of Bihar is in mourning,” he added.</p>
<p>Yadav also claimed that it could be a case of homicide.</p>
<p>Rajput was born in Bihar’s capital of Patna and was the youngest of five children of a government employee. He completed his schooling in Delhi before securing a seat in an engineering college in the Capital in 2003.</p>
<p>He dropped out of the course to pursue acting professionally three years later and joined the Barry John Acting School.</p>
<p>The actor landed his first role in the Hindi serial, Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil, in 2008 but gained popularity the next year with his character in the popular soap, Pavitra Rishta.</p>
<p>He debuted in Bollywood in 2013 with the movie Kai Po Che!, adapted from a novel by Chetan Bhagat but became a household name with the success of MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, a biopic on the World Cup-winning Indian cricket captain, in 2016.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput was last seen in Nitesh Tiwari’s Chhichhore in 2019 and also acted in the thriller Drive that was released on Netflix the same year.</p>
