<h3 id="why-kashmiri-pandits-may-never-return-to-the-valley">&ldquo;Why Kashmiri Pandits may never return to the Valley&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://d2c7ipcroan06u.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/KashmirPundit1895BritishLibrary.jpg" alt="img">
Text Size: A- A+</p>
<p>On 2 August this year, the government of Jammu and Kashmir (under President’s rule) cancelled the annual Amarnath Yatra. There were “intelligence inputs of terror threats, with specific targeting of the Amarnath Yatra,” it said. The security situation must have been really, really bad because this was the first time the Amarnath Yatra was cancelled altogether.</p>
<p>Yet, the security situation was good enough for the Narendra Modi government to make Article 370 null and void, as also Article 35A, divide the state into two union territories and place hundreds of pro-India political actors in jail.</p>
<p>The contradiction leaves you with the conclusion that the Modi government was in a political hurry to radically change the constitutional status of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, and such was the tearing hurry that it cancelled the Amarnath Yatra. Yet no Hindu — absolutely no one— seems to have cried hoarse about the hurt to Hindu sentiments. Imagine a Congress government cancelling the Amarnath Yatra for political expedience.</p>
<p>Similarly, the political discourse around the issue of Kashmiri Pandits is replete with political hypocrisy.</p>
<p>A video has emerged recently of Sandeep Chakravorty, India’s Consul General in New York, addressing what seems to be a private gathering of Kashmiri Pandits. For the record, he says his remarks have been taken “out of context,” which is what people say after putting their foot in their mouth.</p>
<p>Chakravorty makes a number of assertions that are either factually wrong, or show no understanding of the history and culture of Kashmir.</p>
<p>Let us take them one by one.</p>
<p>Also read: Indian consul general in US suggests Israel model for Kashmiri Pandits’ return, kicks up row</p>
<p>Non-existent refugee ‘camps’</p>
<p>First, he says, “I believe in our lifetime we will have our land back, our people will have to go back, because not everybody can live in the United States. Our Kashmiri Pandit brethren are living in camps, in Jammu, in Delhi, on the streets…”</p>
<p>A lie repeated a thousand times becomes the truth. So, it is possible that Sandeep Chakravorty genuinely believes Kashmiri Pandits are still living in camps and on the streets. If facts mattered, that is not the case. In both Jammu and in Delhi, they have been moved into proper houses. And most of it has happened under Congress regimes. People would have known more about it if the Congress knew how to tom-tom its achievements like the BJP.</p>
<p>Yet, the word “camps” will be repeated ad nauseam because how else do you claim continuing victimhood? Take for instance this report by Pooja Shali in India Today, which says, “Kashmiri Pandits living in the Jagti refugee camp appreciated PM Modi-led government’s decision to revoke the state’s special status.” The deliberate yet subtle falsehood here is to describe Jagti as a camp and not a ‘township’. You can see here a photo of the entrance to the Jagti apartments. For anyone who doesn’t understand what a camp is, here is a photo of how the Pandits once lived in camps.</p>
<p>Similarly, Pandit refugees in Delhi have been given flats. One could argue about the size and upkeep of the flats given to them, but if facts matter, they are not camps. And no one is certainly living on the streets.</p>
<p>Also read: Why Kashmiri Pandits can’t return to the Valley, even if they want to</p>
<p>An exaggerated fear</p>
<p>Now that we are clear about the difference between flats and camps, let us tackle another claim by Mr Chakravorty. The claim is that Pandits are not returning to the Kashmir Valley because of fear. He says in the video, “You will not go because of fear of life, but I think that fear will go away.”</p>
<p>If Kashmiri Pandit refugees are unable to return to live in Kashmir due to fear, how is it that 808 Kashmiri Pandit families (or around 3-4,000 people) still live in the Valley in 292 different locations? That’s the count done by the Srinagar-based Sanjay Tickoo of the Kashmiri Pandit Sangharsh Samiti. If fear is the reason, how is it that thousands of Kashmiri Pandits visit the Valley, on holidays and personal trips, or for pilgrimages such as the annual Kheer Bhawani festival in Tulmulla?</p>
<p>Cruel and inhuman as the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits was, being a refugee is a complicated matter. Kashmiri Pandit refugees may be able to physically relocate to their old homes, but they can’t go back in time. A resilient, educated, well-connected community, the Pandit refugees have got education and jobs and are now spread across India and the world. Would a Kashmiri Pandit refugee’s son or daughter working in a corporate job want to return to the family home in the old city of Srinagar? Why would someone leave a corporate job in Mumbai unless they could find an equivalent job in Srinagar?</p>
<p>Arvind Gigoo is a retired English lecturer from Kashmir, now living in a flat in Jammu with his wife. He moved to Jammu after the exodus in 1991. Over several meetings in Jammu and Delhi between 2010-2012, I asked him why he never thought of returning and living in his home in Srinagar. He explained that his friends were now all in Jammu. It’s the same reason why he doesn’t live with his son in Delhi, the writer Siddhartha Gigoo. When Arvind Gigoo went back to Srinagar after many years, he felt like an outsider, because he didn’t know anyone anymore. People migrate and die, and so on. The young look at a Pandit speaking in Kashmiri like an oddity from a mythical past. But the most important reason he couldn’t imagine going back to living in Srinagar was comfort. The old house, the old way of living, the old kind of toilets, the dirty old lanes. He was comfortable living in a more modern house in Jammu. He eventually sold the Srinagar house — something many Pandits did.</p>
<p>So, when we speak of the “return” of Pandits, it is not a physical relocation we need to think of. Pandits cannot return to a Kashmir that is pre-1989, because it does not exist anymore.</p>

<p>Israel model vs Indian model</p>
<p>Now that we have debunked the myth of security fears preventing Pandits from returning to the Valley, let us look at Sandeep Chakravorty’s Israel model that drew applause from the audience. This model basically implies creating a special enclave for Pandits. So, there could be a Hindu Kashmir and a Muslim Kashmir, physically demarcated, because we haven’t been making Mohammed Ali Jinnah proud enough already.</p>
<p>The idea is an old one, it used to be known as “Panun Kashmir”. Interestingly, the BJP never endorsed it, though one doesn’t know what the BJP of Modi-Shah thinks. The removal of Article 35A has so far not been followed up with any reassurance that the Modi government will not settle Indians in the Kashmir Valley.</p>
<p>So, if the plan is to bring about a demographic change in the Valley (you never know these days, hare-brained ideas are in excess supply), then the Israel model is not what we are looking at. Instead, we are looking at the China model.</p>
<p>And yet, there is an Indian model we have forgotten. This model died in Kashmir the day Jawaharlal Nehru had Sheikh Abdullah arrested, and maybe it’s too late to revive it. The Indian model is one of “integration”. The only meaningful way Kashmiri Pandits could “return” to Kashmir is if the wall of suspicion and mistrust between Pandits and Muslims was brought down. This could be done through a South Africa-style truth and reconciliation exercise.</p>
<p>But the Modi establishment doesn’t seem to think the sentiments, feelings, aspirations of Kashmiri Muslims matter. There is no reconciliation on offer of any kind.</p>
<p>Also read: Kashmiri Pandits in US decry unfair coverage, protest outside The Washington Post office</p>
<p>‘Kashmir culture is the Hindu culture’</p>
<p>For an Indian diplomat, Sandeep Chakravorty is embarrassingly ill-informed. He betrays his ignorance of Kashmir when he says, “We all have to keep the Kashmiri culture alive. The Kashmiri culture is the Indian culture is the Hindu culture. I feel as much Kashmiri as anybody else.”</p>
<p>To know what Kashmiri culture is/was, he should Google and read up why a Kashmiri Muslim family is at the centre of the Amarnath Yatra. He could read a few books on the now-discredited idea of Kashmiriyat, of syncretism in the Valley. No, Kashmiri, Hindu, and Indian are not the same thing. They could co-exist, if only people like Sandeep Chakravorty understood the beauty of the Nehruvian idea of unity in diversity rather than follow in Jinnah’s footsteps.</p>

Did you know that South Okanagan in the province of British Colombia is a becoming the next destination for foodies? Ever tried the Nepali-Indian fusion cuisine?</p>
<p>Meet Keshab Sapkota and Ram Bhandari, immigrants from Nepal and successful entrepreneurs, who have made Penticton, a small city in the Okanagan Valley, their home.</p>
<p>Both came to the Valley a few years ago and started off by cooking at various restaurants. At the same time, they made a connection with the South Okanagan Immigrant and Community Services (SOICS) – a settlement agency helping immigrants to the South Okanagan. With help from the agency, they upgraded their language skills and built their networks by participating in community events.</p>
<p>While they settled into their new jobs and into their new home, Keshab and Ram continued nursing a dream of creating their own, unique restaurant where they could use the unique culinary skills they had learned in their mothers’ kitchens and through years of training.</p>
<p>With determination and through continued efforts, they made their dream a reality. Annapurna Restaurant opened in early 2019 on Penticton’s Main Street and, since then, people who try the delicious food keep coming back. Today, SOICS is also one of their devoted clients.</p>
<p>The restaurant offers a delicious fusion of Nepali and Indian cuisines inspired by the blend of Tibetan, Indian and Chinese cultures present in Nepal. These complex and flavourful dishes are made to satisfy both vegetarians and meat lovers. Moreover, since each dish is prepared from scratch using fresh ingredients, the Annapurna team can make your meal without gluten, lactose or nuts.</p>
<p>Besides being the name of the famous mountain range in the Himalayas boasting a peak of over 8,000 meters, for Hindus, Annapurna is the “universal and timeless kitchen goddess” and the goddess of food and nourishment.</p>
<p>There is a small community of four or five Nepalese families in the valley that get together for the holidays to share food and good times. Two of Ram’s sisters own their own restaurants – one in West Kelowna called “Everest” and the other in Vernon named “The Curry Pot”, both well loved by the locals.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of things we truly value about our life in Canada but if we had to pick one it would be the protection of human rights allowing you to be who you want to be,” say Sapkota and Bhandari.</p>
<p>“We used to be job seekers but now we are job creators,” Keshab adds with a smile. The two friends now employ up to five staff, depending on the season, and are proud of being able to contribute to the local economy.</p>
<p>The restaurant named for the “universal and timeless kitchen goddess” has two great sons that will not let you leave hungry.</p>

India under the governance of Vajpayee had witnessed major historic events like in May 1998, India conducted underground nuclear tests in Rajasthan&rsquo;s Pokhran desert. The tests were held just a month after the government had been in power. The victory of three-month-long Kargil War bolstered the image of Vajpayee and he was hailed across the country for his bold and strong leadership. ​Good old days Jyoti Basu, Atal Bihari Vajpayee and George Fernandez share a light moment at a rally in Kolkata in 1986.

Former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee shared a special connection with Lucknow, representing the Uttar Pradesh capital in the Lok Sabha for five consecutive terms. On August 5, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, who is the current MP from Lucknow, hailed him for setting in flow a &ldquo;river of development&rdquo; in the city.

Atal Bihari Vajpayee: A man untainted by corruption scandals A file pic of Atal Bihari Vajpayee on his way from airport to Raj Bhawan. The one thing both sides could agree on was his honesty. Vajpayee was that rare thing in Indian politics: a man untainted by corruption scandals. Former Indian PM Vajpayee dies after illness at age 93 A file pic of A B Vajpayee addressing at election campaign in Mangalore. A onetime journalist, Vajpayee was in many ways a political contradiction: He was the moderate leader of an often-strident Hindu nationalist movement. He was a lifelong poet who revered nature but who oversaw India&rsquo;s growth into a swaggering regional economic power. He was the prime minister who ordered nuclear tests in 1998, stoking fears of atomic war between India and Pakistan. Then, a few years later, it was Vajpayee who made the first moves toward peace.

I never misused it. He used to respect our suggestions&rdquo;, Naidu said describing Vajpayee as a great secular leader.He recalled how Vajpayee as prime minister had resolved issues concerning the undivided Andhra Pradesh. &ldquo;His name will remain eternally in Indian history,&rdquo; Naidu said.

Hence, they would follow his ideals and not declare a holiday.&ldquo;I am deeply saddened by the passing away of Sh. Atal Bihari Vajpayee.Shri Vajpayee was a towering figure in our national life. Throughout his life, he stood for democratic values and demonstrated this commitment in all his acts, whether as a parliamentarian, a cabinet minister, or. He was a spell-binding orator, a leader of great vision, a patriot to the core for whom the national interest was paramount. But above all, he was a man with a very large heart and a real spirit of magnanimity. One saw that in all his interactions &ndash; with other political parties and their leaders, with foreign governments, with coalition partners, and indeed with his own political colleagues, whom he always treated with respect and courtesy.His warm personality and his gift of friendship won him admirers and friends across the political spectrum and from every walk of life.

On many occasions, be it against Emergency or for Kashmir at UN or taking a stand during the Bangladesh war or propogation of the Hindi language, he has always worked in the directions of giving solutions. He hasn&rsquo;t just worked as a BJP leader, but for the overall development. We will fulfil the party&rsquo;s mission. From 9.30 pm, Atal ji mortal remains will be at his residence. From 7.30-8.30 am, he will be here. At 9 am, his mortal remains will be taken to BJP headquarters. At 1 pm, his final journey will begin and at 4 pm, his last rites will be performed.

His leadership, foresight, maturity&amp;eloquence put him in a league of his own. Atalji, the Gentle Giant,will be missed by one &amp; all.&ldquo;Ashok Tandon said, &ldquo;The great Messiah of humanity has gone. It&rsquo;s a big loss to the entire Indian political system. He worked relentlessly for the backward, needy and under privileged. He believed in Gandhian socialism. He was a great soul, human being.&ldquo;Pratibha Patil: Great man. Different politician. A unique combination of politician and poet with a clever mindJ&amp;K leader Farooq Abdullah said, &ldquo;He was a great man that this motherland produced. A kind hearty and noble soul. He wanted to see everyone grow. He was the man who saw a different vision of India. His appeal was for peace, not only for India, but universally. When he went to Pakistan, he said to people of Pakistan that I represent the one billion Indians. During Pokhra, he said that this is not to attack anyone but to show we have power. He was a noble soul to this nation.Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad told Times Now, &ldquo;Inspired from the fact that he was a great leader of the BJP. Yet, people from other parties would confide in him. From 1991 to 1996, when he was leader of Opposition, I had to run the Parliament without any majority. To run a government without a strong coalition, you need a person like Vajpayee. He was a great orator. I have always attended his speeches, even as a student. He was anti-Congress, but he would never hit below the belt. I have seen his speeches. They attacked on political differences, but not personal attacks.: Rashtriya Smriti near Rajghat to be Atal Bihari Vajpayee&rsquo;s final resting place.: Narendra Modi said, &ldquo;I have no words, I am filled with emotions right now. Our respected Atal ji is no more. Every moment of his life he had dedicated to the nation.&quot;: &ldquo;Worried about Former PM Vajpayee jis health. He and his family are in my thoughts and prayers. Can never forget the love and affection he showered upon me every time we met,&rdquo; J&amp;K leader Mehbooba Mufti.: BJP has postponed its two-day national executive, slated for August 18-19&quot;Atal ji’s more than 50 years in public life has been a remarkable journey. He was a Mahamanav. In 1968. in Mehsana. I remember during a public meeting. the lights went off and the audience stood there. Some people brought in their cars into the venue and switched on the car headlights for the meeting. Such was his pull.Atal ji never surrendered to death. He was a humanist and had heart of a poet. He respected all religions, never spread venom against Christianity and Islam. His bus tour to Lahore was his sincere effort to forge a relationship of friendship with Pakistan.When I separated from the BJP, Atal ji called me in the evening and said, &ldquo;This was necessary. What I could not do you did. He asked me whatever you want, tell me. I said I don&rsquo;t want anything Atal ji.&ldquo;He remarked once that Indira ji was like Durga . He had excellent relations with Nehru and Indira ji. Everyone listened to him in the Opposition.Atalji has lived as a communist in his early political life and then joined RSS. Such versatility is rarely witnessed in a political leader. He also had a streak of Gandhian socialismWhen Godhra happened, Atal ji was very sad. He had said, ‘Rajdharma Nibhao’ (carry out your national duty). He had gone to Shah Alam relief camp and was pained on seeing the misery and suffering.&quot;: Congress general secretary Ashok Gehlot and Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee president Raj Babbar reach AIIMS: Bihar CM Nitish Kumar, Deputy CM Sushil Modi and Bihar Minister Nand Kishore Yadav arrive at AIIMS“We all should pray for his recovery.

He wanted peace not only in our country but the whole world,” said National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah“People in India and outside are praying for him. Entire country loves him.

Their personal bonding was one of the reasons why the BJP-Sena alliance stayed strong for decades. It would be natural for Uddhav ji to visit the former prime minister to check on his health,&rdquo; a source close to Thackeray said.

Today, I&rsquo;m in the Opposition and people expect me to speak like an opponent. But I can&rsquo;t. I only want to talk about what he did for me,&rdquo; Vajpayee had said, grieving Gandhi&rsquo;s deathSince independence, therefore, a vital touchstone for judging Government of India’s handling of external affairs has been its Pakistan Policy. Only a government confident of itself could have responded to all this in the manner in which Vajpayee did. He first had the Army use its full might to quell the Kargil operation, which was the General’s own adventure. And he followed it up by another brave move : an invitation to the General for talks at Agra. It was this firm stand that made the General ultimately discard his Agra attitude and at Islamabad in January 2004 sign a joint statement with Vajpayee that “he will not permit any territory under Pakistan’s control to be used to support terrorism in any manner ”.
