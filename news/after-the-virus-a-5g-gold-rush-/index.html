Such choices &ldquo;will help ensure the Company is well positioned when the pandemic passes and economies begin to recover,&rdquo; AT&amp;T added.</p>
<p>Connectivity is having a moment in a hunkered-down nation, with every Skyped play date and Slacked workplace conversation calling new attention to the benefits of ubiquitous internet adoption, even at existing 4G or slower speeds. That can only fuel a hunger for bigger, faster, more abundant broadband — a demand that may aid the wireless industry’s quest for assistance in clearing away regulatory obstacles.</p>
<p>“Now’s a time when everybody’s seeing you need it,” Jonathan Adelstein, a former FCC commissioner who leads the Wireless Infrastructure Association, told POLITICO. “It really is opening people’s eyes hopefully to how important this is. And when we get 5G, it’s going to be even more exciting.”</p>
<p>Trump drove home that message in a conference call Tuesday with companies including AT&amp;T, Verizon, Comcast and Charter Communications, thanking them for keeping the country running. &ldquo;With business at a level that nobody&rsquo;s seen it before on the internet, it’s holding up incredibly well and they expect that to continue no matter what happens and no matter how much more it gains,&rdquo; Trump told reporters at a briefing that evening.</p>
<p>That’s a departure from the criticism that Trump and his allies have leveled at some of the same companies, such as his campaign manager&rsquo;s accusations that Verizon is wildly overstating its 5G service in the U.S.</p>
<p>For now, the giant communications companies haven’t received any special share of the trillions in economic rescue dollars that Capitol Hill is doling out in response to the pandemic, although they could benefit indirectly from $200 million provided for the Federal Communications Commission&rsquo;s telehealth programs. (The bill also provided millions of dollars to support long-running Agriculture Department broadband subsidy efforts.) But the industry has sought Washington’s assistance in expediting wireless buildout by sidestepping some of the required state and local regulatory approvals — a proposal that Senate Republicans privately pushed for during Congress’ recent stimulus negotiations, one GOP congressional source told POLITICO.</p>
<p>A fourth round of virus-related stimulus spending could include hundreds of millions to help bolster online learning endeavors, something Republicans floated during the negotiations for the most recent bill. Democrats had proposed several billion dollars for similar efforts as well as money dedicated to helping keep low-income Americans digitally connected.</p>
<p>The industry is also making efforts to win the good graces of consumers in need. Cisco, which makes the wireless switches and routers that much of the internet runs on, has pledged $225 million to help with global recovery efforts. AT&amp;T created a $10 million fund aimed at helping families and teachers with remote learning tools. Verizon and T-Mobile are expanding more affordable calling plans, while hundreds of large and small internet service providers have pledged not to cut off consumers struggling with the pandemic, even those who cannot pay their bills right away, and some communications companies have waived policies capping data usage.</p>
<p>The wireless industry has also spent years touting its investments in U.S. communications architecture — $275 billion for next-generation wireless, according to one popular industry estimate — and says 5G will create spill-over effects to a broader connected economy, generating new jobs and stimulating commerce.</p>
<p>And as a record-breaking 3 million employees applied for unemployment benefits last week, the companies building 5G have said they are facing an enormous shortage of skilled labor. The industry for months has sought millions of dollars in government assistance in training workers more quickly, something it says could benefit both the telecom companies and the many newly laid-off workers.</p>
<p>Wireless providers are also embroiled in lobbying fights with countless players, from the Pentagon to utility companies, in their hunt for slices of spectrum that can carry 5G signals. But the carriers are still optimistic that the U.S. can dominate 5G as long as the Federal Communications Commission keeps selling off airwaves as scheduled, said Nick Ludlum, senior vice president for trade group CTIA.</p>
<p>The virus has caused some slowdown, however. The commission recently postponed a 5G airwaves auction set to start in June by one month because of the pandemic. An international standards body has also delayed the rollout of a set of key technical standards for 5G after the virus forced the cancellation of some of its meetings.</p>

<p>And as employers fear the spread of the outbreak, infrastructure work is proving a challenge. The FCC has pointed to at least one tower company that’s suspended work for weeks because of the virus. That’s in addition to a slowdown in local government approvals for 5G installations given the degree to which the outbreak has consumed municipality and state officials&rsquo; attention. Some wireless builds are “grinding to a halt or close” to it because of a lack of municipal permitting and zoning approvals, Adelstein said.</p>
<p>“In the short term, we understand that municipalities may need to adjust their usual practices or even in some cases issue work stoppages,” said Zenia Zaveri, vice president of external affairs for infrastructure company Crown Castle. “We will work through it together, in real time.”</p>
<p>In some states, quarantines are preventing work entirely — although the Department of Homeland Security has circulated a letter declaring some communications infrastructure work an essential function that should continue to operate during the crisis. The department officially declared communications workers essential in a public update on Saturday.</p>
<p>Adelstein also urged the FCC to act on longstanding petitions from the wireless industry, asking the commission to streamline the amount of local approvals required for wireless projects, such as when companies add 5G gear to existing towers, and automatically approve building applications if local officials haven&rsquo;t acted in a certain time frame. The industry is also examining what emergency powers the FCC may have to speed efforts along.</p>
<p>But even these infrastructure players anticipate long-term gains. Sitetracker, a company devoted to critical infrastructure deployments, surveyed a mix of companies in early March and found that 44 percent of carriers believe the coronavirus pandemic will increase demand for telecommunications infrastructure, given the rise in households living and working remotely.</p>
<p>The telecom giants “know that the time could be right,” said Nicol Turner Lee, a fellow at the Brookings Institution. “The climate is probably right to get more people online, do a 5G connection. … We’re going to need faster connectivity to be able to perform the fundamental tasks that need to be done to keep people safe, informed and healthy.”

<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b3c7f59522e2a6f894c0f441bcebd07d850f47d/13_230_3534_2122/master/3534..jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=9cffbac3bc903501f19fa1884c045d71" alt="img">
British broadcasters are being warned that they face sanctions from the media regulator if they give airtime to false health advice about coronavirus, after a Sussex radio station was given a severe warning for broadcasting baseless conspiracy theories that the pandemic is linked to the rollout of 5G phone networks.</p>
<p>Members of the public complained after hearing a broadcast on the community radio station Uckfield FM, in which a woman introduced as a “registered nurse” claimed, without any evidence, that the rollout of 5G phone technology in Wuhan was connected to the outbreak and that the virus had been created in a lab.</p>
<p>It later emerged that she was a practitioner of alternative medicines, while the media regulator said it was “not aware of any reputable scientific evidence to corroborate such a contentious claim which runs contrary to all official advice, both in the UK and internationally, about coronavirus.”</p>
<p>Ofcom confirmed it was actively monitoring television and radio stations that might be broadcasting potentially harmful views about the causes and origins of Covid-19 that have “the potential to undermine people’s trust in the advice of mainstream sources of information” during the crisis.</p>
<p>Fake news in the time of coronavirus: how big is the threat? | Hugo Mercier Read more</p>
<p>Baseless suggestions that coronavirus is linked to 5G have spread widely in recent weeks on WhatsApp, Facebook groups, and on the fast-growing community website NextDoor – all of which have the ability to reach vastly more people than a small community radio station in Sussex but are much less regulated.</p>
<p>The spread of baseless material on WhatsApp connecting 5G to coronavirus has now been covered in many mainstream news outlets, boosted by social media posts by celebrities such as the actor Woody Harrelson.</p>
<p>This poses a conundrum for those seeking to convince the public that the fears are unfounded. Fact-checking organisations often find that people are reluctant to change their mind once convinced of an issue if they are simply told they are wrong, despite international agencies finding there are no health risks associated with 5G and no link to coronavirus. There is also the risk that declining trust in mainstream media means that attempts to stop the claims spreading are seen as a cover-up.</p>
<p>In the case of Uckfield FM, Ofcom reported that the guest also used her appearance to launch a lengthy attack on health professionals in the NHS dealing with the pandemic.</p>
<p>She said: “Just because you have this qualification, do not wear that like a crown of glory … The days are gone when you were a doctor and a nurse and everybody trusted you. Those days are well gone. Do your own research. Do not trust a qualification. I know many people who are very qualified who know very little. Because remember the people that own the establishments that teach us, it all travels back to the same thing. It’s all owned by big pharma. They own the medical elite and they determine what gets published.”</p>
<p>Ofcom decided that the 20-minute interview with a person purporting to be an authoritative health figure who was not sufficiently challenged posed a significant risk to public health at a time of national crisis. It ordered the station to broadcast an apology in a manner of regulator’s choosing and warned other outlets that it would be stepping up monitoring.

<h3 id="covid-19-puts-year-of-5g-on-hold">COVID-19 puts Year of 5G on hold</h3>
<p><img src="https://telecoms.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2020/02/coronavirus-covid-19-virus-300x167.jpg" alt="img">
The telco industry might be in the limelight for the moment, but 5G looks like it is now taking a breather as the coronavirus pandemic continues to wreak havoc on society.</p>
<p>2020 was supposed to be the year 5G started to pay dividends. Telcos have been promising financial rewards in the enterprise segments, enterprise customers have been envisioning connectivity-based business models and the vendors were supposed to be supplying the technology to underpin it all. But the party might have to be delayed by another year.</p>
<p>“At Omdia we are revising our 5G forecast,” said Omdia 5G Practice Leader Dario Talmesio. “There are many factors to be looked at, including consumer confidence, business confidence, disposable income, employment data, availability of networks, availability of devices, retail environment, marketing budgets. all these are converging to one direction which is very negative for 5G eMBB.</p>
<p>“We previously believed that 2020 was going to be the real year of 5G. This is no longer that case under the current circumstances.”</p>
<p>Speaking at a media briefing, Huawei SVP Victor Zhang said the telcos are prioritising projects to improve resilience in existing networks as more customers work from home. There is only so much which can be done to continue the 5G rollout as engineers are forced to prioritise the network strain which is threatening today. 5G deployments will slow down as a result.</p>
<p>This is not necessarily a huge consequence for some vendors, Huawei and Nokia for instance have fixed broadband business units, but it might cause headaches for those who are focused on mobile.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Ericsson Annual General Meeting (AGM), which will take place virtually, CEO Börje Ekholm suggested there was no material impact to the firm just yet. Pointing to the 86 commercial 5G agreements and 27 live networks, Ekholm is seemingly trying to build confidence in the business, but it becomes difficult to ignore the logic behind a 5G slowdown.</p>
<p>Attention from the telcos is being diverted as reliable broadband and 4G networks are the gold standard during the outbreak, and you have to question whether there is 5G demand from the consumer to validate aggressive deployment strategies from the MNOs.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, September would have been a very interesting month for 5G excitement thanks to launch of Apple’s flagship device for the year. This would have been a series of 5G-capable smartphones that could have stirred the iCultists into a frenzy. Many analysts have suggested this launch could push 5G into the mainstream, but reports have been circulating that claim the bonanza could be scaled back.</p>
<p>It was suggested Apple would launch four devices in the autumn, ticking the boxes for multiple demographics, but supply problems for components might be the spanner in the works. What is worth noting is that there are also reports Apple is on track. As with everything associated with the media-shy iGiant, mixed reports are muddying the waters.</p>
<p>Looking at the wider smartphone segment, the demand is not likely to scale over the next few months to completely justify an aggressive 5G rollout.</p>
<p>If the telcos are to rationalize additional expenditure on 5G deployments, there would have to be customers on the other side to make use of the shiny, speedy networks. As it stands, some enterprise customers are prioritising manpower and investments towards existing day-to-day operations and also trying to reduce out-goings as a recession looms on the horizon, while consumers are also becoming increasingly cash conscious and with retail locations closed, sales are likely to become less common.</p>
<p>Last week, Counterpoint Research suggested smartphone shipments had declined by 14% over the course of February, and it would be very fair to assume the trend would continue (if not worsen) through March and beyond as more self-isolation measures are introduced around the world. New smartphone purchases are likely to be delayed for many for various reasons, eroding the demand for 5G connectivity.</p>
<p>Another very obvious issue which the telcos may well face is the sourcing of products and components. Although the main suppliers have been very vocal in suggesting their manufacturing capabilities are secure, that could change in a matter of weeks. These are companies who could be thrown off course by their own supply chains, and even if there have been business continuity measures put in place, we are heading to the realms of the unknown. Predicting the status quo of tomorrow and the impact of this pandemic is becoming almost impossible.</p>
<p>One final point to consider is the availability of spectrum, a scarce but critically important asset for the telcos.</p>
<p>There might be regions where the availability of spectrum is more attractive, but there are certainly many where the telcos are screaming out for more. With auctions being postponed due to the on-going challenges presented by the coronavirus, telcos might have no option but to delay the launch of some services. Spain is the most recent country to delay a spectrum auction, the 700 MHz band in this case, though French telecoms regulator ARCEP has already announced a postponement, alongside regulators in Austria and Portugal. Without this valuable resource, telcos will struggle to deliver the 5G experience which has been promised to so many in glitzy and glamorous advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>As it stands, the telcos are being forced to prioritise investment and attention elsewhere, forecasts on the number of 5G capable devices are likely to be lowered and delicately balanced supply chains could be thrown off course in a matter of days. The Chinese telcos could certainly counter this assumption with their own network deployments, but it would be a fair to bet on 2021 being the new Year of 5G.
