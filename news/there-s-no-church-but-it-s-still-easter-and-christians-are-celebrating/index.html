(CNN) This Easter Sunday, the Rev. Tim Kesicki, the head of the Jesuit order in North America, will officiate a Mass around his family&rsquo;s dining room table.</p>
<p>The service will include just Kesicki, his sister and parents at their home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. But it won&rsquo;t necessarily be a quiet Mass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the homily, it is not uncommon for my mom to offer comments,&rdquo; Kesicki said, laughing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very welcome, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kesicki, who lives in Washington, DC, has celebrated Mass with his family before, a perk of being an ordained Catholic priest.</p>
<p>But for many Christians, Easter this year will be dramatically different: a home-bound, shelter-in-place holy day. No Easter parades, no egg hunts at church, no church at all. As there&rsquo;s been all Lent, there&rsquo;s a solemness in the air. It doesn&rsquo;t escape many Christians that they&rsquo;re celebrating Jesus&rsquo; resurrection at a time of rampant sickness and death.</p>
<p>More than 1.5 million people around the world have been infected by the novel coronavirus, and over 100,000 have died, according Johns Hopkins University. The collateral damage can seem nearly as stunning. More than 16 million Americans were out of jobs in just the last three weeks.</p>
<p>The pandemic has emptied St. Peter&rsquo;s Square of pilgrims, silenced the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and shuttered the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, the site of the first Easter two millennia ago.</p>
<p>Sanctuaries across the world, normally filled with Easter lilies and families wearing spring pastels and holiday hats, sit vacant this Sunday.</p>
<p>The Very Rev. Dean Randy Hollerith at an empty Washington National Cathedral</p>
<p>Government officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, have urged Americans not to attend services larger than 10 people. Outside of few loud outliers, most Christians seem to be complying, according to polls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There have certainly been lots of examples when religious people have looked askance at certain kinds of science,&rdquo; said Elaine Ecklund, a sociologist at Rice University. &ldquo;But this is not one of those times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So instead of packed churches this Sunday, there will be livestreams. Lots of livestreams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are all televangelists now,&rdquo; joked Ed Stetzer, an evangelical expert on church growth and a pastor at The Moody Church in Chicago.</p>
<p>Some pastors, such as televangelist Joel Osteen, have planned elaborate affairs with celebrities like Mariah Carey and Tyler Perry.</p>
<p>But most Easter services this year will be more bare: just a preacher, a near-empty church and an online congregation.</p>
<p>Staying home is an act of worship</p>
<p>Bishop Michael Curry, head of the Episcopal Church, will be in two places at once this Sunday.</p>
<p>Thousands of Episcopalians and other Christians will see him deliver his Easter sermon from the pulpit of Washington National Cathedral at 11 a.m. He pretaped the sermon on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Curry himself will be sitting in his living room in Raleigh, North Carolina.</p>
<p>The effervescent preacher, who stole the ceremony at Prince Harry and Megan Markle&rsquo;s wedding two years ago, may not even watch his own Easter sermon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never watched myself preach,&rdquo; Curry said light-heartedly. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s humility, but I avoid that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead, the presiding bishop will pull out his iPad and watch another church&rsquo;s service this Sunday.</p>
<p>It will be the first time in living memory he won&rsquo;t be in church on Easter Sunday, Curry said. He&rsquo;ll miss it, but said he sees a larger purpose at work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To love your neighbor is to love God. And one of the most loving things we can do this Sunday is not gather in a public assembly so that nobody else gets sick. It is an act of worship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With his grown children out of the house, Curry said his Easter will be smaller this year, with the feast his wife prepares pared down to a meal for two.</p>

<p>Taking Communion into her own hands</p>
<p>In Arlington, Virginia, Episcopalian Diana Butler Bass will take church into her own home.</p>
<p>After watching an Easter service online, the Christian scholar and writer will gather her family around the kitchen table on Sunday evening, consecrate crackers and wine, and celebrate Holy Communion.</p>
<p>In the Episcopal Church only clergy can consecrate the bread and wine, often only when the church community is gathered.</p>
<p>But this Easter, Butler Bass said, she will throw out the rulebook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a time of spiritual emergency, and the people of God can fully take up all of these spiritual practices to thrive and feel the comforting presence of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the early, perilous days of Christianity, the church survived by such means, Butler Bass said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite sure other Christians have made the same decision over other centuries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pastor Greg Locke of Global Vision Bible Church in Mount Juliet, Tennessee, holds services in the church parking lot.</p>
<p>The real crisis</p>
<p>When Stetzer delivers his Easter sermon at Chicago&rsquo;s Moody Church, the sanctuary will be eerily quiet.</p>
<p>Easter is known as the &ldquo;Superbowl of outreach,&rdquo; the evangelical leader said. Sanctuaries are filled with Christians who attend on Easter and Christmas, providing a rare chance for pastors to preach to the not-wholly converted.</p>
<p>But Stetzer said pastors who focus only on what&rsquo;s lost this year, including the financial hit many are taking, are missing the point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is not a crisis of pastors having to livestream church,&rdquo; Stetzer told evangelical pastors during a Facebook live talk this week. &ldquo;This is a crisis of sickness and death in our communities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing no amens</p>
<p>In Memphis, Bishop Milton R. Hawkins has had a few weeks to practice preaching to an online congregation. His Deliverance Church of God in Christ has been closed since early March.</p>
<p>Hawkins, who has been preaching for 32 years, admits that elements of preaching online took time to learn. Sermons in his church are usually interactive affairs, with the congregation adding punctuation, from soft amens to shouts of joy.</p>
<p>But with just a singer and a cameraperson in the church this Sunday, the amens will be few and far between, the bishop said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I preach to the audience as if the house is full,&rdquo; said Hawkins. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same message, whether or not you get applause from the congregation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mother of invention</p>
<p>Despite the objections of some conservatives, Catholic bishops across the country have canceled Easter services and closed their churches this year.</p>
<p>In California, the lack of access to Mass felt like a spiritual hardship to Mary Ioannidis, especially since she is seven months pregnant. Finding a Mass online required foraging through multiple online platforms to find service times and livestreams.</p>
<p>So Ioannidis and her brother, Rick Minno, who also works in tech, put their heads together and created WithYourSpirit.org , an online database of more than 350 livestreamed Masses from across the country.</p>
<p>Already, the site has connected 10,000 Catholics with more than 1,500 live Masses, Ioannidis said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Necessity is the mother of invention, Ioannadis said, &ldquo;For two thousand years they church has not needed to provide that connection electronically. You almost always had access to a priest through a local parish. But now we find ourselves in a time when face-to-face gatherings are no longer responsible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Easter, the 29-year-old said she&rsquo;ll watch the Easter Mass at St. Patrick&rsquo;s Cathedral in New York City from across the country in Palo Alto.</p>
<p>Then Ioannidis and her family will gather for a family trivia game. On Google hangout, of course.

<h3 id="an-easter-of-solitude-christians-across-the-world-mark-easter-sunday-amid-the-coronavirus">&lsquo;An Easter of solitude&rsquo;: Christians across the world mark Easter Sunday amid the coronavirus</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2020/04/12/USAT/d62923f1-b191-4f27-99dd-5cf0a6da3efb-AP_Virus_Outbreak_Vatican_Easter.jpg?crop=4904,2759,x0,y249&amp;width=3200&amp;height=1801&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" alt="img">
Trevor Hughes and Eric J. Lyman</p>
<p>USA TODAY</p>
<p>VATICAN CITY – His voice echoing through the nearly empty St. Peter’s Basilica, a somber Pope Francis celebrated one of the strangest Easter celebrations in Vatican history Sunday amid Italy’s national lockdown for the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Francis cast a solitary figure as he addressed the outbreak that has so far claimed more than 110,000 lives worldwide, nearly 20,000 of them in Italy, which surrounds Vatican City. More than 20,600 people have died in the United States. The pandemic has prompted quarantines and social distancing orders globally, from China, where it began, across Europe, South America and the U.S.</p>
<p>“This is an Easter of solitude lived amid the sorry and hardship the pandemic is causing, whether from physical suffering or economic difficulties,” Francis said in Italian.</p>
<p>Millions of Christians globally celebrated Easter, marking the resurrection of Jesus following his crucifixion. Across the United States, many churches were holding similar remote services intended to help slow the infection&rsquo;s spread.</p>
<p>﻿Both President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence planned to attend Easter services remotely. Trump said he&rsquo;d be watching an online service led by Pastor Robert Jeffress of the 4,000-member First Baptist Church in Dallas and a Fox News contributor.</p>
<p>This is the first year of his presidency that Trump hasn&rsquo;t traveled to his Florida resort for Easter, where he and his family usually attend Easter service at the Episcopal church where he and first lady Melania Trump were married in 2005.</p>
<p>Also canceled this year: the annual White House Easter egg roll, which dates back to 1878 and was previously canceled or moved during the two world wars, according to the White House Historical Association.</p>
<p>Francis mentioned those directly impacted by the spread of the virus, including medical personnel, the sick, the dead, and family members mourning their losses. It was a far cry from Easter Sunday a year ago, when an estimated 75,000 people packed St. Peter&rsquo;s Square as Francis urged those in zones of conflict to lay down their arms.</p>
<p>In Sunday’s Mass, he called for the faithful watching from home to maintain their faith in what he called “trying times.”</p>
<p>“Our world is already faced with epochal challenges,” the pontiff said. “Now it is oppressed by a pandemic that is severely testing our whole human family.”</p>
<p>Outside the basilica in St. Peter’s Square, security staff that would normally be assuring the safe movement of the faithful into the square for Mass were instead turning them away.</p>
<p>Despite not being able to attend Easter services in person, many said the 83-year-old pontiff still gives them strength. Anna Maria Donaldson, 39, is a U.N. consultant from New Jersey who has attended the pope&rsquo;s Easter Mass annually since moving to Rome in 2015. This year she watched the live broadcast on her laptop from her nearby apartment.</p>
<p>“I feel stronger after watching the Mass,” Donaldson said. “You could see the weight of the pandemic on the shoulders of the pope as he celebrated Mass. He is being strong to help us be stronger.”</p>
<p>What to watch:Easter Sunday streaming guide: Andrea Bocelli and more</p>
<p>Some church leaders and conservative politicians in the U.S. fought back against closures and social distancing orders, although most churches were following distancing guidelines.</p>
<p>In Kansas, the state&rsquo;s highest court is considering whether Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly has the power to ban religious and funeral services of more than 10 attendees during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>And in Kentucky, Gov. Andy Beshear said anyone attending a mass gathering, such as a church service, may have their license plates recorded so attendees can be contacted by government officials and required to self-quarantine for 14 days.</p>
<p>What is open:What stores are open Easter Sunday 2020? Here&rsquo;s the list of who is open and who will stay closed</p>
<p>U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican who represents Kentucky, said that goes too far. &ldquo;Taking license plates at church?&rdquo; Paul tweeted late Friday. &ldquo;Quarantining someone for being Christian on Easter Sunday? Someone needs to take a step back here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the Maryville Baptist Church in Kentucky, pastor Jack Roberts reported that someone scattered piles of nails around the church&rsquo;s parking lot in the hours before in-person services were set to begin. Roberts held a service Wednesday that drew 40 people – and a health department order to stop holding such gatherings.</p>
<p>Roberts was insistent on holding service Sunday, arguing his parishioners have a constitutional right to worship together, and covered up his license plate. Several other drivers did the same thing, although there was no sign of threatened law enforcement monitoring.</p>
<p>Lyman reported from Vatican City. Hughes reported from Denver.</p>
