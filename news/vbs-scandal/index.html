<p>A number of people have been arrested by police investigating one of South Africa’s most notorious corruption scandals, the looting and collapse of VBS Mutual Bank.</p>
<p>VBS, which held the savings of many disadvantaged people and local municipalities, collapsed with more than £100m in debts in 2018. Much of the money had been siphoned into private bank accounts and some spent on property or luxury cars, investigators found.</p>
<p>Four people were detained in early morning raids on Wednesday in the provinces of Gauteng and Limpopo, with further arrests anticipated within 24 hours. One suspect is in quarantine after contracting Covid-19 and is expected to be detained shortly.</p>
<p>The head of the National Prosecuting Authority described the VBS scandal as “probably the biggest bank robbery in this country”.</p>
<p>“We have an obligation to all South Africans to deliver justice in this matter,” Shamila Batohi said. “It is our duty to the direct victims of corruption.”</p>
<p>The arrests constitute one of the first significant operations against corruption in South Africa since Cyril Ramaphosa gained power more than two years ago.</p>
<p>Those targeted by the Hawks, an elite investigation unit, include the bank’s former chairman, other senior executives and an auditor from the accounting firm KPMG.</p>
<p>They face charges of racketeering, corruption, fraud and theft, and could be jailed for life. Prosecutors described a “pattern of racketeering activity” and dozens more were implicated in the alleged theft. These include officials of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party.</p>
<p>Ramaphosa has repeatedly promised to crack down on the graft that spread through government institutions, the ANC, parts of the bureaucracy and some law enforcement agencies under the nine-year rule of his predecessor Jacob Zuma.</p>
<p>However the president, a former labour activist turned tycoon, has been reluctant to threaten a fragile peace within the ANC between powerful networks promoted by Zuma and his own reformist supporters.</p>
<p>Politicians from the ANC and opposition parties have been tarnished by the bank’s collapse.</p>
<p>VBS was a little-known lender until it gained notoriety in 2016 for providing a £500,000 loan to the former president Jacob Zuma to reimburse the state for upgrades to his personal home including a swimming pool and amphitheatre.</p>
<p>The biggest losers in the collapse were local authorities, though many individual depositors lost their life savings. Many were eventually compensated out of public funds.</p>
<p>The lack of action against those accused of corruption has angered voters in the troubled country and worried international investors. South Africa’s currency has plunged in recent months amid the Covid-19 pandemic and after an investment downgrading by ratings agencies.</p>
<p>One ANC MP and former minister has been charged with offering bribes to derail a parliamentary inquiry into corruption at the state power utility Eskom, but continues to sit in parliament and chair the parliamentary committee on home affairs. He denies the charges.</p>
<p>The arrests are a further embarrassment for KPMG, which has been heavily criticised for working with the Guptas, a family of businessmen who left South Africa facing fraud and corruption allegations.</p>
<p>The former partner implicated in the VBS scandal resigned from KPMG before an internal disciplinary hearing. He has denied wrongdoing.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for KPMG said it had fully cooperated with the investigations.</p>
<p>“Over the last few years KPMG South Africa has reflected deeply on the changes that needed to happen within its business and made significant reforms … KPMG South Africa today is a very different business compared to three years ago. We are confident that we are on the right path, and we will keep working to make sure we play a positive role in the business community and the nation,” the spokesperson said.

<p><img src="https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png" alt="img">
JOHANNESBURG, June 17 (Reuters) - South African authorities have apprehended eight people suspected of illegally siphoning 2.3 billion rand ($133.87 million) from small lender VBS Mutual Bank, which collapsed in 2018 because of the corruption scandal.</p>
<p>Godfrey Lebeya, head of South Africa’s Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, said four were already in custody, three were due to turn themselves in on Thursday and an eighth suspect had agreed to appear after clearing COVID-19 quarantine.</p>
<p>“As soon as all the relevant processes are completed, we will be securing the attendance of the eight suspects in court,” he told a news conference.</p>
<p>The head of the National Prosecuting Authority Shamila Batohi added that they were due to appear in court on Thursday. She described it as “probably the biggest bank robbery in this country.”</p>
<p>Batohi added, “We have an obligation to all South Africans to deliver justice in this matter &hellip; It is our duty to the direct victims of corruption.”</p>
<p>Charges included five counts of racketeering, 12 of theft, seven of fraud and 15 of corruption, Lebeya said.</p>
<p>VBS was a little known lender until it gained notoriety in 2016 for providing a 7.8 million rand ($660,000) loan to former president Jacob Zuma to reimburse the state for illegitimate upgrades to his personal home including a swimming pool and amphitheatre.</p>
<p>The money that went missing included cash from sizeable short term deposits by municipalities, and some 50 people were thought to be involved. ($1 = 17.1811 rand) (Writing by Tim Cocks, Editing by William Maclean)

<p>WhatsApp messages between two former senior VBS Mutual Bank employees reveal a trail of payments that inevitably end up in the EFF&rsquo;s bank accounts.</p>
<p>The Daily Maverick and its investigative journalism wing, Scorpio, revealed WhatsApp messages between former VBS Chair Tshifhiwa Matodzi and former VBS Treasurer Phophi Mukhodobwane.</p>
<p>The exchange between Matodzi and Mukhodobwane reveals a series of messages resulting in several payments to slush funds linked to EFF leaders, Julius Malema and Floyd Shivambu.</p>
<p>In October 2018, the VBS looting scandal was leaked to the public and the parties involved all denied any connection to the looting of over R1.2 billion.</p>
<p>READ ALSO: Covid-19: Taxi fares skyrocket by as much as 172% for a single trip</p>
<p>The Daily Maverick reported that on at least seven occasions during 2017, Matodzi instructed millions in stolen VBS money to be paid to Sgameka Projects.</p>
<p>When news of the VBS loot hit the public, Floyd Shivambu&rsquo;s brother, Brian Shivambu denied that he had received funds from VBS Mutual Bank.</p>
<p>He claimed that the millions traced to Sgameka Projects, a company he claimed to own, were as a result of his work as a consultant for VBS-linked company Vele Investments and all the transactions were above board.</p>
<p>It was later revealed that Sgameka Projects had no invoices to show for the work allegedly done, no tax was paid and no employee salaries or any other operating costs. The VBS money seemed to be the company&rsquo;s sole income.</p>
<p>A follow-up investigation by Scorpio also revealed that Malema and Floyd Shivambu were the actual beneficiaries of the Sgameka Projects account. Both EFF leaders denied this but did not challenge the revelations that they supposedly stole millions from the poor in their own communities.</p>
<p>The WhatsApp messages appear to disprove the the responses by the EFF leaders and they also suggest a close relationship between Matodzi and the EFF.</p>
<p>In a six-month period in 2017, Matodzi is said to have personally ordered R9.55 million in VBS money to be moved to Sgameka Projects. This formed part of more than R20 million in VBS money allegedly allocated to the EFF and its leaders.</p>
<p>Several payments linked to VBS also show Malema splurging nearly a R100 000 on alcohol in Polokwane and a further R39 760 on Lacoste and Louis Vuitton goods in Sandton.</p>
<p>The Hawks and the National Prosecuting Authority began an investigation into the VBS loot in 2018 and to date no arrests or prosecutions have been made.</p>

<p>June 17 (Reuters) - Major Middle Eastern bourses ended little changed on Wednesday as investors remained cautious amid worries over a resurgence of global coronavirus cases.</p>
<p>New COVID-19 infections hit record highs in six U.S. states, while Beijing struggled to contain a fresh outbreak.</p>
<p>The Saudi benchmark index .TASI traded flat, with financials and petrochemical shares moving sideways. Riyad Bank 1010.SE added 0.8%, while petrochemical firm Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC) 2010.SE eased 0.5%.</p>

<p>Abu Dhabi, the largest and wealthiest member of the United Arab Emirates federation, on Tuesday eased movement restrictions, allowing citizens and residents to leave the emirate freely without a permit but requiring them to enter it with one.</p>
<p>In Dubai, where vital sectors such as tourism and transport are at a near halt, the index .DFMGI edged up 0.1%, helped by a 1.4% gain in lender Emirates NBD ENBD.DU.</p>

KPMG vows to bury controversial past</p>
<p>Share this article: Share Tweet Share Share Share Email Share</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - KPMG South Africa has vowed to bury its controversial past as it continues to strengthen its systems in an ambitious programme to rebuild its image and regain public trust. KPMG’s chief executive, Ignatius Sehoole, said the successful turnaround of the audit firm rested on four pillars he was overseeing to re-establish KPMG as an ethical audit and advisory firm since he took the reins 12 months ago. Sehoole said KPMG had appointed independent non-executive directors and changed the traditional systematic model of audit firms by doing away with partners at board level. “We wanted to inject independence and objectivity into the policy decisions of the firm, so we had to revamp our governance framework. We appointed Professor Wiseman Nkuhlu as chairperson of the board, Ben Marks as chief audit officer and Imogen Mkhize, an executive director at the Solegna Group,” Sehoole said. “We have upgraded our risk-management systems, and in that process we exited quite a lot of clients.</p>
<p>“We realised we needed to have robust systems, and we decided we will not do business with companies that do not fit the bill of our risk assessment. It has not been an easy time, as the firm lost a lot of revenue,” Sehoole said.</p>
<p>KPMG was thrust into the spotlight in 2017 when it confessed to publishing a misleading report on the South African Revenue Service, doing work for the Gupta family and turning a blind eye to corruption as an auditor for the collapsed VBS Mutual Bank.</p>
<p>At least eight of KPMG’s top staff resigned that year, including former chief executive Trevor Hoole, following work that “fell considerably short” of the firm’s standards.</p>
<p>Some of the biggest companies in South Africa replaced KPMG as their auditors in the wake of the scandal, which cost the firm one-third of its revenue and saw its workforce shrink from 3400 to 2200.</p>
<p>In 2018, Nkuhlu admitted that KPMG had made many serious mistakes and lost the trust of the public and clients, and had lost sight of its responsibility to serve the broader public interest.</p>
<p>Sehoole reiterated that the fall of KPMG had thrust the entire audit profession into disrepute, and he now saw it as his duty to inculcate the culture and values of serving the public interest back into the profession.</p>
<p>“In my time, there was such a strong aura of integrity around the profession. In my 10-odd years at Saica (South African Institute of Chartered Accountants), I worked very hard with the profession all round to ensure that it was rated number one in the world, and we achieved that,” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s with a bleeding heart that I sit here and be rated number 35 in the world, because that is not who we are.”</p>
<p>Sehoole said KPMG was slowly regaining its reputation, as clients no longer viewed working with it as taking a risky bet.</p>
<p>He said KPMG continued winning new business even during the lockdown period implemented to curb the spread of the coronavirus, showing that it had adopted an ethical culture of doing business.</p>
<p>“The more we build that culture, the more you’re going to attract only people that appreciate the ethos of the firm and they identify with the value system of the firm,” Sehoole said.</p>
<p>“For me, it’s the most fundamental pillar of turning around KPMG. Our new vision is to be the most trusted and trustworthy professional services firm.”</p>

Adds detail, background on coronavirus crisis</p>
<p>ACCRA, June 17 (Reuters) - Ghana&rsquo;s economic growth slowed in the first quarter to 4.9% year-on-year versus 6.7% in the same period last year, official data showed on Wednesday, partly due to a sharp fall in construction as the country fought to contain the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Ghana has had one of Sub-Saharan Africa&rsquo;s fastest-growing economies in the past few years, but country has cut its 2020 growth forecasts after measures to contain the virus stifled business activity.</p>
<p>In January to March, construction shrank nearly 7% versus the same quarter in 2019, the state statistics service said.</p>
<p>A three-week lockdown of Ghana&rsquo;s two main economic centres Accra and Kumasi imposed at the end of March, is likely to have weighed further on growth in the second quarter.</p>
<p>The central bank last month downgraded its growth forecast for 2020 to between 2% and 2.5% from an earlier expectation of 6.8% due to the impact of the pandemic. The economy grew 6.5% in 2019.</p>
<p>Despite rising numbers of COVID-19 cases, Ghana was one of the first countries in West Africa to trial easing lockdown measures in April in an effort to protect the economy. It has so far confirmed more than 12,000 cases of COVID-19 and 58 deaths.</p>
<p>Producer price inflation rose to 8.4% year-on-year in May compared with 7.4% a month earlier, with the mining and quarrying sector recording the highest inflation rate and manufacturing the lowest, the statistics service said in a separate statement.</p>

Following is a summary of current world news briefs. Exclusive: Amid Brexit impasse, Germany urges no-deal preparations - document</p>
<p>The German government is urging other EU states to prepare for a no deal Brexit, according an internal document that casts doubt on Britain&rsquo;s optimism over chances of an early agreement on its future ties with the bloc. Britain left the European Union on Jan. 31 and their relationship is governed by a transition arrangement that keeps previous rules in place while new terms are negotiated. South Korea&rsquo;s Moon faces crisis in peace bid with North but has few options</p>
<p>South Korea&rsquo;s President Moon Jae-in faces the biggest crisis yet in his bid to foster reconciliation with North Korea, as it lashes out with the destruction of a joint office and rolls back agreements, but he has few options, analysts say. Relations between the two Koreas have plunged to their lowest since Moon took office in 2017 vowing to work to end decades-old confrontation and be a mediator in nudging North Korea to give up its nuclear and missile programmes. U.S. hits Syria with toughest sanctions yet to push Assad to end war</p>
<p>The United States on Wednesday imposed its toughest sanctions ever targeting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to choke off revenue for his government in a bid to force it back to United Nations-led negotiations and broker an end to the country&rsquo;s nearly decade-long war. The fresh round of penalties on Syria, which designate Assad and his wife Asma personally, come at a time when Assad is grappling with a deepening economic crisis after a decade of war and amid a rare outbreak of protests in government-held areas. WHO moves to update COVID-19 guidance after &lsquo;great news&rsquo; in drug study</p>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) said it was moving to update its guidelines on treating people stricken with COVID-19 to reflect results of a clinical trial that showed a cheap, common steroid can help save critically ill patients. Trial results announced on Tuesday by researchers in Britain showed dexamethasone, used since the 1960s to reduce inflammation in diseases such as arthritis, cut death rates by around a third among the most severely ill COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital. Israel&rsquo;s Netanyahu mulls two-phase West Bank annexation, newspaper says</p>
<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is weighing a limited initial annexation in the occupied West Bank, hoping to quell international opposition to his pledge of wide territorial moves, an Israeli newspaper said on Wednesday. Netanyahu has said a U.S. peace plan, which envisages Israel retaining its settlements in the West Bank, provides an &ldquo;historic opportunity&rdquo; to extend Israeli sovereignty to them and to the Jordan Valley area. Special Report: The pub and the pandemic - Regulars, suppliers, owner adrift in lockdown</p>
<p>When the Greenwich Pensioner was built in 1827, the girl who would become Queen Victoria was 8 years old and John Quincy Adams was serving as the sixth president of the United States. Since then, the pub in London&rsquo;s East End has survived two world wars, including bombings that flattened the houses next to it, four cholera epidemics and the devastating Spanish flu pandemic of a century ago. Pompeo to meet with China&rsquo;s top diplomat in Hawaii: State Dept</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will meet with Yang Jiechi, China&rsquo;s top diplomat, on Wednesday in Honolulu, the State Department said, a crucial meeting as relations between the two countries have deeply soured since the start of the year. The meeting is scheduled to take place at 0900 a.m. local time, according to the agency&rsquo;s public schedule. In addition to an intensifying strategic rivalry, the world&rsquo;s top two economies have been at loggerheads in recent months over the handling of the coronavirus pandemic and China&rsquo;s move to impose new security legislation on Hong Kong. UK&rsquo;s Labour says will hold government to promise of EU deal by year-end</p>
<p>Britain&rsquo;s opposition Labour Party will hold Prime Minister Boris Johnson&rsquo;s government to its promise of securing a free trade deal with the European Union by the end of the year, the spokesman for its leader Keir Starmer said on Wednesday. Johnson has suggested an agreement could be achieved in July but negotiators on both sides have so far given a downbeat assessment of talks. Eight suspects arrested in South Africa&rsquo;s &lsquo;biggest bank robbery&rsquo; VBS fraud case</p>
<p>South African authorities have apprehended eight people suspected of illegally siphoning 2.3 billion rand ($133.87 million) from small lender VBS Mutual Bank, which collapsed in 2018 because of the corruption scandal. Godfrey Lebeya, head of South Africa&rsquo;s Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, said four were already in custody, three were due to turn themselves in on Thursday and an eighth suspect had agreed to appear after clearing COVID-19 quarantine.
