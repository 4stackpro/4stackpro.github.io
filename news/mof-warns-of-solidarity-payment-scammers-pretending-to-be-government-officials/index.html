SINGAPORE - Scammers are pretending to be Ministry of Finance (MOF) or government officials to trick the public into disclosing their bank account details to purportedly register for the Solidarity Package payout.</p>
<p>The MOF issued a warning about the scams in a Facebook post on Monday (April 13).</p>
<p>&ldquo;MOF would never ask for (users&rsquo;) bank account details over the phone or via e-mail,&rdquo; the ministry said.</p>
<p>Online transactions with government agencies require users to log in with their SingPass, it added.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat urged the public to be wary of these scams, too. On Tuesday, he said on Facebook that government officers would also not ask for people’s personal data over e-mail or over the phone.</p>
<p>Mr Heng said that he recently had to make a police report after coming across a scam using his image and name.</p>
<p>“We must remain vigilant against those who are unscrupulous and seeking to take advantage of our people, especially the vulnerable, during this period,” he added.</p>
<p>“They divert valuable public resources, but the enforcement agencies will investigate, and if they are caught, we will press for deterrent sentences.”</p>
<p>On April 6, the Government announced that all Singaporeans aged 21 and above will receive a one-off payout of $600 to tide them over the Covid-19 outbreak as it enhanced the payout for a second time in as many months.</p>
<p>Later on April 7, the Government said that permanent residents aged 21 and older with Singaporean parents, spouses or children will be eligible for a one-off payment of $300.</p>
<p>Eligible recipients of the Solidarity Payment who have not previously provided bank account details to the Government for such payouts should submit the details only through official websites.</p>
<p>Singapore citizens can do so at this website, and PRs can submit their details here.</p>
<p>In its Facebook post, MOF warned the public against responding to unfamiliar e-mails, text messages or phone calls purportedly from MOF concerning Budget 2020 benefits. They should also refrain from clicking on suspicious e-mail links.</p>
<p>Those who suspect they have fallen prey to a phishing scam should lodge a police report immediately, secure online accounts, and contact their banks if necessary.

<h3 id="coronavirus-nine-in-10-sporeans-to-get-600-solidarity-payment-tomorrow">Coronavirus: Nine in 10 S&rsquo;poreans to get $600 Solidarity Payment tomorrow</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/articles/2020/04/13/wh-payuout-130420.jpg?itok=q3DkhdyE" alt="img">
Nine in 10 Singaporeans will each receive a one-off payout of $600 tomorrow as part of measures by the Government to help families tide over the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The payout, which Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat announced last Monday and dubbed the Solidarity Payment, will be credited directly to the bank accounts of all adult Singaporeans.</p>
<p>In February, the Government announced payouts of between $100 and $300 for every adult Singaporean. This was tripled to between $300 and $900 last month, with payouts due to be distributed from August to September.</p>
<p>Last Monday, Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister, said $300 of that payment has been brought forward to this month and supplemented with a further $300 to form the Solidarity Payment.</p>
<p>Those who qualify for the higher tiers will receive a further $300 or $600 in June.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) said yesterday the Government had received bank account details of about 90 per cent of the recipients who previously received payouts, including the SG Bonus in 2018.</p>
<p>The ministry asked the remaining 10 per cent of adult Singaporeans to provide their bank account details via the secure Gov.sg form before April 23.</p>
<p>Recipients who fill in their bank account details before April 23 can expect to receive the payout in their bank accounts on April 28.</p>
<p>SingPass access is required for the form.</p>
<p>By providing their bank account details, recipients can receive their payment quickly and safely without having to leave their homes while circuit breaker measures are in place, MOF said.</p>
<p>Adult Singaporeans who have not provided bank account details by April 23 will receive their payout through cheques sent to their NRIC-registered addresses in stages from April 30 onwards.</p>
<p>The Government will also provide a one-off payout of $300 to permanent residents aged 21 and above this year who have a Singaporean spouse, children or parents.</p>
<p>Long-Term Visit Pass-Plus holders aged 21 and above, who are foreign spouses of Singaporeans, can receive the payout as well.</p>
<p>Eligible permanent residents may sign up for the one-off pay-out using their SingPass from now until May 10.</p>
<p>Those who provide their bank account details while signing up can expect to receive the payout in their bank accounts on May 19.</p>
<p>Those who do not provide their bank account details when signing up will receive cheques in stages from the end of next month.</p>
<p>Long-Term Visit Pass-Plus holders who are eligible will receive their payout through cheques in stages from the end of next month, and no application is needed, the MOF said.
