Coronation Street has been airing since 1960 and will be celebrating its 60th birthday this year. The ITV soap has featured many characters over the years and one of the most beloved is Liz McDonald (played by Beverly Callard). The Rovers Return barmaid has been a mainstay on the soap since 1989 but now she’s bowing after 30 years. The actress is appearing on Saturday Kitchen today (Saturday, March 27) and some may be wondering about her departure.</p>
<p>Why is Beverly Callard leaving Coronation Street?</p>
<p>Actress Callard is said to have had some sleepless nights before she made the decision to walk away from Coronation Street.</p>
<p>The news of Callard quitting the long-running series broke in November last year and it seems it was not a decision the star made lightly.</p>
<p>But Callard appears to want to take on some new roles and projects.</p>
<p>She told OK! Magazine at the time: “There’s very little work in our industry for women over 50, but I’m 62 and recently I was doing three jobs at once.</p>
<p>“It made me realise how I was privileged to have the opportunity to do so when so many women my age no longer get the chance.”</p>
<p>She continued: “I’m sick of ageism in the industry.</p>
<p>“Although I’ve had to leave the safety net of being in Coronation Street to do this, I’m hoping that ageist bosses, of which there are many, take note of how successful this show is and it starts the ball rolling on helping other women my age, get the roles they still deserve.”</p>

<p><img src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DD-COMP-LIZ.jpg?strip=all&amp;quality=100&amp;w=1200&amp;h=800&amp;crop=1" alt="img">

<p>While the actress doesn&rsquo;t know what will happen to Liz to make her leave the cobbles, Beverley has assured fans she won&rsquo;t be killed off.</p>
<p>Speaking to The Mirror, she said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m due to film my final Corrie scenes in July and I have no idea what will happen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only thing I&rsquo;ve been guaranteed is that Liz is not going to die. It would be really good if she found love and happiness, but I can&rsquo;t see that happening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll miss the failed romances and the feuds, but not the fashion. On my last day I&rsquo;ll set fire to Liz&rsquo;s wardrobe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beverley first graced the cobbles in 1984 as Gail and Brian Tisley&rsquo;s friend June Dewhurst - and it was only in 1989 that the actress returned to claim the iconic role of Liz McDonald.</p>
<p>Over the years, the character has been involved in numerous storylines including kidnap, infidelity and most controversially of all domestic abuse, which she suffered at the hands of her on-screen husband Jim McDonald.</p>

<p>Beverley will be leaving the soap in order to join The Thunder Girls.</p>
<p>The play tells the story of an 1980s girl band that reunites after 30 years apart.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, filming on Coronation Street has been put on hold due to coronavirus - which means Liz McDonald&rsquo;s exit storyline will likely be delayed too.</p>
<p>Soap stars have been told not to come in for work from today as drastic measures are taken to stop the spread of the deadly bug.</p>

<p>Coronation Street and Emmerdale will remain on air this week as normal, apart from Friday.</p>
<p>Then from the 30th onwards it will be on just three times a week.</p>
<p>A spokesman told The Sun: “ITV has sadly taken the decision to suspend production of the soaps Coronation Street and Emmerdale with effect from Monday 23 March.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We’ve been doing our best to carry on filming, whilst adhering to the Government’s latest health guidelines, to ensure we’ve episodes of both soaps airing on ITV until at least the early summer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, the health and well-being of the production teams, actors, crew and their families is of paramount importance to us and we now feel that the time has come to stop filming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We’d like to thank our viewers for their support and hope they continue to enjoy both soaps in the coming months.&rdquo;

Beverley Callard is bowing out of Coronation Street (Picture: Rex/ITV)</p>
<p>Coronation Street star Beverley Callard is gearing up towards filming her final scenes as Liz McDonald.</p>
<p>The actress is leaving the soap after 30 years playing the matriarch, and has been looking ahead to her last day on set.</p>
<p>The departure of such an iconic character is bound to be explosive, but will be it be a permanent exit for Liz?</p>
<p>Luckily for viewers the door will be left open for Liz to return, as Beverley explained to The Mirror that she is still totally in the dark about what will happen.</p>
<p>She said: ‘I’m due to film my final Corrie scenes in July and I have no idea what will happen.</p>
<p>‘The only thing I’ve been guaranteed is that Liz is not going to die. It would be really good if she found love and happiness, but I can’t see that happening.</p>

<p>‘I’ll miss the failed romances and the feuds, but not the fashion. On my last day I’ll set fire to Liz’s wardrobe.’</p>

<p>However she did tease that her exit is going to be one for the ages, telling OK Magazine that she was ‘in shock’ when she heard how the iconic character will exit.</p>
<p>‘I felt totally numb,’ she confessed.</p>
<p>‘I’ve been told that Liz is going to go with one hell of a bang! I can’t wait!’</p>
<p>She will be starring in a play called The Thunder Girls (Picture: ITV)</p>
<p>MD of Continuing Drama and Head of ITV in the North John Whiston said of Beverley leaving the Street: ‘With the character of Liz, Beverley Callard has gifted to Coronation Street 30 years of brilliant drama, comedy and everything in between. Whether it’s sharing a wicked joke with Eileen, raising an arch eyebrow behind the bar of the Rovers or giving some feckless man the full force of her tongue, Liz is a true Coronation Street icon. ‘And while we wish Bev well when she leaves to take on new challenges mid next year hopefully Weatherfield hasn’t seen the last of Liz!’</p>
<p>While discussing her decision, Bev praised Coronation Street for providing roles for older women, something she says is seriously lacking elsewhere in the industry.</p>
<p>She said: ‘There’s very little work in our industry for women over 50, but I’m 62 and recently I was doing three jobs at once. It made me realise how I was privileged to have the opportunity to do so when so many women my age no longer get the chance.’</p>
