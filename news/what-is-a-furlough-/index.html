<p>The coronavirus pandemic has already triggered an unprecedented surge in layoffs. As an increasing number of states have ordered all nonessential workers to stay home, a record number of Americans have filed for unemployment benefits. But in lieu of layoffs, many major companies bracing for a deep economic downturn have decided to furlough employees. But what does a furlough mean, exactly — and how is it different than being laid off?</p>
<p>In short, a furlough is an employer-mandated, temporary unpaid leave from work, which employers typically resort to as a cost-saving measure. Both public and private employees can be placed on furlough. (Government employees are often put on furlough during shutdowns.) But the specific terms of a furlough depend on where you work. You can be furloughed for as short as a few weeks, or as long as months. During this leave, you’ll likely retain your health-insurance benefits, though that’s not guaranteed. Unlike being laid off, if you are furloughed, you technically retain your job. However, furloughed workers still typically qualify for unemployment benefits, which have expanded under the $2 trillion coronavirus relief package that was passed last week.</p>
<p>“Unlike layoffs, furloughs reduce labor costs without adding new costs such as severance packages and outplacement services,” Jie Feng, an assistant professor in the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations told the Society for Human Resource Management. (Employers aren’t required by federal law to offer severance packages during layoffs, though it’s not uncommon.) And when business is on the upswing again, “employers do not have to pay for recruiting, selecting, socializing and training new employees because the furloughed workers can pick up where they left off.”</p>
<p>As the country reels from the economic toll of the coronavirus pandemic, various companies have announced that they’re furloughing employees: Macy’s, Kohl’s, and the Gap announced yesterday that they would be placing the majority of their staffs on furlough, joining a growing number of retail companies, such as Everlane and Nordstrom, to do so. Earlier this month, Marriott placed tens of thousands of employees on furlough. National newspaper publisher Gannett, which oversees titles like USA Today and the Des Moines Register, recently told many staffers they would be furloughed for five days a month through June. AMC Theatres, which closed all of its locations in early March, has laid off and furloughed approximately 26,000 people across the country, as well as 600 or so additional corporate employees. The list goes on and on — and is almost certain to keep growing.</p>

<h3 id="furloughing-what-is-it-who-is-doing-it-and-why-does-it-matter">Furloughing: What is it, who is doing it, and why does it matter?</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0pautjGBriYh3X1B28Z4lFMHGHg=/0x36:260x172/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16768928/640211270.jpg" alt="img">
The coronavirus has dealt a major hit to the economy worldwide. The stock market has seen some of its worst days in history during the past month. And the Federal Reserve is anticipating that the unemployment rate in the United States could jump to 32% — worse than it was during the Great Depression, the New York Post reports.</p>
<p>Although many companies are doing what they can to avoid letting workers go, some of them, including Apple, are even continuing to pay workers as if they were working their regular hours, others are turning to a different method — furloughs.</p>
<p>What is a furlough?</p>
<p>Furlough is a specific kind of forced leave of absence. It is unpaid, but the employee technically still keeps their job — if in name only, Fortune reports. The key difference between a furlough and being let go is that furloughs are meant to be temporary.</p>
<p>How do furloughed employees make money then?</p>
<p>In many areas, furloughed employees will be eligible for expanded unemployment benefits under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act signed Friday by President Donald Trump, The Atlanta Journal Constitution reports.</p>
<p>Additionally, some companies allow employees to keep their benefits even when furloughed, Fox Business reports.</p>
<p>While companies do not forbid workers from seeking other employment while furloughed, the current employment situation doesn’t offer a lot of hope for those seeking a new job.</p>
<p>Why are companies doing furloughs?</p>
<p>The largest benefit for a corporation in opting for furloughs rather than layoffs is the practice’s potential when it comes time to reopen. By furloughing employees, a company doesn’t have to hire or train new staff later on. they can just invite those furloughed employees to return to work, the New York Times reports.</p>
<p>Which companies are doing it?</p>
<p>More than half a million retail employees in the United States have been furloughed, Bloomberg reports. Macy’s, for example, has furloughed 125,000 employees, which is nearly all of their United States staff, save a few thousand operating online orders, CNN reports.</p>
<p>The following companies have announced furloughs.</p>
<p>CNBC reports additional retail furloughs from:</p>
<p>PYMNTS reports additional furloughs from the following non-retail companies:

Workers in Britain will receive a percentage of their wages as part of Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak’s plan to save the UK economy, which has been badly hit by the coronavirus outbreak. Mr Sunak has offered up to £330 billion to help out struggling workers and business owners. The Chancellor pledged to cover 80 percent of salaries up to £2,500 per month, with all employers able to apply to HMRC to pay the wages of people who are furloughed.</p>

<p>The Government’s website reads: &ldquo;If your employer intends to access the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, they will discuss with you becoming classified as a furloughed worker. “This would mean that you are kept on your employer’s payroll, rather than being laid off. To qualify for this scheme, you should not undertake work for them while you are furloughed. “This will allow your employer to claim a grant of up to 80 percent of your wage for all employment costs, up to a cap of £2,500 per month. &ldquo;You will remain employed while furloughed. Your employer could choose to fund the differences between this payment and your salary, but does not have to.&rdquo; READ MORE: Furlough warning: Martin Lewis exposes TWO reasons workers NOT paid</p>

<p>READ MORE Furlough scheme: Do you get taxed on furlough? What is furlough? A furlough is a temporary leave of employees due to special needs of a company or employer. In this case, furloughed workers are those unable to work due to the coronavirus pandemic because their place of work has been forced to close. Employers are now able to access support to continue paying part of their staff&rsquo;s wages, to avoid redundancies. This is part of what the Government has called the Job Retention Scheme, and employees who wish to access this should speak with their employers to be classified as a furloughed worker. Phil Crowe, Employment Law partner at Shoosmiths, said: “We are seeing a lot of businesses looking to go down the route of the Government’s Furlough Scheme (Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme), which will provide UK employers with support by paying 80 percent of the wages of staff who would have otherwise been laid off as a result of Coronavirus. “While, the measure has been widely welcomed by employers, its success will rely on employees agreeing and embracing the rules set out by the new scheme. “Employers and managers need to start anticipating possible job losses now and if they think they may need to use the scheme to help prevent redundancies, they need to start having these conversations with staff as soon as possible.

<p>“Employees are understandably worried and the earlier these discussions can happen the easier it will be to reassure staff about the potential measures that can be put in place to protect them financially. “The key is to have open, frank and honest communication with your team. Don’t make promises you can’t fulfil, but explain that the new programme should help businesses ride out the storm until the economy bounces back. “Set out the situation and make it clear what the alternatives are - for example if affected staff don’t agree to be furloughed in the short term it could have a domino effect and lead to wider problems for the business, including whole teams being made redundant or even in the worst cases businesses going under. “Now is the time for everyone to be working side by side. The Government’s new job retention scheme will only work if employers and employees work together and decide on a course of action which puts the business and its wider workforce first.” DON&rsquo;T MISS</p>

Your employer could choose to fund the differences between this payment and your salary, but does not have to. “If your salary is reduced as a result of these changes, you may be eligible for support through the welfare system, including Universal Credit.” Employees that have been furloughed have the same rights as they did previously. That includes Statutory Sick Pay entitlement, maternity rights, other parental rights, rights against unfair dismissal and to redundancy payments.
