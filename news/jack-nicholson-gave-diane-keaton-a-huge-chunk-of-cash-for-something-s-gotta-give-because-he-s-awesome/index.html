<p>Like with many other industries, Hollywood has been known to have its share of issues with gender pay gaps, which could explain why actors like Jennifer Lawrence took a stand against unequal pay back in 2017. The list of female actors who have been unfairly paid compared to their male co-stars is pretty long and includes names like Halle Berry, Charlize Theron, and Diane Keaton.</p>
<p>This could explain why Jack Nicholson felt the need to send Keaton a fat check following the 2013 film Something&rsquo;s Gotta Give.

<h3 id="how-jack-nicholson-saved-michael-caines-acting-career">How Jack Nicholson saved Michael Caine’s acting career</h3>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/faroutmagazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/How-Jack-Nicholson-saved-Michael-Caines-acting-career.jpg?fit=700%2C580&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
Jack Nicholson is a man of many talents. An actor and filmmaker who has performed for over sixty years and sits comfortably on three Academy Awards, an achievement that makes him one of the most celebrated figures on Hollywood.</p>
<p>While his professional ability seemingly knows no bounds, his off camera personality has garnered more than its fair share of rumours, headlines and urban myths over the years. The constant and remaining factor, however, is that everybody loves Jack Nicholson.</p>
<p>Michael Caine, Nicholson’s close friend and British counterpart, is a cinematic industry figure that owes his colleague in more ways than one. Well into his 80s now and still working on numerous projects, South Londoner Caine grew disillusioned with Hollywood and all the drama, workload and stress that came with it.</p>
<p>Having claimed his two Oscar victories and cemented his place in history, Caine resided back in London and took a major step away from the limelight while he considered his future. Working predominantly as a restaurateur, Caine owned five high profile establishments across Mayfair, South Beach Brasserie in Miami and more as the 1990s drifted away as he looked to call time on his acting career. That was, of course, until Nicholson intervened.</p>
<p>While reflection on his close call with retirement, Caine remembered: “…but I was even happier when Jack Nicholson, a wonderful actor, who was also in Miami at the time, persuaded me that the reinvention did not have to be so extreme,” in an excerpt from his memoir reported by EW. “Why not simply reinvent myself as a movie actor, as opposed to a movie star? A character actor, rather than a leading actor? (What’s the difference? Well, essentially it’s this. When movie stars get a script they want to do, they change it to suit them. When leading movie actors get a script they want to do, they change themselves to suit the script.)”</p>
<p>And that’s exactly what Caine did, joining Nicholson on the 1996 neo-noir thriller Blood and Wine and, reminiscing about his time on set with Nicholson, Caine fondly explained: “We were strolling towards the set when suddenly a cry went up: ‘The sun’s going! Hurry up, we’re losing the light!’ Everybody started dashing around, so I broke into a run too – until Jack held me back and said ‘Don’t run because they’ll know it’s us who’s late.’ That sums up his whole character in one line.”</p>
<p>Given Nicholson’s infamous reputation with the ladies, Caine also offered some advice on how to prepare for a night out with the iconic actor: “Wear old clothes and heavy-toed boots, because you’ll get trampled by women trying to get to Jack.”</p>
<p>See a clip of Caine discussing his relationship with Nicholson, below.</p>

<h3 id="new-book-the-big-goodbye-explores-jack-nicholsons-hollywood-heyday">New book ‘The Big Goodbye’ explores Jack Nicholson’s Hollywood heyday</h3>

<p>New book “The Big Goodbye: ‘Chinatown’ and the Last Years of Hollywood” burbles about how movietown egos all come in one size — extra large.</p>
<p>Like when Jack Nicholson was running hot, Sam Wasson writes: “His first day of shooting was always a minefield of concerns.”</p>
<p>Nicholson always needed only to discover the character’s id or odds so as to lock into whatever personal process the actor thought he’d then need to use. Full knowledge of whatever action the character was doing he didn’t then yet need to know. Why? Because that would curb the precious likelihood of spontaneous discovery he needed to save for the camera — whatever all that means.</p>
<p>He wanted to know the complete inside of the character. But not the outside.</p>
<p>Translation? Nicholson made it up as he went along. Now you know Jack about Jack.</p>
<p>Messing with the wrong breed</p>
<p>Doggone it . . . I have a bone to pick with our great brilliant columnist Bob McManus. Last week he barked: “Teacup [Yorkies] are the doggies all the other pups at Westminster make fun of — tiny, toothless and about as far removed from ancestral wolfdom as can be imagined.”</p>
<p>He then growled some more, and my own brand-new 4-month-old, tiny, 3 ³/₄-pound JellyBean — with lots of teeth — just arrived. My Yorkshire Terrier is so upset he unleashed his opinion right on Bob’s column.</p>
<p>This baby puppy, the fourth Yorkshire Terrier I’ve had, could be a mascot for our city. He’s my NEW YORKie. His breeder, Paula Segnatelli of Barnhill Kennels in Connecticut, is also rabid over McManus’ column.</p>
<p>Our ferocious JellyBean demands an apology — or some Great Dane may suddenly pay Bob a visit.</p>
<p>Royal flush</p>
<p>We’re up to our curtsies in royalty. Besides semi Prince Harry and his never Princess me-me-Meghan’s hunt for California property, there exists upon us some serious curtsying and bowing.</p>
<p>May 7 is the Claude Monet-Giverny-Versailles Foundation event. It’s “a prompt 7 o’clock receiving line” and “prompt 7:45 seated dinner” and “at a prompt 8 o’clock His Royal Highness the Prince Charles-Emmanuel of Bourbon-Parma will speak.” And there’s a royal receiving line, where you better be prompt. Anyone late gets cold porridge in a tumbrel.</p>
<p>Besides that, there’s Lady Anne Glenconner. Age 87. Her ladyship’s author of “Lady in Waiting: My Extraordinary Life in the Shadow of the Crown,” a memoir, out March 24. Seems she spent decades as lady-in-waiting to HRH Princess Margaret, sister to Her Maj.</p>
<p>This new book has juice that’s in the popular new series “The Crown.” I mean, have respect, we’re talking real type high-class regal royals.</p>
<p>It’s secrets from a lifelong insider. March 25 she’ll talk with Tina Brown at the 92nd Street Y on what’s it like in the royal circle — or maybe what’s it like running around inside its shake-ups.</p>
<p>Barking up the wrong tree</p>
<p>An official Democrat survey came to me requesting a $500-plus donation plus answers to: issues the GOP and Senate Republicans are out of step with … And: Rank Dem electoral priorities by their most/least importance level … And: TV and radio ads, or door-to-door canvassing, or rapid response to Republican dishonesty empowers candidates to reach more people … And: how to improve community-based get-out-the-vote efforts.</p>
<p>How about throwing out these surveys and just getting better candidates???!</p>
<p>To bolster our NYPD, de Blasio’s organized a new protection idea. A bra equipped with a gun holster. Now a woman will be safer on the streets. She’ll be carrying three 38’s.</p>
<p>Only in New York, kids, only in New York.
