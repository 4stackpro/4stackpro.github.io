Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a group of cancers that originate in the lymph nodes and affect white blood cells of the immune system called B cells. In NHL, B cells grow out of control and create tumors in the lymph nodes, spleen, or other tissues. According to the American Cancer Society, about 80,000 people will be diagnosed with NHL in 2020, and 20,000 will die of it.</p>
<p>Today, immunotherapy is one of the most promising treatment for cancer patients. Unlike radio- or chemo- therapies, immunotherapy aims to &ldquo;switch on&rdquo; the patient&rsquo;s own immune system to attack and eliminate the tumor. However, tumors, including NHL, often mutate to make themselves invisible to the immune system or even exploit interactions with immune cells to grow.</p>
<p>A team of researchers led by Elisa Oricchio at EPFL have now identified one of the mechanisms used by NHL to hijack the immune system. The scientists found that certain patients with NHL have a mutated and over-activated form of a protein called cathepsin S. This protein is responsible for cutting other proteins into small fragments that are then exposed on the surface of tumor cells. These fragments mediate communications between cancer and immune cells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When cathepsin S is active, cancer cells interact with immune cells called CD4+ T-cells, which help the tumor to grow, while they maintain social distance with CD8+ T-cells, which would attack and kill the tumor,&rdquo; explains Elie Dheilly, one of the lead authors of the study.</p>
<p>The identification of this duplicitous relationship between cancer cells and T-cells prompted the researchers to genetically eliminate cathepsin S to understand how tumor growth would be affected.</p>
<p>Inhibiting cathepsin S reduced tumor growth by inverting the communication with T-cells: CD8+ T-cells were now attacking the tumor, while CD4+ T-cells were kept at bay. This happens by inducing something called &ldquo;antigen diversification&rdquo;, which generates a different population of fragments helping T-cells to identify and kill tumor cells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We think that cathepsin S could represent an important therapeutic target,&rdquo; says Elisa Oricchio. &ldquo;Inducing antigen diversification is an attractive therapeutic strategy to increase tumor immunogenicity and enhance response to immunotherapies in lymphoma but possibly also in other tumor types.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the study, Elena Battistello, co-lead author, developed a new imaging technique to specifically measure the activity of cathepsin S. Using this technique, Oricchio and her team have identified and further developed new inhibitors (patent application filed) that could be used to improve the treatment of patients diagnosed with NHL.</p>

<h3 id="fda-grants-rmat-designation-to-tisagenlecleucel-for-relapsedrefractory-follicular-lymphoma">FDA Grants RMAT Designation to Tisagenlecleucel for Relapsed/Refractory Follicular Lymphoma</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cancernetwork.com/sites/default/files/cancernetwork_og.png" alt="img">
The FDA granted regenerative medicine advanced therapy (RMAT) designation to tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah) for an investigational new indication to treat patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma, according to Novartis, the developer of the CAR T-cell therapy.</p>
<p>According to a press release from Novartis, the RMAT program was developed under the 21st Century Cures Act in order to &ldquo;expedite the development and review of regenerative medicine therapies intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious condition.”</p>
<p>The designation was granted based on preliminary clinical evidence from the ongoing phase II ELARA clinical trial, which is evaluating the safety and efficacy of tisagenlecleucel in adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma.</p>
<p>“This designation supports the advancement of Kymriah, which could potentially address an unmet need in certain patients with follicular lymphoma, as we strive to reimagine medicine at Novartis,” John Tsai, MD, head of Global Drug Development and chief medical officer at Novartis, said in a press release. “These patients are often faced with the burden of several years of various treatments as their disease continues to progress.”</p>
<p>ELARA is enrolling patients aged ≥18 years with 1, 2, or 3A relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma. Exclusion criteria include CNS involvement or receiving prior anti-CD19 therapy, gene therapy, adoptive T-cell therapy, or allogeneic HSCT. Overall, the study’s target enrollment is 113 patients.</p>
<p>The primary endpoint for the trial is complete response (CR) rate, with secondary endpoints including overall response rate (ORR), duration of response, overall survival (OS), cellular kinetics, immunogenicity, safety, and patient-reported outcomes.</p>
<p>Tisagenlecleucel is designed to be a one-time treatment and is the first ever FDA-approved CAR T-cell therapy. According to the company, regulatory filing for tisagenlecleucel in relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma is anticipated in 2021.</p>
<p>Should tisagenlecleucel be approved in relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma, this will be the third indication for the therapy. Previous indications include indications in relapsed or refractory pediatric and young adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), as well as relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).</p>
<p>The CAR T-cell therapy has been found to cause side effects that can be severe or life-threatening, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or neurological toxicities. Patients who develop CRS may experience symptoms including difficulty breathing, fever, chills or shaking chills, severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, severe muscle or joint pain, very low blood pressure, or dizziness or lightheadedness. Additionally, patients with CRS may be admitted to the hospital and treated with other medications.</p>
<p>Moreover, patients with neurological toxicities may experience symptoms such as altered or decreased consciousness, headaches, delirium, confusion, agitation, anxiety, seizures, difficulty speaking and understanding, or loss of balance. Due to the risks associated with tisagenlecleucel, the therapy is only available through a restricted program under a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) called Kymriah REMS.</p>
<p>According to Novartis, follicular lymphoma is the second most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), representing approximately 22% of NHL cases. Further, throughout the lifetime of a patient with relapsing follicular lymphoma, they may be exposed to a median of 5 lines of prior treatment, with an upper range of 12 lines.</p>

<p>Hodgkins Lymphoma Vs. Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma</p>
<p>Some of you might be asking — what’s the difference between Hodgkins Lymphoma and Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma? Even though both of them are a type of lymphatic cancer, the difference between the two surrounds the type of lymphocyte that is involved. Doctors can determine whether the cancer is Hodgkins or Non-Hodgkins by examining the cancer cells under a microscope, and if they find an abnormal cell called Reed-Sternberg, then the cancer is determined as Hodgkins. If the cell is not present, then it is classified as Non-Hodgkins.</p>

<p>Treatment For Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma</p>
<p>Dr. Julie Vose, a medical oncologist at the University of Nebraska, talked to SurvivorNet about how CAR T-Cell therapy is one of the ways oncologists are trying to treat non-hodgkins lymphoma. According to Dr. Vose, CAR T-Cells are a living drug where T-Cells are taken from the patient in order to alert the cells that there is cancer and help them fight them off.</p>
<p>“As part of the treatment, cells are taken from the patient, they’re sent to a pharmaceutical company for genetic modification to try to make them more potent, or noticeable to the cancer cell, so they’re genetically modified with a vector which helps us attach the tumor cell in the patient to a patient’s own T-Cell which has been woken up to try to recognize the cancer a little bit more and fight it,” Dr. Vose tells SurvivorNet.</p>

<p>From there, the patient will receive three days of chemotherapy in order to help a patient’s damaged immune system and the patient will receive the modified T-Cells and will be monitored for a lengthy time in order to help patients through side effects. Dr. Vose explains that side effects can include low blood counts as well as risk of infection and bleeding. During treatment, some patients will need to receive blood transfusions and be on antibiotics in order to keep themselves safe.</p>
