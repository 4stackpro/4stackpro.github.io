A taxi driver in Spain was greeted with a round of applause as doctors at the Centro de Salud Ramón y Cajal in Alcorcón, Madrid wanted to show thanks for his kindness during the coronavirus outbreak. The taxi driver had been taking patients to the hospital without charging them. As a gesture of thanks the hospital gave him an envelope with money as well as the results of his coronavirus test, which were negative

EMOTIONAL FOOTAGE has captured the moment medical staff gathered to applaud a taxi driver in Spain who has been ferrying patients to and from hospital, free of charge.</p>
<p>The unnamed driver is one of the many unsung heroes to emerge from the ongoing crisis.</p>
<p>For the past few weeks, he has put his own health at risk to ensure others receive urgent medical care.</p>
<p>His selfless actions could well have saved the lives of countless people in the region.</p>
<p>With that in mind, one hospital decided to pay tribute to his tireless efforts.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>In a clip posted to Twitter, the taxi driver is surprised to find staff assembled around the entrance to the hospital.</p>
<p>They break into applause, while the ever-humble driver looks on.</p>
<p>It’s an emotional scene, with the man himself even appearing to well-up at the kind gesture organised by the appreciative doctors and nurses at the hospital.</p>
<p>To top it all off, one staff member hands him an envelope containing donations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Es una sorpresa que le hemos dado a un taxista que lleva a pacientes sin cobrar al hospital.Le hemos dado un sobre con dinero y una dedicatoria.Le hemos llamado para decirle que tenía que hacer un traslado y ha sido muy emocionante. No paraba de llorar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gracias a el y a ellos. pic.twitter.com/CcXX1BVfko — #ElTaxiUnido (@eltaxiunido) April 18, 2020</p>
<p>It all proved a little too much or the taxi driver who holds his hands up at one point in the clip, expressing a feeling of being humbled by their kind actions.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>His most emotional gesture follows, with the driver appearing to cross his arms in what has been interpreted as an indication that he would be hugging everyone there if he could.</p>
<p>A member of staff at the hospital told Marca: “We called him to tell him that he had to make a transfer.</p>
<p>“We have given him an envelope with money and a dedication. He kept crying, it has been exciting.”</p>
<p>Spain has been among the worst hit countries in the pandemic but has seen a drop-off in cases numbers over the past week as lockdown measures appear to have made an impact.

<h3 id="coronavirus-germanys-taxi-drivers-face-catastrophic-situation">Coronavirus: Germany&rsquo;s taxi drivers face &lsquo;catastrophic&rsquo; situation</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.dw.com/image/53210141_304.jpg" alt="img">
Leszek Nadolski couldn&rsquo;t believe his eyes when he recently pulled into a parking lot near Berlin&rsquo;s Tegel Airport. Hundreds of taxis and vans filled the lot — all out of service due to a steep drop in demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought to myself: this is terrifying,&rdquo; Nadolski, who heads the Berlin taxi guild, told DW.</p>
<p>Read more: Germany passes coronavirus aid package for workers</p>
<p>An estimated 3,000 of the nearly 8,000 taxis in Berlin have now been taken out of service. The rest of the vehicles still operating in the German capital aren&rsquo;t able to make much money under the current circumstances.</p>
<p>Over a 10-hour shift, drivers are earning an average of €50 ($54), Nadolski said, falling well-below Germany&rsquo;s €9.35 per hour minimum wage.</p>
<p>The situation is &ldquo;catastrophic,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen a drop in revenue of 80% to 90%.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nadolski is not the only one to describe the situation in such drastic terms. In the western German city of Cologne, taxi companies logged &ldquo;at least an 80% reduction&rdquo; in business in recent weeks, with over half of the 1,100-vehicle fleet staying home.</p>
<p>Taxis form part of Germany&rsquo;s local public transportation systems and have a legal obligation to operate unless told otherwise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter what&rsquo;s going on outside, no matter what type of disasters, terror attacks or severe weather — you can always rely on taxis. We&rsquo;ll continue to stay out there and offer our services,&rdquo; said Aleksandar Dragicevic, spokesman for Cologne&rsquo;s taxi association.</p>

<p>Adapting to stay afloat</p>
<p>In a bid to offset the financial damage, taxi companies across Germany have started broadening their services.</p>
<p>In Cologne, taxi companies are now offering to pick up groceries or medicine for clients who have already paid for the goods and deliver it to their homes. Taxi drivers can also pick up a customer&rsquo;s shopping list and money and go shopping for them for a set price.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to help people who aren&rsquo;t in a position to go shopping,&rdquo; Dragicevic said.</p>
<p>Read more: What&rsquo;s in Germany&rsquo;s emergency coronavirus budget?</p>
<p>Taxis in Düsseldorf and Hamburg are also providing similar delivery services for set prices. In Munich, taxis are offering to drive medical workers to work for free to minimize the risk of infection.</p>
<p>Berlin&rsquo;s taxi guild worked out a deal with the city-state government that allows cab drivers to offer lower prices for grocery and pharmacy deliveries than they would normally charge for a regular passenger fare. They also offer to pick up takeout food from restaurants and other items from shops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of the people who reach out to us are the elderly who don&rsquo;t want to leave their homes,&rdquo; Nadolski said.</p>
<p>Some drivers have been forced to find their own protective solutions</p>
<p>&lsquo;Forced to improvise&rsquo;</p>
<p>With the public taking extra precautions and wary of close contact, taxi companies emphasize they&rsquo;re doing everything possible to reduce the risk of infection to passengers.</p>
<p>Each driver has their own supply of disinfectant and thoroughly cleans the car seats, door handles and other areas after every passenger. The vehicles are also entirely disinfected at the end of the driver&rsquo;s shift.</p>
<p>In Berlin, the guild has secured a supply of masks for drivers and located a manufacturer who is outfitting the city&rsquo;s taxis with plastic screens. Nadolski said their initial protective barrier solutions were decidedly less impressive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My first screens were handmade in the kitchen with a saw,&rdquo; he said with a laugh. &ldquo;They looked like crap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The taxi association in Cologne hasn&rsquo;t been as lucky. They&rsquo;ve had to rely on homemade solutions so far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the moment we&rsquo;ve all been forced to improvise,&rdquo; Dragicevic said. &ldquo;Some have constructed barriers out of plexiglass, while others have used protective foil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bracing for bankruptcies</p>
<p>Thousands of taxi drivers have received help from the German government&rsquo;s emergency coronavirus budget, but the conditions of the support plan have also caused confusion and unease.</p>
<p>The financial aid plan provides direct financial support for the self-employed and companies with fewer than 10 employees. Dragicevic pointed out that &ldquo;theoretically&rdquo; the government aid bars recipients from using the funds to finance living expenses — putting many taxi drivers in a bind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they supposed to live off of then?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Read more: What you need to know about the coronavirus</p>
<p>The government plan recommends that self-employed workers apply for unemployment benefits to cover rent and other living expenses, a move that Dragicevic said creates &ldquo;unnecessary work.&rdquo; The national taxi association has raised the issue with the federal government, but has not received any &ldquo;clarification&rdquo; yet, he said.</p>
<p>The emergency aid plan also leaves small companies with more than 10 employees hanging on by a thread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The companies with over 10 employees have been hit the hardest. They haven&rsquo;t received any help,&rdquo; Nadolski explained. &ldquo;They have enough to survive four to five weeks — and then the first wave of bankruptcies will hit Berlin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking to the future after the pandemic subsides, Nadolski worries that the taxi industry will &ldquo;lose many vehicles forever&rdquo; as a result of the crisis. It could take a long time before things start to relax and more drivers can go out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very unusual. You worry about things in general,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But we have to live with it now.&rdquo;</p>
