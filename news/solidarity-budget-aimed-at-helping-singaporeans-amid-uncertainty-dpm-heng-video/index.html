<p>SINGAPORE: Nine in 10 Singaporeans will on Tuesday (Apr 14) receive the S$600 one-off cash payout announced as part of the Solidarity Budget earlier this month, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Last Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat announced that all adult Singaporeans aged 21 and above would receive a one-off Solidarity Payment of S$600 in cash.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The additional support was announced as part of a Solidarity Budget to provide help to firms, workers and households in response to the worsening COVID-19 pandemic that has affected many sectors in Singapore.</p>
<p>The S$600 is made up of S$300 that was announced in an earlier supplementary budget and an additional S$300 announced during the Solidarity Budget.</p>
<p>About 90 per cent of recipients who have previously provided their bank account details for Government payouts will receive the payment directly into their bank accounts on Tuesday, said MOF.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The ministry urged the remaining 10 per cent of recipients, for whom the Government does not have bank account details, to provide their details via a secure Gov.sg form no later than Apr 23. SingPass access is required.</p>
<p>These Singaporeans will then receive the payout in their bank accounts on Apr 28.</p>
<p>Those who have not provided bank account details by Apr 23 will receive the Solidarity Payment through cheques sent to their NRIC-registered addresses in stages, from Apr 30 onwards.</p>
<p>A one-off payout of S$300 will also be given to permanent residents (PRs) aged 21 and above this year who have a Singaporean parent, spouse or child, said MOF.</p>
<p>The S$300 payout will also be given to Long-Term Visit Pass-Plus holders aged 21 and above this year.</p>
<p>Eligible PRs can sign up for the payment at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sppr">https://go.gov.sg/sppr</a> with their SingPass from now until May 10.</p>
<p>Those who provide their bank account details while signing up can expect to receive the payment directly in their bank account on May 19.</p>
<p>Those who do not provide their bank account details will receive cheques in stages from the end of May.</p>
<p>Long-Term Visit Pass-Plus holders will receive the payout in stages from the end of May and do not need to apply for it.</p>
<p>The Solidarity Budget marks the third support package announced by authorities to help Singapore weather the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>It followed the Unity Budget in February and the record-breaking S$48 billion Resilience Budget on Mar 26.</p>
<p>Altogether, Singapore will be committing S$59.9 billion, or about 12 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), for this battle against the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>As of Saturday, the country has confirmed 2,299 COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>Eight people have died from complications related to the novel coronavirus so far.</p>

<h3 id="coronavirus-9-billion-to-go-out-in-april-to-help-families-businesses-says-dpm-heng-swee-keat">Coronavirus: $9 billion to go out in April to help families, businesses, says DPM Heng Swee Keat</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/articles/2020/04/12/ycfam120420.jpg?itok=t83NZlH_" alt="img">
SINGAPORE - About $9 billion in support measures will be rolled out to families and businesses in April, said Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on Sunday (April 12).</p>
<p>This includes a one-off payout of $600 which nine in 10 Singaporean adults will receive on Tuesday (April 14) through their bank accounts.</p>
<p>The rest can provide the Government with their bank details and get the money by April 28, or receive this &ldquo;Solidarity Payment&rdquo; by cheque from April 30 onward.</p>
<p>In an interview with CNA938 radio station, Mr Heng said he fully understood the difficulties facing businesses beset by the coronavirus pandemic, but urged them to use the Government&rsquo;s support packages to retain their workers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the support, we should work together to tide over this very difficult period,&rdquo; said Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister.</p>
<p>One of the most immediate measures to be rolled out is the Solidarity Payment, he noted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope that this will provide some support, especially for our low-income families,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Mr Heng also recapped other support measures under the Unity, Resilience and Solidarity budgets - three support packages which, combined, amount to a $59.9 billion war chest against Covid-19.</p>
<p>Firms and tenants badly hit by the economic fallout from Covid-19 have called on the Government to provide more help, more quickly, as have several trade associations and parliamentarians representing them during the Budget debates.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Mr Heng noted that all firms will get 75 per cent of the first $4,600 of each local worker&rsquo;s monthly wages subsidised by the Government for this month, under the Jobs Support Scheme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a very significant support, and I hope that businesses do their part in keeping their workers, retaining them, so that we can emerge stronger after this,&rdquo; said Mr Heng.</p>
<p>The Government is also looking at &ldquo;various indicators&rdquo; to see how much more might be needed from past reserves to help Singapore meet the fallout from the pandemic, he added.</p>
<p>But he urged businesses and Singaporeans to focus on how to make the best use of the amounts already allocated to ride through this difficult period.</p>
<p>For now, containing the spread of the virus is the foremost priority, said Mr Heng, reiterating the importance of staying home and taking safe distancing measures seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enhanced distancing measures will be inconvenient, but it is far more important to protect one another, and bear with the inconvenience,&rdquo; he said.
