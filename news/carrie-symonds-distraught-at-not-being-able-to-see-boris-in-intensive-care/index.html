Carrie Symonds has not been able to see the prime minister since he fell ill with Covid-19 (Picture: PA/Getty)</p>
<p>Boris Johnson’s heavily pregnant fiancée Carrie Symonds has been left ‘distraught’ at not being able to see the prime minister after spending two nights in intensive care.</p>
<p>The prime minister, 55, spent a second night on the ICU at St Thomas’ Hospital, in London, after being taken there on Sunday night due to deteriorating Covid-19 symptoms lasting 10 days.</p>
<p>Miss Symonds, 32, who is recovering from coronavirus symptoms herself, was ‘in tears’ after receiving a call informing her that Mr Johnson had been admitted to hospital due to his ‘persistent symptoms’.</p>
<p>A friend told The Telegraph that former government adviser Miss Symonds, who is expecting the couple’s first child in the early summer, broke down at the news and was ‘deeply upset and concerned for his wellbeing’.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson was put on oxygen support and it was later confirmed that he was not on a ventilator.</p>
<p>Downing Street confirmed on Wednesday afternoon that the PM was in ‘good spirits’, was ‘responding to treatment’ and remains in a stable condition in intensive care.</p>
<p>The pair, who usually live together in the No 11 Downing Street flat, are said to have been apart for almost two weeks since the prime minister fell ill on March 27.</p>
<p>Miss Symonds, who is in the vulnerable category being pregnant, has been isolating in the couple’s £1.3 million Camberwell, south London, home with their dog Dilyn.</p>
<p>The prime minister’s biographer Sonia Purnell described the situation for the pair as ‘horrible, horrible’ and ‘just ghastly’.</p>
<p>The PM had been documenting his symptoms before he went to hospital</p>
<p>Miss Symonds has been ‘distraught’ that she can’t visit the PM in hospital (Picture: Reuters)</p>
<p>‘You can’t even accompany your loved one in the hospital. I can only imagine the agony of Carrie Symonds, his fiancee, who as we know is due to give birth in the early summer,’ Ms Purnell told Sky News.</p>
<p>‘This is a nightmare all round and also a nightmare for the whole country.’</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Queen sent a letter to Miss Symonds and the Johnson family to tell them they were in her thoughts and that she wished the PM a speedy recovery.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Miss Symonds shared an image of herself on Twitter saying she was recovering well from the virus.</p>

<p>She wrote: ‘I’ve spent the past week in bed with the main symptoms of coronavirus. I haven’t needed to be tested and, after seven days of rest, I feel stronger and I’m on the mend.’</p>
<p>Being pregnant with Covid-19 is obviously worrying. To other pregnant women, please do read and follow the most up to date guidance which I found to be v reassuring: https://t.co/JPvIDeB3l6 — Carrie Symonds (@carriesymonds) April 4, 2020</p>
<p>Miss Symonds is now heavily pregnant and expecting in early summer (Picture: Downing Street)</p>
<p>The mum-to-be shared a second post directing social media users to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) advice page for pregnant women and their families.</p>
<p>She wrote: ‘Being pregnant with Covid-19 is obviously worrying. To other pregnant women, please do read and follow the most up to date guidance which I found to be v reassuring.’</p>
<p>Miss Symonds will likely have to keep away from her fiancé for the remainder of her pregnancy, as she is in the ‘at risk’ group of people who could suffer severe coronavirus complications and are advised to avoid non-essential contact for 12 weeks.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has been deputising in the prime minister’s absence. He said he was confident the PM and his ‘friend’ would ‘pull through’ the illness and be back to continue leading the country through the pandemic shortly.</p>

Boris Johnson’s pregnant fiancee Carrie Symonds said on Saturday she was “on the mend” after suffering coronavirus symptoms. (PA)</p>
<p>Boris Johnson’s fiancée Carrie Symonds has received a huge outpouring of support after the prime minister moved to intensive care unit (ICU) suffering from coronavirus.</p>
<p>Johnson was admitted to St Thomas’ hospital in central London on Sunday after testing positive for COVID-19. He was moved to the ICU after his symptoms worsened the following day.</p>
<p>Symonds, who is pregnant, said on Saturday she was “on the mend” after also suffering from symptoms.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old, who is expecting the couple’s baby in early summer, falls into the group of vulnerable people urged by the government to avoid contact with those with symptoms of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Carrie Symonds said on Saturday she was &ldquo;on the mend&rdquo; after suffering from symptoms of coronavirus. (PA)</p>
<p>A number of people have spoken out in support of Symonds as she recovers and deals with her partner’s illness.</p>

<p>“His circumstance is such that he will be required to self-isolate for seven days.”</p>

Boris Johnson’s pregnant fiancee has been self-isolating and says she has been in bed for past week</p>
<p>The prime minister’s pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds, has revealed that she is in recovery after suffering coronavirus symptoms.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old former government adviser, who is expecting the couple’s baby in early summer, falls into the group of vulnerable people urged to avoid contact with those who have symptoms of Covid-19.</p>
<p>Posting on Twitter on Saturday afternoon, Symonds, who has been in self-isolation since Boris Johnson tested positive for the virus, says she has been suffering with Covid-19 for the past week, despite not being officially diagnosed with the disease.</p>
<p>Johnson said last week that he had tested positive for coronavirus and would self-isolate in Downing Street for seven days. On Friday he said he would spend more time in isolation as he still had a temperature.</p>
<p>Shortly after his announcement, Symonds - who usually lives with the prime minister in the No 11 flat - shared a photograph of herself self-isolating in Camberwell, south London, with the couple’s dog Dilyn.</p>
<p>In the Twitter post, she wrote: “I’ve spent the past week in bed with the main symptoms of coronavirus. I haven’t needed to be tested and, after seven days of rest, I feel stronger and I’m on the mend.”</p>
<p>Carrie Symonds (@carriesymonds) I’ve spent the past week in bed with the main symptoms of Coronavirus. I haven’t needed to be tested and, after seven days of rest, I feel stronger and I’m on the mend.</p>
<p>In a second post, with a link directing users to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) advice page for pregnant women and their families, she added: “Being pregnant with Covid-19 is obviously worrying. To other pregnant women, please do read and follow the most up to date guidance which I found to be v reassuring.”</p>

<p>While pregnant women do not appear more likely to contract coronavirus than the general population, pregnancy itself alters the body’s immune system and response to viral infections in general.</p>
<p>Guidance from the RCOG says viral infections can “occasionally be related to more severe symptoms and this will be the same for Covid-19”.</p>
<p>It says that while the risks are small overall, health professionals should look out for more severe symptoms of Covid-19 in pregnant women who test positive, such as pneumonia and a lack of oxygen.</p>
<p>But the RCOG said the current expert opinion is that unborn babies are unlikely to be exposed to Covid-19 during pregnancy. There is also no data at the moment suggesting an increased risk of miscarriage for pregnant women.</p>
<p>The RCOG reiterates government advice that pregnant women “should pay particular attention to avoiding contact with people who are known to have Covid-19 or those who exhibit possible symptoms”.</p>
<p>It adds: “Women above 28 weeks’ gestation should be particularly attentive to social distancing and minimising contact with others.”</p>
<p>Johnson and Symonds, a former director of communications for the Conservative party, announced in February that they were engaged to be married and were expecting a baby.
