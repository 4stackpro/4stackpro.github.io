Dakota Johnson has been keeping the public outings to a minimum as she quarantines with boyfriend Chris Martin.</p>

<p>Chic outing: Dakota Johnson, 30, cut a chic look in black and white Saturday as she made a supply run with Chris Martin at Vintage Grocers in Malibu during a break from isolation</p>
<p>The 30-year-old sported a white tank top, tucked into a pair of high-waisted black and white pinstripe trousers.</p>
<p>She finished the look with some chunky black cat-eye sunglasses and a pair of black and white checkered Vans.</p>
<p>Johnson took off her black face mask and disposable gloves as she walked to her black Ford Shelby GT350.</p>
<p>Martin, 43, donned a teal sweatshirt with a blue trucker hat and a disposable face mask as he stepped into the passenger seat.</p>
<p>Hot wheels: Martin, 43, donned a teal sweatshirt with a blue trucker hat and a disposable face mask as he stepped into her black Ford Shelby GT350</p>
<p>The couple previously collaborated on a hand-washing video, posted by pal Olivia Wilde, who wrote: &lsquo;Dakota Johnson: Hand wash CHAMPION.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She stood at her kitchen sink as the Coldplay frontman stood out of frame behind her, locking arms with her to make it look like his hands were hers.</p>
<p>The Suspiria star narrated Martin&rsquo;s every unpredictable movement: &lsquo;I like to scrub them really, really fast, but I’m going to lower them because sometimes I hit myself in the face.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Although the couple appears to be isolating at his Malibu home, Johnson showed off her own Hollywood Hills digs last month.</p>
<p>She and her three-bedroom 1947 house just off the Sunset Strip were featured on the cover of Architectural Digest.

<p>Dakota Johnson, the “Fifty shades of grey” star, has a seducing smile</p>
<p>Everyone knows Dakota Johnson for her role of Anastasia Steele in the film «Fifty Shades of Grey. In reality, erotic romantic drama series «Fifty shades of grey» consists of three sequels including «Fifty Shades of Grey» (2015), «Fifty Shades Darker» (2017) and «Fifty Shades Freed» (2018). Dakota Johnson has been in a romantic relationship with Chris Martin since October 2017. Her boyfriend hasn&rsquo;t proposed her yet, though.</p>
<p>Dakota Johnson and her «Fifty shades of grey» co-star, Jamie Dornan, have intense sexual chemistry in the movie but in life their relationship is somewhat tense. They aren&rsquo;t enemies, of course. Dakota Johnson should not be confused with Dakota Fanning, another actress who is four years her younger. Johnson guested the show of Ellen Degeneres and behaved in a little awkward way.</p>
<p>These days, the fans of Dakota Johnson have shared her incredibly beautiful photo on Instagram. She&rsquo;s having a rather modest makeup but still looks so seducing! By the way, she is the daughter of actors Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. Few people know that the first movie with her was a dark comedy «Crazy in Alabama» (1999), that was also starring her mother.</p>
<p>Dakota Johnson&rsquo;s fans adore her not only for her attractive appearance but also for her great actor talent. It&rsquo;s no surprise that the actress&rsquo; net worth has reached $14 million dollars.

January 2018: They were seen together multiple times in California.</p>
<p>Dakota Johnson and Chris Martin have been together since 2017. Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP; Jeff Kravitz / Contributor</p>
<p>The duo had dinner together at Soho House in Malibu, marking the first of a series of dates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chris and Dakota arrived together in Chris&rsquo; car. They met up with friends and had a fun night. They both seemed very happy. They were flirty, and also left the restaurant together,&rdquo; an eyewitness told People.</p>
<p>Days later, they were seen walking arm-in-arm on the beach.</p>
<p>A source told People, &ldquo;They seem to be getting more serious. On Friday, they had dinner with friends. They also hung out at Chris&rsquo; house and went for a beach walk. They didn&rsquo;t see each other over the holidays and seem excited to be catching up now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although they entered through a private entrance, Johnson and Martin also attended Stella McCartney&rsquo;s Autumn 2018 Collection together in Los Angeles in January.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They walked in holding hands and Dakota was not letting go – she was super into the PDA. When Chris let go of her hand, she slipped her arm through his,&rdquo; an eyewitness told People.
