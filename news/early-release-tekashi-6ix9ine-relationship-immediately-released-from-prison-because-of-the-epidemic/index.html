<p>Tekashi 6ix9ine has left prison early as part of a nationwide effort in America to stem the coronavirus outbreak in US jails.</p>
<p>A judge confirmed the rapper, whose real name is Daniel Hernandez, does not have the virus but is considered high risk because of his asthma and previous hospital treatment for bronchitis.</p>
<p>According to 6ix9ine&rsquo;s legal team, he&rsquo;ll complete the remaining four months of his two-year sentence under home arrest wearing a GPS ankle monitor.</p>
<p>Last year, the 23-year-old pleaded guilty to a series of gang robberies and shootings.</p>
<p>US District Judge Paul Engelmayer, who originally sentenced him, suggested the current pandemic presented &ldquo;extraordinary and compelling reasons&rdquo; for a compassionate release.</p>
<p>He also said Daniel Hernandez &ldquo;will no longer present a meaningful danger to the community&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Lisa Evers, a US journalist who has been covering the trial for local station Fox 5 News, claimed she had spoken to the rapper&rsquo;s legal team who said he will be allowed to return to social media and plans to work on two new albums.</p>
<p>In October 2019 it was reported that he had signed a new $10 million (£8 million) record deal.</p>

<p>At his 2019 trial, the rapper initially denied the charges against him but entered a plea bargain, giving evidence against other gang members in order to get a reduced sentence after potentially facing a maximum of life in prison.</p>
<p>He testified against former members of Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods.</p>
<p>The offences 6ix9ine was charged with include racketeering, carrying a firearm, assault with a dangerous weapon, and conspiracy murder charges.</p>
<p>Racketeering is when people use criminal actions to repeatedly take money from others, often associated with protection rackets.</p>
<p>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The rapper will reportedly work on new music from home</p>
<p>It all came from his association with a violent US gang Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods - also known as TreyWay - which 6ix9ine had spoken about on Twitter.</p>
<p>He joined the gang in 2017 but left less than a year later.</p>
<p>The inner workings of the gang was exposed by 6ix9ine - and another ex-gang member, Kristian Cruz.</p>
<p>Nine Trey Bloods committed robberies, dealt drugs and were violent against rivals and each other according to their testimonies.</p>
<p>6ix9ine gave information on Anthony Ellison and Aljermiah Mack and both men have since been convicted.</p>
<p>Ellison was also found guilty of kidnapping 6ix9ine, maiming and assault - while Mack was also found guilty on drug dealing charges.</p>

<h3 id="6ix9ines-lawyer-says-rapper-can-release-music-in-home-confinement-could-be-back-on-social-media">6ix9ine’s Lawyer Says Rapper Can Release Music in Home Confinement, Could Be Back on Social Media</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/nnimig4qzacwznkzmbmz/tekashi-6ix9ine-music-home-confinement-kevin-mazur" alt="img">
Now that Tekashi 6ix9ine is no longer beyond bars, people have a lot of questions about what’s next for the rapper. But now one thing is more clear: there will be more music soon.</p>
<p>Complex caught up with the rapper’s attorney Dawn Florio just hours after it became public that 6ix9ine was out of prison. The rapper was released from the Queens Detention Facility, where he was being held, to home confinement. He’ll spend the final four months of his 24-month sentence at home because his asthma puts him in a high-risk group of contracting COVID-19 in prison.</p>
<p>When asked if the terms of his home confinement included the ability to put out new tracks, Florio was unequivocal.</p>
<p>“Yes, he can release music,” she said.</p>
<p>But what kind of music? Florio confirmed that earlier reports about 6ix9ine re-upping with his label 10K Projects were true.</p>
<p>“What he’s gonna do is, he already has that advance for 10K Projects,” Florio explained. “So he has to put out a Spanish album and an English album. So that’s what he’s going to be working on.”</p>
<p>Just prior to speaking with Complex, coincidentally, Florio said she was speaking with 6ix9ine’s entertainment attorney Bob Celestin, planning the rapper’s return.</p>
<p>“We were actually trying to figure out the logistics of how that’s going to work,” she revealed. “It’s more difficult because of the coronavirus, because you don’t want strange people coming in to set up a studio where he’s going to be.”</p>
<p>But they don’t want to wait too long to build that studio. Florio told Complex that her conversation with Celestin made clear that new 6ix9ine music has to come soon.</p>
<p>“He already got an advance for all those millions of dollars,” she recalled the entertainment lawyer explaining to her. “So he&rsquo;s gotta put out those two albums as soon as possible. I can confirm that from Bob.”</p>
<p>And what about social media? Will 6ix9ine continue to keep the Instagram-using masses entertained while they’re waiting for him to finish his songs? Looking at the available paperwork, Complex came to the conclusion that he could. Florio agreed.</p>
<p>“So far, I haven’t seen any restrictions about him not being able to go on social media,” she said. But there is a condition.</p>
<p>“Obviously, it has to be in good taste. No more trolling,” Florio laughed.
