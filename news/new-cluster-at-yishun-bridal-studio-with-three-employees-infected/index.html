A new cluster involving three female staff members of The Wedding Brocade bridal studio in Yishun Industrial Street was identified yesterday as the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced 42 new confirmed Covid-19 cases in Singapore.</p>
<p>These 42 cases comprise 24 imported infections and 18 local ones who have no recent travel history abroad, and bring the country&rsquo;s total number to 844.</p>
<p>Ten of the new cases are not linked and contact tracing is ongoing.</p>
<p>The Wedding Brocade said in an Instagram post yesterday that its first staff member tested positive last Thursday, and the store was closed immediately after that.</p>
<p>Two other staff members tested positive over the next few days. Everyone who was in the bridal salon from last Monday to Thursday have been issued quarantine orders by MOH.</p>
<p>A thorough disinfection of the studio was conducted in accordance with the National Environment Agency&rsquo;s procedures, said The Wedding Brocade, which will be closed for the next two weeks.</p>
<p>The three Wedding Brocade infections are Case 810, announced yesterday, and Cases 745 and 802, announced last Saturday.</p>
<p>Case 810 is a 22-year-old Singaporean woman now warded at Changi General Hospital.</p>
<p>Case 745 is a 36-year-old Singaporean woman warded at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and Case 802 is a 28-year-old Singaporean woman warded at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (NTFGH).</p>
<p>The Health Ministry also gave more information on Case 741, which was announced last Saturday. She is a 42-year-old nurse at Sengkang General Hospital with no travel history to affected countries or regions who had turned up for work before being admitted to hospital.</p>
<p>The permanent resident reported the onset of symptoms last Tuesday and test results confirmed that she had Covid-19 on Friday.</p>
<p>Contact tracing is ongoing.</p>
<p>She is the second nurse to be infected with Covid-19 and is in an isolation room at Sengkang General Hospital. The first - Case 167 - was a Filipino emergency department nurse working at NTFGH.</p>
<p>MOH said 14 more cases have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, bringing the total number of cases discharged to 212.</p>
<p>There are 19 people in critical condition in the intensive care unit, while 206 cases who are clinically well but still test positive remain isolated at Concord International Hospital, Mount Elizabeth Hospital, Gleneagles Hospital and the community isolation facility at D&rsquo;Resort NTUC.</p>

<p><img src="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12587668/16x9/991/557/56b6f7d1654d36defcd824bdd2247809/ey/wedding-brocade-office.png" alt="img">
SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 42 new COVID-19 cases on Sunday (Mar 29) and a new cluster at a bridal studio.</p>
<p>This brings the total number of COVID-19 cases in the country to 844.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Of the new cases, 24 are imported and had travelled to Europe, North America, Middle East, ASEAN and other parts of Asia, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) in a press release.</p>
<p>Eight of the new cases are linked to previous cases, while 10 of the new cases currently have no links.</p>
<p>Contact tracing is under way for a total of 71 locally transmitted cases to establish any links to previous cases or travel history to affected countries or regions, MOH added.</p>
<p>The ministry also reported on Sunday a new cluster linked to bridal studio The Wedding Brocade, which is at 1 Yishun Industrial Street 1. Two cases announced previously - Cases 745 and 802 - and a patient announced on Sunday - Case 810 - are linked to this cluster.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>In a post on its Instagram page, The Wedding Brocade said all three COVID-19 cases are its employees.</p>
<p>The bridal studio was closed after the first case was confirmed on Mar 26, it said, adding that all employees who were in the studio from Mar 23 to 26 have been issued a quarantine order.</p>
<p>On Mar 27, it ordered a &ldquo;thorough disinfection&rdquo; of the studio, which will be closed for the next two weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have provided all contact tracing details to MOH, as well as conducted our due diligence in contacting all our clients who were in the studio during the time period, including those that were in contact with the affected staff (members) outside of the studio,&rdquo; the post read.</p>
<p>There are now 423 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in hospitals, and most are stable or improving, MOH said. Nineteen cases are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.</p>
<p>A total of 206 cases who are clinically well but tested positive for COVID-19 have been isolated at Concord International Hospital, Mount Elizabeth Hospital, Gleneagles Hospital and the community isolation facility at D’Resort NTUC.</p>
<p>Another 14 patients have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, the ministry added. In total, 212 people in Singapore have now fully recovered from COVID-19.</p>

<p>The ministry also gave an update on Case 741, which was announced on Mar 28.</p>
<p>The 42-year-old Singapore permanent resident, who is employed as a nurse at Sengkang General Hospital, has no travel history to affected countries or regions.</p>
<p>She reported the onset of symptoms on Mar 24, and subsequent test results confirmed COVID-19 infection on Mar 27 afternoon. She is currently warded in an isolation room at Sengkang General Hospital.</p>
<p>Prior to hospital admission, she had gone to work. Contact tracing is ongoing, the health ministry said.</p>
<p>Singapore reported its third death from COVID-19 on Sunday afternoon. The patient, a 70-year-old Singaporean with no recent travel history to affected countries and regions, died at 12.12pm.</p>
<p>He had a history of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, and died after 27 days in the ICU.</p>
<p>A Singaporean&rsquo;s passport was cancelled by authorities after he breached stay-home notice requirements. He returned to Singapore from Batam and was served with a stay-home notice on Mar 19.</p>
<p>However, he decided to return to Indonesia on the same day despite Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officers warning him that he would breach the stay-home notice and could face penalties.</p>
<p>On Mar 24, he arrived in Singapore again and was issued a second stay-home notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In view of the wilful breach, ICA has cancelled his passport and referred the case to MOH for investigation into his breach of SHN requirements,&rdquo; ICA said.</p>
