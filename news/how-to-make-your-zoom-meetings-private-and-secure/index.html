How to make your Zoom meetings private and secure</p>
<p>Zoom is an effective video conferencing tool.</p>
<p>Since the coronavirus began disrupting normal ways of working and social life, individuals and organisations have adopted Zoom at an increasing rate, but is privacy and security being overlooked?</p>
<p>For years, Zoom has been used as an effective video conferencing tool by organisations of all shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>The last few months have seen adoption levels in Zoom surge. This is down to two reasons; 1. Organisations, increasingly aware of their environmental footprint, are striving to cut down air travel and conduct meetings virtually, and 2. Coronavirus — with social distancing measures in place, organisations have been forced to host meetings virtually.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the second reason is the main reason for the surge in Zoom use. However, once this pandemic is over, it is likely Zoom (and other video conferencing solutions) will retain their place as key tools for organisations.</p>
<p>This rise in the necessity of video conferencing solutions, like Zoom, in order for businesses to effectively work from home and maintain a ‘business as usual approach’ is not without its privacy and security challenges.</p>
<p>According to Toni Vitale, head of data protection at JMW Solicitors LLP, “there are several privacy concerns with Zoom particularly if you do not alter the default settings. For example, the host of a Zoom call has the capacity to monitor the activities of attendees, while screen-sharing. If attendees of a meeting do not have the video window in focus during a call where the host is screen-sharing, after 30 seconds the host can see indicators next to each participant’s name indicating that the Zoom window is not active. Employee monitoring is permitted under data protection laws; transparency is key. Employees need to be told that their activities are being monitored. In the rush to get everyone online I doubt many companies checked their HR policies.”</p>
<p>Top 10 tips for effective video conferencing Most organisations will be reliant on video conferencing to maintain a normal working environment during the current coronavirus pandemic. Read here</p>
<p>The administrator is king/queen</p>
<p>The administrator has access to everything. They can see detailed views of how, when and where the users are using the conferencing solution, with detailed dashboards of real-time user activity.</p>
<p>“Zoom also provides a ranking system of users based on total number of meeting minutes. If a user records any calls via Zoom, administrators can access the contents of that recorded call, including video, audio, transcript, and chat files, as well as access to sharing, analytics, and cloud management privileges,” continued Vitale.</p>
<p>“For any meeting that has occurred or is in-process, Zoom allows administrators to see the operating system, IP address, location data, and device information of each participant. Administrators also have the ability to join any call at any time on their organization’s instance of Zoom, without in-the-moment consent or warning for the attendees of the call,” he added.</p>

<p>How to make your Zoom meetings private and secure</p>
<p>To avoid the new phenomenon of ‘zoombombing’, organisations should follow the below advice.</p>
<p>“If the zoom reference number is shared on social media and the host fails to set screen-sharing to ‘host only’ this can allow uninvited guests to screen-share pornography or other disturbing imagery. Meeting hosts should also disable ‘file transfer’ to prevent any malware being shared,” said Vitale.</p>
<p>“Like any technology, Zoom can be useful tool, but privacy and It security should not be put to one side for the sake of ease of use.”

<h3 id="5-ways-to-protect-your-zoom-meetings-from-hackers">5 Ways to Protect Your Zoom Meetings From Hackers</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/getty_497260520_2000133320009280326_416283.jpg" alt="img">
Zoom quickly became the go-to tool for remote teams, teachers, and pretty much everyone who needs a little face-to-face time, even if only virtually. In fact, I wrote this week about how it&rsquo;s quickly become one of the most important apps&ndash;period.</p>
<p>Of course, as the vast majority of people start working from home, it shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise that the hackers have gone to work. Apparently, one of their favorite new tricks is to crash your Zoom party. In some cases, the party crashes aren&rsquo;t just there to snoop on your meeting or family reunion, they are taking over and sharing inappropriate material.</p>
<p>To protect your meeting, here are a few things you should do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disable Guest Screen Sharing</li>
</ol>
<p>By restricting screen sharing to the host, you can prevent anyone else from being able to display what is on their desktop. It won&rsquo;t stop anyone from joining your meeting, but it will at least keep them from taking over the meeting and sharing inappropriate material.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Require the Host to Be Present</li>
</ol>
<p>Zoom does provide the option for your meeting to start when the first person joins, even if it&rsquo;s not the host. This can be convenient if you&rsquo;re hosting a meeting but running a few minutes behind. Everyone else can get started in the meantime.</p>
<p>If you want to protect your meetings, however, it&rsquo;s best to turn this off. That way, you&rsquo;ll know that no one can start your meetings without you&ndash;including a hacker or &ldquo;Zoombomber&rdquo; (yes, that&rsquo;s apparently a real term). To do this, make sure the &ldquo;Join before host&rdquo; setting is off (it&rsquo;s off by default).</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Keep Your Personal Meeting ID Private</li>
</ol>
<p>Don&rsquo;t share your personal meeting ID (PMI) online. If you do, it&rsquo;s relatively easy for anyone to find it and join any meeting you&rsquo;re hosting. Instead, use a unique meeting ID for each separate meeting. When you schedule a meeting, you can have Zoom do this by default. Just make sure &ldquo;Use Personal Meeting ID when scheduling a meeting&rdquo; is toggled off.</p>
<p>By the way, this won&rsquo;t only keep away bad actors away, it also helps make sure that you don&rsquo;t accidentally end up with the attendees from your next meeting dropping in early.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Use a Password</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do use your PMI, you can enable the feature in Zoom that protects those meetings with a password, and only share it with the people you want in your meeting. Just be careful not to share it online, otherwise it defeats the entire point.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Use the Waiting Room</li>
</ol>
<p>Another option is to enable to waiting room feature, which places every guest in a virtual waiting room before the meeting starts. When you&rsquo;re ready, you&rsquo;ll then have to manually admit your guests. This gives you control over who can attend and makes it easier to keep unwanted guests out.</p>
<p>The downside is that if you&rsquo;re meeting with a large number of participants, it can be cumbersome to have to manually admit everyone. In addition, if someone joins the meeting late, you&rsquo;ll need to be paying attention and let them in. Still, if it&rsquo;s important to you that only your invited guests attend your meeting or webinar, this is probably the most reliable way to control who gets in.</p>

<h3 id="just-how-private-are-your-zoom-meetings">Just how private are your Zoom meetings?</h3>

Just how private are your Zoom meetings?</p>
<p>Just how private are your Zoom meetings?</p>
<p>Video conferencing has in recent days enjoyed an unprecedented surge in popularity.</p>
<p>From business conferences to classroom lectures to yoga sessions, these platforms have been playing a big part in enabling isolated individuals to interact with one another.</p>
<p>Naturally, a benefactor of these odd circumstances are companies that offer teleconferencing tools. Some of the major players include Microsoft Teams, Alibaba’s Dingtalk, and most notably, Zoom.</p>
<p>13 million people currently use Zoom each month, while the platform now has more than 20 million new mobile users, logging in an impressive 1,270 percent increase in downloads in the month of February.</p>
<p>Known for it’s ease of use, massive capacity, and quirky features (there’s a beauty ‘touch-up’ filter), the ‘Zoom-appeal’ is clear.</p>
<p>Zoom, however, has a dark side. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak that saw its usage spike, the company’s security had already taken a few hits.</p>
<p>Mac users, for instance, were forced into calls unknowingly, and Zoom-bombings, where hackers enter private calls uninvited, occurred aplenty.</p>
<p>Zoom took a rather blasé approach to this, which doesn’t speak well about their priorities. Given the number of people using Zoom today, it is worthwhile to take a closer look at Zoom’s privacy policy.</p>
<p>Is your Zoom call really private?</p>
<p>Not quite, apparently. Zoom states that it collects personal data such as name, physical and email address and phone numbers – even if you don’t have an account, and someone shares a Zoom link with you.</p>
<p>Also, Zoom promises that they will not sell personal data, but what ‘sell’ means is up to individual interpretation. The company said that data might be shared with third-party advertisers.</p>
<p>This might seem like the norm (after all, does Facebook and Google not share data as well?), but there is a disturbing clause in the policy. Parked under the label ‘consumer content’ is information that can be found in ‘cloud recordings, IMs and shared files in a service’.</p>
<p>This means that Zoom would have access to video and audio recordings, transcripts, and names of everyone on a call. If exposed, this information would make sensitive information discussed in corporate meetings vulnerable.</p>
<p>But even at individual level this isn’t good news – think about personal therapy sessions conducted on the platform, for example.</p>
<p>How much control does the host have?</p>
<p>A lot – much of a user’s data lies in the hands of the meeting host.</p>
<p>One particularly eerie feature on Zoom is the ‘attention tracker,’ where hosts can record and track if participants clicked away from the Zoom window when a screen is shared.</p>
<p>Zoom is fortunate in the sense that it meets US privacy standards. Stack it against EU’s GDPR, however, and it will barely scrape by.</p>
<p>At such a time where people’s livelihoods are, quite literally, hinging on to it, Zoom has the responsibility to ensure that data is secured and shared in ways that would not harm the user.</p>
<p>The company is riding on an all-time high (Zoom has even acquired ‘verb status’), and it would be a shame to see it crash because they were apathetic about data privacy.
