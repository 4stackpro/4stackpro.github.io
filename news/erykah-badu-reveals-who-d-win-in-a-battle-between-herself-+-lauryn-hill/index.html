R&amp;B singer Erykah Badu is giving credit where it’s due. After seeing a tweet asking fans who’d win in a hits battle against the iconic Lauryn Hill, Badu dished back a response to somebody saying The Fugees legend would come out victorious.</p>
<p>Erykah Badu Puts Respect On L-Boogie’s Name</p>
<p>Badu acknowledged Hill’s greatness and says it’d be no contest for her.</p>
<p>“I’ll be pulverized…” – Erykah Badu Twitter</p>
<p>The Future Of Concerts Is Digital</p>
<p>Badu has been looking into the future. The veteran crooner has shared her interest and intent to move forward with pursuing paid online concerts for musicians to connect with fans. Last week, she dished on her recent successful string of quarantine performances she put on. In addition to putting respect on her own name, Badu also acknowledged how her creation could encourage peers to come up with their own paid, online concerts.</p>
<p>“Here we are, proof of concept,” she said. “It can be done and it can be done by an artist, who can erase the invisible lines between myself and fans, or in this case, the user. Instead of going through streaming services, who handle the payments from customers and pay me, the artist, 30 cents or 10 cents, I could directly do business with the people I am serving. It’s a magnificent feeling. … I learned that I don’t mind taking the weight or the loss, because if it encourages other artists to use this new platform to sustain themselves and their ecostystem, then it’s worth it. My mom said, ‘If you don’t know what you’re doing, it’s because it has not been done.” (Forbes)</p>
<p>Wait, There’s More</p>
<p>In early April 2020, Badu put on a must-see performance. She recently shared a highlight clip from her “Apocalypse 2: The Experimental Room” concert.</p>
<p>“4/5 APOCALYPSE 2 : THE EXPERIMENTAL ROOM / window seat : Featuring Badu and her electronic band THE CANNABINOIDS (( @robfree @picnictyme @dja1 @djbigtexas ))ON HER OWN PLATFORM BADUWORLDMARKET. . . Live from BADUBOTRON From THE QUARINTINE CONCERT SERIES . YOU witnessed an interactive Livestream experience that allowed the user to choose which room / world each song was performed inside of . The three rooms the user chose between were BEDROOM , BASA NOVA , and EXPERIMENTAL.” -Erkyah Badu’s Instagram</p>
<p>Before You Go</p>
<p>Back in February 2020, Badu announced plans to put out her own line of vagina-smelling incense. Rap entertainers Trippie Redd and Tierra Whack didn’t hold back their reactions. The hip-hop pair hit up Badu’s Instagram comments section to weigh-in on the huge announcement. Clearly everybody was a fan of the product, as it sold out in twenty minutes.

<h3 id="erykah-badu-responds-to-fan-who-says-shed-win-battle-against-lauryn-hill">Erykah Badu Responds To Fan Who Says She&rsquo;d Win Battle Against Lauryn Hill</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/image/740x416/cover/1587781052_0eefb2179def9a551b2e2402eb2a53d6.jpg/adc4e58c840defcc35c4dd274b148a06/1587781052_a3a946a035a795a7fb24eead131220bd.jpg" alt="img">
Has there been a hip hop-R&amp;B-neo soul battle yet? We&rsquo;ve watched artists and producers go toe-to-toe, and fans are calling for Verzuz to give the ladies their time to shine. We&rsquo;ve seen a number of musicians pair up on Instagram Live, including the most recent Verzuz match involving Babyface and Teddy Riley that pulled in over 4 million viewers in total. Instagram even reportedly malfunctioned for a bit because they weren&rsquo;t prepared for that sort of response.</p>

<p>Recently, a side-by-side photo of Erykah Badu and Lauryn Hill began to circulate asking who would win between the two. A Twitter user wrote, &ldquo;I’m riding with my girl fat belly! &hellip; What y’all think!?&rdquo; The post caught the attention of Ms. Badu who humbly recognized that her sister-in-music would take the crown. &ldquo;I’ll be pulverized&hellip;,&rdquo; she responded.</p>
<p>After weeding through the jokes about Lauryn Hill being late, there were fans of both women who debated who they believed would take the title. Erykah Badu obviously has a bigger catalog, considering that Lauryn just released one solo studio album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill and had two records with The Fugees. However, both ladies are deeply respected as artists and have worked with various others in the industry over the years, creating hitmaking music. Would you tune into this one?

<h3 id="when-i-listen-to-the-miseducation-of-lauryn-hill-i-relive-every-important-moment-of-my-life">When I Listen to The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill I Relive Every Important Moment of My Life</h3>
<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/culturecomforts-index-1586439141.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">
Whether it&rsquo;s a movie, a TV show, a book, an album, a podcast, or whatever—we all have that one piece of culture that brings us comfort in good times and in bad. So, we&rsquo;re asking celebrities (who might star in your own culture comfort) what it is they turn to in those moments. Ahead of the second episode of Oh Hello: The P’dcast (which is asking listeners to donate to United Way of New York&rsquo;s Covid-19 Community Fund) Nick Kroll talks about The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a huge habitual person. There are very few things that I go back to and re-watch and re-listen to all the time. For whatever reason, I just don&rsquo;t function that way day-to-day. But the Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is an album that always comes to mind. It came out in ‘98 and I remember being a sophomore in college and I didn&rsquo;t have a great year that year. I was depressed and the album immediately brought me so much joy and I would dream about Lauryn Hill. I just fell in love with her and fell in love with the album.</p>
<p>Shortly after it came out she was in DC performing on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, and one of my friends got us tickets the day of the show. So we all went to the concert at Constitution Hall, and our tickets were literally the last row. After the opening act (who I didn’t care about at the time but turned out to be OutKast) I snuck down to the second row of the venue. I somehow slipped down to the second row and watched the whole show by myself, mesmerized. Then after the show I got split up from my friends. This was pre-cellphone days. I was wandering around the venue and then came upon all these people waiting for autographs.</p>
<p>So I was like, I don&rsquo;t really want an autograph, I just want to meet Lauryn Hill. So I waited and she came out with her band and people were asking for autographs. Then I went up to her and her band and I looked at her and I said, &ldquo;You are the essence of woman.&rdquo; She was like, &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was kind of struck by it. Then I blew it after that, by being like, “Much love on your message,” and she&rsquo;s like, okay. But I had a brief moment where I said the perfect thing to Lauryn Hill.</p>
<p>Lauryn Hill at the 1999 MTV Video Music Award Rehearsals. Jeff Kravitz</p>
<p>So then, of course, my love for her in that album only grew because that experience was so impactful. That summer, after that year, which had been a tough year, I went and did a relief trip in Honduras and Israel. We had no CD player. So I bought a cassette for the bus of the album, and we listened to that album in the van rides wherever we were going, everywhere. In Honduras, we were helping to rebuild a town that had been destroyed during hurricane Mitch. We&rsquo;d go back and listen to that album and then driving through the West Bank in Israel, listening to that album over and over and over again.</p>
<p>Then I moved to New York and that was around the time the first iPod came out. And I got the iPod and that was the first album I bought on Apple music. I was navigating New York and on the subway and walking around and trying to get acting jobs or whatever, listening to that album. Because it was one of the albums I actually bought and got on my Apple music. So then as we’ve moved away from buying music on Apple, it’s always been in that main rotation on my Apple music. You know those albums that you bought and now they&rsquo;re on every Apple product that you have? So it has traveled with me and every sort of media form I&rsquo;ve had of music.</p>
<p>Like every kid in the city and in the suburbs who grew up in the mid-&rsquo;90s. The Fugees were such a huge crossover. You hear Lauryn Hill talk and she grew up around black kids and Jewish kids and everyone else. So I think their music spoke to everybody because it was such beautiful hip-hop and also Lauryn Hill’s music was so good at referencing sounds from the past. A few years ago I listened to a great episode of the Dissect podcast that broke it all down.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s super timeless. She&rsquo;s referencing all of this from the history of R&amp;B and soul and you have Motown and you feel like you&rsquo;re hearing Stevie Wonder. You&rsquo;re hearing Donny Hathaway. You&rsquo;re hearing all of this other stuff inside of it. Now that that album has been out for over 20 years, it&rsquo;s in and of itself a classic that has played throughout so many people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>It is such a warm album and even I&rsquo;d just look at the album cover of carving it into a school desk. There&rsquo;s just something warm about that feeling of looking at a well-worn school desk. Then there&rsquo;s something about the orange hue of it and her face. Then the skits where it&rsquo;s just a loud sort of vibrating classroom of a bunch of kids having a conversation with a teacher that they like, is really kind of warm and comforting. I mean it sounds crazy, but feels sort of a sweet and comforting and moment of innocence. Especially right now, there&rsquo;s something really nice about that—knowing that kids are not in school together.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just a quality to her voice that is so ageless. You&rsquo;re like, this is Lauryn Hill and moments where you&rsquo;re like, this is Nina Simone and this is Roberta Flack and also this is hip-hop. At this moment right now when things feel so uncertain and up in the air, to be able to listen to something where the foundation of it is so solid and so pure that it feels somewhat unshakeable.</p>
<p>Sometimes at a moment like this, getting nostalgic can provide some hope for the future. Remembering how things were can make you feel like, Oh we can get back to that.</p>
<p>When I listen to The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill today I&rsquo;m transported back to all the different moments of my life. To the first time I listened to that in my dorm room. Back to that concert where a couple of my friends passed out, and locked themselves in the bathroom and I was like, I got to keep my shit together to go see Lauryn Hill. I can still remember what she&rsquo;s wearing. She&rsquo;s wearing a long denim skirt and these wooden heels. Then I&rsquo;m transported back to being on a bus with 15 other people listening to that cassette. Force feeding it on people. Then I&rsquo;m transported back to walking around New York City trying to fill a day or trying to get pumped up for an audition. Or post 9/11, I’m walking around New York, in those early days, in 2002. I just graduated and had moved to New York and that was another time when things felt so kind of bleak and the world will never be the same again. For me I&rsquo;m not just transported to one place in time, because this album has been such an important part of my life.</p>
<p>We’re separate right now and it seems hard to imagine getting big groups of people together, but I think about Dave Chappelle’s Block Party, which is a great snapshot in comedy where they also bring Lauryn Hill and the Fugees back together. It&rsquo;s just this big community gathering, and I can&rsquo;t wait for us to be able to do something like that again.</p>
<p>I can’t wait for a sophomore—a 19-year-old, 20-year-old—today to be able to go see whoever their Lauryn Hill is and fall in love with an album and an artist. We&rsquo;re going to be back together again at some point. I don&rsquo;t know when that&rsquo;s going to be, but I&rsquo;d like to just have that as a light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>As told to Matt Miller.
