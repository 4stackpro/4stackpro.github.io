<p>On June 15, 2020, a screenshot of an actual Craigslist advertisement seeking “Excited and enthusiastic MINORITY Actors and Actresses” to “hold signs” at an event in Tulsa, Oklahoma began to make the rounds on social media.</p>
<p>Twitter users attempted to make the connection that the ad was hiring minorities to work at President Donald Trump’s upcoming rally, which was re-scheduled for June 20, 2020, after it was originally planned for Juneteenth, a day commemorated as the end of slavery in the United States. The announcement of the rally’s location also sparked controversy because Tulsa was the site of the 1921 massacre of hundreds of Black people by a white mob.</p>
<p>Gee, I wonder what event this could be for. pic.twitter.com/FNtAuB6fgc — Sophie Goldstein (@RedInkRadio) June 15, 2020</p>
<p>The ad also placed the location for the gig at “Third St near Denver Ave,” which is across the street from the Bok Center where Trump’s rally will be held. The ad also offered $10 as compensation, but it’s unclear whether that amount is hourly, or for one day of work.</p>
<p>While many factors connect the ad to the location and date of the Trump rally, Snopes is unable to contact the original source for the ad, and thus can’t determine whether this was an attempt to hire actors with minority backgrounds to hold up signs at the rally.</p>
<p>The ad was taken down by Craigslist administrators on June 15, 2020. Snopes was unable to contact the person who posted the ad, but has contacted Craigslist for comment, and will update this post if we receive a response.</p>
<p>The page now says:</p>
<p>Social media posts calling out supposed Craigslist ads that solicit paid actors to show up as supporters frequently pop up before Trump rallies. Snopes identified one from November 2019 as “Unproven.” We also investigated others from July 2016 and August 2017 that were rated “Unproven,” and one from October 2018 we rated as “False.”</p>
<p>Since we are unable to prove whether the Craigslist ad seeking minority actors and actresses is in any way connected to the Trump rally being held on the same date, we rate this claim “Unproven.”

<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/L3M5XME6AYI6VPQGV5KRJ3QDQU.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
Rep. Mark DeSaulnier (D-Calif.) will be one of more than three dozen lawmakers who cast historic votes Wednesday by proxy voting, officially designating different House members to cast colleagues’ votes on their behalf.</p>
<p>Most of those lawmakers, expected to be Democrats, are using the new proxy rule because the coronavirus pandemic has made them fearful of traveling from afar to Washington, a pandemic hot spot, or because traveling from their remote home to the Capitol has become very difficult because airlines have cut back on flight options.</p>
<p>Not DeSaulnier.</p>
<p>His use of the new rule comes from having just overcome a life-or-death battle with pneumonia that began after the 68-year-old veteran marathoner fell while running on the Mall. DeSaulnier broke some ribs and hurt his spleen, but his age and a weakened immune system from battles with cancer and pneumonia made his situation perilous.</p>
<p>He spent five weeks in an intensive care unit, including four on a ventilator, and at one point was given a 10 percent chance of survival as he battled some covid-19-like symptoms that have led to nearly 100,000 deaths in the United States. He wasn’t suffering from the virus, but it was just as devastating, and one morning his family expected to get the worst call possible.</p>
<p>“The next day, my sons, expecting a phone call from the hospital saying I had passed away in the night, instead get a phone call that I was a little bit better,” DeSaulnier said on Facebook, which was then reported by the San Francisco Chronicle. “Every day I got better. There were lots of challenges, (but) eventually my eyes opened.”</p>
<p>This week marks his first one back at work, taking up work on committee assignments — all of which will be done over video conferencing, also part of the new rules change.</p>
<p>Under the proxy rules, DeSaulnier is one of at least 15 Californians who will vote through another lawmaker. As of Tuesday afternoon, 39 Democrats had submitted letters to congressional officials explaining their absence and who will vote on their behalf. DeSaulnier will direct Rep. Doris O. Matsui (D-Calif.) how he would vote on legislation this week, and she will cast that vote on his behalf.</p>
<p>“I am so grateful every day for every breath, every day,” he said.

<p>TULSA, Okla. — A post on Craigslist is pulling at heartstrings, titled, “Anybody need a grandma for Christmas?”</p>
<p>The listing comes from a Tulsa woman in despair, who claimed she has no family and would really like to be a part of one this holiday, according to a report by KJRH.</p>
<p>But, as social media would have it, the post has since been deleted when the woman received hateful messages. However, that hate is fueling a love-filled search to find the woman and make her Christmas one to remember.</p>
<p>It all started Wednesday evening when Carson Carlock was scouring the internet.</p>
<p>“I go through the free part of Craigslist pretty often just looking for stuff because sometimes people give away stuff for free,” Carson said.</p>
<p>The latest ad to flash across his screen, wasn’t something for sale.</p>
<p>“I saw that post, and I was like, ‘You know that’s really sad.’”</p>
<p>The post was titled, “Anybody need a grandma for Christmas?” It goes on to say, “I cook, and I’ll cook dinner and even bring gifts for the kids. I just don’t want to be alone because it hurts.”</p>
<p>The ad ends with “Let me be a part of your family.”</p>
<p>It was a plea that tore at Carson’s heart, reminding him of his own mother.</p>
<p>“That really broke my heart reading that because my mom was alone on her last Christmas.”</p>
<p>It’s a thought still haunting Carson today. His mother, Gail, was diagnosed with stage four cancer last year. She fell ill quickly, making her unable to travel from Oklahoma City to Tulsa for the holidays.</p>
<p>Carson tried to travel to his mom, but car troubles prevented him from making the trip.</p>
<p>“It was really not a good feeling just knowing, hearing her on the phone, and she’s like ‘I’m all alone.’”</p>
<p>It’s a conversation Carson won’t soon forget. His mother died last year, and her memory is one he hopes to keep alive.</p>
<p>“She would want me to be the kind of person to do this for other people.”</p>
<p>A unique Craigslist ad, “Grandma for Christmas,” seemed like the perfect opportunity to honor Carson’s late mother and spread a little holiday cheer. However, before he could reach out, he saw the post marred with hate.</p>
<p>“A lot of people started sending her hateful messages” Carson said. “I understand that everybody can be wary about it because there’s a lot of bad things happening in the world right now.”</p>
<p>Posts accused the “grandma” of having ill-intent, using the ad to take advantage of the families willing to welcome her into their home. The woman, claiming she just wanted to be a part of a family, posted an update after the negative feedback. She thanked everyone for the “extra shot of pain.” The post was then deleted.</p>
<p>Carson decided to act.</p>
<p>“I don’t want anyone else to feel that way,” he said.</p>
<p>Carson made his own Craigslist ad, asking the “grandma needing a family,” to reach out so he could help her have a wonderful Christmas.</p>
<p>“I posted it, and it kind of went viral,” he said.</p>
<p>Two-thousand people shared the post overnight on Facebook. Thousands of people across the country came to the “grandma’s” defense, ready to welcome her into their home.</p>
<p>“I just want you to know that you aren’t alone,” Carson said. “If you find yourself wanting to be a part of a family on Christmas, just reach out.”</p>
<p>Carson said he did get in contact with the “grandma” through email, her name is Carrie. However, because of all the negative feedback she is hesitant to reach out to anyone about joining them for Christmas.</p>

A LONELY Grandmother posted a Craigslist advert asking to join a family for Christmas.</p>
<p>Carson Carlock, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, found the cry for help while browsing through the classified ads website – and took it upon himself to help the despairing pensioner.</p>

<p>The post read: “Anybody need a grandma for Christmas?”</p>
<p>“I can cook, and I can cook dinner. I&rsquo;ll even bring food and gifts for the kids!</p>
<p>“I HAVE NOBODY AND IT REALLY HURTS.</p>
<p>The post ended with the plea: “Let me be a part of your family.”</p>
<p>He also related to the pensioner’s plea as his mother, who died last year, spent her last Christmas alone.</p>
<p>She was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer and was too ill to travel to be with loved ones – so her son viewed the opportunity to honour his mother’s memory.</p>
<p>Carson, a chef at Mazzio’s pizza restaurant, told KJRH: &ldquo;&ldquo;I go through the free part of Craigslist pretty often just looking for stuff because sometimes people give away stuff for free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw that post, and I was like, ‘You know that&rsquo;s really sad.’</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would want me to be the kind of person to do this for other people.”</p>
<p>However, some people took issue with the pensioner’s cry for help, leading to the vulnerable woman deleting her post.</p>
<p>Carson said: &ldquo;A lot of people started sending her hateful messages”</p>
<p>“I understand that everybody can be wary about it, because there&rsquo;s a lot of bad things happening in the world right now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want anyone else to feel that way.”</p>
<p>The grandma then thanked everyone for an “extra shot of pain” before the post was deleted.</p>
<p>But Carson created a new Craigslist advert asking the &ldquo;grandma needing a family&rdquo; to contact him.</p>
<p>And his post went viral and was shared thousands of times.</p>

<p>He wrote on Facebook: “Carrie is the most loving and sweet person, I wish I could share with you more about her but she has asked to keep it private.</p>
<p>“She is so wonderful and I will be seeing her Christmas Day. Thank you guys so much for your support and love. Merry Christmas guys!”

<h3 id="baby-offered-for-sale-for-500-on-craigslist-and-sister-thrown-in-for-free">&ldquo;Baby offered for sale for $500 on Craigslist and sister &lsquo;thrown in for free&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/11/26/15/21488842-0-image-a-7_1574780719092.jpg" alt="img">
An alarming listing on Craigslist purportedly offering a newborn baby for sale in Florida in exchange for $500 has sparked a state investigation.</p>
<p>The ad, titled &lsquo;Selling a baby - $500 (kendall fl), reads: &lsquo;Selling brand newborn baby for $500. Baby is 2weeks old. It sleeps, don&rsquo;t make noise at night. Formula and clothes will give to you. Can give you the baby 4 year old sister for free.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The author of the online classified goes on to say that he or she lives in a &lsquo;quiet influential neighborhood and works for the Florida Department of Children and Families.</p>
<p>This ad was placed on Craigslist in Florida last Friday purportedly offering a two-week-old baby for sale in exchange for $500, and the infant&rsquo;s toddler sister free of charge</p>
<p>The ad indicated that the person who posted it lives in Kendall, Florida</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t wanna be judged for not wanting these kids,&rsquo; the copy concludes.</p>
<p>The Florida Department of Law Enforcement has launched a probe to determine whether the ad offering a child for sale was genuine, or whether it was a prank.</p>
<p>Miami Herald, which first reported on the incident, said state agents have interviewed a woman suspected of putting up the ad on Craigslist on Friday, but she denied being the culprit.</p>
<p>DailyMail.com on Tuesday reached out to the FDLE, Craigslist and The Florida Department of Children and Families for comment on this case and was awaiting a reply.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that someone has attempted to sell a child on Craigslist.</p>
<p>Deanna Greer and John Cain, from Tennessee, were arrested in 2017 for placing an ad on the popular classifieds site selling their five-month-old baby for $3,000.</p>
<p>The parents were caught in a sting operation after trying to hand over their child to an undercover officer posing as a buyer.</p>
<p>The author of th ad wrote he or she does not want to be &lsquo;judged for not wanting these kids&rsquo;

No stage, no problem! The cast of critically-acclaimed play Tilda Swinton ANSWERS AN AD ON CRAIGSLIST launches Zoom-style web series during coronavirus lockdown. They join a number of artists finding new and creative ways to entertain audiences with non-traditional means during the international pandemic while shows are on hold.</p>
<p>The web series, like the play, stars Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Instagram celebrity Tom Lenk. Lenk plays an exaggerated version of himself along with the other cast members including writer/actor Byron Lane, director Tom Detrinis, and co-stars Mark Jude Sullivan and Jayne Entwistle. The series follows the cast as they cope with issues like coronavirus quarantine.</p>

COVID-19 Crisis</p>
<p>Kaiser Health News: Congress Approves Boost In Food Aid For Seniors But Funding Falls Short Of Growing Need Advocates for senior citizens hailed the bipartisan passage of a federal bill that calls for boosting money for nutrition programs so that fewer older adults go hungry. But the proposed funding still wouldn’t keep up with America’s fast-growing senior population. The legislation reauthorizes the Older Americans Act, which provides for home-delivered and group meals for anyone 60 and older while supporting an array of other services, such as transportation and in-home care. (Ungar, 3/12)</p>
<p>Politico: McConnell Delays Senate Recess Amid Coronavirus Crisis And FISA Deadline Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday that the Senate will delay its recess scheduled for next week to continue working on an economic relief package to address the coronavirus outbreak. &ldquo;Notwithstanding the scheduled state work period, the Senate will be in session next week,&rdquo; the Kentucky Republican tweeted. &ldquo;I am glad talks are ongoing between the Administration and Speaker Pelosi. I hope Congress can pass bipartisan legislation to continue combating the coronavirus and keep our economy strong.&rdquo; (Levine and Desiderio, 3/12)</p>
<p>The Hill: Pelosi: House &lsquo;Close&rsquo; To Striking Deal With Trump On Coronavirus Response Package The sides have been at odds over several provisions of the sweeping, multibillion-dollar package. Republicans, for instance, have balked at the Democrats’ paid leave proposal, fearing it creates a permanent entitlement benefit, in lieu of simply addressing the current coronavirus. Democrats, for their part, have objected to GOP demands that the legislation include language explicitly prohibiting the use of federal funds for abortion services. (Lillis and Wong, 3/12)</p>
<p>ABC News: Coronavirus-Relief Bill Aims To Expand Free School Lunch Program With coronavirus-related school closures looming, federal lawmakers have proposed a bill that includes help for families that are struggling to feed their kids while at home. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act, presented to the House on Wednesday, includes a provision for expanding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) that provides money for low-income families to purchase healthy food. The proposal is one of at least eight provisions up for consideration by the Senate. (Carrega, 3/12)</p>
<p>Politico: Pelosi And Mnuchin Closing In On A Deal On Coronavirus Aid Package The final sticking points involved complex talks led by Mnuchin and Ways and Means Chairman Richie Neal (D-Mass.) over sick leave for employees impacted by the coronavirus as well as their family members, said multiple Democratic and GOP aides. Pelosi and Mnuchin held several conversations throughout Thursday. Pelosi then tapped Neal to try hammer out an accord over the paid leave issue with Mnuchin, said Democratic aides. The multibillion-dollar House proposal — which aims to shore up safety-net programs like food aid and unemployment insurance — represents Washington&rsquo;s most aggressive response to the growing coronavirus crisis, which has sent financial markets into a panic as it quickly spreads across the globe. (Bresnahan, Ferris and Caygle, 3/12)</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal: Pelosi Says House, Trump Administration Near Coronavirus Pact Efforts to put together a bill began only this week as lawmakers have rushed to respond to the pandemic that has tanked financial markets and infected more people world-wide. Democrats delayed procedural steps Thursday on the bill to allow for further negotiations and the possibility that they could amend the legislation. Republicans had raised concerns about the Democratic proposal to offer paid leave, criticizing the decision to have the Social Security Administration run the program in particular. Mrs. Pelosi said during a Thursday press conference that Democrats were reviewing proposals from Mr. Mnuchin. (Duehren and Andrews, 3/12)</p>
<p>Los Angeles Times: Coronavirus Fallout: Deal On Economic Stimulus Package Is Near The deal — being forged by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) and Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin via frequent phone calls — is expected to eliminate insurance co-payments for COVID-19 testing and provide billions of dollars in aid to state and local governments for food programs and unemployment benefits. It is also expected to include up to 14 days of sick pay for workers dealing with the coronavirus who don’t receive sick pay from their employers and up to three months’ leave for people who need to care for sick relatives.

<p>The Washington Post: Hopes Of Bipartisan Deal Rise As White House, Democrats Negotiate Coronavirus Relief “We’ve resolved most of our differences, and those we haven’t we’ll continue to have a conversation — because there will obviously be other bills,” Pelosi told reporters outside of her office in the Capitol, at the end of a long day of intense talks with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The legislation will include measures to boost paid family leave and unemployment insurance, ensure free coronavirus testing, and strengthen nutritional aid like food stamps. The emerging agreement builds upon a bill House Democrats released late Wednesday that included a number of provisions Republicans opposed, setting off hours of frenzied negotiations on Capitol Hill to reach bipartisan consensus. (DeBonis, Werner and Stein, 3/12)</p>
<p>The New York Times: Congress Nears Stimulus Deal With White House As Wall Street Suffers Rout Financial markets plunged on Thursday in the biggest one-day drop since the Black Monday stock market crash of 1987, and Congress neared a deal with the White House on a sweeping economic rescue package to respond to the colossal effect of the coronavirus pandemic. After a day of intense negotiations between Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, Ms. Pelosi told reporters that “we’ve resolved most of our differences” and the House would vote on Friday on the measure “one way or another.” It would then go to the Senate, which called off a recess that had been scheduled for next week in anticipation of a compromise. (Cochrane, Smialek and Tankersley, 3/12)</p>
<p>The legislation will include measures to boost paid family leave and unemployment insurance, ensure free coronavirus testing, and strengthen nutritional aid like food stamps. The final sticking points between House Democrats and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, the administration&rsquo;s point person on the deal, involved paid sick leave. The House is expected to vote on Friday, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) canceled the Senate&rsquo;s weeklong recess next week to assess the legislation.</p>
<p>The Washington Post: Trump&rsquo;s Long-Standing Ties To Cruise Industry Tested By Coronavirus Pandemic Huddled with donors at his private Mar-a-Lago Club on Friday, President Trump told supporters that he was intent on protecting the cruise industry from the fallout of the coronavirus crisis — even as top health officials and other key advisers were privately pushing him to keep the public off the ships. Two days later, the State Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned U.S. citizens, particularly those with medical issues, not to travel by cruise ship, sending the industry into a panic, according to people familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions. (Dawsey, O&rsquo;Connell, Parker and Reinhard, 3/12)</p>
<p>The Washington Post: Trump Says Still ‘Lots Of Options’ For Tokyo Olympics, After Call With Japan’s Abe President Trump praised Japan&rsquo;s preparations for the Summer Olympics and said there were still &ldquo;lots of options&rdquo; for holding the Games, only hours after suggesting they might have to be postponed for a year due to the coronavirus outbreak. The shift in the president’s tone came after a phone call with Japanese leader Shinzo Abe. (Denyer, 3/12)</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal: Coronavirus Crisis Tests Trump’s Unusual Governing Style President Trump’s rare prime-time speech Wednesday was designed to reassure the nation about his administration’s response to a quickly spreading coronavirus. Instead, Mr. Trump’s scripted speech included errors about health-insurance payments and European travel restrictions, people involved in the speechwriting said Thursday. He also inserted his own mistakes as he spoke, the people said. (Bender, 3/12)</p>
<p>The Washington Post: For Trump, The Coronavirus Crisis Is All About The Numbers — And They Don’t Look Good During weeks of briefings and discussions over the escalating coronavirus, President Trump has repeatedly fixated on one thing above all: the numbers. He has aggressively quizzed aides about infection statistics — asking how many cases are in each state, and how the quantity compares with other countries. He has clung to the rosiest projections, repeating only the figures that support his belief that the coronavirus is not morphing into a global catastrophe. And he has intensely followed the plummeting stock market, which plunged more than 1,600 points Wednesday. (Parker, Dawsey and Abutaleb, 3/12)</p>
<p>NBC News: Behind Trump&rsquo;s Coronavirus Shift As President Donald Trump jetted back to Washington on Monday after a weekend of golfing and fundraising in Florida, an intervention was awaiting him at the White House. Administration officials, increasingly concerned about the messaging on and response to the coronavirus, had spent the weekend scrambling to craft a strategy to shift the president&rsquo;s response, which had been focused on downplaying the threat and accusing the media of creating undue concern, according to people involved in the effort. (Pettypiece, 3/12)</p>
<p>The Washington Post: Inside Trump’s Failed 10-Minute Attempt To Control The Coronavirus Crisis In the most scripted of presidential settings, a prime-time televised address to the nation, President Trump decided to ad-lib — and his errors triggered a market meltdown, panicked travelers overseas and crystallized for his critics just how dangerously he has fumbled his management of the coronavirus. Even Trump — a man practically allergic to admitting mistakes — knew he’d screwed up by declaring Wednesday night that his ban on travel from Europe would include cargo and trade, and acknowledged as much to aides in the Oval Office as soon as he’d finished speaking, according to one senior administration official and a second person, both with knowledge of the episode. (Rucker, Parker and Dawsey, 3/12)</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal: Trump’s Coronavirus Travel Ban Deepens Tensions With European Allies President Trump’s announced travel ban on Europe, beyond surprising European capitals, deepens tensions among trans-Atlantic allies whose ties are already strained over trade, security, climate change and what Europeans say is the U.S. failure to consult them. European governments complained that the announcement, made early Thursday Europe time, came without notice and coordination on what is a global health problem. Moreover, the U.S. ban, European Union leaders said, directly affects European citizens, barring many of them from travel to the U.S., and disregards the EU’s “strong action” to contain the new coronavirus. (Norma, 3/12)</p>
<p>The New York Times: Trump’s Travel Ban Leaves Americans In Europe Scrambling To Get Home Across Europe on Thursday, Americans scrambled to make sense of conflicting messages from Washington about if and when they would be allowed to return to the United States. They awoke to the news that President Trump had announced a 30-day suspension of most travel from Europe in a bid to stem the spread of the coronavirus. “To keep new cases from entering our shores, we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days,” Mr. Trump said. The travel restrictions would start at midnight Friday, he added. (Murphy, 3/12)</p>
<p>Boston Globe: ‘This Virus Is Everywhere.’ Experts Deride Europe Travel Ban As Useless Public health experts on Wednesday condemned President Trump’s ban on travel from certain European countries, reacting with bafflement and derision to a measure they said would do nothing to control a pandemic that has already reached US shores. (Freyer, 3/12)</p>
<p>NPR: Trump&rsquo;s European Travel Ban Questioned By Public Health Experts The new restrictions which apply to 26 countries in Europe (but not the United Kingdom) came as a surprise to many E.U. leaders when Trump announced them. They also came as a surprise to many public health experts. &ldquo;From a public health perspective, it&rsquo;s remarkably pointless,&rdquo; says Francois Balloux, an epidemiologist at University College London who worked with the World Health Organization on the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic. Balloux says closing borders only works in the very early days of an outbreak, or for countries that haven&rsquo;t yet detected any cases at all. The U.S., as of Thursday afternoon, had confirmed 1,323 cases. (Beaubien, 3/12)</p>
<p>Politico: &lsquo;I Don&rsquo;t Want People Dying&rsquo;: Trump Defends Travel Ban After Confusing Primetime Address President Donald Trump served up a freewheeling defense of his European travel ban Thursday, as senior administration officials sought to deliver a more controlled line of messaging in the aftermath of his primetime speech on the White House&rsquo;s coronavirus response. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want people dying. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m all about,&rdquo; the president told reporters one day after announcing a 30-day ban on foreign visitors from most of Europe to fight the pandemic. (Forgey, 3/12)</p>
<p>Politico: Trump Officials Did Sound The Coronavirus Alarm. They Just Don’t Work There Anymore. On the January day a new coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, China, Tom Bossert, President Donald Trump’s former homeland security adviser, tweeted a stark warning: “we face a global health threat.” “Coordinate!” he implored. At the time, the coronavirus outbreak was isolated to China — a distant threat to America that did not seem to overly concern President Donald Trump. But Bossert was just one of several former Trump administration officials waving their arms. Other people like Scott Gottlieb, head of the Food and Drug Administration until 2019, and Gary Cohn, who once helmed the National Economic Council, were also on TV and Twitter, arguing the administration must prepare for the situation to get worse. The people who had once been seen as Trump’s guardrails inside the administration were now trying to educate from the outside. (McGraw, 3/12)</p>
<p>Politico: Trump Expected To Sign Order Unleashing Coronavirus Funding Trump on Thursday said he is still mulling what emergency funding steps he will take. He is also pushing for Congress to pass a stimulus package, but lawmakers are bogged down over the details. “We have things that I can do,” Trump said in the Oval Office while sitting alongside Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar. “We have very strong emergency powers under the Stafford Act. … I have it memorized as to the powers in that act. If we need to do something. I have the right to do a lot of things people don&rsquo;t even know about.” (Kumar, 3/12)</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal: Trump Could Sign A Coronavirus Emergency Declaration Soon, Adviser Says White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow made the disclosure in a conference call with GOP lawmakers Thursday morning, the people said. The White House declined to comment, and Mr. Kudlow didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. White House officials have for weeks been discussing an emergency declaration, likely under the 1988 Stafford Act, which would free up billions in Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster funds, administration officials said. The money would help local and state officials respond to the outbreak. (Restuccia, 3/12)</p>
<p>The Hill: Trump Weighing Potential Emergency Declaration For Coronavirus President Trump is weighing whether to declare a national emergency over the coronavirus, which would free up additional resources to combat the rapidly spreading disease. The president indicated to reporters that using an emergency declaration under the Stafford Act was under consideration, but would not say definitively whether he would sign it on Thursday. (Samuels, 3/12)</p>
<p>President Donald Trump has been hesitant to declare an emergency as it might contrast with his optimistic messaging in the early days of the crisis. Meanwhile, the travel ban he announced this week is criticized by public health experts. And, former Trump administration officials have been sounding the alarm even while their former colleagues project a rosy outlook. Media outlets also take a peek inside the White House&rsquo;s slowly shifting views on the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>The New York Times: Travelers From Coronavirus Hot Spots Say They Faced No Screening As thousands of Americans flee from Europe and other centers of the coronavirus outbreak, many travelers are reporting no health screenings upon departure and few impediments at U.S. airports beyond a welcome home greeting. Since January, officers from Customs and Border Protection have been on heightened alert for travelers who could potentially spread the virus. The Department of Homeland Security has told employees to look for visible physical symptoms and search through their travel documents and a federal database that tracks where they came from. Those customs officers will soon have to spot symptoms among a flood of more Americans funneled to designated airports from multiple countries in Europe, an administration official said, after President Trump announced new travel restrictions on the region this week. (Kanno-Youngs, 3/13)</p>
<p>CNN: Lawmakers Fume Amid Lack Of Coronavirus Testing Members were exasperated with what they said was a lack of clarity in the officials&rsquo; answers, as lawmakers struggle to understand how the US has been so far outpaced by other countries grappling with the pandemic. As he left Thursday&rsquo;s briefing, GOP Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina said there is &ldquo;a growing frustration among members as a whole to get more definitive answers&rdquo; from the administration about testing capabilities.He said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &ldquo;struggled to give a really strong answer&rdquo; on why the United States hasn&rsquo;t been able to duplicate testing that is being used in places such as South Korea. (Byrd, Fox, Raju and Barrett, 3/12)</p>
<p>CBS News: &ldquo;It Certainly Is Not Too Late&rdquo;: Fauci Says Wider Coronavirus Testing System Will Be Up And Running Soon Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who is on the coronavirus task force, said at a House meeting on Thursday that the current testing system &ldquo;is not really geared to what we need right now.&rdquo; Hours after calling the testing system a &ldquo;failing,&rdquo; Fauci spoke to &ldquo;CBS Evening News&rdquo; anchor Norah O&rsquo;Donnell in an exclusive interview. (3/12)</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal: U.S. Virus Testing System Is Failing, Fauci Tells Congress The federal government’s top infectious-disease doctor said the nation’s system for disease testing has failed during the coronavirus outbreak because people typically need a doctor’s permission to be tested. “The system is not really geared to what we need right now,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testified Thursday at a congressional hearing. “That is a failing. It is a failing. Let’s admit it.” (Burton, Armour and Wise, 3/12)</p>
<p>ProPublica: The FDA Is Forcing The CDC To Waste Time Double Testing Some Coronavirus Cases A federal directive that’s supposed to speed up the response to a pandemic is actually slowing down the government’s rollout of coronavirus tests. The directive, issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, requires that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a sister agency, retest every positive coronavirus test run by a public health lab to confirm its accuracy. The result, experts say, is wasting limited resources at a time when thousands of Americans are waiting in line to get tested for COVID-19. (DePhillis and Chen, 3/12)</p>
<p>CBS News: Johns Hopkins Develops Its Own Coronavirus Test Doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore have created their own coronavirus test, which they hope will help address the need for more testing for COVID-19. Doctors at Hopkins said the country needs more widely available tests that return results more quickly. That&rsquo;s why they created a test on their own, reports CBS Baltimore. Hopkins began using the test on Wednesday and by Thursday night, they were to have tested 50 samples. (3/13)</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal: FDA Grants New Coronavirus Test Emergency Approval A new, high-speed coronavirus test has been granted emergency clearance by the Food and Drug Administration, the latest effort to expand capacity to diagnose the fast-spreading pathogen. The test was developed by diagnostics giant Roche Holding AG RHHBY -8.96% and is designed to run on the company’s automated machines, which are already installed in more than 100 laboratories across the U.S. It is only the third coronavirus diagnostic to receive emergency-use authorization from the FDA, following a test developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and one from the New York State Department of Health. (Roland and Loftus, 3/13)</p>
<p>Scientists across the country are working around the clock to develop quicker tests for the coronavirus. But many worry that the lack of testing in the early days of the outbreak will come back to haunt the country. Meanwhile, travelers returning from international hot spots say they&rsquo;re still not getting screened when they re-enter the country.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Review-Journal: Horsford Bill Aims To Ease Coronavirus Job Impacts Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., has introduced legislation aimed at providing additional funding for Nevada and other states should unemployment rise because of the COVID-19 outbreak .In a statement released Thursday, Horsford said his bill, H.R. 6199, would immediately provide Nevada with $5 million to help offset a probable increase in unemployment applications, with another $5 million available should the state suffer significant job losses. (Appleton, 3/12)</p>
<p>Reuters: U.S. Excludes Some Chinese Medical Products From Tariffs The U.S. Trade Representative&rsquo;s office said it granted on Thursday exclusions from import tariffs for some medical products imported from China, including face masks, stethoscope covers and blood pressure cuff sleeves. The exclusions were granted as the United States grapples with a coronavirus outbreak that threatens to strain its healthcare system. (3/12)</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal: As Recession Looms, Priority Is Lessening Severity, Easing Financial Stress In the last week the coronavirus shock has sharply raised the probability that the U.S., and the world at large, will suffer a recession. The main challenge for the world now is limiting its severity and preventing a health crisis from becoming a financial crisis. Hard data has yet to show a downturn, but it is out of date. Meanwhile, airlines, theaters and others report widespread cancellations. Just this week equity prices have tumbled, oil prices have plunged, and there are signs of growing stress in financial markets. (Ip, 3/12)</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal: Economists See Rising Risks Of Recession World-Wide The U.S. and world economies look increasingly likely to slip into recession as expanding swaths of commerce shut down and the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its worst day since 1987 amid the coronavirus pandemic. The global financial rout deepened on Thursday despite new measures by major central banks to ease market strains and bolster the economy—and as the Trump administration and Congress neared agreement on legislation to provide federal financial assistance to many affected businesses and workers. (Mitchell and Zumbrun, 3/12)</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal: Behind The Scenes Of U.S. Coronavirus Economic Policy-Making As the coronavirus affects almost every aspect of business, a collection of Trump administration officials—at times at odds with one another—have been seeking to coordinate government action to soften the anticipated blow to the economy. So far, that coordination has been more ad hoc than organized or torn from the classic crisis playbook, which has administration policy makers acting in concert with the Federal Reserve and seeking buy-in from congressional leaders from both parties before announcing a policy response. (Davidson, Restuccia and Timiraos, 3/12)</p>
<p>The Hill: Fed To Spend $1.5T To Pump Liquidity Into Financial Markets Amid Coronavirus Panic The Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced Thursday that it will spend $1.5 trillion to purchase financial assets in a titanic bid to pump cash into the bond market amid panic on Wall Street. The New York Fed said in a Thursday statement it will drastically increase the scale of its repurchase (repo) agreements, during which it buys Treasury bonds and other securities from banks and traders with an agreement to sell the product back with interest the following day or soon after. It will offer $500 billion in repo operations on Thursday followed by $1 trillion in repo agreements Friday “to address highly unusual disruptions in Treasury financing markets associated with the coronavirus outbreak.” (Lane, 3/12)</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal: U.S. Stock Futures Jump After Dow’s Worst Day Since 1987 Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose as much as 4.5% in early morning trading Friday. U.S. stocks plunged Thursday, with the Dow falling 10% as the rapidly spreading coronavirus drove fears of a global slowdown despite action from the Federal Reserve. The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 2.3% at the open Friday. Italy’s financial regulator suspended short selling of 85 Italian companies until the end of the trading day. The U.K.’s regulator also banned the trading activity on the same companies dual-listed on British exchanges. (Hirtenstein and Chiu, 3/13)</p>
<p>The Washington Post: Markets Plunged, Despite The Fed Announcing Flooding The Short-Term Lending Markets With $1.5 Trillion The stock market crashed to its worst day since 1987, shrugging off dramatic intervention by two central banks and a prime-time address by President Trump as Americans realized the coronavirus will impose new limits on their daily lives. The Dow Jones industrial average posted its largest one-day point loss in history, dropping almost 2,353 points to close at 21,200.62. In percentage terms, the 10 percent loss marked the Dow’s worst day since the infamous October day known as “Black Monday.” (Lynch, Heath, Telford and Long, 3/13)</p>
<p>The markets made up some ground early on Friday morning, but the global economy has been thrown into a state of tumult as world leaders struggle to deal with the spreading pandemic. The Federal Reserve Bank on Thursday took drastic measures by pumping $1.5 trillion into the bond market to try to stabilize it.</p>
<p>The Washington Post: Coronavirus Curve Shows Much Of Europe Could Face Italy-Like Surge Within Weeks Some of the world&rsquo;s top experts tracking the spread of the coronavirus predict that in a matter of weeks, much of Europe could be facing a similar surge in cases that has locked down Italy, overwhelmed its hospitals in the north and brought the country of 60 million to a standstill. The mathematical models developed by epidemiologists to track the virus show a sharp trajectory of infections in Spain, Germany, France and Britain. The modelers in Europe say a similar arc is likely in the United States, but anticipating the spread is made more difficult by the lack of widespread testing of suspected cases there. (Morris and Booth, 3/13)</p>
<p>The New York Times: How The World’s Largest Coronavirus Outbreaks Are Growing Milan, Italy. Daegu, South Korea. Qom, Iran. Many of the world’s largest coronavirus outbreaks took root in and around well-traveled cities, but they have since grown to encompass entire countries. Cases have spread across Italy’s north and down to Rome, leading to a lockdown of the entire country. Iran’s capital, where leaders dismissed the virus just two weeks ago, has seen thousands infected. And cases continue to surge across Europe. (Singhvi, McCann, Wu and Migliozzi, 3/12)</p>
<p>PBS NewsHour: The Reason U.S. COVID-19 Numbers Aren’t Higher? Not Enough Tests Compared to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 in China, Japan, and South Korea, the U.S. has so far tested “only a tiny fraction,” said Dr. Lawrence Gostin, global health law professor at Georgetown University who also directs the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on National &amp; Global Health Law. “We are likely to have much more testing capacity in the coming weeks, but it may be too little, too late.” (Santhanam, 3/12)</p>
<p>The New York Times: The Worst-Case Estimate For U.S. Coronavirus Deaths Between 160 million and 214 million people in the U.S. could be infected over the course of the epidemic, according to one projection. That could last months or even over a year, with infections concentrated in shorter periods, staggered across time in different communities, experts said. As many as 200,000 to 1.7 million people could die. And, the calculations based on the C.D.C.’s scenarios suggested, 2.4 million to 21 million people in the U.S. could require hospitalization, potentially crushing the nation’s medical system, which has only about 925,000 staffed hospital beds. Fewer than a tenth of those are for people who are critically ill. (Fink, 3/13)</p>
<p>Those are the worst-case scenarios that experts are forecasting, but even scaled back numbers that account for the protective measures that are being implemented are still grim. Meanwhile, experts say the reason the numbers aren&rsquo;t higher in the U.S. is because of a lack of testing, not because the virus isn&rsquo;t here and circulating.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Review-Journal: Las Vegas Hospitals Place Tents Outside ERs For Health Screenings At least one hospital in the Las Vegas Valley had tents set up outside their emergency room entrances on Thursday morning. Signs alerting patients that health screenings would be done before they enter the ER were in place at Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center and Desert Springs Hospital. Neither hospital had a line.

<p>Cincinnati Enquirer: Coronavirus In Ohio: Hospitals To &lsquo;Surge&rsquo; Patient Load When Necessary As Ohio accelerates its defense against the spread of the novel coronavirus, hospital officials across the state worked Thursday to reassure residents that their facilities can handle a major increase in patients who get sick from the infection. The executives also said doctors, nurses and other caregivers are prepared to manage a surge in patient counts from the highly contagious virus and the upper-respiratory disease it causes, COVID-19. (Saker, 3/13)</p>
<p>The Baltimore Sun: Maryland Hospitals Plan For Surge Of Coronavirus Patients, Worry About Potential ‘Mismatch Between Demand And Resources’ Maryland’s four dozen hospitals are scrambling to prepare for a potential surge of patients sickened by the new coronavirus. Officials are upgrading old flu pandemic plans and inventorying protective gear, medical equipment, staff and beds. They are, however, facing some tough math. (Cohn and Miller, 3/13)</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal: Cuomo Warns New York Hospitals Of Coronavirus Surge New York hospitals may need to halt all elective surgeries and recall former doctors and nurses to handle a surge in novel coronavirus patients, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Thursday. Mr. Cuomo said at a press conference that stopping the surgeries would help avoid overwhelming the health-care system. The move would add 25% to 30% to the system’s capacity he said. New York’s Department of Health would expedite recertification for former doctors and nurses, he said. The state is also considering how the capacity of healthcare systems in upstate New York could relieve those downstate. (West, 3/12)</p>
<p>The Washington Post: Coronavirus Shows Why We Need Better Public Health Funding, Experts Say To illustrate the gulf between the nation’s costly health care and its underfunded public health, Alfred Sommer, former dean of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, often tells a story: When people wake up after triple bypass surgery at the famous hospital across the street in Baltimore, they typically thank their doctors for the lifesaving miracles they performed — and sometimes even make donations to the institution. “Nobody wakes up in the morning and says, ‘Thank God I don’t have smallpox.’ Or, ‘Thank God my water is potable,’ ” Sommer said. (Sellers, 3/12)</p>
<p>Modern Healthcare: Hospitals Balance Disclosure And Privacy As COVID-19 Spreads Hospital responses to the pandemic have varied. While some are actively communicating and being transparent, others are declining to publicly disclose if one of their patients has COVID-19 to minimize liability. Hospitals weigh these decisions as they toe a fine line between disclosing accurate information, complying with privacy laws and not inciting fear. (Kacik, 3/12)</p>
<p>Kaiser Health News: Coronavirus Pushes Hospitals To Share Information About Stocks Of Protective Gear Masks, gloves and other equipment are crucial as health care workers face the COVID-19 outbreak. There is a strategic national stockpile that the U.S. government controls — but no one knows what, beyond that stockpile, is available in the private sector. Some hospitals have a surplus of the protective equipment and some not enough. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working on a system that would track the inventory across the U.S. (Farmer, 3/13)</p>
<p>CIDRAP: ECDC: COVID-19 Not Containable, Set To Overwhelm Hospitals In a stark and urgent COVID-19 risk assessment update today, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said that, in a few weeks or even days, other countries in the region may face huge surges that mirror those of China and Italy. It advised countries to quickly shift to mitigation strategies to protect vulnerable people and prevent overwhelmed hospitals. (Schnirring, 3/12)</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal: Virus Outbreak Pushes Italy’s Health-Care System To The Brink When her hospital in the northern Italian city of Cremona had its first case of coronavirus three weeks ago, Francesca Mangiatordi was on a night shift. Since then, as dozens of new cases poured in, the emergency-room doctor has been faced with heart-rending choices, such as how to allocate scarce oxygen supplies among critically ill patients. “These are the choices I would have never wanted to make,” she said. “It’s somewhat like being in war.” (Lombardi and Petroni, 3/12)</p>
<p>The New York Times: Italy’s Health Care System Groans Under Coronavirus — A Warning To The World The mayor of one town complained that doctors were forced to decide not to treat the very old, leaving them to die. In another town, patients with coronavirus-caused pneumonia were being sent home. Elsewhere, a nurse collapsed with her mask on, her photograph becoming a symbol of overwhelmed medical staff. In less than three weeks, the coronavirus has overloaded the heath care system all over northern Italy. It has turned the hard hit Lombardy region into a grim glimpse of what awaits countries if they cannot slow the spread of the virus and ‘‘flatten the curve’’ of new cases — allowing the sick to be treated without swamping the capacity of hospitals.

<p>The Washington Post: Are Hospitals Ready For Coronavirus Patients? A Health Official Ducks Question 4 Times In Fox News Interview. The question was important, straightforward and crucial to the country’s preparedness for dealing with the coronavirus crisis: Are America’s hospitals equipped to treat a possible influx of patients afflicted with covid-19? Do they have enough intensive care units and enough ventilators? And the official being questioned by Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum on Thursday night was in a position to know. After all, Seema Verma is the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which, as its website says, “oversees one of the largest federal agencies that administers vital health care programs to over 100 million Americans.” She is also on the White House coronavirus task force. As hard as she tried, however, MacCallum could not get a straight answer. (Barbash, 3/13)</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal: U.S. Hospitals Face Major Challenges As Coronavirus Spreads William Olson, the chief of operations for eight Oregon hospitals, grew worried when he was shown a heat map of coronavirus cases and flulike symptoms among patients across seven Western states. The maps captured trends for patients of Providence, which owns 51 hospitals and shared the results early Monday with its hospital executives. Seattle’s outbreak, depicted in blue dots, was already ballooning. And now Portland had its own blue specks. If the pattern held, his hospitals were about to be severely tested. “That was the alarm bells going off,” he said. Mr. Olson said Renton, Wash.-based Providence has sent its real-estate team to hunt for empty lots suitable for medical tents, an exercise under way in all its markets. Also on the Catholic health system’s list of possible extra space for patients: a former dormitory for nuns. (Evans and Wilde Mathews, 3/12)</p>
<p>The New York Times: U.S. Hospitals Prepare For Coronavirus, With The Worst Still To Come One Seattle-area hospital has already seen patient care delayed by the stringent infection-control practices that the government recommended for suspected coronavirus cases. Another in Chicago switched Thursday morning into “surge” mode, setting up triage tents in its ambulance bay and dedicating an entire floor to coronavirus patients. At least one is already receiving emergency supplies from the federal government’s stockpile. With the bow wave of coronavirus infections still to come, hospitals across the country are trying to prepare for a flood of critically ill patients who will strain their capacities like nothing they have seen in at least a generation. Even with some time to prepare, administrators fear they will not be ready. (Kliff, 3/12)</p>
<p>One of the top concerns for public health experts is how virus cases are likely to overwhelm hospitals, like is happening in Italy. Patients there are dying while waiting for treatment and doctors are forced to choose who to treat and who to let die. European health officials say Italy&rsquo;s experience with its faltering health system is just a preview of things to come for other countries.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal: As Virus Spreads, Drugmakers Are On The Case Dozens of drugmakers are scrambling to develop vaccines that could prevent people from contracting the new coronavirus, or therapies to treat people infected with the respiratory disease it causes. Testing of several potential drugs and vaccines has already started, and more trials are in the works. Additional studies could follow if researchers find that products approved for other uses, or even ones they discarded, show promise in their labs tackling the virus. “You’re seeing the industry wheel into action,” says Jeremy Levin, chairman of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization trade group and chief executive of Ovid Therapeutics Inc.

<p>Los Angeles Times: Why Will It Take So Long To Make A Coronavirus Vaccine That Can Prevent COVID-19? Nothing can stop a global outbreak in its tracks better than a vaccine. Unfortunately, creating a vaccine capable of preventing the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 will probably take at least a year to 18 months, health officials say. “That is the time frame,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the House Oversight and Reform Committee this week. Anyone who says they can do it faster “will be cutting corners that would be detrimental.” (Khan, 3/12)</p>
<p>CNBC: Human Trials For A Coronavirus Vaccine Could Begin &lsquo;Within A Few Weeks&rsquo; Human trials for a potential vaccine to prevent COVID-19 could begin “within a few weeks” with a vaccine ready for public use within the next 12 to 18 months, a top U.S. health official said Thursday. “We said &hellip; that it would take two to three months to have it in the first human,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the House Oversight and Reform Committee on Thursday at a hearing on the nation’s preparedness for the outbreak.

<p>A vaccine for broad public use is still 12 to 18 months away.

<p>The Wall Street Journal: When Big Events Get Canceled Due To The Coronavirus, Who’s On The Hook? Event cancellations are multiplying because of the coronavirus. For the most part it is event organizers and local communities, not insurers, who will foot the bill. The limited involvement of the insurance industry sets the fallout from coronavirus cancellations apart from natural disasters like earthquakes and hurricanes that tend to result in substantial insurance payouts.

<p>ABC News: Two-Thirds Of Americans Concerned About Contracting Coronavirus, As Country Grapples With Growing Crisis: POLL Two-thirds of Americans are concerned that they or someone they know will be infected with the novel coronavirus, but in a country with a growing partisan divide, political tribalism is having a large impact when it comes to anxiety over the disease, according to a new ABC News/Ipsos poll released Friday. Although unease over the coronavirus is high, it also strongly breaks along partisan lines. Among Democrats, 83% are concerned about getting coronavirus, including 47% who are very concerned, and among Republicans, 56% are concerned, including only 15% who are very concerned. Only 17% of Democrats are not concerned while a larger 44% of Republicans are not concerned. (Karson, 3/13)</p>

<p>The New York Times: Twenty-Four Hours When Sports Hit The Halt Button One by one, beginning Wednesday night and all through Thursday, the pillars of the American athletic landscape toppled, unceremoniously, to the ground, marking one of the most astonishing nights and days in United States sports history. Professional basketball disappeared first, then the college game followed; hockey melted away; baseball went on indefinite hiatus; and soccer took leave, as well. Before Thursday, Americans could have held some hope that the country’s traditional sports leagues would, in the coming weeks, supply moments of needed respite and emotional escape from the weighty concerns of the coronavirus pandemic.

While many of these actions may have serious consequences for the economy and the collective psyche of Americans, public officials have not hesitated to take bold steps that only a few days ago seemed unimaginable.

<p>The Hill: Why Canceling Events Makes Sense In The Age Of COVID-19 Governments, businesses and sports leagues are taking drastic steps to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus that has infected more than 1,300 people across the United States. The measures, virtually unprecedented in the century since the Spanish flu that killed more than 50 million people around the globe, are aimed at reducing the transmission of the potentially life-threatening virus between those already infected and those who are at risk. Public health experts say the steps are necessary, even critical, to stop the spread of the virus. (Wilson, 3/12)</p>
<p>CIDRAP: From Broadway To Baseball, US Events Canceled Over COVID-19 All these efforts are attempts at forcing social distancing, which has been touted by public health experts as one of the best ways to flatten the epidemiological curve of the virus, or distribute the number of infections over a long period of time so as not to strain the nation&rsquo;s healthcare system. On Twitter, scientists, researchers, and journalists used the hashtag #flattenthecurve to encourage social distancing measures, such as working from home and canceling major events.

These measures, considered &ldquo;social distancing,&rdquo; may be key in containing the spread of the coronavirus. &ldquo;Social distancing is a public health intervention in which people are discouraged from convening in groups and encouraged to keep physical distance from others in order to slow the spread of illness,&rdquo; said Dr. Neha Chaudhary, child, adolescent, and adult psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School and co-founder of Brainstorm, Stanford’s lab for mental health innovation.

<p>The New York Times: Efforts To Control Coronavirus Could Get Even More Extreme First came handwashing instructions and social distancing. Then came the prohibitions on large events and the shuttering of schools. Next up, should the coronavirus outbreak grow even more dire, are government measures that could have an even greater impact on daily life. Washington State — where 31 people have died from the virus, the most in the United States — has escalated through most of a 13-step strategy checklist for controlling infectious outbreaks and now has only a few remaining options: closing workplaces, restricting people to their homes and cordoning off targeted areas to help control the spread of infection.

<p>Politico: America Shuts Down Financial markets are careening. Public tours of the very symbols of American political power — the White House, Capitol Hill and Supreme Court — are being put on hold while some congressional offices are shuttering altogether. Campaign rallies are being canceled. Professional sports leagues have suspended play. And Broadway and Disneyland are shutting down. Each day, more and more employees are working remotely at companies large and small. Even the White House is considering mass teleworking. Schools are being closed or going virtual. Ohio students are getting a three-week spring break beginning Monday, while schools will be closed for two weeks across Maryland and six weeks in three Washington state counties. And travel is being discouraged — and in the case of foreign visitors from most of Europe, banned. Some cruise lines are even halting voyages on their ships. (McCaskill, 3/12)</p>
