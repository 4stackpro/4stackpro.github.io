The Big Night In appeal: what time the BBC Comic Relief and Children in Need fundraising event starts tonight</p>
<p>The Big Night In will see Children in Need and Comic Relief coming together for the first time to host a special night of television</p>
<p>By Alex Nelson Thursday, 23rd April 2020, 6:14 pm Updated Thursday, 23rd April 2020, 6:18 pm</p>
<p>(Image: BBC)</p>
<p>A quiet night in isn&rsquo;t an option at the moment, it&rsquo;s a necessity.</p>
<p>But while the idea of spending weeks lazing on the couch watching TV may have seemed exciting at first, staring at the same four walls evening after evening can start to drag.</p>
<p>Thankfully the BBC is swooping in to save the day with their first Big Night In, an evening of entertainment designed to celebrate the acts of kindness, humour and the spirit of hope and resilience that is keeping the nation going during the unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s everything you need to know about the special night of programming for BBC One.</p>
<p>What is The Big Night In?</p>
<p>The Big Night In will see Children in Need and Comic Relief coming together for the first time to host a special night of television. It is being broadcast on BBC One on Thursday 23 April between 7 and 10pm.</p>
<p>The aim of the show is to offer &ldquo;some light relief and entertainment&rdquo; during these most unprecedented of times, while also celebrating those going the extra mile to support their communities.</p>
<p>The show will see appearances from some of the country’s favourite famous faces, and the BBC say it will also include &ldquo;big surprises, ‘money can’t buy’ prizes, live music performances (from the artists’ homes) and many of your favourite faces coming together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite promises of a packed roster of celebs and musical performances, the live broadcast will respect &ldquo;all current social isolating government protocols,&rdquo; which means guests will be appearing via webcam from their own homes.</p>
<p>Suzy Lamb, Managing Director Entertainment &amp; Music BBC Studios, called the Big Night In &ldquo;an incredible night of TV filled with entertainment and emotion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simon Antrobus, Chief Executive of BBC Children in Need, said: &ldquo;The Big Night In will offer the chance for everyone to (virtually) get together to celebrate the kindness and heroism of those making a real difference in their communities, and to support people across the UK who need our help now more than ever.”</p>
<p>Who will be on it?</p>
<p>Arguably the biggest name set to make an appearance for Big Night In is Peter Kay, who&rsquo;ll be making something of a comeback; it will be Kay’s first public appearance since 2017.</p>
<p>Lenny Henry, Matt Baker, Zoe Ball and Paddy McGuinness will all co-host together - at a distance of two metres or more.</p>
<p>Catherine Tate will also be on hand, Gary Barlow will be performing, and the Strictly cast will be dishing out tips on dancing around the house under lockdown.</p>
<p>How can I help?</p>
<p>The show will give viewers at home an opportunity to donate, and those able to do so will be able to support vulnerable people of all ages and backgrounds across the UK.</p>
<p>Funds raised on the night will be split between Children in Need and Comic Relief to provide essential support to local charities, projects and programmes across the country to help those most in need.</p>
<p>This funding will not only provide vital emergency support to ensure vulnerable people of all ages are safe, warm and fed, but will also ensure that they are able to continue to learn, and stay connected in order to combat isolation and loneliness.</p>
<p>Charlotte Moore, Director BBC Content, thanked both Children in Need and Comic Relief for &ldquo;joining forces in these unprecedented times to provide their support to local charities, projects and programmes across the whole UK.&rdquo;</p>
<p>UK Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, says: “The Big Night In is a fantastic way to channel the amazing outpouring of generosity we are seeing from the British people.

<p><img src="https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/peter-kay-comp-e1587712665499.jpg?strip=all&amp;quality=100&amp;w=1200&amp;h=800&amp;crop=1" alt="img">
PETER Kay put smiles on the faces of Big Night In viewers as he presented an updated version of (Is This The Way To) Amarillo from his back garden in sunny Bolton tonight.</p>
<p>The Bolton funnyman, 46, returned to TV for the first time in two years to present his famous 2005 Comic Relief sketch where he and a cast of stars — this time including NHS nurses — march and mime to crooner Tony Christie’s vocals.</p>

<p>5 Peter Kay appears on The Big Night In from his back garden in sunny Bolton</p>
<p>Viewers were delighted as he appeared in a Hawaiian shirt eating a Solero in his back garden before he presented the performance.</p>
<p>And it was all for a good cause as the telethon is raising money in aid of local charities and projects in the UK supported by Comic Relief and Children in Need - as well as raising the nation’s spirit in this difficult time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just like that @peterkay_co_uk saves #TheBigNightIn you legend!&rdquo; one fan tweeted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter Kay makes my miserable heart very happy,&rdquo; another added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How amazing to see #PeterKay Literally made these last 4 weeks so much better. The nation loves you,&rdquo; a third viewer wrote.</p>
<p>5 Peter Kay&rsquo;s famous sketch was included in The Big Night In event</p>
<p>5 Key Workers were encouraged to take part in the sing-along with Peter Kay</p>
<p>5 Members of the public sent in their own videos recreating Peter Kay&rsquo;s (Is This The Way To) Amarillo</p>
<p>Last month Peter was forced to postpone his much-anticipated Dance For Life comeback due to the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>The comedian announced the news on his website and promised the shows will go ahead at a later date.</p>
<p>He wrote: “Obviously this is disappointing news but well and truly justified given the circumstances.</p>
<p>“We’ll get through this, together and then we’ll all have a great big dance for life.</p>
<p>“Stay safe and look after yourselves and the people around you.”</p>
<p>It was a further blow to fans who were left devastated when Peter pulled out of his UK tour three years ago for “family reasons”.</p>

<p>It is 15 years since the song went from being a retro request at Spanish holiday bars to the most played song in the UK, all thanks to Peter Kay.</p>
<p>Speaking exclusively to The Sun, 49 years after the song was originally released, Tony said: “To have a No1 at the age of 77 would be incredible.</p>
<p>“I just can’t believe it. The song will now cross over three generations — 1971, 2005 and now 2020.</p>

<p>“Every DJ I speak to says Amarillo is the one song they guarantee will fill a dance floor, and I see why.</p>
<p>“What’s not to like about it?</p>
<p>“It’s the gift that keeps on giving — I wish I had one like that every five years.”</p>
<p>Tony only found out about the new skit last weekend, after receiving a call from Comic Relief host Sir Lenny Henry.</p>

<h3 id="age-uk-crisis-and-mind-among-charities-to-receive-big-night-in-funds">Age UK, Crisis and Mind among charities to receive Big Night In funds</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.civilsociety.co.uk/uploads/assets/ade63c22-f8a8-42a0-87db70c98998d215/BBC-big-night-in-440-USE.jpg" alt="img">
Age UK, Crisis and Mind are among those that will receive funds from tonight&rsquo;s Big Night In appeal, Comic Relief has announced.</p>
<p>Comic Relief said this will be part of a “networked emergency response” to distribute funds to charities across the country.</p>
<p>The Big Night In is a live entertainment night that will be broadcast tonight on BBC One. The telethon will raise funds for both BBC’s partner charities Comic Relief and Children In Need. The two funders will then be distribute money to charities on the frontline.</p>
<p>The government has announced it will match all the money raised from the appeal. While it is not unusual for it to support Comic Relief’s telethons through a match funding programme, it is the first time this is not capped.</p>
<p>Partner charities</p>
<p>BBC Children In Need and Comic Relief will be splitting the appeal’s funds equally. Funding will focus on three areas: “food and other basic essentials”, “connecting people with vital services and tackling isolation” and “supporting local charities and projects to adapt and innovate to address hidden risks”.</p>
<p>In addition, Comic Relief has published a statement on its approach to grantmaking on this occasion: “We are committed to making sure money reaches the communities and projects at the heart of the Covid-19 response as quickly and effectively as possible.</p>
<p>“We also know in this situation it is important to provide support in the medium and long term. We will achieve this through a phased funding approach; working with partners to provide a networked emergency response across the country, as well as offering support to new charities responding to the medium and longer-term impact of the crisis through an open funding call this summer.</p>
<p>“As well as working with existing funded partners as they develop their Covid-19 response, we are working with some larger national partners who have thematic expertise and national reach and are working collaboratively to distribute funding to local community and grassroots groups across the UK at the forefront of this crisis.”</p>
<p>Comic Relief’s partners for the Big Night In as listed on its website are: NHS Charities Together, Rosa Women’s Fund, Buttle UK, Refugee Action and Migration Exchange, Women’s Aid, Age UK, British Red Cross, Crisis, Mind, FareShare, Homeless Link.</p>
<p>Comic Relief said it will also be working with cross-thematic organisations Groundwork UK, Corra Foundation, Wales Council for Voluntary Action and Community Foundation for Northern Ireland to distribute the funds.</p>
<p>‘We need everybody’s support’</p>
<p>Laurie Boult, fundraising director at Age UK, said: “We are thrilled to be part of this huge event and have no doubt the country will come together and show their generous support on the night.</p>
<p>“To be part of Comic Relief is a real honour, we are all facing a devastating threat right now and it is older people who are among the most at risk. Too many older vulnerable people are now completely alone and we desperately need everybody’s support so we can be there for those who urgently need us.</p>
<p>“We are so grateful for the donations and support we have received so far – our appeal is helping us to continue to run our essential services. But there’s a lot more for us to do and The Big Night In will really help us to keep on providing comfort, hope and practical support.”</p>
<p>Crisis wrote on Twitter: “We&rsquo;re thrilled to be one of the charities chosen to benefit from tonight&rsquo;s event, which supports charities across the UK working to provide vital emergency support during the coronavirus crisis.”</p>
<p>Big Night In celebrities and initiatives</p>
<p>Tonight’s Big Night in will see a range of celebrities and artists taking part, including ten different actors that have starred as Doctor Who in the past 50 years appearing together and Matt Lucas and David Walliams doing Little Britain on TV for the first time in a decade.</p>
<p>Twenty-three artists including Chris Martin of Coldplay, Ellie Goulding, Rag’n’Bone Man and Sean Paul have released a cover of Foo Fighters’ Times Like These hit to raise money for the appeal. The video of the artists performing the song from home will be shown tonight during the telethon.</p>
<p>Part of the appeal will also be a fundraising quiz night tomorrow. The Big Quiz will be broadcast at 6.30pm and hosted by Judge Rinder.</p>
