<h3 id="each-country-has-different-circumstances-amid-the-covid-19-pandemic-but-all-fighting-the-same-enemy-pm-lee">Each country has different circumstances amid the Covid-19 pandemic, but all fighting the same enemy: PM Lee</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/articles/2020/04/08/nmsgmasksbus0804.jpg?itok=hug-1_HY" alt="img">
SINGAPORE - While each country is facing a different set of circumstances amid the Covid-19 pandemic, they are all fighting a common enemy and should cooperate closely with one another, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Wednesday (April 8).</p>
<p>He said this in a video message for the World Health Organisation (WHO) Western Pacific regional office&rsquo;s second virtual meeting of health ministers in the region, themed &ldquo;Stand in Solidarity to Combat Covid-19&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In his video message posted on Facebook, PM Lee said he was invited to share Singapore&rsquo;s efforts in fighting Covid-19.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Singapore has taken Covid-19 very seriously since the start. We have done our best to detect cases and isolate them, and to trace their contacts and quarantine them to stop further transmission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have encouraged people to keep safe distances apart, wash their hands and now, to wear masks when going out,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>However, PM Lee said it has been a very difficult fight, and the number of cases has continued to rise despite the country&rsquo;s efforts. Hence, substantially tighter safe distancing measures were introduced in the form of a &ldquo;circuit breaker&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Day 1 of these enhanced measures started on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have closed all non-essential workplaces and required telecommuting wherever possible. We have also closed schools and childcare centres. We have told everyone to stay home,&rdquo; said PM Lee.</p>
<p>These measures are painful but essential, he stressed, adding that the next few weeks will be crucial for the country to bring the outbreak under control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many other countries have done the same. Each country has different circumstances, social norms and resources, but we are all fighting the same enemy - Covid-19,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must cooperate closely with one another, and learn from one another&rsquo;s experiences. This is the only way humanity can bring this pandemic under control.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The battle is far from won. But it can be won, if we fight together. Singapore will do our part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PM Lee added that Singapore greatly appreciates the leadership and expertise of the WHO, under director-general Tedros Ghebreyesus and Western Pacific regional director Takeshi Kasai.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We depend on the WHO to mobilise and coordinate an effective global response, including by convening today&rsquo;s meeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish everyone strength and wisdom, as we deliberate and forge a way forward to good health and a new normal,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Senior Minister of State for Health Lam Pin Min, who represented Singapore in the virtual meeting, said in a Facebook post that the meeting was a platform to share Singapore&rsquo;s perspective and also learn from other member countries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being an urban city, Singapore is especially vulnerable to infectious disease threats. We learnt from our experiences during the Sars and H1N1 outbreaks, and invested resources in pandemic preparedness over the years,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Dr Lam added that the Covid-19 pandemic is yet another painful reminder that it is never too early to invest in robust pandemic preparedness and response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As member states continue to fight the battle within their countries and in their own unique way, we must also cooperate with one another, in order to accelerate the path towards winning the battle together.&rdquo;

<h3 id="coronavirus-new-30m-grant-launched-to-speed-up-local-production-of-eggs-vegetables-and-fish">Coronavirus: New $30m grant launched to speed up local production of eggs, vegetables and fish</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/articles/2020/04/08/ycfood080420.jpg?itok=BQNU3ugC" alt="img">
SINGAPORE - A $30 million grant has been launched to help local farms ramp up their production of eggs, leafy vegetables and fish over the next six to 24 months.</p>
<p>The 30x30 Express grant will help accelerate local food production in the shortest time possible, said the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources in a joint statement on Wednesday (April 8).</p>
<p>The 30 by 30 goal - to produce enough food here to meet 30 per cent of the country&rsquo;s nutritional needs by 2030 - is part of the Republic&rsquo;s strategies towards achieving long-term food security. Currently, less than 10 per cent of food is grown locally.</p>
<p>The open grant call, which will be launched in the middle of this month, will call on local agri-food players producing the three food types to submit their proposals to grow more, and faster.</p>
<p>The grant will let successful applicants defray upfront costs to increase production capacity within the next six to 24 months, including the co-funding of technology systems that will raise productivity on the farms.</p>
<p>Fish, leafy vegetables and eggs are the three most commonly consumed food items in Singapore. In 2019, local farms produced 14 per cent of leafy vegetables, 26 per cent of eggs and 10 per cent of fish consumed here.</p>
<p>During the supplementary budget debate on Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said that Covid-19 has underscored the importance of further strengthening Singapore&rsquo;s supply chain resilience and food security, adding that several Members of Parliament have urged the Government to further develop local food production capabilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my ministerial statement on the Resilience Budget, I spoke about our efforts to deal with the immediate challenges, by having a robust, multi-pronged strategy to ensure a stable supply of safe food and essential items. We have been working on this for years, and will continue to do so, &quot; Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister, said.</p>
<p>Co-founder of Comcrop Allan Lim said that the grant will help accelerate plans to scale up production.</p>
<p>The company, which set up the first commercial urban rooftop farm here in 2014, is now test-bedding the growth of leafy Asian greens such as xiao bai cai and cai xin in the 6,000 sq ft greenhouse atop an industrial building in Woodlands. It produces 50kg of leafy greens every day to supply to supermarkets here.</p>
<p>The firm hopes to build seven more such greenhouses on the rooftop farm – which is about 80,000 sq ft – within the next six to eight months and expand production capacity by up to 10 times, said Mr Lim.</p>
<p>He added that the farm has spent years acquiring and test-bedding advanced farming systems, and figuring out what works.</p>
<p>“It’s time to put into use what we already know. We are all ready to scale up.”</p>
<p>Related Story Over 100 local farms benefit from fund to help them modernise, innovate and increase yield</p>
<p>Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli said: &ldquo;It is important that these efforts are augmented by the support of consumers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Demand from consumers will spur our farmers to become more productive, and allow them to reap the benefits of economies of scale. This, in turn, will bolster our food security, and create good jobs for our people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new grant will serve to complement SFA&rsquo;s existing Agriculture Productivity Fund, which aims to help farms here boost productivity by incorporating sustainable technologies into their farming systems.</p>
<p>To further bolster food production, the agencies will also work to identify industrial spaces and vacant sites that can double as alternative farming spaces.</p>
<p>From next month, the SFA will launch a tender for rooftop spaces on HDB multi-storey carparks to be used for urban farming.</p>
<p>In addition, a multi-agency task force, headed by Mr Masagos, has also been formed to drive inter-agency efforts. The taskf orce will address challenges in the setting up and expansion of farms and ensure that the farms are highly productive, sustainable and resilient, said the agencies.
