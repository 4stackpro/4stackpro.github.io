It&rsquo;s alleged Jack Grealish crashed his Jeep into several cars, left details with a resident and then walked from the scene. Pic: Twitter</p>
<p>Aston Villa captain Jack Grealish has found himself at the centre of a bizarre incident after reportedly smashing his 80,000 pound ($A161,000) car into a number of parked vehicles.</p>
<p>An investigation has been launched after photos appeared to show Grealish at the scene of an incident in which a Range Rover - said to belong to him - crashed into two parked cars.</p>

<p>‘KIDS OR THE DRUGS’: Former agent&rsquo;s disturbing Ben Cousins claims</p>
<p>West Midlands Police said they were called on Sunday morning to the Dickens Heath area of Solihull, where two parked cars suffered minor damage.</p>
<p>The force said the driver left his details with a member of the public before leaving the scene on foot.</p>
<p>Images surfaced online on Sunday of a damaged white Range Rover as well as a photo that appeared to show the Villa midfielder in shorts, a blue hoodie, a slipper on one foot and a slide on his other.</p>
<p>Less than 24 hours before the incident, the 24-year-old launched a video appeal for people to stay at home during the government-enforced lockdown.</p>
<p>In the video, he said: &ldquo;To help save lives you must stay at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only leave your house to buy food, buy medicine or to exercise and always remember to stay at least two metres apart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is urgent, protect the NHS, stay home, save lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a statement about the incident, the West Midlands force said: &ldquo;We were called to Waterside, Dickens Heath, just before 10am to reports that a Range Rover had crashed into two parked cars in the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The driver left his details with a member of the public at the scene before leaving on foot, and will be spoken to by police in due course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Minor damage was caused to the parked vehicles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Officers are investigating the circumstances and anyone with information has been asked to get in touch, via Live Chat at west-midlands.police.uk quoting log 643 of 29 March.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Villa were unavailable for comment on Sunday.</p>
<p>Cristiano Ronaldo criticised over quarantine response</p>
<p>Grealish isn&rsquo;t the only football star to court controversy while supposedly in quarantine, with Cristiano Ronaldo also under fire.</p>
<p>The Juventus star was criticised by the club&rsquo;s former president Giovanni Cobolli Gigli over his actions in the coronavirus pandemic, with the five-time Ballon d’Or winner considered to have ‘complicated’ matters.</p>
<p>The Portuguese star was allowed to head back to his native Madeira before public life in Italy shut down, with the Juve squad placed in quarantine once it was revealed that Daniele Rugani had tested positive for Covid-19.</p>
<p>Ronaldo had been freed by then to return to his homeland after seeing his mother suffer a stroke - Maria Dolores has since been released from hospital - and is continuing her recovery in a private medical facility, with her son allowed to turn his attention elsewhere.</p>

<p>But Gigli claims the 35-year-old is now more concerned with “taking pictures by the pool” and has set an unfortunate precedent that is making it difficult for other sports stars to be contained.</p>
<p>The likes of Gonzalo Huguain, Miralem Pjanic and Douglas Costa have been released from the Juve camp to join their respective families around the world.</p>
<p>“Things at Juventus got complicated when Cristiano Ronaldo left,” Gigli told Radio Punto Nuovo.</p>
<p>“He said he was going to Portugal because of his mother, but now he only appears to be taking pictures by the pool.</p>
<p>“When the exception was made for him, things fell apart and others wanted to leave but it shouldn&rsquo;t have been like this.</p>
<p>“They all should have been quarantined.”</p>
<p>Juventus in difficult spot due to virus</p>
<p>Gigli admits that Juventus have been forced into a corner when it comes to letting senior stars flee Italy.</p>

<h3 id="what-might-have-been-for-aston-villa-skipper-jack-grealish-today">What might have been for Aston Villa skipper Jack Grealish today&hellip;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.expressandstar.com/resizer/Ilx4_MhtYFFJ2pacyS8A3_C5ANY=/1200x0/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-expressandstar-mna.s3.amazonaws.com/public/A4OKR5HO7NCSTDJJUANRQGOC54.jpg" alt="img">
Today would have been a significant one for the England football team, with a home friendly against Italy at Wembley – the first of several staging posts in the final build-up to Euro 2020.</p>
<p>It might have been an even bigger day for Jack Grealish, the Villa playmaker whose form over the course of recent months had surely done enough to earn a first senior call-up and might even have been enough to force his way into Gareth Southgate’s starting XI.</p>
<p>Of course, it doesn’t matter a jot now. The European Championships have quite rightly been pushed back 12 months and there is no guessing when England might actually play again.</p>
<p>As Southgate said in a typically perfectly-toned message to supporters last week, we really shouldn’t waste another moment thinking about the postponement. “Now is not the time for us to take centre stage,” he wrote. “The heroes will be the men and women who continue to work tirelessly in our hospitals and medical centres to look after our friends and families.</p>
<p>“They won’t receive the individual acclaim, but we all know their importance is beyond anything we do on the pitch.”</p>
<p>You can be certain the sentiment is shared by Grealish, who for all the heights he is capable of reaching on the pitch remains firmly grounded off it. His focus right now will be the same as everyone else, on the health and well-being of friends and family. It doesn’t mean we shouldn’t feel an element of regret on his behalf, or for the thousands of other athletes around the world who have dedicated so much time and effort for competitions which have now been swept aside by global events.</p>
<p>Neither does it stop us from pondering the future and hoping for the sense of normality the return of sport will eventually bring, no matter how long it takes.</p>
<p>“The weirdest feeling I have is that I have found I really don’t have a life without football,” said Villa winger Anwar El Ghazi in a candid interview with the Dutch media last weekend.</p>
<p>El Ghazi will certainly not be the only one involved in the sport to have experienced that epiphany in recent days, no matter whether they are a player, coach, executive, or even journalist. On that score, things are only going to get tougher. This is no short-term shutdown.</p>
<p>The good news is at some point, some time sport will be back. And when it is, like many of the far more important things too often taken for granted, it will be celebrated and cherished more than ever.
