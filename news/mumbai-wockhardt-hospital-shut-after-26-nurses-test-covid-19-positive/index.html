<p>Updated: Apr 06, 2020 15:24 IST</p>
<p>The Wockhardt Hospital in Mumbai’s Agripada was sealed on Monday after 26 nurses and three doctors tested positive for coronavirus. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had declared the hospital as a containment zone on Sunday.</p>
<p>Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health), BMC, said they have sealed the hospital and the staffers are not allowed to go out until they test negative for a coronavirus test.</p>
<p>“It is the fault of the hospital administration that they didn’t take precautionary measures, due to which nearly 300 staffers have been quarantined. We have also set up a team to probe how the virus spread among so many people in a hospital setting,” he said.</p>
<p>As HT had reported earlier, the Covid-19 positive nurses alleged that due to the negligence of the hospital, the infection spread to other staffers. On March 20 two suspected and positive Covid-19 patients were brought to the hospital from Kasturba Gandhi Hospital. The confirmed cases were kept in isolation wards, while suspects were kept in general ICU wards where non-Covid-19 patients were also being provided care.</p>

<p>On March 28, two nurses working in the same general ICU ward tested positive for Covid-19. But soon, 10 nurses got infected and later the infection spread to 26 nurses and three doctors.</p>
<p>“We have contracted the infection after we were exposed to suspected coronavirus patients who were undergoing treatment in a general ward at the hospital,” said a nurse from the hospital who has been found positive. The relatives of the patients also claimed that the infected nurses shared the same canteen, hostels and bathrooms with uninfected medical staffers.</p>
<p>Staff members said that the hospital did not quarantine the nurses and forced them to work resulting in the spread of the virus to other staff members.</p>
<p>While recounting the alleged harassment, a nurse said when the BMC came for inspection on April 1, few of the nurses informed them about their symptoms but they were reprimanded by the senior officers from the hospital.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the nurses who tested positive have been shifted to the hospital from their quarters in Vile Parle, while two of the infected doctors are admitted to Seven Hills and the third one to SL Raheja Hospital, Mahim. The swab samples of more than 270 hospital staff and some patients have been sent for tests.</p>
<p>The nursing association has filed a complaint with the BMC commissioner seeking action against the hospital.</p>
<p>Mumbai and other cities in Maharashtra like Pune and Nagpur have recorded a substantial rise in the number of Covid-19 patients in last few days—of these nearly 85% are in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Pune district, the most urbanised areas of the state.</p>
<p>The state government has said it will focus on these areas to contain the spread of the virus. The municipal corporations in these cities have been directed to implement the cluster containment action plan minutely to restrict the spread of the coronavirus disease.

Coronavirus Mumbai Cases: Entry and exit to Wockhardt Hospital has been temporarily banned.</p>
<p>Highlights Wockhardt Hospital shut, declared containment zone</p>
<p>Probe ordered to examine record rise in number of cases</p>
<p>More than 270 patients, nurses being tested</p>
<p>A hospital in Mumbai - one of the COVID-19 hotspots in India listed by the government - has been temporarily shut and declared a containment zone after three doctors and 26 nurses tested positive for the highly contagious novel coronavirus. A probe has also been ordered to investigate the unprecedented spike in the number of cases and rapid spread of COVID-19 at the Wockhardt Hospital, officials said.</p>
<p>Nobody will be allowed to enter or exit the building till all the patients admitted at the hospital test negative twice. More than 270 patients and nurses are being tested. The outpatient department and emergency services have been suspended; hospital canteen will provide food to the patients and nurses.</p>
<p>In a statement, Wockhardt Hospital said, &ldquo;The hospital adheres to the highest global standards of infection and quality control. The source of the infection is identified as a 70 year old patient who was admitted to the hospital on March 17 for a cardiac emergency. The patient was asymptomatic (showed no symptoms of COVID19).&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On March 26, the patient developed cough, and was tested for COVID19, which turned out positive. The hospital staff were unknowingly exposed to the infection in the time period. We are informing the healthcare sector at large not to be misled by asymptomatic patients,&rdquo; the statement added.</p>
<p>More than 270 patients and nurses are being tested at Wockhardt Hospital in Mumbai.</p>
<p>An aggressive containment plan was released by Union Health Ministry on Sunday for large outbreaks of COVID-19, which includes buffer zones and sealing off areas for nearly a month. The strategy is meant to contain the illness caused by a novel coronavirus, first detected in China in December. The 20-page document says the aggressive containment strategy will be scaled down only if no new cases of COVID-19 are reported for at least four weeks after the last confirmed test.</p>
<p>Mumbai, one of the worst hit metro cities by coronavirus outbreak in India, has reported 458 of Maharashtra&rsquo;s 745 cases. The state, which has the highest number of COVID-19 patients in the country, has recorded 45 deaths so far linked to COVID-19 and 30 of these deaths have been registered from Mumbai.</p>
<p>The city is also home to one of the largest slums in Asia - Dharavi - where five cases, including one death, were reported last week. Over a million people live here within five square kilometres.</p>
<p>Across India, more than 4,000 people have tested positive for coronavirus so far, death count has crossed the 100-mark, the Union Health Ministry said today.</p>
<p>Over 1,000 of India&rsquo;s total cases are connected to the event organised by the Islamic sect Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi&rsquo;s Nizamuddin area last month.

Wockhardt Hospital in Mumbai Central</p>

<p>MUMBAI: Lack of preparedness to tackle the epidemic has led to 10 nurses at Wockhardt Hospital in Mumbai Central contracting the infection, claimed a family member of one of the nurses on Friday. In a letter circulated widely by the United Nurses Association (UNA), the outbreak was blamed on the hospital’s failure to segregate suspected or Covid-19 cases, an inability to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) and delay in quarantining and testing of nurses.The hospital has suspended all non-emergency services. Hospital sources said almost all 265 nurses are under observation to contain further spread. They have also been started on preventive medicine, hydroxychloroquine.It is suspected a patient, who came with symptoms of heart attack and later tested positive, was the source. The hospital maintains the man, who succumbed to Covid-19, developed symptoms after four days of treatment.The letter marked to chief ministers of Maharashtra and Kerala — since many nurses are from there — alleged that suspected Covid-19 patients were kept in the general ICU and attended by nurses without PPEs. On March 28, two nurses who had attended to the patient who tested positive. The union claims the hospital didn’t expedite tracing contacts of the nurses, which would be fellow nurses.“Eight to twelve nurses stay in one flat and they should have been promptly quarantined. However, the hospital not only failed to inform them on time, they continued to put some of them on duties,” said Jibin T C, president, UNA (Maharashtra). Subsequently, eight more nurses tested positive.In a serious allegation, the union said: “One nurse who was directly exposed to a Covid-19 case was on duty till April 1, while another who developed symptoms had to remain on duty till she fell very sick. Nurses with symptoms were transported in the same bus as other nurses.” A civic team visited the hospital on Thursday and put quarantine seals on their hands.A hospital source refuted the charges, saying till the patient started showing symptoms and tested positive, they had no option but to continue treating him. “The first Covid-19 positive case got admitted on March 27. The statements are baseless and do not reflect the facts. We are providing appropriate PPE and prophylactic medication for our hospital staff,” said the hospital in a release.Incidentally, the hospital has recorded three coronavirus deaths so far. A surgeon working there too has tested positive. Officials said he had suspected he was infected and had called the BMC helpline. Oficials said Jaslok Hospital too has 10 Covid-19-positive staffers, including six nurses.
