<p>Whilst the coronavirus has meant tomorrow&rsquo;s Grand National has been cancelled, millions are still expected to tune into ITV tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because the broadcaster is hosting a virtual version of the race, with all proceeds raising money for NHS charities.</p>
<p>Punters will still be able to have a flutter on the race, with 40 CGI horses, representing those that should have ran in real life, set to take to the track.</p>
<p>How does it work?</p>
<p>(Image: Getty Images)</p>
<p>The virtual Grand National will be a computer-simulated replica of Aintree, with the 40 horses and riders who were most likely to run.</p>
<p>Designed by Inspired Entertainment, they will use generated imagery to recreate all aspects of the course layout.</p>
<p>The computer will take data from previous performances by horses and the outcome will use factors such as age, weight and form to decide the horse best-placed to win.</p>
<p>That data has been used to generate odds on the race.</p>
<p>How to watch</p>
<p>The virtual race will be on ITV1 from 5pm on Saturday, April 4.</p>
<p>Nick Luck and Alice Plunkett will lead the coverage with Stewart Machin commentating.</p>
<p>The race will be pre-recorded rather than broadcast live.</p>
<p>How to take part</p>
<p>(Image: PA)</p>
<p>As always, we&rsquo;ve created a sweepstake that has all 40 riders and horses, along with a table to keep track of which person has which horse.</p>
<p>All you need to do is cut out the individual horses and then each player has to pick at least one at random.</p>
<p>You can then follow the race rooting for a certain horse to add a bit more excitement.</p>
<p>The sweepstake can be found here - good luck!</p>

<h3 id="2020-virtual-grand-national-how-does-the-race-work-and-when-is-it-on">2020 Virtual Grand National: how does the race work and when is it on?</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.racingpost.com/favicon.ico" alt="img">
Virtual Grand National: computer-simulated race to be shown on ITV1 at 5pm on Saturday</p>
<p>The real Grand National has sadly been cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, but on Saturday millions will tune in to ITV to watch its replacement: a computer-simulated running of the nation&rsquo;s favourite race. Here&rsquo;s the information you need to know:</p>
<p>How does it work?</p>
<p>The Virtual Grand National is a computer-simulated version of Aintree&rsquo;s world-famous steeplechase, designed by Inspired Entertainment.</p>
<p>They used computer-generated imagery (CGI) to recreate, as accurately as possible, all aspects of the race such as the course layout and National fences.</p>
<p>The simulation itself is made up of mathematical algorithms using data taken from the horses&rsquo; previous performances. The race&rsquo;s outcome uses a number of factors such as age, weight, form and weather conditions but also contains details such as fallers, unseated riders and collapsing fences.</p>
<p>The Virtual Grand National will attempt to recreate the famous Aintree race</p>
<p>Data on all of the 40 runners from this year&rsquo;s race have been added and the computer has generated odds.</p>
<p>The three previous Virtual Grand Nationals have been strikingly accurate, with Tiger Roll completing the virtual-real life double in 2018.</p>
<p>Virtual Grand National winners (real life result)</p>
<p>2019 Rathvinden (third)</p>
<p>2018 Tiger Roll (won)</p>
<p>2017 Cause Of Causes (second)</p>
<p>How can I watch the race?</p>
<p>The Virtual Grand National will be broadcast live on ITV1 at 5pm on Saturday. Coverage will be led by Nick Luck with Alice Plunkett and Richard Pitman on as pundits. Stewart Machin will be commentating.</p>
<p>The broadcast will also feature a race of champions, a simulation of previous Aintree greats being tested in an epic clash between 40 famous race winners.</p>
<p>Can I bet on it?</p>
<p>Yes. Bookmakers are keen to support the race and on Wednesday it was revealed that they would be donating any profits taken on the race to the NHS.</p>
<p>While the race has been pre-recorded, producers Carm Productions have vowed to ensure the result will not leak out to the betting market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the Virtual Grand National show is pre-recorded, we insist on strict levels of confidentiality from everyone involved in the production process,&rdquo; the company said in a statement.</p>

<p>39 Kimberlite Candy, Richie McLernon, 16-1, 10-4</p>
<p>40 Walk In The Mill, James Best, 16-1, 10-4</p>
<p>Has a virtual race been used as a replacement before?</p>
<p>Yes, but not since the 1967-68 season. Racing was suspended then due to the outbreak of foot and mouth and the BBC broadcasted two computer-simulated races.</p>
<p>The King George VI Chase was simulated in an electric computer centre and commentated by Peter O&rsquo;Sullevan on the BBC.</p>
<p>The video below, broadcast by British Pathe, details the process of the computer-generated running of the 1967 Massey Ferguson Gold Cup, now traditionally known as the Caspian Caviar Gold Cup.</p>

THE Virtual Grand National is just a couple of days away!</p>
<p>Here is your ultimate guide to the final field of 40.</p>
<p>4 Tiger Roll will bid for a third straight victory in the Grand National</p>
<ol>
<li>Tiger Roll/Davy Russell</li>
</ol>
<p>What can you say that’s not already been said?</p>
<p>A wonderful servant to connections, he’s won the last two runnings of this race.</p>
<p>Not quite at his brilliant best at Cheltenham last time but still needs utmost respect back at his favourite course.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Bristol De Mai/Daryl Jacob</li>
</ol>
<p>Supremely talented at his beloved Haydock and not too shabby at Cheltenham either.</p>
<p>Has to carry a big weight here and this test on good to soft ground may not suit him as well as others.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Aso/Charlie Deutsch</li>
</ol>
<p>Ran the race of his life in last year’s Ryanair but that seems to have left its mark.</p>
<p>Too high in the weights and unproven at this distance makes him easily left out.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Elegant Escape/Jonjo O&rsquo;Neill Jnr</li>
</ol>
<p>Former Welsh Grand National winner loves a slog but this is bound to go too fast for him.</p>
<p>Not as good as he once was and could struggle.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Anibale Fly/Barry Geraghty</li>
</ol>
<p>Once classy enough to finish second in a Gold Cup, he’s become inconsistent and erratic.</p>
<p>However, he gets the services of Barry Geraghty and will like the ground, so all is not lost.</p>

<ol start="6">
<li>Top Ville Ben/Tommy Dowson</li>
</ol>
<p>A much improved performer this term but is undoubtedly overburdened and would much rather this was run at Wetherby.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Beware The Bear/Jerry McGrath</li>
</ol>
<p>Winner at the Cheltenham Festival last year, he’s often been one to think hard about the game.</p>
<p>Has a chance if putting it all together, but it’s a big ‘if’.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Peregrine Run/Kevin Sexton</li>
</ol>
<p>Has a big question mark over his stamina but can be given a chance at a mammoth price.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Jett/Sam Waley-Cohen</li>
</ol>
<p>Sam Wayey-Cohen takes the reins here, which is a plus straight away as he knows the course like the back of his hand.</p>
<p>Likely to have a willing partner who may just fade in the closing stages.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Alpha Des Obeaux/Richard Johnson</li>
</ol>
<p>Old boy who’d have a chance in his heyday but will probably struggle now.</p>
<p>That said, Richard Johnson is aboard and he can’t be discounted.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Total Recall/Paul Townend</li>
</ol>
<p>Rediscovered some of his spark this season and as a former Hennessy winner we know he’s on a good mark.</p>
<p>However, never stayed this far and could struggle at the business end.</p>
<p>4 Magic Of Light (left) was second in last year&rsquo;s race Credit: EPA</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>The Storyteller/Keith Donoghue</li>
</ol>
<p>Produced a fine performance at Cheltenham so we know he’s in good heart.</p>
<p>That was over hurdles, though, and he needs to jump better back over fences.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>Magic Of Light/Robbie Power</li>
</ol>
<p>Second in the contest last year, star mare has a big chance once again as she clearly loves the track.</p>
<p>She jumps very well and must have fine prospects of going one better.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>Talkischeap/Tom Cannon</li>
</ol>
<p>Very strong stayer and would have big prospects if he jumped a little better.</p>
<p>As it is, he’ll enjoy the ground and has a big chance.</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>Yala Enki/Bryony Frost</li>
</ol>
<p>Another strong stayer who had some very fine form in the book earlier in his career.</p>
<p>Has rediscovered some form for Paul Nicholls but needs a little more now.</p>
<p>A record sixth win for trainer Nigel Twiston-Davies 👀</p>
<p>Ballyoptic wins the bet365 Charlie Hall Chase! #ITVRacing pic.twitter.com/1hhJsnvMBc — ITV Racing (@itvracing) November 2, 2019</p>
<ol start="16">
<li>Ballyoptic/Sam Twiston-Davies</li>
</ol>
<p>Needs soft ground to be seen at his best and won’t get that here.</p>
<p>Won the Charlie Hall earlier in the season and has claims for the Twiston-Davies clan.</p>
<ol start="17">
<li>Burrows Saint/Rachael Blackmore</li>
</ol>
<p>Irish Grand National winner from last season has stamina in spades and will be going longer than most.</p>
<p>Has the services of Rachael Blackmore and holds outstanding claims for Gold Cup-winning trainer Willie Mullins.</p>
<ol start="18">
<li>Definitly Red/Brian Hughes</li>
</ol>
<p>Smart chaser who comes here following a convincing win at Kelso.</p>
<p>One of the stronger challengers from the north but may struggle to stay.</p>
<p>A wonderful finish to the @DoncasterRaces feature! Ok Corral battles gamely to fend off Fingerontheswitch to plunder the big prize for @sevenbarrows under Derek O’Connor&hellip; pic.twitter.com/QxzB2EayWe — At The Races (@AtTheRaces) January 25, 2020</p>
<ol start="19">
<li>Sub Lieutenant/JJ Slevin</li>
</ol>
<p>Front-runner who’s smart at his best but this is surely too tough.</p>
<ol start="20">
<li>Ok Corral/Derek O&rsquo;Connor</li>
</ol>
<p>SkyBet Chase winner has plenty of stamina and should have more to come given he’s so lightly raced.</p>
<p>Derek O’Connor has been booked and he must have a good chance, though Nicky Henderson has never won the race.</p>
<ol start="21">
<li>Tout Et Permis/Sean Flanagan</li>
</ol>
<p>Galloping grey should have exploited lower marks over hurdles this season and this is far too hard.</p>
<ol start="22">
<li>Vintage Clouds/Danny Cook</li>
</ol>
<p>Haydock specialist destroyed them in the Peter Marsh and relishes a slog.</p>
<p>May not get that here and could just be tapped for toe.</p>
<p>4 The 2020 Randox Health Grand National will go ahead - but in slightly different circumstances Credit: Getty Images - Getty</p>
<ol start="23">
<li>Crievehill/Tom Bellamy</li>
</ol>
<p>Rapid improver this term but has reached his ceiling and probably won’t stay.</p>
<ol start="24">
<li>Lake View Lad/Henry Brooke</li>
</ol>
<p>Done well up north and has performed well at Cheltenham, but this isn’t likely to suit this heavy-ground mud lover.</p>
<ol start="25">
<li>Jury Duty/Mark Enright</li>
</ol>
<p>Probably should have won last time out and doesn’t appear to be the weapon he once was.</p>
<p>Respected for Gordon Elliott but might just find a few too strong.</p>
<ol start="26">
<li>Pleasant Company/David Mullins</li>
</ol>
<p>Second in this two years ago was a fine effort and we know he stays well.</p>
<p>Not as good last year and could struggle now he’s another year older.</p>

<ol start="27">
<li>Acapella Bourgeois/Danny Mullins</li>
</ol>
<p>A fine front-runner in his youth has rediscovered some of his old zest of late.</p>
<p>Could go well at a big price.</p>
<ol start="28">
<li>Shattered Love/Lisa O&rsquo;Neill</li>
</ol>
<p>Mare with plenty of ability but hasn’t fired in the last couple of seasons.</p>
<p>Owners have a much better chance with Tiger Roll.</p>
<ol start="29">
<li>Any Second Now/Mark Walsh</li>
</ol>
<p>Won a Grade 3 in fine style last time and has been targeted at this ever since.</p>
<p>Has very strong claims if staying the distance.</p>
<ol start="30">
<li>Potters Corner /Jack Tudor</li>
</ol>
<p>Welsh National winner loves a stamina test and may not necessarily need heavy ground to be seen at his best.</p>
<p>Jack Tudor takes the ride and we’ve seen how good he is.</p>
<ol start="31">
<li>Dounikos/Luke Dempsey</li>
</ol>
<p>Pulled-up in three of his last four starts, including in this race last year, and surely faces too big an ask here.</p>
<ol start="32">
<li>Kildisart/Nico de Boinville</li>
</ol>
<p>Ran a huge race at the Cheltenham Festival and gets in off a nice weight here.</p>
<p>Has it to prove over this trip but has a chance if he gets it.</p>
<p>🗣️“It was John Gosden – he congratulated her and told her to pass it on to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David Bridgewater says Ultima winner The Conditional will be aimed at the Ladbrokes Trophy again next season plus reveals an interesting story regarding John Gosden! ⬇️https://t.co/g5Ff7v8P4o pic.twitter.com/jLu1dAm0TA — Racing TV (@RacingTV) March 18, 2020</p>
<ol start="33">
<li>Death Duty/Gavin Brouder</li>
</ol>
<p>Couldn’t get to grips with a fine jumper last time out after a long absence and is certainly best watched in these tougher waters.</p>
<ol start="34">
<li>Ramses De Teillee/Tom Scudamore</li>
</ol>
<p>Fine stayer with plenty of exceptional form over hurdles this season.</p>
<p>Has run well in the Welsh National before but probably needs softer ground.</p>
<ol start="35">
<li>Valtor/James Bowen</li>
</ol>
<p>Decent on his day but has plenty to prove, even under James Bowen.</p>
<p>4 Valtor will run in the Virtual Grand National for Nicky Henderson Credit: PA:Press Association</p>
<ol start="36">
<li>Saint Xavier/David Maxwell</li>
</ol>
<p>Has some good form this term but it would be some achievement if David Maxwell were to win this on his first attempt.</p>
<ol start="37">
<li>Warriors Tale/Harry Cobden</li>
</ol>
<p>Won the 2018 Grand Sefton Chase over these fences, form which would give him a shout.</p>
<p>However, has stamina to prove and is coming into this out of form.</p>
<ol start="38">
<li>Double Shuffle/Jonathan Burke</li>
</ol>
<p>Very little form to suggest he has a chance in this.</p>
<ol start="39">
<li>Kimberlite Candy/Richie McLernon</li>
</ol>
<p>Has got a very low weight and that gives him a huge chance considering he improved markedly to win Warwick’s Classic Chase last time.</p>
<p>Has all the hallmarks of a Grand National winner and might just the one to put it up to the market principals.</p>
<ol start="40">
<li>Walk In The Mill/James Best</li>
</ol>
<p>Loves Aintree and finished fourth in the race last year.</p>
<p>A year older and wiser now and his Becher Chase victory suggests he’ll produce another big run.
