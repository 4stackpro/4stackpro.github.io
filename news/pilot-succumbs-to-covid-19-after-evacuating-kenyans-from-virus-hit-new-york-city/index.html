<p>A senior Kenya Airways pilot has paid the ultimate price for his heroic efforts to evacuate Kenyans stranded in the Covid-19-hit New York City.</p>
<p>Captain Daudi Kimuyu Kibati, who was taken ill on March 29, died on April 1, a week after performing his last international assignment.</p>
<p>SECOND PATIENT</p>
<p>His death was announced by Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe during his daily press briefing on Thursday, as one of the two patients to die of the virus in Kenya this week.</p>
<p>Captain Kibati was in charge of the last flight from New York to Nairobi which evacuated Kenyans stranded in the United States, before the government’s ban on international flights took effect last Wednesday.</p>
<p>Before the government suspended all international flights on March 25, Kenya Airways offered a one way complimentary ticket to Kenyans stranded in New York City who wished to return home.</p>
<p>New York City was being put on lockdown on March 23, the same day the last KQ flight was departing from the John F Kennedy Airport.</p>
<p>STRICT TIMELINES</p>
<p>By then, the death toll in New York had surpassed the 1,200 and more than 90,000 Covid-19 cases had been confirmed across the US.</p>
<p>According to sources at Kenya Airways who requested anonymity, Captain Kibati, who piloted the Dreamliner 787, was tasked with evacuating Kenyans from a city ravaged by the virus under very strict timelines.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The flight had to leave New York City before the lockdown was announced New York Governor Andrew Cuomo began and it had to arrive in Nairobi before March 25.</p>
<p>Upon touchdown at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport on March 24, the 61-year-old pilot proceeded for self-quarantine, at the Ole Sereni Hotel, alongside his first officer.</p>
<p>Passengers were supposed to be taken to government designated quarantine facilities at their cost. Some of the flight cabin crew were booked at the Four Points Hotel within JKIA.</p>
<p>Captain Kibati, a retired Major of the Kenya Air Force put his life on the line to rescue his countrymen trapped abroad.</p>
<p>The previous week, the pilot who was born in Maliku area of Kitui County had flown another flight from Nairobi to Rome, and back to Nairobi, before being dispatched to New York.</p>
<p>FEVER</p>
<p>Italy has recorded the highest coronavirus cases in Europe, with the World Health Organisation reporting 13, 157 deaths and 110,574 confirmed Covid-19 cases, as of on Friday.</p>
<p>The pilot tested negative upon arrival in Nairobi and two more times but stayed isolated from his family and friends until March 29 when he developed sore throat and fever.</p>
<p>According to his brother Arnold Kibati, he was taken to Nairobi Hospital where he was immediately admitted after testing positive for the virus.</p>
<p>“He tested positive for coronavirus on the eighth day after undergoing rigorous medical screening in all the cities he flew to, and three more tests in Nairobi which were negative,” Mr Arnold told Nation on Friday.</p>
<p>He said the captain stayed in hospital for two days before succumbing on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A statement released by Evelyne Munyoki, the Chief Human Resources Officer, Kenya Airways said: “On behalf of the Board of Directors, the Management and Staff of Kenya Airways, we join the family of the late Captain Kibati in mourning their beloved one and pray that the Almighty God will strengthen them during this time of sorrow.”

<p><img src="https://www.kenyanews.go.ke/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/android-chrome-256x256-150x150.png" alt="img">
A sleepy village in Kavisuni, Kitui Rural constituency is mourning the loss of a seasoned Kenya Airways pilot Major (Rtd) Captain Daudi Kimuyu Kibati who succumbed to Covid-19 infection.</p>
<p>Captain Kibati died on April 1 at a Nairobi Hospital according to a statement released by KQ Chief Human Resources Officer Everlyne Munyoki on April 2.</p>
<p>Munyoki said that the late pilot was a Captain of the 787 fleet in the KQ Operations Department.</p>
<p>The pilot who enjoyed stellar accomplishments in the aviation industry pioneered his career at the Kenya Air Force as a jet pilot before plunging into commercial flights at the national carrier Kenya Airways after retirement.</p>
<p>Following his death, the family has requested that since he led a private life, he should be mourned away from the media glare.</p>
<p>Captain Kibati flew the last Dreamliner to land in JKIA on Wednesday March 25 and immediately went into quarantine with all the crew members following the outbreak of coronavirus in the country.</p>
<p>He is fondly remembered in his village as the pilot who occasionally flew a chopper hovering over Maliku Primary School just to inspire the pupils to dream big.</p>
<p>Kitui Assembly Deputy Speaker Kasee Musya (MCA Kisasi Ward) eulogized the late Captain Kibati describing him as one of the most dependable pilots who served the country diligently.</p>
<p>Plans are underway to inter his remains at his rural home on Saturday in the presence of close family members under the supervision of healthcare workers.</p>
