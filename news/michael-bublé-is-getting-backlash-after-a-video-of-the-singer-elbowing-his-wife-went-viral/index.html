<p>Fans expressed their concern for Lopilato&rsquo;s safety after watching the video and began resurfacing old recordings of Bublé&rsquo;s tense interactions with his wife.</p>

<p>Michael Bublé is facing criticism after a recent video of the singer elbowing his wife Luisana Lopilato went viral. Now, Lopilato has responded to defend her husband.</p>
<p>The couple was reading a children&rsquo;s book together on Instagram live for parents self-isolating with their kids during the coronavirus pandemic. In the opening moments of the video, the 32-year-old Argentinian actress enthusiastically greets the viewers, speaking over Bublé.</p>
<p>The 44-year-old singer then elbows her in the side, and Lopilato apologizes to him, muttering &ldquo;perdón&rdquo; and &ldquo;sorry,&rdquo; before he pulls her toward him. Shortly after, he pushes Lopilato away after she tries to fix his hair.</p>
<p>After viewing the Instagram livestream, Lopilato&rsquo;s fans took to Twitter to voice their concerns that Bublé was mistreating his wife.</p>
<p>—sabina frederic stan account (@seinfeldista) April 14, 2020</p>
<p>Some users even resurfaced old videos of Bublé and Lopilato to show that the Instagram livestream wasn&rsquo;t the first time they&rsquo;ve been worried about the relationship.</p>
<p>In one of the videos, Bublé reprimands Lopilato and says, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so dead,&rdquo; after she shows up next to him two minutes late. Another video that a fan resurfaced shows Lopilato recording herself on a front-facing camera as Bublé tells her, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to kill you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fans also pointed out online that the singer himself has said previously that he had violent tendencies during a 2013 interview with Event Magazine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m a kind, generous, gentle soul who&rsquo;s an egotistical, hard f&mdash;ing a&ndash;hole. I was prone to violence as a kid, and I&rsquo;ll tell you now, I&rsquo;m not a big man — I&rsquo;m about 5 foot 10 inches and weigh about 160 pounds — but I could do it again, and probably will,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And shouldn&rsquo;t and have every reason not to and everything to lose — but probably will do it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As online users called out Bublé for his behavior and urged the actress to leave him, Lopilato publicly defended her husband, with whom she shares three children, in an Instagram statement she shared on Monday. Hola! translated the message from Spanish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s incredible how some people are!! While we are in the middle of a pandemic, and living our lives under quarantine, angst, fear, loneliness, and uncertainty of all kinds! [I] come out every day with my husband to try to do [Instagram] lives to bring some happiness, entertainment, longing, and we have to put up with, hear and see what people with ill intentions are posting without knowing anything about our family and after all the pain that we have experienced, I want you all to know that I have no doubts about who my husband is and that I would choose him again a thousand times over,&rdquo; she wrote.</p>
<p>Lopilato continued, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair! This person is causing harm and taking advantage of this pandemic where people are suffering, dying and under quarantine, to gain fame and more followers. They are sharing lies and that I will not allow because they are disrespecting my family, so I ask all of you who have trusted me for years to not allow this either! Without anymore to say and doing what I believe is correct when someone comes after my family, and leave the consequences to God! The world needs more now than ever &lsquo;love, faith, values, unity and solidarity&rsquo; NOT these kind of people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2020, domestic violence cases across the US and the globe are on the rise as the coronavirus pandemic forces abusers and their victims to shelter in place together.</p>
<p>Insider has reached out to Bublé and Lopilato&rsquo;s representatives and had not heard back at the time of this story.</p>
<p>If you, or someone you know, is in danger of domestic abuse, you can reach the US National Domestic Violence Hotline on their website, by phone at 1-800-799-7233 and TTY 1-800-787-3224, or text LOVEIS to 22522.

Richard Dobson/Newspix via Getty ImagesMany are optimistically looking forward to life returning to normal after the COVID-19 pandemic, with some dreaming of they day they can safely return to the gym and work out again.</p>
<p>Leave it to Michael Bublé to prove that it is definitely not the smartest idea to jump right back into one&rsquo;s usual workout routine post-quarantine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holidays are over. Back to the gym,&rdquo; The four-time Grammy winner captioned the hilarious photo of him passed out on the gym floor on Tuesday. &ldquo;I feel GREAT!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the photo, Bublé is lying face down and sprawled out on the floor while surrounded by conveniently placed workout items &ndash; a singular dumbbell, stability ball, and barbell.</p>
<p>While the photo was most likely meant to give fans a quick smile, many took to the comment section to further roast the &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t Met you Yet&rdquo; singer.</p>
<p>The worst burn came from &ldquo;Despacito&rdquo; artist Luis Fonsi, who helpfully pointed out, &ldquo;You need some [sun emoji] bro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides hitting the gym to get back into shape again, Bublé is gearing up for the One World: Together at Home global special that airs across all major networks and streaming services on Saturday, April 18 at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET.</p>
<p>The Global Citizen and World Health Organization broadcast special aims to celebrate and support healthcare workers while entertaining those sheltering at home in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.hellomagazine.com/imagenes/celebrities/2020041487926/luisana-lopilato-thanks-fans-after-defending-marriage/0-422-33/michael-buble-wife-t.jpg" alt="img">
Michael Buble&rsquo;s wife has thanked her fans for their support after being forced to defend her nine-year marriage to the singer. In a new live video shared online, Luisana Lopilato told her followers: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen your messages over the weekend and I am very thankful. Thank you for worrying. It&rsquo;s very important that we pay attention to these problems that have been mentioned and that I am lucky not to suffer. But it is important to pay attention to be able to help women that are going through it.&rdquo; She concluded: &ldquo;Thank you. But it&rsquo;s not in my case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luisana and Michael have been happily married since 2011</p>
<p>It comes after Luisana, 32, took to Instagram to hit out at online followers urging her to leave her husband. The couple have been filming a series of live videos detailing aspects of their home life during lockdown. Some viewers subsequently expressed concern about the way 44-year-old Michael comes across in the clips. &ldquo;I want you to know that I have no doubts who my husband is and I would choose him a thousand times over!!&rdquo; the Argentinian model stated. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not fair! This person is doing harm and taking advantage of this pandemic where people are suffering, dying to have fame and more followers.</p>
