The Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists and Dentists’ Union (KMPDU) Secretary General and CEO Dr Ouma Oluga has resigned.</p>
<p>This follows his appointment as Nairobi City County Chief Officer for Health in the newly created Nairobi Metropolitan Services (NMS) Office headed by appointed Maj Gen Abdalla Badi as the Director General and Enosh Onyango Momanyi as Deputy Director General.</p>
<p>In a circular from the Head of Public Service Joseph Kinyua dated March 23, 2020, he is among 32 officers who have been identified for posting/deployment from both the National Government and County Governments to join NMS team.</p>
<p>“The concerned Ministries/Departments and County Governments are required to release the above-mentioned officers to report to the Director General, Nairobi Metropolitan Services immediately but not later than 3rd April 2020, ” said Kinyua.</p>

<p>In a statement Dr Ouma says his last five years as SG has been filled with sweetness and sorrow in equal measure. And he would not have wanted any of that experience any different than it has been.</p>
<p>“Being a KMPDU leader plunges one into a School of Doctorate for public service. And there is often no room for failure. Just success demanded. That is how it should be. We have succeeded multiple times. And we failed a few times. We cried together and laughed together. I have been loved on your behalf and I have also been hated on your behalf.” He said</p>
<p>“For many years, I put my own life wants at the back so that I serve you diligently without any conflict. Not a single day in the five years of my service to you have I been conflicted. Many times I have ignored that reward that would look like a bribe and compromise my ability to serve you. Even when I faced punishment myself, I kept it a secret for your own sake.” He added.</p>
<p>He noted that the last five years have been good for KMPDU as they signed CBAs with 48 county governments and brought forth and permanently ended struggles of internship.</p>
<p>“We streamlined post graduate training sponsorship and more importantly, we united doctors and gave them a voice in the society. There are many more things we did. You all did it. It is my turn to say thank you. These last five years have seen the union change in a way we never envisioned. From a 1200 membership to more than 4000 members. From a reactionary organisation to one with a five year strategic plan that clearly states what the future must be.” He noted.</p>
<p>He called on the health workers to rise beyond duty and be defenders of humanity.</p>
<p>“It is not and will never be the opportunity to coil back and shout horse about how valuable you are and what the world owes you. It goes without saying that the safety of every health worker comes first. It is true that health workers have been casualties in this pandemic. We must protect us first. It is also true that health workforce must be protected and expanded at this time when the all health systems are stretched beyond limit. Dear Kenyan doctors, please rise up to the occasion and guide society at their time of most need. Value shall follow that selflessness.” He urged.</p>
<p>President Uhuru Kenyatta created the NMS to take charge of Nairobi County functions officially transferred to the National Government.</p>
<p>It was tasked with fighting cartels that have been derailing service delivery in Nairobi County in its 100 days. The Nairobi Metropolitan Services is to tackle key functions of Nairobi County that include, health, transport, public works and urban planning.</p>
<p>President Kenyatta has also directed NMS to ensure they operationalise effective garbage collection in partnership with National Youth Service.</p>
<p>NMS will work on streamlining urban renewal projects such as Jevanjee, Pangani, and others, which had been previously awarded before 2018 and have continually been delayed.</p>
<p>The NMS will also review these projects and make determinations on how the projects can take off, realizing that the development of these projects are a part of the recently concluded Eastlands Urban Renewal Masterplan.</p>
<p>In addition the team will focus on streamlining development control and approvals for the County.</p>

Nairobi Metropolitan Services takes shape as new officers appointed</p>
<p>Major General Mohamed Abdalla Badi, Director-General Nairobi Metropolitan Services. [Jonah Onyango/Standard]</p>
<p>The national government has moved to assert its authority over Nairobi County after the takeover of key functions.Last Friday, Head of Civil Service Joseph Kinyua deployed 32 officers to various positions within the Nairobi Metropolitan Service headed by Major General Mohammed Badi. Among those deployed include six chief officers and seven directors. The circular by Kinyua said: “The concerned ministries/departments and county governments are required to release the above mentioned officers to report to the director-general, Nairobi Metropolitan Service immediately but not later than April 3, 2020.”</p>
<p>SEE ALSO :No error at all in ‘End of an error?’ headline</p>
<p>The appointed officials will now have to work with the team they will find at City Hall. For instance, the chief officers appointed will discharge their duties under the county executive committee members who were appointed by Mike Sonko. Among those posted include Dr Ouma Oluga as Chief Officer, Health, moving him from Vihiga County where he has been a medical officer at the county referral hospital. Following his appointment, Oluga tendered his resignation as secretary general of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU). In his letter to the members, he stated, “The last five years have been filled with sweetness and sorrow in equal measure. And I would not have wanted any of that experience any different than it has been. Being a KMPDU leader makes one stronger.”</p>

<p>Oluga will work with Health CEC Hitan Majevdia. This raises the question as to how functions will be carried out and where officers in these dockets will be left. But Nairobi City County Assembly Speaker Beatrice Elachi sees no problem in the new appointments, saying the the national government has the duty to rearrange the functions as it so desires to achieve service delivery.</p>
<p>SEE ALSO :Ndakaini is full, why are taps in Nairobi still dry?</p>
<p>“The functions that have been signed off went with the staff and the agreement allows the national government to deploy,” said Elachi.She added those in the dockets taken over can be redeployed to any other department within the national government. Those coming are also civil servants but there is still going to be a lot of discussions on how to handle the functions. The new team comes into office when the country is fighting the coronavirus pandemic and Oluga’s health docket is among those that will be in the limelight.</p>
