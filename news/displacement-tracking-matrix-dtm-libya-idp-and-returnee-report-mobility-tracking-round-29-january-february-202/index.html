KEY FINDINGS</p>
<p>IDPs</p>
<p>373,709: IDPs in Libya</p>
<p>96% were displaced due to the deterioration of the security situation</p>
<p>59% of IDPs live in self-paid rented accommodation</p>
<p>Returnees</p>
<p>448,573: Returnees in Libya</p>
<p>Decline in returns observed due to lack of security</p>
<p>83% of returnees live in their previous homes</p>
<p>OVERVIEW</p>
<p>This report presents the findings of Round 29 of the mobility tracking component of the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) programme in Libya, covering the reporting period from January to February 2020.</p>
<p>In Round 29, the number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) identified in Libya increased from 355,762 IDPs to 373,709 IDPs. New displacements during the reporting period were primarily due to continued armed conflict in western Libya and floods in Eastern Libya in Tobruk and surrounding areas in February*. Towards the end of the data collection cycle intensification in the conflict was reported in the areas of Sirt and Abu Gurayn, resulting in the displacement of over 4,650 individuals to surrounding areas. For further details on displacement from Abu Gurayn and from parts of Sirt please refer to page 7.</p>
<p>The sustained use of air strikes and artillery shelling in the vicinity of areas inhabited by civilians continues to negatively impact the safety and lives of the civilian population in southern Tripoli region (mantika) and other conflict-areas in Western Libya. The protracted conflict that started on 04 April 2019 has resulted in the new displacement of at least 201,168 individuals over the past year as the number of IDPs in Libya increased from 172,541 prior to the onset of hostilities in Round 24 to 373,709 IDPs in Round 29) Displacement was not only observed from Tripoli and surrounding areas, but also from Murzuq in Southern Libya and, more recently, other conflict-affected areas in Western Libya such as Abu Gurayn and Sirt. IDP families displaced to locations close to areas of conflict remain at risk, along with host community members providing them with shelter.</p>
<p>Overall, the Tripoli region (mantika) currently hosts the largest number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Libya. In the context of ongoing armed conflict in and around south Tripoli since April 2019, and the protracted cases of previously displaced households, the municipalities of Tripoli region collectively host almost 97,000 IDPs. In Round 29 no significant return movements were reported, as IDPs return to their places of origin continued to be constrained by the ongoing armed conflict and its associated insecurity in their places of origin.

<p><img src="https://cdn.business2community.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/hashtags-awario-900x563.png" alt="img">
Every time we’re tempted to think of hashtags as the newest thing of the past, we’re proven wrong. In times of uncertainty, hashtags serve as a means of community building and information sharing. In a debate, hashtags are labels used to proclaim alliances and define adversaries. As part of a skillfully crafted marketing campaign, hashtags get scattered all over social media, amplifying reach and winning audiences.</p>
<p>Hashtags work, and they do so quite remarkably (think #MeToo). However earthshaking, though, hashtags come and go.

<h3 id="cdc-unveils-1st-national-coronavirus-pandemic-tracking-system">CDC Unveils 1st National Coronavirus Pandemic Tracking System</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.npr.org/include/images/facebook-default-wide.jpg?s=1400" alt="img">
CDC Unveils 1st National Coronavirus Pandemic Tracking System</p>
<p>The federal government Saturday unveiled the first detailed national system for tracking the coronavirus pandemic in the United States.</p>
<p>The new COVIDView system will provide weekly updates aimed at monitoring the outbreak across the country, based on the results of tests for the virus, people seeking care for flu-like systems and pneumonia and those diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s really important,&rdquo; Lynnette Brammer of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who&rsquo;s leading the effort, told NPR in an interview. &ldquo;Information is vitally important. It allows us to see where we&rsquo;re going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shortage of testing for the coronavirus has been a major problem hindering the nation&rsquo;s ability to understand the scope of the pandemic in the United States and develop the most effective counter measures, many public health experts say.</p>
<p>The absence of a coordinated national tracking system forced states to scramble to develop their own approaches, drawing from data routinely gathered from doctors and hospitals to monitor the flu.</p>
<p>The development of the CDC was welcomed by many public health experts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the information will be valuable,&rdquo; says Marc Lipsitch, a leading epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health.</p>
<p>But Lipsitch and others criticized the agency for failing to develop a system like this much sooner and said the system still falls far short of what&rsquo;s needed. For example, information is really needed on a daily basis, several said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in the middle of the greatest pandemic in a century,&rdquo; says Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. &ldquo;So I think what they&rsquo;re doing is fine and it is helpful. But we need something much more than that. The pandemic doesn&rsquo;t take the weekend off.&rdquo;
