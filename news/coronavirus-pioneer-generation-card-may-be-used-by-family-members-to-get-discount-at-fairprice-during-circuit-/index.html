SINGAPORE - From Wednesday (April 15), seniors do not need to shop at FairPrice outlets in person to enjoy discounts offered by the supermarket chain.</p>
<p>They can pass their Pioneer Generation cards to family members to shop on their behalf.</p>
<p>FairPrice said in a statement on Monday that it is making the exception to protect the well-being of senior members in the community.</p>
<p>This will take effect from Wednesday until the end of the circuit breaker measures on May 4.</p>
<p>Pioneer Generation members , who are Singapore citizens 71 years old or above this year, enjoy a 3 per cent discount for purchases of up to $200 a day on Mondays and Wednesdays.</p>
<p>Family members must present the Pioneer Generation card of their kin to enjoy the discount.</p>
<p>Last year, FairPrice gave out $4.26 million in savings under the Pioneer Generation discount scheme.</p>
<p>Mr Seah Kian Peng, group chief executive of FairPrice Group, said: &ldquo;We hope that this - together with all our other current measures - will help to further protect and keep (Pioneer Generation members) safe during these challenging times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FairPrice said earlier on March 24 that those of the Pioneer Generation, pregnant women and people with disabilities will have their own shopping time for an hour at its supermarkets.</p>

<p>This is during the first hour of each FairPrice store&rsquo;s normal operating hours on Mondays, and from 7am to 8am for stores that operate 24 hours.</p>
<p>The Pioneer Generation members still need to be present to gain entry to FairPrice stores during the priority shopping hour.</p>
<p>From Sunday, all customers visiting supermarkets, convenience stores, pharmacies and shopping malls must wear masks or they will be denied entry, Enterprise Singapore and the Singapore Tourism Board announced in a joint statement on Saturday.</p>
<p>This measure is to safeguard customers&rsquo; health and well-being, as well as that of other customers and staff working at these premises</p>
<p>Earlier on April 1, FairPrice said it has stepped up its cleaning regime since the Covid-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>Surfaces that are touched frequently, such as railings, trolleys, baskets and checkout counters, are cleaned every four hours.</p>
<p>This was in response to its Bedok Mall store being closed for three days after one of its back-end staff tested positive for Covid-19 on March 31.</p>
<p>The store reopened on April 4, after it had been thoroughly cleaned and disinfected.</p>
<p>As a precautionary measure, all non-packaged perishable food in the store was thrown out to avoid cross-contamination due to the disinfection and cleaning procedures, said the supermarket chain in a Facebook note on April 2.

<h3 id="ntuc-fairprice-to-introduce-weekly-priority-shopping-hour-for-pioneer-generation-senior-citizens-persons-with-disabilities-starting-next-week">NTUC FairPrice to introduce weekly priority shopping hour for Pioneer Generation senior citizens, persons with disabilities starting next week</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ntuc-psh-1.png" alt="img">
Patrons of NTUC FairPrice from the Pioneer Generation age bracket will be eligible for a weekly Priority Shopping Hour starting next Mon (30 Mar) in the latest measure introduced by the supermarket chain to promote social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>NTUC FairPrice in a Facebook post today said that the Priority Shopping Hour will also include persons with disabilities and pregnant women.</p>
<p>The Priority Shopping Hour will be held every Mon on the first hour of NTUC’s operating hours, or from 7am to 8am for the supermarket chain’s 24-hour stores.</p>
<p>For proof of eligibility, senior citizens may simply present their Pioneer Generation Card to enter the store, while persons with disabilities and pregnant women may inform staff members of their condition at the store entrance.</p>
<p>Pioneer Generation members, said NTUC FairPrice, will also enjoy the same additional discounts from the existing Pioneer Generation Discount Scheme when they shop on Mondays and Wednesdays.</p>
<p>“As the #COVID19 situation continues to evolve, we want to ensure everyone is able to fulfill their needs with us safely. Meanwhile, we encourage all our customers to continue observing the social distancing measures we have implemented in-store, buy only as needed, and stay safe,” said NTUC FairPrice.</p>
<p>While netizens generally appreciated NTUC FairPrice’s introduction of a Priority Shopping Hour, several netizens raised concerns about the timing and duration of the timeslot allocated, as they opined that one hour may be too short a duration for senior citizens and persons with disabilities to do their shopping.</p>
<p>One netizen asked if it is possible for Pioneer Generation seniors and persons with disabilities to have their carers or their next of kin to accompany them during the Priority Shopping Hour, as they may struggle to do their shopping alone.</p>
<p>One netizen questioned why the Merdeka Generation was not included in the Priority Shopping Hour, given that they are also senior citizens.</p>
<p>Pioneer Generation refers to Singapore citizens born on or before 31 Dec 1949 — namely aged 71 and above in 2020, while Merdeka Generation refers to Singapore citizens born from 1 Jan 1950 to 31 Dec 1959 — namely 61 to 70 years old in 2020.</p>
<p>One netizen suggested allocating a priority shopping hour for healthcare workers “to ensure their family is looked after, while they look after the nation”.
