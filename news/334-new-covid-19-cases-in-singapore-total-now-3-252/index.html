SINGAPORE (The Straits Times/ANN): Singapore reported 334 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday (April 14), bringing the total number of cases to 3,252 since the start of the outbreak.</p>
<p>Of the new cases, 198 are linked to known clusters, 22 are linked to other local cases, and 114 are as yet unlinked.</p>
<p>None was imported, said the Health Ministry&rsquo;s director of medical services, Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, at a press conference on Tuesday (April 14).</p>
<p>Commenting on the unlinked cases, Prof Mak said they did not necessarily mean that there is an unknown source of transmission and, as a result, community spread.</p>
<p>Some of the numbers are from active testing done in different settings - not just in larger purpose-built dormitories, but also other smaller ones, and it takes time to compile and match the figures, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, in fact, out of the proportion that are as yet unlinked, you will find that over the next few days that number whittles down progressively as we link them to existing clusters,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Giving an update on the work of an inter-agency task force a week after it was set up to support foreign workers, the Manpower Ministry Permanent Secretary Aubeck Kam said the teams deployed to all 43 purpose-built dormitories since last week have stabilised living conditions there.</p>
<p>Kam said the next phase of operations, which is &ldquo;very critical&rdquo;, would involve putting in place medical support so workers can receive good treatment.</p>
<p>The task force plans to set up medical teams at all 43 dormitories by the middle of this week, said Prof Mak.</p>
<p>This is up from the seven medical teams that are currently deployed at the eight dormitories that have been gazetted as isolation areas.</p>
<p>Said task force commander, Chief Guards Officer Seet Uei Lim: &ldquo;Now, our focus is on healthcare protection, and soon we will expand our healthcare capacity. The end state is to return to normalcy, ensure that dormitories can take care of our foreign friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the next steps, Brigadier-General Seet said: &ldquo;We intend to meet the welfare needs of our foreign friends, and looking ahead, Ramadan is coming and we&rsquo;re working with Muis on meeting the needs of our Muslim friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He added that the task force will also &ldquo;proactively case find to break the chain of infection&rdquo; and rope in medical workers from the polyclinics and general practitioners to beef up medical support.</p>
<p>The task force was formed last Tuesday (April 7) to ensure foreign workers&rsquo; well-being and improve their living conditions after dormitories emerged as a source of concern during the outbreak.</p>
<p>At least 15 dormitories have emerged as clusters, with eight declared as isolation areas so far. This means that workers have to be quarantined in their rooms for 14 days.</p>
<p>To date, 7,000 healthy foreign workers in essential services have been relocated to 18 temporary housing locations, such as facilities that fall under the Ministry of Defence (Mindef), Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Education and Sports Singapore.</p>
<p>This move is to minimise disruption to essential services, alleviate the load on public health amenities and minimise the risk of these healthy workers getting infected. - The Straits Times/Asia News Network

<p>3:01 pm: Hong Kong is &lsquo;highly resilient&rsquo; as it fights to save economy in the pandemic, says commerce secretary</p>
<p>Hong Kong is fighting a &ldquo;twin battle&rdquo; — fending off the coronavirus pandemic and trying to save its battered economy at the same time — but the city remains &ldquo;highly resilient&rdquo; despite the challenges, its commerce secretary said. Hong Kong&rsquo;s recovery depends on global trade and will be determined by when the world gets back on its feet, Edward Yau, Hong Kong&rsquo;s secretary for commerce and economic development, told CNBC. The Asian financial hub&rsquo;s economy has been hit hard by consecutive crises over the past year: from the U.S.-China trade war that intensified in 2018, to the months-long protests which shuttered shops and severely hit tourism last year. Now, the city is faced with a health and economic crisis brought on by the global coronavirus pandemic that has infected more than 1,000 people in the Chinese territory, and killed at least 4, according to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University. — Weizhen Tan</p>
<p>2:35 pm: China&rsquo;s exports, imports fell in March</p>

Economists polled by Reuters had expected exports from China to fall 14% in March from a year ago, while imports were projected to fall 9.5% over the same period. Li Kuiwen, a spokesman for the General Administration of Customs said there are difficulties in foreign trade, Reuters reported. Shrinking international demand will hit China&rsquo;s exports, even as recovering domestic demand lends support to China&rsquo;s economy, Li said. — Huileng Tan</p>
<p>2:07 pm: Easing restrictions too early could unleash second wave of infections, says expert</p>
<p>Countries run the risk of unleashing a second wave of infections of the coronavirus by lifting current restrictions on social distancing too early, according to an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong. As more countries see a spike in imported Covid-19 disease cases, fears of a second wave of infection have kept various authorities on their toes while they try to determine when to ease current restrictions that have dealt a blow to all but the most essential economic activities. ″&hellip; I think having timelines is going to be very challenging. No country is going to want to open up too early, and then be the first major country to have a big second wave,&rdquo; Ben Cowling, a professor at the School of Public Health at the University of Hong Kong, told CNBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Street Signs Asia&rdquo; on Monday. — Audrey Cher</p>

The Thai government canceled the national holiday to celebrate its traditional new year, or Songkran festival, during April 13-15 to keep people at home. Thai people usually celebrate the festival by gathering in large crowds on the streets for a water fight. — Yen Nee Lee</p>
<p>1:15 pm: India extends lockdown until May 3</p>
<p>India&rsquo;s coronavirus lockdown has been extended until May 3, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in an address to the nation. The initial 21-day lockdown was due to end on Tuesday.

<p>12:33 pm: Beijing may be using the pandemic to advance its interests in the South China Sea</p>
<p>While the coronavirus pandemic has stalled much of the world&rsquo;s activity, China has kept up its aggression in the disputed South China Sea — actions that analysts said could deepen the mistrust between Washington and Beijing. The sinking of a Vietnamese fishing boat by a Chinese surveillance vessel earlier this month once again brought into the spotlight Beijing&rsquo;s multi-year assertions in the South China Sea, in which it claims nearly the entire waterway. &ldquo;Fundamentally, China has not let the Covid-19 outbreak dampen its pursuit of foreign policy issues. In addition to the South China Sea, Beijing has also authorized air force flights around Taiwan in the past month,&rdquo; Kelsey Broderick, China analyst at consultancy Eurasia Group told CNBC. — Yen Nee Lee</p>
<p>11:23 am: India&rsquo;s Modi to address the nation</p>
<p>India Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to address the nation at 10 a.m. local time, according to the country&rsquo;s Press Information Bureau. Though no information was posted about what Modi&rsquo;s address is going to be, there is some speculation that he might formally announce the extension of a nationwide lockdown till the end of the month. The initial 21-day lockdown period ends today. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted about the possible extension on Saturday. Though Modi has not yet formally announced the decision, a recent summary of one of his meetings with all the state chief ministers indicated there was consensus for an extension. &ldquo;The Chief Ministers suggested that Lockdown should be extended by two weeks,&rdquo; the summary posted by his office said. As of 8 a.m. local time, the health ministry reported 10,363 cases of infections; 339 people were reported to have died and 1,035 have been cured and discharged. — Saheli Roy Choudhury</p>
<p>10:44 am: South Korea to submit supplementary budget plan</p>
<p>South Korea President Moon Jae-in said his government will submit a supplementary budget plan to parliament soon, Reuters reported. He reportedly stressed the need to prepare more measures to support the country&rsquo;s jobs market and companies that are getting hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. Moon said the government has decided to provide emergency cash payments for the first time in its constitutional history and that the economic crisis in South Korea is starting, according to the news wire. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 27 new cases and five additional deaths on Tuesday, bringing the total number of infections to 10,564 and fatalities to 222. — Saheli Roy Choudhury</p>
<p>9:57 am: Virgin Australia shares enter a trading halt</p>
<p>Virgin Australia shares entered a trading halt on Tuesday. The company cited ongoing discussions about financial assistance and restructuring alternatives to combat the financial impact of Covid-19. Last month, the company confirmed it requested financial support worth 1.4 billion Australian dollars (nearly $900 million) from Prime Minister Scott Morrison&rsquo;s government. Reuters reported Virgin remains in talks with the Australian government about various aid options and has hired investment bank Houlihan Lokey to advise the airline on a potential debt restructuring. The halt will remain in place until either the company makes an announcement or Thursday, April 16, whichever is earlier, Virgin said. Its shares are tightly controlled by a group of foreign airlines that include Singapore Airlines and Etihad Airways, according to Reuters. — Saheli Roy Choudhury</p>
<p>9:25 am: Revised Johns Hopkins University data brings confirmed global cases back below 2 million</p>
<p>Revised data from Johns Hopkins University showed global infection cases below 2 million again. At 9:25 a.m. Beijing time, there were 1,918,855 cases and 119,588 deaths reported. As of 9:25 a.m. Beijing time, the number of confirmed U.S. cases shown on the site stood at 581,679, an apparent revision of a total that exceeded 600,000 at 7:50 a.m. Beijing time. When contacted by CNBC, a representative from Hopkins said: &ldquo;At around the time you saw the 2 million mark the team found an anomaly in Florida data for Okaloosa that drove a spike from 19,985 to 123,019. It has since been corrected.&rdquo; — Saheli Roy Choudhury, Will Feuer Clarification: The earlier, incorrect information from Hopkins which overstated the global death toll has been removed from this live blog.</p>
<p>9:22 am: Los Angeles County to distribute debit cards as government aid &lsquo;isn&rsquo;t enough&rsquo;</p>
<p>Los Angeles County mayor Eric Garcetti said the county will open applications for residents to receive debit cards as financial assistance for low-income residents. It hopes to distribute to qualifying residents in one week. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s coming from Washington isn&rsquo;t enough,&rdquo; Garcetti said Monday. The county has already issued grocery gift cards from its &ldquo;Mayor&rsquo;s Fund&rdquo; which had help from private donations including Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. But, those ran out within four days, Garcetti said, adding that he expects the same to happen with the next batch of cards. Los Angeles County has the highest death rate in the state with 40% of California&rsquo;s Covid-19-positive cases, Garcetti said. The county expects the death rate to peak on Sunday, April 19th, granted residents abide by sheltering restrictions. — Jennifer Elias</p>
<p>8:25 am: China reports 89 new cases, says there&rsquo;s been no additional deaths recorded</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s National Health Commission said on April 13 there were 89 new cases of coronavirus infection, mostly travelers from overseas. Most of the travelers are likely Chinese nationals, since China closed its borders to most foreigners late last month. The official report did not specify nationalities. No additional virus-related deaths were reported and there were 54 instances of asymptomatic infection, where a person tested positive for the coronavirus but did not display any of the usual symptoms associated with it. China says it has had 82,249 confirmed cases and 3,341 deaths since the outbreak started. — Saheli Roy Choudhury</p>
<p>7:32 am: Singapore records its biggest single-day jump in cases</p>
<p>Singapore reported 386 new cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, as of noon local time on April 13. Most of them are linked to infection clusters in dormitories that house foreign workers. The inhabitants of those dormitories are typically men from other Asian countries who carry out labor-intensive construction jobs in order to support their families back home. Last week, Singapore announced an inter-agency task force whose goal is to contain the outbreak in the dormitories, which has worsened recently.</p>

<p>Monday&rsquo;s numbers brought the total cases in the city-state to 2,918, while nine people have succumbed to the illness. The daily reported infections have gone up exponentially since March, first due to a growing number of imported cases and then because of the outbreak in the dormitories. The health ministry said to-date 586 people have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals and community isolation facilities. — Saheli Roy Choudhury, Ted Kemp All times below are in Eastern time.</p>
<p>6:52 pm: Fauci walks back comment that earlier coronavirus social distancing would have saved lives</p>
<p>White House health expert Dr. Anthony Fauci walked back his recent comments about the initial U.S. response to the coronavirus, saying he used &ldquo;the wrong choice of words&rdquo; a day earlier when describing &ldquo;pushback about shutting things down.&rdquo; Fauci&rsquo;s comments from a CNN interview Sunday – in which he said that more lives &ldquo;obviously&rdquo; could have been saved if the U.S. made earlier efforts to contain the virus – were seen by some as a critique of the Trump administration&rsquo;s handling of the crisis. Trump later that evening retweeted a call to &ldquo;#FireFauci.&rdquo; A White House spokesman said Monday that the president &ldquo;is not firing Dr. Fauci,&rdquo; who &ldquo;has been and remains a trusted adviser to President Trump.&rdquo; Fauci on Monday evening defended his comments, and Trump&rsquo;s record on the coronavirus, while standing next to the president at the White House&rsquo;s daily briefing on the disease. — Kevin Breuninger</p>

<p>President Donald Trump said growth in new coronavirus infections stabilized and new hospitalizations in hot spots like New York slowed over the weekend, providing &ldquo;clear evidence that our aggressive strategy to combat the virus is working.&rdquo; &ldquo;Over the weekend, the number of daily new infections remained flat, nationwide flat,&rdquo; Trump said at a White House press conference with the coronavirus task force on Monday. &ldquo;Hospitalizations are slowing in hot spots like New York, New Jersey, Michigan and Louisiana. This is clear evidence that our aggressive strategy to combat the virus is working and that Americans are following the guidelines.&rdquo; — William Feuer</p>

<h3 id="less-than-half-in-singapore-willing-to-share-covid-19-results-with-contact-tracing-tech">Less than half in Singapore willing to share COVID-19 results with contact tracing tech</h3>
<p><img src="https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/03/12/a0a80a45-774f-40b7-8b57-ab6c79dd81f8/thumbnail/770x578/4de73371f249adf43563dd7179104a19/istock-962094400.jpg" alt="img">
Less than half of Singaporeans are comfortable sharing a positive COVID-19 test result with contact tracing technology, though 55% &ndash; the highest amongst six countries surveyed &ndash; are willing to do so with their employer or school. Ironically, while respondents are hesitant to reveal test results with their government, a majority across the global sample size would want to know if someone in their immediate neighbourhood tests positive.</p>
<p>Most respondents said they were comfortable sharing a positive COVID-19 test result with their doctor or public healthcare providers, with more than half in Singapore willing to do so. Just 28% of all respondents would do so with their government, revealed in a survey by management consulting firm Oliver Wyman. The study polled 3,500 respondents across Australia, Germany, Spain, the US, the UK, and Singapore, the latter of which 503 respondents were from.</p>

<p>Singapore, though, was the only country where a majority of 55% were comfortable sharing a positive test result with their employer or school.</p>
<p>Respondents in the UK, US, and German were the least comfortable sharing a positive COVID-19 test result with an app that required location data but not the identity of infected individuals. In Singapore, where the government last month launched a contact tracing app, 41% were comfortable sharing a positive test result with such technology.</p>
<p>Across the six markets, a majority were willing to share results of a COVID test &ndash; be it negative or positive &ndash; with an app only if the data was accessed by healthcare providers and the relevant authorities. Less than 20% in each country were comfortable sharing their identity or location with a publicly available app, the survey revealed.</p>
<p>But while respondents were hesitant to share their personal data, the majority would want to be informed if someone in their neighbourhood tested positive, including 82% in Singapore, 80% in the US, and 69% in Germany. A majority across the board also would want to know if someone at their workplace or school had tested positive.</p>
<p>Oliver Wyman Forum COO Ana Kreacic said: &ldquo;The fight against COVID-19 raises fundamental questions about personal data and privacy. While people are hungry for information about the pandemic and cases of infection near them, most only support sharing their personal health data to a limited extent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Countries such as China and South Korea are using mobile location tracking technology as part of efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19, while mobile operators in Germany, Italy, and Austria are sharing anonymised mobile location data with authorities and app developers to determine if people are complying with social distancing measures. Australia, too, is assessing what Singapore has done with its Bluetooth-based contact tracing app and has expressed interest in using the code to develop its own version.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Apple and Google last week announced plans to jointly develop contact tracing technology for government health agencies via the use of Bluetooth technology, tapping mobile location data to track the spread and identify potential coronavirus hotspots.</p>
<p>Such tracking efforts and the use of digital surveillance technology, however, have triggered privacy concerns, with international civil society organisations urging governments to observe human rights laws when tapping technology to contain the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>While individuals might be uncomfortable with sharing location data via their mobile phones, as revealed in the study, this could change as the pandemic advances, said Oliver Wyman&rsquo;s Asia-Pacific managing director Jacob Hook. &ldquo;These consumer attitudes may shift, particularly if the data used is focused solely at the effort to fight the pandemic,&rdquo; Hook said.</p>
<p>Singapore last month said it would make its contact tracing app open source so that &ldquo;others may deploy their own flavours&rdquo; of the app, which it called TraceTogether. It had since made the protocol, dubbed BlueTrace, and the OpenTrace reference implementation available on GitHub. Some 1 million users have downloaded the TraceTogether app since it was launched.</p>
