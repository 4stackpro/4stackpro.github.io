<h1 id="how-to-watch-dave-online---live-stream-season-1--technadu">How to Watch &lsquo;Dave&rsquo; Online - Live Stream Season 1 | TechNadu</h1>
<p><img src="https://cdn.technadu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Dave-696x392.png" alt="Dave" title="Dave"></p>
<p>via FXX</p>
<p>There’s a new show heading for FXX in March, and we are super excited to watch this comedy. Furthermore, we plan to watch Dave online, so let’s figure out how you can do this as well.</p>
<p>The show is produced by Kevin Hart, the well-known funny-man. The show is called Dave after the main actor, actually known as rapper Lil Dicky. Of course, he’s not just a rapper, but he’s also a comedian, as you may have noticed if you’ve ever had watched one of his videos.</p>
<p>Other people who will appear in this show are Taylor Misak, Andrew Santino, GaTa, Travis Bennett, and Christine Ko. The show will follow a neurotic suburban man in his late 20s who is convinced he’s going to become one of the best rappers in the world. As he tries to get help from his friends, he may even be able to convince the rest of the world that he really can do this.</p>
<h3 id="when-and-where-to-watch-dave">When and Where to Watch Dave?</h3>
<p>Dave will premiere on <strong>FXX</strong> on <strong>March 4th</strong>, and we’ll get to watch new episodes at <strong>10 PM</strong>. It is not yet clear exactly how many episodes of the show will have, so we will have to wait it out until more information is shared.</p>
<h3 id="how-can-i-live-stream-dave">How Can I Live Stream Dave?</h3>
<p>In the past few years, we have become able to watch even more content than we were, as we stay online, spending hours upon hours keeping ourselves entertained with various shows and movies. The Internet makes our lives that much easier as it enables us to carry the content we love with us no matter where we travel. One of the best platforms that will help you watch Dave on FXX is <a href="https://www.technadu.com/go/hululivetv/">Hulu</a>, which has a really cool single bundle available. The platform features countless networks that you will be able to check out anywhere you travel. <a href="https://www.technadu.com/go/hululivetv/">Start your 7-day free trial on Hulu now</a>!</p>
<p>If you want even more content, then you can add any of the available channel packs, as well as various premium networks they have available. We should also mention that Live TV subscribers on Hulu get to enjoy everything available on-demand on the service, so you’ll get a lot more content to consume. a wide range of devices, including iOS and Android phones and tablets, Apple TV, Android TV, Fire TV, Chromecast, Roku, and more. (<em><strong>Note</strong>: Hulu is a service that only works in select markets, so if you want to enjoy the content anywhere you travel, you will need to use a VPN as soon as you leave the country. You can <a href="#OutsideUS">click here</a> to find out more details about all the steps you need to take.</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Here’s how you can start your 7-day free trial of Hulu:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You have to start by visiting the Live TV site of Hulu’s webpage and tap on the “<a href="https://www.technadu.com/go/hululivetv/">Start free trial</a>” button.</li>
<li>You will get redirected to a new page where you have to provide your personal information, such as your name and email address, along with a password.</li>
<li>Then, you have to start building up your subscription by choosing the Live TV plan and any channel packs or premium networks that appeal to you.</li>
<li>They also need your card information so they can bill you when the free trial is complete.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-ways-to-watch-dave">Other Ways to Watch Dave</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.technadu.com/go/fubotv/"><strong>fuboTV</strong></a> – Another platform that can help you watch Dave is fuboTV, which has a single bundle of networks available. <a href="https://www.technadu.com/go/fubotv/">Start your 7-day free trial on fuboTV now</a>!

<h3 id="how-can-i-watch-dave-when-traveling-outside-of-the-united-states">How Can I Watch Dave When Traveling Outside of the United States?</h3>
<p>The problem with watching content when you travel abroad is that live TV platforms and streaming services are geo-blocked. What this means is that as soon as your IP reflects that you are no longer in the United States, you will get blocked. This happens because all these companies have to respect their contract that clearly states where they are allowed to broadcast content, which in most cases is strictly the United States.</p>
<p>The solution to this situation is to change your IP address so that you appear to be in the United States rather than wherever you travel to. This can be done in mere moments with the <a href="https://www.technadu.com/go/expressvpn/">help of a VPN</a>. If you don’t know which VPN to use, we can recommend <a href="https://www.technadu.com/go/expressvpn/">ExpressVPN</a>, which has thousands of servers all over the world and some really great privacy features to help those who use it to remain anonymous.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s how you can use ExpressVPN to watch Dave:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You have to start this journey by visiting the ExpressVPN website and <a href="https://www.technadu.com/go/expressvpn/">subscribing to the service (49% OFF)</a>. The whole process should go by pretty quickly, and then you’ll be able to use the app and the service anytime you need it. ExpressVPN has a 30-day money-back guarantee policy, so keep in mind that it is possible to ask for a refund if there are any issues with your account.</li>
<li>Download the app for your device and run the installer. Launch the tool and log in to your account whenever possible to get things going.</li>
<li>Look for a server that is located in the United States and connect to it.</li>
<li>The app will tell you when the connection has been established, and you can go ahead and load Hulu so you can watch Dave.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="can-i-watch-dave-on-the-website-of-the-network">Can I Watch Dave on the Website of the Network?</h3>
<p>Watching Dave on the FXX website is something that you can do rather easily, considering the fact that there is a live stream available there. In order to access the live stream, you will have to log into an account for which will need credentials from your TV provider. The TV provider can be a live TV service or a cable company, depending on whether or not you’ve cut the cord yet. (<em><strong>Note</strong>: The FXX live stream is geo-blocked, so if you’re going to travel abroad, you need to keep in mind that you will need a VPN to watch anything. You can <a href="#OutsideUS">click here</a> to find out all the details you need to know about this.</em>)</p>
<h3 id="can-i-binge-watch-dave">Can I Binge-watch Dave?</h3>
<p>Watching the brand new episodes from Dave is possible to do at any time, due to the fact that they will become available on the FXX website. Basically, you will be able to stream the episodes whenever you feel like it once they have been on TV. We should also mention here that Dave will also be available to watch on Hulu soon after the episode airs live. So if you have an on-demand subscription on Hulu, you’ll be able to enjoy the show.</p>
<h3 id="can-i-purchase-episodes-from-dave">Can I Purchase Episodes From Dave?</h3>
<p>Watching episodes from Dave will also be possible by buying them from cool services that permit this. For instance, you should be able to buy episodes from the show on platforms like Google Play, YouTube, iTunes, Microsoft Store, Amazon Prime, and Vudu.
