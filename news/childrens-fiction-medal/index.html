<p>Understanding Race and Anti-Racism</p>

<p>by Tiffany Rose (Little Bee Books, 2019, $17.99, 9781499809169, ages 3-6)</p>
<p>This A–Z affirmation of Black children presents each letter in different bold design, while the text works to inspire confidence and pride: “Be you. Love you. Always. All ways.” References to Black leaders—Obama (“Our first black president”) and Malcolm X (“Activist. Leader. Revolutionary”)—occur alongside calls for children to define and be themselves, and to “SPEAK OUT for what is right./SPEAK UP when others are silent.” See our full review.</p>
<p>Brown Girl Dreaming</p>
<p>by Jacqueline Woodson (Penguin/Paulsen, 2014, $17.99, 9780399252518, ages 10 and up)</p>

<p>by Jason Reynolds and Ibram X. Kendi (Little, Brown, Mar. 10, $18.99, 9780316453691, ages 12 and up)</p>
<p>Reynolds lends his signature flair to remixing Kendi’s award-winning Stamped from the Beginning into a powerful “not a history book” primer on the historical roots and present-day manifestations of antiblack racism in America. In five sections, Reynolds discusses the influential figures, movements, and events that have propagated racist ideas, beginning in 1415 with the publication of the infamous work that laid the groundwork for subsequent religious justifications of enslaving African peoples and continuing through the “war on drugs” and #BlackLivesMatter. See our full starred review.</p>

<p>by George M. Johnson (FSG, Apr. 28, $17.99, 9780374312718, ages 14 and up)</p>
<p>Johnson’s debut is a collection of heartfelt personal essays revolving around themes of identity and family and his experience growing up Black and queer in New Jersey and Virginia.

<p>Fiction</p>
<p>Don’t Touch My Hair</p>
<p>by Sharee Miller (Little, Brown, 2018, $17.99, 9780316562584, ages 4-8)</p>
<p>African American Aria is proud of her showstopping hair “that grows up toward the sun like a flower.” But people keep confusing admiration with acquiescence: strangers, she laments, “are so curious about my hair that they try to touch it without even asking for permission!” It feels like the entire universe has lost its sense of boundaries. Then she resolves to set limits, and, in speaking up for herself, she begins to feel free, respected, and in charge of her own body again. See our full starred review.</p>
<p>New Kid</p>
<p>by Jerry Craft (HarperCollins/Quill Tree, 2019, $21.99, 9780062691200, ages 8-12)</p>
<p>In this Newbery-winning graphic novel, African American new kid Jordan Banks would rather go to art school, but his parents have enrolled him at the rigorous Riverdale Academy Day School, so he dutifully commutes to the Bronx from his home in Washington Heights, Manhattan. When he’s not being confused with the few other students of color, he is spoken to in slang, receives looks when financial aid is mentioned, or is forced to navigate many more micro-aggressions. This story captures the tensions that come with being a person of color in a traditionally white space. See our full starred review.</p>
<p>The Only Black Girls in Town</p>

<p>In this middle grade novel, Rhodes tells the story of two biracial brothers, Donte and Trey, navigating racism, colorism, and bullying. This novel offers relatable, three-dimensional characters considering identity, who will teach readers about colorism’s effects. See our full review.</p>
<p>Blended</p>
<p>by Sharon M. Draper (Atheneum/Dlouhy, 2018, $16.99, 9781442495005, ages 8-12)</p>
<p>After her parents’ divorce, competitive pianist Isabella, 11, divides her time between her white diner-waitress mother and her wealthy Black father. When a history class discussion about student protests and the history of lynching ends with a noose being placed in a black classmate’s locker, Isabella’s awareness of racist behavior skyrockets, as does her need to define who she is for herself. Draper (Out of My Mind) doesn’t shy away from challenging or uncomfortable topics; police aggression, gun violence, the complicated nature of divorce, and socioeconomic imbalances are all candidly addressed as real and important parts of Isabella’s experience. See our full starred review and Draper’s conversation about the book with Jason Reynolds.</p>
<p>For Black Girls Like Me</p>
<p>by Mariama J. Lockington (FSG, 2019, $16.99, 9780374308049, ages 9-11)</p>
<p>In this middle grade debut (told without commas in a mix of narration, letters, and poetry), Lockington introduces budding poet Makeda Kirkland, 11, a Black girl adopted by a white family. With intimate authenticity, she explores how fierce but “colorblind” familial love can result in erasure and sensitively delineates the pain of facing casual racism, as well as the disconcerting experience of being the child of a mentally ill parent. See our full starred review.</p>
<p>Genesis Begins Again</p>
<p>by Alicia D. Williams (Atheneum/Dlouhy, 2019, $17.99, 9781481465809, ages 9-13)</p>
<p>Forced to start over time and again because of a series of evictions, Genesis Anderson has a dearth of self-confidence (and a list of 96 reasons that she hates herself), and trouble making new friends. That slowly begins to change when her African American family moves to an upscale white suburb, and Genesis begins questioning the colorism that has seeped into her own psyche. See our full starred review.</p>
<p>What Lane?</p>
<p>by Torrey Maldonado (Penguin/Paulsen, Apr. 14, $16.99, 9780525518433, ages 10 and up)</p>
<p>Sixth grader Stephen is growing up in Brooklyn; he loves “superheroes, fantasy, sci-fi” and basketball, as well as hanging out with his best friend Dan, the same as he always has. But though his white mother calls him “mixed,” since he’s half Black and half white, Stephen’s beginning to realize the world now sees him as “what they imagine or what the media teaches them to think about Black men.” In relatively few words, Maldonado elucidates matters related to racial profiling, police violence against Black people, and allyship. See our full starred review.</p>
<p>Ghost Boys</p>
<p>by Jewell Parker Rhodes (Little, Brown, 2018, $16.99, 9780316262286, ages 10 and up)</p>
<p>In this novel from Rhodes, Jerome Rogers, a Black 12-year-old, is playing outside in his Chicago neighborhood with a toy gun when he is shot and killed by a white policeman who views him as a threat.

<p>Long Way Down</p>
<p>by Jason Reynolds (Atheneum/Dlouhy, 2017, $18.99, 9781481438254, ages 12 and up)</p>
<p>In this award-winning novel in verse by Reynolds, Will, 15, is following his neighborhood’s well-established rules—don’t cry, don’t snitch, but do get revenge “if someone you love/ gets killed”—when he leaves his apartment, intent on killing whoever murdered his older brother, emboldened by the gun tucked into his waistband. As Will makes his way to the ground floor of his building, the elevator stops to accept passengers, each an important figure from his past, all victims of gun violence. Are these ghosts? Or is it Will’s subconscious at work, forcing him to think about what he intends to do and what it will accomplish? See our full starred review.</p>
<p>Piecing Me Together</p>
<p>by Renée Watson (Bloomsbury, 2017, $17.99, 9781681191058, ages 12 and up)</p>
<p>In Watson&rsquo;s award-winning novel, Jade Butler, an African American artist-in-the-making, lives with her mother in Portland, Ore., and travels by bus to private school, where she is both grateful for and resentful of the opportunities presented to her. Jade’s narrative voice offers compelling reflections on the complexities of race and gender, class and privilege, and fear and courage, while conveying the conflicted emotions of an ambitious, loyal girl. See our full starred review.</p>
<p>All American Boys</p>
<p>by Jason Reynolds and Brendan Kiely (Atheneum/Dlouhy, 2015, $19.99, 9781481463331, ages 12 and up)</p>
<p>In this collaborative book, two authors—one Black, one white—present a story of police brutality: Reynolds voices Rashad, the innocent victim of a police beating; Kiely writes Quinn, a horrified witness. The book moves quickly, starting on a Friday night with the boys—classmates who don&rsquo;t know each other—preparing for a party, and ending with a social-media-inspired protest march one week later. The scenario that Reynolds and Kiely depict is as timely as ever. See our full starred review.</p>
<p>Monday’s Not Coming</p>
<p>by Tiffany Jackson (HarperCollins/Tegen, 2018, $17.99, 9780062422675, ages 13 and up)</p>
<p>Jackson’s sophomore novel, following 2017’s acclaimed Allegedly, features another ripped-from-the-headlines premise that will keep readers guessing through the final pages. After a summer in Georgia with her grandmother, Claudia returns to Washington, D.C., ready to take on eighth grade with her best friend, Monday, even though Monday didn’t respond to any of Claudia’s letters. Claudia soon finds, though, that Monday is gone. Jackson’s characters and their heartwrenching story linger long after the final page, urging readers to advocate for those who are disenfranchised and forgotten by society and the system. See our full starred review.</p>
<p>Black Girl Unlimited: The Remarkable Story of a Teenage Wizard</p>
<p>by Echo Brown (Henry Holt, Jan. 14, $17.99, 9781250309853, ages 14+)</p>
<p>Echo is a Black teen growing up on Cleveland’s East Side, where adults worship the “white rock,” and she is learning how to control her newfound powers as a “quantum wizard.” Using wizardry as a way to explore making something out of nothing and developing the skills it takes to survive traumatic events, Brown’s novel gives readers a potent glimpse into heartbreaking, unjust experiences and profound resilience in the face of wrongs perpetrated both systemically and interpersonally. The novel never shies from tough subject matter, as it deftly integrates magically realistic components and allegory into contemporary scenes. See our full review.</p>
<p>Who Put This Song On?</p>
<p>by Morgan Parker (Delacorte, 2019, $18.99, 9780525707516, ages 14 and up)</p>
<p>Set against the backdrop of the 2008 presidential election, this novel stars 17-year-old Morgan Parker, a self-proclaimed “super-emo” kid living with anxiety and depression in Southern California and one of the only Black kids at her conservative Christian school. After regularly experiencing racist microaggressions from her teachers and peers and a devastating event the previous summer landed her in therapy and on antidepressants, Morgan is determined to “get happy” and learn to love herself and her Blackness, whatever it takes. See our full starred review.</p>
<p>Tyler Johnson Was Here</p>
<p>by Jay Coles (Little, Brown, 2018, $17.99, 9780316440776, ages 14 and up)</p>
<p>Cole’s debut novel, based on events in his own life, follows Marvin Johnson, a college-bound senior in Alabama. From the opening pages, Marvin and his twin brother, Tyler, navigate racism, drug dealers, and police violence, their lives governed by the “talk that all decent black mothers and fathers give to their children at least once a month. The You-Live-in-a-White-Man’s-World-So-Be-Careful talk.” A distressing yet empowering portrait of a Black teenager confronting relentless racism, brutality, and tragedy. See our full review.</p>
<p>Dear Martin</p>
<p>by Nic Stone (Crown, 2017, $17.99, 9781101939499, ages 14 and up)</p>
<p>Written as a mixture of script-style dialogues, third-person narrative, and letters to Martin Luther King Jr., Stone’s debut novel is a portrait of a young man reckoning with the ugly, persistent violence of social injustice. After nearly getting arrested while trying to help his white ex-girlfriend, who’s “stone drunk” and trying to drive herself home, high school senior Justyce McAllister confronts racism and racial profiling while searching for identity at a prestigious prep school, where he is one of only eight Black students. Pushed to the brink of despair when a close friend is shot by a white off-duty police officer, Justyce doesn’t know what to do with his anger. See our full review.</p>
<p>How It Went Down</p>
<p>by Kekla Magoon (Henry Holt, 2014, $18.99, 9780805098693, ages 14 and up)</p>
<p>Set in a neighborhood ruled by gangs, this novel offers multiple, contradictory perspectives on the shooting of an African American youth. No one disputes that 16-year-old Tariq Johnson was shot on the street by Jack Franklin, a white gang member, but the motives of both killer and victim remain fuzzy, as do the circumstances surrounding the shooting. Through a resonant chorus of voices, Magoon masterfully captures the cycle of urban violence and the raw emotions of the young people who can’t escape its impact. See our full starred review.</p>
<p>Raise Your Voice: Activism and Protest</p>
<p>Nonfiction</p>
<p>A Is for Activist</p>
<p>by Innosanto Nagara (Triangle Square, 2012, $11.95, 9781609805395, ages 3-7)</p>
<p>This ABC board book is written for families who want their kids to grow up in a space that is unapologetic about activism, environmental justice, civil rights, LGBTQ rights, and more. Alliteration, rhyming, and bright colors appeal to young readers, while the issues it brings up will resonate with parents’ values of community, equality, and justice.</p>
<p>Counting on Community</p>
<p>by Innosanto Nagara (Triangle Square, 2015, $11.95, 9781609806323, ages 3-7)</p>
<p>Building on the success of A Is for Activist, this counting book celebrates active communities, devoting pages to everything from urban farming and chalk drawing to potlucks and protests. Digital collages and woodgrain-style textures lend an organic feel to the images, while radiating lines in the backgrounds emphasize the idea that close-knit communities have real power.

<p>The Oldest Student: How Mary Walker Learned to Read</p>
<p>by Rita Lorraine-Hubbard, illus. by Oge Mora (Random House, Jan. 7, $17.99, 9781524768287, ages 4-8)</p>
<p>Mary Walker, born enslaved in 1848 Alabama, knew the first rule of her plantation (“Keep working!”) and the second: “Slaves should not be taught to read or write.” When she was 114 and had outlived her entire family, she entered a reading class, practiced writing until “pages and letters and words swirled in her head,” and at last achieved her goal. Walker’s determination and her long, long life—she died at 121—offer genuine inspiration. See our full starred review.</p>
<p>What Do You Do with a Voice Like That?: The Story of Extraordinary Congresswoman Barbara Jordan by Chris Barton, illus. by Ekua Holmes (S&amp;S/Beach Lane, 2018, $18.99, 9781481465618, ages 4-8)</p>
<p>This celebration of Congresswoman Barbara Jordan follows her as a child growing up in the Fifth Ward in Houston, where she commanded attention through her powerful voice, and tells how her intellectual curiosity and desire to be civically engaged led her to become a lawyer, then a politician, “to make change from within.” See our full review.</p>
<p>We March</p>
<p>by Shane W. Evans (Roaring Brook, 2012, $17.99, 9781596435391, ages 4-8)</p>
<p>This account of the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom—identified only in a concluding note—drives home the emotion and the drama of that event. Evans spotlights a family of four, joining the march that culminates in Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech. Though the day unfolds through the family’s perspective, what emerges is a communal voice that conveys a strong sense of solidarity and purpose. See our full review.</p>
<p>Sit-In: How Four Friends Stood Up by Sitting Down</p>
<p>by Andrea Davis Pinkney, illus. by Brian Pinkney (Little, Brown, 2010, $18.99, 9780316070164, ages 6 and up)</p>
<p>In this collaboration, the Pinkneys recreate the renowned 1960 sit-in staged by four Black college students at a Greensboro “whites only” lunch counter. The narrative incorporates a steady stream of food metaphors, noting that the students ignored the law’s “recipe” for segregation (“a bitter mix”) replacing it the “new brew” of integration. A civil rights timeline and additional facts and suggested reading about the topic round out this account. See our full review.</p>

<p>In this sensitive story based on African American educator and activist Clara Luper, who, in 1958, organized students to take part in a lunch counter sit-in in Oklahoma City, Rhuday-Perkovich depicts Luper’s early awakening to racial inequity that led her to channel her energies into teaching Black children about history and the power of nonviolent demonstration. An authentic tribute to a brave and compassionate activist. See our full review.</p>

<p>by Kwame Alexander, illus. by Kadir Nelson (HMH/Versify, 2019, $17.99, 9781328780966, ages 6-9)</p>
<p>An anthem to the courage and genius of Black Americans, the figures featured in this Caldecott-winning volume are not just well-known; Alexander writes about nameless heroes and unsung martyrs. Acknowledging deep wounds, repeating the phrase “This is for the unspeakable” over successive portraits of infamous atrocities committed against Americans of African descent and remembering peaceful civil rights activists, Alexander communicates clearly that when Black lives matter, America is stronger.

<p>by Barry Wittenstein, illus. by Jerry Pinkney (Holiday House/Porter, 2019, $18.99, 9780823443314, ages 7-10)</p>
<p>Wittenstein and Pinkney come together for a deep dive into the speech that galvanized the 1963 March on Washington. The book stars not only Martin Luther King Jr. but also the colleagues whose support was crucial to him, showing that historical moments—and movements—are not inevitable; they’re shaped and changed by many hands and voices. In emphatic phrases and art alternatingly warm and tense, the creators’ portrait of the civil rights leader in consultation with others is an invaluable addition to the shelf of King biographies.

<p>by Jo Ann Allen Boyce and Debbie Levy (Bloomsbury, 2019, $17.99, 9781681198521, ages 10-12)</p>
<p>Boyce, one of 12 Black students who integrated Clinton, Tenn.’s public high school in August 1956, following racial desegregation, relays the story of that harrowing experience in verse. Addressing the duplicity of the court-ordered integration, Boyce poignantly describes the cruelty of white students, while never losing hope in the belief that racial equality is attainable and that she can help make it happen.

<p>by Zetta Elliott, illus. by Loveis Wise (Little, Brown, Jan. 14, $18.99, 9781368045247, ages 12 and up)</p>

<p>Woke Baby</p>
<p>by Mahogany L. Browne, illus, by Theodore Taylor III (Roaring Brook, 2018, $7.99, 9781250308986, ages up to 3)</p>

<p>Following an introduction that defines what it means to be woke, Browne’s poems combine clear declarations with easy-to-grasp metaphors to convey progressive values. Privilege is compared to a toolbox (“We can choose/ to use it to help people who don’t have what we do”) and gender to a rainbow (“There are so many shades between boy and girl”). With its references to figures such as Janet Mock and Trayvon Martin, this volume is a useful conversation-starter. See our full review.</p>

<p>Twelve-year-old Shay’s palms itch when she senses trouble coming, and this year, they seem to be itching more than ever.

<p>In this story of the 1968 Memphis sanitation strike, triggered after two Black sanitation workers died when their poorly maintained truck malfunctioned, Duncan writes in fervent free verse from the perspective of Lorraine Jackson, a fictional girl whose father joins the strike and who is loosely based on Almella Starks-Umoja, a teacher who marched in strike protests with her parents as a child.

<p>The Hate U Give</p>
<p>by Angie Thomas (HarperCollins/Balzer + Bray, 2017, $18.99, 9780062498533, ages 14 and up)</p>
<p>At home in a neighborhood riven with gang strife, Starr Carter, 16, is both the grocer’s daughter and an outsider, because she attends private school many miles away. At Williamson Prep, where she’s among a handful of Black students, she can’t be herself either: no slang, no anger, no attitude. Already wrestling with what Du Bois called “double consciousness,” she accepts a ride home from Khalil, a childhood friend, who is then pulled over and shot dead by a white cop. Thomas authentically depicts a teenage girl, her loving family, and her attempts to reconcile what she knows to be true about their lives with the way those lives are represented—and completely undervalued—by society at large.

<p>by Derrick Barnes, illus. by Gordon C. Jones (Bolden/Milner, 2017, $18.95, 9781572842243, ages 3-8)</p>
<p>How good can a haircut make a person feel? In this powerfully moving tribute to barbershop culture, Barnes addresses readers directly—and it’s safe to say his audience is primarily boys of color—using hyperbole to boost their confidence and help them recognize their own value. Pride, confidence, and joy radiate from the pages, both in the Black and brown faces of men, women, boys, and girls featured in James’s paintings, and in writing that celebrates human worth with every syllable.

<p>You Matter</p>
<p>by Christian Robinson (Atheneum, June 2, $17.99, 9781534421691, ages 4-8)</p>
<p>Simple and heartfelt, the refrain of Caldecott Honoree Robinson’s poem speaks directly to readers: “You matter.” In a neat rhetorical twist, the line also refers to the Earth itself, whose evolutionary history flashes by in gently comic collages made with blocky forms and bold paint strokes, human concerns receding in geological time, then coming into focus as a brown-skinned astronaut orbits Earth while holding a photo of a child. A page turn shows the child back on Earth looking wistfully out an apartment window: “Sometimes, someone you love says goodbye.” Robinson represents life as both interconnected and precious.

Ranging from a few lines to the length of a page, the poems are matched with bright, textured, mixed-media illustrations featuring a variety of girls—curly and straight haired, ethnically diverse, blemish-dotted, glasses-wearing, spunky, shy, lonely, and empowered—in highly relatable moments.

<p>by Lupita Nyong’o, illus. by Vashti Harrison (Simon &amp; Schuster, 2019, $17.99, 9781534425361, ages 4-8)</p>
<p>In this picture book by Academy Award-winning actor Nyong’o, when Sulwe’s schoolmates call her names, she endeavors to lighten her skin, and even her mother’s wisdom cannot convince her of her inherent worth. A nested fable shows Sulwe what happens when Night and Day, two magnificent sisters, react to peoples’ initial preference for Day’s light. By turns beguiling and magical, this volume clearly conveys the pain of colorism, confronting it head-on. See our full starred review.</p>
<p>Hair Love</p>
<p>by Matthew A. Cherry, illus. by Vashti Harrison (Kokila, 2019, $17.99, 9780525553366, ages 4-8)</p>
<p>Based on Cherry’s animated short film of the same title, this picture book is about Zuri, a Black girl who is proud of her hair, which “kinks, coils, and curls every which way.” In need of a spectacular coif on a special day, her devoted father tackles the task, at first underestimating the challenge, then rallying to save the day. A bighearted ode to individuality and father-daughter collaboration. See our full review.</p>
<p>Hands Up!</p>
<p>by Breanna J. McDaniel, illus. by Shane W. Evans (Dial, 2019, $17.99, 9780525552314, ages 4-8)</p>
<p>A brown-skinned girl’s day begins with a stretch to “greet the sun, bold and bright,” and additional hands-up motions follow as she lifts her hands to let her parents pull on her shirt, enthusiastically gestures to her teacher (“Please pick me, Ms. B!”), reaches for a book on a high shelf, lifts hands “in praise and worship,” and jumps to score during a basketball game—and then triumphantly raises a trophy above her head. An uplifting celebration of advocating for oneself, aiding those in need, and connecting with community. See our full review.</p>

<p>by Patricia C. McKissack, illus. by April Harrison (Random House, 2018, $17.99, 9780375836152, ages 4-8)</p>
<p>James Otis and his mother don’t have much. Daddy died last April and the family farm is gone, so the two of them now live in a “run-down shotgun house” that floods when it rains, but when their pastor asks the congregation to help a family who lost everything in a fire, Mama does her part, sewing an apron made from her cherished white tablecloth, and expects James to find “a li’l bit of something” for the girl, Sarah. After giving it much thought, he creates a book for and about Sarah herself—a gift the girl presses to her heart. See our full starred review.</p>

<p>by Roda Ahmed, illus. by Stasia Burrington (HarperCollins, 2017, $17.99, 9780062651730, ages 4-8)</p>
<p>Ahmed’s first children’s book presents a fictional portrait of a young Mae Jemison, whose parents support her dream of becoming an astronaut; their advice (“If you can dream it, if you believe it and work hard for it, anything is possible”) becomes the book’s refrain. An afterword provides some details about Jemison’s career and various firsts she accomplished, including becoming the first African American woman in space. See our full review.</p>
<p>Hey Black Child</p>
<p>by Useni Eugene Perkins, illus. by Bryan Collier (Little, Brown, 2017, $18.99, 9780316360302, ages 4-8)</p>
<p>Perkins’s 1975 poem features compact, rhythmic language that’s both avuncular and commandingly rhetorical (“Hey Black Child/ Do you know who you are/ Who you really are”). Each stanza begins with a close, almost photorealistic portrait of a confident, happy child, with subsequent pages showing how the child’s passion, coupled with a proud sense of heritage, leads him or her to become someone who helps make “your nation/ what you want it to be.” See our full starred review.</p>

<p>Ava’s mother works six days a week, so Saturday, their only day together, “was the day they cherished,” but, despite a practiced plan and tickets to a “one-night-only puppet show,” this one isn’t going particularly well. But they face each setback the same way: “They paused, closed their eyes, and—whew!—let out a deep breath,” then Ava’s mother reassures her that “today will be special. Today will be splendid. Today is SATURDAY!” Carefully paced repetition structures the family’s experiences, and brilliantly colored collages by Mora convey their trip through the city with elegant energy.

<p>After being bullied by classmates about her unruly hair, Mackenzie seeks guidance from her wise and comforting neighbor, Miss Tillie.

<p>by Jacqueline Woodson, illus. by Rafael López (Penguin/Paulsen, 2018, $18.99, 9780399246531, ages 5-8)</p>
<p>In this picture book, former National Ambassador for Young People’s Literature Woodson imagines being “an only” in the classroom—what it’s like to be the only one with an accent (“No one understands the way words curl from your mouth”), the only one who stayed home during summer vacation (“What good is this/ when other students were flying/ and sailing”), the only one whose lunch box is filled with food “too strange or too unfamiliar for others to love as you do.” Without prescribing sympathy, Woodson’s poetic lines give power to each child’s experience.

<p>In this series opener, a loose reimagining of Ramona Quimby’s exploits, Watson adroitly captures the uncertainty of growing up amid change through the eyes of an irrepressible Black girl. In vignette-style chapters, Watson warmly weaves together slice-of-life moments that capture youthful doubt alongside moments of loss and joy, showing a tight-knit family navigating difficulties with plenty of courage and plenty of love. Occasional illustrations by Mata (She’s Got This) emphasize the story’s vibrant realism. See our full starred review and Watson’s essay on “Holding On to Sunshine” in difficult times.</p>

When no one claims the jackpot after several days, Rico enlists classmate Zan Macklin, a wealthy computer whiz, to help her track down the customer.

<h3 id="these-books-can-help-you-explain-racism-and-protest-to-your-kids">&ldquo;These Books Can Help You Explain Racism and Protest to Your Kids&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/02/multimedia/2parenting-reading-list/2parenting-reading-list-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
Dr. Collins gave the example of a white child asking why another child had brown skin. A parent can take this opportunity to explain what melanin is, and to talk about how wonderful it is that the world has so many different kinds of people.</p>
<p>Older children will be much more aware of what’s going on right now. So find out how much your child knows about the protests, Dr. Harris-Smith said, because kids may know more than we think they do from overhearing the news, their parents talking, or simply noticing what is going on outside in their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Once you assess what they know, you can have a conversation about the violence against black people without being too explicit with elementary-age children.</p>
<p>Dr. Dougé suggested starting with something like: “There are things happening in the news that are upsetting us. Unfortunately there were police officers that made bad choices for the wrong reasons because of the color of our skin.” Dr. Collins said that with children in elementary school, you should focus on how unfairly black and brown people have been treated throughout American history to the present day, because fairness is something all children can understand.</p>
<p>If you live someplace where people are actively protesting and your children have observed some destruction, “First and foremost, reassure them you’re there to keep them safe,” Dr. Dougé said. But also explain why people are protesting, and show them positive images of protesting now and from history, she suggested.

Studies from Harvard University suggest that children as young as three years old, when exposed to racism and prejudice, tended to embrace and accept it, even though they might not entirely understand what they were feeling.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re struggling with how to open up about these challenging subjects or clarify confusing times for the young people in your life, books are a great way to begin to tackle tough topics and expose children to different narratives. With that in mind, we&rsquo;ve put together a list of stories for all ages that not only discuss race, but also celebrate diversity and the differences that make us special, to help begin these crucial conversations. From babies to young adults, try gifting your child one of these important narratives.</p>
<p>Consider buying your books from one of these Black-owned bookstores.

Nathan Hale’s Hazardous Tales, by Nathan Hale</p>
<p>I often get the very same question from parents across the country: “My son is 10 (or 9, or 11) and I can’t find anything he wants to read these days.” I always answer the very same way: “Have you tried ‘Nathan Hale’s Hazardous Tales’”? These books are, quite simply, brilliant. They worked like magic when my first son turned 9 and began to get restless with the usual novelistic fare offered to kids that age. The author/illustrator — whose real name is Nathan Hale, like the Revolutionary War hero — channels his historical namesake to tell thrilling, bloody, action-packed stories from American history. The conceit is this: It’s the night before Hale is going to be hanged by the British for being a spy, and he is able to see ahead into the whole of the history of the nation he is giving his life for. He gathers the other prisoners in his jail cell to tell about the Underground Railroad, the Alamo, the Donner Party — my son’s favorite — World War I, and more. Of course, there are lots of other great books for history loving, visually oriented 9-year-olds. But Nathan Hale should be your first stop.</p>
<p>‘Becoming RBG: Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s Journey to Justice,’ by Debbie Levy. Illustrated by Whitney Gardner.</p>
<p>The inspirational life of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is already the subject of several excellent picture books, but this graphic biography is packed with artfully presented details that flesh out a fuller picture of RBG. The author conducted interviews with the Justice herself, and she also includes documents such as a column Ginsburg wrote for her middle school newspaper on the United Nations Charter and a bit in her synagogue newsletter about building community after the Holocaust. We see young Ruth standing her ground when a teacher tells her she has to write with her right hand — she is a proud lefty. When another tells her not to sing in choir because she can’t carry a tune, she turns to piano lessons instead. When Ruth gets to law school and into her legal career, Levy makes the concepts easily understood, and Gardner’s lovely images move the story along too.</p>
<p>Science Comics</p>
<p>Rocks and minerals, the digestive system, crows, skyscrapers, wild weather: This series — written by a handful of authors — seems determined to offer a useful introduction to anything a curious grade-school student might wonder about. The insight behind these books is a powerful one. So much information about the world around us is actually better conveyed visually, through charts, illustrations and sequential panels, than purely using words. (Imagine if the directions for putting together your new Ikea bed came only in words.) That’s not to say the words aren’t helpful, too — with their peppy tone and dashes of humor, they add to the package. But it’s the clear, attractive visuals that will keep your kid turning the pages.

<h3 id="graphic-novels-your-kid-probably-hasnt-read-yet">&ldquo;Graphic Novels Your Kid (Probably) Hasn’t Read Yet&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/21/books/00Storytimes-Graphic-Novels-Kids-Havent-Read-Yet/00Storytimes-Graphic-Novels-Kids-Havent-Read-Yet-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
Roar! Crash! Those noises you heard when Jerry Craft’s graphic novel “New Kid” won the 2020 Newbery Medal were the approval of hordes of happy readers, young and old. “New Kid” — the story of Jordan Banks, an African-American boy who’s one of few students of color at a private school — is terrific. Our reviewer, Victoria Jamieson, called it “a gift to readers who love the genre.”</p>
<p>The crashing sound? That was yet another barrier tumbling down in children’s publishing. For years, graphic novels were not considered “real” books. Many parents and educators still hold to this outdated notion. Perhaps it’s because graphic novels are cousins of that unfairly maligned bugaboo of mid-20th-century parents and librarians — comic books. Yet there is definitive research showing that reading books that combine images and text is as cognitively challenging as text-only reading. Every child’s brain is wired differently, and some kids are more “visual readers,” who struggle with large chunks of text but can more easily access information and storytelling through a balance of words and illustration.</p>
<p>Hurray, then, for the Caldecott Committee, who realized it was time to consider graphic novels as literature, pure and simple.</p>
<p>But there is an actual problem with kids’ graphic novels: There are not enough of them. That’s because the process is laborious — it takes a long time to map out and ink a 200-page book, then longer to add color — and the appetite for graphic books is large and ever-growing. Many avid readers between the ages of 7 and 12 have already gone through the Captain Underpants, Dog Man and Wimpy Kid books, everything by Raina Telgemeier, Shannon Hale and LeUyen Pham’s “Real Friends” and “Best Friends,” the Dork Diaries and the 13-Story Treehouse books. They’ve devoured “Roller Girl” by Victoria Jamieson and “El Deafo” by Cece Bell. If they like fantasy, they’ve finished Jeff Smith’s classic “Bone” and Kazu Kibuishi’s Amulet series, as well as Max Brallier’s Last Kids on Earth books.

<h3 id="the-best-childrens-books-of-2019">&ldquo;The best children’s books of 2019&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6hXR_RGvsWLVjAMbf5YPLmdNvoU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E77OE4AL34I6VPM5YYUP2SFTUA.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<p>(Sarah K. Benning for The Washington Post)</p>
<p>The library wasn’t where a ninth-grade Erin Entrada Kelly would have chosen to spend her lunchtime.</p>
<p>“I had one best friend and she had a different lunch, so I would go to the library. I would have much rather had friends and gone outside,” Kelly said.</p>
<p>She felt like an outsider while growing up in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Kelly is Filipina American, and her town had almost no immigrant population, she said. She was bullied beginning in elementary school. But Kelly remembers ninth grade as especially bad — until someone caught on to her library escapes.</p>
<p>Children&rsquo;s author Erin Entrada Kelly (Laurence Kesterson)</p>
<p>“A girl named Ellen noticed and asked me why,” Kelly said. “She said, ‘You could come sit with me,’ and the next day that’s what I did.”</p>
<p>What she calls a small gesture made a huge impact on Kelly, now a children’s author. Her novels, notably Newbery Medal-winning “Hello, Universe” and “You Go First,” often deal with bullying. They also deal with otherness, something Kelly didn’t see in the books of her childhood.</p>
<p>“I didn’t crave more diversity in books because it didn’t occur to me that it was an option,” she said.</p>
<p>Most of the characters Kelly read about in the 1980s and ’90s were white. They didn’t have money problems. They had two-parent families. She’s thankful that the publishing world has realized that children’s books should reflect many more ethnicities and situations.</p>
<p>“There are different families depicted — single-parents families, families with no money, same-sex families,” she said. “We live in a society that has so many people. Everyone deserves to see themselves in books, in movies on TV.”</p>
<p>Kelly’s new book, “Lalani of the Distant Sea,” is a fantasy, a departure from her realistic fiction.</p>
<p>“When you’re building your own world, there are so many opportunities to fail,” she said with a laugh. “You have to be able to anticipate readers’ questions.”</p>
<p>Kelly invented the island of Sanlagita, but the issues its inhabitants face — toxic masculinity and gender stereotypes, among them — are familiar to many kids.</p>
<p>And kids who shy from fantasy because they find the characters unrelatable have a reason to pick up this novel.</p>
<p>“I created a heroine in Lalani, who isn’t particularly gifted in any way,” Kelly said. “What’s extraordinary about her is her power to be compassionate. . . . That’s not something we typically celebrate in our society.”</p>
<p>KidsPost asked Kelly to choose five books for holiday giving. (Not all are 2019 titles.) The Washington Post children’s book critics also contributed their favorite five from this year.</p>
<p>Erin Entrada Kelly&rsquo;s selections</p>
<p>Bronze and Sunflower</p>
<p>By Cao Wenxuan, illustrated by Meilo So (Candlewick, ages 9 to 12)</p>
<p>This novel centers on two children — Bronze, a mute peasant boy, and Sunflower, the daughter of an artist — who are growing up in the wetlands of the northern Jiangsu province during China’s Cultural Revolution. It’s not enough to say this is a story of friendship and family, because it’s much more than that. It’s a story of loyalty, sacrifice and community, and what it means when you love the people in your life more than you love yourself.</p>
<p>The Prince and the Dressmaker</p>
<p>By Jen Wang (First Second, ages 12 and older)</p>
<p>Prince Sebastian’s family wants to find him a wife, but Sebastian is looking for someone else: a dressmaker. When he finds Frances, their pairing seems to be ideal. She loves making dresses, and Prince Sebastian loves wearing them. But what begins as a perfect partnership soon buckles under the weight of their shared secret. This exuberant graphic novel explores identity, love and art in a wonderful melody of illustration and prose. A modern fairy tale for any age.</p>
<p>Maybe He Just Likes You</p>
<p>By Barbara Dee (Aladdin, ages 9 to 13)</p>
<p>Mila is confused when the boys at her middle school start paying attention to her. One day she’s an ordinary seventh-grade girl playing in the school band; the next day, the boys start giving her unwanted hugs and “accidentally” grazing her body. Her friend Zara says they’re “just flirting.” Zara dismisses Mila’s concerns as immature. But it doesn’t feel like flirting to Mila. It just feels wrong. Barbara Dee brings the #MeToo conversation to a middle-grade audience with nuance and authenticity. An important book.</p>
<p>Bone Talk</p>
<p>By Candy Gourlay (David Fickling Books, ages 8 to 12)</p>
<p>A good coming-of-age story transcends worlds and timelines, and such is the case for “Bone Talk.” It’s 1899, and Samkad lives in a mountainous village in the Philippines, where he dreams of becoming a mighty headhunter like his father. He spends much of his time with Luki, a girl with a warrior spirit. Samkad and Luki know little about the outside world — until a boy arrives and tells them about strange invaders called Americans. This novel was shortlisted for the Carnegie Medal, the Costa Book Award and the Leeds Book Award before its U.S. debut in November. All honors are well deserved.</p>
<p>There Is No Long Distance Now</p>
<p>By Naomi Shihab Nye (Greenwillow Books, ages 14 and older)</p>
<p>Upon first glance, it seems impossible that 40 life-affirming short stories appear in such a slim little book, but that is the magic of Naomi Shihab Nye. This series of semi-connected (very) short stories explore the influence of class, ethnicity, war, peace, life and death on our daily lives, through the eyes of characters who are both three-dimensional and deeply universal.</p>
<p>Fiction</p>
<p>Look Both Ways: A Tale Told in Ten Blocks</p>
<p>By Jason Reynolds (Athenaeum, ages 10 to 14)</p>
<p>A lot happens on the walk home from a city middle school. A shy boy prepares to talk to his crush, a fierce girl fights for her skateboard and an anxious kid finds support from a broom dog in 10 short stories that are sometimes funny, often surprising and always real. Shortlisted for this year’s National Book Award for Young People’s Literature.</p>
<p>New Kid</p>
<p>By Jerry Craft (HarperCollins, ages 8 to 12)</p>
<p>Jordan Banks, an African American boy, tries to find his place at a new private school where most of the students are wealthy and white. Throughout this dynamic graphic novel, he’s bolstered by an important trait: his love of drawing.</p>
<p>(G.P. Putnam&rsquo;s Sons Books for Young Readers)</p>
<p>The Downstairs Girl</p>
<p>By Stacey Lee (G.P. Putnam’s Sons, ages 12 and older)</p>
<p>As the newspaper advice columnist Miss Sweetie, Jo Kuan probes the social ills of post-Reconstruction Atlanta. This vividly rendered historic novel will keep readers riveted as witty, observant Jo deals with the dangers of questioning power.</p>
<p>Strange Birds: A Field Guide to Ruffling Feathers</p>
<p>By Celia Perez (Penguin, ages 8 to 12)</p>
<p>Four very different girls join forces in Miami to protect birds and end up taking on family expectations, cultural norms and a historic feathered hat. Pink plastic flamingoes play a strategic role in this lively, thought-provoking tale of friendship and activism.</p>
<p>The Bridge Home</p>
<p>By Padma Venkatraman (Paulsen/Penguin, ages 10 and up)</p>
<p>In this gritty, heartfelt novel, 11-year-old Viji and her sister flee their perilous home in India and learn to survive on their own, with the help of a friendly dog and two resourceful street boys.</p>
<p>— Mary Quattlebaum</p>
<p>Nonfiction</p>
<p>1919: The Year That Changed America</p>
<p>By Martin W. Sandler (Bloomsbury, ages 10 to 14)</p>
<p>What a year! Describing 1919’s turmoil — including racial violence, labor disputes, women’s fight for voting rights, anti-immigrant actions, baseball cheats and a horrible accident involving millions of gallons of molasses — Sandler reveals both how far the United States has come in the past century and the roots of many of our current problems. The book won the 2019 National Book Award for Young People’s Literature.</p>
<p>The Poison Eaters: Fighting Danger and Fraud in Our Food and Drugs</p>
<p>By Gail Jarrow (Calkins Creek, ages 10 and older)</p>
<p>In the early 1900s, Harvey Wiley tried to protect his fellow Americans from all sorts of dangerous products, such as rotting meat and fake medicine. Gail Jarrow’s well-researched book — full of misleading ads from the time — shows how Wiley’s scientific approach led to much healthier American lives.</p>
<p>Two Brothers, Four Hands: The Artists Alberto and Diego Giacometti</p>
<p>By Jan Greenberg and Sandra Jordan, illustrated by Hadley Hooper (Holiday House, ages 7 to 10)</p>
<p>Focusing on two brothers with very different personalities, this book celebrates the extraordinary art they created as well as their brotherly bond. Hadley Hooper’s illustrations depict the men, the places they lived, and their artworks with skill and vibrancy.</p>
<p>Thurgood</p>
<p>By Jonah Winter, illustrated by Bryan Collier (Schwartz &amp; Wade, ages 5 to 8)</p>
<p>This picture-book biography of Thurgood Marshall follows him from his Baltimore childhood to the Supreme Court, as a lawyer arguing landmark cases and as the first black Supreme Court justice. Winter’s well-chosen facts and Collier’s radiant watercolor-and-collage pictures go perfectly together.</p>
<p>Magnificent Migration: On Safari with Africa’s Last Great Herds</p>
<p>By Sy Montgomery (HMH, ages 10 and up)</p>
<p>This close-up look at wildlife includes lots of photos and explains how a variety of animals migrate to survive. Montgomery’s focus on the wildebeest, Africa’s super-social bearded antelopes, makes it clear that we need to protect the Serengeti and other threatened habitats.</p>
<p>— Abby McGanney Nolan</p>
<p>Picture</p>
<p>Small in the City</p>
<p>By Sydney Smith (Neal Porter/Holiday House, ages 4 to 8)</p>
<p>Where in the city could you go to hide or warm up? The snow is starting to fall, and a child is looking for a lost creature. “I know what it’s like to be small in the city,” the child says before giving some advice. “People don’t see you and loud sounds can scare you.” But there might also be a warm vent with steamy summer air, a kind person with food to offer, a tree to climb and places to stay safe, and someone who is waiting at home.</p>
<p>The King of Kindergarten</p>
<p>By Derrick Barnes, illustrated by Vanessa Brantley-Newton (Nancy Paulsen/Penguin, Ages 3 to 6)</p>
<p>The King of Kindergarten washes his face, brushes his teeth and eats a tower of pancakes before the big yellow carriage takes him to a grand fortress. He greets the others in his Kindergarten Kingdom with a welcoming smile and a big hello, and gets to hear from the teacher about shapes, the alphabet and the mysteries of numbers. He is charming, and wonderful, and kind, as a king should be!</p>
<p>River</p>
<p>By Elisha Cooper (Orchard/Scholastic, Ages 4 to 10)</p>
<p>An intrepid mom sets out on a 300-mile journey by canoe, from quiet mountain lakes to the busy headwaters of the Hudson where the city crowds the river close. Come along on this bold voyage where moose and bear and starry skies give way to towns, bridges, storms and big boats, and finally a welcome home.</p>
<p>Gittel’s Journey: An Ellis Island Story</p>
<p>By Lesléa Newman, illustration by Amy June Bates (Abrams, Ages 4 to 8)</p>
<p>Nine-year-old Gittel wishes she could bring the neighbor’s goat, Frieda, with her to America. All she has when she says goodbye to her mother is her rag doll, her mother’s Shabbos candlesticks and her bundle of clothes. The</p>
<p>address for a cousin in New York is damp and the ink smeared by the time the ship reaches the Statue of Liberty. Will Gittel ever see her mother again?</p>
<p>Camp Tiger</p>
<p>By Susan Choi, illustrated by John Rocco (G.P. Putnam, Ages 4 to 9)</p>
<p>The late September family camping trip in the mountains is special this year because of a surprise visitor: a tiger that can talk! The tiger wants to stay in a tent and it wants to eat the fish that our first-grade hero catches. The tiger leads the way to a hidden overlook, and it can even steer a canoe with its paws. First grade seems a bit easier after this.</p>
<p>— Kathie Meizner</p>
<p>Correction: The author of “Gittel’s Journey: An Ellis Island Story” was incorrectly identified as Leslie Newman. She is Lesléa Newman. The story has been updated.

<h3 id="a-librarian-makes-the-case-for-graphic-novels-for-kids">&ldquo;A librarian makes the case for graphic novels for kids&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RYYY7YSX3II6VK3ICAPM73BFGI.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
Before we go any further, though, here’s another question at the heart of the matter: Should we call these books “comics” or “graphic novels”? Over the years, “comics” has become something of a pejorative, meaning a less-than-literary book played for laughs. “Graphic novel” sounds more highbrow, but it’s not always correct, given that many of these books now are memoirs and other kinds of nonfiction. In addition, some people still get tripped up by the multiple meanings of the word “graphic.” Françoise Mouly, the publisher of TOON books suggests using the word “comics” as a broader term to describe books with sequential art and words, which need not be funny (but can be).</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>So, comics it is.</p>
<p>As librarians, we see how so many kids readily connect to comics and how this connection to books is helping to create lifelong readers. Dave Burbank, my library’s comics expert, likes to reassure worried parents that many young readers are drawn to the genre because comics bear a resemblance to the screens so ubiquitous in our kids’ lives, yet they are reading a book — not staring at a phone or tablet.</p>
<p>We know that comics are especially beneficial to struggling or reluctant readers, as well as English-language learners. These books also offer all readers a way to practice important reading skills such as building vocabulary, understanding a sequence of events, discerning the plot of a story and making inferences. And comics give young readers training in visual literacy — helping them read and interpret images — an essential skill in our highly visual world.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>So why do some parents and teachers continue to regard comics in such a negative light? Part of it may have to do with the history of comics in the United States, Mouly said. In the 1950s, Mouly notes, congressional hearings were held on what lawmakers saw as a possible connection between juvenile delinquency and comics. Worried that the federal government would try to regulate their industry, comics publishers established the Comics Code Authority as an alternative to government regulation. The Comics Code required that comic books show respect for established authority and banned nudity and explicit violence. While voluntary, the code was followed by many publishers, resulting in an industry focused largely on producing simple, laugh-inducing kids’ comics like “Archie.”</p>
<p>In the 1980s, there was a backlash as more publishers decided to create comics for adults, such as the classic “Batman: The Dark Knight Returns,” published in 1986. The market became dominated by glossy, expensive superhero comics mostly aimed at an adult male audience. Suddenly, comics were really not for kids anymore.</p>
<p>Then, in 1992, “Maus: A Survivor’s Tale,” a graphic novel by author/artist Art Spiegelman (Mouly’s husband), became the first comic to win a Pulitzer Prize, giving the format a new standing in American literature.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>From there, comics have been on a slow, but mostly steady, march to acceptance as more literary graphic novels and comics were published, first for adults and now for children and teens. In the past decade, the increase in female comics creators, such as Raina Telgemeier, has expanded the range of books published for both adults and kids. Superhero stories have been joined on the comics shelves by realistic fiction and by memoirs and other nonfiction.</p>
<p>Mouly credits librarians with helping to shift the public’s thinking about comics, as libraries, rather than comic book shops, have become the go-to place to find the genre. Yet, an implicit — and strong — bias remains in U.S. education against books with pictures. While picture books are seen as wonderful and important for young pre-readers, once kids learn to read, the prevailing wisdom is that it’s time to take away the pictures. Even parents and teachers who condone comics often see them as a steppingstone toward the goal of reading text-only books.</p>
<p>Kids have fought back. Over a decade and a half, they have embraced comics and highly illustrated “hybrid” series such as Captain Underpants, Diary of a Wimpy Kid and Dork Diaries. At the same time, comics for kids have begun winning literary awards. In 2007, “American Born Chinese” by Gene Luen Yang became the first graphic novel to win the Michael Printz Award, given annually to the best book for teens. It was also a National Book Award finalist. In 2015, “El Deafo” was the first comic to win a Newbery Honor, an award for text, not pictures.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>This year, the literary community went a step further, awarding “New Kid,” a graphic novel written and illustrated by Jerry Craft, the 2020 Newbery Medal, considered the most prestigious U.S. children’s book award. Although two previous graphic novels won Newbery Honors, this was the first time that a comic captured the top award.</p>
<p>Comics won an unprecedented eight awards this year when the American Library Association announced its selection of the best new books for kids and teens. Among the winners was “Hey, Kiddo,” a graphic memoir written and illustrated by Jarrett Krosoczka, which received the 2020 Odyssey Award for the best-produced audiobook for kids and teens, breaking another boundary for comics.</p>
<p>With such achievements and the soaring popularity of comics and hybrid books among young people, publishers have rushed to establish new imprints and sign new comics creators to fill the demand.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Among the new imprints are Random House Graphics; among its first books, to be published this spring, is “Stepping Stones,” the first for kids ages 8-12 by best-selling comics writer and illustrator Lucy Knisley. And Houghton Mifflin recently announced its new imprint, Etch, which this fall will publish its first books, including “Oh My Gods!,” by Stephanie Cooke and Insha Fitzpatrick, and “Dinomighty!,” by Greg Trine.</p>
<p>The kids are on board with comics, and so are many publishers, librarians, teachers and literary award givers. I’m hopeful that still-reluctant parents and educators are coming around. Whenever I encounter resistance, I think of what Robin Brenner, teens librarian at the Public Library of Brookline, Mass., and founder of the “No Flying No Tights” website, said: “Comics are not intended to replace prose. They are just one way to tell a story. But they can be as demanding, creative, intelligent, compelling, and full of story as any book.”</p>
<p>Karen MacPherson is the children’s and teen services coordinator for the Takoma Park, Md., library.</p>
