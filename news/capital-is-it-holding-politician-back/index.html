<p>The Big Story: Don’t call it a comeback</p>
<p>Is Amit Shah back?</p>
<p>Of course, India’s Home Minister and former president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was never really gone. Yet there was a period this year where he seemed somewhat absent, in stark contrast to the previous months.</p>
<p>Ever since the BJP was re-elected in 2019 with a huge national mandate, Shah had been taking a much larger role compared to his stature during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first term.</p>
<p>It was Shah who steered the monumental, controversial changes to the autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir, introduced the law criminalising instant divorce in Islam and traveled around the country promising that a National Register of Citizens would be instituted after the passage of Citizenship Act amendments that are believed by many to be discriminatory.</p>
<p>We even asked, on this newsletter, whether Amit Shah was grabbing the spotlight from Modi because, as another theory suggested, this seemed to be an extremely rare case of succession planning in an Indian political party.</p>
<p>Illustration: Nithya Subramanian</p>
<p>Then the Citizenship Amendment Act-National Register of Citizens controversy sparked off massive protests around the country, forcing Modi to publicly distance himself from Shah’s more controversial assertions. This period coincided with several middling state election results for the Bharatiya Janata Party, provoking questions about whether Shah had lost his touch or was too stretched between his role in government and with the party.</p>
<p>(The presidency moved to JP Nadda in January, though Shah is still consulted on most key matters.)</p>
<p>Next came the Delhi election campaign that seemed classic Amit Shah: combative and controversial, with the open aim of religious polarising the electorate. The BJP received a drubbing, but the charged climate eventually led to the first large-scale riots in four decades in the capital.</p>
<p>This was when Shah seemed to disappear. National Security Advisor Ajit Doval ended up taking charge on ground – though media leaks later insisted that Amit Shah had deputed him. As the aftermath of the Delhi violence rolled into the Covid-19 crisis, Shah continue to seem relatively subdued, aside from one pugnacious speech in Parliament.</p>
<p>Indeed, so absent was Shah from the headlines that rumours spread about his health – prompting a public statement from the minister insisting that he was fine. Ahmedabad Police detained four people allegedly spreading misinformation around this.</p>
<p>Over the last few weeks, the Home Minister has started to seem much more prominent again, predictably alongside issues of politics, rather than governance.</p>
<p>Shah appeared to be the one taking on West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for her state’s allegedly lackadaisical Covid-19 response. He turned up on TV to push back against the questions being raised about his government’s massive mishandling of the migrant crisis, saying some only started walking home because they “lost patience”.</p>
<p>There have also been moves to destabilise the coalition government in Maharashtra as well as poach legislators in Gujarat and Rajasthan that appear to be right out of Shah’s playbook.</p>
<p>Then, with the country still in the throes of the coronavirus crisis, India’s Home Minister properly returned to home territory by re-starting large-scale political activity: He held three virtual BJP rallies in Odisha, Bihar and West Bengal.</p>
<p>Even while insisting that these were just attempts to reach out to the party’s members, they clearly served as the opening salvos for Bihar (elections due in October-November) and West Bengal (elections due April-May 2021).</p>
<p>And now, as Delhi struggles with the rise in Covid-19 cases – which we wrote about on the Friday links edition – Amit Shah seems to have taken charge. After announcing a number of changes, including a promise to treble testing within a week, on Monday, Shah will hold an all-party meeting about the situation.</p>
<p>In some ways, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal appears to be a willing participant in not just a de-facto President’s Rule in the capital, but also the Amit Shah comeback narrative – since it is him, and not, say, the Health Minister, assisting the state.</p>
<p>HM Shri @AmitShah chairs meeting to review COVID-19 situation in Delhi.</p>
<p>• Modi govt to immediately provide 500 converted rail coaches to the Delhi govt, adding 8,000 beds for COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>• Testing to double in 2 days and treble in 6 days.https://t.co/RGfqWfykqT pic.twitter.com/ODwbDHSFHC — गृहमंत्री कार्यालय, HMO India (@HMOIndia) June 14, 2020</p>
<p>So, is Amit Shah really back? Is it a sign that the government wants the narrative to turn away from the Covid-19 crisis? Will his return also bring back controversial issues like the CAA-NRC?</p>
<p>Jyoti Punwani argues that Shah’s critics are getting it wrong, and that he was working this entire time, just quietly.</p>
<p>“While the coronavirus rages across Delhi, we see youngsters, including a five-month pregnant student, in Delhi’s jails under an anti-terrorist act, despite a Supreme Court order to decongest jails during the coronavirus outbreak. With over 3,000 cases and 38 deaths in Jammu and Kashmir, we see residents in the Union Territory fearful about outsiders getting into top administrative posts, thanks to the new domicile law. And we think Amit Shah was doing nothing during the lockdown.”</p>
<p>What explains the period when he was subdued? One common theory in Delhi was that the Ajit Doval ‘camp’ saw its star rise after Shah was unable to bring calm to the raging CAA controversy or prevent riots in the capital.</p>
<p>Another was that Modi had recognised that Shah is not a useful presence if the aim is to lower tempers or project governance, and so in the aftermath of riots or at the start of the Covid-19 crisis, the Home Minister was not the face of the government.</p>
<p>Very few people in Delhi (or Gujarat) can claim to have genuine insight into the way Modi-Shah relationship – though you should go back to last year’s press conference with both present for a glimpse of how they work together. So we may not get insight into what Shah’s quiet period actually meant.</p>
<p>But considering the Home Minister’s tendency to rabble-rouse and take combative positions, if he actually is back to prominence, you can except more political controversy to erupt anytime now.</p>
<p>On that note, Harish Khare in the Wire argues that it is time for Shah to take over the Defence Ministry, currently grappling with Chinese intrusions:</p>
<p>“True, the Chinese leadership may have a civilisational claim to Sun Tzu, but we also have the historical heritage of Chanakya. And, Amit Shah has more than once proven himself to be the rightful legatee of that heritage. Repeatedly, the best and the brightest among our media have anointed him ‘Modern-day Chankaya.’ It helps that Amit Shah has two other qualities: he is obsessed with ‘ghuspetiyas’ [infiltrators], and is a ‘nibbler’ par excellence. If Chinese infiltrators can nibble our territory, we also need to have a minister who is adept at the art of nibbling. A man who can nibble Congress MLAs in state after state can be confidently relied upon to start playing the nibbling game with the Chinese. It is an enterprise that admits of no restraint, no moral qualms, and no second thoughts.”</p>
<p>Scroll.in Ground Report</p>
<p>Supriya Sharma, executive editor of Scroll.in, brought you a whole week’s worth of reports from Varanasi, one of India’s oldest and poorest cities that is struggling to handle the Covid-19 crisis and the effects of the lockdown.</p>
<p>“In the lanes around Kashi Vishwanath temple, Dilip Singh sat at the entrance of his shop bedecked with Banarsi sarees. He had opened the shop on May 21. Nearly three weeks later, he hadn’t sold a single saree. ‘Boni tak nahi hui,’ he said. There hasn’t even been an initial sale. Yet, he was opening the shop every alternate day. ‘Asha pe duniya tiki hai.’ The world lives on hope. In Varanasi, hope verged on hubris: nearly no one seemed to be wearing face masks, even though coronavirus cases were rising with the return of migrant workers. ‘Banarasi akhad hota hai,’ Singh laughed. Banarasis are overconfident. ‘They think baba is watching over them.’”</p>

<p>Flotsam and Jetsam</p>
<p>Will India, or at least the worst-hit places like Delhi, go back into lockdown? The government has denied any such plan, which usually means there is one on the table.</p>
<p>The numbers continue to soar, with more than 320,000 total cases, and 9,195 deaths as of June 14. India is now the fourth worst-hit country, and its graph continues to head straight up. The recovery rate, however, is over 50%.</p>
<p>India insists that relations with China are stabilising, even though reports have suggested that Beijing is refusing to give up territory it grabbed in Ladakh. Meanwhile, Nepal’s Parliament amended its Constitution with a Bill that changed maps to include within its borders three areas that fall under Indian territory.</p>
<p>Former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda was, among others, elected unopposed to the Rajya Sabha. Mukul Roy is fighting to be a part of the BJP’s Bengal efforts. Tamil Nadu transferred its health secretary after mismatches in the number of state deaths. The Goods and Services Tax Council met to reduce liability on those who have not filed returns yet, while also deciding to host a single-point meeting on the big question of compensation in July. The invest-in-Jio train continues chugging along.</p>
<p>India might have more than 320,000 cases, but the Centre claims there is still no community transmission.</p>
<p>Can’t make this up</p>
<p>The Goods and Services Tax was supposed to simplify taxation in India, but it hasn’t gone quite as expected.</p>
<p>The Karnataka Authority for Advanced Ruling this week decided that (frozen) parotas are not the same as rotis and so could not qualify for the low 5% GST rate and would instead come under the 18% rate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in India, the next burning question for the tax authorities will be if plain paranthas served cold are rotis or parotas&hellip; pic.twitter.com/G71LuaA8mf — Andy Mukherjee (@andymukherjee70) June 12, 2020</p>
<p>Simply put, multiplicity of rates leads to misclassification. Fresh ginger is vegetable, but when it dries, it becomes spice. When you have lower rates on restaurant food than catering, the latter simply vanishes on paper. But these are tax administrators&rsquo; and l lawyers&rsquo; delight https://t.co/wtFjT44KIE — M Govinda Rao (@MGovindaRao12) June 13, 2020</p>

<h3 id="seattle-mayor-blasts-trumps-threat-to-take-back-the-city-after-protesters-set-up-autonomous-zone">&ldquo;Seattle mayor blasts Trump’s threat to ‘take back’ the city after protesters set up ‘autonomous zone’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/06-12-2020/t_6b921279b7b84270928170f4b980167f_name_caphill_scaled.jpg&amp;w=1440" alt="img">
Protesters have occupied several blocks outside the Seattle Police Department’s East Precinct since Monday, when authorities boarded up the building and removed barricades following days of clashes. They dubbed the area the “Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone,” a place where officers are forbidden, food is free and documentaries are screened at night.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>To some protesters, it’s a first step toward their appeals to defund the police and end racial injustice.</p>
<p>A list of demands from the autonomous zone’s occupants included abolishing the city’s police department, banning the use of armed force, removing officers from schools, eradicating juvenile jails and prisons, and distributing reparations to victims of police brutality.</p>
<p>Trump tweeted about Seattle on Wednesday and Thursday after several prominent conservatives expressed shock over the protesters’ activities. He alleged, without citing evidence, that “Domestic Terrorists” had taken over the city.</p>
<p>“Radical Left Governor @JayInslee and the Mayor of Seattle are being taunted and played at a level that our great Country has never seen before,” Trump tweeted. “Take back your city NOW. If you don’t do it, I will. This is not a game. These ugly Anarchists must be stooped IMMEDIATELY. MOVE FAST!”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Durkan accused Trump of promoting falsehoods about the demonstration to fit his vision of law and order. She noted that the activity in the autonomous zone had been peaceful, with people holding potlucks, displaying Black Lives Matter paintings and screening movies.</p>
<p>“Lawfully gathering and expressing First Amendment rights, demanding we do better as a society, and providing true equity for communities of color is not terrorism,” she said, “it is patriotism.”</p>
<p>Though Trump’s tweet did not specifically mention using the military to drive away protesters, Durkan said his words carried that implication.</p>
<p>“It is unconstitutional and illegal to send the military to Seattle,” she said, adding that she had spoken about the matter with Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D).</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“Together we will assure the people this will not be happening,” she said. “I want people to know there is no imminent threat of an invasion in Seattle.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>A day earlier, Inslee (D) told Trump to keep away from the state.</p>
<p>“A man who is totally incapable of governing should stay out of Washington state’s business. ‘Stoop’ tweeting,” Inslee wrote on Twitter, mocking Trump for the misspelling in his tweet.</p>
<p>Inslee later said that although the zone was unauthorized and that the country still faces a pandemic, the area was mostly calm and he hoped for a peaceful resolution.</p>
<p>“What we will not allow are threats of military violence against Washingtonians coming from the White House,” he wrote. “The U.S. military serves to protect Americans, not the fragility of an insecure president.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Trump also took a swipe at former vice president Joe Biden on Thursday morning, taunting that he “refuses to leave his basement ‘sanctuary’ and tell his Radical Left BOSSES that they are heading in the wrong direction. Tell them to get out of Seattle now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Biden’s presidential campaign did not respond to a request for comment on the remark.</p>
<p>Trump’s tweets echoed his threats to use military force to quell unrest as thousands took to the streets nationwide after Floyd’s death to decry police brutality. Those threats led to an unprecedented backlash against the president from high-ranking former military officers.</p>
<p>Although Trump’s tweets did not specifically name the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, nicknamed CHAZ, his comments appeared directed at the movement — a major topic Wednesday and Thursday on conservative-friendly media and on Republican politicians’ social media feeds.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) wrote that “antifa” — a loosely connected, militant activist network known for violence — had designated Seattle as its capital and that the United States should not “surrender ANY of its communities to mob rule EVER.” Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) commented sarcastically: “Lord of the Flies in downtown Seattle. What could go wrong?”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show Wednesday night included an alarming report on CHAZ, describing a “complete takeover of a seven-block area of a Seattle neighborhood” and alleging that armed protesters are patrolling the area.</p>
<p>Soon after moving in on Tuesday, the protesters hung a banner on the police precinct proclaiming, “THIS SPACE IS NOW PROPERTY OF THE SEATTLE PEOPLE,” the Seattle Times reported. Protesters later screened Ava DuVernay’s documentary “13th,” which highlights racial inequities in the justice system. At least one man with a long gun was seen in the area, the Times reported, despite a weapons ban on Capitol Hill, but the scene has been peaceful since police left the area.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Inside the zone, the protesters have held long “town halls” to discuss their plans and hash out a strategy. Speakers on Wednesday took turns on a stage with loudspeakers, sharing their visions for change with an attentive crowd seated in a wide semicircle.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“From what I’ve gathered, we’re trying to take our community back so we can live without a massive police force patrolling the streets,” one protester, Michael Taylor, told the Times.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how long police will steer clear of the group. Durkan, who has faced calls to resign over the police’s use of tear gas and flash bangs on protesters, hasn’t directly addressed the autonomous zone. Asked about CHAZ on Wednesday, Inslee declined to comment, saying, “That’s news to me.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Trump’s stance was clear, however, as he blasted the movement as a dangerous development aided by his political opponents. “Domestic Terrorists have taken over Seattle, run by Radical Left Democrats, of course,” he tweeted.</p>
<p>Later Wednesday inside the CHAZ, protesters set up tents and prepared for another night on the streets. A funk/hip-hop group called Marshall Law Band played a concert, the Times reported, and then protesters gathered for another documentary: the 1990 exploration of underground LGBTQ dance culture “Paris Is Burning.”

<h3 id="delhi-renewed-vigour-in-coronavirus-battle-politics-can-take-a-backseat">&ldquo;Delhi: Renewed vigour in coronavirus battle; politics can take a backseat&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal%2F2020-06%2F4aa7d1f2-011d-4f4e-8fdc-aaccc7655178%2F1506_pti15_06_2020_000121b__1_.jpg?w=1200&amp;auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;ogImage=true" alt="img">
By deciding to intervene and supervise steps urgently needed to contain the pandemic in Delhi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah has rightly signalled the Centre’s seriousness to not let the situation slip any further in the national Capital.</p>
<p>Time has come for politics to take a backseat. Perhaps, it was a prod from PM Narendra Modi that saw Shah holding back-to-back meetings with Delhi Lt Governor Anil Baijal and CM Arvind Kejriwal over the weekend, followed by an all-party meeting on June 15 during which an assurance was given out that COVID-19 testing would be ramped up to 18,000 in the next few days.</p>
<p>Delhi residents have had a tough time. The city had been reporting the third-highest COVID-19 count (of more than 41,000 cases and 1,300 deaths) after Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p>As the number of coronavirus infections kept going up every day, Delhi residents were wondering why the Centre was not intervening to check what appeared to be inability on the part of the Kejriwal government to handle it alone.</p>
<p>Many people were swamped by graphic WhatsApp accounts from individuals who were unable to get themselves tested or lose their family members because they could not get admitted in hospitals in time or receive adequate medical attention.</p>
<p>Fears also began to mount over whether Delhi was headed for another lockdown as it could not afford to open up in a staggered manner as announced earlier. These came amidst allegations of underreporting of COVID-19 deaths with the Delhi government’s data not tallying with that of the three municipal corporations. Frequent changes in testing protocols also created confusion amongst laboratories, hospitals and patients.</p>
<p>Anxiety also began to build up after Delhi’s Deputy CM Manish Sisodia quoted that experts projected the possibility of 532,000 cases by the end of July and Delhi needing a total of 150,000 beds by then to handle the crisis.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the Supreme Court had upbraided the Delhi government for its handling of the crisis and directed it to “take immediate remedial action”. It was clear that Delhi’s problems have arisen not just from its inability to test, trace, isolate and treat all cases and stop the fatality rate from rising. Rather, the very nature of the administration of Delhi with unique separation of powers involving the Centre, the city government and the municipal corporations have compounded issues.</p>
<p>What shocked the residents of Delhi was that Kejriwal had all along been claiming that his government was prepared to handle as many as 1,000 positive cases per day and was “four steps ahead of corona” till as recently as May 30.</p>
<p>There was a talk of the Delhi government taking over the huge Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium to run it as a hospital. That never happened apparently over the issue of transfer of the complex from the Sports Authority of India (SAI). Neither did the Delhi government think of turning one of its own stadiums – such the Thyagaraj Stadium – into a hospital.</p>
<p>As a consequence, by the first week of June, the signs of desperation were unmistakable. The 400-odd much-hailed mohalla clinics, a flagship project of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government, too could not cope up with the challenges posed by the pandemic. Their role seemed to be less than adequate when dedicated COVID-19 hospitals were crumbling under stress.</p>
<p>But why is Delhi scaring everyone — not only its residents but the neighbouring states? Delhi is no longer just the Capital of India. It has now grown into a National Capital Region. After the lockdown ended and when states started opening certain economic activities, Uttar Pradesh was the first state to note a spurt in cases traced to Delhi because of frequent travel by many people between the two states. So did Haryana and even little far away Rajasthan.</p>
<p>Finally, Lt Governor Anil Baijal, the Centre’s point person for Delhi, realised that the management of the pandemic was creating an atmosphere of helplessness though an epidemic had been officially declared on March 12.</p>
<p>Baijal first shot down Kejriwal’s decision of June 6 to reserve Delhi hospitals only for Delhiites and limit the number of tests under new rules that fell afoul of the ICMR guidelines. An astute politician like Kejriwal thought best to avoid confrontation with the Centre at this time. A meeting between him and Amit Shah on June 14 resulted in announcing a set of long-overdue steps to reassure the people of Delhi.</p>
<p>One, the testing rate in the Capital will double in the next two days and triple in six days. Secondly, the Centre will provide 500 railway coaches, which will add another 8,000 beds to Delhi’s health infrastructure. Lastly, there will be rigorous contact tracing in containment zones. Rates to be charged by private hospitals for testing and treatment would be fixed soon. Maharashtra has already shown a way in this regard.</p>
<p>Shah has made it clear that the Centre and the Delhi government would have to work in tandem to make the country as well as the national capital “coronavirus free”.</p>
<p>Of course, these steps could have been taken earlier, utilising the period of the lockdown. Nevertheless, the focus must now be on implementing the decisions. Shah can show his mettle. Delhi’s battle against COVID-19 can be a standing example for times to come.</p>

Five years ago, James Shaw had one goal: To change the way that people thought about the Greens.</p>
<p>“Look at media coverage over the previous 20 years. The overriding narrative is: ‘For God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t let these people anywhere near power.</p>
<p>“&lsquo;They’re crazy. They&rsquo;ll crash the government, they will destroy the economy. They&rsquo;ve got no idea what they&rsquo;re doing. They&rsquo;re completely unreliable. They smell’.”</p>
<p>To change the story, Shaw had to do two things. The first was to become part of the leadership. The second was to prove the naysayers wrong.</p>

</ul>
<p>Robert Kitchin/Stuff James Shaw is marking five years as the Greens co-leader.</p>
<p>“Even when I was elected as co-leader, that bloody clip of people dancing around the maypole at the 1990-something [conference], that was the intro. That was the thing that I most wanted to change.</p>
<p>“I knew the way to do that wasn&rsquo;t by public relations. It was by getting into government and just demonstrating that our policies are good for people and actually kind of sensible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I think we have. I think people look at us as the reliable government partner.”</p>
<p>Shaw was selected as male co-leader in May 2015. He’d been an MP for just eight months, and even in the helter-skelter world of New Zealand politics, the victory was a shock. His main rival was genial senior MP Kevin Hague.</p>
<p>Until the contest, he&rsquo;d been Shaw’s caucus mentor.</p>
<p>Shaw admitted his corporate background put him at a disadvantage in a party of radicals and nonconformists. With neat suits and a clean-cut style, he seemed an unlikely partner to anarchist-turned-firebrand politician Metiria Turei.</p>
<p>“The leadership campaign … was bloody intense. Everyone – including me – assumed that Kevin would win.”</p>
<p>Ross Giblin/Stuff Gareth Hughes, Vernon Tava, Kevin Hague and James Shaw on the leadership campaign trail in Wellington.</p>
<p>Then came a moment when Shaw realised he had momentum. He’d just delivered a belting speech to a packed conference hall on Wellington’s Queen’s Wharf. Hague changed his stump speech at the last moment, and it fell flat.</p>
<p>“Both of our teams were trying to get numbers. It&rsquo;s unlike a caucus vote when [you] ring the other MPs and find out. This is: ring every single branch, get a sense of what&rsquo;s going on.”</p>
<p>Two days before the vote was to be counted and confirmed at the party’s annual general meeting, Hague, who was poorly with pneumonia, rang Shaw to concede.</p>
<p>“He said: ‘we can&rsquo;t win, you know. You&rsquo;ve won.’</p>
<p>“We knew that we had a pretty good margin. But with a third of the votes uncounted, it could have gone the other way.”</p>
<p>Shaw was still very much a rookie MP, and about to be thrown into the deep end.</p>
<p>“On the day, the thing I remember most was [when] we hit ‘the huddle’. I&rsquo;d never experienced anything like that &hellip;it was just this wall of journalists – who were all quite used to walking backwards and so forth. But I wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>“It was quite intense. It&rsquo;s funny because watching Todd [Muller] at the moment I’m like: ‘I feel you, buddy’.”</p>
<p>Getty-Images Shaw and Metiria Turei at a media conference following his election to the co-leadership.</p>
<p>Within just over two years, Shaw would be the Green’s sole leader. Turei was forced to resign, weeks out from the election, after confessing to benefit and electoral fraud. Their polling slumped dramatically.</p>
<p>Shaw was left to shepherd the party through the rest of the campaign, the bitter internal fall-out over Turei&rsquo;s disclosure and highly-charged negotiations to join the Labour-led Government.</p>
<p>“It’s been a pretty amazing five years,” he says. “Met’s resignation, the final seven weeks of that [election] campaign, the negotiations – the single most stressful experience of my entire life.</p>
<p>“The second most stressful was the seven weeks leading up to those negotiations: like, you’re the front man while the Greens are in danger of never returning to Parliament.”</p>
<p>Robert Kitchin/Stuff A firestorm engulfed the party after Metiria Turei admitted to benefit fraud.</p>
<p>The negotiations were “really tough,” he says.“We weren&rsquo;t prepared for them.”</p>
<p>Once a deal was thrashed out, the party had to approve it.</p>
<p>“One of the most extraordinary moments of my entire life was a Zoom call with 300 people…when the general secretary started to do the roll call, branch by branch, and it just came back: yes. I&rsquo;m actually having an emotional reaction to it right now. It was pretty amazing to go, ‘we did the right thing’.”</p>
<p>The confidence-supply- deal didn’t give the Greens a seat at the Cabinet table, but they did win nine portfolios including climate change and conservation.</p>
<p>There would be climate change legislation with a goal of net zero emissions by 2050, a referendum on personal cannabis use, a significant increase to the Department of Conservation budget and the removal of excessive welfare sanctions.</p>
<p>There is an enduring perception the Greens have yielded much to Winston Peters and, despite securing only 24,000 votes fewer than NZ First, have significantly less clout.</p>
<p>That more than $5bn of a $12bn infrastructure spend-up will go towards building roads was a slap in the face. A review of the welfare system fell short of promises of an overhaul.</p>
<p>“We&rsquo;re not [achieving everything we wanted],” Shaw conceded. “But neither is anybody else. Right? If you went through the NZ First coalition agreement, or the Labour Party manifesto, or even a speech from the throne, there&rsquo;s stuff that we all haven&rsquo;t got done.</p>
<p>“The new narrative that irritates me is that we only got 95 percent of what we were asking for, therefore it’s a total failure. It drives me up the wall.”</p>
<p>Robert Kitchin/Stuff The Greens have achieved &ldquo;95 per cent&rdquo; of what they agreed with Labour, Shaw says.</p>
<p>The disappointment is also internal.</p>
<p>From the outset, Shaw’s centrist, corporate style has rubbed against the party’s more radical members.</p>
<p>When he compromises, they see the white flag of surrender. Some members chafed against budget responsibility rules, which set targets for lowering government debt and spending, and were eventually dumped by members.</p>
<p>Last year, candidate Jack McDonald upstaged Shaw at the annual conference by quitting and complaining about a “centrist drift”. Former high-profile MP Sue Bradford penned a piece lamenting the loss of the party’s radical, anti-establishment streak. Outgoing MP Gareth Hughes said the Government had not been transformational.</p>
<p>In April, a rump of about 100 members tried to oust Shaw, Minister Eugenie Sage and MP Chlöe Swarbrick by placing them far down the party’s list. Ultimately, the faction failed: co-leader Marama Davidson is ranked first, with Shaw second and Swarbrick third.</p>
<p>At mention of the ‘Green Left’ faction, Shaw slowly rolls his eyes.</p>
<p>“When you&rsquo;ve spent 16 years in Opposition, you get so used to that. One of the challenges we&rsquo;ve had is trying to shift to thinking like a party of Government, not a party of Opposition.</p>
<p>“We&rsquo;ve got a very strong anarchist tradition. There&rsquo;s still a lot of people around who used to be members of the McGillicuddy Serious Party. I think you have to honour that.</p>
<p>“But sometimes, one of the things about being a political leader is you have to take on your own crowd and say: ‘hey team, this is not appropriate’.”</p>
<p>Kevin Stent/Stuff Regional Economic Development Minister Shane Jones.</p>
<p>He appears cautious, but Shaw says he&rsquo;s picking the right battles: especially when it comes to unnatural bedfellows NZ First.</p>
<p>“We’ve got a surprisingly functional relationship with NZ First and everybody understands everybody else’s position.</p>
<p>“So, when Shane Jones goes off about the RMA or something, I don’t respond because why would I?</p>
<p>“He’s just saying what he thinks he needs to say to shore up his voter base.”</p>
<p>Shaw gestures to a conference table: “Then, when we get them to this place, we sit down and go: ‘let&rsquo;s try work out something that&rsquo;s actually coherent, that we can agree, do together.”</p>
<p>But how does Shaw, or Davidson, hold back when the public statements demand challenging?</p>
<p>“Every time we respond, it gives that more oxygen.</p>
<p>“I&rsquo;m really mindful of the lesson of Trump. The more people got outraged by the things he was saying … the more they amplify his message to the people he&rsquo;s trying to appeal to.</p>
<p>“And I do not want that for New Zealand. It is a real, considered judgement.”</p>
<p>There was surprise when the Greens recently voted, under urgency, for warrantless search powers for police contained in new Covid-19 emergency laws.</p>
<p>“There have been a few times when we have made a difference to legislation before it&rsquo;s got to the House. And this was one of those times.”</p>
<p>Eyebrows were also raised when Shaw defended a controversial memo from the office of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern telling ministers they had “no real need to defend” decisions made during the health crisis.</p>
<p>It looks like hypocrisy from a party who railed against the expansion of surveillance powers in Opposition, and have campaigned for transparency in Government. Shaw is resigned to, if not embracing, the cynical realities of holding power.</p>
<p>He talks of “tempered radicalism”.</p>
<p>“You hold onto your radical values and principles. And you work with the system that you are in, whether you like that system or not, to change it from within.</p>
<p>Getty-Images Shaw with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Finance Minister Grant Robertson.</p>
<p>“That is the choice you make in being a political party&hellip;there was a serious debate at the formation of the party, about whether to be a political party, or whether it should be a social movement.</p>
<p>“In making that choice, you have to live with the system.”</p>
<p>NZ First slowed and ultimately diluted some of the Government’s flagship climate change policies. A capital gains tax – originally a Greens policy – was dropped in part due to Peters’ resistance.</p>
<p>Timidity on welfare reform can also be put down to his reluctance. And the Greens were also reluctantly forced to vote for their waka-jumping legislation, which allowed leaders to expel MPs from Parliament, boxed in by their confidence and supply agreement.</p>
<p>It’s no secret the Greens would prefer to govern alone with Labour. Does Shaw ever feel out-foxed by Winston Peters?</p>
<p>“Not out-foxed, but frustrated. There are times I&rsquo;ll have someone on my team or someone from MfE [Ministry for Environment] say: ‘take this decision to Government’. I&rsquo;m just like: ‘that&rsquo;s not gonna happen.’</p>
<p>“But you also have to be careful about being self-limiting as well. He has an endless capacity to surprise.”</p>
<p>Kevin Stent/Stuff Shaw says he&rsquo;s often frustrated, but not outfoxed by NZ First leader Winston Peters.</p>
<p>Post coronavirus, opinion polls put the Greens polling somewhere between 5.5 and 7 per cent. While NZ First will position themselves as a ‘handbrake’ on radical reform, the Greens election campaign will centre on pushing the Government to go “further and faster”.</p>
<p>“There are things that we could have done in the last two-and-a-half years that we have been prevented from doing together,” Shaw says. “If I have a frustration with Labour, it’s that they could have spent more political capital than they have.”</p>
<p>Shaw has respect for National’s new leader Todd Muller, who he calls a “tough negotiator” after talks to secure cross party support for zero carbon legislation. But the deposing of Simon Bridges has changed little: any deal with National would have to be agreed by the wider party and there would have to be significant policy concessions.</p>
<p>“We&rsquo;ve got National’s history to overcome… last night, they voted against the second reading of the emissions trading reform bill. They&rsquo;re fighting against the resource management reforms.</p>
<p>“So, the fact that [deputy] Nikki [Kaye] and Todd are both members of the Blue-Greens hasn&rsquo;t changed anything.”</p>
<p>STUFF National has a new leader in Todd Muller, but the Greens say nothing has changed.</p>
<p>Covid-19 has seen all the parties rip up their campaign plans. Shaw believes the time is now for a conversation about radical social and economic changes.</p>
<p>“People say this is an opportunity to fix some long term crises. It&rsquo;s not just an opportunity, it&rsquo;s actually a responsibility.</p>
<p>“Every dollar that we borrow off our children and grandchildren, to pay to get us through this crisis, as adults, they can&rsquo;t spend on a future crisis. And we know what future crises they face.</p>
<p>“If we don&rsquo;t use the stimulus money to solve those problems, they get a double whammy. They&rsquo;ve got to pay increased taxes to pay back what we&rsquo;ve borrowed and spent to get us through this crisis. And additionally to get them through the climate crisis.”</p>
<p>Conversations about wealth and land taxes, or progressive ideas like a universal basic income are a hot potato in election races. “The circumstances are so absolutely different. You can&rsquo;t look backwards and say that what worked or didn&rsquo;t work in previous elections&hellip;it&rsquo;s going to be about competing visions for what the post-Covid recovery and economy look like.</p>
<p>Monique Ford/Stuff Shaw nursed a black eye after he was attacked on his way to Parliament.</p>
<p>“What we need is not a recovery, but a renewal. Because if we just go back to the status quo, that doesn&rsquo;t fix anything.</p>
<p>“The lesson of history is that when things are fine … the people who are arguing for transformation are at the margins. Now we&rsquo;re in a situation where everything is being transformed, whether we like it or not. So the choices are about shaping that transformation in ways that work for people.”</p>
<p>Last March, Shaw was punched in an unprovoked attack. Paul Harris hit him five or six times as he walked to work and was later jailed for the assault. “There was a period of time when I would look at people funny in terms of their behaviour. I remember sitting in a café on Lambton Quay with [Wellington lobbyist] Dave Cormack, catching up for a coffee.</p>
<p>“Over his shoulder, there was a guy who was acting quite erratically. [Dave] asked me a question, and God knows what it was. I couldn&rsquo;t form a coherent sentence.</p>
<p>Monique Ford/Stuff James and Annabel Shaw pictured in Wairarapa.</p>
<p>“But there&rsquo;s no lasting impact. It was important to me that there wasn&rsquo;t. I mean, it really was very random.”</p>
<p>After a brief pause – ordered by Parliament’s security – he’s begun walking to work again from the home he shares with wife Annabel.</p>
<p>Remarkably, it wasn&rsquo;t the worst moment of his spell in leadership. “That was the day after I got punched, March 15. Remember that the student strikes that occurred in the morning, were actually occurring about an hour before the shooter started up in Christchurch.</p>
<p>“There’d just been this tremendous expression of momentum with these young people who were actually changing Government policy.</p>
<p>“And then, in minutes, all of that evaporated and the world went from an overriding sense of hope to an overriding sense of fear, and just darkness.”</p>
<p>Robert Kitchin/Stuff James Shaw has only just started walking to and from Parliament again, after an attack.</p>
<p>There is a long pause before Shaw, 47, answers a question about how he’s changed over the last five years. He rubs his face, deep in thought.</p>
<p>“It&rsquo;s so hard to answer because this place is so intense and you don&rsquo;t get a lot of time for personal reflection.</p>
<p>“Finding the path of least resistance. There’s that horrendous phrase about politics being the art of the possible, which can be read two ways.</p>
<p>“You can do things, it’s a really expansive notion. And there are some moments where we have changed things.</p>
<p>“And then there are others where you can only do what is possible. Maybe moving from naivety to experience is being able to live in both those worlds at the same time.”

Image copyright Tumso Abdurakhmanov</p>
<p>Sergei Skripal was poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok, Alexander Litvinenko was killed with radioactive polonium… by contrast the man who attacked Chechen blogger Tumso Abdurakhmanov was armed with nothing more than a hammer. But he is still convinced that Russian security services were involved, reports Nick Sturdee.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 26 February 2020. A half-naked man is catching his breath, filming himself in the half light. He&rsquo;s just grabbed the phone and is streaming live on Instagram. He switches from selfie mode and we see a second man, fully dressed, lying face down next to a bed. From his head, a half-metre trail of thick blood, pasted along a linoleum floor across which he has apparently been dragged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who sent you?&rdquo; demands the man who is filming. &ldquo;Who sent you?!&rdquo; he repeats, raising his voice.</p>
<p>His name is Tumso Abdurakhmanov, and he&rsquo;s a Chechen blogger living in hiding in the town of Gavle, in eastern Sweden.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s holding a hammer, and anxiously looks over his shoulder - clearly concerned there might be someone else in the flat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who sent you, I asked!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man groans. He says weakly that he was sent by a man from Grozny - the Chechen capital. And that he&rsquo;s from Moscow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get my address?&rdquo; asks Tumso.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruslan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tumso Abdurakhmanov is an asylum seeker, and he has just managed to beat off a man who assaulted him with a hammer as he slept. He has been expecting something like this to happen. In the preceding six months two other Chechen asylum seekers have been attacked - one gunned down in a Berlin park, the other stabbed to death in a hotel in northern France. He&rsquo;s been tipped off there&rsquo;s money on his head too.</p>
<p>Three months later, speaking to the BBC from a new, secret location in Sweden, 34-year-old Tumso describes being woken by a series of blows to the head, the struggle to get out from under his duvet, and an exhausting wrestling match that ensued, on and off the bed. Tumso isn&rsquo;t a big man, but at a certain point he succeeded, stunned, in getting on top of his assailant, to see his own blood drip on to the other man&rsquo;s face and into his mouth. The bigger man then overpowered him, but eventually, as they struggled, the hammer fell from his slippery woollen gloves.</p>
<p>Tumso then seized it and dealt a series of blows to his attacker&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To start with he fought back fiercely, he tried to protect himself. But after a few blows with the hammer he started to talk to me. Up till then we hadn&rsquo;t spoken at all. I didn&rsquo;t know if he spoke Russian, or who he was. He gave his name. He said, &lsquo;Please don&rsquo;t hit me. I&rsquo;ll tell you everything.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>Image copyright Tumso Abdurakhmanov Image caption Tumso panting as he questions Mamaev - and holds the bloodstained hammer</p>
<p>Police arrived to find the gruesome spectacle of two Russian citizens, their heads bloodied from a vicious fight with a hammer. The larger, fully dressed man had already slipped into unconsciousness. The less wounded of the two - Tumso - was arrested. But after three days of police questioning he was reclassified as a crime victim, and the second man, 29-year-old Ruslan Mamaev, was detained on suspicion of attempted murder, which he denies.</p>
<p>In an extremely rare development, the investigation was handed to the country&rsquo;s Security Services. For Tumso&rsquo;s lawyer, Jens Sjolund, the reason is clear - suspicions that another nation state is behind the attack. Russia.</p>
<p>Tumso Abdurakhmanov is one of up to 130,000 Chechen refugees in European countries, many of whom have fled from the violent and tyrannical rule of the semi-autonomous republic&rsquo;s Kremlin-backed leader, Ramzan Kadyrov.</p>
<p>He left three years ago after a run-in with the then mayor of Grozny, Kadyrov&rsquo;s cousin, led to threats that he would be disappeared - abducted, tortured and possibly killed - like so many other critics of the regime.</p>
<p>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ramzan Kadyrov displaying his collection of swords and guns</p>
<p>Since then he has become the single most influential and prominent opponent of Kadyrov in a busy émigré blogosphere. With more than 350,000 subscribers to his YouTube channels - despite the fact that the population of Chechnya is only 1.2 million - he relentlessly hits out at Ramzan Kadyrov&rsquo;s apparently limitless power in Chechnya, the regime&rsquo;s human rights abuses and its corruption.</p>
<p>New clouds began to gather for the blogger following a long phone conversation with Ramzan Kadyrov&rsquo;s right-hand man, the chair of the Chechen parliament, Magomed Daudov. In Chechnya this universally feared man, believed to be personally responsible for the well-documented campaign of persecution of the republic&rsquo;s gay community, is known simply by his nickname &ldquo;Lord&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Lord initiated the conversation with Tumso but found himself lambasted by the blogger, who then posted the whole thing on YouTube, in a series of posts lasting more than two hours. Later, when Tumso publicly called Kadyrov&rsquo;s father Akhmat a traitor for siding with the Russians in their 1999 invasion of the republic, Lord evidently decided it was time to teach him a lesson.</p>
<p>Image copyright YouTube Image caption Magomed Daudov declaring a blood feud</p>
<p>In March last year Lord posted online an extraordinary announcement for a serving Russian state official. &ldquo;Tumso,&rdquo; he said, looking at his phone as he filmed himself, &ldquo;I am officially telling you from me, and from my brothers. You know who my brothers are. You talked about Akhmat [Kadyrov], and this is now a blood feud. For as long as I have blood in my veins, you are my enemy, and the enemy of my brothers. And we&rsquo;re going to find you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tradition of the blood feud, the revenge killing of a murderer or their relative, is still alive and well in Chechnya. That Tumso had killed nobody did not seem a problem for Lord.</p>
<p>He went on to say that Tumso would not actually be killed, he&rsquo;d just be given an &ldquo;amazingly fun time&rdquo;. But for Chechens, the word for blood feud that Lord used - chir - leaves no room for doubt.</p>
<p>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Magomed Daudov whispers in the ear of Ramzan Kadyrov</p>
<p>Things looked even more ominous for Tumso when pro-government social media broadcast the spectacle of his remaining family in Chechnya - an elderly uncle and two other relatives - pronouncing that they were disowning the blogger. More than that, they explicitly gave permission for him to be murdered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them do whatever they like,&rdquo; said Tumso&rsquo;s uncle and cousins. &ldquo;He is no long longer part of our family. From this moment on, if anyone kills him, we allow that person to take his blood.&rdquo; A blood feud was being publicly condoned - evidently under duress - by the planned victim&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p>When the attack came, it was on Lord&rsquo;s birthday - a fact eerily reminiscent of the 2007 murder of the journalist Anna Politkovskaya, one of Kadyrov and Vladimir Putin&rsquo;s most prominent critics, who was shot dead on Putin&rsquo;s birthday, 7 October. In a defiant Instagram post after his release from police questioning, Tumso filmed himself smiling and winking mockingly at the camera, with the written message: &ldquo;Happy birthday, Daudov! Sorry I&rsquo;m a bit late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he added a hammer emoji.</p>
<p>Tumso - and many Chechens - were in no doubt who was behind the attack. The Chechen authorities deny involvement.</p>
<p>Chechens in Europe&rsquo;s diasporas say they live under the constant threat of retribution and violence - visited either on themselves or on their relatives back at home. Critics have been beaten and pressured, and Kadyrov&rsquo;s opponents murdered widely over the years, in Qatar, Austria, Turkey and Dubai, as well as in Moscow and in Chechnya itself. Some were influential militants - sometimes accused of terrorist attacks in Russia - but others were political rivals, or merely critics.</p>
<p>Russian security forces appear to have been involved in more than one of the killings.</p>
<p>Last August Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, a senior commander in the second Chechen war (1999-2005), was approached by a man on a bike and in motorbike leathers in the Kleiner Tiergarten Park in Berlin. Khangoshvili had been on his way to his local mosque for Friday prayers, and had for some reason taken a diversion into the park. His family believe he had been lured there.</p>
<p>The cyclist shot Khangoshvili several times, killing him with a shot to the head. He then jumped on a waiting hire scooter, and escaped to a secluded location by the nearby River Spree, where he changed into a pink T-shirt and shorts, and threw a bag into the water. Two teenage boys witnessed the scene and called the police. The man was arrested minutes later, just before he could disappear into the crowd of tourists in central Berlin. He presented a valid Russian passport under a false name. A bag was recovered from the Spree containing the leather clothes, a wig, and a Glock pistol.</p>

<p>The assassination had been intricately and expertly planned and, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for the two boys, the killer would probably have escaped undetected. He had arrived in Berlin hours before the murder, after travelling to Poland where it is thought he picked up the pistol. He knew exactly where and when to find Khangoshvili, he had a means of getaway planted precisely where he needed it, and was evidently acting on a pre-determined exit plan. He must have been operating with accomplices and detailed intelligence - raising suspicions of a sophisticated hit by Russian intelligence.</p>

<p>These suspicions grew after the journalist Christo Grozev, at the investigative website Bellingcat, established the true identity and biography of the killer - a former Russian special forces soldier called Vadim Krasikov. This man had already committed at least three contract killings in Russia - of businessmen and a regional politician - and had been shielded from prosecution by the intervention of the Russian security services, the FSB.</p>
<p>Having identified Krasikov&rsquo;s phone number - through documents online relating to the purchase of a car by his wife - Grozev then used leaked mobile phone data to trace his movements over the weeks running up to his trip to Berlin. Other than his home, the locations where Krasikov had spent most time were the FSB anti-terrorism office in Moscow - for a few hours at a time - and a high-security and heavily restricted FSB special forces training camp just outside Moscow, where he had spent three days before travelling.</p>
<p>The Russian security services, it appears, had trained and dispatched someone from the criminal world to eliminate a perceived enemy on the streets of Berlin. Grozev wasn&rsquo;t surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The FSB have their own contingent of former officers,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Or just criminals they can trust or they can hold forever indebted because of, for example, compromising material on them. The FSB is a very corrupt, sprawling organisation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In January, a second Chechen was murdered by a travelling assassin, this time, in France. Unlike Khangoshvili, the victim was not a former military commander - he wasn&rsquo;t a potential security threat - but a blogger on medication for PTSD, who had insulted Ramzan Kadyrov online.</p>
<p>Although Tumso Abdurakhmanov was in Sweden at the time, he was tipped off about the appearance of a suspicious Chechen, Usman Mamadiev, among the diaspora in Berlin. Immediately he feared for the safety of his wife, children, mother and brother, who were living in the German capital. He provided Mamadiev&rsquo;s details to German police, he says. But instead the visitor travelled on to Belgium.</p>
<p>There he visited the blogger, Imran Aliev, whom he had befriended online, pretending to be a cancer patient travelling to Europe for treatment. On 29 January the two of them travelled to Lille, in northern France, checking in to the Coq Hardi Hotel. The next morning Aliev&rsquo;s body was found in their room, with a reported 135 stab wounds. By then Mamadiev had left for Berlin and was soon on a flight back to Moscow.</p>
<p>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Adam Delimkhanov (left) and Magomed Daudov</p>
<p>Following Aliev&rsquo;s murder, Tumso carried out an investigation and posted the results online. He said he had established Mamadiev&rsquo;s connection to a close Kadyrov ally, a member of the Russian parliament for the ruling United Russia party, Adam Delimkhanov. He also reported that Mamadiev had suspiciously bought a car soon after his return home.</p>
<p>The Chechen authorities have denied involvement in Imran Aliev&rsquo;s killing. It has not been possible to reach Mamadiev for comment.</p>
<p>Less than a month later, Tumso himself was the target. His head and body are marked by scars and wounds from the hammer blows, and he is clearly extremely lucky to be alive. &ldquo;It was a miracle,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I realised that as I sat at the police station and thought through what had somehow passed me by. The first emotions you get are impossible to convey. You feel at that moment as though you&rsquo;ve been born again, when you think of how you were on the very edge when someone was hitting you with a hammer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was fortunate, perhaps, that his family remained in Germany.</p>
<p>Unlike Khangoshvili&rsquo;s killer, Tumso&rsquo;s attacker, Ruslan Mamaev, had not travelled on fake ID. It&rsquo;s even easy to find his Facebook page, where the last comment is from his father, Marat, wishing him a happy birthday last August. Photos reveal a tall man with Asiatic features and dark, modishly cut hair, sitting in what looks like a fashionable café, with Central Asian carpets behind him.</p>
<p>Image copyright Facebook Image caption Ruslan Mamaev - nothing in his biography seems to suggest a killer</p>
<p>Mamaev is originally from Kazakhstan, but moved to Omsk in Siberia as a boy. There he started college but dropped out, before travelling to Moscow and apparently working in construction. Judging from a 2018 court ruling, Mamaev seems to have had money problems. He was ordered to pay back half a million roubles - about £5,500 - that he had borrowed from a bank.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve reached out to some of Mamaev&rsquo;s friends and his family. His girlfriend told me on social media that he wouldn&rsquo;t harm another person, that the whole family is in shock and that she doesn&rsquo;t understand how or why he went to Sweden. Apart from that, no-one seems to want to talk.</p>
<p>Nothing in Mamaev&rsquo;s biography seems to suggest a killer - nor any prior connection with Chechnya. But flight data records in Russia, leaked to Bellingcat, do demonstrate that he travelled to Grozny on two occasions shortly before he travelled to Sweden. He returned to Moscow from his second trip on 15 February. Five days later, he booked his flight to Copenhagen for 24 February. Two days after that he was in Tumso&rsquo;s flat in Sweden, with a hammer.</p>
<p>Image copyright Tumso Abdurakhmanov Image caption A gash in Tumso Abdurakhmanov&rsquo;s neck, caused by the claws of the hammer</p>
<p>It has also emerged that immediately after his December trip to Grozny, Mamaev flew to Copenhagen - on what looks like a short recce. According to Bellingcat, it was the first time he had ever travelled outside the former Soviet Union, and he speaks no foreign languages. Like Krasikov in Berlin, he would certainly have been receiving help from accomplices.</p>
<p>A second individual, a Chechen woman, has been detained by Swedish police as a suspect. She travelled to Sweden from France shortly before the attack. And last weekend the Swedish authorities announced they were arresting - in absentia - a third Russian citizen. He&rsquo;s been named as Imran Khaskhanov, a Chechen from Mamaev&rsquo;s hometown of Omsk, and he&rsquo;s also believed to have travelled to Sweden at the time of the attack.</p>
<p>Image copyright Tumso Abdurakhmanov Image caption Tumso blogging on Instagram in April, two months after the attack</p>
<p>Mamaev&rsquo;s motive for apparently trying to kill a man he had never met is unclear, but Tumso has a theory. Much as Vadim Krasikov may have been drawn into the FSB&rsquo;s orbit as a result of his prosecution for murder, Tumso believes that Mamaev&rsquo;s debts may have laid him open to recruitment and exploitation by those who wanted to organise an assassination attempt that could easily be denied.</p>
<p>Tumso is confident that the organisation of the attack was beyond the abilities of Kadyrov&rsquo;s circle. Mamaev had managed to establish Tumso&rsquo;s address in hiding, to get through a door requiring a pincode, and to find and enter his apartment unnoticed as he slept. The blogger believes this points to FSB involvement.</p>
<p>But Tumso is not a defector from Russian military intelligence, like Sergei Skripal, or a former officer of the FSB working as a consultant for British intelligence, like Alexander Litvinenko. Why would the FSB organise an assassination attempt on a Chechen blogger living in Sweden? Tumso, again, has an explanation - money.</p>
<p>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were targeted with the nerve agent, Novichok</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have information - which I can&rsquo;t prove or confirm - that the FSB may have sold that information to Kadyrov. And if that&rsquo;s true, there&rsquo;s nothing remotely strange about that,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;This is Russia - and it&rsquo;s totally normal for different state structures merely to sell things to each other. In Chechnya we&rsquo;ve seen that for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The relationship between Russia and Chechnya, one of the Russian Federation&rsquo;s 22 republics, is itself partly a financial one. Moscow props up Chechnya by pouring in millions of dollars. In return Kadyrov&rsquo;s brutal rule ensures there is no dissent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a marriage of convenience,&rdquo; says Katya Sokirianskaia of the Moscow based Conflict Analysis and Prevention Centre. &ldquo;Very clearly Putin thinks that Ramzan is solving his problems in Chechnya. On the other hand, on the Ramzan side, it is very clear that Vladimir Putin guarantees his biological survival - the survival of Ramzan himself and his family, his children and his close friends, his circle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Vladimir Putin and Ramzan Kadyrov in 2007</p>
<p>Because Kadyrov and his circle, as they well know, can not only declare blood feuds - they can be the subject of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ramzan Kadyrov has blood enemies, and many of his associates as well. They have blood. People who blame them for death and humiliation. And they&rsquo;re waiting for the moment to take their revenge, to execute this blood feud. And Chechens can wait for a very long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not known who ordered Ruslan Mamaev to travel to Sweden and attack Tumso with a hammer as he slept. It&rsquo;s not known whether the FSB was involved, and it cannot be proved it was the execution of a blood feud</p>
<p>But the second most powerful public official in Chechnya expressly warned of such an action, and pro-government social media effectively condoned it by carrying the statement made by Tumso&rsquo;s relatives, in which they gave their consent for him to be murdered.</p>
<p>And for this, it would appear, neither Kadyrov nor the Chechen government have received any criticism from the Russian government - or President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<h3 id="in-final-senate-debate-hickenlooper-and-romanoff-pitch-different-visions-for-change">&ldquo;In Final Senate Debate, Hickenlooper And Romanoff Pitch Different Visions For Change&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2020/06/HC8_3485-scaled.jpeg?resize=1200,600" alt="img">
Romanoff and Hickenlooper seemed more relaxed at the podiums than they did in last week’s televised debates, which were hosted remotely by video. They reinforced their campaign messages while taking a few jabs at each other.</p>
<p>Hickenlooper, a former two-term governor, has the support of the national Democratic establishment and has focused much of his attention on Gardner. On Tuesday he continued to deliver his message about taking a practical approach to fix what he sees as dysfunction in the U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>“I’ve been in public life a long time, 16 years, and my loyalty has always been to the people of Colorado,” Hickenlooper said. “I want to be a doer. I want to be part of the change.”</p>
<p>Romanoff, former speaker of Colorado’s state House, is challenging Hickenlooper from the left. He’s facing a fundraising disadvantage: Hickenlooper has raised four times as much money, with the latest round of fundraising due to be made public later this week. But Romanaff touted endorsements from 400 local elected officials and a grassroots campaign.</p>
<p>“When I win this seat, it will be in spite of the opposition of my own party leadership in Washington,” he said. “I&rsquo;m in this race and in this fight because I know too many folks in Colorado who feel like their voices are drowned out by the kind of pay-to-play politics that&rsquo;s corrupted Congress and soured people on even participating in the process itself.”</p>

John Hickenlooper, center, and former state House speaker Andrew Romanoff, right, in a debate in the studio of Denver7 in Denver on Tuesday, June 16, 2020.</p>
<p>On race and equity</p>
<p>As people around the world continue to call for an end to police brutality and protest the killing of George Floyd, Hickenlooper tried once again to dispel critiques that he’s out of touch with this moment in history.</p>
<p>“I&rsquo;ve stepped on my own words around Black Lives Matter,” he said, referring to his earlier use of the phrase “every life matters” during a racial justice forum, and his error during an earlier debate to say George Floyd was shot.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Hickenlooper continued: “Black lives matter. There is a time where we have to step back and recognize that slavery is a nagging, persistent shame of this country that’s denied the promise of equality for far too long, to far too many people.”</p>
<p>He also apologized for the words he said in a video, made public this week but filmed in 2014, where he compared politicians to slaves rowing “ancient ships.”</p>
<p>“I deeply regret them,” Hickenlooper said.</p>
<p>Both candidates said they hadn’t done enough in their earlier elected roles to address systemic racism. And Romanoff said the effects of racism were obvious in the election itself: The Democratic primary at one point had a crowded, diverse field with mostly female candidates, as well as people of color and members of the LGBTQ community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to recognize that the three finalists for the U.S. Senate all happen to be white men. It’s no accident,” Romanoff said, referring to himself, Hickenlooper and Gardner.</p>
<p>On climate and environment</p>
<p>Hickenlooper argued that the solution to climate change rests in new technology and changes in the markets.</p>
<p>“I want to make fracking obsolete,” he said.</p>
<p>But Hickenlooper wouldn’t support an outright ban on the drilling technology. He said climate change is an existential threat and pledged to get people together in Washington, D.C. to get things done.</p>
<p>“We can, in real-time, transition away from coal, transition away from oil and gas and, and move into this new world of renewable energy, wind and solar, hydrothermal. And at the same time, save money and drive the economy,” Hickenlooper said.</p>
<p>Romanoff dismissed that as incrementalism and said there’s a fierce urgency to take action.</p>
<p>“We&rsquo;ve ignored it for decades. If we were having this conversation, say 40 years ago,” he said. “We could afford to indulge the sort of incremental approach that other candidates are proposing. But it&rsquo;s too late for that. We’ve run out the clock.”</p>

<p>The economy</p>
<p>Both candidates called for greater government support to pull the country out of the crisis caused by COVID-19.</p>
<p>For Hickenlooper, the next round of federal stimulus money would be all about providing resources to small businesses and access to capital.</p>
<p>“That’s really what drives our economy here and throughout the country,” he said.</p>
<p>“There’s always a bias … toward the largest corporations,” Hickenlooper continued, who spent years working in the restaurant industry and founded a brewpub. “I would focus on the truly small businesses.”</p>
<p>Romanoff agreed that small businesses don’t have access to loans, and said it’s because the benefits are concentrated at the very top, with larger corporations. He put the onus on both political parties.</p>
<p>“Those giant companies put politicians on their payrolls … Democrats too often have also been seduced by corporate cash,” Romanoff said.</p>
<p>He previously called on Hickenlooper to withdraw from the race over his ethics violations involving corporately sponsored travel.</p>
<p>Romanoff said federal benefits should go toward people in the middle, and Americans that are struggling to make ends meet. He called for an acceleration of a COVID-19 vaccine and for testing, tracing, isolation and treatment and said he will fight for universal health care.</p>
<p>Different approaches to law enforcement and the military</p>
<p>Romanoff argued for a funding reduction to the U.S. military.</p>
<p>“Clearly it is cheaper and smarter and wiser for us to engage in diplomacy and international development and peace than to arm ourselves to the teeth,” he said.</p>
<p>Hickenlooper agreed that diplomacy is a greater necessity than ever, but he committed only to the fact that defense spending is “long overdue for a comprehensive analysis.”</p>
<p>Romanoff, who recently spent four years leading Mental Health Colorado, has also called to shift funding from police to other community services such as mental health.</p>
<p>“Turning our jails and prisons into warehouses for people who suffer from mental illness or drug addiction is the single most expensive and least therapeutic decision we could make,” Romanoff said.</p>
<p>Hickenlooper said he wants to focus on law enforcement changes such as banning chokeholds, requiring body cameras, banning no-knock raids, and limiting when the use of force is allowed, and holding law enforcement officers accountable for misconduct.</p>
<p>On ICE, Romanoff supports defunding the immigration agency, and Hickenlooper wants to make reforms.</p>

<p>Where they agree</p>
<p>In lightning-round questions, the candidates largely said they support numerous liberal positions, including:</p>
<p>Doctors should not have legal protections if they refuse to treat transgender patients</p>
<p>DACA recipients should be given U.S citizenship</p>
<p>The U.S should increase social security benefits, although Hickenlooper said he would back that “cautiously”</p>
<p>Both men called for changes to the Electoral College, allowing the presidency to be determined by the national popular vote. It was a seemingly new position for Hickenlooper, who told The Colorado Sun in 2019 that he wasn’t ready to change the system, saying the “Founding Fathers got things pretty right.”</p>
<p>A ban on all assault-style weapons</p>
<p>Colorado should not ban abortions after 22 weeks</p>
<p>Colorado should increase taxes on tobacco</p>
<p>Support a U.S Senate resolution to make Juneteenth a federal holiday</p>
<p>Some sort of reparations to right the wrongs of the impact of slavery in U.S history</p>
<p>Ballots are in voters’ hands and should be mailed back no later than June 22, with a first-class stamp, to guarantee they’re counted. Ballots can also be returned to voting centers and dropboxes until the evening of June 30.

<h3 id="beijings-coronavirus-second-wave-puts-xi-ally-in-hot-water">&ldquo;Beijing&rsquo;s coronavirus second wave puts Xi ally in hot water&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com%2Fpsh-ex-ftnikkei-3937bb4%2Fimages%2F3%2F2%2F4%2F7%2F27737423-1-eng-GB%2FIMG_6693.00_00_03_12.%E9%9D%99%E6%AD%A2%E7%94%BB023.jpg?source=nar-cms&amp;width=1024&amp;height=512&amp;fit=cover&amp;gravity=faces" alt="img">
The Chinese government has made strides in containing the coronavirus, which infected tens of thousands and killed more than 4,000 people in the country while spreading worldwide. At the same time, Beijing is locked in an increasingly heated diplomatic confrontation with Washington. Nikkei&rsquo;s bureau chief in China, Tetsushi Takahashi, is filing dispatches on what he sees.</p>
<p>Wednesday, June 17</p>
<p>On Tuesday afternoon, a long line formed around a sports field in Dongdan, near Beijing&rsquo;s Wangfujing shopping district. There was jostling, and even some quarreling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are lining up for nucleic-acid testing,&rdquo; a young woman walking nearby told me, explaining that the people were there to check if they had the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Beijing is back on a &ldquo;wartime&rdquo; footing after a cluster of infections emerged from the Xinfadi wholesale market. The number of confirmed cases since last Thursday has surpassed 100.</p>
<p>Hoping to stop this new wave of infections, the authorities have tracked down about 200,000 people who visited the market after May 30, ordering them to take PCR tests. The field in Dongdan is one of the testing sites.</p>
<p>Yet, having so many people gather in one place seems like a recipe for trouble.</p>
<p>In mid-March, President Xi Jinping declared that China had basically contained the virus when he visited Wuhan, the Hubei Province city where the pandemic started. He convened the delayed National People&rsquo;s Congress in late May, demonstrating the supposed superiority of one-party rule to the world.</p>
<p>But the new cluster in Beijing, home to the Communist Party headquarters, is an embarrassing setback. Cai Qi, party secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee and a longtime Xi ally, on Sunday replaced executives in the Fengtai district, where the market is located. It seems Cai&rsquo;s impatience has spurred the authorities to hastily arrange the testing.</p>
<p>Cai was Xi&rsquo;s subordinate when the future president ran Fujian and Zhejiang provinces. But he was not even a member or a candidate for the Central Committee when he was put in charge of Beijing in May 2017, causing a stir in the media.</p>
<p>Cai is unpopular among the capital&rsquo;s residents. He was criticized for ordering the removal of all signs on buildings and restaurants to cleanse the city&rsquo;s landscape, and for clearing out dwellings of low-income workers. A Hong Kong newspaper even reported in spring 2018 that he was set to be replaced.</p>
<p>Beijing on Tuesday raised its coronavirus alert to the second-highest level. The return of restrictions, just as the city was restoring a semblance of normalcy after a monthslong lockdown, is unlikely to help Cai&rsquo;s image.</p>
<p>Monday, June 15</p>
<p>Today is Chinese President Xi Jinping&rsquo;s 67th birthday.</p>
<p>The birthdays of China&rsquo;s leaders are usually kept quiet. The Communist Party&rsquo;s official documents only say that Xi was born in June 1953. It was not until a year ago today that his precise date of birth was officially revealed.</p>
<p>On June 15, 2019, Russian President Vladimir Putin gave Xi ice cream as a birthday present while they were both visiting the Central Asian country of Tajikistan. Xi reportedly thanked Putin with a smile and gave him some Chinese tea in return.</p>
<p>Xi spent his formative years in Beijing&rsquo;s Zhongnanhai area, where party leaders and their families live. His late father, Xi Zhongxun, served as vice premier, among other posts.</p>
<p>For elementary and junior high school, the young Xi attended the prestigious Beijing Bayi School, about 10 km northwest of Zhongnanhai. Many &ldquo;second-generation reds&rdquo; &ndash; the children of revolutionary-era party leaders &ndash; studied there.</p>
<p>After his rise to the top, Xi visited the school in September 2016. He stopped in the yard, where children were practicing soccer. Perhaps he felt nostalgic for the happy days that preceded his ordeal as a teenager.</p>
<p>His father was purged in the 1960s amid the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution. In January 1969, at age 15, Xi was sent to Liangjiahe in Yan&rsquo;an, Shaanxi Province, for the &ldquo;re-education of intellectual youths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Liangjiahe is a small village in a deep valley in the Loess Plateau, or Huangtu Plateau. The seven years Xi spent there, surrounded by poverty, changed his destiny. He often says that it was during this period that he set his goal in life: to make China a great nation.</p>
<p>Now, as president and Communist Party general secretary, Xi&rsquo;s 67th birthday holds great political significance.</p>
<p>There is an unwritten rule called qi shang, ba xia, which literally means &ldquo;seven up, eight down.&rdquo; It allows party cadres to remain in key posts if they are 67 or younger, but requires them to retire if they are 68 or older when the party&rsquo;s quinquennial National Congress rolls around.</p>
<p>The next congress is scheduled for 2022, when Xi will be 69.</p>
<p>Xi has already taken a step toward a &ldquo;retirement extension.&rdquo; Two years ago, he pushed through a constitutional revision that scrapped the limit of two five-year presidential terms.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is no guarantee Xi will be able to remain China&rsquo;s supreme leader beyond the congress. If he is to do so, he will at least have to overcome the coronavirus crisis first.</p>
<p>A new cluster of virus cases has emerged at a wholesale food market in Beijing. This put the capital back on alert over the weekend.</p>
<p>Xi&rsquo;s battle with the coronavirus is not over yet.</p>
<p>Friday, June 12</p>
<p>Hua Chunying, director-general of the Chinese Foreign Ministry&rsquo;s Information Department, kept a stern expression during her regular news conference on Thursday.</p>
<p>Asked to comment on a U.S. State Department report accusing China of a religious crackdown, she lashed out, naming U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo directly. Washington, she said, should &ldquo;stop interfering in China&rsquo;s internal affairs under the pretext of religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hua, who has been a ministry spokesperson since 2012, is famous for her stony expression.</p>
<p>But there was a moment, during a news conference in December 2017, that she let her guard down and burst into laughter.</p>
<p>She was asked about Xiang Xiang, a giant panda born at Tokyo&rsquo;s Ueno Zoo. But she misheard &ldquo;Xiang Xiang&rdquo; as &ldquo;Shan Shan&rdquo; &ndash; the Chinese pronunciation of the surname of Shinsuke Sugiyama, then Japan&rsquo;s vice foreign minister. As a result, her reply had nothing to do with the panda.</p>
<p>Hua&rsquo;s smiling face caught the attention of Chinese social media, as a sharp contrast from her usual no-nonsense image.</p>
<p>In January 2018, Taro Kono, Japan&rsquo;s foreign minister at the time, visited China and posted a selfie with a smiling Hua on Twitter. This introduced her to a wider audience in Japan as an approachable Chinese diplomat.</p>
<p>But Hua has stopped smiling again. China&rsquo;s increasingly strained relations with the U.S. over the coronavirus probably have something to do with it.</p>
<p>Hua plays a key role in trumpeting America&rsquo;s &ldquo;unreasonableness&rdquo; to the world, while also making full use of Twitter &ndash; like Zhao Lijian, deputy director-general of the Information Department, who has become known as a &ldquo;wolf warrior diplomat.&rdquo; A smiling face would be unbefitting of her role.</p>
<p>She has had positive things to say about Japan in recent months, praising the country during an online briefing in early February &ndash; though this also sounded like a dig at the U.S. &ldquo;Since the outbreak of the epidemic,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the Japanese government and people have expressed sympathy, understanding and support to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her statement was probably partly out of consideration for President Xi Jinping&rsquo;s planned state visit to Japan in April. But the trip was postponed due to the pandemic, and there has been a subtle shift in Sino-Japanese ties.</p>
<p>In early May, two official Chinese vessels chased a Japanese fishing boat in Japan&rsquo;s territorial waters around the Senkaku Islands &ndash; uninhabited islets in the East China Sea that China claims and calls Diaoyu.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expressed concern over Beijing&rsquo;s rush to implement its national security law for Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters the same day, Hua fired back, saying Hong Kong &ldquo;is purely China&rsquo;s internal affair that allows no foreign interference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chinese Foreign Ministry currently has only two spokespeople. Geng Shuang, who sometimes answered questions from journalists with humor, moved to a new role after holding his last news conference on June 5.</p>
<p>Hua and Zhao now alternate handling the daily task of pushing China&rsquo;s perspective, wolf-warrior style.</p>
<p>Wednesday, June 10: Food for thought on Joe Biden and Chinese sentiment</p>
<p>U.S. presidential hopeful Joe Biden is gaining momentum ahead of the election in November. Protests over the killing of George Floyd, an African American man who died after a police officer knelt on his neck in Minneapolis, have spread across the country, casting a shadow over President Donald Trump&rsquo;s reelection bid.</p>
<p>Reading a headline that said &ldquo;Biden leads,&rdquo; I felt the urge to go to Yaoji Chaogan Restaurant near Gulou &ndash; a well-known tourist spot in Beijing.</p>
<p>As I wrote in an earlier Beijing Diary entry, Biden dined there in August 2011, when he was vice president to Barack Obama. Chaogan is a unique Beijing specialty &ndash; similar to pig pluck, or offal, stewed with soy sauce in Japan. It is a local favorite because it is tasty, cheap and nutritious. And Yaoji Chaogan Restaurant is a particularly popular place for it.</p>
<p>When I last visited, in early March, the restaurant had been closed due to the coronavirus outbreak. Customers could only buy takeout. Now it is possible to eat inside again. I decided to order a regular-size chaogan for 9 yuan ($1.27).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chaogan has few ingredients,&rdquo; said a man who was eating the same dish at the next table. He started talking to me &ndash; explaining that he had come from the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region and that he was sightseeing in the capital with his family. They chose the restaurant because they had heard it is famous, but they seemed a bit disappointed.</p>
<p>I took the opportunity to ask him whether he knew that Biden had eaten there. The man&rsquo;s answer was unexpected. &ldquo;I know him. I heard he likes war more than Trump does,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;For China, it might be better if he is not elected president.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought he may have Biden mixed up with another politician, but perhaps this is how many ordinary Chinese see the U.S. Such sentiments &ndash; that Americans are pro-war and anti-China, and that U.S.-China relations will not improve regardless of who is elected &ndash; seem widespread.</p>
<p>I could not find a photo of Biden in the restaurant. I asked a staff member, and was told the picture had been moved to another location that opened a few years ago.</p>
<p>I stopped by the other restaurant, about 2 km east, and found a picture of Biden hanging on the wall. He looked much younger, surrounded by staff, customers and his granddaughter. During that trip, he also reportedly hit it off with then Vice President Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>Under Trump, once-constructive bilateral relations have deteriorated to a point where they curse each other. Biden has become increasingly critical of China in recent months, in a nod to growing anti-China sentiment in the U.S.</p>
<p>Will the restaurant remove the photo of Biden soon? Perhaps Biden might even prefer to have it taken down? I could not help imagining things as I nibbled on zhajiangmian, a noodle dish the former vice president had ordered.</p>
<p>Monday, June 8: A bridge over troubled UK-China diplomatic waters</p>
<p>The Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937 is widely known as the trigger for the Second Sino-Japanese War. But few, at least in Japan, are aware of what happened decades earlier at another bridge in Beijing &ndash; Baliqiao, or &ldquo;Eight Mile Bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In September 1860, Qing dynasty forces and Anglo-French troops fought a large battle in the area around the bridge, about 20 km east of the Forbidden City. It was the last line of defense to protect Beijing during the Second Opium War, which had broken out four years earlier.</p>
<p>The Qing forces, which relied on traditional cavalry, were unable to repel the attacks by the British and French, which had state-of-the-art weaponry. They were routed within several hours, while the foreign troops were practically unscathed and advanced into Beijing. Emboldened, the Western armies destroyed Yuanmingyuan, also known as the Old Summer Palace. All this can be found in history textbooks.</p>
<p>Baliqiao, formally called Yongtongqiao and also spelled Palikao, was built in 1446 during the Ming dynasty. Even today, the historic bridge retains its original beauty. Until several years ago, cars were allowed to pass over it, but traffic has been diverted to a new bridge nearby.</p>
<p>When I visited the old bridge at the end of May, repairs were underway and its eastern half was obscured. The only indication of the fierce battle once fought there is a sign that says Baliqiao &ldquo;is a precious witness of a modern China that resisted aggression by foreign peoples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was not surprised that there was no mention of the British and French specifically &ndash; unlike at Marco Polo Bridge, where the Museum of the War of Chinese People&rsquo;s Resistance Against Japanese Aggression stands nearby as a center for patriotic education.</p>
<p>But after President Xi Jinping&rsquo;s government rushed to pass the national security law for Hong Kong, in effect banning dissident activity in the former British colony, the U.K. has stepped up criticism of Beijing.</p>
<p>Last Wednesday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wrote in the Times newspaper that if the Chinese government does not withdraw the controversial legislation, he will open the way for up to 2.85 million Hong Kongers to obtain British citizenship.</p>
<p>Predictably, China reacted sharply, accusing the U.K. of &ldquo;gross interference&rdquo; in its internal affairs.</p>
<p>As seen in Sino-Japanese relations, Beijing tends to use history to serve its diplomatic purposes. So it can be expected to turn up the heat on the U.K. &ndash; perhaps by claiming London has no right to weigh in on Hong Kong given that it grabbed the territory in the First Opium War of 1840-42.</p>
<p>After the Qing dynasty lost the Second Opium War, it also ceded the Kowloon Peninsula &ndash; which faces Hong Kong Island across Victoria Harbour &ndash; to the U.K. It was the battle at Baliqiao that led to this defeat. And as I gazed at the bridge under repair, I had a feeling that like Marco Polo Bridge, it too might also become a center for patriotic education.</p>
<p>Friday, June 5: Zhao Ziyang&rsquo;s enduring democratic flame</p>
<p>Every June 4, the anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown on student protesters, security tightens around the landmark in central Beijing. But there is another place where the authorities are on guard each year.</p>
<p>Plainclothes police officers are also deployed to the area around the old home of Zhao Ziyang, the late former Communist Party general secretary who fell from power after he showed understanding of the pro-democracy movement and objected to suppressing it with force.</p>
<p>Zhao lived on a hutong not too far from Tiananmen. These are narrow streets and alleys formed by lines of traditional Chinese siheyuan houses.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the anniversary, I tried to pass by Zhao&rsquo;s home in the afternoon. Numerous police vehicles were parked nearby, and partly due to coronavirus precautions, his entire street was sealed off.</p>
<p>Zhao died in January 2005. More than 15 years later, his home is monitored because he is still revered by many as a leader who supported democratization.</p>
<p>In the early hours of May 19, 1989 &ndash; about two weeks before the Tiananmen crackdown &ndash; Zhao addressed students who had gathered in the square. Using a loudspeaker and with tears in his eyes, he told the crowd: &ldquo;Students, we came too late. We are sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was his last public appearance. He spent about 16 years under house arrest until his death at age 85.</p>
<p>One man in his late 40s, who attended Zhao&rsquo;s funeral, received a card from the deceased leader&rsquo;s family with a photo showing him smiling. The man still cherishes the card, which also features a faint picture of Zhao&rsquo;s house on the back.</p>
<p>The Communist Party must have feared Zhao&rsquo;s grave becoming a sacred place for pro-democracy forces. It was not until October 2019 that the party allowed the burial of his ashes.</p>
<p>Zhao now rests with his wife, Liang Boqi, in an ordinary cemetery about 60 km from central Beijing &ndash; not in the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery reserved for party cadres.</p>
<p>June 4 was a bright, fine day in the capital this year. There appeared to be more police and armored vehicles around Tiananmen than on a usual anniversary. I don&rsquo;t think it was my imagination.</p>
<p>Discontent over the impact of the coronavirus crisis is smoldering, after all. Meanwhile, China continues to face international criticism over its heavy-handed decision to impose a national security law on Hong Kong, banning dissident activity in the former British colony.</p>
<p>The government led by President Xi Jinping contained the outbreak faster than other countries, and seems increasingly confident in its one-party rule. Yet, the intense security in and around Tiananmen Square also suggests Chinese leaders have nagging fears, and shows that Zhao&rsquo;s &ldquo;fire of democracy&rdquo; has not been extinguished.</p>
<p>Wednesday, June 3: Trump gives China a PR win on Tiananmen eve</p>
<p>Chinese people refer to the Tiananmen Square incident as &ldquo;64,&rdquo; since the People&rsquo;s Liberation Army crushed students&rsquo; pro-democracy movement on June 4, 1989. This year, ahead of the 31st anniversary on Thursday, the atmosphere in Beijing feels more tense than usual.</p>
<p>Tiananmen Square was closed for some reason on Tuesday afternoon. Though the coronavirus outbreak has subsided and visitors have been returning since early May, the vast square was eerily silent.</p>
<p>I have never seen Tiananmen this deserted around June 4. Normally it is packed with tourists &ndash; and to me, the crowds seemed to symbolize authorities&rsquo; confidence that they had relegated the incident to the past. After all, Chinese students do not learn about &ldquo;64&rdquo; in schools and the term cannot be searched online. Most Chinese in their 30s or younger know little about it.</p>
<p>Seen in this light, the empty square is certainly out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>Due to the coronavirus, China&rsquo;s growth rate fell into negative territory in the January-March quarter, raising the risk of public discontent. And late last month, the National People&rsquo;s Congress approved the new national security law aimed at banning dissident activity in Hong Kong, fueling outrage among pro-democracy activists there.</p>
<p>The authorities are taking no chances that the Tiananmen anniversary could spark something in the capital.</p>
<p>Armored vehicles are being deployed to the square. They belong to the People&rsquo;s Armed Police, a unit under the People&rsquo;s Liberation Army that was poorly equipped when the 1989 incident occurred.</p>
<p>Immediately after the Tiananmen crackdown, I remember a Chinese researcher saying that the tragedy would never have happened if the armed police had water cannon trucks or tear gas grenades like Japanese riot police. He meant that Beijing felt it had no choice but to deploy the military, as the armed police were deemed unable to contain the students and other protesters, resulting in many casualties.</p>
<p>In fact, it was the Tiananmen Square incident that prompted Beijing to beef up the armed police. When many young Hong Kongers took to the streets last summer, Chinese media repeatedly showed footage of the armed police training in neighboring Shenzhen, Guangdong Province. They practiced dispersing demonstrators with water cannons and tear gas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has hinted that he could deploy troops to quell the protests sweeping America &ndash; triggered by the death of a black man who had begged for air as a white policeman knelt on his neck in Minneapolis, Minnesota.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, now known as a &ldquo;wolf warrior&rdquo; diplomat, blasted Trump. &ldquo;Why does the U.S. side criticize Hong Kong police&rsquo;s civilized and restrained law enforcement while it threatens to fire guns at domestic protesters and even deploy the U.S. National Guard to suppress them?&rdquo; Zhao said.</p>
<p>He seemed to be implying that China&rsquo;s armed police would do a better job of controlling the demonstrators.</p>
<p>Trump has labeled the violence accompanying some protests over police brutality as &ldquo;acts of domestic terror.&rdquo; But his handling of the situation has given Beijing cover for imposing iron-fist rule over Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Monday, June 1: Roots of the &lsquo;wolf warrior&rsquo; mentality</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s &ldquo;wolf warrior&rdquo; diplomat is on an offensive.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump hinted that he would take strong measures against China over the new national security law for Hong Kong. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian fired back at a news conference the next day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;China is firmly opposed to foreign interference in China&rsquo;s domestic affairs,&rdquo; he said. He even added heroic background music to a video clip of the news conference he posted on Twitter, as if to boost national prestige.</p>
<p>No Chinese career diplomat has drawn this much attention before.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;wolf warrior&rdquo; &ndash; increasingly used to describe Chinese foreign policy &ndash; comes from &ldquo;Wolf Warrior 2,&rdquo; a hit 2017 action movie that depicts a former Chinese commando&rsquo;s daring missions to save compatriots in a war-torn African country. The movie was nicknamed &ldquo;Chinese Rambo,&rdquo; due to its similarities to the 1982 Hollywood movie &ldquo;First Blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhao &ndash; who caused controversy in March by tweeting that the U.S. military might have brought the coronavirus to the Chinese city of Wuhan &ndash; is also gaining popularity within China. Many Chinese must appreciate his criticism of the U.S., and Beijing seems to be giving him a starring role in its fight with Washington.</p>
<p>But is this a job for a diplomat?</p>
<p>Even when politicians criticize other countries, it is up to diplomats to find common ground behind the scenes. Without this division of roles, there would be no diplomatic ties.</p>
<p>The concept of &ldquo;diplomacy&rdquo; is relatively new to China, though. Historically, Chinese dynasties were based on Sinocentrism &ndash; the idea that China was the center of the world &ndash; and thus did not recognize other countries as sovereign nations. There was no concept of nations maintaining relationships on an equal footing.</p>
<p>The Qing dynasty set up the Zongli Yamen, a government body in charge of foreign policy, in 1861, immediately after it was defeated by Britain and France in the Second Opium War. As China was forced to bow to European demands, the beginning of its &ldquo;diplomacy&rdquo; is linked to its humiliation.</p>
<p>Last weekend, I tried to visit the former site of the Zongli Yamen, about 2 km east of the Forbidden City. Unfortunately, the road leading to it remained closed due to coronavirus precautions. Since I&rsquo;m not a resident of the area, I was not allowed to pass through.</p>
<p>Reluctantly, I went for a stroll. Then I realized there is another significant place related to Chinese diplomacy just to the south &ndash; the site of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China&rsquo;s original foreign ministry, opened in 1949.</p>
<p>It turned out that the building, once used as a guesthouse during the Qing dynasty, was gone. What was left was a majestic gate. Former Premier Zhou Enlai, who had served as the country&rsquo;s first foreign minister, must have thought of ways to introduce China to the world there.</p>
<p>Few in Zhou&rsquo;s era could have imagined China growing into the superpower it is today &ndash; reclaiming its position at the center of the world stage. The risk is that, in some ways, China seeks a return to the days when there was no diplomacy.
