<p>How to make homemade hand sanitizer</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you know you&rsquo;re going to be out an about without ready access to soap and water, but you haven&rsquo;t been able to get your hands on any ready-made hand sanitiser. According to experts including Dr Anne Marie Helmenstine (who holds a PhD in biomedial sciences), it is possible to make your own &lsquo;hand sanitiser&rsquo; at home, using Isopropyl alcohol (known as rubbing alcohol) and aloe vera gel.</p>
<p>To make your own, simply mix together 2/3 cup of 99% rubbing alcohol with 1/3 cup aloe vera gel. You can add 5-10 drops of essential oil to mask the smell of alcohol if you want, but this isn&rsquo;t essential. Then use a funnel to decant the mixture into a spray bottle or liquid soap container. Clearly label the bottle.</p>
<p>For your homemade hand sanitizer to work effectively, it needs to include at least 60% alcohol by volume. But if you don&rsquo;t include the aloe vera gel, it&rsquo;s going to dry your hands out pretty severely, pretty quickly.</p>

<p>Does hand sanitizer protect against coronavirus?</p>
<p>Because coronavirus is a new illness, the official medical line on this isn&rsquo;t clear-cut. The NHS website says, &ldquo;we do not know exactly how coronavirus spreads from person to person&rdquo; and that &ldquo;similar viruses are spread in cough droplets&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The NHS advises using hand sanitizer gel only if soap and water are unavailable. Other recommendations include using your sleeve or a tissue to cover your mouth when sneezing, putting used tissues straight into a bin and washing your hands afterwards.</p>
<p>Also bear in mind that while hand sanitizer gels seem like the foolproof way to get your hands as clean as possible, they&rsquo;re not the magic solution you might assume. First up, for the hand sanitizer gel to effectively kill germs, it needs to be at least 60% alcohol – to be safe, look for a 60-95% alcohol concentration, and avoid alcohol-free options.</p>
<p>There are also other things that can make the alcohol gel, or vodka, less effective than you&rsquo;d hope. The CDC warns that if your hands are very dirty or greasy, this can stop hand sanitizers from working properly. You also need to make sure you&rsquo;re using enough gel, and that you&rsquo;re not wiping off the gel before it&rsquo;s properly dry. Seriously, washing your hands is easier.</p>
<p>While hand sanitizers can quickly reduce the number of microbes on hands, they don&rsquo;t eliminate all types of germs. For certain types of germ – including norovirus – soap and water is more effective, according to the CDC.</p>
<p>What should I do if I can&rsquo;t find hand sanitizer?</p>
<p>So you haven&rsquo;t been able to get hold of any hand sanitizer. Don&rsquo;t worry. It&rsquo;s time to turn to good old-fashioned soap and water. To help guard against catching or spreading coronavirus, the NHS recommends washing your hands with soap and water regularly, following the official hand washing steps, including when you get home or arrive at work.</p>
<p>You can pick up hand soap at your local supermarket, but if that&rsquo;s not possible you can also order online – head to Waitrose, Boots, Superdrug or any number of other online stores.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve got your soap, it&rsquo;s time to brush up on your hand-washing technique. It&rsquo;s recommended you wash your hands for at least 20 seconds. Above is the official NHS video showing you how to wash your hands properly.</p>
<p>How can I deal with self-isolation?</p>
<p>The UK has implemented a lockdown period, and in general everyone is advised to socially distance themselves right now. Thankfully in today&rsquo;s connected world, movies and TV can come to you, from all over the world.</p>

<h3 id="hand-sanitizers-go-off-the-shelves-due-to-supply-disruptions">Hand sanitizers go off the shelves due to supply disruptions</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.livemint.com/img/2020/03/30/600x338/a585bd18-728c-11ea-8a93-75a2699158cc_1585599587953_1585599659380.jpg" alt="img">
New Delhi: As the coronavirus scare swept through the country, the hand sanitizer became one of the most sought-after products with most stores running out of stock because of panic-buying. Store owners haven’t been able to quickly replenish stocks as manufacturers continued to face severe disruptions in their supply-chain network.</p>
<p>The same holds true for manufacturers of other essential and non-essential items during the ongoing 21-day lockdown period.</p>
<p>Take the example of WOW Skin Science, a company that sells everything from shampoos to hair oil. One of the top sellers on Amazon India, the company decided to start a hands sanitizer business a month ago. It currently has a stockpile of 100,000 bottles comprising 50ml, 200ml and 300ml. Until 29 March, the company wasn’t able to ship them out from its factory in Parwanoo in Himachal Pradesh to its warehouse in Zirakpur, Punjab for onward distribution.</p>
<p>While getting the raw materials is tough in the current circumstances, a shortage of trucks is making the movement of essential items such as sanitizers difficult. Worse, at the inter-state borders, the police are not always aware on what constitutes essential goods. This leads to inordinate delays.</p>
<p>“Hand sanitizers are not difficult to make. The question is how to get the raw materials,&rdquo; Manish Chowdhary, co-founder at WOW Skin Science, said on Saturday. “Second, distribution is a big problem. There is no e-commerce company taking any inventory. Trucks are unable to reach them as well. There is no smooth movement of either raw materials or finished goods today,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>The key raw material in a sanitizer is either ethanol or isopropyl alcohol. Domestic capacities of isopropyl alcohol had already been booked by the larger and the older sanitiser manufacturers. Meanwhile, imported stocks are lying in tankers at the Kandla port in Gujarat and Nhava Sheva port in Mumbai.</p>
<p>“Those tankers are facing inter-state logistics issues. But things have started improving,&rdquo; Chowdhary said. More passes that allow free movement of essential goods are being issued, holding out hope for the coming week.</p>
<p>Many companies have represented their cases to the local authorities to ensure smoother movement of goods.</p>
<p>“There are a combination of issues causing bottlenecks in the supply-chain today—right from port clearances to getting the essential goods into the factory, to be able to manufacture them and then ship products out,&rdquo; said Ashish Nanda, EY India supply chain leader. “Although essential commodity manufacturers are exempted from the lockdown, a lot of people are finding it difficult to start production. There are manufacturers who have enough stock but they are choosing not to start production because of the logistics problems, which includes non-availability of trucks and inability of the labour to come to the factory,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Gazal Kalra, co-founder of logistics firm Rivigo, estimated that about 80% of India’s truck fleet is dedicated to non-essential goods. At check posts, many of the trucks carrying non-essentials such as televisions are waiting ahead of trucks carrying essential goods, leading to delays. It is also difficult to repurpose trucks quickly during a lockdown. Even when non-essential trucks are allowed a one- time passage, there is no one in the warehouses to unload the goods.</p>
<p>Also, trucks with essential items are facing increased scrutiny at the check posts. Are apples and butter essential products? Cops in some states don’t think so, holding up trucks carrying them, Kalra said.</p>
<p>“There are drivers but there is no fast corridor for seamless movement of essentials. We should resolve the situation in the next 48 hours, else the pipeline filling of essentials is not happening,&rdquo; she said. “The next thing is safe movement of people. Workers shouldn’t be thrashed. People need to reach customer warehouses for unloading and loading,&rdquo; she added.

<h3 id="fda-is-slowing-down-production-of-hand-sanitizers">FDA is slowing down production of hand sanitizers</h3>
<p><img src="https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/ca_handsanpurellfda_012820getty.jpg" alt="img">
We’re all doing everything we can in a tough situation, but the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) – my former employer – isn’t making that easy. In addition to stopping at-home coronavirus tests and insisting on efficacy trials for potential COVID-19 therapies that have already been proven safe, it is now slowing the production of hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>It’s a decision that keeps more people in danger. Here’s why.</p>
<p>Recently, the president announced that “it will be a crime to stockpile” several critical medical items including hand sanitizers. Without these items, both health care providers and patients are at high risk for the types of infections that affect 1 in 31 hospital patients every day. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also notes that hand sanitizers can be effective at home if used correctly.</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>The FDA, in recent guidance, has acknowledged that consumers and health care professionals are experiencing difficulties accessing alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Many hospitals are already out, and there are places where the product is needed because no sinks are available. The agency has also acknowledged that the need can be filled by distillers who can supply alcohol and compounders (like pharmacists, federal facilities and registered outsourcing facilities) who can make the sanitizer.</p>
<p>Some distillers have already stepped up, but there is a complication for others. The FDA has issued a “Temporary Policy for Manufacture of Alcohol for Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer Products During the Public Health Emergency” and stated that it will not “take any action against alcohol production firms” provided, among other things, that the alcohol used is not less than 94.9 percent ethanol by volume, the water used in the active pharmaceutical ingredient is sterile and the alcohol is “denatured.”</p>
<p>The FDA notes that denaturing – or adding unpleasant substances to deter consumption – is critical because if a child or otherwise confused person unintentionally drinks it, it can cause adverse events, including death. Pure alcohol can indeed kill. But when it’s denatured, it can still be toxic. The toxicity can also be increased by the purity of the alcohol FDA requires.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the two allowable denaturants are either in short supply or are not easily available in the United States. Beverage manufacturers would also have difficulty cleaning them from their lines later, so it would be a disincentive help now.</p>
<p>Either way, denatured or not, the type of alcohol used in hand sanitizer is dangerous to consume.</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
<p>Distillers have jumped in to help by supplying the alcohol they have on hand — much of which is undenatured alcohol. That product is safe, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United States Pharmacopeia. In fact, the WHO discourages denaturing products because of the risk.</p>
<p>The same problem applies to the FDA’s requirement of 94.9 percent-grade alcohol. The WHO requires only 80 percent, which is itself far more than the 60 percent minimum to be effective. Not only can many distillers not meet the FDA’s high requirement, but that high of an alcohol content is harsh on skin.</p>
<p>The problem here is that the FDA seems unable to move outside of its own comfort zone of highly precautionary standards — even when lives are at stake. We have seen this before. When people with HIV were dying in the 1980s and there was a drug available to save their lives, AZT, the FDA took seven years to approve it. They would not have done so without tremendous pressure from the patient community. More recently, the FDA dragged its feet while boys slowly died because of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how many distilleries will provide hand sanitizers, but we need fewer roadblocks. Alcohol manufacturers have been reluctant to go around the FDA, once called the “most powerful regulatory agency in the world.”</p>
<p>This is precisely the right time for elected leaders to step in and make decisions that are more in accordance with what is happening right now – what is needed urgently by the people they represent – and find a solution. After the crisis is over, they can go back and figure out whether we should return to a more precautionary standard, or they can look at where we may have gone wrong.</p>
