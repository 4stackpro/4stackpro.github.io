JOHOR BARU: The current hiatus in the school term due to the Covid-19 pandemic and Movement Control Order (MCO) has thrown teaching and learning schedules out of kilter.</p>
<p>Teachers are daunted by the prospect of completing the syllabus for their students who will sit for the Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) and Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia (STPM).</p>
<p>Because schools were closed for the first term school break from March 13-21, teachers and students will have missed classes for almost a month when schooling presumably resumes on April 15.</p>
<p>Teachers in SPM and STPM examination classes now have a compressed time slot to complete the syllabus. Under normal circumstances, teachers would be able to complete the syllabus by August.</p>
<p>Rosleen Salleh, who teaches the Malaysian University English Test (MUET) to Lower and Upper Six students at SMK Tinggi, Kluang, said: “With the compressed time slot, it is not going to be easy for teachers to follow up on what students are doing during the lockdown and that doesn&rsquo;t bode well for their exam scores.”</p>
<p>She said despite many students having access to online learning, it is not easy to do online marking as it requires a longer time especially if one has many students to teach.</p>
<p>Rosleen, however, agrees that the atmosphere is definitely different when there is no face-to-face interaction.</p>
<p>She said teachers have set up a Telegram group for them to interact with their students, but they cannot be sure whether the students have completed their tasks on their own.</p>
<p>“Without face-to-face interaction, it is difficult to say if the learning process via Telegram is effective for the students to attain good results in their exams,&rdquo; she stressed.</p>
<p>Dr Nor Fadzleen Sa’don, a teacher at SMK Bandar Baru UDA, said it is vital to bear in mind that pedagogy is to learning what nursing is to medicine.</p>
<p>“Teachers still need to plan their teaching, set learning objectives and outcomes and identify ways to assess effectively,” said Nor Fadzleen who teaches Fifth Formers.</p>
<p>However, she said teachers need to be mindful of the disparities between families in terms of economic background, non-cognitive skills of parents as well as students’ acceptance of online learning.</p>
<p>She agrees there are plenty of matters that need to be done when school reopens to ensure no student is left behind.</p>
<p>From left Anuar Saaban, Dr Nor Fadzleen Sa&rsquo;don and Rosleen Salleh. - NSTP/VINCENT D&rsquo;SILVA</p>
<p>Anuar Saaban, who teaches Economics to Fourth and Fifth formers at SMK Puteri Wangsa, said students and teachers will struggle to catch up with the syllabus after the MCO ends.</p>
<p>“There is plenty of revision and catching up that needs to be done,” he said, adding the shorter time to finish the syllabus will add pressure on teachers and students.</p>
<p>“During this MCO, I use WhatsApp and Google Classroom to communicate with my students and send them information to revise, but just 50 to 70 per cent of students participate in these online methods.”</p>
<p>He lamented that he was unable to monitor students who fail to give any feedback while others are missing in action from the WhatsApp group.</p>
<p>Another teacher who teaches Sixth Formers said in order to catch up with the syllabus, extra classes and reducing subsequent semester breaks are needed.</p>
<p>The same teacher, who declined to be named, said there is a need to delay exam dates by two to three weeks.</p>
<p>Some teachers mooted a suggestion to replace time slots for non-academic activities with academic lessons in order to finish off the syllabus.</p>
<p>On March 28, the Education Ministry said it was postponing this year’s SPM for more than a month following the extension of the MCO.</p>
<p>The initial dates for the SPM were originally Oct 5 - Oct 14 (First phase) and Nov 2 - 19 (second phase). However those dates are now pushed forward to Nov 16 till Dec 7.</p>
<p>The same announcement also said the STPM (Semester Two) was rescheduled to Nov 18, 19, 23 and 24.
