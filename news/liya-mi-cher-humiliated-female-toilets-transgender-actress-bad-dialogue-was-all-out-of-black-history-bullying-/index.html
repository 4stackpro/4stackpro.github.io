<p>記者羅凌筠／綜合報導</p>
<p>33歲女星麗婭米雪兒（Lea Michele）因為聲援佛洛伊德之死，被昔日《歡樂合唱團》非裔演員莎曼珊瑪莉威爾拆穿種族歧視真面目，控訴麗婭米雪兒在片場霸凌新人，吐出「想在她的假髮上拉屎」的歧視言論，現又爆出她歧視跨性別模特兒，譏笑對方用女性廁所。</p>

<p>據《太陽報》，跨性別模特兒Plastic Martyr 2010年參加艾美獎，在廁所遇到麗婭米雪兒，她向對方說了聲「不好意思（Excuse me）」要借過，沒想到麗婭米雪兒瞄了朋友一眼後跟她說：「不好意思？你才不好意思（Excuse you），你知道你現在是在女廁吧？！」接著和朋友放聲大笑。</p>
<p>請繼續往下閱讀&hellip;</p>
<p>▲跨性別模特兒Plastic Martyr踢爆遭麗婭米雪兒歧視。（圖／達志影像）</p>
<p>當時Plastic Martyr還沒完整變性，被麗婭米雪兒當眾羞辱，影響極大信心，懷疑自己上女廁的決定是否正確，她說：「我打扮得漂漂亮亮，在艾美獎聽了別人稱讚我美極了……我的心情像是從九霄雲外墜落，覺得自己好像馬戲團的怪胎。」</p>
<p>一位親近麗婭米雪兒的友人表示，不記得發生過這件事，「她（麗婭）從8歲開始在百老匯演出就是LGBTQ族群的好朋友」，對Plastic Martyr的說法感到不可置信，非常難過。</p>

<p><img src="https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=85&amp;c=sc&amp;poi=%5B960%2C426%5D&amp;w=2000&amp;h=1047&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F20%2F2020%2F06%2F05%2Fplastic-martyr-1.jpg" alt="img">
Transgender actress and singer Plastic Martyr is opening up about an experience she says she had with Lea Michele ten years ago.</p>
<p>Amid allegations of Michele’s past behavior towards former Glee costar Samantha Ware, Plastic Martyr tweeted about her own experience feeling mocked by the Glee actress in the bathroom at the Emmy Awards quickly caught fire online. (Michele issued a lengthy apology in regards to the initial accusation made by Ware, saying, “Whether it was my privileged position and perspective that caused me to be perceived as insensitive or inappropriate at times or whether it was just my immaturity and me just being unnecessarily difficult, I apologize for my behavior and for any pain which I have caused.&quot;)</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a very unpleasant person,&rdquo; Plastic Martyr, the first transgender female to have a single with Capital Records, wrote on Twitter this week in response to Ware&rsquo;s claims that Michele made &ldquo;traumatic microaggressions&rdquo; towards her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Years ago we were at the Emmys and she happened to be there. I was still in the process of my transition and wasn&rsquo;t 100% as &lsquo;passable&rsquo; then. I was in the bathroom and started washing my hands and then said excuse me to her when trying to reach the soap and she goes &lsquo;Excuse me?! EXCUSE ME???? Excuse you &hellip; you realize you&rsquo;re in the WOMEN&rsquo;S bathroom.&rsquo; I remember going from feeling so beautiful that day to walking out of that bathroom feeling so self-conscious and embarrassed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A source close to Michele says the actress doesn&rsquo;t recall the encounter but is devastated to hear the claims.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lea has absolutely no recollection of that ever happening and was greatly upset to hear of this and she would never have intentionally singled her out,&rdquo; the source says. &ldquo;She has been a huge friend of the LGBT community starting from when she was on Broadway at age 8.”</p>

<p>To show her support for the LGBTQ community in 2017, Michele contributed to a series called Love Letters published on Billboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pride is a strong word and one I don’t use lightly but there is no better word to represent and celebrate this incredible community of people,&rdquo; Michele wrote in 2017. &ldquo;I send all my love to the LGBTQ community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking with PEOPLE, Plastic Martyr opened up about the encounter, how she moved past it, and how she hopes to use her platform to educate and shine a light on trans community struggles.</p>
<p>PEOPLE: You recently spoke out about an unpleasant encounter you allegedly had with Lea Michele. Why did you feel compelled to speak out now?</p>
<p>Plastic Martyr: This wasn’t designed to cancel [Lea]. I’m not for the cancel culture. I think it’s bullying. I’m for educating. I didn’t want to be the source of more pain for her. But at the same time, I don’t want my community to be in pain. To be honest, [my experience with her] was very minor compared to what I’ve experienced in my life. It wasn’t me trying to get a pity party. It was more like, I saw all these other people coming out about their stories and I was like, ‘This pisses me off.’ I’m so tired of the press stifling trans issues. We’re being silenced. I see all these people of color coming out saying she was horrible to them and I’m like, ‘You know what, I’m going to leave my comment too.’ I was regretting it at first because I didn’t want to contribute to more hate or negativity towards her. But I also feel like it was my duty to speak up for the trans community because this is something that goes on a lot in Hollywood and people don’t talk about it. I’m sick of it. It’s ruining my opportunities. It’s unfair.</p>
<p>PEOPLE: How did those remarks make you feel?</p>
<p>Plastic Martyr: I was young. I’m 30 now, so I was 20 then. I was really fragile and vulnerable. My mom had scored me passes to the Emmys and I was so excited because I had been working in the industry since I was 14 and I’ve been trying to break down boundaries. I felt like, here I am transgender. There was no Caitlyn Jenner, there was no Laverne Cox, there was nobody talking about trans. Here I am at the Emmys and I just felt like a million bucks. I came out of the bathroom just completely deflated, with the wind knocked out of my sails.</p>
<p>PEOPLE: What was your reaction?</p>
<p>Plastic Martyr: I was used to it and I was used to pushing it down and putting my head down. I didn’t have a backbone. I wish that it was me now and I probably would’ve educated her in front of everyone else. But I remember just being like, ‘Here’s a huge star and I don’t have any power. I can’t go up against this.’ There was no support then. It was a very uncomfortable era and it was one that I survived and it wasn’t easy. Me speaking out is mostly designed to save future trans people. I was lucky enough ot have a supportive mother – she was with me that day. That was the reason I was able to survive that. But not everybody is lucky enough to have that positive validation from somebody and that’s how they end up killing themselves. The world turns us into freaks, villainizes us, and makes us feel like there&rsquo;s something wrong with us. Without positive reinforcement, we are going to continue to die. It’s not okay.</p>
<p>PEOPLE: What has the reaction been since you decided to share your story?</p>
<p>Plastic Martyr: I’ve been getting a pretty supportive reaction which is shocking and very appreciated. There are people who are victim blaming who are trying gaslight and say that I’m lying to jump on a bandwagon and get fame. Like, Yes, it was my dream to be known for getting into a fight with Lea Michele in a bathroom. I get those negative comments. I either ignore them or I try to have a conversation with them. People ask how can you post that then say “please don’t send her hate. “I’m allowed to talk about an experience I had and have compassion for the person. You’re allowed to do both. I know who I was in my past. I’ve said horrible things that were insensitive – we all mistakes. But the point is, you grow from it, you learn from it, and it’s about who you are today. Today I don’t feel like she’s being a genuine person.</p>
<p>PEOPLE: Has Lea reached out? What would you say to her if you had the opportunity to speak to her?</p>
<p>Plastic Martyr: No. I don’t know if I would say anything. I’d want to listen to what she has to say. I’m done constantly trying to defend my rights. I want to hear what her opinion is now of me or people like me. I want to know how she feels about that experience which I’m sure she doesn’t even remember. And something that she doesn’t even remember can have a lasting impact on someone else. The power of words.</p>
<p>PEOPLE: How can we be better as a society and support the trans community?

<h3 id="lea-michele-is-reaching-out-to-cast-members-after-mocking-transgender-model-allegations">&ldquo;Lea Michele Is ‘Reaching Out To Cast Members’ After Mocking Transgender Model Allegations&rdquo;</h3>

After transgender model Plastic Martyr spoke out about feeling mocked by the former “Glee” star at the Emmy Awards, the 33-year-old has reportedly been reaching out to former cast members to gain a better understanding of what she has done wrong.</p>
<p>After Michele shared a tweet condemning the events that lead to the death of a Minneapolis African American man George Floyd, her former co-star, Samantha Ware, called out the singer for not acknowledging her own unacceptable behavior.</p>
<p>Since then, others have spoken out about their unpleasant encounters with Michele. However, following Plastic Martyr’s allegations, sources told Access Hollywood that Michele is trying to learn from her mistakes.</p>
<p>“The LGBTQ community is one that is and always has been close to Lea’s heart, and her support for the LGBTQ community has been evident over the many years with the work she has done in public and in private supporting the community,” the insider said.</p>
<p>Those close to Michele went on to claim that she “is really taking this time to listen, to learn and to work on the changes she knows she wants and needs to make but mainly, she is listening to really taking all the feedback to heart. She is reaching out to cast members from her shows and listening.”</p>
<p>Plastic Martyr previously recalled her encounter with Michele at the Emmys. “She’s a very unpleasant person. Years ago we were at the Emmys and she happened to be there. I was still in the process of my transition and wasn’t 100% as ‘passable’ then,” she explained.</p>
<p>“I was in the bathroom and started washing my hands, and then said excuse me to her when trying to reach the soap, and she goes ‘Excuse me?! EXCUSE ME???? Excuse you &hellip; you realize you’re in the WOMEN’S bathroom.’ I remember going from feeling so beautiful that day to walking out of that bathroom feeling so self-conscious and embarrassed.”</p>
<p>Despite sharing the story about her encounter with Michele, Plastic Martyr insisted that she only wanted to educate others about the LGBTQ community and does not support the “cancel culture.”</p>

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/poltronavip.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/LEA-MICHELE-PLASTIC-TRASFOBIA.jpg?resize=1000%2C600&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
Plastic Martyr acusou Lea Michele de transfobia em comentário feito na última quarta-feira (03). A atriz, cantora e modelo trans contou que Michele teve comportamento preconceituoso no momento em que as duas se encontraram no banheiro de uma das edições da premiação Emmy Awards, quando Plastic ainda estava em transição.</p>
<p>“Eu estava no banheiro e comecei a lavar minhas mãos e pedi licença a ela quando eu estava tentando alcançar o sabonete. Ela disse: ‘Dá licença?! DÁ LICENÇA?! DÁ LICENÇA você… você percebeu que está no banheiro FEMININO&rsquo;”, relatou. “Eu lembro que estava me sentindo tão bonita naquele dia e saí do banheiro constrangida e envergonhada”, disse Plastic.</p>
<p>Na última segunda (01), Lea Michele foi acusada pela colega de elenco Samantha Ware de racismo. Ware contou que Michele fez a estreia dela na televisão um completo inferno e teve declaração apoiada e comentada por outros integrantes do seriado. Lea Michele foi à internet para se posicionar e se desculpar pelo comportamento na última quarta (03).</p>
<p>Lea Michele ainda não se posicionou sobre as acusações de transfobia.

<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/06/03/19/29184790-0-image-a-10_1591208599606.jpg" alt="img">
Broadway actor Gerard Canonico and others have joined the chorus of disapproval over the alleged bad behavior of Glee actress Lea Michele, after former co-star Samantha Ware claimed she made her life &lsquo;a living hell&rsquo; on set.</p>
<p>Canonico, 30, was an understudy in the original Broadway cast of Spring Awakening starring Michele and her BFF Jonathan Groff, and commented underneath Michele&rsquo;s apology Instagram post on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were nothing but a nightmare to me and fellow understudy cast members. You made us feel like we didn’t belong there,&rsquo; Canonico wrote in a comment on Instagram, which he had re-posted after claiming it had initially been deleted.</p>
<p>Under fire: Lea Michele (pictured in 2018) has been accused of yet more bad behaviour on set after posting an apology on Wednesday</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tried for years to be nice to you to no avail. Maybe actually apologize instead of placing the blame on how others &lsquo;perceive&rsquo; you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Many other comments took issue with the the apology, which saw the actress vow to &lsquo;be better in the future&rsquo; and admitted her &lsquo;privileged position and immaturity&rsquo; had contributed to causing pain to her former co-star.</p>
<p>Even Real Housewives of New York star Aviva Drescher had a story to tell, commenting: &lsquo;You were once very unkind to me so I am not surprised by your behavior. You shouldn&rsquo;t judge others before looking in the mirror.&rsquo;</p>
<p>TV and theater actress Emma Hunton - who also starred in Spring Awakening - chimed in saying: &lsquo;This isn&rsquo;t an apology.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Michele insisted she &lsquo;doesn&rsquo;t remember the specific statement&rsquo; of threatening to &lsquo;defecate in Samantha&rsquo;s wig&rsquo; during a prolonged period of bullying in 2015.</p>
<p>Claims: Broadway actor Gerard Canonico made his own claims commenting on Michele&rsquo;s apology on Instagram</p>
<p>Speaking out: Canonico, 30, was an understudy in the original Broadway cast of Spring Awakening starring Michele and her BFF Jonathan Groff</p>
<p>The pregnant star said she has &lsquo;never judged others by their background or color of their skin&rsquo;, but insisted she will learn from the mistakes she has made so she &lsquo;can be a real role model for my child&rsquo; when she gives birth in a couple of months.</p>
<p>Other comments left under Michele&rsquo;s post said: &lsquo;Saying you didn&rsquo;t do it is the worst apology I&rsquo;ve ever heard.&rsquo; Another said: &lsquo;This is a non-apology. You apologize for their &lsquo;perception&rsquo; of your behavior? There are multiple people speaking out about your racist micro-aggressions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The bullying allegations came to light after Michele took to social media last Friday to pay tribute to George Floyd, writing: &lsquo;George Floyd did not deserve this. This was not an isolated incident and it must end&rsquo; she wrote.</p>
<p>Not impressed: Actress Emma Hunton told Michele this was not an apology</p>
<p>Another non-fan: Even Real Housewives of New York star Aviva Drescher also had a story to tell</p>
<p>Ware, who appeared as Jane Hayward on the show&rsquo;s sixth season in 2015, swiftly hit back: &lsquo;Remember when you made my first television gig a living hell?!?!&hellip;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cause I&rsquo;ll never forget&hellip; I believe you told everyone that if you had the opportunity you would &lsquo;s*** in my wig!&rsquo; amongst other traumatic microaggressions that made me question a career in Hollywood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Michele statement reads in full: &lsquo;One of the most important lessons of the last few weeks is that we need to take the time to listen and learn about other people&rsquo;s perspectives and any role we have played or anything we can do to help address injustices they face&hellip;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will be better in the future&rsquo;: Lea Michele (left) has issued a public apology to Samantha Ware (right) amid claims she made her life &lsquo;a living hell&rsquo; during her stint on Glee</p>
<p>Hitting out: The actress, 33, admitted her &lsquo;privileged position and immaturity&rsquo; had contributed to causing pain to her former co-star, 28, in a statement posted to Instagram on Wednesday</p>
<p>&lsquo;When I tweeted the other day, it was meant to be a show of support for our friends and neighbours and communities of colour during this really difficult time&hellip;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But the responses I received to what I posted have made me also focus on how my own behaviour towards fellow cast members was perceived by them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;While I don&rsquo;t remember ever making this specific statement and I have never judged others by their background or color of their skin, that&rsquo;s not really the point, what matters is that I clearly acted in ways which hurt other people.</p>
<p>Speaking out: Samantha (pictured last month), who played Jane Hayward on the show, claimed the actress bullied her during her stint on Glee and even threatened to defecate &lsquo;in her wig&rsquo;</p>
<p>Tough times: Lea played the role of Rachel Berry (back row) on the show&rsquo;s six seasons, getting nominated for an Emmy and two Golden Globe awards with the part</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whether it was my privileged position and perspective that caused me to be perceived as insensitive or inappropriate at times or whether it was just my immaturity and me just being unnecessarily difficult.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lea - who played lead character Rachel Berry for the musical show&rsquo;s entire run - continued: &lsquo;I apologize for my behavior and for any pain which I have caused.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We all can grow and change and I have definitely used these past several months to reflect on my own shortcomings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am a couple of months from becoming a mother and I know I need to keep working to better myself and take responsibility for my actions, so that I can be a real role model for my child and so I can pass along my lessons and mistakes, so that they can learn from me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I listened to these criticisms and I am learning and while I am very sorry, I will be better in the future from this experience.&rsquo;</p>
<p>However, on Wednesday a former Glee producer claimed there were other actors working on the show who also were problematic.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m all for calling out bad behavior and even for some schadenfreude when that behavior is punished,&rsquo; Marti Noxon wrote in a since-deleted tweet on Wednesday. &lsquo;That said, on GLEE there were LOTS of bad actors. Who were NOT women. People in the industry know who I&rsquo;m talking about. Why aren&rsquo;t we calling them out?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She followed it up with, &lsquo;It seems to me that women are the first to go under the bus. But a lot of males get away with being the bullies-in-chief. How come we let them get away with it? Maybe it&rsquo;s because as long as they earn someone money, they get a pass.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Glee&rsquo;s Amber Riley, 34, revealed on Instagram Live Wednesday that Michele had contacted her for the first time in more than two years to discuss the issue - but that it wasn&rsquo;t a priority amid the turbulent times of social unrest in the wake of George Floyd&rsquo;s killing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t give a s*** about this Lea Michele thing - I really don&rsquo;t give a f***,&rsquo; said Riley, who said her priority right now was showing support to Black Lives Matter. &lsquo;People are out here dying and being murdered by police.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She added of the embattled Michele: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t give a s*** about this Lea Michele thing - I wish her well, I hope she has an amazing pregnancy, I hope that she has grown.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have no hatred or ill will on that end &hellip; this is the first and last time I&rsquo;m going to say something&rsquo; on the matter, she said.</p>
<p>Details: Glee&rsquo;s Amber Riley, 34, revealed on Instagram Live Wednesday that Michele had contacted her for the first time in more than two years to discuss the issue - but that it wasn&rsquo;t a priority amid the turbulent times of social unrest in the wake of George Floyd&rsquo;s killing</p>
<p>Shock: Her statement comes after she was fired by HelloFresh due to the scandal
