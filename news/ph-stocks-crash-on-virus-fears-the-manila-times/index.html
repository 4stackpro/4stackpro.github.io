The stock market plunged on Monday as reports of rising cases of the new coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) spooked investors, sending the bourse back to the 6,300-territory, the lowest in four years.

The benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEi) crashed 6.76 percent or 457.77 points to close at 6,312.61, while the wider All Shares dropped by 5.55 percent or 224.33 points to finish at 3,815.22.





This was the lowest close since Jan. 26, 2016, when the main index settled at 6,311.60. It was also the biggest one-day drop in terms of percentage since Oct. 27, 2008 at 12.27 percent.

The benchmark index has declined by 1,502.65 points or 19.23 percent year-to-date.

PSEi has gone down by over 30 percent — signaling a bearish sentiment — from its all-time high of 9,058.62, notched on Jan. 29, 2018. Bear market occurs when equities fall by 20 percent from the recent high.

“The main culprit for the major sell-off is the mounting Covid-19 infections in the Philippines,” Philstocks Financial Inc. research analyst Japhet Tantiangco said, noting that the outbreak could weigh on tourism, foreign trade and investments, and supply chains, among others.

The Department of Health confirmed that there were additional 10 cases of Covid-19 in the country, bringing the total to 20. It has raised public alarm, as well, because some of the cases were now spread via local transmission.

Across the world, the Covid-19 outbreak paralyzed the tourism and travel sector, causing worries over its full impact on the economy. The epidemic has triggered a massive sell-off across bourses, as investors went to safe haven assets like gold and yen.

Equity markets collapsed on Monday as the rapidly spreading coronavirus fanned fears for the global economy, while a crash in oil prices added to the panic, with energy firms taking a hammering and wiping hundreds of billions off valuations.

As the deadly disease claims more lives around the world, dealers are shedding riskier assets for safe havens, sending gold and the yen surging and pushing United States Treasury yields to record lows.

While governments and central banks have unleashed or prepared stimulus measures, the spread of Covid-19 has put a huge strain on economies and stoking concerns of a worldwide recession.

Energy firms were slammed, with Hong Kong-listed CNOOC Ltd. tumbling 17 percent, PetroChina going down by 9 percent and Inpex in Tokyo dipping by 13 percent. In Sydney, Santos dived 30 percent and Woodside Petroleum tanked 18.4 percent, while BHP was more than 14 percent down.

“Plummeting oil prices and spreading coronavirus are fanning fears of downside risks to the global economy,” said Takuya Kanda at the Gaitame.com Research Institute.

Meanwhile, Diversified Securities trader Aniceto Pangan said the recent cut in oil prices also prompted selling pressure on Monday.

Driving the declines was a ferocious sell-off in the oil markets, sparked by top exporter Saudi Arabia slashing prices — in some cases to unprecedented levels — after a bust-up with Russia over production, launching a so-called “oil war.”

US and regional markets were not spared.

Wall Street ended in the red again. Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq slipped by 0.98 percent, 1.71 percent and 1.87 percent, respectively.

In Asia, Tokyo plunged 5.07 percent; Shanghai, 3.01 percent; Hong Kong, 4.29 percent; Seoul, 4.19 percent; Jakarta, 5.07 percent; Singapore, 5.57 percent; Vietnam, 6.34 percent; and Thailand, 6.77 percent.

In Manila, all sectors ended in a bloodbath, with financials and services taking the biggest hit at 8.56 percent and 6.70 percent, respectively.

Around 1.15 billion shares were traded for P6.3 billion.

Losers led winners by a wide margin, 204-30, while 23 issues did not change hands.

Timson Securities trader Darren Pangan pegged the immediate and secondary support level at 6,250 and 6,080 marks, respectively.

Analysts warned of further gyrations, as the outbreak shows no sign of abating, with more than 110,000 people infected in scores of countries.

Italy, which is now the hardest-hit country outside China, has put a quarter of its population in lockdown, while sporting and public events around the world have been canceled.

“You just don’t know which way things are going to go, it makes it very hard to price anything right now,” said Sarah Hunter, chief economist for BIS Oxford Economics on Bloomberg TV.

“We’re seeing that in the market with the wild oscillations that are coming through,” she added.
