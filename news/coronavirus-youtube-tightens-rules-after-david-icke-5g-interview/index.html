Image copyright YouTube Image caption A lengthy interview with David Icke was live-streamed on YouTube on Monday</p>
<p>YouTube has banned all conspiracy theory videos falsely linking coronavirus symptoms to 5G networks.</p>
<p>The Google-owned service will now delete videos violating the policy. It had previously limited itself to reducing the frequency it recommended them in its Up Next section.</p>
<p>The move follows a live-streamed interview with conspiracy theorist David Icke on Monday, in which he had linked the technology to the pandemic.</p>
<p>YouTube said the video would be wiped.</p>
<p>During the interview, Mr Icke falsely claimed there &ldquo;is a link between 5G and this health crisis&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And when asked for his reaction to reports of 5G masts being set on fire in England and Northern Ireland, he responded: &ldquo;If 5G continues and reaches where they want to take it, human life as we know it is over&hellip; so people have to make a decision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several users subsequently called for further attacks on 5G towers in the comments that appeared alongside the feed.</p>
<p>Mr Icke also claimed that a coronavirus vaccine, when one is developed, would include &ldquo;nanotechnology microchips&rdquo; that would allow humans to be controlled. He added that Bill Gates - who is helping fund Covid-19 vaccine research - should be jailed. His views went unchallenged for much of the two-and-a-half-hour show.</p>
<p>Policy violation</p>
<p>The interview was watched by about 65,000 people as it was streamed, some of whom clicked an on-screen button to trigger payments to make their live chat reactions stand out.</p>
<p>YouTube only deleted the content after the session had ended, despite being aware of the broadcast while it was ongoing.</p>
<p>It changed its rules after the BBC questioned why the video was permitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have clear policies that prohibit videos promoting medically unsubstantiated methods to prevent the coronavirus in place of seeking medical treatment, and we quickly remove videos violating these policies when flagged to us,&rdquo; a spokeswoman for YouTube told the BBC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now any content that disputes the existence or transmission of Covid-19, as described by the WHO [World Health Organization] and local health authorities is in violation of YouTube policies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This includes conspiracy theories which claim that the symptoms are caused by 5G.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For borderline content that could misinform users in harmful ways, we reduce recommendations. We&rsquo;ll continue to evaluate the impact of these videos on communities around the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Users who repeatedly break the rules now face being prevented from being able to use YouTube&rsquo;s Live tool.</p>
<p>The firm may also prevent repeat offenders from earning money, and said it would terminate channels as a last resort.</p>
<p>In this case, YouTube is allowing the interview&rsquo;s host to keep earnings generated via the Super Chats tool while the video was still online.</p>
<p>But it is giving its own cut of the proceeds to charity, and has put the channel involved under review.</p>
<p>WhatsApp restriction</p>
<p>YouTube&rsquo;s rules update coincides with new restrictions on WhatsApp.</p>
<p>Image copyright Reuters Image caption WhatsApp is taking action to slow the spread of misinformation on its network</p>
<p>Facebook&rsquo;s app is limiting users to only being able to forward a message to one chat at a time if the same post has already been shared five or more times by the wider community. Such posts are labelled with double arrows to make their status known.</p>
<p>Previously, the app had limited such messages to being forwarded to five different chats at once - a limit it had first introduced in 2018 to combat the spread of disinformation in India.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve recently seen a significant increase in the amount of forwarding, which users have told us can feel overwhelming and can contribute to the spread of misinformation,&rdquo; it said, explaining the latest move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We believe it&rsquo;s important to slow the spread of these messages down to keep WhatsApp a place for personal conversation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfounded theories</p>
<p>Conspiracy theories linking 5G signals to the coronavirus pandemic continue to spread despite there being no evidence the mobile phone signals pose a health risk.</p>
<p>Fact-checking charity Full Fact has linked the claims to two flawed theories.</p>
<p>Image copyright Reuters Image caption Vodafone and Three have reported attacks on their telecoms equipment over recent days</p>
<p>One falsely suggests 5G suppresses the immune system, the other falsely claims the virus is somehow using the network&rsquo;s radio waves to communicate and pick victims, accelerating its spread.</p>
<p>While 5G uses different radio frequencies to its predecessors, it&rsquo;s important to recognise that the waveband involved is still &ldquo;non-ionising&rdquo;, meaning it lacks enough energy to break apart chemical bonds in the DNA in our cells to cause damage.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, scientists at the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection completed a major study of related research into the topic.</p>
<p>While it recommended slightly tighter limits on the transmitting capabilities of handsets themselves to minimise any chance of damage caused by human tissue being heated, its key finding was that there was no evidence that either 5G networks or earlier systems could cause cancer or other kinds of illness.</p>
<p>The second theory appears to be based on the work of a Nobel Prize-winning biologist who suggested bacteria could generate radio waves.</p>
<p>But this remains a controversial idea and well outside mainstream scientific thought. In any case, Covid-19 is a virus rather than a bacteria.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s another major flaw with both these theories. Coronavirus is spreading in UK cities where 5G has yet to be deployed, and in countries like Japan and Iran that have yet to adopt the technology.

<h3 id="youtube-censors-popular-david-icke-interview-which-had-339000-views-in-30-minutes">YouTube censors popular David Icke interview which had 339,000 views in 30 minutes</h3>

<p>Digital rights groups and internet users have warned that many of the changes that are being ushered in as a response to the coronavirus are infringing on people’s civil liberties.</p>
<p>And now YouTube has set a new chilling precedent in this area by removing a popular interview with author and public speaker David Icke from the London Real YouTube channel which was titled “DAVID ICKE – THE CORONAVIRUS CONSPIRACY: HOW COVID-19 WILL SEIZE YOUR RIGHTS &amp; DESTROY OUR ECONOMY”</p>
<p>London Real produces in-depth interviews with a diverse range of guests and Icke has been on the show multiple times.</p>
<p>His last interview with London Real on March 18 is currently the channel’s most popular video with 4.9 million views.</p>

<p>The video that YouTube removed was on track to reach similar levels of popularity and had amassed 339,000 total views and 64,000 peak concurrent live viewers, despite being online for just 30 minutes before it was deleted.</p>
<p>London Real’s founder and host Brian Rose added that a one hour version of the video was subsequently uploaded but that too was deleted after accumulating 50,000 views.</p>
<p>YouTube said the video was deleted as part of a newly introduced rule where: “Any content that disputes the existence or transmission of Covid-19, as described by the WHO [World Health Organization] and local health authorities is in violation of YouTube policies. This includes conspiracy theories which claim that the symptoms are caused by 5G.”</p>
<p>Ironically, the WHO, which is now being used as the gold standard of truth when it comes to claims about the transmission of the coronavirus on YouTube, has previously amplified Chinese propaganda about there being “no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus.”</p>
<p>Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China🇨🇳. pic.twitter.com/Fnl5P877VG — World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) January 14, 2020</p>
<p>Research has shown that China’s attempts to downplay and deflect blame for the coronavirus instead of introducing early preventative measures has had serious consequences when it comes to the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>A study at the University of Southampton predicted that if China had introduced measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus three weeks earlier, there could have been a 95% reduction in global coronavirus cases.</p>
<p>Terrible. We desperately need accurate reporting from China. The pandemic originated in Wuhan &amp; was initially covered up by Chinese authorities. University of Southampton study found there would have been a 95% REDUCTION in cases &amp; less spread if Beijing intervened 3 wks sooner. https://t.co/YJRCxYH5Sa — Jonathan Swan (@jonathanvswan) March 18, 2020</p>
<p>Under YouTube’s new rule, it appears that misinformation from health authorities such as the WHO will go unpunished while opinions about the coronavirus from others will be slapped down.</p>
<p>After YouTube removed the David Icke interview, video-sharing platform Vimeo also deleted the video from its platform.</p>
<p>Explosive David Icke coronavirus video now deleted by Vimeo as well as YouTube. What don&rsquo;t they want you to know? Watch here and please share with everyone you know and ask them to do the same https://t.co/zFiKFf5Vak pic.twitter.com/cpG852ITAF — David Icke (@davidicke) April 7, 2020</p>
<p>However, the interview is still available on the London Real website and peer-to-peer video sharing platform BitChute.</p>
<p>London Real’s founder and host Brian Rose slammed the takedown of the David Icke interview in a series of YouTube videos.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe everything that David says, I don’t agree with everything he says but I will defend his right to say it to the death,” Rose said. “We should allow people to speak their minds period, period. When we shut that down, we’ve got a massive problem with who we are, who we think we are, or who we tell our kids that we are.”</p>
<p>Rose added the popularity of the video clearly shows that “people want this content” and pointed to UK media watchdog The Office of Communications‘ (OFCOM) recent threats to British media about mentioning links between 5G and the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Additionally, he said that his entire business relies on YouTube and that if London Real gets taken off YouTube, “it will not exist anymore.”</p>
<p>Rose was also critical of YouTube, a platform he has worked with for more than eight years, for talking to the press without giving London Real any explanation about why the video was removed.</p>
<p>“You tell the BBC you’re going to take my video off and why but you don’t tell me,” Rose said. “I still don’t know why.”</p>
<p>The ban on content that disputes the existence or transmission of the coronavirus as described by health authorities sets a worrying precedent as these health authorities have been shown to get many things wrong about the coronavirus including information on the effectiveness of masks and the dangers of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Not only does this mean misinformation from these health authorities is amplified but it’s also creating a two-class system where independent creators and small businesses are suppressed while legacy media outlets and authorities get preferential treatment, even if they’re spreading information that is later discovered to be incorrect or harmful.
