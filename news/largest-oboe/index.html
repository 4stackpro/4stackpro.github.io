<p>The Week in Review: Summer of Change</p>
<p>After 12 issues of &ldquo;The Week in Hope-Inspiring Spontaneous Music Online,&rdquo; and as the country continues to re-open, we now shift our weekly roundup to &ldquo;The Week in Review: Summer of Change.&rdquo; Throughout the summer, let Violinist.com be your guide as we discover the creative ways artists, students, venues, and festivals are coping with the pandemic’s aftermath.</p>
<p>We’ll continue to bring you wonderful online offerings. We’ll take a look at smaller, more intimate performances taking place within social-distancing guidelines. We’ll share innovative ways teachers are keeping their studios in tact and students are reacting to the challenges of online learning. And, later this summer, we’ll provide a glimpse of a few select online music camps and take you into the virtual classroom with some of the world’s biggest stars of the concert stage.</p>
<hr>
<p>As a proud mom of a college graduate, I remember the pomp and circumstance of my child’s commencement. I loved hearing the live orchestra and the wonderful speakers. And it was a thrill to watch the mortar boards sailing through the sky. But what did college graduation look like in the world of COVID-19? Leave it to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to come up with something that was exemplary and meaningful. Comusica, a participatory music experience that was the centerpiece of MIT’s graduation ceremony, features the voices of more than 800 MIT graduates and alumni, &ldquo;stitched together into one of the largest crowd-sourced pieces of music ever undertaken.&rdquo; (I’ve been told these hundreds of video submissions were collected from students, each singing a single note.)</p>
<p>From Memphis, Tennessee to Salzburg, Austria, 21 young violinists got together to play &ldquo;Meditation&rdquo; from Jules Massenet’s Thais, or what I call &ldquo;The Violinists’ National Anthem.&rdquo; The common thread amongst these students is a prior music camp experience, be it at Meadowmount, Bowdoin, or another professional-bound experience. (While they can’t get together in person this summer, these creative campers still managed to create this beautiful collage.)</p>
<p>Cellist Jonah Kim, pianist Sean Kennard, and San Francisco Ballet dancer Julia Rowe used The Palace of the Fine Arts as a stunning backdrop for their socially-distanced performance of Franz Schubert’s &ldquo;Auf dem Wasser zu singen.&rdquo; Sean recorded his piano track, then it was played while Jonah and Julia performed live to a small outdoor audience. As Jonah states, &ldquo;I couldn’t believe how many people stayed for additional takes, even though we took significant breaks in between to review. I think everyone is starved for art!&rdquo; (Jonah, I agree!)</p>
<p>I’m not sure it would have happened regardless of COVID-19, but I’m definitely hearing more music by living composers than ever before. And I love it. Here, violin/piano duo Yang and Olivia play a live-streamed premiere of Dr. Michael Daughtery’s &ldquo;Summer Rains.&rdquo; (I, for one, am thrilled to hear wonderful new pieces being added to the violin repertoire.)</p>
<p>Conductor, teacher, and doctoral student Christina Bishop put together a presentation on composer/conductor/musician Nadia Boulanger. Forced to create her presentation while in quarantine, she creatively decided to enlist some &ldquo;helpers&rdquo; — her four young sons. (If you have children at home, or even if you don’t, please watch this. I promise you’ll be moved.)</p>
<p>Cellist Yves Dharamraj performs a stunning five-cello arrangement of &ldquo;When I am laid in earth&rdquo; from Henry Purcell&rsquo;s Dido and Aeneas as part of Anthony McGill’s #TakeTwoKnees challenge. As one commenter wrote: &ldquo;Beautiful and truly moving. As a cellist, but mainly a human being, I thank you.&rdquo; (Yves, we thank you as well.)</p>
<p>In one of those magical moments, two artists previously featured in an issue of this column connected: violist Scott Slapin and ViolaPower’s Ronald Houston. Ron asked Scott to create an educational presentation for his violin/viola students, which now exists as &ldquo;The Greatest Hits from the Twenties: 500 Years of Music History and the Viola.&rdquo; From his home studio in western Massachusetts, Scott gave this talk via Zoom for Ron&rsquo;s students in Texas. The presentation was followed by a question-and-answer session. (Bravo to you both for creating this unique cross-country connection!)</p>
<p>Dr. Psyche Loui, Longwood Symphony Orchestra violinist and Suzuki mom, is joined by her daughter in a wonderful rendition of &ldquo;Twinkle, Twinkle.&rdquo; The duo demonstrates my personal belief that you can never take too much time to figure out where the third finger should be placed on a new string, nor is it ever too early to take two knees. (Precious!)</p>
<p>Cellist David Lockington plays the Sarabande from J.S. Bach’s Cello Suite No. 3. If you think you know David as Maestro Lockington, you would be correct. He leads numerous ensembles, including the Pasadena Symphony and Pops. Here we see the Maestro’s more personal side. (And, may I just say, the man can play!)</p>
<p>In a continuation of our coverage of New York Philharmonic Principal Clarinetist Anthony McGill’s #TakeTwoKnees challenge, we present a tour de force of black wind and brass players from a variety of U.S. orchestras and university faculties. For this stellar performance of the Black National Anthem, arranged by Fred Onovwerosuoke, featured are Demarre McGill (Seattle Symphony Orchestra, Principal Flute), Ebonee Thomas (The Dallas Opera, Second Flute/Piccolo), Titus Underwood (Nashville Symphony, Principal Oboe), Geoffrey Johnson (Detroit Symphony Orchestra, Acting Second Oboe), Anthony McGill (New York Philharmonic, Principal Clarinet), Alex Laing (Phoenix Symphony, Principal Clarinet), Andrew Brady (Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, Principal Bassoon), Marlene Ngalissamy (Marlboro Music Festival &amp; Curtis Institute 2020), Anthony Parnther (San Bernardino &amp; Southeast Symphony, Conductor, Contrabassoonist), Jeffrey Scott (Oberlin College &amp; Conservatory Professor of Horn, Imani Winds), Amanda Collins (University of Missouri, Assistant Professor of Horn), Priscilla Rinehart (Sarasota Orchestra, Second Horn), and Adedeji Ogunfolu (Pacific Symphony, Second Horn). (Honestly, it doesn’t get any better than this.)</p>
<p>And now, our grand finale. My last public outing prior to the lockdown was a chorus rehearsal of Nkeiru Okoye’s powerful opera Harriet Tubman. The 13-voice choral ensemble had been rehearsing since January and I was thrilled to be in the cast. The excitement in my town for the early May performances of this inspirational opera was palpable. The letdown when we learned it would be postponed was dramatic. Yet I fervently believe the resounding chorus of &ldquo;Keep on going&rdquo; from the opera’s climax could not be more relevant today. American Opera Project (producer of the original production) in partnership with The Brooklyn Hospital Center in Fort Greene (BrRIC) brought together cast members from AOP’s 2014 world premiere, the pandemic-postponed 2020 production at Knoxville Opera, and guests to sing these words attributed to Harriet Tubman as a new message of hope. Their moving dedication is shown at the end of the clip. Performers include: Sumayya Ali, Janinah Burnett, Charles Carter, Christiana Cole, Vincent Davis, Sequina DuBose, Patrice Eaton, Hannah Fuerst, Kyle Guglielmo, Mila Henry (piano), Briana Hunter, Ernest Jackson, Cornelius Johnson, Tesia Kwarteng, Jasmine Muhammad, Damian Norfleet, Jubilant Sykes, Leslie Tay, Louise Toppin, Julius Williams (conductor). (I know that all of us in Knoxville maintain our commitment and enthusiasm for bringing this production to Tennessee as soon as possible!)</p>
<p>With large-scale concerts and symphony performances almost universally on hiatus, we&rsquo;ve put &ldquo;The Week in Reviews&rdquo; on hold and instead bring you this roundup of “summer of change&rdquo; activities. If you’d like to share links of socially-distanced performances, teaching experiences, camps, or master classes you’ve enjoyed, please do so in the comments or e-mail me for possible inclusion in a later opus.</p>

<h3 id="the-national-youth-orchestra-of-canada-canadas-orchestra-career-launch-pad">&ldquo;The National Youth Orchestra Of Canada: Canada’s Orchestra Career Launch Pad&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.ludwig-van.com/toronto/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/06/NYOC-feature-image.jpg" alt="img">
We often look back into youthful summer days with memories of slow daydreams extending right into the late nights with barely set sun, time relaxed and soaked with unstructured freedom. However, for the past 60 years, summer with National Youth Orchestra of Canada meant the polar opposite — a calendar full of bursting schedules and an annual grand orchestral tour, squeezing in practice whenever one can, with sleep that is way too short. This special program has been the centre of so many Canadian orchestral musicians’ lives, yet many have yet to hear about it. What is NYO Canada and how has it shaped our national and individual identities in Canadian classical music?</p>
<p>Gathering budding musicians from age 16-28 across the nation, National Youth Orchestra of Canada (NYO Canada), is one of our best national nurturing programs available for young Canadians.</p>
<p>The competition is fierce — in recent sessions, nearly 100 musicians (the exact numbers vary but the minimum is set at 92 members) were chosen from 500+ applications, for multi-dimensional orchestral training as documented in That Higher Level (2018, directed by John Bolton, for the National Film Board).</p>
<p>Founded in 1960 by Walter Susskind (1913-1980), the program initially focused on young musicians exploring symphonic program, with a short concert tour within selected regions of Canada. Early members remember that certain difficult works were presented only at the very final concert. The Short Sweet Summer (1963, produced by Norman Campbell), an in-depth CBC documentary of the 1963 session gives a lovely insight to NYOC’s early days.</p>
<p>Since then, NYO Canada has morphed into a comprehensive program, covering various subjects, including a chamber music program, orchestra-specific topics from business skills to audition preparation, and various health-related topics including physical and mental wellness programs, in addition to traditional training and the presentation of large-scale symphonic works. NYOC records at least one full length album every year, available through SoundCloud, and has been nominated for a Juno (Mahler’s 6th Symphony and Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring, 2009).</p>
<p>NYO Canada programs two large orchestral works, a concerto tied to the Michael Measure Prize, and one Canadian annual commission through a partnership with SOCAN; shorter works are then selected to complement these core selections. Past favourites include works by Mahler, Ravel, Stravinsky and Strauss, giving participants an experience of some of the richest works in the standard orchestral repertoire.</p>
<p>NYO Canada covers most of the costs related to the program (food and housing at the training location, and travel and accommodation during the tour), which is a great relief to the young musicians, as higher music training bills can adds up fast — from accessing and maintaining appropriate instruments to insurances, travelling, lessons, and often even to renting an appropriate practice space. The billing list is endless.</p>
<p>The musicians are responsible for their travel cost to/from the session, and food costs during the tour.To help cover these costs, a $1,200 Achievement Award is given to members after successful completion of the program. There are also additional prizes. the Canada Council for the Arts Michael Measures Prize, and NYO Canada Award of Excellence.</p>
<p>The annual audition portal is open from October to the end of January with a varying fee scale. Audition repertoire is specified per instrument, and applicants upload their video audition through YouTube. NYO Canada requires the auditionees to play without accompaniment, and that all materials should be played in the order specified, in a single take.</p>
<p>When the selected works have been rehearsed and refined, the musicians present the program to the general public in a tour (in the early days, certain works — particularly difficult works — were presented only once, at the final concert). This is significant, as it gives individuals an opportunity to overcome the challenges unique to live performances, including performance anxiety, acoustic variations and other logistical changes, as well as giving the orchestra an opportunity to refine itself as an ensemble.</p>
<p>So far, the largest Canadian tour was the 2017 Edges of Canada Tour. As part of Canada’s sesquicentennial signature event, NYO Canada toured Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto, Charlottetown, Halifax, Winnipeg, Saskatoon, Edmonton, Whitehorse, Nanaimo and Vancouver over 25 days.</p>
<p>The first international tour was in 1996 (Japan), and there were numerous visits to the United States (2008, 2011 and 2012). In 2013, selected 2012 participants toured to India for an international collaboration, and the most recent overseas touring regimen started in 2016 to Portugal, 2018 to Germany and Scotland, and in 2019, the Odyssey Tour to Spain, alongside hosting the European Union Youth Orchestra in Canada for the Frenergy Tour.</p>
<p>Jonathan Welmers – Director of Tours and Production</p>
<p>At the heart of this huge logistical puzzle is Jonathan Welmers, Director of Tours and Production, working for NYO Canada since late 2007. For the European portion of last year’s tour, Jonathan organized 101 seat bookings and over 122 check-in instruments and equipment (and an additional 75 instruments as hand luggage — this is ‘per leg’ of the journey — as well as having a key role in curating 9 days of Canadian experience for the 35 visiting EUYO members for Frenergy. Jonathan’s dedication — including learning everyone’s name for every session — is much appreciated and loved by all participants.</p>
<p>“The role I am currently in has sort of morphed from its original place of being a real logistics person (tour manager),” says Jonathan. “When I originally came to the job, I was coming from a production background doing indie rock shows around Toronto. It was a company that attempted to give a leg up to musicians who couldn’t go out and rent a bar and sort of hedged the risk across multiple bands. The company did shows initially just in Toronto, then expanded to Ontario, Canada, and then the US over a period of years. I saw the (NYO Canada) job listed on work in culture and applied… My classical background was nil at that time, but I managed to convince the organization that learning an orchestral plot would be easy enough to learn, but that relationship building and an agility of thinking was perhaps ultimately [what] would make someone good at the job.”</p>
<p>Working closely with both staff and participants, Jonathan is keenly aware of the importance of the program and the subsequent adaptation needs for the program. “I was never good enough to get into a program like NYO, so getting to experience it on the other side is a privilege,” says Jonathan. Seeing the participants’ passion up close, year after year, Jonathan is motivated to prove that, “The hype was worth it, so to speak.” A typical day can include a full concert day (10 a.m.-11.30 p.m.) in Ottawa, then loading the truck and driving through the night (11.30 p.m.-4 a.m.) to Toronto, for the load to be transferred from Toronto to Berlin, just in time for a rehearsal and a concert in Berlin.</p>
<p>He considers NYO Canada as a life-changing experience, “…not because of anything I think per se, but because every single person I’ve spoken to years and decades after their NYO experience tell me that.” He encourages young musicians to keep auditioning, even if one does not get in for many years. “I know players who failed many times and then got in. I’ve seen players go from the #1 auditionee one year, to #6 the next year, not because they got worse, but others got better. NYO is a real meritocracy, and as such, you always have a chance.”</p>
<p>The NYOC – A Big Part of Canada’s Orchestral Fabric</p>
<p>Through last 60 years’ programming, NYO Canada has touched many lives, and about a third of current Canadian professional orchestral players are NYO Canada alums. How did NYO Canada impact the individual lives? Each of these experiences is so personal and amazing, especially for Frank Morphy and Ed Tait — it was not only a chance for refinement, but a total and complete revelation.</p>
<p>Frank and Daniel Morphy</p>
<p>Frank Morphy joined NYO Canada in its very first year, 1960. Having started on trombone in grade 9, Frank switched out to oboe on his teacher’s request. “My music teacher asked me if I would try the oboe — I really did not know what it was, but I said yes, as long as I could go back… when I wanted to go back to trombone, he said no, and instead, he found a teacher for me.” After a year or so of lessons, Frank’s oboe teacher left the RCAF band. “Then I was pretty much left on my own, and self-taught. I did buy some records, and did a lot of listening,” says Frank.</p>
<p>Frank cannot remember how he heard about the Christmas 1960 NYO Session. “I don’t remember any audition. I arrived to find six of us, and I was in awe of them all — they all played so much better than me… it was a huge orchestra, with six players in each wind section.”</p>
<p>By the 1964 session, Frank was still without a teacher, but through NYO, he met Perry Bauman playing with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, and he started to travel once a month from Ottawa to study with him. For the 1964-66 sessions, he remembers staying at Burwash Hall, Victoria College, University of Toronto, and playing under the batons of Walter Susskind, Franz Paul Dekker, Victor Feldbrill and John Avison. “NYO game me an appreciation of orchestra playing, and the beginning of what might be involved,” says Frank.</p>
<p>Once Frank graduated from University of Toronto, he played a few years with the National Ballet Orchestra, then won his position with the Toronto Symphony in 1972 until he retired in 2011. And Daniel, his son, grew up watching Frank play with TSO as a child.</p>
<p>It was a very proud moment for the family when junior made it to the orchestra 46 years later. “I’ve looked up to my dad a lot, especially when I started preparing for university and decided that I wanted to be a professional musician,” says Dan. “I wanted to do the same things he did, so I was getting the same type of training he did. I was just excited that I got into NYO and that I was able to do the same thing he did when he was my age.”</p>
<p>Dan’s first instrument was piano, but soon, he wanted to be a drummer in a band. So he joined the school band in grade 5 to sit on a drum kit. The kit lessons then expanded in exploring the wide world of percussion, and when he was 17, Dan started to study with John Rudolph (current NYO Canada faculty), and in 2006, Dan was accepted to NYO Canada on his second application — he remembers that there was definitely a Bach transcription on the audition material.</p>
<p>“My summer at NYO was incredible,” says Dan. The training base was in Montreal that year, and Dan cherished the chance to live and experience one of his favourite cities to date. “Building a wall of coffee cups in the percussion section, staying all night out by the fire pit at the Fairmont Le Manoir Richelieu during a tour stop… some of my closest friends I made during that time, and those I may have met before, strengthened my relationship with them for sure,” says Dan.</p>
<p>Dan had a quite a good performance story as well.</p>
<p>“We were playing Don Quixote, and in this particular variation Don Quixote and his sidekick Sancho are “flying” through the air on a magical horse, blindfolded. The music to me also sounds very storm like (it helps there is also a wind machine, along with rushes of strings and winds) and it just so happened that there was also a lightning storm happening right outside the theatre. Precisely when we arrived at that part in the music, all the lights in the theatre went out, but everyone kept playing! throughout the minute-long sequence, the lights flickered once or twice, just long enough to see your music and also to see our conductor, Jaque Lacombe, conducting bigger and bigger (as if we could see him in the dark). When the section came to a close, the lights came back on and we finished the piece. No one got lost, no one stopped playing. we had actually played it from memory…in the dark. You can’t make that up.”</p>
<p>Having attended NYO Canada at age 21, learning to deal with several different personalities and tendencies, and owning up to the responsibility as a section, has been a valuable experience for Dan.</p>
<p>Gregory and Adrian Irvine</p>
<p>Gregory grew up in Middleton, Nova Scotia, and began to play music through his school program. “We started with recorders in the beginning of the year, then by Christmas, we were given instruments”. He was given a baritone in grade 6. his high school — one of the two well-established band programs in Nova Scotia at the time — got brand new euphoniums and Gregory really wanted to play the new shiny instrument. However, when he asked the teacher if he could play something ‘larger,’ alas, it was the tuba that was given to him. However, he quickly fell in love with the deep sound of tuba, and when he went to his first music camp in Mount Allison University at age 13, Gregory was truly hooked.</p>
<p>Gregory first heard about NYOC from an older student who was preparing for his NYO Canada audition on French horn. Back then, with no internet, there wasn’t an easy way to find out about NYO Canada, but he knew that it would be quite challenging as a tuba player. “There’s only one position, I knew it was hard. I wasn’t expecting to get in on my first year (at age 15). I just kept auditioning.”</p>
<p>In his time, the auditions were done through live recording. “Each year, the viola coach — Steve Kondacs, did a tour around the country, listening to, and recording auditions in various cities — mostly provincial capitals except when distances were too great. I auditioned in Halifax in a CBC Radio studio.”</p>
<p>The news came eventually. “I remember when I was 19, I had a summer job, pulling tree seedlings and putting them into buckets at a tree farm. We worked in all-weather conditions. And on the last day, unexpectedly, they gave us the pink slips.” Working for minimum wage, and now dismissed, Gregory felt quite low on his way home that day; however, when he got home, NYO Canada called him with news of acceptance and “… that saved me,” laughed Gregory.</p>
<p>His first year with NYO Canada was life-changing yet also quite intimidating. “Being from the Maritimes, I had a bit of an inferiority complex — typical at the time for Maritimers — and wondered if they had made a mistake! But I thrived, and was so inspired by great players and instructors,” says Gregory.</p>
<p>For the 1976 session in Quebec City, Gregory took an overnight train, “By then, I had a hard case made for band trips. It was a plywood box, made with 1/4-inch and lined with styrofoam. It was incredibly heavy, but at least it had wheels on it. I remember taking everything I owned — NYO Canada asked us to pack tux with bow tie, and I had a second-hand tux that I got from my band director — it was from 1940, it wasn’t in the style, but I took it.”</p>
<p>As a 19-year old, Gregory and age-appropriate friends frequently hung at the bar just outside of the residence. And he remembers lots of soccer playing and great conversations. In fact, it’s the summer conversations that led him to his next pursuit in brass pedagogy in the United States, studying with Arnold Jacobs and Rex Martin. Gregory returned to NYO Canada multiple times, and as a professional, he went on to play with the Hamilton Philharmonic Orchestra for 11 years, and then joined faculty at the University of Prince Edward Island in 1990. He just recently retired last year after teaching there for 29 years. For NYO Canada, he served as staff member for 12 years (1979-1991), and is currently on the board of directors.</p>
<p>Adrian started on violin at age 3 (his mom is a violinist, and Adrian wanted to be like the older ‘cool kids’ that she taught at home). On one unsuspecting afternoon, Adrian was given a full-on NYO Canada application pitch on his way back home from a lesson. “Dad would drive me to lessons in Halifax once a month, and at the time, NYO Canada’s age limit started at age 16. My birthday is in July, so I was 15 when this happened.” He wasn’t keen at the beginning, but Adrian decided to apply. His first application was recorded by proctor — his dad, at University of PEI. “I don’t know if it was more or less nerve-wrecking to have my dad as proctor,” Adrian laughs. Adrian’s acceptance for NYO Canada was a proud moment for Gregory, and Adrian went on to return two more times.</p>
<p>In his first year, Adrian and bunch of 16-year olds were extra violins — they didn’t get a placement in traditional string quartets for chamber sessions. Instead, they were given a unique opportunity to explore Bartok duets, Telemann works for 4 violins, and Steve Reich’s Violin Phase. “Greg Oh approached us for the Violin Phase — at this point, I haven’t really experienced or played Reich, so it was a totally new experience. We played the 4-person version and the amount of focus shifting required for phase shifting, entry points, and walking across the stage to get to the ‘right’ score — all this was a total mind bender,” says Adrian. And Adrian consider this as a pivotal point where he got more interested in extended techniques with technology and composition.</p>
<p>Along with his lifelong friends met in NYO Canada, Adrian considers NYO Canada as one of the core experiences that has shaped him into the musician he is today.</p>
<p>“I was 16 in my first summer with the NYOC and was just about to enter my final year of high school. It was perfect timing for me to see so many dedicated young musicians at various stages of education and careers. There were people just starting their undergrads, people already auditioning for professional orchestras, and everything in between. It was incredibly eye opening to see what was involved at every stage and definitely made a future in orchestral playing feel more tangible.”</p>
<p>The Wiebe Family – Peter, Sarah, Evan and Kathryn</p>
<p>With choral conducting dad and pianist/composer mother, Peter Wiebe grew up with music in the house. Initially starting on the violin, Peter fell in love with the cello at age 9, listening to Beethoven’s 5th Symphony, second movement, and switched instrument.</p>
<p>“I started to audition for NYO Canada in 1980, and made it for 1982,” says Peter. For the auditions, Peter remember going to someone’s house, where NYO Canada had arranged for a recording session, and doing a paper-based application. For those early days, Peter remembers NYO doing smaller tours, mostly on buses, playing at local school gyms and town halls. Citing Death and Transfiguration in a Vancouver concert under the baton of Kazuyoshi Akiyama as one of the most memorable moments, Peter took a job at the Windsor Symphony as core member in 1987. He has also been busy on the podium as the associate conductor of the WS, and only recently has stepped down from conducting the Windsor Youth Orchestra.</p>
<p>With his wife, Ruth Wieber, they have six children, and three of them — Sarah, Evan and Kathryn — have participated in NYO Canada. Sarah started violin and piano at age 5 at home. Though she enjoyed chamber music and orchestral playing through the violin, she always preferred the piano, and it wasn’t until grade 12 that she decided to apply for a university music program.</p>
<p>For her first application, Sarah travelled to Western University to do a proctor-run audition recording. Sarah remembers prepping excerpts from Der Heldenleben, Mahler 1 and Prokofiev’s Scythian Suite for the 2008 audition. When NYO Canada started to experiment with its chamber music program in 2009, Sarah was placed in a string quartet. “Unlike now, just a few students were enrolled in chamber music, so the schedule was quite crazy — we worked on the Haydn Sunrise String Quartet,” Sarah says.</p>
<p>“I used to do lots of things that Sarah did, and it would be a musically awesome experience — and it is free!” Evan says. With strong encouragement from parents and his older sister, Evan decided to apply for NYO Canada. Starting on the violin at age 5, Evan was asked to switch to cello, as there were ‘too many violins in the family (the other two boys, John and Andrew plays viola).’</p>
<p>The 2009 program included Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring with Alan Trudel — and this is Evan’s most memorable repertoire of the session; he also remembers many games of ultimate Frisbee and card games. Evan and Sarah also remembered that this was the first year of NYO Canada’s online streaming performance, and the recording session at McGill — and seeing the technical studio production side of it was another highlight for Evan (he now works for voices.com, one of the largest voice-over production companies). This particular recording, featuring Mahler’s 6th and the Rite, was nominated for the 2010 Junos.</p>
<p>Kathryn Wiebe remembers her 2010 audition as being quite tough. As part of the 50th anniversary, NYO Canada invited past alumni to rejoin the orchestra on stage. However, the perk of a big orchestra meant that Kathryn got to play extra lush programs — in fact, two programs, including Don Juan, Scheherazade, La Valse and Petrushka. In the 2011 tour, ‘Strike A Chord’, Kathryn vividly remembers Mahler 5 and Der Rosenkavalier as highlights. “I’m so glad to have experienced NYO Canada — it shaped me a lot and I confirmed my own passion for orchestral playing,” says Kathryn.</p>
<p>“One thing that I have come to value most in my work as a musician is the community that is built among my colleagues. From the good friends I made at NYO and school to those I have met on gigs, going to work often feels like a reunion of people that I enjoy being around and who inspire me both musically and in their personal lives. It is also extra special to show up to work and see one of my family members there; often there are hugs on stage and looks shared across the orchestra when we get to a part we both really enjoy playing. I am so grateful that my immediate family also gets to be part of my music family and vice-versa. It is one of the great joys of life!” adds Sarah.</p>
<p>Julia Wedman</p>
<p>“My dad was from a big family — 12 kids, and they all played something, and he thought it was very important that all kids get the chance to learn an instrument,” says Julia. Starting violin lessons at age 4, Julia first applied to NYO as a high school student from Saskatoon, where she was the concertmaster of the local youth orchestra. “I probably sent a cassette tape.”</p>
<p>Though she didn’t know much about the program when she initially applied, Julia’s participation in training orchestra (she later attended the World Youth Orchestra and the Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival Orchestra in Germany), allowed her to see the world. “One year, we took a 30-hour train ride from Vancouver to Toronto; it felt interminable at the time,” she remembers.</p>
<p>Along with intense professional training, Julia also got to experience the richness that orchestral life can bring — including the late night parties. “I loved getting the chance to hang out with wonderful musicians all day and night. I especially loved the late night jam sessions where people would just play together or for each other. There was something magical about that time of the day — people were relaxed and just happy to share music with each other,” says Julia. Her other highlights include coaching with Gwen Thompson, and making lifelong connections, including meeting cellist Felix Deak for the first time on a tour bus.</p>
<p>“You also learn how to deal with homesickness, you learn how to be resilient and overcome challenges, and you learn to find a place for yourself in the midst of this group of fantastic musicians, especially for people coming from smaller places. It is an invaluable experience.”</p>
<p>Matthew Ross</p>
<p>“One of my friends in middle school played the trumpet and I thought it was fun,” says Matthew. And ever since then, he’s been trying to figure the trumpet out. When Matthew left Bermuda to start university in 2009 at the Faculty of Music, University of Toronto, his teacher, Anita McAlister, encouraged him to audition for NYO Canada.</p>
<p>“I believe my first audition was at the University of Western Ontario — and it did not go that well… I procrastinated a lot during my first year of university, so I left my preparation that year to the real last minute. It wasn’t until my third year where I started to organize my time better, and I was waitlisted for 2012 session.” Then for 2013 session, the first year NYO started to accept video applications, Matthew took his take wearing baggy jeans and no shoes on the very last day before the deadline, and finally made it into his first NYO Canada session.</p>
<p>For the 2013 session, Matthew’s favourite was Mahler 9 with Alan Trudel conducting, and he immensely enjoyed the chamber music institute. “I remember playing in brass quintet for two weeks and it was incredible. It is really hard to schedule rehearsals for chamber groups at university, so this was the first time for me, where everyone was on the exact same schedule and we were able to rehearse and get coached every day… the schedule was busy, but manageable. On a normal day, we would have a rehearsal or a coaching from 10-12.30 p.m,, and another from 2-4.30 p.m.… the brass faculty were very generous with their time and were so supportive to all of us.”</p>
<p>in 2015, Canadian National Brass project had an NYO residency, and them performing O Magnum Mysterium was another memorable moment, as well as the overnight train journey from Montreal to Halifax in 2017. However, the best thing for Matthew in 2017 session was re-grounding. “I had a really tough year during the first year of my Master’s degree, and lost a lot of confidence. However, NYO Canada is a really positive environment for making music, something I really appreciate — the 2017 program helped me to have fun playing again.”</p>
<p>And for the 2019 session, Matthew’s request to focus on second trumpet parts was accepted, which gave him a great preparation for his contract with the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra. “For NYO trumpets, you rotate parts so everyone gets a chance to play different roles in the section. However, for 2019, I requested to play mostly 2nd trumpet for the tour, as I was starting a one-year contract with the Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra. It really helped me.” Having several alumni in the CPO, including Alisa Klebanov (2015,2016. Violin), who attended NYO Canada 2015 with Matthew, is another joyful connection at his work.</p>
<p>Carolyn Farnand</p>
<p>“I remember people kept slamming the main door to the residence building and thus ruining every recording — eventually I had a couple of quiet minutes and managed to get a decent take,” Carolyn remembers. However, all those efforts were worth it, as that was the take that allowed Carolyn to experience NYO Canada.</p>
<p>As a shy person, Carolyn appreciated the first two weeks of chamber music institute, as it allowed people to get to know a small group, then to build a larger connection with others once the orchestral training started. Carolyn found NYO Canada’s workshops, especially on hearing loss prevention, injury prevention and studying abroad, quite memorable and practical. “NYO also provides each musician with high-quality earplugs from the Musicians’ Clinic, which I still use to this day.”</p>
<p>The 2016 Portugal tour was a particular highlight for Carolyn, musically and personally. “We got to travel and play in so many gorgeous venues! And my partner is a musician that I met from NYO! In 2016, the orchestra had toured to Portugal and we had access to a high school there to practice in. My partner and I ended up practising at the same time, every day, and thus running into each other continuously.” A few years later, when Carolyn wanted to collaborate with a clarinetist a few years later, she immediately reached out to him. They continue to perform together in various chamber ensembles and orchestral settings.</p>
<p>These personal and professional connections through NYO Canada are very common among alums, so when Carolyn showed up at her first day at the Canadian Opera Company Orchestra Academy she was met with a familiar face — the current tuba faculty, Sasha Johnson (1993,1996 alum), and also when she was greeted by an NYO friend, Richard Zheng (2016, Violin) upon her arrival to Schleswig-Holstein Orchestra. These things continue to make her NYO Canada experience stay alive.</p>
<p>Kira Shiner</p>
<p>After learning the piano for 7 years, Kira chose the oboe in Grade 7 band. “Band was mandatory, and I knew that I did not want to play the flute, because every girl in my class wanted to play it.” When it came to pick instruments, Kira briefly mused on French horn. “I knew that was supposed to be hard,” she remembers. But, she was convinced that the oboe must be interesting. Being the ‘only one’ in a small town was refreshing to Kira. “I was really the only young, serious oboist in town.” With lessons and a youth symphony program, Kira decided to pursue a career in music.</p>
<p>Kira applied to NYO Canada in 2015 as she was graduating from high school. But it was in 2016 that she started to look into it seriously, as she came to Toronto to study with Sarah Jeffrey (1996, 1997, 1998 alum and current faculty). “Sarah encourages her students to attend at least one summer program during the long summer vacation, and she suggested that I apply to NYO Canada and she supported the process, to make sure I went about it the right way.”</p>
<p>Working on excerpts in lessons, making recordings at least a week before the final due date for last feedback from her teacher, and prepping to make a ‘good’ reed, Kira has auditioned five times in total, and she notes that some excerpts were perennial favourites. La Scala di Seta (Rossini) and Le Tombeau de Couperin (Ravel).</p>
<p>Getting a good recording device and finding a good space to record also posed its own challenge. There were plenty of late nights. “My 2017 audition video was taken at 1:15 a.m. It was me and a friend. It was 1 a.m., and he wanted to do one more take. I was exhausted but I thought, why not, I will do one more — that turned out to be the best one, which got me in,” Kira chuckles.</p>
<p>The 2017 tour, Edges of Canada, took Kira to 13 different Canadian cities, with a camera crew in tow the whole time. “I remember being very stressed — I was having a major case of imposter syndrome during my first year at NYO Canada. I had never been in such an intense training situation, so that, plus having to meet all the new people (I am an introvert), was quite overwhelming.” But she found her people, and it truly became a once-in-a-lifetime experience for her.</p>
<p>“The entire tour was a dream come true in lot of ways. It will always be a highlight of my life as it was the first time I got to perform in real concert halls such as Koerner Hall, Maison Symphonique, National Arts Center, etc. Also getting up early with friends to watch the sunrise in the middle of nowhere New Brunswick on the overnight VIA train from Montreal to Halifax… taking the charter plane to get to Whitehourse… and my parents attending our last concert in Vancouver. They were extremely proud and excited for me to attend NYO Canada, and at the performance, they were impressed at the level of playing in the orchestra. It was one of the moments where they fully understood why I was studying music and what I was working towards. Since I was studying in Toronto and they are in Kelowna, they didn’t get to see me perform a lot, so seeing that NYO Canada performance meant a lot to them.”</p>
<p>The best thing about NYO Canada: “It’s just you, the music and the people you are sharing that with,” Kira says. In fact, Kira is happy to send, “A shout out to my now partner, Taran Plamondon — he was a constant supporter during my years in NYO and I’m happy to say he’s now a constant supporter in my life.”(Taran is 2016, 17,18 French Horn alum). Kira’s life has NYO Canada embedded in it deeply, and it’ll always remain special.</p>
<p>Jacob Valcheff</p>
<p>“I first started guitar in the fifth grade, and I wanted to be in a rock band,” says Jacob. But since guitar wasn’t a band instrument, it was suggested that he should try percussion. So during summer after grade 8, Jacob took some drum lessons and started band percussion in 9th grade. First hearing about NYO Canada in grade 11, it took Jacob a bit of time to carve out sufficient time to prepare for the audition. In the fall of 2017, Jacob started to work on his audition repertoire as a second year undergrad at the Faculty of Music, University of Toronto. “The format was video recording, and I started my preparation the day the excerpts came out in October 2017, and finished my recordings four days before the last deadline, which was February 1, 2018.”</p>
<p>On the morning of February 26, 2018, Jacob got a text from a friend who said the results were coming out. “I then went through my morning routine, and as I left for school, I got the email on my phone. I was expecting a rejection — being only a second year music student at the time, I knew the competition was high and I knew that so many strong musicians had auditioned, but I was incredibly surprised when the email opened with ‘congratulations!’. I was ecstatic. I immediately called my family.”</p>
<p>During the chamber music institute of 2018, Jacob and friends studied Steve Reich’s Drumming, and coach Aiyun Huang called in Russell Hartenberger, who taught them by rote. “Russell was a member of the original Steve Reich and musicians ensemble, and they premiered Drumming in 1971, so it was incredible to learn from his expertise.”</p>
<p>The 2018 Migrations Tour brought NYO Canada to European tour stops at Berlin, Kassel and Edinburgh. However, the most memorable moment for Jacob was right at his hometown. “I remember playing Ein Heldenleben in Toronto. Leading up to a huge climactic moment, I looked out into the audience at Koerner Hall. I saw my current percussion teacher, my previous private teacher, and my parents in the audience. I remember thinking of how fortunate I was to be making such incredible music with such incredible people in such a beautiful hall. This really was magical, and I knew then that I wanted to do this for the rest of my life.”</p>
<p>Jacob has been accepted for 2020 session and was really looking forward to it, as he would’ve known a lot of the orchestra, which makes a huge difference for musicians.</p>
<p>“What was beautiful about the 2018 section was that I got to experience the development of these connections with people I did not know, and I got to see these connections grow over the course of the institute. I was really excited to connect and grow even closer to the friends I was going to be with, in 2020. Although I was sad to hear about the cancellation, it definitely needed to happen in the interest of health and wellness. It was a tough decision I am sure, but it was the right one. I look forward to seeing all my friends and colleagues, and making music with them in the 2021 iteration of NYO Canada.”</p>
<p>Lucy Nesbitt</p>
<p>“Studying with Gabe Radford for the first three years of my undergrad meant that, since he was NYO Faculty, he sort of made all of us in the studio work up the list and send a video every year,” says Lucy. Working on the excerpts from the day the reps are announced till the deadline on 01 February — it’s a tough process, balancing everyday life, school work and to prep for a great audition. “… The videos, when you are allowed to call the shots on how many takes you’re allowed to do, it gets very easy to try to do it a million times until it’s perfect — which can be draining,” says Lucy.</p>
<p>As she was waitlisted, Lucy had to be patient. “The news came through the grapevine at first, and so when I finally got the email, it was so exciting — such a relief. I’d auditioned for the past three years and made the waitlist the year before, so it felt like a long time in the works.”</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t so easy. The participants often cite worrying about underperformance and failure, and Lucy ended up breaking down in tears one day. “I was so worried that I couldn’t play well enough to match the section. I remember going to Gabe and asking him. how do I match tone colour? How do I find the intonation of the entire orchestra? How do I watch the concertmaster to stay in time? And he just sort of laughed and said, ‘Just listen and blend.’ It was all just so new and terrifying but I felt myself figuring everything out better and better every day.”</p>
<p>The 2019 Odyssey Tour was definitely the best part for Lucy. “It was the best thing that has happened. The entire Canadian tour was perfect. Every concert was an adventure, and just so alive. These performances were the first time I understood how connected an orchestra can and should be. Every single person there was giving their all, every time, and after the shows we were always all so pumped up, no matter how tired we were. I don’t remember anyone complaining about the schedule once, or really anyone getting to overwhelmed. It was such a fantastic group of people; I can’t even begin to explain.”</p>
<p>The gruelling recording session in Montreal, and performing in Spain, including the final performance at the Alhambra palace, with a birthday stuck between the last three free days before returning to Canada so that Lucy and boyfriend, Ryan Garbett (2014, 2015, 2019 Horn Alum) could explore together, Lucy considers the 2019 session as one of the best things that she’s ever experienced. “Every night, we’d get a standing ovation, the audiences were so good to us. And playing in Alhambra — by this point, I felt that the orchestra was completely unified.”</p>
<p>“NYO Canada helped me to come out of my shell. Music tends to do that to a person, because it pushes you out of your comfort zone every day.”</p>
<p>Ryan Scott – Percussion Faculty</p>
<p>Since 2013, Ryan has been working as percussion faculty for NYO Canada, and he is keenly aware of the possible influence and experience available to young musicians through the program. “The NYO Canada is in many ways the first stepping stone into the professional community outside of a formal education at a university or conservatory. It is an enormously important way for top early-career performers to connect with established professionals and to their emerging colleagues. The relationships developed at the NYOC last for decades and lifetimes,” says Ryan.</p>
<p>During the chamber music institute, Ryan tries to focus the students on how to play with other people. Considering it a learned/learnable skill, the communication through body language, whether within a section, or with a conductor, is essential musicianship. Other topics, including how to practice, and developing general musicianship and etiquette, are also of interest to Ryan, as he also learns constantly from fellow faculty members. “Well, it’s not just how you play and every professional knows that,” says Ryan. “It takes a lot of character, endurance, stamina, discipline, professional courtesy, well-measured humour, warmth, compassion, reliability — you name it. The faculty demonstrates this on a daily basis and expects to see these qualities resonate in the students.”</p>
<p>For Ryan, the most rewarding aspect has been to connect to the next generation of outstanding Canadian percussionists, so with the 2020 cancellation, he is interested in staying connected to the new crop of 2020 percussion players through a new layer, continuing to find a way to stay engaged and teach/learn online. Once the NYO Canada goes online for the summer session, both participants and audiences will have the chance to explore this rather new context.</p>
<p>Ed Tait – Double Bass to Double Bass Faculty</p>
<p>“Without the Canadian National Youth Orchestra I would never have become a bass player,” says Ed Tait. Ed wanted piano lessons at age 4, but it just wasn’t possible for his family, so instead, he sang at the local church choir. At his high school, he finally got his hands on a violin. After a year, Ed was asked to switch instrument by a bass player; he agreed and spent the next four years holding up a double bass. “No lessons… I did not know how to play a C major scale when I left high school,” laughs Ed.</p>
<p>As a teenager, Ed took drum lessons. “I studied privately with a studio drummer for four years, and I was fairly a proficient rock’n’roll Dixieland drummer,” he says. He also prepared for the grade 6 piano certificate to be accepted into the music education program at the Faculty of Music, University of Toronto. Ed was accepted as, “The possibly the worst piano major in the history of the Faculty.” He finally had to choose his major.</p>
<p>“Well, one of my friends told me that I should choose the bass because there were no really good bass players in Toronto, so I would get a lot of jobs,” says Ed. The friend’s uncle was a bass player, and agreed to take Ed as a student the following year. “He also suggested that I carry a Toronto phone book around for a while every day, gripping the binding side with my left hand. I bought a $200 plywood bass and took it with me to my summer job as a drummer in a hotel dance band,” says Ed.</p>
<p>Ed got to serious work in September of his second year in university but realized that his teacher, a dance band bassist who had never played in a symphony, was not able to give Ed the knowledge he wanted. “This is where the NYO Canada comes in,” says Ed.</p>
<p>“All of my university friends were members of the NYO. They were all pushing me get into that orchestra.” For the coming summer, Ed applied to NYO Canada (bass) and Fort Henry Guard Band (drums) and was accepted for both. “How the devil, I cannot imagine. It must have been slim pickings for the audition panel for the last position of their bass section,” chuckles Ed.</p>
<p>The legendary Frederick Zimmerman, Assistant Principal Bass of the New York Philharmonic was the coach that year, and under his patient, methodical and encouraging teaching, Ed kept swimming in the deep water, up to 14 hours a day. “How to hold the bow, how to shape the left hand, fingering patterns that improved intonation…”</p>
<p>This became Ed’s life. “During the school year I worked with my Toronto teacher. I played in a string orchestra and the symphony orchestra at the RCM, and I played in in dance and jazz bands as a drummer. The NYO was where I really did my most important work,” says Ed.</p>
<p>The 1966 NYO Tour included England, Scotland, France and a concert in Berlin, and Ed studied with Robert Rohe, then the principal bass of the New Orleans Philharmonic symphony. Still in his third year of serious bass training, Ed was still hard at work, when an unexpected offer came. “At the end of the session, just before we headed out on that tour, Robert approached our principal bassist, my jazz buddy. He told us that his bass section in New Orleans was perennially short three players,” says Ed.</p>
<p>The two young bassists couldn’t take the offer — they had professional positions already. “He then turned to me and asked if I would be interested. I took a brief moment and I said, ‘Uh well… Yes!’”</p>
<p>In New Orleans, Ed met a section consisting of old pros and young graduates, playing major serious symphonic works, and it was the NYO Canada experience that saved him. “Nearly every major symphonic work that was programmed for the 1966/67 season of the New Orleans Philharmonic Orchestra was something that I had played in the NYO. I was in familiar territory,” he recalls.</p>
<p>Then came the draft notice came, and he had to leave New Orleans. In the summer of 1967, after returning home, Ed joined NYO Canada as student for the last time, and met Tom Monohan, then the new principal bass of the TSO. Ed was chosen to lead the NYO Canada bass section through the Western Canada tour, and after that summer, Ed continued to study alongside his classical bass freelance work, for two years before joining the National Arts Centre Orchestra in 1968. The rest is history. in 1970, he joined the TSO as Tom Monohan’s stand partner for 22 years. “The NYO played a huge part in my success in finding my way into a leading Canadian orchestra. Six years after I got serious about playing the instrument, I had achieved my goal,” says Ed.</p>
<p>Ed served as faculty member from 2004 to 2013, He considers it a great honour, and beautiful bookends for his career. Without NYO Canada, where would Ed be today? For him, that’s unimaginable — he would not change anything in his life, and Ed appreciates NYO Canada’s pivotal role in every step of his journey.</p>
<p>The 2020 Session That Wasn’t</p>
<p>Initially scheduled for five weeks of summer training (starting with a two-week intensive chamber program, NYO Canada Chamberfest, and the three-week Orchestral Institute under the baton of Michael Francis), followed by a three-week Generations Tour with European stops in Germany and Croatia, to celebrate NYOC’s 60th year, the NYOC 2020 session is now cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In lieu of the cancellation, NYOC is working to adapt, including offering the first right of refusal for 2020 members without having to reaudition for the 2021 session. They are also working toward a reduced program for late fall or early winter 2020, as well as building an online program for the summer.</p>
<p>These changes demand quick adaptation from all involved, including various levels of donors and supporters. The organization explained its position in a media release.</p>
<p>“NYO Canada are extraordinarily grateful to our donors for their steadfast support at this time but we are not actively soliciting new donors right now as we recognize that Canada must first attend to those needing emergency support to weather the crisis. What we are doing is supporting our orchestra and audiences as best we can and working to keep the lights on and do the most with what we have.</p>
<p>We have been in touch with all of our existing donors and virtually all recognize how important it is to keep the NYO strong and moving on and to be actively planning for next year and beyond. It is very moving to have such loyalty and support as we make our way through this… Our board and staff continue to give and we are working actively with our government partners to ensure NYO remains healthy and looking ahead. This is our 60th anniversary year and we and our donors share the belief that we need the arts now perhaps more than ever!”</p>
<p>Currently facing the biggest challenge since its inception, there’s no doubt that the NYO Canada will continue to provide the pursuit of excellence for an upcoming generation of Canadian musicians. An orchestra is built beyond itself. the individuals, families and friends, teachers, colleagues and the audiences — the way that the music world weaves its intricate web is complex and whimsical. NYO Canada’s best day is yet to come, and along with patient young musicians, we look forward to witnessing the next stage of its evolution.</p>

<h3 id="sketches-of-spain">&ldquo;Sketches of Spain&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/B881575985Z/1592285030645_GED2PP1IA.1-2.JPG?imwidth=1024" alt="img">
My old guitar was a Sobrinos de Santos Hernandez. Made in Madrid, it had a spruce top and rosewood back and sides. A beautiful instrument, light and sonorous, easy to play.</p>
<p>I loved the Melbourne tram rides we took together to my teacher’s house. As the rain fell outside, I’d listen to the cassettes of Spanish guitar and piano music which my teacher had copied for me from LPs.</p>
<p>Most of all, I enjoyed the music of the 19th century Spanish pianist and composer Isaac Albeniz. He’d written a number of musical portraits of Spain, including Seville and Granada (part of the Suite Espanola), and Cordoba (part of the Cantos de Espana suite). I made up my mind to visit these three cities one day.</p>
<p>And here I am, more than 20 years later, in Spain’s south, in Andalusia. Surprised and captivated by ordinary lives lived amid the monuments to a lost civilisation.</p>
<p>On the train to Cordoba, I watch the olive orchards rush by, occasionally glancing up at the TV. A German adaptation, with Spanish subtitles, of a Famous Five Book. Arriving at Cordoba Station, a taxi takes me to my hotel in the old Jewish quarter, Las Casas de Juderia Cordova. It comprises a series of interconnected homes from the 17th-18th centuries.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of passageways and stairwells with ornamental tiles and a picturesque courtyard which tourists enthusiastically photograph. The room is large, with a high ceiling, polished floorboards, tiled walls and an enormous bed. The window looks out onto the narrow cobblestoned calle.</p>
<p>I go out to visit a small, austere synagogue nearby before having breakfast in the centre of town. Not far from me, a tramp eats a bread roll. His three dogs hungrily watch him, sitting in a row, still as statues. On the other side of the street, in a shop window, is a statue of a lacerated Christ. In another window, lingerie-clad mannequins.</p>

<p>I take a final sip of coffee before heading to the city’s architectural treasures, Alcazar de los Reyes Cristianos and the Mezquita. That night, back in the Jewish quarter, a flamenco performance in a small courtyard. The intensity of the performers’ cante, baile and guitarra lights up the faces of the audience sitting in a semi-circle on wooden chairs.</p>
<p>It’s raining the next morning. My taxi takes me to the station, where I board the train bound for Seville. Olives give way to oranges. Arriving at Seville’s Santa Justa, I see cleaners pushing a trolley festooned with plastic bins and cleaning equipment, like a parody of the Holy Week processions.</p>
<p>My hotel, the Hospes las Casas del Rey de Baeza, is like the one in Cordoba a series of linked houses from a bygone era. I note the rough, roll-up blinds and the woven hemp mats on the stone floors. The room isn’t ready, so I take up the offer of a coffee in the courtyard before setting off through narrow cobbled streets lined by shops, taverns, cafes and restaurants, some selling religious artefacts, the most alarming a bleeding Christ and a weeping Madonna.</p>
<p>Camera Icon Orange trees shade a square in Seville&rsquo;s old town. Credit: Gemma Nisbet / The West Australian</p>
<p>The air is heavy with orange blossom and incense. A one-legged man offers to sell me a postcard. I don’t have any change. Somebody else buys it. I walk along the Guadalquivir River to see the Torro del Oro, a 13th century Moorish tower which is now a maritime museum, then head to Seville’s mighty cathedral — the world’s largest Gothic cathedral and the third largest church in the world — with its famous bell tower La Giralda, formerly a minaret for the 12th century mosque on which the cathedral’s construction was begun in the early 1400s. I have just enough time before dinner to visit Real Alcazar, Seville’s complex of palaces and gardens which began construction under Pedro I in 1364.</p>
<p>After a simple meal in a restaurant near the cathedral, I dive into the crowds filling the streets ahead of the processions which are such an important part of Holy Week in Spain and in Seville in particular.</p>
<p>Above the din a marching band is heard in the distance — a procession is approaching. Suddenly everything is a blur of smells and sounds and colour and movement as the Nazarenos, or brotherhoods, carrying crosses and candles, the marching bands, the altar boys swinging incense burners, the costaleros carrying gold or silver-painted floats, or pasos, bearing effigies of Christ and Mary and other biblical figures forming misterios, or biblical tableaux, descend on us.</p>
<p>Just as suddenly, silence. A paso carrying Death in the form of a brooding skeleton drifts slowly by. Then a small trio of instruments — oboe, clarinet, bassoon — cry mournfully, presaging the flamenco singers’ saetas flung from balconies further on.</p>
<p>As the processions wend their way back to their respective churches and chapels, I return to my hotel, the midnight bells ringing out over the city.</p>
<p>Camera Icon Alhambra, Granada. Credit: Will Yeoman / The West Australian</p>
<p>The next day, on the train, bound for Granada. Hills and valleys filled with olive and orange orchards, sheep and cattle grazing in the fields between. The horizon punctuated by the giant turbines of wind farms. Rustic villages with tiled roofs like corn cobs, church steeples, an abandoned monastery with graffiti-scralled walls. Dilapidated stone cottages now just houses for birds. The depredations of time.</p>
<p>My hotel is near the historic Albaicin district. After unpacking in my room, I catch the bus to Alhambra, which sits high above the city. A light breeze carries the scent of orange blossoms and the music of birds. Fountains, flowers and fortifications form a paradisical bricolage of sweetness and melancholy.</p>
<p>In the gift shop, I buy a copy of Lorca’s poems, before boarding the bus to take me back down into the city. Walking to my hotel, I see a young man with two prosthetic legs asleep in the alcove of a shop. Beside him, his worldly belongings: a walking stick, a bag of nuts, a paper coffee cup holding a few coins.

<h3 id="la-universities-housing-2000-students-on-campus-who-cant-go-home">&ldquo;La. universities housing 2,000 students on campus who can&rsquo;t go home&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.houmatoday.com/Global/images/head/nameplate/houmatoday_logo.png" alt="img">
Twelve thousand boxes were shipped to Tulane University in mid-March.</p>
<p>One thousand seven hundred fifty students filled the boxes with their belongings and shipped the contents of their dorm rooms and apartments into a storage facility in New Orleans.</p>
<p>Tulane covered the first two months of storage, and each student spent up to $300 to keep their belongings stored for the entire summer, while they returned home to take classes online and wait out the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>One month passed. Two months. Enter three.</p>
<p>An empty campus on St. Charles Avenue?</p>
<p>Not quite.</p>
<p>Tulane never fully closed during the pandemic and about 250 students continued to live in campus housing through the end of the spring semester, May 2.</p>
<p>Since then, more students returned home, and university officials say they consolidated the 50 to 60 students left living on campus into Wall and Warren Residence Halls.</p>
<p>There those students remain.</p>
<p>And they&rsquo;re not alone.</p>
<p>School officials say there are 1,825 students still living on campus in Louisiana&rsquo;s largest universities and colleges. Populations range from as many as 310 students at Louisiana Tech to as few as the four students living at Northwestern State. Some institutions, like Southern University&rsquo;s Baton Rouge campus and Loyola University in New Orleans, have none at all.</p>
<p>These students are out-of-staters who hail from hotspot regions, officials say. They are the children and grandchildren of immunocompromised relatives. They are international students who are either locked in the U.S. or locked out of their home countries due to the spread of COVID-19. They are escapees from domestic violence, familial drug use, household hostility due to their sexual orientation.</p>
<p>For the foreseeable future, these students are the wards of residential life officials who are rewriting rulebooks to make sure the stranded have a safe place to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes people have nowhere else to go,&rdquo; said Catherine David, LSU Residential Life&rsquo;s associate director of communications and development.</p>
<p>Gabriela Gomez, 27, plays the flute. She&rsquo;s a doctoral student in the LSU School of Music, an international student from the Dominican Republic. The Caribbean island has over 13,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and over 400 deaths, enough to earn a &ldquo;Level 4&rdquo; rating from the U.S. Embassy as a place where citizens should &ldquo;avoid all international travel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I considered going back home,&rdquo; Gomez said. &ldquo;But my country&rsquo;s borders are still closed. It&rsquo;s been nice to be able to stay here until we figure something out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gomez scratched out Backup Plan A: living with family in New York, the state with the highest number of coronavirus deaths and cases per capita in the country.</p>
<p>She scratched out Backup Plan B, too: staying with friends in Texas, a state that enforced Louisiana travelers into 14-day quarantine from March 29 until May 1.</p>
<p>Luckily, Gomez said, LSU extended its May 9 move-out date through May 31 at no cost. She and her roommate, Jana Zilova, have both decided to sign leases that will keep them on campus through the summer.</p>
<p>The move-out deadline at the University of New Orleans, May 17, has already passed. Of the 117 students left living on campus, a school housing official said, 39 students are staying in interim housing.</p>
<p>Interim students have until the start of UNO&rsquo;s summer semester, June 9, to decide whether they will sign summer leases. In the meantime, they can either pay $250 to stay for the entire interim period or a prorated amount based on room type, ranging from $40 to $60 a day.</p>
<p>Carolyn Golz, UNO&rsquo;s Dean of Students, said the university didn&rsquo;t at first know where exactly stranded students would be able to stay on campus.</p>
<p>In late March, Gov. John Bel Edwards and his administration explored using college dorms to house &ldquo;step-down&rdquo; patients — people who are COVID-19 positive but aren&rsquo;t in critical condition — if the state&rsquo;s hospital capacity reached a critical level.</p>
<p>Golz said at that point UNO began to strongly encourage students to leave, reimbursing students 25% on their housing and meal plans if they moved out by March 27.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s when we realized the extent of the number of students who still needed to stay,&rdquo; Golz said. &ldquo;That even though we were offering them refunds to go, we were encouraging them to go, they continued to say, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t have anywhere to go.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Governor&rsquo;s Office eventually moved away from dorms and selected the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center to house potential overflow patients. School officials said the state decided dorm rooms weren&rsquo;t effective healthcare units because they lacked proper beds, trained staffing and medical equipment, among other shortcomings.</p>
<p>These were the same conditions in which the remaining students lived, and, although college students weren&rsquo;t step-down patients, housing officials across the state made adjustments to boost safety on campus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had to keep safety first and foremost,&rdquo; LSU&rsquo;s David said. &ldquo;So all our decisions and conversations with students were based on what do students need? And how can we deliver those services in the most efficient way and the safest way possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>LSU consolidated the students still living in residence halls into the East and West Campus apartments, where David said each student had their own bedroom and bathroom.</p>
<p>Three student managers still oversee each property and stay in touch with residents. The same custodial staffs clean the same rooms every time, and students can opt out from having their rooms cleaned if they&rsquo;d prefer no one else entering their rooms.</p>
<p>There are new rules, too: no guests, no gatherings, 24-hour quiet hours.</p>
<p>Similar setups and rules are spread across Louisiana&rsquo;s institutions, but they can&rsquo;t guarantee safety.</p>
<p>At Tulane, a housing official said, there were two suspected coronavirus cases that came back negative in March. The students were quarantined separately — one in a residence hall, another in an apartment — until their results came back. Nurses checked in and school employees dropped off meals while they waited.</p>
<p>The Louisiana Department of Health does not track COVID-19 cases by college affiliation, a spokesperson said, although, as of Friday, there are 5,015 confirmed cases and nine deaths with Louisianans aged 18-29.</p>
<p>Institutions may not be aware of student cases unless the students report their sickness directly to the school.</p>
<p>UNO&rsquo;s Golz said a student attending another university in New Orleans, who lived at a third-party apartment on campus, was transported to the hospital by ambulance in early April. The school and the apartment still do not know whether the event was coronavirus related. The student has not returned, Golz said, and attempts to track down answers have been fruitless.</p>
<p>UNO has sent students multiple emails asking them to let staffers know if they get sick, Golz said, and the school has made a thermometer available for students at the Pontchartrain Halls.</p>
<p>Tulane set up an online reporting database specifically for COVID-19. Erica Woodley, Tulane&rsquo;s Dean of Students, said a student communicated with school staffers from Panama while getting tested for coronavirus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being able to have something they could do, report it, was important for them (in) feeling that we were aware of what was happening,&rdquo; Woodley said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the remaining on-campus students across Louisiana still had to complete their spring classes online and many will take summer coursework.</p>
<p>Southern University System President-Chancellor Ray Belton told the House Appropriations Committee in early May that &ldquo;about 20%&rdquo; of the system&rsquo;s students did not own or could not access the technology to engage in online coursework.</p>
<p>“In some cases,&rdquo; Belton said, &ldquo;it imposed them to stay on campus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The CARES Act, which sent almost $80 million in government aid to Louisiana students, was intended to relieve students of costs incurred in the coronavirus transition. But the payments, which ranged from $150 to $3,000 per student, were off-limits to international students, which make up a substantial portion of the students remaining on Louisiana campuses.</p>
<p>Southern&rsquo;s Shreveport campus is housing 30 students, and, of the 53 students living on the New Orleans campus, 18 are international students. The four students remaining at Northwestern State are all international students, and three are in housing for a few more weeks while they await flights home.</p>
<p>Zilova, Gomez&rsquo;s roommate at LSU, had to replace her computer when it crashed right before the school transitioned online. She could not return to her home in the Czech Republic, another &ldquo;Level 4&rdquo; country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was like, I&rsquo;m in this mess right now,&rdquo; Zilova, 29, said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go home. I have to sort this out before I can leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zilova, also a doctoral student in music, plays the oboe. She and Gomez practice on their own, waiting for normalcy to return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I miss playing with other people,&rdquo; Zilova said. &ldquo;The semester, it was OK being online. It&rsquo;s just I would not want to go through that in the fall again.&rdquo;

<h3 id="let-the-sunshine-in-a-virtual-solstice-celebration--musical-evening-at-graycliff">&ldquo;Let the Sunshine In! A Virtual Solstice Celebration &amp; Musical Evening at Graycliff&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.buffalorising.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Chris-Kalisiak-Sunset-at-Graycliff-2019.jpg" alt="img">
Graycliff’s “Virtual Fundraising Initiative” is now underway. A unique aspect of this particular fundraiser is that silent auction bidders will be automatically designated as “ticket holders” for a special viewing of “Let the Sunshine In! A Virtual Solstice Celebration &amp; Musical Evening at Graycliff” performed by a quartet of Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra (BPO) musicians.

<p>“While it was our plan to host a solstice celebration at Graycliff to share in person this very special moment that only comes around once a year, we are excited about the new virtual direction of the event,” explains Graycliff’s Executive Director, Anna Kaplan. “I’m thrilled to be able to share this incredibly inspiring experience with a much broader audience. After seeing the sun set through the view room, further animated by the talented musicians from the BPO, my hope is that viewers will have a fuller understanding of the architecture and energy of Graycliff and consider visiting us at some point in the future.”</p>
<p>Tickets start at $25. A link to the virtual concert will be sent to ticket holders at 7:30pm on June 20th, just before the concert begins. Bidding is now officially open (see here). Tickets include a door prize drawing featuring items from Graycliff’s Pavilion Shop.

<p><img src="https://bestgamingpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5-cool-Telegram-gestures-and-shortcuts-you-should-be-using-1000x600.png" alt="img">
Lately gestures have change into basic to the best way we work together with our units, prompting not solely Android itself but additionally the apps that decision it dwelling to implement them. A major instance of that is Telegram, top-of-the-line messaging apps on the market. With such a wealthy tapestry of options included in Telegram, it is easy to overlook a few of them or overlook that they exist. So, let’s check out a number of the most helpful gestures and shortcuts which can be hidden away in Telegram, and why try to be utilizing them.</p>
<p>Dialog peeking</p>
<p>Generally I wish to learn a message, however I haven’t got time to answer to it there after which. The issue is, the sender can see once you’ve learn the message they despatched, which may be particularly problematic if in case you have a psycho accomplice, or an annoying pal or member of the family. Telegram has an answer, nonetheless, within the type of peeking. For those who long-press on the picture subsequent to the dialog title, a preview will pop up, permitting you to learn the previous few messages in its entirety with out marking it as learn. For those who do wish to reply then and there, merely swipe as much as open the complete dialog.</p>
<p>Swipe to exit</p>
<p>In finding this feature for the primary time, our benevolent chief, Artem, commissioned this very article. It is extremely easy: Swiping from left to proper anyplace on the display in an open dialog will slide it away, and take you again to the chat checklist. Easy, however sensible and helpful nonetheless.</p>
<p>Swipe to answer</p>
<p>That is my most-used gesture by far, and it is particularly useful in group chats with dozens of customers. We’re all conversant in the headache that’s group chats the place there are 100 completely different conversations all happening without delay. In Telegram, you may swipe from the precise on any message to answer to it. Your reply, when despatched, will present a preview of the unique message that, when pressed, will robotically scroll as much as that message. You possibly can even reply to your messages, ensuring that ideas may be learn coherently later. So, if you happen to’ve been going to all the trouble of long-pressing messages to make use of the reply button all this time, do your self a favor and swipe as an alternative.</p>
<p>Sticker previews</p>
<p>Telegram has extra stickers than you may shake a stick at, with customers with the ability to create and share their very own, in addition to those included by the developer. The issue is, these stickers are extremely small when seen within the keyboard, making it unattainable to learn the textual content in a sticker or see the finer element. The answer to it is a easy long-press. Doing so will present you a bigger preview, permitting you to test that it is the one you need. Animated stickers will play on this preview, too, so actually, there isn’t any excuse for sending the unsuitable one.</p>
<p>Audio/video lock</p>
<p>Urgent and holding on the microphone button lets you ship quick voice memos to whoever you are speaking to. Nicely, if in case you have lots to say, swiping up towards the padlock will, because the title suggests, lock the microphone on and permit you to let go. While you’re achieved, press the cease button and ship it. Tapping the mic will swap to video memos, the place you may report and submit quick movies, and swiping as much as lock the digital camera on works right here too if you happen to’re planning a protracted speech.</p>
<p>Batch choose messages (Telegram X)</p>
<p>This one is an honorable point out, because it’s presently solely out there in Telegram X, an experimental app the place the Telegram devs check new options. Now, when deciding on messages to ahead to another person, or to avoid wasting, it’s a must to select each individually. In Telegram X, you may merely choose two messages, one on the high of your choice and one on the backside, after which press the three strains within the motion bar. Each message between the 2 chosen ones will then be highlighted, saving you loads of faucets within the course of.</p>
<p>To most of us, these options appear apparent. For those who’ve been utilizing Telegram for a very long time, that is yesterday’s information and one thing you employ daily. Nonetheless, if you happen to’ve solely simply joined Telegram and have but to know the entire intricacies, I hope this little information will provide help to in your means.

<p>A soldier killed in action 75 years ago will be the focus of the first Last Post Ceremony to be held since the coronavirus forced the Australian War Memorial to shut its doors in March. The daily live format of the Last Post Ceremony will restart on July 1, the day the memorial reopens to visitors. The ceremony will commemorate the 75th anniversary of the amphibious landings of the Australian 7th Division at Balikpapan in New Guinea during the Second World War. It will honour Private Leslie James Hanlon of the 2/27th Australian Infantry Battalion who was killed during Operation Oboe Two. Australian War Memorial director Matt Anderson urged people to book a free ticket online if they wished to attend. &ldquo;The Last Post Ceremony is an important part of the memorial visitor experience and a powerful and memorable way to conclude a visit,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It draws us closer to the lives and the loss of but one of the 102,800 names recorded on the Roll of Honour. It is a chance to take stock in our busy lives, and to wrap ourselves in a unifying cloak of remembrance.&rdquo; Pre-recorded Last Post Ceremonies have been posted online during the shutdown and will continue until the reopening.
