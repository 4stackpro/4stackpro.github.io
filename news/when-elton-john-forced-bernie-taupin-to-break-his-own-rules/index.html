The successful partnership between Elton John and Bernie Taupin always worked on the same principles – until the day when the performer forced his co-writer to break the rules that made them both famous.</p>
<p>For one, they never wrote songs with the intention of creating hits; they had stories to tell, even if the reserved, introspective Taupin presented himself very differently from the outlandish party animal John. For another, whether it was Taupin pursuing a lyric idea or John chasing a melody, they would abandon any concept that didn’t start working for them in a matter of minutes. For another, with the exception of suggesting a title from time to time, John didn’t tell Taupin what to do.</p>
<p>All three of those hard-and-fast rules went sideways after John decided he wanted to write a song for his friend, tennis champion Billie Jean King. “In the summer of 1974, we were driving to one of his concerts and he looked over at me in the back of the car (I can remember, he was on my right) and he said, ‘I want to write a song for you,'” she recalled in an interview on John’s website. “I turned scarlet red, I’m sure, and went, ‘Oh, please. What?’ And he goes, ‘No, I want to write a song. What are we gonna call it?’ And I said, ‘I don’t know!’ Then he went, ‘How about “Philadelphia Freedom”?’ Because I played for the Philadelphia Freedoms [tennis team], and he used to come to watch our matches.”</p>
<p>John decided early on that he was aiming to write a hit, in contravention of the writing team’s standard procedure. “At the time, we were making so many albums, but we liked to make separate singles too,&rdquo; he explained in 1990. &ldquo;I said to Bernie, ‘Will you write a song called &ldquo;Philadelphia Freedom&rdquo; for me? Thank you, Elton.’”</p>
<p>“Not exactly the easiest title to deal with, I might add,&rdquo; Taupin noted.</p>
<p>Listen to Elton John&rsquo;s ‘Philadelphia Freedom’</p>
<p>It was a steep challenge for other reasons too. &ldquo;I have to be very conscious of the words I put in his mouth,” Taupin told The Telegraph in 2002. “I still write what I feel, but when I&rsquo;ve finished a song, I have to see if it&rsquo;s something I want to present to him or if it&rsquo;s more suited for use elsewhere.” In the end, deciding that he couldn’t write lyrics about tennis, Taupin gathered some feel-good lines and sent them to his longtime co-writer, who indulged his passion for Philly soul to complete a song that hit No.1 in April 1975.</p>
<p>A few months later, the notoriously moody John, at least temporarily, regretted the exercise, telling a paper, “In America I’ve got ‘Philadelphia Freedom’ going up the charts again. I wish the bloody thing would piss off. I can see why people get sick and tired of me. In America I get sick and tired of hearing myself on AM radio. It’s embarrassing.”</p>
<p>What was done was done – and in any case, King was delighted with the song, which went on to become an unofficial anthem for a wide range of sporting endeavors. “It’s a feeling,” she said in 2017. “It’s a great song for a team. It’s a great song if you’re not a team. The people in Philadelphia go, ‘That’s our anthem.’ And half the time they don’t know the backstory.”</p>
<p>As the years rolled by, John and Taupin have come to spend less and less time together, though their partnership has weathered worse storms than the one over “Philadelphia Freedom.”</p>
<p>Speaking in 2002, Taupin noted, “The only thing we really have in common is the music and talking about it. When we talk on the phone, he goes, ‘Hello, what&rsquo;s going on,&rsquo; and I tell him about my latest horse. … I can feel his eyes glazing over at the other end. He will tell me about his parties and so on, and I am not really interested either. And then we talk about the new so-and-so record we are listening to, and we’re back where we were in 1968. The music has been the catalyst for everything we&rsquo;ve ever done.”

<h3 id="freddie-mercury-and-elton-johns-beautiful-friendship-from-drag-alter-egos-to-aids-heartbreak">Freddie Mercury and Elton John&rsquo;s beautiful friendship from drag alter egos to Aids heartbreak</h3>
<p><img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article9309828.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_John-Peter-Freddie.jpg" alt="img">
Freddie Mercury and Elton John are true icons, stamping their mark on music and the world with remarkable careers.</p>
<p>Both hitmakers of the 1970s and beyond, it seemed natural that the two meet on more than one occasion.</p>
<p>That they became such close pals was a match made in showbiz heaven - two larger than life characters, beloved by millions, came together in a friendship that lasted across decades.</p>
<p>Freddie tragically died in 1991, after a secret battle with Aids, only telling the world of his medical status hours before his final breath.</p>
<p>Recent revelations by Elton, now 73, have given fans a glimpse into the relationship that became so strong that he was one of the few people Freddie allowed to see him as he lay dying.</p>
<p>(Image: Hulton Archive/Getty Images)</p>
<p>Elton describes Freddie&rsquo;s final days in his memoirs - during which the Queen frontman never lost his sense of humour or kindness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was too frail to get out of bed,&rdquo; the Rocketman singer recalled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was losing his sight, his body was covered in Kaposi&rsquo;s sarcoma lesions, and he was still definitely Freddie, gossiping away, completely outrageous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was Freddie down to a tee, says Elton, and he&rsquo;d been the same since they first met back in the &rsquo;70s.</p>
<p>Since their first meeting, they&rsquo;d been through a lot together - Elton experiencing addiction issues in &rsquo;80s.</p>
<p>It was Freddie, in fact, who led the charge among Elton&rsquo;s celeb pals to get him to kick his cocaine habit, and encouraged him into rehab.</p>
<p>Elton told that his addiction issues had stemmed from a struggle with fame and an emotionally tough childhood - but Freddie was there to point him in the right direction.</p>

<p>And Elton was just as committed to Freddie, starstruck by his iconic onstage performances.</p>
<p>He told The Guardian of Queen&rsquo;s Live Aid performance in 1985, often considered the greatest live gig of all time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a huge area that I kind of decorated. I made sure there were seats for everyone, so that people who were playing could sit down and have a natter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Freddie came over after Queen had stolen the show.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Freddie, nobody should go on after you, you were magnificent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a cheeky smile, Freddie came back: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re absolutely right, darling, we were. We killed them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elton also recalled that Freddie never failed to be exceedingly generous, even on his deathbed.</p>
<p>(Image: Getty)</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Christmas morning,&rdquo; he remembered, &ldquo;[Musician] Tony King came round and gave me this pillow case&hellip;.my drag name is Sharon and Freddie was Melina.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the beautiful pillowcase was a watercolour painting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the note that went with it, it said, &lsquo;Dear Sharon, I saw this at auction and thought you would love it. I love you, Melina.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elton still has the painting, and the pillowcase.

DJM Records/UNI/UMEToday marks the 50th anniversary of the release of the album that made Elton John a star: His 1970 self-titled collection.</p>
<p>Released on April 10, 1970, Elton John was Elton&rsquo;s second album, though many U.S. fans assumed it was his first. That&rsquo;s because his actual first album, Empty Sky, wasn&rsquo;t officially released in America until 1975.</p>
<p>The first of many Elton albums to be produced by Gus Dudgeon, the release included pop-rock legend&rsquo;s Elton&rsquo;s breakthrough hit, &ldquo;Your Song,&rdquo; as well as now-classic tunes like &ldquo;Take Me to the Pilot,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sixty Years On&rdquo; and the gospel-influenced &ldquo;Border Song,&rdquo; which was technically Elton&rsquo;s first track to chart in the U.S., reaching #92. Aretha Franklin later covered it, and made it a top 40 hit.</p>
<p>As for &ldquo;Your Song,&rdquo; it was originally released as the B-side of &ldquo;Take Me to the Pilot,&rdquo; but disc jockeys preferred it, so &ldquo;Your Song&rdquo; became the A-side. It eventually reached number eight on the Billboard chart &ndash; the first of nearly 30 top 10s that would follow for Elton.</p>
<p>The album itself &ndash; recorded in just four days &ndash; peaked at number four on the Billboard 200, went gold, and was nominated for a Grammy for Album of the Year. In 2012, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for its &ldquo;qualitative or historical significance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his autobiography, Me, Elton describes the sessions for Elton John as &ldquo;weirdly magical,&rdquo; noting, &ldquo;We knew we&rsquo;d made something good, something that would push us on to the next level. We were right.&rdquo;</p>
