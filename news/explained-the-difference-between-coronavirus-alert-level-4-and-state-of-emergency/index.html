When news broke on Tuesday that New Zealand&rsquo;s state of national emergency would be extended by a week, many Kiwis assumed that meant our coronavirus lockdown period would now be five weeks long.</p>
<p>But the lockdown, a measure imposed by the Government under the fourth tier of its new alert level system, has a completely different function to Civil Defence&rsquo;s state of emergency.</p>
<p>States of emergency have been declared dozens of times since the legislation was enshrined in the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002 - most notably in response to extreme weather events and the Kaikoura earthquake.</p>
<p>In contrast, New Zealand&rsquo;s alert level system was only conceived last month, in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

<h3 id="government-extends-state-of-national-emergency-to-help-stop-the-spread-of-covid-19">Government extends state of national emergency to &lsquo;help stop the spread of COVID-19&rsquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/03/government-extends-state-of-national-emergency-to-help-stop-the-spread-of-covid-19/_jcr_content/par/brightcovevideo/image.dynimg.1280.q75.jpg/v1585614338037/peeni-henare-CREDIT-NEWSHUB-081219-1120.jpg" alt="img">
The Government declared a state of national emergency last week, lasting seven days, and it can be extended as many times as the Government deems necessary.</p>
<p>It was declared by Henare and the Director of Civil Defence Emergency Management Sarah Stuart Black under the Civil Defence Emergency Act 2002.</p>
<p>Stuart-Black said at the time the declaration would allow her to direct and coordinate personnel, material and other resources, to ensure they can be made available during the crisis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It also provides access to powers that would not normally be available, but would be needed to support the delivery and timely response to COVID-19.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern issued an epidemic notice last week week and it will remain for three months with ongoing review, enabling the use of a number of &lsquo;special powers&rsquo; in legislation, to help tackle the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The powers under New Zealand&rsquo;s emergency legislation did not require new Bills to be passed. The existence of several statutes that make up the country&rsquo;s legislative framework were already in place, and were simply enacted.</p>
<p>The Health Act 1965, for example, allows the Government to require people to be isolated, quarantined or disinfected, force people to remain where they are, and requisition equipment, vehicles and buildings.</p>
<p>Each week, Stuart-Black will provide Henare with advice on whether the state of national emergency should be extended again.</p>
<p>This will include consideration of the current COVID-19 alert level, as alert level decisions and state of emergency decisions are complementary to each other, but one does not dictate the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This global pandemic has called on every New Zealander to make sacrifices in their daily lives and we thank them for that,&rdquo; Henare said.</p>
<p>The extended state of national emergency comes as more than 500 people have contracted the virus in New Zealand, with one woman in her 70s confimed as the country&rsquo;s first COVID-19-related death.</p>
<p>The virus has so far infected more than 700,000 people around the world and killed more than 37,000, while more than 165,000 have recovered from it.

<h3 id="government-officials-declare-state-of-national-emergency-in-new-zealand-amid-covid-19-pandemic">Government officials declare state of national emergency in New Zealand amid COVID-19 pandemic</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2020/03/government-officials-declare-state-of-national-emergency-in-new-zealand-amid-covid-19-pandemic/_jcr_content/par/brightcovevideo/image.dynimg.1280.q75.jpg/v1585100029805/getty-new-zealand-coronavirus-1120.jpg" alt="img">
Stuart Black said the declaration will allow her to direct and coordinate personnel, material and other resources, to ensure they can be made available during the crisis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It also provides access to powers to would not normally be available, but would be needed to support the delivery and timely response to COVID-19,&rdquo; she told reporters at the Beehive in Wellington, alongside Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We expect the Civil Defence Emergency Management powers to be used when necessary and to slow the spread of COVID-19, reduce its impact, and manage the consequences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Government will have the powers of requisition, and Stuart Black said an example of this would be the conservation and supply of fuel and other essential supplies.</p>
<p>The Government will also be able to close roads, prohibit and regulate traffic, stop activities that might contribute to the emergency, and exclude people from certain places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This declaration of a state of national emergency ensures that we have all of the legislative means possible, all of the enforcement powers, all of the tools that we need at our disposal to combat the spread of COVID-19,&rdquo; Stuart Black said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These powers work as a complementary component to the powers that the Director-General of Health has&hellip; This is an enhancement of the current COVID-19 response arrangements and this is just one part of that response.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The state of national emergency applies to all of New Zealand, including the Chatham Islands, Stewart Island, and other offshore islands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to reinforce the critical importance of everyone doing their part to make sure that we can save lives and beat COVID-19&hellip; each of you has a role in helping to save a life,&rdquo; Stuart Black added.</p>
<p>She said between 6-7pm on Wednesday night a national emergency mobile alert will be sent to all New Zealanders as a reminder of the country going into lockdown at midnight.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said we need &ldquo;all the tools at our disposal&rdquo; to ensure everyone reduces contact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Failure of anyone to play their part in coming days will put the lives of others at risk, and there will be no tolerance for that,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not expect to use the full extent of these measures but, as with everything we have done in response to COVID-19, we plan, we prepare, we have in place everything we need to get through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For now, I ask that New Zealanders do their part. Stay home, break the chain, save lives.&rdquo;
