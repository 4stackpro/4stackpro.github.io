<h3 id="imf-make-covid-19-funds-transparent-accountable">IMF: Make COVID-19 funds transparent, accountable</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.transparency.org/images/uploads/icons-logos/facebook_pressrelease.jpg" alt="img">
IMF: Make COVID-19 funds transparent, accountable</p>
<p>Preventing corruption key to helping hardest hit</p>
<p>Issued by Transparency International Secretariat</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund should include transparency and anti-corruption measures in coronavirus-related emergency relief programs to ensure that the billions of dollars it is disbursing to dozens of countries help the most vulnerable, Transparency International, Human Rights Watch and Global Witness said today in a letter to the IMF Executive Board.</p>
<p>“The urgent need to support countries in their efforts during the pandemic makes transparency and accountability in government spending critically important,” said Delia Ferreira Rubio, Chair, Transparency International. “The crisis requires the IMF to make funds available as quickly as possible, but it shouldn’t abandon its commitment to fighting corruption. The scale of the crisis raises the risks and dangers of the theft of public money that should be used to save lives and rebuild livelihoods.”</p>
<p>Over 90 countries have already requested emergency assistance, the highest number in the IMF’s 75-year history. Unlike with the fund’s standard programs, emergency funds are generally disbursed in lump sums, with limited, if any, transparency, conditions, or reviews.</p>
<p>In recent years, the IMF has put a renewed emphasis on combatting corruption as part of a broader recognition that resilient economies require good governance, inclusive growth, and strong social protections. In April 2018, it adopted a new framework that committed the fund to systematically address corruption risks in its surveillance and lending.</p>
<p>“The IMF’s pledge to unleash up to $1 trillion to help governments in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic holds extraordinary potential to save lives and protect the people hardest hit,” said Sarah Saadoun, Business and Human Rights Researcher, Human Rights Watch. “With lives on the line, it is critical for the IMF to maintain its commitment to stem corruption so that people can hold their governments accountable for where the money goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dramatic increases in the amounts and speed of spending, as well as distractions or breakdowns that interfere with oversight mechanisms, can allow powerful actors to take advantage of the crisis for their own benefit. Even at this early stage of the pandemic, there are dozens of media reports of corruption and other criminal activities related to COVID-19 spending.</p>
<p>Simon Taylor, Founder at Global Witness, said: “Recent years have seen the IMF creatively use its leverage to help drive anti-corruption reforms. The pandemic is wreaking havoc with public health and the economies of nations, so it is right for the IMF to step in to help - but we call for the Fund’s leadership to make sure that rapid disbursements do not come at the expense of basic transparency and sensible anti-corruption measures, that should be required of recipient countries.”</p>
<p>Corruption’s drain on public resources always harms governments’ ability to provide adequate health care, education, and other rights, the groups said. During this crisis, it can mean the difference between life and death; adequate food or hunger; a house or homelessness. Moreover, the IMF can systematically include basic measures to reduce the risks of mismanagement and corruption without compromising the speed and flexibility the crisis demands. The organizations proposed four such measures:</p>
<p>IMF transparency . The fund should publish all information related to programs on its website as soon as possible and signal its continued commitment to good governance in high-level public statements and private meetings with governments.</p>

The fund should publish all information related to programs on its website as soon as possible and signal its continued commitment to good governance in high-level public statements and private meetings with governments. Transparency and Accountability in Public Procurement . To mitigate risks such as hidden contracts, overpricing, and collusion, governments should be provided with support and commit, at a minimum, to: (1) publish all public contracts; (2) use open and competitive bidding, and strictly limit the use of emergency non-competitive processes; (3) publish the names and beneficial ownership information of companies awarded contracts; and (4) empower anti-monopoly agencies, where they exist, to monitor market conditions in critical sectors to avoid collusion or overpricing.</p>

Auditing by government and independent monitors. Governments should commit to make all information on how emergency relief funds are spent available to internal auditors and, as soon as practicable, to independent auditors. Priority should be given to critical areas such as health, public procurement, infrastructure and social security expenditures.</p>

Priority should be given to critical areas such as health, public procurement, infrastructure and social security expenditures. Implementing and strengthening existing anti-corruption and anti-money laundering frameworks. The Fund should identify and seek to strengthen gaps in such frameworks, including encouraging G20 states and major financial centers to tackle these shortcomings.</p>

<h3 id="indonesia-anti-graft-activists-urge-transparency-over-rm106bil-stimulus">Indonesia: Anti-graft activists urge transparency over RM106bil stimulus</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.thestar.com.my/Themes/img/newTsol_logo_socmedia.png" alt="img">
ANTI-GRAFT activists have called on the government to be transparent in the disbursement of the recently unveiled 405.1 trillion rupiah (RM106bil) Covid-19 economic stimulus in order to avoid the pitfalls of past corruption cases in 2008 and 1998.</p>
<p>The government issued a regulation in lieu of law (Perppu) on March 31, allowing policymakers to take “extraordinary measures” to cushion the economy from the negative impacts of the outbreak.</p>
<p>The regulation gives Financial System Stability Committee (KSSK) members legal protection to carry out their respective duties as long as those are done “in good faith” and with respect to existing law.</p>
<p>The KSSK is a forum chaired by the Finance Minister, with members including the Bank Indonesia governor and the heads of the Financial Services Authority (OJK) and the Deposit Insurance Corporation (LPS).</p>
<p>Article 27 of the Perppu stipulates that funds spent by the government in carrying out such policies are part of the economic costs to save the country from economic crisis and will not be counted as state losses.Indonesia Corruption Watch activist Kurnia Ramadhana called on the government to exercise prudence in making any future decisions under the Perppu mechanism, given the impunity provision.</p>
<p>“If there is potential for corruption, don’t allow the economic stimulus to be a pretext for such offences,” Kurnia said.</p>
<p>“Don’t be hasty in making decisions that might potentially become corruption offences.”</p>
<p>He said that past corruption cases relating to government interventions to save the economy should be taken as a lesson by President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo’s administration.</p>
<p>During the 1998 financial crisis, BI provided liquidity support to commercial banks to restore public faith in banks as they suffered massive runs, but most of the money was later found to have been embezzled. — The Jakarta Post/ANN</p>
