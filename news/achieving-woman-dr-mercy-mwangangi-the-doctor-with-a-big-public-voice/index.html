We know her as the soft-spoken yet firm young doctor who steps in the absence of Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe (Photo: Standard/Elvis Ogina)</p>
<p>Dr Mercy Mwangangi is easily the most visible face in coronavirus briefings held outside Afya House.</p>
<p>The night before Mercy Mukui Mwangangi was appointed chief administrative secretary in the Health ministry, she was weighing her options on three lucrative health economist job offers.</p>
<p>The following morning, as she was rushing to attend a meeting, Dr Mwangangi, ran the three offers over in her mind.</p>
<p>Which one would she pick?</p>
<p>But then minutes later, her world changed after President Uhuru Kenyatta named the chief administrative secretary for health.</p>
<p>“It was surreal. At some point I thought it was a prank,” she says of the announcement.</p>
<p>It caught her by surprise, as it did everyone else who wondered, who is Mercy Mwangangi?</p>
<p>Press briefings</p>
<p>Today, everyone who watches daily press briefings on the Covid-19 pandemic in Kenya knows Mwangangi as the soft-spoken yet firm young doctor who, in the absence of Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe, steps in to give Kenyans, and the world, updates on the virus’ spread.</p>
<p>She is the CS’ right hand woman - the two work side by side.</p>
<p>Born in Machakos in 1986, Mwangangi went to Pangani Girls, Nairobi, for her high school education, and then went on to graduate from the University of Nairobi in 2009 with a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery.</p>
<p>She joined the Machakos Level 5 Hospital for a one-year internship. There were five intern doctors at the hospital, and Mwangangi spent her time there by patients&rsquo; bedsides or in the theatre, only dashing to intern quarters to catch a breath and change before doing everything all over again. Before she was appointed chief administrative secretary in the Health ministry, she had three job offers (Photo: Standard/Elvis Ogina)</p>
<p>Her first posting was in Meru South, and it was not exactly what she had expected. Mwangangi had expected to continue working with patients. Instead, she found herself in the public health department.</p>
<p>Her father, who she describes as her greatest cheerleader, encouraged her to take up the posting.</p>
<p>It was at Meru South - currently Tharaka-Nithi County - where the young doctor began her career in the public health sector. Her first order of business was a meeting with the District Health Management Team (DHMT).</p>
<p>Not easily intimidated</p>
<p>Then in her 20s, no one in the meeting was as young.</p>

<p>Still, nothing intimidates Mwangangi, who says she thrives in situations where somebody is needed to step up, organise and get things going with a certain goal in mind.</p>
<p>“I learnt to take my seat at the table and make my voice heard, because for your voice to be heard you have to speak out loud,” she says.</p>
<p>During her school days, Mwangangi was a team leader in her class; a convener in both class and extracurricular activities. Dr Mwangangi has a master&rsquo;s degree in health economics and policy from the University of Adelaide, Australia (Photo: Standard/Edward Kiplimo)</p>
<p>Later, a master&rsquo;s degree in health economics and policy from the University of Adelaide in Australia gave her a wider lens with which she viewed Kenya’s health sector.</p>
<p>Mwangangi credits her two years in Australia with laying the foundation of who she has become. There, she says, she observed a different culture doing things that taught her the value of integrity.</p>
<p>“Back in Kenya, I always worked to make sure that every penny counted,” she says.</p>
<p>Mwangangi’s journey to the top has been anything but easy. She first volunteered to work unpaid for 18 months in the Health ministry while devolution was taking shape, before she was posted to the ministry’s monitoring and evaluation department.</p>
<p>Here, the young doctor got a good view of the entire health sector by interacting with all spheres in the ministry.</p>
<p>Soon, she was part of the team evaluating performance contracts and appraisals for the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF).</p>
<p>After five months of working on reports and presenting them to senior managers, at 29, Mwangangi was promoted to head the health financing division, which at the time was struggling to craft operational strategies.</p>
<p>In no time, the division was on its feet.</p>
<p>“This is the time we put together the Linda Mama programme for free maternity services, the health insurance strategy for the poor and many other initiatives, including the conditional grant framework for county governments,” she recounts.</p>
<p>Mwangangi served in the position for a year and a half before being moved to support the crafting of the Universal Healthcare (UHC) agenda into an actionable plan, together with four other officers.</p>
<p>During one of her presentations in Washington DC, the then Health CS Sicily Kariuki noticed the talented young doctor who was working in her ministry, albeit in obscurity.</p>
<p>Before long, Mwangangi, who would rather keep to herself working on figures to make sense of a certain health intervention, found herself serving as a technical advisor to the CS. Her biggest task was piloting UHC. Mwangangi sees her current position as the second-and-a-half phase of her life (Photo: Standard/Elvis Ogina)</p>
<p>Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, Mwangangi was synonymous with UHC. If anyone needed to know how a certain population should be included in the plan, she was the person to ask. If one needed to know how much money would be needed and how to finance UHC, she was the person to ask. To date, she says UHC remains close to her heart.</p>
<p>As the chief administrative secretary, the introvert was suddenly thrown into the limelight. She would no longer be the advisor to the Health ministry’s leadership, but be a leader herself.</p>
<p>And just when one would think that she has it all, that she has reached the pinnacle of her career, the soft-spoken doctor pulls another surprise: she still wants to become an orthopaedic surgeon.</p>
<p>After moving from a general practitioner to working in the public health sector and becoming a health economist, Mwangangi sees her current position as the second-and-a-half phase of her life.</p>
<p>“I believe in five iterations in one’s career. By the time you die, you should have five versions or five different spaces in which you have served,” she says.</p>
<p>She picked the mantra from Julie Bishop, one of her mentors, during her studies in Australia who took her through a leadership programme.</p>
<p>Although the position she holds has traditionally been clouded by politics, there is no strand of political ambition inside Mwangangi.</p>
<p>She says politics is not a priority at the moment, not with her hands full, learning how to translate the needs of communities into actionable plans and effect change, and dealing with the demands of the coronavirus pandemic and the UHC agenda.</p>
<p>“My mother says I’m married to my work,” she says.</p>
<p>Her mother could be right. The firstborn of two children, with a 10-year age gap between her and her younger brother, seems to be in no hurry to settle down.</p>
<p>Although she now sits in a bigger office, Mwangangi says she misses running up and down the wards at her first posting as a general practitioner in Meru. It kept her physically fit, she says.</p>
<p>“I’ve added weight from sitting in the office with no time to work out,” she quips.

<p>Seventeen more people in Kenya have tested positive for the coronavirus, raising the country&rsquo;s total number of confirmed cases to 320.</p>
<p>The Health ministry announced this in its daily update on Thursday, saying all the new patients were Kenyans.</p>
<p>Dr Mercy Mwangangi, the Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) in the ministry, said Mombasa County accounted for 12 of the cases and Nairobi County five.</p>
<p>Dr Mwangangi said 15 of the patients were found through surveillance and that two were in quarantine facilities.</p>
<p>Nine of the new patients were male and eight female, all between 22 and 60 years old.</p>
<p>The CAS said the 17 people were among 668 tested for the Covid-19 in the last 24 hours and that Nairobi still accounted for the bulk of samples, with a total of 478.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The ministry further reported that the number of recoveries in Kenya had risen to 89 as six more patients had been discharged after testing negative for the disease.</p>
<p>It also said that only two patients were in intensive care units and that the rest of the cases were mild.</p>
<p>Key concerns</p>
<p>The ministry noted that with focus on curbing local transmission of the virus, the public must continue adhering to the government&rsquo;s guidelines, the basic ones being social distancing and maintaining high standards of hygiene.</p>
<p>Dr Mwangangi noted, however, that while hand sanitisers are effective, soap and water are advisable.</p>
<p>She also addressed the matter of stigma, saying contracting the coronavirus is not a crime</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quarantine is not detention. It is for the public good and those quarantined must not be stigmatised,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quarantine remains an approach taken the world over. It has been impactful &hellip; we are working to improve the facilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While noting concerns about asymptomatic people, the ministry explained that they can transmit the virus, whose incubation period is between one and 14 days, the average being five to six days.</p>
<p>Dr Mwangangi further warned operators of passenger service vehicles against returning to normalcy, saying they risked punishment by the government.</p>
<p>Dr Patrick Amoth, the acting Director-General in the ministry, reiterated this and added that those who escaped from quarantine would face the government&rsquo;s wrath.</p>
<p>Statistics</p>
<p>The coronavirus was first reported in Wuhan, China, on December 31, 2019.</p>
<p>Since then, it has quickly spread across the world and infected at least 2,658,764 people, according to Worldometer&rsquo;s tally on April 23.</p>
<p>The total number of deaths was 185,439 and that of recoveries 729,982 as of April 23, while the number of active cases stood at 1,743,343, with three per cent or 57,981 of them being critical and the rest mild.</p>
<p>Worldometer&rsquo;s count showed that the number of closed cases was 915,421, with 80 per cent or 729,982 being the number of recoveries or those discharged.

<h3 id="three-kisii-mcas-county-official-arrested-drinking-during-curfew-hours-quarantined">Three Kisii MCAs, county official arrested drinking during curfew hours quarantined</h3>
<p><img src="https://3dwnh01icn0h133s00sokwo1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Samburu11.jpg" alt="img">
Police have arrested three Members of County Assembly and one county official in Kisii town for defying the curfew time.</p>
<p>The four were rounded up on Saturday evening by police officers while drinking in one of the local bars during the curfew hours.</p>
<p>The four alongside seven others have now been taken to Kenya Medical Training College in Kisii for a 14 days quarantine where they will be tested before they are released.</p>
<p>Speaking to Citizen TV, Kisii County Commander Jabeel Munene confirmed the incident adding that more sting operations will be conducted urging the public to tip off the police in case of such gatherings.</p>
<p>So far, 17 people have been put under quarantine in Kisii County for defiance of set protocols.</p>
<p>Last week the government announced that Kenyans found outside their houses during the dusk-to-dawn curfew will now be assumed to have been exposed to the coronavirus and will hence be placed under quarantine.</p>
<p>“Going forward, fellow Kenyans, all those who break the curfew rules will be assumed to have been in contact with suspected cases and hence will be quarantined for a period of 14 days,” Health Chief Administrative Secretary Dr. Mercy Mwangangi said last Sunday.</p>
<p>She said the government would utilise the Nyumba Kumi initiatives and technology to flush out individuals congregating in contravention of the measures set to contain the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>“We have activated the Nyumba Kumi initiative and, further to this, we shall now utilize technology in tracking and surveillance of any members of the public who are congregating post curfew hours,” said Dr. Mwangangi.</p>
<p>Health CS Mutahi Kagwe earlier announced that there were over 400 people quarantined for contravening the set directives.</p>
