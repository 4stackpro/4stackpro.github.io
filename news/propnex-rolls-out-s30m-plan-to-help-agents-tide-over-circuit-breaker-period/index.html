REAL estate agency PropNex on Monday announced a S$30 million support plan to help its 8,500 salespeople tide over the &ldquo;circuit breaker&rdquo; closure period mandated by the Singapore government.</p>
<p>The plan includes a S$25 million advance commission scheme which allows those who concluded and exercised deals before June 30, 2020 to apply for early release of interest-free commission capped at S$10,000 per person.</p>
<p>Developers generally take three to six months to release the commission, PropNex said.</p>
<p>The scheme also allows its salespeople, who are self-employed, to apply for early disbursement of commission for resale transactions submitted before March 31, 2020. The amount is capped at S$1,000 per transaction and limited to S$10,000 for each salesperson.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, PropNex&rsquo;s more than 250 team leaders or senior partners can apply for an advance on their management fee based on their average income for the last six months. This is capped at 50 per cent of the average income or S$10,000 per leader, whichever is lower.</p>

<p>The mainboard-listed firm also has a pension fund for its team leaders, and will release up to 40 per cent of the fund or S$10,000 per leader, whichever is lower. The pension fund monies are normally given to leaders after 10 years of employment, Ismail Gafoor, chief executive officer of PropNex Realty, told The Business Times.</p>
<p>Each team leader is able to obtain a total advance of up to S$30,000, PropNex said.</p>
<p>The company is also waiving its 2021 annual convention and training fee of S$128, payable by each of its 8,500 salespeople. Additionally, it will subsidise up to 50 per cent of continuing professional development (CPD) training fees. Salespeople are required to attend three CPD courses per year in order to renew their licences.</p>
<p>In addition, PropNex is passing on S$100,000 worth of government rental rebates to its salespeople. This includes a 25 per cent discount for rooms and fixed seats in May and June 2020.</p>
<p>Mr Ismail said PropNex has created a 28-day webinar training schedule for its salespeople throughout the &ldquo;circuit breaker&rdquo; period. The training will help to upgrade their skills and professionalism.</p>
<p>PropNex shares were up one Singapore cent or 2.2 per cent at 45.5 cents as at 11.55am on Monday.

<h3 id="cdl-steps-up-rental-rebates-for-retail-tenants-propnex-rolls-out-support-for-property-agents">CDL steps up rental rebates for retail tenants; PropNex rolls out support for property agents</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/articles/2020/04/06/fhcdl06_2x.jpg?itok=kXIuFQ8Q" alt="img">
SINGAPORE - One of Singapore&rsquo;s largest commercial landlords, City Developments Limited (CDL), is stepping up its help to retail tenants struggling with the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak, as firms like PropNex roll out measures for other stakeholders in the property industry.</p>
<p>CDL said on Monday (April 6) it will provide its retail tenants rental rebates of 100 per cent in April and 50 per cent in May. More support may be rolled out progressively after May as CDL monitors the situation closely. It has already given out rental rebates &ldquo;in a targeted manner&rdquo; to qualifying retail tenants in March.</p>
<p>Altogether, CDL has so far committed more than $17 million in property tax and rental rebates to help its office and retail tenants cope with the temporary business closures and disruptions from Covid-19, it said in its media release.</p>
<p>This amount includes - but also exceeds - the full quantum of the government&rsquo;s enhanced property tax rebates to be passed on to CDL&rsquo;s tenants.</p>
<p>Its announcement comes ahead of a Parliament sitting on Monday afternoon, when new legislation will be introduced to ensure landlords pass on the property tax rebates in full to their tenants. The enhanced rebates comprise the 100 per cent property tax rebate for qualifying commercial properties and 30 per cent for businesses in other non-residential properties such as offices and industrial properties.</p>
<p>CDL said on Monday tenants facing severe cash flow issues will be given more flexibility in rental payments.</p>
<p>Said the group: &ldquo;As the Covid-19 situation continues to evolve, with new regulations being put in place by the authorities, close engagement with tenants to understand their operating challenges is critical during this uncertain and difficult period. CDL is reviewing tenants&rsquo; requests on a case-by-case basis and will work hand in hand with tenants to support them and provide further assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CDL is landlord to a total of 426 retail tenants. They come from five malls, eight retail properties where the group owns strata-titled units and an additional four commercial properties with retail space. In terms of the trade mix, 36 per cent are in the food and beverage sector.</p>
<p>Group CEO Sherman Kwek said: &ldquo;We stand united alongside our tenants in these unprecedented times. While the Covid-19 situation looks likely to be prolonged and the authorities have just imposed stricter measures, nevertheless we must remain positive in our outlook and help one another to tide through this difficult period.&rdquo;</p>

<p>PropNex Realty, meanwile, announced on Monday a support package for its 8,500 real estate agents, as well as a $750,000 donation, comprising $250,000 for the needy in the community and frontline workers in the virus outbreak and $500,000 to the Community Chest.</p>
<p>CEO Ismail Gafoor said that in light of the &ldquo;circuit breaker&rdquo; measures that kick in on Tuesday, there will be further restrictions on the conduct of real estate business and the company was concerned for its salespersons&rsquo; cash flow situation.</p>
<p>To this end, PropNex has rolled out a plan, whose highlight is a $25 million advance commission scheme. Under this, property agents for new project launches can apply for the early release of their commissions, interest free, capped at $10,000 per person. Developers generally take three to six months to release the commissions. They can also apply for the early release of their commissions for eligible resale transactions, capped at $1,000 per transaction and limited to $10,000 per person.</p>
<p>The firm will also make advance payments on its pension fund and management fees for team leaders, waive or subsidise certain training fees and pass on rental rebates to its agents in the form of discounted or free room bookings.</p>
<p>The company is also appealing to otheer agencies on behalf of their agents to lower business costs.</p>
<p>It has written to the Professional Indemnity Insurance provider to request for a discount on the salesperson insurance premium.</p>
<p>It has also written to the Council of Estate Agencies, appealing for a total waiver of the $283.50 fee for agents to renew their licence next year, and for deferment of their Medisave top ups for 2020.

<h3 id="trade-alert-the-co-founder-of-propnex-limited-sgxoyy-mohamed-ismail-gafoore-has-just-spent-s133k-buying-shares">Trade Alert: The Co-Founder Of PropNex Limited (SGX:OYY), Mohamed Ismail Gafoore, Has Just Spent S$133k Buying Shares</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cs0IZSrD3T4ZN5aaabdoJg--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/ef74f3dd69aef5588a7cf3e7cae8bf78" alt="img">
Whilst it may not be a huge deal, we thought it was good to see that the PropNex Limited (SGX:OYY) Co-Founder, Mohamed Ismail Gafoore, recently bought S$133k worth of stock, for S$0.52 per share. However, we do note that it only increased their holding by 0.8%, and it wasn&rsquo;t a huge purchase by absolute value, either.</p>
<p>See our latest analysis for PropNex</p>
<p>The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At PropNex</p>
<p>Notably, that recent purchase by Co-Founder Mohamed Ismail Gafoore was not the only time they bought PropNex shares this year. They previously made an even bigger purchase of S$212k worth of shares at a price of S$0.51 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than S$0.50 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company&rsquo;s future. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.</p>
<p>PropNex insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn&rsquo;t sell any. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!</p>

<p>PropNex is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.</p>
<p>Insider Ownership</p>
<p>Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it&rsquo;s a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It appears that PropNex insiders own 22% of the company, worth about S$41m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it&rsquo;s enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.</p>
<p>So What Does This Data Suggest About PropNex Insiders?</p>
<p>The recent insider purchase is heartening. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. Given that insiders also own a fair bit of PropNex we think they are probably pretty confident of a bright future. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it&rsquo;s also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. In terms of investment risks, we&rsquo;ve identified 2 warning signs with PropNex and understanding these should be part of your investment process.</p>
<p>Of course PropNex may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions, but not derivative transactions.</p>
