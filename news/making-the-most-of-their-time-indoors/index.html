MOST Malaysians are observing the movement control order (MCO) by staying at home to help curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p>While some struggle with the restrictions imposed since March 18, others are trying to make the best of the situation.</p>
<p>StarMetro speaks to several students about how they are managing their time at home during the MCO.</p>
<p>Willing to comply</p>
<p>Brothers Nithilash, 11, and Tasvinlaash Dinesh Kumar, nine, initially found the idea of spending time at home exciting, but the novelty has worn off since the extension of the MCO until April 14.</p>
<p>“Before this, we would spend time at our grandfather’s house doing gardening and many other fun outdoor activities.</p>
<p>“When the MCO was announced, my parents advised us to follow the rules set by the authorities so we have not left home.</p>
<p>“We even stopped going to my grandfather’s house although it is only a 10-minute drive away,” said Nithilash.</p>
<p>The brothers from Kajang said their initial excitement over staying at home was due to the fact that everyone would be home too.</p>
<p>However, the mundane routine has got to them as they are stuck indoors, doing the same thing every day.</p>
<p>Tasvinlaash said the brothers would usually engage in electronic games, do art and crafts, watch television, play basketball in the porch and also challenge each other in board games.</p>
<p>“I also help my mother in the kitchen, complete my homework and do some revision,” said Tasvinlaash, who attends a Chinese school with his brother.</p>
<p>Nithilash said their parents would usually decide how the brothers should spend their time.</p>
<p>“They tell us what needs to be done. If we have been playing games for too long, they tell us to read storybooks or help clean the house or take a nap,” he added.</p>
<p>The brothers shared that since the start of the MCO, they have not been scolded by their parents – a plus point for the two.</p>
<p>“Staying at home has its benefits as we have been obedient and do not get scolded much,” Nithilash chuckled.</p>
<p>Chance for self-reflection</p>
<p>Kedah-born Muhammad Firdaus Hakiki Ja’afar, 18, is taking the MCO as an opportunity to brush up on his artistic talents.</p>
<p>The student, who is active in the singing club at the university he attends in Petaling Jaya, spends time playing the guitar and singing songs by various artistes and bands.</p>
<p>He said he was able to come up with new ideas in music composition and song writing since the implementation of the MCO.</p>
<p>“Apart from being involved in my music and tuning in to streaming services, I also watch television and get updates from news channels or read online reports on the Covid-19 situation.</p>
<p>“On rare occasions, I play computer games.”</p>
<p>Firdaus said it was also a good time for spiritual self-reflection and to improve family ties.</p>
<p>He does not mind being cooped up at home for a month, although he does not discount the fact that boredom is likely to set in soon.</p>
<p>For Muhammad Sharil Aizat Mohd Fareez Gopalakrishnan, 18, who enjoys spending time with friends, the stay-at-home rule appears to be quite challenging.</p>
<p>“Before this, my friends and I would go hiking and food hunting around Petaling Jaya.</p>
<p>“I am now on my semester break. I have no important assignments to complete and cannot spend time as usefully as I usually do.</p>
<p>“I am restless most of the time, and end up eating, watching movies or playing computer games. I have been doing the same thing for hours since the enforcement of the MCO,” he said.</p>
<p>“I am extremely bored at home as I cannot hang out with my friends and have fun.</p>
<p>“But one benefit derived from this restriction order is that my family is closer now than ever. We see each other daily and we dine together, which was something rare before the MCO.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, I would help my mother in the kitchen. I cherish these moments as my family relationship has greatly improved.</p>
<p>“However, I do hope the situation with the outbreak will improve for all of us,” Sharil added.</p>
<p>College student Chua Jiarong, 18, from Kuching spends his time editing videos, reading storybooks, practising the piano, playing video games and watching television.</p>
<p>Most importantly, he appreciates being able to spend quality time with his family.</p>
<p>“I am aware and concerned about the situation as it is the first time we have had to face such a serious pandemic. I am also afraid that my family and I may get infected,” he said.</p>
<p>Chua encouraged everyone to keep calm and practise social distancing as instructed.</p>
<p>Maximising efficiency</p>
<p>Yin Zhang Hui, 18, who is waiting to enter Form Six is using the free time to help out at her family-owned durian and banana orchard in Pahang.</p>
<p>“We only do what is required to care for the crops and head home right after,” Yin said.</p>
<p>Although the area she lives in is less populated, the family still gets requests from people who want to visit the farm.</p>
<p>“We have turned down these requests and advised people to stay indoors to help fight the pandemic,” she added.</p>
<p>Thirteen-year-old Jasmine Chai Zi Xin has managed to do many things despite being confined at home.</p>
<p>“I have spent my time quite well. There is an online class from 9am until noon to prepare for our upcoming mid-term examination.</p>
<p>“Apart from doing some digital drawings and bullet journaling, I also cleaned my room, cared for my dogs and played the violin. I have designed some of my own stickers too,” she said.</p>
<p>Form Five student Wong Kar Yuen, 17, from Subang Jaya is taken the MCO as an opportunity to appreciate quality time with her family and her pet at home.</p>
<p>“I have been eating healthy, studying and getting sufficient rest. I keep myself updated with the latest Covid-19 news and most importantly, stay home at all times.</p>
<p>“I have also been working out to boost my immunity, participating in online meetings with my school band and brushing up on my piano skills,” she said.</p>
<p>Kar Yuen said she was thankful for the relentless efforts of the frontliners in saving and protecting others.</p>
<p>Esther Gan Yuen Ern, 16, from Seremban, is spending much</p>
<p>of her time practising for her upcoming Grade 8 piano examination.</p>
<p>“I am also revising my lessons and doing homework,” she said. She added that she was sad that many were infected by Covid-19 and hoped the situation would improve soon.</p>

<h3 id="coronavirus-the-four-other-times-the-queen-has-addressed-the-nation">Coronavirus: The four other times the Queen has addressed the nation</h3>
<p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10A53/production/_110497186_queen2reuters.jpg" alt="img">

<p>The Queen&rsquo;s televised address to the nation on Sunday night, in response to the coronavirus crisis, is only the fifth time the monarch has given such a speech in her 68-year reign.</p>
<p>While her Christmas Day message is an annual event, only rarely has she made rallying speeches at key moments in the life of the nation - predominantly at times of crisis and grief.</p>
<p>Now at a time when the UK faces what the prime minister has described as the &lsquo;&lsquo;worst public health crisis for a generation&rdquo;, the Queen is addressing the nation again.</p>
<p>So when were the four times the Queen previously addressed the nation in this way, and why?</p>
<p>Queen&rsquo;s Diamond Jubilee message, June 2012</p>
<p>The Queen&rsquo;s televised speech at the time of her Diamond Jubilee marked a moment of celebration. In the speech, which was broadcast around the world, she said she was &ldquo;deeply touched&rdquo; to see so many people celebrating the 60th anniversary of her accession to the throne. She said then that she hoped memories of the happy events that took place across the UK to mark the occasion would &ldquo;brighten lives for many years to come&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On the death of the Queen Mother, April 2002</p>
<p>A decade before, the Queen had chosen to specially address the nation on the eve of her mother&rsquo;s funeral in 2002.</p>
<p>She said she had been deeply moved by the outpouring of affection, following the death of her &ldquo;beloved mother&rdquo; at the age of 101. In her speech, the Queen said she hoped the funeral would be a chance for thanksgiving, not just of her mother&rsquo;s life, but the times she had lived in. She described it as &ldquo;a century for this country and the Commonwealth, not without its trials and sorrow, but also one of extraordinary progress, full of examples of courage and service, as well as fun and laughter&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Image caption The Queen and Prince Philip leave Westminster Abbey after the Queen Mother&rsquo;s funeral</p>
<p>On the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, September 1997</p>
<p>The Queen also addressed the nation on the eve of the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales. While other special addresses have been pre-recorded, this was broadcast live to the nation from the balcony at Buckingham Palace. Outside and clearly visible behind the Queen were crowds of thousands who had gathered outside the palace gates to lay flowers and pay tribute.</p>
<p>The Queen&rsquo;s broadcast came after she returned to London from Balmoral, in Scotland, where she had been with her grandsons, William and Harry, after the sudden death of their mother in a car crash in Paris.</p>
<p>The language the Queen used in the broadcast was deeply personal. She said she was speaking &ldquo;from the heart&rdquo; as &ldquo;your Queen and as a grandmother&rdquo;. She paid a personal tribute to Diana, saying she had been an &ldquo;exceptional and gifted human being&rdquo; and that she &ldquo;admired and respected her for her energy and commitment to others and especially for her devotion to her two boys&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Her speech reflected on the &ldquo;extraordinary and moving reaction&rdquo; to Diana&rsquo;s death which saw many thousands of people pay their respects, laying flowers and tributes. The Queen said the funeral was an opportunity to express grief over Diana&rsquo;s death and gratitude for her life, while also providing an opportunity to &ldquo;show to the whole world the British nation united in grief and respect&rdquo;.</p>
<p>At the time of the first Gulf War, February 1991</p>
<p>The Queen made a statement at the beginning of the land war in Iraq on 24 February 1991. She spoke then of the nation&rsquo;s pride in its armed forces and her hope that the nation would unite and pray for a &ldquo;swift&rdquo; success. She said she hoped this could be achieved with &ldquo;as small a cost in human life and suffering as possible,&rdquo; adding that &ldquo;then may the true reward of their courage be granted, a just and lasting peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In making her addresses to the nation she has followed in the footsteps of her father King George VI, who took to the wireless on 3 September 1939 to make his historic speech to those listening at home and abroad at the start of World War Two.</p>
<p>Speaking about the necessity of war, he said: &ldquo;For the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear and of the world order and peace, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She warned that the task would be hard and that there would be &ldquo;dark days ahead&rdquo;, adding that war could &ldquo;no longer be confined to the battlefield.&rdquo;

<h3 id="seamlesss-pandemic-initiatives-are-predatory-and-exploitative-and-its-time-to-stop-using-them--techcrunch">Seamless’s pandemic initiatives are predatory and exploitative, and it’s time to stop using them – TechCrunch</h3>
<p><img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1192958583.jpg?w=600" alt="img">
Times are exceptionally hard, especially for local restaurants, which were always in a precarious business even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit. But when times are hard, people pull together, right? Or at least they don’t take advantage of the suffering and desperate to exploit and profit from them. Right?</p>
<p>We’d all like to think so, but it’s not always true. Case in point: GrubHub, which owns Seamless. Do the math, and you’ll see they are hurting, not helping, restaurants they pretend they’re trying to support.</p>
<p>GrubHub recently rolled out a “Supper for Support” promotion which is, to quote New Yorker writer Helen Rosner, “strongarming client restaurants into giving customers a discount, but charging restaurants their platform commission fee on the pre-discount total.” This follows a so-called, widely reviled “relief program” which only defers fees, without reducing them — unlike Doordash/Caviar — and requires those suckered into it to remain on GrubHub for a full year.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it works when restaurants give diners a discount and Grubhub makes money on the pre-discount totals: Restaurants give away free product, pay even more to GrubHub than usual. Grubhub contributes nothing, extracts extra cash from restaurants they&rsquo;re professing to save. pic.twitter.com/BhRF9ZVlHD — Helen Rosner (@hels) March 30, 2020</p>
<p>The fees charged by all meal delivery services are already extreme: “typically, 20 to 30 percent per order,” sometimes more. They were often ruinous to restaurants even in better times. GrubHub’s fees can easily total more than a third of the pre-tax total, by their own calculations.</p>
<p>Now they are taking advantage of the desperation caused by this massive global crisis, and exploiting the natural inclination of stressed, frightened and sleepless people to reach for any lifeline, no matter how catastrophic, in the hope of keeping their lights on and their people employed. GrubHub hypocritically claims to be “supporting the restaurants you love,” while actually trying to increase their own share of the take. This is despicable.</p>
<p>Infuriated, I reached out to the company for comment. No actual GrubHub employee could apparently be bothered to defend their actions, but a hired PR flack wrote back saying:</p>
<p>Grubhub is always looking for ways to increase sales for its independent restaurant partners, especially during these critical and challenging times. The optional Supper and Support effort does exactly that. In fact, local restaurants that chose to participate in the optional initiative have, on average, seen a more than 20 percent increase in the number of orders they have received as well as overall sales. We are proud of that and will continue to try to connect them with hungry diners and grow their businesses.</p>
<p>This enraged me even more. The GrubHub program is “optional” for your local restaurateurs, who are hanging on for dear life, in the same way that a lifeline laced with contact poison is “optional” when offered to a drowning man. It is “optional” with the unspoken subtext that if a restaurant doesn’t opt in, other restaurants might use it to siphon business from them. It is a program that monetizes others’ suffering.</p>
<p>Does a 20% increase in orders sound good? Don’t be fooled. Do the math. Obviously “$10 off on orders over $30” incentivizes people to keep orders small, to maximize their discount percentages. Consider 100 $40 orders from which GrubHub would normally take 30%, or $12 from each. That would leave the restaurant with $2800. Already very painful, as you can see…</p>
<p>…but now take those 100 orders, and apply this promotion and its vaunted “more than 20% growth.” Heck, make it 30% growth. That means 130 orders, for which customers now pay only $30. But GrubHub still takes $12 each … so the restaurant now keeps only $2340, far less than they would have made without the promotion.</p>
<p>It gets even worse. The smaller the order size, the crueler the math gets for the restaurants. According to GrubHub’s 2019 results, last year it had $5.9 billion in gross food sales, and 492,300 orders per day, meaning an average order price of … $32.83. Yes, that’s right: Using the average order price from GrubHub’s own announced results, and a 30% commission rate, even with 50% order growth — double the “more than 20%” they trumpet — restaurants participating in this program will still lose huge. I invite you to do the math yourself.</p>
<p>The PR flack subsequently went on to proudly note a new addendum to the program, wherein “each restaurant will receive $250 from GrubHub to enable it to give $10 off any order of $30 or more.” This is even more maddening yet. $250 is much less than 1% of average restaurant monthly revenue. Weigh that against inflating GrubHub’s take to as much as 45%, on $30 orders, through this predatory “offer the customer a $10 discount, but pay our commissions as if you hadn’t” promotion. You’ll quickly see that this $250 is an empty gesture which does not affect the numbers in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>There is a legitimate discussion to be had, sometimes, about the merits of pricing some items higher in times of high demand due to emergencies, so that their production and availability will increase. This is in no way part of that legitimate discussion. This is pure price gouging by GrubHub, and making it optional isn’t much of a fig leaf at a time when restaurants, like so many other establishments, have literally never been so needy and desperate.</p>
<p>People need to eat, and people want to support their local restaurants. The best way to do so is to buy directly from them. If you use a delivery service, ~20-30% of your money goes to the service rather than the restaurant. Many restaurants are now offering their own delivery, curbside pickup, etc., for the first time.</p>
<p>That said, delivery services remain the best or only option for some. But if you must use one, and if you have even a shred of basic human decency, don’t support predatory gouging that manifestly hurts the people it claims to help.
