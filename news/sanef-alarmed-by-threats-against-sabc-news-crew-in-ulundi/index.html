On Saturday, the team was reporting on the impact of the national lockdown on rural communities when it was allegedly blocked and threatened by a group not related to the story.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - The South African National Editors’ Forum (Sanef) on Sunday said it was alarmed to hear of the harassment of a SABC News crew in Ulundi, KwaZulu-Natal while working on a story.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the team was reporting on the impact of the national lockdown on rural communities when it was allegedly blocked and threatened by a group not related to the story.</p>
<p>In a statement, Sanef said some community members came to the news crew’s rescue.</p>
<p>“Thanks to the swift action of members of the Ulundi SAPS, the journalists were not injured. However, Sanef believes that journalists doing essential work – and keeping the public informed – should never be subjected to such traumatic experiences. Community members threatened to burn the SABC news vehicle,” the statement said.</p>
<p>Sanef called on community leaders - including traditional leaders in KZN and across the country - to ensure that citizens were clearly informed about the media’s right to be out in the field as designated essential workers during the national lockdown.</p>
<p>“We have a critical job to play to responsibly inform and educate the public about the spread and containment of the virus.</p>
<p>“In this case, it appears that community members turned against the media out of frustration due to their poverty and due to a lack of service delivery.”</p>
<p>Sanef said it was working with local and national media bodies including the Committee to Protect Journalists and Media Monitoring Africa to monitor safety issues.</p>
<p>“From our side, we are satisfied that the media has complied with government regulations and that journalists in the field are equipped with the relevant press cards and permits to allow their free movement to cover all areas of the country.</p>
<p>“To ensure the safety and protection of journalists Sanef has called on all media organisations to make sure their staff are kitted with the relevant protective gear.”

<h3 id="coronavirus--sabc-backs-its-programming-after-anc-led-alliance-questions-output">Coronavirus | SABC backs its programming after ANC-led alliance questions output</h3>
<p><img src="http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10070/753d87e54f7a40caafb1f132b63e6fc1.jpg" alt="img">
The SABC has defended its programming after a letter penned by the ANC-led tripartite alliance emerged criticising the public broadcaster for &ldquo;not fulfilling its mandate&rdquo; during the national lockdown to halt the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p>Speaking to News24, SABC spokesperson Mmoni Seapolelo said the public broadcaster was firmly committed to adhering to and delivering diligently on its mandate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Critically, during this period the public broadcaster&rsquo;s role is to ensure that millions of South Africans are provided with important and credible information regarding Covid-19 across television, radio and digital platforms. This is consistent with nationwide efforts to reduce Covid-19 infections and curb the spread of the coronavirus,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, News24 reported that the trio of ANC secretary general Ace Magashule, SACP first deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila and Cosatu&rsquo;s general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali wrote to President Cyril Ramaphosa, raising the matter of the public broadcaster&rsquo;s content during this period.</p>
<p>In their letter, the tripartite alliance secretariat said the SABC must marshal all resources at its disposal and play a leading role in the fight against the pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In particular, the people need more educational, informative and consistent broadcasting on Covid-19 including live coverage of key events on SABC free-to-air television stations,&rdquo; the secretariat said.</p>

<p>Seapolelo, however, denied that not enough informative content was on its channels, citing the SABC&rsquo;s partnership with the education department to broadcast a learner support campaign. The drive is geared at delivering educational programming during the lockdown period.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Displace revenue-generating programming&rsquo;</p>
<p>The first phase of the campaign is being broadcast on SABC1, with the second phase to be rolled out on SABC2 and SABC3, Seapolelo said.</p>
<p>She added news, current affairs and informative programming have been extended on free-to-air television channels and radio stations to ensure that the public is adequately informed about the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the interest of the country and in fulfillment of its mandate, the SABC has had to displace revenue-generating programming across platforms to accommodate all public announcements and media briefings relating to the Covid-19 pandemic,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are now carried live on the SABC&rsquo;s free-to-air television channels, the SABC News channel, radio stations and digital platforms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consistently, SABC News journalists are deployed across the country to deliver the essential service of informing the public about all developments regarding the pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the SABC, we welcome engagement with and feedback from our stakeholders, and we would like to reiterate our unwavering commitment to providing citizens with valuable and factual news and information during this period.&rdquo;
