“Anyone who saw that press conference would have been reminded of his limitations as a communicator,” said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary, University of London. “Sometimes a crisis can see a caterpillar turn into a butterfly, but I rather doubt that will happen here.”</p>
<p>As the first secretary of state in Mr. Johnson’s government, Mr. Raab has formally been his deputy since Mr. Johnson won leadership of Britain’s Conservative Party last year. That left little doubt that he would be the government’s “designated survivor,” the stand-in should Mr. Johnson fall ill.</p>
<p>But his responsibilities have grown far more quickly than anyone expected. He has already led meetings with the powerful heads of each facet of the government’s coronavirus response this week. And he will lead cabinet meetings and make decisions on Mr. Johnson’s behalf if the prime minister cannot do so himself from intensive care.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson’s office has said the prime minister is still breathing on his own and has not been put on a ventilator. But his prognosis remains uncertain, and the government has been cagey about his condition since he tested positive for the virus last month.</p>
<p>During his decade as a Conservative lawmaker, Mr. Raab’s most influential moment may have come in 2018 when he resigned from the cabinet of Mr. Johnson’s predecessor, Theresa May, after only four months in his job.</p>
<p>A hard-line Brexit backer, he resigned in protest of the draft withdrawal agreement that he had ostensibly helped to negotiate as Mrs. May’s Brexit secretary. In truth, he had only limited influence over the deal, which envisioned Britain keeping some distant ties to the European Union after Brexit. But he became part of a parade of pro-Brexit lawmakers angry at Mrs. May’s plan who helped force her to step down as Conservative Party leader and prime minister.

<h3 id="who-is-dominic-raab">Who is Dominic Raab?</h3>
<p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1529C/production/_111448668_mediaitem111448667.jpg" alt="img">

<p>Downing Street says Boris Johnson has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to deputise for the PM &ldquo;where necessary,&rdquo; while Mr Johnson is in intensive care with coronavirus.</p>
<p>So who is he?</p>
<p>Less than three years ago, Dominic Raab wasn&rsquo;t even in the government.</p>
<p>But now, as foreign secretary and first secretary of state, he is the de-facto second-in-command to Mr Johnson.</p>
<p>That means he could take over running the government for a while if the prime minister sees his health worsen.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an opportunity Mr Raab, a 46-year-old former lawyer, would relish, under normal circumstances.</p>
<p>The staunch Brexiteer ran for the Conservative Party leadership last year but he was knocked out in the second round of voting by MPs.</p>
<p>Prior to that he had run-ins with Mr Johnson&rsquo;s predecessor, Theresa May, quitting her cabinet after just over four months as Brexit secretary.</p>
<p>The sometimes outspoken Mr Raab has had a volatile time - going in and out of favour - since becoming Conservative MP for Esher and Walton, Surrey, in 2010.</p>
<p>Who is Dominic Raab?</p>
<p>Image copyright Getty Images</p>
<p>Date of birth: 25 February 1974 (age 46)</p>
<p>Job: Foreign secretary, Conservative MP for Esher and Walton</p>
<p>Education: Dr Challoner&rsquo;s Grammar School, Amersham, Oxford and Cambridge universities</p>
<p>Family: Married to Erika Ray, a Brazilian marketing executive. Two sons</p>
<p>Before politics: Foreign Office lawyer. He was the lead on a team focusing on bringing war criminals to justice at The Hague</p>
<p>A married father of two, Mr Raab was born in 1974, the son of a Czech-born Jewish refugee who fled the Nazis in 1938.</p>
<p>He was was brought up in Buckinghamshire and attended Dr Challoner&rsquo;s Grammar School in Amersham, before studying law at Oxford University and switching to Cambridge for his master&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>He worked as a lawyer in the commercial sector and the Foreign Office before entering politics in 2006 as an aide to Brexit-supporting Conservative MP David Davis, and then Remain-backing Dominic Grieve.</p>
<p>First elected to Parliament in 2010, the following year Mr Raab angered then-Home Secretary Theresa May by describing some feminists as &ldquo;obnoxious bigots&rdquo; in an online article also claiming men were getting &ldquo;a raw deal&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mrs May accused him of fuelling &ldquo;gender warfare&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mr Raab remained on the back benches for five years after becoming an MP.</p>
<p>But the karate black-belt became a junior justice minister following David Cameron&rsquo;s general election victory in 2015.</p>
<p>He played a prominent role in the successful Leave campaign in the 2016 EU referendum, but was sacked by Mrs May when she took over as prime minister.</p>
<p>Cabinet role</p>
<p>In 2017, Mr Raab was branded &ldquo;offensive&rdquo; by then-Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron after saying &ldquo;the typical user of a food bank is not someone that&rsquo;s languishing in poverty; it&rsquo;s someone who has a cash flow problem&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But in June that year he returned to government, as a justice minister, this time middle-ranking rather than junior.</p>
<p>In Mrs May&rsquo;s January 2018 reshuffle he became housing minister - one of the highest-profile non-cabinet roles in government.</p>
<p>And in July that year, when Mr Davis quit, the prime minister promoted Mr Raab to Brexit secretary, a cabinet post.</p>
<p>Yet his improved relationship with Mrs May did not last long. In November 2018, he quit, criticising her position on Brexit.</p>
<p>He argued that he could not &ldquo;in good conscience&rdquo; support the &ldquo;backstop&rdquo; arrangement designed to avoid a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Image copyright Reuters Image caption Dominic Raab met US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in London in January</p>
<p>As an influential Brexiteer, his comments were seen as significant in increasing opposition to Mrs May&rsquo;s withdrawal agreement with the EU, which MPs repeatedly rejected.</p>
<p>After Mrs May announced she was standing down last year, Mr Raab entered the contest to become Conservative leader, and prime minister.</p>
<p>In a crowded field, he failed to get the 33 MPs&rsquo; votes he needed to progress to the third round. Fellow Brexiteers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove outlasted him.</p>
<p>Mark Francois, one of the most strongly pro-Brexit of Tory MPs, said: &ldquo;Whoever wins, and I hope it&rsquo;s Boris, I hope they find a good place for Dom in their cabinet, because I think he deserves it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Johnson, to whom Mr Raab gave his support after his elimination from the the race, did just that. On 24 July last year he became foreign secretary and first secretary of state - effectively deputy prime minister.</p>
<p>The new job gave him an international profile surpassed only by Mr Johnson&rsquo;s, in terms of the UK government.</p>
<p>But he only narrowly managed to hold on to Esher and Walton at last December&rsquo;s general election, seeing off a strong Liberal Democrat challenged by 2,743 votes.</p>
<p>The overall Conservative landslide, however, on a promise to &ldquo;get Brexit done&rdquo;, meant he saw his dream of leaving the EU come true on 31 January this year.</p>
<p>Since then coronavirus has taken over from Brexit as the UK government&rsquo;s number one priority, although tough negotiations on a trade deal with Brussels are continuing, via video link.</p>
<p>Now Mr Raab, as well as being first secretary of state, has effectively taken over running the country as Mr Johnson is being treated in hospital for coronavirus.

<p><img src="https://i.insider.com/5e8add4db3b0921d111a9536?width=1200&amp;format=jpeg" alt="img">
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been hospitalized and is in intensive care after experiencing &ldquo;persistent symptoms&rdquo; of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>As first secretary of state, Dominic Raab will stand in for the prime minister while Johnson is in the hospital.</p>
<p>Raab has caused controversy with his political views and comments about women.</p>
<p>The news that Raab would deputize for Johnson was received like &ldquo;a cup of cold sick&rdquo; by his cabinet rivals, according to one report.</p>
<p>Colleagues believe he lacks the emotional intelligence required for the role, with some rivals keen to assume his position as Johnson&rsquo;s deputy.</p>
<p>Visit Business Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>The news that Boris Johnson has been hospitalized and is in intensive care for the coronavirus has led to speculation about what would happen if the UK prime minister became too ill to remain in his job.</p>
<p>Downing Street has insisted that the prime minister will remain in charge of the government while in the hospital.</p>
<p>However, Dominic Raab, the UK&rsquo;s foreign secretary, will stand in for him at an emergency UK government meeting on the coronavirus Monday morning.</p>
<p>Raab has served in Johnson&rsquo;s government since he became prime minister in July and holds the honorary title of &ldquo;first secretary of state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is this secondary position that means he will stand in for the prime minister in the event of serious illness and could ultimately replace him.</p>
<p>So who is Raab, and could he end up as Britain&rsquo;s next prime minister?</p>
<p>A Brexit hard-liner who campaigned to leave the EU</p>
<p>Raab is a vocal Brexiteer and close ally of the prime minister. Both men supported &ldquo;Vote Leave,&rdquo; the official Brexit campaign, before the referendum in 2016.</p>
<p>Raab was first elected to Parliament in 2010 after previously training as a solicitor.</p>
<p>He fulfilled some junior ministerial roles in former Prime Minister Theresa May&rsquo;s government before he was promoted to her Cabinet as Brexit secretary in July 2018.</p>
<p>However, Raab didn&rsquo;t last long in the job, holding the role for only a few months before resigning in protest over what he saw as May&rsquo;s insufficient Brexit policy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot reconcile the terms of the proposed deal with the promises we made to the country in our manifesto at the last election,&rdquo; Raab wrote to May. &ldquo;This is, at its heart, a matter of public trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In resigning, he joined Johnson, who had also stepped down from May&rsquo;s Cabinet for the House of Commons&rsquo; backbenches just months earlier.</p>
<p>A controversial figure who has enemies inside the government</p>
<p>The news that Raab would stand in for Johnson should he become too ill, which was confirmed in The Times by his aides, was received like &ldquo;a cup of cold sick&rdquo; by his cabinet rivals, according to Katy Balls, Spectator magazine&rsquo;s deputy political editor.</p>
<p>Some colleagues believe he lacks emotional intelligence and fear he would struggle to rise to the occasion if he were forced to step into Johnson&rsquo;s shoes, Balls wrote.</p>
<p>Raab has occasionally caused controversy over his hard-line views. In 2011, he said &ldquo;feminists are now amongst the most obnoxious bigots&rdquo; in the UK.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the cradle to the grave, men are getting a raw deal,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Men work longer hours, die earlier, but retire later than women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raab stood by that position last year, saying in a BBC interview that it was &ldquo;really important that in the debate on equality we have a consistency and not double standards and hypocrisy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In response to Raab&rsquo;s comments, Labour Member of Parliament Jess Phillips told the channel: &ldquo;Everybody in Westminster knows that Dominic Raab does not have the women in the country&rsquo;s interests at heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raab has rivals</p>

<p>Some of Raab&rsquo;s rivals believe there are other candidates who would be more obvious for the role of acting prime minister.</p>
<p>Rishi Sunak, the newly appointed UK chancellor, has received heavy praise for his performance during press conferences on Downing Street, where he announced a historically large package of support for firms and workers.</p>
<p>Polling after the performance showed he was even more popular than the prime minister. Raab, by contrast, has an approval rating of minus 17%.</p>
<p>Michael Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, is also considered by many Conservative MPs as a safer pair of hands than Raab because he has more cabinet experience and significantly more ministerial ability.
