NORMAN — The University of Oklahoma Athletics Department and the K20 Center for Educational and Community Renewal have announced a joint project to provide educational resources for families during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The goal of the project is to provide parents and students with high-quality, OU-branded at-home-learning activities that can be used to help supplement online learning while schools remain closed. These activities also provide a great opportunity for parents and students to work together.</p>
<p>The at-home-learning activities series is a collaborative effort between OU Athletics and the K20 Center that covers a variety of topics for students in grades K–8. The two-part series is comprised of 12 separate learning activities in all core subject areas, as well as college/career preparedness. Both issues contain six downloadable PDF lessons with activities for students and parents, along with a guide to help parents lead their students&rsquo; learning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hope this is a time when we can give back a little to our many fans and Oklahomans who mean so much to us.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Joe Castiglione</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;We appreciate the challenge that parents and young students are facing at this time and wanted to do our part to help distribute the incredible K20 work,&rdquo; said OU Vice President and Director of Athletics Joe Castiglione . &ldquo;Our department is proud of the many aspects of our campus community. The wonderful K20 staff is recognized for its outstanding work and we are grateful to everyone involved. We are honored to partner with them to assist parents and students as they learn at home. We hope this is a time when we can give back a little to our many fans and Oklahomans who mean so much to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The K20 Center is an education research organization located on the University of Oklahoma&rsquo;s Norman campus that has been positively impacting Oklahoma for nearly 25 years. The K20 Center offers a wealth of innovative and research-validated services to Oklahoma schools and educators, including digital game-based learning, a repository of lessons ready for use in the classroom, and professional development opportunities for teachers and school administrators.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The K20 Center is excited to partner with OU Athletics on this important project that will provide students and parents with some much-needed home learning activities during this difficult time,&rdquo; said Dr. Leslie Williams, director of the K20 Center. &ldquo;Now, more than ever, it is important for us to support education and to find innovative ways to reach students. This is a great opportunity to further our mission of outreach, to help parents, and to keep Oklahoma&rsquo;s young people engaged in learning and focused on their bright futures.&rdquo;</p>

Do you appreciate the work we do as the only independent media outlet dedicated to serving OU students, faculty, staff and alumni on campus and around the world for more than 100 years?</p>
<p>Then consider helping fund our endeavors. Around the world, communities are grappling with what journalism is worth and how to fund the civic good that robust news organizations can generate. We believe The OU Daily and Crimson Quarterly magazine provide real value to this community both now by covering OU, and tomorrow by helping launch the careers of media professionals.</p>
