<p>Coronavirus has claimed 26 more lives in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
<p>And 701 new cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed by the Department of Health.</p>
<p>The death toll here now stands at 1,087. There is now a total of 19,262 confirmed cases of the infection in Ireland.</p>
<p>A statement from the National Public Health Emergency Team said: &ldquo;The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has today been informed that a total of 26 people with COVID-19 have died, of which 23 were laboratory confirmed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The latest data from the HPSC, relating to the 18,431 cases recorded as of midnight, Friday, April 24,shows that:</p>
<p>57% are female and 42% are male</p>
<p>the median age of confirmed cases is 49 years</p>
<p>2,576 cases (14%) have been hospitalised</p>
<p>Of those hospitalised, 349 cases have been admitted to ICU</p>
<p>5,064 cases are associated with healthcare workers</p>
<p>Dublin has the highest number of cases at 9,224 (50% of all cases) followed by Cork with 1,110 cases (6%)</p>
<p>Of those for whom transmission status is known: community transmission accounts for 63%, close contact accounts for 33%, travel abroad accounts for 4%</p>
<p>The HSE said it is working to identify any contacts the patients may have had to provide them with information and advice to prevent further spread.</p>
<p>(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)</p>
<p>It comes after the new second person under the age of 25 has died from the infection in Ireland, new data shows.</p>
<p>Figures from the Health Surveillance Protection Centre on Sunday revealed that a patient aged between 15 and 24 has passed away from Covid-19.</p>
<p>This is the second case in this age bracket, following the death of a 23-year-old which was announced on April 15.</p>
<p>However, no details about these cases have been released so it is unknown whether they had underlying conditions or not.</p>
<p>The health chiefs have also not revealed the gender or location of the two youngest deaths linked to the virus in Ireland.</p>

<h3 id="woman-drops-action-as-mother-tests-covid-19-positive">Woman drops action as mother tests Covid-19 positive</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.rasset.ie/0011d4df-1600.jpg" alt="img">
A woman who took a High Court action aimed at having her elderly mother moved out of a nursing home because of concerns about Covid-19 has dropped the action because her mother has now tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>The daughter made an application to court last Monday during which the court heard she was concerned that her mother&rsquo;s room was on a corridor with other rooms occupied by Covid-19 patients.</p>
<p>She was also concerned that the same healthcare staff were moving between rooms.</p>
<p>When the case returned to court today, Mr Justice Richard Humphreys was told the woman&rsquo;s test for Covid-19 was positive but that she was doing reasonably well.</p>
<p>The woman, who is aged in her 90s, is a ward of court, meaning any decisions about her care had to be approved by the High Court.</p>
<p>Today the judge was told the HSE had engaged a consultant geriatrician to assess the woman and his report would be made available to the parties.</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s interests are represented by the general solicitor for wards of court who was appointed because the woman&rsquo;s adult children disagreed on the nature of her care.</p>
<p>Nuala Jackson SC, for the daughter, said a level of agreement had been reached.</p>
<p>Ms Jackson said she wanted certain court directions concerning the nursing home&rsquo;s policy on communications with residents and their relatives of clinical decisions and test results.</p>
<p>The Covid test result was not directly communicated to the daughter by the nursing home, counsel said.</p>
<p>Ms Jackson also raised issues about how a Do Not Resuscitate notice was previously put in place for the mother.</p>
<p>While other siblings of her client seemed to have consented to that, her client was not aware of this &ldquo;very distressing news&rdquo; until this week.</p>
<p>Counsel for the HSE Donal McGuinness said it was the view of a consultant geriatrician that the DNR notice was in the woman&rsquo;s best interests and was an appropriate clinical decision.</p>
<p>Resuscitation would cause great and unnecessary pain, the court was told.</p>
<p>Counsel for the general solicitor Natalie McDonnell accepted the DNR, which was made before the woman was made a ward of court, should remain in place.</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s daughter wished to see the consultant&rsquo;s report but was not seeking an alternative order at this point.</p>
<p>Mr Justice Humphreys directed the DNR remain in place unless an alternative view is taken by the woman&rsquo;s treating medical team or pending any application brought on medical evidence.</p>
<p>He also directed the nursing home to provide its general communications policy, and how that was applied in this case, to the parties.

<h3 id="inclusion-ireland-concerned-over-care-home-outbreaks">Inclusion Ireland concerned over care home outbreaks</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.rasset.ie/00142dab-1600.jpg" alt="img">
The organisation representing people with intellectual disabilities and their families will meet Minister for Health Simon Harris today, amid continuing concern about outbreaks of Covid-19 in long-term residential care homes.</p>
<p>Inclusion Ireland said it is concerned about a lack of reporting of the number of people with disabilities within institutions who have died from Covid-19.</p>
<p>The organisation said there are almost 3,000 people with intellectual disabilities living in institutional settings in Ireland.</p>
<p>Its chief executive, Enda Egan, said this was a very anxious and worrying time for them and their families.</p>
<p>The organisation wants assurances that the number of people with disabilities in institutions who die from Covid-19 will be reported and that families will be kept informed if there is an outbreak in a facility.</p>
<p>Speaking on RTÉ&rsquo;s Today with Sean O’Rourke, Mr Egan said he is aware that 82 long term residential care facilities have reported cases of Covid-19.</p>
<p>He that that number has trebled in a week and he would be concerned that these facilities are facing a situation similar to that of nursing homes.</p>
<p>Mr Egan said there is very little reporting in relation to the number of people with intellectual disabilities, living in long term care who have contracted and died from Covid-19. He said he wants these facilities to be treated in the same way as nursing homes.</p>
<p>Mr Egan said that PPE is beginning to flow &ldquo;a bit better&rdquo; into the facilities but that staff and residents are not being tested at the same time.</p>
<p>He also called for a standard communication policy to be sent from the HSE to service providers so they are able to communicate with families when there is an outbreak in a facility and let them know how it is being handled.</p>
<p>The minister said last night he wanted to see what could be done to support organisations representing those with disabilities.</p>
<p>Health Service Executive Chief Operations Officer Anne O&rsquo;Connor said the executive was providing supports to 285 nursing homes, 82 disability services and 33 mental health services.</p>
<p>She said staff and other supports had been deployed to deal with the very significant challenges.</p>
<p>Latest figures from the HSE show that there are just over 1,000 people in the country&rsquo;s 29 acute hospitals with confirmed or suspected cases of Covid-19.</p>
<p>Hospital admissions rose slightly, by 3%, between Saturday morning and yesterday morning after falling slightly the previous day.</p>
<p>The Mater Hospital has the highest number of confirmed cases, with 118. It is followed by St James&rsquo;s Hospital with 88 cases, Beaumont Hospital with 82 cases and Tallaght Hospital with 81 cases. Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown has 58 confirmed cases and St Vincent&rsquo;s University hospital has 54 cases.</p>
<p>Outside Dublin, Mayo has 34 confirmed cases, Limerick has 31 and Cork has 25.</p>
<p>St James’s Hospital in Dublin has the highest number of suspected cases at 29, followed by St Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital with 27 and Tallaght Hospital with 23 suspected cases.</p>
<p>There are 133 people in intensive care units with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 - 120 confirmed cases and 13 suspected. 72 of these patients are on ventilators.</p>
<p>As of yesterday evening, there were 153 available critical care beds.</p>
<p>The figures show the growth rate in new cases in Ireland has remained under 5% for seven of the past eight days. But it has not dropped significantly in that time. 1,078 news cases of Covid-19 were announced over the weekend.
