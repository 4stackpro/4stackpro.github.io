Controversial lawyer Miguna Miguna on Friday, April 3, came to the defence of Citizen TV news anchor Yvonne Okwara who was trolled on Twitter for the better part of the day.</p>
<p>Miguna, who is never shy of sharing his opinions, called out Kenyans who were attacking her, stating that Yvonne had a right to express her opinion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yvonne Okwara is entitled to her opinions, just like all of you are. Stop attacking Yvonne for expressing her opinions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Democracy, the rule of law and constitutionalism demand no less. Yvonne is one of the most thoughtful Kenyans alive,&rdquo; Miguna stated.</p>
<p>Citizen TV anchor Yvonne Okwara at the Lord Erroll-Gourmet Restaurant on February 16, 2020 Instagram</p>
<p>He warned netizens against curtailing the news anchor&rsquo;s opinions through intimidation, harassment, threats or unwarranted attacks on her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Present your own opinions robustly. Interrogate and deconstruct hers with reason and logic. We need to expand our democratic space and guard against tyranny,&rdquo; Miguna wrote on his Twitter page.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the vocal lawyer agreed with netizens that Yvonne went beyond the pale by calling for the arrest of social media users for expressing their opinions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finally, I agree that Yvonne went overboard by calling for the arrest of #KOT who had equally expressed their opinions as prescribed by the Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, we should critique that aspect of her anti-democratic opinion through reason; not vigilantism,&rdquo; he stated.</p>
<p>The news anchor ignited an outburst online following her rant on Citizen TV&rsquo;s News Gang show on Thursday night, April 2.</p>
<p>In the show, Yvonne agreed with Health CS Mutahi Kagwe that sleuths should arrest all social media users who mocked Covid-19 survivors Brenda Cherotich and Brian Orinda.</p>
<p>Okwara argued that the attacks were directed only at women, igniting a gender debate online.</p>
<p>It is her remarks that raffled a few feathers on social media, making her trend at number one the whole of Friday.</p>
<p>During a presser on Thursday, Health CS Mutahi Kagwe condemned the act in the strongest terms possible urging Kenyans to shun the behaviour he claimed was unpalatable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am deeply saddened that a section of Kenyans has taken to social media to make a mockery. Yesterday, I informed you about our two young people who have recovered from this deadly Coronavirus disease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, some have decided to trivialise our efforts and in so doing, trivialise two Kenyans. It is shocking that some have decided to make fun and brand our efforts as a PR Exercise,&rdquo; stated Kagwe.

<h3 id="from-the-greatest-news-anchor-to-a-husband-snatcher--kenyans-turn-the-heat-on-yvonne-okwara">From the Greatest News Anchor to a Husband Snatcher- Kenyans Turn the Heat on Yvonne Okwara</h3>
<p><img src="https://347139-1074023-raikfcquaxqncofqfm.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ydopknqzwdkfcri5bc4289ed0b9c.jpg" alt="img">
(KDRTV) – Citizen TV journalist Yvonne Okwara has just moved from hero to zero in a matter of hours following her remarks on the online trolls directed towards Brenda Cherotich, Kenya’s first patient of Coronavirus.</p>
<p>Brenda has been on the receiving end of social media trolls after her name was revealed following her recovery from the dreaded virus. Her friend Brian who also recovered from the virus joined her for a video call with President Uhuru Kenyatta on Wednesday. Brenda was also interviewed on NTV and Citizen TV.</p>

<p>However, most Kenyans led by influential bloggers and politicians poked holes into a story and concluded that she wasn’t sick but was just a Public Relations stunt.</p>
<p>The trolls didn’t stop there, as an unknown person leaked her alleged nude photos on social media.</p>
<p>Yvonne Okwara claimed that Brenda was targeted because she is a woman.</p>

<p>“It is absolutely shamefully how we behaved on social media. This is proportionately targeted at women. We are not hearing all these vile things being said at Brian. All these are being said at Brenda because she is a woman,” Yvonne said during Thursday’s #NewsGang session.</p>
<p>However, Kenyans have questioned why she would raise the gender topic when she didn’t speak after a woman exposed alleged nudes belonging to West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo.</p>
<p>I strongly disagree with Yvonne Okwara. Your statement is not objective. It is emotional and stinks to high heavens. Speaking of which where was your voice when your fellow women stripped a MAN (Lonyangapuo) naked and shared his nude photos? This is toxic</p>

<p>Cyberbullies also took advantage and dug into Yvonne’s past and exposed cobwebs.</p>
<p>Incase you didnt know: Yvonne Okwara Matole</p>
<p>The Citizen TV reporter is married to Andrew Matole.</p>
<p>Andrew was initially married to one Alice Manyola Matole sometime back and they have three children, Linda, Faith and Emmanuel. pic.twitter.com/hBhgZzMS53 — FireMoMMAH (@HalfKamba) April 3, 2020</p>
<p>We hope Yvonne is strong enough to overcome these trolls.

<h3 id="4-reasons-why-ruto-is-toxic---yvonne-okwara-video">4 Reasons Why Ruto is Toxic - Yvonne Okwara [VIDEO]</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.kenyans.co.ke/files/styles/article_style/public/images/media/Collage%20%282%29.jpg?itok=eJRSXr6l" alt="img">
Citizen TV anchor, Yvonne Okwara, weighed in on the state of the nation, wondering why politicians had deviated their attention to Deputy President William Ruto, rather than focusing on the global pandemic, Coronavirus.</p>
<p>On Thursday, March 12, as a panellist on News Gang, alongside Joe Ageyo, Linus Kaikai and Francis Gachuri, Okwara dubbed politicians to be Kenya&rsquo;s own pandemic.</p>
<p>She argued that she was in a dilemma on whether to speak for herself or for many Kenyans of similar minds.</p>
<p>Legislators at the Serena Hotel demanding for the resignation of Deputy President William Ruto on Wednesday, March 11, 2020 Facebook</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should this be my take or our collective take and submission to our fate as Kenyans? The World Health Organisation declared Coronavirus a global pandemic but our politicians, from top to bottom, carry on like they always have. It is exasperating. Our politicians are our own Kenyan pandemic. An ongoing deadly potential outbreak and this is nothing short of a curse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How else do we explain the mindless and senseless escalation of political activity completed with mass political press conferences on issues totally unrelated to the global crisis of a raging pandemic? When elected leaders flock into rival press conferences in numbers and manner that looks like the reenactment of the wildebeest migration in the Mara. Then for our country&rsquo;s sake, it has to be about 47 million Kenyans, but it was not. It was about one man, William Ruto,&rdquo; Okwara argued.</p>
<p>According to Okwara, Ruto had, in a space of a week, shifted from an alleged target of an assassination plot by the system to the subject of an impeachment motion by a section of elected leaders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They taunted each other and dared each other on the future of Ruto. None of them ever thought that the pressers wouldn&rsquo;t be possible if the Coronavirus landed in Kenya.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those two were not conferences, they were two regrettable sessions of mass political hysteria among elected leaders which blinds us from what really matters,&rdquo; Okwara added.</p>
<p>Ruto-allied lawmakers led by Meru Senator Mithika Linturi during a press briefing at Parliament Buildings on Wednesday, March 11, 2020 Twitter</p>
<p>The anchor argued that the virus could put to test Kenya&rsquo;s newly launched Universal Health Care program and have an impact on the economy, coupled up with the locust invasion which is a threat to the nation&rsquo;s food security.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Despite these issues, the political leaders consider Ruto a much greater subject as world leaders debate on how to protect their population from the disease. We are living in the most dangerous age since independence. Should we worry more about the Coronavirus or quality of our leaders?&rdquo; she posed.</p>
<p>Gachuri, on his part, advised the leaders to take a step back from politics and analyse the situation in the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them first self-quarantine, spare a day or two and think through their engagements, statements and desires and look at the promises they made to Kenyans. I then propose President Uhuru Kenyatta to converge all politicians and have Ruto address Odinga and Kenyatta square off with Ruto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am convinced that they are playing to the gallery and when they see cameras, reason somewhat escapes them. They need come up with resolves to issues affecting Kenyans,&rdquo; Gachuri stated.</p>
<p>Lawyer Ahmednassir Abdullahi had also called on leaders to focus on the global pandemic rather than debate on issues centred around political wars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every country in the world is preparing how to counter coronavirus. Every country in the world is spending all its resources on how to address this pandemic&hellip;except Kenya, where our leaders are spending all their time/ resources on senseless political supremacy wars,&rdquo; the attorney tweeted on Wednesday, March 11.</p>
