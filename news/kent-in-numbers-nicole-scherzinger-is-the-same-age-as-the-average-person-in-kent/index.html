<p>Ever wondered how many people live in Kent, what the average age is, or where the county&rsquo;s highest point is?</p>
<p>Well, you&rsquo;re in luck as here at KentOnline we&rsquo;ve been crunching the numbers to bring you top facts about the place we all live.</p>
<p>For instance, did you know the Garden of England is home to 2.73% of the UK population?</p>
<p>An estimated 1,568,600 people live within the Kent County Council area while 277,855 are in Medway – a combined total of 1,846,188.</p>
<p>The borough figures are broken down in this handy graph above.</p>
<p>Neighbouring Essex has 1,477,800 residents and Surrey 1,189,900 while East Sussex has just 554,590.</p>
<p>Do you know what the average county resident has in common with singing superstar Nicole Scherzinger?</p>
<p>Nicole Scherzinger is the same age as the average woman in Kent. Picture: Twitter</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right. They&rsquo;re41 years old, which is a year older than the national average.</p>
<p>The average Kent female is 42 compared to the national figure of 41, while the average male is 40 compared to 39.</p>
<p>The youngest population is in Dartford where the average age for females is 38.2 and males 37.1.</p>
<p>The oldest is in Folkestone &amp; Hythe where the average age for females is 45.1 and for males 43.1.</p>
<p>Across the county, there are slightly more females (50.9%) while children up to age 14 make up 18.2% of the population – that’s 286,700 kids.</p>
<p>Ben Nevis is the highest point in Britain. But where is the highest point in Kent?</p>
<p>Figures for last year show the average full-time weekly wage for workers was £615.90 – £29 more than nationally. Lucky us.</p>
<p>Kent&rsquo;s highest point is Betsom’s Hill, which is on the North Downs between Westerham and Tatsfield.</p>
<p>It is 251m (832ft) high, or 1,094m (an entire kilometre) below Britain&rsquo;s highest – Ben Nevis which is 1,345 metres (4,413ft).</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t find what Kent&rsquo;s lowest point was, but many think it was Gillingham FC&rsquo;s performance last season!</p>
<p>With the national census due next year, we looked to see how the county&rsquo;s population has changed over the past half century.</p>
<p>Some 11.6% of 16 to 64-year-olds (181,957) help make up the UK&rsquo;s 4.95 million self employed.</p>
<p>We all love a day at the seaside (when not locked down that is) with Kent boasting more than 350 miles of coastline. However, that&rsquo;s almost half that of Cornwall&rsquo;s 674 miles.</p>
<p>In Medway, there are 92 primary schools and 30 secondary schools, while in Kent 570 primary schools and 190 secondary.</p>
<p>Across the UK there are 20,832 state primary schools and 4,188 secondary schools.</p>
<p>In Kent, males born between 2016 and 2018 have a life expectancy of 79.9 years and females83.4 years.</p>
<p>White Cliffs of Dover coastline</p>
<p>Medway males&rsquo; life expectancy is 79 and women 82, compared to the average UK life expectancy of 81.16 years.</p>
<p>Figures for 2018 show there were 17,062 births in the county – the highest number (2,078) being in Maidstone.</p>
<p>From 2012 to 2017, the annual total number of births in Medway actually fell – from 3,693 to 3,601.</p>
<p>During the same period, the number of births from non-UK-born mothers increased from 660to 766.</p>
<p>In 2018, there were 731,213 births in the UK, an annual decrease of 3.2% and the lowest number since 2006.</p>
<p>The Shepherd Neame brewery in Faversham</p>
<p>As of 2018, the total GVA (value of goods and services produced) in Kent and Medway was estimated at £4.2bn.</p>
<p>The county has 26 English Heritage sites and one World Heritage – Canterbury Cathedral.</p>
<p>There are around 300 miles of riversand the total road network is around 5,900 miles.</p>
<p>Faversham-based Shepherd Neame brewery produces 50 million pints a year, which is handy as you&rsquo;ll probably need a beer after reading all this.</p>

<p>Nicole Scherzinger</p>
<p>As a part of their ongoing festival, The Other Songs, Alastair Adam Lloyd Webber chatted with AR Rahman, who had logged in from hishome. The two exchanged notes on Alastair’s composer-father Andrew, whom the Indian singer-composer had met 20 years ago through Shekhar Kapur. “You were a kid then,” laughed the Oscar winner.The conversation inevitably veered towards Slumdog Millionaire. Rahman reminisced that he was locked down at his London studio for three weeks, as MIA andrecorded in New York and Mumbai respectively, with his team in Chennai, calling it “intense post-production” that was quite similar to the current lockdown. He recalled how the film’s director,, had called him from the Toronto film festival, gushing about the response. “It’s also because’t use music like wallpaper. I’ve worked so hard for other films too but it got drowned&hellip; It was given stepmotherly treatment,” the composer rued.Before signing off, at the behest of Alastair, Rahman challenged, who had sung a version of “Jai Ho”, and Andrew Webber, to sing his original composition. We are keeping an eye out for that one!
