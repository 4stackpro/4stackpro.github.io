(CNN) President Donald Trump is set to unveil new guidelines on Thursday meant to help states loosen their social distancing restrictions even as business leaders, lawmakers and governors warn persistent testing shortfalls could hamper any effort to reopen the country.</p>
<p>But Trump, eager to see a return to normalcy for housebound Americans, wants to provide at least a framework for how places can reopen despite warnings from all corners that testing capacity for coronavirus is still too small.</p>
<p>He is planning to brief the governors of all 50 US states on the new guidelines during a 3 p.m. ET teleconference. Afterward, he&rsquo;ll unveil them publicly at a 6 p.m. ET news conference.</p>
<p>In his call with governors, Trump previewed the plan to re-open much of the American economy. But he insisted it would be up to the individual governors to make the decision in their own states when they begin that process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going to call your own shots,&rdquo; Trump said, according to a person familiar with the conversation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gotten to know almost all of you, most of you I&rsquo;ve known and some very well. You are all very capable people, I think in all cases, very capable people. And you&rsquo;re going to be calling your shots. We&rsquo;ll be standing right alongside of you and looking to get our country open and our people working and our people want to get working.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trump said that the decision to target May 1 as the day to begin the process of reopening the country came in consultation with Drs. Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx , medical leaders of the administration&rsquo;s coronavirus task force.</p>
<p>Trump described their sign-off on May 1 date as a &ldquo;negotiation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a little bit of a negotiation that that&rsquo;s the way it should be,&rdquo; Trump said. &ldquo;I guess, I hope it is that way usually, but we all do want to see things open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Previewing the new recommendations, Trump said Wednesday the nation had &ldquo;passed the peak on new cases&rdquo; and was ready for a new set of federal guidelines on how to reopen certain parts of the country. He acknowledged that some states would be able to open more quickly than others. He insisted his chief concern was the safety and health of Americans.</p>
<p>Still, he said there were risks inherent in keeping the country shut down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has to be a balance,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know, there&rsquo;s also death involved in keeping it closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Officials said the new recommendations would mimic the social distancing guidelines the President announced in March and extended at the start of April: While not mandatory, they carry the weight of the federal government and the presidency.</p>
<p>Trump, who began the week insisting he had the &ldquo;absolute authority&rdquo; to reopen the country, retreated after pushback from Republican and Democratic governors alike. He said each state would submit a plan to him for reopening, though even that is not required.</p>
<p>Many states have already begun drafting plans on returning to normal, including consortia of states on the East and West coasts that have agreed on joint phased reopenings.</p>
<p>Ahead of Trump&rsquo;s phone call with governors on Thursday, a new collective of Midwestern governors said they were joining together to coordinate on reopening plans. The leaders of Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky &ndash; both Democrats and Republicans &ndash; said they would &ldquo;work in close coordination to reopen our economies in a way that prioritizes our workers&rsquo; health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many of those governors &ndash; along with public health experts, lawmakers and business leaders &ndash; say that without widespread testing, Americans won&rsquo;t be able to return to workplaces quickly because it will remain unclear who could still be spreading the virus.</p>
<p>In phone calls with members of the US House and Senate on Thursday, Trump was told by some lawmakers that without increased testing, asymptomatic people may return to workplaces and unknowingly spread further contagion, according to people familiar with the call.</p>
<p>Trump countered by saying his administration had worked to scale up testing and he repeated his dubious claim that the United States had tested more people than any other country.</p>
<p>He also pointed to a new test that people could administer themselves that uses saliva, a person familiar with the conversation said.</p>
<p>It was a similar message to one he received a day earlier during a phone call with some members of his newly formed business advisory council. In that conversation, industry leaders reiterated what public health experts and governors have been telling Trump for weeks: that there would need to be guarantees of ramped-up coronavirus testing before people return to work, according to one person briefed on the discussions.</p>
<p>As they weigh new guidelines on reopening the country, White House officials have pored over data on testing availability and hospital capacity, hoping to more narrowly devise a strategy to improve testing capacity where it still lags.</p>
<p>Trump said Wednesday it was governors&rsquo; responsibility to improve testing in their state, shrugging off responsibility for enacting the type of nationwide testing system he was touting only last month.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want the states to administer these tests, for the most part,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We want them to do it, we&rsquo;re not going to be running a parking lot in Arkansas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said there were nine states with fewer than 1,000 cases each who may be the first to lift distancing restrictions. Trump said he believed there could be nearly 30 states in &ldquo;extremely good shape,&rdquo; and repeated his assertion that certain places may be able to reopen sooner than May 1.</p>
<p>But even among the nine states with the lowest case counts &ndash; Maine, Vermont, West Virginia, Nebraska, North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Alaska and Hawaii &ndash; not all governors have expressed an eagerness to quickly reopen. Some, such as North Dakota, still appear to be experiencing an increase in cases, meaning their peaks could be weeks away.</p>
<p>The current federal guidelines on social distancing are not expected to be renewed when they expire on April 30. Officials said the White House would work closely with states to ensure reopening efforts are done safely and only when local outbreaks are deemed contained.</p>
<p>In finalizing the new plans, administration officials discussed issuing guidance to states on how to best assess whether they are ready to move away from social distancing, including creating specific thresholds for a reduction in cases and hospital capacity that would trigger a change in status.</p>
<p>Officials have also weighed options on how to reopen workplaces, including scaling up monitoring and recommending temperature checks; increasing the availability of testing, including antibody tests when they become available; new guidelines on how to best socially distance in workplaces, on public transportation and in public spaces like restaurants; and increased availability of masks or other face coverings.</p>
<p>Another idea discussed was recommending people who have recovered from coronavirus or test positive during the antibodies test &ndash; meaning they had coronavirus and likely have some form of immunity &ndash; go back to work wearing masks.</p>
<p>Officials have also weighed recommendations for schools, child care centers and summer camps, recognizing that returning to work may be difficult for parents if their children don&rsquo;t also have a place to go.</p>
<p>Before Trump unveiled the new guidelines, he spent the day on phone calls with foreign leaders and lawmakers. In a teleconference with other G7 leaders, Trump faced resistance to his decision to halt US funding to the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>Trump has claimed the WHO is overly weighted toward China and made grave mistakes early in the coronavirus outbreak, a stance he reiterated on the morning videoconference. But other leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, sought to bolster the global health body as essential during the pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much of the conversation centered on the lack of transparency and chronic mismanagement of the pandemic by the WHO,&rdquo; the White House said in a readout of the conversation. &ldquo;The leaders called for a thorough review and reform process.&rdquo;

<h3 id="five-of-trumps-coronavirus-claims-fact-checked">Five of Trump&rsquo;s coronavirus claims fact-checked</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2020/4/14/962435dfde8e4d7bac45cdc42cc24d74_18.jpg" alt="img">
United States President Donald Trump has repeated bold claims throughout the coronavirus crisis, from quick travel bans to claims that he has &ldquo;total&rdquo; authority.</p>
<p>While many of these claims have been met with praise from his supporters, they have been scrutinised by others.</p>
<p>More:</p>
<p>While there is truth to some of his claims, many appear to have factual inaccuracies. Here&rsquo;s a look at five of Trump&rsquo;s most common coronavirus claims:</p>
<ol>
<li>&lsquo;China travel ban&rsquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>Trump has repeatedly boasted about his January 31 order to block travel from China, saying at a news briefing in March: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re the ones that gave the great response, and we&rsquo;re the ones that kept China out of here. &hellip; If I didn&rsquo;t do that early call on China - and nobody wanted that to happen. Everybody thought it was just unnecessary to do it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>While the order did block entry to the US from those who have been in China in the last 14 days, US citizens and certain qualified foreign nationals were exempted.</p>
<p>Nearly half a million people had travelled to the US from China since the coronavirus was announced to international health officials in January, The New York Times reported on April 4.</p>

<p>There were 1,300 direct flights between China and 17 US cities before Trump&rsquo;s order, and many who travelled received &ldquo;spotty screening&rdquo; upon arrival, according to the newspaper.</p>
<p>At least 40,000 people - mostly US nationals - had made the trip since the January 31 order, The New York Times said.</p>
<p>Trump has also claimed the US led the world in banning travel. However, other countries halted travel from China at roughly the same time.</p>
<p>This includes Afghanistan, which limited travel from China on January 31, the same day as Trump. Kazakhstan stopped issuances of visas to China on January 29 and ended regular air traffic to China on February 3.</p>
<p>North Korea appeared to close its borders to China on January 30, according to Reuters news agency.</p>
<p>While the administration insists the travel ban saved lives, studies have called into question the widespread efficacy of travel bans and affirmed testing and isolation as more effective measures.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>&lsquo;US is a leader in testing&rsquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>During daily news briefings, Trump has repeatedly praised US testing efforts, claiming the country is leading the world and that &ldquo;anyone who wants a test can get a test&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But testing for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, was initially slow and the tests were fraught with defects.</p>
<p>While German officials developed their own test, which was quickly adopted by World Health Organization officials in January, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) decided to develop its own, as it has done in previous outbreaks.</p>
<p>Initial guidelines limited tests to those who were exhibiting symptoms, partly due to limited testing capacity at the CDC laboratory.</p>
<p>During February, CDC data shows government labs processed 352 COVID-19 tests. This averages roughly a dozen per day.</p>
<p>Additionally, many of the tests were shipped with faulty reagents, a component used to cause a necessary chemical reaction within the test.</p>
<p>CDC Director Dr Robert Redfield said at a March 6 press briefing that authorities &ldquo;found that, in some of the states, it didn&rsquo;t work … We figured out why. I don&rsquo;t consider that a fault. I consider that doing quality control. I consider that success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Governors in several states this week said they are still not able to give a test to anyone who wants one, with many calling on the federal government to do more to aid their efforts.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>&lsquo;Total&rsquo; authority</li>
</ol>
<p>The Trump administration has long lauded the strength of the US economy under its guidance. The coronavirus crisis has upended that claim, with over 16 million US workers filing for unemployment in less than a month and retail purchases plummeting.</p>
<p>The administration is pushing for a reopening of states according to a national plan, but some governors are signalling their resistance.</p>
<p>Trump claims the authority of states pales when compared with that of the president. &ldquo;When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total&rdquo;, Trump said at a press briefing on Monday.</p>
<p>This is not accurate, according to the US Constitution, the document on which US laws and governance are based.</p>
<p>While the Executive Branch of the US government - the head of which is the president - has wide-ranging powers, they are not &ldquo;total&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The 10th Amendment of the constitution gives powers not afforded to the federal government to the states or the people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no light switch here, it&rsquo;s more like a dimmer,&rdquo; California Governor Gavin Newsom, who has unveiled his own plan to reopen the state, said.</p>
<p>Newsom&rsquo;s office has stated that California will reopen according to recommendations from science and health officials.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Hydroxychloroquine</li>
</ol>
<p>Trump has repeatedly stated that an anti-malarial drug, hydroxychloroquine, is a possible treatment for COVID-19 that could be a &ldquo;game-changer&rdquo;, seemingly based on anecdotal evidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you have to lose? Take it,&rdquo; Trump said at a press briefing on April 4.</p>
<p>There are currently no studies that prove the drug, which has been used to treat malaria for years, is effective in its treatment of COVID-19 symptoms.</p>
<p>A recent French study looked at 181 people admitted to the hospital for COVID-19. About half the people were given hydroxychloroquine, but there was no statistical difference in the death rate in either group, the study said.</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s own team has warned against placing too much faith in the drug. Dr Anthony Fauci, a leading government expert on infectious diseases, said &ldquo;No. The answer is no,&rdquo; when asked if there was evidence to suggest hydroxychloroquine treated or prevented COVID-19.</p>
<p>Fauci stressed that results from other tests are pending.</p>
<p>Trump has repeated that people should consult with their doctors before taking the drug.</p>
<p>Results from further studies are pending.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Obama administration response to H1N1</li>
</ol>
<p>Trump has contrasted his administration&rsquo;s response to the coronavirus with that of former President Barack Obama&rsquo;s efforts to contain the H1N1 virus, also called swine flu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people&rdquo;, Trump tweeted on March 12, criticising the presumptive Democratic nominee for president who will run against Trump in November.</p>
<p>Sleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings &amp; a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2020</p>
<p>Trump said the response was &ldquo;one of the worst on record&rdquo; and touted his &ldquo;78 percent&rdquo; approval rating for his administration&rsquo;s response.</p>
<p>The first swine flu case was detected in the US in April 2009, three months after Obama took office.</p>
<p>From April 2009 to April 2010, the virus killed an estimated 12,469 US citizens and infected over 60 million, according to CDC numbers.</p>

<p>From January 20 to April 15, the coronavirus has infected an estimated 610,000 people in the US, killing at least 26,000 people.</p>
<p>The Obama administration&rsquo;s acting director of health and human services declared the virus a public health emergency on April 26, 2009, before it was declared a global pandemic.</p>
<p>Also, polling at the time showed roughly 67 percent of the US was confident in the government&rsquo;s response to swine flu.</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s figure of 78 percent is thought to have referenced polling from February, before the US experienced any COVID-19 fatalities.</p>
<p>Biden did not play a prominent role in the Obama administration&rsquo;s response to the H1N1 outbreak, according to the fact-checking website PolitiFact, though his campaign&rsquo;s website does mention the Obama administration&rsquo;s response to the virus as proof he could do a better job than Trump.

<h3 id="trump-pushes-the-limits-of-presidential-powers-to-an-already-anxious-country">Trump pushes the limits of presidential powers to an already anxious country</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200416121936-02-trump-0415-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump&rsquo;s twin assertions this week of absolute power to reopen the country and unilateral authority to adjourn Congress are only the latest in a series of claims he has made challenging America&rsquo;s constitutional order.</p>
<p>But with thousands of people dying of Covid-19 every day, these go beyond the usual Trump distractions and could be more harmful. Instead of prompting what has become the usual response of &ldquo;can he really do that,&rdquo; his words could throw an already shaky America further off balance.</p>
<p>Trump often backs down or moves on. But he is the President. His words matter in the moment. Irrespective of how outlandish his Constitution-busting claims seem, he has tried to push his executive power to extremes.</p>
<p>Our constitutional order is the glue that holds the country together, especially in challenging times.</p>
<p>Trump continually flouts the fundamentals of the American framework: the balance between the states and US government, and separation of three federal branches, executive, legislative and judicial.</p>
<p>This week, he said he had &ldquo;total&rdquo; authority over states to determine when businesses, schools and other entities reopen across the country and, separately, threatened to invoke never-before-used or tested authority to shut down Congress so he could push through his appointees without a Senate vote.</p>
<p>In the past, Trump has claimed &ndash; against constitutional principles &ndash; that he could lift the right of citizenship for children born in the US of undocumented immigrants and suggested people crossing the border could be summarily deported without the hearings to determine if they deserved asylum or were wrongly apprehended.</p>
<p>He has scoffed at due process guarantees and equal protection of the law. Based on his personal predilections, he has declared people innocent or guilty and scorned US judges for rulings against his interests. He also has suggested he ultimately will prevail when his own appointees to the bench hear his cases.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, after he was acquitted by the Senate of impeachment charges related to his Ukrainian activities, Trump swiftly removed from office people who had testified at the House of Representatives&rsquo; impeachment inquiry. He also declared control of the Department of Justice: &ldquo;I am actually, I guess, the chief law enforcement officer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That assertion of absolute, even autocratic, power reverberated in his claim this week: &ldquo;When somebody&rsquo;s the President of the United States, the authority is total, and that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s got to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even if or when he retreats from such assertions, Trump inevitably sets a tone for other public officials and for individual citizens across the country who are today seeking leadership along with solace.</p>

<p>&lsquo;State of war is not a blank check&rsquo;</p>
<p>The US Supreme Court has restrained executive power even during national crises. In 1952, the court struck down President Harry Truman&rsquo;s attempt to seize steel mills without congressional approval to avert a strike during the Korean War. Justice Robert Jackson warned against policies of the moment that &ldquo;lose sight of enduring consequences upon the balanced power structure of our Republic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2004, when the justices rejected part of President George W. Bush&rsquo;s detention policy after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Justice Sandra Day O&rsquo;Connor cited the 1952 case and declared, &ldquo;a state of war is not a blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the Nation&rsquo;s citizens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This week&rsquo;s Trump incidents, like the previous episodes challenging norms, seemed spit out, lacking consultation with his legal experts.</p>
<p>When pressed on Monday about his claim of absolute authority to decide when states should restart local economies, Trump said his authority was grounded in &ldquo;numerous provisions&rdquo; of the Constitution. He cited none and wrongly declared of state and local officials, &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t do anything without the approval of the President of the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Governors pushed back based on the entrenched principle that the Constitution reserves numerous powers for the states, including authority for public health and safety. From its earliest beginning, the Supreme Court has endorsed state sovereignty, and the justices&rsquo; touchstone for state power to quarantine people and mandate vaccination during the outbreak of disease dates to 1905</p>
<p>In the current coronavirus crisis, in fact, the nation&rsquo;s governors and mayors have been the ones imposing &ldquo;shelter in place&rdquo; restrictions for individuals and shuttering businesses and schools. The President has also said states are responsible for acquiring equipment and helping their citizens and hospitals, calling the federal government a &ldquo;backup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A day after his claim of authority, Trump acknowledged that state governors would decide when to lift their stay-at-home orders. &ldquo;The governors are going to be running their individual states,&rdquo; Trump said, with no real explanation for his prior stance.</p>
<p>Then on Wednesday, he threatened to use untested constitutional authority to adjourn Congress so that he could win &ldquo;recess&rdquo; confirmations of pending nominees. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said that senators would not be returning to Washington for votes until at least May 4 because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Senate should either fulfill its duty and vote on my nominees or it should formally adjourn so that I can make recess appointments,&rdquo; Trump said, complaining about the current pending nominations for Director of National Intelligence, Treasury assistant secretary and the head of the Voice of America.</p>
<p>The Constitution states that the President &ldquo;may, on extraordinary occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in case of disagreement between them with respect to the time of adjournment, he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the meaning of such &ldquo;disagreement&rdquo; over adjournment is unclear. Normally, both the House and Senate would need to vote on resolutions to adjourn. After Trump&rsquo;s assertion, McConnell&rsquo;s office released a statement that said in part, &ldquo;The Leader pledged to find ways to confirm nominees considered mission-critical to the COVID-19 pandemic, but under Senate rules that will take consent from (Senate Minority Leader Chuck) Schumer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In observing that adjournment would require agreement from Schumer, McConnell implicitly rejected any plan that would give the President unilateral power to close the chambers. The Senate has routinely used &ldquo;pro-forma&rdquo; sessions over the last decade to prevent controversial recess appointments under Presidents Bush and Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Trump lacks awareness, or at least regard, for history and norms. Bluster has become a tool. In that vein, Trump&rsquo;s critics often brush off his remarks as mere distractions.</p>
<p>Sen. Kamala Harris, a California Democrat, told CNN&rsquo;s Anderson Cooper Wednesday night that in threatening to shut down Congress, Trump was trying &ldquo;to deflect from the fact that he has failed to be a leader during a pandemic, an economic crisis facing our country.&rdquo;
