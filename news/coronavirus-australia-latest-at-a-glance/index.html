Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. These are the main stories on Sunday 5 April.</p>
<p>NSW police launch criminal investigation into Ruby Princess fiasco</p>
<p>The NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, confirmed on Sunday that there will be a criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess debacle that will look at the actions of every agency involved as well as the cruise ship operator.</p>
<p>“There is clear evidence that [Covid-19] has been brought off that ship,” Fuller says. There’s clear evidence now when it stopped in New Zealand Covid-19 has come off that ship and at least 10 people have died in Australia from Covid-19. The only way I can get to the bottom of whether our national biosecurity laws and our state laws were broken is through a criminal investigation.”</p>
<p>Three of the four latest deaths in NSW were passengers on the Ruby Princess.</p>
<p>Health officials ‘hopeful’ curve is flattening</p>
<p>Health authorities in Australia have expressed cautious optimism that Australia may be able to limit the domestic coronavirus outbreak but have warned against complacency or relaxing social distancing rules too early.</p>
<p>Australia’s chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, said the number of cases in Australia rose by 139 on Sunday, to a total of 5,687 cases. About 2,000 of those cases are of people who have completely recovered. Australia’s death toll now stands at 34.</p>
<p>“That is probably the lowest rise we’ve had for a few days and it does tend to continue the trend we’ve seen of flattening of the curve,” Murphy said.</p>
<p>More casuals could receive jobkeeper payment</p>
<p>The government has opened the door to allowing more of the casual workforce to access wage subsidies, as it vowed to press ahead with legislating the $130bn jobkeeper scheme this week.</p>
<p>Christian Porter, the attorney general, said the government was aiming to be “as inclusive and reasonable as possible” on the issue of casuals and he hoped to have draft legislation ready on Monday. Parliament is due to return on Wednesday – with limited numbers of MPs attending – to consider legislation to enable as many as 6m workers to access wage subsidies of $1,500 per fortnight. The secretary of the ACTU, Sally McManus, said the union movement had been raising concerns publicly and privately with the government.</p>
<p>More casual workers may be included in $130bn jobkeeper coronavirus scheme Read more</p>
<p>Western Australia border to close at midnight</p>
<p>The WA premier, Mark McGowan, has told people outside the state to “come home by midnight tonight” before strict new entry rules come into effect.</p>
<p>“No one from over east will be allowed entry into Western Australia unless you’re an approved exempt traveller … People can go to the government website to get the latest information and download the necessary forms. Checks will be occurring. If you’ve lied on an exemption form to get into our state, there’s every chance you’ll get caught and be forced to face the consequences.”</p>
<p>Free hotel rooms for Victorian frontline workers</p>
<p>Victoria’s frontline health workers will have free hotel stays if they need to self-isolate during the coronavirus crisis, as the state recorded 20 new cases overnight.</p>
<p>The state government will provide $20m to buy hotel rooms, enabling up to 8,000 frontline workers who may test positive for Covid-19 or have unexpected and unprotected contact with a suspected patient, to self-isolate, away from family and flatmates, at no cost. The service will be available to healthcare professionals and other workers such as cooks and cleaners who directly engage with patients.</p>
<p>People warned against travelling over Easter holidays</p>
<p>Authorities in several states have warned people against travelling over the coming Easter holiday period, urging them to adhere to social distancing rules. The NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, was asked if police will be doing random checks on IDs to see that people have not gone on holidays and responded, “we will be stopping people and if you don’t have a good reason to be where you are, you could face a $1,000 fine.” Tasmania will toughen restrictions to stop people heading to their holiday homes or taking boating trips over the Easter break, the state’s premier said on Sunday. Peter Gutwein said many elderly people lived in these areas, and they needed to be protected, as the state’s confirmed cases rose to 82.</p>
<p>Police issue scores of fines at Queensland car rally</p>
<p>Police issued 58 infringement notices at a car rally in the Brisbane suburb of Rochedale last night where people were flouting social distancing directives. Deputy Queensland police commissioner Steve Gollschewski, who is also the state disaster coordinator, has professed himself disappointed and frustrated and said the behaviour of people at the rally was “inexcusable”.</p>
<p>“This is all about safety. About saving lives. About stopping the spread of Covid-19,” he said. “It is inexcusable what happened at Rochedale last night and such blatant disregard for the lives of Queenslanders will not be tolerated.”</p>
<p>A man was also charged in Tasmania for allegedly disobeying isolation requirements after returning to the state from Victoria, police said. The man had been staying at a government facility for his period of isolation but had breached conditions, police say.</p>

<h3 id="health-officials-hopeful-australia-is-flattening-coronavirus-curve-but-warn-against-complacency">Health officials &lsquo;hopeful&rsquo; Australia is flattening coronavirus curve but warn against complacency</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/131694f88a7b8621e7ccc63a592be258e132cf35/0_2_3000_1800/master/3000..jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=bcb2417fbb5944e6bd06515ca0ba753d" alt="img">
Australia’s Covid-19 death toll rose to 34 on Sunday as the rate of new infections appear to ‘stabilise’</p>
<p>Health authorities in Australia have expressed cautious optimism that Australia may be able to limit the domestic coronavirus outbreak, as the death toll reaches 34 including three more deaths linked to the Ruby Princess cruise ship.</p>
<p>However, senior officials have warned against complacency or relaxing social distancing rules too early.</p>
<p>Australia’s chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy said the number of cases in Australia rose by 139 on Sunday, to a total of 5,687 cases. About 2,000 of those cases are of people who have completely recovered.</p>
<p>“That is probably the lowest rise we’ve had for a few days and it does tend to continue the trend we’ve seen of flattening of the curve,” Murphy said.</p>
<p>He added: “We’re increasingly confident that if people continue to adhere to what we’ve been asking them to do we can prevent a situation like we’ve seen in many other country of the world.”</p>
<p>However Murphy said he remained concerned about community transmission, which accounted for 10% of cases in Australia.</p>
<p>The deputy chief medical officer, Nick Coatsworth, meanwhile said Australia appeared to be on the right path.</p>
<p>“If we do stop these measures too early, then we have seen graphs in the media showing there could be a resurgence in cases so we have to be careful on those grounds,” Coatsworth told Sky News on Sunday.</p>

<p>Dr Jeremy McAnulty, NSW Health’s director of health protection, said the rate of daily infections in that state was “stabilising” but it was too early to say if this trend would continue.</p>
<p>“It is pleasing to see early signs of stabilisation, which is down to a number of important factors,” McAnulty said.</p>
<p>He attributed that stabilisation to an early detection of cases, allowing for early contact tracing and isolation of all known contacts, as well as adherence to social distancing measures.</p>
<p>“We want to be hopeful, but not to over-egg the figures,” he said. “The last few days we have seen numbers bounce around without escalating at the same level as we have seen before, so we are hopeful that we are starting to flatten the curve. But there is more work to be done and it is important that we all heed those messages.”</p>
<p>New South Wales reported 87 new cases on Sunday, bringing the total number of cases in that state to 2,580. Some 39 people with Covid-19 are in intensive care in that state, 23 of whom require ventilators.</p>
<p>NSW has the highest rates of untraced community transmission in the country, with 380 cases recorded as having been acquired locally with no known source of infection and 58 more under investigation. About 118,863 people have tested negative to the virus .</p>
<p>The federal government has said it will release modelling on the coronavirus outlook in Australia on Tuesday, after it is approved by the national cabinet.</p>
<p>Modelling by the University of Sydney showed that the number of active cases in Australia, assuming continued adherence to the current social distancing laws, could peak mid-April and the spread could be controlled by July. That modelling suggested the total number of people who would contract Covid-19 in Australia over the course of the pandemic was between 8,000 and 10,000. The current number is 5,635.</p>
<p>Victoria’s chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, said he for the first time had “a little bit of optimism that we can actually beat this”.</p>
<p>“That we can take a different course than most of Europe and North America has taken,” Sutton said. “That we can avoid literally the millions of cases that will occur in North America and Europe and the tens of thousands of deaths that, unfortunately, will occur in those continents … It means staying the course in Australia, and the things that we’ve asked people to do can make a difference, and this is the very early sign of it.”</p>
<p>Victoria recorded 20 new cases of Covid-19 overnight, bringing the total to 1,135 of which 75 were acquired through untraced community transmission.</p>
<p>Sutton said the new cases recorded on Sunday were “likely to be a mix” of returned travellers and known contacts, and community acquired cases.</p>
<p>NSW health minister defends experts who handled Ruby Princess coronavirus outbreak Read more</p>
<p>“We’ll see a greater proportion of community transmission as our international travel proportion goes down, because those individuals are smaller and smaller in number as every day goes by,” he said. “And their secondary contacts are fewer and fewer because we’ve got people in hotel quarantine, therefore protecting others around them.”</p>
<p>Queensland recorded just nine new cases overnight – its smallest one day rise in weeks.</p>
<p>“We’ve got a long way to go, but these signs are very encouraging to have only nine positive cases overnight,” Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said.</p>
<p>Palaszczuk said that more than 92% of the 907 cases confirmed to date in Queensland were either acquired overseas, or were caught from a person who had acquired the disease overseas.</p>
<p>The Northern Territory has no confirmed cases of community transmission. It recorded 27 new cases overnight, including a child who was a close contact of a person who had travelled overseas.
