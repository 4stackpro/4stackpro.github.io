<h3 id="we-wont-be-stopped-by-anyone-says-bushiri-as-he-explains-what-the-money-is-for">‚ÄòWe won‚Äôt be stopped by anyone,‚Äô says Bushiri as he explains what the money is for</h3>
<p><img src="https://citizen.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/gr-st-CRL-rights935-320x213.jpg" alt="img">
Enlightened Christian Gathering Church leader Shepherd Bushiri has hit back at people who ‚Äúattacked‚Äù his church‚Äôs ‚Äúwork‚Äù.</p>
<p>The self-proclaimed prophet was criticised by those who questioned why any leader would ask for money during the national lockdown.</p>
<p>But Bushiri said his church‚Äôs ministry did not only support South African projects.</p>
<p>He said: ‚ÄúOur ministry is not in South Africa alone, it‚Äôs not a South African ministry, it is an international ministry. There are other countries that are not on lockdown, even in South Africa, there are other people who would like to work with the church in the campaign which we‚Äôre doing.‚Äù</p>
<p>He said his attackers would not stop him or his church from supporting charities and helping communities amid the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs a church, we have so many projects including the support to combat the problems people are facing on this coronavirus. It‚Äôs our obligation as a church to take part to help the community and people who are suffering and to help the campaign. Also to do some charity over this pandemic that we‚Äôre having right now.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because of this as a church we‚Äôre calling for all people who have got offering to support the combat which we‚Äôre doing as a church to send your offering and seed into the account we‚Äôre putting on the screen.‚Äù</p>
<p>He further explained that the account he was giving people belonged to the church, not him, urging followers to not listen to the critics and continue giving towards the ministry.</p>
<p>‚ÄúYesterday we had people who would like to support the projects which we have as a church. I saw some people attacking our work, that‚Äôs how people are and that won‚Äôt stop us from doing what we‚Äôre doing. We‚Äôre calling for all well-wishers across the globe to contribute now.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is not a personal account, this is a church account you‚Äôre giving to. If you have your offering, seed or tithe send right now, we will not be stopped by anyone. Don‚Äôt give up in supporting what we‚Äôre doing.‚Äù</p>
<p>Bushiri trended on social media most of Monday following a video in which he urged his followers not to listen to the devil or their minds and give money to the church.</p>

Banking details of the church are seen appearing on the video, as Bushiri implores his followers to give their offerings.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI want you to put your offering in the church account. Put your seed, put your tithe, don&rsquo;t hesitate. Don&rsquo;t listen to the devil. Don&rsquo;t listen to what people say. Don&rsquo;t listen to what your man says. Listen to what God says &hellip;‚Äù</p>
<p>Twitter users were mainly shocked by Bushiri telling his followers, particularly females, to not listen to what their men say and pay their offerings and tithes.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDid he say don&rsquo;t listen to what your man is saying?,&rdquo; asked @Queen_Pardo.</p>
<p>@vittomohlanka tweeted, ‚ÄúA whole prophet says you shouldn&rsquo;t listen to your husband, yet the husband is the head of the house according to the Bible &hellip; this one doesn&rsquo;t have compassion. We&rsquo;re in a middle of a crisis, economy-wise but he&rsquo;s still milking people.‚Äù</p>
<p>@Madumetja_SoLo said, ‚ÄúBushiri is playing a dangerous game with people&rsquo;s wives now.‚Äù</p>
<p>@Lostris_KT.JNR_3000 said: ‚Äú It would&rsquo;ve have been nice if he donated money not this thing of sucking people&rsquo;s lives who are about to lose their jobs in a few weeks‚Äù.
