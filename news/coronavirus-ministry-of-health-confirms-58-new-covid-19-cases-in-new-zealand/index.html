There are 48 new confirmed cases and 10 new probable cases of COVID-19 in New Zealand.</p>
<p>The latest figures were announced by the Ministry of Health&rsquo;s Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield during a press conference on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The 58 new confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 brings New Zealand&rsquo;s case total to 647. As of Tuesday, 74 people have recovered from the virus and 12 are hospitalised, with two patients in the ICU in stable conditions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no sense that this is a drop [in cases] overall - the number of cases may reflect lower numbers in [testing] on Sunday in particular,&rdquo; Dr Bloomfield said. He believes the reduced number of tests is due to less people going to community-based assessment centres for swabbing and the limited availability of couriers on Sunday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[Mathematical] modelling shows that without the actions currently being taken, the uncontrolled spread of COVID-19 would exact a high price in New Zealand in terms of its impact on our health services, including our intensive care units, and deaths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are congregating in groups in outdoor places&hellip; please don&rsquo;t. If you&rsquo;re outdoors, practice physical distancing and don&rsquo;t gather where others are,&rdquo; Director of Civil Defence Emergency Management Sarah Stuart-Black warned. She has encouraged people to keep their children away from parks, playgrounds and outdoor surfaces such as benches.</p>
<p>Stuart-Black also reiterated that New Zealanders need to stop flushing wet wipes down the toilet as it can damage the sewers.</p>
<p>She urged New Zealanders to continue showing compassion and kindess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one catches this virus on purpose&hellip; let&rsquo;s all unite together to fight COVID-19.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Death toll remains at one</p>
<p>New Zealand&rsquo;s first virus-related death was announced on Sunday. Greymouth woman Anne Guenole, aged in her 70s, returned a positive test for COVID-19 after initially being diagnosed with influenza, complicated by an underlying health condition.

<h3 id="coronavirus-ministry-of-health-confirms-76-new-covid-19-cases-in-new-zealand">Coronavirus: Ministry of Health confirms 76 new COVID-19 cases in New Zealand</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2020/03/coronavirus-ministry-of-health-confirms-76-new-covid-19-cases-in-new-zealand/_jcr_content/par/video/image.dynimg.1280.q75.jpg/v1585549669905/getty-coronavirus-bloomfield-1120.jpg" alt="img">
New Zealand has 76 new cases of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), bringing the total of confirmed and probable cases to 589.</p>
<p>The latest figures were announced by the Ministry of Health&rsquo;s Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield during a press conference on Monday.</p>
<p>One formerly probable case is now among the 76 new confirmed cases. There are no other probable cases as of Monday, with the total of probable cases standing at 37.</p>
<p>As of Monday, 63 people have recovered from the virus in New Zealand. Twelve people are currently hospitalised with three expected to be discharged soon. Two of the hospitalised patients are in the ICU.</p>
<p>The average daily test number is sitting at 1728.</p>
<p>There have been no additional deaths related to the virus since Sunday.</p>
<p>Of the 455 cases where the ministry has sufficient information, 57 percent have a direct link to overseas travel, 26 percent are close contacts of existing cases, 15 percent have both overseas travel and/or close contacts as factors and 2 percent - roughly 10 cases - are due to community transmission.</p>
<p>Dr Bloomfield said the flu vaccine is now imperative to the overall COVID-19 response. People over 65, pregnant women, children with respiratory illnesses and frontline health staff are the priority.</p>
<p>Police Commissioner Mike Bush acknowledged the vast majority of New Zealanders are complying &ldquo;brilliantly&rdquo; with the Alert Level 4 lockdown measures.</p>
<p>He confirmed three people have been arrested for &ldquo;persistent breaches&rdquo; of lockdown protocol. Two have been released without charge while one remains in custody.</p>
<p>There has been a &ldquo;very slight reduction&rdquo; in family violence and family harm reports nationwide over the last few days, Bush said, noting a &ldquo;massive decline&rdquo; in public displays of violence as expected. Police are now putting their efforts into ensuring lockdown compliance.</p>
<p>Two police officers have tested positive for COVID-19 and remain at home. Neither require hospitalisation.</p>
<p>Bush reiterated the importance of social distancing during lockdown. New Zealanders are permitted to take exercise in their local area but must maintain a two-metre distance with others.</p>
<p>Death toll remains at one</p>
<p>On Sunday, New Zealand&rsquo;s first coronavirus-related death was announced. The deceased was Anne Guenole, a West Coast woman in her 70s. Guenole died at Grey Base Hospital in Greymouth on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>It was revealed that Guenole, who had an underlying health condition, was initially thought to be suffering from influenza when she was hospitalised on Wednesday. It wasn&rsquo;t until Thursday night that Guenole met the criteria of a COVID-19 case.</p>
<p>Twenty-one West Coast District Health Board (WCDHB) staff are self-isolating as a precautionary measure. Medical staff who assessed Guenole were wearing the suitable PPE (personal protective equipment) for treating an influenza patient, but were not wearing the eye protection required for a possible or confirmed COVID-19 case.

<h3 id="covid-19-coronavirus-uncontrolled-spread-could-kill-14000-in-nz">Covid 19 coronavirus: Uncontrolled spread could kill 14,000 in NZ</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/IY3OoohuLJYHogDe902t8tI_-l8=/1200x0/smart/filters:quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-syd-prod-nzme.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ADCBEBLP7FBHTBAIJXLC27CXUI.jpg" alt="img">
Fourteen thousand people could die if Covid-19 spreads out of control in New Zealand – and potentially as many as 27,600 in another modelled scenario.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s according to a tranche of new modelling just released by the Government.</p>
<p>A team of Otago University researchers, who provided the modelling to the Ministry of Health, found that uncontrolled spread in the country could see up to 64 per cent of the population infected, 32,000 people hospitalised, and up to 14,400 deaths.</p>
<p>Assuming New Zealand&rsquo;s strategy of elimination failed, the modelling considered the most plausible scenarios that could play out.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>It depended on how easily the virus could spread from one person to another, and assumed that general contact between much of the population would be reduced for between six and nine months.</p>
<p>The race is on to find a vaccine for COVID-19.</p>
<p>These scenarios involved between 44 per cent and 64 per cent of the population becoming sick; between 22,000 and 32,000 needing to be hospitalised; 5540 to 8000 people needing critical care; 2770 to 4000 requiring ventilators; and 8560 to 14,400 dying.</p>
<p>On the worst day for the worst scenario, there would be 11,200 people needing to be hospitalised and 2800 needing to be admitted to critical care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For this scenario, ICU capacity would be full on day 92, at a very early point in the epidemic curve,&rdquo; the report found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such demands are unprecedented in New Zealand&rsquo;s history and unless there was a major reconfiguration of services, would be overwhelming, with a risk of this pushing up the case fatality rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mortality burden would almost certainly be much higher in older age-groups - potentially 89 per cent of the deaths were estimated to be in the 60-plus age-group - and also would probably be patterned by ethnicity, with higher rates for Māori and Pacific peoples, and for people living in deprived areas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If New Zealand fails with its current eradication strategy toward Covid-19, then health outcomes for New Zealand could be very severe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If interventions were intense enough, however, in some scenarios the epidemic peak could still be suppressed or pushed out to the following year [at which time a vaccine may be available].&rdquo;</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Another set of modelling by the same team, which had a higher level of uncertainty, painted a more dire picture.</p>
<p>That looked at a worst-case scenario where eradication had failed and the epidemic peaked in early July 2020.</p>
<p>A total of 3.32 million New Zealanders would be expected to get symptomatic illness; 146,000 would be sick enough to require hospital admission; 36,600 would be sick enough to require critical care (in an ICU); and 27,600 would be expected to die.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This death toll would far exceed the death toll for NZ from World War I (18,000 deaths) and from the 1918 influenza pandemic (9000 deaths),&rdquo; that report said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not considered here also are all the deaths from people who don&rsquo;t receive normal care (eg, for heart attacks) due to re-orientation of the health system to deal with Covid-19.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The researchers said this plausible worst-case analysis still assumed a functioning ICU capacity that saves 25 per cent of those who need ICU care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may still be optimistic as in severe overload situations there may be rate limiting steps such as the supply of ventilators,&rdquo; the researchers said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other worse case scenarios hospital staff could go on strike if shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) developed – further disrupting care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ministry of Health director-general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said the modelling showed that, without the actions currently being taken, the uncontrolled spread of Covid-19 &ldquo;would exact a high price in New Zealand in terms of its impact on our health services, including our intensive care units, and deaths&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The modelling was continually updated as more real world evidence could be incorporated and the impact of different interventions could be considered,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is consistent across all the models is that we had a stark choice – let the virus spread unchecked and see large numbers of New Zealanders get sick, our health system overrun and many people dying, or taking firm measures to save lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of the scenarios show an unacceptable level of deaths in New Zealand without strong action. We can see these scenarios playing out overseas already.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even with the sorts of strong measures we have in place to stamp out the virus the modelling is still predicting there could be a heavy toll on our health system and loss of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That shows how seriously we need to take the virus, stick to the rules of the lockdown and maintain measures that reduce the risk of the virus entering the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The modelling was considered alongside a range of other information to inform the Ministry of Health&rsquo;s advice to the Government on its response to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>One of the researchers behind the modelling, Otago University public health professor Nick Wilson wanted the ministry to start separating out cases of community transmission from those related to returned overseas travellers, to give a clearer picture of Covid-19 in the community.</p>
<p>• Covid19.govt.nz: The Government&rsquo;s official Covid-19 advisory website</p>
<p>He also wanted New Zealand to ramp up its level of testing and contact tracing, saying that testing should be carried out on anyone turning up at an emergency department with respiratory issues, as well as randomly in the community.</p>
<p>But he said, for now, New Zealand was well placed to stamp out Covid-19 through a strategy of elimination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are in a situation where we really have adopted the best strategy &hellip; very few countries have been able to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>‌</p>
<p>Wilson was also involved in other modelling that suggested how countries that didn&rsquo;t have that advantage could try to suppress Covid-19 through sustained lockdowns so that peaks in cases didn&rsquo;t arrive until next year, when a vaccine might become available.</p>
<p>Professor Shaun Hendy explains why it may take a year to create a Covid-19 vaccine that is safe and of which there is enough for all. Audio / Newstalk ZB</p>
<p>Another set of modelling, by researchers from Te Punaha Matatini, showed that - failing eradication - lockdown measures like those in place now could delay a peak for up to 400 days, but wouldn&rsquo;t prevent it.</p>
<p>Any relaxing of those measures could result in hospitals being overwhelmed with a surge six times that of hospital capacity within a few months.</p>
<p>That capacity would be exceeded at the point that 40,000 people contracted the virus.</p>
<p>Left to spread without any controls, the virus could infect 89 per cent of the population and kill up to 80,000.</p>
<p>The best-case scenario if elimination failed – which still involved keeping New Zealand effectively shut down – death numbers would drop to just about 20 people, and hospital capacity would remain within limits for more than a year.</p>
