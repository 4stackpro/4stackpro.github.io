<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson has spent the night in intensive care at a central London hospital after his coronavirus symptoms worsened.</p>
<p>Downing Street said he was moved to the unit on the advice of his medical team and was receiving &ldquo;excellent care&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to deputise &ldquo;where necessary&rdquo;, a spokesman added.</p>
<p>The prime minister, 55, was admitted to St Thomas&rsquo; Hospital with &ldquo;persistent symptoms&rdquo; on Sunday evening.</p>
<p>The Queen has been kept informed about Mr Johnson&rsquo;s health by No 10, according to Buckingham Palace.</p>
<p>World leaders - including US President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron - have expressed their support for Mr Johnson.</p>
<p>BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said the prime minister was given oxygen late on Monday afternoon, before being taken to intensive care.</p>
<p>He was moved as a precaution so he could be close to a ventilator - which takes over the body&rsquo;s breathing process, our correspondent said.</p>
<p>A No 10 statement read: &ldquo;The prime minister has been under the care of doctors at St Thomas&rsquo; Hospital, in London, after being admitted with persistent symptoms of coronavirus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the course of [Monday] afternoon, the condition of the prime minister has worsened and, on the advice of his medical team, he has been moved to the intensive care unit at the hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It continued: &ldquo;The PM is receiving excellent care, and thanks all NHS staff for their hard work and dedication.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Raab - who will later chair the government&rsquo;s daily Covid-19 meeting - said there was an &ldquo;incredibly strong team spirit&rdquo; behind the prime minister.</p>
<p>He added that he and his colleagues were making sure they implemented plans Mr Johnson had instructed them to deliver &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way we&rsquo;ll bring the whole country through the coronavirus challenge,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson was initially taken to hospital for routine tests after testing positive for coronavirus 10 days ago. His symptoms included a high temperature and a cough.</p>
<p>Earlier on Monday, he tweeted that he was in &ldquo;good spirits&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Skip Twitter post by @BorisJohnson Last night, on the advice of my doctor, I went into hospital for some routine tests as I’m still experiencing coronavirus symptoms. I’m in good spirits and keeping in touch with my team, as we work together to fight this virus and keep everyone safe. — Boris Johnson #StayHomeSaveLives (@BorisJohnson) April 6, 2020 Report</p>
<p>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described it as &ldquo;terribly sad news&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the country&rsquo;s thoughts are with the prime minister and his family during this incredibly difficult time,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr Trump said Americans &ldquo;are all praying for his recovery&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He described Mr Johnson as &ldquo;a very good friend of mine and a friend to our nation&rdquo; who is &ldquo;strong&rdquo; and &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t give up&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Mr Macron said he sent &ldquo;all my support to Boris Johnson, to his family and to the British people at this difficult moment&rdquo;.</p>
<p>After very, very little information was shared today, the prime minister was taken into intensive care at around 19:00 BST.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been told he is still conscious, but his condition has worsened over the course of the afternoon.</p>
<p>And he has been moved to intensive care as a precaution in case he needs ventilation to get through this illness.</p>
<p>The statement from Downing Street makes clear he is receiving excellent care and he wants to thank all of the NHS staff.</p>
<p>But something important has changed, and he has felt it necessary to ask his foreign secretary to deputise for him where needs be.</p>
<p>That is a completely different message from what we have heard over the past 18 hours or so, where it was continually &ldquo;the prime minister is in touch&rdquo; and &ldquo;he is in charge&rdquo; - almost like everything is business as usual.</p>
<p>But clearly being in intensive care changes everything.</p>
<p>Read more from Laura</p>
<p>Last month, the prime minister&rsquo;s spokesman said if Mr Johnson was unwell and unable to work, Mr Raab, as the first secretary of state, would stand in..</p>
<p>It comes as the number of coronavirus hospital deaths in the UK reached 5,373 - an increase of 439 in a day.</p>
<p>The Department of Health and Social Care said there were now 51,608 confirmed coronavirus cases.</p>
<p>Intensive care is where doctors look after the sickest patients - his admission to ICU is the clearest indication of how ill the prime minister is.</p>
<p>We do not know the full details of Mr Johnson&rsquo;s condition, but he is conscious and not being ventilated.</p>
<p>Not every patient in intensive care is ventilated, but around two-thirds are within 24 hours of admission with Covid-19.</p>
<p>This is a disease that attacks the lungs and can cause pneumonia and difficulty breathing.</p>
<p>This leaves the body struggling to get enough oxygen into the blood and to the body&rsquo;s vital organs.</p>
<p>There is no proven drug treatment for Covid-19, although there are many experimental candidates.</p>
<p>But the cornerstone of the prime minister&rsquo;s care will depend on getting enough oxygen into his body and supporting his other organs while his immune system fights the virus.</p>
<p>Chancellor Rishi Sunak said his thoughts were with the prime minister and his pregnant partner, Carrie Symonds, and that Mr Johnson would &ldquo;come out of this even stronger&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Ms Symonds said she had spent a week in bed with the main symptoms. She said she had not been tested for the virus.</p>
<p>Scotland&rsquo;s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was &ldquo;sending [Mr Johnson] every good wish&rdquo;, while Northern Ireland&rsquo;s First Minister Arlene Foster added she was &ldquo;praying for a full and speedy recovery&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Wales&rsquo; First Minister Mark Drakeford called it &ldquo;concerning news&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson&rsquo;s predecessor, Theresa May, and former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn both said their thoughts were with him.</p>
<p>Mrs May noted that the &ldquo;horrific virus does not discriminate&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Taoiseach - Irish Prime Minister - Leo Varadkar wished Mr Johnson &ldquo;a rapid return to health&rdquo;, and French President Emmanuel Macron said he hoped he &ldquo;overcomes this ordeal quickly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also wished him a &ldquo;speedy and full recovery&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, the news &ldquo;deepens our compassion for all who are seriously ill&rdquo; and those looking after them.</p>
<p>And Mayor of London Sadiq Khan tweeted that St Thomas&rsquo; Hospital had &ldquo;some of the finest medical staff in the world&rdquo; and that the prime minister &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t be in safer hands&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dominic Raab: Boris Johnson &ldquo;still remains in charge of the government&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the government&rsquo;s daily coronavirus briefing earlier on Monday, Mr Raab stressed that the prime minister had been continuing to run the government from hospital.</p>
<p>Asked whether that was appropriate, Mr Raab said Mr Johnson would &ldquo;take the medical advice that he gets from his doctor&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a team&hellip; that is full throttle making sure that his directions and his instructions are being implemented,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The foreign secretary added that he had not spoken to the prime minister since Saturday.</p>
<p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who also tested positive for the virus and spent time in self-isolation, offered &ldquo;all possible best wishes to Boris Johnson and his loved ones&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know he will receive the best possible care from our amazing NHS,&rdquo; he tweeted.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.wsj.net/im-173436/social" alt="img">
LONDON—British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, fighting a serious coronavirus infection, was admitted to the intensive care unit of a London hospital Monday evening, leaving his country’s leadership in question at a moment of deep crisis as the virus’s spread accelerates.</p>
<p>As Mr. Johnson’s condition worsened, he deputized his foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, to run the government, a spokesman said. The 55-year-old premier was conscious when he was wheeled into the intensive care unit of a central London hospital at around 7 p.m&hellip;.

<p><img src="https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2020/03/000_1Q23AE-1024x640.jpg" alt="img">
LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was moved Monday to the intensive care unit of a London hospital after his coronavirus symptoms worsened.</p>
<p>Johnson’s office said Johnson is conscious and does not require ventilation at the moment.</p>
<p>Johnson was admitted to St. Thomas’ Hospital late the night before, 10 days after he was diagnosed with COVID-19. He has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to deputize for him.</p>

<p>Israeli leaders wished him a speedy recovery.</p>
<p>“Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the People of Israel pray for the speedy and full recovery of our friend British Prime Minister Boris Johnson,” Netanyahu tweeted.</p>

<p>Israel’s Foreign Minister Israel Katz tweeted: “Our thoughts are with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson this evening. We are praying for his speedy recovery.”</p>
<p>And Blue and White party chief Benny Gantz stated: “My heart goes out to Prime Minister Boris Johnson and to the British people during these difficult moments. I send my wishes for a full and speedy recovery to the prime minister.”</p>
<p>There was no indication of how long Johnson might remain hospitalized. The prime minister’s spokesman said earlier that Johnson had spent a comfortable night and remained in charge of government, despite being admitted to St Thomas’ Hospital, when COVID-19 symptoms of a cough and fever persisted 10 days after he was diagnosed.</p>
<p>Johnson had sent out a tweet thanking the National Health Service for taking care of him and others in this difficult time.</p>
<p>“On the advice of my doctor, I went into hospital for some routine tests, as I’m still experiencing coronavirus symptoms,” Johnson said in the tweet. “I’m in good spirits and keeping in touch with my team, as we work together to fight this virus and keep everyone safe.”</p>
<p>Johnson’s spokesman, James Slack, refused to say what kind of tests Johnson was undergoing. He insisted that “the PM remains in charge of the government.”</p>
<p>“He is receiving updates in hospital and is continuing to receive a (ministerial red) box” of files and briefing papers, Slack said.</p>
<p>The 55-year-old leader had been quarantined in his Downing Street residence since being diagnosed with COVID-19 on March 26 — the first known head of government to fall ill with the virus.</p>
<p>He continued to preside at daily meetings on the outbreak until Sunday, and released several video messages during his 10 days in isolation. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab chaired the meeting on Monday.</p>
<p>Britain has no official post of deputy prime minister, but Raab has been designated to take over, should Johnson become incapacitated.</p>
<p>Speaking at the government’s daily coronavirus press briefing, Raab said Johnson was being “regularly updated,” but admitted he had not spoken to him since Saturday.</p>
<p>“He’s in charge, but he’ll continue to take doctors’ advice on what to do next,” Raab said.</p>
<p>Johnson was admitted to the hospital as a message to the nation from Queen Elizabeth II was being broadcast Sunday evening. The 93-year-old monarch urged the public to show resolve and follow advice to stay inside.</p>
<p>Concerns had been growing about Johnson’s welfare ever since he posted a message Friday saying that he was feeling better, though he was still feverish.</p>
<p>The virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most people, but for some, especially older adults and the infirm, it can cause pneumonia and lead to death.</p>
<p>The government said Monday that 51,608 people had been confirmed to have the coronavirus in Britain, 5,373 of whom have died.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of being in the hospital is that it will allow doctors to directly monitor Johnson’s condition.</p>
<p>Derek Hill, a professor of medical imaging science at University College London said that since COVID-19 causes difficulty breathing, one test performed on people with the disease is lung imaging with ultrasound or CT scans to see how badly they might be affected.</p>
<p>“Some people are rapidly discharged,” he said. “Some others can quickly deteriorate and need help breathing. We have no reason to believe the PM needs such help.”</p>
<p>Hill said there are various types of breathing help, depending on the person and the difficulties.</p>
<p>“The reasons some people get seriously ill with COVID-19 while others have minor symptoms is not yet fully understood,” Hill said. “But doctors managing these patients report that more men than women have serious problems, and patients who are overweight or have previous health problems are at higher risk.”
