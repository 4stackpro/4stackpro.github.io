But Kissinger said the Trump administration has done &ldquo;a solid job in avoiding immediate catastrophe,&rdquo; but the ultimate test faced by Trump&rsquo;s government is to stop the spread as quickly as possible to regain the American people&rsquo;s trust.</p>
<p>The former secretary admitted the shortfalls of the U.S. handling the coronavirus. The infections are doubling every fifth day, with no cure or vaccine, tests are not enough to identify the extent of infection and hospitals are overwhelmed, he said.</p>
<p>Kissinger, who served under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, wrote in an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal on Friday that the coronavirus has &ldquo;struck with unprecedented scale and ferocity&rdquo; and it will alter the world order forever.</p>
<p>Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger issued a dire warning that the world will never be the same after the coronavirus pandemic and the failure to resolve the crisis could &ldquo;set the world on fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As of early Monday, the U.S. has reported 337,620 confirmed cases and 9,643 deaths, according to the latest data released by Johns Hopkins University. Some 17,530 people have recovered from the disease.</p>
<p>White House medical experts have forecast that between 100,000 to 240,000 Americans could die in the pandemic, even if sweeping orders to stay home are followed.</p>
<p>The veteran in diplomacy said world leaders had been dealing with the crisis on a largely national basis but the U.S. needs to work quickly to find a solution to rebuild the global economy and protect the &ldquo;liberal world order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The political and economic upheaval it has unleashed could last for generations. No country, not even the U.S., can in a purely national effort overcome the virus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kissinger urged the U.S. to work with the rest of the world, saying &ldquo;the necessities of the moment must ultimately be coupled with a global collaborative vision and program.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He therefore proposed three steps that the U.S. should do in a post-coronavirus world, the first being finding a cure or vaccine for the virus and developing new technologies for infection control.</p>
<p>The second step is to heal the wounds to the world economy. He said the virus has unleashed the world economy at unprecedented speed globally and the situation is more complex, &ldquo;unlike anything ever known in history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The U.S. should have plans for protect effects of upcoming chaos on the world&rsquo;s most vulnerable populations, he wrote.</p>
<p>The third and last step he noted is to &ldquo;safeguard the principle of the liberal world order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pandemic has prompted an anachronism, a revival of the walled city in an age when prosperity depends on global trade and movement of people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world&rsquo;s democracies need to defend and sustain their Enlightenment values&rdquo; by continuing to provide security, order, economic well-being, and justice – the fundamental needs of people, he wrote. &ldquo;A global retreat from balancing power with legitimacy will cause the social contract to disintegrate both domestically and internationally.&rdquo;

<h3 id="covid-19-pandemic-will-forever-change-the-world-order-says-kissinger">COVID-19 pandemic will forever change the world order, says Kissinger</h3>
<p><img src="https://dimg.donga.com/a/500/0/90/5/ugc/CDB/ENGLISH/Article/5e/8a/61/43/5e8a614322bdd2738245.jpg" alt="img">
COVID-19 pandemic will forever change the world order, says Kissinger. April. 06, 2020 07:52. <a href="mailto:oldsport@donga.com">oldsport@donga.com</a>.</p>
<p>Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger shared his diagnostic view of the COVID-19 pandemic on Friday (local time), saying that it will forever alter the world order. While serving the secretary of state and national security adviser for the Nixon and Ford administrations, he contributed mainly to the establishment of diplomatic ties between the United States and China in 1987, making him living proof of Washington’s diplomatic achievements.</p>
<p>“The reality is the world will never be the same after the coronavirus,” said Kissinger in an editorial on The Wall Street Journal. “The U.S. must protect its citizens from disease while starting the urgent work of planning for a new epoch.”</p>
<p>“The surreal atmosphere of the COVID-19 pandemic calls to mind how I felt as a young man in the 84th Infantry Division during the Battle of the Bulge,” Kissinger wrote. As a son of German Jewish family, he joined World War II. Breaking out on Dec. 16, 1944, the Battle of the Bulge continued for more than a year until Jan. 25, 1945. It was the last major counteroffensive mission on the Western Front during the war, costing more than 190,000 lives.</p>
<p>“Now, as in late 1944, there is a sense of inchoate danger, aimed not at any particular person, but striking randomly and with devastation,” Kissinger said. However, he pointed out that there is a difference between the past and our time. “American endurance then was fortified by an ultimate national purpose. Now, in a divided country, efficient and farsighted government is necessary to overcome obstacles unprecedented in magnitude and global scope,” he wrote. His message intends to tacitly criticize the Trump administration for its poor response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>He was also critical that countries across the world are hell-bent on ensuring their own survival with their doors closed to each other. “Nations cohere and flourish on the belief that their institutions can foresee calamity, arrest its impact and restore stability. When the COVID-19 pandemic is over, many countries’ institutions will be perceived as having failed,” he said. The 96-year-old politician added that the virus does not know borders although global leaders are trying to address the crisis on a mainly national basis. He stressed that the key is not a purely national effort but greater international cooperation.</p>
<p>“While the assault on human health will - hopefully - be temporary, the political and economic upheaval it has unleashed could last for generations,” he elaborated, adding that the liberal world order can be put at risk. “The pandemic has prompted an anachronism, a revival of the walled city in an age when prosperity depends on global trade and movement of people.” He went on to emphasize that the United States should lead the effort to safeguard Enlightenment values.</p>

Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has warned coronavirus could cause global economic doom that could last for generations if appropriate measures aren&rsquo;t taken.</p>
<p>Kissinger, who served under President Nixon and President Ford, wrote an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal on Friday, issuing a dire proclamation that &lsquo;failure could set the world on fire&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The 96-year-old believes the White House has done &lsquo;a solid job in avoiding immediate catastrophe,&rsquo; but adds the government needs to work efficiently and in a farsighted manner to beat the disease, not only to regain Americans&rsquo; trust but the world&rsquo;s trust.</p>
<p>Kissinger writes: &lsquo;When the Covid-19 pandemic is over, many countries’ institutions will be perceived as having failed. Whether this judgement is objectively fair is irrelevant. The reality is the world will never be the same after the coronavirus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He says the US needs to work quickly to find a cure, pitch in to rebuild the global economy and protect the &lsquo;liberal world order&rsquo;, adding &lsquo;not even the U.S. can in a purely national effort overcome the virus.&rsquo;</p>

<p>As of Saturday morning, there has been 1.1 million people who tested positive for the deadly virus and 60,400 dead globally, according to the CDC.</p>
<p>In the United States, there are 278,602 cases and 7,170 dead, according to a community-sourced data tracker.</p>
<p>No cure has been found and medical workers have sounded the alarm that there is not enough personal protective equipment to keep themselves safe, as several doctors and nurses have died while treating patients.</p>
<p>Kissinger acknowledges the shortfalls, writing: &lsquo;Medical supplies are insufficient to cope with the widening waves of cases. Intensive-care units are on the verge, and beyond, of being overwhelmed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Testing is inadequate to the task of identifying the extent of infection, much less reversing its spread. A successful vaccine could be 12 to 18 months away. '</p>
<p>To beat the virus, Kissinger writes the US needs to work with the rest of the world, saying, &lsquo;the necessities of the moment must ultimately be coupled with a global collaborative vision and program.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He offers three steps the US needs to take in order to work toward beating coronavirus and then stabilising the economy, the first being finding a cure or treatment for the virus.</p>

<p>Kissinger writes: &lsquo;We need to develop new techniques and technologies for infection control and commensurate vaccines across large populations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cities, states and regions must consistently prepare to protect their people from pandemics through stockpiling, cooperative planning and exploration at the frontiers of science.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The next step is to &lsquo;heal the wounds to the world economy&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He points to the 2008 financial crisis, saying current conditions are even more complex - due to the virus&rsquo; global scale, schools closing down, restaurants shuttering and social distancing practices.</p>
<p>Kissinger writes special programs need to be developed to help fix the damage of those most affected by the shutdown.</p>
<p>Lastly, Kissinger writes the principles of the liberal world order need to be protected, noting that an enlightened government believes it should provide &lsquo;security, order, economic well-being, and justice&rsquo;.</p>
<p>He writes: &lsquo;The pandemic has prompted an anachronism, a revival of the walled city in an age when prosperity depends on global trade and movement of people.</p>

<p>Kissinger fled with his parents from Nazi Germany in 1938 and resettled in New York.</p>
<p>After graduating from Harvard with a political science degree in 1950, he began working as a consultant for various councils and government agencies, including the Operations Research Office, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the Department of State.</p>
<p>In the 1960s he worked for Republican presidential candidate Nelson Rockefeller&rsquo;s campaign as his foreign policy advisor, but switched to Richard Nixon&rsquo;s camp after he won the nomination in 1968.</p>
<p>When Nixon won, he made Kissinger his National Security Advisor and later his Secretary of State. He continued the position when Gerald Ford became president.</p>
<p>Kissinger won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973 along with North Vietnam&rsquo;s Le Duc for their efforts to negotiate a peaceful settlement of the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the NIH&rsquo;s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the US is &lsquo;not even at half-time&rsquo; in the fight against coronavirus</p>
<p>The United States currently has the highest number of confirmed cases of coronavirus, although China&rsquo;s official numbers are being questioned.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the NIH&rsquo;s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the US is &lsquo;not even at half-time&rsquo; in the fight against coronavirus.</p>
<p>He appeared on Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski&rsquo;s radio show Basketball and Beyond with Coach K, and Krzyzewski referred to Fauci, who is also on the White House&rsquo;s coronavirus task force, as &lsquo;America&rsquo;s point guard&rsquo; in the fight against COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.</p>
<p>Fauci, 79, was asked how the US is responding to the outbreak and asked to provide a basketball analogy for context.</p>
<p>The physician, who&rsquo;s led the US in several battles including against AIDS and Ebola, played basketball in high school while growing up in New York City.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you want to do the basketball analogy, that right now we have a team that&rsquo;s a very powerful team, and that&rsquo;s the virus, and what we need to do is that we&rsquo;ve got to play a full-court press,&rsquo; Fauci said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mean, we can&rsquo;t let them get the ball on the ground to dribble. We&rsquo;ve just got to be all over them&hellip;We&rsquo;re not even at halftime, Coach K.&rsquo;
