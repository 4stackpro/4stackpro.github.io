“Whether it’s in front of the audience or behind the scenes, you get into it (the theatre) because you love it,” he says. “The ghost light honours those who held that same connection but are no longer with us.”</p>
<p>Perhaps in early December 1918, the electrician thought of Cawthra Mulock as he turned on the light in the quiet theatre after the amused audience of “Take It From Me” shuffled home. Mulock was the kind of person who seemed unstoppable — he had been largely responsible for the Royal Alex’s existence. By Dec. 1 he was another person killed by a virus that didn’t care if you were wealthy, in your prime or a builder of city institutions.</p>
<p>Mulock was known in turn-of-the-century Toronto as the “boy millionaire.” Handsome and charming, he was born into wealth, and became richer when a great aunt died and left millions to him in trust when he was a teenager. As he came of age, he was involved with life insurance, trust companies, banking and bread interests. He was entrepreneurial, but also charitable, giving $100,000 for the construction of Toronto General Hospital.</p>
<p>In his history of the Royal Alex, Robert Brockhouse writes that some said Mulock was motivated to build the beaux-arts theatre by “nothing but aristocratic conceit,” after he’d been turned away from a sold-out show at the Princess — considered Toronto’s finest theatrical venue before the Alex. His family said it was civic pride, his way to give Toronto more cultural cachet.</p>
<p>His new theatre made a big splash when it opened with the extravaganza “Top O’ Th’ World” in August 1907. The newspapers noted the fashionable audience, the “tasteful harmony” of the colour scheme, the sumptuous touches like the onyx-walled entrance hall and how the entire building cost twice as much as the original estimate. It was the toast of the city’s theatre scene and the stationery used by staff declared it the “Finest Theatre in Canada.” Of course, it didn’t matter what class of theatre you were in, in October 1918, when medical officer of health Dr. Charles Hastings ordered the lot of them closed along with other places of entertainment.</p>
<p>The theatre changed its ads for the “Kiss Burglar” show as the closure loomed in the middle of the month: “Hurry!! Its Joy Kills the ‘Flu.’ Your last chance to laugh. Hurry!!”</p>
<p>By the end of October, the city’s theatre managers were advised that they could reopen as long as they fumigated and aired their buildings out. Schools and church services were also due to resume their regular activities. The Royal Alex was back in business on Nov. 4 with “Ask Dad.”</p>
<p>Wasn’t there a danger of reoccurrence, Hastings was asked at a meeting of city officials. “No,” he said. “As the disease dies down the organism becomes less and less virulent.”</p>
<p>While case counts and deaths were down in the city’s hospitals, there was no vaccine or treatment. (A 2007 study of American cities showed another wave hit after restrictions were relaxed.)</p>
<p>But by the end of November 1918, Robert Brockhouse writes, “all worry seemed gone for good,” so Cawthra Mulock, 36, went to New York on a business trip.</p>
<p>He planned to see a few shows and maybe find a few hits for the coming months. But a day after he arrived, Brockhouse writes, Mulock was sick. He was taken to hospital and by Dec. 1 he was dead, leaving behind his wife and children, and shocking Toronto. “Young Toronto Millionaire-Capitalist Dies in a New York Hospital,” reported the Star. “Death calls big financier,” said the Globe. After a funeral at the family’s home on Jarvis Street, he was buried in St. James Cemetery, one of the estimated 55,000 Canadians killed by the virus between 1918 and 1920.</p>
<p>In 1963, the Mirvish family purchased the Royal Alex from the trustees who had been running it since Mulock’s death, Karastamatis says. Now facing the second pandemic in its long history, the theatre is again shuttered, along with Mirvish’s three other theatres.</p>
<p>“Les Misérables,” set for a summer run, has been cancelled, and single tickets for the fall season have not been offered for sale. At the Royal Alex, the set from “Come From Away’ is still onstage; the set of “Hamilton” likewise waits at the Ed Mirvish Theatre. Security guards watch over the theatres and maintenance staff check in on the pipes but, other than that, the stages are frozen in place.</p>
<p>Antheunis says the city hasn’t faced a theatre shutdown like this “for a long time … The theatres kept going through the wars … we shut down the theatres for 9/11 briefly, but it was only a couple of days.”</p>
<p>Most of his union members are out of work, but Antheunis says some continue to be employed or have been rehired under the federal government’s wage subsidy. The latter has been complicated — most members work show to show and venue to venue, “so you can’t get them to do a wage subsidy when that employee has 19 different employers throughout the year,” he says.</p>
<p>Toronto is lucky because the city has a well-rooted theatre scene with local actors, designers and productions, he says. Once restrictions lift, it will be easier to restart local shows than touring shows, which could face border and quarantine issues.</p>
<p>For now, all of the city’s theatres are dark. The ghost light will remain on the stage at the Royal Alex until it is safe for the show to go on.</p>
<p>“And that’s the big question,” Karastamatis says. “When will it be safe enough?”

<h3 id="kate-middletons-floral-ghost-dress-has-sold-out---see-why-fans-will-be-thrilled">Kate Middleton&rsquo;s floral Ghost dress has sold-out - see why fans will be thrilled</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.hellomagazine.com/imagenes/fashion/royal-style/2020042688723/kate-middleton-ghost-dress-profits-donated-nhs/0-425-463/kate-middleton-ghost-dress-t.jpg" alt="img">
The Duchess of Cambridge delighted royal fans on Thursday when she made a surprise appearance on BBC One&rsquo;s The Big Night In alongside husband Prince William and their three children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. While many were initially disappointed to find that Kate&rsquo;s stunning Ghost dress is no longer available to buy online, they will be thrilled to hear how it is helping support the NHS amid the COVID-19 crisis.</p>

<p>WATCH: the Cambridges clap for the NHS</p>
<p>A video on the TV show showed the family of five joining in with the &lsquo;Clap for our Carers&rsquo; campaign, stepping outside their front door dressed in head-to-toe blue to publicly recognise and applaud NHS workers battling the coronavirus outbreak. As usual, all eyes were on Kate&rsquo;s stunning outfit, which was a beautiful blue floral Ghost frock known as the &lsquo;Anouk&rsquo; design which featured a ruffle hemline and pretty puff sleeves. Unsurprisingly, it flew off the virtual shelves and even mysteriously disappeared from the brand&rsquo;s website shortly after her appearance. The &lsquo;Kate effect&rsquo; regularly causes sell-outs with fans rushing to emulate the Duchess&rsquo; style, but after hearing the brand&rsquo;s latest announcement, we reckon the public will be glad it&rsquo;s so popular.</p>

<p>On Friday, Ghost took to social media to reveal all sales from the dress would go towards NHS charities. &ldquo;We are donating all of our online proceeds from the Anouk dress to the NHS @nhscharitiestogether @nhswebsite. We strive to continuously support the amazing work that the NHS staff and volunteers are doing, throughout this challenging battle against COVID-19, to keep us all safe. Thank you NHS, we truly appreciate you,&rdquo; Ghost captioned the Instagram post.</p>
<p>Ghost shared the sweet announcement on social media</p>
<p>Many fans were even more inclined to get their hands on the dress considering the worthy cause, and after several inquiries about where to buy the dress, the brand responded: &ldquo;Unfortunately we sold out earlier today but please do keep checking the website in case we receive returns!&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="valorant-weapon-guide-the-ghost">VALORANT weapon guide: The Ghost</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.invenglobal.com/upload/image/2020/04/25/r1587810708717407.jpeg" alt="img">
There are many weapons in VALORANT, the tactical first-person shooter made by Riot Games. In order to become a master of the game, it&rsquo;s pivotal that you learn to master the weapons in it. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve made a series of weapon guides for VALORANT weapons discussing the weapon cost, the weapon damage, and controlling the weapon&rsquo;s recoil. In this guide, we&rsquo;ll be talking about the Ghost pistol.</p>
<p>Cost</p>
<p>The Ghost is on the expensive side of the sidearm spectrum, costing a total of 500 credits. This means that, at the start of each half in VALORANT, you cannot pair a Ghost purchase with a Light Shield too. Instead, it only leaves room for ability purchases. It&rsquo;s a significant tradeoff to make, and one that cheaper guns such as the Frenzy or the Classic don&rsquo;t force you to make. A massive upside is that the Ghost is the only pistol in VALORANT with a silencer, meaning it&rsquo;s easier to land multiple shots on enemies while they&rsquo;re trying to find out where the shots are coming from.</p>
<p>Damage</p>
<p>The Ghost does a lot of damage for a handgun and is especially rewarding for precise aim. Hitting the target&rsquo;s body or leg with the Ghost deals slightly more damage than shots with the Classic or the Frenzy would. However, headshots deal vastly more damage. Up to thirty meters, landing a headshot with the Ghost instantly kills an opponent not wearing a shield.</p>
<p>The Ghost&rsquo;s headshot damage does drop off significantly after thirty meters. However, the Ghost remains incredibly powerful, dealing more damage at any range than all other sidearms except for the Sheriff. In the table below, you can see the exact numbers for the Ghost&rsquo;s damage in VALORANT:</p>
<p>Target: 0-30 meter range 30-50 meter range Body 30 damage 25 damage Head 105 damage 88 damage Leg 26 damage 21 damage</p>
<p>With fifteen bullets in its magazine, firing at a 6.75 rounds per second rate, the Ghost is capable of dealing a lot of damage in a short amount of time. Even if you&rsquo;re just landing body shots, it&rsquo;ll take anywhere from four to six bullets to take down the enemy.</p>
<p>Recoil</p>
<p>The Ghost is a very precise weapon, especially for a sidearm. Its rapid fire rate has very low impact on its accuracy when compared to other pistols such as the Frenzy and the Sheriff. Up to twenty meters, you can relatively safely blast away with the Ghost and reliably hit your target. And even at thirty meters, the first few bullets will still be very accurate.</p>
<p>The Ghost&rsquo;s recoil pattern at various distances.</p>
<p>The Ghost isn&rsquo;t a weapon you actively think about recoil control with. In VALORANT, there simply aren&rsquo;t many locations with distances so long that the Ghost&rsquo;s recoil becomes an active problem. In the few cases where you are staring down an opponent from across thirty meters or more, the best strategy to apply is double-tapping: the Ghost&rsquo;s first two bullets are incredibly accurate even at a fifty-meter range.</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise that many seasoned first-person shooter players are in love with the Ghost. Its combination of damage, accuracy, and the silencer make it a reliable, powerful sidearm. It&rsquo;s a great weapon for rounds where you&rsquo;re low on money to spend, but still want to deal a hefty amount of damage. If you&rsquo;re confident in your aim, or like to sneak up on your enemies, the Ghost is your go-to weapon.</p>
