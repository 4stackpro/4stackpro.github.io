We’re starting to find a strange new rhythm. For those of us still working, it might be a day at the desk, a walk and a family meal. There are children to supervise or entertain, calls to check on loved ones, some virtual socialising, streaming, reading and an occasional trip to the supermarket with a carefully drawn list, after calculating how best to avoid crowds.</p>
<p>The one thing we can’t do is plan. Work diaries, usually blocked out with colour-coded meetings and commitments, are bare. There’s no need to consult the family calendars pinned to the fridge either, because no one is going to those birthday parties or school dates or weekends away.</p>
<p>Having spent years downloading mindfulness apps as an antidote to our busyness, we’re all trying to live in the present because the future feels even scarier than this strange closed-in life. The possibility that it could last six months or more doesn’t bear too much consideration.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 exit strategy: when will Australia know the coronavirus battle is over? Read more</p>
<p>There’s plenty to worry about, of course, but without detailed, personal calculations about tomorrow, next week or next school holidays running through our heads, it really is easier to pay full attention to sunlit leaves or birdsong or cooking smells. It’s unsettling, to be drifting like this, untethered from the future, but for many of us it’s bearable, for now.</p>
<p>But as “the curve” flattens and fears of replicating the horror scenarios that are playing out internationally subside, we are realising that our future plans are contingent on the Big Plan, a national “exit strategy” that will require diabolical decisions trading off public health, social cohesion and economic disaster. And we all do need to think about that.</p>
<p>Restrictions will continue to be necessary until a vaccine is found, but they might be dialled up or down depending on infection rates, according to a study in the Lancet, based on the experience of China.</p>
<p>Considering this option is not accepting the stupidly brutal advocacy of an immediate end to lockdowns in the service of free market ideology, nor the horrifying social Darwinist argument that a rapid lifting of restrictions would still see the fittest survive. It’s based on an assessment that we might not be able to live like this, or be able to afford to live like this, for the year to 18 months, or even longer, that it might take for a vaccine to be developed.</p>
<p>Have Australia and New Zealand stopped Covid-19 in its tracks? Read more</p>
<p>Governments have started to talk about the trade-offs involved in various exit plan options. Understandably, they are approaching the topic tentatively, because most of us will stay housebound for months, and because of the serious potential consequences of even a small relaxation of the rules. The national cabinet has asked health experts for advice, and Australia-specific modelling. But these are not judgments that can be made solely on the basis of economic calculations or epidemiological forecasting. They are moral and ethical questions that require not just our heads but also our hearts.</p>
<p>As Ben Doherty wrote for Guardian Australia this week there’s no room for complacency in these calculations, as overseas experience shows, lifting restrictions carries a real risk of another infection wave.</p>
<p>“Singapore, for weeks the darling of international comparison … has since seen a dramatic spike in the number of infections – a 60% jump in new daily infections – and has announced a further tightening of restrictions … Japan, similarly, having kept infections low for two months, has now declared a month-long state of emergency in response to a jump in new cases,” he wrote.</p>
<p>The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has started flagging the idea of trials: some states cautiously easing restrictions earlier than others, standing vigilant to reapply them if the virus spread gets out of hand.</p>
<p>“You will have some jurisdictions, some states and territories, that might be in a position to move when others are not, then we will learn from the experience of those states that may have trialled things,” he said this week</p>
<p>The New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, promised her state’s restrictions would be reviewed regularly, but she was clearer about the trade-off; “every time you relax a restriction, more people will get sick, more people will die”.</p>
<p>All around the world attention is turning to these exit plan options, and the fraught questions they raise.</p>
<p>Exactly how do we calibrate the inevitable increase in infection rate with health system capacity and how do we avoid a devastating second and third wave of disease? What preparations need to be made so we have the capacity to identify, test and isolate most confirmed Covid-19 contacts and their close contacts? How many test kits and ICU beds do we need?</p>
<p>Can I visit my parents or family at Easter? Australia’s coronavirus lockdown rules and restrictions explained Read more</p>
<p>What levels of surveillance, and what sacrifices of privacy could be involved in test-and-trace?</p>
<p>These are high-stakes decisions for us all, and as epidemiologist Tony Blakely argued this week they need to be made with public understanding and consent.</p>
<p>“I am strongly advocating that Australia uses the next few weeks to deliberate on what we do next. That means pulling back from the (necessary till now) unchecked executive authority of government, and re-instituting parliamentary oversight … We need to also hear from a wide range of experts to help us deliberate. Philosophers, ethicists, economists, public health experts and epidemiologists – to name just a few,” he wrote in the Nine newspapers.</p>
<p>“At the end of this deliberation process, it will necessarily return to the politicians to ‘make the call’. But they need some sense of societal consent.”</p>
<p>It’s too late for parliamentary oversight. Parliament stands adjourned until August, apart from the committee scrutinising the new coronavirus laws. But it is not too late for the national conversation, with all the relevant modelling and information made publicly available.</p>
<p>Getting this plan right is a path to one day resuming our individual plans, to reclaiming a future. But it has consequences that demand compassion and deep consideration.

<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200410012907-australia-beaches-coronavirus-lockdown-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
(CNN) — Most years, Easter weekend marks the last big hurrah of beautiful warm weather in Australia</p>
<p>But 2020 isn&rsquo;t any ordinary year. Amid the worldwide Covid-19 epidemic , people all over the world are being asked to practice social distancing and stay indoors as much as possible.</p>
<p>For Aussies who were hoping to spend a holiday weekend at the beach, though, this edict is proving a challenge.</p>

<p>Arguably the most famous beach in all of Australia, Sydney&rsquo;s Bondi closed to the public last month when locals had too difficult a time staying away.</p>
<p>Since then, Bondi&rsquo;s beachside pavilion has transformed from a place to get snacks and change into swimsuits into a pop-up coronavirus testing center.</p>
<p>The neighborhood had been identified as a hotspot for coronavirus cases, some of which are being linked to the many backpackers who come from around the world to stay in hostels near the water.</p>

<p>Now, the beaches along the Gold Coast in Queensland are also officially off-limits as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For us to win this fight against Covid-19, we&rsquo;re in it together, and if a minority of people are congregating and spreading it &hellip; in this case, health is the number-one priority,&rdquo; Tom Tate, mayor of the Gold Coast, told media.</p>
<p>He added a warning to residents and non-residents alike: &ldquo;Happy Easter, but stay home and stay out of the Gold Coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Currently, Australia has 6,109 confirmed cases of the Covid-19 coronavirus, according to data from the World Health Organization.</p>

<h3 id="have-australia-and-new-zealand-stopped-covid-19-in-its-tracks">Have Australia and New Zealand stopped Covid-19 in its tracks?</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bd4648de91595554b5bb66b0b6d0abdd18f6edc/0_32_5284_3171/master/5284.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=a3782d770001804990b38057a1dcce2e" alt="img">
Southern hemisphere neighbours have developed different strategies but both are working – for now</p>
<p>More than 35,000km (21,750 miles) of coastline was always going to be Australia’s strongest advantage in keeping coronavirus at bay, but even so, the speed with which it was used was breathtaking.</p>
<p>Without warning on Thursday 19 March, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced: “Australia is closing its borders to all-non citizens”. The ban was effective from 9pm the next day.</p>
<p>That left visitors and visa holders stranded mid-journey, or turned around at the border and packed back on to planes, and left hundreds of thousands of Australians scrambling to get home, many of whom remain stuck in countries similarly locked down or without flights home.</p>
<p>Australia and neighbouring New Zealand, almost unique among anglophone countries, have so far been successful in largely suppressing the spread of Covid-19 within their countries, and in particular, keeping deaths low.</p>
<p>Australia, with a population of 25 million, has had just over 6,000 infections, and 50 deaths. New Zealand, a country of 5 million people, which closed its borders the day before Australia, has had 1,200 infections and so far only one death from Covid-19.</p>
<p>Both countries have enacted strict physical distancing regimes, enforced by police. Planes have been grounded, workers have been told to stay home, schools have been closed in some places, and entire industries put into hibernation.</p>
<p>Across most of both countries, it is unlawful to be outside without the “reasonable excuse” of essential shopping, medical care, exercise, or compassionate grounds. In both countries, the majority of confirmed cases have originated overseas. Community transmission remains, by international comparison, low– less than 10% of all confirmed cases.</p>
<p>And in both countries, the early decision, and the capability, to enforce a total lockdown of borders has proven crucial, buying valuable time to prepare, and allowing both nations to flatten the trajectory of their Covid-19 infection curves.</p>
<p>“We have so far avoided the horror scenarios that we have seen overseas, whether it be initially in China in Wuhan, or in New York in the United States, or Italy, or Spain, or even the United Kingdom,” Morrison said this week. “But we must hold the course. We must lock in these gains.”</p>
<p>Australia has inherent advantages. If a country were to be designed to withstand a viral pandemic such as Covid-19, it would look very much like Australia: geographically distant, a large island nation with borders than can be locked down, inhabited by a comparatively small population that lives, in the main, in low-density cities.</p>
<p>Australia is wealthy, too, with a highly developed public health system, and a government sufficiently solvent to be able to turn on the tap of public monies to get its population through the months of lockdown. Legislation for $130bn (£65bn) in wage subsidies for those who have lost jobs because of the pandemic was passed by parliament this week, on top of $84bn in economic stimulus promised earlier.</p>

<p>Australia also has had the advantage of watching the Covid-19 pandemic unfold in other countries. The delay has given it time to prepare its public health system – additional beds and staff have been readied for the coming peak– as well as its public. Internal restrictions have also been put in place. Australia’s states have closed their borders to each other for the first time since the Spanish flu outbreak of 1918.</p>
<p>There have been significant and severe missteps, the most egregious being the decision in March to allow the Ruby Princess cruise ship to dock at Circular Quay in Sydney Harbour, allowing more than 2,700 passengers to disembark without testing, despite there being people with Covid-19 infections onboard.</p>
<p>That ship is now responsible for more than 660 infections – 10% of Australia’s total – and at least 15 deaths. The New South Wales (NSW) and federal governments have since spent weeks blaming each other and the cruise ship company for the debacle: the decision is now the subject of a criminal investigation by police.</p>
<p>Another misstep was at Sydney airport. Just as physical distancing laws were being imposed across the country, social media videos showed border force officials corralling arriving passengers from all over the world to wait in cramped halls and tight queues.</p>
<p>Apart from the impact of these failures on infection rates, they have damaged public confidence in the government’s measures. Just as the country, state by state, was being put into lockdown, governments were undermining their own messages to self-isolate to save lives.</p>
<p>There has been, too, overreaction. In NSW, a man was fined by police for sitting on a park bench and eating a kebab. In Victoria, a learner driver practising with her mother was given a $1,600 fine, later rescinded after a backlash.</p>
<p>But Australians have, by and large, tolerated the imposition of lockdowns.</p>
<p>After thousands gathered at Bondi Beach on a warm autumnal Friday evening in March, it was summarily shut down and put under police guard. With occasional defiance, it has remained eerily deserted since.</p>
<p>Ten days after New Zealand’s centre-left government closed its borders to foreign nationals it introduced some of the toughest lockdown measures in the world. No one had yet died and cases had just passed 100.</p>
<p>“Stay home, save lives,” the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, urged her citizens, ordering them to remain in their homes for a month. “The situation here is moving at pace, and so must we. The trajectory is very clear, act now or risk the virus taking hold as it has elsewhere.”</p>
<p>Ardern thanks nation as New Zealand adjusts to &lsquo;new normal&rsquo; of Covid-19 lockdown Read more</p>
<p>Ardern said the worst-case scenario was “simply intolerable” – up to 80,000 dead, modelling predicted – representing the greatest loss of life in New Zealand’s history. “I will not take that chance,” Ardern said. “We’re going hard and we’re going early.”</p>
<p>The nation was given two days to prepare, panic buying was widespread. But when the moment came – effective house arrest for the majority of the population – there was absolute quiet on the streets.</p>
<p>Despite their reputation for having an independent streak and a benign disdain for authority, New Zealanders have been overwhelmingly compliant with the restrictive measures, with a total of 367 breaches recorded by police. Eager surfers and mountain bikers have caused the most persistent headaches, according to the police commissioner.</p>
<p>New Zealand is one of the few countries worldwide to pursue an “elimination” strategy, and the plan has the backing of the scientific community, many of whom want the country to stay in a version of lockdown until a vaccine can be deployed.</p>
<p>David Skegg, an emeritus professor of epidemiology at the University of Otago, said: “We could effectively eliminate the virus over the next few weeks … we still have a window of opportunity but only if we lift our game quickly.”</p>
<p>Fellow Otago epidemiologist Prof Michael Baker is one of the key architects behind New Zealand’s coronavirus defence plan. He says an elimination strategy is well suited to an island state, where borders can be swiftly and effectively closed.</p>
<p>Writing in the New Zealand Medical Journal, Baker said the strategy would save lives, but at huge social and economic cost, particularly “for those with the fewest resources”. “New Zealand society has made a large ‘upfront’ sacrifice in pursuing an elimination strategy,” he said.</p>
<p>For the first 12 days of lockdown, the numbers of cases rose steadily, as predicted by health officials. But cases have been steadily declining, and the prime minister has said she is “cautiously optimistic” that the strategy is working.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, New Zealand recorded its lowest number of new cases in a fortnight, one day after testing a record number of people. More people are now recovering from the disease than being infected by it, an “encouraging milestone”, the country’s director general of health said.</p>
<p>Attention and anticipation is turning to a gradual exit from lockdown in late April. Ardern has said it is likely some regions of the country will remain in total lockdown, while regions with few or no cases will ease into more freedoms. The borders remain closed to foreign nationals, and mandatory quarantining of arrivals is to be introduced today.</p>
<p>“We have positive signs, not least the fact that we could have had 4,000 cases now, instead of 1,000,” Ardern said.</p>
<p>“But I don’t want to get ahead of ourselves.”
