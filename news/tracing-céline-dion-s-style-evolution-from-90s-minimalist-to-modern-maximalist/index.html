Céline Dion has lived multiple fashion lives over the course of her near four decades-long career. The Canadian singer, who turns 52 today, is arguably one of music’s most exuberant dressers, beloved as much for her glorious voice as her extravagant sense of style.</p>
<p>It’s an evolution that started at the tender age of 13 with the release of her first album, La Voix du Bon Dieu (she would record eight more by the age of 18, racking up numerous awards along the way). Even still, few fans will remember the acid-wash jeans and spangly eighties prom dresses of her youth. It wasn’t until the 1990s, when Dion glided on to the world stage with Unison, her debut English language album, that she made her first big impressions on the red carpet. Her look at the time was altogether more soigné than that of her teen star persona, defined by the clean lines and minimalist mood of the moment. She was known to rock classic LBDs and sleek column dresses with whisper-thin spaghetti straps. That said, there were early signs of her risk-taking fashion impulses: take the red form-fitting gown (a tad sheer!) that she wore to an awards dinner in 1997.</p>
<p>Of course, Dion’s most hotly debated fashion moment of that decade came in 1999, when she wore Galliano’s controversial back-to-front tuxedo to the Oscars. At that point in her career, Dion was a bonafide superstar thanks to “My Heart Will Go On,” the chart-topping ballad off the Titanic (1997) soundtrack. Where other celebrities might have played it safe, Dion challenged the Academy status quo with a conceptual pant suit that was the opposite of Hollywood glamour. Though the outfit was universally panned by critics at the time, it now looks remarkably forward-thinking more than two decades later.</p>
<p>The singer cemented her superstar status in the early 2000s with high-wattage fashion choices becoming of a true diva. Dion began her long-standing residency at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace, performing in an array of dazzling gowns, all of which were heavy on color, crystals, and overall opulence. This continued well into the early 2010s, as her Las Vegas shows became more and more successful over the years.</p>
<p>In the 2010s, Dion switched things up, undergoing a major style transformation. She enlisted the help of celebrity stylist Law Roach circa 2016 who began dressing her in of-the-moment labels such as Balenciaga, Vetements (he even dressed her in the brand’s Titanic-themed hoodie), and more. It was during the couture shows in July that same year when her style renaissance came into the spotlight. Dion donned statement looks galore to the shows, each more eye-catching than the next. She was seen perched front row at Giambattista Valli in a romantic prairie white dress; then days later striding through the streets of Paris in a cool neon green Balenciaga dress.</p>
<p>Now a fixture on the couture scene, Dion has been working with stylists Pepe Muñoz and Sydney Lopez to shift her daring fashion sensibilities into higher gear. This year, Dion emerged in New York City wearing a slew of flamboyant, OTT outfits, including a head-to-toe floral print look by Richard Quinn x Moncler comprised of a coat and matching leggings. On any given afternoon, she’ll break out a gala-worthy dress, just because. She was recently spotted on the streets of Manhattan in ball-skirted floral ensemble by Oscar de la Renta—naturally, she carried a bouquet to match the print. For Dion, clearly every day brings a new reason to get totally dressed up.

<h3 id="flashback-céline-dions-1994-wedding-in-vintage-images">Flashback: Céline Dion&rsquo;s 1994 wedding in vintage images</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.vogue.fr/photos/5e81c0526d92d70008e0b9b2/16:9/w_1920,c_limit/GettyImages-113995777.jpg" alt="img">
An emblematic couple, Celine Dion and René Angelil have inspired fans as a working duo but also with a 21-year marriage proving its strength even in the star system. Vogue looks back in images and anecdotes about their union which took place on December 17, 1994.</p>
<p>The fulfilment of a long-lasting love</p>
<p>With the 26-year age difference between the singer and the producer being well known, it was necessary to hide their history for several years at the beginning of their romance. It was at the age of 12 that Celine Dion, with the support of her 13 siblings, sent her first demo to René Angelil. From then on, the Quebec producer never stopped taking care of the young prodigy&rsquo;s career. Their relationship was kept secret for a long time, it wasn&rsquo;t until 1987 and her first international tour that the 19-year-old singer brought up her relationship with René Angelil, the man she had been discreetly dating for a year. However, her mother was opposed to their relationship because of the age difference.</p>

<p>A winter wedding on December 17 1994</p>
<p>It was finally in 1991 and with the approval of her family that Celine Dion secretly got engaged to René Angelil. Broadcast on Canadian television, their wedding was held on December 17, 1994 at Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal: a winter wedding for which the star wore a voluminous wedding dress designed by Mirella and Steve Gentile adorned with a 6-meter-long train, whose lace and crystals would have required 1000 hours of work. The whole thing was accompanied by a mythical headdress made of 2000 Swarosvki crystals weighing more than 3 kilos.</p>

<p>A symbolic vow renewal</p>
<p>Fighting throat cancer since 1998, René Angelil was cured in 2000. For this new millennium and this good news, the couple renewed their vows in Las Vegas during a Melkite ceremony, a tribute to René Angelil&rsquo;s Melkite Catholic parents married in 1937. It was a sumptuous evening in keeping with the couple&rsquo;s image: Céline Dion shone in a traditional golden dress. The following year, the couple welcomed their first child René-Charles, followed by their twins Eddy and Nelson in 2010. Following the death of René Angelil in 2016, the couple remains one of those legendary celebrity duos that have proven that marriage can stand the test of time.</p>
