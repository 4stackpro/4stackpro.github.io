We’ve all been left to speculate on whether the coronavirus lockdown in South Africa will be extended past the scheduled date of 17 April. Although President Ramaphosa recently avoided any notion that these strict measures could last longer than three weeks, it seems inevitable that things won’t return to normal by next Friday.</p>
<p>Will lockdown last longer than three weeks?</p>
<p>In fact, the initial three-week lockdown period could resemble something like a three-month schedule. That’s according to a report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) – picked up by Rapport – which said new infections in South Africa will only peak ‘at the beginning of June’. The group suggested that restrictions will only be lifted somewhere between the end of June and the end of August, due to this factor.</p>
<p>The almost unfathomable timescale would confine South Africans to their homes (excluding essential trips) for somewhere between 12-16 weeks, and we’ve only just chalked the first one off. We’re expecting further communication on this matter at some point this week, and any lockdown extension could upset certain sections of the population.</p>
<p>Things to “get worse, before they get better”</p>
<p>In his letter to the public last week, Ramaphosa said that the most effective way to deal with coronavirus is to institute “stringent measures” in the form of a public lockdown. If he does have an unpopular decision to make, it will be one made within the best interests of South Africans in the fight against coronavirus.</p>
<p>More than half of the world’s population are currently operating under lockdown. But SA’s tentative date for lifting restrictions – at the end of next week – is looking flimsier by the minute. It’s tough to see how schools will re-open, and the potential for malls to resume trading and sports to return in April has been minimised.</p>
<p>With almost 1 600 coronavirus cases reported in South Africa, the death toll of nine remains relatively low. But with infections now being recorded in our sprawling townships, it’s likely these figures will eventually balloon. As Health Minister Zweli Mkhize has put it, this could very much be our “calm before the storm”.

<h3 id="shadow-minister-slams-south-africas-authoritarian-lockdown-laws">Shadow minister slams South Africa’s ‘authoritarian’ lockdown laws</h3>
<p><img src="https://gcs.thesouthafrican.com/2020/03/18859164-sandf-south-africa-lockdown.jpg" alt="img">
Dean Macpherson, an elected MP and DA shadow minister, has hit out at the way government is pursuing their newly established lockdown laws. The frustration comes after numerous stores reported that they weren’t selling certain hot foods, and complained of having to ‘sit on their stock’.</p>
<p>As prescribed by the National Disaster Act, South African shops are only allowed to sell ‘essential items’. The government have failed to clearly explain what this entails, leading to nationwide confusion. Macpherson himself rallied again the ban on hairbrushes and gardening equipment on Saturday.</p>
<p>Lockdown laws in South Africa – how much is too much?</p>
<p>But it would be another Tweet – which followed an official statement from his office – That turned heads. The DA’s trade and industry official said that SA was sliding towards an ‘authoritarian system’, and lamented the ANC for what he sees as a failure to ‘learn from our history’, referencing the cruel regime of apartheid.</p>
<p>“What the lockdown has shown is that are probably large numbers of people in South Africa who have no problem living under an authoritarian system where they are told what they can and can’t buy and when they can and can’t go out. It’s like we’ve learnt nothing from our history.” “It is illogical and makes no sense for instance that a store at a petrol station is not allowed to sell pies or that a grocery store is not allowed to sell prepared, warm food. We have seen even more ridiculous examples of this in this week of lockdown such as retail stores closing their magazines and snacks shelves and mothers of newborn babies not being able to buy clothes for their babies.”</p>
<p>Ministers flip-flop on rules</p>
<p>The reaction has been vociferous, with some accusing Macpherson of misreading the situation. However, the politician has stuck to his guns on Sunday, taking aim at Bheki Cele instead. The police minister has hinted he’d like to keep alcohol prohibition in place after lockdown – much to the chagrin of the DA:

<h3 id="in-locked-down-south-africa-unity-is-fleeting">In locked-down South Africa, unity is fleeting</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200401133712-02-johannesburg-lockdown-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
William Saunderson-Meyer is a South African newspaper columnist. Follow him on Twitter @TheJaundicedEye . The opinions expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.</p>
<p>(CNN) It was a rare moment of national unity in a country that in the past decade has become increasingly fractious and fraught with racial and ethnic tensions. But it did not last long.</p>
<p>To widespread local acclaim, South African president Cyril Ramaphosa last Monday announced that a 21-day national lockdown to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus would start at midnight that Thursday. The government&rsquo;s measures mean that the country&rsquo;s borders are now closed except for transportation of fuel and essential goods. Inter-provincial travel is banned. Public transport is restricted, and only business providing essential services can remain open. Solitary exercise is not permitted, and alcohol and cigarette sales have been stopped.</p>
<p>Ramaphosa&rsquo;s announcement came as the country had watched Covid-19 sweep the globe, overwhelming the health services of much wealthier and medically well-endowed nations. In Africa, the virus seemed to take a comparatively long time to establish itself, leading to a false sense of security among many, with some experts postulating that the hot African climate might be a factor in slowing transmission. In the crowded shantytowns and townships, more dangerously, some took it as evidence of black genetic immunity.</p>
<p>So Ramaphosa&rsquo;s attempt to &ldquo;flatten the curve,&rdquo; with South Africa on March 22 having registered a modest 400 or so cases without any deaths, was a bold, preemptive move. (By April 2, the number of infections had surpassed 1,400.)</p>
<p>Nevertheless, lockdown must have been a difficult decision. Ramaphosa took a calculated gamble that it would save a thinly stretched health system from being inundated, without destroying an extremely fragile economy already grappling with recession ; one of the world&rsquo;s worst unemployment rates and a &ldquo;junk&rdquo; credit rating status. Despite the risks, the lockdown announcement drew cross-party support and the president&rsquo;s performance was widely hailed on social media for his strong performance. &ldquo;Business Day,&rdquo; often critical of Ramaphosa&rsquo;s African National Congress (ANC) government, enthused : &ldquo;When the country needed leadership at a time of crisis, it had a president who was ready to provide it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the national unity and common purpose that Ramaphosa sought to encourage lasted less than 24 hours before old ethnic suspicions within the populace and authoritarian tendencies within government started to reassert themselves.</p>
<p>An immediate point of contention was the new Solidarity Fund that the president announced and charged with an array of ambitious goals: combating and tracking the spread of Covid-19, caring for the ill, and supporting small businesses and their employees. The structuring of the Fund was vintage Ramaphosa, a former union leader and one of the negotiators of South Africa&rsquo;s democratic transition, whose leadership style is to stress consensus and social compacts. Since the SA fiscus doesn&rsquo;t have the financial resources to pump billions of dollars into the system to ease the economic effect of the virus, the still overwhelmingly white-run private sector&rsquo;s buy-in was crucial. He also had to dispel the inevitable skepticism toward any government initiative, given the estimate of up to one trillion rand ($57bn) of state funds that was embezzled by a cabal clustered around his predecessor, Jacob Zuma.</p>
<p>Three of the country&rsquo;s wealthiest families, both white and black , pledged a billion rand ($54 million each toward the fight against coronavirus. This promising cross-racial cooperation unraveled almost immediately. The day after the lockdown announcement, a leaked document from the ministry overseeing the disbursement of emergency assistance to small businesses proposed guidelines specifying that only companies with 51% black ownership would be eligible for aid.</p>
<p>Business owners panicked as Small Business Development (SBD) Minister Khumbudzo Ntshavheni tried to dismiss the document as &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; and her department said it was simply a &ldquo;draft&rdquo; document</p>
<p>After allegations of racism, came an announcement many interpreted as xenophobic. Minister Ntshavheni announced that only South African-owned and managed spaza shops &ndash; the small grocery stores where most black township dwellers get their provisions &ndash; would be allowed to operate during the lockdown. Subsequent attempts at damage control did little to reduce public skepticism &ndash; or confusion. On the first day of the lockdown, police in the coastal city Port Elizabeth forcibly shut immigrant-owned shops in a Port Elizabeth neighborhood, pepper-spraying their customers. The station commanders, according to media reports, told the chairperson of a Somali community organization that the instructions had come directly from the Small Business Development minister.</p>
<p>The gap between the conciliatory Ramaphosa and his more confrontational security ministers is especially marked. &ldquo;This is not a moment for skop en donder. This is not a moment for skiet en donder,&rdquo; the president &mdash; echoing the threatening &ldquo;kick, shoot and beat&rdquo; Afrikaans phrase popular among the securocrats of the apartheid regime &ndash; told soldiers at a military base near Johannesburg before the lockdown.</p>
<p>Police and military didn&rsquo;t seem to get the message. On Saturday, security forces fired rubber bullets at shoppers queueing outside a Johannesburg supermarket for not maintaining the required safe distance between one another. On another occasion, they blasted shoppers with a water cannon. Unverified video footage shows soldiers emptying out alcohol and there are reports of assaults on travelers. Just four days into the lockdown, the Independent Police Investigative Directorate said it was investigating three cases of murder against officers who&rsquo;d allegedly used excessive force.</p>
<p>In another show of muscle-flexing, Police Minister Bheki Cele seemingly arbitrarily overruled Health Minister Zweli Mkhize&rsquo;s earlier statement that people could exercise outside and walk their dogs once a day if they maintained social distance.</p>

<p>No government is immune to mixed messaging as ministers grapple with an existential crisis. Nevertheless, the scale and tone of the dissonance within the Ramaphosa administration seems to indicate that even after two years in power he has not yet been able to fully assert his authority over the Zuma-supporting remnants in his cabinet.
