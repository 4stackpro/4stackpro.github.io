The popularity of baking has surged during the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>With Easter arriving this weekend, La Luna chef Adrian Richardson has shared two of his recipes for hot cross buns, to keep you busy at home this long weekend!</p>
<p>The recipes are of differing difficulty levels, so there’s something everyone can tackle!</p>
<p>Richo’s quick and easy hot cross buns</p>
<p>This is a quick, no yeast recipe that requires no proving, make them and bake straight away!</p>
<p>You can add chocolate chips or any fruit you like.</p>
<p>If you don’t have any self-raising flour, you can make your own; just put 2 teaspoon of baking powder with each cup of plain flour.</p>
<p>To make the dough</p>
<p>4 cups self-raising flour</p>
<p>1/3 cup caster sugar</p>
<p>1 tsp baking powder</p>
<p>2 cups cream</p>
<p>¼ cup milk</p>
<p>½ tsp cinnamon</p>
<p>1-tab cocoa or drinking chocolate</p>
<p>½ cup currants (raisins, mixed peel or chocolate chips all work fine)</p>
<p>To make the crosses</p>
<p>1 cup flour mixed with 1/2 cup of water, mix until you have a paste. Place in piping bag (a zip lock bag with the corner cut out works fine).</p>
<p>Pre-heat oven to 200°C</p>
<p>Place all ingredients into a bowl and gently mix until all is combined.</p>
<p>Turn out onto a lightly floured bench.</p>
<p>Roll into 12 balls (60 grams each), be careful not to work the dough too much.</p>
<p>Line a baking dish or tray with baking paper (a cake tin is fine).</p>
<p>Place balls into the dish, leaving a 1 centimetre gap between each one.</p>
<p>Bake in a pre-heated oven for 10 minutes then take out and pipe flour mix on top of buns.</p>
<p>Bake for a further 25 mins until lightly brown.</p>
<p>When slightly cooled, brush with warm honey or jam to glaze.</p>
<p>Eat with lashings of butter and jam.</p>
<p>Richo’s hot cross buns for baking experts</p>
<p>Ingredients</p>
<p>2 tsp. dried yeast</p>
<p>½ cup water, room temperature</p>
<p>1 cup milk, room temperature</p>
<p>75g butter, melted</p>
<p>1 egg, lightly beaten</p>
<p>½ tsp. ground cinnamon</p>
<p>½ tsp. allspice</p>
<p>¼ tsp ground cloves</p>
<p>½ tsp ground nutmeg</p>
<p>4 cups plain flour, plus extra, if necessary</p>
<p>1 ½ mixed dried fruit (sultanas, currants, raisins and mixed peel)</p>
<p>¼ honey</p>
<p>Crosses</p>
<p>⅓ cup plain flour</p>
<p>⅓ cup water</p>
<p>Method</p>
<p>In a small bowl, combine a large pinch of the sugar with water, then sprinkle yeast over it. Stand for 7 minutes or until it activates and becomes foamy. Combine yeast mixture in a large bowl with the milk, butter and egg and stir well.</p>
<p>Add flour, spices, dried fruit then stir until combined and a coarse dough forms. Turn out onto lightly-floured surface then, knead dough for 5 mins or until smooth and elastic, adding a little more flour if dough is sticky. Take care not to add too much extra flour or buns will be heavy.</p>
<p>Place dough in a large, greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap and leave for 40 min in a warm place. Turn dough out onto a lightly-floured surface, pat into a rough round shape, then cut into 12 even-sized pieces with a large, sharp knife. Roll each piece into a ball then place, on a greased tray. Cover loosely with a kitchen towel and prove for another 10 minutes.</p>
<p>For crosses, combine ingredients in small bowl and stir until smooth and combined. Pipe a cross shape over the top of each bun. Bake for 40 minutes, or until golden and risen, then turn out onto a wire rack and allow to cool. For glaze, heat ¼ cup of honey in saucepan, then brush mixture over top of buns.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-make-hot-cross-buns-at-home-as-you-spend-the-easter-holidays-in-lockdown">How to make hot cross buns at home as you spend the Easter holidays in lockdown</h3>
<p><img src="https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Bread-Ahead-1040-bc7e-e1586355248106_1586420126.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;crop=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
The Bread Ahead hot cross buns (Picture: iona Kong/Bread Ahead)</p>
<p>Easter is almost here but this year is very different to what we’re used to.</p>
<p>There won’t be any big outdoor Easter egg hunts this year as we’re all in lockdown.</p>
<p>And if you want to have some delicious Easter sweet treats, but don’t want to make a trip the shop, you can try to make your own.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, we showed you how to make your own Easter eggs and now we bring you a recipe for hot cross buns, from Borough Market baking masters Bread Ahead.</p>
<p>Yes, you can probably pick some up alongside your essential shop but with lots of people in a baking mood, now is the time to try it yourself.</p>
<p>You do need quite a few ingredients for these rich doughy treats but with shops restocking now, it might be easier to get them now.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Have a good hunt in your spice cupboard to add what you can to the mix. Lots of the ingredients are things that keep for a long time so hopefully, you have them around.</p>
<p>This recipe adds traditional fruit to the dough but you can use the base dough and add something else if you want to. The cross is made made separately and the glaze gives them that traditional shine.</p>
<p>Bread Ahead will be baking these live on Instagram on Friday so follow along if you need some guidance.</p>
<p>This recipe makes 12 but if you have some leftovers, you can use them to make this hot cross bun bread and butter pudding.</p>
<p>Ingredients</p>
<p>Makes 12</p>
<p>250g strong white bread flour</p>
<p>3g salt</p>
<p>40g caster sugar</p>
<p>6g mixed spice</p>
<p>3g nutmeg</p>
<p>30g unsalted butter</p>
<p>40g sultanas</p>
<p>25g mixed peel</p>
<p>30g peeled, cored and diced apple</p>
<p>8g fresh yeast (or 4g dried yeast)</p>
<p>140g milk</p>
<p>For the cross</p>
<p>100g flour</p>
<p>a pinch of caster sugar</p>
<p>a pinch of fine sea salt</p>
<p>The glaze</p>
<p>100g caster sugar</p>
<p>50ml lemon juice</p>
<p>100g water</p>
<p>Method to make hot cross buns</p>
<p>In a bowl place all the dry ingredients. Rub in the butter to form a sandy consistency.</p>
<p>Mix together the yeast and milk, add to the dry ingredients and fold till combined.</p>
<p>Turn out your dough on to the work surface and knead your dough, hold onto your dough with one hand and with the other hand stretch and fold your dough for around five minutes until the dough is nice and smooth.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Stretch out your dough into a pizza shape and add your fruit combination in the centre, fold over your dough into a Cornish pasty shape covering your fruit.</p>
<p>Gently start to roll and fold your dough till the fruits are evenly distributed, once distributed place the dough in a bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave at room temperature for one hour or until doubled in size.</p>
<p>Line a baking tray with baking paper. Place the mixture on a lightly floured surface and cut into 65g pieces. Roll each one into a smooth ball and place on the baking tray, leave plenty of room as they will spread out. Cover with clingfilm and leave to double in size.</p>
<p>While the buns are proving make the cross mixture and the glaze. Mix together the flour, sugar, salt and 100g water until you have a smooth paste, pour into a piping bag with a 4mm plain nozzle.</p>
<p>In a small pan place the sugar, lemon juice and 100g water, bring to the boil and simmer until the temperature reaches 105C, or about 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Pre heat the oven to 180C/Fan 160C/Gas 4</p>
<p>Once the buns have proved, pipe a cross on the top of each one and bake for 14-15 minutes, until golden brown. Remove from the oven and place on a cooling rack. After 2 minutes, brush with the bun glaze.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Serve warm with plenty of butter.</p>
<p>Happy baking!</p>
