Countdown presenter Rachel Riley and former chief rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks were among the A-listers to back an online Holocaust remembrance project led by March of the Living.</p>
<p>They joined the Israeli president Reuven Rivlin in leaving their own personal message on a website launched today, which can be accessed on <a href="https://nevermeansnever.motl.org/">https://nevermeansnever.motl.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Organisers were forced to postpone the annual 1.9 mile-trek from Auschwitz to Birkenau over safety concerns during the pandemic. The event draws thousands of participants from around the world each year, including survivors, students and educators.</p>

<p>The project, inspired by the theme “NeverMeansNever”, allows online users to leave a message on the portal in the form of a “virtual plaque”.</p>
<p>President Rivlin, who was the first to take part, urged “the nations of the world” to stand together against antisemitism, racism and extremism.</p>
<p>“Together, for the protection of democratic values and human dignity. This is the mission of our time. This is our challenge. If we can unite around these things, then we can rise to the challenge,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Riley pledged to honour survivors “by ensuring that their stories will continue to be told, even when they are no longer able to tell them.”</p>
<p>She added: “I promise to advocate Holocaust education, to inoculate as many people as possible from the virus that is antisemitism.”</p>
<p>In his message, Rabbi Sacks wrote: “There are cultures that forget the past. There are cultures that are held captive by the past. Jews do neither.</p>
<p>“We carry the past with us as we will carry the memory of the Shoah with us for as long as the Jewish people exist. Those fragments of memory help make us who we are. Jews ‘choose life’.”</p>
<p>Other participants included the former head of the Jewish Agency for Israel Natan Sharansky and its current chairman Isaac Herzog.</p>
<p>“This year, for the first time in 32 years, we are not able to march in Auschwitz-Birkenau, but that will not stop us,” said Dr. Shmuel Rosenman, world chair of March of the Living, before vowing to continue to educate the next generation.</p>
<p>The organisation’s president Phyllis Greenberg Heideman said the virtual campaign was “an important opportunity for people across the world not only to remember the Holocaust but to commit to building a better future for all members of the human family.”

Rachel Riley and Pasha Kovalev made sure they got their daily exercise in (Picture: GoffPhotos.com)</p>
<p>Rachel Riley and Pasha Kovalev have been making the most of their daily walk under the lockdown rules in the UK, taking their baby daughter out for some fresh air.</p>
<p>The couple were seen practising their social distancing as they walked along together, staying far away from everyone else.</p>
<p>Rachel strapped baby Maven to her front in a leopard print sling as the couple donned sunglasses in the beautiful spring sunshine.</p>
<p>The streets were largely empty due to the current coronavirus lockdown, with everyone being instructed to stay in their homes except for vital journeys to buy food, daily exercise and trips to and from work for key workers.</p>
<p>Thankfully Rachel had baby Maven in the sling and not her hot water bottle, as she recently revealed that she had confused the two.</p>
<p>She confessed on Countdown: ‘When Mave was first born and she was crying and it was the middle of the night – and you’re desperately trying to get her to sleep.</p>

<p>‘And then I realised I wasn’t holding her, I was holding my hot water bottle! Trying to get that off to sleep – I was patting its head.</p>
<p>‘It was just a furry hot water bottle and she was still in her cot.’</p>
<p>She added that the mix-up was due to sleep deprivation having just had a newborn, adding: ‘Every new parent knows that, but a furry hot water bottle just wouldn’t go to sleep!’</p>
<p>Thankfully Rachel brought the baby and not her hot water bottle (Picture: GoffPhotos.com)</p>
<p>Pasha and Rachel recently celebrated their baby turning three months old, with Rachel telling her followers: ‘The little one is three months old today.</p>
<p>‘It’s true what they say, it’s hard to remember life before her and the cliché is true – she’s the best thing we’ve ever done.’</p>

<h3 id="rachel-riley-enjoys-some-fresh-air-and-exercise-as-she-takes-baby-daughter-maven-aria-for-a-stroll">Rachel Riley enjoys some fresh air and exercise as she takes baby daughter Maven Aria for a stroll</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/06/19/26879004-0-image-a-15_1586198835290.jpg" alt="img">
She&rsquo;s been revelling in the joys of motherhood since welcoming her daughter, Maven Aria, into the world in December with husband Pasha Kovalev.</p>
<p>And Rachel Riley, 34, was spotted enjoying some fresh air and exercise on Monday, when she took her offspring out for a stroll through the streets of central London.</p>
<p>The Countdown star looked casually cool as she pushed Maven&rsquo;s floral pram, donning a plunging black top with indigo jeans and a chunky-knit cream cardigan.</p>
<p>Fresh air: Rachel Riley, 34, was spotted enjoying some fresh air and exercise on Monday, when she took her daughter Maven Aria out for a stroll through the streets of central London</p>
<p>Stepping out in white running shoes, the TV personality rounded out her ensemble with oversized sunglasses and a yellow statement necklace.</p>
<p>Tying her golden locks back in a wavy bun, the star let her natural beauty shine through by keeping her makeup minimal.</p>
<p>Rachel&rsquo;s outing comes days after she revealed that at one point she was so exhausted cradling her baby daughter, she didn&rsquo;t realise she was actually cuddling a hot water bottle.</p>
<p>Casually cool: The Countdown star looked casually cool as she pushed Maven&rsquo;s floral pram, donning a plunging black top with indigo jeans and a chunky-knit cream cardigan</p>
<p>The presenter made the hilarious confession during an episode of Countdown, explaining that didn&rsquo;t even realise her daughter was still crying in her cot.</p>
<p>As Rachel chatted to host Nick Hewer about whether they&rsquo;ve ever been the victim of a trick or prank, she admitted she&rsquo;d once tricked herself.</p>
<p>Explaining that in the midst of a sleep-deprived haze, she was cradling her baby daughter to try and get her to sleep, and had no idea that the head of hair she thought she was stroking was actually a furry hot water bottle.</p>
<p>She said: &lsquo;I have tricked myself. When Mav was first born and she was crying and it was the middle of the night, and you&rsquo;re desperately trying to get her to sleep and I was shushing her and thought &lsquo;&lsquo;there&rsquo;s something wrong why isn&rsquo;t she going to sleep?&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Oops! The mathematics whizz revealed the hilarious moment she mistook a hot water bottle for her baby daughter Maven Aria during an episode of Countdown last week</p>
<p>Rachel then revealed: &lsquo;And then I realised I wasn&rsquo;t holding her in bed I was holding my hot water bottle,&rsquo; sparking laughter from host Nick and the audience.</p>
<p>She added: &lsquo;And trying to get that off to sleep and I was patting its head, it was just a furry hot water bottle and she was still in her cot.</p>
<p>As Nick said she must have been &lsquo;so tired,&rsquo; Rachel added: &lsquo;Every new parent knows that, but a furry hot water bottle just wouldn&rsquo;t go to sleep!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rachel returned to Countdown last week, following her maternity leave, with the star even bringing her baby daughter onto the set for a visit with dad Pasha Kovalev.</p>
<p>Blunder: The presenter explained that she was so exhausted caring for her newborn daughter, after spending many minutes trying to cradle her to sleep</p>
<p>Sweet: Last Monday&rsquo;s episode of Countdown was Rachel&rsquo;s first following her maternity leave, with the star even bringing her baby daughter onto the set for a visit with dad Pasha Kovalev</p>
<p>The star also marked the milestone episode, which was filmed a month ago, with a sweet Instagram snap taken on the set visit.</p>
<p>Rachel and husband Pasha welcomed Maven in December, with Rachel returning to filming 11 weeks later.</p>
<p>As the episode opened, host Nick Hewer asked Rachel how her weekend was, to which she quipped: &lsquo;I have a bit of a busy weekend, I made a new friend, quite literally, do you want to meet her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Pasha then walked on set holding Maven to a round of applause, before Rachel explained the meaning of her daughter&rsquo;s name as &lsquo;one who understands&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Rachel then joked &lsquo;so yeah bit of a busy weekend, it feels like two and a half months have passed,&rsquo; referencing her maternity leave.</p>
<p>New addition: Rachel and husband Pasha welcomed Maven in December, with Rachel returning to filming 11 weeks later</p>
<p>Countdown took a break from filming during Rachel&rsquo;s leave, but co-star Susie Dent previously revealed they had &lsquo;banked up a lot of episodes before she went, so we have a lot in the can to keep us going while she’s been off&rsquo;.</p>
<p>After cooing over Maven during the episode, Nick told Rachel: &lsquo;She&rsquo;s absolutely adorable but now it&rsquo;s time for mum to do a bit of work&rsquo;, as the new mum admitted: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got to stop swaying!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rachel also shared an Instagram snap from Maven&rsquo;s first day on set on the same day, writing: &lsquo;Introducing our newest Countdown viewer on my first show back filmed post-baby today! Tune in 2.10pm on @channel4 if you want to meet her #newbaby #backtowork #tvdebut&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Channel 4 announced last month that filming for Countdown would continue amid the coronavirus lockdown – but without a studio audience.</p>
<p>Family: Pasha then walked on set holding Maven to a round of applause, before Rachel explained the meaning of her daughter&rsquo;s name as &lsquo;one who understands&rsquo;</p>
<p>Absolutely adorable: After cooing over Maven, Countdown host Nick Hewer told Rachel, &lsquo;She&rsquo;s absolutely adorable but now it&rsquo;s time for mum to do a bit of work&rsquo;</p>
<p>Rachel took to Twitter to share a sweet video of her daughter Maven competing against her toy Bunny in a bid to &lsquo;convince&rsquo; bosses she could work from home.</p>
<p>The mathematics whizz said: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Maven versus Bunny in the first Countdown numbers game. Mav what would you like?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Two from the top fantastic? You have 100, 50 and four little ones… 7,8, 7 and 1 and your target&hellip; 391.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your 30 seconds start now&rsquo;, Rachel said before pressing a baby toy which played music.</p>
<p>Rachel captioned the video: &lsquo;How to convince the @C4Countdown @Channel4 bosses it’d be fine to work from home.&rsquo;
