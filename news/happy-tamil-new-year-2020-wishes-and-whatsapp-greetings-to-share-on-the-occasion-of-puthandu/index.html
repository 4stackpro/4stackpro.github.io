Puthandu or Tamil New Year | Photo Credit: BCCL</p>
<p>According to the Tamil calendar, 2020 Tamil New Year or Puthandu is on Tuesday, April 14, 2020. The festival falls on the same date of every Gregorian calendar every year.</p>
<p>There are an estimated 4.5 million Tamilians in India and the globally strewn diaspora included. Also on 14 April fall other regional New Years such as Vishu in Kerala, Poila Boishak in Bengal, and Baisakhi in Punjab, apart from several other states.</p>
<p>Here are some interesting facts about the Puthandu festival.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Tamil calendar follows a 60-year cycle. The first month of every Tamil year is called Chittirai and it commences on 14 April of the Gregorian calendar. As per that system, we are in the current 60-year-cycle that began in 1987 and will end in 2047.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine a year having a name of its own. The 2016-17 Tamil Year had a name - Dhunmuki. The 2017-18 Tamil New Year began the year named Hevilambi. 2020-21 will be called Shaarvari.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tamilians prepare for the New Year by washing the house the night before. They believe that for a new beginning, the old negativity must be thrown out first. The festival morning begins with a ritual called &lsquo;Kanni&rsquo; i.e. ‘auspicious sight’. The Pooja Room is decorated with a huge mirror and before it is placed abundant signs of prosperity such as trays laden with fruits, flowers, jewellery, currency notes and coins; basically all things that show the grace and blessings of Goddess Laxmi the giver of wealth and prosperity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is called rangoli in the rest of India is called Kollam or Kolam in Tamil Nadu. But instead of ground rock powder, Tamilians use rice powder to etch beautiful patterns in the courtyard or before their house&rsquo;s main entrance. The idea is to have ants and insects get drawn to it and gain subsistence. The ancient tradition reflects Indians&rsquo; or the Hindus&rsquo; belief that man cannot live alone, he needs to live in harmony with the world&rsquo;s creatures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vegetarian food is cooked on this day, and people either pray at home or visit temples to offer worship. Priests or family astrologers open the Panchangam (calender or almanac) and refer to horoscopes as they make predictions for the year to come.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Iniye Puthandu Vazhtukkal! We wish you all a Happy Tamil New Year!</p>
