MONETA Approved Deferred Repayments Worth 20 billion CZK, Bank&rsquo;s Clients Applied for Loans Worth 1.5 billion from the COVID II Program</p>
<p>Prague, 14 April 2020</p>
<p>During the first week from the launch of COVID II guarantee program, clients of MONETA Money Bank applied for loans worth 1.5 billion CZK. In addition, MONETA together with its Wüstenrot subsidiaries registers more than 50 thousand applications for deferral of repayments worth over 20 billion.</p>
<p>MONETA was among the first to join the government initiative to help self-employed entrepreneurs and SMEs and offered its clients financing of their operating costs with 80% state guarantee. Out of the 5 900 officially received applications more than 700 are clients of MONETA Money Bank, who applied for loans worth 1.5 bn CZK.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The guarantee program is truly in high demand among our clients, as proven by the total volume of loan applications. We are a bank focusing mainly of financing entrepreneurs and SMEs, so 1.5 billion is a very high number. We are very glad that we were able to help our clients during these difficult times,&rdquo; confirmed Jan Novotný, member of the Management Board, according to whom the bank has registered interest mainly by theself-employedentrepreneurs and small businesses, who were the main focus of the program.&ldquo;We will continue monitoring ways to help our clients and will try to help them both directly and with the support of the state,&rdquo; added Jan Novotný.</p>
<p>For the past two months, MONETA Group has been administering deferral of repayments that both households and businesses may apply for without any written confirmation. During this period, it has accepted applications of 50 thousand applicants in nominal value of 20 billion CZK. &ldquo;We are offering four- month deferral, voluntarily, of our free will, because we are trying to defend our clients against the impact of the current economic situation. We are a responsible bank ourselves,&ldquo;says Tomáš Spurný, Chairman of the Management Board of MONETA Money Bank.</p>
<p>The highest interest in deferral of repayments comes from self-employed entrepreneurs, whose applications represent 19.2% of the total bank&rsquo;s portfolio. Consumer loans are 11. %, and deferral of mortgages 8.2%.</p>
<p>The administration of deferral is free of charge, MONETA defers three monthly instalments and postpones the loan maturity accordingly. In total, the loan maturity is postponed by 4 months. The amount of the remaining annuity repayments remains unchanged with the exception of the last one, which may vary. If the loan has been arranged with insurance, it remains insured even during the deferral.</p>

<h3 id="a-sliding-share-price-has-us-looking-at-moneta-money-bank-ass-sepmonet-pe-ratio">A Sliding Share Price Has Us Looking At MONETA Money Bank, a.s.’s (SEP:MONET) P/E Ratio</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.simplywall.st/asset/industry/7012000-choice2-main-header/1585186732814" alt="img">
To the annoyance of some shareholders, MONETA Money Bank (SEP:MONET) shares are down a considerable 31% in the last month. That drop has capped off a tough year for shareholders, with the share price down 33% in that time.</p>
<p>Assuming nothing else has changed, a lower share price makes a stock more attractive to potential buyers. In the long term, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, but in the short term prices bounce around in response to short term factors (which are not always obvious). The implication here is that long term investors have an opportunity when expectations of a company are too low. Perhaps the simplest way to get a read on investors’ expectations of a business is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). Investors have optimistic expectations of companies with higher P/E ratios, compared to companies with lower P/E ratios.</p>
<p>Check out our latest analysis for MONETA Money Bank</p>
<p>How Does MONETA Money Bank’s P/E Ratio Compare To Its Peers?</p>
<p>MONETA Money Bank has a P/E ratio of 6.84. The image below shows that MONETA Money Bank has a P/E ratio that is roughly in line with the banks industry average (6.8).</p>
<p>MONETA Money Bank’s P/E tells us that market participants think its prospects are roughly in line with its industry. The company could surprise by performing better than average, in the future. Further research into factors such as insider buying and selling, could help you form your own view on whether that is likely.</p>
<p>How Growth Rates Impact P/E Ratios</p>
<p>If earnings fall then in the future the ‘E’ will be lower. That means unless the share price falls, the P/E will increase in a few years. Then, a higher P/E might scare off shareholders, pushing the share price down.</p>
<p>MONETA Money Bank saw earnings per share decrease by 4.3% last year.</p>
<p>Don’t Forget: The P/E Does Not Account For Debt or Bank Deposits</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.</p>
<p>Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.</p>
<p>How Does MONETA Money Bank’s Debt Impact Its P/E Ratio?</p>
<p>MONETA Money Bank has net cash of Kč13b. This is fairly high at 49% of its market capitalization. That might mean balance sheet strength is important to the business, but should also help push the P/E a bit higher than it would otherwise be.</p>
<p>The Verdict On MONETA Money Bank’s P/E Ratio</p>
<p>MONETA Money Bank trades on a P/E ratio of 6.8, which is below the CZ market average of 10.5. The recent drop in earnings per share would make investors cautious, the healthy balance sheet means the company retains potential for future growth. If that occurs, the current low P/E could prove to be temporary. Given MONETA Money Bank’s P/E ratio has declined from 9.9 to 6.8 in the last month, we know for sure that the market is more worried about the business today, than it was back then. For those who prefer to invest with the flow of momentum, that might be a bad sign, but for deep value investors this stock might justify some research.</p>
<p>Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong. As value investor Benjamin Graham famously said, ‘In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine. So this free visualization of the analyst consensus on future earnings could help you make the right decision about whether to buy, sell, or hold.</p>
