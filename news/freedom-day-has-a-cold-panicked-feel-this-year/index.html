Freedom Day 2020 feels different as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has brought stark, lingering inequalities to the forefront. The public holiday that was my favourite while growing up is not the same anymore.</p>
<p>My favourite holiday growing up was Freedom Day — the countless images of snaked lines of hope, reflections of people who have the same skin colour as me, the rainbow pictures of a new hopeful South Africa and the stories my mother would tell me about running away from police in Manenberg in 1976, trying to protest for a better future. If you’d asked her, in that tiny makeshift voting station in Delft in 1994, if she knew 26 years later people would be arguing over roast chicken she’d probably have thought you were smoking something.</p>
<p>But 26 years later, in 2020, the build-up to Freedom Day doesn’t feel as free as it should. No playing of countless clips from our freedom fighters, no images of that glorious day. Where are the images of Mandela, Mbeki and De Klerk, where are the symbols of a new South Africa? Freedom Day 2020 feels cold and panicked as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The numbers of those affected are growing daily.</p>
<p>The brutality of the police, the general lack of thought and appreciation for human rights makes this Freedom Day feel like a slap in the face for every freedom fighter — dead, alive or struggling to cope with the psychological effects of apartheid. But, most importantly, this Freedom Day exposes what a lot of people have already known: Not much has changed for poor black South Africans. While people are complaining about Woollies cooked chicken, black women — mothers — are being arrested for trying to earn a living during this pandemic. Black men are getting assaulted and killed by police and the SANDF for being indoors; in their own homes they are murdered by a democratic police force.</p>
<p>As a country, collectively, we see images of people — often black, working-class people — who are treated differently to white people. Have the police beaten up a white man in Sandton who was in his living room- like they did Collins Xhosa in Alex? If the Green Point woman who tried to run away from police while running her dog — which is illegal under the current lockdown regulations — had been black she would probably have been arrested, tear-gassed and thrown in the back of a police vehicle. Depending on the mood of the officers, she might even have been shot in the back by a rubber bullet.</p>
<p>While we can argue over Bheki Cele and his dictatorial tendencies over walking dogs, we need to ask this Freedom Day: How equal are we? How equal is it that a white man can walk in the leafy suburbs without qualms, but when a black man goes to the shops to buy essential items he will get his goods confiscated, his money stolen by the police or worse, get assaulted and humiliated by the very same police who are supposed to be protectors?</p>
<p>This Freedom Day, I am reminded that, since 27 April 1994, black South Africans might have gained small victories but, when push comes to shove, there is a lot to be done. We as black people in South Africa, our own country, our home, need to be treated equally — within the police service, within government, in the private sector and within the economy.</p>
<p>After this pandemic — perhaps next Freedom Day — hopefully we will think back to this moment and recall that something good came of it and we gained a bit more equality. DM</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/uploads/YM-humanrights-reflections-Yanga.jpg" alt="img">

<p>When people thronged to vote for the first time, back in 1994, what were they expecting?</p>
<p>About a month ago, I wrote a reflection piece for Human Rights Day, looking at how little progress had been made in terms of righting the wrongs and injustices of the past in South Africa.</p>
<p>Then, following a discussion with a friend about some of the failures of our democratically elected government thus far, I started to contemplate the realistic expectations of black South Africans when they went out to vote on 27 April 1994.</p>
<p>Those people who stood in voting queues as long as the reticulated python, What did they think would realistically happen with black people becoming free? We need to keep in mind the fact that South Africa was, and still is, a developing, or “third world”, country.</p>
<p>After decades of systematic oppression, were they hopeful the cross they put on that ballot paper would right the wrongs of the past instantaneously? If not, how long did they expect it would take?</p>
<p>After all, the country had been controlled by a minority for the longest time. And this minority primarily developed areas which they occupied, leaving the homelands and townships largely underdeveloped during the almost five decades of apartheid.</p>
<p>Granted, post 1994, black South Africans were able to move freely around the country, they could fraternise with whomever they wished, they could go to school wherever they wanted, they could pursue whatever career they wished to pursue; these doors were unlocked.</p>
<p>However, the systematically laid-out foundations of apartheid mostly remained intact. Especially the financial ones.</p>
<p>During apartheid, there were instances of black and white people doing the same job but, because whites were “superior” under the system, it was an insult for them to earn the same as their black counterparts.</p>
<p>These differences meant that, even when apartheid was over, the starting point was not the same. White people were years ahead of other races in the country, not just financially but mentally.</p>
<p>Lest we also forget, race-based oppression in South Africa can be traced back to the arrival of the Dutch settlers in 1652. When the Dutch were done, British colonists took over from the 18th century until 1910. This ultimately culminated in the system of apartheid.</p>
<p>So, again, the question arises: after centuries of oppression did the oppressed think all their problems would disappear because they now had someone who looked like them as the leader of the country?</p>
<p>Granted, the post-apartheid leadership has failed South Africans as well, with greedy politicians “rewarding” themselves for being part of the liberation struggle – at the expense of those who had already suffered greatly in the past. And 26 years after liberation, South Africa is still considered one of the most unequal societies in the world.</p>
<p>The distrust between the leaders and the masses runs deep, too. Just a few days ago, when President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a R500-billion stimulus package, in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, jokes went around on social media that a huge chunk of that money would end up in the pockets of greedy comrades and not in the hands of those that desperately needed it.</p>
<p>It will take a few more generations, as well as some commendable and selfless leadership, to right the inequalities – if it is even possible. For now, we can only dream and fantasise about what a truly free and equal South Africa would look like. DM</p>

<h3 id="freedom-day-is-here-it-is-time-to-reflect-and-make-up">Freedom Day is here, it is time to reflect and make up&hellip;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen-child/images/favicon.png" alt="img">
Freedom Day has come. On Monday we commemorate twenty-six years since South Africans took final steps to end the long walk to freedom in that historic election of 27 April 1994. Freedom came. Freedom is far away. For some, the long walk to freedom has just begun, again.</p>
<p>On 15 March 2020, President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a state of disaster, announcing a series of measures to prevent the catastrophe of the Covid-19 pandemic, at the core of which was locking and shutting down the country to effectively implement social distancing, flatten the curve, care for the sick and conduct mass testing.</p>
<p>This, just as another finance buffoon stripped South Africa of its investment rating, downgrading government bonds to junk status in the midst of a global crisis where big economies such as France and the US are sliding into recession. But this is a circus that we have become accustomed to playing, even priding ourselves as top performers, and therefore should not be complaining. This rating game is part of how we celebrate freedom and have used it to distinguish our exceptionalism from everyone else. We compete for the numbers. It might look like nonsense, but it is not inconsequential.</p>
<p>We might be ranked the most unequal country in the world, but South Africa is currently Africa’s second wealthiest country with a GDP of over USD358-billion, boasts three of the top 10 billionaires in Africa, has the highest concentration of ultra-high net worth individuals (net worth greater than USD30-million) on the continent and is home to 109,368 of Africa’s 302,360 high net worth individuals (net worth greater than USD1-million).</p>
<p>In regular times, downgrading to junk status would profoundly impact us negatively. Through higher taxes and scaled-down government services, the rand would grow weaker, increasing the cost of basic necessities such as petrol, bread, and probably your alcohol, cigarettes and weed. It would mean bad news for banks and their customers, especially as they would have to offer higher interest rates. But these are not normal times, and a good actor should know when to come on stage.</p>
<p>The year 2019 was a tough year for South Africans. Statistics from StatsSA show that the economy contracted by 3.2% in the first quarter of 2019, grew by 3.1% in the second quarter, and then shrunk by 0.6% in the third quarter. At 29.1%, we recorded the highest unemployment rate since the measuring of joblessness in 2008.</p>
<p>With an estimated 25 million active credit consumers in South Africa, 10 million were behind on payments. And household debt reached USD154.5-billion, a shocking 44.7% of the nation’s nominal GDP.</p>
<p>Yet South African Airways and other state-owned enterprises continued asking for massive bailouts from the government. Ironically, SAA, branded as the gateway to Africa, closed many of its routes across the continent and globally, recently even domestic routes, as it was subjected to business rescue.</p>
<p>At year-end, we all had to create space to add a new useful app to our phones to more efficiently help the electricity corporation Eskom to effectively plan its disruptions. Load shedding entered our vocabularies, redefined our routines and changed our relationship with energy and its related technologies. Things happen when you can be load shed for up to 8 stages.</p>
<p>Coupled with the economic woes, more worrying were the 2018/2019 annual crime statistics that revealed that we were growing increasingly more violent against each other. Murders increased by 3.4% to just over 21,000, with over 60% of all murders committed over the weekend between 9pm and 3am. So much for the weekend. Goodbye, sweet dreams.</p>
<p>According to the statistics 2,771 women, and 1,014 children were murdered during this period. With a homicide rate averaging 58 per day, it is clear that while freedom has come, we are officially in a civil war. Police Minister Bheki Cele noted in his report: “There are a very high number of people who are murdered by people they know.” Freedom came, but we turned some of our most intimate encounters into traumatic relationships.</p>
<p>We continued to use sex to violate, batter and destroy bodies, lives and spirits in what has now become our epidemic. In fact, some organisations rank us amongst the world’s rape epicentres. Some report that we may be its capital. Approximately 52,420 incidences of sexual crimes were reported in the preceding period: 36,597 against women and shockingly 24,387 were against children.</p>
<p>Last year 19-year-old University of Cape Town student Uyinene Mrwetyana was brutally raped and murdered by a post office worker – a brother, an uncle, an elder, someone entrusted with the responsibility of care – in a seemingly safe public space. And this is just one of the many brutalities in which our intimate relationships are confined. The toxicity of our masculinities has reached immeasurable proportions. We are special. Actually, we are a pathology.</p>
<p>Over this past year, we continued our notoriety for xenophobia. No, Afrophobia, our contribution to the English vocabulary. At various times during the year, there were sporadic “attacks on, and looting of, foreign-owned shops, leading to retaliatory attacks against South African businesses” in different parts of the continent. The tensions forced Nigeria to organise and repatriate some of its citizens. We were forced to send an envoy to some African countries to apologise for these criminal acts; and emphasise that South Africa is home to all and not xenophobic.</p>
<p>But there is hope. Freedom has come, again.</p>
<p>In 2019 we elected South Africa’s sixth President, Cyril Ramaphosa. Siya Kolosi captained South Africa to an astounding victory at the Rugby World Cup in Japan, bringing home the trophy with the Springboks and reuniting the “Rainbow Nation” with the nostalgic memories of 1995. The Student Village “Student Spend” survey also showed that South Africa’s new “Gen Z is characterised by a tremendous entrepreneurial spirit, founded on hope and a sense of self-created liberation. Many of whom have started businesses at a young age, they no longer save to spend, they save to re-invest.” To top it off Zozibini Tunzi won Miss Universe. We are the world. Right? Freedom has come. The time is now.</p>
<p>On April 9, the president announced the decision by the National Coronavirus Command Council, after careful assessment, “to extend the nation-wide lockdown by a further two weeks beyond the initial 21 days” thereby keeping most of the lockdown measures “in force until the end of April”. This means that on Freedom Day 2020, we shall be locked down in our various corners without the traditional alcohol that we love to celebrate with, and the privilege of physical conviviality and debauchery. But freedom is a faraway thought for those who fell victim to the 87,000 cases of gender-based violence reported after week one of the lockdown.</p>
<p>On the flipside, the social support deployed during this lockdown shows that it is possible to create a more caring state, if we are willing and if as a society and political community we are grounded in solidarity. The government has for the first time provided a basic survival buffer, even if insufficient, for the unemployed across the board. The idea that such support and solidarity would create dependency and avoidance of work is radically shifting.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges and obvious consequences of militarisation, and the devastating economic consequences of interdicting alcohol and cigarettes, the country has seen a dramatic drop in reported “serious and violent crimes” such as murder, rape and assault cases, and trio crimes (i.e. robberies and vehicle hijackings).</p>
<p>The government’s Covid-19 Solidarity Fund raised more than R500-million in donations after the first week following its announcement. Other related funds such as the eMedia Covid-19 relief fund had raised close to R4-million in the first 48 hours of its launch. Just the other day, the President announced an additional R500-billion planned injection into the economy and social support, a record 10% of GDP. These are extraordinary times, with an extraordinary budget. Who would have thought we would live to see such extraordinary attention to the needs of the vulnerable.</p>
<p>Freedom Day is here, but freedom, as we know it, is gone. We are left with one last thing: the freedom to reflect. But how should we use this freedom?</p>
<p>In response to a question by a BBC reporter in the late Nineties seeking to understand what he meant by coming out of prison a different man, and also what was specific about life in Robben Island that changed him, Nelson Mandela said: “Well you know, the fact that you could sit alone and think, gave us a wonderful opportunity to change ourselves… your behaviour. I felt quite ashamed because I became busy with politics and with law, and I forgot the people who were very kind to me when I arrived in Johannesburg, and I said if I ever get a chance of coming out, as I was sure I would eventually no matter how long, I would make up for the omissions I made.”</p>
<p>It has been 26 years since we inaugurated Freedom Day on 27 April 1994. It is time to reflect and make up for our omissions. Those who insist that we must absolutely return to normal and continue with business as usual must ask themselves if our past omissions are what they want to return to, or should we free ourselves by imagining a new social contract.
