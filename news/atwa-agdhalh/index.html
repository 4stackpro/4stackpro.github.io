<h3 id="luto-por-la-muerte-de-esta-querida-reina-cómo-murió-ibidun-ighodalo">&ldquo;Luto por la muerte de esta querida reina: ¿cómo murió Ibidun Ighodalo?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ahoramismo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-52857332-1.jpg?quality=65&amp;strip=all&amp;w=780" alt="img">
Ibidun Ighodalo, ex reina de belleza y esposa del pastor nigeriano Ituah Ighodalo, murió este 14 de junio a la edad de 39 años, según informó el Daily Post.</p>
<p>La querida ex reina falleció de un ataque al corazón temprano en la mañana en un hotel en Port Harcourt, según Pulse.</p>
<p>Ighodalo había viajado el 12 de junio a Rivers States para ayudar con un proyecto para construir centros de aislamiento para pacientes con COVID-19, según destacó el Daily Post.</p>
<p>Su muerte ha conmocionado y entristecido a muchos en Nigeria. El presidente nigeriano Muhammadu Buhari ha expresado tristeza y conmoción, según el Daily Post. “Por favor acepte mis condolencias. Que Dios le dé la fortaleza para soportar la pérdida y les de fortalezca en este momento difícil”, dijo el mandatario.</p>
<p>Ighodalo era la esposa de Ituah Ighodalo, quien es un reconocido pastor popular de la Iglesia Trinity House. Su familia ha publicado una declaración, según el Daily Post:</p>
<p>“Las familias Ighodalo y Olaleye Ajayi están profundamente tristes al anunciar la repentina pérdida de nuestra amada esposa e hija, la Sra. Ibidunni Ituah-Ighodalo, quien falleció en las primeras horas de hoy”, dijeron.</p>
<p>Ighodalo hubiese cumplido 40 años el 19 de julio, según informó Pulse.</p>
<p>Según su biografía de Trinity House, Ighodalo obtuvo el equivalente a un título en microbiología de la Universidad de Lagos, recibió capacitación en administración de empresas de la Escuela de Negocios de Lagos y fue miembro del Instituto Nacional de Marketing de Nigeria.</p>
<p>Mientras estaba en la Universidad de Lagos, Ighodalo, conocida entonces como Ibidun Ajayi, ganó el concurso de belleza Miss Lux a la edad de 18 años, informó Pulse.</p>
<p>Ighodalo también fue planificadora de eventos para Elizabeth R, según Pulse.</p>
<p>Ighodalo fue particularmente conocida por su trabajo al frente de la Fundación Ibidunni Ighodalo sin fines de lucro, que ayuda a las parejas infértiles a tener hijos:</p>
<p>“Ella era una amable ayudante y solucionadora de problemas, ungida para brindar curación emocional a las mujeres y familias que sufren, a través de la enseñanza y la predicación de la palabra de Dios. Ella está a la vanguardia de dar esperanza a las familias que esperan en Dios el fruto del útero, con la creencia de que la crianza de los hijos no tiene que ser solo a través de una concepción natural… A través de esta organización, varias familias han nacido y restablecido la esperanza a medida que la fundación ha ayudado a financiar ciclos de FIV para ellos”, dijo la citada institución.</p>
<p>Ighodlo comenzó la fundación después de que ella luchó por tener un hijo propio, según Pulse, y se sometió a Fertilización In Vitro (FIV) 11 veces antes de adoptar a su hija, Keke. Ella también tiene otro hijo con Ituah Ighodalo.</p>
<p>Ituah Ighodalo dijo que la noticia “destrozó” su vida.</p>
<p>Ighodalo se casó con Ituah en 2007, en un movimiento controvertido que condujo al despido del pastor, que entonces era pastor de la Iglesia de Dios Cristiana Redimida y se había divorciado de su primera esposa, informó Pulse. Después de eso, comenzó Trinity House con Ighodalo a su lado.</p>
<p>Según el Daily Post, recibió la noticia de que su esposa había muerto a las 2 a.m.</p>
<p>“No tenemos control sobre la mayoría de las cosas en la vida, cómo naciste, de qué matriz vienes y cuál es tu raza … La vida es un profundo misterio, nadie tan sabio como Salomón puede decirte que entienden la vida … Va a venir un Momento en que veremos claramente como Jesús ve… Nadie tiene control sobre la vida, esta vez ayer si alguien me hubiera dicho que así seríá, habría dicho que es imposible. La vida es nada”, dijo el pastor.</p>
<p>La noticia, dijo, “destrozó (su) vida entera”.</p>

<h3 id="katsinas-peace-deal-with-bandits-lasted-only-seven-months-says-masari">&ldquo;Katsina’s Peace Deal with Bandits Lasted only Seven Months, Says Masari&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/2019/02/08162a3d-aminu-bello-masari.jpg" alt="img">
By Francis Sardauna</p>
<p>The Katsina State Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, at the weekend revealed that the peace accord his administration signed with the rampaging bandits terrorizing the state lasted for only seven months.</p>
<p>Irked by the collapse of the peace deal, he said the state government would no longer negotiate with the bandits because they had breached the agreement between them and government.</p>
<p>Masari, who was speaking in an interactive session with journalists at the Government House, lamented the resurgence of banditry and kidnapping in the state despite the peace accord.</p>
<p>Two peace deals were separately signed by the state government under the leadership of Governor Masari and the bandits. The first was on January 15, 2017 that lasted for two years, while the second took place between 4 and 9 September, 2019.</p>
<p>The agreement saw significant reduction in attacks on the state’s rural communities. But the recent resurgence in banditry attacks on Faskari, Batsari, Sabuwa, Danmusa, Dutsin-Ma, Kankara, Kurfi and Safana Local Government Areas have claimed more than 200 lives.</p>
<p>The fresh onslaught has forced thousands of residents of the affected local governments, who survived the deadly invasions, to flee their ancestral homes to the headquarters of the council areas including Katsina, the state capital.</p>
<p>Masari, at the interactive session, reiterated the role of the state government’s resolve to complement the efforts of security agencies to flush out the hoodlums rather than negotiating with them.</p>
<p>He said: “We entered into various phases of dialogue with the bandits on the prompting of the security agencies. By the time we completed, we reached an agreement on so many solutions.</p>
<p>“Even if we were not able to meet their demands 100 per cent, we were able to meet up with between 70 and 80 per cent.</p>
<p>“But the peace accord from my records, did not last for more than six to seven months, then it broke down again and that is the position we are in at the moment.”</p>
<p>The governor described the marauding bandits as being worse than wild animals in the forest, saying they kill indiscriminately without any purpose or reasons.</p>
<p>According to him, “In the forest, a lion or a tiger kills only when it is hungry and it doesn’t kill all the animals, it only kills the one it can eat at a time.</p>
<p>“But what we see here is that the bandits come to town, spray bullets, kill indiscriminately for no purpose and no reasons. How can a human being behave the way that an animal cannot even behave. That is why I say that they are worse than the animals in the forest. For me, there are no longer innocent persons in the forests.”</p>
<p>Masari said despite the peace agreement entered, the bandits, in coordinated attacks with their accomplices from Zamfara, Kaduna and other neighboring states, have continued with indiscriminate killings across the state.</p>
<p>He however said the military and police do not have adequate manpower and equipment required to operate in all the troubled spots across the six geo-political zones of the country.</p>
<p>“Even members of the Armed Forces have limited capacity in terms of the equipment available to them and the money given to them,” Masari added.</p>
<p>The governor said under the Exclusive List as enshrined in the constitution, security is the sole responsibility of the federal government, adding that: “We provide 90 per cent in terms of whatever is expected of us, based on resources available to us.”

By DELE MOMODU</p>
<p>Fellow Nigerians, I started this story last week, May 16, 2020, the very day I turned 60. The story ended at the point Chief Moshood Abiola threw his hat in the ring, and picked up the nomination forms to contest the Presidential race under the ticket if the Social Democratic Party (SDP). I was naturally elated. I had always been of the firm belief that Nigeria would witness positive and sporadic changes the day the movers and shakers of the country allow one of our many brightest brains and visionary leaders to take power. Without any shade of doubt, Chief Moshood Abiola would have been such a perfect choice.</p>
<p>It is pertinent to quickly explain and describe what made Chief Abiola a perfect choice. Most leaders in Nigeria appeared more like sectional leaders and religious fundamentalists. Chief Abiola was an avowed Nationalist and, though a devout Muslim, he was very liberal and liberated. This was amply demonstrated in practical terms in his many businesses across the nation, and beyond. I was fortunate to have worked at the Concord newspapers from 1988 to 1990 and witnessed first hand how the Yoruba generalissimo, Aare Ona Kakanfo Abiola, clearly reflected the spirit and content of federal character, freedom of worship and association in the employment of his numerous staff.</p>
<p>Chief Abiola’s sudden foray into politics thus forced to follow him, naturally, and I instantly became one of media aides. I was one of the few, including Dele Alake, Segun Babatope and Tunji Bello, who had direct access to him but worked more on the media with his wife and Managing Director of Concord newspapers, Dr Hamidat Doyinsola Abiola. His wives, Alhaja Kudirat Abiola, Chief Mrs Adebisi Abiola and others were assigned roles and this helped to reach out to differe parts of the country more readily. Chief Abiola liked to work in multiple layers. His strategy was to open a strictly political office on Opebi Road, while members of the inner causes operated in his expansive home. He decentralized everything. His first son, Abdul-Lateef Kolawole Abiola, coordinated a chunk of the highly technical and tedious operations from his home then at Anthony Village. Fortunately, Chief Abiola had introduced Kola and a few of his siblings to high level contacts early in life. This would proof useful and beneficial. Chief Abiola’s ownership of Concord Airlines, and in particular the purchase of a BAC 1-11 private jet, made it easier for him to crisscross the nation in a jiffy.</p>
<p>The first major task was how to win the primary election and secure the party ticket. This was definitely not going to be easy because the party Chairman, Alhaji Babagana Kingibe was in the race. Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, Chief Reuben Famuyibo were also in the race. We had less than two months to achieve the near-impossible at the SDP convention in Jos. Structures were set up for mobilizations, funding, media, security, transport, logistics and so on. To cut a long story short, Chief Abiola became the SDP flagbearer after a lot of negotiations and supposed horse-trading with party apparatchik including Retired Major General Shehu Musa Yar’Adua, at the home of Ambassador Yahaya Kwande in Jos. Kola Abiola had to fly in Yar’Adua who was able to persuade Alhaji Atiku Abubakar to suspend his own ambition. The SDP Governors wanted Babagana Kingibe but they were later softened by Chief Abiola.</p>
<p>We returned to Lagos after the primaries and went straight into action. I will not bore you with details but it was obvious Chief was way ahead of his opponent Alhaji Bashir Tofa. This became absolutely apparent during one of the best Presidential debates ever organized by the Nigerian Television Authority at Victoria Island, Lagos. The election proper was slated for June 12, 1993. We worked so hard and I knew our candidate would win. And he did, resoundingly!</p>
<p>Ironically, I was not in Nigeria on June 12, 1993. Chief Abiola had sent me on a special mission to Vienna where Chief Abdul-Ganiyu Oyesola Fawehinmi (SAN) was receiving the Bruno Kreisky Awards for Human rights. Before I departed Nigeria to London on June 9, I had attended the launch of the book, Legend of Our Time: The Thoughts of M.K.O Abiola, edited by Yemi Ogunbiyi and Chidi Amuta. I boarded my flight that night and landed Gatwick Airport on June 10 from where I connected to Vienna. Chief Fawehinmi was stunned when I suddenly appeared to him. “No, this can’t be Dele, it must be his apparition!” he said in his booming voice. We hugged and exchanged banters. Chief Fawehinmi had, uncharacteristically, attended my wedding ceremony in Ijebu Igbo, Ogun State, on December 19, 1992, as a mark of special bond between us. This Vienna trip was a perfect “retaliation.” I delivered Chief Abiola’s congratulatory letter to him and he was full of gratitude.</p>
<p>The award ceremony took place on June 11, 1993, and I departed Vienna to London on June 12. I was anxious to know how the elections were going on back home as there was no social media then to provide instant communications. There were rumors that some uncharitable and retrograde organisation known as Association of Better Nigeria (ABN) had filed a suit at a High Court and a Judge sitting in the middle of night had awarded them an injunction stopping the election. But the election held as scheduled. It must be noted that it turned out to be the best and fairest election ever held in our dear beloved country. Not a single case of violence anywhere.</p>
<p>On June 13, I managed to put a call through to the Concord newsroom in Nigeria where it was confirmed that Chairman, as we called Chief Abiola was coasting home to victory. My excitement knew no bounds. On Monday, June 14, 1993, I was able to reach Nduka Obaigbena by phone. He said he’s been trying to reach me frantically because, as put it, “seems your man is winning but he needs to reach his friend Babangida urgently because he might be stopped for taking power!” I found his message strange and incomprehensible. How can a man work so hard to win an election and he would be deprived of his victory and glory. It was odd and inconceivable, to say the least, I kept soliloquizing!</p>
<p>Chief Gani Fawehinmi arrived London from Vienna that day and when we spoke, we agreed to return to Nigeria on June 16, 1993. I told Chief what Nduka had told me but he also dismissed it as unfounded rumor and impossible action. That put my mind at rest. I did not make any effort to reach Chief Abiola in Lagos. Unknown to be, Nduka had delivered the same message to Dr Doyin Abiola but I’m not sure if she found the information worthy of telling her husband. In retrospect, I wonder if Chief Abiola’s prompt reaction and intervention may have changed the course of events.</p>
<p>Chief Fawehinmi and I boarded our flight to Lagos from Gatwick Airport. It was there we got the report of possible hanky-panky ongoing in Nigeria. By the time we landed in Lagos, human rights activists like Beeko Ransome-Kuti, Femi Falana and others were already waiting to join forces with Fawehinmi to mount pressure on the recalcitrant military government that seemed unwilling to conclude the beautiful democratic process for whatever reasons. Again, no one knows what the role of negotiations and persuasions could have played in resolving the logjam at that stage. Most of us believed we could force the military to rescind whatever nefarious intentions they planned to execute.</p>
<p>We chose to confront Babangida and his goons. The wonderful election was annulled. It was my first time of seeing that word, annulment, in the lexicon. I was soon caught up in the crossfire and arrested by the end of July 1993 and dumped inside a detention dungeon at Alagbon Close in Ikoyi. That’s another story for another day. I was in detention when a Chief Abiola disappeared and escaped from Nigeria in his private jet. I was very excited that he left because I didn’t want him to get hurt. From abroad, the battle raged on and neither side was ready to blink first. It went on till President Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida announced his sudden departure, which he called “stepping aside”, while announcing an Interim Government to be headed by former Chairman of UAC Nigeria, Chief Ernest ‘Degunle Shonekan.</p>
<p>The emergence of Chief Shonekan, who did not contest election, as the new leader of Nigeria, was somehow strange and bizarre. This further enraged and infuriated Chief Abiola. What was worse, both Chiefs were from Abeokuta, Ogun State. Chief Abiola was advised to return home. I’m sure he was tricked by members of the Abacha group who were already at an advanced stage of coup plotting but desperately needed Chief Abiola’s tacit endorsement for legitimacy!… (to be continued)</p>
<p>A Zoom Party that Rocked the World</p>
<p>I had planned to celebrate my 60th birthday with my family and a few friends at home in London. Thereafter, the grand finale would shift to Lagos for a mother of all parties on May 31, 2020. But man can only propose while God would dispose. COVID-19 sneaked in, like a thief in the night, and all my plans froze ramrod! By the middle of April, reality had dawned on me and I was already dismantling my ambitious plans.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, friends kept asking me about what to do. Most of them truly wanted to party hard. March/April, I was supposed to traverse London, Portugal, Brazil and Turkey, attending events, as usual, but everything changed at the speed of light. And I have been stranded in Lagos ever since!</p>
<p>About a week to D-Day, I got a call from Ayo Animashaun, Chairman of Hip Tv and he told me he and a few of protégés had decided we must have a zoom party. He laid bare their elaborate plans and I was wowed! Last Saturday, dreams turned to reality as we hosted what’s probably the biggest virtual party yet out of Africa. In total, over 1,400 guests cumulatively attended the extraordinary celebration that trended in several continents. The event was broadcast live in over 40 African countries by Hip Tv as well as on social media platforms to a global audience.</p>
<p>I’m eternally grateful to too many people to mention here. But I must single out President Muhammadu Buhari for his powerful congratulatory message. The video message from the Vice President Professor Yemi Osinbajo trended endlessly. The Vice President of Liberia, Mrs Jewel Howard-Taylor, sent a beautiful video. Former President Ibrahim Babangida surprised everyone when he appeared on the zoom party and spoke so eloquently. Former President John Dramani Mahama of Ghana spoke from the heart.</p>
<p>The Governor of Lagos State, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu wowed the celebrant and his guests with a beautiful speech live from his office. Governor Benedict Ayade of Cross River State called in during the event. The Minister of Transport, Mr Rotimi Amaechi, spoke about his friend from way back. Reverend Mother Esther Abimbola Ajayi and her husband, Dr Ademuyiwa Ajayi, poured Encomium son a man who has become more of a member of family. Thisday Publisher, Prince Nduka Obaigbena officiated the cutting of the cake. UBA Chairman, Dr Tony Elumelu, proposed the toast. A special service was organized by Trinity House led by Pastor Ituah Ighodalo. Prayers were offered by Pastor Sola Fola-Alade from London, Pastor Afolabi Ghandi OLAOYE from USA. Goodwill messages poured in from different parts of the world. Pastor Tunde Bakare was full of appreciation for the healthy relationship between him and his younger friend and Brother. Chief Oyekunle ALEX-Duduyemi, Chief Commander Ebenezer Obey were elder statesmen at the party.</p>
<p>Welcome, Professor Ibrahim Agboola Gambari</p>
<p>What a choice President Muhammadu Buhari made in his new Chief if Staff. Indeed most pundits were thrown off-balance when the name of Professor Gambari propped up out of the blues! But for me, this was an appointment I couldn’t fault.</p>
<p>I have known and admired Professor Gambari for many years and had the privilege of visiting in New York and interviewing at the United Nations. He was ever so helpful and useful. Also, he is very humble and unassuming. The last time I visited him was in Lagos about five years when Prince Adedamola Aderemi and I accompanied Engineer Lanre Shagaya to see Prof Gambari somewhere in Ikoyi.</p>
<p>No mortal is perfect but I’m reasonably convinced that Prof Gambari is well equipped to use his wealth of experience to the benefit of his principal, President Buhari, and the country in general. May you succeed Sir.

<h3 id="benin-backs-okonjo-iweala-for-wto-dg">&ldquo;Benin Backs Okonjo-Iweala for WTO DG&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/2020/06/14b5410e-ngozi-okonjo-iweala.jpg" alt="img">
Tobi Soniyi</p>
<p>The nomination of Nigeria’s former Minister for Finance and former Managing Director of World Bank, Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala for the Director General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has received a boost as Republic of Benin withdrew its nomination in support of the Nigeria’s nominee for the top job.</p>
<p>In a letter dated 12th June, 2020 and addressed to the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Benin to the United Nations Office and other International Organizations based in Geneva, Switzerland, Benin informed the Permanent Missions of the Member States of the International Organization of La Francophonie (01F) at the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Geneva, of its decision to withdraw its candidate in the person of Ambassador, Permanent Representative of Benin in Geneva, His Excellency Eloi Laourou.</p>
<p>Benin said that her decision to withdraw her nomination was informed by consultations conducted by three African countries registered by the Summit of Heads of State and Government of the African Union on February 10, 2020 in Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), for the endorsement of a single candidate from Africa for the post of Director General of the WTO, for the period 2021 – 2025.</p>
<p>Benin said that the decision to give her support to the candidacy of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, in the person of Okonjo-Iweala was informed by AU decision to support a consensus candidate.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources told THISDAY that credit should be given to President Patrice Guillaume Athanase Talon of the Republic of Benin for his country’s decision to support Nigeria for the WTO Director General”s job.</p>
<p>This decision of the President of the Republic of Benin was said to have been inspired by his high sense of seeking consensus around a candidate which will be endorsed by the African Union, as recommended by the Heads of State and Government of the African Union in their decisions adopted respectively on July 07, 2019 in Niamey, Niger Republic and February 10, 2020 at Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Benin Republic”s Permanent Mission has also called on counterparts in the member states of the OIF to inform their respective national authorities that she has decided to throw her weight behind Nigeria’s candidate Okonjo-Iweala.</p>
<p>Last week, WTO acknowledged the nomination of Okonjo-Iweala, as one of the candidates for the position of the Director-General of the organization.</p>
<p>The WTO has opened nominations for a successful candidate that will succeed the current Director-General, Mr Roberto Azevedo, who will be stepping down on August 31, 2020, one year ahead of time</p>
<p>WTO announced this on 9th June, 2020 via its twitter handle.</p>
<p>The tweet post from WTO states, “Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Chair of the Board of Gavi and Nigeria’s former Finance Minister, has been nominated by Nigeria as a candidate for the post of WTO Director-General.”</p>
<p>President Muasu Buhari nominated Okonjo-Iweala for the top job. However, her nomination was opposed by Egypt on grounds that the period of nominations had elapsed.</p>
<p>Egypt claimed that the African Union executive had set November 30, 2019 as the deadline for submission of nominees for African countries, therefore, Nigeria’s nomination violated that.</p>
<p>However, the WTO disagreed saying that the nomination process actually opened on June 8, 2020 and will end on July 8, contrary to the claim by Egypt.</p>
<p>The statement from WTO says, “The nomination period ends on 8 July. Learn more about the process to select the next Director-General of WTO.”</p>
<p>The WTO says that after the nomination period is closed, the candidates will be invited to meet with members at a special general council meeting, present their views and take questions from the membership.</p>
<p>Other nominees for the post so far include Mr. Jesús Seade Kuri of Mexico, and Mr. Abdel-Hamid Mamdouh of Egypt.</p>
<p>Dr. Okonjo-Iweala, is a world-renowned economist and international development expert.
