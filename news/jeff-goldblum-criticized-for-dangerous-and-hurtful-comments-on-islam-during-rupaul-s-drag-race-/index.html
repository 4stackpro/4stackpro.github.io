Jeff Goldblum became a topic of discussion on social media for his questions about Islam&rsquo;s treatment of the LGBTQ community and women during Friday&rsquo;s episode of &ldquo;RuPaul’s Drag Race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Goldblum&rsquo;s questions came after contestant Jackie Cox walked the runway in a patriotic red and white striped kaftan and a blue hijab outlined with 50 stars for the show&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stars &amp; Stripes&rdquo; theme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can be Middle-Eastern, you can be Muslim and you can still be American,&rdquo; Cox, who is of Iranian heritage, said in a voiceover.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Jurassic World 3&rdquo; star, who served as a guest judge during the episode, asked Cox if she was religious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not, and, to be honest, this outfit really represents the importance that visibility for people of religious minorities need to have in this country,&rdquo; Cox replied.</p>
<p>Goldblum continued asking Cox about her religion&rsquo;s stance on the LGBTQ community and women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there something in that religion that is anti-homosexuality and anti-woman? Does that complicate the issue?&rdquo; the actor asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just raising it and thinking out loud and maybe being stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>RuPaul quickly chimed in noting how drag has always &ldquo;shaken the tree&rdquo; and if there was ever a place to make that sort of statement, &ldquo;this is the stage to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cox admitted it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;complex issue&rdquo; and that she has her own &ldquo;misgivings&rdquo; about how the LGBTQ community is treated in the Middle East.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is so important to me is that if you just happen to be different, then live that truth,&rdquo; Cox said.</p>
<p>She continued noting how the Muslim ban affected her family and &ldquo;destroyed&rdquo; her faith in the United States.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to show America that you can be LGBT and from the Middle East and there&rsquo;s going to be complicated (expletive) around that and that&rsquo;s OK,&rdquo; Cox said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m here and I deserve to be in America just as much as anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What you don&rsquo;t know:about America&rsquo;s Islamic heritage</p>
<p>People on social media called out Goldblumfor his &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; comments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That statement by jeff goldblum that islam as a religion is anti woman and anti lgbt was so incredibly uneducated and dangerous and hurtful,&rdquo; tweeted @femmesnowflake.</p>
<p>Others said that Goldblum&rsquo;s questions perpetuated the idea that Muslims and Arabs are only &ldquo;allowed to be exemplified by the worst,&rdquo; whereas &ldquo;Christianity, is forever allowed to be exemplified by the best of what it represents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeff Goldblum felt the need to say &ldquo;but isn&rsquo;t Islam anti-gay and anti-woman&rdquo; to Jackie because she was wearing a stars-and-stripes hijab, as if America hasn&rsquo;t been anti-gay and anti-woman from the outset, or killed and displaced millions of Muslims, including women and queers&hellip;,&rdquo; tweeted Omar Sakjr.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeff Goldblum&rsquo;s question about Islam to the performer wearing hijab in #DragRace always makes me wonder what folks say about us Muslims behind our backs,&rdquo; Wajahat Ali tweeted. &ldquo;This was him holding back &amp; trying to be sensitive. He&rsquo;s well-traveled, informed &amp; he&rsquo;s from &ldquo;liberal Hollywood.&rdquo; I wonder&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yikes at Jeff Goldblum saying being Muslim = being Anti women,&rdquo; added @tender_oni.</p>
<p>Others pointed out that if a drag queen was of any other religion, she wouldn&rsquo;t have been asked this question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That question wouldn’t have happened to any other queen, of any other race. they are exploiting her on the stage in such a gross way by making her defend an entire religion she already said she doesn’t practice????&rdquo; tweeted @nicolahearts.</p>
<p>Some people came to Goldblum&rsquo;s defense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why Jeff Goldblum has received backlash from this is beyond me. He asked a perfectly acceptable question to Jackie regarding her attire and the symbolisation of why she decided to wear it on the run way. He was both brave and valid to ask the question!&rdquo; tweeted @Ian_banham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeff Goldblum asked a QUESTION. He did not &ldquo;go on television to say Muslims are ‘anti-homosexuality and anti-woman’,&rdquo; wrote Walp0le.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, wait, wait! Is that what people was calling islamophobic and xenophobic?&rdquo; tweeted @ChoklateHulk.</p>
<p>USA TODAY has reached out to reps for Jeff Goldblum and &ldquo;RuPaul&rsquo;s Drag Race.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="jeff-goldblum-questions-muslim-treatment-of-lgbtq-folks-on-drag-race">Jeff Goldblum Questions Muslim Treatment of LGBTQ Folks on &lsquo;Drag Race&rsquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.pride.com/sites/www.pride.com/files/rupauls-drag-race-jeff-goldblum-jackie-cox-muslim-ban.jpg" alt="img">
Jeff Goldblum Questions Muslim Treatment of LGBTQ Folks on RuPaul&rsquo;s Drag Race</p>
<p>The actor had a question for Jackie Cox during the &ldquo;Stars &amp; Stripes&rdquo; runway, and it resulted in one of the most heartfelt, authentic moments of the entire season.</p>
<p>Season 12 of RuPaul&rsquo;s Drag Race is in the home stretch with just seven queens left, and on tonight&rsquo;s runway, Jackie Cox brought some Middle Eastern representation to this week&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stars &amp; Stripes&rdquo; theme.</p>
<p>The New York-based queen wore a stunning red-striped caftan with a midnight blue hijab lined with 50 silver stars, a statement piece among the dazzling America-themed outfits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cmon hijab!&rdquo; RuPaul cheered from the judges&rsquo; panel as Cox turned the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can be Middle Eastern, you can be Muslim, and you can still be American,&rdquo; she quips in the voiceover.</p>
<p>And while the queens stood statuesquely on the runway waiting to be judged, actor and this week&rsquo;s special guest judge Jeff Goldblum had a potentially controversial question for Cox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you religious, may I ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; Cox replies. &ldquo;To be honest, this outfit really represents the importance that visibility for people of religious minorities need to have in this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Goldblum inquires deeper about the Islamic faith and how the religion treats LGBTQ+ people. &ldquo;Is there something in this religion that is anti-homosexuality? And anti-woman? Does that complicate the issue? I&rsquo;m just raising it and thinking out loud and maybe being stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Goldblum&rsquo;s question is certainly raw, but reflects thoughts many uninformed Americans might have. As The Advocate reports, activists say this kind of rhetoric is used to portray Muslim women and LGBTQ+ Muslims as &ldquo;victims of our own communities&rdquo; in an attempt to &ldquo;really pit communities against each other.&rdquo; This is a difficult field for Muslims to navigate.</p>
<p>Sensing a touchy subject, RuPaul jumped in with a comment on how drag pushes boundaries. &ldquo;Drag has always shaken the tree, so to speak. There are so many different layers to this presentation. If it was ever going to be done, this is the stage to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cox teared up on the runway as she spoke about her beliefs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a complex issue. I have my own misgivings about the way LGBT people are treated in the Middle East. And at the same time, I am one. What is so important to me that if you just happen to be different, then live that truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A travel ban prohibiting entry into the U.S. from all Muslim-majority countries was one of several controversial issues the Trump Administration ran on in 2016. When it passed in 2018, immigrants from Libya, Somalia, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen, and Cox&rsquo;s home country of Iran were barred from entering the country.</p>
<p>For Cox, it stopped his Aunt from coming to the U.S. to help take care of her sister, Cox&rsquo;s mother. Muslims across the country are feeling more nervous than ever and the restrictions have reignited fear in U.S. Muslim communities, and for good reason. Experts say hate crimes against Muslims have risen since Trump took office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the Muslim ban happened, it really destroyed a lot of my faith in this country. And really hurt my family. And that&rsquo;s so wrong to me,&rdquo; Cox said. &ldquo;I had to show America that you can be LGBT and from the Middle East and there&rsquo;s going to be complicated shit around that and that&rsquo;s okay. But I&rsquo;m here and I deserve to be in America as much as anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While uncomfortable at times, the poignant conversation is a truly authentic moment on the reality series. By asking the awkward question, not only did Goldblum learn more about Jackie Cox and the Muslim faith, but Drag Race viewers across the world also had the opportunity to educate themselves.

In The World According to Jeff Goldblum, Jeff meets up with passionate artists and doting fans from the tattoo community. He attends one of the largest tattoo conventions in the country, and surprises fans at a Pittsburgh tattoo parlor for &ldquo;Jeff Goldblum Day.&rdquo; (National Geographic/George Lange)</p>
<p>Warm weather is on its way and we’ve selected five perfect shows to binge-watch on Disney Plus to help bring in the sunshine.</p>
<p>Depending on where you’re at in the world, it might not feel very Spring-like yet. But the warm weather will soon make its long-awaited return! Prepare for the high-temps and sunshine with these five shows streaming on Disney Plus! Binge-watching these are sure to put you in the mood for flip-flops and frozen treats.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>The World According to Jeff Goldblum</li>
</ol>
<p>Why give up learning just because it’s Spring/Summer break? Disney Plus’ original series The World According to Jeff Goldblum takes us on a journey where Jeff discovers the extraordinary in the ordinary. Each episode explores a different topic, teaching us about mundane topics like sneakers, jewelry, gaming, and more. The World According to Jeff Goldblum is perfect for learning history and science facts.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Sonny with a Chance</li>
</ol>
<p>Demi Lovato has become an absolute success since her Disney days; most people know her name, and fans of the pop genre have probably belted along with at least one of her songs on the radio. But prior to “Sorry Not Sorry” and “Cool for the Summer,” Demi Lovato played one of my favorite Disney Characters: Sonny Munroe.</p>
<p>In Sonny with a Chance, Sonny has been given a chance-of-a-lifetime. The part-time high school student, part-time internet comedian has been invited to join the cast of her favorite sketch comedy, So Random.</p>
<p>Sonny quickly discovers that being on set is not all sunshine and rainbows, thanks to diva co-star Tawny and the cast of the rival show, Mackenzie Falls.</p>
<p>As this show it set in Los Angeles, Sonny with a Chance is a perfect show to bring in the warm weather!</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>The Suite Life on Deck</li>
</ol>
<p>Our beloved twins, Zack and Cody, are back with the spin-off, The Suite Life on Deck. In this round, Zack and Cody are leaving the hotel life behind and going on new adventures aboard the S.S. Tipton. Zack and Cody are golden for getting into mischief, and even more shenanigans ensue on the ship.</p>
<p>Familiar faces return in The Suite Life on Deck, such as London Tipton, along with new characters like Woody Fink. Even though the crew is attending high school courses while on aboard, the ship aesthetic still gives us warm weather vibes.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Phineas and Ferb</li>
</ol>
<p>Does anything scream warm weather more than Disney’s Phineas and Ferb? Their cartoon’s theme song is the summer anthem.</p>
<p>Phineas and Ferb has one goal: make every day of summer vacation an adventure. And, the step-brothers sure do that in each episode. I don’t know about you, but personally, I’m envious of their full-scale roller coaster.</p>
<p>Although some of the show’s shtick can be repetitive, such as Candace constant tattling on her brothers, each episode still remains fresh. It’s pretty obvious why this show remains popular with fans, long after its final episode.</p>
<ol>
<li>Gravity Falls</li>
</ol>
<p>Gravity Falls is by far one of my favorite more-recent cartoons and is absolutely perfect for bringing in the warm weather. Hang out with Dipper and Mabel during their summer vacation at Uncle Grunkle’s. The twins discover that Gravity Falls is filled with weird secrets and use their newly discovered cryptic journal to aid in defeating the evil around them.</p>
<p>I can probably write an entire list as to why you should stop what you’re doing and start binge-watching Gravity Falls right now. Dipper and Mabel’s shenanigans are on the top of that list, as the twins are always up to something crazy. Plus, their relationship proves that they are the ultimate sibling goals.</p>
<p>Also, as someone who loves the supernatural, I can’t recommend this show enough. There are gnomes disguised as zombies, unicorns, and more in Gravity Falls.</p>
