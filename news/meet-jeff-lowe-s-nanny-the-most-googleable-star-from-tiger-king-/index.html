Those who have seen Netflix’s Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness know that the most Googable star isn’t Joe Exotic or Carole Baskin, but Jeff Lowe’s nanny. Netflix’s Tiger King—which followed the rise and fall of Joe Exotic, the owner of Oklahoma’s Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park—released its eighth and final episode on Sunday, April 12. In the episode, host Joel McHale interviewed several key players from the documentary, including Jeff Lowe, Joe’s former business partner who now owns his park, and his wife, Lauren Lowe.</p>
<p>Among Joel’s questions was, of course, about Jeff and Lauren’s nanny. Tiger King viewers remember that Jeff and Lauren have an open marriage and that Jeff handpicked the couple’s nanny while Lauren was pregnant because he wanted a “hot nanny” for their baby. In the Tiger King reunion, Joel asked how the nanny is doing. “She’s hot,” Lauren said. Jeff added, “She’s excellent. You’ve seen her.” Joel then joked, “The first thing it says when you type in Jeff now on Google, it just says, ‘Jeff Lowe nanny.”</p>
<p>So, who is their nanny? Well, her name is Masha Diduk, and she’s a model and Instagram Influencer from las Vegas. Masha, who’s represented by MMG, has appeared on TV shows like David Spade’s Lights Out. But it seems like her current day job is the caretaker for Jeff and Lauren’s daughter, Sarah. According to Masha, she’s worked for Jeff and Lauren since September 2019. She met Jeff around four years at a Las Vegas hotel. As viewers remember, Jeff would often meet women at Las Vegas hotels by inviting them to his hotel room, where he would charm them with meet-and-greets with his tiger cubs.</p>
<p>Judging from Masha’s Instagram, she’s also taken to babysitting some of Jeff and Lauren’s animals. Photos from her account, which has more than 200,000 followers, show her cradling animals like sloths and baby big cats. It’s unclear how often Masha stays at Jeff and Lauren’s park in Oklahoma, but her Instagram shows her traveling back and forth between the zoo and her home in Las Vegas.

<h3 id="tiger-king-star-jeff-lowe-says-his-hot-nanny-is-excellent">&lsquo;Tiger King&rsquo; Star Jeff Lowe Says His &lsquo;Hot&rsquo; Nanny is &lsquo;Excellent&rsquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jeff-lowe-nanny-1586785665.png?crop=1.00xw:0.900xh;0,0.00860xh&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">
Jeff Lowe memorably hired a nanny at the conclusion of Netflix&rsquo;s Tiger King documentary.</p>
<p>In the new Tiger King reunion special, host Joel McHale asked Jeff and Lauren Lowe about the Nanny and their responses were once again strange.</p>
<p>They weren&rsquo;t the only cast members to be asked about the nanny.</p>
<p>Everyone is still excited about Netflix&rsquo;s runaway hit docuseries Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness centered on Joe Exotic; so excited, that is, that Netflix turned its 7-episode series into an 8-episode series, adding a reunion aftershow hosted by comedian Joel McHale over the weekend. In the special, titled &ldquo;The Tiger King and I,&rdquo; McHale spoke to numerous characters from the documentary. Among those were current zoo owner Jeff Lowe and his wife Lauren, and naturally the topic of their new nanny—who they discussed hiring at the end of the docuseries—came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Nanny&rsquo;s excellent,&rdquo; Jeff said when McHale asked how that whole situation is working out. &ldquo;Hot!&rdquo; Lauren added, a bizarre metric to judge by when talking about a person who&rsquo;s purpose, in theory, is child care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s excellent,&rdquo; Jeff added again. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McHale went on to (accurately) state that since the Tiger King documentary has come out, the first thing to be suggested on a Google search when someone types in &ldquo;Jeff&rdquo; is now &ldquo;Jeff Lowe Nanny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Lowes weren&rsquo;t the only ones to discuss the still-unnamed nanny in the new Tiger King episode; in the special&rsquo;s first interview, McHale asked zookeeper Erik Cowie, who still works at the G.W. Zoo, if he&rsquo;s met her. &ldquo;I just saw her booty, and that&rsquo;s about it,&rdquo; he told the host.</p>
<p>All we can do is hope that the mythical and still unidentified nanny is as good at caring for children as other people in her orbit seem to be at talking about her. We can only hope.
