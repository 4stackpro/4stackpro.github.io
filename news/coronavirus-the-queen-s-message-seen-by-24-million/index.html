Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Queen: &ldquo;We will be with our friends again, we will be with our families again, we will meet again&rdquo;</p>
<p>About 24 million TV viewers watched the Queen&rsquo;s broadcast to the nation on Sunday, according to overnight figures.</p>
<p>In a rare speech, the monarch thanked people for following government rules to stay at home and praised those &ldquo;coming together to help others&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The message was seen by 23.97 million viewers, making it the second most-watched broadcast this year.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson&rsquo;s statement announcing strict new coronavirus restrictions was watched by 27 million last month.</p>
<p>More than 14 million viewers watched the Queen&rsquo;s message on BBC One, with about five million viewing it on ITV.</p>
<p>Another 2.5 million watched the monarch deliver her rare speech on Channel 4, with more watching on Channel 5, Sky News and the BBC News channel.</p>
<p>Catch-up services are not included in overnight figures.</p>
<p>It was only the fifth time the Queen has given such a speech in her 68-year reign.</p>
<p>Her most recent Christmas Day message drew a combined overnight audience of 7.85 million.</p>
<p>In her speech on Sunday, the Queen said the UK &ldquo;will succeed&rdquo; in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>She thanked people for following government rules to stay inside and paid tribute to key workers for their efforts.</p>
<p>Speaking from Windsor Castle, the Queen said the pandemic was a &ldquo;different&rdquo; challenge compared to what the nation had faced before.</p>
<p>The message ended with the words &ldquo;we will meet again&rdquo; - an apparent reference to Dame Vera Lynn&rsquo;s bolstering war anthem We&rsquo;ll Meet Again.</p>
<p>The Queen&rsquo;s four other special addresses were given in 1991, 1997, 2002 and 2012.</p>
<p>The first was made at the beginning of the land war in Iraq, while the second was given on the eve of the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales.</p>
<p>The 2002 address came on the eve of her mother&rsquo;s funeral, while the 2012 speech marked her Diamond Jubilee.</p>
<p>Sunday&rsquo;s pre-recorded message was filmed by a single cameraman wearing protective equipment.</p>

<h3 id="a-painful-sense-of-separation-queen-recalls-wwii-child-evacuations-in-rare-address">‘A painful sense of separation’: Queen recalls WWII child evacuations in rare address</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/aPgFgkv6yetMBqpYbwX_Dhp_4rU=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/04-05-2020/t_a4adfe190ae944faa0539cb35d63dbd0_name_01_queen.jpg" alt="img">
She also harked back to her first speech to the public ever, when she was only 14 and still a princess.</p>
<p>“It reminds me of the very first broadcast I made, in 1940, helped by my sister,” she said, as an archive photo of the girls appeared on-screen. “We as children spoke from here at Windsor [Castle] to children who had been evacuated from their homes and sent away for their own safety.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The wave of child evacuations had begun the year before, on Sept. 1, 1939 — the same day Nazi Germany invaded Poland and only two days before Britain’s prime minister declared war. Fearing civilian casualties if British cities were bombed, officials urged parents to send their children to the countryside to live with strangers who volunteered to provide space for them.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Evacuation of children was voluntary, according to the Imperial War Museum, but since urban schools had been shut down, the decision was made easier. In the first wave, nearly 1 million children, hundreds of thousands of teachers and half-a-million mothers with babies were evacuated. The teachers were assigned groups of kids to find spaces for when their trains arrived in smaller towns and villages.</p>
<p>“We marched to Waterloo Station behind our head teacher carrying a banner with our school’s name on it,” James Roffey told the BBC in 2011. “We all thought it was a holiday, but the only thing we couldn’t work out was why the women and girls were crying.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Accommodations varied wildly. Some children were virtually adopted by host families and given love and good care. Some lived in large manors housing dozens of children and run by teachers. Many of the urban children were seeing the countryside, agriculture and farm animals for the first time, finding it both inspiring and boring.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>For others, the evacuation was a nightmare. Their food rations from the government were confiscated by the families they ended up with; they were put to work in fields; many were physically and sexually abused. John Abbott told the BBC he was whipped by his host family whenever he spoke and was eventually rescued by local police, bruised and bleeding.</p>
<p>By Christmastime, the expected bombing of cities hadn’t materialized, and by January 1940, nearly half of parents had brought their children home, the museum said. The health ministry put up threatening posters to discourage this. One poster depicts a mother visiting her children in the country with a ghostly Adolf Hitler over her shoulder, tempting her like Satan to “Take them back! Take them back!”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“DON’T do it, Mother,” the caption reads in bright red ink. “LEAVE THE CHILDREN WHERE THEY ARE.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>By summer, France had fallen to Germany, spurring a new wave of evacuations. In September 1940, the predicted Nazi bombing campaign known as “the Blitz” began, and the last wave of child evacuations took place. Many well-to-do families also arranged for their children to be sent overseas to countries such as Canada, Australia and the United States.</p>
<p>It was after this last wave, in October 1940, that Princess Elizabeth addressed the children of Britain.</p>
<p>“Thousands of you in this country have had to leave your homes and be separated from your fathers and mothers,” she told them, her voice still high-pitched with youth. “To you, living in new surroundings, we send a message of true sympathy, and at the same time we would like to thank the kind people who have welcomed you to their homes in the country.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>She told them the children still at home, like she and her sister, Princess Margaret, were “trying to do all we can” to help the war effort.</p>
<p>That wasn’t empty talk. When Elizabeth turned 18 in early 1945, she joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service, where she trained as a truck mechanic and driver. To this day, she is the only female member of the royal family to have served in the military.</p>
<p>She is also the last living head of state to have served during World War II, according to the BBC, giving her a unique perspective on the current trials.</p>
<p>In 1940, she told the children — her contemporaries — “When peace comes, remember it will be for us, the children of today, to make the world of tomorrow a better and happier place.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Now 93, she said Sunday: “I hope, in the years to come, everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge. And those who come after us will say the Britons of this generation were as strong as any.”</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>“Today, once again, many will feel a painful sense of separation from their loved ones,” she closed. “But now, as then, we know deep down that it is the right thing to do.”

<h3 id="boris-johnson-hospitalized-as-queen-urges-british-resolve-in-face-of-epidemic">Boris Johnson Hospitalized as Queen Urges British Resolve in Face of Epidemic</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/05/world/05queen-speech-sub/05queen-speech-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
[Analysis: Peaks, testing and lockdowns: How coronavirus vocabulary causes confusion.]</p>
<p>“On the advice of his doctor, the prime minister has tonight been admitted to hospital for tests,” a spokesman said Sunday. “This is a precautionary step, as the prime minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus 10 days after testing positive for the virus.”</p>
<p>The British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, is expected to lead the daily cabinet meeting on the pandemic on Monday. Under the government’s succession plan, Mr. Raab would take up Mr. Johnson’s duties if he is incapacitated.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson’s hospitalization is a stark illustration of how deeply the virus has struck governments around the world, sickening officials from Britain to Brazil, killing a senior aide to the supreme leader of Iran, and sending the leaders of Germany and Canada into isolation.</p>
<p>The queen’s speech was only the fourth time in her 68-year reign in which she has addressed the British people, apart from her annual Christmas greeting — and it carried a distinct echo of the celebrated radio address her father, George VI, delivered in September 1939, as Britain stood on the brink of war with Germany.</p>
<p>Like the king eight decades ago, the queen appealed to the quintessential British traits of stoicism and solidarity, and explicitly linked the pandemic to the war as a defining moment for modern Britain. This time, she said, the country needs to come together to vanquish an enemy that brings death not in the terrifying bombing raids of the Blitz but in the ordinary encounters of people transmitting a dangerous pathogen.</p>
<p>“I hope in the years to come, everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge,” the queen said, “and those who come after us will say that the Britons of this generation were as strong as any. That the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet good-humored resolve and of fellow-feeling still characterize this country.”
