<p>T-Mobile appears to be having problems.</p>
<p>Customers are reporting that they can’t make or receive phone calls, although data appears to be unaffected. Some customers say that text messaging is also affected.</p>
<p>DownDetector, which collects outage reports from users, indicates that a major outage is underway. It’s not clear how widespread the issue is, but at the time of writing T-Mobile was trending across the United States on Twitter.</p>
<p>The outage appears to have started around 9-10am PT (12-1pm ET) on Monday.</p>
<p>In our own tests in New York and Seattle, we found that making calls from a T-Mobile phone would fail almost immediately after placing the call. We also found that the cell service on our phones was intermittent, with bars occasionally dropping to zero or losing access to high-speed data.</p>
<p>In April, Sprint and T-Mobile completed its merger, valued at $26 billion, making the combined cell network the third largest carrier in the United States behind AT&amp;T and Verizon.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for T-Mobile also did not immediately comment on the outage, but T-Mobile’s technology chief Neville Ray tweeted:</p>
<p>Our engineers are working to resolve a voice and data issue that has been affecting customers around the country. We’re sorry for the inconvenience and hope to have this fixed shortly. — Neville (@NevilleRay) June 15, 2020</p>
<p>Others have reported issues on other networks. When reached, spokespeople for AT&amp;T and Verizon (which owns TechCrunch) said their networks were operating normally. Sprint has not yet responded to a request for comment.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that the outage was caused by a cyberattack. Matthew Prince, chief executive at Cloudflare, a global content delivery network, said in a tweet that the company saw no spikes in internet traffic during the outage.</p>
<p>One wire report said Level 3, a major fiber network backbone that cell networks rely on for routing calls and messages, was experiencing an outage, which may have explained the network outages. But a spokesperson for CenturyLink, which owns Level 3, said that there was no current outage on its network.</p>
<p>Widespread cell networks outages are rare but do happen. In 2017, CenturyLink had a network failure that affected all major U.S. carriers and 911 emergency services that rely on the fiber network to route calls. In some U.S. counties, officials sent out emergency alerts to cell phone users to warn that 911 services had been disrupted.</p>
<p>Updated to note that carrier-dependent text messaging also appears to be affected; with AT&amp;T and Verizon responses; with an update from T-Mobile’s chief executive; and with a statement from CenturyLink. An earlier version of this report incorrectly stated Neville Ray’s job title.

What looks like a major outage has hit T-Mobile while Verizon, AT&amp;T, and Sprint this afternoon are also seeing issues. Hundreds of thousands of T-Mobile customers are saying they can’t make calls and texts with some having no Internet connection too. The problems for all four carriers appear to be nationwide.</p>
<p>date: 2020-06-16T10:35:20+08:00</p>
<p>Update 6:55 p.m. PT: T-Mobile is still working on a fix. Meanwhile, Cloudflare founder Matthew Prince has a helpful thread explaining that there has not been a big DDoS on the US. Instead, it was a mishap as T-Mobile was “making some changes to their network configurations today. Unfortunately, it went badly.” Read the full thread from Prince below for a behind the scenes look at what happened today and how it looked like a much broader problem than it actually is.</p>
<p>This afternoon T-Mobile users began seeing the service down for making calls and texts. At the time of writing, over 100,000 people have logged issues on Downdetector.com and also shared the problems they’re having on Twitter. Some are seeing their Internet connection still working with calls and texts being the issue while some are seeing all service from T-Mobile down.</p>
<p>Reports are coming from all around the US for the T-Mobile outage. Verizon, AT&amp;T, and Sprint users are also reporting issues today but the biggest impact to service seems to be with T-Mobile so far.</p>
<p>T-Mobile’s Metro service is also seeing downtime with one customer being told by the company that the carrier is doing an “upgrade” of some sort. But that’s just one story from one customer service rep. There appears to be a much bigger problem happening.</p>
<p>The curious thing is that the map of reported issues across all four major US carriers appears similar, with affected areas spanning most of the major US cities. Regional carriers like U.S. Cellular, Consumer Cellular, Mint, Cricket, and more are also seeing outages. However, some of those are MVNOs which means that if the major carrier they lease from is having trouble, they likely will too.</p>
<p>There’s no word yet from the carriers on what is causing the issues. Here’s the map view of reported outages from Downdetector for the major carriers:</p>

<p>@TMobileHelp is there a service outage? I cant text or call but I can use the internet to send this tweet lol — Cameron Hegger (@CameronHegger) June 15, 2020</p>
<p>Verizon having an outage too? — penny. (@privatepardi) June 15, 2020</p>
<p>Was ATT in that outage too?? Because…… — Eve🌱 (@itsevejf) June 15, 2020</p>
<p>date: 2020-06-16T10:35:20+08:00</p>
<p>Meanwhile, AT&amp;T told The Verge that its network is “operating normally.” The Verge suggests that the major T-Mobile outage could be causing users of other carriers to think their service is down (due to failed calls) when it could be just on T-Mobile’s end.</p>
<p>Our engineers are working to resolve a voice and data issue that has been affecting customers around the country. We’re sorry for the inconvenience and hope to have this fixed shortly. — Neville (@NevilleRay) June 15, 2020</p>
<p>Signs are pointing to the big T-Mobile outage being the problem with failed calls to T-Mobile users causing confusion. Verizon gave a general statement hinting at that to The Verge.</p>
<p>“We’re aware that another carrier is having network issues. Calls to and from that carrier may receive an error message,” reads part of a statement from Verizon.</p>
<p>While work continues to restore T-Mobile service, the company’s support team has suggested customers use FaceTime and other third-party calling services.</p>
<p>Our engineers are working to resolve a widespread routing issue affecting voice &amp; text. Customers may experience longer care wait times. Please try third-party calling apps (FaceTime, WhatsApp, Signal) as a temp solution. — T-Mobile Help (@TMobileHelp) June 15, 2020</p>
<p>Teams continue to work as quickly as possible to fix the voice &amp; messaging problems some are seeing.</p>
<p>Data services are now available &amp; some calls are completing. Alternate services like WhatsApp, Signal, iMessage, Facetime etc. are available. Thanks for your patience. https://t.co/uQiGSAFEAH — Neville (@NevilleRay) June 15, 2020</p>
<p>Update 6:55 p.m. PT: Hours later and T-Mobile is still working on the challenging problem. If you’ve been hearing about the issues today stemming from a huge DDoS attack, here’s a great debunk thread from Cloudflare founder, Matthew Prince:</p>
<p>It starts with T-Mobile. They were making some changes to their network configurations today. Unfortunately, it went badly. The result has been for around the last 6 hours a series of cascading failures for their users, impacting both their voice and data networks. 2/X — Matthew Prince 🌥 (@eastdakota) June 15, 2020</p>
<p>That caused a lot of T-Mobile users to complain on Twitter and other forums that they weren’t able to reach popular services. Then services like Down Detector scraps Twitter and report those services as being offline. 3/X pic.twitter.com/SdscxRaCcZ — Matthew Prince 🌥 (@eastdakota) June 15, 2020</p>
<p>So now people are looking around for an explanation and they stumble across sites like the Arbor Networks attack map. It looks terrifying today! Thing is, it always looks terrifying. It’s a marketing gimmick put up to sell DDoS mitigation services so that’s not surprising. 4/X — Matthew Prince 🌥 (@eastdakota) June 16, 2020</p>
<p>From @Cloudflare’s vantage point, we can see a number of things that show there is no massive DDoS attack. First, traffic from WARP to supposedly impacted services is normal and has no increase in errors. 5/X pic.twitter.com/vGPcWAaRgn — Matthew Prince 🌥 (@eastdakota) June 16, 2020</p>
<p>Second, there is no spike in traffic to any of the major Internet Exchanges, which you do see during actual DDoS attacks and definitely would during one allegedly this disruptive. 6/X pic.twitter.com/5zZCRwjsWo — Matthew Prince 🌥 (@eastdakota) June 16, 2020</p>
<p>Finally, our team know the network operators at nearly all the other major Internet services and platforms and none of them are reporting anything anomalous. 7/X — Matthew Prince 🌥 (@eastdakota) June 16, 2020</p>
<p>Except T-Mobile, which is having a bad day almost certainly entirely of their own team’s making. So, please, #hugops. And don’t worry, this is one thing that does not need to get added to the list of craziness that has been 2020. 8/8 pic.twitter.com/VONBSSlhLG — Matthew Prince 🌥 (@eastdakota) June 16, 2020</p>

T-Mobile US Inc. users in several states reported problems making and receiving phone calls Monday, a widespread service disruption for the newly enlarged wireless provider.</p>
<p>The network issues began in the afternoon at T-Mobile, which is taking early steps to integrate its April purchase of Sprint Corp. The transaction left the combined company with more than 100 million customers, including those running atop its infrastructure under other carriers’ brands.</p>

SALT LAKE CITY — At least two police departments in Utah have responded to a T-Mobile issue affecting customers nationwide.</p>
<p>Via their Twitter accounts, Layton and Provo City police informed their followers of the T-Mobile outages.</p>
<p>T-Mobile users may be unable to dial out, including to 911. If you are unable to call during an emergency using your T-Mobile phone, either locate someone with a phone on another cell carrier or send a Text to 911. Texts to 911 do appear to be going through. pic.twitter.com/7JUm8zAdCm — Layton Police (@laytonpolice) June 15, 2020</p>
<p>T-Mobile is currently experiencing a near-nationwide outage. For those w/ T-Mobile cell phones, you may be experiencing issues placing &amp; receiving calls, &amp; text messages may be affected. If you are trying to reach someone with T-Mobile, the call will most likely not be completed. — Provo City (@provocity) June 15, 2020</p>
<p>Layton Police texted residents “that texts to 911 using T-Mobile are received by 911, but our dispatchers’ responses are not getting back to the caller.”</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>Texts to 911 using T-Mobile are received by 911, but our dispatchers’ responses are not getting back to the caller. If texting is your ONLY option, please make sure you include a full address including city, the nature of your emergency and as many details as you can. — Layton Police (@laytonpolice) June 15, 2020</p>
<p>According to TechCrunch, T-Mobile users are telling the company they cannot send or receive calls on their phones. TechCrunch reports that the ability to send and receive text messages is also being impeded.</p>
<p>T-Mobile Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, Neville R. Ray, tweeted that the company is aware of the issue and is working to fix it.</p>

Is your T-Mobile service having issues? You&rsquo;re not alone</p>
<p>T-Mobile was having nationwide issues Monday. T-Mobile was having nationwide issues Monday.

<p>This article, Is your T-Mobile service having issues? You&rsquo;re not alone, originally appeared on CNET.com.</p>
<p>If your T-Mobile service was having issues on Monday, you were not alone. The third-largest wireless carrier is seemingly having widespread issues around the country impacting the ability to make calls and text.</p>
<p>It is unclear what caused the issue or when it will be resolved. Users across the country took to Twitter to note the outage, with T-Mobile rising to the top spot on the site&rsquo;s US Trending Topics as of 5:01 p.m. ET.</p>
<p>The main issue appears to be with calls and texts, with users saying that data was working normally.</p>
<p>Neville Ray, T-Mobile&rsquo;s president of technology, acknowledged in a tweet that the carrier was having an outage and said that the carrier &ldquo;hopes to have this fixed shortly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our engineers are working to resolve a voice and data issue that has been affecting customers around the country. We’re sorry for the inconvenience and hope to have this fixed shortly. — Neville (@NevilleRay) June 15, 2020</p>
<p>In a tweet sent shortly after 6 p.m. ET, Ray says the carrier was still working to fix calls and texts, while recommending that users use apps like FaceTime, WhatsApp and iMessage to communicate.</p>
<p>Those apps, unlike traditional SMS text messages or voice calls, send messages and calls through the data side of the network which is still operational.</p>
<p>Teams continue to work as quickly as possible to fix the voice &amp; messaging problems some are seeing.</p>
<p>Data services are now available &amp; some calls are completing. Alternate services like WhatsApp, Signal, iMessage, Facetime etc. are available. Thanks for your patience. https://t.co/uQiGSAFEAH — Neville (@NevilleRay) June 15, 2020</p>
<p>In tests in northern New Jersey, T-Mobile&rsquo;s data services appeared to be working normally, though I was unable to send text messages and had issues making calls on a OnePlus 8 5G .</p>
<p>A CNET editor in New York City was able to send texts and iMessage using an iPhone , but calls were not working on either device. An editor in the San Francisco Bay Area noted that calls were not working over Google Fi, the cell phone service offered by Google that relies on T-Mobile, Sprint and U.S. Cellular&rsquo;s respective networks. Data and texts over Fi, however, was working.</p>
<p>In addition to Google Fi, T-Mobile is the underlying network providing service for several other carriers such as its Metro prepaid brand as well as for Mint Mobile and Simple Mobile.</p>
<p>Downdetector.com, a site where users can report outages, noted issues with all major wireless carriers &ndash; AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T and Verizon each say that their respective networks are operating normally and without issues. Tests in northern New Jersey on AT&amp;T and Verizon phones showed no issues with calls, texts or data except when trying to text or call a T-Mobile phone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verizon&rsquo;s network is performing well. We&rsquo;re aware that another carrier is having network issues,&rdquo; a Verizon spokeswoman told CNET in a statement. &ldquo;Calls to and from that carrier may receive an error message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The company also took issue with Downdetector&rsquo;s spreading that its network is having outages. &ldquo;Sites such as Downdetector.com utilize limited crowdsourced data drawn from sample social posts which are often statistically insignificant or factually incorrect,&rdquo; the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of factors can contribute to a false report on a third-party website,&rdquo; adding that by simply aggregating this data &ldquo;the result can be faulty reports of network performance interruptions causing wide-spread miscommunication for wireless users.&rdquo;</p>
<p>T-Mobile referred back to Ray&rsquo;s tweet when asked for comment. Sprint, which is now owned by T-Mobile, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>T-Mobile customers across the U.S. are reporting that they cannot send or receive phone calls, and sometimes text messages. According to TechCrunch, the outage starting around 9-10 a.m. PT (12-1 p.m. ET) this morning, and at the time of this writing, is still the No. 1 trending topic in the U.S. on Twitter.</p>
<p>Downdetector shows a massive spike in outage reports at 12 p.m. PT, and while the number of reports has declined since then, that doesn’t mean service is restored. T-Mobile customers are still commenting on the Downdetector website and on Twitter, as it appears the company is still working to restore service.</p>
<p>Our engineers are working to resolve a widespread routing issue affecting voice &amp; text. Customers may experience longer care wait times. Please try third-party calling apps (FaceTime, WhatsApp, Signal) as a temp solution. — T-Mobile Help (@TMobileHelp) June 15, 2020</p>
<p>Not all major cities seem to be affected by the outage—I have T-Mobile and was still able to place calls to several people on other networks in Orange County, California. However, when I asked several people with the same and other networks to call me, their calls immediately failed.</p>
<p>Most of the outage reports are originating in Miami, Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta, Brooklyn, Tampa, Houston, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia, according to Downdetector. Metro PCS, which is owned by T-Mobile, also appears to be experiencing outages.</p>
<p>But the problem could be more widespread” AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Sprint all showed a spike in outage reports on Downdetector at the same time as T-Mobile. According to one Sprint customer, Ron G., who spoke with Sprint customer service, other carriers’ customers are experiencing phone and text outages because those towers can’t connect to T-Mobile’s towers. Gizmodo has reached out to AT&amp;T and Sprint to confirm if this is the case, but have yet to hear back.</p>
<p>A T-Mobile spokesperson directed us to CTO Neville Ray’s Twitter feed for updates and info surrounding the outage:</p>
<p>Our engineers are working to resolve a voice and data issue that has been affecting customers around the country. We’re sorry for the inconvenience and hope to have this fixed shortly. — Neville (@NevilleRay) June 15, 2020</p>
<p>A Verizon spokesperson provided Gizmodo with the following statement:</p>
<p>“Verizon’s network is performing well. We’re aware that another carrier is having network issues. Calls to and from that carrier may receive an error message. “We understand Downdetector is falsely reporting Verizon network issues. Sites such as Downdetector.com utilize limited crowdsourced data drawn from sample social posts which are often statistically insignificant or factually incorrect. A lot of factors can contribute to a false report on a third-party website … a faulty device, network traffic that slows but doesn’t inhibit connections, commercial RF blockers, human error, network issues impacting other carriers and more. These types of sites do not evaluate and confirm the crowd-sourced data that they receive, they simply aggregate it and report it. The result can be faulty reports of network performance interruptions causing wide-spread miscommunication for wireless users.”</p>
<p>Spokespeople for AT&amp;T and Verizon also told TechCrunch that networks are operating normally, and there is no evidence of a DDoS other type of cyberattack. CenturyLink also told TechCrunch that it was not experiencing fiber network outages either. Other reports previously suggested that Level 3, which is owned by CenturyLink and is a major network backbone that carriers like T-Mobile rely on to route calls and messages, was experiencing an outage.</p>
<p>We will update this story when we have more information about the cause of the outages.

Cell phone carrier is out in local area too</p>
<p>A major mobile phone carrier is out of service today.</p>
<p>T-Mobile&rsquo;s network appears to be down practically nationwide.</p>
<p>This is affecting the local area too.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll note here that The Star has been partially relying on our T-Mobile connections, passing through our landline phone calls to our cell phones when we&rsquo;re not in the office.</p>
<p>A recording received at a support number for businesses says the company is having technical issues and they&rsquo;re working on it.</p>
