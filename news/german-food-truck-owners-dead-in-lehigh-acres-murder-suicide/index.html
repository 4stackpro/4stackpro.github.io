<p>LEE COUNTY, Fla. – The owners of a beloved German food truck were found dead in Lehigh Acres Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Annemarie Reimelt and Helmut Heiss owned the Schnitzel Express. The two married in 2017, but divorced in 2019.</p>
<p>Lee County deputies believe Helmut shot and killed Annemarie, then killed himself. Neighbors confirmed hearing gunshots Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Last week, Annemarie filed court documents to try and sell their jointly owned properties. She requested money from Helmut for certain fees and investments she put into the homes.</p>
<p>We are saddened to announce the passing of two of our beloved food truck vendors here at the Vanderbilt Farmers Market. … Posted by Vanderbilt Farmer&rsquo;s Market on Wednesday, July 29, 2020</p>
<p>Friends of the former couple said Annemarie was very happy when she first met Helmut. They also confirmed Helmut was extremely passionate about his cooking and Annemarie handled everything else on the food truck.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s with a heavy heart that I mention the passing of fellow food truckers Helmut and his wife Anne Marie of Schnitzel… Posted by JD&rsquo;s Chuck Wagon on Wednesday, July 29, 2020</p>
<p>Many other food trucks in Southwest Florida reported the two were great people and easy to work with.

Fascist death squads preparing to carry out mass murder in Germany</p>
<p>By Jordan Shilton</p>
<p>7 August 2020</p>
<p>Fascist death squads are actively preparing to carry out mass murder of political opponents in Germany on “Day X,” according to a front page New York Times article published Sunday. Headlined “Body bags and enemy lists: How far-right police officers and ex-soldiers prepare for ‘Day X,’” the article documents a vast conspiracy to hoard large quantities of munitions and weaponry, establish safe houses, identify political opponents and procure the necessary materials to secretly dispose of dead bodies.</p>
<p>The main focus of the piece is the far-right Northern Cross (Nordkreuz) group, which developed under the leadership of a former soldier and current police officer, Marko Gross, in the northeastern German state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Nordkreuz emerged out of a larger far-right chat group established by German special forces (KSK) soldier Andre Schmidt, who is nicknamed “Hannibal.” Motivated by hatred of immigrants and opposition to the current social order, Gross, who is a member of the neo-fascist Alternative for Germany (AfD), and other members drew on fascistic networks in the police and military to obtain over 50,000 rounds of ammunition, 30 body bags and dozens of weapons, including an Uzi submachine gun. They drew up death lists of opponents, which included private information accessed through police computers. Plans also existed to purchase more body bags and quicklime, which can be used to conceal the smell of decomposing bodies.</p>
<p>The Times report on these chilling details, which recall nothing so much as the fascist death squads that operated in Latin American military dictatorships during the 1970s and 1980s to exterminate thousands of left-wing activists and workers, is the second in less than a month on the fascist infiltration of the German state apparatus. In a wide-ranging July 3 piece, the newspaper documented the far-right infiltration of the police and military, the effective takeover of the KSK by fascists, and the plans of far-right forces to launch a violent uprising on “Day X.” Recalling political conditions during the Weimar Republic following the First World War, the Times’ article detailed how a nominally democratic state confronts far-right conspiracies on all sides, above all from within. (See: Massive neo-Nazi penetration of German military and police)</p>
<p>The latest article shows how the chat network established by “Hannibal” served as a springboard for plots to exterminate political opponents and prepare for civil war-like conditions. Gross and about 30 colleagues joined the group in late 2015 at the height of the European refugee crisis. “In their eyes, Germany faced a potential invasion from terrorists, a possible breakdown of its welfare system, maybe even unrest,” wrote the Times. By January 2016, Gross established a parallel group and called it Nordkreuz.</p>
<p>Later in 2016, Gross and other Nordkreuz members travelled to an arms fair in Nuremberg where they met “Hannibal” face to face. “They began hoarding enough supplies to survive for 100 days, including food, gasoline, toiletries, walkie-talkies, medicine and ammunition,” the Times adds. “Mr. Gross collected 600 euros from each member of the group to pay for it. In all, he amassed more than 55,000 rounds of ammunition… Members of the group learned how to rappel down the tower of a disused fire station. Two pickup points were designated as Day X meeting spots. Two fully functioning operating theaters were built as makeshift field hospitals, in a basement and a mobile home.”</p>
<p>Gross improbably claimed that he could not remember how he accessed the ammunition and weapons. But he acknowledged having a network of up to 2,000 like-minded individuals in the German military and other state agencies. The weapons found in Gross’ home were traced to a dozen police and military depots across Germany.</p>
<p>Gross left no doubt about the purpose of these sinister preparations. “The scenario was that something bad would happen,” he told the Times. “We asked ourselves, what did we want to prepare for? And we decided that if we were going to do this, we would go all the way.”</p>
<p>In police testimony from 2017 seen by the Times, Horst Schelski, a former air force officer and Nordkreuz member, described how the group intended to put its preparations into practice. “People were to be gathered and murdered,” he commented. Schelski reported on a meeting with Jan Henrik H., a Nordkreuz member now under investigation for terrorism offences. According to Schelski, H. kept a thick binder in his garage with the names, addresses and photos of local politicians and activists. Some of the information was in the form of “hand-written notes with information obtained from a police computer.” H. also asked Schelski for advice on how to transport captives past checkpoints that may be set up during a crisis.</p>
<p>No less astounding than the revelations exposing a death squad in waiting is the fact that the police and judicial authorities have left their structures virtually intact. Gross is the only member to date to have been charged at all. He was merely convicted of being in possession of illegal weapons and handed a 21-month suspended sentence. In the ongoing terrorism investigation against the other two Nordkreuz members, Gross is a witness. Gross boasted to the Times that Nordkreuz’s safe house remains ready for use. “The network is still there,” he declared.</p>
<p>As disturbing as the Nordkreuz revelations are, they merely represent the tip of the iceberg. New information comes to light on virtually a daily basis of new far-right networks within the police, military or intelligence services. Over recent weeks, a growing number of left-wing artists, politicians, activists and journalists have received death threats signed “NSU 2.0,” a reference to the neo-Nazi terrorist organisation National Socialist Underground that committed ten murders over the course of a decade. Private information on several recipients of these letters, including the lawyer Seda Başay-Yıldız, who represented NSU victims at trial, was obtained from police computers in the state of Hesse. The police officer whose computer was used to obtain Başay-Yıldız’s information was part of a far-right chat group consisting of dozens of police officers in Hesse. The state’s police chief resigned over the ensuing scandal.</p>
<p>This demonstrates that far-right networks are not merely widespread in Germany, but have increasingly extended their control over the very state institutions nominally tasked with investigating right-wing extremist criminal activity. As Dirk Friedriszik, a state politician in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, told the Times, “It isn’t just the KSK. The real worry is these cells are everywhere. In the army, in the police, in reservist units.”</p>
<p>The resurgence of fascist forces within Germany’s state apparatus exposes the fraud of the post-war propaganda portraying the Federal Republic as a bastion of democracy at the centre of an ever-closer united Europe. The reality is that the same objective contradictions of capitalism that encouraged the German bourgeoisie to throw its lot in with Hitlerite fascism in the 1930s are propelling its descendants to cultivate far-right shock troops. German imperialism requires such forces to prosecute its interests more aggressively around the world under conditions in which the rivalries between the major powers for markets, raw materials and geostrategic influence are intensifying. At the same time, the ruling elite confronts growing social inequality and mounting popular opposition at home, which will only be accelerated by the ruling class’ homicidal back-to-work drive amid a raging pandemic.</p>
<p>The revival of German militarism was prepared in a political conspiracy behind the backs of the population during late 2013 and into 2014 involving all political parties, journalists and academia. At the Munich Security Conference in February 2014, then Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier declared that Germany was too large to “comment on world affairs from the sidelines” and declared the era of German military restraint to be over. That same month, professor Jörg Baberowski told Der Spiegel, “Hitler was not a psychopath, he wasn’t vicious. He did not want to talk about the extermination of the Jews at his table.”</p>
<p>At an emergency party congress held in September 2014, the German Trotskyists of the Sozialistische Gleichheitspartei (SGP) identified the close connection between the revival of German great power ambitions and the resurgence of far-right and pro-Nazi views. “History is returning with a vengeance,” declared the resolution. “Almost 70 years after the crimes of the Nazis and its defeat in World War II, the German ruling class is once again adopting the imperialist great power politics of the Kaiser’s Empire and Hitler.”</p>
<p>Acting on the basis of this analysis, the SGP initiated a struggle against militarism and war, and the rise of the far-right, including an exposure of the efforts of Baberowski and other academics to rewrite German history to trivialise the crimes of the Nazis.</p>
<p>Baberowski’s rewriting of history was embraced by a supportive media and political establishment, which saw it as an essential component of its ideological struggle to break widespread popular opposition to the revival of German militarism. Baberowski even received generous support from international academic institutions, with a $300,000 research grant given to him by Princeton University to study dictatorships as an “alternative political order” to democracy.</p>
<p>The Times’ revelations make clear that at the very point where Baberowski was being defended against all criticism, fascists and other far-right activists were infiltrating the police, army and security forces, and making concrete preparations to establish death squads to eliminate political opponents. At the same time, the German army was being deployed to an ever growing number of foreign imperialist interventions, above all in Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<p>Underscoring that the main source of support for the fascists was provided by the conspiracy within the political establishment and state apparatus, the ruling class launched a vicious persecution of those political forces waging a struggle against militarism and warning of the fascist threat. In 2018, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, Germany’s domestic intelligence agency, included the SGP as a “left-wing extremist” organisation in its annual report and declared it an “object of surveillance.” The agency justified this flagrant attack on democratic rights by stating that “the struggle for a democratic, egalitarian, socialist society” and “agitation against alleged ‘imperialism’ and ‘militarism’” are anti-constitutional, i.e., illegal. The intelligence agency was headed at the time by Hans-Georg Maassen, who after being forced out of his job for declaring his support for a fascist rampage through the city of Chemnitz emerged as an open supporter of the AfD.</p>
<p>The political establishment also encouraged the growth of the AfD during this period and integrated it fully into the structures of the state. This reached a high point earlier this year when the Christian Democrats and Free Democrats relied on AfD votes in the state of Thuringia to elect FDP politician Thomas Kemmerich as Minister President. Kemmerich thus became the first Minister President in postwar Germany to have been elected with the support of a fascist party. (See: Sound the alarm! Political conspiracy and the resurgence of fascism in Germany)</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic has further accelerated the adoption of far-right and fascistic policies by the ruling elite. As the grand coalition unleashed its criminal back-to-work drive, which is endangering the lives of hundreds of thousands of workers, Federal Parliament President Wolfgang Schäuble advanced the fascistic thesis that Germany’s Basic Law does not protect the right to life. Triggering a discussion on “worthless lives” on the 75th anniversary of Hitler’s suicide in the Führer bunker, Schäuble declared, “If there is one absolute value in our Basic Law, then it is the dignity of the person … But that does not exclude us from having to die.”</p>
<p>To help impose the deeply unpopular policies of reopening businesses and schools, the authorities facilitated far-right coronavirus demonstrations that included right-wing extremist and explicitly pro-Nazi forces. At a demonstration of about 20,000 in Berlin last weekend organised primarily by far-right forces with ties to the police, intelligence agencies and the AfD, participants waved the flag of the German Reich and other anti-constitutional insignia as the police looked on. These orchestrated protests are then presented as a legitimate expression of the popular opinion of “concerned citizens” that politicians must respond to.</p>
<p>The symbiosis between German foreign policy and neo-fascist forces is also becoming increasingly difficult to conceal. At a recent event in Budapest, high-ranking officials of the German Defence Ministry celebrated with their Hungarian counterparts the delivery of around 50 German-manufactured “Leopard 2” tanks to the authoritarian Orbán regime. The tanks’ arrival was accompanied by the song “Tank March” by the fascistic band Kárpátia. According to Der Spiegel, Kárpátia’s music “glorifies the authoritarian, anti-Semitic Horthy period of the interwar years, and the struggle of the Hungarian soldiers allied with Hitler in the Soviet Union.” Der Spiegel continues, “In its lyrics, the band calls for an ethnically pure Greater Hungary from western Ukraine to the Croatian Adriatic coast.”</p>
<p>The German ruling elite’s embrace of the far right is part of an international process driven by the deepening global crisis of capitalism. in the United States, the Trump administration, which sought to launch a military coup in response to mass protests over police brutality in June, has dispatched federal agents clad in military gear from the fascistic Customs and Border Protection to intimidate peaceful protesters and detain them without probable cause. (See: Stop Trump’s coup d’etat! Mobilize the working class against authoritarianism and dictatorship)</p>
<p>The resurgence of right-wing extremism in Germany, which is now taking on the most disturbing forms as shown by the activities of terror cells and death squads, does not enjoy mass support. On the contrary, it is the product of a political conspiracy from above involving the major parties, the media, leading academics and journalists. As SGP deputy national secretary Christoph Vandreier explained in his book Why are They Back?: Historical Falsification, Political Conspiracy and the Return of Fascism in Germany, which documents the SGP’s struggle against the rise of the far right, “While the ruling elite based its conspiracy in 1933 on an existing fascist movement, today it is the opposite. The AfD’s rise is the product of a similar conspiracy. It cannot be understood without investigating the roles of the government, state apparatus, political parties, the media, and the ideologists at the universities, which have paved the way for the AfD.”</p>
<p>The only party that consistently fights against the growth of the AfD and the return of fascism and militarism in Germany is the Sozialistische Gleichheitspartei. Its warnings have been confirmed. The urgent task now posed is to build the SGP as a mass party of the German and international working class to provide the mounting opposition among working people to militarism, war and the rise of the far right with a conscious political leadership guided by a socialist and internationalist programme.</p>

<h3 id="nazi-war-criminals-ran-childrens-homes-in-post-war-germany-new-research">&ldquo;Nazi war criminals ran children&rsquo;s homes in post-war Germany: new research&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.dw.com/image/54524264_304.jpg" alt="img">
Nazi war criminals were allowed to run children&rsquo;s holiday homes in postwar Germany where draconian corporal punishment and bullying were normal, new research by public broadcaster ARD has shown.</p>
<p>ARD&rsquo;s investigative TV show Report Mainz has discovered that former SS officer Werner Scheu, convicted for his part in the murder of 220 Lithuanian Jews in 1941, ran a children&rsquo;s home named &ldquo;Möwennest&rdquo; (Seagull&rsquo;s Nest) on the German North Sea island of Borkum (pictured above) after serving his sentence.</p>
<p>One woman described being made to stand barefoot on a cold floor for hours overnight and on one occasion was locked in a sauna.</p>
<p>Another children&rsquo;s home director was Albert Viethen, a doctor and member of several Nazi organizations who was accused of euthanizing around 20 children under the Nazi regime. According to ARD, he was charged with accessory to murder in 1963 but the case against him was dropped for lack of evidence. Viethen ran a children&rsquo;s spa home named &ldquo;Schönsicht&rdquo; in Berchtesgaden, Bavaria, where several survivors described routine abuse.</p>
<p>New light shed on dark practice</p>
<p>The revelations add a new dimension to the experiences of so-called &ldquo;Verschickungskinder&rdquo; (&ldquo;sent-away children&rdquo;) and the special educational homes that existed in West Germany from the 1950s to the 1980s.</p>
<p>A newly-founded survivors&rsquo; initiative and self-help group has estimated that as many as 8-12 million children were sent to such homes in that period, often on the recommendation of doctors, schools, and youth welfare authorities, as &ldquo;spa treatment&rdquo; for young children paid for by public health insurers.</p>
<p>The stories of abuse have only just started to emerge in the media in the past few years, partly because local authorities have often denied the stories, on the grounds, for instance, that &ldquo;these are memories, not evidence,&rdquo; as journalist Lena Gilhaus was told in 2017, when she wrote about her father&rsquo;s experience for broadcaster Deutschlandfunk. Gilhaus&rsquo; investigative report, which cited a number of survivors&rsquo; reports, was among the first to draw attention to the fate of Germany&rsquo;s Verschickungskinder in the media.</p>
<p>Much of the evidence for the new investigation was based on the research of Anja Röhl, herself a survivor of a home in Hamburg, who collected 250 firsthand accounts over the past 10 years after she published an article in 2009 about her own experience. Her Verschickungskinder organization, which was founded two years ago, now has over 3,000 members.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was five years old when they sent me,&rdquo; she told DW. &ldquo;On the first day all the children were tied to their beds, and I got such shock. We were punished just for talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Read more: &lsquo;Daddy was a man of honor,&rsquo; daughter of Nazi officer insists</p>
<p>Röhl says the stories she collected were backed up by documents she found — particularly complaints filed by parents and youth welfare authorities. &ldquo;The children came back sicker than when they left, they were malnourished, had to be hospitalized,&rdquo; said Röhl. &ldquo;Sometimes they were so disturbed they didn&rsquo;t recognize their parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anja Röhl has founded the &lsquo;Verschickungskinder&rsquo; organization for victims — and it got 3,000 members within two years</p>
<p>These letters were often simply ignored by home directors, who were apparently protected by political interests, Röhl suspects. But most of the children, she says, were too ashamed or traumatized to talk about their experiences themselves.</p>
<p>In one particularly horrifying case described in by Report Mainz, one survivor reported eating the sleeve of his pajamas at the home and being too ashamed to tell his mother what had happened. In other cases, parents simply didn&rsquo;t believe their children&rsquo;s accounts.</p>
<p>Nazi connection</p>
<p>Röhl believes the connection between these homes to the old Nazi regime was strong, partly because the system of child holiday homes was originally founded in the 1930s. &ldquo;We believe that female personnel from concentration camps used the children&rsquo;s homes as places to flee to, where they could find work,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t know that for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Read more: Confronting a disturbing truth — &lsquo;My father was in the SS&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Nazi concept of human beings played a big role here we think,&rdquo; added Röhl, partly because the staff at the homes had largely been brought up under the Nazi regime.</p>
<p>The hundreds of memories she collected shared many common features: Children were subjected to a regime of extreme discipline, frequent corporal punishment, were separated from siblings, being left in solitary confinement, or made to sleep in the same room as older children who bullied them.</p>
<p>Terrible food was also a constant theme — survivors described being force-fed by having their hair tied to a table and tipped back, or being forced to eat their own vomit.</p>
<p>Röhl described how young children often returned from these homes traumatized; she heard stories of suicide attempts, of children who experienced depression, became aggressive, or did not speak for a year after returning home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came back different to how we went in,&rdquo; Röhl said. &ldquo;We came back injured and wounded, in our souls and physically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Röhl has now founded an initiative, which is calling for state governments to establish archives of documents related to the homes, along with survivors&rsquo; centers manned by survivor volunteers who can answer phone lines for people to report their own stories.

<h3 id="i-want-her-name-to-be-remembered-the-art-world-reflects-on-the-life-and-death-of-curator-rebeccah-blum">&ldquo;‘I Want Her Name to Be Remembered’: The Art World Reflects on the Life and Death of Curator Rebeccah Blum&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://news.artnet.com/app/news-upload/2020/07/image0.jpeg" alt="img">
The Berlin-based curator Rebeccah Blum died on June 22 at the age of 52. Reports that she had been murdered by her partner sent ripples of shock and pain through the international art world. An American who spent much of her career in Germany, Blum was a multifaceted art-world professional who worked as a dealer and curator and helped develop the careers of artists including Monika Baer and Jorinde Voigt.</p>
<p>Last Wednesday night, Blum’s longtime partner, artist Saul Fletcher, 52, is suspected to have killed Blum in their Berlin apartment before dying by suicide himself. A police report states that an investigation into a violent murder is ongoing, as well as Fletcher’s apparent suicide in their summer home shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>For many close to Blum, the media coverage of her death added more pain to an already horrific tragedy. Initial reports honed in on Fletcher’s “moody” art practice and his accolades, obfuscating the brutal nature of Blum’s killing, as well as her own accomplishments.</p>
<p>Details of the evening are also now coming into focus. Contrary to early coverage, the now-dead suspect did not call his daughter, or Blum’s daughter, to confess; instead, he called an unrelated friend, who called the police. A source close to the family says that authorities showed up at Blum’s daughter’s door at 3 a.m. looking for Fletcher, who it seems had driven from the apartment the couple shared to Blum’s summer cabin outside the city. He was later found dead.</p>
<p>As the news and fallout reverberated on social media, art-world figures, friends, and family offered a counter-narrative, drawing attention to Blum’s life. “I want her name to be remembered and nobody else’s,” wrote Blum’s daughter, Emma, in an Instagram post Wednesday.</p>
<p>A Talented and Well-Rounded Arts Professional</p>
<p>Who was Rebeccah Blum, and why wasn’t the question asked right away?</p>
<p>Those who knew her remember her as an intelligent, kind, and reliable person. A close friend and former roommate, Jane Rosenzweig, describes her as “present” and “curious.” Though they lived on separate continents, their lives often ran in parallel: they had kids around the same time, they got summer cabins—Blum loved her lakeside summer home in outside Berlin. Rozenszweig says they both met their partners around the same time, too.</p>
<p>In her professional life, Blum was an editor, publicist, coach, networker, curator, and art dealer. New York gallerist David Nolan, for whom Blum served as a European representative, said in an statement that she “was no ordinary American transplant on the Berlin art scene.” The two had met at the 2007 Venice Biennale, and the dealer recalled feeling struck by “her natural understanding of art and empathy for the underlying motivations of artists.”</p>
<p>Over the years, Blum introduced Nolan to several valuable talents, including Berlin-based Jorinde Voigt, whom he now represents.</p>
<p>Blum was born in Berkeley, California, in 1967 to Susan Bockius, an author, and Mark Blum, a professor. She studied art history in Washington, DC, before arriving in Germany in the early 1990s, where she spent years in the Düsseldorf art scene, then the beating heart of the German art world, before relocating to the still-fledgling arts hub of Berlin. Marie-Blanche Carlier from Berlin gallery carlier | gebauer recalls learning from a mutual friend that Blum had encouraged several artists to move from Düsseldorf to Berlin, and often hosted them in the German capital. “Rebeccah was creative, funny, generous, open-minded—one could always stay for diner she would magic something spontaneously,” Carlier told Artnet News. “She was extremely engaged, serious, and precise in her passing of knowledge about the artists she promoted while remaining friendly and full of humor.”</p>
<p>After moving to Berlin, she was hired by gallerist Aurel Scheibler to help helm the ScheiblerMitte project space, which organized shows of Alice Neel, Michel Auder, and others. In 2012, Blum struck out on her own, working with artists, galleries, and collectors as a project manager through her own company, Blum Fine Art Management. Two years later, she established a project space with Kit Schulte called Satellite Berlin, which focused on interdisciplinary art engaged with the humanities and sciences. “We put our heart and soul” into the project, Schulte wrote in an obituary.</p>
<p>Blum was also a devoted mother. “She was fully committed to provide her daughter the best context and education to grow, which is not easy while having a career,” Carlier said. She wove her love of children into Satellite Berlin; photos from 2015 show Blum working with a third-grade class at the project space.</p>
<p>In 2017, she shifted gears to focus on editorial work, founding the Wordsmith, a translation and editing company. Her career was poised to take yet another turn just before her death. According to Rosenzweig, Blum had just gotten her Masters of Arts degree last month. Her thesis focused on storytelling as a strategy for intercultural audience development in cultural institutions. “Rebeccah wanted to stimulate the general dialogue between art and culture in a meaningful way, and to develop new content in collaboration with other areas,” Schulte wrote in her obituary.</p>
<p>“Her next career chapter was just beginning,” Rosenzweig added.</p>
<p>‘Misogynistic’ Reports and the Taboo on Femicide</p>
<p>While Blum’s untimely death—which comes shortly after the UN reported in April that gender-based violence was rising in many nations, including Germany—has been mourned in the German and US art scenes, it was accompanied by a swift outcry against initial reports in the Daily Mail, ARTnews, Monopol, and others that focused on Fletcher’s accomplishments; referred to the apparent murder-suicide as a “family drama”; and detailed his luxury car and friendship with Brad Pitt. On Wednesday, the Journal des Arts published a story titled “Who Is Saul Fletcher?” remarking that “the self-taught artist, who is said to have killed his partner, is known for his dark and melancholy photographs.”</p>
<p>In a Facebook post, artist Candice Breitz pointed out that “nearly every single piece of journalism covering the murder zooms in on the career achievements and art accomplishments of the Famous-Artist-Boyfriend.” She also points out that many reports avoided the term femicide. It was a sentiment echoed by swathes of social-media users; one called the coverage a “sickeningly misogynistic obfuscation.”</p>
<p>Many berated the art world specifically for its response. Berlin artist Julieta Aranda wrote in a post on art agenda that it “is remarkable that, in a field like contemporary art—which claims to be both adept at imagining the future and at proposing instances and avenues for social justice—it is as if no time has passed between 1985 and 2020.” The former date references artist Ana Mendieta’s death, for which her husband, artist Carl Andre, was acquitted of murder.</p>
<p>Some were also incensed by Fletcher’s galleries’ joint statement, which omitted the allegations of murder. “We are devastated, horrified, and shocked by the tragic loss of Rebeccah Blum and Saul Fletcher,” wrote Anton Kern Gallery in New York, Knust Kunz Gallery Editions in Munich, and Grice Bench in Los Angeles. “We are all distressed and confused. We offer our deepest condolences to their families and together we offer our support and help.” (Artnet News asked Knust Kunz and Kern to also respond to the criticisms around their statement, but did not immediately hear back.) Members of the Berlin community also noted that, despite the wave of coverage, Fletcher was not a particularly prominent or prolific artist: his last show in the German capital appears to have been at Galerie Neu in 2008. (His dealers did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation.) By now, many arts publications have published articles focusing on Blum’s life and accomplishments. Yet, for many, the tragic denouement is evidence that misogyny can inform even liberal and progressive factions of media. “You should get one thing right: There was this beautiful woman and human being, a charismatic personality of the Berlin art scene getting stabbed with a knife by her psychotic and latently aggressive lover, who happens to be an artist, not a bad one,” dealer Aurel Scheibler wrote in an email to Artnet News. “Rebeccah Blum was a mother, she was a member of our artistic community, she was a beautiful person who dearly deserves to be remembered as such,” read a joint statement from members of her professional community. “We want to recall her name, and firmly condemn the brutality that took her life away, a too well known violence that needs to stop.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, her 60 year old fiance (suspect) has allegedly committed suicide by jumping from the 13th floor of an apartment building which they were living in.</p>
<p>Zambia’s First Secretary for Press and Public Relations Kellys Kaunda has revealed this in a statement.</p>
<p>And Kaunda said Zambia’s Ambassador to Anthony Mukwita has expressed sadness on the matter.</p>
<p>Mukwita narrated that Nyemba escaped her attacker’s attempt to strangle her to death in her sleep around 9hrs on Monday morning.</p>
<p>He said reports from police investigations revealed that Nyemba’s fiancé used a rope and tied it around her neck and began to violently squeeze it with the aim to murder her.</p>
<p>“He then used a pillow to suffocate her but failing, he attempted to reach for a knife which gave Nyemba a slight chance at escaping. The balcony was the only available option,” said Mukwita.</p>
<p>He added that eyewitness said Nyemba jumped from the second floor or 9 meters down and lay motionless on the ground as neighbors called for an ambulance.</p>
<p>Mukwita said as the medics were attending to Nyemba, a man, later identified as Nyemba’s fiance fell down from the 13th floor of the apartment building and died instantly.
