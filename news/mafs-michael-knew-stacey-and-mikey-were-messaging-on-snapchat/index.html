Married At First Sight&rsquo;s Michael Goonan and Stacey Hampton finally called it quits during Sunday night&rsquo;s season finale.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old company director was unable to get over his suspicions that his &lsquo;wife&rsquo; had slept with another groom, Mikey Pembroke, earlier in the season.</p>
<p>And speaking to 9Now on Monday, Michael revealed that he had already suspected something was going on between Stacey and Mikey weeks before their alleged one-night stand was exposed at the reunion dinner party.</p>
<p>Scroll down for video</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sneaky form of messaging&rsquo;: Married At First Sight&rsquo;s Michael Goonan (pictured) already suspected something was going on between his &lsquo;wife&rsquo;, Stacey Hampton, and Mikey Pembroke weeks before their alleged one-night stand was exposed at the reunion dinner party</p>
<p>Michael claimed he had discovered they were messaging each other on Snapchat the night before the infamous &lsquo;Hayley incident&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Hayley incident&rsquo; (referring to the night he got drunk and kissed another bride, Hayley Vernon, behind Stacey&rsquo;s back) took place during an 11-day production break in either late September or early October. The reunion dinner party was filmed on January 15.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I seen the night before [kissing Hayley], Stacey was getting messages on Snapchat from Mikey. And I was like, &ldquo;What the hell&rsquo;s going on?&quot;&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re just friends, we&rsquo;re just friends&rdquo;. Well, don&rsquo;t write on Snapchat. Sneaky form of messaging, do you know what I mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What the hell&rsquo;s going on?&rsquo; Michael apparently discovered Mikey (left) and Stacey (right) were messaging each other on Snapchat the night before the infamous &lsquo;Hayley incident&rsquo;</p>
<p>Later that night, fellow groom Ivan Sarakula had a beer with Michael and told him Stacey and Mikey were messaging and had arranged to meet for coffee.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I blew up, I was like &ldquo;Mikey&rsquo;s a dog!&rdquo; Like, what the hell?&rsquo; Michael said.</p>
<p>According to Michael, Mikey then came to his room and the pair agreed to discuss the matter off camera. Mikey apparently said that he and Stacey were &lsquo;just mates&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He [Mikey] goes, &ldquo;She asked me for coffee&rdquo;. And I knew that he was telling the truth. And I was like &ldquo;Dude, I really like her. Back off,&quot;&rsquo; Michael added.</p>
<p>Timeline: &lsquo;The Hayley incident&rsquo; (referring to the night Michael got drunk and kissed another bride, Hayley Vernon, behind Stacey&rsquo;s back) took place during an 11-day production break in either late September or early October. The reunion dinner party was filmed on January 15</p>
<p>Michael went on to explain that he partied with Hayley in Chris Nicholls and Vanessa Romito&rsquo;s room later that night, a decision he now &lsquo;regrets&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was there. Hayley was in the room and stuff. I lost a level of respect for Stacey with what Mikey had told me. I still shouldn&rsquo;t have been in that room, I still shouldn&rsquo;t have done that. It was a juvenile way to handle it,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>Michael&rsquo;s alleged kiss with Hayley happened that night and became the focus of much of the season until the reunion dinner party when Stacey and Mikey&rsquo;s rumoured affair took centre stage.</p>
<p>He added: &lsquo;[Stacey] made me feel so guilty, really crippled me. Yet, [she] had this massive secret&hellip; this whole time. Stacey denied it to the end, denied it to the end. But honestly, I know it&rsquo;s true. I know for a fact it&rsquo;s true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Michael is now dating another MAFS bride, KC Osborne, and the couple are currently self-isolating together in Melbourne amid the coronavirus pandemic.

<h3 id="mafs-2020-michael-goonan-on-the-moment-he-realised-stacey-hampton-definitely-cheated">MAFS 2020: Michael Goonan on the moment he realised Stacey Hampton definitely cheated</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.who.com.au/media/59104/stace.jpg" alt="img">
&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t add up.&rdquo; YouTube</p>
<p>While he says he desperately wanted to believe the woman he fell in love with on the dating experiment, proof they were messaging was the final nail in the coffin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she says there&rsquo;s no messages, and out comes the phone,&rdquo; he said, still baffled she&rsquo;s still lying about sleeping with Mikey. &ldquo;I still wanted to defend her and I think the world of her. She&rsquo;s a great mum, lovely person and sat on a big secret, which would have been really hard to handle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What bothered Michael most, however, was the fact she made him feel guilty for a drunken kiss when she was hiding a more sinister secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She made me grovel and jump through hoops and feel so guilty, she really crippled me. It was one of the hardest things I&rsquo;ve ever had to face,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Especially in front of everybody. It was gut-wrenching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They are no longer on speaking terms. Nine</p>
<p>So what happened after the dinner party wrapped and the cameras stopped rolling? Michael told Nova 100’s Chrissie, Sam &amp; Browny that he tried to chat with Stacey about these damaging allegations, however, she&rsquo;d dug a hole too deep to claw her way out of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She continued to tell me it never happened. I said there was too much doubt for me to continue in this catastrophe so let’s just have a hug and I’ll see you later,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But she said she didn&rsquo;t want to hug me&hellip; At the end of the day, I should be the one sort of stamping my feet and saying that I&rsquo;m the victim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Stacey maintains Mikey created this scandal in an attempt to grab headlines, he recently passed a polygraph test, scoring far above the standard number for truthful answers.</p>
<p>After four hours of rigorous questioning, the polygraph expert said: &ldquo;It is my opinion that you are in fact being truthful to that issue. There was no strong emotional responses indicative of deception to the declaration.&rdquo; The controversial groom obtained an average of 10 on each answer— a truthful answer should be three or more meaning he more than tripled the required criteria.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re set to see the former couple go head to head on Sunday night. Nine</p>
<p>In spite of, Stacey has been questioning the legitimacy of his polygraph results and spoke to a trained polygraph operator who suggested his test was inaccurate because he wasn&rsquo;t asked directly whether they had an affair.</p>
<p>As we know, before undergoing the examination, Mikey wrote in a declaration: &ldquo;I, Michael Pembroke do hereby declare that while at the Sky Suites apartments I had sexual intercourse with Stacey Hampton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we were doing it we would ask the person directly, &lsquo;Did you have sexual intercourse with such and such?&rsquo; We wouldn&rsquo;t get the examinee to sign a statement and then test him on what was written on the statement,&rdquo; the polygraph expert told Stacey in a video she recorded and shared to her Instagram story. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one step removed and it&rsquo;s not addressing the issues, it&rsquo;s about the statement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His polygraph test is not credible.&rdquo; Instagram</p>
<p>Moments later, Stacey shared a message on her Instagram story that read: &ldquo;The company I called explained that they saw footage of Mikey and said that is an incorrect way to do a polygraph test.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She fired up reality star continued: &ldquo;You do not ask someone to write a statement then refer the questions to the statement. Rather, you simply ask direct questions. Anyone can say anything in statements. His polygraph test is not credible. Case closed. Don&rsquo;t ever mention any &ldquo;M&rdquo; word or name to me again. Unless it&rsquo;s money. LOL.&rdquo;
