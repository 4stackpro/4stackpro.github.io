PETALING JAYA: Only one of the infected people staying at Menara City One condominium tower on Jalan Munshi Abdullah was linked to the Sri Petaling Mosque tabligh cluster, said a spokesman from the Menara City One management company.</p>
<p>The rest were from one family living in two separate units in the condominium.</p>
<p>“The 12 people who were tested positive for Covid-19 are from just one (foreign) family, so it&rsquo;s not fair to say that many people were infected because the building has a high concentration of foreigners living there,&rdquo; said the spokesman on Tuesday (March 31).</p>
<p>“The 12 people infected are from a big family, who must have got it via close proximity,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Menara City One on Jalan Munshi Abdullah, Kuala Lumpur, was placed under enhanced movement control order (MCO) on Monday (March 30).</p>
<p>Defence Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaacob said this was done after the Health Ministry linked 17 confirmed Covid-19 cases to the building.</p>
<p>The enhanced MCO will affect 3,200 residents in the 502 condominium units and premises in the tower.</p>
<p>“I would say 70% are foreigners living here; these are people who are working in and around the Masjid India area,&rdquo; said the spokesman.</p>
<p>“Due to the restriction, the management has left the numbers for the people (in the condo) to contact us if they need us to buy them food and essentials,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>“This service is not for everyone, but those in need like the elderly and the sick,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Based on advice from the Health Ministry, the enhanced MCO will be put in the place from March 31 to April 13, to allow the tracking of cases from unit to unit within 14 days.</p>
<p>Visitors are not allowed to enter the condominium block and all business activities are to be stopped immediately, except for those selling essentials.

<h3 id="govt-places-menara-city-one-in-kl-under-lockdown-after-17-covid-19-infections-reported">Govt places Menara City One in KL under lockdown after 17 Covid-19 infections reported</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets.theedgemarkets.com/coronavirus_20200225155128_123rf_18.jpg?null" alt="img">
KUALA LUMPUR (March 30): The government has ordered that Menara City One, located at Jalan Munshi Abdullah here, be placed under Enhanced Movement Control Order (EMCO) — its third such directive since the first one was issued on Thursday — after the condominium reported 17 confirmed Covid-19 cases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking into account the number of cases, the government on the advice of the health minister has decided to implement the third imposition of the Enhanced Movement Control Order,&rdquo; defence minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said in a statement today.</p>
<p>The two-week EMCO, which will take effect from midnight until April 13, 2020, will affect 3,200 residents in the condominium&rsquo;s 502 residential units and business premises.</p>
<p>Ismail said the EMCO was imposed to curb the infection of Covid-19 from being transmitted outside of the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This move will enable case detection activities to be done on each of the units [in the condominium] over the 14-day period.&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Similar to EMCOs announced previously, the order bars all residents in the condominium from leaving their units during the EMCO. Non-residents and visitors are also not allowed to enter the area during the EMCO period, while all business activities will be suspended.</p>
<p>However, residents are allowed to order food that can be delivered to the main lobby of the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To ensure compliance of this order, the Royal Malaysian Police, the Malaysian Armed Forces, the Malaysian Civil Defence Force (APM) and the People&rsquo;s Volunteer Corps will control the entire area,&rdquo; Ismail said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the implementation of this order, all residents should remain calm and give full cooperation to the Ministry of Health personnel as well as to follow orders from authorities,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Those who need assistance or information can direct their queries to 03-2694 3243/ 03-4026 7222 or 013-329 5141.</p>
<p>Starting with Kampung Dato’ Ibrahim Majid and Bandar Baharu Dato’ Ibrahim Majid — two places in Simpang Renggam, Kluang, Johor — the EMCO has also been imposed on seven villages located at Batu 21 to Batu 24 in Sungai Lui, Hulu Langat, Selangor.</p>

<p><img src="https://assets.theedgemarkets.com/covid-19_20200401020911_123rf.jpg?null" alt="img">
PUTRAJAYA (March 31): The Health Ministry (MoH) has found that the Covid-19 cases detected at the Menara City One condominium tower in Kuala Lumpur are linked to the Sri Petaling mosque tabligh cluster.</p>
<p>Health director-general Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said the index case at the building had attended the tabligh gathering at the Sri Petaling mosque.</p>
<p>“The index case then went on to infect 12 members of his family in the building.</p>
<p>“The number of cases rose drastically after that, up to 17 cases, which led to the building being subjected to the Enhanced Movement Control Order (EMCO),” Dr Noor Hisham said at the COVID-19 daily media briefing at the ministry here today.</p>
<p>The government enforced the EMCO on Menara City One, located in Jalan Munshi Abdullah, Kuala Lumpur effective today until April 13.</p>
<p>Dr Noor Hisham added that the MoH has been screening every unit at the condominium tower since yesterday.</p>
