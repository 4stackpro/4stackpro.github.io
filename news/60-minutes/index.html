<p>Tonight marks the opening of a new era in story telling for 60 Minutes. We are launching an innovative way for our one-of-a-kind reporting to reach a new and expanded audience on the mobile app Quibi.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve named it &ldquo;60 in 6&rdquo; and each week &ldquo;60 in 6&rdquo; will report an original story in a shorter, approximately six-minute form produced specifically for viewers watching on mobile devices.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve recruited a dedicated staff of correspondents, producers and editors from both inside and outside CBS News who are working to guarantee true 60 Minutes reporting and high standards to the stories in our new, mobile home. This week, we kick off with Pulitzer Prize winning correspondent Wesley Lowery reporting from Minneapolis with a view from that city you haven&rsquo;t seen before, including an interview with George Floyd&rsquo;s brother Philonise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see your brother and his story as part of a bigger, broader movement?&rdquo; Lowery asks Floyd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. People who knew my brother, they always say the same thing. Floyd, he died for a reason,&rdquo; Floyd says. &ldquo;I think this is the biggest civil right movement ever. People tired, man. Everybody wants to live on this earth and have peace. That&rsquo;s all I want is peace.&rdquo;

<h3 id="what-fall-sports-might-look-like-across-ncaa-campuses">&ldquo;What fall sports might look like across NCAA campuses&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/06/14/882441a8-2472-413b-99f6-db60aacac3ac/thumbnail/1200x630/a53cd30102280808d1d5014249206992/ot-collegedilemmafd.jpg" alt="img">
The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an added importance on summer planning from preschool to medical school. As the start of the next academic year approaches, America&rsquo;s higher education institutions must brace for a new set of challenges.</p>
<p>This week on 60 Minutes, correspondent John Dickerson reported on the next major obstacle to face colleges and universities – how and when to resume in-person instruction.</p>
<p>At The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, athletic director Bubba Cunningham is navigating another staple to campus life – collegiate athletics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the biggest decision for our campus is how do you restart the campus?&rdquo; UNC&rsquo;s Cunningham told Dickerson. &ldquo;When do you bring the students back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At UNC that means determining the safest way to welcome back about 30,000 students including roughly 800 student-athletes across 28 teams.</p>
<p>UNC Athletic Director Bubba Cunningham speaks with John Dickerson 60 Minutes/Eric Kerchner</p>
<p>The NCAA began allowing some voluntary practices on June 1 as long as schools adhere to local, state, and federal regulations pertaining to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Cunningham told 60 Minutes, student-athletes live both on and off campus making it difficult for them to remain in a quarantined bubble. In an effort to control any potential outbreak, he explains UNC has created a testing regimen that begins when athletes arrive on campus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each person that comes in the football building will be tested upon their first time back,&rdquo; Cunningham said. &ldquo;Then we will wait for the test results. Then we&rsquo;ll assess them from a physical standpoint. And then they&rsquo;ll be able to engage in voluntary activities. And then a week to 10 days later, they&rsquo;ll be tested again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About 500 miles southwest of Chapel Hill, North Carolina lies Birmingham, Alabama and the headquarters of the Southeastern Conference.</p>
<p>Its member schools have won six of the last ten Division 1 college football national championships. The pursuit of a seventh is supposed to begin in early September.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our focus is on playing the season as scheduled beginning Labor Day weekend,&rdquo; said Herb Vincent, Associate Commissioner at the SEC. &ldquo;If circumstances present themselves and we have to pivot and make adjustments we will do that, but we will do that when we have more information and we will be prepared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the outstanding information Vincent speaks of may help answer questions regarding fan attendance. Nine SEC football stadiums hold more than 75,000 people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right now [fan attendance] will be likely dictated by local and state information and regulations,&rdquo; Vincent told 60 Minutes. &ldquo;So right now it&rsquo;s not a decision we have to make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If fans can to attend games this fall, athletic director Cunningham and his team at The University of North Carolina are analyzing every detail of the fan experience ranging from parking, to stadium entry, to restroom use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we invite people back, we want them to be safe and confident that they will be safe,&rdquo; Cunningham said.</p>
<p>When it comes to seating fans, Cunningham told 60 Minutes the possibilities range from a general admission approach where fans can socially distance naturally to strategically dispersing season ticket holders throughout the stadium.</p>
<p>If there is not a fall athletic season or it is modified, colleges and universities will be forced to reconfigure their budgets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Football and basketball certainly provide an awful lot of revenue, if not all of the revenue for our department,&rdquo; Cunningham told 60 Minutes. &ldquo;We believe in the athletic experience, in how it enhances the educational experience on our campus. So we&rsquo;ll have to work through the financials, should we play or not play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The severity of the financial impact will vary by school.</p>
<p>In 2018, only 29 collegiate athletic departments generated more revenue than expenses, according to the NCAA. All of those programs were members of the ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, or SEC – a collective commonly known as the &ldquo;power five&rdquo; conferences.</p>
<p>The NCAA said that in 2018, athletic departments across its three divisions spent more than $18 billion, but only generated $10.3 billion in revenue.</p>

<h3 id="how-tulsas-greenwood-massacre-echoes-today">&ldquo;How Tulsa&rsquo;s Greenwood massacre echoes today&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/06/14/eef7d5b4-25ba-4e68-9dd8-37836bde63c0/thumbnail/1200x630/b1df1f927206101abdff0ad1ccd1d5c1/ot-tulsa.jpg" alt="img">
Until recently, the memory of what happened in Tulsa&rsquo;s Greenwood neighborhood had been buried with its victims. Today, exhuming the city&rsquo;s past also means confronting its present.</p>
<p>Once a thriving Black community, Greenwood was built on oil and the wealth that springs from its wells. Booker T. Washington had called it &ldquo;Negro Wall Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in 1921, a White mob destroyed Greenwood. Fueled by allegations that a Black teenager attacked a White female elevator operator, the mob burned the neighborhood to the ground, killing as many as 300 people and leaving thousands homeless. The local police joined the mob, as did National Guard troops, who attacked what one guard officer reportedly called &ldquo;the enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many of the dead were then dumped into unmarked graves.</p>
<p>From the archives: Tulsa burning</p>
<p>When 60 Minutes producer Nicole Young and correspondent Scott Pelley set out to tell the story of the Greenwood massacre for this week&rsquo;s broadcast, they visited the Vernon AME Church. In 1921, the mob had burned the church, leaving only its basement intact. Once the smoke cleared, Greenwood residents returned to that basement to resume worship, and as the community rebuilt, the church became its spiritual heart.</p>
<p>At the church last December, Young and Pelley assembled members of the congregation and asked them to tell the oral histories they had learned about Greenwood from generations past. Many people said their families had been afraid to speak of the massacre, for fear of retribution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t talk about it in our family,&rdquo; said Therese Anderson Adoonie, a Tulsa resident. &ldquo;But what I do know is that my father grew up watching them rebuild from ashes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among those who had gathered to tell their ancestors&rsquo; stories was Rev. Joey Crutcher, whose grandmother had survived the Greenwood massacre before fleeing Tulsa. Almost a century later, Crutcher&rsquo;s son, Terence, was shot dead by a White police officer in the same city.</p>
<p>In 2016, Betty Jo Shelby fatally shot Terence Crutcher as he was standing next to his vehicle in the middle of a street. He was unarmed. Although a jury later acquitted Shelby, who now works as a deputy sheriff in a neighboring Rogers County, the shooting spurred protests and renewed a national debate over race and policing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was absolutely no justification whatsoever, with all the backup, for Officer Shelby to pull that trigger,&rdquo; Tiffany Crutcher, Terence&rsquo;s sister, told 60 Minutes&rsquo; Bill Whitaker in 2017.</p>
<p>From the 60 Minutes archives: The Terence Crutcher shooting</p>
<p>Just as Crutcher&rsquo;s death drove people to the street in protest, the death of George Floyd in the hands of Minneapolis police last month has once again inflamed the conversation about police violence and racial bias.</p>
<p>In Tulsa, it is a debate that has continued for almost a century.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tulsa still has a deep racial divide,&rdquo; 60 Minutes&rsquo; Young said. &ldquo;You still have a Black side of Tulsa. You still have a White side of Tulsa. There&rsquo;s still a railroad track dividing both sides of the town and a highway that was built in the &rsquo;60s right through Greenwood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Floyd&rsquo;s death on Memorial Day—the same week the Tulsa race massacre occurred 99 years ago—the Rev. Robert Turner of Vernon AME church led a protest through Tulsa to remember Black Americans who have been killed. The crowd chanted Terence Crutcher&rsquo;s name, among others, &ldquo;whose lives were taken by racists in power—their perpetrators not brought to justice,&rdquo; Rev. Turner wrote in a statement.</p>
<p>In Tulsa, long-sought justice will be the focus next month as test excavation begin searching for the remains of the victims murdered almost 100 years ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The massacre was always important, which is why 60 Minutes was there,&rdquo; Young explained. &ldquo;But now, seeing the heartache of a nation, of a community, of a people, understanding the dark history of America in all its ugly forms, all of the hard conversations are more important now than they ever have been.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="sunday-tv-wrap-60-minutes-hands-nine-a-big-win-as-big-brother-slides">&ldquo;Sunday TV Wrap: 60 Minutes Hands Nine A Big Win, As Big Brother Slides&rdquo;</h3>

Last night’s 60 Minutes – that included claims into branch stacking in the Labor party – may not have lived up to the pre-marketing hype but it still managed some big numbers for Nine.</p>
<p>The stalwart current affairs show pulled an impressive 827,000 viewers according to OzTAM metro numbers and was the fifth most-watched show of the evening.</p>
<p>In the battle of the entertainment shows, 10’s MasterChef (945,000) narrowly pipped The Voice (924,000), while Seven’s Big Brother could only manage an eviction-high of 695,000.</p>
<p>Nine easily won the night with 32 per cent of all the eyeballs (all channels). That left Seven with 25.1 per cent, 10 took 20.7 per cent, the ABC had a neat 15 and SBS did 7.2 per cent.</p>
<p>In the battle of the 6pm news bulletins, Seven (1.152 million) saw off Nine (1.059 million).The ABC’s 7pm news pulled 671,000.</p>
<p>Seven’s AFL coverage pulled 346,000 while NRL on Nine did 245,000. However, this obviously doesn’t include Kayo and Foxtel viewers or those in pubs and clubs.</p>
<p>Over at the ABC, its standouts were Operation Buffalo (500,000) and Grand Designs (495,000).</p>
<p>For 10, The Project posted 501,000, FBI: Most Wanted did 361,000 and 10 News First did 330,000.

<h3 id="adem-somyurek-quits-victorian-labor-party-after-60-minutes-airs-allegations-of-branch-stacking-offensive-language">&ldquo;Adem Somyurek quits Victorian Labor Party after 60 Minutes airs allegations of branch stacking, offensive language&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.abc.net.au/cm/rimage/6654518-16x9-large.jpg?v=4" alt="img">
The MP appointed by Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews to replace Adem Somyurek as Local Government Minister appears to be ineligible to join Cabinet, due to a constitutional limit on the number of Lower House MPs allowed in the Ministry.</p>
<p>Key points: Mr Somyurek has resigned from the Labor Party, after federal Labor leader Anthony Albanese backed a move to expel him</p>
<p>Mr Somyurek has resigned from the Labor Party, after federal Labor leader Anthony Albanese backed a move to expel him The former powerbroker apologised &ldquo;unequivocally&rdquo; for the misogynistic language he used against colleague Gabrielle Williams</p>
<p>The former powerbroker apologised &ldquo;unequivocally&rdquo; for the misogynistic language he used against colleague Gabrielle Williams But he indicated he would mount a &ldquo;rigorous&rdquo; defence against the branch-stacking allegations made by Channel Nine</p>
<p>Mr Andrews sacked Mr Somyurek from his Cabinet this morning, after Channel Nine aired allegations of branch stacking and a recording of him using offensive language about a ministerial colleague.</p>
<p>Nine&rsquo;s 60 Minutes program last night aired alleged recordings of the former Labor powerbroker and Upper House MP in which he disparaged Gabrielle Williams, the Minister for Prevention of Family Violence.</p>
<p>Mr Somyurek said the recordings were of private conversations between him and a long-time friend and political ally, and he would be seeking a police investigation into the use of video footage secretly filmed from inside the electorate office of a Federal MP.</p>
<p>The program also aired allegations Mr Somyurek was involved in branch stacking on an &ldquo;industrial scale&rdquo;, a claim strenuously rejected by Mr Somyurek.</p>
<p>Mr Somyurek has this morning resigned his Labor Party membership, after Mr Andrews and federal Labor leader Anthony Albanese moved to expel him from the party.</p>
<p>Branch stacking occurs when large groups of people are recruited to become members of a local political party branch and instructed on how to vote on key internal party decisions, including preselection for seats in Parliament.</p>
<p>Premier&rsquo;s chosen replacement may be ineligible</p>
<p>This morning, Mr Andrews said Essendon MP Danny Pearson would be sworn in to replace Mr Somyurek as Local Government Minister.</p>
<p>But the Premier&rsquo;s new pick may lose his role before he begins, because the appointment appears to be in breach of the Victorian constitution.</p>
<p>Under the constitution, no more than 17 MPs from the Lower House can sit in Cabinet.</p>
<p>Mr Somyurek was one of six Upper House ministers, while Mr Pearson is from the Lower House and has become the 18th minister from that chamber.</p>
<p>The Premier&rsquo;s office has been contacted for comment.</p>
<p>Adem Somyurek was appointed Minister for Local Government and Small Business in 2018. ( AAP: Julian Smith, file photo )</p>
<p>Earlier, Mr Andrews said decisions made by Mr Somyurek as Local Government Minister would not be reviewed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The minister has taken forward positions endorsed by Cabinet. He has made a number of different positions pursuant to his role as minister,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not aware of any reason to go back over those or to be concerned about those.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He also said two other ministers named in the 60 Minutes program, Marlene Kairouz and Robin Scott, had assured him they acted appropriately &ldquo;at all times&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As a result, he said they would not be removed from Cabinet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those claims will be tested, there will be an investigation conducted, not by me, that would not be appropriate, an investigation by Victoria Police and IBAC and they will make findings if they choose to and they will do that in their own time at arm&rsquo;s length from the Victorian Government,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Opposition Leader Michael O&rsquo;Brien accused the Premier of running a &ldquo;protection racket&rdquo; for the ministers, who he said should stand down while the matters raised in the report were investigated.</p>
<p>Premier denounces Mr Somyurek&rsquo;s &lsquo;deplorable&rsquo; comments</p>
<p>Mr Andrews said he sacked Mr Somyurek at a 9:00am meeting and any suggestion he was given the opportunity to resign was &ldquo;simply false&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not worthy of an opportunity to resign. He was sacked. And that is the fact of the matter,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His conduct and his comments are completely deplorable, they are shameful and it is on that basis that there is no place in my Government for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Andrews said he had instructed the Attorney-General Jill Hennessy to refer the allegations to both Victoria Police and the state&rsquo;s Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (IBAC).</p>
<p>In a statement, Ms Williams thanked the community for its support and said Mr Somyurek&rsquo;s words would not &ldquo;derail&rdquo; efforts to prevent violence against women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Violent, misogynistic language perpetuates the attitudes and behaviours that enable a culture of violence against women,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether at home, in the street, at work or in the halls of Parliament, this language is unacceptable — when it does occur, it must be called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today and every day, this Government is working tirelessly to end violence against women and build a gender equal Victoria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night was another reminder of how important this work is, and how much work there is still left to do. Words spoken by one man will not derail this work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MP resigns Labor Party membership</p>
<p>In a statement, the Labor Party&rsquo;s national president, Wayne Swan, said Mr Somyurek had resigned his party membership and the National Executive Committee had taken further steps to ensure there would &ldquo;never be a place for Mr Somyurek in the ALP ever again&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The conduct of Mr Somyurek is reprehensible and at odds with everything the ALP stands for,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ALP National Executive takes these matters incredibly seriously, and will be responding to the wider issues raised over the last 24 hours in the coming days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Earlier, Mr Andrews said he &ldquo;no longer&rdquo; regarded Mr Somyurek as part of the Victorian Labor team and had contacted the National Executive Committee requesting Mr Somyurek&rsquo;s expulsion from the party.</p>
<p>When asked whether there would be an internal review of allegations of branch stacking in the Labor Party, Mr Andrews said he had had &ldquo;numerous conversations&rdquo; with federal Labor leader Anthony Albanese and there would be &ldquo;more to say about those matters soon&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Space to play or pause, M to mute, left and right arrows to seek, up and down arrows for volume. Watch Duration: 1 minute 56 seconds 1 m 56 s Anthony Albanese has backed the expulsion of Adem Somyurek from the Labor Party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not necessarily announcing a review, I&rsquo;ll be announcing a number of steps that will deal with those issues,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Mr Albanese backed Mr Andrews&rsquo;s move to expel Mr Somyurek, whose conduct he labelled &ldquo;a corruption of the political process&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has no place in the Australian Labor Party,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He described branch stacking as a &ldquo;scourge&rdquo; which took away the power and influence of people who joined the Labor Party out of a desire to improve their community.</p>
<p>Mr Somyurek vows to mount &lsquo;rigorous defence&rsquo; against branch-stacking claims</p>
<p>Earlier, Mr Somyurek released a statement in which he said he had resigned from Cabinet but that he would put up a &ldquo;rigorous defence&rdquo; against any party process over the branch-stacking allegations:</p>
<p>This morning I advised the Premier of my resignation as a Minister. It follows publication of numerous personal and private conversations between myself and a long term friend and factional ally of mine. It is clear that I was taped and surveilled in a Federal electorate office without my knowledge and that this material was published without my knowledge of its existence or my consent. I will be taking steps to seek a police investigation into these matters. With respect to allegations made around memberships of the party, I reject those and will be providing a rigorous defence during any party process. The conversations published without my knowledge or consent were with someone who I trusted about internal party matters. There are many robust discussions that occur on any given day in the Labor Party across all factions. However I accept and take full responsibility for the fact that my language on a number of occasions was simply not appropriate. While Ms Williams and I have been at odds factionally for many years, I should not have used the language I did about her and I apologise to her unequivocally. Further, I am deeply sorry for language I used regarding highly valued and exceptional young people who are members of the LGBTI community. These comments have quite rightly cost me my job.</p>
<p>Who is Adem Somyurek?</p>

<p>Mr Somyurek was first elected to Victorian Parliament in 2002 and was sworn in as minister for small business, innovation and trade in the Andrews Government in December 2014.</p>
<p>He was suspended and later sacked from Cabinet in 2015, after bullying allegations were made against him by a female member of his staff.</p>
<p>He was brought back into the Cabinet in 2018 after the Andrews Government won its second term in office.</p>
<p>At the time, Premier Andrews welcomed his &ldquo;good friend&rdquo; back, saying &ldquo;he&rsquo;s going to do a fantastic job&rdquo;.

<h3 id="appeals-board-protecting-federal-workers-unable-to-function-because-of-vacant-positions">&ldquo;Appeals board protecting federal workers unable to function because of vacant positions&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/06/14/a6f42e1b-68f3-42e5-bd66-55c6da863f66/thumbnail/1200x630/d1866cc09a088a9bae8a643aac7adaa7/emptychairsarticle0.jpg" alt="img">
This is a story about a small federal agency most Americans have never heard of called the Merit Systems Protection Board. It&rsquo;s meant to give 2 million federal civil service workers, including whistleblowers, a place to appeal should they be disciplined, demoted or fired. It&rsquo;s not that the board is working poorly, but that the board is not working at all. Since 2017, it has lacked enough members to pass judgement on any appeals, and for well over a year, the board has had no one on it, leaving three empty chairs and a backlog of cases that&rsquo;s now in the thousands.</p>
<p>Half a mile north of the White House, stands the unmarked headquarters of the Merit Systems Protection Board, or MSPB.</p>
<p>We got permission to visit in early February, before COVID-19 made working from home the norm. About 100 staffers were there, analyzing petitions from both federal workers and agencies about employment disputes.</p>
<p>Cases that would usually make their way to the board for a final ruling were instead going into storage, because the chairman&rsquo;s spacious office suite, as well as the vice-chairman&rsquo;s, and another for the third and final member of the board, were all empty, and not because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>President Trump has nominated people to fill all three open positions, but the nominations have languished in the senate, awaiting confirmation.</p>
<p>Jim Eisenmann: Without a board, without at least two board members, we&rsquo;re lost.</p>
<p>From 2010 to 2018, Jim Eisenmann worked for the chairman of the board, as general counsel and executive director.</p>
<p>Jim Eisenmann</p>
<p>Norah O&rsquo;Donnell: The Merit Systems Protection Board. Why should Americans know or care what that is?</p>
<p>Jim Eisenmann: This agency is there to help and protect federal employees from both bad supervisors and poor performers. And all you need is one bad employee, one bad supervisor for things to go amuck in any federal agency. And if you&rsquo;re getting your benefits, your services, whatever they are, safe drugs and medicine, you&rsquo;re gonna want this agency to be there to protect and&ndash; enforce the Federal Merit Systems.</p>
<p>Norah O&rsquo;Donnell: What are these Merit Systems&rsquo; principles?</p>
<p>Jim Eisenmann: That people will be hired based on merit, that they will not be discriminated against, that decisions will be based on their performance rather than someone&rsquo;s personal feeling about them.</p>
<p>Norah O&rsquo;Donnell: And has the board ever had so many vacancies for so long?</p>
<p>Jim Eisenmann: Never.</p>
<p>In a divided capital, the board stands apart in that by law, it is bipartisan. Only two of three members can be from the same political party. It was established 42 years ago, but its roots go back to the 19th century and Republican Teddy Roosevelt, who before becoming president, championed the creation of the U.S. Civil Service Commission, the precursor to today&rsquo;s board.</p>
<p>Debra Roth: The American public, you know, made a decision 140 years ago that they want their government run by qualified people. And they want it run efficiently.</p>
<p>Debra Roth</p>
<p>For 30 years, attorney Debra Roth has represented both federal agencies and employees in front of the board. She&rsquo;s worried about what the breakdown at MSPB means for the average citizen.</p>
<p>Debra Roth: MSPB is the one making sure that everyone&rsquo;s playing by the rules on the inside.</p>
<p>Norah O&rsquo;Donnell: So in effect, with no board, is there more waste, fraud, and abuse that&rsquo;s going on in government?</p>
<p>Debra Roth: Probably. It is the internal accountability for the rest of government. It&rsquo;s not like every case ends up at MSPB. So for statistics, you consider something like over two million people are part of the federal workforce in the Executive Branch. About every year, about 80,000 of them quit. Another 12,000 are getting fired for cause. And those people are probably the ones who are gonna end up, possibly, a portion of them, filing an appeal at MSPB.</p>
<p>Before a case gets to the board, it goes to an MSPB administrative judge who issues an initial decision. Only about 800 decisions a year then get appealed to the board. These days, with no one to rule on them, the cardboard boxes holding some of the nearly 2,900 cases in the backlog are stacked in multiple offices throughout the agency.</p>
<p>Jim Eisenmann: And each of those cases is an individual waiting for justice, and an agency waiting for certainty as to what&rsquo;s going to happen with that employee. Is that employee going back to work or are they not?</p>
<p>Traditionally the board gets involved in other cases at the request of the Office of Special Counsel, a federal watchdog that&rsquo;s supposed to protect whistleblowers, like Rick Bright.</p>
<p>Bright was the first federal official to publicly proclaim that the Trump administration&rsquo;s response to the pandemic was disorganized and so slow that it cost lives.</p>
<p>Rick Bright at Congressional hearing: If we fail to improve our response now based on science, I fear the pandemic will get worse and be prolonged.</p>
<p>Rick Bright</p>
<p>Before he testified before Congress, Bright filed a complaint with the special counsel alleging his bosses at Health and Human Services demoted him for sounding the alarm. The special counsel&rsquo;s office &ldquo;found a substantial likelihood of wrongdoing&rdquo; and asked HHS Secretary Alex Azar to give him his old job back while it investigated.</p>
<p>In April, Bright sat down with 60 Minutes.</p>
<p>Norah O&rsquo;Donnell: Our understanding is that the Merit Systems Protection Board could reinstate you at your job pending an investigation into your complaint. Had you ever heard of the MSPB before your complaint?</p>
<p>Rick Bright: No. Honestly, I hadn&rsquo;t. I&ndash; I&rsquo;ve learned though since my complaint that&ndash; that MSPB, that Merit Systems Protection Board is full of empty chairs.</p>
<p>Rick Bright&rsquo;s case may be the most high-profile impacted by the three empty chairs but it&rsquo;s not the only one to involve a whistleblower. After filing a Freedom of Information Act request, we learned about a quarter of the cases in the backlog include whistleblower claims. The backlog stretches across 55 federal agencies but the most whistleblower cases from one agency, 197, are from the Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA. One of them belongs to Chris Marcus.</p>
<p>Chris Marcus: I put my heart and soul into the VA because I knew we could fix it.</p>
<p>After graduating from the Air Force Academy in 1992, Marcus served for 20 years. In 2008 he helped run the U.S. military&rsquo;s busiest combat trauma hospital during the surge in the Iraq War. After retiring as a lieutenant colonel, Marcus was hired by the VA and eventually put in charge of three outpatient clinics serving approximately 80,000 veterans in Tennessee. He says members of his staff violated basic health and safety guidelines and mishandled patients&rsquo; medical files, but the worst problem he described was doctors who showed up late and sometimes disappeared, leaving elderly veterans waiting for hours.</p>
<p>Chris Marcus</p>
<p>Chris Marcus: If you can&rsquo;t get your staff to show up for work on time, then that&rsquo;s a problem. That&rsquo;s one of the accusations I had against me was that I would walk around the halls looking for people coming into work late. Like, I&rsquo;m guilty. (LAUGH) Yes, I did.</p>
<p>Norah O&rsquo;Donnell: What did you do?</p>
<p>Chris Marcus: A coworker and I, we would constantly elevating that to the&ndash; to the appropriate leadership, saying, &ldquo;We have got to do something about these providers.&rdquo; And&ndash; and nothing ever happened.</p>
<p>Norah O&rsquo;Donnell: When the VA fired you, what was their justification?</p>
<p>Chris Marcus: That I created a hostile work environment. That was pretty much it.</p>
<p>Norah O&rsquo;Donnell: The unprofessional behavior that you were accused of by the VA, is there any truth to it?</p>
<p>Chris Marcus: No, (SIGH) and&ndash; they gave me a stack of paperwork about this thick that was the evidence file used against me. And I&rsquo;m just thinking, &ldquo;Oh my goodness. What did I do?&rdquo; I mean, I really&ndash; racking my brain, &ldquo;What on earth did I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>An administrative judge ruled this past December that the only thing Chris Marcus did was his job. The judge wrote in his decision, the VA&rsquo;s allegation Marcus had been unprofessional &ldquo;lacked any factual basis,&rdquo; and that a VA executive, &ldquo;had [a] motive to retaliate against&rdquo; him. More importantly, the judge added Marcus was &ldquo;an employee that the VA should be seeking to retain and promote instead of removing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chris Marcus: He&rsquo;s absolutely right. I&ndash; I&ndash; I challenge anyone to find anything in that evidence package that&rsquo;s actually evidence of any conduct unbecoming or unprofessionalism. It&rsquo;s just not there.</p>
<p>The judge ordered the VA to reinstate Lt Col. Marcus and give him back pay and interest which at the time was upwards of $50,000. The VA refused and appealed to the board, but because no one was on it, the case and Marcus&rsquo; life entered a state of limbo.</p>
<p>Chris Marcus: Even if you win, you lose.</p>
<p>Norah O&rsquo;Donnell: Do you consider yourself a whistleblower?</p>
<p>Chris Marcus: I&rsquo;d never thought of me as being a whistleblower. I guess I am because I&rsquo;ve been identifying these things for years and my leadership retaliated against me for that.</p>
<p>In early April, five months after Chris Marcus&rsquo; case joined the backlog, we asked the VA about him. The VA declined to comment specifically, but two weeks later, offered him a settlement that included nearly a year&rsquo;s worth of backpay, plus interest, damages, legal fees, and a new job that allows him to work from home that he started last month.</p>
<p>Attorney Debra Roth does not represent Chris Marcus but says justice for others caught in the backlog will be harder to come by. An appeals process that used to take months will now take years. She says typically about 15% of those who appeal to the board end up getting their jobs back.</p>
<p>Debra Roth: And the longer it takes to get their job back, the clock is running because the board will determine that they were fired improperly, illegally, and the&ndash; the remedy will be that they will get a retroactive hiring and their back pay.</p>
<p>Norah O&rsquo;Donnell: There are government workers right now sitting at home, not working, who will eventually get back pay?</p>
<p>Debra Roth: Uh-huh (AFFIRM). A lot of it. At taxpayer expense.</p>
<p>Jim Eisenmann: For every single day, every single year that goes by without a decision, that&rsquo;s just more and more back pay for the individual, if they&rsquo;re being reinstated. That&rsquo;s more attorney fees. That&rsquo;s more interest. That&rsquo;s&ndash; just more money generally.</p>
<p>Former MSPB Executive Director Jim Eisenmann told us the prospective new board members face a daunting task, digging out from the nearly 2,900 cases piled up in their office.</p>
<p>Jim Eisenmann: It will probably take three to four years just for those cases to be decided by any board. If you had board members start today.</p>
<p>Norah O&rsquo;Donnell: That&rsquo;s justice delayed.</p>
<p>Jim Eisenmann: And denied. Absolutely.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to the reason we ever heard about the Merit Systems Protection Board in the first place: not a single board member has been confirmed by the Senate in over eight years, since April 2012.</p>
<p>60 Minutes has learned only one of the president&rsquo;s nominees faces serious opposition from senators in both parties. But if two of the other nominees were confirmed, the board could quickly get back to work.</p>
<p>We wanted to ask the most powerful man in the Senate, Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, why that hasn&rsquo;t happened yet. After his office ignored several of our inquiries, we went to the Capitol to ask him directly.</p>
<p>Norah O&rsquo;Donnell: This is a challenging time for federal workers, especially those on the frontlines of the coronavirus, so we wanted to know why has the Senate not confirmed any of President Trump&rsquo;s three nominees to the Merit Systems Protection Board?</p>
<p>Mitch Mcconnell: Well if they&rsquo;re out on the calendar, you&rsquo;d have to ask Senator Schumer.</p>
<p>We contacted the office of Senate Minority Leader Chuck sShumer, whose spokesman pointed out &ldquo;… Senate Majority Leader McConnell has full control over which nominees are voted on and which ones aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norah O&rsquo;Donnell: How does this happen? How does such an important government agency remain shut down for so long?</p>
<p>Jim Eisenmann: Negligence, if not an intentional failure to do a constitutional duty.</p>

<h3 id="60-minutes-remembers-a-horrific-incident-of-racial-injustice-largely-ignored-by-history--poynter">&ldquo;‘60 Minutes’ remembers a horrific incident of racial injustice largely ignored by history – Poynter&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.poynter.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image002-12-1.jpg" alt="img">
‘60 Minutes’ remembers a horrific incident of racial injustice largely ignored by history Your Friday Poynter Report</p>
<p>The Poynter Report is our daily media newsletter. To have it delivered to your inbox Monday-Friday, click here.</p>
<p>In describing a must-see report coming up this Sunday, CBS’s “60 Minutes” says the first time Americans were terrorized by an aerial assault was not Pearl Harbor. It was when an estimated 300 men, women and children were killed when aircraft dropped incendiary devices on a Black neighborhood in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1921. It became known as the Greenwood Massacre, or the Tulsa Race Massacre.</p>
<p>“60 Minutes’” Scott Pelley will look back on those horrific events that started when the city’s white newspapers reported a Black man was in custody for assaulting a White woman in an elevator. Black World War I veterans arrived at the jail to protect the man after there were calls to lynch him. Then armed White men attacked the vets and things soon spiraled out of control.</p>
<p>A mob attacked the vets in the Greenwood section of Tulsa, and the police and National Guard joined in. There were reports of machine-gun attacks, a Black man being dragged through the streets, a Black hospital being burned down and White hospitals refusing to take in injured Black people. There was no official word on exactly how many people died and were injured, but there were never any arrests.</p>
<p>It’s believed more than 1,250 homes were burned and another 215 were looted.</p>
<p>Perhaps more stunning is how this awful chapter in our history isn’t more widely known. Mark I. Pinsky mentioned it for Poynter last year in his “Maligned in Black and White” story about the role Southern newspapers played in racial violence.</p>
<p>But even in Tulsa, the story has gone unnoticed by many. In the “60 Minutes” piece, Tulsa native Damario Solomon-Simmons says, “When I went to (Oklahoma University) in 1998, I was sitting in a class of African American history, and the professor was talking about this place where black people had businesses and had money and had doctors and lawyers. And he said it was in Tulsa. And I raised my hand, I said, ‘No, I’m from Tulsa. That’s not accurate.’ And he was talking about this massacre riot. I said, ‘Man, what are you talking about?’ I said, ‘I went to school in Greenwood. I’ve never heard of this ever.’”</p>
<p>Many people haven’t. The “60 Minutes” piece is an important starting point.</p>
<p>Giant step</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette has been embroiled in controversy over a reporter being taken off the protest story because of what seemed to be a harmless tweet. You can catch up with what I wrote in Thursday’s newsletter.</p>
<p>Now another development: Giant Eagle, a huge supermarket chain that is a staple in western Pennsylvania, will no longer sell the Post-Gazette because of “recent actions by the publication.”</p>
<p>Giant Eagle president and CEO Laura Shapira Karet said in a statement, “It is critical that we uphold the values that have defined Giant Eagle for nearly 90 years. These measures will remain in place until the publication demonstrates an equal commitment to all those in the communities it serves.”</p>
<p>Meantime, while it appears the Post-Gazette leadership has made poor decisions, Post-Gazette pop music beat writer Scott Mervis tweeted, “I’ve never seen so much glee over the demise of a newspaper.”</p>
<p>He added, “I realize the managers made a bad decision and then refused to back down. But so many journalism jobs have been lost this decade. Can we maybe watch the PG go down in flames without celebrating?”</p>
<p>Going into quarantine to cover the NBA</p>
<p>The NBA hopes to return later this summer by having teams live and play in a bubble at the Disney/ESPN campus in Orlando for several months. Will the media be able to cover the rest of the season? Details are still being hammered out, but one option is having media members also enter the bubble with no option to re-enter if they were to leave. In other words, reporters would also be on quarantine lockdown for the rest of the season.</p>
<p>The Daily Beast’s Robert Silverman broke the story after obtaining an email sent by Professional Basketball Writers Association president Josh Robbins to PBWA members. Robbins stressed nothing is set, but that writers interested in covering games could be divided into two groups.</p>
<p>The first group would be tested daily and have access to players and coaches. They would be required to stay at Disney without leaving. The second group would be allowed to attend games, but could not interact directly with players and coaches.</p>
<p>What this all could mean is few writers and other media covering the games in person for two reasons. One, the expensive cost of being on the road for more than three months and, two, being forced to be on lockdown that long. In the memo to the PBWA, Robbins wrote, “None of this is ideal. But this is a uniquely challenging situation. The league’s primary mandate is to minimize the risk of any players or team personnel contracting the virus.”</p>
<p>It should be noted that many NBA players continue to have reservations about restarting the season, so this all could be moot.</p>
<p>Missouri update</p>
<p>On Thursday, I wrote about the family drama at the Missourian — a Washington, Missouri newspaper in which the co-owners resigned in protest after the paper ran a racist cartoon Wednesday of a Black man stealing a White woman’s purse. The cartoon was approved by the editor, Bill Miller Sr., who happened to be the father of the co-owners who resigned. Later in the night, Miller Sr. also resigned.</p>
<p>Thursday, the paper announced that the new interim editor and publisher will be Tricia Miller, the first female to hold the position in company history. She, too, is the daughter of Miller Sr. She comes to the Missourian after 33 years with the St. Louis Business Journal.</p>
<p>Media tidbits</p>
<p>NBC News’ Lester Holt will anchor a two-hour special Saturday night called “The Playbook” — a “Dateline” in-depth look at the coronavirus as it tops 2 million cases in the U.S. The show, which airs at 8 p.m. Eastern, will look at whether the coronavirus could have been contained or slowed had government agencies responded differently. There will be several guests, including U.S. Department of Health and Human Services secretary Alex Azar.</p>
<p>“60 in 6” — a news show which tells “60 Minutes”-style storytelling in six-minute segments — debuts Sunday on the streaming app Quibi. Here’s a trailer for the show and Brian Steinberg has a preview for Variety.</p>
<p>Audrey Cooper, who had been editor in chief of the San Francisco Chronicle, has been named editor in chief of WNYC. In a note to staff, Cooper wrote, “Public radio introduced me to the awesome power of fact-based storytelling to confront wrongdoing, to help us understand each other, and to produce enlightened citizens. That’s something this country needs more than ever.”</p>
<p>The Atlantic is taking its first step into feature documentaries with “White Noise” — an investigation of the rise of the racist right in America. Director Daniel Lombroso had access to the inner workings of the alt-right over several years of filming across 12 U.S. states, as well as Canada, France, Belgium and Russia. The film will make its debut on June 20 at the AFI Docs Film Festival. Lombroso wrote this piece for The Atlantic.</p>
