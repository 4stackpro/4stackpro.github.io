<p>Hyderabad: Training for recruits in the police force will be physically demanding and at times boring but a police officer in Telangana is proving that it can be made enjoyable. Assistant Sub-Inspector Mohammed Rafi is using the tunes of his legendary namesake to add fun to the drill practice for recruits in Telangana State Special Police.</p>
<p>With his innovative yet amusing style, this officer is pumping energy into the young recruits and at the same time providing them the much-needed entertainment. A video of Rafi‚Äôs fun-filled training is currently going viral on social media with many hailing him for his unique effort to make the drill enjoyable.</p>
<p>Netizens are amused over this officer‚Äôs moves and the body language as he uses the tunes of Mohammed Rafi‚Äôs memorable number ‚ÄòDhal Gaya Din‚Äô mixed with his own words to add exuberance to the drill.</p>
<p>The officer is heard singing a few lines from the popular song from Humjoli (1970) sung by legendary Mohammed Rafi and Asha Bhosle starring Jeetendra and Leena Chandavarkar. The policeman goes on to twist it with his own words to order the trainees to turn back during the drill. He also incorporated a few slogans hailing the role of police.</p>
<p>It was Hyderabad‚Äôs Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Anil Kumar who first tweeted the video hailing the officer‚Äôs effort with his comment ‚ÄòHats off to this drill instructor‚Äô. The video had over 1.11 lakh views in four days.</p>

The legend of the music industry Kishore Kumar won the hearts with his spectacular voice. He is the best and most excellent voice in the music industry. Let‚Äôs get closer to know more about his actual family.</p>
<p>The birth name of Kishore Kumar was Abhas Kumar Ganguly, born on 8th August in Madhya Pradesh. Born into a Bengali family, Kishore Kumar was the youngest of three older brothers and a sister. His father Kunjalal Ganguly was a lawyer and mother Gouri Devi, a homemaker.</p>
<p>Kishore Kumar was always passionate about singing as a kid. But people used to criticize him for not having the perfect voice. With the help of his brother Ashok Kumar, he joined acting and later switched to singing. But his brother was against him singing. His first marriage was with Ruma Guha Thakurta from 1950 to 1958. She was an actress and singer by profession. He had a son with her, Amit Kumar.</p>
<p>Later, Kishore Kumar married Madhubala, and their marriage lasted until she died in 1969. He then married Yogeeta Bail, but their marriage was against short-lived for three years. When he married Leena Chandavarkar, he had another son Sumit Kumar. Both his sons are singers.</p>
<p>Kishore Kumar‚Äôs life was filled with tragedy and was not so perfect. But surely he had perfection while singing. Today we have some great tracks that are spectacular and popular.</p>

This time, though, Dhawan is not alone and his wife Ayesha can also be seen in the video. With all sporting action on hold owing to the coronavirus crisis, top sporting stars around the world are using the time to connect with fans on social media.</p>
<p>In the short video, posted on Shikhar Dhawan‚Äôs Instagram account, the couple can be seen playing their own version of table tennis with the famous song ‚Äòjaane do jaana hai‚Äô from the movie ‚ÄòHumjoli‚Äô playing in the background.</p>
<p>In the video of the original song, actor Jeetendra and actress Leena Chandavarkar played badminton to the tune of the song. In their own rendition of the song, Dhawan and Ayesha played table-tennis.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHo gayi shaam jaane do jaana hai,‚Äù Dhawan captioned the post.</p>

<p>Had the 13th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) not been postponed owing to the coronavirus, Dhawan would have been playing for the Delhi Capitals.</p>
<p>Given how things stand, chances are that the cash-rich IPL might not be played at all although there are reports claiming that the organisers are looking at the October window for organising the tournament.

The pretty face of the Hindi film industry of the ‚Äô70s still glows warmly. The soft countenance and the innocent smile are still in place. No wonder, Leena Chandavarkar ‚Äî also known for her marriage to Kishore Kumar, who was 21 years older to her ‚Äî amazes you with her childlike simplicity. We caught up with the actress when she was in town recently to attend Tomay Poreche Mone ‚Äî Kishore Kumar‚Äôs 90th birth anniversary celebration. She spoke about her life, how films happened to her, Kishore Kumar and more. Excerpts:Kolkata is special, as it holds a connection with Kishoreda. When I visited the city with him, we used to go to villages for shows. That was a different kind of fun ‚Äî to see so many people travelling in packed buses just for the show. As for this visit, I‚Äôm here after a long time; I last came in 1992. I remember it was a tribute to Kishoreda called Dui Kishore. Even Rumadidi (Guhathakurta) was present at the show. There were many Bollywood stars in attendance, including Shammi Kapoor. As for going around town, though I wanted to, I‚Äôm here only for a couple of days.I have innumerable memories of him. He was like a pillar of strength who taught me to accept the good and bad in life. He looked at life as a whole and understood that you win some and lose some. He would show his funny side to the world, but never his sad face. He also taught me to do that. I went through a lot in life and it was only because of him that I could come out of depression. So, I have written this song for him now ‚Äî Kaun tha woh kya tha, Jadugar ya farishta tha, Athwa woh ajooba tha. Even he always wanted me to write songs. After he passed away, Amit (Kumar) asked me to fill in some dummy words, to which he gave the tunes and it got approved. So, I think it‚Äôs Kishoreda who has again guided me from heaven. His song, Hamein Aur Jeene Ki Chaahat Na Hoti, is one of my favourites because it resembles my relationship with him. He would also mention that he always came across talented people as life partners. True, you see Rumadidi was there. Amit received a letter from the President of India after Rumadidi passed away. That‚Äôs a great honour. Both of Amit‚Äôs parents were extremely talented people. He has also carved a niche for himself. It‚Äôs extremely difficult to match up to a father like Kishore Kumar, but he has done well for himself.I wouldn‚Äôt know what triggered this bond, but it feels like the expression, Sago se zyada apna. Amit respects his father a lot. He would always ask for his advice when taking an important decision. Sumit was only five years old when Kishoreda passed away, but he scolds me and tries to guide me now (laughs). Amit and Sumit have a beautiful bond between them. In fact, Amit brought up Sumit. If I would ever forget to pick up Sumit from school on time, Amit would leave his recordings and rush to his school. Then he would scold me. Now, the family is complete. But yes, adjustments are necessary in every family. Dadamoni ( Ashok Kumar ) would often say that he was surprised to see us functioning so well as one unit (smiles). He used to visit us often. We have a full house even now and relatives also keep visiting us.Kishoreda was the reason why I could successfully deal with all the pain in life. He could give strength to anyone. He would also say, ‚ÄòHum log travellers hain duniya mein. Kisiko first class milti hain, kisiko third class. Par free mein duniya dekhne ko saab ko milti hain na?‚Äô (laughs). I went through a lot in life. My brother committed suicide and my mother passed away just after Sumit was born. After Kishoreda passed away, I would depend a lot on tablets and injections to deal with depression. Then one day, Amit said he would be busy with shows abroad and that so, I‚Äôd have get out of my depression and take care of Sumit. So, a supportive family is extremely important. But to stay out of depression, you have to accept life the way it is.Kishoreda and I had many funny memories together. I had told him that he marries whoever he works with, so I wouldn‚Äôt do a film with him. He then cancelled the proposal because according to him, two August-born people shouldn‚Äôt marry each other. He was born on August 4 and I, on August 29. Then, when my father hurt me by saying ‚ÄòYeh phirse mere ghar wapas aa gayi‚Äô, I called Kishoreda to get married then and there because I wanted to leave my father‚Äôs house. I even called him up to say that I would ask the drivers of every car that passes me that night if they would marry me. He said, had he thought that only he was eccentric, but I had joined that list. My parents were apprehensive about me marrying him. My mother said he had married thrice, but wanted to know his ancestral origin. I told her he must be Christian since I had seen many statues of Christ and other biblical things at his house. Until our wedding, I never knew he was a Bengali Brahmin (laughs). He told me that he couldn‚Äôt marry me unless he got divorced from Yogita Bali, his third wife. He had stopped doing playback for Mithun (Chakraborty) at that time. Mithun did gauge the situation, but still came home to ask him why he wasn‚Äôt singing for him. After all, every hero wanted his voice in their songs. He told him about the divorce clause. Mithun saw to it that the divorce was through in no time. Then, I said, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs get married now‚Äô, but he said he wanted to get my parents‚Äô approval. He came home and sang till every member of the family agreed to our union, even my father. He sang Nafrat karne walo ke seene mein pyar bhar du, Arey mein woh parwana hu, Pathar ko moum kar du (laughs)!I wanted to carry on, but Kishoreda felt otherwise. According to him, I‚Äôd already tasted success in acting and received love and appreciation for it. But being a homemaker was new to me. After all, it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs deepest desire. Even I found his assertion that I needed to stay home with the children quite logical, as my kids needed me.For some people like me, dreams do come true. If you want to pursue something with all your heart, you don‚Äôt find the effort too difficult. I had learnt a lot from the superstars who were my co-stars. They were like family. Dilip Kumar would be so natural while acting that his voice would sound muffled at times like it does when we speak in our normal tone. I would often miss his dialogue cues (laughs). Shammi Kapoor would make me laugh a lot.Sunil Dutt discovered me and I debuted opposite him. This happened during my school vacation after my Class X exams. He even sent a man from his office looking for me at my maternal uncle‚Äôs home where I was staying. Actually, I was the runners up at a contest where 12 film producers were judges. I was too young for them to cast me as a leading lady. I was heartbroken. But then, fate had it that Sunil Dutt contacted me within a couple of months after he saw an advertisement I had done for a cold drink brand. I appeared as an angel in the ad and Sunilji was looking for someone to play an angelic character in Maseeha. He liked my innocent face. When he saw a song sequence of mine later, he said, ‚ÄòYeh ladki ka chehra hi kaafi hain, isko koi alag se ache kapre ki zaroorat nahin hain‚Äô (smiles). Before the film released, I signed seven other films. Also Shakti Samant, one of those who rejected me at the contest, signed me for Jaane Anjaane.In our times, not many would enter Bollywood like I did. Nowadays, they do. But being successful in this industry depends on clicking with the viewers. Many a time, films work but the actors don‚Äôt. Even when actors are good with their work, they don‚Äôt last. I saw Aamir Khan‚Äôs Lagaan and thought Gracy Singh was so good. But she didn‚Äôt work much after that film. Even Bhagyashree was wonderful in Maine Pyar Kiya.I find everyone very natural in their acting nowadays. I had even told Jaya Bachchan after watching her films. Among the current crop of actors, I like Ranveer Singh and Ranbir Kapoor. Among the actresses, it‚Äôs Deepika Padukone and Anushka Sharma.
