Manana, a former deputy minister of higher education, shared the now deleted picture on Instagram on Sunday.</p>
<p>He has since apologised for their behaviour via a statement released on Tuesday. He denied that Ndabeni&rsquo;s visit was a social one, saying she had gone to his house to collect masks and sanitisers for students who work at a Fourways Covid-19 digital services facility.</p>
<p>President Cyril Ramaphosa confirmed that he had seen the picture of Manana and Ndabeni-Abrahams and said he would speak to the minister, as he expects all South Africans to abide by the lockdown rules.</p>
<p>DA communications shadow minister Phumzile van Damme said Ndabeni-Abrahams should have known better as a leader, and that she would write to Ramaphosa. She hoped strong action would be taken against the minister.

<h3 id="pic-of-masina-at-mananas-house-emerges-mayor-says-it-was-before-lockdown">Pic of Masina at Manana’s house emerges, mayor says it was before lockdown</h3>
<p><img src="https://citizen.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-08-at-11.33.20-AM-320x213.png" alt="img">
Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina has been defending himself against accusations that he has also broken the lockdown regulations.</p>
<p>Former deputy minister of higher education and training Mduduzi Manana may have opened a can of worms after sharing pictures of Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams and others having a meal at his house.</p>
<p>Manana told the country she had actually been at his home in her official capacity, and was therefore supposedly not in breach of lockdown rules.</p>
<p>He said she came to his home to pick up gloves, hand sanitiser and masks for students in Fourways who had been working on “Digital Services” in the fight against Covid-19. Manana said he had stock of such personal protective equipment at his home because of the work of the Mduduzi Manana Foundation.</p>
<p>The explanation did not work as Ndabeni-Abrahams has since been placed on special leave.</p>

<p>Social media users again dug through Manana’s Instagram profile and found more pictures of him with friends.</p>
<p>In another picture circulating on social media, Masina and former home affairs minister Malusi Gigaba can be seen at Manana’s house.</p>
<p>“Staying home to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus means spending time with family and friends. I can’t be ever grateful to be visited by friends and family while continuing to observe all public health guidelines,” he said.</p>
<p>Manana&rsquo;s house is popular yhew….. pic.twitter.com/3frJlCRMdQ — Silindelo Masikane (@Slindelo_M) April 8, 2020</p>
<p>While the circulating picture only shows the two, Masina also spoke of Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula and ANC Ekurhuleni regional secretary Thembinkosi ‘TK’ Nciza.</p>
<p>The get-together took place before the lockdown, he said.</p>
<p>“I know you guys are bored under lockdown, but don’t use my name to entertain yourselves! The last time I visited Mdu Manana was on 21 March 2020, before the nation-wide lockdown was enforced. I was there with Malusi Gigaba, Fikile Mbalula and TK Nciza and our kids.</p>
<p>“Lockdown announced on the 23rd and effective at 11.59pm on the 26th of March, that’s the difference,” Masina said.</p>
<p>Responding to social media users who asked if Manana’s house was the new Saxonwold, Masina jokingly said there was no curry there.</p>
<p>“Call him after the lockdown, he is the great host, that I can tell you. Call it what you like but it’s normal we visit each other all the time.”</p>
<p>The pictures have since been removed.</p>

JOHANNESBURG - ANC Deputy Secretary-General Jessie Duarte has called on members to abide by the regulations and avoid photos showing opulent living.</p>
<p>This after Mduduzi Manana posted a picture of him and Communications Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams clearly not observing lockdown regulations.</p>
<p>Social media users are calling them out, with some saying the two should be arrested.</p>
<p>Duarte also says ANC members need to be leading by example during this time.</p>
<p>The post has since been taken down.
