Police are urging people to stick with the level 4 lockdown laws for another day.</p>
<p>As Covid-19 spreads around the world, it can be daunting keeping up with the information. For RNZ, our responsibility is to give you verified, up to the minute, trustworthy information to help you make decisions about your lives and your health. We&rsquo;ll also be asking questions of officials and decision makers about how they&rsquo;re responding to the virus. Our aim is to keep you informed.</p>
<p>Towns and cities across the country appear busier than they have been over the past four weeks.</p>
<p>The nation moves to alert level 3 from 11.59pm tomorrow.</p>
<p>Police found 293 people breaching lockdown on Saturday, and say while the vast majority of people are obeying the rules, some are not.</p>
<p>A police spokesperson said people cannot get complacent.</p>
<p>Police said they are taking an education-first approach to breaches, but will not hesitate to take enforcement action, either through warnings or arrests, for any serious or persistent breaches.</p>
<p>Police Commissioner Andrew Coster earlier said that police would be visible around popular beaches this weekend and would remain visible under alert level 3.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the lockdown meant New Zealanders had to commemorate Anzac Day in a different way, with many standing at their driveways at dawn to honour those who died in war.</p>
<p>Today, deaths worldwide from the coronavirus has passed 200,000, with Britain becoming the fifth country with more than 20,000 deaths.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, the combined total of confirmed and probable cases in New Zealand was updated today to 1470, an increase of nine. Deaths remained at 18 and 1142 people were reported as recovered.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/82539/eight_col_welly5.jpg?1561590891" alt="img">
Anzac Day is one of New Zealand&rsquo;s most important national events. This year, for the first time, services across New Zealand have been cancelled but Kiwis can still pay their respects at dawn from their own homes.</p>
<p>Photo: RNZ / Ana Tovey</p>
<p>RNZ National is partnering with the RSA and New Zealand Defence Force to broadcast a special Dawn Service. Coverage starts at 5.50am, with the official Stand At Dawn service starting at 6am on Saturday 25 April.</p>
<p>Join us on Anzac Day - Stand at your letterbox, at the front door, in your lounge room, on your balcony, or in your driveway. Stay in your bubble but wherever you are in the world, stand with us and take a moment to remember.</p>
<p>RNZ&rsquo;s &lsquo;virtual&rsquo; dawn service will be presented by Shannon Haunui-Thompson, and will include The Last Post, and a reading of the Ode of Remembrance in both Te Reo Māori and English.</p>
<p>A broadcast of the National Anthems of Australia and Aotearoa / New Zealand will be followed by a special address by Hon. Ron Mark, Minister of Defence and Minister for Veterans.</p>
<p>RNZ&rsquo;s Anzac Day programming will also include stories and features on Kim Hill&rsquo;s Saturday Morning show, and at 11.05am there will be a repeat broadcast of a recent Anzac Day National Commemoration Service.</p>
<p>How to #StandAtDawn from 5.50 am on Saturday 25 April:</p>
