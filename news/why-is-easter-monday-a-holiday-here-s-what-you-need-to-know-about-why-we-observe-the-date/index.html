Everything you need to know about Easter Monday (Photo: Shutterstock)</p>
<p>Most people are familiar with the biblical reasons we observe Good Friday and Easter Sunday - but what about Easter Monday?</p>
<p>As most of the UK enjoys the final day of the Easter Weekend relaxing, here’s what you need to know about the dates - and why it’s not a bank holiday in Scotland.</p>
<p>What is Easter Monday?</p>
<p>Easter Monday holds religious significance for Christians, as it follows Easter Sunday, the day Jesus Christ was resurrected following his crucifixion on Good Friday.</p>
<p>Sign up to our daily newsletter The i newsletter cut through the noise Sign up Thanks for signing up! Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later. Submitting&hellip;</p>
<p>It is believed that Jesus remained on earth for 40 days after his resurrection, and during this time he appeared to believers, healed the sick and spread the word of God.</p>
<p>The acts he carried out during this period are thought to have helped establish the first church. After the 40 days ended, Christians believe that he ascended into heaven.</p>
<p>The Bible itself does not say anything about what happened on Easter Monday, after Jesus’ resurrection, and it also doesn’t specifically instruct Christians to celebrate the Monday following Easter Sunday.</p>
<p>But across the globe, different cultures celebrate the day for different reasons. For some it’s a more solemn remembrance of Christ’s death and subsequent resurrection, which is marked with an outdoor procession.</p>
<p>For others there’s a more playful element to celebrating the day, like holding Easter egg-rolling competitions. Rolling Easter eggs is traditionally meant to symbolise the rolling of the stone from the tomb where Jesus was held.</p>
<p>When is Easter Monday?</p>
<p>Easter Monday is the day after Easter Sunday, so this year it falls on Monday 13 April.</p>
<p>Easter Monday is also known by a variety of different names such as Wet Monday (Smigus Dynagus), because in Poland it is tradition to throw water on each other.</p>
<p>Is Easter Monday a bank holiday?</p>
<p>In England, Northern Ireland and Wales, Easter Monday is a bank holiday.</p>
<p>It’s not considered a bank holiday across all of Scotland, however some councils do claim it as a bank holiday, such as Edinburgh, Falkirk and Dundee.</p>
<p>Each local council in Scotland has the power to make certain days ‘local’ public holidays.</p>
<p>If you live in Scotland, you can see what days your local council has determined a public holiday by going to the My Gov Scotland website here.</p>
<p>On the Scottish tab of the list of bank holidays on the government website, Easter Monday is not listed, unlike in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>What other bank holidays are left this year?</p>
<p>There are still a few more bank holidays to take place in 2020.</p>
<p>If a bank holiday falls on a weekend, a ‘substitute’ weekend becomes a bank holiday instead, usually the following Monday.</p>
<p>In Scotland, these dates are bank holidays this year:</p>
<ul>
<li>VE Day - Friday 8 May- Spring bank holiday - Monday 25 May- Summer bank holiday - Monday 3 August- St Andrew’s Day - Monday 30 November- Christmas Day - Friday 25 December- Boxing Day - Monday 28 December (a substitute day)</li>
</ul>
<p>England and Wales have the same line-up of bank holidays except from St Andrew’s Day on Monday 30 November, which is only observed in Scotland.

<p>What supermarkets are open today on Easter Monday?</p>
<p>Aldi</p>
<p>All Aldi stores will be open between 8am and 8pm today.</p>

<h3 id="are-gps-open-on-easter-monday">Are GPs open on Easter Monday?</h3>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/701249844-8a76_1586781710.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;crop=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
Can you still contact your GP over Easter? (Picture: Getty Images)</p>
<p>It’s Easter Monday, the end of the long Easter weekend – which has been very different to usual this year as the country remains in lockdown in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>And while only essential shops and services may be open at the moment, the Bank Holiday means that more of those than usual may be shut for the day.</p>
<p>Among those usually closed on bank holidays are doctor’s surgeries – but is that the case this year, and if so what do you do if you need urgent medical care?</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to know…</p>
<p>Are GPs open on Easter Monday?</p>
<p>Normally, GPs surgeries would be closed over the Easter weekend, from Good Friday through to Easter Monday.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>However many have remained open this year in the wake of Covid-19, in order to relieve pressure on the out of hours services this weekend.</p>
<p>Your best bet – should you need medical advice – is to call your surgery to see if they’re open today, or if you don’t have their contact, you can use the NHS’ Find A GP service or visit the surgery’s website.</p>
<p>What if your GP’s surgery isn’t open today?</p>
<p>A&amp;E departments are still open in the current pandemic (Picture: PA)</p>
<p>If your surgery is closed and you need urgent medical assistance, you can still call your surgery, which will direct you to an out of hours service.</p>
<p>If you have symptoms of coronavirus – such as a new, dry cough or a fever, you should not go to your GP surgery, or pharmacy or hospital, but stay at home and use NHS 111 online for advice on what to do.</p>
<p>For other urgent medical help you can also use the service – or call 111 if you need urgent help for a child aged five or under, or cannot get online.</p>
<p>In the event of an emergency you should call 999 for an ambulance.</p>
<p>A&amp;E departments and urgent care centres in hospitals are also still open and operating as normal in the current coronavirus outbreak – although they are a lot less busy than usual, with March having been their quietest month in a decade.</p>
