<p>(CNN) Carol Barr, wife of US Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky, died suddenly in their Lexington home Tuesday night, according to the congressman&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congressman Andy Barr&rsquo;s wife Carol passed away suddenly tonight at the family home in Lexington. During this tragic time, we respectfully ask for privacy for Congressman Barr and his family to grieve Mrs. Barr being called home to heaven,&rdquo; Mary Rosado, Barr&rsquo;s chief of staff, wrote in a statement.</p>
<p>Carol Barr was 39 and is survived by two daughters &ndash; Eleanor and Mary Clay.</p>
<p>According to a press release from Fayette County Coroner Gary W. Ginn, the 39-year-old&rsquo;s cause of death, determined from preliminary autopsy findings, was Mitral Valve Prolapse (Floppy Valve Syndrome). The manner of death was natural, according to the release.</p>
<p>The heart has four valves to make sure blood is pumped in the right direction. One of those valves, the mitral valve, can become damaged so that it can&rsquo;t direct the flow of blood properly. Sometimes people are born with this condition, other times it results from heart disease or infections. If the prolapse becomes very severe, the heart can no longer pump blood properly, leading to death.</p>

LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) — U.S. Rep. Andy Barr expressed “profound grief” Wednesday over the unexpected death of his 39-year-old wife at their home in Kentucky the night before. His initial statement provided no details about a cause.</p>
<p>Eleanor Carol Leavell Barr died in Lexington, the Republican congressman&rsquo;s chief of staff, Mary Rosado said in a statement. The Fayette County coroner was called to the family’s home following the announcement of her passing, WKYT-TV reported.</p>
<p>“In this moment of profound grief and heartbreak, we are so grateful for the gift and blessing of Carol’s life, for her strong faith in her Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, for the comfort of fond memories and her victory in heaven and for all those who have surrounded Carol’s family, the girls and I with beautiful expressions of love, compassion and sympathy,” Barr&rsquo;s statement said. He also asked for prayers for his daughters.</p>
<p>U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement he and his wife are “stunned and heartbroken” by the news, and send their “sincere condolences to Andy, their family and his staff at this terribly painful time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Condolences for her passing flowed in through the night from other Kentucky politicians, including Gov. Andy Beshear and U.S. Sen. Rand Paul.</p>
<p>Barr, who went by Carol, grew up in the state, attended the University of Kentucky, and married Andy Barr in 2008. The couple went on to have two children. She had worked for Pfizer, and as the executive director of Lexington’s Henry Clay Center for Statesmanship.</p>
<p>Rep. Barr represents Kentucky&rsquo;s 6th district, which includes the cities of Lexington, Richmond, and Frankfort.</p>

<p>Fort Benning is home to the U.S. Army Airborne School, which thousands of paratroopers attend each year. The three-week program teaches service members how to parachute safely. During the final week of jump school, students must complete five jumps from an altitude of more than 1,200 feet from either a C-130 or C-17 aircraft, according to a fact sheet from the Army.</p>

<p>Man held in Arizona charged in 1996 rapes</p>
<p>A man arrested in Arizona was charged Wednesday with committing a series of Southern California rapes and other crimes at gunpoint or knifepoint as long ago as 1996.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Cold case investigators used DNA evidence to identify Darin Edward Cooke, 50, as the suspect, Riverside County District Attorney Michael A. Hestrin told a news conference.</p>
<p>The 16-count case involves six victims, five of whom were forcibly raped, in the cities of Corona and Riverside, according to the prosecution.</p>
<p>Riverside Police Chief Larry Gonzalez said he was a patrol officer in an area where crimes occurred in 1996.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>The assailant stalked victims and waited for them to be alone, Hestrin said.</p>
<p>Cooke pleaded not guilty to all counts during his arraignment and was scheduled to appear in court on July 31 for a preliminary hearing, district attorney spokesman John Hall said.</p>
<p>AD</p>
<p>Cooke was arrested on May 26 in Prescott, Ariz., and extradited to California on June 14.</p>
<p>The criminal complaint charges him with six counts of forcible rape, four counts of forcible oral copulation, three counts of assault with intent to commit rape or oral copulation during a first-degree burglary, two counts of kidnap with intent to commit rape or oral copulation, and one count of forcible sexual penetration.</p>
<p>Eleven counts involve crimes in Riverside in 1996 and 1998. Five counts involve crimes in Corona in 2007.</p>
