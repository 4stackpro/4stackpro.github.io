Drake has blessed us with new song, Tootsie Slide, to help us get through coronavirus quarantine a little easier.</p>
<p>And, not only that, but the 33-year-old has dropped a topical music video for the track, filmed in his swanky home – proving he’s taking self-isolation seriously.</p>
<p>The clip begins with an eerie look at the empty streets in Toronto, as people stay home amid the lockdown.</p>
<p>We’re then introduced to Drizzy, taking absolutely no chances as he covers up with a black mask and gloves while Tootsie Sliding us through a tour through his swish house.</p>
<p>The camera pans to a tribute to the late Kobe Bryant, with his LA Lakers jerseys laying on a table in what appears to be the singer’s office.</p>
<p>He then takes us through countless marble hallways, showing off his very well-stocked bar, piano, swimming pool and stunning kitchen.</p>

<p>The clip ends as the dad-of-one puts on his very own fireworks display for us all.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>It’s basically like Cribs but in a music video.</p>
<p>And fans were absolutely loving every single second of it.</p>
<p>Flocking to Twitter, one screamed: ‘TOOSIE SLIDE WAS MADE JUS SO DRAKE COULD GIVE US A HOUSE TOUR AND BRUH. DIS MAN CRIB IS EVERYTHING I HOPE FOR (sic).’</p>
<p>‘So we just saw @Drake’s makes in the #ToosieSlide music video and i’ve never felt so poor,’ another joked.</p>
<p>Look at one of his many, many marble-covered hallways (Picture: YouTube)</p>
<p>‘Drake really just gave us a MTV cribs music video introducing the crib. He really lives in a compound lmao,’ a follower posted.</p>
<p>While a Twitter user added: ‘Drake just showed me in his new video that I need to get my dollas up in the future…damn.’</p>
<p>Honestly, same.</p>
<p>We wonder which celebrity will be the first to attempt a Tootsie Slide on TikTok…</p>
<p>Drake recently made headlines after finally sharing a photo of his son, Adonis, on Instagram – and the little one is adorable.</p>
<p>The One Dance rapper is notoriously private about his family life but decided to change all this with some snaps of the two-year-old – whom he shares with Sophie Brussaux – on the gram.</p>
<p>He used his 2017 album Scorpion to confirm that he had secretly fathered a child with model Sophie – on song March 14.</p>
<p>This came as a shock to fans who were baffled by why he hadn’t opened up sooner.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>And, lifting the lid on this back in December, Drake admitted he was in limbo after DNA results initially came back inconclusive.</p>
<p>Speaking to Rap Radar, he confessed: ‘To be honest with you, I did a DNA test for my son and it came back to us and it said the DNA test got ruined in transit and they couldn’t be 100 percent sure that that was my son or not.</p>
<p>‘So, I was in a really weird pending situation where I didn’t want to go tell the world that that was my son and it wasn’t.’</p>
<p>He makes a fair point.</p>

<h3 id="drake--toosie-slide">Drake – Toosie Slide</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.genius.com/1a1e96518716106848595155b1f44611.1000x1000x1.jpg" alt="img">
About “Toosie Slide”</p>
<p>“Toosie Slide” marks Drake’s first foray into dance records as he raps the instructions to the aforementioned dance. He also boasts about his dancing skills and compares them to the legendary Michael Jackson.</p>
<p>The song and it’s accompanying dance are named after Atlanta social media influencer Toosie, who on March 29—five days before the song’s release—posted a video of him doing the dance to the song as apart of his quarantine choreography.</p>
<p>The same day, popular dance duo Ayo &amp; Teo posted a video of them doing the same dance to the song. Two days later on March 31, 2020, Drake commented on Teo’s Instagram post where he said he would release the song soon. A few hours later, Drake revealed the song’s release date along with its cover art via Instagram.</p>
<p>The single is Drake’s first official release on all streaming platforms and third release overall in 2020, following the Future-assisted “Desires,” which was released in January, and “Chicago Freestyle” and “When to Say When”—both which were released four weeks prior to “Toosie Slide.” All three tracks were released as SoundCloud exclusives.

<h3 id="drake-dropping-new-music-this-friday-tootsie-slide">Drake Dropping New Music This Friday “Tootsie Slide”</h3>
<p><img src="https://urbanislandz.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Drake-Rolls-Royce.jpg" alt="img">
Drake has some new heat coming this Thursday!</p>
<p>Canadian rapper Drake has announced the release date for his upcoming song “Tootsie Slide.” The song that will be released on Thursday, April 2, is one of the small few Drake records to drop this year so far, and it will fill in as his first official release of 2020 on streaming services.</p>
<p>The OZ-produced anthem is already becoming a TikTok sensation with its own dance. Popular social media influencer Toosie played the rapper’s forthcoming record as part of his quarantine choreography in a video on Twitter on Sunday (March 29). The 6 God is no stranger to viral patterns, seeing that he is the curator behind many – most recently, the #FlipTheSwitch challenge on TikTok, which was propelled by his hit, “Nonstop” from his 2018 album, Scorpion.</p>
<p>Drake had earned considerably more popularity with his hit-singles “Hotline Bling” and “God’s Plan,” yet it wasn’t until the “In My Feelings” challenge that numerous celebrities wanted to participate in the trend, including Will Smith, Ciara, Ryan Seacrest, Dua Lipa, and J-Hope from South Korean boy band BTS.</p>
<p>Drizzy confirmed via Instagram that the new single would be named “Toosie Slide” and will be aired at midnight Thursday. The song includes instructive lyrics like “Gotta dance, but it’s really on some street sh*t/ I’ ma show you how to get it, it go right foot up/ Left foot slide/ Left foot up/ Right foot slide,” making it the perfect soundbite for a looping TikTok clip — and a dance challenge. The moves are very basic, with Drake requesting that audience members bring their left foot up before sliding to one side and recreating those moves on the opposite side.</p>
<p>Several fans on social media have already begun recording their best interpretations of the Toosie Slide on social media – even Tinashe recorded her own video with her brothers. The timing of the song coincides with the recent surge in popularity of the track on social media video platforms like Tik Tok. “Tootsie Slide” will arrive ahead of Drake’s upcoming album and marks his first new music since “When to Say When” and “Chicago Freestyle which was released on February 28 on YouTube.</p>
<p>The rapper recently shared photos of his adorable family, including his son Adonis on Instagram and sent heartfelt messages reminding us to be optimistic in this ongoing global pandemic. It looks like Drake has officially joined the party, and it will be going on for quite some time.
