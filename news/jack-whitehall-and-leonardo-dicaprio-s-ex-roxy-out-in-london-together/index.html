Jack Whitehall and Roxy Horner seen loved up holding hands while out shopping in London (Picture: ZJ / BACKGRID)</p>
<p>Jack Whitehall and his new girlfriend Roxy Horner – who reportedly once dated Leonardo DiCaprio – looked as loved-up as could be during an outing in London.</p>
<p>The cute couple were spotted holding hands as they ran errands in the city while making use of their allowed time outside during the coronavirus lockdown.</p>
<p>Although the comedian and the model have not made their budding romance social media official, their outing appears to confirm that things are very much on between them.</p>
<p>The stand-up was carrying their shopping as they walked through London in their low-key ensembles: a polo shirt and trousers for him, and a midriff-baring quite cropped tee for Roxy, teamed with stylish camel-coloured flared trousers.</p>
<p>Jack, 31, and Roxy, 28, reportedly made their relationship exclusive right before lockdown began and now they’re spending time in quarantine together.</p>

<p>A source told The Sun: ‘Jack and Roxy are enjoying being in isolation together. It’s all very new but they’re in their own little bubble and things are perfect at the moment.’</p>
<p>The two have been isolating together (Picture: ZJ / BACKGRID)</p>
<p>Jack was with Gemma Chan before Roxy (Picture: ZJ / BACKGRID)</p>
<p>Prior to dating Jack, Roxy was with singer Jake Bugg for two years.</p>
<p>The model was also once reported to have dated Hollywood heavyweight Leonardo.</p>
<p>The British model and the Titantic star were rumoured to have been seen grabbing ice cream together in New York, as well as going on dates in London a few years ago.</p>
<p>The two were out grabbing essentials (Picture: ZJ / BACKGRID)</p>
<p>Roxy and Jack’s relationship kicked off after he apparently joined dating app Raya, an app specifically for celebrities and others working in the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>Jack dated Crazy Rich Asians actress Gemma Chan for six years before the two split in 2017.</p>
<p>Since then, he had been linked to stars like Hanna Cross, Kate Beckinsale and Paris Hilton.</p>
