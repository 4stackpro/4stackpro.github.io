We’ll begin with a brief summary of Western New York&rsquo;s March weather. We got off easy – 2.1 inches of snow fell versus an average March total of 12.9 inches. If you click on this link from the National Weather Service and look at the column under March, you’ll see just how unusual 2.1 inches is, though it’s far from a record low total.</p>
<p>March has brought as much as 32.8 inches of snow, in 2001. As for temperatures, it was unquestionably a mild month, with the mean temperature running at a large positive anomaly of 7.3 degrees above average. Our warmest day should still be fresh in your memory. We hit 74 on Sunday just ahead of the powerful squall line. Our coldest reading was on March 1, when the low hit 13 degrees. In the last 20 years, it has been as cold as minus-3 degrees in 2003 and 2014.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s move on to April averages. The climatology, as is easy to guess, shows rapid warming. We go from March’s average mean temperature of 34 to April’s 45.9. The mean high goes from March’s 42 to April’s 55. The mean low goes from March’s 26 to April’s 36.8.</p>
<p>If you have forgotten, it snows in April. The monthly average is 2.7 inches. It has snowed as much as 15 inches in 1975 and just under 7 inches just two years ago. Again, you can peruse the numbers over the years on this link.</p>
<p>On this chilly April 1, I can say with high confidence we will not be facing one of the snowier Aprils. Going back to 1940, there have not been any years with zero snow in April, but there have been nine years in which only a trace fell. A trace indicates snow or graupel has been observed in the air, but there was none on the ground to be measured. As of this writing, I’m seeing only weak evidence in models of a chance for snow in the first half of the month. The latest European/ECMWF suggests some minor elevation-driven snow may fall around the April 10 on the hills, which was not showing in the model Tuesday.</p>
<p>The 10-day total snow accumulation in the ECMWF, with all the usual caveats about models looking at precipitation 10 days out not doing very well, shows some measurable snow toward day 10, but it does not account for the melting that will be inevitable at that time.</p>
<p>The American GFS shows zero snow anywhere in Western New York into April 11.</p>
<p>The most pessimistic models are the Canadian and the British/UKMET, which both show some measurable snow around April 10 or April 11. Again, models can’t account for melting and they are at their least reliable at their furthest point out in time. My April 1 calculation is shovels will begin to gather cobwebs, even if some of this wet snow arrives.</p>
<p>This April’s temperature trends suggest some decent warming by this weekend and into next week. The ECMWF ensemble mean for the upper air (51 separate runs of the ECMWF go into the ensemble) depicts a warm ridge in the East.</p>
<p>The ECMWF ensemble mean, again, with its 51 runs versus the single ECMWF model snow total above, does not show agreement with the operational single run. There is no measurable snow in the ensemble around April 10.</p>
<p>The ensemble mean does show some cooling around mid-month in its upper air pattern. Then again, I doubt there are many among us who expect every day in April to be mild.</p>
<p>After all, the first two days of the month are already “coolish” with high temps in the upper 40s, actually close to average. We’ll be back to the mid- and upper 50s this weekend into next week, with some 60s likely again by next Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
<p>The dreaded dog owners’ muddy paws situation won’t be worsening either. There are pretty slim pickins for measurable rainfall in the next seven days.</p>
<p>For a second opinion on April’s overall trends, this is the temperature probabilities outlook from the Climate Prediction Center. I’m not a huge fan of monthly outlooks, but this one shows a modest positive probability favoring temperatures running above average more often than not. It may not be much, but every tidbit of potential good news has to be welcome these days.

<h3 id="business-secretarys-statement-on-coronavirus-covid-19-1-april-2020">Business Secretary&rsquo;s statement on coronavirus (COVID-19): 1 April 2020</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/person/image/2801/alok-sharma-960.jpg" alt="img">
Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for the daily briefing on our fight against coronavirus.</p>
<p>I am joined today by Dr Yvonne Doyle who is the medical director of Public Health England.</p>
<p>Before Yvonne provides an update on the latest data from our COBR coronavirus fact file, I would like to update you on the steps that we are taking to defeat this pandemic.</p>
<p>Our step-by-step action plan is aiming to slow the spread of the virus, so fewer people need hospital treatment at any one time, protecting the ability of the NHS to cope.</p>
<p>Throughout our response to coronavirus, we have been following the scientific and medical advice. We have been deliberate in our actions, taking the right steps at the right time.</p>
<p>We are also taking unprecedented action to increase NHS capacity by dramatically expanding the number of beds, key staff and life-saving equipment on the front-line to provide the care when people need it most.</p>
<p>The daily figures show that a total of 152,979 people in the UK have now been tested for coronavirus.</p>
<p>Of those, 29,474 have tested positive.</p>
<p>The number of people admitted to hospital in England with coronavirus symptoms is now 10,767, with 3,915 of those in London and 1,918 in the Midlands.</p>
<p>Of those hospitalised in the UK, sadly 2,352 have died. This is an increase of 563 fatalities since yesterday. The youngest of them was just 13 years old.</p>
<p>All our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of those who have lost their lives.</p>
<p>This is more tragic evidence that this virus does not discriminate.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic is the biggest threat our country has faced in decades, and we are not alone. All over the world we are seeing the devastating impact of this invisible killer.</p>
<p>We recognise the extreme disruption the necessary actions we are asking people to take are having on their lives, businesses, jobs and the nation’s economy.</p>
<p>And I want to thank everyone across our whole country for the huge effort that is being made, collectively, in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>To the frontline workers treating and caring for patients, the people delivering supplies to their neighbours, and the millions staying at home: thank you. You are protecting the NHS and saving lives.</p>
<p>And I want to thank businesses too.</p>
<p>Through your support for your workers and your communities, and through your willingness to support our health service, you are making a real difference.</p>
<p>Whether it’s INEOS building a new hand sanitiser plant near Middlesbrough in just ten days;</p>
<p>Or UCL engineers working with Mercedes Formula One to build new Continuous Positive Airway Pressure machines, which help patients to breathe more easily;</p>
<p>Or broadband providers giving their customers unlimited data to stay connected;</p>
<p>Or indeed London’s ExCel Centre being converted into the NHS Nightingale Hospital with space for 4,000 patients.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the examples of businesses from across our great nation supporting lifesaving work.</p>
<p>There are also thousands of businesses, large and small, which have worked with staff to ensure they are supported in the days and weeks ahead.</p>
<p>Whether that is through ensuring PHE guidelines are followed on site, implementing furlough schemes, carrying over annual leave, or providing the means to work from home.</p>
<p>I want to convey my heartfelt thanks to all of those businesses, up and down the country, which are working to keep our economy going.</p>
<p>So that when this crisis passes, and it will, we are ready to bounce back.</p>
<p>Our businesses are doing all they can to support our people, and I want to make it clear that government, in turn, will do all it can to support our businesses.</p>
<p>We have taken unprecedented action to support firms, safeguard jobs and protect the economy.</p>
<p>From today businesses will start benefiting from £22 billion in the form of business rates relief. And grants of up to £25,000 which are being paid into the bank accounts of the smallest high street firms.</p>
<p>On Saturday, I said that we had provided funds to councils in England for grants to small businesses.</p>
<p>As of today, these local authorities have received more than £12 billion.</p>
<p>This afternoon I held a call with hundreds of local authorities across England and made clear that this money must reach businesses as quickly as possible. And I know that businesses across England have already started to receive these grants.</p>
<p>We know high street banks are working really hard to support the UK through this period, including through mortgage holidays and increased credit facilities.</p>
<p>Loans for businesses are also being issued through the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme since it came into operation last week.</p>
<p>The Chancellor, together with the Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority, wrote to the chief executives of the UK banks to urge them to make sure that the benefits of the Loan Scheme are passed through to businesses and consumers.</p>
<p>And it would be completely unacceptable if any banks were unfairly refusing funds to good businesses in financial difficulty.</p>
<p>Just as the taxpayer stepped in to help the banks back in 2008, we will work with the banks to do everything they can to repay that favour and support the businesses and people of the United Kingdom in their time of need.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a brand new scheme and, as with all new schemes, it will not be perfect from the outset.</p>
<p>We are listening all the time. And in response to concerns that we’ve heard from businesses, we are looking at ways in which we can ensure they get the support they need. The Chancellor will be saying more on this in the coming days.</p>
<p>It is crucial that when we overcome this crisis, as in time we will, that businesses are in a good position to move forward.</p>
<p>Times are tough, and we have harder times ahead of us.</p>
<p>But I know that together, we will pull through.

<h3 id="april-1-rents-due-many-struggle-to-pay-in-virus-outbreak">April 1, rent&rsquo;s due: Many struggle to pay in virus outbreak</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/WireAP_f79680e23bc24f17844832dfcfa01f75_16x9_992.jpg" alt="img">
April 1, rent&rsquo;s due: Many struggle to pay in virus outbreak It&rsquo;s the first of the month, and rent is due for millions of Americans for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak turned the economy upside down</p>
<p>‘Not enough to pay my rent’: The economic reality of coronavirus</p>
<p>‘Not enough to pay my rent’: The economic reality of coronavirus</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the first of the month, and everybody knows the rent&rsquo;s due. For millions of Americans, Wednesday is the first time the landlord is knocking on the door since the coronavirus outbreak turned the economy upside down.</p>
<p>Many of those renters are without jobs - nearly 3.3 million people in the U.S. filed for unemployment the week of March 16, about five times the previous high in 1982. Most state and local governments are putting evictions on pause as states prepare to pay unemployment and the federal government prepares to send stimulus checks. So for most, April&rsquo;s knock won&rsquo;t come with a notice to get out.</p>
<p>But a roof over the head is one of the most basic needs in life. Without money for rent, how can the other bills get paid? And while many will get a reprieve in April, eventually the rent comes due, whether or not the restaurant, plant or construction site reopens when the COVID-19 threat lessens.</p>
<p>Here are some of the stories of Americans trying to make the rent, this month and beyond.</p>
<p>———</p>
<p>At 21 years old, Jade Brooks pulls in her family&rsquo;s only full-time salary, working at a hospital switchboard.</p>
<p>Brooks&rsquo; mother just lost her job at a health insurance company - a casualty of the plummeting economy. She&rsquo;s found part-time work at the hospital, but between them, they make only $400 weekly after taxes and insurance, Brooks said. Their rent is $1,810.</p>
<p>During sleepless nights, Brooks worries most about her 8-year-old cousin, who lives with them.</p>
<p>“I don’t want her to grow up in a homeless shelter, having to sleep in a bunk bed with other people, asking why we have to stand in a long line to get a room to sleep in, why we have to stand in a long line to get food, why she can’t invite her friends over,” Brooks said. “It’s hard to explain that to an 8-year-old.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Michael Casey, Boston</li>
</ul>
<p>———</p>
<p>Itza Sanchez knows she can&rsquo;t make her $400 rent for April. She&rsquo;s praying to Virgin of Guadalupe that she doesn&rsquo;t get kicked out of her Richmond, Virginia, mobile-home park.</p>
<p>Sanchez made her money searching for and recycling scrap metal and selling tamales in a heavily Hispanic neighborhood. Fear of getting sick has stopped both income streams.</p>
<p>A single mother of two who immigrated from Honduras to the U.S. 14 years ago, Sanchez&rsquo;s 7-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son have been eating lunches delivered to the neighborhood by schools and depending on churches for other meals.</p>
<p>“I&rsquo;m basically penniless,” Sanchez, 39, said in Spanish.</p>
<p>She hasn&rsquo;t heard from the landlord about what will happen if the rent isn&rsquo;t paid. So she keeps praying.</p>
<p>“May she help us. May the virgin put her love over us and help us.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Regina Garcia Cano, Washington</li>
</ul>
<p>———</p>
<p>Andrea Larson made $70,000 a year curating wine lists and suggesting pairings to customers at 5th &amp; Taylor. But the popular Nashville restaurant closed its dining area, and working as a sommelier isn&rsquo;t something Larson can do from home.</p>
<p>The first unemployment check was $275 for a week. Larson said she was humiliated but applied for food stamps.</p>
<p>“I&rsquo;m screwed financially,” Larson said. “If I do pay my rent, it&rsquo;s going to eat into my food money.”</p>
<p>Larson, 42, moved from a high-rise downtown apartment to a house in east Nashville four months ago. Rent was cheaper. She planned to pay off debt and start saving. Instead, she called credit-card companies and said she couldn&rsquo;t pay the minimum.</p>
<p>Larson&rsquo;s restaurant offered a few shifts answering phones for takeout, but she figures it&rsquo;s not worth the risk of getting COVID-19.</p>
<p>“I do wine, and nobody wants to hear about wine right now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They just want to chug it.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Travis Loller, Nashville</li>
</ul>
<p>———</p>
<p>Roushaunda Williams was able to scrimp and use credit-card cash advances to pay the $1,850 rent for April for her two-bedroom Uptown Chicago apartment.</p>
<p>But the rent comes due again in 30 days. Can she afford a smaller apartment in her building if one&rsquo;s available? Should she move in with friends if they&rsquo;ll let her?</p>
<p>“April 1 isn&rsquo;t even here yet, and I&rsquo;m already working on what I&rsquo;m going to do for May 1,” Williams, 52, said.</p>
<p>Before being laid off, she made drinks and chatted with people from around the world for 20 years as a bartender at the Palmer House Hilton Hotel in the heart of Chicago&rsquo;s downtown Loop.</p>
<p>Income depended on tips — in the best times, she&rsquo;d make $70,000 to $100,000 annually. Now, she&rsquo;s on unemployment for the first time and searching for work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kathleen Foody, Chicago</li>
</ul>
<p>———</p>
<p>Tnia Morgan shares her Baltimore County, Maryland, townhouse with her 18-year-old pregnant daughter and 18-year-old nephew. And they all spend a lot more time together since Morgan was laid off March 6 from her job serving food at a hotel banquet hall.</p>
<p>Morgan&rsquo;s landlord told her to take her time with the rent. But it isn&rsquo;t the only bill piling up. She ticks them off — car payment, car insurance, cellphone, internet, water, gas and electricity. And she always has to buy food, so tough choices are ahead, especially until unemployment benefits kick in.</p>
<p>Morgan, 39, has checked on getting food stamps and looked for work at stores and warehouses with no luck.</p>
<p>She appreciates her landlord&rsquo;s kindness this month. But she knows he needs her rent money to pay his bills.</p>
<p>“If I don’t pay the rent, it falls on him,” Morgan said. “We can’t be evicted right now, but eventually they’re going to want their money.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Michael Kunzelman, Silver Spring, Maryland</li>
</ul>
<p>———</p>
<p>Bartender Luke Blaine was laid off when downtown Phoenix restaurant Fez closed, but he&rsquo;s not too worried about rent — yet.</p>
<p>He shares his small adobe-style home and backyard garden of tomatoes, beets, squash, radish, lettuce and eggplants with his boyfriend, Kyle Schomer. Schomer still has his job in technology and works from home.</p>
<p>Blaine, 30, figures unemployment will kick in. His car is paid for, and he owes little beyond a small credit-card balance.</p>
<p>Blaine credits his thrifty nature to his family. And that&rsquo;s whom he worries about most these days. His mother and sister are nurses in Illinois, not far from hard-hit Chicago.</p>
<p>“It definitely is nerve-racking having your family on the front line,” Blaine said.</p>

<p>Ruqayyah Bailey&rsquo;s life had balance — so important with her autism — before coronavirus.</p>
<p>She was going to college and was a part-time cafe cashier. She couldn&rsquo;t wait for the Special Olympics in March, to run and compete in long jump and shot put.</p>
<p>But the virus closed the cafe, canceled the meet and ended the community college&rsquo;s personal instruction.</p>
<p>Bailey, 30, of St. Louis County, was dipping into savings for food and other necessities, so she&rsquo;s moved back in with her mother. She hopes it&rsquo;s temporary and she can get back to her apartment, with its $400 monthly rent.</p>
<p>“I had to suspend my internet and my cable,” Bailey said of her apartment. “It’s tough because I’m so used to being there in my own little space.”</p>

<p>Jason W. Still was let go from his job as a cook, and he&rsquo;s found one small benefit: He hasn&rsquo;t spent as much money since he&rsquo;s inside most days.</p>
<p>Still and his wife — who works in packaging for a marijuana dispenser in Spokane, Washington — should be able to make April&rsquo;s rent as they wait to see what he&rsquo;ll get in unemployment and from the federal government.</p>
<p>Still, 30, worked at a high-end restaurant and just finished the last classes for his bachelor&rsquo;s degree. Now he&rsquo;s applying for graduate school to study environmental economics and public policy.</p>
<p>In unemployment, he has a lot of time on his hands: “I’ve seen corners of my house that I didn’t know existed.”</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a lousy choice, but an easy one for personal trainer and apparel designer Sakai Harrison — food in the refrigerator over April rent for his Brooklyn apartment.</p>
<p>Harrison, 27, moved from Atlanta to see whether he could succeed in the toughest place in the world. And he was on his way, with 20 clients training one-on-one.</p>
<p>Then, his gym shut down with the rest of the city. And the $1,595 rent is due.</p>
<p>“The way I see it, the whole world is on pause,” Harrison said. “I&rsquo;d rather allocate my money towards my actual survival, which would be food.”</p>
<p>An acquaintance is letting Harrison use a basement as a makeshift gym. It has dumbbells, a bench and a punching bag left by a previous tenant. Harrison wears disposable gloves and keeps his distance. A few clients keep coming, but not as many as before.</p>
<p>“My clients are like my family, for the most part, especially in New York, because I&rsquo;m here alone,” he said.</p>

<p>Tinisha Dixon was homeless before she moved into her current apartment and is now struggling to make the rent.</p>
<p>She said she was about to start a new job at the State Road and Tollway Authority. But the job was put on hold, thanks to the virus.</p>
<p>The rent bill of $1,115 is due whether she&rsquo;s working or not. It covers the apartment near downtown Atlanta she shares with her partner and their five kids. Dixon, 26, said she&rsquo;s trying to braid hair, and her partner has sought work as a security guard.</p>
<p>Dixon&rsquo;s landlord had gone to court to evict the family before the coronavirus. Now she worries not making April&rsquo;s payment will strengthen that case.</p>
<p>“Are we going to be out on the street when this is over?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Because this is what we’ve been fighting for this whole time, not being back out on the street.”</p>

<p>With help from friends and a nonprofit, Jas Wheeler can pay April&rsquo;s rent. But Wheeler and their partner just bought a house down the road in Vergennes, Vermont, and the first mortgage payment is due in May.</p>
<p>“I am just really just trying to pray,” said Wheeler, who hopes to see unemployment checks soon but worries the system is overwhelmed with so many people out of work.</p>
<p>Wheeler was laid off from a bakery. The 30-year-old thought about a grocery-store job, but they don&rsquo;t want to risk exposure to the coronavirus. So for now, they&rsquo;ll wait to see whether the bakery reopens.</p>
<p>“I would rather just get an unemployment check and ride it out &hellip; I’m really thinking at the end of all this whenever that is, I’ll be happy to get any job that I can get.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neal Miller is refusing to pay April&rsquo;s rent, to make a point.</p>
<p>Miller&rsquo;s last stable job was as an adjunct professor at Loyola University in Chicago. He recently was working temporary jobs, until that dried up, thanks to the virus.</p>
<p>Miller, 38, shares a house on the west side of Chicago with four others and pays $400 of the $1,500 monthly rent.</p>
<p>Miller and his roommates decided to join leaders of Chicago activist groups calling for a rent strike amid the virus outbreak.</p>
<p>“We wrote a letter, sort of stated our situation,” Miller said. “We&rsquo;re still waiting to hear back. We&rsquo;re not sure if that&rsquo;s a good sign or if that lack of response means we&rsquo;ll be hearing from a lawyer.”</p>
