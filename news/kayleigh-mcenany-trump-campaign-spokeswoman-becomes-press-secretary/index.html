<p>US President Donald Trump has appointed his campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany to be the next White House Press Secretary.</p>
<p>Ms McEnany, 31, is a seasoned defender of the president, and has made frequent television appearances to promote his policies.</p>
<p>Her predecessor, Stephanie Grisham, did not conduct a single press briefing during her nine-month tenure.</p>
<p>Ms Grisham will return to her previous post as Melania Trump&rsquo;s chief of staff.</p>
<p>A graduate of Harvard Law School, and former CNN contributor, Ms McEnany has made headlines for her passionate defences of the president.</p>
<p>As the nation grapples with Covid-19, she has come under fire for her early statements on the virus, including suggesting opposition Democrats were &ldquo;rooting&rdquo; for the pandemic to &ldquo;take this President down&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In a February appearance on a Fox Business show, she said: &ldquo;We will not see diseases like the coronavirus come here, we will not see terrorism come here, and isn&rsquo;t that refreshing when contrasting it with the awful presidency of President Obama?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms McEnany has also previously worked as a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee and in 2018 published a book on the movement behind Mr Trump&rsquo;s 2016 election win.</p>
<p>Ms McEnany has been criticised for her past support of the &ldquo;birther&rdquo; conspiracy theory questioning former President Barack Obama&rsquo;s birthplace.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, former President Bill Clinton&rsquo;s press secretary Joe Lockhart shared a 2012 tweet from McEnany where she said Mr Obama&rsquo;s brother was in &ldquo;that hut in Kenya&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Skip Twitter post by @joelockhart I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll face a lot of interesting questions if she ever gets to the podium. Have we had an openly racist person like this ever behind that podium? https://t.co/Ze3wpN8KXP — Joe Lockhart (@joelockhart) April 7, 2020 Report</p>
<p>It is unclear whether Ms McEnany will continue to defend the president from behind the press secretary podium, or if she will opt for Ms Grisham&rsquo;s approach of communicating through tweets and interviews.</p>
<p>Trump prepares for election battle</p>
<p>The Trump White House is now on its fourth press secretary - as many as Donald Trump&rsquo;s three predecessors each had during their full eight years in office.</p>
<p>This president operates differently, of course. Over his three and a half years, he&rsquo;s downgraded the press secretary position, abandoning regular press briefings from his communications office in favour of impromptu gatherings on the White House lawn or, more recently, his daily coronavirus task force appearances.</p>
<p>The arrival of Kayleigh McEnany could indicate the role will again gain some prominence, however. Even if she doesn&rsquo;t hold her own press briefings, she is likely to continue the sometimes combative television appearances defending the president&rsquo;s policies for which she has become known.</p>
<p>The move also suggests the line between White House communications and the president&rsquo;s re-election campaign is further blurring. The president has frequently flouted tradition - and, potentially, federal law - by bringing administration officials onstage at campaign events. Now the press secretary herself comes from straight from the campaign.</p>
<p>In the months ahead, expect the full force of the president&rsquo;s administration to be aligned toward victory in November.</p>
<p>Ms McEnany is not the only new addition to the White House communications team.</p>
<p>Alyssa Farah, who was the defence department press secretary, will serve as the White House&rsquo;s director of strategic communications.</p>
<p>Ben Williamson, who was previously White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows&rsquo; communication director, will join as senior communications adviser.</p>
<p>Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who filled the press secretary post before Ms Grisham, said on Tuesday that Ms McEnany and Ms Farah were &ldquo;smart and capable women who have been loyal fighters&rdquo; for Mr Trump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their promotions are another example of the President empowering strong women to senior roles in his admin,&rdquo; she said.

&lsquo;She&rsquo;ll Fit Right In&rsquo;: Combative TV Pundit&rsquo;s Meteoric Rise To Trump White House</p>
<p>Enlarge this image toggle caption Scott W. Grau/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images Scott W. Grau/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images</p>
<p>How to describe President Trump&rsquo;s newest press secretary?</p>
<p>Kayleigh McEnany, just days shy of her 32nd birthday, already has acquired a bevy of classic establishment credentials. She holds degrees from Georgetown University&rsquo;s foreign service school and Harvard Law. She studied at Oxford. She served as a top spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee — which is to say the GOP — and for the president&rsquo;s re-election campaign.</p>
<p>McEnany also became, in a few short years, a notable pro-Trump presence on cable television, first as a CNN talking head and later as a party and campaign surrogate. Recently, she has suggested Americans should turn to Trump for guidance on the risk of pandemic rather than public health officials like Dr. Anthony Fauci and that Democrats were &ldquo;almost rooting&rdquo; for the coronavirus to have a deadly effect to undermine Trump&rsquo;s presidency. She also has promoted racist fictions about President Obama and made false claims about voter fraud.</p>
<p>She is well suited for the job as envisioned by her boss: a combative, unyielding figure not intended to inform or convince the press corps (and the public through it) but, rather, hold it in contempt and at bay.</p>
<p>Press secretaries &ldquo;are important jobs under Democratic and Republican presidents,&rdquo; said MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace, who served as the communications director for President George W. Bush and who has become an outspoken critic of Trump. &ldquo;These are people who stand at the podium on September 11th and after Newtown and after Oklahoma City. And Donald Trump just either doesn&rsquo;t know that, or doesn&rsquo;t care, or doesn&rsquo;t see it that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McEnany became Trump&rsquo;s fourth spokesperson on Tuesday. She replaced Stephanie Grisham, who spoke publicly primarily through interviews on the Trump-friendly Fox News Channel and did not hold a single press conference as press secretary. (Grisham has returned to lead the White House staff of Melania Trump.)</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s first press secretary was Sean Spicer, a former party stalwart who sheepishly acknowledged he had embarrassed his family by his aggressive conduct in the job. The second was Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who often scolded reporters but later admitted to federal investigators that her claim, uttered more than once, that &ldquo;countless&rdquo; FBI agents told her they were happy Trump had fired FBI director James Comey &ldquo;was not founded on anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spicer was required to take insupportable claims from almost the moment he stepped into the White House position, insisting that Trump&rsquo;s inauguration had attracted record crowds, when the evidence clearly showed otherwise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What President Trump and his staff have never fully embraced is that when you take the podium at the White House, you&rsquo;re speaking on behalf of the entire nation, not just one person,&rdquo; former Obama White House spokesman Bill Burton told NPR. &ldquo;To speak on behalf of this president, one is required to have fierce loyalty to him and no fidelity to the truth. Given [McEnany&rsquo;s] work for him so far, I think she&rsquo;ll fit right in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McEnany worked on Capitol Hill for congressional Republicans and interned in the communications office of President George W. Bush. She foreshadowed her allegiance to Trump with tweets wrongly implying Obama was born in Kenya and defended Trump calling Obama the founder of the radical Islamic terrorist group ISIS (which got its start years before Obama became president).</p>
<p>Such comments are unlikely to be counted against her by administration officials. Trump&rsquo;s new chief of staff, former U.S. Rep. Mark Meadows, made similar claims about Obama&rsquo;s origins on the campaign trail though Meadows more recently said &ldquo;there is not a racial bone in my body.&rdquo; Trump, of course, was the nation&rsquo;s most foremost advocate of birtherism.</p>
<p>Meadows, McEnany and the White House did not respond to NPR&rsquo;s requests for comment submitted through its press office.</p>
<p>In 2017, McEnany defended Trump for his frequency of playing golf by claiming Obama had gone to play golf after the beheading of the Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl by Islamic militants. Obama was an Illinois state senator at the time of Pearl&rsquo;s death in 2002. She later said she meant another victim of terrorism, James Foley, who was killed by ISIS in 2014. (Obama conceded to NBC&rsquo;s Chuck Todd that he made a mistake and should have paid attention to the &ldquo;optics&rdquo; of playing a round of golf while on vacation shortly after consoling Foley&rsquo;s relatives.)</p>
<p>Last year, McEnany memorably asserted on CNN that she believed Trump had never lied as president. The Washington Post&rsquo;s Fact Checker feature has found that Trump had personally made more than 16,200 false or misleading claims during his first three years in office and he inspired a new category for the service: the &ldquo;Bottomless Pinocchio&rdquo; — untrue claims he keeps repeating.</p>
<p>Most recently, McEnany made headlines for repeatedly downplaying the threat of the pandemic, suggesting it was an attempt by the president&rsquo;s critics to undermine him. &ldquo;We will not see diseases like the coronavirus come here,&rdquo; McEnany told Fox Business Network host Trish Regan in late February. &ldquo;And isn&rsquo;t it refreshing when contrasting it with the awful presidency of President Obama?&rdquo; Regan left the network in March, days after calling pandemic fears a hoax.</p>
<p>Jennifer Loven, who covered the George W. Bush and Obama White Houses for the Associated Press, says past press secretaries used to claim a tug in two directions: the need to put out the clearest message and best spin for their presidents, and the need to get information out to the public through the media.</p>
<p>Under Trump, Loven says, the press secretary has all but abandoned that second imperative.</p>
<p>And the public health crisis cloaks the president&rsquo;s most basic political challenge ahead. &ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;re missing the biggest piece of this of all, which is that the president is seeking to be re-elected this year,&rdquo; Loven told NPR. &ldquo;Maybe the answer is just not very complicated, but very simple, which is that he wants someone who is not only skilled in TV, but skilled in the campaign arena.&rdquo;

<h3 id="new-us-press-secretary-kayleigh-mcenany-ran-a-racist-right-wing-conspiracy-blog">New US Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany ran a racist, right-wing conspiracy blog</h3>
<p><img src="https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&amp;fit=1280%2C640&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2020%2F04%2Fkayleighmcenany.jpg&amp;signature=bb6b60978fa8734847e608230ba6f126" alt="img">
I’m about three hours into a deep wallow in new US Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany’s blog and – spoiler alert – it’s a hot mess full of racism, Islamophobia, and right-wing conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>The website – whose name changed from RealReaganConservative.Com to PoliticalProspect.com – appears to have gone into “maintenance mode” back in 2016, which of course coincides with Trump’s election. It appears McEnany had a lot to say about African Americans, liberals, Muslims (with a specific emphasis on Palestinians), and Christian conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>In fact, several stories that were apparently published for public consumption during the lifespan of the blog have, seemingly, been deliberately scrubbed.</p>
<p>This adds up. McEnany’s likely been under political scrutiny since 2016 and, based on what I’ve seen so far, scrubbing the site was certainly a smart decision. Political Prospect was obviously fixated on causing outrage. I’d rate it smack-between The Daily Stormer and Breitbart: It doesn’t appear to go quite as far right as the former, but it lacks the savvy and integrity (comparatively!) of the latter. It’s not the sort of website you want everyone in the country suddenly browsing once you’ve become the US Press Secretary. But the Wayback Machine never forgets.</p>
<p>Let’s just dive in, shall we?</p>
<p>The first page I tried to open was from 2011 and entitled “Kayleigh on the campaign trail.” Somehow, its contents have been lost to time:</p>
<p>The next one I tried to open was “Conservative solutions to liberal delusions” from 2013, it lead to a different error page:</p>
<p>Finally though, I managed to find some pages that worked and it was smooth sailing from then on. If you consider reading a non-stop barrage of shoddy writing, piss-poor reporting, outright racism, and a permeating hatred for Islam as “smooth sailing.”</p>
<p>I don’t normally criticize fellow “journalists,” but since I’m punching way, way, way, up here I think it’s okay. We all make mistakes, but the first article on her site that I got to load was a diatribe (originally published on The Blaze) she wrote promoting a debunked Columbine Shooting conspiracy theory:</p>
<p>Just moments after she sat down, Rachel Joy Scott was shot in the leg. She tried to run, but she was then shot in the chest. As she tried to crawl away, the deranged gunman grabbed her by her hair and asked her that fateful question: “Do you still believe in God?” Rachel said yes. And the shooter, who she had lovingly shared Christ’s word with just three weeks earlier, shot her in the head and ended her life.</p>
<p>It’s a tragic story that’s been retold countless times by both well-meaning and intentionally-misleading religious folks. It’s meant to demonstrate Christian martyrdom. And it’s untrue.</p>
<p>The next article I clicked on demonstrated a level of blatant racism usually reserved for anonymous message boards. In July of 2013 McEnany penned an article entitled “A Salute to the Nation’s First “White” African-American President.” Here’s a horrific quote from her piece:</p>
<p>On March 22, 2012, the New York Times broke the greatest story in their “illustrious” history. The Times located history’s first “white hispanic,” community volunteer George Zimmerman. Today, in following the Times unbiased journalistic standards, Political Prospect salutes that nation’s first “White” African-American President, Barack Obama. In honor of our President, Political Prospect will launch “White” African-American Week, where every article’s first mention of Obama will acknowledge the President’s newest accolade.</p>
<p>The piece concludes with the following statement:</p>
<p>While the rest of the mainstream media has embraced the term “White Hispanic” in an attempt to incite racial discontent, Political Prospect believes, like Martin Luther King, that people should “not be judged by the color of the skin but the content of their character.” It’s time to move past race, despite the fact that the mainstream media and this President insist on dwelling on it. Here at Political Prospect, we refuse to groupify, categorize, and divide this nation. Rather, we believe that we are all Americans — one, united, indivisible entity.</p>
<p>I’m not cherry-picking here. That’s the entire article:</p>
<p>Here’s another from 2011 called “Are Islam and Democracy Compatible in the Aftermath of the Arab Spring?” It’s difficult to tell what exactly the future Press Secretary is trying to say in this piece. It goes from this:</p>
<p>Those of you who know me may be aware that The Economist is my absolute favorite publication hands down. I respect the magazine and believe that it gives you a fairly unbiased and comprehensive overview of political and economic news around the world. I encourage all to read it. But this week, in a special report on the compatibility of Islam and democracy, they were far too kind to the Islamists. The magazine acknowledges the liberal view, which questions whether Islam and democracy can coexist, but there is clearly an undertone of defending the notion that Islam and democracy can work.</p>
<p>To this:</p>
<p>The bottom line is this. For democracy to thrive there must be civil liberties. Implementing Sharia law at the national level cannot be an option.</p>
<p>And what’s in between is a semi-coherent rant about how Muslim extremists will always try to gain more power. I urge you to read it for yourself in it’s entirety.</p>
<p>There’s also this article that claims a Palestinian market displaying a quote from the Quran about Jesus serving Allah (God) is indicative of all Muslim’s bigotry towards Christians. It attempts to back this claim up with a picture of a T-shirt showing the country of Israel draped in the Palestinian flag being sold in the same market.</p>
<p>Hidden among these posts is a steady diet of hilarious political commentary that hasn’t aged very well. In this article she decries that Republicans are no longer the party of “family values” after GOP Congressman Mark Sanford won reelection in 2013. Here’s a fun snippet:</p>
<p>While the rest of the nation celebrated Father’s Day, Sanford’s four sons had no father to celebrate with. Why? Because Sanford found it more important to visit his Argentinian mistress – all on the taxpayers’ dime.</p>
<p>And, of course, I’ve come across at least five articles demonizing President Barrack Obama and the Democrats for running up the deficit – something that’s reached a record high under her new boss President Donald Trump. Here’s a quote from one she wrote in 2013:</p>
<p>It’s a well-known fact that President Obama has zero regard for the US National Debt. The reckless increase in our nation’s debt under this president is obvious, naive, and dangerous.</p>
<p>She then goes on to state “the facts” about Obama’s spending, which are bullet points that have obviously been taken out of context and used for political effect.</p>
<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg. I’ve barely scratched the surface here and, frankly, it’s only a matter of time before a much larger editorial team pores over the whole archive and drops a bombshell report.</p>
