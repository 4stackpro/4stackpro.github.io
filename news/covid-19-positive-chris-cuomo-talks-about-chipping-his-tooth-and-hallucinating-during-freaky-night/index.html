CNN news anchor Chris Cuomo got real with his audience Wednesday about dealing with the coronavirus during his show &ldquo;Cuomo Prime Time.&rdquo; Cuomo said that he not only chipped a tooth but also hallucinated and saw his late father, former New York governor Mario Cuomo, during a &ldquo;freaky&rdquo; first night after his diagnosis.</p>
<p>The 49-year-old brother of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced in a tweet Tuesday that he tested positive for COVID-19 after being exposed to people who are infected. But by showtime it was back to business for Cuomo, who broadcasted his CNN show &ldquo;Cuomo Prime Time&rdquo; from his basement Tuesday and Wednesday via webcam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This virus came at me, I’ve never seen anything like it,&rdquo; Cuomo said Wednesday, adding that he had a fever of more than 103 &ldquo;that would not quit. And it was like somebody was beating me like a piñata.&rdquo; He was shivering so much that he chipped a tooth –- &ldquo;These are not cheap, OK?&rdquo; he cracked, pointing at his chompers – and was up all night and hallucinating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dad was talking to me, I was seeing people from college, people I hadn’t seen in forever,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was freaky what I lived through last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coronavirus:Gov. Andrew Cuomo gives emotional update on brother Chris&rsquo; coronavirus: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m worried&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cuomo closed his show with a message: &ldquo;Don’t be me. But more importantly, be better than we’re being right now. Care enough not just to stay home but to stay on your leaders, to make sure they’re doing everything they can to limit this. I’m telling you, this is the part of our lives we will live through and remember the most. How do you want to be remembered during this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the broadcast Tuesday, Cuomo also pleaded with Americans to continue practicing social distancing to flatten the curve and debunked a common myth held by many who think they are immune to the virus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me be proof. We have real vulnerability,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not too strong. Do not act that way. But show that vulnerability by what you do for yourself and for others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was later joined on air by CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re going through this,&rdquo; Gupta told him. &ldquo;Really. I really feel for you. It&rsquo;s not good; it&rsquo;s a serious thing and you&rsquo;re a tough guy, but I know it really makes people feel miserable. So I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re going through this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gupta also stressed the importance of exercising caution when it comes to experimenting with trial medications that haven&rsquo;t been proven to fight coronavirus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last thing we want to do to anybody, Chris, yourself included, is cause some sort of harm. That&rsquo;s why you do trials,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wish it worked. I wish we could say it worked and we knew it for sure and then I would say &lsquo;my pal Chris can take this and it can help him reduce the severity and the duration of this virus.&rsquo; But I can&rsquo;t say that for sure&hellip; There&rsquo;s gonna be (a medication that will help), we just don&rsquo;t know what it is yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the top of the hour, Cuomo handed off to Don Lemon, who tried to cheer up his CNN colleague with some playful banter. &ldquo;Did you get my gift? … I sent you a six-pack of Corona (beer),&rdquo; Lemon quipped.</p>
<p>But Lemon hit a more serious note later on &ldquo;CNN Tonight&rdquo; when he had to cut to commercial break after tearing up over Cuomo&rsquo;s well-being.</p>
<p>On Twitter early Tuesday, Cuomo revealed about his diagnosis: &ldquo;Sooooo in these difficult times that seem to get more difficult and complicated by the day, I just found out that I am positive for coronavirus. I have been exposed to people in recent days who have subsequently tested positive and I had fever, chills and shortness of breath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just hope I didn&rsquo;t give it to the kids and Cristina. That would make me feel worse than this illness! I am quarantined in my basement (which actually makes the rest of the family seem pleased!). I will do my shows from here,&rdquo; he continued.</p>
<p>Cuomo concluded on a positive note: &ldquo;We will all beat this by being smart and tough and united!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking of his brother, Gov. Cuomo said in a press conference Tuesday Chris Cuomo &ldquo;is going to be fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even for essential workers, people have to be careful. Again, I&rsquo;ve been trying to communicate that everyone – everyone – is subject to this virus,&rdquo; the governor said. &ldquo;This virus is the great equalizer. My brother, Chris, is positive for coronavirus. Found out this morning. Now, he is going to be fine. He&rsquo;s young, in good shape, strong – not as strong as he thinks – he will be fine. But there&rsquo;s a lesson in this. He&rsquo;s an essential worker, a member of the press, so he&rsquo;s been out there. If you go out there, the chance that you&rsquo;ll get infected is very high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just worried about his daughter and his kids and he hopes he didn&rsquo;t get them infected,&rdquo; the governor said. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really know Chris – you see Chris on his show at night … but you just see one dimension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see a person in his job. And in his job, he&rsquo;s combative and he&rsquo;s argumentative and he&rsquo;s pushing people. But that&rsquo;s his job. That&rsquo;s not who he is,&rdquo; the governor continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a really sweet, beautiful guy. And he&rsquo;s my best friend. My father was always working, so it was always just me and Chris,&rdquo; the governor said, adding his brother joked to him this morning that &ldquo;even the dogs won’t come downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The governor added that two weeks ago the brothers disagreed over Chris Cuomo having their mother over at his home: &ldquo;Love needs be a little smarter than reactive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Gov. Cuomo gave an emotional update about his brother during his coronavirus briefing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no superhero who is immune to this disease,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Anyone can get it. No one can be protected from it. I couldn&rsquo;t protect my own brother &hellip; And with all he knows and as smart as he is, he couldn&rsquo;t protect himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chris Cuomo was most recently at CNN&rsquo;s offices in the Hudson Yards neighborhood of New York City last Friday, CNN confirmed Tuesday.</p>
<p>USA TODAY has reached out to reps for Cuomo for comment.

<p>Coronavirus-stricken CNN anchor Chris Cuomo was shivering so severely Tuesday night that he chipped a tooth, he revealed on-air Wednesday while describing his symptoms.</p>
<p>“I’ve never had anything like it,” Cuomo, the younger brother of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, said as he broadcasted from the basement of his home.</p>
<p>“I never experienced any kind of fever like what I have going on all the time, and the body aches, and the tremors and the concern about not being able to do anything about it.”</p>
<p>The younger Cuomo tested positive for the disease Tuesday.</p>
<p>Talking on air Wednesday to CNN’s chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Cuomo, 49, acknowledged his chipped tooth.</p>
<p>“You had these rigors … so bad, that I think you chipped a tooth,” said Gupta, who was recalling the symptoms Cuomo was experiencing as the two talked on the phone Tuesday night.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Cuomo interjected.</p>
<p>Wednesday was the second consecutive day Cuomo worked from home with the bug.</p>
<p>Gupta assured Cuomo that it’s okay to take a day off.</p>
<p>“You’re totally right,” Cuomo said. “You gotta take care of yourself first or you can’t take care of anybody else.”</p>
<p>Despite the serious symptoms, Cuomo said “it’s been a great day” since finding out neither his wife or kids have tested positive for the coronavirus.
