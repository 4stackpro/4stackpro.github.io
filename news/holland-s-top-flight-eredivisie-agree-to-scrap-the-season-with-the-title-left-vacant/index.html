Holland&rsquo;s Eredivisie title will be left vacant after it was announced the season will be scrapped due to disruption caused by the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>Both Ajax and AZ Alkmaar were level on points at the top of the Eredivisie table, but neither will be crowned champions.</p>
<p>Promotion and relegation have also been axed - with Cambuur, who were 11 points clear at the top of the second tier, now cruelly missing out on a return to the Eredivisie after three seasons away.</p>
<p>Holland&rsquo;s top-flight Eredivisie agreed to scrap the season and the title will now be left vacant</p>
<p>Ajax and AZ Alkmaar were level on points at the top of the table but neither will be champions</p>
<p>Clubs were afforded a vote to decide the outcome of the campaign, with 16 choosing to enable promotion and relegation for the Eredivisie.</p>
<p>However, a further nine sides voted against their competitors being allowed to move into different leagues, with nine more abstaining from the vote entirely and believing that the Dutch FA should decide.</p>
<p>The KNVB then ultimately opted to ensure that clubs will remain in their current divisions for when football does resume in the country.</p>
<p>The current league table will also decide which clubs take part in European competitions next term.</p>
<p>Clubs were given a vote to decide the outcome of the campaign during a video call on Friday</p>
<p>ADO Den Haag (pictured) and RKC Waalwijk subsequently avoided the drop to the second tier</p>
<p>Ajax, who top the standings on goal difference, will enter the last round of the Champions League qualifying stages, and AZ Alkmaar will go into the second qualification round.</p>
<p>Feyenoord will instead contest in the Europa League group stage.</p>
<p>PSV will progress into the third round of Europa League qualification, with Willem II entering the second qualifying round of the competition.</p>
<p>These permutations are subject to ratification from UEFA, however.</p>
<p>ADO Den Haag and RKC Waalwijk have subsequently avoided the drop after the drastic action taken by the Dutch federation.</p>
<p>Waalwijk welcomed the decision, with managing director Frank Van Mosselveld saying: &lsquo;The KNVB made the decision we hoped for this afternoon by not applying promotion and relegation to the 2019/2020 season.</p>
<p>Dutch PM Mark Rutte (pictured) said organised events would remain banned until September 1</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is now clarity, so that we can work towards the new season. The KNVB had to make a difficult decision, because there is now a bigger game in the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>However, Cambuur boss Henk de Jong is unsurprisingly furious with his team now denied promotion.</p>
<p>He described the decision as &lsquo;the greatest shame in the history of Dutch sport&rsquo;, and told Omrop Fryslan: &lsquo;Normally I have all respect for the people of the KNVB. But that has now dropped far below zero.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The governing body had initially revealed that it would not explore the option of increasing the top division to 20 teams for next season.</p>
<p>Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte has banned professional football until September in the face of the current health emergency.</p>
<p>The Eredivisie becomes the first major European league to be cancelled due to the pandemic, with questions certain to be raised over whether other competitions across the continent will follow suit.</p>
<p>UEFA indicated earlier this week that leagues in Europe could be cancelled &lsquo;in special cases&rsquo;</p>
<p>UEFA indicated earlier this week that leagues could be cancelled &lsquo;in special cases&rsquo;, although the organisation still hopes for a restart to football in June.</p>
<p>All 55 European national FAs discussed the various ways to finish their respective seasons during a video conference call on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Bundesliga and Serie A remain hopeful of restarting their action behind closed doors in May or June.</p>
<p>But Club Brugge were awarded the title in Belgium, with the Jupiler League called off for health reasons.</p>
<p>The nation were the first to break ranks from the rest of Europe and declare an immediate end to the campaign with just one game of the regular season remaining.

<p><img src="https://www.goal.com/assets/low-end/ltr/favicon-16x16.png" alt="img">
&lsquo;This process is not accepted&rsquo; - FC Utrecht set to challenge Eredivisie ruling after missing out on Europa League</p>
<p>The club will miss out on a European spot as a result of the decision to end the season</p>
<p>FC Utrecht have announced that the club will take legal action after being denied a European place as a result of the decision to end the Eredivisie season.</p>
<p>With Friday&rsquo;s statement that the Dutch season is officially over, Utrecht have been left on the outside looking in when it comes to a place.</p>
<p>The league confirmed on Friday that , and Willem II will head into the Europa League, while AZ Alkmaar and have booked spots.</p>
<p>FC Utrecht could have earned a Europa League berth by winning the KNVB Cup final against Feyenoord, but that match was cancelled along with the rest of the Dutch season. As a result, FC Utrecht will miss out on European football next season, but the club has indicated that it will challenge the decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;FC Utrecht does not accept the intended decision to distribute the European places,&rdquo; the club said in a statement. &ldquo;FC Utrecht does not hesitate to challenge the decision not to award a place to us before a sports tribunal and UEFA.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After written correspondence earlier today, the KNVB announced via a conference call that the European place will be allocated to numbers 1 to 5 in the current Eredivisie rankings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is unacceptable for FC Utrecht that the cup competition, for which the final has not been played, is completely ignored and does not count in the consideration of which club is entitled to a European ticket on sporting grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Europa League group stage ticket will be awarded to Feyenoord without any explanation based on the league table. FC Utrecht is just as entitled to this ticket as fellow cup finalist Feyenoord (and even more entitled because it has won a cup match more than Feyenoord), which is not included in the presentation of the decisions today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Additionally, FC Utrecht finished three points behind Willem II, who were given the fifth and final European spot despite playing one more match than the sixth-placed side. FC Utrecht finished the season with a far superior goal differential despite playing one fewer match, further adding to the club&rsquo;s frustrations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Based on the rankings, FC Utrecht is also shorted. We are at position six of the Eredivisie at the end of the competition, but the club has played a match less than Willem II,&rdquo; the club said</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the explanation, the KNVB has not spoken a word about the fact that FC Utrecht has played a match less than Willem II and would overtake the Tilburg team in the rankings if they win.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, FC Utrecht would have the same number of points, but a much better goal difference, more goals scored and a better mutual result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to FC Utrecht, the decision to shift the European place from the cup to the competition is not based on sporting grounds and cannot be justified in any other way. This is the main prize for another competition. The highest prize of the cup competition, which only two clubs are entitled to, cannot therefore simply be shifted according to regulations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact, during the call, the KNVB announced that shifting the place for the group stage of the Europa League from cup to competition may mean that UEFA will not allow the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The decision-making of the professional football board (the lack of transparency and objectivity) is therefore very much against FC Utrecht. This process is not accepted by the club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;FC Utrecht is convinced that the club is entitled to a place in European football on sporting grounds, because of the place in the cup final and because of the current Eredivisie ranking, where, with a game less played, we have better mutual results than compared to Willem II.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt that FC Utrecht deserves a European ticket based on the current season&rsquo;s sporting achievements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By contrast, senior figures at Willem II welcomed the decision and congratulated the KNVB on their decision making.</p>
<p>Director Martin van Geel said: &ldquo;It is a good thing that the KNVB made some hard decisions. Clubs have clarity now. We are appropriately proud. This is the icing on the cake of a very good season for us. We are happy with this outcome, but we also empathise with the clubs who experience unpleasant consequences.</p>
<p>Technical director Joris Mathijsen added: &ldquo;Of course we would have preferred to finish the season, but the health of all people is way more important. The remaining fact is that we deserve to be in fifth place, after great victories against Ajax, AZ and PSV, among others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van Geel also revealed the KNVB has asked the clubs who will be playing in Europe to donate 25 per cent of their prize money to the other Eredivisie teams.

<h3 id="eredivisie-dutch-top-flight-likely-to-be-cancelled-after-major-events-ban-extended">Eredivisie: Dutch top flight likely to be cancelled after major events ban extended</h3>

Ajax are ahead of AZ Alkmaar on goal difference at the top of the Eredivisie</p>
<p>The Dutch Football Association “intends not to continue” the Eredivisie season after the national government extended a ban on major events until 1 September because of coronavirus.</p>
<p>Ajax and AZ Alkmaar are leading the Dutch top flight level on points after 26 games, with Ajax ahead on goal difference.</p>
<p>Dutch football’s governing body KNVB said in a statement it “intends not to continue playing the 2019-20 competition” but will consult Uefa before making a final decision.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Uefa said some European leagues could be cancelled “in special cases” because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>“Based on the government&rsquo;s decision, the KNVB will consult with Uefa, after which the decision will be taken,” the KNVB statement continued.</p>
<p>“The KNVB has not yet definitively cancelled competitions because of financial difficulties in the football industry due to the corona crisis.”</p>
<p>Eredivisie clubs will meet on Friday “to discuss the consequences” of the decision, while training grounds will reopen “under strict conditions” so that players can train.</p>
<p>“It’s a massive blow for all the professional clubs at the highest level,” Dutch football journalist Marcel van der Kraan told BBC World Service.</p>
<p>“The Eredivisie was hoping they could resume. But we know it is impossible to organise matches with fans and the prime minister says it is not wise to do it without fans.”
