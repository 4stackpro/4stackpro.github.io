<h3 id="comment-contagiononce-science-fiction-but-now-all-too-real">COMMENT: Contagion….Once science fiction, but now all too real</h3>
<p><img src="https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2020/04/contag-e1587383024249.jpg" alt="img">
Right now, our best defence has been social distancing. No hand shaking, staying home when you’re sick and washing your hands frequently. How often have you heard this advice in recent weeks?</p>
<p>Every time you switch on the TV or radio, right? It may surprise you to know that these words were actually spoken by actor Laurence Fishburne in a Hollywood science fiction film released nearly a decade ago.</p>
<p>Contagion, which recently jumped back into the Netflix and iTunes charts, came and went without much fanfare in 2011. It didn’t win any major awards or capture the public’s imagination, and quickly faded into obscurity.</p>
<p>Now it’s the film of the year. And by that I mean, its a film about 2020.</p>
<p>© Warner Bros. Entertainment (YouTube)</p>
<p>Contagion, by director Steven Soderbergh, tells the many-stranded tale of a deadly global pandemic which is eerily familiar to the one we’re living through right now.</p>
<p>It forecasts everything that has become our new daily routine from social isolation to self distancing, deserted streets and empty supermarkets, PPE shortages, an Asian bat and a careless chef. There’s even an irresponsible broadcaster sharing wild conspiracy theories (ring a bell, Eamonn Holmes?).</p>
<p>The film’s behind-the-scenes science adviser, pathologist Tracey McNamara, said she wished it had been taken much more seriously. She said: “It really was a warning to the federal government that this could happen and you need to prepare.”</p>
<p>Contagion was always heavy going, but now it’s almost unbearable. However, there is a positive take-away, a glint amongst the gloom.</p>
<p>One thing the film “got wrong” is the almost complete collapse of civilised society, leading to a dramatic upsurge in crime and looting. This follows the shutdown of shops and supermarkets, while production and deliveries grind to a halt.</p>
<p>In our reality, this important difference between fact and fiction illustrates how key workers – retail staff, lorry drivers, refuse collectors to name but a few – really are a vital backbone, putting their own health on the line to stop us all from going to wrack and ruin.

<h3 id="contagion-adviser-regrets-that-the-2011-movie-didnt-do-more-to-educate-younger-populations">‘Contagion’ Adviser Regrets That the 2011 Movie Didn’t Do More to ‘Educate Younger Populations’</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Coronavirus-3.jpg" alt="img">
Many infectious disease and public health experts consulted on the 2011 movie Contagion. Recently, they shared their memories from working on the film. They also revealed their thoughts on the current COVID-19 global outbreak. One adviser, after seeing young people on spring break amid the coronavirus pandemic, regrets that Contagion‘s educational efforts didn’t quite reach the youth.</p>
<p>‘Contagion’ creators used research and expert opinions to guide them</p>

<p>CBNC reported recently that Contagion “incorporated input from more than a dozen scientists, emergency room doctors, bio-safety experts and epidemiologists.” They acknowledge that the “film is by no means flawlessly accurate.” Still, it did science better than a lot of Hollywood films do.</p>
<p>A financier for Contagion named Jeff Skoll saw the movie as “an opportunity to raise awareness about pandemics so that medical experts could get more funding.” But it didn’t stop with awareness. After Contagion come out in 2011, “epidemiologists took advantage of the public interest,” CNBC reported. They introduced a brand new public health tool.</p>
<p>Called “flunearyou,” the tool “tracked seasonal flu rates by asking members of the public to share their symptoms.” Boston Children’s Hospital’s chief innovation officer John Brownstein, said of Contagion: “It was entertainment, but it was also advocacy.”</p>
<p>Brownstein is now hard at work on a coronavirus version of “fluenearyou.” He’s calling it–you guessed it–“covidnearyou.”</p>
<p>Scientific consultant calls the 2011 movie ‘very accurate’</p>
<p>Also quoted in the CNBC article is Natasha Griffith, another scientist who consulted on Contagion. At the time, Griffith “directed the operations and safety program for [UCLA’s] high-containment research facilities.” She recalled the intense training she did with the Contagion cast:</p>
<p>I’d spent whole days with the actors. I even remember the submarine doors we used, where there’s a gasket that inflates between the doors that means you can’t open it immediately. So I practiced that with them, and we even counted to ten to make sure that it was enough time for the light to turn from red to green.</p>

<p>Griffith even asked Soderbergh to “stop moving through the lab and touching things without gloves.”</p>
<p>“In a real biocontainment lab you can’t have fingerprints on those stainless steel surfaces because you are in a suit,” she explained. But the scientist was content with the film as a whole.</p>
<p>“I was very happy they listened and it was scientifically very accurate.” Griffith told CNBC.</p>
<p>‘Contagion’ expert says they could have done a better job spreading the ‘public health messaging to millennials’ before the coronavirus pandemic</p>
<p>However, despite all its research and fact-checking, there are some things Contagion never could have foreseen about a real global pandemic. Dr. Mark Smolinski was another expert on the 2011 movie. Smolinski, upon seeing the videos of young people on the beach on spring break, realized something about Contagion.</p>
<p>“It struck him that the film could have done more to educate younger populations,” CNBC reported.</p>
<p>“We need to get public health messaging to millennials,” Smolinski said.</p>
<p>But both Smolinski and Griffith want the COVID-19 pandemic to be a “wake up call.” So, if you forget what happened in Contagion–or you just (understandably) don’t want to rewatch it–let the real thing be lesson.
