Whether you&rsquo;re a fan of all Pixar movies (and have already devoured Disney Plus&rsquo;s collection) or are looking for something to entertain the kids under lockdown, you can already stream the latest release from the iconic animation studio - here&rsquo;s how to watch Onward online wherever you are right now.</p>
<p>Onward cheat sheet Released: 2020 Director: Dan Scanlon Cast: Tom Holland, Chris Pratt, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Octavia Spencer Run time: 103 mins Rating (US/UK): PG / U</p>
<p>Featuring voice-overs from Hollywood stars like Tom Holland, Chris Pratt and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Onward is the fantastical tale of two teenage elves, brothers Ian and Barley Lightfoot.</p>
<p>The duo come from a modern suburban world where technology has overtaken magic, but desperate to spend one last day with their father - who died before they could remember him - they adventure to find one last bit of magic and make their dream a reality.</p>
<p>As a Pixar film, it&rsquo;s now landed on Disney Plus in the US and Canada. But those wanting to watch Onward online have a number of options - allow us to explain how to stream the hit movie in full today.</p>
<p>All the new shows and movies coming to Disney Plus in April 2020</p>
<p>How to watch Onward: online streaming options in the US</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re already a Disney Plus subscriber, then there&rsquo;s good news - Onward is available to watch on the platform now. Disney Plus has apps for iOS and Android (of course), and is available to watch online via the likes of Amazon Fire TV Stick, PS4, Xbox One and Roku streaming devices. If you don&rsquo;t already have it, Disney Plus actually represents fantastic value. For $6.99 per month (or $69.99 for the year) you get access to Disney movie classics, Pixar greatness (including all four Toy Story films), The Simpsons, Star Wars, Marvel movies&hellip;the list goes on! But even better news is that you can get a 7-day FREE TRIAL to Disney Plus, meaning you can enjoy Onward and all the rest without paying anything. Streaming Onward in the US without Disney Plus is just as simple, as it&rsquo;s available to rent and buy on a large number of popular services. Most people will no doubt be familiar with Amazon Prime Video, where it can be &lsquo;bought&rsquo; for $19.99 in UHD. Sound a bit steep? You can also rent it on iTunes for $4.99.</p>
<p>How to watch Onward online in Canada</p>
<p>As south of the border, so above, too. Canadian fans of Pixar movies can also now watch Onward online by getting a Disney+ subscription or free trial. Microsoft Store and iTunes will also both let you stream Onward for CA$24.99.</p>
<p>Adults can also find out how to watch Contagion online</p>
<p>How to watch Onward online: full UK streaming options</p>
<p>Those in the UK currently wanting to watch Onward unfortunately can&rsquo;t do so right away - even if you&rsquo;re willing to pay a full rental fee. Therefore, the only option right now is to wait/hope for its official release on Disney Plus. It&rsquo;s available for just Â£5.99 a month and there&rsquo;s a FREE 7-day trial on offer so you can check it out for yourself. We&rsquo;re hoping that Onward releases on Disney+ UK in pretty short order now that it has in the US, but there&rsquo;s been no confirmation on this. If that&rsquo;s the case, it&rsquo;s a shame, but there&rsquo;s loads of other great content on Disney+ to enjoy including plenty more Pixar movies as well as The Mandalorian, every Simpsons episode, and a whole host of Marvel movies.</p>
<p>Grown-ups can also check out how to watch The Invisible Man</p>
<p>How to watch Onward in Australia</p>
<p>The good news is that Australia has its own version of the excellent Disney+ streaming service - the slightly bad news is that those Down Under are being made to wait until April 24 before Onward is made available. So our advice if you&rsquo;re desperate to watch is to wait until then and then claim the free trial to watch Onward online absolutely free!

<h3 id="onward-is-now-available-on-disney-plus">âOnwardâ Is Now Available on Disney Plus</h3>
<p><img src="https://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2020/03/Onward1.png?w=1200&amp;h=0&amp;zc=1&amp;s=0&amp;a=t&amp;q=89" alt="img">
Onward, Pixarâs latest animated film, has made it from theaters to on demand to streaming on Disney+ in record time. (âTimeâ must be viewed relatively here, because it feels like Onward opened in theaters about 65 years ago even though itâs actually been less than a month.)</p>
<p>The movie premiered on March 6, just as the coronavirus pandemic began to pick up steam in the United States. While Onward did end up making $104 million worldwide before theaters were closed to comply with social distancing guidelines, itâs far and away Pixarâs lowest-grossing movie in history. (The troubled The Good Dinosaur was the companyâs previous biggest flop, and it made more than three times that amount in theaters.) Trying to make the best of a bad situation, Disney released Onward on VOD two weeks ago â and now, less an a month after its theatrical debut, itâs already available on Disney+.</p>
<p>Thatâs good news for subscribers; the film is a fun and sweet adventure about a pair of brothers (voiced by Tom Holland and Chris Pratt) who set off on a quest in their Dungeons &amp; Dragons-inspired world to bring their late father back to life for one more day. The cast also includes Julia Louis-Dreyfus as the brothersâ loving mom, and Octavia Spencer as a fantasy creature known as a manticore. While far from Pixarâs greatest work, Onward would have undeniably fared better with audiences if it had come out at literally any other time in history. A lot of people who are stuck at home are going to enjoy the film on Disney+, so thatâs a small upside. Hereâs the filmâs trailer.</p>
<p>The direct link to Onward on Disney+ is right here. (You can also read our full review of the film at this link.) Happy viewing.

<h3 id="sonic-bad-boys-and-the-new-movies-you-can-now-watch-from-home">Sonic, Bad Boys, and the new movies you can now watch from home</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xFa3mNcVpHezCYfVK-OJW8Jpssg=/66x0:1607x807/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19718374/sth_ff_018_graded.jpg" alt="img">
People around the world are staying inside in order to flatten the curve of the coronavirus pandemic, and in turn, thereâs a greater demand for home video entertainment than ever before. Thatâs prompted streaming sites to offer loads of content, from HBO releasing free movies and shows, CBS offering free trials of All Access, and Netflix dropping Tiger King, the most absorbing true crime series in ages, just in time for our collective attention.</p>
<p>But the strange absence of movie theaters in our pop culture lives has also pushed Hollywood studios, normally concentrated on new theatrical releases, to meet the demand. This week, another batch of major blockbusters and tiny indies flood digital VOD platforms, giving audiences a treat that only a few weeks ago would have required a car ride and the price of a few tickets.</p>
<p>If youâre sitting at home this weekend wondering what to watch, here are a few of the new titles now available.</p>
<p>Sonic the Hedgehog</p>
<p>Where to watch it: Buy on digital $19.99 on Amazon and Apple</p>
<p>If the original design of live-action Sonic scared you off from the video game adaptation, now is your chance to discover why Sonic the Hedgehog might be some young viewerâs Shrek in 15 years. The movie is chock full of pop culture references and flatulence, but for the adults, thereâs also game nostalgia and Jim Carrey. From our official review:</p>
<p>Carrey, delivering the most gonzo performance since Tom Hardyâs Venom, becomes literal comic relief for adults who wind up at Sonic the Hedgehog. His Robotnik amalgamates Ace Ventura, the Riddler, the Mask, and the Grinch into one lump of evil Silly Putty, stretching and spasming as he spits out one-liners. In his early introduction, the mustache-twirling villain chews out an army officer by asking if he has weekend plans to âdrink beers and put the boat in the water,â an evocative but murky character assassination. Carrey shows up for the kids in the room, performing a three-minute dance routine inside his laser-light-filled Mad Scientist Van, but for the most part, heâs running parallel to Sonic, delighting in the cartoon logic the movie affords him.</p>
<p>Oh, and youâll really want to catch the movie before the inevitable Sonic 2. Yes, of course thereâs a post-credit scene!</p>
<p>Onward</p>
<p>Where to watch it: Stream it on Disney Plus</p>
<p>In our review of the animated fantasy epic, Tasha Robinson noted that any Pixar film arrives with âoutsized expectations,â and that while Onward is âcolorful and charming,â itâs also âsafe, simple, and soft-edged compared to Pixarâs wilder swings for the outfield.â</p>
<p>Thereâs nothing wrong with this model of film for Pixar. Itâs exciting to see the studio finally creating a new world, and the brotherly team-up at the filmâs heart feels like a new model for a collection of storytellers that have focused on unlikely found families as often as theyâve focused on flesh-and-blood families. Onward takes a few representation steps forward as well, with a female character (voiced by Lena Waithe) who casually mentions her girlfriend; a prominent role for Octavia Spencer; and a pair of middle-aged-lady characters who get some nice bonding moments together and some action scenes of their own â both a rarity in animated features.</p>
<p>After only two weeks in theaters, Disney surprise-released Onward on digital platforms. Now itâs on Disney Plus for subscribers to watch for free. In a way, itâs a historical moment.</p>
<p>Once you check out the movie, read our interview with story supervisor Kelsey Mann to hear the wild ideas that didnât make it to the screen.</p>
<p>Bad Boys for Life</p>
<p>Where to watch it: Buy on digital $19.99 on Amazon and Apple</p>
<p>In the third Bad Boys movie, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are past their prime. Thankfully, thatâs the point. To put it another way, from our original review:</p>
<p>A third of the way into Bad Boys for Life, the trilogy-capper of Michael Bayâs hyperkinetic, hyper-saturated action franchise, Martin Lawrenceâs Marcus Burnett takes a nap. Mike Lowery (Will Smith) is hot on the trail of a motorcycle-driving assailant who gunned him down mid-wheelie, and he could probably use Marcusâ help. But with a new grandson, a loving marriage, and the weight of old(er) age keeping him down, Marcus feels less Bad Boy than La-Z-Boy. What would once have been a montage of roadsters and machine-gun fire is now a cross-cutting gag of Mikeâs across-the-line info-gathering tactics and Marcus in full recline. Itâs a riot.</p>
<p>Though envisioned as the end of a trilogy, Bad Boys for Life made a whopping $425 million worldwide in January, so &hellip; watch it before a sequel arrives. Bad Boys 4Ever?</p>
<p>Never Rarely Sometimes Always</p>
<p>Eliza Hittmanâs new drama, about a young woman who travels from a rural Pennsylvania town to New York to receive a legal abortion, earned rave reviews out of Sundance 2020 in January. The film bowed in mid-March &hellip; just as every movie theater in America started to close. Now Focus Features has released the film on VOD, so people can learn what all the buzz is about. In her review, Karen Han gets to heart of why a movie that could easily be a didactic issue movie becomes so heartfelt.</p>
<p>Hittman gets all this across simply by portraying the unfolding events honestly. Everything that happens is relatively mundane, and the sense of dread hanging over the proceedings only reflects that the world we live in can be frightening, particularly for those with little recourse. Nothing in the movie feels exaggerated or unbelievable, making Autumnâs struggle all the more devastating. The things occurring to her occur to real women every day, and cinematographer HÃ©lÃ¨ne Louvart makes the unfolding events feel truer by going handheld, shakily following the young women around the city.</p>
<p>Once you check out this incredible drama, read our interview with Hittman, where she explains how she strived to carve out a truer reality than most of what we see on screen.</p>
<p>New on Netflix this weekend</p>
<p>Community seasons 1 - 6 are finally on the platform</p>
<p>Coffee &amp; Kareem, a R-rated comedy starring Ed Helms that sounds &hellip; interesting</p>
<p>The Matrix Reloaded, which you may never be able to see in its original form, but itâs still pretty fun!</p>
<p>Martin Scorseseâs Taxi Driver, a little shorter than The Irishman</p>
<p>And hereâs what dropped last Friday:</p>
<p>Bloodshot</p>
<p>Where to watch it: Buy on digital for $19.99 on Amazon and Apple</p>
<p>Universal kicked Vin Dieselâs F9 an entire year once the scope of coronavirus became apparent, but his latest film was already in theaters when everything began to go on hiatus. That left Sony with a major action movie and no theatrical audience. The movie arrives to digital this week so people can get a taste of what Dieselâs doing with his non-Fast times, which according to our review, is emulating Sylvester Stallone in a superhero movie with loads of meta-humor.</p>
<p>If Rayâs backstory and motivations seem a little hacky, and his enemyâs dancing glee feels contrived, maybe itâs because his actions are being scripted. The movie has some fun with this idea, as characters are allowed to complain about clichÃ©s, and each other (âheâs such a relentless dick,â one of the other super-soldiers grouses about his driven new colleague), raising the possibility that Gina literally dying inside of a refrigerator is meta-commentary related to a famous comics trope.</p>
<p>And if youâre confused as to who or what a âBloodshotâ is, we have you covered. The character has a strange comic history.</p>
<p>Birds of Prey</p>
<p>Where to watch it: Buy on digital for $19.99 on Amazon and Apple</p>
<p>After six weeks in theaters, Warner Bros.â brought Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) to video on demand. That means that everybody who didnât see it in theaters â and there are a lot of you â can now enjoy the adventures of Harley and Co. right from your own couch. And we recommend it.</p>
<p>Birds of Prey is a glimpse of the future: A woman-led superhero movie that doesnât groan under the pressure of being [announcer voice] A Woman-Led Superhero Movie. Cathy Yanâs riotous action-comedy â starring a half a dozen women, but mostly starring Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn â reveals just how much can be gained when creators and characters are emancipated from tokenism. Which is all to say: Birds of Prey is a messy, leg-breaking, heartwarming, inspirational good time.</p>
<p>For Birds of Prey, Warner Bros. rolled a ton of comic history into one super team-up vehicle. Hereâs a deep dive into just about choice in this wacky circus of a movie.</p>
<p>Call of the Wild</p>
<p>Where to watch it: Buy on digital for $14.99 on Amazon and Apple</p>
<p>A holdover from Disneyâs acquisition of the 21st Century Fox, the new Jack London adaptation did not fare well with the critics when it landed in theaters in February. Directed by veteran animator Chris Sanders (Lilo &amp; Stitch, How to Train Your Dragon) the film was a little too hokey for most people, and stories of producing the CG dog overshadowed anything Harrison Ford brought to the screen. Time (and an eventual Disney Plus release) may do this one favors.</p>
<p>I Still Believe</p>
<p>Where to watch it: Rent on digital $19.99 on Amazon and Apple</p>
<p>Directed by the Erwin Brothers, a directing duo whoâve made a name for themselves in the Christian drama department, I Still Believe chronicles the romance and eventual marriage of singer-songwriter Jeremy Camp (Riverdaleâs KJ Apa) and his first wife, Melissa Lynn Henning-Camp (Britt Robertson). Just before the two tied the knot, Melissa was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She would pass away just a few months later.</p>
<p>Downhill</p>
<p>Where to watch it: Buy on digital $9.99 on Amazon and Apple</p>
<p>A remake of the tremendous French film Force Majeure, Downhill stars Will Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus as a married couple at odds after the man in the equation flees a (potential) avalanche and leaves his family behind. All reports suggest that Downhill is a straightforward reworking of the first film, so expect two comedians at the top of their game sparring for our delight.</p>
<p>The Gentleman</p>

<p>Guy Ritchie (Snatch, Aladdin) returns to his crime roots with this ensemble dramedy featuring Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Henry Golding, Colin Farrell, and Hugh Grant.. To be honest, we werenât big fans. As Karen Han put it:</p>
<p>Early on in The Gentlemen, would-be drug kingpin Dry Eye (Henry Golding) tells weed baron Mickey Pearson (Matthew McConaughey) that the young will replace the old. Pearson disagrees: The rule of the metaphorical jungle is that the strong will devour the weak. Pearson may be getting older, but he isnât losing his edge; heâs still the king because heâs the best at what he does. Maybe thatâs true within the world of the movie, but when it comes to Guy Ritchieâs trajectory as a director, it seems that the rules arenât mutually exclusive. Ritchie is no longer the strongest beast in the forest, and heâs aging out of the game, too.</p>
<p>The Way Back</p>
<p>Where to watch it: Buy on digital $19.99 on Amazon and Apple</p>
<p>There are no sports on right now, but there are sports movies. Ben Affleck himself has said that he funneled his own issues with drinking and depression into this story of a basketball coach finding his way back to the court. As Sheila OâMalley writes at RogerEbert.com, who says itâs a classic sports melodrama with a bespoke role for the hit-or-miss actor.</p>
<p>The Way Back is, essentially, a redemption arc. Jack is weighed down with disappointment. Affleck is in a very personal zone here. When he gets angry, thereâs something still bottled up in his beet-red face. Thereâs no catharsis in his rage; it remains poison in his veins. Thereâs also a thrumming sense of self-pity in him, so accurate if youâve ever known any addicts. Affleck does not shy away from the characterâs unpleasantness. Heâs right in it, with the manâs flaws and failures. The script is well-structured. Information is withheld from us until far into the action.
