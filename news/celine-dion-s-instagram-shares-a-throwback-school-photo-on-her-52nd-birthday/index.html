She has been a giant in the music industry for more than three decades.</p>
<p>And Celine Dion marked her 52nd birthday on Monday just weeks after cancelling her Courage world tour amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Her team posted to mark her special day with a throwback photo of the singer as a child and to wish her a happy day on Instagram.</p>
<p>Then and now: Celine Dion marked her 52nd birthday on Monday and her team posted a throwback photo from her school days to Instagram</p>
<p>In the photo, a young Celine posed in front of a sky blue background for a school portrait.</p>
<p>She had her brunette locks cut just above her shoulder with jagged cut bangs during her childhood in Charlemagne, Quebec Canada.</p>
<p>For the photo she wore a green and red plaid dress with a high and keyhole neckline.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Happy Birthday, Celine! Wishing you health, love and happiness,&rsquo; the caption read in French and English, signed off by &lsquo;Team Celine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Star power: &lsquo;Happy Birthday, Celine! Wishing you health, love and happiness,&rsquo; the caption read in French and English, signed off by &lsquo;Team Celine,&rsquo; she celebrates her special day amid the global pandemic, COVID-19 which has forced cities to ask residents around the world to stay home and avoid public places and groups of people (pictured in January)</p>
<p>Celine didn&rsquo;t share any information herself about how she is spending her birthday, though it is likely she is with her children Rene, 19, and twins Nelson and Eddy, nine, who she shared with her late husband Rene Angelil, who passed in 2016.</p>
<p>She is celebrating her birthday amid the global pandemic that has caused much of the affected countries and cities to go on lockdown, encouraging residents to stay home and avoid contact with people.</p>
<p>Just two weeks ago her Courage Tour became one more statistic in the tally of events postponed or cancelled due to the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Her official Twitter account tweeted a brief message, saying: &lsquo;Céline Dion #CourageWorldTour dates postponed in North America. Show dates from March 24 through April 27, 2020 to be rescheduled. - Team Céline.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On hold: One day after postponing two concerts because she has a &lsquo;common cold&rsquo;, she suspended her Courage World Tour through the end of April (pictured in 2019)</p>
<p>The affected gigs are in the US and Canada.</p>
<p>Her official rescheduled date announcements came just two days after she cancelled two dates due to a cold.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On Monday night, a day after completing a six-show run in the New York area, Celine began feeling the symptoms of a common cold,&rsquo; her team said in a statement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The symptoms persisted into Tuesday, and her doctors instructed her to rest for the next 5-7 days. After testing her, the doctors concluded that her virus was not related to COVID-19.&rsquo;
