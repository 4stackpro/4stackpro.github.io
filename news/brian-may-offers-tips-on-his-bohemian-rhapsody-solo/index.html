How are you spending your time in self-isolation? The New York Times, among others, has a list of recommended activities for those who are spending a lot more time at home than expected. These range from brushing up on Westerns to getting really into weaving. But some of you might be eyeing a guitar in the corner of the room. Maybe you’ve had it for a while; maybe you’ve always held dreams of playing a genuinely amazing solo on stage somewhere.</p>
<p>Social isolation might not help with the “stage” part of that, but the solo is a different story. Guitar World has the details: Queen’s Brian May has offered his tips on playing the iconic solo from “Bohemian Rhapsody.”</p>
<p>Since his period in social isolation began, May has been offering “micro-concerts” on Instagram. And he’s taking requests.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, May’s “Bohemian Rhapsody” solo was among the most-requested compositions there. And so May performed it, followed by a breakdown of how exactly the solo came together — and how enterprising guitarists can try it on their own.</p>
<p>It’s a fascinating breakdown of an excellent solo, guided along by the steady presence and candid commentary of May. One could say that it’s an almost scientific examination of the song — and given that May himself holds a doctorate in astrophysics, that doesn’t feel like too much of a stretch.</p>
<p>So maybe it’s time to plug your guitar into your amp, get your picks at the ready and give it a go. Practice makes perfect, after all.</p>

<h3 id="freddie-mercury-queen-stars-lover-mary-austin-on-truth-about-bohemian-rhapsody">Freddie Mercury: Queen star&rsquo;s lover Mary Austin on TRUTH about Bohemian Rhapsody</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/35/750x445/1261378.jpg" alt="img">
Freddie Mercur y may have been a larger-than-life figure on stage, going down in history as one of the greatest performers of all time, but away from the spotlight it was a different story. The Queen star’s friends remember him as a shy and modest person, worlds away from his public persona. In a newly unearthed interview, his former girlfriend Mary Austin revealed how Bohemian Rhapsody had changed something in Mercury.</p>
<p>Speaking out on the true Mercury, Austin told the Daily Mail the frontman was a complicated mixture of self-doubt and self-confidence.</p>
<p>It was his mini opera Bohemian Rhapsody, one of his greatest hits, which provided the key to unlocking his potential, however.</p>
<p>In 1975, Queen released the bombastic, six-minute epic that was to go on to become one of their career-defining songs.</p>
<p>Penned by Mercury, Bohemian Rhapsody, which gave its name to the 2018 biopic about his life, featured a introduction, ballad segment, operatic movement and a rock-heavy interlude, concluding with a coda.</p>

Remember the video of the quarantined Italian citizen channeling his best Brian May by blasting the electric guitar solo from Queen’s We Will Rock You out into the world from his balcony in Rome?</p>
<p>Well, now the real Brian May has gotten in on the action.</p>
<p>There hasn’t been much good news coming as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, but May has offered at least some respite from the daily onslaught of frightening information with his “MicroConcerto” video postings on his official Instagram page.</p>
<p>After posing a question to his audience, “What would you like me to play?,” in one of these installments, the answer came back:</p>
<p>“The one that probably was asked most of all was the solo that goes in the middle of that very complex tune written by Freddie [Mercury] called Bohemian Rhapsody,” May says.</p>
<p>Related: Coronavirus prevention measures take their toll on astronomy Updates: The coronavirus pandemic impacts on space exploration</p>
<p>And with that May, with Red Special in hand, tears into the iconic solo and then breaks it down step by step, which you can see in the accompanying video.</p>
<p>As for what kind of gear he’s using for the MicroConcerts?</p>
<p>“The answer is not very much, because I can’t get into my studio at the moment,” May says.</p>
<p>“I’m taking the self-isolation thing very seriously, as I think you have to in order for us to stand a chance of keeping this virus in check.”</p>
<p>The Red Special he is playing, he explains, “is straight off the production line of Brian May Guitars, and I signed it and then I realized I really liked this one. This one has a particularly beautiful grain so I’m going to keep this one for a while at least and play with it.”</p>
<p>From there, May trains his iPhone camera on a Vox Mini5 Rhythm five-watt modeling amp. “It’s very small but it does lots of stuff,” he says.</p>
<p>“It’s got a lovely selector [switch] which sort of tunes you from 1970s to the present day,&rdquo; May continues.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I’m actually on California Metal at the moment which means that Queen must have been well ahead of their time.”</p>
<p>The only quintessential piece of May gear missing from the performance? His famous six-pence plectrum.</p>
<p>“I use the fingernail now a lot more and tonight it just seemed appropriate,&rdquo; May explains.</p>
<p>“It gives me a lot of control on the sound and the feel.”</p>
