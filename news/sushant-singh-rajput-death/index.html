<p>Updated: Jun 15, 2020 12:29 IST</p>
<p>Actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death should be investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Jan Adhikar Party chief Pappu Yadav demanded on Monday.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput, who dropped out of an engineering college to pursue a career in Bollywood and delivered several hit films over the past decade, was found dead in his apartment in Mumbai on Sunday. He was 34.</p>
<p>Dattatreya Bargude, an assistant commissioner of Mumbai Police, confirmed the actor’s death and said that no “note” was found at his residence.</p>
<p>“I cannot imagine how this happened. I request the government to launch a CBI inquiry. I think there is a deep conspiracy behind his death. Sushant cannot commit suicide,” Pappu Yadav told reporters.</p>
<p>“I want a CBI inquiry in the matter. Sushant was a workaholic and good man, not the kind of person that would commit suicide. He rose from the bottom. Made Bihar proud. Now the state of Bihar is in mourning,” he added.</p>
<p>Yadav also claimed that it could be a case of homicide.</p>
<p>Rajput was born in Bihar’s capital of Patna and was the youngest of five children of a government employee. He completed his schooling in Delhi before securing a seat in an engineering college in the Capital in 2003.</p>
<p>He dropped out of the course to pursue acting professionally three years later and joined the Barry John Acting School.</p>
<p>The actor landed his first role in the Hindi serial, Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil, in 2008 but gained popularity the next year with his character in the popular soap, Pavitra Rishta.</p>
<p>He debuted in Bollywood in 2013 with the movie Kai Po Che!, adapted from a novel by Chetan Bhagat but became a household name with the success of MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, a biopic on the World Cup-winning Indian cricket captain, in 2016.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput was last seen in Nitesh Tiwari’s Chhichhore in 2019 and also acted in the thriller Drive that was released on Netflix the same year.</p>

<p><img src="https://c.ndtvimg.com/2019-01/f747m5no_sushant-singh-rajput_625x300_15_January_19.jpg" alt="img">
Actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his Mumbai home.</p>
<p>Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his home in Mumbai, police said today, confirming his suicide. He was 34.</p>
<p>The popular actor was recently seen in the film &ldquo;Chhichhore&rdquo; - which dealt with the extreme pressure of college and competitive exams. His last appearance was in the Netflix film &ldquo;Drive&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput had put up a moving post just last week when his former manager Disha Salian was found dead. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s such devastating news,&rdquo; the actor had written on Instagram.</p>
<p>His last post on Instagram was dedicated to his mother, whose death in 2002 left him devastated. &ldquo;Blurred past evaporating from teardrops, unending dreams carving an arc of smile And a fleeting life, negotiating between the two,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>Rajput, who became a household name with his hit television series &ldquo;Pavitra Rishta&rdquo;, debuted in films in 2013 with the critically acclaimed &ldquo;Kai Po Che!&rdquo; based on Chetan Bhagat&rsquo;s bestselling book &ldquo;The Three Mistakes of My Life&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The movie catapulted Rajput into the big league and he went on to do several films. He also played MS Dhoni in the former skipper&rsquo;s biopic, for which he was nominated for film awards.</p>
<p>He played the eponymous role of Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! in the 2015 thriller. He had a supporting role in Aamir Khan&rsquo;s 2014 hit PK. In 2018, Rajput starred in Kedarnath opposite debutante Sara Ali Khan.</p>
<p>Rajput was born in Patna. He studied engineering and was a National Olympiad Winner in Physics.</p>
<p>He said in interviews that after his involvement in theatre and dance, he rarely had time for studies. He eventually dropped out of engineering just a year short of his degree to pursue an acting career.</p>
<p>A shell-shocked film industry posted tributes on Twitter. &ldquo;Honestly this news has left me shocked and speechless&hellip;I remember watching #SushantSinghRajput in Chhichhore and telling my friend Sajid, its producer how much I&rsquo;d enjoyed the film and wish I&rsquo;d been a part of it. Such a talented actor&hellip;may God give strength to his family,&rdquo; Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No No No!!!!! Horrible heartbreaking news of the passing of #SushantSinghRajput ! Shocking &amp; sad beyond words!!! Goodbye Sushant.. you were such a wonderful performer and had such a long long way to go! Don&rsquo;t know what you were going through but I&rsquo;m sorry for your suffering! Red heart (sic),&rdquo; Swara Bhaskar posted, condoling his death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The news of Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s death is truly sad. What a tragic loss Deepest condolences to his family &amp; loved ones. May his soul find eternal peace,&rdquo; actor Ajay Devgn wrote.</p>
<p>Abhishek Bachchan tweeted: &ldquo;This is just so shocking. A wonderful talent. RIP Sushant&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Last month, death of seasoned actors - Rishi Kapoor and Irrfan Khan - left the country in grief and shock.</p>

<p><img src="https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/715_-/2020/06/sushmita-1592184964.jpg" alt="img">
The country was left in shock after the news of actor Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s suicide started doing rounds. The 34-year-old Bollywood actor was found hanging at his Bandra residence on June 14. When there was no response after repeated knocks, his domestic help called the neighbours after which police arrived shortly and broke into his room where he was found hanging around 12.30 pm. It came to light that he was suffering from depression and was even getting treatment from Hinduja hospital for the last six months. After the untimely death of the stay, various celebrities were left in shock and had only one question as to why he took the drastic step. One amongst those was actress Sushmita Sen who took to her social media to share a long post and spoke about how it is important to stay positive in life because a person is only responsible for his own happiness. She even spoke about how insecurities can grow in the life of a celebrity with name and sometimes, bank balance.</p>
<p>Sushmita shared a photo that read, &lsquo;protect your peace.&rsquo; Alongside she wrote the long post reading, &ldquo;Look good, show good&hellip;be good..ALL THE TIME!! Projection becomes one’s life, both on &amp; off screen. Insecurities grow with name &amp; sometimes, bank balance. All these may be known triggers in an actors life&hellip;but it’s actually true about a lot of us from all different walks of life&hellip;only differing in magnitude &amp; visibility!! Young people with so much life &amp; promise ahead of them, some with great depth &amp; will power&hellip;can choose to take their own life is deeply disturbing. How do we say, we know people &amp; still not see it coming? Have we become experts at hiding our pain or does no one have the time to really SEE it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further, she said, &ldquo;How lonely &amp; hopeless can prolonged silence make you? Do we alienate a life by judging it constantly? In the race of the projection of “look good, show good, be good” have we lost the most important ability to FEEL GOOD? Life has its share of pressures for EVERYONE&hellip;no one is excused that, no matter what your standing!! Life is a graph with its ups &amp; downs for EVERYONE, even if we can’t always see it. Yet, FIGHT FOR LIFE WE MUST&hellip;it’s the only vehicle that will help lead us from bad times to GOOD ONES again!!! “WHEN YOU’RE TIRED&hellip; LEARN TO REST, NOT QUIT.&rdquo;</p>
