<h3 id="ill-fight-on-an-island-too--paige-vanzants-latest-message-to-dana-white-has-fans-bemused">“I’ll Fight On An Island Too!!”- Paige VanZant’s Latest Message to Dana White has Fans Bemused</h3>
<p><img src="https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/20200408155425/11518-paige-vanzant-1.jpg" alt="img">
Paige VanZant became the latest fighter to throw her name into the hat for future UFC events. The Flyweight fighter tweeted, “I’ll fight on an island too!!” She tagged the official UFC handle, UFC President Dana White and UFC matchmaker Mick Maynard.</p>
<p>‘PVZ’ has not entered the Octagon for over a year. Her last fight was in January 2019 against Rachael Ostovich. She was scheduled to face Amanda Ribas at the latest UFC event. However, the fighter fractured her arm and had to pull out. Her latest tweet shows that her injury has healed sufficiently enough to allow her to return to the Octagon.</p>
<p>Paige VanZant wants to return to action</p>
<p>Paige VanZant is under quarantine like most other people. But she is spending it in a rather unique way. The 26-year-old posted a series of nude pictures with strategic coverings on her Instagram. She and her husband were shown working out, cooking, gardening and just posing in the buff.</p>

<p>If White takes her up on her offer, it will be ‘PVZ’s final UFC fight on her current contract. She revealed plans on exploring her options as one can’t find value until they are free agents. She told SCMP, “the only people that can set your value are the people that you’re signed with.“</p>
<p>Twitter users remember her Instagram activities as well as her history with injuries and came up with some sneaky replies to the tweet.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll break your arm just getting there! — J N J (@JbeforeJAY) April 7, 2020</p>
<p>you injured just tweeting this — Gustavo Silva (@GusMUFC_7) April 7, 2020</p>
<p>Be careful when Tweeting so you don&rsquo;t break your fingers — Ferguson112 (@CrackSonnen) April 7, 2020</p>
<p>This isn’t Naked and Afraid — David Klen (@D_Klen11) April 7, 2020</p>
<p>UFC 249 will take place on 18th April. The main event will see Tony Ferguson fight Justin Gaethje for the Interim Lightweight Championship. The card also features a match between Jessica Andrade and Rose Namajunas.</p>
<p>Dana White has said he will hold fights every week at the secret UFC location. He also hinted at only United States-based fighters competing, as it will be easy for them to travel domestically. He will need to transport more fighters to the undisclosed location if he is to succeed in his aim to hold weekly fights and get normalcy back into the country.</p>
<p>Will White and Maynard consider PVZ’s tweet?

<h3 id="paige-vanzant-gives-a-much-awaited-update-on-her-career">Paige VanZant Gives a Much Awaited Update on Her Career</h3>
<p><img src="https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/20200404002319/paige-vanzant-holds-an-open-workout-for-fans-and-media-at-news-photo-904322896-1567186956-448x315.jpeg" alt="img">
UFC women’s flyweight fighter Paige VanZant has recently revealed details about her upcoming free agency plans. She admits that she is open to any and every offer.</p>
<p>Her upcoming fight will mark the final obligation she has to the UFC as per her contract. VanZant plans on exploring her options as a free agent thereafter.</p>
<p>“I want to prove my worth. You truly can’t find what your value is until you’re a free agent. When you’re locked into a contract, the only people that can set your value are the people that you’re signed with.”- Paige VanZant to SCMP</p>
<p>Now that 12 Gauge is finally free from injuries, she is keen to take on a new fight and prove her mettle as a successful fighter. Following her last fight with the UFC, the fighter is unaware of what the future has in store for her. However, ONE Championship and Bellator seem to be the biggest players in this scenario.</p>
<p>“I do well in fighting and in Hollywood. I do well in all kinds of ventures that come my way. A lot of it will be about who’s going to open those doors for me. There’s a lot of amazing organizations out there. If there wasn’t, I would never be testing free agency.”- Paige VanZant</p>
<p>VanZant claims that she has had a great relationship with the UFC. However, compensation has been a tiny thorn in her side.</p>
<p>“I do honestly have a really good relationship with the UFC. I appreciate everything they’ve done for me. The hard thing is, other than my compensation, I am very happy with the UFC. So it’s not going to be as crazy as a negotiation process as a lot of people think. There’s a lot to talk about, but I think it’s going to be a fairly easy conversation.”- Paige VanZant</p>
<p>The fighter recently turned 26 years old and has an entire career ahead of her. The fan-favorite flyweight and strawweight contender has been out of the octagon after sustaining arm injuries for quite some time. However, she is now healthy to take on her next challenge.</p>
<p>VanZant holds a record of 8-4. Having sustained three losses in her last five appearances, she is not on a very high note as of now. The last fight saw her take on Rachael Ostovich. 12 gauge took home the win after forcing a submission out of her fellow American flyweight.</p>
<p>Where do you see Paige VanZant in the near future?
