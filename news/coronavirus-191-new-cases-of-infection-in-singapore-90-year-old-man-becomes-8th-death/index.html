SINGAPORE - Singapore reported 191 new cases of Covid-19 infection on Saturday (April 11).</p>
<p>This means there are now 2,299 cases here, according to latest figures released by the Ministry of Health (MOH).</p>
<p>A 90-year-old Singaporean man has also died from complications due to the infection, the eighth such death here.</p>
<p>He was Case 1,142 and was a locally transmitted and unlinked case. He was confirmed to have the coronavirus on April 3 and was warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases.</p>
<p>Three newly identified clusters, all at foreign worker dormitories - Westlite Woodlands dormitory, North Coast Lodge and Cassia @ Penjuru - were reported as well.</p>
<p>Most of the new cases announced on Saturday are, for now, unlinked to previously known cases or clusters. Contact tracing is underway for these 119 cases.</p>
<p>There are 52 cases linked to known clusters, while 20 are linked to other cases. No imported cases were reported.</p>
<p>Another 35 patients have also been discharged.</p>
<p>To date, a total of 528 cases have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.</p>
<p>Of the 943 confirmed cases who are still in hospital, most are stable or improving, while 31 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.</p>

<p>A total of 820 cases who are clinically well but still test positive for Covid-19 are isolated and cared for at community facilities.</p>
<p>As of 12pm on Saturday, MOH has identified 26,189 close contacts who have been quarantined.</p>
<p>Of these, 10,757 are currently quarantined and 15,432 have completed their quarantine.</p>
<p>Earlier on Saturday, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) issued an advisory to employers of foreign workers to ensure that the workers continue to receive their salaries during the circuit breaker period.</p>

<p>All employers with workers residing in dormitories are now required to pay salaries electronically, through Giro or direct bank transfer. They also have to make a declaration by April 15, 11.59pm that they will do so by the next salary payment due date.</p>
<p>The ministry said that 76 per cent of employers are already paying workers electronically, while the remaining 24 per cent are now required to shift to electronic payments.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, MOM said on Saturday that within 48 hours, the food distribution, cleanliness and hygiene standards were stabilised at two dormitories recently gazetted as isolation areas.</p>
<p>Sungei Tengah Lodge Dormitory and Tampines Dormitory were gazetted on Wednesday and Thursday respectively, days after three other dormitories were also declared as such, following an increase in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases among the workers there.</p>
<p>MOM said that the inter-agency task force it leads was able to quickly normalise operations and living conditions after gleaning experience from managing the first three dormitories.</p>
<p>It added that it would continue to reduce the number of workers in each dormitory in order to implement effective safe distancing measures within the dormitories.</p>
<p>Earlier on Saturday, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan said all commuters will soon be required to wear masks on public transport to curb the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Enterprise Singapore and the Singapore Tourism Board said that all customers visiting supermarkets, convenience stores, pharmacies and shopping malls must wear masks from Sunday, or they will be denied entry.</p>
<p>The Singapore Food Agency also said that all workers engaged in the sale and preparation of food and drinks will be required to wear masks or other forms of physical barriers from Monday.</p>
<p>On Friday, the National Environment Agency (NEA) said that from Sunday, those who do not wear a mask will be turned away at the 39 markets managed by the NEA or NEA-appointed operators.

<h3 id="coronavirus-9-in-10-singaporeans-to-receive-600-each-on-april-14">Coronavirus: 9 in 10 Singaporeans to receive $600 each on April 14</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/articles/2020/04/12/hzmarket0412_0.jpg?itok=Oikf4L-p" alt="img">
SINGAPORE - Nine in 10 Singaporeans will receive a one-off payout of $600 each on Tuesday (April 14), as part of measures by the Government to help families tide over the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The payout, which Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat announced last Monday and dubbed the Solidarity Payment, will be directly credited to bank accounts of all adult Singaporeans.</p>
<p>In February, the Government announced payouts of between $100 and $300 for every adult Singaporean. In March, this was tripled to between $300 and $900, with payouts due to be distributed from August to September.</p>
<p>Last Monday, Mr Heng, who is also Finance Minister, said $300 of that payment had been brought forward to April and supplemented with a further $300 to form the Solidarity Payment.</p>
<p>Those who qualify for the higher tiers will receive a further $300 or $600 in June.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) said the Government had received bank account details of about 90 per cent of the recipients who previously received payouts, including the SG Bonus in 2018.</p>
<p>The MOF requested the remaining 10 per cent of adult Singaporeans to provide their bank account details via the secure Gov.sg form - <a href="https://go.gov.sg/spsc">https://go.gov.sg/spsc</a> - before April 23.</p>
<p>Recipients who fill in their bank account details before April 23 can expect to receive the payout to their bank accounts on April 28.</p>
<p>SingPass access is required for the form.</p>
<p>By providing their bank account details, recipients can receive their payment quickly and safely without having to leave their homes while circuit breaker measures are in place, the MOF said.</p>
<p>Adult Singaporeans who have not provided bank account details by April 23 will receive their payout through cheques sent to their NRIC-registered addresses in stages from April 30 onwards.</p>
<p>The Government will also provide a one-off payout of $300 to permanent residents aged 21 and above in 2020 who have a Singaporean spouse, children or parents.</p>
<p>Long-Term Visit Pass-Plus holders aged 21 and above, who are foreign spouses of Singaporeans, can receive the payout as well.</p>
<p>Eligible permanent residents may sign up for the one-off payout at <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sppr">https://go.gov.sg/sppr</a> using their SingPass from now until May 10.</p>
<p>Those who provide their bank account details while signing up can expect to receive the payout directly to their bank accounts on May 19.</p>
<p>Related Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself</p>
<p>Those who do not provide their bank account details when signing up will receive cheques in stages from the end of May.</p>
<p>Long-Term Visit Pass-Plus holders who are eligible will receive their payout through cheques in stages from the end of May, and no application is needed, the MOF said.
