The Hollywood rumour mill is going into overdrive with the news that Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt have possibly welcomed twins via surrogate. Getty</p>
<p>Now an insider tells New Idea the babies could in fact be Jen and Brad’s. It’s believed the duo, who have always longed to start a family together, have never been fussed about how many children they would share, but Jen has always loved the idea of having a daughter.</p>
<p>“It’s being kept totally under the radar,” reveals the source.</p>
<p>“Jen and Brad have stopped short of confirming any baby news because it’s so sensitive and private. The unspoken message is that they’ll tell people when they’re ready, and that’s being respected among their close friends and confidants.”</p>
<p>Jennifer recently hinted about choosing an alternative route to motherhood.</p>
<p>In an interview earlier this year she revealed: “It’s not so much what I see myself doing. But it’s more like a little screen shot in my brain, where I hear the ocean, I see the ocean, I hear laughter, I see kids running, I hear ice in a glass, I smell food being cooked.”</p>
<p>It’s thought Jennifer’s good friends Jimmy Fallon and wife Nancy Juvonen inspired her to go down this route after having their two daughters via surrogacy.</p>
<p>Having previously acted as a carrier for Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick, Michelle would be a natural choice for the similarly high-profile Jennifer and Brad.</p>
<p>Rumour has it, Brad and Jen did a ton of research before electing to take the surrogacy route, even before they divorced. Getty</p>
<p>“Brad and Jen did a ton of research before electing to take the surrogacy route, even before they divorced,” reveals the insider.</p>
<p>“They saw how it worked wonders for so many of their friends. The likes of Jen’s close friends Elizabeth Banks and Nicole Kidman, plus Sarah Jessica of course, but also non-famous acquaintances have all told them it’s a beautiful and painless process that can be carried out with the utmost discretion and very little fuss.”</p>
<p>And despite the current situation, Brad and Jen are reportedly ready for the challenge. “Brad and Jen have a wonderful team of support staff, plus they’re more than capable of jumping in when the time comes and being hands-on parents,” says the insider.</p>
<p>“Brad for one can’t wait for more diaper duty, and Jen has been reassured she’ll be a natural so there’s no need to worry or panic.</p>
<p>“This will be the most beautiful time in their lives, something they’ve both dreamed about for literally decades, and now it’s happening they’re beyond ecstatic.”</p>
<p>It’s thought Jennifer’s good friends Jimmy Fallon and wife Nancy Juvonen inspired her to go down this route after having their two daughters via surrogacy. Getty</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the arrival of Michelle’s twins wasn’t without complications.</p>
<p>The 37-year-old was rushed to MacDonald Women’s Hospital, University Hospitals of Cleveland, Ohio, the day before the birth with high blood pressure.</p>
<p>She told her Facebook followers: “Pre-eclampsia. But got bp down enough to buy a night of monitoring before making the call to stay here to be watched or get babes out”.</p>
<p>She gave birth the following day, just over two weeks before her due date.</p>
<p>Michelle has remained silent about who the intended parents could be. But as a result of the worldwide COVID-19 lockdown, she posted the biological mother was unable to be present, which was heartbreaking.</p>
<p>She wrote, “I am in tears over it. I just cannot even imagine how desperate I would feel. It is so much more than missing the birth &hellip; but to have absolutely no way to personally wrap your arms around or feel like you could protect your brand new babies. Ugh. I just cannot wrap my head around how hard it would be.”</p>

Friends legend Jennifer Aniston has made an incredible donation to a nurse suffering from coronavirus symptoms.</p>
<p>During a Skype&rsquo;d episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! this week, Jennifer and the host invited cardiovascular nurse Kimball Fairbanks onto the show for a three-way chat, where they revealed that a $10,000 gift certificate had her name on it.</p>
<p>This was so Kimball could arrange food deliveries during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi, honey, it&rsquo;s so good to meet you,&rdquo; beamed Jennifer. &ldquo;I just have to say, God bless you and all of you that are out there doing what you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know how to express my gratitude to everything that you guys are doing, putting your health at risk and all of that. You&rsquo;re just phenomenal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Take a look at how it all unfolded below.</p>
<p>Later in their conversation, Jimmy announced that all of Kimball&rsquo;s colleagues working on the same floor as her at the hospital would be given a gift certificate too.</p>
