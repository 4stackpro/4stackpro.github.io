Instagram model and YouTuber Savannah Montano has had a string of relationships over the years, each more public than the last. Always open about her relationships, Savannah has continuously vlogged about them, including on her YouTube, where she has just over 500,000 subscribers.</p>
<p>Savannah is currently dating MMA fighter Dillon Danis.</p>
<p>Since at least July 2019, Savannah has been linked to MMA fighter Dillon Danis. She first introduced her audience to Dillon in a YouTube video titled “NYC VLOG (MEET MY BOYFRIEND).” The fighter is known for being good friends and training partners with notable fighter Conor McGregor.</p>
<p>Source: Instagram</p>
<p>A member of Bellator’s roster, Dillon is currently undefeated with a 2-0 record, taking out both Max Humphrey and Kyle Walker in the first rounds. He’s been cited multiple times as a fighter to watch for in the ring. Not only is Dillon an up-and-coming fighter, but his relationship has already caused some public beef. Controversial YouTuber Jake Paul allegedly tried to get under Dillon’s skin in an effort to get him in the ring, claiming he had hooked up with Savannah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dillon, I know you&rsquo;re watching this,&rdquo; Jake said in a video with TMZ. &ldquo;Just remember you&rsquo;re still a b&mdash;h and I hooked up with your girlfriend. Savannah, how you doing? What&rsquo;s good?&rdquo; It’s been rumored that Jake offered Dillon $5 million to fight him, though Jake denied the claims. Dillon fired back at Jake over his comments about his girlfriend, posting a photo with Tana Mongeau. At the time, Tana and Jake had recently gotten “married” in an elaborate fake marriage.</p>

<h3 id="jake-paul-taunts-dillon-danis-with-scandalous-claim-that-he-hooked-up-with-his-girlfriend">&ldquo;Jake Paul Taunts Dillon Danis With Scandalous Claim That He Hooked Up With His Girlfriend&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.distractify.com/brand-img/hAe4P-74h/0x0/savannah1-1571936562729.jpg" alt="img">
Well, it looks like Jake Paul doesn&rsquo;t want to let his brother, Logan Paul , get all the fun and hype from a highly publicized fight. Pro MMA fighter Dillon Danis — who has two wins and is known for being best friends with Conor McGregor — has been taunting Jake Paul to fight him for quite some time, and now, Jake is returning the gibes.</p>
<p>Dillon says that Jake&rsquo;s team offered him $5 million for a fight, while Jake is saying it&rsquo;s a bogus claim. Now, Jake is alleging that he hooked up with Dillon&rsquo;s girlfriend, Savannah Montano.</p>
<p>The outrageous accusation is causing a stir online, leading many to wonder if this is true. Who is Dillon Danis&rsquo; girlfriend Savannah? We&rsquo;ve got the details of who she is, and if Jake&rsquo;s latest comments are enough to finally solidify this match.</p>
<p>Savannah introduced Dillon as her boyfriend in June of 2019, with a video on her channel. Since then, the couple has been inseparable, but it looks like Jake Paul might be trying to come between them.</p>
<p>She created an e-commerce site called Disruptive Youth in 2014, with money from her dad, who is the company&rsquo;s official CEO. Savannah&rsquo;s eponymous YouTube channel got popular after she posted videos with her now ex-boyfriend, Jessey Stevens. The two showcased their relationship in videos, but they ended things in September of 2018. Her channel has more than 500,000 subscribers.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old first got notoriety from Tumblr and Vine. Her Tumblr account was focused on fashion content. On the now-defunct video app, she had more than 400,000 followers, which allowed her to pursue a fashion career.</p>
<p>In addition to having a name that sounds way too similar to Hannah Montana (we had to!), Savannah works as an Instagram model, and she&rsquo;s often seen on Dillon&rsquo;s arm at events. The two have shared many NSFW photos and videos together, making them a steamy social media couple.</p>
<p>What Jake Paul said about Dillon Danis&rsquo; girlfriend.</p>
<p>Dillon has been wanting a fight with Jake Paul since 2018, when Jake said that he could easily beat the MMA fighter in a match. Jake said that Dillon had a weak punch, and that he&rsquo;d easily win. Dillon didn&rsquo;t take the criticism too well, and he&rsquo;s been asking for a fight ever since.</p>
<p>Dillon first made things awkward for Jake when he claimed that he would steal Tana Mongeau from the YouTuber after beating him in a fight. Jake and Tana got &ldquo;married&rdquo; on July 28, and Dillon posted a photo with Tana as proof that they&rsquo;ve hung out before. The low blows definitely didn&rsquo;t end there.</p>
<p>Source: Instagram</p>
<p>Jake began writing on Dillon&rsquo;s Instagram, asking him to talk to Savannah about the time when she and Jake hooked up. Dillon seemingly ignored the messages, but he went on to say that Jake&rsquo;s team offered him $5 million to sign a contract for a fight. He also denied that Savannah and Jake have ever been together.</p>
<p>While training in a boxing ring, Jake spoke to TMZ about whether or not he&rsquo;d ever offered Dillon money for a fight.&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s talking about,&rdquo; Jake said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dillon, I know you&rsquo;re watching this,&rdquo; Jake continued. &ldquo;Just remember you&rsquo;re still a b&mdash;h and I hooked up with your girlfriend. Savannah, how you doing? What&rsquo;s good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Source: Instagram</p>
<p>Jake&rsquo;s mean comments didn&rsquo;t end there. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not worth $5 million,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The only reason anyone knows who he is, is because he&rsquo;s used me and my brother&rsquo;s name to make a name for himself and he got punched in the face by Khabib [Nurmagomedov.] That&rsquo;s the peak of his career. He&rsquo;s Conor McGregor&rsquo;s best friend. That&rsquo;s all this guy&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The YouTuber went on to say that he&rsquo;d fight Dillon eventually, but he wasn&rsquo;t ready to pick a date yet because he&rsquo;s focusing on other career ventures. Dillon posted a video of Jake&rsquo;s TMZ interaction on his Instagram page, writing &ldquo;I can smell his p&mdash;y from here.&rdquo; Yikes.

<p>Jake fuelled their feud as he claimed he has &ldquo;hooked up&rdquo; with stunning Instagram model Savannah Montano.</p>
<p>Speaking to TMZ, the American, 22, said: &ldquo;Dillon, I know you&rsquo;re watching this and just remember you&rsquo;re still a b**** and I hooked up with your girlfriend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Savannah, what&rsquo;s good? How you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When asked if he had offered Danis £4million to fight, he said: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not worth $5million.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only reason anyone knows who he is, is because he&rsquo;s used me and my brother&rsquo;s name to make a name for himself and he got punched in the face by Khabib.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the peak of his career.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s Conor McGregor&rsquo;s best friend. That&rsquo;s all this guy&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul admitted a fight against Danis will take place in the future, but claimed now is not the right time.</p>

&lsquo;You Suck and I Hooked Up with Your Girlfriend&rsquo;</p>
<p>Play video content Exclusive TMZSports.com</p>
<p>Jake Paul is doubling down on his claim he hooked up with Bellator fighter Dillon Danis&rsquo; GF &hellip; and he tells TMZ Sports he WILL take their beef to the ring &hellip; just not yet.</p>
<p>So, a bit of a crash course here &ndash; 22-year-old Jake first called out Danis last year, saying he&rsquo;d beat his ass in a boxing match because his &ldquo;striking is super weak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 2 have traded insults ever since &hellip; and Jake recently went to IG to tell Danis to &ldquo;ask savannah about the time we hooked up,&rdquo; &hellip; referring to Savannah Montano, an Instagram model Danis has been dating for a while now.</p>
<p>Fast forward to Monday, when Danis told Ariel Helwani he was offered between $4 to $5 million to face off with Paul to finally settle their differences in the ring (while also calling BS on Paul&rsquo;s most recent jab).</p>
<p>We spoke with Jake at Wild Card boxing gym on Tuesday about the huge offer &hellip; and Paul said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s talking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, then Jake went IN on Danis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dillon, I know you&rsquo;re watching this &hellip; Just remember you&rsquo;re still a bitch and I hooked up with your girlfriend. Savannah, how you doing? What&rsquo;s good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake added &hellip; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not worth $5 million. The only reason anyone knows who he is, is because he&rsquo;s used me and my brother&rsquo;s name to make a name for himself and he got punched in the face by Khabib [Nurmagomedov after UFC 229]. That&rsquo;s the peak of his career.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s Conor McGregor&rsquo;s best friend. That&rsquo;s all this guy&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jake says he&rsquo;s not fighting Danis yet because it&rsquo;s not what the fans want right now &hellip; but when the time is right, he&rsquo;s fully prepared to take him on.
