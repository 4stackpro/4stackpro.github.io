<p>Sushant Singh Rajput, who committed suicide a few hours back, would have appeared in his upcoming movie &lsquo;Dil Bechara&rsquo;. The movie, which also marks castign director Mukesh Chhabra&rsquo;s debut as a director, was slated for May 8, 2020 release and according to reports, there were talks that the movie would release online.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dil Bechara&rsquo;, which was previously titled &lsquo;Kizie Aur Manny&rsquo; would be Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s last movie. The film is the Hindi adaptation of &lsquo;The Fault In Our Stars&rsquo;. The film had come to a stop after Mukesh Chhabra was accused under #MeToo. The director, however, came back on board and completed the movie with the case.</p>
<p>Apart from Sushant, &lsquo;Dil Bechara&rsquo; features Sanjana Sanghi and Saif Ali Khan in the lead roles. A.R. Rahman has given music to the movie, and Farah Khan shot for a climax song with Sushant in the film. They shot the song in Paris. &lsquo;Dil Bechara&rsquo;, too, is a song in the movie.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dil Bechara&rsquo;s release was postponed from November 29, 2019 to May 8, 2020. The movie, like most other movies, was facing the issue of whether to wait for its theatrical release or release it online.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s last release before his demise was &lsquo;Drive&rsquo; with Jacqueline Fernandez. The movie, however, was a Netflix film. His last theatrical release was &lsquo;Chhichhore&rsquo; opposite Shraddha Kapoor, Varun Sharma, Tahir Raj Bhasin and others. The Nitesh Tiwari directorial released on September 6, 2019.

<p><img src="https://img.manoramaonline.com/content/dam/mm/en/entertainment/entertainment-news/images/2020/6/15/sushant-soba-silk-smitha-suicide.jpg" alt="img">
The curse of suicide has haunted the showbiz since time immemorial with the likes of iconic actor-director Guru Dutt, South star Shoba, Silk Smitha, actor Jiah Khan and now Bollywood star Sushant Singh Rajput giving up on life in the Indian film industry known for being harsh and demanding of its stars.</p>
<p>Known for films like &ldquo;Kai Po Che!&quot;, &ldquo;MS Dhoni: The Untold Story&rdquo;, &ldquo;Chhichhore&rdquo;, Rajput was found hanging at his Bandra home, the police said on Sunday. He was 34.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: Shocking suicides: Actors who stunned us with their sudden exits</p>
<p>Rajput&rsquo;s last screen appearance was Nitesh Tiwari&rsquo;s 2019 film Chhichhore. And his last social media post, dedicated to his late mother who died in 2002 when he was a young teen, was on June 3, a foretelling perhaps on what to come.</p>
<p>Rajput&rsquo;s sudden death comes days after his former manager, 28-year-old Disha Salian, ended her life by jumping from a high rise building on June 9.</p>
<p>Guru Dutt, known for black-and-white classics like &ldquo;Kaagaz Ke Phool&rdquo;, &ldquo;Baazi&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Pyaasa&rdquo;, was found dead on October 10, 1964 in his bed in his rented apartment at Pedder Road in erstwhile Bombay. He was 39. The filmmaker, whose real name was Vasanth Kumar Shivashankar Padukone, was said to have been mixing alcohol and sleeping pills.</p>
<p>Dutt&rsquo;s death may have been suicide or just an accidental overdose. His son, Arun Dutt, considered the death to be an accident.</p>
<p>Guru Dutt</p>
<p>South star Mahalakshmi Menon, best known by her stagename Shoba committed suicide at the age of 17. She got herself a National Award for Best Actress for the film Pasi and on May 1, 1980, she was found to have killed herself in her house in Chennai, then Madras. The manner of Shoba’s death, however, still remains cloaked in mystery.</p>
<p>Four years after Shoba died, her mother Prema who was also an actress too killed herself. KG George&rsquo;s 1983 film Lekhayude Maranam – Oru Flashback is said to be loosely based on her life.</p>
<p>Actor Vijaylakshmi, who reached the iconic status of a sex symbol in Tamil cinema during her time, as Silk Smitha died at the age of 33 as the result of a suspected suicide in 1996. She appeared in over 200 films, including &ldquo;Vandichakkaram&rdquo;, &ldquo;Moondru Mugam&rdquo;, a most sought after actor at a time was said to be neck deep in controversies.</p>
<p>Silk Smitha</p>
<p>She was immortalised on screen in the 2011 film &ldquo;The Dirty Picture&rdquo;, starring Vidya Balan as Silk. The Milan Luthria-directed film, which showed the highs and lows of the dancing star, was inspired by the actor&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Former Miss India and video jockey Nafisa Joseph was found hanging at her residence in Versova in 2004 at the age of 25.</p>
<p>Joseph, who won the Miss India title in 1997, had worked as a model and had been involved in activities related to animal rights.</p>
<p>In 2006, model-turned television actor Kuljeet Randhawa, known for starring in high-school drama &ldquo;Hip Hip Hurray!&quot;, suspense serial &ldquo;Kohinoor&rdquo; and crime thriller drama &ldquo;Special Squad&rdquo;, allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself in her single room apartment in suburban Juhu. She was 25.</p>
<p>Kunal Singh, best known for starring opposite actor Sonali Bendre in the 1999 Tamil romance film &ldquo;Kadhalar Dhinam&rdquo;, was found hanging from the ceiling fan in his Mumbai apartment in 2008. He was 30.</p>
<p>Jiah Khan</p>
<p>British-American actor Jiah Khan, best known for films like &ldquo;Nishabd&rdquo; with megastar Amitabh Bachchan and &ldquo;Ghajini&rdquo; with Aamir Khan, was found hanging at her Mumbai residence on June 3, 2013 by her mother Rabiya Khan. Khan was 25.</p>
<p>It was deemed a suicide and reconfirmed as a suicide in 2016 following an extensive investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and a hearing at the Bombay High Court.</p>
<p>Khan&rsquo;s mother blamed her boyfriend, actor Sooraj Pancholi, for her death. He was charged with abetting Khan&rsquo;s suicide. The case has not yet been settled.</p>
<p>Last year, actor Kushal Punjabi, who appeared in films such as &ldquo;Kaal&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lakshya&rdquo; as well as the reality show &ldquo;Fear Factor&rdquo;, was found hanging in his Bandra apartment. He was 42.</p>
<p>Punjabi, whose body was found by his parents in the wee hours of December 27, left behind a suicide note in which he said nobody should be held responsible for his death.

<p>Updated: Jun 15, 2020 11:50 IST</p>
<p>Actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death should be investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Jan Adhikar Party chief Pappu Yadav demanded on Monday.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput, who dropped out of an engineering college to pursue a career in Bollywood and delivered several hit films over the past decade, was found dead in his apartment in Mumbai on Sunday. He was 34.</p>
<p>Dattatreya Bargude, an assistant commissioner of Mumbai Police, confirmed the actor’s death and said that no “note” was found at his residence.</p>
<p>“I cannot imagine how this happened. I request the government to launch a CBI inquiry. I think there is a deep conspiracy behind his death. Sushant cannot commit suicide,” Pappu Yadav told reporters.</p>
<p>“I want a CBI inquiry in the matter. Sushant was a workaholic and good man, not the kind of person that would commit suicide. He rose from the bottom. Made Bihar proud. Now the state of Bihar is in mourning,” he added.</p>
<p>Yadav also claimed that it could be a case of homicide.</p>
<p>Rajput was born in Bihar’s capital of Patna and was the youngest of five children of a government employee. He completed his schooling in Delhi before securing a seat in an engineering college in the Capital in 2003.</p>
<p>He dropped out of the course to pursue acting professionally three years later and joined the Barry John Acting School.</p>
<p>The actor landed his first role in the Hindi serial, Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil, in 2008 but gained popularity the next year with his character in the popular soap, Pavitra Rishta.</p>
<p>He debuted in Bollywood in 2013 with the movie Kai Po Che!, adapted from a novel by Chetan Bhagat but became a household name with the success of MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, a biopic on the World Cup-winning Indian cricket captain, in 2016.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput was last seen in Nitesh Tiwari’s Chhichhore in 2019 and also acted in the thriller Drive that was released on Netflix the same year.</p>

<h3 id="is-direct-to-ott-the-new-goldmine-for-medium-budget-films">&ldquo;Is Direct-to-OTT the new goldmine for medium-budget films?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.outlookindia.com/public/uploads/outlook-banner-img.gif" alt="img">
Is Direct-to-OTT the new goldmine for medium-budget films?</p>
<p>New Delhi, June 15 (IANS) The Amitabh Bachchan-Ayushmann Khurrana starrer &ldquo;Gulabo Sitabo&rdquo; shows that the direct-to-digital-release way can profitably work for Bollywood films made at a restrained budget, at a time the industry is reeling under the after-effects of shutdown owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, big ticket Bollywood entertainers are still maintaining distance from OTT release, and would prefer to wait for cinema halls to reopen.</p>
<p>Lined up for OTT premieres after &ldquo;Gulabo Sitabo&rdquo;, over the next several movies are small to medium budget films such as the Vidya Balan-starrer &ldquo;Shakuntala Devi&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Other films whose names are doing the rounds are the Alia Bhatt-starrer &ldquo;Sadak 2&rdquo;, Ajay Devgn'&lsquo;s &ldquo;Bhuj: The Pride Of India&rdquo;, Anurag Basu'&lsquo;s &ldquo;Ludo&rdquo;, &ldquo;Khaali Peeli&rdquo; starring Ishaan Khatter and Ananya Panday, &ldquo;Shershaah&rdquo; starring Sidharth Malhotra, the Abhishek Bachchan-starrer &ldquo;The Big Bull&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mimi&rdquo; starring Kriti Sanon, the Kunal Kemmu-starrer &ldquo;Lootcase&rdquo;, the Kiara Advani-starrer &ldquo;Indoo Ki Jawaani&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Roohi Afzana&rdquo; featuring Janhvi Kapoor.</p>
<p>The late actor Sushant Singh Rajput'&lsquo;s upcoming film &ldquo;Dil Bechara&rdquo; was also being considered for a direct to OTT release, according to reports.</p>
<p>Unconfirmed reports have also indicated that the Akshay Kumar-starrer &ldquo;Laxmmi Bomb&rdquo; is in line for a direct-to-OTT release, although nothing is confirmed. Rumours suggest the makers of the film are asking for a steep price of well over Rs 100 crore to sell the right for direct OTT premiere, owing to the presence of superstar Akshay.</p>
<p>In fact, streaming platform Amazon Prime Video, in a bid to revolutionise the way we might watch films in the future, recently confirmed films across five Indian languages for digital release.</p>
<p>Their direct-to-home menu features the recently-released Tamil legal drama &ldquo;Ponmagal Vandhal&rdquo; starring Jyotika, the Keerthy Suresh starrer &ldquo;Penguin&rdquo; (Tamil and Telugu), &ldquo;Sufiyum Sujatayum&rdquo; (Malayalam) starring Aditi Rao Hydari, &ldquo;Law&rdquo; (Kannada) starring Ragini Chandran and Siri Prahlad, and Danish Sait'&lsquo;s next film &ldquo;French Biryani&rdquo; (Kannada).</p>
<p>A small and moderate budget is the string that connects the films switching to OTT route as cinemas remain shut amid the virus crisis.</p>
<p>One report claimed that the OTT platform bought the premiere rights of &ldquo;Gulabo Sitabo&rdquo; for Rs 60-65 crore, which means that the makers made profit of around Rs 30-35 crore with the film, said to be made on an approximate budget of Rs 30 crore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The value or the impact will not get lost because it was released on a digital platform instead of theatre.. Yes, I started the film with an aim to release on a cinema platform, but the situation is like this that I had to experiment with the digital platform.. At some point I had to experiment with digital and I was looking for it. Every film has its own destiny and the destiny of &lsquo;&lsquo;Gulabo Sitabo&rsquo;&rsquo; was a digital premiere at Amazon Prime Video,&rdquo; director Shoojit Sircar told IANS.</p>
<p>Digital world, however, does not seem to be enticing the biggies. Makers of much-anticipated films such as &ldquo;83&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sooryanvanshi&rdquo; have assured cinema owners that they will release their films in theatres first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That'&lsquo;s because they get good revenue from theatres,&rdquo; Raj Kumar Mehrotra, general manager at Delhi'&lsquo;s Delite Cinema, told IANS.</p>
<p>To this, trade analyst Girish Johar added: &ldquo;The films that are coming on OTT are somewhat premium content. These are not big tentpole releases. Hollywood is following the same thing. Marvel Studios has pushed all the tentpole movies to 2021. OTT can'&lsquo;t be a revenue platform for buying Rs 200 crore film. In the case of OTT platforms, it is the time when they can get maximum subscribers as everyone is at home, that'&lsquo;s why they are buying new films. Cinemas need not fear as there would be jump once everything is normal, and the window will be respected by the makers as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once lockdown is over and safety precautions in place, theatrical revenue will jump by more than 20 per cent because there is a lot of pent up demand,&rdquo; Girish added.</p>

<p>Highlights &ldquo;She&rsquo;s watching and proud, my man,&rdquo; wrote Arjun Kapoor</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you understand,&rdquo; replied Sushant Singh Rajput</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I understood what made him make this choice,&rdquo; wrote Arjun</p>
<p>Actor Arjun Kapoor has shared a poignant exchange of messages with Sushant Singh Rajput - their last, dating from December 2018 - which was prompted by a series of posts Mr Rajput had shared about his mother, who died in 2002. Arjun Kapoor, who lost his own mother in 2012, shared a screenshot of a conversation in which he encourages Sushant Singh Rajput to &ldquo;Hang in there, one day at a time.&rdquo; The messages were exchanged just after the release of Mr Rajput&rsquo;s film Kedarnath; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s watching and proud, my man,&rdquo; Arjun Kapoor texted Sushant Singh Rajput. &ldquo;I know you understand,&rdquo; he replied to one of the messages.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at home in Mumbai on Sunday; police say he died by suicide.</p>
<p>In his post, Arjun Kapoor writes, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I understood what made him make this choice. I can say I felt the pain he did about losing his bearings and feeling that void of his mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Read Arjun Kapoor&rsquo;s post here:</p>
<p>The text conversation was likely prompted by these tweets that Sushant Singh Rajput shared after the release of Kedarnath in 2018:</p>
<p>The lines that crept on your eyes when you pressed them hard to pray for me,</p>
<p>those lines,</p>
<p>my mother,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve borrowed to help my God into immortality&hellip; #mymother#selfmusing#thevainglorious responsible for however I&rsquo;m looking pic.twitter.com/4uuP2qrKFI — Sushant Singh Rajput (@itsSSR) December 13, 2018</p>
<p>His late mother was often on the actor&rsquo;s mind - Mr Rajput&rsquo;s last post on Instagram was dedicated to her:</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput had a very busy 2019 with three films releasing - Sonchiriya, Chhichhore and the Netflix offering Drive. Yet, it also appears to have been something of a lonely year for the actor; in a post on Instagram, his Drive producer Karan Johar lamented not having been in touch with Mr Rajput for the past year. &ldquo;I blame myself,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s breakout role was the TV soap Pavitra Rishta, after which he made his film debut in 2013&rsquo;s Kai Po Che! His work also includes the MS Dhoni biopic, in which he played the lead, and a well-received supporting role in Aamir Khan&rsquo;s PK.
