Virus Outbreak: MOE tells schools to heed four rules</p>
<p>Staff writer, with CNA</p>
<p>As universities and colleges are to begin their new semesters tomorrow, the Ministry of Education (MOE) has ordered schools to follow four key preventive measures against COVID-19.</p>
<p>In a notification sent to schools on Wednesday, the ministry said that students’ temperatures should be checked, campuses disinfected and ventilation improved, while response to confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases must be quick.</p>
<p>Unlike primary and secondary schools, college campuses are open to more students with varying class schedules, posing a great challenge to temperature monitoring, it said, advising schools to limit the number of entrances to campuses, dormitories and restaurants, and arrange personnel to work shifts monitoring temperatures at certain checkpoints.</p>
<p>Two National Taiwan University of Science and Technology students on Thursday eat while separated by transparent dividers. The school has designated dining hall tables no-speaking zones as part of its disease prevention measures. Photo provided by the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology</p>
<p>People should be asked to return home or visit a doctor when they develop a fever — 38°C when taken from the ear or 37.5°C when taken from the forehead — or when they have respiratory symptoms, the ministry said.</p>
<p>Students who are boarding and have unusual temperatures should stay in single rooms, and their school should report their condition, it added.</p>
<p>Given the nation’s diverse campus settings, universities have adopted different temperature measurement policies.</p>
<p>For example, National Taiwan University would be testing visitors’ temperatures at the entrances of each building or department, given that its campus is extensive; Soochow University plans to have four checkpoints for measuring temperatures; and Fu Jen Catholic University would be marking healthy people with a stamp on the back of their hands.</p>
<p>The ministry has also advised schools to disinfect frequently used items, such as doorknobs, buttons, electrical appliance switches, and classroom desks and chairs, in the morning and afternoon each day.</p>
<p>Schools should also avoid using air-conditioners, improve ventilation and keep indoor carbon dioxide concentration levels — a barometer for ventilation — to less than 1,000 parts per million, it said.</p>
<p>If faculty find confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases, they should report to their schools’ security and health agencies as soon as possible and help with the disease investigation, it added.</p>
<p>The ministry also asked schools to prepare dormitory space for quarantine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, nine universities with affiliated medical centers have been appointed as regional centers for disease control and consultation, the ministry said.</p>
<p>The nine schools are Fu Jen, Taipei Medical University, Chang Gung University and National Yang-Ming University in the north; Asia University and China Medical University in central Taiwan; National Cheng Kung University and Kaohsiung Medical University in the south; and Tzu Chi University in the east, it said.

<h3 id="moe-additional-precautionary-measures-for-preschool-and-primary-schools-amid-rise-in-covid-19-cases">MOE: Additional precautionary measures for preschool and primary schools amid rise in Covid-19 cases</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.asiaone.com/sites/default/files/styles/a1_600x316/public/original_images/Mar2020/270320_sparkletots_st.jpg?h=40982545&amp;itok=MGY82KSN" alt="img">
The Ministry of Education (MOE) and Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) on Tuesday (24 March) has issued an advisory on two additional precautionary measures for preschool and primary school students in light of the recent spike in imported cases of Covid-19 in the republic.</p>
<p>Two additional precautionary measures</p>
<p>Students staying in the same household as a person who has returned to Singapore from any country from Wednesday, March 25, 2020, 11.59pm, will be placed on 14-day Leave of Absence (LOA).</p>
<p>Students staying in the same household as a person who had returned to Singapore from the UK, US or ASEAN countries on or after March 14, 2020, will be placed on LOA. The student&rsquo;s LOA will start from the day the person in the household returned to Singapore.</p>
<p>These measures are in addition to the earlier announced 14-day LOA issued to students and staff of schools, preschools and student care centres if they returned from overseas on or after March 14.</p>
<p>Employers are encouraged to provide flexible work arrangements for their employees to accommodate such exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p>The MOE and MSF said they will continue to monitor the situation closely and work with schools, preschools, student care centres, parents and the community to ensure that our schools, preschools and student care centres remain safe.</p>
<p>We also urge all other students and staff who are staying with persons on LOA or Stay-Home Notice to monitor their health, see a doctor if they are sick and return to school only when fully recovered.</p>
<p>Stricter measures as more new imported cases are reported</p>
<p>In a statement on Tuesday evening, the multi-ministry taskforce announced tighter measures to fight against the further spread of the coronavirus here.</p>
<p>In announcing its strictest measures to date, the multi-ministry taskforce said all centre-based tuition and enrichment classes will be suspended to reduce the intermingling of students from different schools and enhance the safety of students.</p>
<p>Gatherings outside school and work will also be limited to a maximum of 10 people from Thursday (March 26) at 11.59 pm to April 30, 2020.</p>
<p>The duration of the stricter measures may also be extended if the situation does not improve here, the task force added.</p>
