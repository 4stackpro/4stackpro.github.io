ASTRO’s Cha Eun Woo may be starring in a new drama!</p>
<p>On April 23, news outlet Ilgan Sports reported that Cha Eun Woo has been cast as the male lead of a drama based on the popular webtoon “True Beauty.”</p>
<p>In response to the reports, Cha Eun Woo’s agency Fantagio commented, “Cha Eun Woo has received an offer to star in the drama ‘True Beauty,’ and he is currently reviewing the offer.”</p>
<p>“True Beauty” is a story of a young woman who doesn’t want to be caught without makeup on, and she experiences a heart-fluttering love story with a man who is the only one who knows what her bare face looks like. Even before the drama was confirmed, virtual casting was a hot topic due to the webtoon’s popularity, and Cha Eun Woo was the top pick among netizens.</p>
<p>Cha Eun Woo was offered the role of the handsome Lee Su Ho. He is a perfect man who is the top student at school. Although he steals the spotlight wherever he goes, he is not interested in anyone and is not amused by girls lining up to confess to him. Contrary to his stoic character, Lee Su Ho turns red when he’s embarrassed, and when he’s flustered, he blurts out whatever is on his mind and sometimes goes off the deep end. However, he is actually a kind-hearted guy who always regrets shooting off his hot temper.</p>
<p>Bon Factory will be in charge of production, and writer Lee Si Eun of the “Rude Miss Young Ae” series will write the script. Casting is currently underway with the aim of broadcasting in the second half of this year.</p>
<p>If Cha Eun Woo decides to accept the role, this will be his third drama as the male lead after “My ID is Gangnam Beauty” and “Rookie Historian Goo Hae Ryung.”</p>
