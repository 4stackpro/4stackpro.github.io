<h3 id="shell-game">&ldquo;Shell Game&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png" alt="img">
We’re playing MONOPOLY, if you hadn’t already guessed. The board game, which has been sold since 1935, has seen many weird incarnations, including one about bass fishing and another for Sun-Maid, for those of us who would like to corner the market on that sweet, sweet raisin money.</p>
<p>The first word in each of the five theme phrases is a rather well-known token in the game. I always wanted to be the DOG, but then my first child grew old enough to play and they always wanted to be the DOG, so I relinquished it in favor of the IRON. The IRON had its benefits: It stayed upright on the board no matter how often our dog tried to walk on it.</p>
<p>Anyway, while there was not a lot that was new here, it was an enjoyable puzzle with a few entries that might be considered difficult for a Monday. Ms. Iverson said in her notes below that HORSE SENSE, a common phrase, was traded for the lesser known THIMBLERIG, another name for the shell game. On the surface, that may appear to be a curious editing decision, but the THIMBLE is definitely better known as a MONOPOLY game token than the HORSE and rider. What would your decision have been if you were the editor? Sacrifice the better known phrase, even if the piece it was referring to was lesser known, or use the lesser known phrase and take a chance that Monday solvers may not know it but recognize the game token? It’s hard to say what I would have done</p>
<p>Constructor Notes</p>
<p>This was the first accepted puzzle that I made without direct input from a mentor. The original theme set had HORSE SENSE instead of THIMBLERIG. Will and the team liked the theme, but asked me to get rid of HORSE SENSE, since the token is really the “horse and rider,” and is less iconic than the other tokens in the puzzle. I felt a little worried that I wouldn’t be able to come up with a clean grid with their suggested replacement “THIMBLERIG,” since it seemed like a fluke that I pulled off a grid with six theme entries as it was. I did end up having to rework the entire grid, and looking back almost a year after finishing it, I wish I could get rid of some of the crossword-y fill like EEO and DIALER. Thanks to the editing team for working with me on this one, with multiple drafts (including an embarrassing submission with the typo BOOTMAMP in the grid). A lot of my clues were changed (for the better), but I was glad to see AMY Klobuchar still represented, and my clue for RINGO Starr unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tipping Point</p>
<p>Almost finished solving but need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered.</p>
<p>Warning: There be spoilers ahead, but subscribers can take a peek at the answer key.</p>
