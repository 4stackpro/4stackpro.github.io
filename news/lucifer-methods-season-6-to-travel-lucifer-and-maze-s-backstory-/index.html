<p>LUCIFER observers are looking ahead to the Season 6 of the program, which is due to come out at any point this year on Netflix. Still, supporters are eager to understand how season six will fall into the backstories of the devil, and Maze if the show were to be awarded another set of episodes.</p>
<p>Lucifer has been dropped in a severe situation. After being made to go behind to Hell, Netflix watchers are not certain how he will get his move back to Earth. Despite here, observers have noticed various rumors regarding a sixth season, which will probably continue his story.</p>
<p>Lucifer and Maze’s backstory in Season 6</p>
<p>Presently, with a sixth season on the tags, viewers have been tough at work in thinking about how it will be utilized.</p>
<p>It has been commonly believed that season five will involve Lucifer trying to get back from Hell.</p>
<p>Season six is, as of now, unknown territory, and supporters of the series are not certain exactly what is going to be discussed during the assumed conclusion.</p>
<p>Soon, many viewers have been thinking the sixth season could involve the backstories of Lucifer and Mazikeen otherwise known as Maze.</p>
<p>Reddit user Borkphlosions freshly proposed that recall if they do make a season 6 it should be something totally strange.</p>
<p>Season five as a finish and it would be hard to break the story presently and record new scenes and have it previously without delaying the season 5 release.</p>
<p>May get a severe negative impact on the story if they become familiar to the end and there’s this ideal ending in sight suddenly all of an unexpected the tone shifts and everything is changed simply to extend the film another season.</p>
<p>Walking on to talk about season six direct, the supporter replied: “I would plan to have season six as a kind of spin off season where we observe into Lucifer and Maze’s happenings.

<h3 id="lucifer-plot-hole-fans-spot-major-error-with-charlie-and-the-celestial-beings">Lucifer plot hole: Fans spot major error with Charlie and the Celestial beings</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/20/750x445/1263728.jpg" alt="img">
When the fourth season wrapped up, Lucifer (played by Tom Ellis) had apparently embraced the sinister prophecy from Father Kinley (Graham McTavish). Kissing his love interest and LAPD partner Chloe (Lauren German), he fulfilled his destiny and reclaimed his throne in the underworld. Meanwhile, the ninth episode of the fourth season, Save Lucifer, took the twists a step further when Lucifer’s older brother, Amenadiel (D. B. Woodside) had a baby with former lover, the human Linda Martin (Rachael Harris). Named Charlie, the newborn half-angel, half-human baby was quickly kidnapped by Dromos (possessing the body of Father Kinley) to try and make him the new King of Hell.

<p>READ MORE Lucifer season 5 theories: Why Lucifer suppresses his power While the introduction of baby Charlie was a huge surprise for fans of the show, his birth was even more shocking for father Amenadiel, as it was previously thought angels were unable to impregnate humans. Some fans have taken online to voice their confusion about the cryptic rules for relationships between humans and celestial beings. One Redditor posted: “So, how is Charlie a celestial baby? When Amenadiel got Linda pregnant, Lucifer stated the only possible way for him to get Linda pregnant would be if Amenadiel had become 100 percent human because celestial beings CAN NOT get humans pregnant.” Although Amenadiel didn’t have complete control over his angelic abilities on Earth, he still has the DNA of his heavenly brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>While Charlie is just a baby and hasn’t exhibited any supernatural abilities yet, fans were unsure if he actually qualified as a potential heir to the throne of hell when he was kidnapped by Dromos and his demons. They continued: “Charlie should NOT be a celestial, and I personally do not like the fact that the later parts of season 4 and most likely some parts of season 5 will rely on him being half Angel half Human.” As the first of his kind, Charlie is able to freely traverse between the plains of Heaven and Earth without killing him, as it would a normal human. When he grows older, it’s likely he’ll start growing wings and developing similar powers to Lucifer and Amenadiel. DON&rsquo;T MISS:</p>

<p>Although Charlie’s introduction shatters the pre-established rules of the series somewhat, other fans have provided convincing arguments as to why his presence shouldn’t be a problem. Reddit user h2p012 replied: “Lucifer isn&rsquo;t talking from a place of authority when he mentions Amenadiel becoming more human than they realized. He is just sort of making a slightly educated guess.” While Lucifer is an ancient and powerful being, his lengthy time on Earth has made him slightly out of touch, and isn’t exactly an expert when it comes to human-angel relationships. Moreover, the fan added: “So far Charlie hasn&rsquo;t actually shown any signs of celestial ability.</p>
