Brett Favre became a teammate of Jackson&rsquo;s in August 2009 when he signed with Minnesota. Jackson had been competing for the starting job with Sage Rosenfels and John David Booty when the three-time NFL MVP became a Viking. Favre described how great a teammate Jackson was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My time with the Vikings was very special because the team embraced and welcomed me as one of their own,&rdquo; Favre said. &ldquo;Tarvaris could have been anything but welcoming, but [instead he] was pure class and as good a teammate as any I&rsquo;ve played with. [I&rsquo;m] proud to call him friend!! Such sad news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackson went 10-10 in his starts with the Vikings, and went 7-7 in 14 starts for Seattle in 2011.</p>
<p>He appeared in three games with Seattle in 2013, serving as the backup quarterback as the Seahawks won Super Bowl XLVIII in February of 2014.</p>
<p>Jackson completed 640 of 1,073 passes (59.6 percent) in his NFL career, passing for 7,263 yards with 39 touchdowns and 25 interceptions. He also tallied six career rushing touchdowns, three of which came in 2007.</p>
<p>Former Vikings Head Coach Brad Childress, who coached Jackson from 2006-10, praised Jackson&rsquo;s selfless attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[He was a] great young man and great competitor,&rdquo; Childress said, &ldquo;but an even better teammate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Browns Head Coach Kevin Stefanski, who was an assistant to Childress from 2006-08 before becoming the Vikings assistant quarterbacks coach (2009-13), said he was &ldquo;extremely saddened&rdquo; to learn of Jackson&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sincere condolences go out to his family,&rdquo; Stefanski said. &ldquo;I was fortunate to be a young coach as Tarvaris started out his career, and I was able to see him grow as a person and as a player. He was universally well-liked by his teammates. He will be missed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackson began his college career at Arkansas but transferred to Alabama State.. He threw for 7,201 yards and 63 touchdowns in three seasons as the Hornets starter, rushing for 11 scores in that time.</p>
<p>Jackson was the quarterbacks coach for Tennessee State at the time of his passing. He has previously spent time at his alma mater as the quality control/quarterbacks coach.</p>
<p>Tennessee State Director of Athletics Teresa Phillips and Head Coach Rod Reed also issued statements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My heart is so heavy with hurt hearing of the passing of Coach Jackson,&rdquo; Phillips said. &ldquo;We were blessed with him for a short time, but he did make an impact with our young men in this one season at TSU. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his young family and all who knew and loved him. We lift up all who are mourning today. Each loss is piercing. Today I ask God&rsquo;s comfort to spread through the TSU community, the nation and the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed added: &ldquo;Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Jackson family in this time of bereavement. We are devastated. He was an awesome young man and he will be missed by our players, our staff and the TSU family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackson leaves behind his wife, Lakitta, and three children.

<p>Former Minnesota Vikings quarterback Tarvaris Jackson died in a car crash in Alabama Sunday night, according to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency.</p>
<p>The 36-year-old was currently with Tennessee State University as the Tigers&rsquo; quarterbacks coach.</p>
<p>“My heart is so heavy with hurt hearing of the passing of Coach Jackson,” said TSU Director of Athletics Teresa Phillips. “We were blessed with him for a short time but he did make an impact with our young men in this one season at TSU. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his young family and all who knew and loved him. We lift up all who are mourning today. Each loss is piercing. Today I ask God’s comfort to spread through the TSU community, the nation and the world.”</p>
<p>“Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Jackson family in this time of bereavement,” said TSU Head Coach Rod Reed. “We are devastated. He was an awesome young man and he will be missed by our players, our staff and the TSU family.”</p>
<p>Jackson spent the first five seasons of his NFL career with the Vikings, mostly as a backup quarterback. He later played for the Buffalo Bills and Seattle Seahawks. He made 12 starts in his second season with the Vikings in 2007, throwing for more than 1,900 yards, nine touchdowns and 12 interceptions while going 8-4.</p>
<p>Jackson made one playoff start with the Vikings, in the 2008 NFC Wild Card Playoffs against the Philadelphia Eagles. He finished that game 15-of-35 for 164 yards and one interception, a game the Vikings lost.</p>

<p>The Vikings released a statement on Jackson&rsquo;s death on Monday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The entire Vikings family is saddened by the news of Tarvaris Jackson being taken from us too soon. One of Tarvaris&rsquo; greatest attributes was his positive outlook and approach. He genuinely cared about others, was a good friend and will be missed by family, teammates and Vikings fans everywhere. We send our deepest condolences to his family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackson later went onto win a Super Bowl as the No. 2 quarterback with the Seattle Seahawks in 2014.</p>
<p>Several players, present and former, reacted to Jackson&rsquo;s death on Twitter Monday morning. They include former Vikings Ben Leber, Chad Greenway and Greg Coleman, and current Seahawks&rsquo; quarterback Russell Wilson.</p>
<p>According to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, authorities responded to a single-vehicle crash at about 8:50 p.m. Sunday.</p>
<p>Jackson was driving a 2012 Chevy Camaro when it left the roadway, struck a tree and then overturned. He was taken to a local hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. The crash happened about seven miles south of Montgomery, where Jackson is from.

Multiple sources are reporting that former Minnesota Vikings QB Tarvaris Jackson is dead following a car crash in Alabama Sunday night.</p>
<p>Jackson was just 36 years old.</p>
<p>State Trooper Benjamin “Michael” Carswell said in a news release that a 2012 Chevrolet Camaro that Jackson was driving went off the road, struck a tree and overturned at 8:50 p.m.</p>
<p>Jackson was pronounced dead at a local hospital.</p>
<p>The wreck occurred on Pike Road, about seven miles south of Montgomery, his hometown. No other details were immediately released about the crash, which remains under investigation.</p>
<p>Jackson was a high round draft choice by the Vikings in 2006, projected to be a star by then-coach Brad Childress, but things never really panned out. He started just 20 games in his five seasons with the Vikings.</p>
<p>After being released by the Purple he landed with the Seattle Seahawks for two stints, winning a Super Bowl title as backup to Russell Wilson in 2014.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The entire Vikings family is saddened by the news of Tarvaris Jackson being taken from us too soon,&rdquo; reads a statement released Monday by the Minnesota Vikings. &ldquo;One of Tarvaris&rsquo; greatest attributes was his positive outlook and approach. He genuinely cared about others, was a good friend and will be missed by family, teammates and Vikings fans everywhere. We send our deepest condolences to his family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackson completed 640 of 1,073 passes (59.6 percent) in his NFL career, passing for 7,263 yards with 39 touchdowns and 25 interceptions. He also tallied six career rushing touchdowns, three of which came in 2007.</p>
<p>Former Vikings Head Coach Brad Childress, who coached Jackson from 2006-10, praised Jackson&rsquo;s selfless attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;[He was a] great young man and great competitor,&rdquo; Childress said, &ldquo;but an even better teammate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After leaving the NFL Jackson struggled with financial and legal problems before landing on his feet as quarterbacks coach at Tennessee State University.</p>
<p>Tarvaris Jackson leaves behind his wife Lakitta Jackson, and three children – Tarvaris, Takayla and Tyson. Reaction from former teammates, coaches and opponents was swift and heartfelt. &ldquo;Tarvaris Jackson was a beloved teammate, competitor, and Seahawk,&rdquo; posted his former head coach Pete Carroll. &ldquo;He will be deeply missed.&rdquo;</p>
