If you keep wondering what to think about Michael Jackson’s complicated legacy – is it OK to play Billie Jean at a party? Do you have to switch radio stations if Smooth Criminal comes on? – imagine how Jacques Peretti feels. He has made three films about the pop icon in the past 15 years and in this, his fourth, he aimed to build the fullest picture yet. But how many of us are brave enough to confront that picture?</p>
<p>The Real Michael Jackson (BBC Two) comes just over a year after the broadcast of HBO/Channel 4’s Leaving Neverland, a gruelling, four-hour documentary built around the detailed accounts of two men, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who say they were sexually abused by Jackson as children. Peretti’s film was initially billed as a rival Jackson film, but in the event, it’s much more like an unofficial sequel; a film that could not exist if Leaving Neverland hadn’t cleared the media’s hagiographic haze, but which also provides necessary context on the huge fallout from Jackson’s 2009 death.</p>
<p>The Real Michael Jackson has much more in common with Louis Theroux’s 2016 Savile film, in which the newly sombre documentarian confronted his own journalistic failures and berated himself for not doing more to tackle a high-profile abuser who got away with it for so long. Didn’t Jackson also “hide in plain sight”? Peretti makes a compelling case that the pop star deliberately cultivated that “wacko Jacko” persona of the late 80s – Bubbles the chimp, the oxygen chamber, the Elephant Man bones – to provide cover for a truth that was much darker.</p>
<p>Savile’s crimes were not on the same global scale. Peretti details the “Jackson machine”, that small army of private investigators, expensive lawyers and fixers, which swung into gear during his trials, or whenever his reputation was threatened. It is an MO reminiscent of Harvey Weinstein or Jeffrey Epstein. Yet none of these other men had anything like Jackson’s huge international fanbase, which, until uncomfortably recently, included Peretti himself.</p>
<p>“Is he a paedophile? That’s the question that should be asked,” Peretti says ruefully as he (and we) rewatch footage of a younger Peretti interviewing Jackson’s longtime manager Bob Jones (who testified against Jackson in 2005) for one of his earlier films. “And I don’t ask the question. That is a failure … that is a regret of mine.”</p>
<p>In fairness, he is far from the only Jackson-adjacent journalist with regrets for not doing more to quiz Jackson on the rumours. Jackson’s habit of occasionally emerging from his post-Thriller seclusion to attend an awards ceremony arm-in-arm with a 12-year-old, or grant exclusive access to a chosen interviewer, means there is a wealth of footage to scrutinise. Diane Sawyer in 1995 and Martin Bashir in 2003 made the most headlines – even asking him about the allegations – yet it’s the softballs, including Oprah Winfrey’s live 1993 interview at the Neverland ranch, which are retrospectively most creepy (although, to be fair, she did at least ask him about his sexuality). In Peretti’s selected clip, Oprah approvingly notes one of several bedrooms on the property made up for young guests: “You have to be a person who really cares about children to build that into your architecture,” she says.</p>
<p>Could anyone watch all this, especially after Leaving Neverland, and not have profound doubts about the professed innocence of Jackson’s interest in young boys? Apparently so. J Randy Taraborrelli, the celebrity biographer and Jackson’s loyal friend since childhood, continues to believe in Jackson’s innocence and there were a couple of occasions in his interview where you might wish he had been pushed harder. Ultimately though, the non-confrontational strategy paid off in an exchange that is enormously revealing about the nature of denial.</p>
<p>Peretti may not always ask the right question, but he has certainly been asking them of the right people. And now, at long last, the time is also right for genuine reflection. There are astute insights here from a variety of tabloid journalists (admirably candid, to a man) as well as Jackson’s fellow survivor of 70s child stardom Donny Osmond, and Mathew Knowles, talent manager and Beyoncé’s dad. These guys weren’t just there, in the distorting eye of the celebrity storm, they are all too aware of the types of games celebrities played to negotiate media scrutiny.</p>
<p>Is it possible to continue to admire, even enjoy, Jackson’s genius in light of all that we now know? A lot of people remain very invested, both emotionally and financially, in believing that the answer to this question is yes. But the fact that this film touched only very briefly on the evidence of his musical genius is an answer in itself.

<h3 id="michael-jackson-estate-donates-300000-sum-to-covid-19-relief-efforts">Michael Jackson estate donates $300,000 sum to COVID-19 relief efforts</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.mbw.44bytes.net/files/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-05-at-20.53.54.jpg" alt="img">
The Michael Jackson Estate is donating $300,000 to coronavirus response efforts to help three communities that have been severely impacted by the COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>The money is being split three ways, with a $100,000 donation going to each of Broadway Cares, Three Square Food Bank (Southern Nevada’s largest hunger-relief organization) and MusiCares.</p>
<p>Speaking last week to announce the $300,000 contribution, John Branca and John McClain, co-executors of the Estate of Michael Jackson Estate, said: “This virus strikes at the heart of the communities we are close to. We learned today that the legendary Manu Dibango, (“Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin”) passed away from the virus.</p>
<p>“Other performers and support staff in music and on Broadway are sick or have been left without work and are facing an uncertain future. And in Las Vegas, which has been so welcoming to Michael Jackson, the entire city has been shut down leaving thousands of workers and their families devastated and without an income.”</p>
<p>Branca and McClain added: “Michael’s spirit of generosity and helping others during his lifetime is legendary. These donations are inspired by him.”</p>
<p>“Michael’s spirit of generosity and helping others during his lifetime is legendary. These donations are inspired by him.” John Branca and John McClain</p>
<p>In New York, the Estate is answering the challenge made by more than 20 Broadway producers who are matching up to $1 million in donations, doubling the impact of contributions to Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS’ COVID-19 Emergency Assistance Fund. The Estate is currently in production on MJ the Musical with its partner Lia Vollack Productions</p>
<p>“With every passing day that theaters remain dark, entertainment and performing arts professionals face unprecedented and immediate challenges,” said Tom Viola, executive director Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS.</p>
<p>“This incredibly generous donation from the Michael Jackson Estate will help ensure those onstage, backstage and behind the scenes get lifesaving health care, emergency financial assistance and counseling during and after this crisis.”</p>
<p>In Las Vegas, the Estate’s donation will provide 300,000 meals to the needy, and help to maintain Three Square Food Bank’s supplies, the largest foodbank in Southern Nevada.</p>
<p>Since opening in February 2013, Michael Jackson ONE, produced by Cirque du Soleil and the Estate of Michael Jackson, has been one of the most popular shows in Vegas. “Before the pandemic, 1 in 8 Southern Nevadans lived in a food-insecure household and that number will increase exponentially with the displacement of thousands of workers in our community. Thank you to the Estate of Michael Jackson for stepping up to help children, families, veterans and senior citizens who may need help now more than ever,” said Michelle Beck, Chief Development Officer.</p>
<p>MusiCares, a non-profit arm of the Recording Academy – the org behind the Grammys – has announced a Coronavirus Relief Fund which has so far raised multiple millions of dollars.</p>
<p>“MusiCares is very grateful for the outpouring of generosity we’ve seen from many in the music industry to grow the COVID-19 Relief Fund,” said Steve Boom, MusiCares Chair. “The challenges that our industry is facing right now are enormous. It is contributions such as these that will help our community survive in this unprecedented time of tremendous need.”</p>
<p>Other industry parties who have contributed to the MusiCares Relief Fund include Amazon Music, Apple Music, Pandora / SiriusXM, Spotify, TIDAL, Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group and YouTube Music.Music Business Worldwide

<h3 id="tiger-king-left-out-michael-jacksons-unexpected-connection-to-joe-exotic">&lsquo;Tiger King&rsquo; Left out Michael Jackson&rsquo;s Unexpected Connection to Joe Exotic</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.popculture.com/2019/02/michael-jackson-getty-20055469-640x320.jpeg" alt="img">
As if Tiger King wasn&rsquo;t crazy enough, the colorful subject of the hit Netflix docuseries has a tie to late pop star Michael Jackson that wasn&rsquo;t explored. As the documentarians tackled the twisting and turning story of Joseph Maldonado-Passage a.k.a. Joe Exotic&rsquo;s alleged murder-for-hire plot against fellow big cat keeper Carole Baskin, longtime followers of the wild news story pointed out that the former gubernatorial candidate housed alligators and a crocodile once owned by the former King of Pop and rescued from Neverland Ranch after his death.</p>
<p>A 2015 Baltimore Sun story confirms the connection, revealing that seven alligators and a crocodile previously owned by Jackson were victims of a fire that burnt down an entire building and destroyed a video production studio on Joe&rsquo;s property on March 26 of that year. While the Netflix series didn&rsquo;t reveal Jackson&rsquo;s tie to the animals who perished in the fire, it did dive into implications that Joe was behind the fire in order to get rid of hundreds of hours of possibly incriminating footage from the filming of Joe Exotic TV.</p>
<p>At the time of the fire, Garvin County Sheriff Larry Rhode confirmed that the department was suspecting arson as a cause behind the fire, with Joe saying on YouTube at the time of the alleged perpetrator, &ldquo;They might have shut me up for just a little while, but let me tell you they have awoken a monster. Now, Joe Exotic is pissed off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe was never convicted of arson, but in the final episode of Tiger King, was sentenced to 22 years in prison, having been convicted of multiple charges including an alleged assassination plot against fellow big cat keeper Carole Baskin.</p>
<p>Joe is still in prison to this day, but the former zookeeper has filed a $95 million federal lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Interior, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and government agents, accusing them of violating his civil rights. In the legal filing, obtained by PEOPLE, Joe has claimed $73,840,000 is for loss of personal property; 18 years of research; and care of 200 generic tigers and cross-breeds for 365 days a year, at a rate of $60/day per animal. An additional $15 million is for false arrest, false imprisonment, selective enforcement and the death of his mother, Shirley, he claims.</p>
