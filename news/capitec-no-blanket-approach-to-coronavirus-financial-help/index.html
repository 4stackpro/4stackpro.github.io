Capitec won&rsquo;t adopt a one-size-fits-all approach to assisting financially distressed clients impacted by the coronavirus lockdown, according to CEO Gerrie Fourie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would apply what is appropriate to the client&hellip; we can&rsquo;t apply a blanket approach,&rdquo; said Fourie, who was speaking after the bank reported a 19% rise in annual headline earnings to R6.28 billion.</p>
<p>With 13.9 million clients, Capitec would extend a variety of options to clients whose income has been impacted by the lockdown, including a provision for claiming against credit insurance, payment rescheduling or payment breaks.</p>
<p>Fourie said the five-week lockdown, enforced by government to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, is likely to have a negative economic impact in the short term, but added that it was difficult – at this stage – to assess the virus&rsquo; overall impact as there were too many variables to consider.</p>
<p>However, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni said earlier on Tuesday that Treasury was anticipating a deep recession and would be reprioritising the national budget. Business for South Africa, an alliance formed four weeks ago in the wake of the pandemic, has warned that as many as one million jobs could be lost, according to its early modelling.</p>
<p>Capitec at the coalface</p>
<p>Patrick Mathidi, Head of Equities at Aluwani Capital, said Capitec&rsquo;s exposure to the unsecured lending market puts the bank &ldquo;at the coalface of the lockdown&rdquo; financial impact, as a large number of their client base might find themselves unable to service debt due to loss of employment. This is likely to lead to a spike in bad debt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unlike other big banks, Capitec does not have a diversified business offering, even their business division which they got into through the acquisition of Mercantile Bank is not big enough to help them absorb the pressure,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The impact will hit once people start losing jobs&hellip; once that happens, no amount of debt restructuring can help them if people have no jobs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Capitec&rsquo;s primary focus had been in the lower segment of the market, but the bank has over the past few years gradually made inroads in the higher income base.</p>
<p>The bank, which is now the largest in terms of client numbers, had in the year under review attracted higher-income clients, allowing it to advance better quality loans at lower interest rates.</p>
<p>During the financial year to end February, Capitec reported a 19% increase in loans over the 37-84 month loan period, and 52% of credit granted over the last three months to clients with a net income over R20 000.</p>
<p>Gross loans and credit cards in arrears by three months or more, including debt review and handed over loans, ticked up from R5.7 billion in 2019 to R7.4 billion.</p>
<p>Fourie said given the tougher trading conditions, Capitec tightened its affordability criteria and raised the minimum living expenses threshold for its credit clients.</p>
<p>Technology push</p>
<p>The bank had increased digital clients by 29% to 6.7 million clients, and the coronavirus pandemic had propelled it to act with urgency to implement some of the digital innovations which were initially planned for later in the year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For instance, we have had to convert our branches into call centres, whereby our consultants can talk to clients and perform transactions which were normally performed in a branch,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was not even planned, we got a team together in a very short space of time&hellip;. and within 7-8 days we delivered the product.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said the system was already tested in 40 branches, and plans were afoot to roll-out the system to other branches.</p>
<p>No dividend</p>
<p>In line with the Reserve Bank recommendation to banking institutions, the bank would not declare a dividend for the year, the first in its 20-year history.</p>
<p>There will also be no increases in director fees and senior executive salaries, and senior executives will not be paid cash bonuses.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank&rsquo;s Prudential Authority earlier this month advised banks not to distribute ordinary dividends, and for bonuses to senior executives in the wake of Covid-19, saying there was a high probability that the impact of virus which has hit the global markets will result in heightened stress in the banking system.

Capitec Bank increased its profits by 19% in the year to 29 February.</p>
<p>Picture credit: @CapitecBankSA</p>
<p>Its headline earnings per share came in at 5428 cents (up from 4557 cents).</p>
<p>The bank will not pay a dividend amid the Covid-19 outbreak, heeding a call by the South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) to preserve capital for lending.</p>
<p>The fast-growing bank usually doles out 40% of its profits to shareholders.</p>
<p>The Money Show’s Bruce Whitfield interviewed Gerrie Fourie, CEO at Capitec Bank.</p>
<p>The history [reported results] is gone… given the magnitude of this [Covid-19] … Our customers are vulnerable… we are concerned… Gerrie Fourie, CEO - Capitec Bank</p>
<p>We have 1200 people working from home… Gerrie Fourie, CEO - Capitec Bank</p>

<p><img src="https://www.moneyweb.co.za/wp-content/themes/moneywebimages/facebook_logo.png" alt="img">
Audited Summary Financial Statements For The Year Ended 29 February 2020: <a href="https://senspdf.jse.co.za/documents/2020/jse/isse/cpi/CPIFY20.pdf">https://senspdf.jse.co.za/documents/2020/jse/isse/cpi/CPIFY20.pdf</a></p>
<p>Audited Summary Financial Statements For The Year Ended 29 February 2020 CAPITEC BANK HOLDINGS LIMITED</p>
<p>Registration number: 1999/025903/06</p>
<p>Registered bank controlling company</p>
<p>Incorporated in the Republic of South Africa</p>
<p>JSE ordinary share code: CPI</p>
<p>ISIN code: ZAE000035861</p>
<p>JSE preference share code: CPIP</p>
<p>ISIN code: ZAE000083838</p>
<p>(“Capitec” or “the company” or “the group”) AUDITED SUMMARY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED</p>
<p>29 FEBRUARY 2020 1. SALIENT FEATURES Operating profit before tax increased by 14% to R8.06 billion, from R7.08 billion in the</p>
<p>prior year. Headline earnings per share increased by 19% to 5 428 cents per share, from 4 577</p>
<p>cents per share in the prior year. Earnings per share increased by 18% to 5 400 cents per share, from 4 571 cents per</p>
<p>share in the prior year. Total dividends per share decreased by 57% to 755 cents per share, from 1 750 cents</p>
<p>per share in the prior year. 2. DIVIDEND Capitec’s ordinary dividend policy is to pay out 40% of headline earnings. As Capitec’s</p>
<p>capital base and liquidity ratios remain strong, it was the intention of the board to declare</p>
<p>the final dividend this year. The South African Reserve Bank published Guidance Note</p>
<p>4/2020 on 6 April 2020 in which banks are directed to act prudently in preserving capital</p>
<p>and focusing on financial and economic stability. This is due to the absence of appropriate</p>
<p>factual information to determine the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the South</p>
<p>African economy. There is a clear expectation communicated in the Guidance Note that</p>
<p>banks should not declare ordinary dividends for the time being. The board therefore</p>
<p>considered the guidance of the Reserve Bank as well as the expectation of ordinary</p>
<p>shareholders regarding the dividend declaration. After extensive deliberation, the board</p>
<p>decided to support the guidance of the Reserve Bank and decided against the declaration</p>
<p>of the final ordinary dividend. 3. SHORT-FORM ANNOUNCEMENT This short-form announcement is the responsibility of the directors of the company. It</p>
