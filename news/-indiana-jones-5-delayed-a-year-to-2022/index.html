Disney confirmed a massive re-shuffling of its major upcoming titles due to the coronavirus pandemic, and the much-delayed untitled Indiana Jones 5 got caught in the mess. The film, which was previously dated for July 9, 2021, has been moved to July 29, 2022.</p>
<p>This is just the latest hiccup in what’s been a wild ride getting Indiana Jones back on the screen, a process that’s been happening on and off (and on and off again) pretty much since Kingdom of the Crystal Skull debuted in 2008. Just this February, the franchise made a massive shift when it was announced James Mangold would take over directing duties from Steven Spielberg, marking the first time anyone other than the Raiders of the Lost Ark filmmaker would helm an Indy feature. Harrison Ford is still set to reprise the lead role, and according to the actor, production was scheduled to start right around now.</p>
<p>Assuming this movie ever makes it to the screen—and despite all the obstacles and the fact Crystal Skull is an unholy abomination better left unmentioned, I still want it to happen—plot details are still few and far between. Back in February, the most Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy would offer is that “it’s not a reboot, it’s a continuation.”</p>
<p>For more on Disney’s completely new slate, here are the new release dates for Dwayne Johnson‘s Jungle Cruise and Ryan Reynolds‘ Free Guy, along with all the upcoming MCU films including Black Widow, Shang-Chi, and Thor: Love and Thunder.

<h3 id="disney-sets-tentative-new-dates-for-mulan-marvel-and-indiana-jones">Disney Sets Tentative New Dates for Mulan, Marvel and Indiana Jones</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5e877eca79d3fb0008ca2e31/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/new-disney-release-dates.png" alt="img">
The coronavirus quarantine has shuttered theaters around the world, and when Disney halted the release of its live-action Mulan and Marvel&rsquo;s Black Widow, it created a traffic among the rest of its upcoming releases.</p>
<p>Today, the studio announced a new slate of debut dates over the span of the next two years, which postpones nearly all the upcoming Marvel movies, and further delays Harrison Ford&rsquo;s return in Indiana Jones 5, which once upon a time was supposed to open in summer 2019.</p>
<p>Mulan was previously set to open last weekend, but now it has been assigned the somewhat optimistic new date of July 24, bumping another Disney movie, Dwayne Johnson&rsquo;s Jungle Cruise, from that weekend to a release more than a year later, on July 30, 2021.</p>
<p>Scarlett Johansson&rsquo;s Black Widow, which would have opened May 1, will now claim the Nov. 6 spot of another Marvel movie, The Eternals, a cosmic drama starring Angelina Jolie, Kumail Nanjiani, and Kit Harrington, that will now hit theaters four months later on Feb. 12, 2021.</p>
<p>That set off a chain reaction among Marvel movies. It threatens to become a litany, but stick with it:</p>
<p>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, starring Simu Liu as the comic book warrior, lost its date to The Eternals. Now Shang Chi will take the May 7, 2021 spot previously occupied by &hellip;</p>
<p>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which will move to Nov. 5, 2021 — the previously planned debut for&hellip;</p>
<p>Thor: Love and Thunder, which falls back to Feb. 18, 2022.</p>
<p>At that point, the ripple effect stops. Black Panther 2 will stay on its May 8, 2022 date, and Captain Marvel 2 actually moves up—with Disney saying it had planned it for July 29, 2022, but now will come out on July 8, 2022. That&rsquo;s to make room for Indiana Jones 5, which is now taking the later July date.</p>
<p>The delay also buys time for the return of a certain whip-cracking archaeologist. Steven Spielberg has previously announced he would be stepping back from directing. Ford v. Ferrari director James Mangold is reportedly in talks to take on the project, and Ford will remain on as star. When the film was first announced in 2016, it was set to debut in the summer of 2019, which, obviously, didn&rsquo;t happen. After several release date changes, Indy&rsquo;s return was supposed to be July 9, 2021, but now will take place more than a year later.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this is tentative, according to sources within Disney. If the Covid-19 crisis worsens or the quarantine extends much longer than forecast, all of these dates could shuffle again, and those films planned for farther out may not even begin production due to the work stoppages.</p>
<p>Among other titles under the Disney banner that are changing spots, Wes Anderson&rsquo;s newspaper comedy The French Dispatch has been delayed three months from July 24 of this year to Oct. 16, the Artemis Fowl adaptation planned for May 29 will now debut on the Disney+ streaming service at an as yet undecided date, and the Ryan Reynolds video game character comedy Free Guy will movie from this July 3 to Dec. 11.</p>
<p>The Searchlight pictures titles, such as horror film Antlers and the Charles Dickens adaptation The Personal History of David Copperfield, do not yet have new release dates, and neither does the Fox thriller Woman in the Window and its perpetually delayed superhero film The New Mutants.

Wegen Corona &ldquo;Indiana Jones 5&rdquo; kommt erst 2022</p>
<p>Fans von Henry Walton Jones, genannt &ldquo;Indiana&rdquo;, müssen Geduld haben: Der Archäologie-Professor kehrt frühestens in zwei Jahren ins Kino zurück, teilt Disney mit. Darsteller Harrison Ford wäre dann 80 Jahre alt.
