<p>20:40 GMT - OPEC+ approves historic oil deal amid coronavirus pandemic</p>
<p>OPEC, Russia and other oil-producing nations agreed on Sunday to cut output by a record amount, representing around 10 percent of global supply, to support oil prices amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>20:30 GMT - Could coronavirus-induced recession be more deadly than the disease?</p>
<p>Just how deadly could a coronavirus-induced recession be? One recent study suggests the current economic slowdown roiling the world may end up killing more people than the virus itself. But some economists say the downturn could actually boost overall life expectancy. In the end, how it affects you could boil down to the role you play in the global economy.</p>
<p>United States President Donald Trump has seized on the likely lethality of a recession to argue that the US economy should be reopened as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have suicides over things like this when you have terrible economies,&rdquo; Trump said in a news conference on March 24. &ldquo;You have death. Probably - and I mean definitely - would be in far greater numbers than the numbers that we&rsquo;re talking about with regard to the virus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maurizio Cecconi, chair of Anasthesia and Intensive Care at the Humanitas Hospital in Milan, describes the strategies doctors are using to treat coronavirus patients in Italy in the absence of therapeutics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Lombardy, it became very clear there was a high percentage of cases that required respiratory support. Up to 10-12 percent required invasive mechanical ventilation,&rdquo; he tells Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, so far, we don&rsquo;t have specific therapies against this virus. What we do have is good supportive care. So what we try to do in intensive care is &hellip; to give our patients in intensive care rest while we do the work of breathing for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We call some of these strategies protective lung strategies because the ventilators we use don&rsquo;t cure the lung, they give precious time to the lungs to heal. So our job really is to buy time for our patients so that their immune systems can fight the virus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>00:10 GMT - Trump warned &lsquo;early and often&rsquo; on coronavirus pandemic</p>
<p>An examination by The New York Times reveals top White House advisers and experts in the US intelligence community warned President Donald Trump early on about the potential for a coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The warnings include a memo by Peter Navarro, Trump&rsquo;s top trade adviser, in which he said a pandemic could kill as many as 500,000 people in the US and cause trillions of dollars in economic losses.</p>
<p>Alex M Azar II, health and human services secretary, directly warned Trump of the possibility of a pandemic on January 30, the second warning he delivered to the president about the virus in two weeks, according to The Times.</p>
<p>But Trump &ldquo;was slow to absorb the scale of the virus&rsquo;s risk,&rdquo; focusing instead on controlling the message and protecting gains in the economy. The Times also blames internal divisions, lack of planning and the president&rsquo;s faith in his own instincts for the US&rsquo;s halting response.</p>

<p>In season three, Eve is alive and working somewhere in London as a cook. Meanwhile, Villanelle is in Barcelona and up to her murderous ways. With our main characters separated, what can viewers expect out of the new season?</p>
<p>“When I think about season 3, I think about how much more we learn about all of our four main characters, Villanelle, Eve, Konstantin, and Carolyn,” Killing Eve producer Sally Woodward Gentle told Entertainment Weekly, “We are going to be let in a lot more to them as individuals that we have been let in before.”</p>
<p>What channels are AMC and BBC America on?</p>
