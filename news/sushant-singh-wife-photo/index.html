<p><img src="https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/715_-/2020/06/sushmita-1592184964.jpg" alt="img">
The country was left in shock after the news of actor Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s suicide started doing rounds. The 34-year-old Bollywood actor was found hanging at his Bandra residence on June 14. When there was no response after repeated knocks, his domestic help called the neighbours after which police arrived shortly and broke into his room where he was found hanging around 12.30 pm. It came to light that he was suffering from depression and was even getting treatment from Hinduja hospital for the last six months. After the untimely death of the stay, various celebrities were left in shock and had only one question as to why he took the drastic step. One amongst those was actress Sushmita Sen who took to her social media to share a long post and spoke about how it is important to stay positive in life because a person is only responsible for his own happiness. She even spoke about how insecurities can grow in the life of a celebrity with name and sometimes, bank balance.</p>
<p>Sushmita shared a photo that read, &lsquo;protect your peace.&rsquo; Alongside she wrote the long post reading, &ldquo;Look good, show good&hellip;be good..ALL THE TIME!! Projection becomes one’s life, both on &amp; off screen. Insecurities grow with name &amp; sometimes, bank balance. All these may be known triggers in an actors life&hellip;but it’s actually true about a lot of us from all different walks of life&hellip;only differing in magnitude &amp; visibility!! Young people with so much life &amp; promise ahead of them, some with great depth &amp; will power&hellip;can choose to take their own life is deeply disturbing. How do we say, we know people &amp; still not see it coming? Have we become experts at hiding our pain or does no one have the time to really SEE it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further, she said, &ldquo;How lonely &amp; hopeless can prolonged silence make you? Do we alienate a life by judging it constantly? In the race of the projection of “look good, show good, be good” have we lost the most important ability to FEEL GOOD? Life has its share of pressures for EVERYONE&hellip;no one is excused that, no matter what your standing!! Life is a graph with its ups &amp; downs for EVERYONE, even if we can’t always see it. Yet, FIGHT FOR LIFE WE MUST&hellip;it’s the only vehicle that will help lead us from bad times to GOOD ONES again!!! “WHEN YOU’RE TIRED&hellip; LEARN TO REST, NOT QUIT.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She also wrote about how building a life takes a lot of faith and courage while taking one&rsquo;s life just needs a moment of madness. She said, &ldquo;We can’t change the world, but we can choose self preservation over the noise, chaos, demands, insensitive scrutinisation &amp; conditioned insecurities&hellip;.by befriending ourselves, being around people who really LISTEN, having faith in God’s unique plan JUST FOR YOU!!! Be unafraid to ask for help &amp; know that you are NOT ALONE. Building a life demands a lot of faith, courage, resilience &amp; hard work&hellip;whereas taking your life just needs a MOMENT of madness&hellip;choose to distract yourself from THAT moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the professional front, Sushmita will be making her &lsquo;incredible&rsquo; comeback through her upcoming web series &lsquo;Aarya&rsquo; in which she will be seen playing the role of a mother who is willing to go to any length to protect her children. The show also features Namit Das, Sikandar Kher, Jayant Kripalani, Sohaila Kapoor, Sugandha Garg, Maya Sareen, Vishwajeet Pradhan and Manish Chaudhary. It is directed by Ram Madhwani, is scheduled to hit Disney+ Hotstar VIP on the 19th of June 2020.</p>

<p>Photos of Akriti Sood, wife of Major Anuj Sood who was killed in an anti-terror operation in Jammu and Kashmir&rsquo;s Handwara over the weekend, mourning her husband, drew an overwhelmingly emotional response on social media on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Akriti Sood threw her arms around the coffin as it was being put on an army vehicle decorated with flowers, for the short journey from the family&rsquo;s Panchkula home to the Mani Majra cremation ground in neighbouring Chandigarh, news agency PTI reported.</p>
<p>His sister Harshita, who is also an army officer, was seen consoled her sister-in-law.</p>
<p>In heart-rending photographs that were shared thousands of times on Twitter, Akriti Sood was seen sitting next to the coffin quietly looking into it with grief too powerful to be put into words or tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was a true son of the nation,&rdquo; he said at his Panchkula home.</p>
<p>Major Anuj Sood was from the Brigade of the Guards regiment, now part of the 21 Rashtriya Rifles.</p>
<p>He joined the National Defence Academy in 2008. He had one dream, which was to join the army, according to his family.</p>
<p>His family said the officer was scheduled to return home after a gap of six months. Having finished his two-year stint in Jammu and Kashmir, he was to join the 12 Guards unit in Gurdaspur.

<p>Updated: Jan 21, 2020 15:31 IST</p>
<p>Actor Rhea Chakraborty shared a very special birthday wish for actor and her thus-far rumoured boyfriend, Sushant Singh Rajput. With her latest post, she is appeared to have made their relationship Insta-offical.</p>
<p>Rhea shared two pictures from their recent secret holiday to wish Sushant. In one photo, they are seen sitting on a bench with bright green grass and tall trees behind them. Rhea has her arm around Sushant’s neck while he is seen looking at her face. The second picture shows them on a boat in front of a cave. In this picture, he is seen leaning on her while she wraps him in her arms.</p>
<p>“Happy birthday to the most beautiful supermassive black hole that is known to mankind! Shine on you crazy diamond @sushantsinghrajput #boywithagoldenheart #rheality,” she captioned the post. Sushant replied, “Thank youuuuuuu my Rockstarrrr.”</p>
<p>Sushant had also recently shared a picture of Rhea on Instagram, calling her ‘my jalebi’. Rumours about their relationship began in May last year. However, they never confirmed the reports but their frequent dates and holidays seem to hint that they are a couple.</p>

<p>Sushant was in a long relationship with Manikarnika actor Ankita Lokhande for many years. They started dating when they worked together on TV soap Pavitra Rishta. They broke up in 2016.</p>
<p>When asked in an interview if he was seeing someone, Sushant recently said, “I’m seeing many. Oh, you mean it as a metaphor? I’m not allowed to say. It’s not that someone else is saying that I’m not allowed to say it. I cannot allow myself to say anything.”</p>
<p>He also said he needs to ask “that somebody” if he can talk about it: “If you ask me any question that has to do with me, I can say it. If I was seeing somebody, I’d have to ask that somebody. Probably your question, if well-founded, will help me insinuate it to the other person to know what to say next time. And probably when you put me on the cover next time, I’ll say it.”</p>
<p>Sushant was last seen opposite Jacqueline Fernandez in Netflix’s Drive, while Rhea was seen in the romantic drama Jalebi, which released in 2018.</p>

<p>After dodging questions on his relationship status for months, Sushant Singh Rajput seems to have finally let the cat out of the bag. He shared a picture of Rhea Chakraborty on his Instagram story and called her “my jalebi”(a reference to her last release Jalebi), seemingly confirming months of speculation that they are in a relationship. However, the picture is no longer visible on his account.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput’s Instagram story</p>
<p>When Sushant was asked if he was single by RJ Siddharth Kannan in an interview, he joked that he will charge a bomb to reveal the truth. He quipped that one of the key reasons that he became an actor was so that he could take a lot money to answer such personal questions.</p>
<p>The actor said, “Main na engineering college mein padta tha, toh maine bohot mehnat ki hai hero banne ke liye… Kyun bana hoon, uska ek reason yeh hai ki aise personal question ka sach mein answer karne ke liye na, main bohot paise lunga. Main cover lunga kisi kaand magazine ka, paise lunga, aur phir bolunga, main hoon ya nahi hoon. Aise free mein thodi bolunga! (I have studied in an engineering college and I worked very hard to become a hero&hellip; One of the reasons that I chose this profession is so that I can charge a lot of money to answer such personal questions truthfully. It will take a cover of a huge magazine and a lot of money, only then I will tell the truth about whether or not I am single. I will not give it away for free!)”</p>

<p>Rumours of Sushant and Rhea’s relationship first began doing the rounds in May last year. While the two have always remained tight-lipped about the link-up rumours, their frequent dates and romantic holidays seem to give it away.</p>
<p>Sushant was last seen opposite Jacqueline Fernandez in Netflix’s Drive, while Rhea was seen in the romantic drama Jalebi, which released in 2018.</p>
