<h3 id="what-does-covid-19-mean-for-the-social-fabric-of-our-nations">What does COVID-19 mean for the social fabric of our nations?</h3>
<p><img src="https://bfpg.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/1c0ae2205709722b62e843abc0471a55_XL.jpg" alt="img">
What does COVID-19 mean for the social fabric of our nations?</p>
<p>As much of the world has entered into a bleak period of social confinement and dramatic economic decline, there has been an understandable urge to identify the upshot of this dark moment in global history. In particular, the desire to regard the pandemic as an opportunity to spark a kind of social, economic and political ‘reset’, reinstating a nostalgic vision of a simpler, more community-focused time.</p>
<p>In 1887, Friedrich Engels predicted that only a brutal war would provide the necessary chaos and economic disruption to precipitate a revolution. In 2020, these kinds of hopefully utilitarian aspirations for the pandemic are not confined to any one political tradition. In Western nations in particular, COVID-19 has been portrayed as ‘the Great Leveller’. Yet, it is difficult to afford this notion any credence beyond the superficial universal requirements of behavioural change.</p>
<p>The flagrant use of this term reveals much about the social challenges in Western liberal democracies, which pre-dated this pandemic. As our societies have become more diverse in every sense, and more empowered, the task of conjuring the ‘imagined community’ that Benedict Anderson espoused has become more difficult. And with the arrival of pandemic, the public sphere itself is reconfigured to some degree, with millions tuning in to watch national broadcasts from leaders and their advisers, providing the backdrop of that most elusive quality of modern life: a shared reality.</p>
<p>A survey I published just before the crisis showed that the desire for a greater degree of national unity was one of the few consensus positions in European nations. The outsized salience of nostalgia in Western politics and its cultural resonance at least in part captures the absence of community-forging national tests over recent decades, and strengthens the potency of historical crises such as the Second World War. Leaders and citizens alike have been desperate to chart a course towards a rejuvenation of social ties, because the fragmentation of communities on the back of economic and technological change has made it more difficult to govern and embedded a persistent sense of insecurity.</p>
<p>Over recent years, new identities have emerged and assumed an astonishing degree of power and influence, with societies polarising around generational, socio-economic, educational, regional and gender lines. Over the past five years, policy-makers and researchers and have frequently discussed how an effective invocation of the community underpinning ‘the nation’ could provide the key to softening some of these seemingly insurmountable barriers – repairing the atomising effects of our late-stage capitalist, digital era lives.</p>
<p>There was a considerable desire amongst citizens, too, to believe in the crisis alchemy of social trust. At the outbreak of the crisis I appeared on Sky News discussing, amongst other things, the feverish stockpiling of toilet paper and penne pasta that had consumed the United Kingdom. It was suggested that this behaviour, disadvantaging the elderly and vulnerable, was completely out of character – this is, after all, the land of the Blitz Spirit. When I made the point that the Blitz saw moments of great heroism and selflessness, but also precipitated astonishing spikes in the levels of violent, sexual and petty crime, I received a torrent of threats and abuse on social media and via email for having tarnished the legacy of this crucial period in the national consciousness.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought out some of the best traits of the people of the United Kingdom, a nation that prides itself on its generosity; not least of all, the staggering number of applications to volunteer for the National Health Service. Yet, it cannot come as a surprise that stressful situations that inspire a degree of competition around access to scarce resources do not always lead to the highest expression of the immense capacities of human nature. Many other less visible and more troubling forms of destructive social behaviour, whether child abuse, domestic violence, or the tinder box compelled in council estates by confining large families in cramped, unsatisfactory accommodations – have predictably flared, with devastating and lasting consequences for the victims.</p>
<p>As I discussed last week, there is nothing endemic in this crisis that naturally suggests that populism in the West will fall by the wayside in its aftermath – even despite the rallying we have seen ‘around the flag’ in many nations, and the renewed empowerment of our institutions. Similarly, any sense of national unity the pandemic inspires is vulnerable to erosion as we over-compensate for our confinement in the transition, and in the face of the acceleration of social conflict and competition seething beneath the surface of this collective test. At the heart of this pandemic is in fact a very unevenly experienced situation.</p>
<p>While it began as the ‘globalists’ disease’, striking down politicians and political staff, those attending international conferences, or partaking in skiing holidays in the Dolomites, the citizens who bear the brunt of hospitalisations, and indeed deaths, are those with underlying medical and health conditions. Conditions that often reflect deep structural inequalities – including the higher rates of diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, smoking and respiratory illness – affecting citizens from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Those in cities are especially vulnerable, with air pollution linked to a higher propensity for complications and even death. As are those with mental health conditions. In some nations, including the United States, socio-economic disparities are fused onto racial inequalities – meaning citizens from BAME backgrounds are disproportionately likely to be hospitalised, and to pass away.</p>
<p>The trauma of another economic recession of this nature will be collectively shared, yet ultimately, the personal financial impacts of this pandemic will also be asymmetrical. While governments are offering unprecedented interventions to help shield workers and employers from the brunt of the disruption, as in the 2008-09 Financial Crisis, it will be the young who are most vulnerable to its immediate and long-term effects. As the Resolution Foundation noted, “The Government is rightly socialising much of the costs of this crisis […] But these approaches create insider/outsider dynamics in which the young come off worst – compensating people for the earnings they already had rather than the potential earnings they would otherwise have received”. So too are many women, already disadvantaged in their career earnings by the structural inequalities of child-bearing, housework and family caring responsibilities, bearing the brunt of burden of this crisis to the working lives of parents.</p>
<p>The daily experience of this allegedly unifying crisis is also deeply subject to personal circumstance. While we all must undertake social distancing, limiting many of the pleasures of life – and certainly the fall is greatest for those who are able to regularly partake in a vibrant social calendar, excursions to restaurants and the theatre, and overseas travel – the environment in which we live through this ‘lockdown’ varies tremendously. While abuse and violence are of course the extreme, though distressingly common, expressions of disadvantage, many citizens safe in their homes are also – due to prohibitive housing costs – living in small, dark flats with no outdoor spaces. Contrast this with the experience of those living in the countryside, or with large gardens, and the scale of the disparities of constraint and sacrifice become clear.</p>
<p>While images of middle-class runners sprinting buoyantly through parks in their Lululemon athletic gear feature heavily on the news, policy-makers are all too aware that every day that the lockdown continues, many other citizens are eating more, smoking more, drinking more, and experiencing a greater degree of mental strain than they would in their ordinary lives. The elderly have lost many of the activities and support services that maintain their quality of life. Children are forced to confront dark sides of the world previously unbeknownst to their innocent minds. Those who rely on medical support and interventions, including cancer patients, are treading water, and those with undiagnosed conditions may now only discover their illnesses at a dangerous moment in their spread.</p>
<p>The costs to society, and to the state, mount day by day – forcing governments to balance choices about which groups of individuals, and which types of afflictions, are to be privileged.</p>
<p>Worryingly, many of the groups disproportionately affected in a negative manner by the economic, social and daily experiences of the crisis, are those most vulnerable to political disengagement. If there is an eventual backlash from this crisis – and remembering that the ‘lag’ on shaping political behaviour can be relatively long – it could potentially deepen and embed disenfranchisement amongst certain social groups, or equally, create the conditions for a new wave of anti-establishment movements predicated on correcting injustices and inequalities revealed by the crisis. Depending on your personal politics, this second scenario may appear to be a positive option; however, simply from the perspective of governance and social cohesion, it would undoubtedly foretell more rocky years ahead.</p>
<p>I do not wish to appear to forecast only lasting doom and gloom from this crisis. Indeed, there are many ways in which it could indeed offer a pathway towards some profound social reckonings – lighting a fire under burgeoning movements towards a recalculation of our relationship with nature, with work, and with one another. Amidst the obvious stresses, parents are given the chance of a modern lifetime to bond with their children. There will be tremendous opportunities for third sector organisations to have their work more visible and valued, and to build on the momentum of charitable and community acts compelled by the pandemic’s swift hand. It also feels inevitable to some extent that lower-paid workers (often described as ‘unskilled’) on the frontline of this crisis will be afforded a greater degree of respect, and that there will be increased public pressure to reduce the pernicious environmental impacts of industry and transport.</p>
<p>The pandemic has already compelled a surge in public sector innovation and an unprecedented degree of speed in policy responses, and enacted changes to the welfare state that will be difficult to reverse – including the long-called-for adjustments to the payment level and access period of Universal Credit, the UK Government’s flagship centralised welfare payment system. It is also difficult to imagine that the red lines of the first iteration of the UK Government’s new immigration policy will remain as fixed, with thousands of desperately needed frontline NHS migrant workers having had their visas extended in the heat of the crisis.</p>
<p>Ultimately, governments will need to ask themselves why is it unacceptable for citizens to experience acute poverty or social deprivation during a pandemic, and acceptable at other times? Why must social media organisations intervene to combat conspiracy theories about the coronavirus, but are allowed wash their hands of the harmful proliferation of conspiracy theories that work daily to undermine social and political trust? Why is it outrageous for a woman to suffer at the hands of her partner during a lockdown, and somehow not worthy of our outrage on a ‘normal’ day? Is it because the circumstances conjured by the pandemic are seen as so outside of reasonable individual agency? In asking ourselves these questions, we may well begin to expand our common societal understanding of what is ‘beyond a person’s control’, and in doing so, find ourselves willing to look with fresh and frank eyes at some of the more enduring structural barriers that have persisted in plain sight.</p>
<p>Yet, it is nonetheless important to caution – and particularly in light of the very human desire for this crisis to somehow, naturally lead us towards salvation – that its harmful social effects will be profound and potentially long-lasting. And that governments will find themselves at the ‘end’ of all of this, with a list of unresolved problems that pre-dated the crisis, as well as these more recent consequences of the pandemic itself.</p>
<p>While it is perfectly possible that leaders can rise to this tremendous challenge, we do not have ample evidence from the past five years – which has ‘brought up the bodies’ of many simmering tensions and conflicts and inequalities – of their will and capacity to do so. Perhaps the trauma and jolt of this fast-moving, wide-reaching pandemic will provide the grist to the mill to support this in a manner that was not possible before its emergence. It is too early to say. All we can assert with certainty, is that no outcomes are inevitable.

<h3 id="how-to-make-fabric-face-masks-without-using-elastic-during-coronavirus">How to Make Fabric Face Masks Without Using Elastic During Coronavirus</h3>
<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/9849a71c-3b86-4340-a2a3-09303b66441c/thumb_1920x1080_00002_1586366932_64218.jpg?fill=2:1&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">
As healthcare workers have been left with personal protective equipment (PPE) in short supply due to the coronavirus pandemic, companies and individuals—from Matouk to Apple—have stepped in to manufacture masks, face shields, hospital gowns, and more. If, like many crafters we know, you&rsquo;re itching to find a way to help, look no further: The team at textile manufacturer Thibaut, whose employees have been making masks all week, are showing us how it&rsquo;s done. Grab some scrap fabric and get your sewing machine, or even your needle-and-thread, ready.</p>
<p>But first: Why are so many people making masks anyway?</p>
<p>The spread of the coronavirus—and ensuing cases of COVID-19—has decimated supplies of medical-grade masks, leaving many healthcare professionals resorting to re-wearing potentially contaminated masks several days in a row or even creating makeshift masks from T-shirts or bandanas. Additionally, due to new recommendations from the CDC, more and more civilians are wearing masks in public to prevent the spread and pickup of germs.</p>
<p>Do cloth masks protect against coronavirus?</p>
<p>No mask or shield has a 100% success rate at blocking the spread of the virus. The most effective masks are surgical-grade and N95 masks, but, given that those are in shor -supply, many hospitals have urged their workers to use whatever is available. Cloth face coverings are a way of &ldquo;bridging the gap,&rdquo; providing coverings that are not ideal but are better than nothing. The mask pattern Thibaut created features two layers of tight-knit cotton, which, while not on par with medical-grade masks, offers more protection than, say, a bandana.</p>
<p>Additionally, the CDC is currently recommending civilians wear cloth face coverings when in public.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the best way to use the mask?</p>
<p>The CDC recommends that face coverings: &ldquo;fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face, be secured with ties or ear loops, include multiple layers of fabric, allow for breathing without restriction, and be able to be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to shape.&rdquo; For this reason, your best bet is to use pre-shrunk fabric and/or wash and dry the masks before donation or use.</p>
<p>When removing the mask, you should be careful that it doesn&rsquo;t touch your eyes as you take it off your face.</p>
<p>How do you care for a cloth mask?</p>
<p>Cloth masks should be laundered regularly—and you should wash your hands (for the recommended 20 seconds!) before putting on and after removing a face mask.</p>
<p>Should anyone not wear a mask?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance,&rdquo; says the CDC, since the coverage may make breathing more difficult.</p>
<p>So how do I make my own fabric face mask?</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a step-by-step tutorial from the wonderful team at Thibaut.</p>
<p>Supplies:</p>
<p>Fabric</p>
<p>Ruler or yardstick</p>
<p>Scissors</p>
<p>Pins</p>
<p>Sewing machine (or needle and thread and some extra time!)</p>

<p>1.Measure pattern</p>
<p>Before you get started, you&rsquo;ll need a pattern. Luckily, we got Maria from Thibaut to share her template, above, so you can use that to measure and trace onto your chosen fabric. Note that for each mask, you&rsquo;ll want four of the main shape (so that the mask is double-layered) as well as four 12&rdquo; x 1&rdquo; strips to serve as mask ties, since elastic has proven difficult to come by (if you happen to have elastic at home, you can forego the straps in favor of elastic loops).</p>
<p>House Beautiful</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Cut fabric</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve traced the pattern onto your fabric, cut the pieces out using sharp scissors. Tip: It may be easier to cut one long length of 48&rdquo; x 1&rdquo; fabric for the straps, then divide it in 4 pieces later.</p>
<p>House Beautiful</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Create mask layers</li>
</ol>
<p>Place two of your fabric pieces together, patterned-side facing in. Sew them together along the curved long side, then unfold so they create one long (now curved) piece. Repeat with two more pieces so you have two layers of face covering; these will make up the inside and outside of your mask.</p>
<p>House Beautiful</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Sew three sides of the mask</li>
</ol>
<p>Place the two mask pieces you&rsquo;ve just created on top of each other, again pattern face-in. Sew together along both short edges and one long edge, leaving the second long edge open. Turn the mask right-side out! Sew the final side.</p>
<p>House Beautiful</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Sew straps</li>
</ol>
<p>Fold your 12&rdquo; x 1&rdquo; strips (or 48&rdquo; x 1&rdquo; single strip) over twice and feed this carefully into the sewing machine to secure it into a thin strap. Tip: Since this piece is so narrow, you&rsquo;ll want to go slowly with your machine to achieve a straight line.</p>
<p>House Beautiful</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Attach straps</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have four 12&rdquo; straps, attach one to each corner of the mask. Tip: Make sure you&rsquo;re sewing on the outside of the mask; should be the side where the pattern is visible!</p>
<p>House Beautiful</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Finish mask</li>
</ol>
<p>Flip the mask right side out and sew down the remaining side. Voilà, you have a mask!</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Donate to your nearest healthcare center!</li>
</ol>
<p>Stacy Senior Allan, marketing director at Thibaut, suggests including a note, which Thibaut is doing with each mask it donates. &ldquo;When you’re giving to a hospital, it’s nice to put a little note in there to show your appreciation to the people on the front lines,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;When I do the drop-offs, these people say how great it is to know that people on the outside are thinking of them. It’s practical but it’s also something special.&rdquo;</p>
