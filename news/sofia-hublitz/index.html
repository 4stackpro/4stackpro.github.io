<p>The Byrde Family on Ozark is not the perfect picture of domestic bliss by any stretch of the imagination. While Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) had good intentions in wanting to help his family financially, getting involved with a money-laundering scheme only put him deeper into trouble. Also, it never helped that his daughter, Charlotte (Sofia Hublitz), was a bit insufferable.</p>
<p>Yes, Charlotte became such a troubled teen in the first two seasons, viewers started to complain. Even though she reflected how some teens are in real life, the Byrdes are already far from normal. At the start of Ozark’s third season, Charlotte suddenly became more tolerable. What caused this sudden change? It seemed to be from parental understanding.</p>
<p>OZARK | Netflix</p>
<p>Charlotte Byrde’s initial reaction to moving to the Ozarks</p>
<p>At the beginning of Ozark’s run, Marty Byrde ran into trouble with a drug cartel while involved in money laundering. He promises to keep doing money laundering for them in exchange to spare him and his family’s lives. This required moving from Chicago to the Ozarks in Missouri.</p>
<p>Of course, this set up a new fish out of water scenario, making Ozark a little like a cross between Schitt’s Creek and Breaking Bad. What makes it all work is the great cast and the dynamics among the characters. Despite the Byrdes not being completely lovable, fans root them on to find some kind of sanity and eventual familial bliss.</p>
<p>Having to put up with Charlotte, however, was a bit of a problem. Then again, if placed in her shoes, perhaps viewers would never blame her for complaining about having to live in an unusual place.</p>
<p>Charlotte slowly makes a friend while working at The Blue Cat</p>
<p>RELATED: ‘Ozark’ Fans Think The Women of the Series Are Terrifying</p>
<p>Fans of Ozark know Charlotte always wanted to stay in Chicago to be with her friends. While her complaints from the outset seemed annoying, she finally found a friend when landing a job at The Blue Cat, a fleabag hotel with a restaurant and bar.</p>
<p>As Charlotte worked there, she managed to become friends with Wyatt Langmore. This ultimately becomes her only real close friend in Osage Beach. Over time, though, she starts to understand the truth about behind-the-scenes doings in the family business. Her evolution to putting the pieces together makes her start to become slowly entwined into the activities of her father and mother.</p>
<p>If still considering her situation crazy, the real change viewers have seen from Charlotte is her finding some peace in what her family is doing. Part of this comes from Charlotte helping find some kind of light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>The Byrde kids start to become involved in the money laundering business</p>
<p>Meet Charlotte Byrde: Social butterfly. Misguided teen. Boat thief. #Ozark, now streaming on Netflix. pic.twitter.com/AYaDDgeKQf — Netflix UK &amp; Ireland (@NetflixUK) July 26, 2017</p>
<p>By the beginning of the third season, Charlotte started to learn what her parents were doing is dangerous business. It finally hit her the money laundering scheme underway was a do-or-die situation. As such, Charlotte suddenly found herself getting involved in criminal tasks to make it become a true family business.</p>
<p>Another layer to this evolution is her younger brother, Jonah (played by Skylar Gaertner), becoming involved as well. Placing them into doing the dirty deeds of money laundering really does sober up these characters. Throughout Season 3, Charlotte is definitely less insufferable than before, and now a serious extortionist. Media outlets like Looper also remind that Charlotte was seen taking down some victims in the process of making sure each plan occurred without consequence.</p>
<p>No teens should get any ideas from this, obviously. Regardless, having Charlotte being forced to grow up this fast into crime is one of the most complex character studies on TV for a teenage/young adult role. How Charlotte comes to terms with this as an adult is another thing everyone may learn eventually.

<h3 id="ozark-season-4-expected-release-date-and-recent-updates">&ldquo;‘Ozark’ Season 4 expected release date and recent updates&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://summary.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ozark-season-3-details.jpg" alt="img">
Ozark is a strong contender to become one of Netflix’s best. The story revolves around the Byrde family who features parental figures in Marty and Wendy and their 2 teenage children in Charlotte and Jonah. They were living a completely normal life, not until they were relocated to a completely different place. From the suburbs of the city of Chicago to a small community in Ozarks, Missouri. The series has the family being involved in the planet of the Mexican drug cartel.</p>
<p>Created by the great Bill Dubuque, the drama series from Netflix stars Jason Bateman as Marty Byrde, Laura Linney as Wendy Byrde, Sofia Hublitz as their teenage daughter, and Skylar Gaertner as their teenage son. They are who make up the Byrde family. Alongside Dubuque are executive producers Jason Bateman, Mark Williams, and Duque himself with Media Rights Capital as their production house.</p>
<p>People are in love with the show, taking it to Twitter how it was wonderfully made and binge-able––something we’re all looking for these days. However, there is no news about its fourth season just yet. On the 31st of August 2018, the second season of the show aired while the third season aired on the 27th of March 2020. Unfortunately, the show is but only 2 months old now and with the current situation––it’s difficult to talk renewal status. Normally, it would take Netflix around 1 to 2 months before they officially announce the comeuppance of a renewal, but things are obviously moving slower than expected because of the current coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>I almost never watch tv, but I’m currently helplessly addicted to a show called Ozark. It’s so incredibly well written, acted, casted, &amp; directed. — Happy Chichester (@HappyChichester) June 12, 2020</p>
<p>Y’all wasn’t lying about Ozark being hella bingable….shew — Jacob Roland (@JRolNation) June 15, 2020</p>
<p>If things do sail smoothly and Ozark gets to bag its fourth season, then we can expect it around April of 2021.</p>
<p>No official dates have been released yet, though. There is still an alarming number of cases in the world that we should first take notice of. For now, all we can really do is hope for the best.

<p><img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Ozark-Season-3-1.jpg" alt="img">
The Netflix crime drama, Ozark, continues to keep audiences on the edge of their seat throughout season 3. The series had the most massive viewership ever with the launch of its third season on March 27, 2020.</p>
<p>With so many new fans to talk about the show with, viewers are discussing the Byrde family character development. They found that there is one character who changed more than any of the others throughout the three seasons.</p>
<p>The Byrde family in ‘Ozark’ Season 3 | STEVE DIETL/NETFLIX</p>
<p>‘Ozark’: The Byrde family roles mostly remain the same throughout the 3 seasons</p>
<p>Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) moves his entire family to the Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri after a money-laundering scheme goes wrong. He promises to begin a more extensive business to launder more money for the Mexican drug cartel. Marty makes meticulous decisions to attempt to keep his family out of harm’s way. Some say his lack of emotional intelligence might be his downfall, while other fans believe that’s how he can deal with the cartel.</p>
<p>Marty’s wife, Wendy (Laura Linney), jumps right into the family business of crime. She is more forward with her dealings with the Mexican drug cartel — going straight to Omar Navarro (Felix Solis). Wendy has no problem ordering enemies killed or getting in deeper with the cartel.</p>
<p>RELATED: Is ‘Ozark’ The New’ Breaking Bad’?</p>
<p>Wendy and Marty’s son, Jonah (Skylar Gaertner), is very intrigued by the family business and immediately shows his father how he can be useful. Early on in the series, Buddy (Harris Yulin) teaches Jonah how to use a rifle. Jonah is not afraid of using a gun or dealing with the cartel.</p>
<p>Whereas their daughter, Charlotte (Sofia Hublitz), is adamantly against the life of crime in the Ozarks in season 1, but she changes significantly by the end of season 3.</p>
<p>Fans believe that Charlotte Byrde changes the most throughout the 3 seasons of ‘Ozark’</p>
<p>“Charlotte is like the walking barometer for the family,” one fan wrote on Reddit. “She goes from naive to rejecting the cartel life to complacent to actively participating. The deeper they get involved, the more corrupt she becomes.”</p>
<p>Many fans agree that Charlotte grows and changes as the family falls in deeper with the cartel. While the other family members mostly stay the same, she doesn’t.</p>

<p>“In season 1 and 2, I agree she’s bratty, reckless, rebellious, and ignorant concerning the situation they’re in,” one Redditor wrote. “In season 3, she becomes more part of the unit and less bratty.”</p>
<p>Charlotte Byrde might take Ruth Langmore’s job in ‘Ozark’ Season 4</p>
<p>The end of season 3 finds Ruth at Darlene Snell’s (Lisa Emery) door, where her cousin Wyatt (Charlie Tahan) is staying. She’s fed up with the Byrdes and ready to begin her own empire. Now they need someone new to take on Ruth’s duties. Fans believe this person will be Charlotte.</p>
<p>“[Charlotte] is now a willing participant in her parents’ work,” added another fan. “She understands the stakes. I think Helen’s daughter was brought into season three to show how much Charlotte had changed.”</p>
<p>With how much Charlotte has grown, fans see her stepping up to take on the responsibilities that Ruth had in the money laundering business. We will find out if they are right when Ozark returns for Season 4.</p>

<h3 id="ozark-the-secret-behind-the-rare-but-intentional-smiles-from-each-character">&ldquo;‘Ozark’: The Secret Behind the Rare But Intentional Smiles From Each Character&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Laura-Linney.jpg" alt="img">
Jason Bateman, Laura Linney, and Julia Garner are back for Ozark Season 3. It’s as dark as ever, with two more significant deaths. It’s not surprising that the characters have little to smile about in their daily life as part of a money-laundering scheme for the Mexican drug cartel. However, the rare, but intentional smiles do happen — each for a specific reason.</p>
<p>Laura Linney as Wendy Byrde on ‘Ozark’ | STEVE DIETL/NETFLIX</p>
<p>‘Ozark’: Does Jason Bateman’s character — Marty Byrde — ever smile?</p>
<p>Over the past three seasons of Ozark, fans caught Marty genuinely smiling only one time. During the Ozark Season 1 finale, Marty jumps up off of his trampoline when he hears his family come home. Charlotte (Sofia Hublitz) and Jonah (Skylar Gaertner) run into their father’s arms, and the three embrace in a hug.</p>
<p>Over the kids’ heads, Marty looks at his wife, Wendy (Linney), and gives her a tiny but genuine smile. He shows his teeth a bit in a very awkward faint smile. He’s happy to see his family but worried about them at the same time for staying wrapped up in his dealings with the Cartel and now the Snells.</p>
<p>RELATED: Is ‘Ozark’ The New’ Breaking Bad’?</p>
<p>“They all have very little to be happy about in this show,” one fan wrote on Reddit. “Marty has the same stressed-out face 95% of the series.”</p>
<p>Are all of the smiles in ‘Ozark’ intentional?</p>
<p>When Wendy smiles, it’s often more of a smirk. Many fans believe she only smiles when she is lying. However, she is lying rather often, so that makes sense.</p>
<p>Ruth (Garner), on the other hand, only smiles when she is with her love interest, Ben Davis (Tom Pelphrey), or her cousin, Wyatt Langmore (Charlie Tahan). She has an intense scowl on her face if she is not with either of those men in season 3.</p>
<p>RELATED: ‘Ozark’s Julia Garner Will Never Star in a Teen Movie</p>
<p>“I noticed the show seems to be intentional about which characters smile and what that means,” wrote another Redditor. “Season two ends on a photographer saying ‘smile,’ (none of them do), and season three ends on what can be assumed as Navarro’s smile.”</p>
<p>Fans want to know if these few smiles are an “acting choice? Director’s choice? Nothing beyond a general grim aesthetic?”</p>
<p>Jason Bateman weighs in on how he directs the actors in ‘Ozark’</p>
<p>“I try to kind of let them in on what the directing perspective is, with respect to the camera,” Bateman said in an interview with Collider. “I’ll try to really give them a good sense of what the camera is seeing so that they are assured that the camera is watching. That the camera can see what they’re doing, that they need not throw to the back row, that the camera is the front row. That’s as far as you need to send your communication.”</p>
<p>RELATED: ‘Ozark’: Jason Bateman Did Not Prepare for His Role as Marty Byrde</p>
<p>Bateman is a fan of subtle acting, so if the smiles are intentional, he doesn’t admit it. It sounds like they come with the general aesthetic of a very dark show.</p>
<p>“It keeps people small, just assuring them you don’t need to do a lot of acting, you just need to do a lot of thinking, and the camera has an ability to kind of reach your mind,” Bateman continued. “If they trust it, things end up coming across in a pretty subtle way, which is my personal taste.”</p>
<p>There are not many happy moments in Ozark, so it’s not surprising that there are few smiles. It sounds like the director wants the actors to feel their characters on a deeper level. As for the smiles at the end of each season, we will have to wait and see if season 4 adds another level to that theory.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Julia-Garner-as-Ruth.jpg" alt="img">
Netflix’s critically acclaimed crime drama, Ozark, returned for season 3 on March 27, 2020. It’s almost two months later, and fans are still contemplating what season 4 of the series will bring. Marty (Jason Bateman) and Wendy Byrde (Laura Linney) are as deep as ever with the Mexican drug cartel.</p>
<p>However, where Ruth Langmore (Julia Garner) stands with the Byrdes in Ozark is a different story. Will someone need to take her place in the family’s money-laundering scheme? If so, who is the most likely character to fill her massive role?</p>

<p>‘Ozark’ Season 3: What happened between Ruth and the Byrdes?</p>
<p>In Ozark Season 3, Ruth emphasized that she was “untouchable.” However, she was brutally beaten by Frank Cosgrove Jr. (Joseph Sikora) from the Kansas City Mafia. When she insisted that Marty and Wendy fire back at the Mafia by killing Frank Jr., they did nothing more than cut ties.</p>
<p>As if she wasn’t angry enough about Frank Jr. still being alive, the cartel’s hitman kills Ruth’s one love interest. Wendy’s brother, Ben Davis (Tom Pelphrey), begins to interfere in the Byrdes’ livelihood by showing up at a fundraiser event, screaming about what awful people they are. Wendy tries to get him to safety, but in the end, she gives up and shows her loyalty to the Mexican drug cartel instead by letting them kill her brother.</p>

<p>The end of the season finds Ruth at Darlene Snell’s (Lisa Emery) door, where her cousin Wyatt (Charlie Tahan) is staying. She’s fed up with the Byrdes and ready to begin her empire.</p>
<p>What happens to the Byrdes without Ruth Langmore in ‘Ozark’?</p>
<p>“Well, if we’re lucky enough to get a season 4,” Mundy told Entertainment Weekly. “I think it will be about whether or not Ruth really can create something of her own that she wants and is sustainable, or if she wants something else.”</p>
<p>Ruth is not leaving the show — she’s only moving on without the Byrdes.</p>

<p>“I could see her playing a double agent next season,” one fan wrote on Reddit regarding Ruth.</p>
<p>Since Ruth ran so much of the Byrdes casino business, there is a massive hole in their corporation.</p>
<p>Fans believe Charlotte Byrde will fill Ruth Langmore’s shoes in ‘Ozark’ Season 4</p>
<p>Charlotte (Sofia Hublitz) is Marty and Wendy’s eldest child. She was against the family’s move to the Ozarks, Missouri, from day one. However, as time goes on, she becomes more and more involved.</p>
<p>“Charlotte is important because she starts in season 1 rejecting their new life in the Ozarks, and by season 3 has fully accepted it,” wrote one Redditor. “She is now a willing participant in her parents’ work. She understands the stakes. I think Helen’s daughter was brought into season 3 to show how much Charlotte had changed.”</p>
<p>Fans see her stepping up to take on the responsibilities that Ruth had in the family business. We will find out if they are right when Ozark returns for Season 4.</p>
