<p>recently went back to the canvas and, with a few strokes of charcoal, created a piece of art. Now, Tara Sutaria has also gone back to the drawing board. After oohing and aahing over the sunset since the last few days, the ‚Äòstudent‚Äô put pencil‚Ä¶ err, charcoal‚Ä¶ to paper and sketched the face of a woman who featured regularly in her earlier sketches.

The milestone is marked by taking the baby out of the house and to the temple for the first time but with that option out of the window thanks to the lockdown, the actress turned pandit herself and performed the ritual with her at home. The two then posed pretty with businessman-husbandand son, Viaan, and Shilpa posted it with a note of gratitude for having a healthy family by her side.

In the clip, Farah stated that while she understood that these ‚Äúcelebs‚Äù and ‚Äústars‚Äù are privileged and have no other worry other than looking after their figures even during a pandemic, since most of the aam janta have bigger concerns, they can do away with offering fitness tips.
