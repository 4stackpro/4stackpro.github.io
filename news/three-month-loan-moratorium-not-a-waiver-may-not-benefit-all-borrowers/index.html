Opposed to prima facie benefits of the three-month loan moratorium announced by RBI in the wake of coronavirus pandemic, finer details reveal its various limitations</p>
<p>March 27, 2020 5 min read</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re reading Entrepreneur India, an international franchise of Entrepreneur Media.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on 27 March announced a slew of fiscal measures to fight the economic fallout of coronavirus or covid-19 virus.</p>
<p>In one of the measures, what is being hailed as a major relief to borrowers, all banks and non-banking lenders have been permitted to allow a three month moratorium on term and working capital loans. Term loans include all types of retail loans—home, car, personal, education, gold—as well as credit card bill payment. To top it up, the central bank has assured that availing this moratorium will not lead to downgrade in the borrower’s credit score or affect the risk classification of the loan.</p>
<p>Essentially, borrowers, both retail and businesses, will have the option to not pay loan EMIs for the next three months, starting 1 March, without having to worry about the lender slapping a penalty on payment default or their credit score being downgraded.</p>
<p>Industry experts have unanimously welcomed the move. “Moratorium will cover everyone, from retail borrowers to small and big entrepreneurs. Considering the present uncertain situation, RBI has supported all stakeholders of the economy,” says Jaikishan Parmar, senior equity research analyst, Angel Broking.</p>
<p>Some experts say this move may impact lenders. “Though, there is no other possible solution visible under the effect of Covid-19, moratorium on term loans may have an adverse impact on the cash flow levels of banks and small NBFCs,” says Bhavin Patel, CEO and Founder, LenDenClub, a P2P lending platform.</p>
<p>Loan Repayment Deferred Not Waived</p>
<p>Take note that the moratorium is not to be misconstrued as a loan waiver or payment holiday of three months. Interest rate on the skipped installments will be accrued and added to the outstanding principle. Moreover, your payment tenure will increase by the number of months that you skip.</p>
<p>“The repayment schedule and all subsequent due dates, as also the tenor for such loans, may be shifted across the board by three months. Interest shall continue to accrue on the outstanding portion of the term loans during the moratorium period,” said the RBI statement.</p>
<p>Kunal Varma, chief business officer and co-founder, MoneyTap says the moratorium doesn’t come for free to consumers. &ldquo;Interest will get accrued during this period, which the customers will need to pay along with their resumed payments from June onwards. That’s a small price to pay for getting this immediate relief,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>Essentially, it is just loan payment deferment to ease the burden of EMI payments on borrowers whose incomes might have been disrupted due to the countrywide lockdown, ending on 14 April. “The moratorium/deferment is being provided specifically to enable the borrowers to tide over the economic fallout from COVID-19,” said the RBI.</p>
<p>The Devil is in Details</p>
<p>Further, it is not a blanket benefit that will be passed to all borrowers. Instead, the decision to allow the three-month moratorium window will lie with individual banks. “Lending institutions shall frame board approved policies for providing the above-mentioned (loan payment deferment) reliefs to all eligible borrowers,” the RBI stated.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is no clarity on whether a bank will allow moratorium to all its borrowers or evaluate passing it on case to case basis. Entrepreneur India wrote to two banks seeking clarity on the finer details but did not get a response till the time of filing the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For banks and NBFCs, there’s a lot of work involved in implementing this. Starting with alignment of repayment schedules, accounting changes, provisioning schedule changes, reporting changes and all of that finally going through a board approval before implementing the policy on an urgent basis,&rdquo; says Varma.</p>
<p>Borrowers willing to avail the moratorium should approach their banks to check their eligibility. Also, the moratorium has been made effective from 1 March and will last till 31 May. So, effectively, borrowers will get a two-month relief, unless their installments for March have still not been paid. If March payment defaulted because of non-availability of funds in the bank account, it will be covered under moratorium period and no penalty will be charged.</p>
<p>Should You Opt For it?</p>
<p>Financial advisors say this is a relief for households whose income streams have been disrupted due to the lockdown. “This move will tremendously help those who may have lost their job, are facing a pay cut or small entrepreneurs whose incomes have stopped,” says Rohit Shah, founder and CEO, Getting You Rich. “This will free up cash flows for possible medical or other emergencies.”</p>
<p>However, borrowers whose incomes have not been disrupted or despite earning disruption can still manage to pay EMIs should not opt for moratorium. This is because not only will the loan tenure extend but the accrued interest will make the loan costlier.</p>
<p>Additionally, Shah says that those opting for the moratorium should do so only to ensure liquidity for emergencies. “The money freed up by deferring loan repayment should not be used for investing, especially to buy stocks just because they are cheaper,” he says.

<h3 id="morrison-government-announces-six-month-moratorium-on-rental-evictions">Morrison Government announces six-month moratorium on rental evictions</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.savings.com.au/dA/3745b55aea/rentlaws.jpg" alt="img">

<p>The Prime Minister announced a six-month moratorium on residential and commercial evictions on Sunday night.</p>
<p>The announcement, made in conjunction with state leaders, would prevent landlords from evicting tenants if they are unable to pay rent due to financial distress as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Scott Morrison said communication between landlords, tenants and banks was key, with all parties needing to work cooperatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will be working on measures that will be encouraging you to do just that and to support you to do just that, but also to ensure that if you aren&rsquo;t going to engage in that sort of cooperative activity between banks, between tenants and between landlords, then the sort of support that you might otherwise expect to receive, you will not receive,&rdquo; Mr Morrison said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is part of the hibernation approach where we want people bespoke, customised to their own circumstances to sit down and work these things out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no rulebook for this. We are in uncharted territory, but the goal should be shared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tenants and landlords who haven&rsquo;t been caused financial distress by the pandemic are still expected to honour the leases and rental agreements.</p>
<p>Banks are expected to help carry the load by deferring mortgage repayments to home-owners, investment property landlords, and small to medium businesses, for six months.</p>
<p>Mr Morrison reinforced his message that these measures would likely run for that long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re asking businesses to adapt to what is not a usual set of circumstances,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must be sustainable because they will run for, we believe, at least six months and we want to be able to get everybody through. So we are seeking their support.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg is expected to announce further support for businesses in the coming days, in the form of a $1,500 wage subsidy.</p>
<p>The individual states are also expected to announce more details regarding tenancy agreements early this week.</p>
<p>While the hospitality industry has been essentially shut down, the retail industry isn&rsquo;t faring much better.</p>
<p>Some big names that have announced temporary store closures include Myer, Country Road, Peter Alexander, Cotton On, and Michael Hill.</p>
<p>Real estate groups condemns lack of detail</p>
<p>Real Estate Institute of Queensland (REIQ) CEO Antonia Mercorella said while it supported a no eviction policy, the lack of details was causing anxiety amongst landlords and tenants alike.</p>
<p>“What we need is urgent action with clear directives right now for both commercial and residential tenants because there are far too many unanswered questions both businesses and people are still anxiously awaiting clarity on,” Ms Mercorella said.</p>
<p>“The REIQ supports protective measures on evictions provided it is limited to cases where the full amount of rent is not able to be paid due to a result of the coronavirus (COVID-19).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms Mercorella said for property owners, it&rsquo;s not just a matter of pressing pause on mortgage repayments for six months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many mum and dad investors can barely cover the various costs associated with owning an investment property even with rent coming in so may not have any other choice but to sell their properties,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It puts many at risk of bankruptcy. Consideration also needs to be given to those self-funded retirees whose only source of income is derived from an investment property.”</p>
<p>Ms Mercorella added that it wouldn&rsquo;t be possible for tenants and landlords to communicate unless real estate professionals were classed as essential.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is why it’s so critical that the role of real estate professionals are endorsed an essential service so we are able to achieve what the Prime Minister is asking for – for property owners and tenants ‘to sit down and come up with arrangements that enable them to get through this crisis.</p>
<p>“This is where the role of real estate professionals are needed more than ever as most tenants don’t negotiate directly with property owners.”</p>
<p>President of the Real Estate Institute of Australia, Adrian Kelly, echoed Ms Mercorella&rsquo;s sentiments, and said the Prime Minister&rsquo;s message raises more questions than it answers.</p>
<p>“Real estate agents are the middle persons who facilitate the agreement between landlords and tenants and manage it as well as the property,&rdquo; Mr Kelly said.</p>
<p>“There are some 70,000 property managers, principals, real estate agents and representatives across Australia. Tenants don’t negotiate with landlords.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“We need to address the support of agents so that what the Prime Minister wants, in terms of landlords and tenants - finding a solution to get through the crisis, can be achieved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How will the changes affect rent prices?</p>
<p>Domain Senior Research Analyst Nicola Powell told Savings.com.au that the current economc climate could see rents decrease in the short term.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think in terms of the rental market, I think what we&rsquo;re likely to see is that tenants will find that they have greater negotiating power because I think those landlords that have had a short term lease, will be opting for long term leases now,&rdquo; Ms Powell said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we will see an increase in rental listings and that will help to decrease rental prices, which obviously goes in the favour of tenants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Propertyology Head of Research, Simon Pressley told Savings.com.au that placing financial stress on landlords could see rents increase over the coming years.</p>
<p>“Communities need to remember that there’s just as much potential for the personal income of a landlord to be unsettled by the repercussions of this virus as there is a tenant, Mr Pressley said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Covid-19 does not discriminate. Over recent years, landlords have already been dealt a series of blows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they aren’t afforded the sensitivity that they deserve now, there’s a real risk of landlords getting out of the market which will cause a reduction in rental supply and higher rents in coming years.”</p>

<h3 id="rbi-moratorium-not-a-relief-pay-emis-and-credit-card-dues-if-you-can">RBI moratorium not a relief, pay EMIs and credit card dues if you can</h3>
<p><img src="https://entrackr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/RBI.jpg" alt="img">
The three-month moratorium allowed by the Reserve Bank of India on EMI repayments seemed to be a relief for those who had been demanding a deferment due to the lockdown. But in reality, that’s not the case.</p>
<p>Moratorium provides no relief to your EMIs and credit card’s outstanding payments cycle. For example, if you have to pay Rs 100,000 as an EMI for a home loan or credit card bill on April 5 and you chose not to pay. Then you will be charged an applicable monthly interest rate.</p>
<p>In case, you don’t pay the EMI in May as well, you will be charged interest on the principal plus interest amount for April. Clearly, the RBI’s announcement on deferment of such payments for the next three months means nothing.</p>
<p>If you choose not to pay your EMIs and credit card minimum outstanding balance between 1st March 2020 to 31st May 2020 and pay the accumulated interest before the given deadline, then you won’t be treated as a defaulter. Another upside from this moratorium is that non-payments of the aforementioned payments won’t impact your credit score.</p>
<p>According to industry estimates, credit card companies charge a compound annual interest rate of anywhere between 36% to 42%.</p>
<p>Moreover, credit card interest gets charged an additional 18% GST.</p>
<p>The impact of the credit card non-payment was also highlighted by Kunal Shah, founder and CEO of Cred, who asked credit card users to try to pay full amount due as there is no escape from the interest during this period.</p>
<p>Commenting on the matter, Nithin Kamath, CEO of Zerodha, has also suggested clearing credit card dues as soon as possible as banks will continue to charge the usual interest rate.</p>
<p>On Friday, RBI had allowed all commercial banks (including non-banking financial companies or NBFCs -housing finance companies and micro-finance institutions) and lending institutions to defer EMI repayment and interest on working capital repayments by three months.
