<p>The Alberta government is exempting a portion of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit for some social assistance recipients amid fears applying for the federal cash infusion could make them ineligible for other provincial benefits.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Community and Social Services Minister Rajan Sawhney announced a series of supports for vulnerable Albertans, including those on Income Support and Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped (AISH).</p>

<p>“I know Albertans who receive benefits through AISH or Income Support want to apply for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) to recoup some of their lost income, but they are concerned accessing CERB may affect their eligibility for provincial benefits,” Sawhney said.</p>
<p>“That’s why we are taking action to exempt a portion of CERB payments so the financial benefit from AISH and Income Support can be calculated similar to before they lost their job and they can still receive the same health benefits.”

<h3 id="a-third-of-workforce-has-applied-for-cerb-officials-say-as-mps-question-minister-on-coverage-gaps">A third of workforce has applied for CERB, officials say, as MPs question minister on coverage gaps</h3>
<p><img src="https://ipolitics.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Nov.2808152-e1587759185561.jpg" alt="img">
Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough faced questioning from opposition MPs on Friday on helping expecting mothers, temporary foreign workers and single parents no longer receiving support payments access the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB).</p>
<p>Government officials also told MPs at a virtual meeting of the House of Commons committee on human resources, skills and social development and status of persons with disabilities that more than one-third of the Canadian workforce has applied for the $2,000-a-month CERB to date.</p>
<p>READ MORE: 1.4 million jobless Canadians don’t qualify for the CERB or EI, analysis finds</p>
<p>Conservative MP Dan Albas asked Qualtrough about expecting parents who have been told by Service Canada representatives that they can’t access the CERB and should instead apply for early parental leave.</p>
<p>He also noted a question in the application for employment insurance — which many Canadians applied for before the CERB went online — that asks if they are pregnant.</p>
<p>The Canadian Press reported that some expecting mothers who applied for EI in mid-March have not had their application moved over to the CERB because they had said they were pregnant.</p>
<p>Qualtrough said pregnancy does not impact eligibility for the CERB, even if expecting parents anticipate starting maternity benefits soon. Canadians cannot receive any EI benefits at the same time as the CERB.</p>
<p>“We asked that question so that we can anticipate from a back-end system point of view, if somebody is going to be moved on to a different benefit stream, but that does not in any way. impact their eligibility for all of these benefits,” she said.</p>
<p>When Albas noted that expecting mothers have been told to start maternity benefits now instead of claiming the CERB, Qualtrough said “that should not be the case and you have my commitment to make sure that isn’t the case.” She had noted there were “systemic challenges” in the rollout of the benefit that are being examined now.</p>
<p>Prior to Qualtrough’s appearance, Employment and Social Development Canada deputy minister Graham Flack said 7.12 million Canadians have applied for the CERB as of last night.</p>
<p>Flack said that equals more than one-third of the country’s labour force, which totalled 20 million prior to the COVID-19 crisis. A sum of $22.4 billion has been paid out to Canadians to date.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, NDP MP Jenny Kwan said there are single parents ineligible for the CERB who are no longer receiving spousal or child support payments because ex-partners’ income has been affected by COVID-19.</p>
<p>“This leaves single parents scrambling without funds,” she said.</p>
<p>Qualtrough said while such spousal or child support payments aren’t technically considered employment income, single mothers “is something I’m turning my mind to because of the particular vulnerabilities of this group.”</p>
<p>The minister also said she is working with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada to better process updating social insurance numbers for temporary foreign workers.</p>
<p>Kwan had noted that some work permits have expired due to COVID-19 but workers are facing backlogs at the department that leave them without the documentation needed to apply for the CERB.</p>
<p>READ MORE: CERB eligibility expanded to part-time and seasonal workers, Trudeau says</p>
<p>Albas was also critical of what he described as a lack of clarity on the specifics of CERB eligibility, pointing to government ministers who had said seasonal workers were eligible for the CERB but neglected to mention it applies only to such workers who have exhausted their EI benefits.</p>
<p>“Now this covers many seasonal workers but I’ve heard from countless seasonal workers who are not eligible but believe they are CERB-eligible,” he said.</p>
<p>Albas also noted that ministers have said students were eligible so as long as they made $5,000 in the last year without mentioning that losing work due to COVID-19 was another requirement.</p>
<p>Qualtrough said those who applied for the CERB “in good faith, there’s no significant consequence, except they may be asked at some point to pay that money back.”</p>
<p>Flack said the goal is to launch the new $1,250 Canada Emergency Student Benefit by mid-May. He said 43 per cent of Canadian students — more than two million in total — were working in February and had earned $5,000 in income in the last year.</p>
<p>READ MORE: Trudeau announces $9B to support students — including a new $1,250 benefit</p>
<p>Conservative MP Raquel Dancho had raised concerns that many students have waited for several weeks without any form of government income support.</p>
<p>Qualtrough also told the committee that legal advice received from Justice Canada suggested changes for CERB eligibility allowing some who have not stopped working to claim the benefit would not need new legislation “through a broad interpretation of the law.”

<p>CERB elgibility with two part-time jobs</p>
<p>Tim in Kingston, Ont.:</p>
<p>I am a healthcare provider with two part-time jobs. One is a salaried position where I continue to receive income of more than $1,000 per month. The second part-time job is fee for services, where income has been decreased by 90 per cent. Each job contributes approximately 50 per cent of my total income.</p>
<p>This drop in income is affecting my ability to meet fixed costs, debt maintenance and support for my family.</p>
<p>I’ve been following the ongoing changes to [Canada Emergency Response Benefit] CERB eligibility and other government programs but don’t believe any of them apply to me.</p>
<p>Am I correct or missing something? Help! (April 18, 2020)</p>
<p>Jessica Moorhouse, financial counsellor and personal finance blogger for JessicaMoorhouse.com:</p>
<p>CERB eligibility for part-time healthcare workers Jessica Moorhouse, financial counsellor and personal finance blogger for JessicaMoorhouse.com, explains if part-time healthcare workers can apply for the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit.</p>
<p>So if you find yourself in a situation where normally your employment income is made up of two different part-time jobs - one of them has been affected by COVID-19 so you’re not earning anything from that job; and the other one you’re still working at, however you’re earning more than that $1,000 – well, unfortunately you will not be eligible for the CERB because even though they’ve made it more flexible so it does include more people now, you cannot earn over $1,000 to be eligible.</p>
<p>So, you may be wondering, ‘if I can’t get CERB what can I do to pay my bills and to survive during this trying time?’. Here’s a few suggestions:</p>
<p>So number one, if you are dealing with debt this is absolutely the time to talk to your different lenders, different financial institutions to see if they have any kind of different relief programs. I’ve been seeing a lot of different banks and credit card companies offering some sort of relief, either lowering interest rates or offering deferral programs.</p>
<p>Another thing you can do is - and I know this may not sound super fun - file your taxes, especially, most especially if you were expecting a tax refund. So file your taxes, get that tax refund, that money can go towards savings or paying your bills or your debts.</p>
<p>And lastly - I know this probably sounds annoying and you’re sick of hearing it - but this is a great time to make a budget and see what costs are happening right now, where’s your money going and seeing if there’s any way you can cut costs, even temporarily. Remember this does not have to be permanent but maybe getting rid of some subscriptions, some of those things you would normally buy, to make your cost of living as low as possible so you can afford to pay your work bills. (April 22, 2020)</p>
<p>GIC interest and CERB eligibility</p>
<p>Liz in Oakville, Ont.:</p>
<p>I understand dividend income qualifies for CERB. Does Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GIC) interest count as income? It&rsquo;s my only source of income and my GICs will crash and burn this year and the next several years. I made more than $5,000 in interest income last year. (April 19, 2020)</p>
<p>Marlena Pospiech, director of wealth planning at National Bank Private Banking 1859:</p>
<p>No, unfortunately GIC interest income would not qualify for purposes of the CERB benefit eligibility rules. Eligible income is limited to employment (e.g. salary) and self-employment income (e.g. salary or non-eligible dividend income paid to an incorporated business owner or professional from corporate income taxed at the small business rate). (April 23, 2020)</p>
<p>Financial relief for teachers</p>
<p>Kevin in Langley, B.C.:</p>
<p>Would a teacher, permanent or not, who normally gets a summer job to supplement income, qualify for benefits if no summer employment is available? They may still be on the teaching payroll for the summer (as some take their pay over 12 months) or they may not (paid over 10 months). As well, they will likely not have a Record of Employment (ROE) from the previous summer. (April 18, 2020)</p>
<p>Robyn Thompson, personal finance expert and president of Castlemark Wealth Management Inc.:</p>
<p>Financial relief for teachers amid COVID-19 Robyn Thompson, personal finance expert and president of Castlemark Wealth Management Inc., answers viewer questions in regards to teachers applying for CERB amid COVID-19.</p>
<p>This teacher will not qualify for the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit or CERB if they continue to be employed as a teacher and receive more than $1,000 a month from their employer as employment income.</p>
<p>The CERB has been specifically designed to help those Canadians who have lost their job to no fault of their own because of COVID-19 or COVID-19-related issues. You must have also had $5,000 in income in the previous calendar year or in the 12 months leading up to your CERB application.</p>
<p>This is also not a forward-looking benefit which means it’s not going to pair to benefit based on potential future job losses or unavailability of jobs. For your eligibility check <a href="http://www.canada.ca">www.canada.ca</a>. (April 22, 2020)</p>
<p>Are my saving deposits safe?</p>
<p>Loraine in Vancouver, B.C.:</p>
<p>I am a U.S. citizen and permanent resident of Canada. I have savings deposits in a Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC)-insured Canadian bank (TD Bank) and a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured U.S. bank (Santander). Both amounts are within the insurance limit in each country.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if my money is really safe in both places? Is one economy more likely to lead to bank failures than the other? Is there any chance CDIC or FDIC could run out of money? Is there a safer option for one&rsquo;s savings at a time of economic crisis? (April 22, 2020)</p>
<p>Jamie Golombek, managing director of tax and estate planning at CIBC Wealth Advisory Service:</p>
<p>What to do if your savings accounts are in different countries amid COVID-19 Jamie Golombek, managing director of tax and estate planning at CIBC Wealth Advisory Service, discusses a viewer&rsquo;s question on whether their savings deposits are safe in two different countries.</p>
<p>Both Canada and the United States have deposit insurance. In the U.S., the FDIC typically will insure up to $250,000 per owner; in Canada, CDIC typically $100,000 per account type and you can get all the details on what’s covered on the various websites for FDIC and CDIC.</p>
<p>In terms of the risk - ultimately if a bank fails and CDIC or FDIC not being able to pay out - I think the risk is zero or at least very close to zero. The reason I say that is at the end of the day governments have the ability to print money.</p>
<p>So at the end of the day they can print money to honour those commitments and I think the real risk there of course is that you get into the situation where if the government is printing money, ultimately obviously the value of that currency could decline in terms of purchasing power because of hyper-inflation.</p>
<p>We saw an example of that certainly in Zimbabwe. And the other risk of course is ultimate sovereign failure, so we saw that example years ago with Russia.</p>
<p>But ultimately, I mean unless the entire government collapses and governments cannot honour any commitments, I think relying on the limits in both CDIC and FDIC are reasonable. (April 23, 2020)</p>
<p>Financial relief for small businesses</p>
<p>Bryan in Burlington, Ont:</p>
<p>Is there any relief for very small businesses with small payroll, under $20,000? I am semi-retired and using personal equity and pension income to pay myself. I am paying down a line-of-credit loan and it would be great if we had at least a little interest relief. (April 21, 2020)</p>
<p>Filomena May, financial advisor at Filo Financial Solutions of Raymond James Ltd.:</p>
<p>Depending on your circumstances as a business owner, you may qualify for the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) loan of $40,000 at zero per cent, and 25 per cent of the loan is forgiven if the loan is paid back under the terms provided. The minimum payroll amount to qualify is $20,000.</p>
<p>Another option for the self-employed is the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) if you earned a minimum of $5,000 before taxes in the last 12 months and don’t expect to earn monthly income (under $1,000 per month) due to COVID-19. If you qualify for the loan it could provide some interest relief by moving the higher-interest debt you carry to the CEBA loan.</p>
<p>Requesting a deferral of payments on the existing loan to reduce the financial strain temporarily also helps.</p>
<p>Best to apply through &ldquo;My Accounts&rdquo; on CRA and review the full criteria on Canada.ca based on your circumstances, as well as speak with your accountant. (April 23, 2020)</p>
<p>Claiming work from home expenses</p>
<p>Nilesh in Port Credit, ON:</p>
<p>Both my wife and I are working from home. She has been working at home for a long time while I just started once our office shut down and all employees were told to work at home. We will both be getting T2200 forms for 2020. We calculate 10 per cent of our home expenses (electricity, water, home phone, gas, etc.) as expenses for my wife. Are both of us eligible to deduct 10 per cent of our home expenses? (April 17, 2020)</p>
<p>Robin Taub, founder of Robin Taub Financial Consulting:</p>
<p>Claiming at home work expenses for a household Robin Taub, founder of Robin Taub Financial Consulting, talks about deducting at home work expenses in your taxes.</p>
<p>Because your office shut down and your employer told you that you had to work from home, you can deduct the portion of certain costs like utilities, that relate to your home work space.</p>
<p>You have to use a reasonable basis to prorate these expenses like the square footage of your home workspace divided by the total finished area of your house. If you spent money to maintain the workspace only, you may be able to deduct all of those costs without prorating them.</p>
<p>Assuming you and your wife use different workspaces that aren’t the same size, then the percentage you use to prorate home office expenses can be different. Finally, you can only claim home office expenses for the period in 2020 when you had to work from home. (April 20, 2020)</p>
