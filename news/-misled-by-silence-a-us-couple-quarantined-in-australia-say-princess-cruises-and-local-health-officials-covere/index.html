Kay and Bill Barancik embarked on what they thought would be a dream 13-day cruise aboard the Ruby Princess ship from Sydney, Australia, on March 8th.</p>
<p>The couple, from LA, had their trip cut short after three passengers and a crew member on board got sick during the cruise.</p>
<p>The Baranciks, along with nearly 2,700 other passengers, disembarked on March 19, unaware that the cases on board had been tested for COVID-19.</p>
<p>The Baranciks are now under a mandatory 14-day quarantine in Australia. They estimate that they have lost some $3,100 in missed flights and hotel stays.</p>
<p>Visit Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>On March 8, Kay and Bill Barancik embarked on what they thought would be a dream 13-day cruise from Sydney, Australia, around the coast of New Zealand.</p>
<p>The trip was a belated birthday celebration for Kay, who had just turned 73.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were so excited,&rdquo; Kay told Insider. The couple landed in Sydney from their home in Los Angeles several days before their ship, the Ruby Princess, was due to sail. &ldquo;Everything was beautiful &hellip; it all seemed so normal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the trip of a lifetime ended two days earlier than expected, with the ship returning to Sydney Harbor on March 19.</p>
<p>About 2,700 passengers disembarked from the ship at around 6 a.m. local time. Barancik said that her passport was not checked and no temperatures were taken as they got off.</p>
<p>Princess Cruises, which operates the Ruby Princess, announced more than 24 hours later that three passengers and one crew member &ldquo;reported flu-like symptoms during the cruise.&rdquo; They later tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear how many people on the ship had direct contact with the four COVID-19 patients before they were placed into isolation on board the ship.</p>
<p>The Baranciks, along with thousands of other passengers, are now struggling to understand how Australian health authorities and Princess Cruises let the passengers go on their way without warning of their potential exposure to the virus, which had by then been officially declared a pandemic.</p>

<p>Kay Brancik said she feels deceived by both the New South Wales Ministry of Health (known as NSW Health), and Princess Cruises. Neither told passengers about those on board exhibiting symptoms that matched the coronavirus.</p>
<p>At the time they were travelling, sister ships the Diamond Princess and the Grand Princess had already recorded major, deadly coronavirus outbreaks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prior cruise had delayed disembarking so they knew there were problems,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We knew other Princess ships had problems like Diamond and Grand. So when we were ushered off quickly, we assumed no one had reported symptoms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were misled by silence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prior to the ship&rsquo;s arrival in Sydney Harbour, Australia put a 30-day ban on international cruise ships sailing into its ports. The Ruby Princess, along with three other ships, was given special permission to dock anyway.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Carnival Australia, which operates seven cruise brands including Princess Cruises, told Insider in a statement that the ship was allowed to dock because it was regarded as &quot; low risk for COVID-19.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our onboard medical team was rigorous in its treatment of some guests who reported flu-like symptoms and these guests were isolated,&rdquo; the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In line with existing protocols, the ship reported these cases to NSW Health, which in turn requested swabs to be provided following the ship&rsquo;s arrival in Sydney, some of which subsequently tested positive for COVID-19.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spokesperson said that the four cases were not tested on board because &ldquo;it is practice the world over that tests for COVID-19 are not conducted onboard cruise ships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The protocol is for swabs to be tested by the relevant public health authority, and this was done in relation to Ruby Princess,&rdquo; the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disembarkation of the ship was in line with the then-existing process for health clearance for vessels on arrival in port.&rdquo;</p>

<p>NSW Health conducted coronavirus testing on the sick Ruby Princess passengers only after its thousands of passengers had left.</p>
<p>New South Wales health minister Brad Hazzard admitted on March 21 that the results of the COVID-19 testing should have been known before that decision was made.</p>
<p>Since the incident, there have been more than 400 confirmed coronavirus cases across Australia linked to the Ruby Princess, according to The Guardian, accounting for more than 10% of Australia&rsquo;s total cases.</p>
<p>Kay Barancik says she&rsquo;s not sure who to blame for the debacle, which has left her and her husband stranded in Sydney under a mandatory 14-day quarantine from the day they disembarked from the ship.</p>
<p>She says she and Bill knew of the risks associated with cruise travel before they left for Sydney, but had been planning the trip for over a year and felt confident that Australia had a low number of coronavirus cases.</p>
<p>At the time that they arrived in Sydney on March 5, several days before their cruise left, Australia had only recorded 59 cases.</p>
<p>Kay was also planning to visit a friend in Australia battling a terminal illness after their cruise, strengthening their determination to make the trip.</p>
<p>The couple attempted to return to Los Angeles on several occasions after the magnitude of the coronavirus pandemic became clearer. First, they tried to fly out of Auckland, New Zealand, which was one of the cruise stops. But then the stop was canceled.</p>
<p>Then they tried to take a United Airlines flight out of Sydney on March 22, which they could not board because of the mandatory quarantine.</p>
<p>NSW Health has been sending the Baranciks a daily email survey to monitor their symptoms and their movements. The couple says NSW Health has not offered any sort of compensation or services for their prolonged stay in Australia.</p>
<p>Kay estimates that the couple has lost over $3,100 in missed flights and hotel stays while they wait out their quarantine period.</p>
<p>A representative for NSW Health did not immediately respond to Insider for comment.</p>
<p>Other passengers on the ship have claimed that Princess Cruises is responsible for the mishap, which unleashed a wave of sick passengers onto Australia&rsquo;s streets without warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see Princess Cruises investigated,&rdquo; said Janet Dixon-Hughes, another Ruby Princess passenger who is self-isolating at home in Australia. She told Insider: &ldquo;The local authorities are playing a pointless blame game. The real culprit is the cruise company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why were they not carrying COVID-19 test kits?&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="princess-cruises-coral-princess-headed-to-florida-with-a-dozen-cases-of-covid-19-on-board">Princess Cruises&rsquo; Coral Princess headed to Florida with a dozen cases of COVID-19 on board</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/10025b4218629a1e658802bdcd0f6f8c1b7f8b55/c=2-2-800-453/local/-/media/USATODAY/cruiselog/2014/09/22/1411398060000-9469116262-56bf126d05-o.jpg?width=798&amp;height=451&amp;fit=crop&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp" alt="img">
Yet another Princess Cruises ship is facing a coronavirus attack. A dozen passengers on the Coral Princess have tested positive for COVID-19, the line announced Thursday in a release shared by spokesperson Negin Kamali.</p>
<p>After a &ldquo;small cluster&rdquo; of passengers with respiratory illness emerged on board, Coral Princess collected and sent 13 COVID-19 tests to Barbados on Tuesday. Seven passengers and five crew members tested positive for the virus, which has infected more than 981,000 people worldwide and killed more than 50,200.</p>
<p>The ship is headed to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where two Holland America ships, the MS Rotterdam and MS Zaandam, also hope to dock. Between those two ships, 233 people have reported flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>The Coral Princess is estimated to arrive in Fort Lauderdale on Saturday. It is unclear whether the line has received permission to dock in Florida. In the release provided by Kamali, the line said they &ldquo;remain in contact with local officials regarding disembarkation details.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis:To accept state residents off Holland America cruise ships</p>
<p>In total, there are 1,898 people on board the Coral Princess including 1,020 guests and 878 crew members. The cruise line said that passengers have been asked to self isolate in their staterooms. When they are not working, crew members have also been asked to stay in their rooms.</p>
<p>All meals are being delivered to passengers&rsquo; rooms and face masks are also being given to passengers and crew members on board.</p>
<p>CruiseMapper showed the ship to be off the coast of the Dominican Republic on Thursday afternoon. According to the cruise-tracking site, the Coral Princess is in the midst of a 32-day one-way cruise from San Antonio, Chile, to Fort Lauderdale where it was originally meant to end on April 6. It departed on March 5.</p>
<p>Princess Cruises has been at the eye of the coronavirus storm with two of its ships, the Diamond Princess and the Grand Princess, experiencing significant, back-to-back outbreaks of COVID-19 in the span of two months. There have also been positive cases documented aboard the Ruby Princess, which is due to disembark in Sydney Australia this weekend, according to CruiseMapper.</p>
<p>More than 700 people tested positive and 11 died after being on board the Diamond Princess, which was quarantined for two weeks off the coast of Japan in February. At least 103 Grand Princess passengers were infected and two have died; that ship docked in Oakland, California last month. U.S. passengers from both ships were quarantined at military bases for two weeks after returning.</p>

<h3 id="coronavirus-how-did-australias-ruby-princess-cruise-debacle-happen">Coronavirus: How did Australia&rsquo;s Ruby Princess cruise debacle happen?</h3>
<p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A09F/production/_111391114_gettyimages-1213428645.jpg" alt="img">
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Thousands of passengers left the ship unaware of a Covid-19 outbreak on board</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Ruby Princess cruise ship docked in Sydney with dozens of undiagnosed coronavirus cases onboard.</p>
<p>Almost 2,700 passengers - some coughing and spluttering - were allowed to leave the ship at Sydney Harbour, catching trains, buses and even overseas flights to get home.</p>
<p>More than 130 people from the cruise have now tested positive, making it the biggest single source of infections in Australia. One passenger died in hospital on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The saga has caused much anger: why was the ship allowed to dock and unload people?</p>
<p>What passengers were told</p>
<p>Passengers have vented their anger over how the situation was handled by ship operator Princess Cruises and Australian authorities.</p>
<p>Elisa McCafferty, an Australian woman who flew home to London with her husband immediately after disembarking, told the BBC: &ldquo;Nothing was said at anytime about anyone being sick onboard. It was a distinct lack of information coming through from Princess the entire time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She only learned of the danger while collecting her bags at Heathrow Airport.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I turned on my phone and I started getting all these notifications from people back in Australia saying &lsquo;there&rsquo;s been confirmed cases on the Ruby,'&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I was just absolutely petrified. We had just been on two full flights - what if we had infected someone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said she now had a dry cough, fever, body aches and fatigue - and they were self-isolating at home. They were also concerned about their elderly parents and friends who were on the trip too.</p>
<p>Image copyright ELISA MCCAFFERTY Image caption Elisa McCafferty and her husband believe they may have got sick on the ship</p>
<p>Other passengers recalled coming into contact with sick people on the boat and said there were no warnings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that they let us down,&rdquo; said Bill Beerens, a Sydney man who tested positive for the virus in hospital on the day he disembarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do honestly believe that they [cruise ship management] knew what was going on and they just wanted us off the boat,&rdquo; he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.</p>
<p>Elderly couple Rona and Michael Doubrin said they had symptoms towards the end of the cruise but had not been concerned, because they had not been told to practice social distancing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People were going down to the pool, we were lying in the sun, eating in the dining room, dancing, seeing shows,&rdquo; Ms Doubrin told Daily Mail Australia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would have isolated ourselves in the cabin if we&rsquo;d known. We&rsquo;re not spring chickens - we&rsquo;re high risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What happened in Sydney?</p>
<p>After an 11-day voyage, the ship returned to the city before dawn, cutting short its final New Zealand leg as the nation announced a travel ban.</p>
<p>At the time, according to NSW Health, about a dozen passengers reported feeling unwell and they had swabs taken for Covid-19. An ambulance took a passenger to hospital. (The woman, aged in her 70s, died on Tuesday, authorities said.)</p>
<p>But other passengers on board weren&rsquo;t told of this. Instead, thousands streamed off the boat at Circular Quay, just across from the Sydney Opera House. The bustling area leads directly into the city centre, with transit links to the airport and outer suburbs.</p>
<p>Five days earlier, Australia began ordering anyone returning from overseas to self-isolate for 14 days - a directive which applied to the cruise passengers.</p>

<p>But the Ruby Princess passengers weren&rsquo;t screened and were unmonitored when they left the ship. About a third were international passengers - they were told they could travel overseas immediately or self-isolate in Sydney for a fortnight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They even said, you can get a train home,&rdquo; said Ms McCafferty.</p>
<p>New South Wales health officials have said they followed national guidelines which allow passengers to disembark if the route is considered &ldquo;low risk&rdquo;. The Ruby Princess was given that status because it had been to New Zealand only.</p>
<p>One day after the ship docked, officials revealed the first cases of Covid-19 confirmed in three people who had been on board - two passengers and a crew member.</p>
<p>It prompted a scramble to track down everyone else who had been on board.</p>
<p>And at least 21 of the 48 people who had tested positive by Monday were found in other Australian states. By Tuesday, the total number of cases linked to the ship had climbed to 133.</p>
<p>How did this happen?</p>
<p>It is hardly the first cruise ship to see infections - the Diamond Princess, also operated by Princess Cruises, drew global focus in February. Its passengers were quarantined for almost a month off the coast of Japan before being repatriated. More than 600 cases were linked to the ship.</p>
<p>Governments at Australia&rsquo;s state and federal level have pointed blame at each other. Princess Cruises has said it followed official guidelines.</p>
<p>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Passengers disembarking from an earlier Ruby Princess voyage in February in Sydney</p>
<p>On Saturday, The Australian newspaper reported that the ship had logged 158 ill passengers on its previous voyage to New Zealand. Nine people were tested upon arrival in Sydney on 8 March - and their tests results came back negative. However, two passengers from that journey were found to have tested positive after flying home to Darwin.</p>
<p>NSW port and health authorities declined to reply to BBC questions about these reports.</p>
<p>What have authorities said?</p>
<p>On Monday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison described the mistake as the responsibility of state officials.</p>
<p>NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard told reporters on Saturday: &ldquo;With the benefit of what we now know&hellip; I&rsquo;d have said &lsquo;yeah, maybe we should hold them on the ship.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he rejected Canberra&rsquo;s accusations that state officials had not properly checked cruise ships upon entry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;New South Wales is actually going over and above what the national guidelines are,&rdquo; said Mr Hazzard.</p>
<p>State health officials stressed they had run assessments &ldquo;well beyond federal requirements&rdquo; for 63 ships which have entered the harbour since mid-February.</p>
<p>Others noted that while Canberra had enacted a ban on cruise ships arriving, it had allowed four including the Ruby Princess to be exempt.</p>
<p>Four other cruise ships into Sydney have been linked to confirmed Covid-19 cases. The Ovation of the Seas ship, which docked in Sydney a day before the Ruby Princess, has seen five positive tests.</p>

<p>Health officials say infected patients are in self-isolation or in hospital. All passengers have been told to quarantine themselves.</p>
<p>In the wake of the Ruby Princess bungle, Western Australia on Monday questioned where it would allow a cruise ship to dock there. The European ship Magnifica is carrying 1,700 passengers - about 250 of whom are reported to have respiratory illnesses.</p>
<p>It was allowed to dock on Tuesday to refuel, but all on board were banned from disembarking.</p>
<p>Premier Mark McGowan had stressed: &ldquo;I will not allow what happened in Sydney to happen here.&rdquo;
