Tiger Roll ‚Äì The real Tiger Roll is a legend of the sport, winning the last two Grand Nationals, while the virtual Tiger Roll has one Virtual Grand National to his name. Can the virtual Tiger do it again off top weight? He‚Äôs the 5/1 favourite.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s our horse-by-horse guide and verdict while further down is details on how to get your friends involved in a VGN sweepstake and also our charity competition , in which you could win Cheltenham Festival tickets for 2021.</p>
<p>You can bet on the Virtual Grand National ( Sky Bet odds here ) but leading bookmakers, including Sky Bet, have pledged that all profits will be donated to NHS Charities Together in the battle to beat the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Using the latest CGI technology, this special version of the race will feature the 40 horses and riders who were most likely to run in the Aintree spectacular and the favourite is, as you might have guessed, two-time real defending champion Tiger Roll.</p>
<p>The Virtual Grand National is riding to the rescue to fill some of the void left by the great race&rsquo;s absence from the decimated sporting calendar this weekend, with ITV televising the event live from 1700 BST on Saturday.</p>
<p>üèÜüèÜ Tiger Roll won&rsquo;t get the chance to make it three historic Grand National wins in a row on Saturday&hellip; üïπÔ∏è&hellip;but he&rsquo;s favourite to do something Red Rum never did and win the Virtual version. pic.twitter.com/whz2qcu9uS</p>
<p>Bristol De Mai ‚Äì A bit of a surprise connections have chosen this route, but with no virtual Bowl to aim for perhaps their hand was forced. The real Bristol De Mai is a Grade One winner and a top-class horse, but there are stamina question marks over him and the virtual BDM.</p>
<p>Aso ‚Äì The real Aso has never won over further than 2m5f and he was last seen finishing 59 lengths off the winner in the Ryanair Chase over that distance. They used to say you needed a two-and-a-half-miler to win the VGN, but even Ed Chamberlin doesn‚Äôt fancy him for this.</p>
<p>Elegant Escape ‚Äì A former Welsh Grand National who has bags of stamina. Such an asset will likely be programmed into the virtual Elegant Escape, but so will his lack of pace ‚Äì will we hear him mentioned after the first mile?</p>
<p>Anibale Fly ‚Äì The real thing was placed in two Gold Cups and has finished fourth and fifth in two Grand Nationals. That will hold the virtual AF in good stead, but, while he‚Äôs likely to be in the top 10, he doesn‚Äôt look well-handicapped enough to win it.</p>
<p>Top Ville Ben ‚Äì 45/1? A random choice of odds which suggests anything could happen here. The real TVB likes left-handed and flat tracks, so he should be right at home at virtual Liverpool and his bold jumping could well have taken him a long way in the real thing.</p>
<p>Beware The Bear ‚Äì Nicky Henderson has yet to win a Grand National, virtual or otherwise, but in Beware The Bear he finally has the right type of horse. The one problem is he just looks a little high in the weights, in both real and virtual worlds.</p>
<p>Peregrine Run ‚Äì Would need to sprout the wings of a peregrine falcon to win this, and, while that‚Äôs more likely in the Virtual Grand National than the real thing, he‚Äôs readily dismissed as a no hoper.</p>
<p>Jett ‚Äì Would need to sprout the wings of a jet plane to win this‚Ä¶ no, we won‚Äôt go there again. Actually looked quite an interesting outsider in the real thing, as he brings recent Grade One form to the table and looked reasonably handicapped.</p>
<p>Alpha Des Obeaux ‚Äì Fell in the 2018 Grand National, shaped like a non-stayer in the Irish equivalent one year and stamina would be a real worry in real life. Ran third in the Becher, though, so he does have fences form for the computer generator to factor in.</p>
<p>Total Recall ‚Äì The surprise choice of the virtual Paul Townend, so must be impressing virtual Willie Mullins at virtual Closutton. The real thing won the Thyestes Chase last time out, but that looked to have scuppered his chances from a handicap viewpoint.</p>
<p>The Storyteller ‚Äì The real Storyteller is such a fascinating horse you could write a book about him. He was the luckiest winner of a Grade One novice chase that you‚Äôve ever seen, while he‚Äôs a Cheltenham Festival winner, too. Second in the Pertemps last time, so would‚Äôve been aiming to do a Pineau De Re in the real thing, a horse that was placed in the Festival hurdle before winning at Aintree.</p>
<p>Magic Of Light ‚Äì A surprise second to Tiger Roll in the real thing last year at big odds, she clearly took well to the fences and her whole season has revolved around going back to Aintree. Looks sure to run well again at virtual Liverpool.</p>
<p>Talkischeap ‚Äì Won the bet365 Gold Cup at Sandown last year but paid for it after getting walloped by the handicapper. You would think that would scupper his chances in the VGN, too.</p>
<p>Yala Enki ‚Äì Is it soft at virtual Liverpool? His chance in the real thing would depend on getting some serious cut in the ground, you would think, but is good jumper and dour stayer so if those traits have carried over to the virtual world he‚Äôd have an each-way chance.</p>
<p>Ballyoptic ‚Äì Fell four out when beaten in the real race last year and showed little over the fences when well out of the frame in the Becher back in December. Bounced right back to form with an Ascot win after the weights for the real thing were released, and that has been factored in here so he‚Äôs virtually 6lb well-in.</p>
<p>Burrows Saint ‚Äì A seven-year-old and that age group have struggled in the real thing, criteria the geeks behind the VGN will surely take into account. They‚Äôll also take into account he‚Äôs trained by a virtual maestro, ridden by a virtual top jock and is improving like a virtual superstar. Also won the real Irish Nash last year.</p>
<p>Definitly Red ‚Äì Well fancied by the real Brian Ellison for the real thing and prepped for Aintree with a commanding win at Kelso when last seen. 11-year-olds used to rule the roost in the National, but they‚Äôve become less fashionable in recent years and such recency bias might well be factored into the VGN.</p>
<p>Sub Lieutenant ‚Äì Another 11-year-old and this one was a G1 nearly-horse in his pomp. Well treated now on his best form and was second over the real fences in the Topham last year. Has his virtual stamina to prove, though.</p>
<p>Ok Corral ‚Äì The flatter track and quicker surface was credited with OK Corral‚Äôs bounce-back-to-form win in the Sky Bet Chase at Doncaster in January. Lightly-raced and interesting for virtual Nicky Henderson, as mentioned before, still seeking his first Grand National ‚Äì at virtual Aintree or otherwise.</p>
<p>Tout Est Permis - According to google this translates as everything is allowed in English. Third in Pertemps Final over hurdles at Cheltenham and won the odd valuable chase along the way for veteran trainer Noel Meade. Only seven so a mere slip of a thing.</p>
<p>Vintage Clouds - Plenty of positives in that trainer Sue Smith and owner Trevor Hemmings have won Nationals and he‚Äôs very good on his day. The negative‚Ä¶he seemed to take a distinct dislike to real Aintree on two visits here.</p>
<p>Crievehill - Trainer Nigel Twiston-Davies knows how to win a real Nash ‚Äì this fellow has never run in one but did win a couple of races at Wetherby and Haydock this winter.</p>
<p>Lake View Lad - Another one owned by Trevor Hemmings, he used to own the actual Blackpool Tower too. Described as sturdy horse which could be deemed offensive but another capable staying chaser.</p>
<p>Jury Duty - You can‚Äôt opt out of this in real life, but can in the world of the Virtual Grand National. You might not want to as he was third last year. He did win an American Grand National in 2018 too. We backed him for the real thing last year but he decided to eject his rider at the 18th.</p>
<p>Pleasant Company - Something we all crave for in these times and this lad was second to Tiger Roll in the real Nash of 2017 and was bang there when ejecting his own rider at the fourth last fence last year.</p>
<p>Acapella Bourgeois - You won‚Äôt be surprised to hear he was bred, born and named in France. He races in Ireland, for their champion trainer Willie Mullins, and won a big National trial, the Bobbyjo, last time.</p>
<p>Shattered Love - My response to my partner‚Äôs inquiry as to how I‚Äôm feeling after a morning looking after our two-year-old. The equine version is a very good mare, winner at Grade One level, but not for a little while.</p>
<p>Any Second Now - My response to my partner‚Äôs inquiry over when I‚Äôm going to finally start the washing up. Also sounds like a Bradley Walsh game show. The equine version is trained by Ted Walsh, who knows how to win a Nash, owned by JP McManus, who knows how to win a Nash, and fancied by many pundits.</p>
<p>Potters Corner - One to back if you‚Äôre a fan of the excellent Great Pottery Throw Down, Welsh as he‚Äôs trained in Wales, or you backed him when he won the Welsh National over Christmas.</p>
<p>Dounikos - Ah. Now if you‚Äôve got him in a sweepstake you might be in bother. He‚Äôs pulled up on three of his last four starts and you‚Äôre looking for the biggest shock in VGN history for him to win. To be fair that‚Äôs only four years.</p>
<p>Kildisart - Like Alan Partridge before him, he bounced back to run a screamer when second at the Cheltenham Festival. A possible player but virtual Daryl Jacob prefers Bristol De Mai and he might be a good judge. We&rsquo;ll check with the real Daryl Jacob.</p>
<p>Death Duty - Was a very good horse in his yoof but off for over two years before returning to the fray in January. Gradually returning to form and part of the Gordon Elliott massive.</p>
<p>Ramses De Teille - He&rsquo;s grey in the real world and I presume in the virtual one too. He‚Äôs very talented in the real world ‚Äì and will be in the virtual one too. Didn‚Äôt complete last year‚Äôs real Nash but don‚Äôt rule him out here.</p>
<p>Valtor - Another one the virtual Daryl Jacob could have ridden. He did ride him in the real Nash last year, finishing 18th, and he‚Äôd be a shock winner as surely virtual Daryl got the real Daryl on zoom before choosing.</p>
<p>Saint Xavier - The real David Maxwell would struggle to do 10st 4lb but it&rsquo;s not a problem for the virtual one. If you‚Äôre fans of Spanish Roman Catholic Saints this one‚Äôs for you. Not the easiest to make a case for if you&rsquo;re not.</p>
<p>Warrior Tale - He‚Äôs trained by Paul Nicholls which is a positive for any horse but he‚Äôs pulled up in the last two real Nationals which is a negative for any horse.</p>
<p>Double Shuffle - Dad dancers at weddings head this way but this fellow will have to quickstep a little faster than when 12th in the real nash last year.</p>
<p>Kimberlite Candy - This one is a huge player. He won the Classic Chase at Warwick, form which is working out really well, and is another in the famous McManus silks. Lots of good judges, well team sportinglife, think he‚Äôll win.</p>
<p>Walk In The Mill - Aintree specialist and fourth in the virtual nash last year. He might the the last one to sneak in the race but could well reward those who are prepared to scroll all the way down to the bottom. If you&rsquo;ve got this far down our pinstickers&rsquo; guide we thank you.</p>
<p>Our Prediction:

<h3 id="2020-virtual-grand-national-how-does-the-race-work-and-when-is-it-on">2020 Virtual Grand National: how does the race work and when is it on?</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.racingpost.com/favicon.ico" alt="img">
Virtual Grand National: computer-simulated race to be shown on ITV1 at 5pm on Saturday</p>
<p>The real Grand National has sadly been cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, but on Saturday millions will tune in to ITV to watch its replacement: a computer-simulated running of the nation&rsquo;s favourite race. Here&rsquo;s the information you need to know:</p>
<p>How does it work?</p>
<p>The Virtual Grand National is a computer-simulated version of Aintree&rsquo;s world-famous steeplechase, designed by Inspired Entertainment.</p>
<p>They used computer-generated imagery (CGI) to recreate, as accurately as possible, all aspects of the race such as the course layout and National fences.</p>
<p>The simulation itself is made up of mathematical algorithms using data taken from the horses&rsquo; previous performances. The race&rsquo;s outcome uses a number of factors such as age, weight, form and weather conditions but also contains details such as fallers, unseated riders and collapsing fences.</p>
<p>The Virtual Grand National will attempt to recreate the famous Aintree race</p>
<p>Data on all of the 40 runners from this year&rsquo;s race have been added and the computer has generated odds.</p>
<p>The three previous Virtual Grand Nationals have been strikingly accurate, with Tiger Roll completing the virtual-real life double in 2018.</p>
<p>Virtual Grand National winners (real life result)</p>
<p>2019 Rathvinden (third)</p>
<p>2018 Tiger Roll (won)</p>
<p>2017 Cause Of Causes (second)</p>
<p>How can I watch the race?</p>
<p>The Virtual Grand National will be broadcast live on ITV1 at 5pm on Saturday. Coverage will be led by Nick Luck with Alice Plunkett and Richard Pitman on as pundits. Stewart Machin will be commentating.</p>
<p>The broadcast will also feature a race of champions, a simulation of previous Aintree greats being tested in an epic clash between 40 famous race winners.</p>
<p>Can I bet on it?</p>
<p>Yes. Bookmakers are keen to support the race and on Wednesday it was revealed that they would be donating any profits taken on the race to the NHS.</p>
<p>While the race has been pre-recorded, producers Carm Productions have vowed to ensure the result will not leak out to the betting market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the Virtual Grand National show is pre-recorded, we insist on strict levels of confidentiality from everyone involved in the production process,&rdquo; the company said in a statement.</p>

<p>Yes, but not since the 1967-68 season. Racing was suspended then due to the outbreak of foot and mouth and the BBC broadcasted two computer-simulated races.</p>
<p>The King George VI Chase was simulated in an electric computer centre and commentated by Peter O&rsquo;Sullevan on the BBC.</p>
<p>The video below, broadcast by British Pathe, details the process of the computer-generated running of the 1967 Massey Ferguson Gold Cup, now traditionally known as the Caspian Caviar Gold Cup.</p>

<h3 id="itv-virtual-grand-national-all-you-need-to-know-about-this-years-event-and-how-to-watch-it">ITV Virtual Grand National: All you need to know about this year&rsquo;s event and how to watch it</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nwemail.co.uk/resources/images/11222894/" alt="img">
The Grand National may have cancelled for the first time in its 181-year history due to the Coronavirus - but a different event will be held this weekend.</p>
<p>All is not lost for horse racing fans - who will still be able to cheer on the 40-horse field in the virtual race.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because this year, a virtual Grand National will be run, with all profits from bets going to the NHS at a time when the health service is need the most; the event is expected to raise ¬£1 million to support NHS charities.</p>
<p>What is a virtual Grand National?</p>
<p>Though this might be the first time you&rsquo;ve ever heard of a virtual Grand National, it&rsquo;s not the first time one has been run.</p>
<p>A virtual edition of the famous horse race takes place every year, in fact; in 2018 the computer correctly predicted Tiger Roll to win and got three of the top five finishers correct.</p>
<p>The race will be simulated based on the form and other factors affecting a real race, with 40 virtual runners and riders taking place.</p>
<p>The key difference this year is that the virtual race will be televised, with ITV showing it in place of their normal live coverage from Aintree.</p>
<p>Aside from a virtual representation of this year&rsquo;s race, there will also be a special race of champions, where the winners from history will meet.</p>
<p>When is the virtual Grand National?</p>
<p>ITV will be showing the virtual Grand National on ITV1 and the ITV hub for all to watch on Saturday, April 4.</p>
<p>The CGI version of the race will see the 40 virtual runners and riders will take to the course shortly after 5pm.</p>
<p>A spokesperson from ITV said: ‚ÄúThe Virtual Grand National is set to be a great television event and huge credit must go to the organisers for putting on the nation&rsquo;s favourite race at a time when sports fans are starved of live action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Can I bet?</p>
<p>Yes - the race will be simulated based on the form and other factors affecting a real race, so seasoned punters who have been studying up all season can still get involved.</p>
<p>Those looking to have their traditional once-a-year flutter will also be able to make their picks based on the usual criteria of names and colours, as they would in a normal race, with odds reflecting the real-life chances of the runners and riders.</p>
<p>A number of bookmakers will have odds on their websites ahead of the race and Tiger Roll is expected to lead the market.</p>
<p>¬£10 is the maximum stake available and bookmakers are making profits available to the NHS Charities Group.</p>
<p>Who are the runners?</p>
