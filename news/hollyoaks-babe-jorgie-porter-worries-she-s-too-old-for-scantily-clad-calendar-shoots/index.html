Hollyoaks beauty Jorgie Porter fears she&rsquo;s &ldquo;too told&rdquo; to continue with her racy calendar shoots any longer.</p>
<p>The soap star, 32, who played Theresa McQueen in the Channel 4 show, has previously won many awards for her sexy looks and featured in several lads&rsquo; mags over the years.</p>
<p>But despite this, the star is fearful her age will limit the chance of future sexy lingerie photoshoots.</p>
<p>Jorgie decided not to release an annual calendar for 2020 as she was worried there&rsquo;d be no interest from her fans.</p>
<p>However, shocked Jorgie received quite the opposite reaction, as eager fans have been messaging her about the calendar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I might be too old. Where does it end? When will people say, &lsquo;Stop taking your clothes off?'&rdquo; the actress told Daily Star.</p>
<p>(Image: mirror.co.uk)</p>
<p>She added: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t get to shoot a calendar for 2020 - my photographer was getting her wisdom tooth out. I thought nobody would care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jorgie now feels &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; for not bringing out a sexy calendar after disappointing fans, and revealed: &ldquo;Maybe I should have shot one on my phone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gorgeous blonde bombshell said she recently had to ask her mum to confirm her age as she frequently forgets how old she is.</p>
<p>(Image: mirror.co.uk)</p>
<p>Jorgie hilariously added: &ldquo;I always think I&rsquo;m older than I actually am. I thought I was 33 the other day, but I&rsquo;m actually 32. You just forget, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The star&rsquo;s birthday is on Christmas Day, so she credits the festive period for helping her to briefly remember the date.</p>
<p>The stunning TV star came 50th in FHM&rsquo;s 100 Sexiest Women in the World in 2011.</p>
<p>(Image: Jorgie Porter/Instagram)</p>
<p>Jorgie was also shortlisted for the Sexiest Female category at the Soap Awards in 2012 and 2013.</p>
<p>The actress is set to make an epic return to Hollyoaks for the soap&rsquo;s milestone 25th anniversary.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;ll be taking on her role as Theresa once again after she left four years ago.</p>
<p>A source told The Sun : &ldquo;Jorgie is excited about the comeback and can&rsquo;t wait to get her teeth back into her favourite role.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bosses were keen to resurrect one of its most popular characters to draw in original viewers.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="hollyoaks-jorgie-porter-thinks-shes-too-old-to-do-more-calendar-shoots">Hollyoaks&rsquo; Jorgie Porter thinks she&rsquo;s &lsquo;too old&rsquo; to do more calendar shoots</h3>

Hollyoaks favourite Jorgie Porter reckons she&rsquo;s &ldquo;too old&rdquo; to get involved with any more calendar modelling.</p>
<p>At just 32 years of age, she has enjoyed a successful time outside of acting in the modelling industry, but 2020 marks the first time in years that Jorgie has not shot a calendar.</p>
<p>So does this mean her days of posing in front of the camera are behind her?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I might be too old,&rdquo; she told the Daily Star recently. &ldquo;Where does it end? When will people say, &lsquo;Stop taking your clothes off?'&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jorgie explained that she was unable to do the calendar this year as her photographer was busy &ldquo;getting her wisdom tooth out&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought nobody would care. But I&rsquo;ve had so many messages asking me why I haven&rsquo;t done one, I feel quite guilty,&rdquo; she revealed. &ldquo;Maybe I should have shot one on my phone!&rdquo;</p>
