New Brunswick announced another day of no confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, marking the 7th day without a confirmed case.</p>
<p>Four people are still hospitalized because of the coronavirus, but there are no patients in intensive care. There have been a total of 118 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the province and there are currently 11 active cases.</p>
<p>But in a press release issued on Saturday, premier Blaine Higgs warned people not to get complacent following the restrictions the province loosened on Friday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are opening the door slightly and we want to continue to loosen restrictions,&rdquo; said Higgs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, we need to be vigilant during this phase and follow the directives of Public Health. Otherwise we will have to bring back more stringent restrictions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The province also urged people to continue to wear non-medical masks when physical distancing isn&rsquo;t possible, at places such as the grocery store or the pharmacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some stores have indicated they may require customers to wear community face masks, so it is good to have one with you,&rdquo; said Dr. Jennifer Russell, the province&rsquo;s chief medical officer of health, in the press release.

<p>New Brunswick revealed a new system on Friday that officials hope will allow residents a chance to socialize and interact with individuals outside their immediate household as the coronavirus crisis continues.</p>
<p>The two-household bubble system is one of the first steps taken in the province to loosen restrictions meant to stop the spread of COVID-19 in New Brunswick.</p>

<p>Until now, New Brunswickers were supposed to self-isolate and only interact with members of their immediate household.</p>
<p>But under the new system households may now choose to spend time with one other household, assuming that both households agree to the arrangement.</p>
<p>It will effectively create a joined family unit that will allow physical distancing requirements to be dropped between them.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>“This would allow you to visit, have a meal and enjoy the company of another household bubble,” a guidance document issued by the Government of New Brunswick reads.</p>
<p>However, the two households must not have any close contact with anyone else.</p>
<p>The two households will have an “exclusive relationship” and are not supposed to join with more than one household or bubble.</p>

<p>New Brunswick health officials stressed that households are not interchangeable and that once a decision to join two household bubbles is made, they are stuck together.</p>

<p>The two-household restriction will be loosened when the provincial government decides to move to public health’s yellow phase. That will make way for households to see close friends and family.</p>
<p>New Brunswick is recommending that those who work or volunteer in settings where close contact is not avoidable be extra vigilant in their handwashing and symptom screening between the two bubbles.</p>
<p>Questions about COVID-19? Here are some things you need to know:</p>
<p>Health officials caution against all international travel. Returning travellers are legally obligated to self-isolate for 14 days, beginning March 26, in case they develop symptoms and to prevent spreading the virus to others. Some provinces and territories have also implemented additional recommendations or enforcement measures to ensure those returning to the area self-isolate.</p>
<p>Story continues below advertisement</p>
<p>Symptoms can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing — very similar to a cold or flu. Some people can develop a more severe illness. People most at risk of this include older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease. If you develop symptoms, contact public health authorities.</p>
<p>To prevent the virus from spreading, experts recommend frequent handwashing and coughing into your sleeve. They also recommend minimizing contact with others, staying home as much as possible and maintaining a distance of two metres from other people if you go out.</p>

<p>When Kym Murphy, a 54-year-old school bus driver in Rothesay, N.B., started to feel unwell, she didn&rsquo;t suspect COVID-19. After all, she was washing her hands, she was practising physical distancing, and, importantly, she hadn&rsquo;t been travelling.
