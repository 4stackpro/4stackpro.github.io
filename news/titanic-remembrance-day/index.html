The RMS Titanic sank on this day 108 years ago.</p>
<p>Today is &ldquo;National Titanic Remembrance Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a day dedicated to honoring the memory of all those who died when the ocean liner sank in the icy waters of the north Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>Titanic, which was branded as being unsinkable, was carrying over 3,000 passengers and crew members on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York when it hit an iceberg at 11:40pm on April 14th, 1912. The mighty vessel sank 2 hours and 40 minutes later on April 15th.</p>
<p>More than 1,500 people perished in the sinking of Titanic. The disastrous amount of lives lost has been blamed on a litany of reasons, including poor communication and an insufficient number of lifeboats.</p>
<p>For more than 70 years, the wreck of the Titanic laid undisturbed on the ocean floor until it was discovered by oceanographer, Robert Ballard in 1985.

<h3 id="the-little-known-story-of-the-only-black-family-onboard-the-titanic">The little-known story of the only Black family onboard the Titanic</h3>
<p><img src="https://thegrio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Laroche-Family-Picture.jpg" alt="img">
From Walter Lord’s 1955 bestseller “A Night to Remember” to James Cameron’s 1997 blockbuster, the story of the ill-fated RMS Titanic has captured the fascination of millions since the tragic incident claimed the lives of nearly 1,500 passengers in 1912.</p>
<p>We all know this story well; a steamship renowned for her speed and luxury ignored ice warnings on her maiden voyage and struck an iceberg — sending socialites, refugees and a real-life Jack Dawson to early graves.</p>
<p>While Titanic’s sinking has become one of the most infamous shipwrecks of all time, the story of the only Black family aboard has largely been excluded from history.</p>
<p>READ MORE: Coronavirus traces lingered on cruiser for 17 days after evacuation</p>
<p>Joseph Philippe Lemercier Laroche, 25, was a Haitian native traveling as a second class passenger on Titanic. He accompanied his pregnant wife and their two daughters, Simonne and Louise, on the ship’s maiden voyage.</p>
<p>Born into a prosperous and powerful family on May 26, 1886 in Cap-Haitien, Haiti, Joseph was the nephew of Haitian president Dessalines M. Cincinnatus Leconte.</p>
<p>As a child, he took an interest in engineering and was sent to study in France at the age of 15. While visiting a tiny French village several years later, he met Juliette Lafargue, his future wife. After earning an engineering degree, he turned to the Parisian job market.</p>
<p>Joseph was a skilled professional with a degree. He was fluent in English, French and Creole. He came from an affluent family who paid for his education. But he was still a Black man living in 20th century Europe. Racial prejudice and discrimination created an insurmountable barrier that left him struggling to find adequate work. With a growing family and little opportunity for him to provide for them in France, Joseph and Juliette decided to return to Haiti in 1912.</p>
<p>Overjoyed with the news of the family’s return, Joseph’s mother bought them first class tickets on the French liner La France as a reunion gift. However, due to conflicting accommodations that would’ve left the young parents without direct access to their children, the Laroches exchanged the tickets for second-class reservations on the new White Star Liner RMS Titanic.</p>
<p>Neither Joseph nor Juliette could possibly have anticipated the tragic complications of this decision.</p>
<p>The Laroches boarded Titanic on April 10, 1912 at Cherbourg. Over the next 3 days, they likely enjoyed several amenities afforded to second-class passengers — luxurious staterooms, a dining saloon, library and three outdoor promenade decks. In a letter addressed to her father and sent from Titanic’s final stop of Queenstown (now Cobh) Ireland, Juliette Laroche wrote of Titanic’s luxury and friendly fellow travelers:</p>
<p>The arrangements could not be more comfortable. We have two bunks in our cabin, and the two babies sleep on a sofa that converts into a bed. One is at the head, the other at the bottom. A board put before them prevents them from falling. They’re as well, if not better, than in their beds. At the moment they are strolling on the enclosed deck with Joseph, Louise is in her pram, and Simonne is pushing her. They already have become acquainted with people we made the trip from Paris with a gentleman and his lady and their little boy too, who is the same age as Louise. I think they are the only other French people on the boat, so we sat at the same table so that we could chat together. Simonne was so funny – she was playing with a young English girl who had lent her a doll. My Simonne was having a great conversation with her, but the girl did not understand a single word. People on board are very nice. Yesterday, they both were running after a gentleman who had given them chocolates.</p>
<p>There are conflicting and largely unconfirmed reports about racism experienced by the Laroche family and other non-white passengers onboard, but it is certainly feasible that they were the subject of stares, gossip and even crude remarks from crew members.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, their journey across the North Atlantic came to an abrupt end on the night of April 14. At this point in the voyage, Titanic’s wireless operators had received six reports of drifting ice from surrounding steamers, but she continued to travel at full speed.</p>
<p>Around 11:40 p.m., Titanic struck an iceberg 370 miles off the coast of Newfoundland. With only enough lifeboats for about half of its 2,200 passengers, the liner so famously described as “practically unsinkable” was ill-prepared for the circumstance, and the closest rescue vessel Carpathia was 58 miles away. Passengers were stranded in the middle of the ocean, with temperatures dipping below freezing and safety far off in the distance.</p>
<p>According to Juliette’s account, a steward woke the family and rushed them above decks to lifeboats. Juliette spoke no English, and was generally confused about what was happening. She followed her husband to the boat deck. Sometime after midnight, crew members were given the order to load women and children first. In the subsequent chaos, Joseph bid farewell to his pregnant wife and two daughters as they boarded Lifeboat 14, and promised that they’d be reunited in New York.</p>
<p>Joseph was never seen again. Little is known about his final moments. The Titanic sank just after 2 a.m. on the morning of April 15. Roughly 1,500 people were thrown into the icy waters beneath them as the ship broke in two and began its final descent to the ocean floor.</p>
<p>Juliette and her children were rescued along with 700 other survivors by the Cunard liner Carpathia several hours later. When they arrived in New York days later, they were met with crowds and reporters. They searched the masses in hopes that Joseph might’ve been rescued by another ship. Their efforts were in vain. Joseph’s body was never recovered.</p>
<p>The next several years proved to be tragic for the Laroche family. Juliette returned to France with her daughters, in grief. Later that year, Joseph’s uncle President Leconte was assassinated when an explosion destroyed the Haitian National Palace, just 4 months after the Titanic sank.</p>

<p>Juliette gave birth to a son in December 1912, who she named after his father. Joseph Jr. died in 1987. Louise, her last remaining child and the last French survivor of the sinking, died in 1998.</p>
<p>The story of the Laroche family is unique, but the erasure of their existence is all too familiar. The Laroches weren’t the only passengers of color on Titanic, but every mainstream effort to revisit the doomed ship’s past has excluded stories like theirs and others.</p>
<p>For years, many thought that people of color were barred from sailing on Titanic. Urban legends and tales from folklore added fuel to these theories, even compelling renowned poet Langston Hughes to note in a 1953 Chicago Defender article that as a child he, “remembered the old folks talking about it and how, ‘Thank God, there were no Negroes on that ship.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t until 1995, when a French member of the Titanic Historical Society interviewed Louise Laroche, that the remarkable story of the only Black family on the Titanic was first shared with the general public.</p>
<p>In the 25 years since, the Laroches have only been the subject of a few plays and a handful of articles. They haven’t been afforded the same kind of fame or name recognition as their white counterparts.</p>
<p>Joseph Phillipe Lemercier Laroche and his family were passengers on the world’s most famous ship, and their story did not end in the icy depths of the North Atlantic Ocean that fateful night in 1912. Their time in the spotlight is long overdue.

<h3 id="titanic-disaster-continues-to-fascinate">Titanic disaster continues to fascinate</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.expressandstar.com/resizer/o9j_qpRJJAm8DqMkkavn6drO2bM=/1200x0/filters:quality(100)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-expressandstar-mna.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QVVV53O3W5CPXGQTV7TNXK5YVM.jpg" alt="img">
They were the last words of the captain as the Titanic slid beneath the waves.</p>
<p>And as the mighty liner foundered, the band played Nearer, My God, to Thee.</p>
<p>Or maybe none of these things happened. Because the myths and legends surrounding the loss of the Titanic on this day in 1912 began virtually immediately.</p>
<p>There have since been worse sinkings involving greater loss of life, but the fascination with the Titanic endures well over a century later.</p>
<p>The liner hit an iceberg on its maiden trans-Atlantic voyage and sank with the loss of around 1,500 lives. In actual fact, it is probably truer to say that it nearly missed an iceberg, because if it had sailed straight in to it, it is quite possible that the Titanic would have suffered terrible bow damage, but would have remained afloat.</p>
<p>It was the act of being sliced open, fatally compromising the integrity of so many watertight compartments, which proved fatal.</p>
<p>William E. Hipkins was among the victims</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s turn the clock back to that time and imagine being an Express and Star reader opening their paper on Monday, April 15, 1912, to receive news which was alarming, but also reassuring.</p>
<p>Advertising</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to wireless telegrams,&rdquo; the report read, &ldquo;the Titanic, the largest liner in the world, which left England last week on her maiden voyage to New York, struck a huge iceberg on Sunday night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Latest cablegrams state that the Virginia, which made for the scene of the accident in response to a wireless message, is now standing by the disabled liner, and that there is no danger of loss of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It went on to say that all the passengers had left the Titanic by 3.30am and that by late afternoon the stricken liner was slowly making her way towards Halifax.</p>
<p>By way of background, it added that she was the largest vessel afloat, with a tonnage of 46,382, and a length of 882 feet.</p>
<p>Advertising</p>
<p>Built by the White Star Company, officials at the line &ldquo;hope it is not so serious as reported, and that later news will show that the earlier reports were exaggerated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These false reports came from reputable news agencies. But the truth was not long in coming. The following day the full scale of the disaster was outlined under a massive headline – for its day – baldly stating TITANIC SUNK.</p>
<p>With reports putting the number of survivors at 868, it was elementary maths to work out that the death toll was 1,490, and with only slight variations – some put it at over 1,500 – that is a figure to have stood the test of time.</p>
<p>Almost all those saved were women and children, which meant that almost all the men on board were dead.</p>
<p>There could have been many more people saved. But the one thing everybody knows about the Titanic is that there weren&rsquo;t enough lifeboats.</p>
<p>Crowds gather around the bulletin board of a newspaper in New York, where the names of people rescued from the sinking are displayed</p>
<p>For Southampton, it was a staggering blow as practically every member of the crew lived there.</p>
<p>Many of those on board were prominent figures of the day. An especially tragic aspect of the disaster was the high number of honeymooners or newly-married couples on board.</p>
<p>The ship&rsquo;s commander, Captain Edward Smith, was a Staffordshire man, born in the county in 1850.</p>
<p>As is the case with disasters today, there was a huge public desire to do something to aid the victims, and newspapers including the Express and Star played their part in accepting donations.</p>
<p>Among many offers of help, The Royal Orphanage at Wolverhampton offered to admit 10 children of crew victims from the ship. At the Grand Theatre in Wolverhampton, a special matinee performance was held in aid of the relief fund.</p>
<p>In the immediate aftermath, there was considerable confusion over who had died, who had survived, and who was on board in the first place.</p>
<p>For instance, A Mrs Day, formerly of Penn Road and Codsall Wood, was said to have booked a passage on the Titanic to join her husband in Canada. Mrs Day, of Lower Villiers Street, was with her daughter Mrs Cox, her son-in-law, and other relatives. However, a postcard of the Laurentic (another liner) posted from Liverpool suggested the fears were misplaced – Titanic had sailed from Southampton.</p>
<p>It was reported that among the list of second-class passengers on the Titanic who survived appeared the names of Richard Becker, Allan Becker, Miss Ruth Becker, and Miss Mary Becker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr and Mrs Becker, who up to recently lived in Haygate Road, Wellington, Mr Becker being connected with the Picture Palace on Tan Bank, left Shropshire with the intention of returning to America, but an Express and Star representative failed to obtain confirmatory evidence this morning that the Becker family referred to included the former residents of Wellington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Further inquiries go to show that Mr Becker, said to have sailed on the Titanic, is reported as still at Plymouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr and Mrs Griffiths and three sons, of Southall&rsquo;s Bank, Dawley, left the district ten days ago to join the Titanic at Southampton, as emigrants for American. Their friends at Dawley are much concerned as to their fate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A son of Mr and Mrs Speed, of Crudgington, was also an emigrant on the Titanic, and it is feared he is among the drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second officer, Lieutenant William Murdock, was a cousin of a Stourbridge clergyman, the Rev Dr Ewart.</p>
<p>How the disaster was reported</p>
<p>And what was the fate of one of the stewards, James Richard Dinenage, the son of Mr and Mrs Dinenage of Bloxwich Road, Walsall? It was his first trip on a White Star liner.</p>
<p>As survivors finally made it to land, the pressmen were waiting, and first hand accounts of the final moments of the liner, some of them lurid, began to emerge.</p>
<p>The Captain, some survivors said, had shot himself as he stood on the bridge, and the chief engineer did likewise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Further reports stated that following the collision there were wild scenes of panic on board, and that men fought like madmen among each other to escape the fate that awaited so many of the passengers and crew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is stated that several men were shot dead by the officers,&rdquo; reported the Express and Star.</p>
<p>Specifically, it was said that three Italians were shot dead in the struggle for the lifeboats.</p>
<p>A rush of steerage passengers (that is, the ones paying lowest fares) to the lifeboats was halted by officers with revolvers.</p>
<p>Yet as the Titanic went down, the band was playing.</p>
<p>Some of these accounts were quickly shown to be well wide of the mark and, far from having shot himself, Captain Smith was soon lauded for his &ldquo;unparalleled self sacrifice and heroism,&rdquo; a man who stayed at his post and shortly before being literally washed away called through his megaphone to the mass below &ldquo;Be British!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a statue to him in Lichfield.</p>
<p>The moment the Titanic sank has been illustrated in art and film many times</p>
<p>As for the band, the bandsmen were said to have played to the end, with lively music at first and then as the ship sank, Nearer, My God, to Thee.</p>
<p>Confirmed local victims? There was Christopher Head, the second husband of Ethel, of the Chapman family, whose family home was at Kilhendre Hall at Dudleston, Ellesmere.</p>
<p>Five people from West Bromwich perished, including cellist Wesley Woodward, from Hill Top, who played in one of the ship&rsquo;s three orchestras.</p>
<p>Among others were William Hipkins, the managing director of Smethwick-based scales manufacturer W.T. Avery, and Leopold Turner, of Church Stretton, who was a second steward killed on his 28th birthday.</p>
<p>The last remaining survivor of the disaster, Millvina Dean, died on May 31, 2009, aged 97. She was two months old at the time of the sinking.</p>
<p>The Titanic lives on in surprising ways. On that maiden voyage, guests had Shropshire sausage on the menu, made to a local recipe. The recipe was revived a few years ago by a butcher near Bridgnorth who won an award for it.</p>
<p>And it continues to capture the imagination. One Shropshire couple had their wedding in 2002 on a Titanic theme, the many touches including a wedding cake looking like the liner.</p>
<p>There have been books and films aplenty, some more successful than others. The 1997 movie with Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio was the most expensive film ever made, and won 11 Oscars.</p>
<p>From time to time there have been schemes to raise the Titanic, an enormous technical challenge to say the least and in any event enthusiasm has considerably diminished since the wreck was found on the sea bed in 1985 and found to be broken up.</p>
<p>There was a 1980 movie called &ldquo;Raise the Titanic,&rdquo; a notoriously expensive flop which gave rise to a famous quote from producer Sir Lew Grade, who commented: &ldquo;It would have been cheaper to lower the Atlantic.&rdquo;
