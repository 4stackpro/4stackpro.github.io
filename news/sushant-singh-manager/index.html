Actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his Mumbai home.</p>
<p>Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his home in Mumbai, police said today, confirming his suicide. He was 34.</p>
<p>The popular actor was recently seen in the film &ldquo;Chhichhore&rdquo; - which dealt with the extreme pressure of college and competitive exams. His last appearance was in the Netflix film &ldquo;Drive&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput had put up a moving post just last week when his former manager Disha Salian was found dead. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s such devastating news,&rdquo; the actor had written on Instagram.</p>
<p>His last post on Instagram was dedicated to his mother, whose death in 2002 left him devastated. &ldquo;Blurred past evaporating from teardrops, unending dreams carving an arc of smile And a fleeting life, negotiating between the two,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>
<p>Rajput, who became a household name with his hit television series &ldquo;Pavitra Rishta&rdquo;, debuted in films in 2013 with the critically acclaimed &ldquo;Kai Po Che!&rdquo; based on Chetan Bhagat&rsquo;s bestselling book &ldquo;The Three Mistakes of My Life&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The movie catapulted Rajput into the big league and he went on to do several films. He also played MS Dhoni in the former skipper&rsquo;s biopic, for which he was nominated for film awards.</p>
<p>He played the eponymous role of Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! in the 2015 thriller. He had a supporting role in Aamir Khan&rsquo;s 2014 hit PK. In 2018, Rajput starred in Kedarnath opposite debutante Sara Ali Khan.</p>
<p>Rajput was born in Patna. He studied engineering and was a National Olympiad Winner in Physics.</p>
<p>He said in interviews that after his involvement in theatre and dance, he rarely had time for studies. He eventually dropped out of engineering just a year short of his degree to pursue an acting career.</p>
<p>A shell-shocked film industry posted tributes on Twitter. &ldquo;Honestly this news has left me shocked and speechless&hellip;I remember watching #SushantSinghRajput in Chhichhore and telling my friend Sajid, its producer how much I&rsquo;d enjoyed the film and wish I&rsquo;d been a part of it. Such a talented actor&hellip;may God give strength to his family,&rdquo; Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No No No!!!!! Horrible heartbreaking news of the passing of #SushantSinghRajput ! Shocking &amp; sad beyond words!!! Goodbye Sushant.. you were such a wonderful performer and had such a long long way to go! Don&rsquo;t know what you were going through but I&rsquo;m sorry for your suffering! Red heart (sic),&rdquo; Swara Bhaskar posted, condoling his death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The news of Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s death is truly sad. What a tragic loss Deepest condolences to his family &amp; loved ones. May his soul find eternal peace,&rdquo; actor Ajay Devgn wrote.</p>
<p>Abhishek Bachchan tweeted: &ldquo;This is just so shocking. A wonderful talent. RIP Sushant&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Last month, death of seasoned actors - Rishi Kapoor and Irrfan Khan - left the country in grief and shock.</p>
