<p>New Delhi: Bollywood’s latest initiative in the fight against coronavirus is a music video featuring several big names like Akshay Kumar, Tiger Shroff, Vicky Kaushal, Kriti Sanon, and Bhumi Pednekar, among others. The song, ‘Muskurayega India’, is an attempt to give hope to Indians amid the testing times of Covid-19.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared the video of the song on Twitter Tuesday morning and wrote: “India will smile again, India will win again.”</p>
<p>फिर मुस्कुराएगा इंडिया… फिर जीत जाएगा इंडिया… India will fight. India will win! Good initiative by our film fraternity. https://t.co/utUGm9ObhI — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) April 7, 2020</p>
<p>The track, created by Jjust Music and Cape of Good Films, opens with a clip of PM Modi’s first televised address to the nation on Covid-19, assuring people of emerging victorious from these trying times.</p>
<p>It was released Monday and has already racked up over 9 lakh views on YouTube. The song is meant to be a “melody of hope” amid the ongoing crisis.</p>
<p>“With the ongoing situation, the citizens of almost every country are forced into isolation. Jjust Music and Cape of Good Films recognises this effort of unity and togetherness, and we would like to appreciate our nation for staying put,” explained the song’s producers.</p>
<p>The video features the Bollywood actors singing along to the track in their respective balconies and terraces as they practice social distancing.</p>

<p>The three minute and 25 second-long song features visuals of hospital beds, doctors, nurses and Mumbai Police officers on-duty. It shows the empty streets and some isolated iconic spots of the country such as Delhi’s India Gate and Jaipur’s Hawa Mahal.</p>
<p>The lyrics of the song are by Kaushal Kishore, with vocals and composition by Vishal Mishra. It includes verses like “Jo saath dede saara India, fir muskurayega India, fir jeet jayega India” (If all of India gives support, then we will smile, then India will win).</p>
<p>Akshay Kumar took to Twitter to share the video and said: “All we need is a united stand”. Similarly, Ayushmann Khurrana said the song was an “effort to spread some love and hope”.</p>
<p>Respected PM @narendramodi Sir. I thank you with my heart full of gratitude for recognising our humble tribute.</p>

<p>Amitabh Bachchan, Rajinikanth, Mohanlal, Prosenjit Chatterjee and other iconic actors have also come together for a made-at-home short film ‘Family’ to spread awareness about the importance of social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Similar to the ‘Muskarayage India’ song, this short film was also shot using videos of all the actors in their respective homes.</p>

WE ARE ONE and WE SHALL OVERCOME ! Jai Hind ! https://t.co/WoquwkSyqT — Amitabh Bachchan (@SrBachchan) April 6, 2020</p>

<p>Last week, South Indian superstar Chiranjeevi shared his own motivational song to battle the coronavirus pandemic. The song, starring Nagarjuna Akkineni, Sai Dharam Tej and Varun Tej among others, plays routinely on DD national now.</p>
<p>With catchy lyrics like “Let’s fight the virus, let’s kill the virus”, Chiranjeevi invited fans to shoot their own videos singing the song and send them across to him. The song, composed by music director Koti, is part of the actor’s #CoronaCrisisCharity — an initiative meant to provide funds for film workers and daily wage earners in the industry hit by the current lockdown.</p>

From clapping for essential workers to lighting candles in solidarity with doctors and nurses, Bollywood celebrities have been doing their part to say thank you to those fighting on the front lines against the coronavirus.</p>
<p>And now, some of India&rsquo;s most renowned actors have appeared in the music video for a song that pays tribute.</p>
<p>Muskurayega India is a new song by composer and singer Vishal Mishra, released on Monday, April 6 as a thank you to India&rsquo;s residents for doing their part to stem the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the ongoing situation, the citizens of almost every country are forced into isolation,&rdquo; a statement on the song&rsquo;s YouTube page reads. &ldquo;Jjust Music and Cape of Good Films recognises this effort of unity and togetherness, and we would like to appreciate our nation for staying put. Amidst every trial that our country is braving currently, we bring to you a melody of hope to bring back the smiles on everyone&rsquo;s faces and keep the spirit of togetherness intact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The video features a number of Bollywood stars lip-syncing to the tune, with lyrics penned by Kaushal Kishore.</p>
<p>Akshay Kumar, Tiger Shroff and Vicky Kaushal are among those to make an appearance, with each filming their clips from their homes.</p>
<p>Ayushmann Khurrana, Kartik Aaryan, Kriti Sanon and Ananya Panday can also be glimpsed in the video, which begins with a clip of P rime M inister Narendra Modi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be hustle and bustle in the cities again, laughter will return in the villages again,&rdquo; Mishra sings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone will dance on the streets again, wheels will be on track and parks will come alive again. If all of India comes together, India will smile again, India will win again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The video is also interspersed with sweeping shot of India, as well as shots of Mumbai police officers asking viewers to support the nation&rsquo;s anti-virus efforts and stay indoors.</p>
<p>The song is the latest initiative in India designed to support those battling Covid-19 and encourage others to do their part in stemming the spread of the virus .</p>
<p>On Sunday, April 5, many around the country lit candles and diyas for nine minutes at 9p m, as part of Modi’s request to show solidarity with healthcare workers.</p>
<p>The movement came just a few weeks after the prime minister urged citizens to show their appreciation for medical workers by clapping from their balconies during the Janata Curfew.</p>
<p>India is currently under a complete lockdown for 21 days, starting from March 25, in an effort to contain the spread of the pandemic. As of today, the country has recorded more than 4,700 cases of Covid-19, with 136 deaths and more than 380 confirmed recoveries.
