An event horse who went missing after she escaped from her field was found safe and well, six days later.</p>
<p>Jennie Brannigan’s five-year-old Keepsake, known as Peekaboo at home, jumped out of her field on 13 March. It is thought she may have been spooked by the wild hogs that live in the neighbouring Florida woods.</p>
<p>Jennie told H&amp;H her grooms found broken fencing and Peekaboo missing, as well as another horse who was then found, on the Friday morning.</p>
<p>“I thought I’d find her right away but drove round for a few hours and couldn’t find her,” she said. “I had five or six horses competing at an event that day, and three or four students, so it was a bit tough to concentrate when I couldn’t find a horse.”</p>
<p>Jennie, who also rode Peekaboo’s dam and sisters, said the mare is somewhat quirky, and she was not surprised she had not stopped nearby, even with all the other horses in local fields.</p>
<p>“My main concern was a quicksand pond next door and we could see evidence she’d jumped into that field but not out of it,” she said.</p>
<p>“I hired a thermal drone and it found a hotspot, about the size of a horse. I was so upset, but then it turned out it was just sand – and Alexa who works for me then found hoofprints where she’d jumped out of the field.”</p>
<p>Jennie put up posters locally appealing for sightings, and eventually people got in touch, one to say he had heard a horse on the road about 2.30am on 13 March, and another who had seen the mare – who was still wearing part of her distinctive rug – in woods near her home.</p>
<p>Continues below…</p>
<p>On 19 March, the team went into the woods and found Peekaboo, who was thin and dehydrated but otherwise unharmed.</p>
<p>“I think she’d just run blindly,” Jennie said. “The woods here are very thick, like jungle, and I think she’d run so far in, she got stuck.</p>
<p>“I think she’d hardly eaten or drunk but she’s fine, she even still had all four shoes on when she came home. It’s a crazy story; I don’t know one other horse who would run past six or seven fields with horses in them, into the woods and be alone without food or water.</p>
<p>“But she’s very unusual, which is what made me hold out some hope. She’s a lovely mare.”</p>

<p>Australian Trainers&rsquo; Association president Robbie Griffiths believes animal welfare should be taken into consideration by the state and Federal Governments if they are looking at closing down the racing industry due to the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bottom line there are 4000 or more thoroughbreds who will still need to be fed and watered and looked after every day so you can&rsquo;t shut the gates on stables completely, as if you did it would become an animal welfare issue. This also applies to harness, greyhound and all living animal operations,&rdquo; Griffiths said.</p>
<p>Griffiths said the training centres acted in a similar manner to quarantine centres as human movement was controlled.</p>
<p>Stream over 50 sports On-Demand with KAYO SPORTS on your TV, computer, mobile or tablet. Just $25/month, no lock-in contract. Get your 14-day free trial and start streaming instantly &gt;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you can&rsquo;t lock the gates on stables. The same people who are with the horses now will still be with them then. You can&rsquo;t close it down. Even if they all go spelling people need to feed them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horses don&rsquo;t carry the virus. Cats and dogs still need to be fed as do horses. We can&rsquo;t afford for the horse&rsquo;s sake to shut the doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another trainer, Natalie Young, also said even if race meetings were stopped she hoped that training centres could stay open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like people at home who can just take their dogs out for a walk. These horses need care and continual work,&rdquo; Young said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We just have to hope that if the worst happens and we can&rsquo;t race that the training centres can stay open. It&rsquo;s not like people at home who can just take their dogs out for a walk. These horses need care and continual work.</p>
<p>Griffiths said racing participants have been extra diligent as they know they&rsquo;ve been privileged to continue racing at a time when many industries have shut.</p>
<p>Horse racing continues to be held wwhile other sports go into a hiatus.</p>
<p>He also believes as participants work in the racing bubble they do not mix with the wider society.</p>
<p>Griffiths said race meetings had a maximum of 150 people on course who were all instructed to stay well clear of each other and were all practising the best hygiene protocols.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As an industry we&rsquo;re doing a great job. We&rsquo;re the third biggest industry in the country and there&rsquo;s a benefit for all if we continue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Griffiths also said workers being in the racing bubble also gave them an advantage over other industries as they stayed to themselves.</p>
<p>Danny O&rsquo;Brien said he hoped racing could go on for the foreseeable future and he pointed out that for those in the industry it was a lifestyle commitment for participants, and as a result, it was the right industry to keep going.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the hours our workers have got it&rsquo;s their life. They work for most of the day in the stables and then they go home and come back early in the morning to start again. 90 per cent of them don&rsquo;t go out so they&rsquo;re not mixing with the general population,&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="do-blockbuster-horse-racing-purses-encourage-cheating">Do blockbuster horse racing purses encourage cheating?</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55c11c68724460d7516307c87a9c5ca60adfb19e/0_130_1876_1126/master/1876.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=0ebdd638d066b4b6d10426d2c4faee43" alt="img">
Dozens of people have been indicted in the US over a widespread doping scandal. Such activity may be inevitable when huge sums are at stake</p>
<p>The child, sitting down with the old man close behind … had been thinking how strange it was that horses who were such fine honest creatures should seem to make vagabonds of all the men they drew about them…</p>
<p>Charles Dickens certainly got that one right. In The Olde Curiosity Shop, the orphaned adolescent Nell and her impoverished grandfather travel to the races at Banbury, in the company of conmen and thieves Condlin and Short. The innocent Nell, observing Condlin pickpocketing the spectators at their puppet show and disappointed at not being able to see the horses, muses on the venality of the humans she sees, a venality so at odds with the majesty of the equines.</p>
<p>Little Nell, we’re with you.</p>
<p>Money may not be the root of all the evil surfacing this week, but the indictments over doping in horse racing announced on Monday have raised questions about whether blockbuster prize money offers not only a big payday for owners and trainers, but also the temptation to win by any means necessary.</p>
<p>Trainer of Maximum Security among dozens hit with doping charge Read more</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the United States Attorney Southern District of New York revealed indictments against 27 people in the racing industry, including trainers, stable staff, and veterinarians. Grade-1 winning trainers Jorge Navarro and Jason Servis are the most prominent of those arrested. They are charged with administering prohibited substances to horses and conspiring with veterinarians to mislabel and conceal the substances.</p>
<p>Servis trains the ironically-named Maximum Security, the horse that made history last year when he crossed the wire first in the Kentucky Derby and was then disqualified, for impeding other horses. The colt made history again just last month, when he won the inaugural Saudi Cup, the world’s richest race, worth $20 million.</p>
<p>Voted last year’s champion 3-year-old, Maximum Security is owned and bred by Gary and Mary West. Prior to the Saudi Cup, Coolmore Stud purchased a 50% interest in the colt. Maximum Security was initially slated to run in the Pegasus World Cup at Gulfstream Park at the end of January, but Gary West changed course when the purse for that race was cut from $9m to $3m, with an additional 2% of the purse being allocated for donations to Thoroughbred retirement programs.</p>
<p>“If a horse owner had a shot to win a $20m race or a race for less than $3m … I am not sure why they would run for less,” he told Thoroughbred Daily News. “If The Stronach Group cares so much about horse aftercare, why in the world would they show their concern by reducing the value of their already enormously-reduced purse for the Pegasus by 2% at the expense of owners and try to tell the racing community that is a benefit to them? Where I come from, that doesn’t even pass the laugh test.”</p>
<p>A year ago, Mary West was said to be worth half a billion dollars; the couple sold their telecommunications company West Corporation for $1.6bn in 2006. Their horses have earned more than $34m. The Saudi Cup alone was worth $10m to Maximum Security’s owners.</p>
<p>Justin Nicholson owns and breeds horses in both the US and the UK, his operation far more modest than the Wests’. “Owning horses is very expensive,” says Nicholson. “We make use of all the legal options available to us with regard to vet work, and when you do proper maintenance of a horse, keeping a horse in training in New York costs about $50,000 to $60,000 a year per horse. The purses in New York are great, but you’ve got to win races and pick up other checks just to cover the bills.”</p>
<p>He describes being at the barns on New York’s backstretches and getting “pitched regularly” by veterinarians. “Vets and salespeople come by, telling you that they’ve got a product that can improve a horse’s performance by two or three lengths,” he says. “That can be the difference between winning and finishing fourth.”</p>
<p>There’s no straight line between high prize money and cheating, and as Nicholson points out, in a sport with declining participation, purses have to be an incentive for owners to continue investing in horses. Yet in 2012, following a series of equine fatalities at Aqueduct Racetrack in New York, the state regulator implemented a rule restricting the ratio of claiming price to purse money in claiming races. Horses could not be entered for a claiming price that was less than 50% of the value of the race, minimizing the incentive for trainers to offer unsound horses in the hope of collecting a share of the purse.</p>
<p>Following that and other safety measures, fatalities in New York dropped significantly. That rule was amended recently to allow that ratio to be disregarded upon request “to be permitted on a case-by-case basis for all or a portion of a race meeting, while requiring the track to meet increased requirements to ensure the competitiveness, soundness, and safety of the horses that enter any such race.”</p>
<p>James Gagliano is president and chief operating office of The Jockey Club, the organization that maintains the stud book in the US and that engaged the services of private investigators four years ago to look into the possibility of doping at US racetracks, an investigation that led to this week’s indictments.</p>
<p>Gagliano doesn’t necessarily see a connection between purses and illegal behavior, though he did suggest that racetracks might reconsider how they allocate funds, especially given the notoriously lax security standards at most racetracks. Few stables are equipped with security cameras, and there are few physical barriers to anyone who really wants to get to a stable area.</p>
<p>“We need to ensure that that the competition is good, and that horses and riders are safer,” he says. “Our standards and our regulations are not good enough. Penalties have to be a deterrent, and people have to know that if they violate the regulations, they’re really risking something.”
