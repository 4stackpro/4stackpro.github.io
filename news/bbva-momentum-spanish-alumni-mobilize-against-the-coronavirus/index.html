Donations, technology solutions, finance for other entrepreneurs, pro bono services, etc. In the midst of the coronavirus, BBVA Momentum businesses are giving their all in order to help the many people who need support now more than ever. Some of the initiatives the have stepped up to fight the pandemic include:</p>
<p>Inithealth CoronaCare</p>
<p>The health management platform, Inithealth, developed by Init Group, has launched Inithealth CoronaCare, which provides a remote full-service diagnosis and management service for COVID-19 patients. Init Group has made the solution available to public and private health care providers in order to both help prevent the collapse of the health system and to support the vast majority of the community under quarantine.</p>
<p>The service consists of an end-user application that allows people to identify their risk profile and conduct a remote diagnosis by entering data such as medical history, lifestyle habits, and current symptoms. Using this information, the application will create a personalized plan of care that will be adjusted to updates the user provides on his or her state of health.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Inithealth CoronaCare provides medical and health care workers an IT platform that streamlines the process of managing and following up with patients who are recovering at home. It also caters for the integration of a team of medical health workers operating under the supervision of the service’s medical chief in order to remotely track cases, tend to residents, use alerts to identify changes in conditions, and follow protocols defined for each situation (home-based emergencies, hospital admittances, etc.)

<p>The current crisis represents an unprecedented risk to the U.S. economy, as the coronavirus has created a confluence of supply- and demand-side shocks coupled with a financial meltdown</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Direct economic impact should be large but temporary assuming a spring or early summer virus peak</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second-round effects from the financial meltdown to the real economy could imply a deeper shock and a slower recovery</p>

<p>HOUSTON, March 30, 2020 /PRNewswire/ &ndash; According to the publication released from BBVA Research, When will the U.S. economy recover from the infection? , the experience of countries that have transitioned beyond the worst phase of the pandemic suggest that the number of coronavirus cases in the U.S. could peak in the spring or early summer.</p>
<p>BBVA&rsquo;s new logo (PRNewsfoto/BBVA) More</p>
<p>The supply-side shock brought about by the pandemic is forcing factories to close, resulting in cutbacks in the provision of products and services, as well as lower labor force participation and productivity. That being said, advances in technology have increased firms&rsquo; and employees&rsquo; ability to operate remotely and remain productive, while innovations in on-line delivery and direct to consumer shipping supply chains (e.g. Amazon) could soften part of the impact on the supply side for the consumer, according to the BBVA Research team.</p>
<p>The paper&rsquo;s authors, BBVA chief economist Nathaniel Karp, along with senior economists Boyd Nash-Stacey and Marcial Nava, also noted that monetary and fiscal policy responses, while not well equipped to contain the effects of supply-side shocks, can be effective at mitigating the drop in demand and the stress in the financial sector.</p>
<p>Karp added that, from a behavioral perspective, COVID-19 could have long-term implications, including increased reliance on virtual technology for activities such as e-schooling and telecommuting. Innovation and entrepreneurship could also expand in such areas as food security, smart transportation, healthcare and sustainability.</p>
<p>The report goes on to note potential impacts to government, globalization, and the flow of goods and services. For more details, read the full report here .</p>
