The MMA world has seen hundreds of reactions after UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov confirmed that his title fight against Tony Ferguson stands canceled. Many fighters and fans have come out with bitter reactions to this news. Conor McGregor is one of them.</p>
<p>Initially, UFC President Dana White was looking to organize the fight behind closed doors in an undisclosed location. However, Khabib’s inability to leave Russia has thrown a wrench in those plans. Heavy restrictions on travel in and out of countries has forced Khabib aground in Russia.</p>
<p>Conor McGregor recently took to Twitter to declare Tony Ferguson as the winner, after the deadlock between the two fighters with respect to pulling out of the fight was broken by Khabib.</p>
<p>“The fact of this matter is, both Tony and Khabib where engaged in a game of chicken here towards the fight bell. With Khabib chickening out first. Making it 3-2 in pullouts in Tony’s favor. Khab scurried out of the U.S to home, and amid the crisis. Very high risk. Congrats Tony.”- Conor McGregor</p>
<p>The fact of this matter is, both Tony and Khabib where engaged in a game of chicken here towards the fight bell. With Khabib chickening out first. Making it 3-2 in pullouts in Tony’s favour. Khab scurried out of the U.S to home, and amid the crisis. Very high risk.</p>
<p>Congrats Tony. — Conor McGregor (@TheNotoriousMMA) April 2, 2020</p>
<p>The UFC has tried to book this fight on four occasions in the last five years. But as the fight week nears complications like health issues and injuries arise on one side and the fight has to be done away with.</p>
<p>The first fight between the two was booked in 2015, a broken rib sidelined the Russian fighter. Khabib at that point started contemplating retirement if his body was unable to make a complete recovery. The following year saw the fight getting canceled after Ferguson pulled the plug.</p>
<p>UFC 209 was looking to feature an interim title bout between the two fighters. However, a weight cutting issue sidelined Khabib at the last moment.</p>
<p>Crazy Prediction Made by Conor McGregor Comes True</p>
<p>The Irishman made a bizarre prediction back in January that the fight between Khabib and Ferguson will not take place. It seems unlikely that The Notorious One expected the fight to be scrapped under these circumstances. His prediction has come true nonetheless.</p>
<p>“We’ve tried to do this fight many, many times. Conor believes it won’t happen. Conor wanted to do this fight[vs Donald Cerrone] at 170 because he wants to turn right around and jump right in and fight Khabib if that fight doesn’t happen.”- Dana White on McGregor’s predictions</p>
<p>This crazy prediction has earned McGregor the nickname, “Magic Mac”.

<h3 id="mcgregor-knocked-back-in-clothing-trademark-scrap">McGregor knocked back in clothing trademark scrap</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.rasset.ie/000fa641-1600.jpg" alt="img">
Mixed martial arts superstar Conor McGregor&rsquo;s bid to cash in on his brand across the European Union has suffered a major blow.</p>
<p>This follows the European Union Intellectual Property Office at Alicante in Spain rejecting Mr McGregor’s application to register the name &lsquo;Conor McGregor’ as a trademark for the sale of clothing across the EU.</p>
<p>EUIPO has turned down the application by the MMA star’s McGregor Sports &amp; Entertainment Ltd after upholding an objection by a Dutch clothing firm, Schiphol-based McGregor IP BV against the application.</p>
<p>The Dutch company sells clothing and accessories under the ‘McGREGOR’ brand and told the EUIPO that consumers might believe that goods sold by Conor McGregor’s firm are part of products marketed by the company.</p>
<p>In the ruling, EUIPO has rejected Conor McGregor’s trademark application for the sale of clothing, footwear and headgear but can proceed for the remaining goods and services sought.</p>
<p>The EU trademark office refused the trademark for clothing due to the likelihood of confusion amongst the public concerning the proposed Conor McGregor brand and the DD McGregor brand used by McGregor IP BV.</p>
<p>The office stated that it does not share the Conor McGregor company’s opinion that the names in conflict show significant differences in terms of their lengths and overall composition.</p>
<p>The office also found, contrary to the Conor McGregor company’s opinion, that the trademark signs of the applicant and the Dutch opponent &ldquo;are visually and aurally similar to an average degree&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In adjudicating on the contest, the EU office found it appropriate to focus on the public in the Netherlands, Finland and the Scandinavian countries, where it stated consumers have a basic understanding of English.</p>
<p>The EU office state that the registered and proposed trademarks coincide in an unusual family name.</p>
<p>The office found that there is a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public in the Netherlands, Finland and the Scandinavian countries and a likelihood of confusion for only part of the relevant public of the EU is sufficient to reject the contested application.</p>
<p>The office also has ordered the McGregor company to pay the fees and costs incurred by the Dutch company in the action.</p>
<p>The McGregor company now has the option of appealing the decision.</p>
<p>The decision follows a three year battle between Conor McGregor&rsquo;s MESL and McGregor IP concerning the proposed trademark.</p>
<p>MESL lodged the application in January 2017 and the Dutch firm gave notice that it was objecting to the trademark four months later.</p>
<p>The Dutch company states that it acquired the complete McGREGOR trademark portfolio and all other McGregor intellectual property rights on 15 October 2017 - two months after Conor McGregor’s fight with Floyd Mayweather.</p>
<p>McGregor IP relaunched the McGREGOR brand in the European market.</p>
<p>It explained that the McGREGOR branded products are being sold under license from McGregor IP through &lsquo;bricks and mortar&rsquo; stores and online within the EU.</p>
<p>The Dutch firm stated that the overall impression produced by the proposed &lsquo;Conor McGregor&rsquo; trademark may lead the public to believe that the goods at issue derive, at the very least, from companies which are linked economically, in which case the likelihood of confusion must be held to be established.</p>
<p>In response lawyers for Conor McGregor denied that the two brands would be confused.</p>
<p>In a six page rebuttal submission to the EUIPO last Autumn, the Dublin-based European patent and trademark experts FR Kelly state that the trademark application by the Conor McGregor company differs by the fact that it contains the forename &lsquo;Conor&rsquo;, which is not present in the trademarks of McGregor IP BV.</p>
<p>The solicitors stated that when the two trademarks are compared in their entirety the differences are such that the consumer would not mistakenly believe that the goods sold originate from the Dutch McGregor company.</p>
<p>The legal firm stated that &ldquo;the clear and obvious differences&rdquo; between the trademark of the Conor McGregor company and those of the Dutch McGregor company &ldquo;are such that there would be no likelihood of confusion&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The decision is Mr McGregor’s second setback at the EU trademark office.</p>
<p>In 2018, Mr McGregor&rsquo;s withdrew a trademark application for his planned &lsquo;Notorious&rsquo; whiskey brand after he faced opposition from a Carlow brewer, which had already secured the trademark for one of its beers.</p>
<p>Mr McGregor subsequently launched his whiskey, settling on his second choice name, ‘Proper No Twelve’.

<h3 id="watch-when-conor-mcgregor-took-on-the-mountain-from-game-of-thrones">Watch: When Conor McGregor Took On The Mountain From Game Of Thrones</h3>
<p><img src="https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/20200401213449/Conor-McGregor-vs.-The-Mountain-4.jpg" alt="img">
Hafpor Julius Bjornsson is remembered as Game of Thrones’ Ser Gregor ‘The Mountain’ Clegane. He is a professional strongman who was the first to win the “Arnold Strongman Classic”, “Europe’s Strongest Man” and “World’s Strongest Man” in the same calendar year. UFC fighter Conor McGregor decided to engage in a sparring session with “The Mountain that rides.”</p>
<p>Conor McGregor vs ‘The Mountain’</p>
<p>Celebrities have been vocal about taking on ‘The Notorious’ regularly. One official bout saw Conor entering a boxing ring to take on Floyd Mayweather Jr. That was no friendly contest, but after watching the closed doors sparring bout between The Irishman and Bjornsson, fans can heave a sigh of relief. Undoubtedly, ‘The Notorious’ would not meet the same fate as ‘The Viper.’</p>
<p>There were striking similarities between the two. They both were fast and had ‘The Mountain’ swinging wildly. The Irishman spent time dancing around his opponent, taking jabs at his midsection. For a split second, fans assumed the worst as ‘The Notorious’ was trapped in the bigger man’s humongous arms. However, McGregor twisted out of his hold gracefully. 70 seconds into the session ‘The Notorious’ left leg was trapped but he once again wriggled out without any punishment.</p>
<p>The friendly sparring session ended with the duo embracing each other. At one point, the two even exchanged high fives after.</p>
<p>Bjornsson let Conor out of the corner quite often. Neither of them were causing serious damage to the other. The jabs were light for their standards. Eventually, ‘the Notorious’ managed to bring his foe to his knees for a mock submission.</p>
<p>People say he would have been squashed, had Bjornsson known how to fight. But, would a fight have happened if it was so? Also, what’s to say that ‘Notorious’ himself wouldn’t have unleashed a few more ferocious strikes rather than just amble along. The fight is five years old, but it is a fun watch in days like these where sports are on an enforced break.</p>
<p>What’s Next for ‘The Notorious’</p>
<p>While dream fights are always on the cards with McGregor, his next one could potentially see him take on Khabib Nurmagomedov. Reports suggest ‘The Notorious’ will fight the winner of UFC 249’s Nurmagomedov vs Ferguson. There is an alarming amount of uncertainty regarding the event. However, the latest reports suggest that Russia may allow private flights to the United States. The news handed a lifeline to the mega event, whose future was in jeopardy due to the Coronavirus pandemic.
