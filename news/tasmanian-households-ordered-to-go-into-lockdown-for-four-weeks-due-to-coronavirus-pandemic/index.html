coronavirus,</p>
<p>All Tasmanians will need to stay at home for the next four weeks under new requirements from the state government to fight coronavirus spread. Premier Peter Gutwein said people would need to be at home unless they were going to work, school, getting exercise or essential supplies, or providing or receiving medical or compassionate care. &ldquo;You will be committing an offence if you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said on Monday. &ldquo;Our police will ensure they will enforce this. &ldquo;You will be able to be arrested; you will be charged and summonsed.&rdquo; Mr Gutwein said order would be in place for a month from Tuesday and reviewed over that time. Coronavirus: All the latest updates on COVID-19 for Tasmania People can attend a particular location if they have a reasonable excuse for being there. Mr Gutwein acknowledged the new measures would be difficult for many to manage. &ldquo;Many countries that you look at around the world that are struggling with the challenges of COVID-19 did not take steps early enough,&rdquo; Mr Gutwein said. &ldquo;As a result, they found themselves having to go to a full economic and social shutdown.&rdquo; The tightened restrictions come after a federal government restriction on gatherings. These will be capped at two people aside from funerals and marriages. Labor leader Rebecca White said Labor supported the government&rsquo;s move to impose stronger lockdowns. &ldquo;We realise it is a pretty disruptive time for people but we need to act swiftly and we&rsquo;ve been calling for urgent action,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There is no government across the world that has regretted taking action early but they sure have regretted not taking action when they had the chance.&rdquo; Ms White said many businesses wanted to be shut down by the government as they had a mistaken belief they would not receive support if they made the decision to close themselves. IN OTHER NEWS: &ldquo;Many of them are seeing a huge drop in customer activity and many are worried about the health and safety implications of remaining open,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Yet they&rsquo;re staying open because they don&rsquo;t believe they have an alternative.&rdquo; Greens health spokeswoman Rosalie Woodruff said questioned remained on how physical distancing would be applied in certain sectors. &ldquo;It is unclear whether it applies to building and construction and retail,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Those businesses need further clarity about if, or how, they can operate to ensure transmission of coronavirus cannot occur.&rdquo; Mr Gutwein said he would talk more on any new restrictions on business trade at Tuesday&rsquo;s media briefing.</p>

<p>8.30pm: STATE RECORDS THREE MORE CORONAVIRUS CASES</p>
<p>THREE new cases of coronavirus were recorded in Tasmania on Monday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the state to 69.</p>
<p>One of the new cases is a close contact of a known case, another recently arrived from overseas, while the third was a cruise ship passenger.</p>
<p>Director of Public Health Dr Mark Veitch said all three cases were women</p>
<p>“Two are from southern Tasmania and one is from the North-West,” he said.</p>
<p>Dr Veitch said Public Health Services continued to investigate two cases in the Devonport area to determine their source of infection. It is thought these may be the first cases of community transmission in the state.</p>

<p>7.30pm: TASSIE MATES’ DRAMA-FILLED TRIP HOME</p>
<p>THE Israeli military came to the rescue of two Tasmanian travellers stranded in South America in a drama-filled story of escape amid the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>During the ordeal, Izaac Gardner and Gus Goodwolf, both 22, also hitchhiked in an animal transport truck and endured a tense eight-hour covert bus trip through Bolivia in darkness.</p>
<p>The Hobartians were on a seven-month cycling tour of the continent when the global spread of the deadly virus brought their adventure to an abrupt halt.</p>
<p>It left them in a desperate race against the clock to secure safe passage back to Australia, as Bolivia moved to introduced a nationwide lockdown.</p>

<p>7.10pm: GP CLINICS STILL OPEN FOR ‘EVERYDAY PROBLEMS’</p>
<p>TASMANIANS are being urged to continue making doctors’ appointments for “regular health issues” as reports increase of people leaving problems unaddressed due to coronavirus fears.</p>
<p>Dr John Kruimink said it was important to have “safe spaces” where people could continue to talk to a doctor and be physically assessed.</p>
<p>“We’re starting to get the feeling that people think we’re too busy to be dealing with normal, everyday problems,” he said.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure people are keeping on top of their regular health issues, because the reality is that COVID-19 probably isn’t going away next week, or even next month, and to indefinitely delay your general health has certainly got risks.</p>
<p>“We think it’s very important that people engage more with their doctor at the moment, not less.”</p>

<p>6.50pm: CAMPGROUND GROUP FACING LEGAL ACTION</p>
<p>A GROUP of 10 people will face legal action after entering a restricted area at an East Coast camp ground on Sunday.</p>
<p>It follows Tasmania Police conducting over 1300 compliance checks for COVID-19 restrictions between 6pm on March 25 and 3pm on Monday on people in quarantine across the state.</p>
<p>A number of non-compliance cases also remain under active investigation.</p>
<p>Police also conducted a number of checks of businesses and in public places across the state, including malls, shopping centres and beaches.</p>

<p>6.12pm: CORONAVIRUS SET TO SHUT DOWN VFL PLAN</p>
<p>CORONAVIRUS appears set to claim another victim in Tasmania’s VFL team.</p>
<p>AFL Tasmania says a return to the VFL is still on the table, despite the health and future of all state leagues to be unknown until after the passing of its own deadline.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, AFL Tasmania chief executive Trisha Squires said a decision on the state’s VFL re-entry must be made by May following the Tasmanian AFL Taskforce’s recommendation the Devils should not join the Victorian state league without a provisional AFL licence.</p>
<p>However, since then the coronavirus crisis has seen all state leagues, including the VFL and TSL, postponed until at least May 31, and even this date appears optimistic.</p>

<p>5.30pm: TASMANIANS ORDERED TO STAY AT HOME</p>
<p>GATHERINGS of more than two people have been banned from midnight on Monday night and Tasmanians have been ordered to stay at home for the next four weeks or face arrest and heavy fines.</p>
<p>The new rules were intended to avoid a “full lockdown” due to the coronavirus, Premier Peter Gutwein said.</p>
<p>The only exceptions will be for people going out to buy essential supplies, going to school or work, or to exercise or check on neighbours or elderly relatives or members of the same household.</p>

<p>4.25pm: PM ANNOUNCES EXTRAORDINARY $130B JOBS PACKAGE</p>
<p>Workers will be kept in their jobs with fortnightly $1500 government-funded payments in an extraordinary $130 billion bid to keep Australia’s economy afloat.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the new “JobKeeper” payment would support as many as six million Australians over the next six months.</p>
<p>The scheme will provide a flat payment to workers — rather than proportional wage subsidies for people on different incomes.</p>

<p>4pm: FIRST AIR PASSENGERS PLACED IN QUARANTINE</p>
<p>THE first group of airline passengers to be detained in government-operated quarantine facilities have been placed in isolation in a Hobart hotel.</p>
<p>Passengers aboard an 11.55am Jetstar flight from Melbourne were loaded onto two buses after arriving.</p>
<p>The flight was the first to arrive in the capital since the State Government imposed tough new restrictions on non-essential arriving passengers.</p>
<p>The passengers were taken to the nearby Travelodge hotel at Cambridge under police guard.</p>

<p>3.20pm: CHILDCARE SECTOR FEARS INDUSTRY COLLAPSE</p>
<p>TASMANIA’S childcare sector is “bleeding” and government support is urgently needed to rescue it in the wake of unprecedented impacts from the coronavirus, state officials say.</p>
<p>Centres are facing downturns of up to 90 per cent due to job losses and government advice for people to stay home, Early Childhood Australia Tasmanian president Ros Cornish said.</p>
<p>“The sector is bleeding and we need support, we need it now,” she told the Mercury.</p>
<p>“Every day we stay open is another day viability is impacted because of the downturn and the ability to reopen later on when the crisis is over is being compromised.</p>
<p>“We need urgent help. Some of our members said they can’t pay wage bills this week and they’ll have to close.</p>

<p>METRO Tasmania is offering free travel for two weeks in a bid to reduce cash transactions and increase staff and passenger safety.</p>

<p>12.55pm: LOCK THE STATE DOWN, SCIENTISTS WARN</p>
<p>BIOSTATISTICIANS have warned that Tasmania, with its current rate of COVID-19 infection growth, could reach 500 cases as soon as April and run out of intensive care bed capacity once that number hit 1000.</p>
<p>Megan Higgie and Ben Phillips said Tasmania was currently doubling its COVID-19 cases every 3.4 days, and could have between 215 and 581 coronavirus cases by April 6.</p>
<p>With only 50 ICU beds available for a ballpark 5 per cent of infected people who become critically ill with the virus, Dr Higgie warned Tasmania could soon reach peak hospital capacity once the state had 1000 cases.</p>

<p>12.40pm: STATE SET FOR INCREASED LOCKDOWN MEASURES</p>
<p>FURTHER lockdown measures in Tasmania are imminent, with Premier Peter Gutwein intending to take steps to stay in line with measures being taken in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland.</p>
<p>More than 1000 quarantine compliance checks have been completed, with about 98 per cent of people found to be complying. However there is a possibility some people may be charged, with interviews underway.</p>
<p>Mr Gutwein again urged Tasmanians to stay at home, after many people headed out of their suburbs and to the beach on Saturday.</p>
<p>“Travelling between your home and your shack increases the risk in these communities,” he said.</p>
<p>Health Minister Sarah Courtney said investigations were continuing into two of the state’s positive cases in the Devonport area, including the healthcare worker from the Mersey Community Hospital.</p>
<p>People living in the area are urged to strictly follow social distancing guidelines and to stay at home unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>About 1800 tests have been completed in the state.</p>

<p>11.30am: BUSINESSES WORKING OUT NEW BATTLE PLANS</p>
<p>LIFE as a small business operator can be tough at the best of times.</p>
<p>But local business owners in the retail, hospitality, food, fitness and arts industries are now being threatened by a global health crisis.</p>
<p>Hobart fitness instructor Hannah McDonald is among the savvy business owners adapting and evolving to meet the challenges of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Ms McDonald – who runs Burn Theory, a boxing and barre studio in Mathers Lane in the Hobart CBD – has devised what she’s calling the “corona battle plan”.</p>
<p>Concerned that members were struggling to make it to classes due to working from home and self-isolation, she came up with a plan to bring her studio to Tassie living rooms.</p>

<p>10.20am: PM TO UNVEIL $1.1 BILLION MENTAL HEALTH PACKAGE</p>
<p>AUSTRALIANS will be able to access vital medical and mental health services in their own home using their telephone, as part of a billion dollar boost to save lives.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison will today unveil a $1.1 billion package, with hundreds of millions of dollars flowing to mental health and domestic violence support services as well as frontline charities.</p>
<p>The bulk of the money — $669 million — will fund Medicare-subsidised telehealth services for all Australians for six months, freeing up GP waiting rooms and hospitals and allowing the sick to access care.</p>
<p>To tackle the second wave of the coronavirus, Australians suffering mental health concerns or domestic violence will also have greater access to support services.</p>

<p>9am: AUSSIE HOSPITALS TO SHUT</p>
<p>AUSTRALIAN private and Catholic hospitals are about to be closed and their staff stood down, putting 100,000 workers out of a job, just as the hospital system is about to buckle under the weight of coronavirus admissions.</p>
<p>The catastrophe is the result of a failure of state and federal governments to come up with a financial solution for the hospitals after they banned non-elective surgery at a national cabinet meeting earlier this week.</p>

<p>9.20am: SECOND DEAD AS PREMIER REITERATES LOCKDOWN LAWS</p>
<p>ANOTHER person has died from COVID-19 in Tasmania.</p>
<p>Premier Peter Gutwein in his morning press conference said an elderly man being cared for at the Royal Hobart Hospital has passed away.</p>
<p>Mr Gutwein reiterated the need for Tasmanians to obey the strict new lockdown measures, which include only two people out together in public and not leaving the house.</p>
<p>“Now that we’ve had unfortunately our second dead, there is a message in that for all of us.</p>
<p>“This virus is deadly, this virus will kill you, take the necessary steps.</p>
<p>“Social distancing and abiding by the rules will save your life &hellip; stay home and save lives.”</p>
<p>Health Minister Sarah Courtney said the man who died at the Royal Hobart Hospital was in his 80s.</p>
<p>“I’m advised that both deaths we have had travelled on the Ruby Princess,” she said.</p>
<p>The cause of two cases of coronavirus from the state’s north remain unknown with investigations continuing while 10 people have fully recovered.</p>
<p>Director of Public Health Dr Mark Veitch said testing will be expanded to general practices and emergency departments in an effort to quash any potential community transmission.</p>
<p>“We picked up the two people in the Devonport area through existing (testing) mechanisms but now we’re expanding testing to see if there is evidence of community transmission,” he said.</p>
<p>The three latest cases of coronavirus, announced late last night were all women.</p>
<p>One was a close contact of another coronavirus patient, one was a traveller recently returned from overseas and the last was a passenger on a cruise ship.</p>
