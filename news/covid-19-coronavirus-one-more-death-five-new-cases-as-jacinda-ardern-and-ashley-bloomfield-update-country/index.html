There is one more death and five new cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand, according to director general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield.</p>
<p>And as New Zealand comes to the end of its more than four-week level 4 lockdown, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern had some good news for the country.</p>
<p>Covid-19 has currently been eliminated.</p>
<p>Today was the eighth day in a row where the number of new Covid-19 cases has been in the single digits.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Asked about the low number of new cases, Bloomfield said: &ldquo;That does give us confidence that we have achieved our goal of elimination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, he pointed out that elimination never meant zero – &ldquo;but it does mean we know where our cases are coming from&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He said that the Government&rsquo;s goal has been elimination, not eradication – whereby the virus is completely stamped out in New Zealand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think about alert level 4, I would say we have achieved, through alert level 4, the position we wanted to be in so that we could now start to, move down alert levels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ardern was also optimistic – asked if New Zealand had eliminated Covid-19, she replied &ldquo;currently&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But she pointed out that the next challenge for the Government was Covid-19&rsquo;s tail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elimination means we may well reach zero, but we may well then have small numbers of cases coming up again,&rdquo; she told media this afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t mean we have failed, it just means that we&rsquo;re in the position to have that zero-tolerance approach to have very aggressive management of those cases and keep those numbers low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Bloomfield said he was confident New Zealand can go into alert level 3 safely.</p>
<p>Ardern said NZ was 11 hours away from leaving the &ldquo;strictest&rdquo; constraints in NZ&rsquo;s modern history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did. And we did it together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She praised Bloomfield: &ldquo;I think we are lucky to have a public servant of Dr Bloomfield&rsquo;s calibre leading the health response and I have very much enjoyed sharing a podium with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The person who died was a woman in her 90s at St Margaret&rsquo;s Hospital.</p>
<p>She had a number of underlying health conditions and was the third person in that cluster to die.</p>
<p>She was the 19th person to die from coronavirus-related causes in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Waitematā DHB released a statement following the death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thoughts and prayers of Waitematā DHB&rsquo;s staff and management are with the patients family and friends at this difficult time. We are all saddened by their loss and ask that the family&rsquo;s privacy is respected as they mourn the passing of their loved one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bloomfield said the Government was looking into testing changes it can make in terms of aged residential facilities - not just for the residents, but also staff.</p>
<p>In terms of the new cases, one is new and four are probable cases.</p>
<p>Three are linked to St Margaret&rsquo;s Hospital, with two linked to other cases.</p>
<p>Some cases &lsquo;reclassified&rsquo;</p>
<p>Six cases that were probable have been reclassified, meaning the national total is 1469.</p>
<p>Bloomfield said some public health units were reviewing some probable cases and that was why some classifications have changed.</p>
<p>The ministry would continue to do this, he said.</p>
<p>There is only one case in New Zealand that is still being investigated.</p>
<p>Bloomfield said the case was in Tauranga and while there was a &ldquo;strong suspicion&rdquo; of a potential link, it had not been confirmed.</p>
<p>In response to a request for further information about the case, including when they tested positive and how many people were working on the investigation, a Ministry of Health spokesperson said no further information about the individual would be released at this stage.</p>
<p>Bloomfield said there would be ongoing monitoring of confirmed cases.</p>
<p>Active management of cases means there are daily phone calls to those infected.</p>
<p>He said a new Health Act order comes into effect tonight, when New Zealand goes into alert level 3.</p>

<p>He reminded anyone with health needs to not delay seeking help through GPs, or to contact Healthline.</p>
<p>He said there was no doubt some people&rsquo;s treatment has been delayed in alert level 4.</p>
<p>Going into alert level 3, the treatment of people with cancer will be prioritised.</p>
<p>There were almost 3000 tests yesterday, and about 123,000 in total. So far, 1180 people have recovered - about 80 per cent of the cases in NZ.</p>
<p>Seven people are in hospital.</p>
<p>Contact tracing &lsquo;scaled up significantly&rsquo;</p>
<p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said NZ was 11 hours away from leaving the &ldquo;strictest&rdquo; constraints in NZ&rsquo;s modern history.</p>
<p>Ardern said contact tracing has been scaled up &ldquo;significantly&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Government can make up to 10,000 calls a day.</p>
<p>Bloomfield said at the moment the ministry can trace 185 cases a day and that will be scaled up to 300 a day.</p>
<p>He said New Zealand was in the &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; the Government was after.</p>
<p>He said it was important that people recall where they have been, and made a note of that.</p>
<p>That would help with contact tracing, he said.</p>
<p>This is all the more important in alert level 3, as people&rsquo;s contact with others expands, Bloomfield said.</p>
<p>On a possible contact tracing app, Ardern said it was not a replacement for limiting human contact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are frailties to the system,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>But the Government is working on it.</p>
<p>Asked for a timeline, she said &ldquo;soon,&rdquo; but the first iteration probably won&rsquo;t include using Bluetooth, she said.</p>
<p>Ardern said there &ldquo;may well&rdquo; be some similarities between the planned NZ contract tracing app, and the one in place in Australia.</p>
<p>She said she remains a bit sceptical about what these types of apps can deliver.</p>
<p>The apps only work if there is high uptake, she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does have its limitations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cannot rely on this, we cannot place all our eggs in one basket,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Ardern said there is strong evidence NZ does not have strong community transmission.</p>
<p>She said NZ can process up to 8000 tests a day - one of the highest testing per capita in the world.</p>
<p>Ardern said people should pause to digest the country&rsquo;s low number of confirmed Covid-19 cases.</p>
<p>She said that, without the lockdown, there would have been more than 1000 cases a day.</p>
<p>She said this shows why the lockdown was necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have avoided the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it is tragic that NZ has lost 19 people, she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We send you our love at your time of loss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This has been one of the hardest elements of level 4,&rdquo; she said, of people not being able to be with loved ones when they die.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must hunt down the last few cases &hellip; this is like a needle in a haystack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said level 3 &ldquo;will not be a return to pre-Covid life&rdquo;.</p>
<p>She called on the &ldquo;team of five million&rdquo; to make sure the country does not have a second wave.</p>
<p>Level 3 risks: &lsquo;We can only do this if we continue to pull together&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ardern said in order to make a move to alert level 2 in two weeks, there will need to be a confidence that there is no community transmission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can only do this if we continue to pull together. If we need to stay at level 3 [for longer] we will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ardern said in level 3 there are new risks - namely people coming into more contact with others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are opening up the economy, but we&rsquo;re not opening up people&rsquo;s social lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ardern said she was expecting 400,000 people to return to work tomorrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think about our local businesses, they need our support,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Asked what takeaway she was most looking forward to, she said she was most looking forward to the chance to support small businesses.</p>
<p>Ardern said the Government hasn&rsquo;t put down &ldquo;trigger points&rdquo; when it comes to numbers, as to whether New Zealand would go back to level 4.</p>
<p>She said New Zealand needed to continue to be vigilant.</p>
<p>She encouraged people who are flatting to think carefully before expanding their bubbles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do need to think cautiously, and act cautiously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Asked about universities charging students for rooms that they&rsquo;re not living in, Ardern called for compassion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to see humanity,&rdquo; she said, although she admitted she needed more detail on the specifics.</p>
<p>The Government will continue to support Kiwi businesses hit by Covid-19, she said.</p>
<p>Cabinet will meet tomorrow at 10am.</p>
<p>Today will be the last day of daily joint press conferences - the ministry will continue to deliver them from now, she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I consider NZ to be very lucky to have a public servant like Dr Bloomfield&rdquo; leading the Covid-19 charge, Ardern said.</p>
<p>She said working with him has been a &ldquo;real honour&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Ardern urged Kiwis to remember the rules of level 3.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our goal is elimination. That doesn&rsquo;t mean eradication&rsquo;</p>
<p>Asked if NZ was on the brink of elimination, Bloomfield said &ldquo;it gives us confidence that we have achieved out goal of elimination&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But he said testing will continue to identify new cases.</p>
<p>He said the ministry will be &ldquo;quite systematic&rdquo; when it comes to any new testing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our goal is elimination. That doesn&rsquo;t mean eradication.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ardern said she was confident the country had achieved that goal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to reduce our vigilance one bit,&rdquo; Bloomfield added.</p>
<p>In fact, he said people&rsquo;s vigilance needed to increase at level 3.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may well reach zero,&rdquo; Ardern said, adding that it was likely there would still be a small number of new cases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This does not mean we have failed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Transtasman bubble?</p>
<p>In terms of the transtasman bubble, Ardern said that was something she was talking about with Australian PM Scott Morrison.</p>
<p>But we&rsquo;re not there yet, Ardern said.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s something officials are working on, she confirmed.</p>
<p>She said it was &ldquo;very likely&rdquo; that NZ citizens in Australia can come home soon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is something we can consider,&rdquo; she said, but added it needed to be done safely.</p>
<p>Asked if marae could be used to house some people who were homeless at the moment, Ardern said the Government would continue to work with Māori on this issue.</p>
<p>Bloomfield said hospitals in level 3 would start easing into elective surgeries.</p>
<p>But it would be done safely, he said.</p>
<p>Bloomfield said that &ldquo;under no circumstances&rdquo; should people be injecting themselves with disinfectant.</p>
<p>Ardern did not want to comment on US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s comments made a few days ago.</p>
<p>But she said she was not worried about New Zealanders doing this and there has been no reported cases of people doing this here.</p>
<p>When Bloomfield was asked about it, he was stunned into silence for several seconds.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s update came as the number of new Covid-19 cases has remained in single digits for more than a week now.</p>
<p>There were nine new cases confirmed yesterday and no new Covid-19 related deaths.</p>
<p>Despite the optimistic numbers, both Bloomfield and Ardern have warned against complacency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our marathon will take patience and endurance but we need to finish what we started,&rdquo; Ardern told the Herald yesterday.</p>
<p>Bloomfield said that as the country prepares to move to alert level 3 on Tuesday morning, it&rsquo;s really important not to &ldquo;slacken off the effort&rdquo;.</p>
<p>After more than four weeks at alert level 4, at 11.59pm tonight New Zealand will shift into level 3.</p>
<p>The country will stay at this alert level for at least two weeks.</p>
<p>Ardern has previously warned that level 3 and level 4 are quite similar and people need to remain vigilant.</p>
<p>One of the major differences between the two alert levels is access to takeaways and stores which operate a click-and-collect system.</p>
<p>Fast-food outlets have been preparing for the influx of customers come Tuesday.</p>
<p>As New Zealand comes out of level 4 lockdown, there are still a number of countries around the world which have heavy quarantine restrictions.</p>
<p>There have been 2.95 million cases of Covid-19 worldwide, with more than 200,000 deaths.</p>
<p>So far, 861,000 people have recovered – less than a third of the number of people who have the virus.</p>
<p>But in New Zealand, the recovery rate is almost 80 per cent.</p>
<p>Bloomfield is expected to reveal that New Zealand&rsquo;s number of active cases has again fallen.</p>

<h3 id="covid-19-coronavirus-nzs-own-tracing-app-on-way-as-australia-rolls-out-covidsafe">Covid 19 coronavirus: NZ&rsquo;s own tracing app on way as Australia rolls out COVIDSafe</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/C84K3y2oET3Cg_bsQ32KpcsV5Qc=/1200x0/smart/filters:quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-syd-prod-nzme.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RPVLCJP54RCV7OJL66LNNKEEYU.jpg" alt="img">
The Government has promised that a Covid-19 contact-tracing app will be available in less than a fortnight.</p>
<p>The announcement comes as the Australian Government launched its own voluntary app, designed to limit the spread of Covid-19 through an early notification system.</p>
<p>New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said in recent weeks that technology would be part of the answer to speeding up contact tracing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It [the app] will have basic functionality, but even that will be important, as it will help update our national health database with the user&rsquo;s contact details,&rdquo; Ardern said earlier this month.</p>
<p>New data from Horizon Research found that 73 per cent of New Zealanders surveyed support personal mobile data being used for Covid-19 tracking.</p>

<p>When extrapolated, Horizon said this equates to around 2,613,800 of the country&rsquo;s 3,595,518 adults supporting use of data from their own mobiles.</p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison yesterday launched the COVIDSafe app – an app he said will &ldquo;save lives and save livelihoods&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The app is voluntary but Morrison is encouraging everyone in Australia to download it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more people who download this important public health app, the safer they and their family will be, the safer their community will be and the sooner we can safely lift restrictions and get back to business and do the things we love,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Once downloaded, the app requests the user&rsquo;s phone number, name, age-range and postcode.</p>
<p>It then connects to other phones which also have the app and records anyone who the user has been in close proximity to for more than 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>If anyone in this category tests positive, the user will receive a notification, letting them know they have been in contact with someone with Covid-19.</p>
<p>Morrison said COVIDSafe would speed up the process of identifying people who have been in close contact with someone diagnosed with coronavirus, quickly stopping further spread of the virus in the community.</p>
<p>New Zealand&rsquo;s Ministry of Health said the contact-tracing app being released in two weeks would be the first version of the app, and would enable people to pre-register contact details to help contact-tracers in their work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The app itself is undergoing further development,&rdquo; the ministry said.</p>
<p>That included work on the use of scannable QR codes, which would allow people to check-in at businesses or other destinations.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Ardern said the Government was investigating the Singaporean Government&rsquo;s Bluetooth-based app TraceTogether. It records interactions between a phone and any other phones nearby that have the app installed.</p>
<p>But she warned it was not perfect technology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The data is stored on the phone, and if the user tests positive, they then release the data to the Government for contact tracing. Close contacts can then be automatically notified of their need to self-isolate and be tested.&rdquo;</p>

<p>2.20pm: Government says it’s on track to ‘gold-standard’ contact-tracing protocols</p>
<p>Contact tracing and surveillance under alert level three continue to be pressing concerns for the public. A recent audit of the government’s contact-tracing capabilities, dated April 10, by infectious diseases specialist Dr Ayesha Verrall exposed vulnerabilities in the capacity of both the 12 public health units (PHUs) and the National Close Contact Service (NCCS). Today National’s health spokesperson Michael Woodhouse publicly criticised the minister for health, David Clark, over written responses in which Clark admitted he didn’t know how many close contacts of positive Covid-19 cases the Ministry of Health was unable to reach.</p>
<p>Today the prime minister assured the country there was no widespread undetected community transmission in New Zealand.</p>
<p>“We must remain vigilant if we are to keep it that way,” she told media in the daily briefing.</p>
<p>“To get there, our team of five million needs to have zero tolerance for cases to complete our goal of eliminating the virus at level three. If you’re unwell, stay home. If you have a runny nose, a sore throat, a cough, get a test. Let’s make sure that we keep those testing rates up, we continue with our contact tracing in isolation. That’s how we’ll finish this job.”</p>
<p>When asked about contact tracing, and the standard we’re at currently, Ardern replied that the country has scaled up a significant amount. “We have the ability to make as many as 10,000 calls a day, if that is required.” She reiterated the need for New Zealanders to record where they’ve been and who they’ve been with.</p>
<p>On the contact-tracing TraceTogether app currently in development in Singapore (which would require high levels of uptake for efficacy), Ardern said progress was continuing but it was not a replacement for human and one-on-one contact tracing between a health worker and someone who has Covid-19. She said that some of the technology that is being discussed bypasses public health authorities, potentially spreading the wrong information due to technical issues.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health plans to make the voluntary app available in the next fortnight to track the movements of people with the virus.</p>
<p>1.05pm: Five new cases of Covid-19</p>
<p>On the last day of alert level four, a further five people in New Zealand have Covid-19, the director general of health, Ashley Bloomfield, has just announced.</p>
<p>Sadly, a woman in her 90s has passed away in Waitākere hospital. She was a resident of St Margaret’s hospital and rest home. This brings the number of Covid-19 related deaths in New Zealand to 19.</p>
<p>Of the five cases, only one is confirmed and four are probable. Bloomfield said three of the probable cases are linked to the St Margaret’s rest home cluster in Auckland and two can be linked to other known cases. Six cases that were previously probable have been reclassified as either still under investigation or not a case. This brings the national total to 1,469.</p>
<p>There were 2,939 tests completed yesterday, with a combined total to date of 123,920. There are 38 further recoveries, with 1,180 reported as recovered. “This means that around 80% of all cases are now recovered,” Bloomfield said.</p>
<p>There are seven people in hospital, unchanged from yesterday. This includes one person in the ICU in Middlemore.</p>
<p>There are still 16 significant clusters, again unchanged.</p>
<p>There is only one case since April 1 where the ministry is still investigating the source, a confirmed case in Tauranga.</p>
<p>This means the 32 days since lockdown began look like this, in terms of new cases: 78, 85, 83, 63, 76, 58, 61, 89, 71, 82, 89, 67, 54, 50, 29, 44, 29, 18, 19, 17, 20, 15, 8, 13, 9, 9, 5, 6, 3, 5, 5, 9 and today, 5.</p>
<p>Joining the director general of health, the prime minister Jacinda Ardern summed up New Zealand’s achievements under alert level four.</p>
<p>“It’s been nearly five weeks living and working in ways that just two months ago would have seemed impossible. But we did, and we have done it together,” she said.</p>
<p>“Our testing has grown from obviously zero pre Covid-19 to the capacity to process up to 8,000 tests per day. That’s resulted in us having one of the highest testing rates in the world per capita. We have a very low percentage coming back positive each day – as low as 0.05% last week, and only 0.17% today.</p>
<p>“This provides strong evidence that there is not widespread transmission that is going undetected. The virus has a transmission rate of around 2.5% in most places without controls. Under lockdown, this has dropped to 0.4%, less than half a person infected by each individual. And for the last few days, our cases have been in the single digits with, as you will have heard from Dr Bloomfield, just one confirmed case. It is worth pausing to digest those numbers.</p>
<p>“They are incredible and they are thanks to the sacrifices that every single New Zealander has made.”</p>
<p>Ardern expressed sympathy for everyone that has lost a loved one in that time. “Numbers of course mean nothing to their loved ones and nothing can take away their grief. All I can do is say to those people is that our thoughts and sympathies are with you. We send them our love in their time of loss.”</p>
<p>In other sad news, today is the last day of daily live media briefings with Ashley Bloomfield, and Ardern reserved her highest praise for the director general of health.</p>
<p>“I consider New Zealand to be very lucky to have a public servant of Dr Bloomfield’s calibre leading the health response.</p>
<p>“Dr Bloomfield, it’s been a real honour.”</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health will continue to provide daily updates at 1pm, while the prime minister will return to her post-cabinet press conferences and daily media stand-ups before the house. Most days there will be government announcements from the theatrette as the country moves through level three.</p>
<p>12.50pm: Watch today’s media update here</p>
<p>12.30pm: National says minister for health not ready for level three</p>
<p>A media statement from National’s health spokesperson, Michael Woodhouse, says the minister for health David Clark is “in the dark” on contact tracing. Woodhouse claims that in written responses to questions from his office, the health minister revealed he doesn’t know how many close contacts of positive Covid-19 cases the Ministry of Health is unable to reach.</p>
<p>“Not only does the minister not know how many close contacts the Ministry of Health hasn’t been able to contact, he also can’t say what the average time for contact tracing is,” Woodhouse wrote.</p>
<p>“The prime minister said that before we come out of level four we need assurance about the speed and capacity of contact tracing, yet the minister of health hasn’t been able to provide this with the country about to move to level three.”</p>
<p>In March, the government set up the National Close Contact Service (NCCS) to guard against a possible “future surge” of Covid-19 cases. According to the Ministry of Health it has capacity to make 5,000 calls per day, with potential to be scaled up to 10,000 if required. A further $55 million was announced last week, in addition to the $15 million that had already been allocated, to strengthen the ministry’s contact tracing capabilities.</p>
<p>11.30am: Taranaki iwi protecting the border</p>
<p>The eight iwi of Taranaki have announced a new community checkpoint plan under alert level three, with support from police in the rohe. Checkpoints run by iwi volunteers at the northern, eastern and southern boundaries of Taranaki will come into effect on Tuesday 28 April and people whose travel is deemed non-essential will be asked to return home.</p>
<p>Iwi representatives says that while there have only been 15 confirmed Covid-19 cases in Taranaki (including a confirmed case over the past weekend), there has also been limited testing in the area, especially in rural and vulnerable communities.</p>
<p>“Until the presence of COVID-19 across our region has been established or ruled out, especially given another case has just been confirmed in Taranaki, we need to ensure we protect those vulnerable communities and that we have an ability to track travel movement into Taranaki,” said Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, CEO for Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Ruanui.</p>
<p>10.30am: Ardern and Bloomfield to front a real live 1pm briefing</p>
<p>After a horrible weekend ruined by Ministry of Health Covid-19 figures delivered via the coolly impersonal medium of press release, the national pastime of watching the briefings over lunch resumes today, when the full-strength starting lineup of PM Jacinda Ardern and director general of health Ashley Bloomfield will once again appear in the Beehive theatrette to make a short statement then take some questions.</p>
<p>The Spinoff will cover the briefing live, and post the MoH livestream here closer to the time.</p>
<p>10.15am: Pasifika in California three times more likely to be infected with Covid-19</p>
<p>RNZ reports a concerning trend regarding the infection rate of Pasifika in the US, particularly in its most-populous state. As of last week, California’s state-wide average number of confirmed Covid-19 cases per 100,000 population was 62, while the rate for Pasifika in California was 217, over three times higher. It’s reflected in other states too, and quotes a Marshall islands community leader as attributing the disproportionate impact to familiar and long-running trends.</p>
<p>“The challenges that Pacific Islander communities are facing with Covid-19 are the same challenges we have been dealing with for decades,” said Melisa Laelan, president and founder of the Arkansas Coalition of Marshallese. “It is that of housing, food security, employment, and access to health care. The lack of these things makes our community vulnerable to Covid-19. This pandemic magnified many of the gaps that have been overlooked for a long time. Things are bad and it will get worse if we don’t aggressively work on these structural issues.”</p>

<p>9.15am: Almost every conceivable question you might have about level three, answered</p>
<p>The Spinoff’s editor Toby Manhire spent his Sunday asking and answering this enormous list of questions you will definitely have about level three. It is a beautifully-compiled mixture, mainly very useful, occasionally very obvious, in a ratio designed to help the informational medicine stay down. Amongst the queries are:</p>
<p>– How on earth will ECE centres manage physical distancing?</p>
<p>– Will dentists be open under level three?</p>
<p>– What about meeting up with a Tinder match?</p>
<p>– Can magazines resume printing?</p>
<p>– Will drive-throughs be open?</p>
<p>– Can you go surfing under alert level three?</p>
<p>Plus many, many, many more queries and idiosyncrasies. You should really read it.</p>

<p>8.50am: District court plans for levelling down</p>
<p>The District Court says it is taking extra steps to ensure the safety of those appearing and participating in proceedings when the court reopens to the public under level three tomorrow.</p>
<p>The courts are an essential service, and the Health Act order says essential personal movement includes leaving home to attend court.</p>
<p>Chief district court judge Heemi Taumaunu says the District Court must continue to process cases, provided the work can be done in a way that complies with</p>
<p>physical distancing and hygiene requirements, but that the court will still be operating at reduced capacity.</p>
<p>“I expect this to be an orderly process, and people coming to court should be prepared to queue outside, at two metres apart from each other,” Taumaunu said. “Only</p>
<p>those who are required in court should attend, and defendants are permitted to bring only one support person.”</p>
<p>8am: Star Bloomberg columnist gets almost nothing right in column about NZ’s level four</p>
<p>Business news giant Bloomberg has published an opinion piece by award-winning journalist Joe Nocera which makes a series of extraordinary and easily disproved factual errors about New Zealand’s alert level four restrictions, all seemingly based on chat the columnist had with his son. Amongst the claims it makes:</p>
<p>– “New Zealanders aren’t allowed to drive, except in emergencies”</p>
<p>– “And can only be out of the house an hour a day”</p>
<p>– “to get exercise or buy essentials”</p>
<p>Those are all in a single sentence. It also claims that the wait at supermarkets is typically an hour, and that no one is allowed in without gloves or a mask, that all deliveries have been halted, and that “citizens are surviving financially with emergency checks from the government”.</p>
<p>New Zealanders, usually enthusiasts for any and all praise from overseas, have been less excited in this instalment.</p>

<p>7.50am: New poll shows strong support for level four extension</p>
<p>An excerpt from a story revealing continued majority support for the lockdown:</p>
<p>“At midnight, New Zealand moves out of the strictest lockdown settings and into alert level three. That follows an announcement by Jacinda Ardern last Monday that the level four measures would be extended by five days. Two-thirds of New Zealanders have judged that decision to be “about right”, with 22% saying it was too early and only 4% saying it was too late.</p>
<p>Most noisily in the US, but in many other countries, business lobbies are making the case for relaxing restrictions and “opening up” economies, often when there has been less success in suppressing the virus. Today’s results suggest there is very little public enthusiasm for quickly lifting the restrictions.”</p>

<p>7.40am: Huge increase in flu shots administered</p>
<p>This year’s flu vaccine programme has seen record numbers with 587,000 vaccines already administered compared to 290,000 at the same time last year, Associate Health Minister Julie Anne Genter said in a statement. “This year we started the flu jab season early, distributed hundreds of thousands more vaccines and doubled the number of people vaccinated this year compared to this time last year,” Genter said.</p>
<p>Vaccines have until now been restricted to priority groups only, but that ends today, said Genter</p>
<p>As at 17 April 2020, 587,000 people have been vaccinated, compared with 290,000 on the same date in 2019. Two thirds of vaccines have been administered to people aged over 65, and 5712 to pregnant women. Free flu vaccines continue to be available for: people aged 65 and over; people who are pregnant; people with certain chronic conditions; and young children with a history of severe respiratory illness.</p>
<p>7.10am: Europe’s worst-hit record lowest deaths in over a month</p>
<p>Spain recorded 288 deaths attributed to Covid-19, the lowest total since March 21, while Italy’s 260 deaths were the lowest since March 14, in signs which are hugely positive for the countries which have seen Europe’s most deaths from the virus. Spain’s total is considered especially promising, as it is combined with just 1,729 new confirmed cases – the lowest number since March 17 – and comes two weeks after it began to partially reopen its economy. The UK also recorded its lowest death toll since March, at 413.</p>
<p>Despite this, there’s a huge note of caution in the Financial Times, which reports that the global toll may be under-reported by as much as 60%. It analysed mortality rates across 14 countries, and found “122,000 deaths in excess of normal levels across these locations, considerably higher than the 77,000 official Covid-19 deaths reported for the same places and time periods”. This tallies with the severe worldwide shortage of testing, and the fact many nations are only attributing deaths to Covid-19 if the deaths occur in hospital, or there is a confirmed positive test.</p>
<p>While Europe appears to have its outbreak under control, it is exploding in some of the world’s most populous nations. Russia and Brazil reached milestones for infections overnight, of 80,000 and 60,000 respectively, ranking them 10th and 11th for confirmed cases worldwide. Yet the velocity of the infections are more concerning than the raw numbers, with the Washington Post’s data showing Russia’s cases up 18% since April 24 and Brazil’s up 14%. This compares with between 1% and 3% for countries like France, Germany and Spain – though the US and UK, at 7% and 6% respectively, remain fast-growing despite being deep into their lockdowns.</p>
<p>7.00am: Yesterday’s key New Zealand stories</p>
<p>There were nine new cases in New Zealand, and no new deaths. Of all confirmed and probable cases, 78% are now recovered. The total number of active cases is now 310.</p>
<p>Public health expert Michael Baker suggested air crews should possibly no longer be exempted from the requirement to self-isolate for 14 days after returning to New Zealand.</p>
<p>Finance minister Grant Robertson defended the size of some payouts under the wage subsidy scheme, but criticised a business owner who received $239,000 but has only paid $80,000 to his staff.</p>
<p>The government announced a $107 million fund to provide housing and other wraparound services to vulnerable people during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The Green Party released a proposal for a $1bn package centred around “nature-based jobs” to aid the country’s economic recovery.</p>
<p>National’s finance spokesman Paul Goldsmith laid out his own recovery plan, which unsurprisingly has a stronger focus on the private sector.</p>
<p>The global death toll passed 200,000.</p>
