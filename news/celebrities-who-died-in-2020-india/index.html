Veteran Bollywood actor Rattan Chopra, born as Abdul Jabbar Khan, died of cancer in Malerkotla town of Punjab on Friday night (June 12).</p>
<p>Rattan Chopra&rsquo;s adopted daughter Anita confirmed his death. She said that the late actor was battling cancer and had no money for treatment. He was unmarried.</p>
<p>Sources close to Rattan Chopra&rsquo;s family said that 10 days ago, he sought financial help from Bollywood actors Dharmendra, Akshay Kumar and Sonu Sood, but received no reply. The actor was diagnosed with cancer in January this year.</p>
<p>Rattan Chopra was living in extreme poverty in his last days. He was surviving on food donated by a local Gurudwara and temples. For the past few years, he has been living in a rented house in Panchkula, Haryana.</p>
<p>The actor played lead role in Tanuja-starer Mome Ki Gudiya, which released in 1972. He was, however, forced to leave Bollywood as his grandmother was against his acting career.</p>
<p>Watch Rattan Chopra in Mome Ki Gudiya song Reshma Jawan Ho Gayi here:</p>
<p>A Punjab University (Chandigarh) graduate, the late actor did his post graduation from Patiala. After his stint in Bollywood, Rattan Chopra taught English in various schools and other institutions in Punjab.</p>
<p>Recently, Rattan Chopra claimed that he was offered films like Loafer, Aya Sawan Jhoom Ke and Jugnu, which he refused due to his grand mother&rsquo;s opposition. These films were later offered to Dharmendra.</p>
