<h3 id="meet-amanda-staveley-the-financial-fixer-on-the-verge-of-a-300m-deal-for-newcastle">Meet Amanda Staveley: The financial fixer on the verge of a £300m deal for Newcastle</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/04/15/18/27232956-0-image-a-8_1586970398993.jpg" alt="img">
In early 2009 she was described as &lsquo;the beautiful woman who has shaken up the beautiful game&rsquo; – the financial fixer who helped Middle Eastern multi-millionaires purchase football clubs.</p>
<p>Eleven years later, Amanda Staveley is still dabbling in the art of takeovers, and perhaps coming towards the end of a pursuit that has left Newcastle United fans exhausted.</p>
<p>The sale of this North East institution is one which has been on, off, then on again, then off again.</p>
<p>Amanda Staveley appears to finally be closing in on a £300m takeover deal for Newcastle</p>
<p>But should Mike Ashley eventually sign on that dotted line, take his £300million and Sports Direct signage with him, those supporters will tell you it was all worth it.</p>
<p>Staveley could be about to become the new First Lady of Football. To understand who she is and what she stands for, one quote from the 2000s stands out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not about money,&rsquo; the now 47-year-old said at the time. &lsquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t matter if I was making £8m or £200m. I just want to go to bed at night and say I&rsquo;ve done a good job.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If £8m is indeed peanuts to her, then Newcastle&rsquo;s supporters desperate for success would hope that means she would be willing to invest significantly more in the transfer market.</p>
<p>She is thought to have a personal fortune of £115m-plus, and is no stranger to the limelight.</p>
<p>Staveley was in a relationship with Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, and she avoided a life of intense tabloid interest by apparently turning down a marriage proposal in 2003.</p>
<p>The British businesswoman has launched a new £300million bid for the North East giants</p>
<p>Staveley has strong contacts in the Middle East and has always been interested in sport</p>
<p>Newcastle owner Mike Ashley is ready to sell to Staveley and her firm PCP Capital Partners</p>
<p>In 2011 she married Mehrdad Ghodoussi, a handsome Iranian who worked with her at her company, in a lavish ceremony in West Wycombe Park, Buckinghamshire. Guests included the artist Tracey Emin and the bride&rsquo;s wedding dress was designed by Sarah Burton, who was responsible for Kate Middleton&rsquo;s gown at her own royal wedding.</p>
<p>The couple have a child together – Alexander, nicknamed Lexi, born in 2014. He was born prematurely after Staveley went into labour in a business meeting but is now a healthy little boy.</p>
<p>So why football? Why a business where each and every decision she makes would be scrutinised by millions of fans and reporters and pundits alike?</p>
<p>Staveley is not new to sport, having been well involved in the horse racing world. Like football, their owners have rather large bank balances.</p>
<p>As an ambitious 20-something, she took out a £180,000 loan to buy a restaurant named Stocks near Cambridge and Newmarket racecourse. It was regularly visited by trainers and owners, giving her an opportunity to make the contacts she craved.</p>
<p>Staveley poses with her husband Mehrdad Ghodoussi at The Old Vic Bicentenary Ball in 2013</p>
<p>Her entrepreneurial career was on its way.</p>
<p>Staveley first met Prince Andrew in the United Arab Emirates during a visit as part of his role as a trade ambassador, in 2001. She had just ended a two-year relationship with millionaire venture capitalist Mark Horrocks, then 39.</p>
<p>Her relationship with the Prince blossomed and was mutually beneficial in many ways.</p>
<p>As trade envoy, Prince Andrew could open doors to contacts. Meanwhile, he enjoyed introducing people to his new &lsquo;female friend&rsquo;, whose glamour was equalled by her charm and intelligence – an enviable asset for the Prince, who was often considered socially rather gauche. Friends noted how she called him &lsquo;Babe&rsquo;.</p>
<p>She became a regular visitor to Buckingham Palace, Sandringham and Royal Lodge, Andrew&rsquo;s home in Windsor Great Park, which she helped him decorate. She was even introduced to Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, who were said to have approved of her.</p>
<p>Staveley played a key role in Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan buying Manchester City. She is pictured in 2008 with Ali Jassim, who was his adviser at the time</p>
<p>Staveley speaks at the Harper&rsquo;s Bazaar Women Of The Year Awards in London in 2009</p>
<p>In 2003, the Prince popped the question. But Staveley struggled to envisage herself idling away her hours with official duties and being unable to conduct the business she loves.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Andrew&rsquo;s a lovely man and I still care for him a great deal,&rsquo; she told The Daily Mail a few years ago. &lsquo;But if I&rsquo;d married him, my independence would have disappeared.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a decision that disappointed her parents, particularly her mother, who Staveley later said took three years to get over it. She once admitted: &lsquo;I had a bit of a chip on my shoulder about being a girl in a family where the boy inherits. My mother and father always told me that my job was to marry well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Marrying into the Royal Family would have curtailed her commercial ambitions, too. She had considered acquiring a stake in Spearmint Rhino, the chain of lap-dancing clubs, but declined because such a seedy investment would have been seen as inappropriate for a princess.</p>
<p>And so she turned to the Middle East to use her skills as a negotiator and broker deals to amass a princely sum.</p>
<p>Staveley attends &lsquo;The Radical Eye&rsquo; dinner in aid of the Elton John Aids Foundation in 2016</p>
<p>In 2005, she set up the Dubai-based private equity company PCP Capital Partners, which soon secured international deals for clients in Qatar and the UAE.</p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s role is varied. Sometimes they lobby on political issues; occasionally they simply bring powerful people together or act as intermediaries in complex negotiations. Her contacts book is, without doubt, formidable.</p>
<p>She had used her former Mayfair mews house to entertain the fashion designer Amanda Wakeley and the billionaire property-owning Duke of Westminster.</p>
<p>In 2008, at the age of 35, Staveley was involved in the takeover of Manchester City by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan. That reportedly saw her take home £10m and she was labelled by some newspapers as &lsquo;the new Queen of British football&rsquo;. Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia may now have some competition once more.</p>
<p>Staveley also came close to joining the Liverpool board when Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum of Dubai was linked with buying the Merseyside club.</p>
<p>Plus, she has been described as quite the sportswoman, liking showjumping and athletics. At the age of 14, she is said to have clocked 12.6 seconds for the 100m, and only a snapped Achilles tendon stopped her from pursuing a career in that side of sport more.</p>
<p>Before opening Stocks, she had won a place to study modern languages in Cambridge and worked as a part-time model for additional money.</p>
<p>She was unfortunately forced to abandon the degree after being left in hospital suffering from stress following the death of her grandfather.</p>
<p>So after all of this, it soon becomes apparent that Staveley is something of a workaholic.</p>
<p>Staveley poses in her London home as part of an interview with the Mail in March 2017</p>
<p>Weeks after helping the City takeover in 2008, she brokered a deal that saw billions of pounds of Middle Eastern money pumped into Barclays. Her slice of the pie from that deal was £40m for her firm, with Staveley reportedly keeping a significant sum for herself.</p>
<p>With a grand Regency townhouse in Park Lane, London, and a home in Dubai, it really is some life she leads.</p>
<p>So we know why sport and football, but why Newcastle? Staveley may have answered that herself in 2002: &lsquo;If I&rsquo;m shown a good idea, I can&rsquo;t help but look.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Newcastle, with its global appeal and room to grow, represents a challenge but also an opportunity. Ashley bought the club for £134m in 2007. In the past he has demanded £400m, then that figured appeared to drop to £340m, and now £300m is being discussed.</p>
<p>We have been here before, of course, but Staveley has never been closer to a done deal. Now we wait

<h3 id="英超傳紐卡素同意賣盤予沙特王室-kardashian之友成關鍵人物">英超傳紐卡素同意賣盤予沙特王室 Kardashian之友成關鍵人物</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hk01.com/media/images/4329520/org/fd442d2632096c37a6e8c2cb08076aba.jpg" alt="img">
紐卡素放盤已久，但賣價一直都未合「孤寒班主」Mike Ashley心水，故球迷一直只能乾等。雖然英超現時因新冠肺炎停擺，但紐卡素賣盤一事卻有突破，英媒指Ashley已同意以約3億英鎊，將「喜鵲」賣給沙特阿拉伯王室的投資基金，更爆出交易成功全靠美國名媛Kim Kardashian的朋友Carla DiBello。</p>
<p>Mike Ashley 2007年入主，但因「孤寒」成性於紐卡素一直不得民心，雖然屢次放盤，但數次都是價錢不合而未能成功。英國傳媒周三（15日）爆料，指Mike Ashley終於捨得放生「喜鵲」，將3億英鎊出售紐卡素，沙特阿拉伯王室的Public Investment Fund聯同英國商人Amanda Staveley及Reuben兄弟，極有機會成為新一代紐卡素班主。英媒得到轉手的31頁文件，並指出將需4周時間處理。</p>

<p>PIF的首腦正正是沙特王儲穆罕默德（Mohammad Bin Salman），34歲的他身家估計有70億英鎊，英媒指雖然Amanda Staveley為今次買方的領導人物，但事成後只會以3000萬英鎊得到10%股份，亦不會有任何實權，故可相信PIF才是紐卡素的真正新主人。</p>

<p>《華爾街日報》指出，美國名媛Kim Kardashian的朋友Carla DiBello，去年初向PIF建議收購紐卡素，更有可能是買方的談判人員之一。報道又指DiBello與穆罕默德「關係密切」，與PIF高層亦過從甚密，成為左右今次收購的重要人物。</p>
<p>惟《華》透露，PIF內部對開設顧問公司的DiBello甚為不滿，主因為「基金現今的主要項目發展不順」，卻在此時提出收購球會，目的只是從中獲利，但首腦人物對其主動「埋身」的動機及態度卻不以為然。</p>

<p>35歲的DiBello是Kim Kardashian與歌手Kanye West 2014年的婚禮賓客之一，除了與Kim份屬好友外，更幫助好友拍拍真人騷，近年亦多有活躍於體育界，2018年曾為沙特阿拉伯拍攝他們首次舉辦Formula E賽事的紀錄片《Electric Kingdom》。</p>
<p>Carla DiBello於IG亦十分活躍，吸引到逾64萬人追蹤，不時上載自己到世界各地工作的相片。</p>
