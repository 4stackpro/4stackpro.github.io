More than 80,000 people in Italy are known to be infected with Covid-19 and 8,215 have died from it – nearly twice as many as any other country.</p>
<p>Yet despite this dreadful outcome, in a video conference of G7 foreign ministers on 25 March Italy’s foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, boasted about Italy’s lockdown model. ‘In these weeks the other countries have recognised that Italy’s approach is the model to follow’, said Di Maio. His statement implies that the Italian government’s response to coronavirus was based on a rational model and guided by strategic thinking. But the government’s key actions prove this is a myth. First, on 31 January, after two Chinese tourists in Italy tested positive for Covid-19, the government became the first Eurozone country to ban all direct flights between Italy and China. As there are high volumes of business between the countries, it was inevitable people would continue to travel anyway, only indirectly. There are more than 300,000 Chinese people working in Italy and some of them were likely to be travelling back to Italy after Chinese New Year on 25 January.</p>
<p>Many of the Chinese people living in Italy are from Wuhan – the original epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak. They tend to be in Italy to work in the leather and textile industries in the northern Italian regions, especially in Lombardy, the region with most Covid-19 cases. From 23 January, people could no longer leave Wuhan for Italy as the city was locked down. Yet many may have travelled to Italy after Covid-19 emerged in Wuhan in late December. There are even records of a significant and unusual increase in people hospitalised in Lombardy for flu and pneumonia between October and December last year. We do not know for certain if Covid-19 was spread from Wuhan to Lombardy directly, but this was the Italian region where the virus initially spread most rapidly. The government failed to quarantine and test people who were travelling between Italy and China in this period – nor did it test those who came indirectly from China after its travel ban.</p>
<p>The second significant decision by the Italian government was to lock down the Lombardy region and many parts of the Veneto region. But this move – and the way it was communicated – could have actually accelerated rather than restricted the spread of coronavirus in Italy. The lockdown was officially announced by prime minister Giuseppe Conte during a news conference, shortly after 2am on 8 March. But news of the lockdown had leaked to the press the previous evening. The lockdown was not initially well-enforced and there were widespread reports of people leaving lockdown areas to travel to other parts of Italy. As the lockdown included the closure of schools and universities in these areas, students and many people working in education headed to other parts of the country where their families are based. The lockdown of these northern areas was extended to the whole country on 9 March. The government ordered all schools to be closed but most workplaces were free to remain open. The result was that vast numbers of children had to be cared for during the day by their grandparents while their parents worked. It was well-known at this time that children rarely show serious symptoms of Covid-19 when they are infected and that people over 70 are the age group most likely to die from the virus. In other words, the government’s closure of schools made it more likely that children who could have been infected with Covid-19 were spreading it to the elderly.</p>
<p>The targeted lockdown of places with high numbers of Covid-19 cases like Vo’ Euganeo in the Veneto region has proven effective in treating those infected and eventually lowering the number of new infections. But the national lockdown spread the state’s resources too thinly when it should have concentrated on those areas with the most infections. This lack of local focus was made worse by the government’s decision last weekend to tighten the national lockdown by closing all workplaces and public spaces which it considered ‘non-essential’ for national production and supporting life. Moreover, this decision failed to take into account the possible long-term health, social and economic outcomes of locking down the whole population. The government has had to inject billions of euros into the economy to try to rebalance this.</p>
<p>The way the government introduced the latest phase of the lockdown made it abundantly clear that there is no strategic thinking going on. Early afternoon on Friday 20 March, Veneto regional governor Luca Zaia declared that people in the region had to stay within 200 metres of their houses unless travelling for work, health or necessities like buying food. The national health minister Roberto Speranza responded on Friday evening by signing a directive stating that people across the country had to stay ‘around’ their houses unless travelling for essential reasons. He also ordered all parks to close from Saturday. On Saturday night, Conte announced the national lockdown of all non-essential workplaces after the Lombardy regional governor Attilio Fontana had demanded this for his region. This prompted governors of other regions to call on the government to ban employees who were no longer working from travelling from northern regions (with high levels of Covid-19 infections) to other regions. On Sunday, another lockdown decree was issued which stipulated that nobody could move from one council area to another unless they had a documented work or health reason.</p>
<p>Thus over a single weekend, the government’s definition of the lockdown kept on changing, mostly in response to demands for regional governors. On Wednesday this week, the government changed the definition of non-essential workplaces after trade-union leaders representing Lombardy and Lazio metalworkers threatened to strike. One reason the government’s lockdown measures have been so haphazard is that the current government has no sense of democratic responsibility to the people – or any democratic mandate at all, for that matter. Instead, the government has been merely reactive – changing policy on the hoof, in response to calls for stronger restrictions by governors, unions and journalists.

Italy will be placed on lockdown amid the ongoing spread of coronavirus, the country’s prime minister said. That’s a massive expansion of yesterday’s lockdown order for Lombardy, a large region in northern Italy that includes Venice and Milan.</p>
<p>People shouldn’t travel unless necessary for work or family emergencies, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, according to the BBC. People are no longer allowed to assemble in public; movie theaters, gyms, and pubs will be closed; and sporting events, funerals, and weddings will be canceled, reports The Guardian. And schools and universities will stay closed until April 3rd, says CNBC. Previously, schools were due to reopen March 15.</p>
<p>“I stay at home.”</p>
<p>“I am going to sign a decree that can be summarized as follows: I stay at home,” Conte said, according to The Guardian. “The whole of Italy will become a protected zone.”</p>
<p>Italy trails only China in cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. There are more than 9,100 confirmed Italian cases, up from 5,883 on Saturday. More than 460 people are dead. Cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in all 20 regions of the country, according to the BBC. Italy has a population of more than 60 million.</p>
<p>Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, has been under government-ordered lockdown since January 22nd. One Wuhan resident described the lockdown as a “living hell” in a powerful essay on NPR.</p>
<p>There have been more than 113,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally and nearly 4,000 deaths.

<h3 id="customers-tell-us-to-keep-the-change-italys-delivery-drivers-on-lockdown--photo-essay">&lsquo;Customers tell us to keep the change&rsquo;: Italy&rsquo;s delivery drivers on lockdown – photo essay</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6ac6dedb0afbde28f03dc6c455869aea83ad7aa/0_263_4782_2869/master/4782.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=f84b6891bae14c968467e29fc50387b6" alt="img">
On a locked-down Saturday night, Filippo Venturi came down the stairs of his apartment block in Forlì, in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, to collect his pizza delivery. But before the rider left, he asked something they probably weren’t expecting: “Can I take your picture?”</p>
<p>Alessia, 20, La Sosta restaurant.</p>
<p>Venturi, 39, began studying photography 11 years ago, and has since documented sport, theatre events and social phenomena. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, he has been photographing delivery riders. Speaking down the phone from his home, where he, his partner and their son have been quarantined for two weeks, he tells me how he started to worry about the riders, coming into contact with stranger after stranger, while providing an essential service to those who can afford to self-isolate. As he started ordering more deliveries, he asked each rider – from a safe distance – about their lives under coronavirus.</p>
<p>Eleonora, 29, Demetra herbal medicine shop.</p>
<p>Most told him they weren’t worried, because they take precautions, as do customers. But 23-year-old Andrea, delivering sushi, wasn’t so sure. “I’m not calm,” he told Venturi. “Even if I take all the precautions, people tend to touch you, to take risks – they assume neither of you are infected. But I could be, or they could be. How do I know that they’re not in quarantine?”</p>
<p>Andrea, 23, MeloSushi restaurant.</p>
<p>Venturi tells me he was struck by both the lack of consideration given to riders’ health, and their lack of choice when it came to doing the job. Davide, 25, was laid off when the restaurant he worked for closed down; his second job as a personal trainer has also been terminated. Delivering burgers to make ends meet, Davide hasn’t been given a mask or gloves. “If they want them, they have to buy them themselves,” Venturi says. “Before the crisis, they cost one or two euros each – now they cost €20 or €30. And it’s not as if they can wear them for days and days.”</p>
<p>Davide, 25, Welldone burger bar, Cesena.</p>
<p>Naturally, the lockdown made some interviews difficult. While most people were happy to talk, Venturi says, a driver called Antonio would only tell him, “I work in black.” Why? “I think it was his way of explaining that he couldn’t tell me anything else. The police roam the streets, making sure anyone who is out has a valid reason. I think he was worried that being photographed and interviewed wasn’t a good enough reason.” Delivery riders have witnessed the multiple ways people deal with their anxieties about contagion.</p>
<p>Left: Antonio, Forlì. Right: Loris, 65, La Baita del Buongustaio.</p>
<p>Simone, 32. Q Corner coffee bar.</p>
<p>Simone, 32, brought Venturi breakfast from a nearby coffee bar. The venue had always delivered pizza in the evening, but expanded their hours to deliver from 9am to 10pm. He reported that one customer laid out kitchen towels on the floor outside the door, and asked him to place the bag on top. “Perhaps that’s a little excessive,” Venturi says, “but taking it from his hand would mean standing closer than a metre.” Simone wears a mask and always keeps a metre away from a customer, so he’s not very worried. His main fear is that the situation could get worse. “I fear that the government might also consider stopping home deliveries,” he says.</p>
<p>Lucian, 19, Kinkhao restaurant.</p>
<p>An unexpected upside was shared by 19-year-old Lucian. Generally, people do not tip in Italy; now, in an effort to avoid touching notes and coins, customers are telling him to keep the change.</p>
<p>“So he’s making more money, and that’s better for him, but the reason is sad,” Venturi says. “They’re not being generous – they’re afraid of him.”</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the mortality rate for Covid-19 in Italy is the highest in the world, in part because the population is older. But Venturi is concerned that many younger people don’t seem to grasp that they, too, are potentially at risk.</p>
<p>Left: Joel, 19, FoodStation rider. Right: Martina, 30, Gelateria Crem Caramel.</p>
<p>Alessandro, 21, Red Velvet bakery.</p>
<p>Alessandro, 21, told Venturi: “I’m calm when I work. I’m more worried about my band. We have an album coming out and we’re supposed to do a European tour in the late summer. I worry that everything will be cancelled.”</p>
<p>Left: Federico, 28, Barbeer. Right: Federico, 23, PizzaLab.</p>
<p>The photographer says a lot of older people are frustratingly complacent, too: “They often think they’re safe if they don’t have cardiac or respiratory problems.”</p>
<p>Though the job lacks the hero status afforded health workers and firefighters, Venturi points out that delivery riders have also risked their health so that others can stay safe and fed. Their lives might be tough or precarious in normal circumstances; currently, they are even more so. “They bring food to people who are staying safe in their homes, but that puts them at greater risk. And they in turn risk taking it home and passing it on to family.” Why shouldn’t they keep the change?
