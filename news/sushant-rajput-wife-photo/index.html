<p>In an interview to IANS, earlier this year, Rhea said she prefers no intrusion into her private life, and that is the reason she never reacts to the rumours of her relationship with Sushant.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Sushant was found hanging at his Bandra residence here, by his domestic help who alerted the police.</p>
<p>The actor hailed from Bihar and was educated in Patna and New Delhi, before shifting to Mumbai.</p>
<p>After establishing himself on the small screen with &ldquo;Pavitra Rishta&rdquo;, he transitioned to the big screen with film &ldquo;Kai Po Chhe&rdquo;. He went on to do projects including &ldquo;Shuddh Desi Romance&rdquo;, the biopic &ldquo;M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story&rdquo;, &ldquo;Kedarnath&rdquo; and &ldquo;Chhichore&rdquo;, among several others.</p>

Ekta Kapoor&rsquo;s television show, Pavitra Rishta (2009) about a middle class Maharashtrian family, won hearts. Pavitra Rishta came as a respite for Ekta, too, as she was experiencing a lull period prior to this show. The simple love story of Manav played by Sushant Singh Rajput and Archana aka Ankita Lokhande enticed everyone. The show created wonders for all the star cast and it often ruled the TRP charts. As Pavitra Rishta completes 11 years, let&rsquo;s take a look at the lead cast, Manav and Archana&rsquo;s romantic pictures: (Photo: Instagram)

<p>In Photos: From Maanav in Pavitra Rishta to Annirudh in Chhichhore, roles that defined Sushant Singh Rajput 1 12 Tracing Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s life in films Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s tryst with the camera began with a chance sighting. Ekta Kapoor&rsquo;s casting team spotted him in a play by Nadira Babbar&rsquo;s theatre company and invited him to audition for a show. It set the ball rolling on the then-aspiring hero&rsquo;s career. A look: Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil (2008) Sushant made his television debut as Preet Juneja on this show. The character was killed early on, but was brought back as a spirit for the series finale, owing to his popularity. Pavitra Rishta (2009) The next year, he landed the lead role of Manav Deshmukh in the hit show, widely considered to be his breakout role and a stepping stone to films. While working on this Ekta Kapoor production, he also met his future girlfriend, Ankita Lokhande, who played the female lead. Kai Po Che! (2013) After participating in two dance-based reality shows— Zara Nachke Dikha 2 and Jhalak Dikhhla Ja 4—Sushant auditioned for this Abhishek Kapoor directorial, and bagged one of the three lead roles alongside Rajkummar Rao and Amit Sadh. His portrayal of former district-level cricketer Ishaan Bhatt, who falls prey to politics in the selection process, in the critical and commercial success earned him raves. Shuddh Desi Romance (2013) Sushant followed it up with this Maneesh Sharma-directed Parineeti Chopra and Vaani Kapoor co-starrer. The romance comedy-drama was set in Jaipur and revolved around youngsters’ take on love and live-in relationships. PK (2014) In Rajkumar Hirani’s satirical comedy-drama led by Aamir Khan and Anushka Sharma, Sushant had a brief yet notable role. Detective Byomkesh Bakshy (2015) Dibakar Banerjee’s mystery thriller featured the actor in the titular role, a character created by Bengali writer Sharanindu Bandopadhyay. Set in the Kolkata of the 1940s, the film was reportedly to get a sequel with Sushant reprising his role. MS Dhoni: The Untold Story (2016) Neeraj Pandey’s biographical drama that traces the journey of the eponymous former Indian skipper-wicket keeper saw Sushant take on another titular role. The film, which also featured Kiara Advani and Disha Patani, secured for Sushant his first Filmfare Best Actor nomination the following year. Raabta (2017) In Dinesh Vijan’s directorial debut, a reincarnation-themed romance actioner, Sushant was paired opposite Kriti Sanon and the duo played star-crossed lovers. The film featured Jim Sarbh, Rajkumar Yadav and Varun Dharma in supporting roles. Kedarnath (2018) The actor reunited with Abhishek ‘Gattu’ Kapoor to headline Sara Ali Khan’s launch vehicle. The inter-faith love story was set against the backdrop of the pilgrim site and revolved around a Muslim boy who falls in love with a rich Brahmin girl. Sonchiriya (2019) Co-written and directed by Abhishek Chaubey, the film is set in the Chambal ravines of 1975 and tells the story of a group of dacoits. It also featured Manoj Bajpayee, Bhumi Pednekar, Ranvir Shorey and Ashutosh Rana. Chhichhore (2019) Sushant followed it up with one of the biggest successes of his career with this Nitesh Tiwari-directed campus comedy-drama. The film won five Filmfare nods, including Best Film and Best Director. It was also Sushant’s last theatrical release.</p>
<p>The news that Sushant is no more is shocking. Yes, shocking would be the correct word to describe it as he was a person full of energy and enthusiasm. He wanted to do so many things, had so many plans, so when you hear one fine day that this person is no more, it’s hard to believe. I had to call a few friends to check if the speculation was true. Turned out it was a sad reality. And that made it even more shocking.I knew him before we collaborated on Chhichhore through common friends. I had met him on a few occasions before we started working together and grew close during the making of the film. He was like a younger brother to Ashwiny (, wife and director) and me; so full of life and excited about the projects he was doing. He wanted to launch some things. We exchanged m e s s a g e s around 10 days ago. It was just a casual chat; he enquired about Ashwiny and our kids and I asked him how he was doing. He shared that he was learning coding and I told him that my son, Aaradhya, was learning it too. As always, we ended our chat saying, “Keep in touch.”

<p><img src="https://www.bollywoodshaadis.com/img/article-l-2020615510042136261000.jpg" alt="img">
Bollywood actor, Sushant Singh Rajput is everyone’s favourite because of his struggle story and because of his super-humble nature despite being a big name in the Indian film industry. The actor has stunned everyone with his exceptional performances in movies like Kai Po Che!, Kedarnath, MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, Sonchiriya, and Chhichhore. However, another big reason why people are in love with this good-looking man goes to the bond that he shares with his late mother. The actor never skips a chance to credit his mother for all the success he has achieved in his life and how much he misses her.

<p>Well, this time around the actor chooses a great way to describe his emotions for his mother and that is poetry. We have seen Sushant Singh Rajput expressing his deep pain quite beautifully under the flesh of sugary words. The actor has posted a poem for his late mother as he remembers her and it also welcomes a warm comment from his rumoured girlfriend, Rhea Chakraborty.</p>

<p>On June 3, 2020, Kedarnath and MS Dhoni: The Untold Story actor, Sushant Singh Rajput took to his Instagram handle and shared a beautiful monochrome collage, consisting his mother’s picture on the left and his picture on the right. It’s easy to predict that the actor was missing his mother so badly in this difficult time because he rarely showcases his emotions in front of everyone on social media. But this time, maybe it was better to let those words out in front of everybody and the actor did that quite beautifully as he wrote down a small tear-jerker poem which can be read as “Blurred past evaporating from teardrops. Unending dreams carving an arc of a smile. And a fleeting life, negotiating between the two&hellip;Maa” followed by a red heart emoticon. Take a look.

<p>After his post went live on Instagram, millions of his fans started heaping praises on his poetry and also supported him with their warm messages. Also, some of the popular names from the film and television industry have commented on his post but it was a simple comment from his rumoured girlfriend and actress, Rhea Chakraborty that took all the attention from others. The actress simply wrote four red heart emoticons on his post. Take a look.</p>
<p>advertisement</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, Sushant Singh Rajput’s mother had left him for the heavenly adobe, when he was just 16-year-old. In a lot of interviews, Sushant Singh Rajput had talked about the impact of his mother’s demise in his life and the eternal void with which he lives. He had explained, “It&rsquo;s not that I miss her only when something good or bad happens to me. I wouldn&rsquo;t lie but I am not incessantly thinking of her. I wish she was alive to see me succeed in life. I am sure she would have been really happy and proud of me. And maybe I would have been a different person than what I am now. The way I looked at things then and now, they are very different and I cannot go back to doing that.”</p>
<p>advertisement</p>
<p>Last year on May 6, 2019, Sushant Singh had taken to his Instagram handle and had posted a stunning monochrome image of him sitting on top of a chair and posing for the camera. But along with the picture, the actor had written a small poem for his late mother describing the condition of his life without her. His heart-melting poem could be read as &ldquo;As long as you were. I was. Now just in my memories. I come alive. Like that shadow. But just flickers. Time doesn’t move here. It’s beautiful mother. It’s forever.” Take a look.</p>
<p>advertisement</p>
<p>In the end, you’ll be amazed to know that the actor has immortalised his beloved mother in 2017 by getting a beautiful and meaningful tattoo on his back. The pictures of his tattoo had gone viral at that time but everyone was surprised when Sushant Singh Rajput had explained the meaning behind his tattoo in an interview with the Hindustan Times. He had explained, “The tattoo is a symbolic representation of five elements. My mother and I are in the centre, implying it is a bond that not even time can defy. The five elements are widely accepted symbols. However, the idea of using my mother and me as elements was thought of by my sister and me.” (Also Read: Gautam Rode Shares Wedding Video Of Him Dancing On &lsquo;Main Joru Ka Ghulam&rsquo; For Wife, Pankhuri Awasthy)</p>

<p>“Happy birthday to the most beautiful supermassive black hole that is known to mankind! Shine on you crazy diamond @sushantsinghrajput #boywithagoldenheart #rheality,” she captioned the post. Sushant replied, “Thank youuuuuuu my Rockstarrrr.”</p>
<p>Sushant had also recently shared a picture of Rhea on Instagram, calling her ‘my jalebi’. Rumours about their relationship began in May last year. However, they never confirmed the reports but their frequent dates and holidays seem to hint that they are a couple.</p>

<p>Sushant was in a long relationship with Manikarnika actor Ankita Lokhande for many years. They started dating when they worked together on TV soap Pavitra Rishta. They broke up in 2016.</p>
<p>When asked in an interview if he was seeing someone, Sushant recently said, “I’m seeing many. Oh, you mean it as a metaphor? I’m not allowed to say. It’s not that someone else is saying that I’m not allowed to say it. I cannot allow myself to say anything.”</p>
<p>He also said he needs to ask “that somebody” if he can talk about it: “If you ask me any question that has to do with me, I can say it. If I was seeing somebody, I’d have to ask that somebody. Probably your question, if well-founded, will help me insinuate it to the other person to know what to say next time. And probably when you put me on the cover next time, I’ll say it.”</p>
<p>Sushant was last seen opposite Jacqueline Fernandez in Netflix’s Drive, while Rhea was seen in the romantic drama Jalebi, which released in 2018.</p>
