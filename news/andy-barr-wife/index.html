<h3 id="canberra-rate-relief-temporary-act-chief-minister-andrew-barr-says">&ldquo;Canberra rate relief temporary, ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr says&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://nnimgt-a.akamaihd.net/transform/v1/crop/frm/fdcx/doc7agsywt991jgcago67w.jpg/r0_388_4256_2793_w1200_h678_fmax.jpg" alt="img">
news, act-politics,</p>
<p>Canberra homeowners can only expect a temporary reprieve from residential rate hikes, with Chief Minister Andrew Barr stressing the support to be offered next financial year is &ldquo;not a forever thing&rdquo;. The ACT government won&rsquo;t increase residential rates for about two thirds of homeowners next financial year, as it looks to ease hip pocket pressure on households and inject more money into the economy in the wake of the COVID-19 shutdown. Some 110,000 homeowners will see their rates drop when the government&rsquo;s $150 rebate, which will be applied to their first bill of 2020-21, is factored in. However, rates will still increase on about 36,500 properties, with homeowners in Reid, Red Hill and O&rsquo;Malley set to be slugged an extra 4 per cent next financial year. The government had said that rates would rise only between 1 and 2 per cent for about 18,000 homeowners, but that number was revised up on Wednesday morning. Mr Barr has long resisted calls to ease up on annual residential rate hikes, which is a crucial part of Labor&rsquo;s 20-year program to eventually phase out stamp duty. But speaking to reporters before delivering his annual State of the Territory address on Wednesday, Mr Barr said it was appropriate to change tack given the unfolding economic crisis. However, Mr Barr insisted the shift was only temporary, stressing that the government wasn&rsquo;t about to walk away from the reform program. He pointed out the government had accelerated one aspect of the tax reform through the waiving of stamp duty on new residential blocks - albeit just for one year. &ldquo;This is not a forever thing,&rdquo; Mr Barr said in reference to the rate relief announced on Wednesday. &ldquo;It is not sustainable to do it forever.&rdquo; Mr Barr said it was necessary for the government to increase spending to prop up the economy during the recession. But he warned that once the economy did bounce back, the government would need to start repairing the budget position. The Canberra Liberals, which have pledged to freeze residential rates for their first four years of government if they win October&rsquo;s election, were cynical about Mr Barr&rsquo;s announcement. &ldquo;Nobody is fooled by Labor&rsquo;s desperate backflip on rates, just four months out from an election,&rdquo; Mr Coe said. &ldquo;After creating this mess, this inadequate and half-hearted attempt at cleaning it up isn&rsquo;t rolling anyone. &ldquo;Labor has proven time and time again that increasing rates is in their DNA. &ldquo;Labor&rsquo;s tired and outdated philosophy is and always has been to tax people &lsquo;til they bleed but not until they die&rsquo;. It just what they do.&rdquo; Canberra Business Chamber chief executive Graham Catt, whose organisation hosted the event, welcomed the rate relief. But Mr Catt said further rates reform was needed, in particular to the &ldquo;controversial&rdquo; commercial tax regime, which he said was leading to higher rents and reduced property values across the ACT. Owners Corporation Network president Gary Petherbridge accused Mr Barr of using the COVID-19 crisis as cover to wind back an unpopular policy ahead of this year&rsquo;s election. Mr Petherbridge was disappointed that unit owners would not benefit from the same level of rate decreases as homeowners. He again called on the ACT government to release the findings of an independent review of the tax reform program, which was commissioned late last year. Mr Barr used the State of the Territory address to frame a high-level vision for the territory&rsquo;s recovery from the twin health and economic crisis sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic. He described government spending as an &ldquo;important and powerful tool&rdquo; during any downturn, arguing now wasn&rsquo;t the time to be chasing budget surpluses. But while there was a promise of rates relief, Mr Barr didn&rsquo;t use the platform to announce any new spending or infrastructure programs - much to the disappointment of the Master Builders Association of the ACT. READ MORE: Mr Barr said while the ACT still had the nation&rsquo;s lowest unemployment rate, the economic crisis had hit Canberrans hard, particularly those who were struggling prior to the pandemic. He again pointed out that women and young people would, for different reasons, be disproportionately affected by the crisis. In explaining the types of economic support rolled out to households and business during the crisis, Mr Barr said the government had recognised the &ldquo;past failings&rdquo; of previous stimulus packages and focused primarily on delivering support through automatically applied rebates. He said that meant ratepayers didn&rsquo;t have to go through &ldquo;onerous and confusing&rdquo; application processes. He claimed the Morrison&rsquo;s government&rsquo;s JobKeeper wage subsidy scheme was the &ldquo;biggest and most egregious&rdquo; example of a confusing application process. Problems associated with the application process was to blame for the counting error which caused the cost of the scheme to be revised down from $130 billion to $70 billion, he claimed. Some of the ACT government&rsquo;s support measures have required applications, including the rate rebate scheme for commercial and residential landlords. The Canberra Times this week reported the take up of both schemes had been far lower than projected.</p>

<p>(Reuters) – The United States on Tuesday sued former national security adviser John Bolton, seeking to block him from publishing a book about his time in the White House that it said contained classified information and would compromise national security.</p>
<p>The civil lawsuit came one day after U.S. President Donald Trump said Bolton would be breaking the law if the book were published.</p>
<p>Trump fired Bolton last September after roughly 17 months as national security adviser.</p>
<p>Trump told reporters on Monday that Bolton knows he has classified information in his book, and that he had not completed a clearing process required for any book written by former government officials who had access to sensitive information.</p>
<p>Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department was trying to get Bolton to complete the clearance process and “make the necessary deletions of classified information.”</p>
<p>Bolton’s “The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,” is set to be published on June 23.</p>
<p>The publisher, Simon and Schuster, said in a news release on Friday the book provides an insider account of Trump’s “inconsistent, scattershot decision-making process.”</p>
<p>The book details Trump’s dealings with China, Russia, Ukraine, North Korea, Iran, Britain, France and Germany, the publisher said.</p>
<p>“This is the book Donald Trump doesn’t want you to read,” Simon and Schuster said.</p>

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott tried to tamp down fears of a second coronavirus wave on Tuesday as the state set new records for daily cases and hospitalizations.</p>
<p>The Lone Star State’s health department tallied 2,622 new infections, the most reported in a single day since the beginning of the pandemic.</p>
<p>There was also a new record for COVID-19 hospitalizations for the eighth time in nine days, with 2,518 — an increase of nearly 200 since Monday.</p>
<p>“It does raise concerns, but there is no reason right now to be alarmed,” Abbott said, urging people to wear masks and stay home as much as possible.</p>
<p>Abbott pointed to an uptick in testing and reporting delays as reasons for the jump in daily case numbers.</p>
<p>He also placed some of the blame on folks under 30 going maskless or flouting social distancing rules at “bar-type settings” or Memorial Day celebrations.</p>
<p>“We think we can also accurately say there has been an increase — especially beginning around the Memorial Day time period and going through a few weeks after that — an increase in people testing positive because they may not be practicing all these safe standards,” Abbott said.</p>
<p>The Republican governor assured people that Texas’ health care system could withstand the surges in cases and hospitalizations with nearly 15,000 open beds, including nearly 1,700 in intensive care units.</p>
<p>Texas began aggressively reopening on May 1, and continued to lift its lockdown, despite the increase in infections. In just the past week, Abbott allowed retailers, restaurants and amusement parks to increase capacity.</p>
<p>At least two other states, Florida and Arizona, have also seen an increase in cases in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The Sunshine State on Tuesday tallied 2,783 new cases — setting a record for the fourth time in six days.</p>
<p>New cases in the Grand Canyon State hit a daily high of nearly 2,400 — almost double the previous record, health officials said. The state also reported 25 additional deaths, while hospital intensive care units were hovering around 80 percent capacity.</p>

(Reuters) — (Reuters) — The U.S. Department of Commerce on Tuesday posted a new rule that allows U.S. companies to work with China’s Huawei to develop standards for 5G and other cutting-edge technologies, despite restrictions on doing business with the telecommunications equipment maker. Reuters reported on Monday that the rule had been approved and sent to the Federal Register, the official U.S. publication for rules. It was posted for public inspection on the Federal Register’s website on Tuesday and is scheduled to be formally published on Thursday.</p>
<p>The rule amends the Huawei “entity listing,” which restricts sales of U.S. goods and technology to the company. The United States placed Huawei on the list in May 2019, citing national security concerns. The amendment authorizes the release of certain technology to Huawei and its affiliates if it contributes “to the revision or development of a ‘standard’ in a ‘standards organization.’”</p>
<p>Industry and government officials have said the entity listing backfired in standards settings. With U.S. companies uncertain what technology they could share, some U.S. engineers did not engage, and Huawei gained a stronger voice, they said.</p>
<p>Huawei and 114 of its foreign affiliates on the Entity List “continue to participate in many important international standards organizations in which U.S. companies also participate,” the new rule says. “As international standards serve as the building blocks for product development and help ensure functionality, interoperability and safety of the products,” it noted, “it is important to U.S. technological leadership that U.S. companies be able to work in these bodies in order to ensure that U.S. standards proposals are fully considered.”</p>

<p>Naomi Wilson of the Information Technology Industry Council, which represents tech companies, said the rule was a “long-awaited step to clarify that U.S. companies can participate in international standards bodies – even where certain listed entities are present.”</p>
<p>Boston lawyer Andy Updegrove, who has represented over 150 standards organizations, said he found one catch: Not all standards consortiums may meet the requirements in the rule. To do so, he said, some may change the way they work, but other foreign ones may not. “Overall, it’s a big improvement, but it’s not going to help U.S. companies in every case,” Updegrove said.</p>
<p>Huawei said in a statement it wants to continue standards discussions with counterparts, including those in the United States, and that “inclusiveness and productive dialogue will better promote” their formulation and encourage development.
