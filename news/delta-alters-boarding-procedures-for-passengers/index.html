(CNN) – Delta Airlines is changing how passengers board its planes. It’s the company’s latest effort to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>Passengers will now board planes from the back to the front and fliers will have to wait until their row is called.</p>
<p>The idea is to have people interact less while getting to their seats.</p>
<p>Delta says the change will stay in place at least through May 31.</p>
<p>First class passengers and diamond medallion members will be able to board as usual.

<h3 id="taiwanese-passengers-on-evacuation-flight-fro">Taiwanese passengers on evacuation flight fro&hellip;</h3>

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Passengers who had been on the first of two flights that brought Taiwanese nationals back from China last month were able to return home Monday (April 13) after 14 days of quarantine.</p>
<p>In order to evacuate nationals stranded in China&rsquo;s Hubei province due to the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), the Taiwanese government arranged flights for them through China Airlines on March 29 and 30. The first batch of 153 passengers was released Monday morning after spending two weeks in quarantine, reported CNA.</p>
<p>The quarantine site, located between New Taipei and Taoyuan, had been planning for a stream of vehicles since early morning, hoping to successfully transport the newly released patients back to their homes. Meanwhile, police conducted security checks and directed traffic in the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Many of the patients&rsquo; family members arrived at the quarantine site before 5 a.m.</p>
<p>Each person had their temperature checked and underwent disinfection at a checkpoint before being released. At 6:00 a.m., many were picked up by their families, while others took buses to the Taoyuan High Speed Rail (HSR) Station or the Taoyuan Airport MRT line to get home.</p>
<p>“It was an easy ordeal,” according to Wu (吳), an evacuee who had been China for nearly three months and locked down in Hubei for more than 70 days.</p>
<p>Wu, who had already bought a house in Hubei, explained that he had been visiting relatives with his wife on Jan. 15 and that he had not expected to stay for so long.</p>
<p>After Taiwan had announced the two flights, many people hired cars and traveled from Hubei to Shanghai in order to board the flight home. The taxi fare alone cost nearly RMB$1,500 (USD$212.73) per person.</p>
<p>After returning to Taiwan, he was placed under quarantine for 14 days. Wu stated that the meals provided at the quarantine site were very lavish and that the staff members were all extremely nice.</p>
<p>“Even if you can’t eat because of physical discomfort,” he said, “the staff will still give you some bread or instant noodles at night.”</p>
<p>As his son, who was also held up in China, was about to take the college entrance examination, the two of them hurried back to Taiwan first. Wu’s wife, who has not yet obtained a Taiwanese identity card, stayed in Hubei but said that &ldquo;Taiwan is the safest place in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While stuck in China, Wu’s son worried that he would not be able to keep up with school assignments. During this period, however, students offered support and encouragement, and each day&rsquo;s lessons were sent to him online by classmates.</p>
<p>In addition, his school has agreed to count students’ academic grades as their exam results. “I hope to get back home quickly and go back to school tomorrow,” he said.

<h3 id="can-we-take-motorcycle-taxis-clashing-regulations-leave-passengers-confused">Can we take motorcycle taxis? Clashing regulations leave passengers confused</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.jakpost.net/c/2020/04/12/2020_04_12_92502_1586663416._large.jpg" alt="img">
The government’s guidelines on transportation controls during the implementation of large-scale social restrictions (PSBB) to contain COVID-19 have sparked criticism for being ambiguous and clashing with other regulations, leaving many confused.</p>
<p>On April 9, the Transportation Ministry issued ministerial regulation No.18/2020 on transportation controls to slow the spread of COVID-19. Among other things, it allows app-based ojek (motorcycle taxi) drivers to serve passengers, so long as they comply with health protocols, which include wearing masks and gloves, disinfecting vehicles before and after use and not driving when not feeling well.</p>
<p>Civil groups and politicians were quick to lambast the regulation, signed by acting Transportation Minister Luhut Pandjaitan, as it clashes with Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto’s regulation on PSBB guidelines, meaning enforcement will be challenging.</p>
<p>“According to Health Ministerial Regulation No.9/2020 on PSBB guidelines, app-based ojek drivers can only transport goods, not passengers,” said Djoko Setijowarno, a transportation observer from the Indonesia Transportation Society (MTI) on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Transportation Ministry regulation also contradicts Jakarta Gubernatorial Regulation No.33/2020 on PSBB status, which permits app-based ojek to transport goods only, he added.</p>
<p>Incoherent regulations have left law enforcement officers, transportation operators and the public confused about whether ojek drivers are still permitted to transport passengers during the two-week PSBB period in Jakarta, which started on April 10. PSBB status will be enforced in Jakarta’s satellite cities of Bogor, Depok and Bekasi in West Java beginning April 15.</p>
<p>Djoko also questioned how the Transportation Ministry could monitor and ensure all app-based ojek drivers and passengers complied with the health protocols.</p>
<p>“On a practical level, who is going to monitor whether the health protocols are being followed by the drivers and passengers? How will the temperatures of drivers and passengers be checked?” he said. “On a practical level, this regulation is hard to monitor.”</p>
<p>Public policy observer Agus Pambagio also highlighted the inconsistencies in the regulations, and argued that permitting ojek drivers to carry passengers would undermine the effectiveness of the large-scale social restrictions.</p>
<p>“COVID-19 will continue to spread if passengers are allowed to be transported using two-wheel vehicles, both for commercial and personal purposes. Thus, I beg the Transportation Ministry to revoke or revise ministerial regulation No.18/2020, as soon as possible,” said Agus.</p>
<p>Tulus Abadi, the chairman of the Indonesia Consumers Foundation (YLKI), also called on the government to scrap or revise the regulation on the grounds that it did not take into account the safety and security of customers during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Responding to the criticism and confusion, the Transportation Ministry held an online press conference on Sunday. Spokesperson Adita Irawaty said the ministry maintained the point stated in the regulation that motorcycles could still be used to transport passengers, both for personal or commercial reasons, so long as health protocols were followed.</p>
<p>“However, we will monitor the situation in the field and may evaluate and make changes to the regulation,” said Adita.</p>
<p>Ride-hailing service providers such as Gojek and Grab disabled their ojek services on Friday in Jakarta, the first day of PSBB implementation in the capital.</p>
<p>Gojek chief of corporate affairs Nila Marita said the company welcomed the Transportation Ministry regulation and is waiting for the regulation to come into effect to make adjustments.</p>
<p>“The issuance of the regulation will help people to travel and do [certain] activities that are still allowed under the PSBB terms. On the other hand, it can also help our driver partners to maintain their income to support their families,” said Nila on Monday. Gojek has provided its driver partners in Greater Jakarta and other cities with health equipment packages.</p>
<p>Grab Indonesia’s head of public affairs Tri Sukma Anreianno said that company was making preparations to ensure its driver partners were ready to comply with the health protocols stipulated in the Transportation Ministry regulation once it was implemented.</p>
<p>“We are still waiting for the regulation to be officially implemented. On behalf of our driver partners, we want to thank the government for listening to our input and our drivers’ input regarding the regulation,” he said.
