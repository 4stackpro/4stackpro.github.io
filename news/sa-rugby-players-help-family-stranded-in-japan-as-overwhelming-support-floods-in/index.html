A South African family, whose two-week holiday in Japan quickly turned into a nightmare when they became stranded in East Asia, can breathe a sigh of relief as Good Samaritans have stepped in to help.</p>
<p>Among the flood of support are three A-list South African rugby players - RG Snyman, Lionel Cronje and Jason Jenkins - who have secured the family a place to stay while they try make to their way back home.</p>
<p>The Hofman family – Melissa, Adrian and their seven-year-old son Cameron – left for Japan on 14 March when South Africa had not yet announced a lockdown.</p>
<p>During their stay, however, South Africa went into lockdown, with flight restrictions on all international flights.</p>
<p>Now trapped in Japan, the family have been running up charges on their credit card, spending money they do not have and living on minute noodles in a cheap hotel.</p>
<p>“The day that we got the news that we were stranded in Japan was the day that we just roamed around the streets in circles not knowing what to do!</p>
<p>“At night, we would wake up and panic at the thought of having been locked out of our home country. Support WhatsApp groups had started, which assisted us in realising that we are not alone,” Melissa Hofman told News24 on Monday.</p>
<p>Helping hand</p>
<p>When Cronje heard about the family’s plight, he rallied the support of his friends and colleagues in Japan and they provided a helping hand.</p>
<p>Hofman said she was in “disbelief” when she received a call from Cronje, who said he, Snyman and Jenkins would offer assistance.</p>
<p>“I never thought that the SA rugby team would be working as our booking agents for additional accommodation.</p>
<p>“They have managed to secure a spacious apartment for us in Tokyo. This will be a mansion in comparison to the current 3m x 3m hotel room we are currently inhabiting,” Hofman said.</p>
<p>Speaking to News24, Cronje said they saw News24’s article about the plight of the family and felt they had to act.</p>
<p>“We decided to give her a call and offer to help. It’s a difficult thing to do because you don’t want to impose yourself, especially because you don’t know them in person.</p>
<p>“But she shared her situation with us, and she welcomed the support with open arms. We were really happy for that!”</p>
<p>Adrian, Cameron and Melissa Hofmann at Ueno Park in Tokyo. (Supplied)</p>
<p>Cronje added the situation in Japan is currently uncertain.</p>
<p>Covid-19 could mean people staying in hotels will be asked to leave, should there be a lockdown.</p>
<p>“We were aware that they had a lovely son and it would be difficult going day by day with this kind of uncertainty, so we offered to secure them an Airbnb nearby, which would at least allow them the security of a place to stay.”</p>
<p>Many more have stepped forward to offer the family help and they now feel more at ease.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed</p>
<p>The family have been “overwhelmed” by emails and messages from people extending a helping hand.</p>
<p>“I also need to thank everyone that has reached out to us; those that have offered us their own homes and food, and those that have offered us financial assistance. The responses have been overwhelming,” Hofman said.</p>
<p>“Although South Africa is our home, the people that have reached out to us make us feel we have family all over the world,” she added.</p>

<p>Acts of kindness like these can unite people, especially during these tough times, Cronje said.</p>
<p>“Many people think that asking for help or accepting support is a weakness but, if we pull together and help each other through these tough times, it becomes a chain reaction and the links become stronger and unbreakable!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>“So, I hope we can hold onto each other in South Africa through these challenging times and come out on top, like we have as country in so many ways before.”</p>
<p>Hofman said they had received good news that a flight had been scheduled to return home on 19 April. However, the family are still hoping a repatriation flight will be arranged for them at an earlier time.

<h3 id="coronavirus--sabc-backs-its-programming-after-anc-led-alliance-questions-output">Coronavirus | SABC backs its programming after ANC-led alliance questions output</h3>
<p><img src="http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10070/753d87e54f7a40caafb1f132b63e6fc1.jpg" alt="img">
The SABC has defended its programming after a letter penned by the ANC-led tripartite alliance emerged criticising the public broadcaster for &ldquo;not fulfilling its mandate&rdquo; during the national lockdown to halt the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p>Speaking to News24, SABC spokesperson Mmoni Seapolelo said the public broadcaster was firmly committed to adhering to and delivering diligently on its mandate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Critically, during this period the public broadcaster&rsquo;s role is to ensure that millions of South Africans are provided with important and credible information regarding Covid-19 across television, radio and digital platforms. This is consistent with nationwide efforts to reduce Covid-19 infections and curb the spread of the coronavirus,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, News24 reported that the trio of ANC secretary general Ace Magashule, SACP first deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila and Cosatu&rsquo;s general secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali wrote to President Cyril Ramaphosa, raising the matter of the public broadcaster&rsquo;s content during this period.</p>
<p>In their letter, the tripartite alliance secretariat said the SABC must marshal all resources at its disposal and play a leading role in the fight against the pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In particular, the people need more educational, informative and consistent broadcasting on Covid-19 including live coverage of key events on SABC free-to-air television stations,&rdquo; the secretariat said.</p>

<p>Seapolelo, however, denied that not enough informative content was on its channels, citing the SABC&rsquo;s partnership with the education department to broadcast a learner support campaign. The drive is geared at delivering educational programming during the lockdown period.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Displace revenue-generating programming&rsquo;</p>
<p>The first phase of the campaign is being broadcast on SABC1, with the second phase to be rolled out on SABC2 and SABC3, Seapolelo said.</p>
<p>She added news, current affairs and informative programming have been extended on free-to-air television channels and radio stations to ensure that the public is adequately informed about the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the interest of the country and in fulfillment of its mandate, the SABC has had to displace revenue-generating programming across platforms to accommodate all public announcements and media briefings relating to the Covid-19 pandemic,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are now carried live on the SABC&rsquo;s free-to-air television channels, the SABC News channel, radio stations and digital platforms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consistently, SABC News journalists are deployed across the country to deliver the essential service of informing the public about all developments regarding the pandemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the SABC, we welcome engagement with and feedback from our stakeholders, and we would like to reiterate our unwavering commitment to providing citizens with valuable and factual news and information during this period.&rdquo;

<h3 id="lockdown-lunch--i-hope-you-will-find-it-in-your-hearts-to-forgive-me---ndabeni-abrahams-apologises">Lockdown lunch | &lsquo;I hope you will find it in your hearts to forgive me&rsquo; - Ndabeni-Abrahams apologises</h3>
<p><img src="http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/10070/9691dd05dbb34ae4b5542273838a0998.jpg" alt="img">
Communications and Digital Technologies Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams has appealed to South Africans to &ldquo;find it in your hearts to forgive me&rdquo; for having lunch at a friend&rsquo;s house during a nationwide lockdown aimed at curbing the spread of the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>Her apology followed a directive from President Cyril Ramaphosa on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The news of the lunch broke when a picture of Ndabeni-Abrahams having lunch with former deputy minister of higher education Mduduzi Manana at his home went viral on social media. In the picture, the two are seated at a table along with other people.</p>
<p>The president then summoned her to a meeting to discuss the issue and put her on special leave for two months, docking one month&rsquo;s pay.</p>
<p>In a video on Wednesday, Ndabeni-Abrahams apologised to Ramaphosa and all South Africans.</p>
<p>READ | Hundreds of Post Offices remain open during lockdown – but you won’t be getting any mail</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellow South Africans, I would like to convey an apology to President Cyril Ramaphosa, the national command centre [and] the South African society at large for breaching lockdown rules put in place to curb the spread of Covid-19,&rdquo; Ndabeni-Abrahams said in the video.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met with the president yesterday (Tuesday) after a photo was circulated on social media, showing myself at the home of Mr Mduduzi Manana during the lockdown and social distancing period,&rdquo; Ndabeni-Abrahams said.</p>
<p>She added that she regretted her actions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I regret the incident and I am deeply sorry for my actions. I hope the president and you, South Africans, will find it in your hearts to forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said would abide by Ramaphosa&rsquo;s directives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The president has put me on special leave. I undertake to abide by the conditions of the leave,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Ndabeni-Abrahams also took the opportunity to reiterate Ramaphosa&rsquo;s call for all South Africans to stay at home and observe lockdown regulations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are a necessary intervention to curb the spread of a virus that has devastated many nations,&rdquo; she said.
