Josh Maja: How the striker has fared at Bordeaux since his acrimonious transfer seen in Sunderland &lsquo;Til I Die season 2</p>
<p>The 21-year-old has been in France for more than a year now with a new documentary shedding light on his drawn out departure from Wearside</p>
<p>By James Gray Wednesday, 1st April 2020, 4:33 pm Updated Wednesday, 1st April 2020, 4:36 pm</p>

<p>Josh Maja was something of a breakout star of Sunderland &lsquo;Til I Die in the first season of the behind-the-scenes Netflix documentary which was released to UK viewers just after midnight on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>In a campaign that saw the Black Cats relegated for the second time in two years, Maja was a homegrown player who seemed to buck the dressing room trend of apathy by firing in passionate, hard-working performances.</p>
<p>However, he ended the season with just 12 months left on his contract and turned down the offer of a new deal. Instead, Maja left halfway through the “sequel” to the first series of Sunderland &lsquo;Til I Die, joining French club Bordeaux for a deal that has been optimistically valued at £3.5million, although the up-front payment was little more than a million, a relative pittance for a striker with a bright future ahead of him and one who had already bagged 15 goals in 24 league games in 2018-19.</p>

<p>But how has the Nigeria international, who made his debut for the country in September, fared since switching the north east coast for wine country?</p>
<p>Maja&rsquo;s move to France features heavily in the documentary (Photo: Getty)</p>
<p>It was never likely to be a simple switch. Londoner Maja had only turned 20 a month before sealing the move to France, a young age to cope with what turned out to be a never-ending stream of abuse from Sunderland fans who felt he had betrayed them.</p>
<p>“I ignore it all,” he said in an interview with The Times last year in which he also revealed that he no longer reads the comments on his Twitter posts or Instagram account. “I’m thick-skinned but, if you read it, then it can get to you.”</p>
<p>Instead, he tried to focus on his football but it proved difficult. Ricardo Gomes was the manager who signed him, and characterised the move as a “gamble” because he did not know much about him, but he was sacked five weeks after the striker arrived. He was replaced by former QPR, Swansea and Leicester boss Paulo Sousa, but things did not improve much. He ended his first season in France with just three starts to his name and zero 90-minute appearances.</p>
<p>Maja says he wanted to stay at Sunderland but could not agree a contract with the club (Photo: Getty)</p>
<p>“For me it was a risk I wanted to take, I wanted to be challenged,” he said of the move, claiming a proposed Premier League switch would have limited his game-time. Initially, it appeared he had made the wrong decision.</p>
<p>However, Maja persisted and he slowly began to earn the trust of Sousa, scoring in the second game of the current season, an important equaliser at home to Montpellier having come off the bench at half-time. He added further strikes against Dijon and Reims but announced himself properly against Nimes. His first of the game was a cute finish from the edge of the area having held off a defender with his strength, the second was a cool finish after being slipped into the box and he completed his hat-trick by springing the offside trap and passing the ball past the goalkeeper.</p>
<p>Local newspaper Sud Ouest described the performance as “the fruits of patience” in their headline. Within another month, fans were voting in polls asking for him to be given the permanent berth up front. Jimmy Briand, 34, has seven goals to Maja’s six, but the Nigerian is now the natural successor to the journeyman of French football.

Josh Maja left Sunderland to join Ligue 1 outfit Bordeaux in January 2019. The move is documented in Sunderland &lsquo;Til I Die Season 2, which dropped on Netflix this week.</p>
<p>Maja came through the youth ranks at Sunderland and broke into the first-team during the first season of the Netflix show.</p>
<p>That campaign ended with the Black Cats being relegated to League One, with Maja entering the final 12 months of his contract.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old made a brilliant start to the 2018/19 season, scoring 15 goals in 24 appearances in the third tier.</p>
<p>His performances saw him linked with a host of top clubs from around Europe.</p>

And Josh Maja’s departure from Sunderland undoubtedly delivered their promotion chances a hammer blow.</p>
<p>The fledgling striker plundered 16 goals in just 30 appearances for the Black Cats in their first campaign back in the third tier.</p>
<p>With his deal due to expire at the end of the season, Sunderland were unsurprisingly keen to tie one of their prized assets down with a new contract.</p>

<p>But with plenty of potential suitors elsewhere, Maja delayed putting pen to paper on a fresh deal.</p>
<p>And in the second series of Sunderland Til I Die, released on Netflix this morning, it was revealed that Pompey were apparently one of clubs interested.</p>
<p>In episode two, owner Stewart Donald and head of football operations Richard Hill were discussing Maja&rsquo;s contractual situation.</p>
<p>Hill revealed Premier League heavyweights Tottenham had run the rule over the marksman – but Pompey were seemingly also keen.</p>

<p>The former Eastleigh boss said: ‘The initial offer we made Josh, we then increased it considerably.</p>
<p>‘The last time I spoke to Josh with the new offer, he just said you need to speak to my agent.</p>
<p>‘I&rsquo;ve spoken to his agent and said &ldquo;This is it, full and final&rdquo;. He&rsquo;s had it emailed, said I&rsquo;ll come back to you but still hasn&rsquo;t come back to me.</p>
<p>‘We&rsquo;re hearing all sorts. Tottenham have been to watch him six, seven, eight, nine times.</p>
<p>‘Was he told that Portsmouth were interested in him?’</p>
<p>Maja departed Sunderland in January 2019 to join Ligue 1 outfit Bordeaux for a reported fee of £3.5m</p>
<p>The Black Cats tried to replace the youngster with John Marquis, who moved to Fratton Park last summer.</p>
