Basketball fans are eagerly awaiting the next two episodes of ESPN’s Chicago Bulls documentary, The Last Dance, which are set to air on Sunday night.</p>
<p>The documentary–which centers around the 1997-98 Bulls–has provided fans with much-needed content amid the absence of sports due to the coronavirus, and each episode thus far has had an angle.</p>
<p>The premier focused primarily on Michael Jordan, the predominant superstar who helped the NBA’s popularity explode in the 80s and 90s. Episode 2 centered around Scottie Pippen, the do-it-all small forward who has garnered a reputation as the ultimate “sidekick” in sports.</p>
<p>One of the next two episodes will take a closer look at Chicago’s third star: enigmatic small forward Dennis Rodman.</p>
<p>Former Bulls center Joe Kleine spoke about what it was like to be Rodman’s teammate, recounting how the team used to have fake film sessions merely to prevent Rodman from flying to Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Ahead of Episodes 3 and 4 of #TheLastDance former Arkansas and Bulls center @SlaterMoJoe joined @ChrisDoering and @PeterBurnsESPN to reveal what it was like to play with The Worm during the &lsquo;97-&lsquo;98 season. pic.twitter.com/tcYRkiDDFm — College Sports on SiriusXM (@SXMCollege) April 26, 2020</p>
<p>Rodman came into the NBA as a scrawny and athletic wing who would eventually mold himself into one of the best defenders in the league during his years with the Detroit Pistons.</p>
<p>By the time he came to the Bulls ahead of the 1995-96 season, however, Rodman had become a staple in pop culture due to his ever-changing hair color and eccentric personality.</p>
<p>Rodman was still one of the best defenders and rebounders in the NBA during this time, but he had also developed an affinity for partying. This obviously ran counter to Jordan’s mindset as one of the most ruthless and focused competitors in the history of basketball.</p>
<p>Catch the next two episodes of The Last Dance on ESPN starting at 9 p.m. EST.

<h3 id="dennis-rodman-once-brought-pearl-jam-along-for-a-car-ride-with-chris-mullin">Dennis Rodman once brought Pearl Jam along for a car ride with Chris Mullin</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nbcsports.com/chicago/sites/csnchicago/files/2020/04/26/rodman%2Bfoot%2Blocker%2Bad_1.jpg" alt="img">
It&rsquo;s Dennis Rodman Night, as Episodes 3 and 4 of &ldquo;The Last Dance&rdquo; promise to delve into The Worm&rsquo;s eccentricities and the Bulls&rsquo; rivalry with the Bad Boy Pistons in the late 1980s and early &rsquo;90s.</p>
<p>Thus, stories from his days in the league have trickled out in force over the past week. Many revolved around his on-court antics, which featured a litany of in-game squabbles, technicals, ejections and suspensions over the course of his career.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s one that illustrates the near-incomparable level of pop culture acclaim Rodman reached during his time in the NBA, as told by Chris Mullin in an article by Monte Poole of NBC Sports Bay Area:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mullin recalls the night in the early 1990s, when he was with the Warriors and Rodman was with the Spurs, that resulted in a brief but memorable car ride. Hanging around the home locker room at the Oakland Arena, Rodman asked Mullin if he could hitch a ride to the team hotel, the Oakland Airport Hilton. No problem, according to Mullin, who lived in Alameda at the time. One more thing. Rodman wondered if it was OK for a couple of his &lsquo;buddies&rsquo; to ride along. Just hang on, Mullin until I’m ready to leave. &lsquo;I had young kids then, so I had to move a couple car seats,&rsquo; Mullin recalls. &lsquo;No big deal. So, all these little white guys pile into my car. I’m like, whatever. It’s a five-minute ride. I was going to Alameda, so it was a short ride.&rsquo; &lsquo;Later, on, I find out it was Pearl Jam. At the time, they were called Mookie Blaylock. It was that group. They were (Rodman’s) boys back then.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, in addition to Rodman at one time dating Madonna and marrying Carmen Electra, he also enjoyed a close kinship with the members of Pearl Jam. In fact, as our K.C. Johnson recently recalled, Eddie Vedder was an attendee for Game 3 of the 1996 NBA Finals between the Bulls and SuperSonics in Seattle (Vedder would neither confirm nor deny any shenanigans with Rodman the night before the game).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s another example of the peculiar magnetism of Rodman and the wide-spanning, cross-cultural impact of the 1990s Bulls, at large.</p>
<p>Hopefully, there will be more stories to come when Episodes 3 and 4 of &ldquo;The Last Dance&rdquo; debut.</p>

<h3 id="mark-cuban-still-has-copies-of-dennis-rodmans-no-69-jersey-that-david-stern-vetoed">Mark Cuban still has copies of Dennis Rodman’s no. 69 jersey that David Stern vetoed</h3>
<p><img src="https://clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Mark-Cuban-still-has-copies-of-Dennis-Rodman_s-no.-69-jersey-that-David-Stern-vetoed-1-1000x600.jpg" alt="img">
NBA Hall of Famer Dennis Rodman will always be remembered for his stints with the Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls — where he won his five NBA titles. All in all, “The Worm” played for three other NBA franchises which include a rather forgettable one-year stint with the Dallas Mavericks in the 1999-2000 season.</p>
<p>In true Rodman fashion, the 6-foot-7 controversial slotman chose an interesting jersey number upon his arrival in Dallas. The two-time Defensive Player of the Year wanted to wear no. 69, which then NBA commissioner David Stern understandably vetoed. Rodman went with number 70 instead.</p>
<p>Per Marc Stein of The York Times, Cuban’s purchase of the Mavs has yet to be ratified at the time. However, he still possesses some of Rodman’s printed no.69 jerseys today.</p>
<p>In subsequent tweets, Stein also revealed the extent of Rodman’s famed work ethic while in Dallas, as well as the events that led to his exit with the team.</p>
<p>On one morning Don Nelson scrapped shootaround, Dirk Nowitzki was working out with shot doctor Holger Gescwindner when Rodman strolled in. Dennis went from basket to basket at the Landry Center hurling the ball as hard as he could at the glass to work on rebounding … by himself — Marc Stein (@TheSteinLine) April 27, 2020</p>
<p>Rodman liked to shower before games (often while Nellie gave instructions) and skip showers afterward to lift weights. He got ejected twice in 12 games, suspended once for sitting on the floor and averaged 11.2 RPG over 29 of the longest days in team (and beat writing) history — Marc Stein (@TheSteinLine) April 27, 2020</p>
<p>Last straw: After a loss that dropped Dallas to 3-9, Rodman blasted Cuban for being too close to the team &ldquo;like Jerry Jones&rdquo; and ripped virtually everyone on the roster by saying the Mavs needed “a backup center, a starting center, a true power forward, a couple of guards” — Marc Stein (@TheSteinLine) April 27, 2020</p>
<p>Dennis Rodman only played 12 games for Dallas but made a real difference despite already being 38 years old at the time. He averaged a whopping 14.3 rebounds during that stretch and even shot a career-best 71.4 percent from the foul line.</p>
<p>That season with the Mavericks proved to be Rodman’s final year in the NBA. He also had brief stints with the San Antonio Spurs and Los Angeles Lakers. The rebounding menace took his act overseas and retired from professional basketball in 2006.</p>
<p>Although we never saw it officially on the hardwood, that no. 69 will indeed be one of the most valuable uniforms that never was.
