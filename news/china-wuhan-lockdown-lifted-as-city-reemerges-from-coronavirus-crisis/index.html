(CNN) China has ended its lockdown of Wuhan, the original epicenter of the coronavirus crisis , as the city reemerges from a deadly outbreak that is now raging across the globe.</p>
<p>But even as Wuhan reopens its borders after 76 days, some restrictions within the city will remain in place, and officials warn that the threat of further infections remains far from over.</p>
<p>The metropolis of 11 million, where the coronavirus was first detected in December, had been sealed off from the outside world since January 23 in an unprecedented effort to contain the outbreak.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, healthy residents and visitors will finally be allowed to leave Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, with trains and flights resumed and highway entrances reopened.</p>
<p>Wuhan&rsquo;s railway authority estimated more than 55,000 passengers will leave Wuhan by train Wednesday, with about 40% bound for the Pearl River Delta region, a major manufacturing hub in China, according to state broadcaster CCTV.</p>
<p>The easing of travel restrictions on Wuhan is the latest milestone in China&rsquo;s fight against Covid-19. The country reported nearly zero new local infections in recent weeks, leading to similar restrictive measures being lifted for other parts of Hubei province late last month.</p>
<p>Luo Ping, an epidemic control official in Wuhan, told CCTV Sunday that the lifting of the lockdown marks a &ldquo;full restart&rdquo; of the city&rsquo;s economic and social activities from their previous &ldquo;suspension.&rdquo; But he warned the city faces an arduous task preventing imported cases and a recurrence of local infections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After work and production resumed, the movement of people increased and so did the risk of cross-infections from mass gatherings. Some residents have dropped their guard and don&rsquo;t wear masks when they go on the streets,&rdquo; he told the broadcaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reopening of Wuhan does not mean the all-clear, neither does it mean a relaxing of epidemic prevention and control measures (within the city),&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Passengers wear facemasks as they form a queue at the Wuhan Wuchang Railway Station in Wuhan, early on April 8, as they prepare to leave the city for the first time in more than ten weeks.</p>
<p>A city brought to a halt</p>
<p>Wuhan, a sprawling industrial hub on the banks of the Yangtze River, reported more than 50,000 infections and over 2,500 deaths, accounting for 77% of all coronavirus deaths across China, according to the National Health Commission.</p>
<p>As the outbreak swept the city, much of Wuhan was brought to a halt by strict epidemic control measures &ndash; some of which would later be introduced throughout the world as the virus spread to more than 200 countries and territories, infecting more than 1.4 million people worldwide</p>
<p>For more than two months, public transport in Wuhan was suspended, businesses were shut and millions of residents were confined to their homes and residential communities &ndash; not even allowed to go outside for grocery shopping.</p>
<p>The draconian measures apparently worked. By mid-March, the number of new infections had slowed to a trickle from thousands per day at its worst in February. In a major show of confidence, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Wuhan on March 10, praising the city and its people for being &ldquo;heroic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People stand near the Yangtze River in the city of Wuhan, on April 6. In recent weeks, officials have gradually eased some of the lockdown measures, allowing a limited number of residents to leave their residential compounds for a short time.</p>
<p>A degree of normalcy amid restrictions</p>
<p>Over the past two weeks, life in Wuhan has gradually gained some semblance of normality.</p>
<p>Residents with a government-assigned green QR code on their mobile phones &ndash; meaning they&rsquo;re healthy and safe to travel &ndash; have been allowed to go back to work as long as their employers issue them a letter.</p>
<p>In residential communities where no new cases have been reported for 14 days, one person per household with a green QR code can leave the compounds two hours per day.</p>
<p>On March 25, public buses started to resume service; three days later, underground trains began running too. Businesses and shops gradually reopened, and cars and pedestrians returned to the city&rsquo;s once-deserted streets.</p>
<p>Luo, the Wuhan official, told CCTV that 10,641 large-scale factories and businesses in the city have reopened as of April 3, accounting for 91.4% of the total.</p>
<p>On Monday, there was even a long line outside the Wuhan Blood Center, following a call from the municipal government for citizens to donate their blood, the state-run People&rsquo;s Daily reported. The center received 874 donors in a day, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>But officials warned that the restrictions on residential communities will remain in place after the lockdown is lifted on Wednesday.</p>
<p>To leave their compounds, residents still need to produce a green QR code and a letter from their employer, Luo said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For now, we still call on citizens to remain vigilant on the epidemic, don&rsquo;t go out unless it&rsquo;s necessary, and wear masks and properly protect yourself when you do,&rdquo; he told CCTV.</p>

<p>Threat of a return of the virus</p>
<p>Chinese health experts have also urged the public to continue to practice caution.</p>
<p>Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told the state-run Health Times on Thursday that China had not seen the end of the epidemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;China is not near the end, but has entered a new stage. With the global epidemic raging, China has not reached the end ,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>With the number of global infections continuing to surge, a growing number of cases have been imported back to China from overseas &ndash; many of them Chinese students and workers eager to return home.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, 698 imported coronavirus cases have been reported by Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>Concerns have also been growing in recent weeks over asymptomatic carriers.</p>
<p>In China, only patients showing symptoms and positive results in nucleic tests are included in the official tally of confirmed cases. Asymptomatic patients who have tested positive are monitored and placed under quarantine until they develop symptoms or turn negative in later tests.</p>
<p>Amid mounting public concerns, China started to announce a separate daily number of asymptomatic carriers last week. Since then, dozens of new asymptomatic carriers have been found in Wuhan everyday, with 673 currently under medical observation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although for now, it seems that the infectiousness of asymptomatic cases are relatively low, they are still infectious and we should be vigilant,&rdquo; Yang Jiong, a respiratory expert at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, told the Health Times on Monday.</p>

<p>Burying the dead</p>
<p>Apart from the easing of travel restrictions, there is another sign that Wuhan is starting to move on from the crisis: It has finally started to bury the dead.</p>
<p>For months, residents in Wuhan had been unable to bury their loved ones, as the government banned all funerals and closed cemeteries on January 25. The remains of thousands of people who died both from coronavirus and other causes were stored at funeral homes. Families were told to await government advice on when they could be collected.</p>
<p>Many would not get to see the body of their loved ones before cremation. To curb the spread of the virus, all bodies of confirmed and suspected coronavirus patients were taken directly from hospitals to funeral homes for cremation, according to a notice issued by the National Health Commission.</p>
<p>Like everything else in the city, the normal process for dealing with grief was put on hold.</p>
<p>In late March, Wuhan residents were finally able to retrieve the ashes of their relatives from funeral homes and find them a resting place, reported the state-run Changjiang Daily, citing an official from the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>The news came just ahead of the Ching Ming, also known as Tomb Sweeping Day, the most important Chinese festival for honoring the dead.</p>
<p>Funeral ceremonies are still not permitted. It is not clear what rituals family members are allowed to observe when laying their loved ones to rest.

<h3 id="the-uks-coronavirus-dashboard-may-be-under-reporting-deaths-significantly">The UK&rsquo;s &lsquo;coronavirus dashboard&rsquo; may be under-reporting deaths significantly</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200326164056-04-london-bracing-coronavirus-surge-0324-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
London (CNN) The UK&rsquo;s daily death toll updates for Covid-19 could be underreporting the true number by a significant margin, according to government numbers published Tuesday.</p>
<p>In its daily tally of deaths, UK government counts only people who tested positive and then died of the virus in hospital. But that doesn&rsquo;t match the number of UK death certificates that list COVID-19 as a factor.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, figures released by the UK&rsquo;s Office of National Statistics (ONS), showed that the 1,568 people had Covid-19 listed on their death certificates between March 5, when the first death was reported, and March 27.</p>
<p>In contrast, death tolls released by Public Health England over the same period show only 926 confirmed deaths due to the virus in England.</p>
<p>There are several factors for the difference. The two tallies are counting different things &ndash; suspected deaths versus confirmed cases that died in the hospital. There may also be a lag in reporting, as ONS have more time to record the deaths.</p>

<h3 id="coronavirus-lockdown-could-give-online-education-a-lasting-boost-in-india">Coronavirus lockdown could give online education a lasting boost in India</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/200327123501-byjus-student-app-1-super-tease.jpg" alt="img">
London (CNN Business) Schools around the world have closed their doors because of the coronavirus pandemic , leaving more than 1.5 billion children stuck at home. While it&rsquo;s a great inconvenience for many, it has created a spike in demand for online learning.</p>
<p>Educational institutions are introducing online courses and some education technology startups are temporarily offering free classes to help offset the impact of school closures.</p>
<p>Take Byju&rsquo;s, an India-based education startup named after its founder, Byju Raveendran. In early March, it announced it would give children free access to its learning app, which it says had more than 40 million users at the end of last year. Around 3 million of those paid between $150 and $200 for an annual subscription.</p>
<p>Since the announcement, the company says it has experienced a 60% surge in students using its products, which range from interactive video lessons and live classes, to quizzes and exam preparation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The outbreak is clearly increasing the appreciation of online education,&rdquo; Raveendran tells CNN Business. &ldquo;This could be a turning point for the industry, ushering in an increased usage of this format and changing habits in terms of how kids learn and how teachers teach,&rdquo; he adds.</p>
<p>Other Indian platforms, including Unacademy Vedantu and Toppr are also offering free classes and content to students.</p>
<p>Changing the learning habit</p>
<p>Google GOOGL and KPMG estimated in a 2017 report that India&rsquo;s online education market would be worth around $2 billion in 2021, up from $250 million in 2016, with the number of paying users rising to 9.6 million.</p>
<p>Those numbers may need significant revision. Raveendran thinks that the current school closures will not only boost online learning but will help to reset India&rsquo;s education system, with less emphasis on preparing for exams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Students just memorize, replicate and then forget when the exam is over,&rdquo; he says. Online learning would enable personalized lesson formats as well as a more engaging, interactive learning process.</p>
<p>Anantha Duraiappah is director of UNESCO&rsquo;s Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Education for Peace and Sustainable Development, which has a vision of &ldquo;transforming education for humanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It [online learning] allows the potential of individualized learning and offers the prospect of radically changing a system that frankly has not changed or evolved over the past 300-odd years,&rdquo; he tells CNN Business.</p>
<p>In 2017, the online learning market in India was projected to be worth around $2 billion by 2021.</p>
<p>A tool to democratize education?</p>
<p>That means education apps are no longer restricted to major urban centers or the wealthier members of society. Byju&rsquo;s says that more than 60% of its students are from outside the 10 largest cities in India.</p>
<p>The app is currently only available in Hindi and English, but Raveendran says Byju&rsquo;s is in the process of adding more regional languages.</p>
<p>Still, millions of children are unable to access online learning through a laptop or cell phone.</p>
<p>Raveendran accepts there is a long way to go. &ldquo;If you look at the total number of school students in India, our penetration is still a very small percentage,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>Byju&rsquo;s originally offered the free service until the end of April, but is likely to extend it, says Raveendran. He also hopes to create a free model for disadvantaged students in India for when schools reopen.</p>
<p>Although the free service will mean a short-term hit to revenue, Raveendran expects that in the long run it will be beneficial to the business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once [pupils] start experiencing the advantages of learning online, we expect a lot of them to continue learning that way,&rdquo; he says.
