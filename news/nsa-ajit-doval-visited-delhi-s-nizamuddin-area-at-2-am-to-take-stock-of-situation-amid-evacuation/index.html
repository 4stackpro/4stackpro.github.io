<p>New Delhi: Even as the Delhi Police was evacuating hundreds of people from Tablighi group&rsquo;s international headquarters Nizamuddin Markaz, National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval visited the southwest Delhi area to take stock of the situation.</p>
<p>According to Delhi Police sources, Doval arrived around 2 am on March 28 and 29 night at the Markaz and interacted with police officials involved in evacuation.</p>
<p>The source said that Doval convinced Tablighi group leader Maulana Saad to get all stuck persons tested for coronavirus infection and quarantine.</p>
<p>According to the sources, the NSA chief knew about the situation building up since the security agencies had tracked down nine corona positive Indonesians in Telangana&rsquo;s Karimnagar with travel history to the Markaz on March 18.</p>
<p>Doval&rsquo;s visit to Nizamuddin area came after the intervention of Home Minister Amit Shah, the sources added. The sources claimed that Doval spoke to Markaz officials and appealed them to held the administration tackle the spread of novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>The NSA also spoke to Police Commissioner S.N. Shrivatsava and took updates on the situation.</p>
<p>The Tablighi Jamaat found itself in the eye of a storm for holding a religious programme during prohibitory orders issued amid the coronavirus scare in the country.</p>
<p>The Markaz has since been evacuated by authorities and evacuees sent into quarantine as 24 of them have tested positive for Coronovirus till late Tuesday night.</p>
<p>The Delhi Police registered a case against Maulana Saad, who led the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi and others on charges of violating government orders and exposing many persons to the threat of Coronavirus.</p>
<p>Maulana Saad and others members of the Tablighi Jamaat have been booked under the Epidemic Disease Act, 1897 and relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.</p>
<p>The government had directed for restrictions on social, political and religious gatherings and safety measures, including social distancing, for prevention and treatment of corona cases.</p>
<p>Delhi Police Crime Branch filed the FIR under Section 3 (penalty for offence) of the Epidemic Disease Act, 1897 and Sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease), 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease), 271 (disobedience to quarantine rule) and 120b (punishment of criminal conspiracy) of the IPC.</p>
<p>Maulana Saad, Dr Zeeshan, Mufti Shehzad, M. Saifi, Younus, and Mohd Salman have been named in the FIR. Police has since traced Maulana Saad&rsquo;s house in Uttar Pradesh&rsquo;s Muzaffarnagar district.</p>
<p>Around 2,100 persons were stuck in the Markaz and it took five days to evacuate the place, the sources said.

<h3 id="markaz-leadership-agreed-to-vacate-nizamuddin-mosque-after-nsa-ajit-doval-intervention">Markaz leadership agreed to vacate Nizamuddin mosque after NSA Ajit Doval intervention</h3>
<p><img src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202004/Ajit_Doval-647x363.jpeg?lLRIvUGrKGxQlRoCAde6KK_UlR_SAshS" alt="img">
The Tablighi Jamaat&rsquo;s Markaz in Nizamuddin West, one of the major Covid-19 hotspots in the country, has now been cleared by the Delhi Police. Initially, however, authorities met resistance from the Markaz leadership after they refused to vacate the premises.</p>
<p>It was only after National Security Adviser Ajit Doval intervened that the leadership cooperated with the police and agreed to vacate the building on the intervening night of March 28-29.</p>
<p>According to sources in the government, NSA Ajit Doval had been in touch with representatives of the Jamaat in Nizamuddin. A delegation from Markaz also held a meeting with the NSA on March 28, during which he tried to defuse the tension amid fears of spread of novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>The sources added that it was after Doval&rsquo;s intervention that the Jamaatis cooperated and agreed to vacate the building in Nizamuddin.</p>
<p>The government has been using NSA&rsquo;s good relations with the Muslim leadership in the past as well while trying to defuse communal tensions. Most recently, Ajit Doval was roped in to diffuse communal tensions during Delhi riots.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday said that out of the 2,361 people who have been evacuated from the area, 617 have been admitted to hospitals while the rest quarantined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The medical staff, administration, police and DTC staff worked together in this 36-hour operation, putting their lives at risk. Hats off to all of them,&rdquo; the deputy chief minister said in a tweet.</p>
<p>The total number of coronavirus cases in Delhi climbed to 120 on Tuesday after 23 new cases were reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>These 120 cases include 24 people who took part in a religious congregation at the Markaz in Nizamuddin West earlier this month. Till Monday night, the number of cases of the deadly Covid-19 (coronavirus disease) stood at 97, including two deaths.</p>
