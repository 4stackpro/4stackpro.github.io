<p>Given that it was co-created and written by one of the UK’s most respected film-makers, Gurinder Chadha, perhaps it is no surprise that Beecham House (airing on PBS Masterpiece on Sundays at 10/9c) has attracted some big-name actors from Britain, India – and beyond.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Set at the very end of the 18th century in Delhi before the British had consolidated power in that region, this six-part drama follows the story of John Beecham (Tom Bateman) and his family, friends and enemies.</p>
<p>Here are the characters you need to meet – and the actors who play them…</p>
<p>Tom Bateman plays John Beecham</p>
<p>Who is John Beecham? Described as “enigmatic” and “soulful”, John Beecham is a handsome former soldier who has quit the East India Company in disgust at its behaviour towards the Indians. Now, he has purchased a magnificent mansion and renamed it Beecham House – but the servants are surprised when he turns up with a baby boy and two Indian nursemaids in tow.</p>
<p>“Wealthy and distinguished, John has witnessed profiteering and exploitation during his time with the controlling East India Company and has resolved to conduct his business as a trader in a more equitable manner,” ITV says. “Determined to escape his previous life, John appears haunted by his past, but is inspired to become an honourable member of the region’s trading community.”</p>
<p>What else has Tom Bateman been in? The actor recently starred as Rawdon Crawley in ITV’s adaptation of Vanity Fair. He played Bouc in Murder on the Orient Express, and Justin Parker in Cold Feet, as well as Robert Jekyll in the TV series Jekyll &amp; Hyde and Guiliano Medici in Da Vinci’s Demons.</p>
<p>Lesley Nicol plays Henrietta Beecham</p>
<p>Who is Henrietta Beecham? John’s interfering mother, who has travelled from her home in England to stay with John in India. Despite not having seen her son for many years, Mrs Beecham feels perfectly entitled to boss him around – and attempt to play matchmaker.</p>
<p>What else has Lesley Nicol been in? Lesley Nicol will be forever remembered as the cook Mrs Patmore from Downton Abbey, a role she’s reprising in the upcoming Downton Abbey movie. Other credits include The Catch, Goldie and Bear, East Is East, and The Lion, the Witch &amp; the Wardrobe.</p>
<p>Leo Suter plays Daniel Beecham</p>
<p>Who is Daniel Beecham? John Beecham’s younger brother, who is a soldier for the East India Company. The two haven’t seen each other for ten years. Daniel is a bit of a womaniser and a party animal.</p>
<p>What else has Leo Suter been in? As Lord Edward Drummond, Leo Suter had an extremely dramatic role in series two of Victoria. He starred as Jack in the BBC Three series Clique, and also played Young Stringer in Sanditon.</p>
<p>Dakota Blue Richards plays Margaret Osbourne</p>

<p>What else has Grégory Fitoussi been in? The French actor stars as Noah in the TV series Riviera. His other credits include Le Bureau des Légendes, Speakerine, Spiral, Spin, and Mr Selfridge – in which he starred as Henri Leclair.</p>

<p>Who is Violet? A young family friend who has travelled with Mrs Henrietta Beecham to India. It quickly becomes clear that she was hoping John would agree to marry her.</p>
<p>What else has Bessie Carter been in? You may have spotted her in Howards End as Evie Wilcox, or in Cranford as Margaret Gidman. Really eagle-eyed viewers may even recognise her as a factory woman from 2012 movie Les Misérables.</p>
<p>Adil Ray plays Murad Beg</p>
<p>Who is Murad Beg? John’s neighbour, who dislikes French General Castillon intensely and agrees to help John secure a trading licence. English governess Margaret Osborne teaches his daughter Roshanara (Medha Shankar).</p>

<h3 id="the-great-sebastian-de-souza-on-how-leo-and-catherine-turned-the-male-gaze-on-its-head">&ldquo;The Great: Sebastian de Souza on How Leo and Catherine &lsquo;Turned the Male Gaze on Its Head&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/8ua4k7TJJ2FsjNiHvpur25GWskY/0x564:5831x3625/fit-in/1200x630/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2020/05/23/544/n/1922283/778c43685ec91158b46647.76680848_.jpg" alt="img"></p>
<p>Hulu&rsquo;s The Great is brimming with hilarity, fascinating characters, and powerful commentary. One of the potent storylines involves the budding relationship between Catherine (Elle Fanning) and her lover, Leo (Sebastian de Souza). What begins as an ambivalent dynamic, mostly on Catherine&rsquo;s end, turns into an undeniable connection that unifies them in love.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most admirable aspect of Catherine and Leo&rsquo;s romance is their requited reverence for each other. Sure, Peter (Nicholas Hoult) begins to develop real feelings for Catherine once he moderately embraces her strength and character. But, let&rsquo;s face it, he&rsquo;s no Leo. From the get-go, Leo respects Catherine as a person and is content with being her plaything. And when they grow closer, eventually teaming up for Catherine&rsquo;s coup, he has no problem taking orders from the HEIC (head empress in charge). He really is a ride or die — in more ways than one.</p>
<p>I had the honour of speaking to de Souza about his charming portrayal of lover boy Leo, as well as his on-set experience with Fanning and Hoult. Thankfully, he was completely aware of my high regard for Leo (having read my thirst post prior to our chat), so I didn&rsquo;t have to play it cool. Instead, we mutually raved about the easygoing character while delving into thought-provoking scenes, the challenging task of keeping a straight face during filming, and hopes for a second season.</p>
<p>POPSUGAR: First, congrats on the success of both Normal People and The Great. What&rsquo;s it been like seeing such positive reactions to these stories that you were a part of?</p>
<p>Sebastian de Souza: It&rsquo;s been extraordinary. I feel enormously grateful to have played a very little part in Normal People, which is seemingly and rightly a phenomenon. Given that we&rsquo;re all in lockdown and glued to our screens, it&rsquo;s been literally overnight. Thanks to Lenny [Abrahamson], Hettie [Macdonald], Daisy [Edgar-Jones], and Paul [Mescal] and all of their extraordinary genius, it&rsquo;s entered the lexicon of the classics. And people have been very sweet about The Great, so I&rsquo;m incredibly pleased about it all. It is always gratifying to see that people are enjoying stuff as much as we enjoyed making it.</p>
<p>PS: I&rsquo;d love to get into The Great. It&rsquo;s such a fun and powerful show, and Leo easily became one of my favourite characters. What was the most meaningful part about playing him?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s truly a human story about destiny and getting what you want and whether it&rsquo;s worth the sacrifice. That&rsquo;s something that we face on varying degrees every day as human beings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SD: Thank you! If I&rsquo;m honest, the most meaningful part was being furiously jealous of Leo&rsquo;s ability to glide through life like a boy on a rough sea. He&rsquo;s very happy bobbing along, recognising that he can&rsquo;t change the tide but that he can ride it, and, in that, he finds this great comfort. I&rsquo;m not that guy. The experience was a deep one for me because I was struck by the fact that you can live your life like this — the fundamentals of being good, loving as much as you can, living as much as you can, and leaving the rest to fate and destiny and the universe. He gets it. He&rsquo;s got it right. It was a great joy and a privilege to play that part.</p>
<p>On the other side of it, I think what&rsquo;s really lovely — and I was blown away and grateful for what you wrote on POPSUGAR — is how people have responded to the way we turned the male gaze on its head and made it a female one. It&rsquo;s marvelous, and it was glorious being able to explore that with Elle.</p>
<p>PS: A lot of the themes and topics that are discussed are actually quite modern. Do you think that&rsquo;s one reason why this story is resonating with people right now?</p>
<p>SD: Yeah, especially as you get to the pox and the plague-like thing that runs through Russia and the palace. It&rsquo;s dangerously topical right now. But, overall, it&rsquo;s a great example of how the story is well-written by Tony [McNamara] and hopefully well-represented. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if there are bears or people eating moose lips. It&rsquo;s truly a human story about destiny and getting what you want and whether it&rsquo;s worth the sacrifice. That&rsquo;s something that we face on varying degrees every day as human beings.</p>
<p>PS: Why do you think telling these historical stories with a comedic twist is so effective?</p>
<p>SD: Phoebe Waller-Bridge said this and put it brilliantly — I think that truth will always be very powerful, but if you can get people to laugh, you break down a barrier that you otherwise can&rsquo;t break down. You&rsquo;re able to get to their truth quicker and people, therefore, can connect more to the characters that they&rsquo;re seeing on screen and feel that their own experiences are reflected. If you&rsquo;re in sidesplitting hysterics — which Nick Hoult makes everyone be in most of the time — you let in by osmosis these very profound things underneath the off-the-cuff, comedic writing. It&rsquo;s a useful tool that Tony employs well.</p>
<p>PS: One of the things that I loved about this show is how each actor has such exceptional delivery, especially when they&rsquo;re saying these hilariously outlandish lines. How hard was it trying to keep a straight face during some of those scenes?</p>
<p>SD: It&rsquo;s fairly impossible. It&rsquo;s always hard not to laugh, but I suppose you have to do it. The thing that I will say about delivering the lines is there&rsquo;s such specificity to Tony&rsquo;s writing, and he&rsquo;s a stickler for that. When you come from a background of television and film, very often, people are quite relaxed about the &ldquo;and&rdquo; going here and the &ldquo;the&rdquo; being there. But Tony is very specific and clear about it, and it makes the delivery much easier. He&rsquo;s aware of the rhythm and the pitter-patter of his scenarios and scenes, so you&rsquo;re able to get into the character.</p>
<p>PS: Were there any scenes that you were especially fond of?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that truth will always be very powerful, but if you can get people to laugh, you break down a barrier that you otherwise can&rsquo;t break down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SD: This is a very boring answer, but I have to say all of them. There were gorgeous speeches, wonderfully romantic scenes, and incredibly sad moments that were really fascinating to get into. Leo really is — and may forever be — the most enjoyable person I&rsquo;ve ever had the pleasure of playing. The way he looks at the world is so refreshing. It&rsquo;s glorious to be that free. But, gosh, it was also infuriating to be inside of his head. He&rsquo;s just so easygoing — until he isn&rsquo;t, of course. That&rsquo;s what I hope makes him more three-dimensional.</p>
<p>PS: Well, because he&rsquo;s so easygoing, seeing him get flustered when things between him and Catherine unfold shows how much he cares about her.</p>
<p>SD: Yeah, whenever I talk about how much he loves Catherine, I think about the scene where she says, &ldquo;You never speak about politics, and you never talk about bureaucracy and poetry and enlightenment.&rdquo; She gets very frustrated with him, but he says, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the point of throwing oneself at a wall until the wall is still there but you&rsquo;re bone and mush and a skin bag?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s interesting because that&rsquo;s true. But towards the end of the show, when he&rsquo;s trying to save the thing that he cares about, i.e. his connection with Catherine, he is holding on to this discovery that life with someone else by your side is heavier with more responsibility, and it&rsquo;s often more difficult, but it&rsquo;s better and richer. The way that Tony has written that arc is very effective.</p>
<p>PS: What was it like working with Nicholas and Elle and seeing their dynamic come to life on screen?</p>
<p>SD: Nick and Elle have worked together before, which helped their dynamic. I wasn&rsquo;t a part of the pilot or the first episode, so I came in late, which is the worst situation to be in as an actor. We&rsquo;re all insecure and perpetually nervous about everything. It&rsquo;s like being in school. You&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;Oh, my God, I&rsquo;m the new kid in town. I don&rsquo;t have any friends yet!&rdquo; That was nerve-racking for me, but I was struck by how I was subsumed into their company. It was a very natural process, and everyone was professional and dedicated to telling the story.</p>
<p>PS: I was also enamoured with the costuming. I still dream about those layered pearls that Nicholas wears in one scene. Did you have a favourite costume or look from any of the characters?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope there is a season two. I would love to see more about the court. I&rsquo;m a real nerd, and I love universes like Marvel and Lord of the Rings, so because we&rsquo;ve set up the court as something like that, I&rsquo;d like to see that explored more, as well as the characters that inhabit it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SD: Emma Fryer, who designed the costumes, has done the most magnificent, superlative job, as has [Louise] Coles, who designed all of the makeup and hair. I didn&rsquo;t have a favourite look, but I thought that Catherine&rsquo;s dresses were all sumptuous and beautiful. I know nothing about costume designing, and I&rsquo;m the least fashionable person on Earth, but I imagine it would be easy to be derivative. This show was inevitably going to be compared to The Favourite and Marie Antoinette, but Emma and Lou found this extraordinary way of being committed to realism through a colour palette and off-beat looks that reflected what was on the page. I particularly enjoyed Leo&rsquo;s costumes because I got to wear them, of course, and I love being in all green. I used to say to Emma that it was like one of those couches from the &rsquo;70s.</p>
<p>PS: Green often symbolizes serenity, which aligns with Leo&rsquo;s character in a way.</p>
<p>SD: I didn&rsquo;t know that! You&rsquo;re full of knowledge. I wish we could talk longer. [Laughs] But that shows how the costumes were well thought-out. It was such a joy working with Emma. She would come in every morning and say, &ldquo;This is your costume today. How do you feel about it?&rdquo; And I&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;I feel fabulous, thank you. How do you feel about it? That&rsquo;s more important.&rdquo; And we&rsquo;d just go back and forth.</p>
<p>PS: Now, we both know how the season ends. Catherine has to decide between saving Russia and saving Leo&rsquo;s life, and she chooses the former. If we&rsquo;re lucky enough to get a season two, what would you like to see?</p>
<p>SD: Are you sure that Leo dies? No, I&rsquo;m kidding. I think that&rsquo;s the way it should end because this is Catherine&rsquo;s story, and it raises the stakes. I hope there is a season two. I would love to see more about the court. I&rsquo;m a real nerd, and I love universes like Marvel and Lord of the Rings, so because we&rsquo;ve set up the court as something like that, I&rsquo;d like to see that explored more, as well as the characters that inhabit it.</p>
<p>Of course, I would like to see Catherine take power, but I wouldn&rsquo;t want it to be too easy. There&rsquo;s something brilliant and glorious about a struggle because she&rsquo;s against such ineptitude, insanity, and idiocy. It further plots this story in the present. It&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Hang on a minute, what do you mean we can&rsquo;t all be equal? What do you mean women can&rsquo;t have the same jobs as men and be paid equally?&rdquo; The struggle, as they say, is real. And the more struggle there is, the more we&rsquo;re looking at ourselves in the mirror and saying, &ldquo;Hang on a f*cking second, this is ridiculous. Why is this the case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>PS: Finally, this is just a fun question that I always like to ask people because I love talking about music: what do you have on repeat right now?</p>
<p>SD: Oh, that&rsquo;s a great question. I have a very eclectic Spotify. It&rsquo;s everything from everywhere, but at the moment, I&rsquo;m actually listening to a new mixtape that was put out by the British artist Sid Stone. The single from it is called &ldquo;Better Alone,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s extraordinarily soulful and — dare I say — a quieter more introspective Rag&rsquo;n&rsquo;Bone Man. I&rsquo;ve been listening to that a great deal.</p>
<p>The Great is now streaming on Stan.

<h3 id="how-the-great-cast-compares-to-their-real-life-counterparts">&ldquo;How The Great Cast Compares to Their Real-Life Counterparts&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/the-great-1590169677.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&amp;resize=1200:*" alt="img">
The Great, Hulu&rsquo;s new dark comedy about a young Catherine the Great (and the second show in a year about the legendary Russian monarch) made its debut last weekend. In the hands of creator Tony McNamara, who wrote the Oscar-nominated screenplay for The Favourite, the show is an irreverent and satirical take on Catherine&rsquo;s disastrous marriage to Emperor Peter III and her plot to overthrow him and take the throne.</p>
<p>The Great is, in its own words, an &ldquo;occasionally true story&rdquo; that takes basic historical facts—that Catherine married Peter in 1745, that they famously didn&rsquo;t get along, that he was a highly ineffectual leader, and that she successfully launched a coup against him—and embellishes the details, taking chronological liberties for dramatic, and very comedic, effect.</p>
<p>Here is what we know about The Great&rsquo;s real-life and imagined characters, and the actors who portray them.</p>
<p>Elle Fanning as Catherine the Great</p>
<p>Getty/Hulu</p>
<p>Elle Fanning (Maleficent, The Beguiled, 20th Century Women) stars as the young Catherine, who, at the start of the show, arrives in Russia naively in search of great love and intellectual discourse, only to be disappointed by her rogue husband and the superficial ladies of the court. The real Catherine, née Princess Sophie Friederike Auguste of Prussia, was disappointed by Peter long before she was betrothed to him; they had met when Catherine was 10 years old and even then she found him repulsive.</p>
<p>The Great&rsquo;s version of Catherine, as in real life, is well-read and passionate about women&rsquo;s education and French philosophy. She seeks a higher purpose and considers herself the more fit ruler for Russia, which leads her on a path to eventually deposing her husband after securing the loyalties of key advisers and the military.</p>
<p>Nicholas Hoult as Emperor Peter III</p>
<p>Getty/Hulu</p>
<p>In The Great, Peter is already the emperor of Russia by the time his doe-eyed fiancée arrives. In real life, however, the couple were married for 17 unhappy years before Peter became tsar in 1762 upon the death of his aunt, Empress Elizabeth.</p>
<p>His brutish behavior on the show, as portrayed by Nicholas Hoult (Mad Max: Fury Road, The X-Men series, The Favourite), is an exaggerated version of facts: Catherine left behind extensive memoirs in which she described her husband as an idiot and a drunkard.</p>
<p>Peter is portrayed in the show as being the son of Peter the Great when in reality, he was his grandson. He only ascended the throne because his aunt Elizabeth (more on her below), who was childless and unmarried, chose him to be her heir. He spent a short six months as Tsar before Catherine&rsquo;s successful coup forced him to abdicate, and he died in prison—conspiracy theories abound as to his cause of death, with some who believed his wife had him assassinated and others who contend he lost a brawl with a bodyguard.</p>
<p>Phoebe Fox as Marial</p>
<p>Hulu/Getty</p>
<p>In the show, Marial, played by English actress Phoebe Fox, is Catherine&rsquo;s shrewd servant, though she wasn&rsquo;t always in that position. She used to be a lady of the court until her father did something to anger the emperor, who then sentenced them to servitude as punishment. Marial is the one who plants the seed in Catherine&rsquo;s mind to kill Peter for the Russian throne and the two conspire throughout the season, with Count Orlo (below), to accomplish this. In real life, there is no evidence that there was such a handmaid who set the wheels in motion for Catherine to overthrow Peter.</p>
<p>Belinda Bromilow as Aunt Elizabeth</p>
<p>Getty/Hulu</p>
<p>The Great has turned the Empress Elizabeth into an eccentric character. Played by Australian actress Belinda Bromilow (who happens to be creator Tony McNamara&rsquo;s wife), she spends her time in the palace playing with butterflies and indulging in other curious hobbies. Though to her credit, this Elizabeth does occasionally dole out good advice.</p>
<p>In real life, Peter&rsquo;s aunt was a formidable person. After seizing the throne in a bloodless coup from the infant tsar Ivan VI (and then imprisoning him for life, which is pretty accurately portrayed in the show), Elizabeth was empress for 21 years, during which she led the country through two wars (the War of Austrian Succession and the Seven Years&rsquo; War), oversaw the completion of the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg, and didn&rsquo;t execute a single person during her reign, making her one of Russia&rsquo;s most popular monarchs. Most importantly, she was the one who arranged the marriage between Catherine and Peter.</p>
<p>Adam Godley as Archbishop Archie</p>
<p>Hulu/Getty</p>
<p>Archie, played by Adam Godley (Breaking Bad, The Lehman Trilogy on London&rsquo;s West End), is the Rasputin-like spiritual adviser to Peter, who uses his alleged direct line with God to exert his influence and manipulate the court. He claims to have prophetic visions and one of them, about Catherine, was why she was chosen to become Peter&rsquo;s wife. While Archie isn&rsquo;t based on a real person, we can assume he&rsquo;s a fill-in—albeit a very absurd one—for the Russian Orthodox religious advisers whose support the monarchs would have needed in court.</p>
<p>Sacha Dhawan as Count Orlo</p>
<p>Getty/Hulu</p>
<p>British actor Sacha Dhawan (Doctor Who) is the skittish, highly strung Count Orlo, a veteran statesman whose preference for books and philosophy over the status quo (sex, vodka, violent debauchery) subjects him to frequent ridicule by his peers. He&rsquo;s a savvy operator nonetheless and joins Catherine and Marial in their secret rebellion.</p>
<p>It seems Count Orlo is a loose interpretation of the real-life Grigory Orlov. Unlike his TV adaptation, Orlov was a very capable military man who wasn&rsquo;t a supporting player in the conspiracy to depose Peter, but rather the leader of the effort. And, most importantly, he was deemed Catherine&rsquo;s favorite and the two became lovers—he&rsquo;s even rumored to have fathered one of her children.</p>
<p>Douglas Hodge as General Velementov</p>
<p>Hulu/Getty</p>
<p>General Velementov, played by Douglas Hodge (The Night Manager, Joker), is a decorated military leader in charge of the war against the Swedes (the actual Russo-Swedish War that presumably inspired the one taking place in the show ended two years before Catherine and Peter&rsquo;s 1745 wedding). He&rsquo;s also a bumbling drunk infatuated with Catherine, which she uses to her advantage to secure the military&rsquo;s support of her coup. While he isn&rsquo;t based on a real general, Velementov is a stand-in for the military, especially its members who backed Catherine.</p>
<p>Gwilym Lee as Grigor Dymov</p>
<p>Hulu/Getty</p>
<p>In perhaps one of the more twisted relationships of the show, Grigor Dymov (portrayed by Gwilym Lee, who you might recognize as guitarist Brian May in the Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody) is Peter&rsquo;s best friend and right hand man, who must also helplessly stand by as the emperor blatantly takes his wife as a mistress. There&rsquo;s no real-life counterpart to Grigor.</p>
<p>Charity Wakefield as Georgina Dymov</p>
<p>Hulu/Getty</p>
<p>Charity Wakefield plays Grigor&rsquo;s wife—and Peter&rsquo;s mistress—Georgina, who isn&rsquo;t a specific real-life person but likely a stand-in for Peter&rsquo;s many extramarital exploits.</p>
<p>Sebastian de Souza as Count Leo Voronsky</p>
<p>Hulu/Getty</p>
<p>Catherine was famous for taking on several lovers throughout her life. In fact, she had so many substantial extramarital affairs that all four of her children likely had different fathers. In The Great, Count Leo Voronsky, portrayed by Sebastian de Souza (Normal People, The Borgias), is presented to the empress as a gift from Peter as a gesture of goodwill, and the two fall in love.</p>

Comparisons for space situational awareness (part 2)&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.thespacereview.com/archive/3964a.jpg" alt="img">
The growth of both debris in Earth orbit from collisions and explosions as well as active satellites is raising awareness about the need for revised approaches to space traffic management. (credit: ESA)</p>
<p>How has traffic been managed in the sky, on waterways, and on the road? Comparisons for space situational awareness (part 2)</p>
<p>Other traditional “rules of the road”</p>
<p>Taking a step back from the complexities of STM and looking at how traffic historically has been managed in other domains may provide some useful insights. One issue that cuts across land, air, and sea is vehicle worthiness. That is, cars, planes, and boats all need to be registered to ensure their safety, and this may be analogous to the satellite licensing process. Cars go through safety inspections to ensure road worthiness and minimum pollution standards, as well as to ensure we have functioning headlights to see and be seen at night, avoiding collisions. Just as cars, planes, and boats should be visible unless bad weather precludes this, so too should satellites be trackable. The technology for each domain is different, but the goal for all these vehicles is to be identifiable to foster communication and coordination of intended maneuvers.</p>
<p>Similarly, across domains, more capable vehicles are expected to yield to less capable modes of transportation (e.g.: pedestrians have the right of way over cars) but everyone should still exercise due responsibility. Thus, just as a pedestrian should not jaywalk in the midst of vehicular traffic, a small, non-maneuverable cubesat probably should avoid densely populated orbits used by larger, more capable satellites.</p>
<p>A common theme throughout all these domains is that safety is about responsible use.</p>
<p>One distinction between management of air traffic, whether piloted or not, and STM is that some conjunctions in space occur at a set frequency (i.e., every 90 minutes in LEO). While unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) may hover over a particular spot on the ground and air traffic controllers sometimes direct airline pilots into holding patterns, neither type of aircraft routinely flies in a circular, predictable orbit. Maneuvers in the air and on the road occur rapidly, as pilots and drivers can often either collide with or avoid each other within seconds. Typically conjunctions on the seas happen more slowly. Traditionally (non-automated and non-propulsive) satellites have had relatively long lead times to avoid conjunction, but if large constellations of automated and propulsive spacecraft do become a reality, the reaction time likely will be cut dramatically.</p>
<p>Another way to think about this is to consider what causes people to adhere to set rules. An interesting criminology paper proposes two reasons drivers do not break traffic rules: perceived likelihood of being caught and, perhaps more fundamentally, treatment by police. In terms of the latter, if motorists are treated with dignity and respect by the police, they are seen as more likely to see themselves as part of a larger social group and thus feel more of a “moral compunction” to obey the law.[1] In the absence of a legitimate STM enforcement authority, it may especially behoove actors to collaborate for the governance and technological reasons identified above, as well as the fact that space is a global commons and thus all space actors are part of the same global spacefaring community.[2]</p>
<p>A common theme throughout all these domains is that safety is about responsible use. For more details, we proceed to examine how traffic management has worked for airplanes (both piloted and unpiloted), ships, and motor vehicles.</p>
<p>Air Traffic Management (ATM)</p>
<p>Virtually since its beginning, air traffic control has had to address the issue of nations lofting planes whose locations and routes they did not want to disclose, for military reasons. The landmark 1944 “Chicago Convention” for international aviation law, which created the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), specifically excluded “state aircraft” (military airplanes), and no such distinction exists for space objects.[3] The solution was the adoption of the “due regard” convention that has permitted nations not to disclose the whereabouts of military planes provided they didn’t endanger other aircraft. This “due regard” convention also “placed the full burden for the avoidance of collision on the state aircraft in exchange for the ability for those aircraft to operate outside the common rules, including the ability to be undetectable by other operators and service providers.”[4] A parallel argument to STM could certainly be made.</p>
<p>Modern air traffic control traces its origins back to a 1956 fatal mid-air collision between two planes operating over the Grand Canyon. The resulting 1958 Federal Aviation Act transformed the existing Civil Aeronautics Authority into the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This legislation created an independent, unified agency to promote and develop air safety for both civilian and military aircraft.[5]</p>
<p>Approximately 44,000 airplanes operate in US skies every day and, during busy periods, about 5,000 planes are in the air simultaneously.[6] Once a commercial flight takes off, the pilot activates a transponder, which broadcasts a signal indicating the plane’s “flight number, altitude, speed, and destination.”[7] US airspace is divided into 21 zones and then sectors. Also within each zone are Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) airspaces that handle flights into and out of numerous airports. A useful analogy to planes being “passed off” to different flight controllers is a “zone” defense utilized by a football or basketball team.[8]</p>
<p>In space, a traffic management system needs to handle both active (highly autonomous and less so) and inactive satellites (debris) and thus an integrated, rather than parallel, ecosystem seems to be a more apt metaphor.</p>
<p>As of January 1, 2020, the FAA also has required that aircraft operating in most controlled US airspace be equipped with Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) technology. ADS-B works by periodically, automatically, and actively broadcasting an airplane’s position information to ground-based air traffic controllers, satellites overhead, and other aircraft. More than just a very useful tool for controllers, it also provides aircraft-to-aircraft communications in time-critical situations. ADS-B In is an optional tool for pilots to increase their situational awareness by obtaining information about nearby aircraft that also have this equipment aboard. ADS-B is a key technology in the FAA’s Next Generation Air Transportation System (“NextGen”), which shifts more of air traffic control from ground-based radars to satellites.[9] In addition to being useful for air traffic control, ADS-B technology can be invaluable for search and rescue operations and is analogous to the Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs) that many backwoods hikers use.[10]</p>
<p>Pilots of small planes (“general aviation”) often operate under visual flight rules (VFR) (“see and avoid”) and are encouraged, but not required, to file flight plans with the FAA. Larger commercial flights are equipped to fly in more inclement weather and thus operate under instrument flight rules (IFR) and are separated by the FAA’s formal air traffic control system. Largely due to federal deregulation of the airline industry in the 1970s, air travel has significantly increased in the last 50 years. Since the construction of new airports and runways hasn’t kept pace with the number of flights, the FAA and NASA have utilized new technologies, such as GPS, to automate the system with limited infrastructure.[11]</p>
<p>Unmanned Aircraft Systems Traffic Management (UTM)</p>
<p>In recent years UAS have proliferated exponentially: in 2019, various experts estimated that there would be 700,000 UAS in US airspace in 2020 and three to six million by 2021 with millions flying daily.[12] UAS are also called unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), remotely piloted aircraft systems, and, most simply, drones. Traffic management of UAS presents a cogent analogy to SSA of remotely controlled Earth-orbiting satellites.[13] Just as with spacecraft, there are diverse groups (i.e.: large, small, commercial, nonprofit, federal, and international organizations) of pilots who operate UAS. Because of the very rapid growth in UAS among governments, companies, and hobbyists, the FAA and NASA have been working intensively to devise a suitable UTM system. In 2017, a (likely unintentionally ironically named) UTM Pilot Program began at three sites.[14]</p>
<p>Additionally, NASA researcher Parimal Kopardekar received a UTM patent that includes a concept called National UAS Standardized Testing and Rating to assess the maneuverability of a particular vehicle and thus which one should move given a potential conflict. The issue of maneuverability is very applicable to STM.[15]</p>
<p>As with some new constellations of satellites, the FAA-NASA UTM system is designed to be largely automated and “cloud-based” in which Machine to Machine (M2M) or Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communication will be key so that UAS can autonomously detect and avoid other UAS. There will also be the periodic need for “dynamic restrictions” when, for example, law enforcement or medical flights would take priority over hobbyists’ flights. Additionally, a NASA site notes that “Each user will have the same situational awareness of airspace.”[16]</p>
<p>Parimal Kopardeker and Eric Mueller, “The Science of Drones” presentation (undated), available here , p. 12.</p>
<p>UTM is often depicted as a separate, parallel “ecosystem” to air traffic management. Because of this, some experts have suggested that future UAS be “dually capable” to operate in both UTM and ATM environments, leading to a longer-term goal of an integrated National Airspace System.[17] In space, a traffic management system needs to handle both active (highly autonomous and less so) and inactive satellites (debris) and thus an integrated, rather than parallel, ecosystem seems to be a more apt metaphor.</p>
<p>One Department of Homeland Security (DHS) site also mentions that “Anyone flying in the UTM system will need an interface to a UAS Service Supplier (USS) to submit flight intent to other users and receive authorizations for specific access.”[18] The FAA can penalize operators who fly UAS too close to airports, but it doesn’t have criminal enforcement authority and other federal departments, such as the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security, can interfere with illegal drones in limited circumstances.[19] In addition, local and state law enforcement have the authority to ensure public safety and security by policing UAS appropriately at these levels. For example, if a UAS is flying over a crowd or violating local voyeurism laws, local police have full authority to deal directly with this use of technology to break laws and report it to the FAA later.[20]</p>
<p>In December 2019, the FAA proposed new regulations to permit the tracking of virtually all drones. The regulations would require all UAS weighing more than about half a pound to carry remote ID technology that broadcasts over the Internet, enabling federal authorities to identify the UAS’ owner/operator. UAS operators of this size have been required since 2015 to register with the FAA, but not to include remote ID technology.[21]</p>
<p>Analogous to remote ID technology on UAS or ADS-B, a recent development in SSA is the concept of an electronic “license plate” for space objects. A Los Alamos National Lab team has created a device less than a square inch in size containing a laser that blinks a unique identifying code multiple times each second. Such extremely low-resource optical identifiers (ELROI) require no external power source so could be attached to rocket bodies and would work even if a satellite was no longer operational.[22] This could be a more convenient alternative to registering satellites internationally to help identify space objects.[23]</p>
<p>Could satellite operators employ a technology similar to AIS, at least for active satellites, that would help avoid collisions in space?</p>
<p>A similar concept of a GPS transponder was proposed a couple of years ago.[24] The ELROI or GPS transponder concept is also somewhat analogous to an airplane’s transponders, which a pilot can turn off, or perhaps more precisely to the underwater locator beacon in a plane’s “black box.” Another limitation of technologies such as ELROIs or GPS transponders is that they only potentially work where you put them—that is, an owner/operator can’t put such a tracking device on every potential piece of space debris.</p>
<p>As with a UTM system, an “STM system must accommodate safe operations in the presence of non-participants.” Space is, of course, inherently international with a very significant national security component. Military and intelligence personnel, as well as international or domestic rogue actors, likely do not want to disclose fully their spacecraft’s positions, maneuvers, and capabilities. “While conjunctions between participating and non-participating spacecraft cannot be addressed using the STM system, standards could be developed to encourage information sharing…To be politically palatable, an STM system cannot compel O/Os [owner/operators] to cede operational control of their spacecraft to space traffic management service suppliers (S3s) or a government entity.”[25]</p>
<p>Waterways</p>
<p>Figurative “rules of the road” actually predate roads and have evolved over centuries for boats and ships traveling on water. This long history of maritime navigation, particularly on the international high seas, likely makes it another good potential analogue for STM. Certain basic rules always apply, such as an international rule that “every vessel shall at all times maintain a proper look-out by sight and hearing as well as by all available means” to avoid collisions.[26] The 1982 Law of the Seas treaty calls for, among other things, ships to be seaworthy, be registered, have trained crews, use signals to avoid collisions, and to reduce and control marine pollution as much as possible—the parallels to STM are notable.[27] A general hierarchy applies to the right of way: an overtaken vessel has top priority down to power driven vessels having the lowest priority. Similarly, motor boats should yield to rowing shells. In other words, as in other domains, more capable vehicles yield to less capable vehicles.[28]</p>
<p>An interesting connection between UTM and maritime navigation is self-identification. Historically, ships have flown flags of their countries of registration and, more recently, the electronic Automatic Identification System (AIS) for ships has become widely used. AIS uses VHF transponders onboard the ship so they are self-identifying and communicating. AIS not only identifies a ship, it also delivers navigation information to nearby users. The information enables the operators to communicate and coordinate their navigation intentions directly with one another.[29] The benefit of direct operational communications is to enable efficiency and accuracy during time critical events. Of course, the point of this communication is to avoid maritime collisions, which would damage the marine environment and potentially cause human injuries or even deaths.</p>
<p>Could satellite operators employ a technology similar to AIS, at least for active satellites, that would help avoid collisions in space? To some extent, existing services such as SDA already provide a similar situational awareness capability. These collision avoidance services facilitate operator-to-operator communication based primarily on ground sensors, with some operator data. In other words, the satellites do not communicate directly with one another. Furthermore, the service relies on knowing the identity of the operators associated with the active satellites. Is it possible to have a future where the satellites can communicate and de-conflict conjunctions onboard with one another? For now, the addition of self-identifying technology is worth consideration. The implementation of an AIS-like system in space will rely on easily implementable, cost-effective, self-identifying detection and communication technology for users. The IMO Convention of the Safety of Life at Sea requires AIS on transport ships and passenger ships. Similarly, AIS could be initially implemented on a select category of satellites.</p>
<p>Perhaps satellite owner-operators also can learn from legal frameworks regarding shipwrecks. The Nairobi International Convention on the Removal of Wrecks, which went into force in 2015, addresses three basic questions: who is responsible for a wreck, what measures can be taken based on that responsibility, and how can the responsibility be enforced? In short, the convention mandates that ship owners are financially liable for wrecks, whether they pose a navigational or environmental hazard, and requires them to have insurance to cover the costs of wreck removal. Generally speaking, if a shipowner does not adequately or promptly mark or remove a wreck, the relevant coastal nation can do so at the registered owner’s expense. While the US is not a signatory to this convention, the 1987 Abandoned Shipwreck Act provides authority for the relevant coastal state to handle wrecks. Canada is a signatory to the Nairobi convention and, additionally, under Canadian law, if the owner is unable financially to pay for removal of a shipwreck, there is a “fund of last resort” for marine oil spills that potentially could be used.[30]</p>
<p>The “one size does not fit all” analogy to STM is apt: just as motor vehicles and boats are diverse, so too are satellites. Thus uniform assessments and analyses are not always appropriate.</p>
<p>In this context, shipwrecks are analogous to orbital debris, with which operators obviously want to avoid colliding, and thus perhaps new kinds of financial incentives to remediate orbital debris are needed. One legal scholar notes that not only do maritime salvage principles apply to space debris in the limited sense that actively removing debris would protect the owner of the debris from third-party liability, but that the 1989 Salvage Convention explicitly permits salvors to remove wrecks to prevent or minimize environmental damage, a direct parallel to the global commons of space.[31]</p>
<p>International maritime collision avoidance regulations (COLREGs) were last updated in 1972 and took effect in 1977 after problems with traffic separation in the English Channel. From 1956 to 1960, there were 60 collisions in the Channel. In 1967, a new traffic separation scheme became voluntary and in 1971 the International Maritime Organization passed a resolution making it mandatory. After the new regulations took effect, the number of Channel collisions dropped significantly.[32]</p>
<p>An important consideration for how travel is governed on waterways is that US Coast Guard navigation “rules do not grant privileges or rights, they impose responsibilities and require precaution under all conditions and circumstances.”[33] Thus prudence, common sense, and prioritizing safety should prevail so that all boats and ships may share waterways, a common resource.</p>
<p>Roadways</p>
<p>As with travel on water, drivers on land are expected to abide by certain international customs such as driving more cautiously when other vehicles are present, in poor weather, and at night. Also, drivers of motor vehicles should be careful around and yield the right of way to less capable vehicles such as bicycles. Rules such as which driver may proceed first when two or more simultaneously approach a four-way intersection may be clear in theory (the driver to the right may proceed first) but are not necessarily adhered to in practice. When entering traffic on a highway, drivers are expected to yield to the ongoing traffic and merge when there is sufficient time (given their vehicle’s ability to accelerate) and indicate their intentions to maneuver (with a turn signal). A parallel could easily be made to planned satellite maneuvers, particularly when transitioning through different altitudes or joining a constellation.</p>
<p>Moriba Jah also points out that we regulate vehicles on various criteria such as size, maneuverability, weight, hazard potential, and so forth. “Trucks carrying hazardous fuel are regulated differently than Vespa scooters, Oil Tankers on our seas are regulated differently than kayaks and canoes. So, why would we treat all Resident Space Objects as the same thing…cannonballs?” The “one size does not fit all” analogy to STM is apt: just as motor vehicles and boats are diverse, so too are satellites. Thus uniform assessments and analyses are not always appropriate.[34]</p>
<p>Another aspect of roadway travel that is relevant to other domains like space is the use of automating technologies. For example, newer cars tend to have more safety features such as blind spot avoidance when shifting lanes, anti-tailgating automatic braking technology, and backup cameras that turn on when a driver shifts into reverse. Typically higher levels of automation are tested first in restricted areas before being allowed to integrate with existing, lower levels of technology. Similarly, the advent of self-driving vehicles presents both challenges and opportunities. Some municipalities are experimenting with self-driving vehicles for multiple passengers as a potential new form of public transportation.[35] Could the approach we are taking to integrating new technology into our daily lives be applicable in space, as with the SpaceBees situation of employing new tracking technology on difficult-to-track satellites or the proposed increased autonomy of satellites?</p>
<p>One caveat about the roads analogy is that they are geographically constrained areas typically under national jurisdiction (as well as sometimes state and local jurisdiction), rather than an inherently international environment such as space or the high seas.[36] Nevertheless, it still may provide some useful touchstones.</p>
<p>Comparison of key issues in various types of traffic management.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>So what can we apply from this discussion of analogous “rules of the road” to the changing nature of space operations and thus SSA, as well as STM regulatory oversight and policy coordination? A strong argument can be made that the federal government’s role should be to focus on setting STM guidelines and developing standards, rather getting too involved in operational details for the disparate community of space operators. The latter would be impractical, if not impossible, given the many foreign nations, consortia, and commercial companies now operating in space. As one analyst notes, negotiating international “standards of behavior for the purpose of collision avoidance” is an inherently governmental function.[37] Just as NASA and then the federal government have promulgated standard practices for orbital debris mitigation, so too could the government “promote efficient and effective space safety practices”[38] that encourage responsible activity in space. NASA and other federal organizations can also enable the development of tools to manage “big data” for large constellations of satellites, essential to do conjunction assessments with many satellites. NASA and other federal organizations can and do also promote data quality and technical standards in a variety of areas, including STM.[39] Crafting national policy will need to be done carefully, with due consideration of various domestic viewpoints including the distinction between rules and standards or guidelines, as demonstrated by the recent controversy over the FCC’s updating of some of its rules regarding orbital debris.[40]</p>
<p>An important consideration for UTM, ATM, and STM is whether a “top-down” or “bottom-up” system is more feasible for each of these domains.</p>
<p>In previous years, some people have argued for a centralized, international body to handle STM akin to the ICAO, which sets international standards for ATM that individual nations’ governments implement; however, changes in the commercial space sector and other factors no longer make this approach realistic.[41] As a former air traffic controller who now studies SSA noted, safety on the high seas (a domain, like space, that no nation-state owns) relies on “sea faring nations of the world to enforce the agreed upon standards.” She also contends that while space technology is more similar to that of aviation, “international maritime agreements may provide the more instructive model” for STM.[42]</p>
<p>An important consideration for UTM, ATM, and STM is whether a “top-down” or “bottom-up” system is more feasible for each of these domains. A top-down system entails a centralized body with enforcement authority, while a bottom-up system relies on decisions made by lower-level participants. For piloted aircraft, there is a civil national air traffic control system run by the FAA and an international one run by the ICAO that works reasonably well with centralized oversight and decentralized execution. The Pilot in Command rule still applies: he or she has ultimate responsibility for the actions of his or her aircraft.[43] This rule also applies to ships and to satellites. The SDA is representative of a bottoms-up approach, as commercial satellite owner-operators needed a collision avoidance service, so they banded together and created one in the absence of a regulatory regime. As one author noted eight years ago, but after SDA’s creation, “commercial space entities themselves have incredibly large incentives for safe operations…and thus industry has even create[d] self-regulation to fill in gaps in government regulation in certain instances.”[44]</p>
<p>At another level, rules certainly should be, but are not always, followed. Police officers can ticket and hold accountable speeding drivers, for example, but law enforcement and regulatory authorities cannot identify all infractions in all domains. Society typically accepts that these infractions occur at a sufficiently infrequent rate that more stringent accountability mechanisms are not necessary. The awareness of a potential ticket and the desire for safe passage are often, but not always, adequate to encourage proper behavior. When that minimum level of negative or positive incentivization is no longer adequate, then stricter accountability mechanisms (e.g.: radar guns) are imposed. Similarly, SSA operators will commit infractions and not all infractions will be caught but most are incentivized towards responsible behavior. Of course, the safest way to prevent a collision is never to fly in space, just as the safest way to avoid a car accident is never to get in a car.</p>
<p>In years past, DoD was the reluctant leader in SSA because the SSN/CSpOC had the only viable capabilities, yet providing SSA information to all sorts of space operators was not considered (and is not) an inherently military mission. More recently, however, with the ready availability of advanced analytics, the growth of commercial space, and other factors, individual companies’ and consortia’s SSA capabilities have begun to outstrip the military’s. The advent of commercial capabilities offers the opportunity for a traditionally, inherently governmental function now to be accomplished by non-governmental entities.</p>
<p>Thus, DoD has begun to ride the train driven by the commercial sector, to use another transportation metaphor. As a commercial provider notes, “SSA is not the core function of the CSpOC, and 90 percent of the SSA warnings issued apply to commercial or international satellites rather than military”[45] and so the military and civilian segments of the federal government presumably have welcomed the commercial sector’s increased role. Taking this notion even further, General John Raymond, head of the new US Space Force, recently testified that “We are absolutely reliant on commercial space capabilities today, and I think we’re going to be more reliant on it in the future…They have operational capabilities that are relevant, and we are eager to develop an architecture that capitalizes on that.”[46]</p>
<p>Just as driver’s education in the classroom and behind the wheel is incentivized through decreased insurance premiums, might educational incentives for safe and responsible space operators be a good idea?</p>
<p>One area that the federal government can do, does in other sectors, and probably should do here is conduct more basic research on specific SSA technologies, as well as systems of tools. As one expert argues, “While the commercial sector is already innovating to a certain degree, there is still a strong need for research into future technologies to improve SSA and tackle emerging challenges such as large constellations, tracking and identification of CubeSats, and increasing the accuracy of conjunction assessments.” In effect, NASA and perhaps other federal organizations could “seed” the development of SSA technologies that the commercial sector would then develop, adapt, and adopt.[47] Another research topic that the federal government could pursue is system-level STM simulation, just as NASA and the FAA have conducted air traffic control research and simulations for many years. This could be especially important given constellations of autonomously maneuverable satellites.[48]</p>
<p>Overall, more voluntary coordination is needed, both for SSA operations and for STM policy in the rapidly changing space environment, but many questions remain. Just as pilots file flight plans about their intended paths, a spacecraft’s insertion and intended orbit is outlined during the licensing process, but there is no comprehensive mechanism for communicating future orbital maneuvers to all relevant space operators. Just as driver’s education in the classroom and behind the wheel is incentivized through decreased insurance premiums, might educational incentives for safe and responsible space operators be a good idea? If so, how do we oversee and hold accountable the users and nations within the global commons of space? Perhaps a voluntary code of conduct or set of best practices for space owners/operators would be useful, but would this suffice? Carefully looking at precedents of how traffic has been managed in other domains should provide policymakers and other space stakeholders with guidance on the best mixes of regulatory coercion and norms-based cooperation, carrots and sticks, in the increasingly complex STM environment. Ultimately, rather than dictating a complex and burdensome regime, a successful STM system will enable and encourage responsible behavior and use of the space domain.</p>

Organizers of the June 27 virtual event Global Pride said that former U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden, U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Ireland Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and artists Laverne Cox, Adam Lambert, Kesha and Todrick Hall will appear, OutInJersey.net noted. Global Pride leaders have said they will amplify Black voices, acknowledging the international response to the death of George Floyd and the unprecedented demand for racial justice by working with founders of the Black Lives Matter movement. Global Pride is a 24-hour stream of music, performances, speeches and messages of support that Hall will host on his YouTube channel.</p>
<p>Maha al-Mutairi, a trans woman in Kuwait, posted a video explaining how police have raped and assaulted her as she turned herself into a police station, Gay Star News reported. The authorities had summoned al-Mutairi, 39, to attend the police station on the charge of &ldquo;imitating a woman&quot;the fourth time she has faced this charge in a year. But this time she fought back. On her way to the police station she filmed a video, explaining how police had raped her and beat her senseless when in a male prison for seven months in 2019 for &ldquo;imitating the opposite sex.&rdquo; Trans women have reported police stripping them and parading them around police stations, having to dance for officers, sexual humiliation, physical abuse and torture.</p>
<p>Poland President Andrzej Duda pledged to ban LGBT+ education in schools, as well as blocking the legalization of same-sex marriage and adoption, PinkNews reported. Duda ramped up his homophobic rhetoric to jump-start his re-election campaign, which had been interrupted by coronavirus.</p>
<p>Speaking of Poland, the country has featured its first-ever gay couple on television, in a steamy advertisement for Durex condoms, StarObserver.com reported. Despite having a culture of rampant homophobia leading to one-third of Poland declaring itself an &ldquo;LGBT-Free zone&rdquo; in February, the nationally aired condom ad features famous YouTube couple Jakub Kwiecinsk and Dawid Mycek.</p>
<p>Mexican singer and DJ Raymix rocked the Latin music world June 5 when he came out as gay, LGBTQ Nation noted. This news was coming from a guy who broke through with the hit single &ldquo;Oye Mujer,&rdquo; Raymix&rsquo;s ode to a captivating woman in the club. &ldquo;Can you believe that in 2020 there are people in the industry who told me not do this video?&rdquo; says Raymix at the start of his YouTube video titled &ldquo;I Officially Declare Myself Gay&rdquo; in Spanish. &ldquo;That I should stay quiet and pretend to be a person that I&rsquo;m not because I wouldn&rsquo;t be successful. They told me the world is not ready for an artist who sings cumbia, or regional Mexican music [to come out].&rdquo; Raymix came out after his latest single&quot;Tu y Yo,&rdquo; with Mexican pop icon Paulina Rubiohit number one on Mexico&rsquo;s Pop Airplay chart.</p>
<p>Switzerland&rsquo;s National Council approved same-sex marriage by an overwhelming majority, Gay Star News noted. The National Council is the lower house of the Swiss parliament, the National Assembly; now, the issue will now have to go before the upper house, the Council of States, and it may face a referendum. The bill guarantees full equality, including access to sperm donation and parenthood recognition.</p>
<p>In Britain, more than 100,000 people have signed an online petition calling for &ldquo;conversion therapy&quot;aimed at changing a person&rsquo;s sexualityto be made illegal, the BBC reported. It will now be considered for a debate in Parliament, having gained the required support, two years after the government pledged to ban the practice. Also, the charity Stonewall has urged the government to &ldquo;urgently&rdquo; publish its plans to &ldquo;end these harmful practices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The British governmentafter spending a gruelling two years stalling the results of a public forum to decide the future of trans rightshas opted to not listen to the public and allegedly ignore and ditch considerations for a self-identifying ( self-ID ) system altogether, PinkNews reported. The crucial legislative reforms which would have made it easier for people to change their gender will reportedly be abandoned and replaced with a series of pad-locked policies to better &ldquo;protect&rdquo; single-sex spaces.</p>
<p>Authorities in far eastern Russia charged an LGBT-rights activist with distributing pornography for posting drawings of vaginas on social media, The Moscow Times reported. Yulia Tsvetkova, 27, had been under house arrest from November to March in the remote city of Komsomolsk-on-Amur before authorities lifted her house arrest. Tsvetkova faces up to six years in jail for posting the images on her page dedicated to body positivity that she said is a hobby.</p>
<p>A Reuters article spotlighted gay men who are tricked into sharing personal images of themselves. In Egypt, Morocco and Nigeria, gay men are often blackmailed and outed by fake dates who dupe them into sharing intimate photos that they post online. The police also use social media to lure them to false meetings and make arrests. Ghana is one of more than 30 African countries that outlaw same-sex relations, according to the LGBT+-rights group ILGA.</p>
<p>The top official at the U.S. foreign-aid agency defended three political appointeesMerritt Corrigan, Bethany Kozma and Mark Kevin Lloydwhose past social-media posts and writings include attacks on LGBT people and Muslims, saying they were &ldquo;committed to enacting the policies of President Donald J. Trump,&rdquo; ProPublica reported. Acting administrator John Barsa condemned what he called &ldquo;unwarranted and malicious attacks&rdquo; on the three officials, while also making clear they had been chosen by the White House.</p>
<p>British actor Daniel Radcliffewho played Harry Potter in the films based off J.K. Rowling&rsquo;s hit book seriesresponded to the English author&rsquo;s anti-trans tweetstorm, LGBTQ Nation reported. Rowling recently announced that she supports female activists who harass and demean transgender women online. In a statement posted to the Trevor Project website, Radcliffe said, in part, &ldquo;Transgender women are women. Any statement to the contrary erases the identity and dignity of transgender people and goes against all advice given by professional health care associations who have far more expertise on this subject matter than either Jo or I.&rdquo; Co-star Emma Watson also came out for trans rights in the wake of Rowling&rsquo;s posts.</p>
<p>Technology and design tertiary institution RMIT University, law firm Dentons and community-support agency Advance Diversity Services are among this year&rsquo;s top employers and service providers for LGBTQ inclusion in Australia, Gay Nation reported. Other top honors went to Commonwealth Bank, PwC Australia and University of Western Australia, which all received the highest tiered ranking for LGBTQ inclusion while engineering group John Holland was named most improved. The 2020 Australian LGBTQ Inclusion Awardswhich announced the honorsare usually held in May; however, this year&rsquo;s event is being held Oct. 19 at the Hyatt Regency in Sydney.</p>
<p>Universal&rsquo;s Jurassic World: Dominion is set to be the first major studio movie to re-start filming proper in the United Kingdom, Deadline noted. Cameras are due to roll the second week of July ( July 6 ) at Pinewood Studios, Universal has confirmed. In recent days, production staff have been implementing rigorous safety protocols on-site and a two week pre-production period will begin next week.

Drawn from a dark period of Australia’s cold war-era history, ABC TV’s new series never quite finds the balance between light and shade</p>
<p>Ewen Leslie struts with a pep in his step in Operation Buffalo, a six-part comedy/drama in which he stars as Major Leo Carmichael, a military man responsible for the day-to-day operations of an outback base in Maralinga, South Australia.</p>
<p>The series is set in the mid-1950s and the base is being used by the British to test atomic bombs. The story was inspired by real-life events, although the writer and director, Peter Duncan (who co-created the series with Tanya Phegan) is not exactly a stickler for historical accuracy.</p>
<p>Introductory text displayed on screen playfully declares: “This is a work of historical fiction … But a lot of the really bad history actually happened.”</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are telling my story word for word&rsquo;: fertility &lsquo;micro-series&rsquo; finds new depth on TikTok Read more</p>
<p>Carmichael is supposed to oversee the design and building of the towers the bombs will be dropped from but his role expands to managing daily operations given that the ageing, absentminded General “Cranky” Crankford (James Cromwell) isn’t what he used to be upstairs. The protagonist’s life is thrown into disarray when he discovers that some important people – including the British high commissioner (William Zappa), the attorney general (Tony Martin) and the defence minister (Alan Dukes) – will be visiting ahead of schedule, giving him hours rather than days to prepare.</p>
<p>Remember those old Spray n’ Wipe commercials with the frantic cleaning of a house before surprise guests arriving? The setup is sort of like that, but instead of scrubbing away grease and baked-on pasta Carmichael has to make sure the facility not just looks nice but is ready to detonate a bomb with the same explosive force as the one that devastated Hiroshima a decade before.</p>
<p>Carmichael is part talent-wrangler, part deal-broker, part mover and shaker, part “help me out there” and part “my way or the highway” – a man who gives a good impression of both keeping his head above water and drowning in oxygen.</p>
<p>“If there’s good food and decent plonk and they get pissed enough, they go back to Canberra raving about us,” he says to the facility’s chef, sounding like a bizarro Basil Fawlty thrust into a historical-ish narrative.</p>
<p>But the series enters dark territory quickly. One of the sex workers routinely flown into the camp has gone missing and is soon shown lying bound and gagged in the desert, wailing in pain. This kind of balancing of comedy and hard-hitting drama is dangerous territory for even the most experienced film-makers, requiring swift changes in mood and the juggling of competing impulses. The actors also need to be directed in different ways: some emphasising whimsy, others tragedy and others both.</p>
<p>Tonally, Operation Buffalo never quite gets the balance right (at least not by the end of the third episode, which is the extent of this review). The drama continually pushes the series away from sly comedy, where it is strongest.</p>
<p>Following the characters as they travel to Adelaide and explore areas surrounding the base, Duncan more or less abandons the Maralinga facility as his central setting. That’s a shame, because it is largely what gave the series a sense of uniqueness: both spatially (it’s visually striking) and conceptually (as an odd place from which to observe politics and power).</p>
<p>The tonal imbalance also makes it difficult to know what to take away from the show, and given the weight of a history like that of Maralinga, it isn’t out of the question to expect clarity on that.</p>

<p>Duncan’s remit is to capture a narrative just to the side of history, with moments of political decision-making and instances of wide-reaching importance generally transpiring some place off-screen. The idea seems to be to not take the obvious route, and to keep audiences guessing – not just about what happens next but from which perspective the narrative will unfold.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting way to frame a story, with niggling, tantalising inferences that the most significant tale, broadly speaking, is transpiring someplace elsewhere, outside our field of view.</p>
<p>In Australian film and television, the director Rob Sitch’s 2000 feature film The Dish is probably the best known example of this tangential view of history, exploring Australia’s role in producing signals necessary to broadcast the Apollo 11 moon landing.</p>
<p>In the specific context of subjects explored in Operation Buffalo, a more interesting work is the director Lynette Wallworth’s 2016 Emmy award-winning VR experience Collisions, which recounts the real-life story of Nyarri Nyarri Morgan, an elder of Western Australia’s Martu people, whose first encounter of western culture occurred when he witnessed one of those atomic bomb tests.</p>
<p>Operation Buffalo is well shot by the cinematographer Martin McGrath, with a steady hand and a crisp, clean lens evoking the mood of a historical photograph without overdoing it. Costume design (from the veteran Wendy Cork) and production design (from Colin Gibson, who won an Oscar for Fury Road) are what you hope and expect from an ABC period piece: lovingly detailed, albeit with a limited kind of lavishness; a sense that someone was keeping an eye on the budget.</p>

<p>The cast are uniformly strong, with some reliable old charmers including Cromwell and Martin. The commanding Jessica De Gouw (who starred in The Secrets She Keeps) helps break up the boys’ club, playing Eva Lloyd-George, who arrives at Maralinga to conduct a research project. There’s also Adrienne Pickering as nurse Corrine who works at the hospital at Maralinga, and some Indigenous characters including Ruby (Frances Djulibing), whose family lives in the area surrounding the base.</p>
<p>The women and Indigenous characters, however, mostly feel tacked on to the masthead narrative, as if the decision to include them occurred late in the process. One of the joys about Collisions was that Wallworth got the framing right: not only revisiting the past to tell a narrative just to the side of history, but exploring another kind of history more than deserving of its own scrutiny.</p>
<p>Operation Buffalo is much more fickle: sometimes funny as a comedy, sometimes effective as a drama, but rarely satisfying as a combination of both.
