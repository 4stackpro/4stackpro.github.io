<p>Sony PlayStation just presented the first-look at their new PlayStation 5 console alongside the upcoming title reveals and gameplay for the same. The event, PS5: The Future of Gaming was held in association with Geoff Keighley’s E3 alternative, Summer Game Fest. Before we get into the details, we need to give props to the production value for this event. It was fascinating to see what people could do from the comfort of home to produce such an amazing event during tough times as such. Beautiful animations, sleek transitions between trailers and loud-thumping music. Unlike other digital events, this event was a pre-recorded high quality one, playing at 1080p resolution at 30fps.</p>
<p>The event kicked off with an introduction video showcasing a highlight reel of the past 25 years of PlayStation. After which, Jim Ryan, President and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment welcomed everyone to the event. He spoke about Sony’s newly forged partnership with Rockstar Games. Rockstar’s 2013 title, Grand Theft Auto V will be coming out on the PlayStation 5 as well and owners of the new console will be getting GTA Online for free at launch in 2021. PlayStation 4 owners, on the other hand, will be getting $1 million in GTA cash every month until the new console launches.</p>
<p>As for the event, Jim stated, “The content we have curated for today’s event showcases how PS5 has inspired developers to create new experiences that are transformative in how they look, sound and feel.” With further ado, let us now take a look at the games that were revealed at PS5: The Future of Gaming.</p>
<p>Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales</p>
<p>The first announcement for this long-awaited event came from Insomniac Games. After a bunch of rumours and speculations floating around for an upcoming Spider-Man 2 game, the company finally announced one - Spider-Man: Miles Morales. The trailer starts out by showing Miles trying to push or break into what looks like a whole different dimension. Which is followed by a bunch of action sequences of the web-slinger swinging around across buildings, punching bad guys and jumping over a bunch of cars. The trailer also showcases some of his combat mechanics such as the camouflage ability which makes him practically invisible and his venom strike ability, which passes some form of current through his gloves inflicting higher damage to his victims. Towards the end, Miles takes off his mask before revealing the logo and the official working title. The game is scheduled to come out on the PlayStation 5 during Holiday 2020. Similar to the previous Spider-Man game, this one is a PlayStation exclusive as well.</p>
<p>Gran Turismo 7</p>
<p>The second title announced during the event is also a PlayStation exclusive - Gran Turismo 7. The trailer for the popular racing simulator starts out by showing some high-res close-ups of the internals of a race car while constantly switching to some action sequences every now and then. It then proceeds to show the beautiful lighting and reflection quality within the game before showcasing some of the world aspects. Interestingly, the trailer also gives a sneak peek into the gameplay by showcasing the new campaign mode and a whole bunch of customization options for your car. As of now, no release date has been revealed for this game.</p>
<p>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</p>
<p>The third title also comes from Insomniac Games - Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart. The game is a completely new full-length inter-dimensional story that has been built from scratch exclusively for the PlayStation 5. The trailer showcases some of the beautiful world elements and brightly coloured alien creatures before giving a first look at the dynamic duo. What follows next is a series of action sequences involving jumping and sliding across inter-dimensional portals, riding dragons, fighting alien pirates and gunning down wild mutts. It seems like the story revolves around exploring and traversing through new dimensions while destroying everything in front of you. Towards the end, you are also introduced to a female version of Ratchet. Probably from a different dimension. The game will also be introducing ray tracing technology for further intensifying the reflections on Clank’s metallic body.</p>
<p>Project Athia</p>
<p>For the fourth reveal, Square Enix came out with a new third-person action/adventure IP - Project Athia (working title). The game features a female protagonist introduced into a rather dead world filled with giant bloodthirsty monsters. The trailer also showcased a few of gameplay mechanics which included jumping across cliffs and what looks like an ability to summon earth elements to defeat enemies. Square Enix has not given much else to go about in regards to the game or its release date. The game will be exclusive for PS5 for a limited period of time, after which it will be available for PC as well.</p>
<p>Stray</p>
<p>Stray is set in a post-apocalyptic world, where robots have taken over. You take control of a stray cat who is stuck in a cyberpunkish world, to uncover a bunch of mysteries and get back to your real family. The game has got beautiful graphics, stunning neon lighting, relaxing music and it’s from Annapurna Interactive. That’s how you know it will be good. The game will be exclusive to PlayStation for a limited time before it is available on PC.</p>
<p>Returnal</p>
<p>The sixth title reveal comes from Housemarque - Returnal. Returnal is a third-person shooter, where you take control of a female space voyager who is stuck on a death loop. Based on the trailer, it seems like every time she dies, she wakes up again. But on a completely different hostile planet. This soon takes a toll on her mental health. So, she decides to fight back and end the loop before it destroys her mind. As revealed in the trailer, it looks like your job as the player is to fight against the aliens in each of those hostile planets and uncover the mystery behind this loop. This game is a PlayStation exclusive and there is no release window for it yet.</p>
<p>Sackboy: A Big Adventure</p>
<p>The iconic character from PlayStation’s LittleBigPlanet comes back in his solo iteration - Sackboy: A Big Adventure. The trailer starts out by jebaiting the audience into thinking that it is a furry game. Soon after, it reveals itself to be the much-adored anthropomorphized creature made of fabric. The game features a whole bunch of platform mechanics such as jumping on top of the incoming enemies, grappling hooks, walking on tight ropes and even riding ship and train cart apparently. The game will be a PlayStation exclusive and it does not have a release date yet.</p>
<p>Destruction AllStars</p>
<p>Destruction AllStars is a high-impact vehicle combat game. The trailer starts out by showing a bunch of wacky-looking characters within the game. It is then followed by those characters jumping into their brightly coloured cars and crashing into each other to be the last one standing. The map showcased in the trailer features a ton of colour and character and a whole bunch of challenging obstacles to pass through before your vehicle gets shattered to pieces. It seems like the game also offers a lot of customization options as well to increase your chances of winning. This indicates that the game has to be an online multiplayer experience. This game is a PlayStation exclusive. The release date for this game has not been revealed either.</p>
<p>Kena: Bridge of Spirits</p>
<p>The ninth title reveal is a third-person action game coming from an indie company called Ember Lab headed by two brothers Mike and Josh Grier. The trailer for Kena: Bridge of Spirits starts out by giving a first look at the protagonist, Kena meditating on a rock with cute tiny little creatures with black fur and huge eyes surrounding her. It then proceeds to give some hint of the primary plot of the game, which is to fight troubled spirits and set them free. The trailer showcases the environment, the otherworldly elements, magical creatures and some boss fights as well. As for gameplay mechanics, it seems like it is an exploration game with items littered throughout. Combat wise, it seems like her weapon of choice is a staff. Which can either be used as a melee weapon or bent to be used as a bow to shoot arrows created by her energy. Other than that, it looks like she possesses telekinetic abilities as well which looks sick. Kena: Bridge of Spirits is exclusive to PS5 for a limited time. There is no release date for this game for yet.</p>
<p>Goodbye Volcano High</p>
<p>The abundance of furry related content in this presentation is actually scary if you think about it. Goodbye Volcano High is a cinematic narrative game involving anthropomorphized dinosaurs in a high school setting. Based on the narration, it seems like an end of highschool tear-jerking story which will impact the player heavily. It has got a quite decent hand-drawn art style similar to anime art and great music as well. The game will be exclusive on PlayStation for a limited time and is scheduled to come out in 2021.</p>
<p>Oddworld: Soulstorm</p>
<p>Oddworld: Soulstorm is the latest game in the Oddworld franchise which got revealed at this presentation. As stated by the creator Lorne Lanning, this iteration of the 2.5D action-adventure platformer will be highly story-centric. The game will be featuring a completely new emotionally engaging story which should keep you glued to your seats and instil new memories for the age-old franchise. Oddworld: Soulstorm will be exclusive to PlayStation for a limited time.</p>
<p>GhostWire: Tokyo</p>
<p>GhostWire Tokyo is a first-person supernatural action game where your primary objective is to fight evil spirits in Tokyo. The trailer starts out by introducing the city, where 99 percent of the population has vanished. They are instead replaced by some ghosts or spirits that you need to fight to uncover the mystery behind the mass disappearance. In order to defeat them the player has to use the supernatural abilities at his disposal. The trailer showcases a bunch of abilities including fire-spouting (exorcism by fire), water-spouting, fire arrows, spiritual incantations and telekinesis to name a few. As for your enemies, you have a headless school girl, a Japanese rain doll, humanoid electronic appliances and a creepy kid in a yellow raincoat to name just a few. The game is set to come out in 2021 and is exclusive to PS5 for a limited time.</p>
<p>JETT: The Far Shore</p>
<p>JETT: The Far Shore seems like more of an experience rather than a game. Based on the trailer the premise looks like - two explorers from a small village were sent on an intergalactic mission. After they launch into space, the trailer then cuts ahead hundred of years where the two continue to explore several planets. It is not clear from the trailer as to what they were searching for or what their mission was. But it sure does look interesting. The game is set to come out in Holiday 2020 and is exclusive to PlayStation for a limited time.</p>
<p>Godfall</p>
<p>From Gearbox publishing, Godfall is a third-person fantasy looter-slasher RPG set in a fantasy universe with heroic knights. After a couple of character close-ups in the game, the trailer proceeds to show the gameplay. The gameplay involves melee combat using a wide arsenal of weapons including swords, staffs and axes to name a few. The game also offers a bunch of player upgrades including armour sets and weapons for better combat. Godfall can be played either in solo mode, duo or three-player coop as well. The game is set to come out during Holiday 2020 and is exclusive to the PS5 for a limited time.</p>
<p>Solar Ash</p>
<p>Solar Ash is the latest game from Heart Machine, creators of Hyper Light Drifter. Based on the trailer, Solar Ash seems like another one of those narrative-based experience games, where there is no real objective. But you just go with the flow. It looks like in this case, the player travels through space via rifts, explores different planets and meets interesting characters that tell a unique story. Solar Ash is set to come out in 2021 and is exclusive to PlayStation for a limited time.</p>
<p>Hitman 3</p>
<p>The sixteenth reveal comes from IO Interactive - Hitman 3. The third instalment of the game marks the dramatic conclusion to Agent 47’s reboot story. The game sends the player to numerous locations worldwide with a contract to assassinate someone using their skills in a sandboxy environment. The trailer starts off by showing some flashback sequences from the previous iterations. It then cuts off to a forest where it looks as if a bunch of ICA agents are trying to hunt down Agent 47. They are all taken down one by one methodically before Agent 47 reveals his face on camera. The trailer then cuts off to show some of the world and important characters to look forward to in the game. Hitman 3 is set to come out in January 2021.</p>
<p>Astro’s Playroom</p>
<p>Astro’s Playroom is a fun platformer that comes pre-loaded on the PlayStation 5. It is somewhat of a walkthrough/tutorial game to introduce you to your brand new console. The game has four different maps, with each of them based on the PS5’s different console components. Each area in the game introduces and forces the player to use the new features of the DualSense wireless controller. This seems like a fun, interactive and innovative way to pull off a tutorial. As you would guess, this is a PS5 exclusive.</p>
<p>Little Devil Inside</p>
<p>Originally pledged as a Kickstarter campaign, Little Devil Inside is an action-adventure RPG with survival elements set in a semi-open world. Based on the trailer, it looks like your job is to hunt for monsters in the wild for either money or food. The trailer showcases some of the locations and monsters in the game such as a dragon in the forest, a giant octopus in the depths of the ocean, a werewolf in the moonlight and a yeti in the coldest regions. The trailer also showcases some gameplay elements such as deep-sea diving, rappelling, patching up your wounds, using animals for transportation and rock climbing to name a few. As for combat, you have sword fighting, using fishing hooks and shotguns. Little Devil Inside will be exclusive to PlayStation for a limited time.</p>
<p>NBA 2K21</p>
<p>There is not much to say about sports games in general. They’re all the same every year. Guess we could say the sweat in this game looks realistic and better this time? NBA 2K21 is set to come out in Fall 2020.</p>
<p>Bugsnax</p>
<p>From the creators of Octodad: Deadliest Catch comes Bugsnax. Bugsnax is a first-person exploration adventure game where you are cast as a journalist to investigate the latest discovery on Snacktooth Island and apparently, consume humanoid strawberries for sustenance. The game offers a lot of customization options for your character and it also lets you sing campfire songs with other characters in the game? Bugsnax will be out during Holiday 2020 exclusively on PlayStation for a limited time.</p>
<p>Demon’s Souls</p>
<p>This remake of an all-time PlayStation classic has been coming a long time. The trailer starts out by showing some of the less creepy world elements accompanied by orchestral music. The music and visuals then switch abruptly to reveal all the monsters within the game in full glory. Before revealing the official title. Demon’s Souls will be a PlayStation exclusive. No news on its release date though.</p>
<p>DEATHLOOP</p>
<p>For the twenty-second reveal, creators of the Dishonored franchise, Arkane Studios revealed their new game. DEATHLOOP is being advertised as a first-person shooter game, which is completely different from their past games, which were based on pure stealth. Based on the trailer, we can see that the game still does maintain the Dishonored stealth feel though, with the silenced weapons, swords and aerial takedowns. You can also see that it still uses the prime gameplay mechanics from Dishonored such as teleportation and lifting off enemies. Although the primary game mechanics shown in the trailer is the gun game it is very evident that stealth is still a viable option. DEATHLOOP will be available exclusively on PS5 for a limited period of time. No details on the release window though.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Village</p>
<p>After numerous leaks and rumours surrounding the game, Resident Evil VIII finally got announced at this presentation. The trailer starts off by introducing us to the creepy deeply dense forest location the game is set in. It then proceeds to give a small glimpse of the gameplay where it becomes clear that this iteration of Resident Evil will be in a first-person perspective. The trailer then proceeds to showcase a series of quick jumpcut sequences highlighting some important locations and characters within the game in sync with the music. Based on the footage shown it seems like we will be dealing with a cult this time. And for some reason, a werewolf as well? Resident Evil Village comes out in 2021.</p>
<p>Pragmata</p>
<p>The twenty-fourth game to be revealed instantly gave off a Death Stranding vibe with the main character’s bulky suit and backpack. The trailer for Capcom’s Pragmata starts off by an astronaut looking figure shooting something that looks like spores into the air, which reveals some silhouettes in what seems like a post-apocalyptic world. Based on the events transpiring, it looks like the game has something to do with time travel or memories. Soon after, certain unfortunate events transfer the characters to the moon which leads us to believe that this could be a lunar adventure game. Pragmata is currently in development for the PlayStation 5 and will be launching in 2022.</p>
<p>Horizon Forbidden West</p>
<p>This long-awaited sequel to the 2017 action-adventure RPG was the final announcement at this presentation. The trailer showcases some footage of the beautiful world elements where the game will be based upon with a narrative from Aloy. You then see a series of clips showing the newly born creatures, more majestic machines, underwater secret locations, exploration features, a looming apocalypse and a gigantic mammoth to top that off. Similar to the previous iteration of the game, this one will be a PlayStation exclusive as well.</p>
<p>We would say that this event by PlayStation was an overall success. A total of 25 title reveals, well-produced presentation and finally a first look at the new sleek looking PlayStation 5 console. Similar to this event, Microsoft had also held a conference for the Xbox Series X earlier this month, showcasing a bunch of new game titles for their upcoming next-gen console. The event had received a ton of backlash for false advertising gameplay footage for Ubisoft’s upcoming title, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, which you can check out here. Additionally, feel free to sign up to the Summer Game Fest here, to keep up to date with new gaming events as and when they pop up.

<h3 id="the-15-best-netflix-original-animated-series-from-she-ra-to-bojack-horseman">&ldquo;The 15 best Netflix Original animated series, from She-Ra to BoJack Horseman&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rWTAGcUveQYdjocjWQxxRf-1200-80.jpg" alt="img">
“Animation is not a genre. Animation is an artform and it can do any genre.”</p>
<p>As director of The Incredibles and The Iron Giant, Brad Bird should know what he’s talking about – and looking at how the medium’s evolved over the last 30 years, it’s impossible to disagree.</p>
<p>As recently as the early ’90s, cartoons were still widely regarded as something for the kids. Since then, however, The Simpsons, Family Guy and South Park have paved the way for more adult-oriented animation on TV, while the groundbreaking likes of Pixar, DreamWorks and Laika have pushed the boundaries of what animators can achieve on screen.</p>
<p>These days animation is a broad church taking in everything from comedy for pre-schoolers to sophisticated examinations of the human soul. As with its live-action programming, Netflix’s animated content explores a huge range of styles, genres and themes – and a lot of its shows are absolutely essential viewing.</p>
<p>In this list, TechRadar has brought together 15 of the best Netflix Original animated series you can watch right now – whether you’re into gritty sci-fi, family comedy or sword-wielding warrior princesses, there’s something for you here.</p>
<p>She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</p>
<p>(Image credit: Netflix) (Image credit: Netflix)</p>
<p>The original She-Ra was a spin-off from He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, an ’80s cartoon that was much better at flogging toys than telling stories. Few seriously believed it needed a comeback, until this hit Netflix show proved otherwise. Series creator Noelle Stevenson put the emphasis on reinvention, crafting a fun, intelligent, sophisticated saga that couldn’t be further from the po-faced source material.</p>
<p>With He-Man nowhere to be seen, twin sister Adora takes centre stage, wielding the magic sword that turns her into She-Ra and displaying refreshingly 21st century attitudes to representation. The kind of Saturday morning cartoon you encourage your kids to watch.</p>
<p>Love, Death + Robots</p>
<p>(Image credit: Netflix) (Image credit: Netflix)</p>
<p>With the likes of Black Mirror, a rebooted Twilight Zone and Inside No 9, the anthology series has gone through something of a renaissance in recent years. The genius at the heart of Love, Death + Robots, however, is that by telling its one-off tales via the medium of animation, the show has ensured its only limitations are the imaginations of its writers.</p>
<p>Luckily it has an ingenious plan for navigating that particular obstacle – adapting short stories from some of the finest genre authors on the planet, Peter F Hamilton, Alastair Reynolds and John Scalzi among them. Among the best sci-fi currently on TV.</p>
<p>Disenchantment</p>
<p>(Image credit: Netflix) (Image credit: Netflix)</p>
<p>After creating The Simpsons, Matt Groening would have been forgiven for throwing away his pencil and stepping away from animation for good. Thank goodness he didn’t, because then we wouldn’t have been treated to the peerless 31st century adventures of Futurama – or Disenchantment, a deliciously twisted take on epic fantasy.</p>
<p>With plenty of trademark Groening overbites, lots of pop culture references, and some razor-sharp skewering of the modern world, there’s no doubt the new show comes from the same stable as its predecessors. But it’s also home to more grown-up themes, and boasts a more serialized arc plot – perfect for the era of binge TV.</p>
<p>BoJack Horseman</p>
<p>(Image credit: Netflix) (Image credit: Netflix)</p>
<p>A cartoon about a talking horse who was once the star of his own hit sitcom? BoJack Horseman looked – on paper, at least – like it was going to be the height of silliness when it cantered onto Netflix back in 2014. Raphael Bob-Waksberg’s undefinable show has been defying expectations ever since, evolving from a hilariously acerbic satire on Hollywood – albeit one where animals and humans live alongside one another – into something much more ambitious.</p>
<p>By turns funny, bleak and toe-curlingly awkward (and sometimes even heartwarming), few TV shows have ever delved further into the human (and equine) condition. One of the jewels in Netflix’s impressive crown.</p>
<p>Castlevania</p>
<p>(Image credit: Netflix) (Image credit: Netflix)</p>
<p>The long-running, vampire-infested console actioner that’s been scaring players since the ’80s gets reinvented as a TV series – and puts most other videogame adaptations to shame. The Hobbit’s Richard Armitage voices monster-hunting hero Trevor Belmont, teaming up with Dracula’s half-human son Alucard (Battlestar Galactica’s James Callis) against the infamous Count.</p>
<p>With plenty of gore, every episode written by comics legend Warren Ellis, and anime-inspired visuals, it’s clearly aimed at old-school fans of the franchise – indeed, chances are you wouldn’t want your kids tuning in.</p>
<p>Voltron: Legendary Defender</p>
<p>(Image credit: Netflix) (Image credit: Netflix)</p>
<p>A re-dubbed, re-edited reinvention of Japanese anime show Beast King GoLion, Voltron has retained plenty of cult appeal since it debuted in the ’80s. This latest incarnation picks up the story of five teen pilots whose robot lions come together to form a giant mecha fighting machine called Voltron – Earth’s last defence against the evil Galra Empire.</p>
<p>Luckily, showrunners and Avatar: The Last Airbender veterans Lauren Montgomery and Joaquim dos Santos realize cool iconography isn’t enough to carry the show, and load the series with epic outer space action and fun character beats – along with surprisingly dark themes about PTSD and bereavement.</p>
<p>Dragons: Race to the Edge</p>
<p>(Image credit: Netflix) (Image credit: Netflix)</p>
<p>TV spin-offs from movies don’t have to be cheap cash-ins. Just as the Star Wars universe was undeniably enhanced by the existence of The Clone Wars and Rebels, this long-running series is a vital addition to the soaring Viking adventures of How to Train Your Dragon.</p>
<p>Okay, Cressida Cowell’s stories don’t have quite as much dramatic scope as George Lucas’s saga, but nevertheless, Hiccup and Toothless’s adventures between the first two movies are suitably epic. The CG animation is much better than you’d usually expect on TV, and – with many of the movie cast reprising their roles – Dragons feels like a blockbuster sequel in episodic form.</p>
<p>Trollhunters</p>
<p>(Image credit: Netflix) (Image credit: Netflix)</p>
<p>From Hellboy to Pan’s Labyrinth, to The Devil’s Backbone to The Shape of Water, Guillermo del Toro has a long history of infusing tales of the supernatural with memorable characters and plenty of heart. It’s no surprise, then, that the animated series he created should follow a similar blueprint.</p>
<p>There’s a definite Buffy vibe to the show, as ordinary kid Jim discovers he’s the chosen one destined to protect his town from subterranean beasts, taking on the mantle of the first ever human Trollhunter. It’s part of a wider universe, too: the second series in del Toro’s Tales of Arcadia trilogy, the sci-fi-tinged 3Below, debuted in 2018, while final instalment Wizards is due in August 2020.</p>
<p>The Midnight Gospel</p>
<p>(Image credit: Netflix) (Image credit: Netflix)</p>
<p>Pendleton Ward, creator of hit animation series Adventure Time, teams up with comedian Duncan Trussell to create another slice of trippy surreality. Where Adventure Time focused on the fantasy world of Ooo, The Midnight Gospel sets its coordinates for outer space, namely a weird dimension known as the Chromatic Ribbon.</p>
<p>From here a spacecaster called Clancy (effectively a podcaster with interstellar reach) uses his illegal multiverse simulator to interview beings from other planets. Despite only eight episodes being available so far, The Midnight Gospel has already proved itself infinitely inventive, visually stylish and emotionally powerful – and totally unlike anything else on TV. Cross your fingers it gets a greenlight for season two.</p>
<p>Tuca &amp; Bertie</p>
<p>(Image credit: Netflix) (Image credit: Netflix)</p>
<p>With a pair of anthropomorphized birds as its lead characters, Tuca &amp; Bertie looks a lot like a BoJack Horseman spin-off. Despite the fact it was created by BoJack production designer Lisa Hanawalt, however, this one-season wonder is very much its own beast. At its heart are two avian best friends, loud-mouthed toucan Tuca, and her song thrush roomie Bertie.</p>
<p>Packed with clever puns and visual gags (anyone fancy posting to Facebeak?), the show delivers a unique perspective on life and love in the 21st century. Yet its trump card is the casting of top comedians Tiffany Haddish and Ali Wong in the lead roles – this is one double act we’d love to have seen more of.</p>
<p>Big Mouth</p>
<p>(Image credit: Netflix) (Image credit: Netflix)</p>
<p>Don’t be put off by the unsophisticated animation style. Like Netflix stablemate Sex Education, Big Mouth is impressively candid when it comes to bodily functions and other issues associated with growing up – despite the fact its characters are regularly visited by surreal products of their imaginations such as a Shame Wizard and a Hormone Monster called Maurice.</p>
<p>Co-creators Nick Kroll and Andrew Goldberg drew on their own teenage experiences to tell the story of best friends Andrew and Nick, but it’s hard to believe their real lives were quite this funny – as with The Inbetweeners, Big Mouth shows that teens can get away with the kind of crude gags nobody else can.</p>
<p>F is for Family</p>
<p>(Image credit: Netflix) (Image credit: Netflix)</p>
<p>If you thought that The Simpsons, King of the Hill and Family Guy were all the animated, suburban family comedies you’d ever need, think again because F is for Family is a worthy addition to the sub-genre. In fact, co-creator/star Bill Burr’s show instantly distances itself from those other shows with its 1970s setting, an era that puts a very different perspective on the world.</p>
<p>Family patriarch Frank Murphy is an angry guy, increasingly disillusioned with his lot in life and struggling to deal with society evolving faster than he’d like. With plenty of pathos to go with the humour, it’s impressively three-dimensional stuff.</p>
<p>Carmen Sandiego</p>
<p>(Image credit: Netflix) (Image credit: Netflix)</p>
<p>If there are prizes given out for the most stylish animated series on Netflix, the elegant production design of Carmen Sandiego has to make it a contender. Based on a 1980s videogame (which also spawned two game shows and a cartoon series in the ’90s), this Netflix incarnation tells the story of the eponymous super-thief, voiced by Jane the Virgin’s Gina Rodriguez.</p>
<p>Of course, this being a kids’ show, Carmen isn’t really a criminal – despite what the authorities claim. Instead she uses her heisting skills to steal back what’s been taken by the despicable operatives of V.I.L.E – aka the Villains International League of Evil – in a series packed with fun adventures and plenty of backstory. Stranger Things and IT’s Finn Wolfhard co-stars as sidekick Player.</p>
<p>Hilda</p>
<p>(Image credit: Netflix) (Image credit: Netflix)</p>
<p>This cartoon series may look like something from the 1980s, but it actually debuted in 2018. Based on an award-winning series of independent graphic novels by British creator Luke Pearson, the show mixes a Scandinavian setting that evokes the Moomins with a visual style reminiscent of Studio Ghibli legend Hayao Miyazaki.</p>
<p>It follows the exploits of titular blue-haired pre-teen Hilda (voiced by Bella Ramsey, the heroic Lyanna Mormont in Game of Thrones) when she moves from her magical village to the big city – and discovers there’s just as much supernatural stuff going on behind the scenes&hellip; The series clearly has younger audiences in its sights, but there’s also a surprising amount of emotional depth lurking beneath the surface.</p>
<p>The Hollow</p>
<p>(Image credit: Netflix) (Image credit: Netflix)</p>
<p>A trio of teenage strangers wake up to find themselves in an underground bunker. With their memories erased, they have to come together to survive the bizarre, dangerous, puzzle-filled world they find themselves in – all while working out why the hell they were brought together in the first place.</p>
<p>If the ingenious Maze Runner-like premise of The Hollow isn’t enough to draw you in, rest assured that there’s plenty more to like in this super-smart kids’ show. It’s fast-paced, the core characters are memorable, and there’s plenty of genre-hopping in a gripping serialized story arc.

<h3 id="the-switch-eshop-sees-a-bumper-crop-of-new-games-including-atomicrops-xenoblade-chronicles-minecraft-dungeons-and-three-2k-collections">&ldquo;The Switch eShop sees a bumper crop of new games, including Atomicrops, Xenoblade Chronicles, Minecraft Dungeons and three 2K collections&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.gamesasylum.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/NSwitch_XenobladeChroniclesDefinitiveEdition_01.jpg" alt="img">
Big-name Switch releases are bountiful this week. In fact, it’s quite possibly the biggest week for the Switch so far this year – there’s a lot of good stuff on the table. Today’s foodstuff puns come courtesy of Atomicrops, incidentally.</p>
<p>From Nintendo themselves there’s the anticipated JRPG Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition – a remaster of one of the Wii’s finest hours. “One of the best Japanese role-players of last generation is still one of the best on current formats, with an excellent remaster that includes a generous amount of new content,” said The Metro before dishing out a 9/10.</p>
<p>It also gained a 9.5 from Destructoid. “Even if it didn’t have an extra chapter to conquer, Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition deserves a third release. The Switch version has united this modern classic with the TV mode of the Wii original and the fully portable nature of the New 3DS edition. It’s truly definitive,” they said while awarding it a lofty 9.5.</p>
<p>Minecraft Dungeons offers a very different role-playing experience. It’s Diablo for the younger generation, pretty much. Some critics found it a bit too easy going for its own good, though, complaining about its fleeting nature.</p>
<p>“While the overall brevity and lesser level diversity is disheartening, Minecraft Dungeons is an enjoyable experience. It’s much harder to recommend as a solo player, but if you’re able to hang out on the couch and knock out some creepers with a pal or head online and smash up mobs with a buddy, the weaker elements can wash away. I had a good time playing Minecraft Dungeons. I just wish there was a little more to it,” was Nintendo World Report’s verdict.</p>
<p>From 2K Games comes seven(!) conversions. Borderlands Legendary Collection brings together Borderlands: Game of the Year Edition, Borderlands 2, and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel and a bunch of DLC, while BioShock: The Collection includes BioShock Remastered, BioShock 2 Remastered, and BioShock Infinite: The Complete Edition and all the single-player add-ons.</p>
<p>XCOM 2 Collection is loaded with DLC too, offering four DLC packs (Resistance Warrior Pack, Anarchy’s Children, Alien Hunters, Shen’s Last Gift) and the War of the Chosen expansion.</p>
<p>The hip swaying Shantae is back this week too. Shantae and the Seven Sirens gained an 8.5 from Nintendo World Report’s well-versed reviewer. “Having now cleared the game three times, thus securing all five ending screens (another Shantae standard), I can safely state that Seven Sirens, while different from Pirate’s Curse in many ways, is nonetheless its equal. If you like “Metroidvania” games in general or Shantae games specifically, it’s a can’t-miss,” they claimed.</p>
<p>Retro fans may also want to check out the feature-packed SEGA AGES Thunder Force AC. The shooter is going down a treat, gaining Nintendo Life’s recommendation. “Whether you’re a shmup fiend or a complete amateur, there’s fun to be had here,” was their conclusion.</p>
<p>That’s accompanied by a surprise release of Game Tengoku CruisinMix Special – a cult 1997 Japanese shooter featuring a cast of often-forgotten Jaleco characters.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of other games to get stuck into this week, including the colourful roguelite farming simulator Atomicrops, the Paper Mario-style RPG Bug Fables. tongue-in-cheek business sim Turmoil, Atari’s bargain-priced (£2.69) Missile Command: Recharged, and the 1920’s third-person adventure Adam’s Venture: Origins.</p>

<h3 id="this-weeks-xbox-one-releases-may-25-29-2020">&ldquo;This week’s Xbox One releases (May 25-29, 2020)&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.thumbsticks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/new-xbox-one-game-releases.png?resize=1000%2C600&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
There are over 740 games in the Itch.io Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality and it costs just $5. But you can pay more than five bucks, of course.</p>
<p>Black Lives Matter protests have been taking place across the United States after a Black Minnesota man, George Floyd, was killed by a police officer on May 25, 2020. That police officer knelt on his neck and back for almost nine minutes, while Floyd called out that he couldn’t breathe and three other officers stood and watched. The killing was filmed and widely shared, which led to protests; first in Minnesota, then nationwide.</p>
<p>In the days of protest since, police forces and national guard have responded with force, pelting protesters and press alike with tear gas and batons and rubber bullets. It’s a heavy-handed and militaristic response to what feels like inevitable action, protests against hundreds of years of racial inequality and institutionalised violence.</p>
<p>It’s unimportant in the grand scheme of things but this has, of course, had an impact on the video game industry. In the week we all would’ve been at E3, the Los Angeles Convention Center has been converted into a staging post for the National Guard. PlayStation – and numerous others – have cancelled their big streams and reveal events in what would’ve been the E3 reveal period.</p>
<p>But what’s also happened is that the video game industry has rallied. It has put on a plethora of charity streams, bundles and sales to raise money for Black Lives Matter, the NCAAP, emergency bail funds, and other associated charities. We even got in on the act, small a contribution as it was, and recommend you do the same.</p>
<p>We just donated all of our advertising revenue from May to @bailfundnetwork&rsquo;s emergency rapid response fund – it&rsquo;s not much, and we&rsquo;re just a silly video game website, but we felt like we had to do something because #BlackLivesMatter https://t.co/wH5yUHDzEF — Thumbsticks (@thumb_sticks) June 3, 2020</p>
<p>But the contribution from the indie-friendly storefront, Itch.io, and hundreds of developers and publishers on the platform is not small. At the time of writing, the Itch.io Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality has raised over $600k US in less than a day, and looks set to obliterate its target of $1m over the bundle’s 10-day window.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that this bundle is going so well. Quite aside from the charity aspect – which is, of course, the most important thing here – the Itch.io Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality includes (again, at the time of writing) 742 games for the meagre price of just $5 US. (Just over £4.) It’s no wonder people have been snapping it up.</p>
<p>But what makes the bundle even more remarkable is the quality of the games included, which features, among others:</p>
<p>Night in the Woods</p>
<p>Oxenfree</p>
<p>A Mortician’s Tale</p>
<p>A Short Hike</p>
<p>Overland</p>
<p>Super Hexagon</p>
<p>Minit</p>
<p>Art Sqool</p>
<p>Wheels of Aurelia</p>
<p>Wide Ocean Big Jacket</p>
<p>Quadrilateral Cowboy</p>
<p>Spring Falls</p>
<p>Imagine buying one of those games for a fiver. Something amazing, like Night in the Woods, let’s say. That normally costs about 20 quid. Then when you open it you realise there are 740 other games in there that cost you absolutely nothing! It’s a hell of a bundle, that to buy separately would cost you three and a half grand.</p>
<p>That’s not the important thing here, of course. It’s money raised for important Black Lives Matter charities, raising money to support protestors and work to smash violent and systemically racist systems in the United States and beyond, that is the big-ticket item. (But if the promise of hundreds of games for next-to-nothing prices is what it takes to persuade fence-sitters and the “keep politics out of video games” crowd to donate to the Black Lives Matter effort? It’s still a win.)</p>
<p>And don’t forget: $5 is just the minimum entry point for the Itch.io Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality. You can absolutely pay more than five dollars. You should pay more than five dollars for 740+ video games and to support Black Lives Matter.</p>
<p>Actually, we’re going to go one step further than that: You must, because it is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>date: 2020-06-16T09:58:32+08:00</p>
<p>Since this story was originally published on June 6, 2020, the total amount of money raised by the Itch.io Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality has ballooned. At the time of writing, it’s just creeping up to $2.5m, while the target has been bumped up to $5m dollars.</p>
<p>That is a phenomenal amount of money and there’s no sign of it stopping yet.</p>
<p>Well done, nerds. We’re proud of you.</p>
<p>date: 2020-06-16T09:58:32+08:00</p>
<p>At the time of writing – around 8pm BST, on June 15 – the Itch.io Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality has half a day left to run. That’s just 12 hours to pick up over 1700 indie games for just $5.</p>
<p>Well, you could pay five bucks, but as it’s raising money for a good cause, you should totally pay more than a fiver. And we presume lots of you have been doing, because the bundle is just coming up on $7.3 million raised for charity, which is just astonishing.</p>
<p>There aren’t enough words to convey how proud we are of the gaming world for this, to the developers involved and everyone who’s donated. You’re all brilliant and we love you.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for ways to help, this Black Lives Matter Carrd site features a wealth of information on ways to help, funds you can donate to, and resources covering everything from protesting to mental health.

<p>If my life was a book, a select number of video games would serve as bookmarks to some of its chapters. The original Sakura Wars would be one of those games.</p>
<p>There are games that just stick with you no matter how much time passes. Oftentimes, these are games that you like so much, they remind you of moments from your past the same way a favorite song from high school would.</p>
<p>Thoughts of my mom’s old room and its gaudy red carpet would always pop in my mind, for example, every time I think of the original 8-bit Ninja Gaiden game on the Nintendo Entertainment System. I can still see my brother handing me the controller every time he made it to the game’s final boss. Contra III: The Alien Wars, meanwhile, always reminds me of the first time I arrived in the United States. Back then, I would scale the tall wall behind our condo so I could take a short cut to the nearby Target and play the game for free on the store’s SNES console demo unit.</p>

<p>Then there’s Sakura Wars.</p>
<p>Known as Sakura Taisen in Japan, my encounter with the original Saturn game was one born out of both curiosity and necessity. At the time, I started learning Japanese and had amassed a collection of books for my studies. These texts, however, were quite cut-and-dry and I needed additional motivation to help things better stick in my head. As someone who loved video games, I thought, “Why not get a text-heavy game and use that to learn reading?” One of the gaming magazines I read had an ad from a Japanese game importer and the upcoming Sakura Taisen game was one of the titles it featured. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>
<p>Looking back, using Sakura Wars to learn Japanese was like the video game equivalent of throwing a kid in a pool to teach the poor child to swim. I literally spent hundreds of hours looking up words and characters from the game with my trusty Japanese-English dictionary and Kanji reference books. The crazy thing is, it actually worked. That first game and the other Sakura Wars games that followed were largely responsible for the quick progress that I made in learning the language. My reading, in particular, improved exponentially.</p>
<p>One big reason was that I absolutely fell in love with the series. There was just something about the Sakura Wars formula that got me hopelessly hooked. From its mix of steampunk elements mixed with an early 20th-century Tokyo vibe to the distinct character designs by Kosuke Fujishima, the game’s presentation definitely hit the right buttons for me. Add the game’s writing, its interactive dialogue system, its tactical RPG combat, as well as its nice selection of mini-games and I found the gameplay quite enjoyable as well. It was almost like an anime show, a visual novel and a strategy RPG all rolled into one.</p>
<p>Ueno Park, which was the setting for one of the game’s key scenes, actually became one of my first stops when I visited Japan. That’s how much of an impression the franchise made on me. Over the years, the various entries in the Sakura Wars series easily made their way into my list of favorite games of all time. I even imported spin-offs such as the Columns-stye Sakura Wars puzzle games and the more action-oriented Sakura Wars V Episode 0 because I couldn’t get enough of the series and its characters. For more than a decade, Sakura Wars was a constant presence in my life as a gamer.</p>
<p>To say that I was saddened by the series’ disappearance after Sakura Wars V would be an understatement. It also came as a big surprise. Back in 1996, the first game was the second-most wanted title in a poll by Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu behind only Final Fantasy VII. This, by the way, was back when Final Fantasy was a huge deal in Japan. The early Sakura Wars games also did incredibly well in Japan. All of a sudden, the franchise was just gone.</p>
<p>The new Sakura Wars game features DLC costumes from past titles in the series, including clothing worn by Kohran, Maria, Ogami, Sakura, Kanna and Reni.</p>

<p>For years, I held out hope that Sakura Wars would make a return. Eventually, however, developer RED Entertainment — which partnered with Sega and came up with the concept for the series — ended up experiencing financial difficulties. Meanwhile, gamers’ tastes started swinging toward other genres and the video game industry also underwent a seismic shift in Japan as mobile games gained popularity. Given all those headwinds, I finally gave up hope on a new Sakura Wars game. Even after the series ranked No. 1 in a Sega survey of old games that people wanted to see once more, I wasn’t completely confident that Sakura Wars would be revived. By the time Sega announced its intention to bring the series back, I was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I had some misgivings. My memories of Sakura Wars were near and dear to my heart but it’s also been such a long time since I played a game from the series. In the last few years, I also noticed that I no longer had the same feverish interest I used to with several games I used to like. What if I’ve outgrown Sakura Wars as well? Those doubts, however, melted as soon as I heard the familiar opening song when I loaded up the Japanese copy of the game last year. All of a sudden, I felt like the same young kid who was studying Japanese for the first time once again as my memories of all those previous Sakura Wars games came flooding back.</p>
<p>I also started thinking about the game’s impending western release. Sakura Wars V, for example, was the only game in the series that got an official English version. It was a version that I never got to play, however, so all of my experience with the series came from playing the Japanese versions of its games. I was worried that playing the game in English just wouldn’t feel the same.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the English version worked out quite well. Granted, there are times when the localizing team takes some liberties with the translation and changes the dialogue a bit. Overall, though, I think the translators did a good job with the localization, especially given how certain words and puns don’t exactly translate well to English. There were even times when I found myself spitting out laughing after reading some of the dialogue because the translation team did a great job in capturing the humor for that specific conversation. Eventually, I noticed myself reading the English text naturally as opposed to picking it apart comparing it to what was being said though the voiced dialogue in Japanese.</p>

<p>(Photo: SEGA)</p>
<p>And yes, the voiced dialogue in the localized version is still in Japanese. For me, that’s actually not a problem because I prefer Japanese voice acting for anime-style games like this. I also find the lack of an English dub understandable due to the costs that such an endeavor entails, especially for a series that doesn’t exactly have a strong following outside of Japan. That being said, if you’re someone who prefers your media to be dubbed, the lack of English voice acting will still be a bummer.</p>
<p>On the plus side, you can still enjoy the narrative despite the absence of voiced English dialogue. Storytelling, after all, is a big part of the Sakura Taisen series and the new Sakura Wars isn’t any different. This time around, you play an all-new protagonist in Seijuro Kamiyama, a former Navy captain who is reassigned to a Tokyo-based anti-Demon fighting force known as the Imperial Combat Revue. As in past games, the members of this division double up not just as fighters but also as theater actors who perform shows for the public. Unlike the Imperial Combat Revue&rsquo;s legendary Flower Division of past games, however, the current group has fallen on hard times. Thanks to a lack of support from the people, the military and the government, the Imperial Combat Revue has to scrape by a meager existence. This is all happening despite Kanzaki Heavy Industries heir and former Flower Division fighter Sumire Kanzaki taking the helm of the organization.</p>
<p>Let me just say, by the way, how happy I was to see Sumire appear onscreen the first time that I saw her. She was actually my favorite character from the original series and it was nice to see her strutting around the theater like a flamboyant peacock once more. Even Sumire, however, is not a miracle worker and after pouring in her own resources into the organization, the lack of successful results has finally caught up to the struggling organization. Whether it be the once mighty Grand Imperial Theater or the Flower Division’s spiricle robots, everything is aging and practically falling apart. As a final act of ignominy, the Flower Division also has to rely on the Shanghai Combat Revue to defend its own city from demon attacks due to the perceived inadequacies of the Tokyo team. It is under this depressing backdrop that Seijuro arrives on the scene and is given the task to turn the downtrodden organization around. A former rising star in the Navy, Seijuro himself has his own literal and personal demons to deal with. This makes the flawed yet promising officer the perfect captain for an equally flawed yet promising team.</p>

<p>(Photo: SEGA)</p>
<p>Like the other Sakura Wars games that came before it, the writing in this soft reboot runs the gamut from comical and lighthearted situations to more serious fare. Some of the scenes involving Seijuro’s crisis of conscience every time he enters the bath area — either accidentally or on purpose — for example, legitimately cracked me up. The same can be said about the goofier dialogue choices you get when talking to the game’s various characters. This includes literally bribing a kid with snacks (which worked flawlessly, by the way) or making a comically off-the-mark observation about one team member having two pillows on her bed instead of just one.</p>
<p>At the same time, the story also has its share of serious moments. From the lasting impact of the Great Demon War that ravaged Tokyo 10 years ago to dealing with the ragtag group’s own feelings of inadequacy, Sakura Wars does not have a shortage of drama. Admittedly, there are times when the story resorts to tropes as well as seemingly forced conflict. The biggest issue I have as a longtime fan, however, is the way they decided to address the fate of the squad members from the past games. Although it’s nice to see how heroically the members of the old Tokyo, Paris and New York strike forces are portrayed, I also felt that they were pretty much cast aside in order to clear the way and pass the torch to the new team. Players such as myself undoubtedly invested a lot of time and emotion in these characters when we played the older games many years ago. One of the things I really looked forward to when I first heard about the new Sakura Wars game, for example, was seeing how those old characters were doing nowadays, even if it may be in a limited supporting role. With the exception of Sumire, however, they’re pretty much reduced to just being in the background. The fact that you can collect bromides or images of these characters that remind you of classic scenes from past games makes it even more painful to realize that they don’t have a larger presence in the game. It just feels like a wasted opportunity, especially in terms of giving fans of the past games some satisfying form of closure regarding their old favorites.</p>

<p>(Photo: SEGA)</p>
<p>As a result, I could see the approach fueling backlash among older fans of the game, especially against the new characters. This would be unfortunate as I found the game’s new cast to be quite likable. Clarissa Snowflake, for example, starts out a bit annoying with her constant self-pity and pessimism. After the opening chapter, however, she quickly turned into one of my favorite characters thanks to her ditzy secret notes as well as her hilarious reactions to anything potentially romantic that Kamiyama does. A disastrous — and entirely optional — public confession from Kamiyama involving dolphins comes to mind, for example. Young ninja girl Azami, meanwhile, doesn’t like it when she’s treated like a kid. That being said, she is also oblivious to the fact that she’s totally susceptible to things that kids like, including bribes involving snacks.</p>
<p>Knowing such personality quirks is important when talking to the various characters because they determine what dialogue choices will get a positive reaction from them during the game’s interactive “LIPS” conversation system. The timed dialogue choices are a staple of the Sakura Wars games and add an extra layer of interactivity compared to, say, visual novels. These interactive conversations are basically what make playing Sakura Wars a unique experience and have traditionally been the selling point of the franchise. Fiery shrine maiden Hatsuho, for example, typically likes strong and impulsive dialogue choices while top actress Anastasia prefers more rational choices. Clarissa, meanwhile, values honesty while Sakura typically responds well to positivity and straightforward remarks.</p>
<p>Admittedly, there are times when the LIPS interactions get somewhat uncomfortable and even creepy, particularly during the more up-close, romantic interactions where you can pat the head or poke the cheeks of whichever Flower Division maiden you’re talking to. I&rsquo;ve never been the biggest fan of this aspect of Sakura Wars as I&rsquo;m not really into dating games in general. For the most part, though, the LIPS interactions are fun to deal with because they make you think. These include times when you have to accomplish tasks like investigating a scene or remembering orders over a set period of time while a timer runs on the screen. Other examples include deciding whether to speak with force by pushing the analog stick up or whisper out your comment instead by pushing it down. You definitely want to do well with the LIPS sections because picking the right answer can raise your team members’ trust level with Kamiyama. Conversely, picking the wrong answer will cause them to lose trust instead, which can bite you in the butt later on. Having high trust makes characters who fight with you perform better in battle, for example, and can even unlock hidden conversations or rewards with other characters once their trust reaches a certain level.</p>

<p>(Photo: SEGA)</p>
<p>At the same time, I wish that the characters’ backstories were a bit more fleshed out. Sakura gets most of the attention, which is understandable as she’s the main heroine. Although the motivations of the other characters are explained, however, they don’t get the same level of exposition in their backgrounds. Older games used to really delve into a character’s backstory once their individual episodes came up. In the new Sakura Wars, however, the character episodes are typically mixed in with other plot points so you don’t get the same expository detail as in past games. As a result, character development can feel a bit rushed at times.</p>
<p>Free time or free movement segments, meanwhile, also make a return, allowing you to walk around the theater as well as other destinations around Tokyo. Doing so can lead to conversations with the various characters, trigger special events or uncover pictures of the cast that are hidden in specific locations. While I like how you’re able to visit a bunch more areas instead of being limited to the theater, I wish that the segments involving these places were more fleshed out. I liked one part, for example, where you’re dressed as theater mascot Peanut and have to juggle doing advertising for the theater while also looking for a team member who you need to track down at the same time. Another interactive event I liked involved exposing and catching a thief by observing certain clues in various areas and then picking the culprit from a line of suspects. Most of the time, though, you don’t do that kind of stuff and just simply drop in an area to talk to someone and that’s it.</p>
<p>Another fan favorite that makes a return is the Koi-Koi Taisen mini-game. It was fun to be able to play Japanese hanafuda card games once again with the game’s various characters, who you have to unlock in the course of playing the game. One thing I noticed, though, is that the new Sakura Wars does not have the same number of mini-games as past entries in the series. It would have been nice if each character had their own unique game, even if they happen to be just rehashes of older mini-games that have appeared in the series before. It’s not essential but it was one of the things I typically associate with a Sakura Wars game. I do appreciate the addition of the Battle Bot simulator, however, which allows you to play battle simulations based on the new combat system while also unlocking character pictures in the process.</p>
<p>The new Sakura Wars replaces the old tactical RPG combat with real-time action.</p>
<p>(Photo: SEGA)</p>
<p>The new combat system, by the way, is one of the potentially controversial changes in Sakura Wars. In past games, every episode ends with a tactical battle that used to be done in a strategy-RPG style. Sakura Wars nixes that, however, for real-time, hack-and-slash combat instead. Some fans of the old strategy system might decry the decision. Then again, this change was likely done to make the game more appealing to a wider audience. The combat itself is like a mix of Dynasty Warriors with some Bayonetta-style bullet-time thrown in when dodging at the last second. A patch that was released prior to release day also added the ability to lock on to enemies. This is a huge help because it was a pain to keep track of enemies and also easy for your super attacks to miss prior to the lock-on patch. When facing a bunch of enemies, you can also cycle through them by moving the right analog stick left or right.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the fights can get a bit repetitive, especially when going against mobs. To make things interesting, the game adds a gauge that you can build up by performing certain actions like perfect evades and link attacks. Filling up the gauge improves your performance in battle and also affects your final grade so you want to get it as high as possible every time. On the plus side, combat becomes much more interesting when fighting stronger foes one-on-one or facing the game’s bosses. Bosses, for example, typically have a certain gimmick that you need to figure out such as destroying all parts at the same time in order to stagger it. Others, such as major antagonist Yaksha, try to overwhelm you with speed and power and you will need to master perfect evasions in order to take them down. You’re also graded during fights based on factors such as your clear time, how much damage you inflicted and the number of enemies you destroyed.</p>
<p>Add the varying combat styles of the different Flower Division members and the combat actually becomes quite fun once you get the hang of it. Kamiyama’s dual-sword melee style, for example, is intuitive to use and feels rewarding. Azami&rsquo;s quick-striking ninjutsu, on the other hand, makes it easier to time perfect evasions. Anastasia’s ranged hits, meanwhile, feel satisfying and her use of an old-school umbrella when she soars in the air is a nice added touch that looks cool to boot. Naturally, super attacks also look flashy and powerful combination attacks between the squad captain and the various Flower Division maidens also make a return.</p>

<p>(Photo: SEGA)</p>
<p>One issue I have with the combat is how combos can cause you or the enemy that you’re attacking to fall off ledges. This can get annoying because you have to wait for enemies that fall to respawn back up before you can take them down, which wastes valuable time that can affect your final grade in battle. Speaking of bosses, one of the things that this game doesn’t do quite as well as the old ones is fleshing out its rogue’s gallery. Past games gave you a sense that you’re up against a serious group of foes and made the enemies look more compelling. In this new Sakura Wars game, the major enemies feel like they’re just, well, kind of there for most of the game. The one exception is Yaksha, whose look is reminiscent of an old character from past games. Outside of her, however, the other enemies just aren’t that interesting and look and act like caricatures for the most part. The major boss mechs, meanwhile, look great but are also few in numbers. A few of them also get recycled multiple times, which takes off the sheen from fighting them once again.</p>
<p>One plus is that the game really does a great job with its presentation and visuals. The old games in the series were designed to look like a playable anime and Sakura Wars tries to do the same thing with its cel-shaded 3D models and anime-style approach, which uses character designs from Bleach artist Tite Kubo this time around. There is a bit of a disconnect between the in-game models and the anime cutscenes, however, since they look different. There are also times when you get a bit of an uncanny valley effect with character faces. The game tends to reuse assets for NPCs as well, which quickly becomes noticeable. Overall, though, I like the game’s look, which essentially modernizes the style of past games. I especially like the models for the characters and the “Spiricle” striker robots, which look fantastic.</p>
<p>Ultimately, while Sakura Wars doesn’t quite reach the lofty heights set by its predecessors, it remains a worthy attempt at not only resurrecting the long-dormant franchise but also modernizing it for a new audience. I still wish it incorporated the old characters better. But its new protagonists fit the franchise well and I found myself quickly developing an affinity for them. Series purists might also prefer the old tactical RPG approach from the first few games or the Valkyria Chronicles-style combat used by later games in the series. Although the new real-time action combat is a bit derivative, however, it’s still enjoyable once you get the hang of it.</p>

<p>Despite Sakura Wars flaws, there really are no other games like this and I’m glad to see it back once again. The new Sakura Wars feels like a Sakura Wars game, which is the best compliment that a longtime fan such as myself could give it. There really isn’t a game out there quite like it and I think the developers should be commended for releasing a game like this one despite the risk it entails, especially when compared to more popular genres. If the idea of fun interactive storytelling mixed with a nice helping of steampunk and robot hijinks sounds good to you, then Sakura Wars just might blossom into your kind of game.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.gamespew.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/One-Punch-Man-A-Hero-Nobody-Knows-2-1.jpg" alt="img">
Let me tell you a story about Chad.</p>
<p>Chad always wanted to be a hero, and so just like that he became one. On Monday, February 2nd, ‘The Knobbler’ was born. Being new to the whole hero malarkey, however, he started at the bottom. As a “C” class hero, he couldn’t take on the powerful monsters that threatened the safety of his town. Nor could he comfortably rub shoulders with the “A” and “S” class heroes. But he did what he could. He helped people around town, carrying out errands for them and dealing with small fry like purse snatchers and the like. He built up his reputation as well as his strength. Eventually, the Hero Association just had to take notice of him. And you know what, he had potential. Lots of it.</p>
<p>Chad, or should I say The Knobbler, is in the big league now. As one of the most powerful heroes around, other heroes who once shunned him now want to fight alongside him. And no longer is he simply on evacuation duty if a major threat hits his town; he’s now the one sent in to eliminate the threat. People have confidence in him. He gets the job done. Needless to say, he’s changed a lot since his humble beginnings.</p>

<p>Chad’s story can be yours in One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows. While its trailer and screenshots may have given you the impression it’s simply your standard anime fighting game, in truth, it’s more of a ‘make-your-own-hero’ action RPG.</p>
<p>After creating your new hero, One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows throws you straight into a town that serves as a hub. You can freely explore it, but you’ll find that many areas are closed off, and as such, your options are limited. Once Lecture Man has got you up to speed with the basics of the game, however, you can start taking on missions and making a name for yourself. That, alongside improving your hero rank, is key to your progress in One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows.</p>
<p>Initially, your options are limited in nearly every aspect. You’re limited as to how unique you can make your character, for example, you only have access to one fighting style and one “Killer Move”, and missions/quests are thin on the ground. But as you start being helpful, taking down monsters around the town and helping citizens, your combat abilities improve. Soon, the Hero Association will ask you directly to help with more pressing issues, many of which will open up new areas of the town for you to explore.</p>
<p>Over time, you unlock a clothing store where you can buy new threads, hairstyles, weapons, and even faces. A hero’s got to look the part, right? There’s also a bookstore where stat boosting skills can be purchased, an item shop that sells helpful consumables, and of course, your home. It’s a bit dingy when you start out, but as you start to become more famous and bring in more moolah than you could ever imagine, you can customise it so that you aren’t ashamed when your “S” class hero friends come around.</p>
<p>At the heart of your career as a hero is combat. While some quests that you take on while milling around town simply require you to carry out busywork – i.e. deliver an item to person a few streets away – others and pretty much all missions involve fisticuffs. Initially, you’ll be fighting pretty much alone. Every once in a while another hero might join your cause mid-fight, however, and as you progress further it’s rare that you’ll have to tackle a foe one-on-one. Mind you, you’ll find that monsters increasingly have backup too.</p>
<p>Combat is your typical anime affair. You have a standard attack button and a strong attack button, and they can both be held to perform more powerful charged attacks. Special moves are also available, and to access them you have to hold down the left trigger; a display then shows which Killer Move is assigned to each face button. You need to have enough charges in order to use Killer Moves, however. And of course, when you’re on defence, you can either block or evade your opponents’ attacks. Or even better still, perfectly time your block so you warp behind their backs, presenting you the perfect counterattack opportunity.</p>
<p>One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows‘ combat isn’t the best, but it gets the job done. It doesn’t feel particularly deep, though you can string together some brilliant combos if you assign the right Killer Moves. Its main problem is that enemy attacks can be a bit sporadic at times, making it hard to gauge exactly how they’re going to act. One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows also tries to spice things up by having random events occur during battles. There might be a meteor strike, or another monster in the area that decides to interfere; for the most part they add a bit of excitement, but sometimes you might be left wondering what just happened when you or your opponent’s health bar just suddenly depletes to nothing.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the core of One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows – developing a character from zero to hero – is fun. It’ll take you a while to move through the ranks; at times it might feel a bit grindy, but a steady stream of unlockables and character development opportunities keep you sucked in. Eventually, you’ll have settled on a fighting style that suits you, found a palette of Killer Moves that allow you to stylishly slay your opponents, and increased your stats so high that only the strongest of opponents can even mark a mark on you.</p>
<p>That’s not all there is to One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows though. There is the fighting game side to it as well, though you need to do a bit of legwork to access it. A trip to Hero Association HQ lets you partake in versus battles against friends, using characters you’ve unlocked by making your way through the game’s story. You can even take the action online if you wish, fighting against random opponents or inviting friends. There are even occasional events to take part in to earn goodies.</p>
<p>If you’re a fan of the anime, you’re probably wondering how Saitama, the titular One Punch Man is handled. The answer is yes, he’s invincible, and yes, he kills all opponents with simply once punch. The catch is, when playing in team battles he’ll always appear as the last member, and as always, he’s late. If your team is defeated before he arrives, that’s it; you lose. In battles where team members aren’t selected and they just appear willy-nilly, it’s the luck of the draw. If Saitama appears to fight by your side, just consider yourself lucky.</p>
<p>All in all, the only aspects that really drag One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows down in my estimation are technical issues. The voice acting, for example, isn’t the best, but I can live with that. What I can’t stand, however, is how poor the recordings sound. It’s unpleasant on your ears. Also, the town that you explore is prone to frequent performance problems, even on an Xbox One X. And on top of that, people you need to talk to to start quests etc. sometimes don’t appear, leaving you hanging while they load in. The whole One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows experience feels a little rough around the edges.</p>
<p>Even with its issues, One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows is likely to be a pleasant surprise for those who were expecting the worst, or even just a bog-standard anime brawler. It’s a single-player game at heart; a lengthy action RPG experience with multiplayer offerings serving as both a diversion and reward for your efforts. You’re never going to be amazed by it – it’s pretty by-the-numbers – but you are going to be engrossed as you turn your wimpy wannabe hero into a saviour admired by all.</p>
<p>One Punch Man: A Hero Nobody Knows is available on PS4, Xbox One and PC. We reviewed the Xbox One version.</p>
