<p>Just two days after launching a joint fundraiser to help save the Vancouver Aquarium from permanent closure during the novel coronavirus pandemic, the Vancouver Whitecaps say they‚Äôve sold over 42,000 cloth masks.</p>
<p>The soccer team partnered with the aquarium to sell the facemasks for roughly $20 each, with all the funds going to the cash-strapped tourist attraction. The masks were designed by both organizations, featuring their logos along with various designs.</p>
<p>The masks have been so popular that the aquarium‚Äôs gift shop website has crashed multiple times due to demand, including as recently as Sunday morning. (The issue was quickly resolved.)</p>
<p>AND we&rsquo;re up running again at https://t.co/PeEcqxbaHS. Get your facemasks now and help save the aquarium.</p>

<p>The aquarium was forced to shut its doors on March 17 due to COVID-19, and despite laying off more than half of its staff, still needs about $1 million per month to stay afloat.</p>
<p>Public donations have raised over half a million dollars since the aquarium warned of its financial woes, which came before the fundraiser was launched.</p>

<p>Ocean Wise CEO Lasse Gustavsson says he can‚Äôt believe how much support the aquarium has seen so far, particularly from the mask sales.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe Whitecaps CEO called me about a week ago and asked me if I wanted to do this project, and I said ‚Äòof course,'‚Äù he said Sunday.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI had no idea how popular this product was going to be.‚Äù Tweet This</p>
<p>Gustavsson said the fundraiser is not only helping the aquarium, but also helps feed the ongoing demand for personal protective equipment.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt allows people to protect themselves, but it also frees the N95 masks for the front-line workers,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>The CEO says the aquarium is still not out of the woods despite the flood of support and is continuing to call on the provincial and federal governments for financial help.</p>
<p>Health officials say that non-medical masks won‚Äôt protect individuals from COVID-19, but can help stop people who have the virus from spreading it.</p>
<p>The masks can be purchased on either the Vancouver Aquarium or the Vancouver Whitecaps websites.</p>

<h3 id="whitecaps-look-to-help-financially-troubled-vancouver-aquarium">Whitecaps look to help financially troubled Vancouver aquarium</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/whitecaps-ceo.jpg" alt="img">
VANCOUVER ‚Äî The Vancouver Whitecaps have joined forces with the Vancouver Aquarium to sell face masks with proceeds going to help keep the financially troubled aquarium afloat.</p>
<p>The aquarium, a not-for-profit operation, is closed during the pandemic and struggling to survive.</p>
<p>More than 25 Whitecap staff members are also volunteering in the rescue effort, helping reach out to aquarium members, donors, and supporters.</p>
<p>Whitecaps CEO Mark Pannes said he mobilized his club‚Äôs resources after hearing of the aquarium‚Äôs difficulties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean I‚Äôm a kid at heart, right ‚Äî and I think we all are to some degree,&rdquo; Pannes said Friday. &ldquo;And every kid loves the aquarium. And we need to embrace it and the noble work it does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I‚Äôm a kid at heart and I‚Äôm also a soccer supporter,&rdquo; said Lasse Gustavsson, president and CEO of the Ocean Wise Conservation Association which operates the aquarium. &ldquo;Normally I would support my old club, Halmstads BK in Sweden, but today I‚Äôm a Whitecaps fan for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The aquarium has been open 365 days a year since 1956 with more than 40 million visitors. It closed March 17 to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously the right thing to do from a health point of view. But by doing that, we lost 85 per cent of our revenue,&rdquo; said Gustavsson.</p>
<p>And while the door are closed, the aquarium still has to look after 70,000 animals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They all need good care. We are providing world-class animal care in the aquarium. It comes at a price,&rdquo; said Gustavsson.</p>
<p>The aquarium has had to temporarily lay off more than 60 per cent of its staff.</p>
<p>Pannes said already more than 2,500 masks have been sold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every dollar matters now,&rdquo; said Gustavsson. &ldquo;We‚Äôre months away from bankruptcy and we need $1 million at least a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The masks sport designs drawing inspiration from the Whitecaps crest and the aquarium itself.</p>
<p>The face masks are available on the websites of the Vancouver Aquarium (vanaquashop.org) and the Whitecaps (whitecapsfc.com).

<h3 id="over-70000-animals-could-be-re-homed-if-the-vancouver-aquarium-closes">Over 70,000 animals could be &lsquo;re-homed&rsquo; if the Vancouver Aquarium closes</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.glaciermedia.ca/polopoly_fs/1.24120438.1587245831!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/facebookogimage_560_292/vancouver-aquarium.jpg" alt="img">
On Wednesday, the Vancouver Aquarium announced that it may be forced to permanently close doors due to a lack of revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the organization stated that it would never allow the animals to suffer at any time.</p>
<p>As the largest aquarium in Canada, the Vancouver Aquarium houses roughly 70,000 animals. Lasse Gustavsson, Chief Executive Officer at the Vancouver Aquarium, told Vancouver Is Awesome in a phone call that the animals continue to receive proper care and attention, despite the pandemic. And, should the facility be forced to close, money has been set aside for re-homing the animals.</p>
<p>article continues below</p>
<p>With this in mind, many people are concerned about the welfare of the animals, and worry that the Aquarium may not be able to look out for the best interests of each of the thousands of animals.</p>
<p>Victoria Shroff, Animal Law Lawyer, told Vancouver Is Awesome in a phone call that animals should not be used for the entertainment of people. Specifically, she points to Helen, the senior Pacific white-sided dolphin, who is the last remaining cetacean at the Aquarium. She notes that since the organization is no longer permitted to hold cetaceans, Helen is being sent to Seaworld in Texas.</p>
<p>Last year, Canada prohibited the keeping of whales and dolphins in Captivity along with breeding said animals and exploiting them for entertainment. However, Shroff argues that Helen would likely be on public display for guests at Seaworld. Moreover, she worries that the senior dolphin may be forced to perform tricks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not certain the Vancouver Aquarium has exhausted the list of places for Helen,&rdquo; remarks Shroff. &ldquo;She used to have company in her tank at the aquarium, and she&rsquo;s been alone for the past couple of years. She needs to be with other cetaceans, but she would be better in a sanctuary where she wouldn&rsquo;t be used for entertainment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shroff is also concerned that Seaworld may try to breed the senor dolphin, and that her journey down south may take a toll on her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very concerned that they not try to breed Helen, as having dolphin offspring in captivity means they are doomed to a life in a tiny tank. I&rsquo;m also concerned with the physical transfer itself of Helen, who is middle aged,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>While Shroff notes that Helen would likely be placed with a compatible tank mate in Seaworld, she isn&rsquo;t convinced that Texas is the best place for the senior dolphin to retire. With that said, she said that Helen would likely receive more attention than some of the other animals at the Aquarium, such as individual fish. She also quesions what the Aquarium means by &ldquo;re-homing&rdquo; the animals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is re-homing different than re-locating?&rdquo; she asks. &ldquo;They need to look at the best interest of each animal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shroff adds that this is also a chance for the Aquarium to reevaluate how they operate. She wonders if they need to display animals to the public at all, or if they could reinvent the concept of the learning facility through other tools.
