<p>Updated: Apr 13, 2020 11:47 IST</p>
<p>A policeman’s hand was chopped off with a sword and six of his colleagues were injured in an attack by a group of Nihangs at a vegetable market in Punjab’s Patiala, the state police said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Assistant sub-inspector Harjit Singh’s hand was later reattached after a plastic surgery lasting seven and a half hours at Chandigarh’s PGI hospital and 11 people were arrested from a village dera over their role in the incident. Police said Rs 39 lakh in cash, two petrol bombs, spears, swords and other weapons, as well as five bags of poppy husk were recovered from them.</p>
<p>Parts of the early-morning incident captured on video by bystanders showed a group of men carrying sharp-edged weapons in an SUV driving through a police barricade and clashing with policemen armed with lathis. “Police Party on Naka duty was attacked today in which one ASI’s hand was cut off &amp; 6 were injured. Police cornered the culprits &amp; have taken them into custody. Have given instructions to the @PunjabPoliceInd to deal with anyone breaking the law in strictest possible manner,” Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh said in a tweet.</p>
<p>The Nihangs are a Sikh sect whose members live on the fringes of society and dress up as medieval warriors owing allegiance to Guru Gobind Singh, the 10th Guru, specialising in the traditional martial art of gatka (similar to the modern sport of fencing). Deras are shrines devoted to individuals deemed holy by their followers and do not enjoy the sanction of mainstream Sikh clergy.</p>
<p>The incident drew widespread condemnation across the political spectrum. Apart from CM Amarinder Singh, several senior Congress leaders said the strictest action should be taken against the culprits.</p>
<p>Opposition Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) patriarch Parkash Singh Badal condemned the incident too, while the Shiromani Panth Akali Budha Dal, the leading Nihang jathebandi (organisational assortment) said the men were not Nihangs and were, in fact, anti-social elements locally involved in extortion &ndash; a fact borne out by the recovery of Rs 39 lakh from them in cash &ndash; something the ascetic members of the sect would not do.</p>
<p>“Seven fugitives, donning the robes of Nihangs, have been arrested from the Gurdwara in village Balbera. One of these was injured in the police firing and has been rushed to hospital&hellip; The police party observed full Maryada while entering the Gurdwara premises. There were also women and children inside, who were unharmed, and have been left secure within the Gurdwara as before,” Punjab’s special chief secretary KBS Sidhu said on Twitter.</p>
<p>Gobind Singh Longowal, president of the Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), the body that manages Sikh places of worship, urged people to remain disciplined during the curfew.</p>
<p>BJP leader and Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri said, “The inhuman attack on policemen in Patiala needs to be condemned in the strongest of terms. Such criminals and anarchists should be brought to justice at the earliest.”</p>
<p>Police said the men were asked to show their curfew passes at the vegetable market, which they refused to do and instead forced their way through the barricade. When the policemen chased them and told them to step out of their vehicle, five men came out and launched an attack with swords. As six policemen received injuries and ASI Harjit Singh fell down after his hand was cut off, the men drove away to a dera building part of the Gurdwara Kichdi Sahib complex in Balbera village nearby.</p>
<p>A commando operation was launched to get the men, who refused to surrender and hurled petrol bombs at the raiding party. They set up eight LPG cylinders on the periphery, threatening to blow them up. One of the Nihangs was injured by a gunshot fired by the commandos and hospitalised later.</p>
<p>Intense negotiations spearheaded by Patiala IG Jatinder Singh Aulukh and SSP Mandeep Singh Sidhu, aided by the village sarpanch and others, could not lead the men to surrender. They were finally arrested after a fierce scuffle with the commandos.</p>
<p>The accused were booked for attempt to murder, grievous hurt, rioting, attack on a public servant under the Indian Penal Code as well as under provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. They were also booked under the stringent anti-narcotics law, NDPS, for possessing a commercial quantity of poppy husk.

<h3 id="patiala-cop-attack-who-are-the-nihangs-the-laadli-fauj-of-the-sikh-guru-and-original-akalis">Patiala Cop Attack: Who are the Nihangs, the &lsquo;Laadli Fauj&rsquo; of the Sikh Guru and Original Akalis?</h3>
<p><img src="https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2020/04/1586703954_untitled-design-23.png" alt="img">
Chandigarh: The brutal attack on an assistant sub-inspector and some others at a sabzi mandi in Patiala district by a group of men in Nihang attire shook Punjab early on Sunday.</p>
<p>The ASI’s hand was chopped off with a sword and two other policemen were injured when the Nihangs attacked them after being asked to show curfew passes at the vegetable market. Later in the day, doctors at Chandigarh&rsquo;s PGIMER successfully reattached an ASI&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>Seven people, including five attackers, were arrested hours later after an exchange of fire at a gurdwara where the group fled after the 6.15 am incident in Sanaur town.</p>
<p>Political leaders cutting across party lines condemned the incident and sought strict action against perpetrators of the crime.</p>
<p>As widespread criticism poured in, many wanted to know more about the community. Balkar Singh, a Sikh scholar, said the Nihangs came into being as ‘Laadli Fauj’ of the Guru. Guru Gobind Singh, the 10th Sikh Guru gave them the special blue attire while the sixth Guru Hargobind constituted a special army comprising the Nihangs.</p>
<p>Sunday’s incident of lawlessness can be attributed to the fact that the Nihangs do not wish to follow any order from the administration as they perhaps consider it an attack on their sovereignty, Singh said, adding, the community believes it follow orders of only the Guru and no one else.</p>
<p>Originally led by Baba Phoola Singh with their centre in Amritsar, the Nihangs were made part of Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s battalion for their fighting prowess.</p>
<p>Described as “the one who is Nirbhau (fearless)” by Guru Arjan Dev, the Nihangs still live life the traditional way. They are known for reciting the holy Jaapji Sahib Paath while performing the Gatka dance, a martial art form of the Sikhs. In Punjab, no one refuses them anything out of reverence, Balkar Singh said.</p>
<p>Nihangs were the original Akalis or followers of “Akal”, the Sikh temporal seat. They used to run the Akal Takht before the Akali Dal took over after a resolution was passed in 1925. Hence, the Nihangs are considered original Sikh Jathedars.</p>
<p>Nihangs have many thriving gurdwaras across Punjab and mostly live on vast jagirs of these gurdwaras, also known as ‘Bagchi’.</p>
<p>They are also known for consuming cannabis (they call it ‘sukha prasad’ or ‘sukh nidhan’, one that gives pleasure) during meditation. Though marriage is not prohibited among the Nihangs, most of them remain single and dedicate their lives to the faith, said Balkar Singh.</p>
<p>“In spirit, they are considered the purest of the pure, because they are associated with the Sikh Guru, so they follow the Guru’s orders only. The true ‘panthic’ or followers of the Sikh Panth, the Nihangs practise the ‘rehat maryada’ after ‘amrit chhakna’ (Sikh baptism). The martial arts of the Sikhs like Gatka, horse riding are practised by them even today and are on display during Hola Mohala festival,” Balkar Singh said.</p>
<p>“In practice, they live like ‘Chalde Vaheer’ (always travellin). In earlier times, this used to be on horses. Now, they have switched to swanky cars.</p>
<p>“Also, the chain of public schools of the Budha Dal, a section among Nihangs started by Baba Santa Singh, is considered the most modern ones in Punjab. They have set up these schools in Patiala, Mohali and Samana,” Singh said.</p>
