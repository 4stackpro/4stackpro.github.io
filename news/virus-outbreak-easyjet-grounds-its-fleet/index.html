Virus Outbreak: EasyJet grounds its fleet</p>
<p>Bloomberg</p>
<p>EasyJet PLC yesterday grounded its entire fleet after completing customer-repatriation flights, and said it is in talks to build a cash cushion to see it through the gap in business caused by the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The restart scheduled flights would depend on government restrictions as well as demand, the UK discount carrier said.</p>
<p>Airlines across the globe have been shocked into survival mode by the coronavirus, which has caused an abrupt halt in travel as countries cut off access to fight the disease.</p>

<p>EasyJet too has been parking planes and idling staff to conserve cash, while operating a handful of repatriation flights.</p>
<p>Irish rival Ryanair Holdings PLC last week said it planned to ground more than 90 percent of its fleet in coming weeks.</p>
<p>EasyJet said it completed repatriation flights on Sunday.</p>
<p>Cabin crew would get 80 percent of their pay under a government program, and the company, based in Luton outside of London, is looking for ways to increase its access to cash.</p>
<p>The carrier said it has a strong balance sheet and no maturities until 2022.</p>
<p>“We are in ongoing discussions with liquidity providers who recognize our strength of balance sheet and business model,” EasyJet said in a statement.</p>
<p>Airlines worldwide could take a US$252 billion hit to revenue this year from the pandemic, the International Air Transport Association said last week, warning of a pending liquidity crunch.</p>
<p>The industry group urged governments to take “massive action” to keep the industry functioning.</p>
<p>EasyJet, whose debt is rated at “BBB” by S&amp;P, has about ￡1.6 billion (US$2 billion) of cash and US$500 million of undrawn and committed credit facility, which expires next year, S&amp;P Global said in a report on March 20.</p>
<p>The carrier has about ￡250 million to ￡300 million in lease payments due every year, S&amp;P said.</p>
<p>While the UK has ruled out a broad bailout for the aviation industry, it has created a ￡330 billion program for state-guaranteed loans, which is open to companies with investment-grade credit ratings.</p>
<p>EasyJet could also potentially raise cash with a sale-and-leaseback transaction to finance its fleet of Airbus SE A320 family jets, which S&amp;P estimates is worth more than ￡4 billion.</p>
<p>EasyJet separately is under pressure from its founder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who has urged the carrier for years to halt its expansion.</p>
<p>He has threatened to remove the board if it does not cancel an order for more than 100 Airbus planes, Sky News reported.</p>
<p>The carrier is working with its suppliers to defer and reduce payments, where possible, including on aircraft expenditure, it said in a separate statement in response to the interview.

<p>A British holiday rep has claimed EasyJet has ‘abandoned’ her and her heavily pregnant friend amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Alana Swadkins, 27, is worried she will not get back to her home in Birmingham for months after her flight to Manchester on April 3 was cancelled.</p>
<p>The Tui rep flew out to Dalamanon on March 10 for a holiday with her friend Natalie, who is 31 weeks pregnant.</p>
<p>But as the global Covid-19 situation worsened just two weeks into her trip she attempted to contact the airline to find out if they would need to change their £90 flights.</p>
<p>Alana Swadkins claims EasyJet has abandoned her (Credits: BPM Media)</p>
<p>Alana claims a customer service representative assured her the flight would stand as it was leaving the country and not entering.</p>
<p>Alana said: ‘They explained if there was change they would contact us immediately and we could either get a refund or a repatriation flight would be on instead.</p>

<p>‘Because I work for Tui, I was aware that they had a repatriation flight on Monday, March 23, that I could have boarded but they once again explained there was no need to worry.’</p>

<p>Alana said she got worried after hearing rumours repatriation flights were stopping so tried contacting EasyJet again.</p>
<p>She added: ‘There is no communication from them whatsoever about what’s happening – yet they have taken our money and still allowing others to book on to our flights.</p>
<p>‘We don’t know when we will be able to get home or how long we will be stuck here.</p>
<p>‘My friend, Natalie, is also 31 weeks pregnant and she will go over</p>
<p>the safe-to-fly requirement the longer we are here – it is not ideal.</p>
<p>‘We really are struggling to think of any other way for us to get back.’</p>
<p>The Tui rep fears it could be months before she gets back to her home in Northfield, Birmingham (Picture: BPM)</p>
<p>The pair are only on a 90-day visa and cannot apply for a longer-stay permit due to the lockdown in the country.</p>
<p>Easyjet said due to the Covid-19 outbreak it was not operating any rescue flights to or from Turkey.</p>
<p>A spokesman said: “We’re sorry to hear of these passengers’ experience.</p>
<p>‘Due to ongoing restrictions that continue to be implemented by authorities as a result of Covid-19, we are currently not operating any rescue flights to or from Turkey however we remain in contact with the UK government and have offered to operate repatriation flights where needed.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>‘Where we have been required to cancel flights as a result of travel restrictions, we have been committed to getting customers home as quickly as possible and so we have worked hard to operate a programme of more than 600 rescue flights so far, bringing over 45,000 customers home since travel restrictions have been implemented.</p>
<p>‘We advise anyone who did not book on to the available rescue flights and wants to travel at this time to contact their local embassy for further guidance.’</p>
<p>As of Friday, the number of coronavirus-related deaths in Turkey had risen to 92, while total cases reached 5,698.</p>
<p>Earlier this week the Foreign and Commonwealth Office urged British citizens to return home as soon as possible, but in many cases flights had already been cancelled and borders had been closed.</p>

AN emotional video from one of easyJet&rsquo;s last flights showed crew thanking passengers and asking them to &ldquo;stick together and get through this&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The video was filmed on the last repatriation flight from Tenerife by passenger Chris Chibbett.</p>
<p>⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news &amp; updates</p>
<p>EasyJet crew asked passengers to &ldquo;stick together&rdquo; in an emotional video from one of the last flights</p>
<p>Only a few passengers were on board the plane as it returned to the UK.</p>
<p>A member of the crew spoke over the tannoy shortly before the plane landed.</p>
<p>They said in the video, posted on Twitter: &ldquo;From all of us, please show your appreciation in any way you can.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you so much and we will all get through this on the other side in a much better shape, as best as we can.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know we are all trying our best and the lockdown is hard - we&rsquo;ve all been at home for a week ourselves, and you guys know what it&rsquo;s like being in Tenerife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will all stick together and get through this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passengers gave the crew a round of applause following the announcement</p>
<p>He joked &ldquo;that&rsquo;s my pep talk for the day&rdquo; before adding: &ldquo;From behalf of all of us, thank you so much for flying with easyJet, and we will see you in the future, hopefully not too distant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please stay safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speech was then met by a round of applause by everyone on the aircraft.</p>
<p>EasyJet has grounded its entire fleet of aircraft due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Staff are currently being given a two-month leave of absence, meaning the measures will last at least until June.</p>
