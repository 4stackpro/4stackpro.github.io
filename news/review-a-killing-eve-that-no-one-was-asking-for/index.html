“Give me back my beast.”</p>
<p>That was Greta Garbo’s famous (perhaps apocryphal) plea after she saw Jean Cocteau’s “Beauty and the Beast.” It echoed in my head as I watched the new season of “Killing Eve”: Give us back our beast. Give us back our Villanelle.</p>
<p>It was remarkable when the second season of “Killing Eve,” the dark and delightful comedy about a spy, an assassin and their mutual obsession, was as good as the first. Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the original showrunner and head writer, had turned over those duties to Emerald Fennell, and the writers of Season 2’s eight episodes were entirely new. But the electric, erotic, sardonic architecture remained intact; the souffle didn’t collapse.</p>
<p>For Season 3, which premieres Sunday on BBC America and AMC, the show has changed up its staff again, replacing Fennell with Suzanne Heathcote, a writer on AMC’s “Fear the Walking Dead,” and using all new writers and directors (through the five episodes available for review). And this time the news isn’t so good.</p>
<p>“Killing Eve” isn’t a bad show now, but it’s a different show, in depressing ways — less vital, more ordinary. It is still shocking here and there but largely devoid of surprise. A mordant and sexy comic thriller edged with terror has become a competent psychodrama bordered with sentimentality. The air has gone out of it.

<h3 id="killing-eve-third-season-divides-critics">Killing Eve: Third season divides critics</h3>
<p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/184A1/production/_111698499_19957715-high_res-killing-eve-series-3.jpg" alt="img">
Image caption Jodie Comer won a Bafta TV award last year for her portrayal of Villanelle</p>
<p>The critics are in two minds about the latest series of Killing Eve ahead of its return this weekend.</p>
<p>For every review calling it &ldquo;heart-stoppingly brilliant&rdquo;, there is another dismissing it as &ldquo;tired to the point of lifelessness&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Metro&rsquo;s Tilly Pearce says the darkly comic thriller is &ldquo;as hilarious, gripping and extra as ever&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But Anita Singh of The Telegraph says &ldquo;the novelty has worn off&rdquo; and that it is &ldquo;no longer TV&rsquo;s must-watch&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Viewers can make up their own minds when the third season begins in the US on Sunday.</p>
<p>The first episode will be made available on BBC iPlayer on Monday morning ahead of a BBC One airing on 19 April.</p>
<p>Unlike previous seasons, the third series will not immediately be put online in its entirety.</p>
<p>Instead, episodes will be released each Monday on a week-by-week basis.</p>
<p>Image caption Sandra Oh reprises her role as Eve for the third season</p>
<p>The following reviews contain some plot details of Killing Eve&rsquo;s third season.</p>
<p>Based on Luke Jennings&rsquo; Codename Villanelle novellas, Killing Eve tells of a sultry professional assassin and a dogged MI6 operative on her trail.</p>
<p>The second season climaxed with Villanelle (Jodie Comer) apparently shooting Eve (Sandra Oh) in Rome.</p>
<p>The third season begins with Eve in a thankless new job, having survived Villanelle&rsquo;s attempt on her life.</p>
<p>Before long, however, a shocking death once again sets them on a collision course.</p>
<p>According to the Mirror&rsquo;s Sara Wallis, the new season is &ldquo;fresh, funny and as fashion-conscious as ever&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Under new head writer Suzanne Heathcote, she continues, the show contains &ldquo;plenty of shocking deaths, new characters and jaw-dropping, creative murders&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Yet the Independent&rsquo;s Ed Cumming is less impressed, saying the show &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t have much left to offer&rdquo; beyond Comer&rsquo;s &ldquo;watchable&rdquo; performance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once fresh and thrilling, Killing Eve has grown stale and predictable,&rdquo; he writes in his two-star review.</p>
<p>TV Guide&rsquo;s Kaitlin Thomas, meanwhile, says the show &ldquo;now feels like a copy of its former self&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lack of creative dialogue and minor flourishes emphasises Season 3&rsquo;s familiarity and repetitiveness,&rdquo; writes IndieWire&rsquo;s Ben Travers.</p>
<p>Flora Carr of the Radio Times believes the first episode of the third season &ldquo;suffers in comparison to the heights of season one&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Yet she remains &ldquo;hopeful&rdquo; that Heathcote &ldquo;spreads the fun a little more evenly&rdquo; in the instalments to follow.</p>
<p>The Herald&rsquo;s Alison Rowat is also optimistic, believing Heathcote will fill the &ldquo;tall heels&rdquo; of her predecessors Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Emerald Fennell.</p>
<p>Den of Geek&rsquo;s Delia Harrington, meanwhile, is happy to report that the show&rsquo;s &ldquo;eerie, off-kilter humour remains in place&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Dame Harriet Walter, Steve Pemberton and Gemma Whelan are among the new cast members joining series regulars Comer, Oh and Fiona Shaw.</p>
<p>A fourth series has already been commissioned, with Sex Education&rsquo;s Laura Neal taking over as lead writer.</p>
<p>Killing Eve is one of BBC iPlayer&rsquo;s most popular shows, with nearly 110 million requests lodged to view the first two series.</p>
<p>Oh won a Golden Globe for her role last year, while both Comer and Shaw were honoured at 2019&rsquo;s Bafta TV Awards.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.insider.com/5e90d42fc0232074c956d8d3?width=1200&amp;format=jpeg" alt="img">
&ldquo;Killing Eve&rdquo; returns to BBC America and AMC to kick off its third season on Sunday at 9 p.m.</p>
<p>The series is unique in that it changes its showrunner each season to give a new female voice a chance to lead the show.</p>
<p>New showrunner Suzanne Heathcote speaks with Insider about taking over the series from Emerald Fennell and Phoebe Waller-Bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rare role for a woman,&rdquo; Heathcote told Insider. &ldquo;Especially five years ago, there weren&rsquo;t that many women showrunning, period, or having any kind of lead writing experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Women account for 25% of all TV creators and 31% of those in a key behind-the-scenes role on TV, according to a 2019 report from the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Killing Eve&rdquo; returns to TV Sunday for its third season. The Emmy-winning series starring Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer will also have its third showrunner in Suzanne Heathcote.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s by design.</p>
<p>Each season of the BBC America spy drama passes the role of lead writer and executive producer to a new woman in order to give a voice to a female writer.</p>
<p>Heathcote, who has previously written for &ldquo;Fear the Walking Dead,&rdquo; follows in the footsteps of season two showrunner Emerald Fennell (&ldquo;The Crown&rdquo;) and series creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge (&ldquo;Fleabag&rdquo;). After Heathcote&rsquo;s run on season three, &ldquo;Sex Education&rdquo; writer Laura Neal will take over for the show&rsquo;s confirmed fourth season.</p>
<p>Season three will pick up with Eve (Oh) and Villanelle (Comer) months after the season two finale when Eve was left for dead in Rome. Both women attempt to move their lives forward, but inevitably will find themselves drawn back into a dangerous game of cat and mouse that has dominated the series.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was so exciting coming into this season,&rdquo; Heathcote told Insider of what it means to take over the thriller. &ldquo;I mean, it&rsquo;s always going to feel like a challenge, any season three. I&rsquo;ve written on season three of shows before, and everything has its own challenge. So you enter with that, but you just have to see it as an exciting challenge and how can we do new things with these characters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heathcote started her career as a playwright. General Manager/YouTube</p>
<p>The unique tradition of the BBC America series has created a sort of sisterhood between the showrunners.</p>
<p>While Fennell and Waller-Bridge&rsquo;s seasons are over, Heathcote says the two still make themselves available, lending an ear to the creative process as needed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was very lucky with both Phoebe and Emerald. They were both incredibly supportive,&rdquo; said Heathcote. &ldquo;I spoke to Phoebe a lot, and she read the scripts, and she was amazing. We just spoke the other day, actually. She&rsquo;s been a fantastic resource. And Emerald was just amazing; she gave great advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phoebe Waller-Bridge created both &ldquo;Killing Eve&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fleabag.&rdquo; Here, she&rsquo;s seen at the 77th annual Golden Globe Awards on Sunday, Jan. 5, 2020. Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP Emerald Fennell is seen behind-the-scenes of the season two premiere of &ldquo;Killing Eve&rdquo; with director Damon Thomas. Aimee Spinks/BBCAmerica</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a job unlike any other that you will have had or are ever going to have again. And so to have two people who&rsquo;ve already done it and kind of speak to their experience is invaluable,&rdquo; Heathcote added of what it has meant to have the previous &ldquo;Killing Eve&rdquo; lead writers available.</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s not uncommon for TV series to swap out showrunners, it&rsquo;s usually because of behind-the-scenes drama (see &ldquo;FBI&rdquo; and &ldquo;BH90210&rdquo;) or, in the case of long-running series, a creator may want to move onto other projects (&ldquo;Superstore,&rdquo; &ldquo;CSI&rdquo;).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Killing Eve,&rdquo; meanwhile, has made it a point to purposefully change the leadership of the series each season to highlight talent.</p>
<p>Eve&rsquo;s lifestyle is very different when we catch up with her on the season three premiere. Laura Radford/BBCA</p>
<p>The series is in a unique position not only because it changes out its lead writers, but because it only passes the baton off to other female writers.</p>
<p>Yes, there are shows, past and present, led by female showrunners. The list includes &ldquo;Gilmore Girls,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jessica Jones,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fresh Off the Boat,&rdquo; &ldquo;Orange is the New Black,&rdquo; &ldquo;Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy,&rdquo; &ldquo;Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,&rdquo; &ldquo;Transparent,&rdquo; and the past two seasons of &ldquo;The Walking Dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the role of showrunner is one that&rsquo;s still predominately filled by men in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Angela Kang took over AMC&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Walking Dead&rdquo; at a critical point on season nine and has helped make it a beloved series among fans again late into its run on television. It&rsquo;s still one of the biggest shows on cable TV. Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images for ReedPOP</p>
<p>80% of showrunners on TV are male, according to a 2016 Variety article. Similarly, a 2016 USC Annenberg study, looking at 487 series creators, found only 22.6% to be female. The same study found that of 6,421 writers, 71.1% were male.</p>
<p>The number has increased slowly over the past few years.</p>
<p>Women represented 31% of the individuals working in a key behind-the-scenes position on TV in 2018-2019, according to a September 2019 report from the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film on women on screen and behind the scenes in TV.</p>
<p>Shonda Rhimes has been responsible for ABC favorites like &ldquo;HTGAWM&rdquo; and &ldquo;Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy.&rdquo; Nahnatchka Khan oversaw the network&rsquo;s comedy &ldquo;Fresh Off the Boat,&rdquo; and Rachel Bloom starred in and led the CW&rsquo;s cult hit &ldquo;Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.&rdquo; Getty Images/Leon Bennett, Mark Von Holden/Invision/AP, The CW</p>
<p>These positions include director, creator, writer, executive producer, producer, editor, and director of photography. In the same time frame, women accounted for 25% of all TV creators, up from 22% in the 2014 to 2015 television year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s given an opportunity, an incredible opportunity, to so many different women and women who are&hellip; we&rsquo;ve all been sort of at similar stages in our careers really,&rdquo; Heathcote said when asked what she thinks of the unique tradition of the &ldquo;Killing Eve&rdquo; team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s such an incredible opportunity to be given. And I just actually think it&rsquo;s amazing that so many of us have just had the chance given to us, really,&rdquo; Heathcote continued. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rare role for a woman. Especially five years ago, there weren&rsquo;t that many women showrunning, period, or having any kind of lead writing experience. So, to have one show give so many women that experience, I think, is amazing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Season three of &ldquo;Killing Eve&rdquo; premieres Sunday at 9 p.m. simultaneously on both AMC and BBC America.
