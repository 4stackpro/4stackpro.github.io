<p>The Maharashtra Cyber department on Sunday night issued an advisory cautioning people against sharing pictures of deceased actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s body, warning of legal action.</p>
<p>Disturbing pictures of Rajput’s mortal remains surfaced on WhatsApp mere hours after his demise. Within a short while, they made their way onto WhatsApp groups and other platforms like Twitter.</p>
<p>Several social media users expressed shock and outrage at those sharing the pictures just to gain visibility online.</p>
<p>Late on Sunday, the Cyber department tweeted, “A disturbing trend has been observed on Social Media platforms by Maharashtra Cyber that pictures of deceased actor Shri. Sushant Singh Rajput are being circulated, which are disturbing and in bad taste. It is emphasised that circulation of such pictures is against legal guidelines and court directions, and are liable to invite legal action. Maharashtra Cyber exhorts and directs all netizens to refrain from circulating the aforesaid pictures. The pictures already circulated should be deleted henceforth. (sic)”</p>
<p>Officials said with a medium like WhatsApp, tracing the original source of the pictures would be next to impossible. They said all social media platforms are being watched so action can be taken against anyone found sharing the pictures.

The curse of suicide has haunted the showbiz since time immemorial with the likes of iconic actor-director Guru Dutt, South star Shoba, Silk Smitha, actor Jiah Khan and now Bollywood star Sushant Singh Rajput giving up on life in the Indian film industry known for being harsh and demanding of its stars.</p>
<p>Known for films like &ldquo;Kai Po Che!&quot;, &ldquo;MS Dhoni: The Untold Story&rdquo;, &ldquo;Chhichhore&rdquo;, Rajput was found hanging at his Bandra home, the police said on Sunday. He was 34.</p>

<p>Rajput&rsquo;s last screen appearance was Nitesh Tiwari&rsquo;s 2019 film Chhichhore. And his last social media post, dedicated to his late mother who died in 2002 when he was a young teen, was on June 3, a foretelling perhaps on what to come.</p>
<p>Rajput&rsquo;s sudden death comes days after his former manager, 28-year-old Disha Salian, ended her life by jumping from a high rise building on June 9.</p>
<p>Guru Dutt, known for black-and-white classics like &ldquo;Kaagaz Ke Phool&rdquo;, &ldquo;Baazi&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Pyaasa&rdquo;, was found dead on October 10, 1964 in his bed in his rented apartment at Pedder Road in erstwhile Bombay. He was 39. The filmmaker, whose real name was Vasanth Kumar Shivashankar Padukone, was said to have been mixing alcohol and sleeping pills.</p>
<p>Dutt&rsquo;s death may have been suicide or just an accidental overdose. His son, Arun Dutt, considered the death to be an accident.</p>
<p>Guru Dutt</p>
<p>South star Mahalakshmi Menon, best known by her stagename Shoba committed suicide at the age of 17. She got herself a National Award for Best Actress for the film Pasi and on May 1, 1980, she was found to have killed herself in her house in Chennai, then Madras. The manner of Shoba’s death, however, still remains cloaked in mystery.</p>
<p>Four years after Shoba died, her mother Prema who was also an actress too killed herself. KG George&rsquo;s 1983 film Lekhayude Maranam – Oru Flashback is said to be loosely based on her life.</p>
<p>Actor Vijaylakshmi, who reached the iconic status of a sex symbol in Tamil cinema during her time, as Silk Smitha died at the age of 33 as the result of a suspected suicide in 1996. She appeared in over 200 films, including &ldquo;Vandichakkaram&rdquo;, &ldquo;Moondru Mugam&rdquo;, a most sought after actor at a time was said to be neck deep in controversies.</p>
<p>Silk Smitha</p>
<p>She was immortalised on screen in the 2011 film &ldquo;The Dirty Picture&rdquo;, starring Vidya Balan as Silk. The Milan Luthria-directed film, which showed the highs and lows of the dancing star, was inspired by the actor&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Former Miss India and video jockey Nafisa Joseph was found hanging at her residence in Versova in 2004 at the age of 25.</p>
<p>Joseph, who won the Miss India title in 1997, had worked as a model and had been involved in activities related to animal rights.</p>
<p>In 2006, model-turned television actor Kuljeet Randhawa, known for starring in high-school drama &ldquo;Hip Hip Hurray!&quot;, suspense serial &ldquo;Kohinoor&rdquo; and crime thriller drama &ldquo;Special Squad&rdquo;, allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself in her single room apartment in suburban Juhu. She was 25.</p>
<p>Kunal Singh, best known for starring opposite actor Sonali Bendre in the 1999 Tamil romance film &ldquo;Kadhalar Dhinam&rdquo;, was found hanging from the ceiling fan in his Mumbai apartment in 2008. He was 30.</p>
<p>Jiah Khan</p>
<p>British-American actor Jiah Khan, best known for films like &ldquo;Nishabd&rdquo; with megastar Amitabh Bachchan and &ldquo;Ghajini&rdquo; with Aamir Khan, was found hanging at her Mumbai residence on June 3, 2013 by her mother Rabiya Khan. Khan was 25.</p>
<p>It was deemed a suicide and reconfirmed as a suicide in 2016 following an extensive investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and a hearing at the Bombay High Court.</p>
<p>Khan&rsquo;s mother blamed her boyfriend, actor Sooraj Pancholi, for her death. He was charged with abetting Khan&rsquo;s suicide. The case has not yet been settled.</p>
<p>Last year, actor Kushal Punjabi, who appeared in films such as &ldquo;Kaal&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lakshya&rdquo; as well as the reality show &ldquo;Fear Factor&rdquo;, was found hanging in his Bandra apartment. He was 42.</p>
<p>Punjabi, whose body was found by his parents in the wee hours of December 27, left behind a suicide note in which he said nobody should be held responsible for his death.
