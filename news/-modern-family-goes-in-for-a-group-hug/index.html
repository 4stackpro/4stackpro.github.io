LLOYD I don’t think it’s too often that you have actors feeling the same things the characters they portray are feeling. But this was the apotheosis of that because we had everybody feeling a tremendous sadness about walking away from this family we created, and the characters were doing exactly the same thing. So there was a lot of very real emotion coming from our actors.</p>
<p>LEVITAN Through the years, we always knew how lucky we were: the way the show came together, the accolades, the success and the fact that we had a really happy set. Feeling it come to an end was a sad notion for us, but at the same time, I can’t complain for one second. It was a dream run, and to protect the legacy of the show, it was time to let it go.</p>
<p>Do you feel the finale has a different resonance now than when you shot it, before the coronavirus crisis had started to have a widespread impact on Americans? [The series finished filming on Feb. 21.]</p>
<p>LEVITAN The most glaring thing is that giant group hug. That’s not something you see in real life these days, so it feels like we shot that 20 years ago. But I can’t tell you how many times through the years people have thanked us because we helped them through a tough time, be it a death, a divorce, an illness or losing a job. I love the idea that during this dark time in the world’s history, hopefully our finale can provide people with a little respite.</p>
<p>LLOYD In one way, it’s nice that people will be home and may be inclined to watch the show with their families one last time. People are reacquainting themselves with their families, good and bad, and may be clinging to them more than they have in the past. That’s certainly a theme of the finale, so I think there’s a resonance.</p>
<p>Would you say Jay’s evolution as a character — he now embraces both Mitchell and Cameron as his sons, and he’s learning Spanish so he can converse with Gloria — reflects some cultural changes that have happened in America since the show started?

Why Sarah Hyland was disappointed in her Modern Family ending</p>
<p>On April 8, 2020, Modern Family, ABC&rsquo;s hit documentary-style sitcom, came to an end after a hugely popular 11-season run — sure to trigger an outpouring of emotion from both the people behind the show and the fans alike in the ensuing days. The final season had viewers hooked on finding out what would be the ultimate fate of their favorite family members, but there&rsquo;s one person who&rsquo;s not entirely thrilled with the way things shook out: actress Sarah Hyland, who plays Haley Dunphy.</p>
<p>In an interview with Cosmopolitan, published on April 2 shortly before the series finale, Hyland expressed some disappointment with the conclusion of her character&rsquo;s arc, especially given some of the other potential paths with which Modern Family had set her up. Rather than being focused entirely on parenting twin babies, as Haley had been throughout season 11, Hyland said she would prefer to see her character &ldquo;own her badassery in the fashion world — becoming a badass stylist or brand mogul or anything like that.&rdquo; Not that Hyland sees anything wrong with motherhood; she added, &ldquo;There are so many amazing mothers who are also hard workers and excel at their jobs and kill it every day in both aspects. That would have been a really cool thing to see, especially from someone like Haley.&rdquo;

<p><img src="https://media.popculture.com/2020/01/modern-family-getty-20079158-640x320.jpeg" alt="img">
Modern Family aired its series finale on Wednesday night, and the episode featured a surprise cameo from a mega star that had fans flipping out. While saying goodbye to the beloved cast, viewers got to see actress Elizabeth Banks as Sal one last time. Banks first turned up as the hard-partying friend of Cameron and Mitchell in Season 1, going on to appear in a total of eight episodes, including the two-part finale.</p>
<p>Taking to Twitter, Banks shared a clip from one of her guest starring appearances on Modern Family. She also spoke out about the show&rsquo;s &ldquo;bittersweet&rdquo; ending, explaining that she is not just a recurring character, but also a fan herself. She also sent out a special thank you to her on-screen friends &ldquo;for always&rdquo; being there for Sal. The post has since garnered a lot of replies, with Jesse Tyler Ferguson (Mitchell) tweeting back, &ldquo;You should have won an Emmy for this scene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We love Sal! Thanks for being a part of our #ModernFamily! 😍🧡 — Modern Family (@ModernFam) April 8, 2020</p>
<p>Many fans of the show who were excited to see Sal return have also commented on Banks&rsquo; post. &ldquo;Sal is ace!!&rdquo; one fan exclaimed, then suggesting, &ldquo;Sal and Pepper spin off anyone??&rdquo; Scroll down to see more reactions to Banks&rsquo; big finale cameo!
