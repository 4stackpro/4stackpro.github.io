<p>ALL 1,350 McDonald&rsquo;s stores in the UK remain closed due to the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>But fans have been offered a ray of hope after reports emerged that it is looking to reopen for drive-thru and delivery orders. Here&rsquo;s everything you need to know about McDonald&rsquo;s reopening.</p>
<p>⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news &amp; updates</p>
<p>1 There is no end in sight to the McDonald&rsquo;s closure and the fast food chain has denied rumours it was reopening from April 6. Credit: PA:Press Association</p>
<p>When did McDonald&rsquo;s close?</p>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s shut its doors on Monday, March 23, at 7pm.</p>
<p>The fast food company said all of its 1,350 stores in UK and Ireland would remain closed in a bid to prevent further spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p>McDonald&rsquo;s - who have around 135,000 employees on their books - had initially remained open when Boris Johnson introduced social distancing measures.</p>
<p>They stopped customers eating inside restaurants but still allowed takeaways, McDelivery orders and drive through service.</p>
<p>However, in order to protect staff, the decision was eventually made to close fully.</p>

<p>McDonald&rsquo;s said: &ldquo;This is not a decision we are taking lightly, but one made with the well-being and safety of our employees in mind as well as in the best interests of our customers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will work with local community groups to responsibly distribute food and drink from our restaurants in the coming days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lots of people getting in touch about a certain post circulating tonight. It’s fake, we are not reopening next week and any official announcements would come from this page and would spell the brand name correctly… — McDonald&rsquo;s UK (@McDonaldsUK) April 1, 2020</p>
<p>When will McDonald&rsquo;s open again?</p>
<p>It is currently unknown when McDonald&rsquo;s will open its doors again, with coronavirus continuing to spread around UK and Ireland.</p>
<p>In their statement, McDonald&rsquo;s said: &ldquo;We look forward to seeing you all again as soon as it is safe for us to reopen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The burger chain, is unlikely to open until the UK lockdown is over with this set to last until at least May 7.</p>
<p>But, they&rsquo;ve urged customers to keep an eye on their social media channels where they will be looking for input on the menu.</p>
<p>On April 1, the fast food favourite took to Twitter to deny rumours it was reopening next week.</p>
<p>In a tweet from its official UK Twitter account, it said: &ldquo;Lots of people getting in touch about a certain post circulating tonight. It’s fake, we are not reopening next week and any official announcements would come from this page and would spell the brand name correctly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet, other fast food chains have opened their doors up again, with KFC and Burger King operating from a limited number of stores for delivery.</p>
<p>However, according to reports the fast food behemoth will reopen for both delivery and drive-thru orders in the middle of May.</p>
<p>The Irish Farmers Journal reported that the chain is working on plans to open up next month.</p>
<p>A spokesperson confirmed that McDonald&rsquo;s was planning to reopen, but added that a date is yet to be agreed.</p>

<p>Are any McDonald&rsquo;s restaurants still open?</p>
<p>Yes, but sadly not in the UK.</p>
<p>Most McDonald&rsquo;s restaurants remain open in the US and all are open in Australia where they are only allowing takeaway, drive through and delivery services.</p>
<p>In Australia, McDonald&rsquo;s is also offering customers the ability to buy bread and milk at the drive-through as supermarkets continue to be overwhelmed during the coronavirus lockdown.</p>
<p>In the US some restaurant dine-in areas are closed and they are also urging customers to follow social distancing rules and use delivery and drive through services instead.</p>
<p>Some particularly committed McDonald&rsquo;s fans in the UK have resorted to making their own versions of the fast food chain&rsquo;s menu at home.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, France began to reopen their McDonald&rsquo;s restaurants - leading to eager customers queuing for THREE HOURS to order in their Drive Thru.

<h3 id="local-mcdonalds-showing-love-to-healthcare-workers-with-free-meals">Local McDonald&rsquo;s showing love to healthcare workers with free meals</h3>
<p><img src="https://media.graytvinc.com/images/McDonalds10.jpg" alt="img">
A fast-food giant is looking to show some love to our healthcare professionals and first responders who are at the frontlines of the coronavirus crisis by offering them a literal happy meal.</p>
<p>As the coronavirus pandemic continues to rages on, McDonald’s is looking to give back to those who are working endlessly to fight the virus.</p>
<p>Starting from now until May 5th, healthcare workers of all kinds can get their hands on some free food as part of the restaurant&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thank You Meals for First Responders&rdquo; promotion.</p>
<p>Police officers, firefighters, and paramedics can get a free meal each day for the next two weeks at any time at the drive-thru or carry out.</p>
<p>Here at home, local McDonald&rsquo;s franchise owner Mike Marasco wants to help our first responders feel appreciated.</p>
<p>Marasco says “We are blessed to be able to stay open and continue to provide meals to the community and provide jobs to our employees. And the first responders are the ones fighting the fight for us, and we are kind of in the support business that can help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the morning they have a choice of three different breakfast meals and in the evening hours, they can get a double cheeseburger, nuggets, or fish filet.</p>
<p>All they have to show a work badge or be in uniform.</p>
<p>The company said in a news release the meals will be served in a Happy Meal box &ldquo;In hopes of bringing a smile along with delicious food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It’s just one of the many ways, McDonald’s is looking to say thank you.</p>
<p>Marasco says &ldquo;Doctors, nurses, police fire, thank you for what you guys are doing, we are also partnering with Border Patrol, customs and sheriff&rsquo;s office, thank you for what you do to keep our community safe.”</p>
<p>And Marasco says many professionals are loving it!</p>
<p>McDonald’s has been working to support thousands of local communities during these challenging times from supporting Ronald McDonald House Charity to donating N95 masks to areas in need.
