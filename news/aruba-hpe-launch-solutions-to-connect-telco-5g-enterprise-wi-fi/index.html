Aruba and Hewlett Packard Enterprise are helping enterprises harness both 5G and Wi-Fi 6 technologies for the most seamless and easy connections, with less management for IT.</p>
<p>Aruba on Tuesday launched a new roaming service called Aruba Air Pass that lets cellular users securely and automatically connect onto Aruba enterprise Wi-Fi networks. The service, which provides a hand-off between cellular and Wi-Fi networks, will let telecom providers extend 5G into the enterprise for seamless Wi-Fi calling, said Larry Lunetta, Aruba’s vice president of WLAN and security solutions marketing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Telcos have done a great job of evangelizing 5G, but there&rsquo;s also a lot of confusion what the role of 5G will be short-term and long-term,&rdquo; Lunetta said. &ldquo;But the concept that Wi-Fi 6 can be an on-ramp to whatever 5G materializes is very attractive to partners and enterprises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Related: Aruba Bests Cisco, Juniper Networks: Gartner Critical Capabilities Report 2019]</p>
<p>Aruba Air Pass helps users avoid quality of service issues and keeps all traffic secure. The service is built on Passpoint, a standard created by the Wi-Fi Alliance that lets mobile devices automatically authenticate on enterprise Wi-Fi networks using their cellular credentials. Air Pass is also used with Aruba Air Slice, a technology Aruba introduced in October that improves radio performance that Aruba also unveiled on Tuesday, Lunetta said.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi 6 technology will likely be the dominate radio access network to supply 5G services, Lunetta said. Using Air Slice, Aruba is extending Wi-Fi 6 to give enterprises a performance guarantee for specific applications, such as IoT and videoconferencing.</p>
<p>Enterprises want to be able to use multiple connectivity technologies, but they don&rsquo;t want to have to manage a lot of moving parts. Using W-Fi as the companion capability to 5G lets businesses use technology they already have in place.</p>
<p>Partners, on the other hand, can take advantage of Aruba&rsquo;s strong relationship between its Wi-Fi 6 technology and 5G, Lunetta said.</p>
<p>Layer 3 Communications, a Norcross, Ga.-based solution provider and Aruba Platinum Partner, is having conversations with its enterprise customers about how 5G will be able to penetrate walls and building materials easier and faster than previous cellular technologies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having Wi-Fi as an on-ramp to 5G will increase the value of our customer&rsquo;s wireless infrastructure and encourage customers to upgrade to Wi-Fi 6,&rdquo; said Craig Wall, vice president and general manager, Western Region, for Layer 3. &ldquo;The concept of Wi-Fi and 5G being able to work together is really great for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aruba Air Pass gives enterprises an easier way to handle phone hand-off between the cellular and Wi-Fi network than deploying a separate, and often expensive, infrastructure that requires buy-in from the telecom provider who would operate that equipment, said Doug Minderhout, director of engineering for Layer 3 Communications.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Using Air Pass and Wi-Fi 6, 5G clients that walk through the door can be simply pick up the infrastructure and authenticate,&rdquo; Minderhout said.</p>
<p>5G will help drive the wireless upgrade cycle for channel partners, Wall said. &ldquo;[Wi-Fi 6] is really bringing new features, as opposed to just being an incremental upgrade in speed,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Aruba&rsquo;s technology is a part of a significant portfolio of solutions within HPE. Aruba&rsquo;s parent company on Tuesday also launched its HPE 5G Core Stack, a set of microservices that can be assembled by a telecom provider on standard hardware to enable 5G capabilities for end users.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are looking at the world holistically between the telco world and the enterprise,&rdquo; Lunetta said. &ldquo;We are providing the glue that makes that whole architecture come alive because not only can we take advantage of 5G from an edge perspective, but we can also deliver a seamless experience with what HPE is doing at the core.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aruba this month announced that it is the first provider of Wi-Fi 6 access points that has certified its entire portfolio of products via the Wi-Fi Alliance.

<h3 id="36-hours-in-aruba">36 Hours in Aruba</h3>

9) 8 a.m. Arikok National Park</p>
<p>Arikok National Park, Aruba’s only national park, covers almost 20 percent of the island and is packed with changing landscapes. You can visit the park by horseback, Jeep or four-wheeler, but perhaps the best (and most quiet and environmentally sustainable) way to really experience the park is through a hike across its belly. The park’s visitor’s center is staffed with helpful guides who, if arranged ahead of time, can guide you through the park on a free tour (tips, of course, encouraged). Many tourists make a beeline to the Natural Pool, a formation of volcanic rock that creates a walled pool between the ocean and the beach. On the southern side of the park, stalactite-covered caves protect cave drawings that date back to Aruba’s first-known inhabitants, the Arawak-speaking Caiquetio Indians. And if you’re traveling with kids, don’t miss the wind farm, or the pond where fish nibble at your feet. Park entry, $11 (children are free).</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>1 p.m. Catch of the day</li>
</ol>
<p>A favorite stop, Zeerovers offers fresh-from-the-boat seafood on a wooden dock over the ocean, about a 20-minute drive from the Arikok park entrance. The daily catch rotates, but often includes Aruban wahoo and tuna and Venezuelan shrimp. Everything is fried, so pick up a local Balashi beer to wash it down with. Lunch for two, $30.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>3 p.m. Strolling and shopping</li>
</ol>
<p>Far from the bustle of the high-rise hotels, the hamlet of San Nicolas is a little town once known as the home to one of the major refineries that supplied Allied forces with fuel during World War II. The refinery shut down decades ago, leaving San Nicolas’s economy in limbo. But stepping into that vacuum is a vibrant new art scene that has splashed colorful murals across the town’s main streets. Read about the town’s history at the Museum of Industry before stopping by Cosecha to purchase local artists’ driftwood sculptures, hand-painted greeting cards, and colorful mosaics. Artists keep 100 percent of the purchase price, and if you call ahead, you can participate in an interactive art workshop with local artists. Top off your tour with a drink at Charlie’s Bar, an iconic San Nicolas watering hole crammed with character and characters.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>6 p.m. Sunset finale</li>
</ol>
<p>Named Baby Beach because it is calm enough to splash in with your babies, this protected bay on the southern tip of the island, just past San Nicolas, offers nearly waveless, clear water and a gorgeous sunset view — and occasional green flash — perfect for your Aruban finale.</p>
<p>Lodging</p>
<p>Many of the big chain hotels such as Hilton, Marriott and Ritz-Carlton have prime beachfront locations in Palm Beach, and flocks of tourists fill them up year round, turning one part of the island into an indoor-outdoor mall of hotel lobbies, restaurants and shops, numerous enough to warrant the area a highway exit sign reading simply “Highrises.” For a more distinctive experience, consider some of the smaller boutique hotels on the island.</p>
<p>At Bucuti &amp; Tara Beach Resort in Eagle Beach (L.G. Smith Boulevard 55B, Oranjestad; from $403) 100 rooms and beach chairs spaced far apart on a wide white sand beach make this boutique resort seem much larger than it is. It stands out especially for its environmentally conscious offerings. The hotel restaurant offers complete vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free menus, and in place of plastic travel shampoos, the hotel dispenses Aruba Aloe bath products from the shower walls. Guests are even given reusable coffee travel mugs, encouraging them to avoid single-use plastic that coats some of Aruba’s remote eastern beaches. Book months ahead for best room selection.
