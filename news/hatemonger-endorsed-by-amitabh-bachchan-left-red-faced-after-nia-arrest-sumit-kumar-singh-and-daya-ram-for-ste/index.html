<p>A notorious Hindutva hatemonger, endorsed by Amitabh Bachchan, faced public shaming on Wednesday after the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested Sumit Kumar Singh and Daya Ram for stealing computer hardware of indigenous aircraft carrier. The National Investigation Agency has arrested two men allegedly for spying after they were suspected to have stolen highly sensitive computer hardware components from Indigenous Aircraft Carrier (IAC) under construction in Cochin Shipyard Ltd. Those arrested have been identified as 23-year-old Sumit Kumar Singh and 22-year-old Daya Ram.</p>
<p>While Singh is a resident of Munger in Bihar, Ram hails from Hanumangarh in Rajasthan. They were arrested from their places in Bihar and Rajasthan.</p>
<p>According to the Indian Defence News website, both Singh and Ram had allegedly stolen 5 micro-processors, 10 RAMs, 5 Solid State Drives (SSDs) from the Multi-Functional Consoles (MFCs) aboard the Ship. MFCs form part of Integrated Platform Management System (IPMS) of the Project last year. This had prompted the NIA to launch a massive investigation. After months of investigation, the NIA zeroed in on Singh and Ram and arrested them both on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The arrest of Singh and Ram on suspicion of spying for an enemy country left India’s Hindutva brigade red-faced on Twitter. No sooner did the news of their arrest surface on the microblogging site, known hate-mongers in the Hindutva brigade began to celebrate assuming that the accused were Muslims. One of them was Shefali Vaidya, who was once endorsed by Amitabh Bachchan. She wrote, “Two men from the ‘terror has no religion’ religion?”</p>
<p>Journalist Vijaita Singh, who flashed the news on their arrests, countered Vaidya. She wrote, “The names are Sumit Kumar Singh and Daya Ram. You are not sick, you are you.”</p>
<p>Vijaita also shared screenshots of similar tweets from Hindutva hatemongers, who had simply assumed that those arrested on suspicion of spying were Muslims.</p>
<p>Feel sorry for them…. Samples below.</p>
<p>BTW the names of the accused are Sumit Kumar Singh and Daya Ram. https://t.co/8fMP32j1NO pic.twitter.com/YNnfJY0xZc — vijaita singh (@vijaita) June 10, 2020</p>
<p>The latest arrests of two individuals on charges of spying comes days after the intelligence unit of the Rajasthan Police arrested two men working at army establishments for allegedly spying for Pakistan. They were identified as Chimanlal Nayak and Vikas Tilotia. While Nayak worked on contract in Mahajan field firing range in Bikaner, Titolia was a tradesman in field ammunition depot in Ganganagar. They are accused of sharing classified information about the Indian Army to Pakistan’s intelligence agency through social media.</p>
<p>In 2018, Amitabh Bachchan had endorsed Vaidya’s controversial views on Goa Inquisition and how Hindus were allegedly persecuted by the erstwhile Portuguese rulers of the western coastal state.

<p>Ambala: A man was shot at an injured in Ambala on Monday early morning allegedly not paying Rs 20 lakh to an extortionist, even as police investigate a rivalry angle over gambling.</p>
<p>The victim Sumit Kumar from Khatik Mandi and his friend, retired Army man Sunil Dutt, were on a two-wheeler when a car drove up alongside and six men attempted to kidnap Kumar, the latter said in his complaint to the police.</p>
<p>As Kumar and Dutt resisted, one man “fired from a pistol, hitting Sumit on the side. The shooter shouted out his name and said Kumar owed him Rs 20 lakh, “another man robbed my licensed revolver and fled in the car,” said Dutt.</p>
<p>The complainant also alleged that Kumar had told him that he had seen the car outside the house of a criminal who was out of prison on parole and that the man who had mentioned Rs 20 lakh had come to Kumar’s shop asking for the same amount as ransom money.</p>
<p>Kumar was referred to Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh from the Ambala Cantt Civil Hospital.</p>
<p>An FIR was registered under various sections of the IPC and Arms Act against the three men mentioned in the complaint at the Ambala Cantt police station.</p>
<p>“We understand that there is some old rivalry between these men over gambling money and we are investigating the complainant’s claim too,” said superintendent of police Abhishek Jorwal.

<p>An automatic pistol along with three live cartridges and a white coloured Audi car was seized on Wednesday from the garage of a man wanted in the connection with the firing at Ram Avtar Batra’s liquor vend in Sector 9. The recover was made following the disclosure of Vainkat Garg, who was arrested last week.</p>
<p>The garage owner, Sumit Kumar Bhatia, is absconding. While he is a resident of Zirakpur, his parents reside at Sector 48 in Chandigarh. A team comprising Inspector Ram Rattan Sharma and SI Naveen Kumar seized the weapon, cartridges and the vehicle.</p>
<p>Earlier, the police had recovered a Honda Amaze car, in which two shooters had escaped after firing the bullets on the liquor vend.</p>
<p>A police officer said, “Sumit Kumar Bhatia had provided logistics to the shooters and was involved in the conspiracy. He was in the touch with the shooters, who have been identified. Raids are being conducted to arrest Sumit Kumar Bhatia, who owns a garage in Zirakpur. The weapon, cartridges and the audi car belongs to him. Vainkat Garg, a resident of Naraingarh, had disclosed the name of Sumit during his interrogation.” Garg, who was arrested on June 11, was sent to judicial custody for 14 days.</p>
<p>On June 2, in an incident of firing, two unidentified persons had shot bullets at a wine shop in Sector 9D, leaving four people injured. After firing, the shooters had escaped from the spot in a Honda Amaze car.</p>
<p>Thereafter, a case was registered on the complaint of one of the injured liquor vend employee, Akbar Khan, a resident of Nurpur in Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh.</p>
<p>During the course of the investigation, teams of the Central Sub Division, under the supervision of SDPO Central Krishan Kumar, led by Inspectors Jaspal Singh, Ram Rattan and SI Naveen Kumar, conducted the operations.</p>

<p>KOCHI: National Investigation Agency (NIA) sleuths have recovered 19 of the 20 computer components stolen from the Indigenous Aircraft Carrier (IAC) under construction at the Cochin Shipyard. The lone missing item, a microprocessor, was sold via online marketplace OLX! The NIA said the suspects — Sumit Kumar Singh of Bihar and Daya Ram of Rajasthan — sold the microprocessor to a person in Kerala for Rs 5,000. The other 19 components were recovered following the duo’s arrest. The NIA court on Monday sent them to the agency’s custody for seven days.</p>
<p>“One hard disk and a RAM was recovered from Singh’s residence in Bihar. Other goods, including three hard disks, five microprocessors and nine RAMs, were recovered from the house of his brother in Surat, Gujarat,” said a source. Sources said NIA has also received information about the duo’s entry into the shipyard by retrieving the information from their mobile phones. “The phone has photographs of their entry pass from Gandhi gate and their employee number,” said a source.</p>
<p>The NIA had sought 10-day custody of the duo, but the court granted them the same for seven days. One of the accused told the court that they stole the components for money. They also requested to relinquish the ‘vakalath’, a document filed by an advocate to represent them in the court, as they could not afford it. The NIA will take the accused to the buyer. An identification parade will also be held and the duo will be taken to the shipyard and the room in Kochi where they stayed while working for the company that was roped in for painting the aircraft.</p>

<p>KOCHI: It was the single imprint traced from the Cochin Shipyard that helped the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to crack the case related to the theft of computer hardware of India’s first Indigenous Aircraft Carrier (IAC). NIA officials believe the theft was well planned and executed by two arrested persons Sumit Kumar Singh of Bihar and Daya Ram of Rajasthan.</p>
<p>According to sources, only one credible imprint – that of the bottom portion of the palm- was received from the place where the theft took place. “The accused might have worn gloves to leave no trace of fingerprints. But somehow, the imprint of the bottom portion of the palm was traced. As both were confident that there was no fingerprint, they came to Kochi early this year to give their fingerprint imprint as part of the investigation.</p>
<p>It was the fingerprint analysis that helped to crack the case,” sources said. Fingerprints of as many as 6,400 persons were collected. “After the imprint of Sumit Kumar was found matching, NIA recorded his statement and he confessed about the involvement of the second accused. Reaching the first accused was a difficult task as he stayed in a Maoist-affected village in Bihar,” sources said.</p>
<p>Of the 20 lost hardware including five micro-processors, 10 RAMs and five solid state drives (SSD), almost all were recovered. The stolen components were hidden at the residence of Sumit Kumar’s brother in Gujarat. One component was sold via OLX for Rs 5,000 when the accused were staying in Kochi.</p>
<p>The investigation team are also checking the involvement of more persons in the case. “They were employed as painters in the IAC. First accused had good knowledge of computer hardware. But it might be with the help of someone else that the accused persons came to know about such a system in IAC. We have to interrogate them to get further details for which their custody will be sought,” sources said.</p>
<p>Covid test to be crucial</p>
<p>An anti-body test result will be crucial for the NIA because if the test turns positive, the investigation will take a hit. According to sources, the case was registered under various sections of IPC and IT Act. “We have to seek custody of the accused within the first 14 days of the remand period,” sources said.

<h3 id="ladakh-military-faceoff-with-china-may-go-on-for-longer-than-earlier-ones">&ldquo;Ladakh military faceoff with China may go on for longer than earlier ones&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2020-06/19/I_2b791002-5image_story.jpg" alt="img">
(MENAFN - IANS) By Sumit Kumar Singh</p>
<p>New Delhi, June 19 (IANS) The standoff between Indian and Chinese soldiers in eastern Ladakh region in the last one-and-a-half months is likely to fester for longer than any other such faceoffs in recent years, and could surpass the 73-day conflict in Doklam in 2017.</p>
<p>The eastern Ladakh crisis is an unprecedented situation if compared to the Doklam standoff, which was resolved after little more than 70 days.</p>
<p>The tense situation in Galwan Valley in all likelihood would be a prolonged feud since India has lost 20 of its soldiers.</p>
<p>Also, what is disturbing is that 10 Indian soldiers, including officers, were in the captivity of Chinese People&rsquo;s Liberation Army (PLA) for three days after one of the bloodiest attacks was carried out by China on June 15 at the Line of Actual Control (LAC).</p>
<p>There is a renewed fury in Indian security establishments after it came to light that a total 10 Indian Army men, including two officers of the rank of Lieutenant Colonel and Major, were in Chinese Army captivity for three days and were released only on Thursday evening.</p>
<p>The barbaric assault on Indian Army soldiers at patrolling point 14 on June 15 has left little scope to ease the tension between the two countries in near future.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s deceptive method to change status quo:</p>
<p>China has changed the status quo at four places in eastern Ladakh to which India has objected. The four standoff points are Finger Four in north bank of Pangong Lake, patrolling point 14 near Galwan Valley, patrolling point 15 and patrolling point 17A, which is also known as Hot Springs.</p>
<p>At these four points, troop concentration has increased manifold as China changed the status quo.</p>
<p>The Chinese deceptive move underlining its expansionist design kick-started after India had begun building road infrastructure in its territory near the Line of Actual Control for easy movement of troops.</p>
<p>The Galwan Valley attack on Indian soldiers on June 15 was not an isolated incident.</p>
<p>The unprovoked offensive by the Chinese PLA started from May 5 and kept happening over few intervals, leading to the barbaric attack on the night of June 15 in which 76 soldiers were injured and 20 were killed.</p>
<p>Those were the first casualties faced by the Indian Army in a clash with the Chinese PLA since 1975 when an Indian patrol was ambushed by Chinese troops in Arunachal Pradesh.</p>
<p>Indian Army troops were outnumbered by 1:5 ratio when PLA troops attacked patrolling point number 14 at the Line of Actual Control. PLA troops &ldquo;savagely attacked&rdquo; Indian Army personnel, sources said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The numbers of Indian Army troops compared to PLA troops were of 1:5 ratio,&rdquo; said sources, adding that China used thermal imaging drones to trace Indian army soldiers before brutally attacking them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the deadliest attack carried on Indian Army personnel,&rdquo; government sources said.</p>
<p>The Doklam crisis:</p>
<p>The Doklam crisis of 2017 was totally different from the current situation in eastern Ladakh region, as it was not taking place on a territory disputed between the two countries.</p>
<p>China was carrying out infrastructural development work in Doklam, the tri-junction of three countries &ndash; India, China and Bhutan &ndash; to which India had objected.</p>
<p>China then claimed that there was a boundary dispute between Bhutan and China in which India had no claims.</p>
<p>However, India refuted and stood its ground, matching the deployment of Chinese troops for 73 days.</p>
<p>The standoff was triggered by China, which said it was constructing a road within its territory. This was disputed by India, which said the Chinese road construction site was Bhutanese territory.</p>
<p>In Doklam, India feared that the Chinese road would give its military access to heights from where it could threaten the Siliguri Corridor, India&rsquo;s tenuous link with its northeastern regions.</p>
<p>The crisis was resolved with diplomatic maturity without losing any ground. There was no change in the status quo on the ground and the faceoff ended on August 28, 2017.</p>
<p>The Eastern Ladakh Crisis:</p>
<p>The faceoff in eastern Ladakh, where China has intruded into Indian territory, has escalated into intense hostility and both the countries have increased troop deployments at four strategic locations.</p>
<p>The Chinese are trying to usurp Indian land and even launched a massive propaganda campaign to claim that its troops were positioned within the Chinese border, which is a lie that has been exposed by international think-tanks keeping a close watch on India-China border developments.</p>
<p>The Chinese military has positioned itself at strategic locations in such a way that it will give them the edge to challenge road construction by India. China does not want any threatening build-up of military infrastructure in the Sub Sector North, which lies just to the east of Siachen glacier and is the only area that provides direct access to Aksai Chin from India.</p>
<p>In the meantime, India has maintained that it needs to build infrastructure in its own territory at the Line of Actual Control and cannot compromise on it.</p>
<p>This has led to the current crisis.</p>
<p>Escalated Hostility:</p>
<p>In his first remarks on the bloody border clash between Indian and Chinese troops in Galwan Valley, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had made it clear on Wednesday that India wants peace, but is capable of giving a befitting reply if provoked.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said, &ldquo;I would like to assure the nation that the sacrifice of our jawans will not go in vain. For us, India&rsquo;s unity and sovereignty is most important and no one can stop us from protecting them. No one should have a doubt on this point. India wants peace, but is capable of giving a befitting reply in every way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This clear message comes against the backdrop of the Chinese army and its Foreign Ministry&rsquo;s blatant lie claiming control over the Galwan Valley.</p>
<p>Although historical facts and documents have exposed Chinese sinister claims, the move itself highlights Chinese intent to change the status quo in the Ladakh region. The Indian security establishments have clearly said that India will not let the Chinese take even an inch of its territory.</p>
<p>The Indian government and security officials believe that the situation will remain tense in the coming months even as both countries are trying to resolve the vexed issues through dialogue.</p>
<p>India is also looking at a multi-pronged approach to deal with China by curtailing its business activities in the country.</p>

Pistol used in firing outside liquor shop in Chandigarh recovered during raid at house in Sector 48</p>
<p>chandigarh</p>
<p>Updated: Jun 17, 2020 21:54 IST</p>
<p>Chandigarh Police on Wednesday claimed to have recovered an automatic pistol used in the firing outside a liquor shop in Sector 9 on June 2.</p>
<p>Three live cartridges and a magazine were also recovered during a raid at a house in Sector 48 on Tuesday, said police.</p>
<p>The raid was conducted on the basis of disclosures made by Vainkat Garg, 22, a close aide of gangster Lawrence Bidhnoi, who was arrested from Naraingarh in Ambala on June 11 for harbouring and providing logistical support to the two shooters.</p>
<p>Two men, identified as Rinku, alias Topi, of Pehwa and Davinder Chawla of Hisar, had rained bullets at a liquor shop on the evening of June 2, leaving four men injured. The two are on the run. Investigations had led police to Garg.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, police raided the house of Sumit Kumar Bhatia, 35, also a member of the Bishnoi gang, who was allegedly handed over the pistol by the shooters, said a senior police official, not wishing to be named.</p>
<p>While Bhatia managed to flee in an Audi, the pistol and ammunition were recovered from his garage. The Audi was also later recovered from his farm house situated on Patiala Road in Zirakpur, said police.</p>
<p>Bhatia is named as an accused in an Arms Act case registered at the Sector 31 police station in 2014.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, police have also recovered Garg’s two mobile phones. “These mobile handsets are likely to have evidence or clues about crimes committed in Chandigarh,” said deputy superintendent of police (central) Krishan Kumar. Earlier, police had recovered a Honda Amaze and Maruti Alto used by the shooters.
