Former Karnataka chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamy has dared Prime Minister Narendra Modi to offer a &ldquo;credible scientific and rational&rdquo; explanation for choosing April 5 for the candlelight vigil. Kumaraswamy, in a series of tweets, alleged that the PM has &ldquo;slyly&rdquo; asked the nation to observe the candlelight vigil on the eve of the foundation day (April 6) of the BJP.</p>
<p>Has the PM slyly asked the nation to observe a candle light vigil on the eve of foundation day of BJP? April 6 being its foundation day, what else can explain the choice of date &amp; time for this event? I challenge the PM to offer a credible scientific and rational explanation.</p>
<p>1/3 — H D Kumaraswamy (@hd_kumaraswamy) April 5, 2020</p>
<p>&ldquo;The government is yet to provide PPEs for doctors and make testing kits affordable for the common man. Without telling the nation what concrete steps are being taken to combat COVID-19 menace, the prime minister is giving meaningless tasks to an already exhausted population,&rdquo; tweeted Kumaraswamy.</p>
<p>The government is yet to provide PPEs for doctors and make test kits affordable for the common man. Without telling the nation what concrete steps are being taken to combat COVID-19 menace, the prime minister is giving meaningless tasks to an already exhausted population.</p>
<p>2/3 — H D Kumaraswamy (@hd_kumaraswamy) April 5, 2020</p>
<p>Dubbing the vigil as a hidden agenda, Kumaraswamy said, &ldquo;It is shameful to convert the national crisis into an event of self aggrandisement &amp; it is beyond shameful to push the hidden agenda of his party in the face of global calamity. May sense prevail upon the PM.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Interestingly, on March 22, JD(S) patriarch H.D. Devegowda had clapped from his balcony extending his support to PM&rsquo;s call for a Janata curfew. Kumaraswamy, too, had tweeted saying he was supporting the call, expressing gratitude to the medical fraternity and police fighting COVID-19. He had also urged the government to offer incentives for the frontline workers.

At least one hundred people gathered outside the BJP MLA&rsquo;s residence in Mumbai. (Photo: India Today)</p>
<p>As Maharashtra continues its battle against the coronavirus, a BJP MLA from Wardha district on Sunday allegedly violated the lockdown norms by distributing dry ration to people at his residence to mark his birthday.</p>
<p>Dadarao Keche, BJP MLA from Aarvi in Wardha district, distributed wheat and rice outside his house to celebrate his birthday.</p>
<p>The BJP MLA&rsquo;s actions made hundreds of people gather outside his residence even when the world leaders and doctors have emphasised on social distancing as a key to keep the coronavirus at bay.</p>
<p>At least one hundred people gathered outside the MLA&rsquo;s residence, crowding the narrow lane, to receive free grains before officials and police personnel reached the spot and dispersed them.</p>
<p>The incident took place earlier on Sunday morning. The video and pictures immediately went viral.</p>
<p>When India Today TV spoke with him, Dadarao Keche said he wanted to distribute the ration to only 21 people blamed the opposition for conspiring against him by sending hundreds in front of his house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I distribute food to the poor and needy every year on my birthday. I was planning to distribute food grains only to 21 families. After doing that I left for a temple but then opposition conspired and spread the message that I was distributing free ration to everyone. This resulted in mass gathering,&rdquo; Dadarao Keche said in his defense.

<p><img src="https://cdn.siasat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Modi-Twitter-.jpg" alt="img">
NEW DELHI: 6th April is a very important day for the Bharatiya Janata Party workers across the country because on this day in 1980, the ruling saffron party was established.</p>
<p>Foe the last few years, the saffron party’s foundation day celebration was a grand affair.</p>
<p>With an aim to make its foundation day a grand event, the party workers organised rallies, hoists the party flags, and various programmes and activities.</p>
<p>39 years ago on this day, @BJP4India was born with an unwavering commitment to serve society and take the nation to new heights. Thanks to the efforts of our Karyakartas, BJP has become India’s preferred party. Greetings to the BJP family on the Party’s Foundation Day. pic.twitter.com/fBHp3fBQ2a — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) April 6, 2019</p>

<p>Indirect celebration</p>
<p>Though, BJP will not celebrates its 40th foundation day on Monday the way it was celebrated earlier due to the current lockdown imposed across the country in the wake of coronavirus pandemic but indirectly makes the whole country celebrate the party’s founding day with the 9 pm plan.</p>
<p>JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy criticized PM Modi asking if it is “hidden agenda of the party in the face of global calamity” to celebrate the party’s founding day on April 6 by making the citizens indirectly hold diyas to serve their purpose.</p>
<p>The government is yet to provide PPEs for doctors and make test kits affordable for the common man. Without telling the nation what concrete steps are being taken to combat COVID-19 menace, the prime minister is giving meaningless tasks to an already exhausted population.</p>
<p>2/3 — H D Kumaraswamy (@hd_kumaraswamy) April 5, 2020</p>
<p>Tweeting in Kannada, he questioned, “Did the PM misuse the corona crisis to observe BJP foundation day?” he wrote.</p>
<p>Week-long outreach programme</p>
<p>To celebrate the 40th foundation day of the BJP, party workers will engage in a week-long outreach programme across Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p>The party workers will also undertake signature campaign to thank doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, policemen, sanitation workers, bank officials, postal department officials and employees other departments on the frontline in the fight against coronavirus.</p>
<p>In a video message on Friday, PM Modi urged the citizens to switch off the lights at their homes and light up lamps, candles or mobile phone torches for 9 minutes at 9:00 PM on April 5, Sunday, to display India’s collective resolve to defeat coronavirus.</p>
