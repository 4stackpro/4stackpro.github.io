The first posthumous song by Juice Wrld has arrived.</p>
<p>On Thursday (April 23), Juice&rsquo;s mother, Carmela Wallace, his family and his team announced in an Instagram post that after deciding the best way to release music from the late rapper, they would be dropping a song called, &ldquo;Righteous.&rdquo; On Friday (April 24), we get the new track from the late MC.</p>
<p>The single is produced by frequent collaborator Nick Mira and Charlie Handsome is a slower track that finds Juice talking about the fast life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All white Gucci suit, I&rsquo;m feeling righteous, yeah/I know that the truth is hard to digest, yeah,&rdquo; Juice rhymes on the chorus. &ldquo;Five or six pills in my right hand, yeah/Codeine runneth over on my nightstand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the record, he delivers haunting lines about death. &ldquo;Over ice, I&rsquo;m freezing/Beautiful eyes, deceiving/We may die this evening/Coughing, wheezing, bleeding,&rdquo; Juice raps. &ldquo;High, I&rsquo;m an anxious soul/Blood moons are my eyes, stay low/Red and black, they glow/Under attack, in my soul/When it&rsquo;s my time, I&rsquo;ll know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Steve Cannon-directed video for the track features a mix of stock footage and Juice Wrld-themed anime.</p>
<p>According to Juice Wrld&rsquo;s girlfriend Ally Lotti, the song was inspired by a dream the rapper had. &ldquo;If you listen to the song, it&rsquo;s of a dream he had and waking up and just dealing with the everyday activities that he was doing and dealing with,&rdquo; she said in an Instagram Live session on the night the song was released.</p>
<p>This is the first music to be released following Juice&rsquo;s passing in December of 2019. Months prior, in October of 2019, the Chicago native released &ldquo;Bandit&rdquo; featuring YoungBoy Never Broke Again. The track was supposed to appear on the follow-up to his sophomore album, Death Race for Love.</p>
<p>A posthumous Juice Wrld album has been teased by Lil Bibby, a close friend of the rapper, but nothing has been released until now. Earlier this month, Bibby uploaded a photo of himself with Juice to Instagram and wrote in the comment section of the post that new music by Juice Wrld was &ldquo;coming soon.&rdquo; Then, back in February, Bibby tweeted about trying to get Frank Ocean on his late friend&rsquo;s album.</p>
<p>Juice, who appeared on the cover of XXL magazine&rsquo;s Fall 2019 issue, revealed at the time that he would be dropping his third album on his 21st birthday, Dec. 2. The album, however, did not end up being released that day, and Juice Wrld died six days after.</p>
<p>Juice Wrld passed away on Dec. 8, 2019 after suffering a seizure at Chicago&rsquo;s Midway Airport. The 21-year-old&rsquo;s death was ruled an accidental overdose of oxycodone and codeine.</p>

<h3 id="juice-wrlds-posthumous-single-righteous-to-drop-tonight">Juice WRLD’s posthumous single “Righteous” to drop tonight</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OS4pWx_dOIllIMstHP528GtvJ6I=/0x31:1600x869/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19920681/juice_wrld_getty_images.jpg" alt="img">
Juice WRLD’s estate is finally releasing new music from the late rapper.</p>
<p>Today (April 23), Juice’s mother Carmela Wallace revealed in a social media post that her son’s first posthumous single will be dropping tonight.</p>
<p>“Juice was a prolific artist who dedicated his life to making music,” the statement reads. “Choosing how to share his upcoming music with the world has been no easy feat. Honoring the love Juice felt for his fans while shining a light on his talents and his spirit are the most important parts of this process to us.”</p>
<p>Wallace then revealed the title of the new single.</p>
<p>“Tonight we will be releasing a song called ‘Righteous’ which Juice made from his home studio in Los Angeles. We hope you enjoy this new music and continue to keep Juice’s spirit alive. Stay safe everyone.”</p>
<p>A version of “Righteous” leaked online last year. In the song, he raps, “All white Gucci suit, I’m feeling righteous, yeah/ I know that the truth is hard to digest, yeah/ Five or six pills in my right hand, yeah/ Codeine runneth over on my nightstand/ Takin’ medicine to fix all of the damage/ My anxiety the size of a planet (Yeah, ooh)/ Holes in my skull, over time/ My heart’s over ice (Woah).”</p>
<p>It is unclear if tonight’s release will be the same as the leaked record or a different version.</p>
<p>Yesterday (April 22), Wallace announced that she created the Live Free 999 fund to help other young people who struggle with mental health issues.</p>
<p>The fund will provide support to programs that address addiction, depression and anxiety and strive towards normalizing the conversation surrounding those topics, especially in underserved communities. It will also support programs that offer positive avenues for people to process their mental health issues.</p>
<p>Check out the statement below.

<h3 id="the-first-posthumous-juice-wrld-album-is-on-the-way">The first posthumous Juice WRLD album is on the way!</h3>
<p><img src="https://mnrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mnr-juice-wrld-posthumous.jpg" alt="img">
Since his death in December of 2019 Juice WRLD has managed to stay not only relevant, but incredibly popular. Since his death Juice has appeared on a number of incredibly popular tracks such as Eminem’s “Godzilla,” Gherbo’s “PTSD,” and a remix of YNW Melly’s popular hit “Suicidal.” The track “Godzilla,” topped the Billboard Hot 100 Chart the day it was released, and has been streamed over 100 million times respectively. “PTSD,” the most played song on Gherbo’s latest project of the same name, has over 10 million views on YouTube alone.</p>
<p>At the same time Juice has been doing numbers with features on popular tracks he has also been having somewhat of a rebirth on SoundCloud. Since his death, unreleased Juice WRLD tracks on the platform have dominated the site’s traffic. Tracks like “London Tipton” have garnered 30 thousand plus streams before being removed by site admins, and re-uploaded by fans just to earn thousands of plays again.</p>
<p>YouTube has also been awash with Juice WRLD content, as never before seen radio freestyles, and interviews were released to fans in the wake of his death. Adam 22, the host of the No Jumper podcast, has released a slew of Juice related content, including interviews with his long time friends Dj Scheme, Danny Towers, and Gherbo. These various clips, each sporting close to half a million views, provided fans with their first insight into how Juice’s death impacted his friends in the hip hop community.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with XXL magazine Juice’s friend, collaborator, and idol, Future opened up about missing Juice and said that he is still “heartbroken.” Many of Juice’s friends and acquaintances have taken to posting about him in the near 6 months since he has been gone, including Ski Mask the Slump God, Cole Bennett, Dj Scheme and his girlfriend Ally Lotti. “We are just some kids trying to have fun and enjoy the world, and sometimes people forget that but I’m glad we got to enjoy it while it lasted,” said Dj Scheme in a heartfelt social media post. “ “Nobody with love like you shouldn’t be here right now… Enjoy heaven the whole gang will be reunited before you know it, Love you J.”” — Dj Scheme (Via Instagram)</p>
<p>The good news is that we may be able to appreciate more of Juice’s legacy soon. According to Lil Bibby, Juice WRLD’s long time friend and executive of the record label Grade-A, under which Juice was signed, a new Juice WRLD album will be “coming soon.” Bibby has gone on to confirm to fans that the leaked track “Blood on my Jeans” will be on the project. The unreleased track has been streamed on SoundCloud by fans more than 10 thousand times before being removed and re-uploaded.</p>
<p>According to individuals close to Jarad and his estate, he recorded some 2,000 unreleased songs before his death. With a typical album featuring anywhere from 20 to 30 tracks on the high end, I think it is safe to say that there will be new Juice WRLD content coming out for a while. Juice also reportedly collaborated with artists such as Trippie Redd, Polo G, and Lil Uzi Vert before his death. It will be interesting to see if these tracks will come out on the Juice WRLD album, or if they will be released by other artists with Juice as a feature.</p>
<p>In addition to existing collaborations Lil Bibby also tweeted out, “ “gotta get Frank Ocean on this Juice album,”” — Lil Bibby (Via Twitter)</p>
<p>suggesting that the project may contain features that Juice did not complete before his death. Although I have expressed my distaste of this practice when it came to XXXTentacion’s posthumous project “Skins,” I think this situation is different. Bibby is not only the head of the label in charge of Juice’s legacy, but he was also his close friend. I for one trust Bibby to do right by Juice, and I have no reason to doubt that the album will be anything less than a banger. R.I.P. J.
