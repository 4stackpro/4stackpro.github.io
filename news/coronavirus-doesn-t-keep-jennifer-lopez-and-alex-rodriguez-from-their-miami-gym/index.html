Apparently, if you‚Äôre Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez you can do things that regular people can‚Äôt do during a shelter in place for a global pandemic ‚Äî such as go to the gym.</p>
<p>Page Six published photos of the couple in workout gear leaving a local gym in Miami on Wednesday, the same day that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced a statewide stay-at-home order to reduce the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Jennifer Lopez, Alex Rodriguez go to gym despite Florida stay-home order https://t.co/PSp6zGH5Kr pic.twitter.com/OMyc8Jk1H7 ‚Äî Page Six (@PageSix) April 2, 2020</p>
<p>Page Six also said it appears the gym made an exception for Lopez, 50, and Rodriguez, 44, to enjoy a private workout. A sign on the door said the facility is closed and urged customers to ‚Äústay home‚Äù and ‚Äústay safe.‚Äù</p>
<p>The couple also had a security guard with them, who wore a mask and opened the door to their SUV with what appeared to be a sanitizing wipe, Page Six said.</p>
<p>The order that DeSantis signed Wednesday said Floridians can‚Äôt leave their home unless they need to obtain or provide essential services, such as grocery shopping, going to the laundromat or hardware store or to a store to buy guns.</p>
<p>But Miami-Dade County already had such orders in place for residents. The county issued a stay-at-home order on March 26. Moreover, the county on March 31 ordered that all fitness centers, gymnasiums, pools, golf courses and other ‚Äúcommon-use amenities‚Äù must close.</p>
<p>More than 9,500 people in Florida have tested positive for coronavirus, and 163 have died, according to numbers posted by the state‚Äôs department of health Friday.</p>
<p>Miami-Dade County has 3,029 cases, the most in the state; 25 people have died.</p>
<p>DeSantis, a Republican and Trump ally, faced mounting criticism for resisting calls to issue a statewide, stay-at-home order, especially after images of spring breakers and crowds of people on beaches sparked national outrage, CNN reported. There also have been reports that the state‚Äôs outbreak may have begun at the Super Bowl in Miami in early February, when Lopez and Shakira co-headlined the halftime show, Page Six said.

<p>Page Six reported that the ‚ÄúHustlers‚Äù star and her former baseball star boyfriend have otherwise stuck close to home. Lopez tweeted out a TikTok video showing her, Rodriguez and their four children dancing together in what appears to be their back yard.</p>
<p>Lopez also has been promoting causes she hopes will help people in need during the pandemic. On the same day as her reported gym workout, she announced that she and Rodriguez were working with Wheels Up, a membership-only private plane company that wants to deliver 1 million meals to people facing hunger because of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Have you guys heard about @WheelsUp Meals Up? Alex and I have partnered with @DangeRussWilson in donating 1 million meals each to @FeedingAmerica to help people across the country during this difficult time ü§ç We are grateful to come together, even when we are apart. https://t.co/NXuyTaxb0F ‚Äî Jennifer Lopez (@JLo) April 1, 2020</p>
<p>Lopez also has been promoting ‚ÄúThanks a Million,‚Äù a new show on the Quibi app that she executive produced. The show, which premieres April 6, involves celebrities ‚Äúkickstarting a chain of kindness‚Äù by giving $100,000 to a person who has changed his or her life. That person must then pay half of the amount forward to someone else.
