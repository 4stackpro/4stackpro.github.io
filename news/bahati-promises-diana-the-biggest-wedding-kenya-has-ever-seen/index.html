<ul>
<li>
<p>Diana disclosed receiving text messages from a desperate Lydia Mwangi who was in Nigeria and was seeking help to fly back to Nairobi</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She said Lydia left her suitcase in her place in a rush promising to show up the following day only for her to resurface after two weeks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The charade all started when a lady claiming to be Bahati’s wife’s former friend accused the light-skinned lady of refusing to pay for bags that were sold to her</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>-According to Bahati&rsquo;s wife, the last conversation with Lydia was when she asked her to pay for her cab and on receiving the MPESA message she went quiet</p>
<p>Days after Bahati&rsquo;s wife, Diana Marua, was exposed as a petty thief on social media, the mother of one has shared her side of the story.</p>
<p>Marua released screenshots proving that whatever gossip has been spreading like bushfire was all a lie.</p>

<p>In her version of the story, she got a message from Lydia Mwangi asking for help and narrated how she was suffering in Nigeria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day Scrolling on my WhatsApp messages I get disturbing messages from a Lady introducing herself as Jane Mwangi, texting from Nigeria trying to open up to me that her life is at the edge. Sending me photos of her devastated self, saying her family views her as an outcast and she is at the Verge of Committing Suicide,&rdquo; wrote Diana.</p>
<p>On reminding her that they went to the same high school, the mother of two promised to help Lydia saying she would do anything to pay for her flight back from Nigeria to Nairobi.</p>
<p>Narrating the whole ordeal, Diana said once the lady was in Kenya they meet and went out to have a talk.</p>
<p>The mother of two reveals paying for the lady&rsquo;s drinks and a cab and as she was leaving, she decided to leave her suitcase behind promising to come back the next day.</p>
<p>Lydia had promised to go back to Diana&rsquo;s residence the following day but did not show up until after two weeks.</p>
<p>According to Bahati&rsquo;s wife, the last conversation with Lydia was when she asked her to pay for her cab and on receiving the MPESA message she went quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So after 2 weeks is when she calls my Nanny coz she was at the gate and was denied entry. Again! She had no money for Transport back, that is why she needed to see Me; but if I am not in, I am not in. Helping You was optional not Mandatory,&rdquo; revealed Diana.</p>
<p>The charade all started when a lady claiming to be Bahati’s wife’s former friend accused the light-skinned lady of refusing to pay for bags that were sold to her.</p>
<p>A businesswoman who runs online store Diva’s Magnet alleged she once delivered handbags and shoes to Diana but the celebrity wife declined to pay for the goods.</p>
<p>According to screenshots provided by the lady, Diana took her round in circles after promising to pay for the merchandise.</p>
