<p>&ldquo;Stacey is absolutely pathological. She was faced with facts and texts&hellip; There is more than one person who said she slept with Mikey and she is flat out denying it. Like, what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So why did the law graduate reject these infidelity allegations after Mikey showed Michael their flirty texts messages?</p>
<p>Jess is convinced Stacey has too much pride to admit she&rsquo;s in the wrong and is well aware she will lose all credibility if she fesses up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She found out she was cheated on and was then made to feel embarrassed and belittled,&rdquo; Jess said. &ldquo;Obviously, her ego was hurt and then she was sucked back in by that sleaze bag and carried her shame knowing she was going to be made to look like a fool. She has tried to put on this united front.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Supplied</p>
<p>Pointing out the hypocrisy, the reality star continued: &ldquo;If Stacey did cheat and she hasn&rsquo;t owned up to it and is just lying, it seems like she and her sleaze bag partner are a match made in heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone has owned up to their drama and their cheating, and it seems like she is going to die with that lie. I hope she didn&rsquo;t do the dirty because she was looking like the better person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the episode aired, Natasha has opened up about her decision to expose her their devious ways, admitting the cheating scandal spoiled her time on the series.</p>
<p>Nine</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was pretty pissed off because I found out he slept with Stacey on the night of our one month anniversary on the show, Aleks [Markovic] told me,&rdquo; the finance analyst told The Daily Telegraph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ditched me to have sex with another bride! At first, I was totally beside myself and so angry. But my philosophy is not to hold onto any negative energy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Mikey&rsquo;s sneaky behaviour frustrated her immensely, Natasha was more devastated when she came to the realisation his intentions were never pure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a way, I felt that Stacey and Michael made such a mockery of the experiment because in the end you find out they stayed until the end despite knowing they both cheated on each other,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Nine</p>
<p>Drama aside, Natasha says she&rsquo;s glad she aired Stacey and Mikey&rsquo;s dirty laundry to the rest of the group however is ready to move on with her life and close that nightmarish chapter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just want to put this nightmare behind me and use this platform to really help people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we know, the bride had a tough time adjusting to life in the experiment and was eventually booted off the show after spiralling out of control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to leave, we had to write leave,&rdquo; the beaten-down reality star said on KIIS FM&rsquo;s The Kyle And Jackie O Show last month. &ldquo;I had a breakdown and really needed to leave for my mental health.

<h3 id="mafs-the-sneaky-way-stacey-propositioned-mikey-to-another-sex-session---and-how-he-rejected-her">MAFS: The sneaky way Stacey propositioned Mikey to ANOTHER sex session - and how he rejected her</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.newidea.com.au/media/85745/stacey-preview.jpg" alt="img">
MUST WATCH: MAFS&rsquo; Connie says Stacey&rsquo;s insults to Hayley were too vile to air</p>
<p>Married At First Sight&rsquo; s Stacey Hampton has been exposed - and her one night stand could have turned into two, or three if Mikey Pembroke hadn&rsquo;t rejected her.</p>
<p>According to Ivan Sarakula and Aleks Markovic, Stacey used the social media app Snapchat to proposition Mikey to another secret hookup, behind her husband Michael Goonan&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>Luckily for Stacey, the beauty of Snapchat is that you can send a message or photo, that deletes itself after just a few seconds, meaning there is no hard evidence of her booty calls.</p>
<p>But, in the span of those very short seconds, Mikey gave Ivan a glimpse, making him the perfect alibi.

<h3 id="stacey-spent-an-insane-amount-of-money-on-her-final-vows-outfit">Stacey spent an insane amount of money on her final vows outfit</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.who.com.au/media/58778/stace.jpg" alt="img">
She looks gorgeous! Nine Network</p>
<p>After much speculation, the single mum-of-two— who apparently boasts a $20, 000 shoe collection— addressed how she affords the finger things in life claiming she inherited a significant amount from her father and brother&rsquo;s estates following their tragic deaths. It&rsquo;s been reported she &ldquo;put the money into a family trust&rdquo;, which she later used to start several business ventures in South Australia.</p>
<p>Interestingly, her admission contradicts what we saw during an episode of MAFS last week where she thanked her former Rebels&rsquo; bikie boss ex-boyfriend for purchasing most of her wardrobe!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You’ve got a Rolex and a Givenchy bag, I’m gonna be really honest. How do you afford that?&rdquo; the casting agent asked Stacey in her audition tape which she watched with husband Michael Goonan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might want to ask my ex,&rdquo; she laughed.</p>
<p>Fans were shocked when they watched Stacey&rsquo;s MAFS audition tape. Nine Network</p>
<p>As we know, Stacey shares two children with her baby daddy, Shane Michael Smith, who landed himself in jail during her pregnancy. In spite of his criminal past, the Adelaide mum said it&rsquo;s not fair to judge a book by its cover. Speaking about their relationship, Stacey told WHO: &ldquo;I met him when I was really young – 19 – through mutual friends and I wasn’t aware of his lifestyle but I fell for him so quickly. &ldquo;He treated me so nicely, he was beautiful, loving, and I fell pregnant really quickly to him with our first son. At the time, I didn’t realise he actually had charges from ages ago that had come up – assault charges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stacey&rsquo;s brother tragically passed away when her son was born. Instagram</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stood by him when he ended up going to jail while I was pregnant, and then my brother died [in a motorbike crash] the day my son was born. But Shane rang me every hour to make sure I was OK. He had his friends checking in on me. He’s honestly the greatest person … and I think he’s really ashamed of his past.&rdquo;
