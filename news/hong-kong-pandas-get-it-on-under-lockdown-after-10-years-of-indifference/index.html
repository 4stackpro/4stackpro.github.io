Ying Ying and Le Le, giant pandas at Ocean Park in Hong-Kong, mated naturally for the first time in a decade of trying, two months after the theme park closed its doors to the public over coronavirus.</p>
<p>Two middle-aged giant pandas have finally managed to mate after living together for 10 years in a Hong Kong theme park. Notoriously perceived as lacking libido, the coronavirus lockdown seems to have brought the iconic Chinese bears months of conjugal harmony and privacy, without constant human intrusion.</p>

<p>Ying Ying and Le Le, a couple of giant pandas, successfully managed to mate for the first time in over 10 years of cohabitation at Ocean Park in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The theme park closed down on 26 January due to the Covid-19 lockdown, giving the 14-year-old pandas unending days of quiet and privacy.</p>
<p>The pandas’ sex-drive appears to have been considerably dampened while under the constant scrutiny of thousands of visitors that have frequented the theme park over the years.</p>
<p>According to Dr Li Binbin, a giant panda conservation specialist who lectures at Duke Kunshan University in China, “The drastic reduction of human disturbances around Ying Ying and Le Le definitely contributed to them mating successfully.”</p>

<p>Ocean Park proudly announced that Ying Ying and Le Le “succeeded in natural mating at around 9am this morning [Monday 6 April]” after failed attempts since 2010.</p>
<p>Chinese scientists have even tried several artificial insemination procedures which have all resulted in miscarriages by Ying Ying.</p>
<p>“The successful natural mating process is extremely exciting for all of us, as the chance of pregnancy via natural mating is higher than by artificial insemination,” said Michael Boos, Executive Director in Zoological Operations and Conservation at Ocean Park.</p>

<p>Dr Li who was also a science advisor on wild pandas for Disney&rsquo;s documenary &ldquo;Born in China&rdquo; added that pandas are a shy species, sensitive to their surroundings.</p>
<p>“They are sensitive to noise, to smell, to objects around them. If they are stressed, they cannot indulge in normal behaviour, such as mating,” she told RFI.</p>
<p>This is why mating becomes difficult when pandas live in captivity.</p>
<p>“It is essentially because of the stress brought on because they are outside their natural habitat,” Li said.</p>
<p>In the mood for love</p>
<p>Ying Ying and Le Le’s behaviour have been scrupulously monitored by Ocean Park’s team as they are now well into the breeding season which lasts from March until June.</p>
<p>They noticed that Ying Ying has been spending more time playing in the water and Le Le has been leaving scent-markings around the enclosure - behaviour typical during the mating season.</p>
<p>According to Li, common assumptions that pandas fail to mate are wrong. She claims they have no difficulty at that in the wild.</p>

<p>“Female pandas ovulate and reach a peak to receive males around two to three days during the mating season,” she explains. “And they can choose to mate with several males during that short period.”</p>
<p>In the wild, female pandas can choose the males they want to mate with. The males will fight amongst themselves to win her favours.</p>
<p>It could be that Ying Ying and Le Le did not show any interest towards each other for the past 13 years because, being in capitivity, they did not choose each other.</p>
<p>Any signs of Ying Ying’s successful pregnancy will show “as early as late June” according to Boos.</p>
<p>“We hope to bear wonderful pregnancy news to Hong Kongers this year”, he said.</p>

<p>Police and volunteers stationed at a checkpoint on Thepkrasattri Rd in Koh Kaew nabbed the first catch of the day at about 8:15am when two men on a motorbike, one of the men wearing a Grab delivery shirt, tried to pass.</p>
<p>Believing the men were acting suspiciously, the officers stopped and searched the motorbike, and found in the insulated food bag a plastic bag containing 1.4 kilogrammes of kratom leaves.</p>
<p>The officers arrested the driver Anwa Maimahad, 19, and his passenger Alongkorn Longhan, 26, who was carrying the food bag.</p>
<p>Both men were charged with illegal possession of a Category 5 drug.</p>
<p>At about 1:30pm today, officers stationed at a checkpoint on Chao Fa West Rd arrested Food Panda delivery driver Widsarut Sritham, 34, after they found a plastic bottle containing about 200ml of kratom juice inside his insulated food bag.</p>
<p>Widsarut was taken to Chalong Police Station where he, too, was charged with illegal possession of a Category 5 drug.</p>
<p>Phuket Provincial Police Commander Maj Gen Rungrote Thakurapunyasiri today announced that police had so far made arrests in 454 cases for breaches of the Emergency Decree at checkpoints across the island since Apr 3, when the national nighttime curfew from 10pm to 4am came into force.</p>
<p>Since then, officers at checkpoints had inspected 13,822 vehicles, he said.</p>
<p>Gen Rungrote gave a breakdown of the number of cases brought to prosecution by officers at the checkpoints as per police station as follows:</p>
<p>Phuket City Police (Muang District) – 140 cases</p>
<p>Thalang Police Station – 25 cases</p>
<p>Kathu Police Station – 15 cases</p>
<p>Patong Police Station – 110 cases</p>
<p>Wichit Police Station – 48 cases</p>
<p>Chalong Police Station – 39 cases</p>
<p>Karon Police Station – 32 cases</p>
<p>Cherng Talay Police Station – 15 cases</p>
<p>Tha Chatchai Police Station – 12 cases</p>
<p>Sakhu Police Station – 11 cases</p>
<p>Kamala Police Station – 7 cases</p>
<p>Prosecutions in all cases were quickly presented to the court, with the offenders each fined B5,000 and sentenced to 15 days’ imprisonment, and placed on two years’ probation, Gen Rungrote said.
