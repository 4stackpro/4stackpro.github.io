“What crime against humanity?” Mr. Duterte said in defense of his antidrug campaign. “I’d like to be frank with you, are they humans?”</p>
<p>At the height of the government’s crackdown in 2016 and 2017, Market Three, named after the nearest pier, was an epicenter of the killings, even though the majority of the 1,000 or so families living here had nothing to do with the drug trade.</p>
<p>There were bodies found floating in the water, while other people were killed in their homes, as many as five in a night.</p>
<p>While residents blamed the police for many of these summary executions, in most cases, the killers were never identified.</p>
<p>But the police left no doubt it was they who smashed open doors during frequent raids in the middle of the night, wearing masks, carrying guns and shining flashlights into the faces of Market Three’s residents.</p>
<p>Because people couldn’t quite discern why the police or their proxies were killing some and not others — mistaken identity or disproportionate punishment were frequent guesses — the raids filled the whole slum with a fear that death could happen at any time, for any reason.</p>
<p>There’s less of that now. While the government’s deadly antidrug campaign goes on, the police focus has shifted to other areas of the country and to other targets. Just on Wednesday, Mr. Duterte ordered the police and the military to shoot people protesting the nation’s lockdown over the coronavirus.

<h3 id="analysis-may-pera-nga-ba-does-duterte-have-money-to-fight-covid-19">[ANALYSIS] May pera nga ba? Does Duterte have money to fight COVID-19?</h3>
<p><img src="https://assets.rappler.com/612F469A6EA84F6BAE882D2B94A4B421/img/87721C83DC1345E7AD66FB54786E99FB/does-duterte-have-money-to-fight-covid-19-april-2-2020.jpg" alt="img">
There are already flashes of social unrest.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, April 1, residents from Sitio San Roque, an urban poor community in Quezon City, went out of their houses on rumors that aid was being distributed. Having violated quarantine rules, they were swiftly chased down by the police; 21 were arrested.</p>
<p>Here’s the awful truth: aid is not reaching Filipinos fast enough.</p>
<p>In the recently signed Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, President Rodrigo Duterte promised to give 18 million households a monthly “emergency subsidy” of at least P5,000 per household for two months. But government is still preparing the database that will be used to target these households.</p>
<p>It’s not just workers and the poor who need help, but also businesses whose cash flows – and very survival – are in peril. But the Department of Finance (DOF) said aid for firms will “take [a] back seat.”</p>
<p>Economists say government needs as much as P300 billion to put the Philippine economy on life support. Duterte assured the people – in one of his late night addresses – that he has the money for that: “may pera ako”.</p>
<p>But does he really have the money? Where will it come from? And how exactly does he intend to use it?</p>
<p>Sources of funds</p>
<p>The good news is that government has lots of possible sources of emergency funds – from taxes to savings and loans.</p>
<p>As for taxes, the DOF admitted tax revenues might drop this year by over P91 billion, what with the Philippine economy put in forced hibernation. Minimal incomes beget minimal taxes. (READ: ‘Freezing’ the PH economy: Can we survive it?)</p>
<p>But Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III gave assurances previous tax reform programs like TRAIN were able to raise nearly P200 billion in revenues in the past two years.</p>
<p>Even as Dominguez said this, however, he implored taxpayers – at least those able to file and pay their taxes early – to help bankroll the government’s COVID-19 programs.</p>
<p>But the entire point of the government’s response to COVID-19 is to hand out economic aid. The last thing we want is for government to ask money from the people while their incomes and livelihoods disappear before their eyes.</p>
<p>As for savings, the Bayanihan law authorized Duterte to “reprogram, reallocate, and realign” savings from 2020 budget items to help communities and industries affected by COVID-19.</p>
<p>But in Duterte’s first weekly report last Monday, March 30, no such realignment has been done.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the DOF claims there are P200 billion more that can be tapped from various accounts of the national government and GOCCs (government owned or controlled corporations).</p>
<p>As for loans, the DOF is already in talks with multilateral agencies like the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to secure loans amounting to $1 billion-$2 billion.</p>
<p>In April the Treasury also expects to raise P190 billion from its sale of government securities – although demand from investors has been anemic of late.</p>
<p>By far the most significant funding source came from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), which purchased government securities worth P300 billion.</p>
<p>You can think of this as a zero-interest bridge loan that the Treasury must repay in 6 months. If spent prudently, this substantial sum could go a long way in our fight against COVID-19.</p>
<p>Uses of funds</p>
<p>More worrisome than the sources of funds are the uses of funds.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of confusion right now on exactly how much Duterte plans to spend for his COVID-19 projects.</p>
<p>First, government announced on March 16 a P27.1 billion spending plan. But some observers said this sum was too small and a mere repackaging of existing budget items. Oddly, it was also mostly earmarked for tourism.</p>
<p>Second, Marikina Representative Stella Quimbo drafted a P108 billion “economic rescue plan” which allotted P50 billion for business loans and subsidies, P43 billion for tourism, and P15 billion for displaced workers. But Congress has yet to pass this or some other rescue package.</p>
<p>Third, Duterte’s allies in the House penciled P275 billion in their draft of the Bayanihan law (originally written by the Palace). But when interpellated, the bill’s sponsors couldn’t provide any breakdown for the huge sum they proposed.</p>
<p>Fourth, the Bayanihan law signed by Duterte on March 25 actually didn’t specify a total amount. Duterte later said he’d spend P200 billion, but that’s barely enough for his emergency subsidy which, by itself, will cost somewhere between P180 billion and P288 billion (plus P5.1 billion in administrative costs).</p>
<p>Lots of people on social media demand to see what Duterte has done with the supposed P275-billion COVID-19 budget. But the real amount…we don’t know. There’s no detailed spending plan yet.</p>
<p>Slow delivery of aid</p>
<p>In the meantime, more people are getting broke and hungry and desperate by the day.</p>
<p>The Bayanihan law did specify the amount of emergency subsidy people can get (see table below), but government is still drawing up the final list of beneficiaries. It will take weeks to distribute such aid to 18 million households. (A similar lag happened in the distribution of unconditional cash transfers of the 2017 TRAIN law.)</p>
<p>Businesses – especially smaller ones – are also beginning to fold. Delivery trucks are held up at checkpoints, container vans stranded at ports.</p>
<p>There’s also no specific financial assistance earmarked for firms in the Bayanihan law. Congress still needs to craft a separate bill for this purpose, but lawmakers may not convene again until May – by which time many businesses will already have gone bankrupt.</p>
<p>Finally, medical supplies such as personal protective equipment also remain unacceptably scarce as our frontliners continue to valiantly fight COVID-19.</p>
<p>Delays may yet worsen. On April 1 Duterte ordered that all donations to the national government or health department of medicines and medical equipment be directed to one central office: the Office of Civil Defense. But our frontliners need these supplies urgently, and this new regulation could only add another needless layer of bureaucracy in the process.</p>
<p>At least 17 doctors have already died due to the disease, yet Duterte even had to the gall to say they were “lucky” to have died for the country. Quite the opposite: they were unlucky.</p>
<p>If only government had prepared for and responded earlier to the epidemic, many of our frontliners need not have died.</p>
<p>Governance crisis</p>
<p>At the end of the day, money is not really the issue here. There should be more than enough sources of emergency funds.</p>
<p>The real problem is that entering the third week since the initial lockdown, Duterte has yet to show any comprehensive, detailed plan to allocate and distribute disaster relief for the tens of millions of Filipinos who need support ASAP.</p>
<p>Worse, Duterte seems to be confusing the real enemy. In a surprise address on April 1, Duterte (presumably triggered by the riot at Sitio San Roque earlier that day) ordered his troops to shoot anyone who violates quarantine rules.</p>
<p>Today we’re enduring two types of crises: one in public health, another in governance. Unsettlingly, I can’t tell which is worse now. – Rappler.com</p>

<h3 id="duterte-presses-on-with-drug-war-despite-coronavirus-lockdown">Duterte presses on with &lsquo;drug war&rsquo; despite coronavirus lockdown</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2020/3/31/a10bdff98f5145fc918d641910a07227_18.jpg" alt="img">
This grim image has become all too familiar in the Philippines&rsquo;s poorer neighbourhoods: the body of a barefoot, shirtless man, slumped against a wall with blood dripping from bullet wounds, the latest victim of President Rodrigo Duterte&rsquo;s unrelenting anti-illegal drugs campaign that has killed thousands.</p>
<p>On the morning of Sunday, March 23, police and anti-narcotics enforcers from the central island of Cebu carried out an operation against a &ldquo;high-value individual&rdquo;.</p>
<p>More:</p>
<p>The &ldquo;buy-bust&rdquo; mission resulted in an &ldquo;armed confrontation&rdquo; and the killing of the suspect, Buen Chiong, according to a Cebu provincial police report obtained by Al Jazeera. Police added that Chiong was on their &ldquo;provincial-level watchlist&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Cebu radio station, DYSS, quoted authorities as saying that the suspect was linked to &ldquo;drug trading and burglary&rdquo; in his community. Al Jazeera also learned that a calibre .45 pistol was recovered from the scene of the shooting - a detail missing in the police report, which initially misspelt the dead man&rsquo;s name as Buena.</p>
<p>Chiong&rsquo;s death was filed under Control Number 20002-032020-0502.</p>
<p>Amid a national health emergency due to the coronavirus pandemic, there is no stopping Duterte&rsquo;s so-called deadly &ldquo;war on drugs&rdquo; and human rights advocates are warning that the outbreak and the lockdown that followed would &ldquo;exacerbate social inequality&rdquo; in the country, leading to further human rights abuses.</p>
<p>Right groups are urging Duterte to immediately stop the &ldquo;drug war&rdquo; and ensure that the coronavirus containment measures being implemented adhere to the standards set by the United Nations and World Health Organization.</p>
<p>Since Duterte declared a partial lockdown starting on March 15, Al Jazeera has learned that at least eight other people, including two police officers, have been killed by unknown gunmen under suspicious circumstances in Cebu Province alone. One of the fatalities was previously in jail due to a drug-related case.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Killing without consequence&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reports of drug-related killings continuing amid the lockdown order are deeply concerning, but not surprising,&rdquo; Rachel Chhoa-Howard of Amnesty International told Al Jazeera in a statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The climate of impunity in the Philippines is so entrenched that police and others remain free to kill without consequence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the latest report published in mid-December 2019, at least 5,552 people have been killed during police operations since Duterte came to office on June 30, 2016. However, an earlier report published in June 2019 already showed a death toll of 6,600. Meanwhile, rights advocates say at least 27,000 people were killed as of mid-2019 - including the victims killed by unknown gunmen.</p>
<p>The president himself has repeatedly promised that his &ldquo;drug war&rdquo; will last until the final day of his presidency. As recent as early March, he was quoted on separate occasions saying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be president, if you can&rsquo;t kill&rdquo; and that it was his job &ldquo;to scare people, to intimidate people, and to kill people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since then, the attention of the country has shifted to the battle against the coronavirus, which has already killed 88 Filipinos as of March 31, forcing the lockdown of the entire northern island of Luzon, with 57 million people. Provincial and town executives also imposed similar measures in their own communities, putting virtually the entire country of 104 million people under quarantine.</p>
<p>Brazen attacks</p>
<p>Marit Stinus Cabugon, a Cebu-based columnist for a national newspaper, said the anti-drug police operations, as well as the extrajudicial killings have been going on in her province for a while. What was surprising was the brazenness of the recent attacks given the lockdown and the heightened security across the country, she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The killers were not afraid that they would get caught, or stopped at checkpoints,&rdquo; said Stinus Cabugon, who has compiled an online list of killings in Cebu since 2018. She said most of the killings were drug-related.</p>

<p>Since she started compiling a list in June 2018, Stinus Cabugon has recorded at least 159 fatalities during police anti-drug operations, 399 extrajudicial killings mostly linked to drugs and 114 other murders and homicides in and around Cebu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All my years in Cebu, we&rsquo;ve never experienced anything like this,&rdquo; said the longtime Cebu resident and native of Denmark, who previously worked with the International Labour Organization.</p>
<p>Among the most recent incidents she documented was the killing of Bobby Badajos on March 21. The 45-year-old driver of an electric-powered rickshaw was shot by four unidentified assailants on two motorcycles, according to a news report.</p>
<p>Police Major Gerard Ace Pelare, the station chief in the area where Badajos was killed, told reporters the killing could be drug-related. But relatives told The Freeman, a Cebu newspaper, that Badajos was no longer involved in the drug trade after being released from jail last year on a plea bargain agreement.</p>
<p>Badajos&rsquo; daughter, Rica, wrote on social media: &ldquo;I know you are not perfect, but for us you&rsquo;re already perfect, you&rsquo;re the best father. Pa, nobody&rsquo;s going to wake me up any more every morning before school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not worth saving&rsquo;</p>
<p>Two hours after Badajos was killed, a police corporal named Marlon Belleres was also killed by an unknown gunman in the same district. Belleres was the second officer killed in seven days. In the early hours of March 15, Police Corporal Vincent delos Reyes Arboladura was shot dead while driving home.</p>
<p>In another incident on March 19 in Cebu, a man&rsquo;s body was dumped in a gutter with his hands tied at the back and a gunshot to his head - similar to numerous victims dumped in the dark alleys of Metro Manila, when the &ldquo;drug war&rdquo; began during the second part of 2016.</p>
<p>On March 26, 19-year-old Denver Aying was killed in the Lapu-Lapu district of Cebu. A relative wrote on social media that it was drug-related, but the victim&rsquo;s brother disputed the claim.</p>
<p>Carlos Conde of Human Rights Watch in the Philippines said that while it might seem ironic that the killings are going on at a time when the government is trying to save lives from the deadly coronavirus, &ldquo;it is not hard to see&rdquo; it from the perspective of the president.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has pretty much put them in a category that deprived them of their sense of humanity, so he doesn&rsquo;t view them as worth saving,&rdquo; Conde told Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>He added that even before the coronavirus emergency, the &ldquo;intensity of the killings&rdquo; in Cebu had already raised alarm.</p>
<p>Police Corporal Marlon Belleres was killed by an unknown gunman on March 21, the second officer slain within one week in Cebu [Courtesy of Gabriel Bonjoc]</p>
<p>&ldquo;The problem in Cebu is that unlike Manila, there aren&rsquo;t a lot of NGOs, civil societies and human rights groups that monitor these killings in Cebu. So a lot of them are unreported,&rdquo; Conde said.</p>
<p>But the killings in Cebu follow the same pattern as in Metro Manila, with the same kind of people being singled out - mostly those living in sprawling slum areas - he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The government should stop the &lsquo;drug war&rsquo;, especially that this point when these communities are suffering from COVID-19,&rdquo; Conde said, warning the way Duterte&rsquo;s emergency declaration is being set up allows the authorities &ldquo;a lot of leeway to pretty much do whatever they want&rdquo; thus increasing the &ldquo;potential of misuse&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There would be justice&rsquo;</p>
<p>In an interview with Manila-based radio station DZMM on Tuesday, Police Lieutenant General Guillermo Eleazar, commander of the Joint Task Force Corona Virus Shield, declared that since the declaration of the lockdown, crimes have declined by 52 percent across the entire country.</p>
<p>He also warned those who violated curfew measures during the lockdown that they would be punished, while promising that the police would &ldquo;not abuse its authority&rdquo; in enforcing the law.</p>
<p>Stinus Cabugon, the newspaper columnist based in Cebu, conceded that with the coronavirus health emergency, it would become even harder to report and gather information about drug-related killings in her community.</p>
<p>She said that with the lockdown, many residents of Cebu were now faced with overwhelming economic hardship and would be preoccupied with simply surviving.</p>
<p>Just the same, she vowed to continue her work documenting the deadly &ldquo;drug war&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I didn&rsquo;t have to add names to the list,&rdquo; she told Al Jazeera. &ldquo;I hope that one day, we will really get to the bottom of it, and there would be justice, and whoever was responsible for mass murder, would also be held accountable.&rdquo;
