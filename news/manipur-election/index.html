<p>Former Congress chief minister of Manipur and CLP leader Okram Ibobi Singh will approach Governor Najma Heptullah to call a special Assembly session to floor a no-confidence motion against the N Biren Singh-led BJP government.</p>
<p>This comes soon after three BJP MLAs resigned from the Assembly and party membership to join the Congress.</p>
<p>One of the BJP’s main allies, the National People’s Party (NPP), withdrew its support and pledged support to the Congress. The NPP’s four MLAs are all cabinet ministers, including Deputy Chief Minister Y Joykumar Singh.</p>

<p>The Biren Singh government was formed after the 2017 Assembly election, with the BJP winning only 21 seats in the 60-member Assembly. The Congress was the single largest party with 28 seats. Immediately after the election, one Congress MLA defected to the BJP. A TMC MLA, along with the four NPP MLAs and four MLAs of Naga People’s Front (a BJP ally in Nagaland), helped prop up the BJP’s first government in the Northeast.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, apart from the three BJP MLAs and NPP, the TMC MLA and an independent MLA from Jiribam withdrew support. The Manipur Assembly has a current strength of 59 MLAs after Shyamkumar Singh of Andro constituency, who had defected to BJP from Congress, was disqualified.</p>
<p>The three BJP MLAs who resigned are T T Haokip, S Subaschandra Singh and Samuel Jendai. Haokip, speaking at a press conference in Imphal flanked by the two others, said, “I tendered my resignation on my own volition.” When asked why they took the decision, Haokip declined to comment further.</p>

<p>Trouble had been brewing for Biren Singh, with several attempts to dethrone him from within the party. This was resolved after the intervention of central BJP leaders. But on April 9, the CM divested the Deputy CM of all his portfolios, including environment, forest and climate change, and transferred them to himself.</p>
<p>Y Joykumar told The Indian Express, “The CM had promised 5 kg rice to everyone and assured there would be no shortage during lockdown, but that was not the case. I raised the matter… Soon after, he took away my portfolios. BJP members had called for our resignation from the government. More recently, Biren told us that after the Rajya Sabha election all NPP ministers would be dropped from the cabinet. The BJP keeps attacking its own allies. How could we accept this behaviour?”</p>
<p>Incidentally, Joykumar was DG Police of Manipur during Ibobi’s tenure and has a close working relationship with the former CM. Meanwhile, Ibobi claimed the Congress now has the support of 30 MLAs, including 20 of its own. Apart from one Congress MLA who had defected right after the election, seven others had pledged support to the Biren government while remaining Congress MLAS.</p>

<p>“In the Assembly, officially they tell us they are Congress MLAs. The matter is in court – either they will be disqualified, or they are Congress MLAs. In any case, they are not BJP MLAs,” Ibobi told The Indian Express. He added that with their new support, the Congress could now stake claim to form the government.</p>
<p>With three MLAs leaving, the BJP’s number is down to 19. They have the support of an LJP MLA and four NPF MLAs.</p>
<p>“There is no problem in calling a special Assembly session while maintaining social distancing because we had constructed a 100-seat Assembly in our tenure, and there are 52 MLAs (barring the seven who are not allowed to enter the Assembly while awaiting verdict) who can actually vote. If the BJP is confident of their numbers, we don’t have a problem. But let them prove it,” said Ibobi.</p>
<p>When contacted, a senior BJP leader said, “There is some difficulty as far as numbers are concerned, but we don’t feel there is a threat.” Manipur BJP vice-president Asnikumar Moirangthem declined to comment.</p>

IMPHAL: Manipur HC on Monday barred seven Congress MLAs who had switched over to the ruling BJP in 2017 from entering the state legislative assembly until their disqualification cases are disposed of by the speaker&rsquo;s tribunal.</p>
<p>With this verdict, the seven MLAs will not be able to cast their vote in the upcoming Rajya Sabha polls on June 19, political analysts said. The seven MLAs - S Bira, Ginsuanhau, Oinam Lukhoi, Ngamthang Haokip, Yengkhom Surchandra , Kshetrimayum Biren and Paonam Brojen Singh - who won on Congress tickets in the 2017 state assembly polls had defected to BJP and helped formation of the coalition government led by the saffron party.</p>
<p>The order followed a bunch of miscellaneous applications and petitions filed by the opposition Congress MLAs, asking the court to ban the seven defectors from entering the assembly premises, case dossiers read.</p>
<p>The high court, headed by Justice Kh Nobin Singh, ruled that unless and until the petitions are decided and disposed of finally by the speaker, the seven MLAs are &ldquo;restrained from entering the Manipur Legislative Assembly, Imphal.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Hon&rsquo;ble Speaker, Manipur Legislative Assembly is directed to ensure compliance of this order by all concerned,&rdquo; the judgment added.</p>

<p>Updated: Jun 17, 2020 02:23 IST</p>
<p>From mock election training sessions to isolation rooms and separate voting booths, states are gearing up for the upcoming Rajya Sabha elections in the backdrop of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).</p>
<p>The elections, to be held on June 19, will be the first major voting exercise since the pandemic. Nearly 1,000 legislators will vote across eight states — Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Rajasthan.</p>
<p>While it is the health department of each state that is overseeing preparations, Election Commission officials, too, are extra vigilant. The commission has appointed a nodal officer in each state to ensure Covid-19 guidelines are strictly followed.</p>
<p>In Madhya Pradesh, where one MLA has tested positive for Covid-19, a health team will be present in the secretariat in case of medical emergencies.</p>
<p>“The MLA will be brought in last to vote,” an Election Commission official told HT on the condition of anonymity. “A separate polling booth is planned for the MLA, and all the elections officials present (when the MLA comes to the booth) will be wearing PPE (personal protective equipment) suits. The MLA, too, will be in PPE and will travel by ambulance, which will be sanitised properly.”</p>
<p>In Gujarat, where three MLAs have tested positive, discussions are still on to “finalise the arrangements”, additional chief electoral officer Ashok Manek said.</p>
<p>Amit Chavda, the Congress’s Gujarat president and a legislator, said the party has requested the poll watchdog to make separate arrangements for MLAs who have tested positive.</p>
<p>Officials in other states, too, are on alert.</p>
<p>In Andhra Pradesh, a special health team will be present to tackle exigencies, if any. “The polling staff will wear PPE suits and a separate isolation room has been created for emergencies,” said chief electoral officer (CEO) K Vijayanand. “Although there are no cases as yet, we are making sure we are prepared.”</p>
<p>MLAs will be provided with a mask and sanitizer upon arrival. In case an MLA is quarantined before the election, a sanitised vehicle will be provided for her/his travel and s/he will voted in a separate room, Vijayanand added.</p>
<p>In Meghalaya, along with sanitizer and mask, MLAs will also be provided a booklet on Covid-19 guidelines containing the dos and don’ts. “Holding room, medical room in case of medical eventualities have been arranged, and a contingency plan for alternative location has also been drawn up,” CEO F Kharkongor said.</p>
<p>Manipur CEO Prashant Kumar Singh, too, said the state will release a detailed booklet on preventive measures. “The officials will wear face shields,” Singh added.</p>
<p>In Rajasthan, a larger polling booth has been made and a dispensary set up. “A medical team will be present, and in case anyone shows signs of Covid-19, they will be taken directly to the dispensary,” Rajasthan CEO Arun Kumar said.

<p>Manipur and Meghalaya with one seat each, Andhara Pradesh 4, Gujarat 4, Jharkhand 2, Madhya Pradesh 3, and Rajasthan 3 will go for polling on June 19.</p>
<p>Elections to elect Rajya Sabha members from these seven states were supposed to be held on March 26, but considering the prevailing unforeseen situation of public health emergency due to COVID-19, the Election Commission had deferred the poll.</p>
<p>The poll panel extended the period of said election under the provisions of section 153 of the Act.</p>
<p>The list of contesting candidates already published for the said election by the respective Returning Officers, is to remain valid for the purpose of remaining activities as was prescribed under the said notification.</p>
<p>“Now, Commission has reviewed the matter in detail. Considering all factors, including the guidelines issued on May 30, issued by Union Home Secretary and Chairman, national Executive Committee (NEC) under the National Disaster Management Act, 2005, and taking into account the inputs obtained from the Chief Electoral Officers concerned, the Commission has decided to conduct the poll,” said the ECI.</p>
<p>The polling will take place between 9 p.m to 4 p.m on June 19 and counting of votes will take place on the same day at 5 p.m.</p>
<p>“By June 22 election shall be completed,” the EC said.</p>
<p>The Commission has also said that the Chief Secretaries shall depute a senior officer from the State to ensure that the extant instructions regarding COVID-19 containment measures are complied with while making arrangements for conducting the elections.</p>
<p>Further Commission has appointed Chief Electoral Officer concerned as Observer for the election in the respective State.
