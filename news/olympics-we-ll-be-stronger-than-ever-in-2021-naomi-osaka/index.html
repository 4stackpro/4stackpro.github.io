<p>TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese tennis player Naomi Osaka, the poster girl of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, took to social media on Saturday to show her support for the decision to postpone the Games until next year</p>
<p>Osaka, who won the U.S. Open in 2018 and the Australian Open in 2019, was the central character in the video to launch Tokyo 2020’s official motto for the Games, launched last month.</p>
<p>Scroll to continue with content Ad</p>
<p>The coronavirus has since spread across the world, however, leading to last week&rsquo;s decision by the Japanese government and International Olympic Committee to postpone the Games.</p>
<p>“Everyone knows how much the Olympics means to me and how proud I will be to participate in my home country,” Osaka, the world number 10, wrote on Twitter.</p>
<p>“Of course, I am disappointed that it won’t happen this year but we’ll all be ready to stronger ever in 2021! I support Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s brave decision and the IOC 100%.</p>
<p>“Sport will eventually unite us again and be there for us always, but that time not now,” the 22-year-old added.</p>
<p>“This is the time for people from all countries, backgrounds and races to rally together to save as many lives as we can. To me, that is the Olympic spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the people of Japan: stay strong, hang in there, and let&rsquo;s the show the world our beautiful country when time is right in 2021.”</p>
<p>Osaka, the first Asian to be ranked world number one, concluded with a message for her 500,000 plus Twitter followers.</p>
<p>“Stay safe everyone, take care of each other, be kind and we will make it through. Love, Naomi.”</p>
<p>Osaka, who was born in Japan to a Haitian father and Japanese mother before being raised in the United States, was chosen to lead Tokyo 2020’s &ldquo;United by Emotion&rdquo; motto as the face of a changing country.</p>
<p>Japan, which has traditionally seen itself as a racially homogeneous country, is becoming more ethnically diverse and Osaka has been at the forefront of a new wave of sporting heroes set to represent the host nation at the Olympics.</p>
<p>Story continues</p>
<p>Coronavirus infections in Japan have climbed to more than 1,400, with 47 deaths.</p>

<h3 id="i-know-hes-going-to-come-back-stronger-demarcus-ware-expects-bradley-chubb-to-improve-after-return-from-injury">&lsquo;I know he&rsquo;s going to come back stronger&rsquo;: DeMarcus Ware expects Bradley Chubb to improve after return from injury</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/private/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/broncos/qqg0we5umzwsfjyvkrif" alt="img">
ENGLEWOOD, Colo. — Four games into 2019, Bradley Chubb had his second NFL season cut short.</p>
<p>In an October game against the Jaguars, Chubb suffered a partial tear to his ACL. While he finished the game, his season was over.</p>
<p>Chubb was placed on injured reserve the following week and underwent surgery soon after. He&rsquo;s since started to rehab, with his eyes on a 2020 return to the type of dominant play he offered as a rookie.</p>
<p>As the fifth-overall pick from NC State, Chubb recorded a franchise rookie record with 12 sacks in 2018.</p>
<p>Chubb has progressed in his rehab over the previous few months, and Head Coach Vic Fangio said at the 2020 NFL Combine that he&rsquo;d be shocked if Chubb isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;as good as new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fangio also said he doesn&rsquo;t expect Chubb to participate in any &ldquo;football stuff&rdquo; until training camp.</p>
<p>A former Broncos outside linebacker knows what it will take for Chubb to return to his previous form when he finally gets to the field. DeMarcus Ware, who served as a pass-rush consultant for the Broncos in 2018, worked with Chubb as a rookie. And he knows Chubb has what it takes to make his way back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing is the mentality of &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t be stopped,'&rdquo; Ware said last week. &ldquo;And I know that Bradley Chubb, he has that mentality. No matter what type of injury you have, you can come back from it if you work hard enough, and I know he&rsquo;s going to come back stronger. Just from talking to him, he&rsquo;s working out really, really hard. Even for me being a pass-rush consultant there with the Denver Broncos, I knew that he was going to be special. You can see year after year, he actually improved monumentally. Now I know that, especially with Von [Miller] going through an injury like that as well, I know Von is actually there teaching him and telling him, &lsquo;Hey, this is how and what I did coming from this injury.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s one thing a lot of guys don&rsquo;t have, is another guy that&rsquo;s actually experienced it.
