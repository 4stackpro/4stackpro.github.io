<p>He and his longtime girlfriend, Georgia Groome, are expecting their first child</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some absolutely wicked news: Rupert Grint is going to be a dad!</p>
<p>Giphy</p>
<p>On Friday (April 10), Us Weekly confirmed that the former Harry Potter star and his longtime girlfriend, Georgia Groome, are expecting their first child together. A publicist for the pair told the outlet, &ldquo;Rupert Grint and Georgia Groome are excited to announce they are expecting a baby and would please ask for privacy at this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speculation about the couple&rsquo;s baby news began earlier this week, when Groome was photographed in London with a growing baby bump. She and Grint, a notably private couple, previously sparked wedding rumors after they were spotted wearing matching rings last year.</p>
<p>Grint, 31, and Groome, 28, have been dating since 2011. The British actress is best known for playing Georgia Nicholson in the 2008 flick Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging, while Grint is forever beloved for his role as Ron Weasley in the Harry Potter franchise. In more recent years, the actor has beefed up his TV résumé by starring in shows like Servant, Sick Note, and Snatch.</p>
<p>In 2018, Grint opened up about starting a family in an interview with The Guardian. He said, &ldquo;I’d like to settle down and have kids soon. If I had a son, would I call him Ron? It’s quite a good name, but probably not. And Grint’s a tough name to pair a one-syllable first name with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Congratulations to the happy couple on their magical baby news!

<h3 id="where-does-rupert-grint-live-and-how-big-is-his-house">Where does Rupert Grint live and how big is his house?</h3>
<p><img src="https://img3.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/where-does-rupert-grint-live-and-how-big-is-his-house/intro-1586378895.jpg" alt="img">
Where does Rupert Grint live and how big is his house?</p>
<p>The Harry Potter film franchise not only made its cast famous, but it also made them a lot of money, and that certainly applies to Rupert Grint, who was just 11 years old when he stepped into the role of Ron Weasley. With all that cash, all three of the starring actors — Grint, Daniel Radcliffe, and Emma Watson — went on to purchase their fair share of pricey properties.</p>
<p>Grint told Barron&rsquo;s in 2017 that he &ldquo;grew up in apartments,&rdquo; and while we don&rsquo;t know how big or how luxurious (or how small and humble) those family homes were, they likely didn&rsquo;t compare to the place that he picked up as an adult.</p>
<p>When the actor heads back to his pad after a day of filming his latest project, he can retire to his 18th-century mansion, which he bought for £5.4 million (around $6.7 million in U.S. dollars). Located on 22 acres of land, the house features five reception rooms, six bedroom suites, and both indoor and outdoor swimming pools, according to a Daily Mail report from 2013. As impressive as that sounds, it&rsquo;s far from the only property that Grint owns.
