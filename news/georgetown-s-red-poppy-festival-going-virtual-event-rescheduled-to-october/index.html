<h3 id="roadside-anzac-tributes-pop-up-around-lower-hutt-suburb-following-covid-19-service-cancellations">Roadside Anzac tributes pop up around Lower Hutt suburb following Covid-19 service cancellations</h3>
<p><img src="https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/2/0/6/9/j/r/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.205uyr.png/1587621991380.jpg" alt="img">
Jacinda Ardern says the cancellation of services doesn’t mean people can’t pay tribute.</p>
<p>With a little plastic tubing, corflute sheets and a paint bucket lid, Peter Tubby is finding a way to remember the fallen under lockdown.</p>
<p>In the Lower Hutt suburb of Wainuiomata red poppies adorn windows, berms and fences, as people find ways to commemorate Anzac Day during lockdown, without the help of official ceremonies.</p>
<p>The tallest poppy in the valley probably belongs to Tubby. Made from plastic tubing, corflute sheets and the lid from a paint bucket it stands over 2 metres tall.</p>
<p>ROSA WOODS Former RNZAF technician Peter Tubby put up his giant ANZAC poppy as a mark of respect in lieu of being able to attend a service.</p>
<p>The former Royal New Zealand Air Force technician said the fence decoration is his way of paying respect to New Zealand&rsquo;s service people in lieu of being able to attend a commemoration parade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;[ANZAC Day] is one of the few times each year we can pay tribute to those people that kept our country safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ROSA WOODS Former RNZAF technician Peter Tubby with his own service medal worn on the left side of his chest and the meals of his father and grandfather on his right.</p>
<p>It is also a tribute to his family&rsquo;s military service.</p>
<p>His grandfather - a gunner in the Royal Field Artillery - fought in World War One and died after the conflict from complications after being gassed. His father was a product of New Zealand&rsquo;s compulsory military training scheme.</p>
<p>The Returned and Services&rsquo; Association and Defence Force has been encouraging the public to decorate their letterboxes as part of their Stand At Dawn campaign in the lead up to this year&rsquo;s Anzac Day.</p>
<p>STUFF Auckland landmarks will light up red to mark Anzac Day as services across the country have been cancelled due to the coronavirus lockdown.</p>
<p>With official services having been cancelled to stop the spread of coronavirus the organisations have suggested people stand in their bubbles at 6am to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>Wainuiomata Valley RSA president Bart Bartlett said up to 2000 people attended services around Wainuiomata each Anzac Day. However, this year commemorations would have to be contained within individual households.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Its &lsquo;a bit of a shame but that&rsquo;s the way it has to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ROSA WOODS Wainuiomata Valley RSA president Bart Bartlett will be standing on his driveway by his poppies at dawn in Anzac Day.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d be standing in his driveway next to the four plastic poppies attached to his fence.</p>
<p>Recognition of Anzac Day had grown in recent years particularly among young people, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just us old [service people] turning out to parades anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ROSA WOODS Charlie Ngaheke, 9, created an ANZAC display outside his grandfather&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Charlie Ngaheke, 9, set up his tribute of white crosses, red poppies and a sign reading &ldquo;Lest we forget. They gave their today for our tomorrow&rdquo; outside his pop&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s to remember the fallen soldiers,&rdquo; he said.

Sky Tower Turns Into A Poppy For ANZAC Day</p>
<p>Sky Tower - Poppy Lighting.</p>
<p>From Friday 24th April until Sunday 26th April, the Sky Tower will be lit as a large Poppy to show support for ANZAC day and the RNZRSA.</p>
<p>The poppy is a symbol of remembrance and hope and SkyCity is proud to show support for our current and ex-service personnel, including the NZ Police and their families, by lighting the tower, alongside the Auckland Museum, Harbour Bridge and the Light path.</p>
