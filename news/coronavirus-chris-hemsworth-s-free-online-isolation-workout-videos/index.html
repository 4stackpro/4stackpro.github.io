With most people now cooped up indoors with bootcamp classes banned and gyms closed, you might be looking for ways to keep fit during isolation.</p>
<p>One celebrity who’s known for his hardcore training sessions has your workout sorted.</p>
<p>See more in the video above</p>
<p>Thor star Chris Hemsworth is offering up six weeks free on his fitness program Centr, to get Aussies moving.</p>
<p>But these are no ordinary workouts.</p>
<p>Teaming up with trainer Luke Zocchi, who got Hemsworth’s body ready to play Thor, the pair push the limits for a full-body workout.</p>
<p>The unique workout clips use everyday household items as training tools.</p>
<p>“We use laundry liquid, cans of beans, two-litre juice bottles&hellip;anything with a bit of weight - you’ve got to get creative at times like this,” Zocchi told Weekend Sunrise.</p>
<p>With most movie and television productions shut down for the foreseeable future, Zocchi said making the videos was a great way to keep their minds active while helping others.</p>

<p>“I think being healthy and fit goes a long way, besides physically, mentally - the benefits you get from staying healthy and fit are massive.</p>
<p>“I think in a time like this, when we’re all a bit uncertain, getting out there and training a bit just clears your mind and puts you in a good mindset.”</p>
<p>To sign up for the free six-week trial, head to the Centr website.

<h3 id="how-hard-are-chris-hemsworths-home-workouts">How hard are Chris Hemsworth’s home workouts?</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.irishexaminer.com/remote/content.assets.pressassociation.io/2020/03/27093147/b0d709f6-a028-4e9b-af48-ae046a627853.jpg?crop=0,467,5760,3707&amp;ext=.jpg&amp;width=648&amp;s=ie-990929" alt="img">
With gyms closed and outdoor exercise limited in may parts of the world at the moment, most of us are trying to find ways to keep up with our usual fitness routines at home.</p>
<p>Anyone who follows Chris Hemsworth on Instagram will, of course, know that the Marvel star takes his fitness regime pretty seriously. The Thor actor has one of the most enviable physiques in the game, thanks to a gruelling workout schedule that he often shares with fans on social media – so if anyone’s going to put us through are paces, we reckon it’s him.</p>
<p>Luckily he has an app called Centr which promises to give just as good a workout as a boutique gym – but all from the comfort and safety of your home.</p>
<p>He’s currently giving away access to the full workouts and recipe ideas for free for six weeks (if you sign up by March 31) or it’s £97 (€108) for a year after that.</p>
<p>I tried out a lunchtime workout at home to find out just how hard his fitness programme really is.</p>
<p>How does the app work?</p>
<p>First up, I enter my vitals (height, weight, sex) and goal (to get fit and toned), then select a dietary preference (vegan) and a workout intensity (intermediate).</p>
<p>The app then pulls in all of that information to create a really concise weekly planner of workouts, recipes and meditations that are plotted into an easy-to-follow, daily plan. The Centr interface (Centr/PA)</p>
<p>From here, I can scroll through my upcoming workouts and recipes, check out any newly added videos and swap out any activities I don’t fancy taking part in – like a HIIT strength session on a Sunday morning.</p>
<p>Workouts range from 20 to 40 minutes and are led either by Hemsworth himself, his wife Elsa Pataky or a team of trainers.</p>
<p>You can either follow along with the daily sessions the app digitally assigns to you, or you can search through the workout section to find something different. There’s over 1,000 workouts in total, with everything from boxing and HIIT to yoga and strength training on offer.</p>
<p>Like a lot of fitness apps, you can set your own personal goals and log your progress as you continue, and the app can also sync with your Apple Watch data.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that many of the workouts require equipment like dumbbells, battle ropes, cable pulls and pull up bars, but you can filter based on the equipment that’s available to you.</p>
<p>You can also choose between a coached (full-length videos to follow) or self-guided (images and clips to move through at your own pace).</p>
<p>I select a 35-minute bodyweight workout, since I don’t have any weights to hand. The workout involved cycling through three clusters of exercises, with three rounds of each – 40 seconds of work and 20 seconds of rest. Side gorillas – just one of the challenging moves (Liz Connor/PA)</p>
<p>The app previews the exercise and then counts you in with a timer and the instructor does the moves alongside you so you can check your form.</p>
<p>Lunge jumps, crawls, hostage squats, ballistic pulses and side gorillas are just a few of the gruelling moves that trainer Da Rulk challenges me with.</p>
<p>After 35 minutes I’m red-faced and gasping for breath, but feeling like I’ve had just as good of a workout as I’d get at a specialist HIIT gym. The intermediate workouts are really hard, so expect to break a decent sweat if you opt for this level like me. Three rounds of pulsing hostage squats is never fun (Liz Connor/PA)</p>
<p>Overall, I really enjoyed the pace of the class and I felt challenged to do better next time.</p>
<p>Aside from the workouts, one thing I love about Centr is its food ideas. I signed up to the vegan menu in an effort to cut down on my meat consumption and was genuinely surprised at how appealing all the recipes looked.</p>
<p>A typical day’s food includes a raspberry coconut smoothie, broccolini salad with tahini dressing and roast cauliflower. Plus there’s a whole menu of healthy snacks to add into your plan too. Recipes on the app (Centr/PA)</p>
<p>Paired with the mindfulness section, which offers meditations for sleep, stress and confidence, plus the wealth of wellbeing articles and podcasts available to members, Centr really does make living a healthy lifestyle both accessible appealing to anyone on lockdown.</p>
<p>I really liked how it helped me to find some structure to the day while working from home and I’m already looking forward to my next workout session – even if it does have me wincing in pain the next day

A lot of us aren&rsquo;t ever as active as we probably should be, but with large parts of the country and the world staying home, even those of us that normally get a decent amount of exercise are likely needing to be quite creative to stay active. Luckily, Thor is here to help us all out. Chris Hemsworth has posted a brief video that might inspire some to get more exercise even while stuck at home, something other celebrities have been hesitant to do.
