White House coronavirus task force member Dr. Anthony Fauci on Tuesday pushed back on President Trump’s optimistic projection of soon reopening the nation’s economy — saying the US still lacks enough coronavirus testing materials and tracing procedures to make that possible.</p>
<p>“We have to have something in place that is efficient and that we can rely on, and we’re not there yet,” Fauci said in an interview with the Associated Press.</p>
<p>The comments by the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases come as Team Trump weighs how quickly businesses can reopen and Americans can get back to work.</p>
<p>The president has mentioned the possibility of reopening some parts of the country by May 1 and said he could announce recommendations by this week.</p>
<p>During Monday’s coronavirus briefing at the White House, Trump claimed “total authority” over when to relax restrictions and restart the economy.</p>
<p>Fauci said a May 1 target was “a bit overly optimistic” for many areas of the US, adding that any easing off social-distancing rules would have to occur on a “rolling” basis, not all at once.</p>
<p>His main concern is that a premature reopening would bring new outbreaks in areas where social distancing has eased, but public health officials don’t yet have the means to rapidly test for the virus, isolate new cases and track down everyone whom an infected person came into contact with.</p>
<p>“I’ll guarantee you, once you start pulling back, there will be infections. It’s how you deal with the infections that’s going count,” Fauci told the AP.</p>
<p>The key is “getting people out of circulation if they get infected, because once you start getting clusters, then you’re really in trouble,” he said.</p>
<p>Fauci — who on Monday said he had used “a poor choice of words” in a CNN interview that prompted Trump to retweet a #FireFauci hashtag — told the AP that the president’s lengthy news briefings were “really draining.”</p>
<p>“If I had been able to just make a few comments and then go to work, that would have really been much better,” he told the news outlet. “It isn’t the idea of being there and answering questions, which I really think is important for the American public. It’s the amount of time.”</p>
<p>Much of the 79-year-old’s time outside the briefing room is focused on analyzing progress on blood tests that aim to reveal who was exposed to the coronavirus by spotting antibodies their immune systems formed to fight back.</p>
<p>The tests will be crucial in determining when and how people can return to work, but Fauci cautioned that most of the tests have not yet been proven to work well.</p>
<p>Fauci said his staff has been working with the Food and Drug Administration to validate the serology tests, which check for proteins in the immune system through a blood sample.</p>
<p>The presence of proteins means a person was exposed to the coronavirus and developed antibodies against it, which may mean the person has at least some immunity.</p>
<p>Fauci and his team are seeking to prove what level of antibodies it takes to really be immune; if particular types of antibodies are vital rather than an overall level; and how long that protection lasts.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have to find out the answer to all of those questions,” Fauci said. “I know people are anxious to say, ‘Well, we’ll give you a passport that says you’re antibody-positive, you can go to work and you’re protected.’”</p>
<p>He added: “The worst possibility that would happen is if we’re actually wrong about that” and those people get infected.</p>
<p>Scientists also still don’t fully understand how often people who show either no obvious symptoms or very few symptoms are spreading the virus.</p>
<p>It’s “purely a guesstimate,” but no less than 25 percent and no more than half of overall cases may be from the relatively asymptomatic, he said.</p>
<p>Fauci said a second wave of infection isn’t inevitable.</p>
<p>But he added: “If you mean it goes way down and then come September, October, November, we have another peak, I have to say I would not be surprised. I would hope that if and when that occurs, that we jump all over it in a much, much more effective way than we have in these past few months.”</p>
<p>On Monday, he said he was not criticizing Trump when he said an earlier US shutdown would have saved lives, adding that the president listened to his recommended restrictions.</p>
<p>After Trump tried to shoot down a New York Times article that said he was slow to react to his team’s recommendations about the pandemic, the president gave Fauci a vote of confidence.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Hogan Gidley also said the doctor would not be fired.

<h3 id="fauci-were-not-there-yet-on-key-steps-to-reopen-economy">Fauci: &lsquo;We&rsquo;re not there yet&rsquo; on key steps to reopen economy</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.politico.com/53/99/715c4bcd47fbb8456b8609dbe2ce/ap-faucijpg.jpg" alt="img">
Fauci said a May 1 target is “a bit overly optimistic” for many areas of the country. Any easing off the strict social-distancing rules in place in much of the country would have to occur on a “rolling” basis, not all at once, he said, reflecting the ways COVID-19 struck different parts of the country at different times.</p>
<p>Among Fauci’s top concerns: that there will be new outbreaks in locations where social distancing has eased, but public health officials don’t yet have the capabilities to rapidly test for the virus, isolate any new cases and track down everyone that an infected person came into contact with.</p>
<p>“I’ll guarantee you, once you start pulling back there will be infections. It’s how you deal with the infections that’s going count,” Fauci told the AP.</p>
<p>Key is “getting people out of circulation if they get infected, because once you start getting clusters, then you’re really in trouble,” he added.</p>
<p>At the same time Fauci is directing critical government research, he’s also one of the administration’s leading spokespeople on the virus, spending hours each week by Trump’s side during his lengthy, daily White House briefings.</p>
<p>Fauci said his public role is important but conceded that the duration of those briefings — Monday’s ran for nearly two-and-a-half hours — was “really draining” and that doesn’t even count preparation and waiting for it to start.</p>
<p>“If I had been able to just make a few comments and then go to work, that would have really been much better,” he said. “It isn’t the idea of being there and answering questions, which I really think is important for the American public. It’s the amount of time.”</p>
<p>Much of Fauci’s time outside of the White House briefing room is focused on analyzing progress on blood tests that aim to tell who was exposed to the coronavirus &ndash; whether they knew they were sick or not &ndash; by spotting antibodies their immune system formed to fight back. Those tests will be crucial in determining when and how people can go back to work.</p>
<p>The problem: Most of the tests have not yet been proven to work well, Fauci cautioned. He noted that some countries bought millions of antibody tests only to learn they didn’t work.</p>
<p>Fauci, infectious disease chief at the National Institutes of Health, said his staff is working with the Food and Drug Administration to validate those tests. That means proving what level of antibodies it takes to really be immune; if particular types of antibodies are key rather than an overall level; and how long that protection lasts.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have to find out the answer to all of those questions,” Fauci stressed. “I know people are anxious to say, ‘Well, we’ll give you a passport that says you’re antibody-positive, you can go to work and you’re protected.’ The worst possibility that would happen is if we’re actually wrong about that” and those people get infected.</p>
<p>Another complication is that scientists still don’t have a solid understanding of how often people who show either no obvious symptoms or very few symptoms are spreading the virus. It’s “purely a guesstimate” but no less than 25% and no more than half of overall cases may be from the relatively asymptomatic, he said.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Fauci said a second wave of infection isn’t inevitable. But he added: “if you mean it goes way down and then come September, October, November, we have another peak, I have to say I would not be surprised. I would hope that if and when that occurs, that we jump all over it in a much, much more effective way than we have in these past few months.”

Anthony Fauci warned the Trump administration about the inevitability of a &ldquo;surprise&rdquo; outbreak during a speech in 2017, suggesting that the US needed to do more to prepare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing we&rsquo;re extraordinarily confident about is that we&rsquo;re going to see this in the next few years,&rdquo; Fauci said.</p>
<p>Fauci called infectious diseases a &ldquo;perpetual challenge,&rdquo; specifically pointing out the risks of diseases that haven&rsquo;t been seen before.</p>
<p>Visit Business Insider&rsquo;s homepage for more stories.</p>
<p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned members of the incoming Trump administration in January 2017 about the inevitability of a &ldquo;surprise outbreak&rdquo; of a new disease. He said at the time that the US needed to do more to prepare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no question that there will be a challenge to the coming administration in the arena of infectious diseases,&rdquo; Fauci said during a speech at Georgetown University, adding, &ldquo;the thing we&rsquo;re extraordinarily confident about is that we&rsquo;re going to see this in the next few years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fauci specifically singled out the risks posed by unknown diseases, in addition to those from existing or reemergent ones. Fighting infectious diseases, he said, is a &ldquo;perpetual challenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Responses to past outbreaks like Zika and HIV/AIDS offer lessons for the incoming administration, Fauci added; he has led NIAID since 1984 and advised six US presidents on public-health crises.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The history of the last 32 years that I&rsquo;ve been the director of NIAID will tell the next administration that there&rsquo;s no doubt in anyone&rsquo;s mind that they will be faced with the challenges that their predecessors were faced with,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Fauci called on the Trump administration to prepare the US for such challenges before they arise, by improving global health-surveillance systems, investing in research, and setting aside emergency funds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do need a public-health emergency fund. It&rsquo;s tough to get it &hellip; but we need it,&rdquo; Fauci said. &ldquo;Because what we had to go through for Zika — it was very, very painful when the president asked for the $1.9 billion in February and we didn&rsquo;t get it until September.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Trump administration did not create such a fund, and instead cut spending for federal agencies responsible for detecting and preparing for outbreaks. In May 2018, Trump&rsquo;s national security advisor disbanded the National Security Council&rsquo;s pandemic response team, while in October 2019, the administration declined to renew funding for a pandemic early warning system.</p>
<p>Throughout January, February, and March of this year, Trump downplayed the outbreak in the US, saying, &ldquo;we have it totally under control,&rdquo; &ldquo;it will disappear,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;America will again and soon be open for business.&rdquo; However, Fauci and other top government officials — including health secretary Alex Azar and trade adviser Peter Navarro — have painted a more sobering picture.</p>
<p>In congressional hearings and public press briefings, Fauci has repeatedly contradicted Trump&rsquo;s positive narrative, which has at times seemed to frustrate the president. Trump recently retweeted a call from a Republican congresswoman to fire Fauci after he said the US&rsquo;s slow response to COVID-19 has cost lives.</p>
