<p>&ldquo;Instead of mostly enjoying solo, romantic dates, Chris’ son from early on was a very big part of their dating life,” an insider told PEOPLE in January 2019.</p>
<p>“Katherine is like a big kid and loves doing activities with Jack. She loves that Chris is a dad,” the insider said, adding, “Seeing Chris with Jack made Katherine positive from early on that Chris is ‘the one.’ ”</p>
<p>In addition to celebrating her pregnancy, Schwarzenegger Pratt’s book made the New York Times Best Sellers list for four weeks in a row. She has been on a book tour since March and has now shifted the scheduled events to virtual events amid the coronavirus pandemic.

<p>Pratt, who had been working on Jurassic World: Dominion with co-star Bryce Dallas Howard, is hunkering down at home in California as production on the dinosaur epic has been halted due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>He recently took part in a reunion episode of the comedy Parks And Recreation (2009 to 2015), shot from the homes of the cast to raise money for charity during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Pratt plays Andy Dwyer, a lovable slacker, in the series.</p>
<p>He said on Instagram of the upcoming episode: &ldquo;Many are saying it&rsquo;s the greatest episode of television ever to be filmed in quarantine.&rdquo; – The Straits Times/Asia News Network
