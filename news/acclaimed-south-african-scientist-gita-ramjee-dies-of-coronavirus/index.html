Gita Ramjee, a world-renowned scientist from South Africa, has died due to the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Ramjee died on Tuesday a hospital in Durban on the East Coast, according to local media reports. She was 64.</p>
<p>More:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Professor Ramjee was renowned for her work on finding HIV prevention methods that were conducive to the lifestyles, circumstances and perceived risk factors that South African women face, as well as attempts to find an effective HIV vaccine,&rdquo; Deputy President David Mabuza said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have indeed lost a champion in the fight against the HIV epidemic, ironically at the hands of this global pandemic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ramjee returned to South Africa recently after a trip to London. She did not have any symptoms but fell sick and was admitted to a hospital.</p>
<p>Tributes and condolence messages have been pouring in from across the globe where her work affected millions.</p>
<p>Deeply saddened at the news of the passing of Gita Ramjee. An eminent scientist who dedicated her life to #HIV prevention for women &amp; girls in #Africa &amp; #EndingAIDS. A huge loss at a time when the world needs her most. My condolences to her family, friends &amp; colleagues at @MRCza. https://t.co/cQpAJIrrRR — Winnie Byanyima (@Winnie_Byanyima) March 31, 2020</p>
<p>The Global Advocacy for HIV Prevention (AVAC) said: &ldquo;Deeply saddened by the loss of an HIV prevention pioneer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It described Ramjee as a tireless champion of science, research, women&rsquo;s reproductive health and rights.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Ramjee was internationally recognised for her work in the field of microbicide research. She received a Lifetime Achievement Award for HIV Prevention and was handed the Outstanding Female Scientist award by the European Development Clinical Trials Partnerships for work in finding new HIV prevention methods.</p>
<p>South Africa has more than seven million people living with HIV/AIDS, one of the largest caseloads in the world.</p>
<p>At least five people have died due to the coronavirus in South Africa and some 1,380 have been infected.

<h3 id="renowned-indian-origin-virologist-gita-ramjee-dies-of-covid-19-in-south-africa">Renowned Indian-Origin Virologist Gita Ramjee Dies Of COVID-19 In South Africa</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e84168c2700006000a67680.jpeg?ops=1200_630" alt="img">
Ramjee, 64, was the Clinical Trials Unit Principal Investigator and Unit Director of the HIV Prevention Research Unit of the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC) offices in Durban.</p>
<p>Ramjee, a stellar vaccine scientist and an HIV prevention research leader, had returned from London a week ago but reportedly showed no symptoms of COVID-19.</p>
<p>So far five people have died in South Africa from COVID-19.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBERG — World-renowned virologist Gita Ramjee became the first Indian-origin South African to die after contracting the novel coronavirus in the country.</p>
<p>For the latest news and more, follow HuffPost India on Twitter, Facebook, and subscribe to our newsletter.</p>
<p>“We are deeply saddened to inform you of the tragic passing of Prof Gita Ramjee in hospital today,” said a statement issued by SAMRC President and CEO Glenda Gray.</p>
<p>“Prof Ramjee died of COVID-19 related complications,” Gray added.</p>
<p>In 2018, Ramjee was presented with the Outstanding Female Scientist Award in Lisbon by the European Development Clinical Trials Partnerships (EDCTP) for her lifetime commitment to finding new HIV prevention methods, which are conducive to the lifestyles, circumstances and perceived risk factors that South African women are faced with.</p>
<p>“This award is an acknowledgement of the unwavering determination by a global community to forever change the trajectory of the HIV/AIDS epidemic,” she had said at the time.</p>
<p>“Professor Gita Ramjee is a towering HIV prevention research leader whose work continues to contribute immensely to the global response to curb the HIV/AIDS epidemic,” Gray had said after the Indian-origin scientist received the award.</p>
<p>Ramjee was married to pharmacist Pravin Ramjee, a South African of Indian descent.</p>
<p>Her funeral arrangements have not been announced. Attendance at funerals in South Africa is highly restricted and requires permits as the country is going through a 21-day nationwide lockdown announced last week by President Cyril Ramaphosa.</p>
<p>Five South Africans have died from COVID-19 since Sunday, the third day of the lockdown. Over 13,50 cases have been reported in the country so far.</p>
<p>The South African government on Tuesday announced that it will double to 10,000 the teams going door-to-door to test people for COVID-19, mainly in the overcrowded Black townships created during the apartheid era.</p>
<p>On Sunday evening, in a national broadcast, Ramaphosa cautioned thousands of South Africans who have not been taking the lockdown seriously.</p>
<p>The death toll from the rapidly-spreading coronavirus pandemic has risen to 41,654 and over 850,580 people have been infected by the deadly virus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
