Ticketmaster has updated the wording of its refund policy for postponed events, and customers are not happy.</p>
<p>With large gatherings across the nation either canceled or postponed due to the spread of coronavirus, many ticket-holders are seeking refunds for concerts, sports and other events.</p>
<p>According to an image captured by the The New York Times, a page on Ticketmaster&rsquo;s website used to say refunds &ldquo;are available if your event is postponed, rescheduled or canceled.&rdquo; Now, the page has been edited to say refunds &ldquo;are available if your event is canceled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ticketmaster&rsquo;s Purchase Policy states that &ldquo;the Event Provider may set refund limitations&rdquo; in the case of rescheduled events, but, without an automatic refund policy for postponements, many customers may be out-of-luck.</p>
<p>In a statement to USA TODAY, the company said its policy on postponed events has been consistent, though its wording online has been edited for clarity.</p>
<p>The statement said that the refund policy for postponed events has always been set by event organizers — not by Ticketmaster. Due to the spread of coronavirus, the company said it is focused on supporting event organizers in determining new dates and refund policies, while rescheduling thousands of events.</p>
<p>CMA Fest, &lsquo;Ghostbusters: Afterlife,&rsquo; Burning Man join coronavirus postponements</p>
<p>As the new wording online became apparent, people took to Twitter to voice their frustrations with the company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comforting to know that even when the world is in the grips of a pandemic, Ticketmaster remains committed to being just a surprisingly large piece of (expletive),&rdquo; wrote user @coopercooperco on Monday.</p>
<p>User @koojms called the policy change &ldquo;one of the most idiotic moves&hellip; especially now that we&rsquo;re in the middle of a pandemic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>everyone suffering during the pandemic</em> ticketmaster: hold on, let me make you suffer even more,&rdquo; wrote @jikooksbloom on Monday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope ticketmaster goes bankrupt,&rdquo; wrote @cranbhobi Monday. &ldquo;Im so sick of those thieves constantly changing policies last minute so that they benefit. its absolutely revolting I think&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="after-doj-approval-ticketmaster-buys-former-ceos-company-rival">After DOJ Approval, Ticketmaster Buys Former CEO&rsquo;s Company Rival</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.billboard.com/files/media/Nathan-Hubbard-press-billboard-1548-1024x677.jpg" alt="img">
The deal includes Rival&rsquo;s lucrative contract for Kroenke Sports and Entertainment.</p>
<p>Nathan Hubbard&rsquo;s ticketing startup Rival has been purchased by Ticketmaster, Billboard has learned.</p>
<p>Launched in 2018 by the former Ticketmaster chief executive, Rival had aims of challenging the Live Nation-owned ticketing company&rsquo;s dominance in North America, but struggled to launch and after months of negotiations, was sold by investors.</p>
<p>In March the Department of Justice approved the purchase of the ticketing startup and its lucrative contract with Kroenke Sports and Entertainment. The purchase also included Rival&rsquo;s technology and staff, minus Hubbard, who will pursue other ventures, sources confirmed.</p>
<p>Hubbard raised more $30 million for Rival as part of its effort to develop a challenger to Ticketmaster, but the company never sold a ticket and ultimately ceded the Kroenke contract to Ticketmaster in August. Billionaire Stan Kroenke&rsquo;s entertainment empire is one of the most coveted in sports and live entertainment, and includes a number of professional sports teams and venues, including the Pepsi Center and Dicks Sporting Goods Park in Denver, as well as the new SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Stan Kroenke&rsquo;s son Josh Kroenke was an investor in Rival along with Andreessen Horowitz and Upfront Ventures. All three sold their stakes in Rival as part of the acquisition.</p>
<p>The ticketing contract for Altitude Tickets &ndash; the regional ticketing brand for Kroenke&rsquo;s Colorado venues, which include 1st Bank Center in Broomfield, Denver&rsquo;s Paramount Theatre and the Colorado State Fair in Pueblo &ndash; had previously been held by AEG&rsquo;s ticketing company AXS.</p>
<p>Instead of switching to Rival in July when AXS&rsquo; contract ended, Kroenke transitioned its events to Ticketmaster and the three companies began negotiating the sale of Rival. The deal then received the blessing of the Department of Justice, which monitors Ticketmaster as part of a consent decree linked to its purchase by Live Nation in 2010. That decree was extended through 2025 earlier this year.</p>
<p>Billboard reached out to Ticketmaster and Rival for this article. Neither opted to provide a comment.

<h3 id="ticketmaster-quietly-changes-its-refund-policy-tldr-youre-screwed">Ticketmaster Quietly Changes Its Refund Policy (TL;DR: You’re Screwed)</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ticketmaster.png" alt="img">
Ticketmaster Quietly Changes Its Refund Policy (TL;DR: You’re Screwed)</p>
<p>Ticketmaster is facing ample fan scrutiny and criticism after quietly changing its refund policy to exclusively cover canceled events, instead of those that have been postponed or rescheduled.</p>
<p>It’s hardly a secret that the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis has brought the live-event industry to a screeching halt. Responding both to government mandates and health concerns, promoters have canceled (or delayed) sporting events, concerts, and essentially all other audience-based entertainment functions.</p>
<p>And predictably, a substantial number of would-be attendees are looking to receive refunds for the tickets they bought prior to the pandemic. In responding to this unprecedented cluster of repayment requests, Ticketmaster has quietly changed its refund policy to cover only canceled events — not the many functions that promoters have indefinitely “postponed” or rescheduled to a date/time that some ticketholders cannot make.</p>
<p>Previously, Ticketmaster’s refund policy stated: “Refunds are available if your event is postponed, rescheduled, or canceled.”</p>
<p>Now, however, the Live Nation company’s refund policy simply says: “Refunds are available if your event is canceled.”</p>
<p>Plus, Ticketmaster’s “Coronavirus Impact” webpage quite carefully describes the difference between cancellations and postponements, in addition to the corresponding policies of each.</p>
<p>On social media, fans’ frustration with the refund reversal appears to be boiling over.</p>
<p>One agitated Twitter user wrote: “@Ticketmaster won’t help me out with my refund…Time to call a lawyer and @bbb_us [the Better Business Bureau].”</p>
<p>Another disgruntled individual asked: “Why is it that when I buy concert tickets you take the money out of my account in a matter of SECONDS, but when shows are being canceled it can take you months to return my money??”</p>
<p>Lastly, a different fan yet tweeted: “All the concerts I bought tickets for have been ‘postponed’…How about you just refund us for our purchase? Nobody knows their future right now.”</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Digital Music News was the first to report that an angry customer had filed a class-action lawsuit against ticket-resale platform StubHub, over the brand’s opting to provide vouchers (instead of cash refunds) for tickets to events canceled because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>
<p>In a statement, StubHub noted, “It is currently impossible for us to offer immediate cash refunds to all buyers.” It’s likely that Ticketmaster is experiencing similar fiscal difficulties, albeit on a much larger scale. (StubHub moves approximately $5 billion in tickets annually, whereas Ticketmaster’s yearly sales volume has exceeded $30 billion in the past.)</p>
<p>Stay tuned for additional updates on Ticketmaster’s refund policy.
