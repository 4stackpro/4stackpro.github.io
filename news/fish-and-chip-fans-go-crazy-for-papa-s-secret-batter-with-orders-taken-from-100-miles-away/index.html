<p>It’s Good Friday which means a traditional fish and chips is a must.</p>
<p>However, with the coronavirus lockdown still in force the public are deprived of a trip to their local chippy to take up the Easter weekend tradition.</p>
<p>Papa’s Fish and Chips, one of Hull’s favourite places to eat, will remain closed on Good Friday for the first time in over 50 years.</p>
<p>But it hasn&rsquo;t stopped the owners coming up with a unique way customers can still enjoy their delicious fish supper - by sharing their secret family recipe.</p>
<p>Customers were able to purchase the secret recipe batter mix through their website from Friday and have it delivered straight to their door.</p>
<p>In an incredible gesture, owners say that every penny raised through the sales of their secret recipe batter mix, will be donated directly to local NHS hospitals to help purchase PPE.</p>
<p>Within hours of posting the recipe, and accompanying &lsquo;how to&rsquo; video online, owners say they received over 50 orders. You can find the recipe on their website here.</p>
<p>Dino Papas said: “All of the deliveries have been sent out and everyone who ordered yesterday should receive it today.</p>
<p>“If other people want to order the recipe we will try our best to get it sent out today but otherwise it will sent to them throughout the week.</p>
<p>“We only went live for a couple of hours and we got 55 orders in. By the time it is all done we are hoping to do hundreds of them.</p>
<p>“We got orders from Sheffield and Peterborough. We had to call them up to say we won’t be able to get it to them for Good Friday, but they were happy to receive it whenever we can get it to them.</p>
<p>“People are just missing fish and chips.”</p>
<p>In light of the coronavirus crisis Papa’s owners decided to close all of its restaurants and takeaways on March 23 to protect their staff, customers and the wider community.</p>
<p>In sharing their secret recipe, customers will receive the batter mix, a ‘recipe card’ and ‘key item card’ and can also download a ‘how to video’.</p>
<p>Although Good Friday will soon be over, Dino says customers will still be able to purchase the recipe.</p>

<p>“We will continue to do it,” he said. “We don’t have an exact plan to when we are going to stop it but we are still doing it for the rest of the week.”

<p>Eating fish on Good Friday has become something of a tradition over the years, but where does it come from?</p>
<p>With the UK still under lockdown and many fish and chip shops shut, you may need to try making your own this year.</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to know about the traditions of eating fish on Good Friday - and an easy recipe for making fish and chips at home.</p>

<p>Christians believe that Jesus was executed on Good Friday, sacrificing his flesh for our sins.</p>
<p>For centuries, Christians have abstained from eating meat on Good Friday, and this was a rule laid out by the Vatican.</p>
<p>Today, many people, whether they’re religious or not, choose to eat fish instead of meat. Since fish are cold-blooded, their meat is thought to be different to the meat of warm-blooded animals.</p>
<p>Fish also have Christian connotations having been used as a secret symbol by Christians to identify each other when their religion was banned.</p>
<p>Many of Jesus Christ’s followers were also fishermen.</p>
<p>Some devout followers of the religion take the Good Friday tradition further and eat fish rather than meat every Friday.</p>
<p>There were also plenty of meat-free days in the medieval Christian calendar alongside Good Friday, including Fridays, Wednesdays, Saturdays, Advent and Lent.</p>
<p>For those looking to partake in a fishy Good Friday, here’s a recipe you can try at home for fish and chips.</p>
<p>Fish and chip recipes</p>
<p>Oven-baked fish &amp; chips - BBC Good Food</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<p>For the chips:800g/ 1lb 12 oz floury potatoes, scrubbed and cut into chips2 tbsp olive oil</p>
<p>For the fish:50g fresh breadcrumbzest 1 lemon2 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsley4 x 140g/5oz thick sustainable white fish fillets200g/ 7oz cherry tomato</p>
<p>Method</p>
<p>Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7.</p>
<p>Pat chips dry on kitchen paper, then lay in a single layer on a large baking tray. Drizzle with half the olive oil and season with salt.</p>
<p>Cook for 40 mins, turning after 20 mins, so they cook evenly.</p>
<p>Mix the breadcrumbs with the lemon zest and parsley, then season well.</p>
<p>Top the cod evenly with the breadcrumb mixture, then drizzle with the remaining oil.</p>
<p>Put in a roasting tin with the cherry tomatoes, then bake in the oven for the final 10 mins of the chips’ cooking time.</p>
<p>Golden beer-battered fish with chips - BBC Good Food</p>
<p>For the fish50g plain flour50g cornflour1 tsp baking powderturmeric75ml lager beer75ml sparkling waterabout 1 litre sunflower oil, for frying400g fillet sustainable cod, hake or haddock, halved</p>
<p>For the chips750g potatoes, Maris Piper or Desiree, peeled and sliced into thick chips2 tbsp plain flour2 tbsp sunflower oil</p>
<p>Method</p>
<p>Combine the flour, cornflour, baking powder and turmeric in a large bowl, season, then spoon 1 tbsp onto a plate and set aside.Gradually pour the beer and water into the bowl, stirring with a wooden spoon until you have a smooth, lump-free batter. Leave to rest for 30 mins while you prepare the chips.</p>
<p>Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Boil a large pan of water, then add the chipped potatoes and boil for 2-3 mins until the outsides are just tender but not soft. Drain well, then tip onto a large baking tray with the flour, oil and some salt.</p>
<p>Gently toss together until all the potatoes are evenly coated and the flour is no longer dusty. Roast for 30 mins, turning occasionally, until the chips are golden and crisp.</p>
<p>To cook the fish, heat the 1 litre oil in a deep saucepan until a drop of batter sizzles and crisps up straight away.</p>
<p>Pat the fish dry with kitchen paper, then toss it in the reserved turmeric flour mix. Shake off any excess, then dip into the batter.</p>
<p>Carefully lower each fillet into the hot oil and fry for 6-8 mins – depending on the thickness of the fish – until golden and crisp. Using a large slotted spoon, lift out the fish, drain on kitchen paper, then sprinkle with salt.

Residents in Sunderland stuck to the social-distancing guidelines while queuing for their traditional fish and chips.</p>
<p>Businesses worked round the restrictions to keep food-lovers and staff safe during the coronavirus lockdown measures.</p>
<p>People were pictured queuing up outside popular fish and chip restaurants, such as The Bay in Seaburn and Downey’s on the seafront at Roker on Friday, April 10.</p>

<p>But systems kept them at least two metres apart – in line with the government guidelines, put in place to protect people from the spread of Covid-19.</p>
<p>In previous years residents have been known to queue for over an hour for their fish and chips, on what is one of the busiest days of the year for many in the business.</p>
