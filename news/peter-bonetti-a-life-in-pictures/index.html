<h3 id="peter-bonetti-goalkeeper-for-chelsea-and-england-beloved-for-his-spectacular-saves--obituary">Peter Bonetti, goalkeeper for Chelsea and England beloved for his spectacular saves – obituary</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/obituaries/2020/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000229484539-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqeK8ehqBZJSTiVTgumtathRyT9BmsXxLzAJRaHIt-hvM.jpeg?imwidth=1200" alt="img">
Peter Bonetti, who has died aged 78, was the long serving Chelsea goalkeeper whose spectacular displays earned him the nickname “The Cat”, but who was unlucky to be remembered as the man who cost England the World Cup in Mexico in 1970. Alongside players such as Peter Osgood, Alan Hudson and Ron “Chopper” Harris, he was a fixture in the mercurial Chelsea team that epitomised “Swinging London” in the 1960s and early 1970s. But where many of his colleagues were wayward talents, equally at ease in the nightspots of the King’s Road as on the training ground, Bonetti’s flamboyance was reserved for the pitch, where his gracefulness, agility and lightning reflexes attracted widespread acclaim. In 729 appearances between 1961 and 1979 Bonetti kept more than 200 “clean sheets” and offered Chelsea a defensive security they had previously lacked. The result was the brightest period in the club’s history as the team won the League Cup, the FA Cup and the European Cup-Winners’ Cup. But Bonetti’s reputation was shattered in Mexico when he was selected after Gordon Banks suffered food poisoning immediately before the quarter-final. Under-prepared mentally and physically – and, such was Banks’ impregnability, the holder of only six England caps – Bonetti was savaged after West Germany reversed a two-goal deficit in the midday heat to beat England 3-2 in extra time, avenging their famous defeat at Wembley four years earlier.</p>

<p>The fact that Sir Alf Ramsey had taken off Bobby Charlton, to save him for the semi-final, as well as Martin Peters, is often forgotten by those keen to heap all the blame on Bonetti. Although he admitted he would have saved Franz Beckenbauer’s opening goal “nine times out of 10”, Uwe Seeler’s bizarre back-header was, he said, “a freak”, and “by the time of the third we were all shattered”. However, England’s striker Geoff Hurst observed: “I feel sorry for Peter, but his role in our downfall was beyond argument.” Bonetti never played for England again. Soon afterwards the great Chelsea side began to splinter, and in the mid-1970s the club suffered the indignity of relegation. Bonetti’s career was played out against a backdrop of half-full stadiums, financial difficulties and terrace violence. It was an unworthy end for a goalkeeper about whom the great Brazilian Pele once observed: “The three greatest goalkeepers I have ever seen are Gordon Banks, Lev Yashin and Peter Bonetti.” Peter Phillip Bonetti was born on September 27 1941 in Putney, west London, where his Swiss parents had settled after emigrating from the Alps. He was appearing for the Reading youth team when his mother wrote to Chelsea suggesting her son might make a respectable goalkeeper “one day”. Having been part of the side that won the FA Youth Cup in 1960, Bonetti made his debut the following year in a 3-0 win against Manchester City, and his assurance rapidly made the No 1 position his own. But the team was ageing, and the following year they were relegated and humiliatingly beaten 2-1 in the FA Cup by Crewe Alexandra of the Fourth Division.</p>

<p>But Tommy Docherty, the new player-coach, transferred ageing players and created a new, young, hard-running, quick-passing side. Bonetti, Harris, John Hollins, Terry Venables and the prolific goalscorer Bobby Tambling were the spine he augmented with shrewd signings. The result was an immediate return to the First Division, as champions, having beaten arch-rivals Sunderland 1-0 in the penultimate game, aided by a spine-tingling last-minute save from Bonetti. They finished fifth in their first season in the top flight and in 1965 were on course for “the treble”. But after they won the League Cup – beating Leicester City 3-2 after an inspired display by “the Cat” – their season fell apart. Having lost 2-0 to Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final, Docherty sent home eight players – although not Bonetti – before the game against Burnley for breaking his pre-match curfew. Their second-stringers lost 6-2 and the title slipped from their grasp amid animosity and recrimination. Bonetti was selected for the World Cup-winning squad in 1966 but did not play a game. It was his misfortune that his career coincided with that of Banks, for in a different era his fearless, acrobatic and occasionally miraculous performances for Chelsea would have won far greater international recognition. Despite Bonetti’s impressive performances in the Fairs Cup in 1967, in which Chelsea lost to Barcelona in the semi-finals, Docherty capriciously signed Alex Stepney from Millwall. Stepney was apparently destined to take “the Cat’s” place, but Bonetti responded with a series of majestic performances and Stepney was transferred to Manchester United after a solitary appearance in blue. But Docherty’s relationship with his players had deteriorated. In 1967 he elected to break up a team with an average age of 21 and create a new side organised around the powerful Peter Osgood and the tricky Scottish winger, Charlie Cooke. Initially the move invigorated Chelsea, with Osgood leading a charge to the top of the First Division. But after he broke a leg they sank into mid-table anonymity and, although they reached the FA Cup final, they lost 2-1 to Spurs in a lacklustre game. The following season Docherty was sacked and replaced by Dave Sexton, who introduced the sparkling Alan Hudson and added steel to his defence with David Webb and John Dempsey.</p>

<p>This contributed to third position in the league and a famous FA Cup win in 1970, when Don Revie’s feared and reviled Leeds United side were overcome 2-1 in a titanic replay at Old Trafford. The first match at Wembley had been drawn 2-2; Chelsea, who had trailed twice in that game, would have lost but for the magic of Bonetti. He reprised his performance in the replay when, despite being injured after a clash with Mick Jones, his bravery and agility were remarkable, and he made several match-winning saves. He travelled to the 1970 World Cup as understudy, watching from the bench as Banks made his gravity-defying save against Pele’s header and England, under Bobby Moore, established themselves as potential champions. But only hours before the quarter-final in Leon, Banks was stricken, and Bonetti replaced him. Initially England dominated the game and led 2-0. But Beckenbauer’s shot squirmed under Bonetti’s body, Charlton was substituted, and England wilted in the heat. Seeler’s back-header levelled the tie and long before Gerd Müller struck the winner in extra time England were physically and mentally depleted. A Herculean performance in the Cup-Winners’ Cup final, in which Chelsea beat Real Madrid 2-1 after a replay, restored Bonetti’s standing among the Stamford Bridge faithful. But the great Chelsea side was fragmenting, morale and results were declining in tandem and key performers – though never Bonetti – found themselves increasingly at odds with Sexton. The goalkeeper recalled: “We did lack that absolutely ruthless killer instinct that the great teams have.” Soon after Chelsea lost 2-1 to Stoke City in the 1972 League Cup final, and to Second Division Leyton Orient in the FA Cup, Osgood and Hudson were transferred. If Bonetti was tempted by money he never wavered: “I would rather be happy in myself and my job than picking up a lot of money for swopping loyalties and clubs,” he observed. At the beginning of the 1974-75 season Sexton was sacked and the club was again relegated. Bonetti was given a free transfer, and enjoyed a successful season with the St Louis Stars in the North American Soccer League before returning to Stamford Bridge for three years, helping the new manager, his former team-mate Eddie McCreadie, win promotion.</p>

<p>Two years later, after a 1-1 draw with Arsenal and 729 Chelsea games – second only to “Chopper” Harris – the ever-modest Bonetti sold his sports shop in Clapham and retired to the Isle of Mull to be a postman and run a bed and breakfast. Having appeared sporadically for Dundee United while living in Scotland, he returned to England to become a goalkeeping coach. Despite being told by his Arsenal counterpart Bob Wilson that he would never make a living as a specialist coach in an age before sports nutritionists and psychologists were the norm, he carved out a successful career with Manchester City, the England senior side and the Under-21s and, inevitably, Chelsea.</p>
