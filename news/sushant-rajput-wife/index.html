<p>Updated: Jun 15, 2020 11:50 IST</p>
<p>Actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death should be investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Jan Adhikar Party chief Pappu Yadav demanded on Monday.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput, who dropped out of an engineering college to pursue a career in Bollywood and delivered several hit films over the past decade, was found dead in his apartment in Mumbai on Sunday. He was 34.</p>
<p>Dattatreya Bargude, an assistant commissioner of Mumbai Police, confirmed the actor’s death and said that no “note” was found at his residence.</p>
<p>“I cannot imagine how this happened. I request the government to launch a CBI inquiry. I think there is a deep conspiracy behind his death. Sushant cannot commit suicide,” Pappu Yadav told reporters.</p>
<p>“I want a CBI inquiry in the matter. Sushant was a workaholic and good man, not the kind of person that would commit suicide. He rose from the bottom. Made Bihar proud. Now the state of Bihar is in mourning,” he added.</p>
<p>Yadav also claimed that it could be a case of homicide.</p>
<p>Rajput was born in Bihar’s capital of Patna and was the youngest of five children of a government employee. He completed his schooling in Delhi before securing a seat in an engineering college in the Capital in 2003.</p>
<p>He dropped out of the course to pursue acting professionally three years later and joined the Barry John Acting School.</p>
<p>The actor landed his first role in the Hindi serial, Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil, in 2008 but gained popularity the next year with his character in the popular soap, Pavitra Rishta.</p>
<p>He debuted in Bollywood in 2013 with the movie Kai Po Che!, adapted from a novel by Chetan Bhagat but became a household name with the success of MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, a biopic on the World Cup-winning Indian cricket captain, in 2016.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput was last seen in Nitesh Tiwari’s Chhichhore in 2019 and also acted in the thriller Drive that was released on Netflix the same year.</p>

<h3 id="from-shoba-to-sushant-singh-rajput-a-look-at-suicides-in-indian-cinema">&ldquo;From Shoba to Sushant Singh Rajput: A look at suicides in Indian cinema&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.manoramaonline.com/content/dam/mm/en/entertainment/entertainment-news/images/2020/6/15/sushant-soba-silk-smitha-suicide.jpg" alt="img">
The curse of suicide has haunted the showbiz since time immemorial with the likes of iconic actor-director Guru Dutt, South star Shoba, Silk Smitha, actor Jiah Khan and now Bollywood star Sushant Singh Rajput giving up on life in the Indian film industry known for being harsh and demanding of its stars.</p>
<p>Known for films like &ldquo;Kai Po Che!&quot;, &ldquo;MS Dhoni: The Untold Story&rdquo;, &ldquo;Chhichhore&rdquo;, Rajput was found hanging at his Bandra home, the police said on Sunday. He was 34.</p>
<p>ALSO READ: Shocking suicides: Actors who stunned us with their sudden exits</p>
<p>Rajput&rsquo;s last screen appearance was Nitesh Tiwari&rsquo;s 2019 film Chhichhore. And his last social media post, dedicated to his late mother who died in 2002 when he was a young teen, was on June 3, a foretelling perhaps on what to come.</p>
<p>Rajput&rsquo;s sudden death comes days after his former manager, 28-year-old Disha Salian, ended her life by jumping from a high rise building on June 9.</p>
<p>Guru Dutt, known for black-and-white classics like &ldquo;Kaagaz Ke Phool&rdquo;, &ldquo;Baazi&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Pyaasa&rdquo;, was found dead on October 10, 1964 in his bed in his rented apartment at Pedder Road in erstwhile Bombay. He was 39. The filmmaker, whose real name was Vasanth Kumar Shivashankar Padukone, was said to have been mixing alcohol and sleeping pills.</p>
<p>Dutt&rsquo;s death may have been suicide or just an accidental overdose. His son, Arun Dutt, considered the death to be an accident.</p>
<p>Guru Dutt</p>
<p>South star Mahalakshmi Menon, best known by her stagename Shoba committed suicide at the age of 17. She got herself a National Award for Best Actress for the film Pasi and on May 1, 1980, she was found to have killed herself in her house in Chennai, then Madras. The manner of Shoba’s death, however, still remains cloaked in mystery.</p>
<p>Four years after Shoba died, her mother Prema who was also an actress too killed herself. KG George&rsquo;s 1983 film Lekhayude Maranam – Oru Flashback is said to be loosely based on her life.</p>
<p>Actor Vijaylakshmi, who reached the iconic status of a sex symbol in Tamil cinema during her time, as Silk Smitha died at the age of 33 as the result of a suspected suicide in 1996. She appeared in over 200 films, including &ldquo;Vandichakkaram&rdquo;, &ldquo;Moondru Mugam&rdquo;, a most sought after actor at a time was said to be neck deep in controversies.</p>
<p>Silk Smitha</p>
<p>She was immortalised on screen in the 2011 film &ldquo;The Dirty Picture&rdquo;, starring Vidya Balan as Silk. The Milan Luthria-directed film, which showed the highs and lows of the dancing star, was inspired by the actor&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Former Miss India and video jockey Nafisa Joseph was found hanging at her residence in Versova in 2004 at the age of 25.</p>
<p>Joseph, who won the Miss India title in 1997, had worked as a model and had been involved in activities related to animal rights.</p>
<p>In 2006, model-turned television actor Kuljeet Randhawa, known for starring in high-school drama &ldquo;Hip Hip Hurray!&quot;, suspense serial &ldquo;Kohinoor&rdquo; and crime thriller drama &ldquo;Special Squad&rdquo;, allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself in her single room apartment in suburban Juhu. She was 25.</p>
<p>Kunal Singh, best known for starring opposite actor Sonali Bendre in the 1999 Tamil romance film &ldquo;Kadhalar Dhinam&rdquo;, was found hanging from the ceiling fan in his Mumbai apartment in 2008. He was 30.</p>
<p>Jiah Khan</p>
<p>British-American actor Jiah Khan, best known for films like &ldquo;Nishabd&rdquo; with megastar Amitabh Bachchan and &ldquo;Ghajini&rdquo; with Aamir Khan, was found hanging at her Mumbai residence on June 3, 2013 by her mother Rabiya Khan. Khan was 25.</p>
<p>It was deemed a suicide and reconfirmed as a suicide in 2016 following an extensive investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and a hearing at the Bombay High Court.</p>
<p>Khan&rsquo;s mother blamed her boyfriend, actor Sooraj Pancholi, for her death. He was charged with abetting Khan&rsquo;s suicide. The case has not yet been settled.</p>
<p>Last year, actor Kushal Punjabi, who appeared in films such as &ldquo;Kaal&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lakshya&rdquo; as well as the reality show &ldquo;Fear Factor&rdquo;, was found hanging in his Bandra apartment. He was 42.</p>
<p>Punjabi, whose body was found by his parents in the wee hours of December 27, left behind a suicide note in which he said nobody should be held responsible for his death.

New Delhi | Jagran Lifestyle Desk: Actor Sushant Singh Rajput&rsquo;s committal of suicide on Sunday shook the conscience of the nation which has pushed the conversations on Internet and beyond towards the most sidelined aspect of mental health, and the stereotypical assertions which get associated with the steps taken to deal with its deterioration.</p>
<p>Sushant &ndash; a brilliant, well-read engineer-turned actor who was deeply interested in astronomy and Physics, and had his home and heart filled with philosophical memorabilia &ndash; was reportedly in depression for past six months and took the extreme call on Sunday as his body was found hanging on to a fan in his house in Mumbai&rsquo;s Bandra later in the day.</p>
<p>The shockwaves driven by the unfortunate loss of Bollywood&rsquo;s on-screen Dhoni, have modulated the conversations towards mental well-being of individuals, with people sharing anecdotes and the approaches necessary to deal with such dystopic situations.</p>
<p>Former South Mumbai MP Milind Deora took to Twitter and detailed upon his experience with suicidal thoughts, ‘first as a teen and then as an MP’. ”Life is beautiful. Don&rsquo;t get caught up in the rat race. Choose music, food, travel, reading, your work and loved ones. Do what makes you happy. Choose life,&rdquo; wrote Deora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;MOST people you know have suffered from depression at one point or another, even if they don&rsquo;t know it. How you treat people matters,&rdquo; wrote Comedian Vir Das.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s convenient to pass off the death of a young person as &ldquo;oh&hellip;depression&rdquo;. That means you no longer have to own your systemic part in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one here actually cares about anyone’s mental health so cut the crap. Here’s hoping people have friends and family who love them outside Twitter because this isn’t the real world anyway,&rdquo; wrote a user.</p>

<p>With suicide of #SushantSinghRajput, Twitter is filled with posts like &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand why he would do this!&rdquo; and &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re feeling sad, please just call a friend!!&rdquo; Shows the absolute lack of understanding around mental health and suicide. We need better conversations. RIP. — Radhika Radhakrishnan 🏳️‍🌈✊🏾 (@so_radhikal) June 14, 2020</p>
<p>&ldquo;NO #SushantSinghRajput !</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depression is a dangerous medical illness, and it is important for India to accept it, not stigmatize it,&rdquo; wrote another user.</p>

<p>Mental health issues are equally important as physical health issues.. We Indians as a society or as a individual don&rsquo;t take it seriously.. RIP #SushantSinghRajput — राहुल पवार 🇮🇳 (@rrptweets) June 14, 2020</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk to your friends, reach out to psychologists, counsellors etc. Ask your friends and family “How they doing?” like you mean it,&rdquo; wrote another user.</p>
<p>No motivational words, videos helps you. You just feel alone even if you’re surrounded by the people you love. Even after his death people are talking about his role in Chhichore. That’s just a role he played. Stop comparing movies with real life. — the_millennial (@kunal_kaklij) June 14, 2020</p>
<p>The stigma attached with the mental illnesses costs personal sanity of the affected individuals and ends up being fatal before the acquaintances realise. Despite the fact Sushant was being treated for depression, he couldn&rsquo;t survive the storm of uncertainties in his head and heart.</p>
<p>From Parveen Babi to Pratyusha Banerjee, and from Jiah Khan to Sushant Singh Rajput today, the bongs have been banged upon our societies, but ignorance had had its way. India recorded 1,33,623 suicides in 2015, and that must sound alarming for our overall sense of attribution towards our near ones and their mental sanity.</p>
