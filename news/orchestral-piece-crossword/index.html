<p>This post contains signposts for those who prefer their crosswords to relieve rather than relive the recent events of the pandemic</p>
<p>In the sample clues below, the links take you to little explainers from our For Beginners series.</p>
<p>The news in clues</p>
<p>Let’s call it: the crossword is no longer a guaranteed sanctuary from the rest of the paper. Some solvers will regret this; readers Shenguin and Dimsworthy forcefully put the case for crossword-as-haven in the conversation at a previous post. If you prefer puzzles to avoid mentioning what’s happening – and you’ve plenty of justification – please skip to the next subhead.</p>
<p>The reason is that the words some setters avoided at the start of what we’re calling “This” …</p>
<p>20ac Mother’s in meeting ad infinitum, feeling fine (12)</p>
<p>[ wordplay: synonym for ‘mother’ contained by (‘in’), and there’s no way to say this, mathematical term used when approaching infinity ]</p>
<p>[ MA in ASYMPTOTIC ]</p>
<p>[ definition: feeling fine ]</p>
<p>… such as ASYMPTOMATIC, are back. The setter here, Philistine, is a surgeon, who kicks off the same puzzle with a curt direction …</p>
<p>1ac Please spread out (6)</p>
<p>[ wordplay: anagram (‘spread’) of PLEASE ]</p>
<p>[ definition: out ]</p>
<p>… as a clue for ASLEEP. And in the Independent on Sunday, Hoskins could not be more timely …</p>
<p>20d Depressing high toll overwhelms hospital department (7)</p>
<p>[ wordplay: synonym for a high-pitched bell sound (‘high toll’) surrounding abbrev. for Ear, Nose &amp; Throat (‘hospital department’) ]</p>
<p>[ DING surrounding ENT ]</p>
<p>[ definition: depressing ]</p>
<p>… in the surface reading of a horrendously This clue for DENTING.</p>
<p>Latter patter</p>
<p>Here’s a clue by Pan from the quiptic, the Guardian’s stepping-stone puzzle “for beginners and those in a hurry”.</p>
<p>27ac Managed to get gold box valued (12)</p>
<p>[ wordplay: heraldic term for ‘gold’ + synonyms for ‘box’ &amp; ‘valued’ ]</p>
<p>[ OR + CHEST + RATED ]</p>
<p>[ definition: managed ]</p>
<p>And so it’s ORCHESTRATED, a word that owes its origin, via the spot where the chorus used to dance, to the Greek ὀρχεῖσθαι. To dance. My feelings about Ezra Pound are almost entirely to do with his choice of sides in the early 1940s, but I think often of his thought that goes like this:</p>
<p>Music begins to atrophy when it departs too far from the dance; that poetry begins to atrophy when it gets too far from music</p>
<p>Pound aside, I’m thrilled to think of dancing as etymologically baked into the orchestra, whatever it might play. I imagine dancing’s being there too in a term that is doubtless evolving as we speak. I’m prepared to accept that perhaps no one was maintaining logs of its earlier use as hips swayed in Harlem nightspots, but reader: how would you clue HIPSTER?</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you can put aside the poignancy of his having to pluck alone in the Wigmore Hall, last week’s recital by Scottish guitarist Sean Shibe (reviewed here by the Guardian) is wonderful while solving and better still while only listening.</p>
<p>Facebook Twitter Pinterest Sean Shibe</p>
<p>Cluing competition</p>
<p>Thanks for your clues for IMPACT. A bumper harvest once again and Dimsworthy thoughtfully remarks: “I genuinely wonder how Alan deals with them all.” Equally genuinely, the only annoyance is choosing what to exclude to get a readable digest. (And regarding jargon – as the word “impact” has become in part – this recommendation of Jonathan Meades is seconded.)</p>
<p>Etymon gets the audacity award for “What paintballs explode on”, though that wouldn’t be so audacious in an American puzzle, where every square is part of an across and a down answer.</p>
<p>Now is the moment where we reiterate the advice at the top; this time, if you want some respite from This, skip to the penultimate paragraph of this section. This is because many of the clues were, in the words of Harlobarlo, “not about This, but about That”. In fact, we’ve never once had so many clues evoke the same incident in their surface.</p>
<p>So, recounting what will surely never be forgiven, we have among plenty of others: Lizard’s “Dom C. is apt to be portrayed as devious sod with such influence”, PeterMooreFuller’s “Starts to investigate Machiavellian political advisor caught travelling? There will be consequences!”, Harlobarlo’s “Consequence of emphatic spinning? Sadly, he’s rejected”, Mojoseeker’s “On the road back from Durham, bargain for influence”, Faiton77’s “Press together? One understanding this holds the end of Dom” and Porcia’s “Current prime minister lying about episode’s significance”. Thanks to all and to others – and so much for populism.</p>
<p>The runners-up are Catarella’s plausible “Effect of tight cap – migraine returning” and Dunnart’s semi-cheering “POW camp liberated in Italy”; the winner is Porcia’s deft “‘The name’s Bond &hellip;’ makes an impression”.</p>
<p>Kludos to Porcia. Please leave entries for this fortnight’s competition – and your picks from the broadsheet cryptics – below.</p>
<p>Clue of the fortnight</p>
<p>Your suggestions are welcome on how to parse this, from Dean Mayer in the Sunday Times …</p>
<p>17d How to pronounce the ‘h’ of ‘aaargh’? (8)</p>
<p>… but as a clue for ASPIRATE, it shivers my timbers.

<h3 id="crossword-roundup-topical-allusions-sneaking-back-in">&ldquo;Crossword roundup: topical allusions sneaking back in&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/557c811d51f97e3b01448b0523395e7321dc676b/120_275_1040_624/master/1040.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=fd127a214257323d12e7acef5c36d89f" alt="img">
In the sample clues below, the links take you to little explainers from our For Beginners series.</p>
<p>The news in clues</p>
<p>The crossword is a happy place. Late in March, the general tenor of the daily puzzles largely and understandably became a lot less topical. What comfort is a crossword if it reminds you of the thing you’re seeking an hour’s respite from (henceforth referred to as “This”)?</p>
<p>And so it went for a while. More recently, the odd acknowledgment of This has been appearing, and not in an unpleasant way. Well, I say that. In the Independent, Skinny’s vision of the world to come is … ominous.</p>
<p>14ac Flesh-eating virus racoon develops (11)</p>
<p>[ wordplay: anagram (‘develops’) of VIRUSRACOON ]</p>
<p>[ definition: flesh-eating ]</p>
<p>Given that the answer, CARNIVOROUS, lends itself to another anagram, perhaps we should regard Skinny’s fatal procyonids as a whimsical fantasy? A more world-weary hat-tip to life in 2020 can be seen in Paul’s clue …</p>
<p>27ac Stupefied, practising social distancing? (6,3)</p>
<p>[ double definition ]</p>
<p>… for SPACED OUT. If you see more allusions to This in puzzles – or if you’d rather see none – let me know below.</p>
<p>Latter patter</p>
<p>The above, by the way, is no criticism of Skinny. Not only does the flesh-eating clue remind us that the answer to the careful writer’s question “Now, how many ‘c’s are there in ‘rac(c)oon’?” is “It depends how you’re transliterating the Algonquian ‘aroughcun’” (the Guardian implicitly defers to Collins’ double-C); elsewhere, Skinny also clues one of those words that’s worth having a think about.</p>
<p>Here’s the clue:</p>
<p>11ac Celebrated ensemble enveloped in smoke that’s excessive (7)</p>
<p>[ wordplay: abbrev. for London Symphony Orchestra (‘celebrated ensemble’) inside (‘enveloped in’) synonym for ‘smoke’ (often as a verb) ]</p>
<p>[ LSO inside FUME ]</p>
<p>[ definition: excessive ]</p>
<p>So it’s FULSOME. Almost the last thing I remember before This was reading, in a botanical garden the day before it was closed, an essay offering pithy advice on how to deal with the fact that some people use “fulsome” to mean “pleasingly plentiful” and others use it to mean “unpleasingly plentiful”.</p>
<p>The phone I used to read it can’t tell me where that essay is; if any of the various corporations which have logged my enjoyment of the piece would care to share its location, I’ll pass it on. My two penn’orth is that the word, having become ambiguous, is one I’ll try to remember to forget. I’m happy with using words such as “profuse” for one sense and “effusive” for another, so this is not a case of losing a unique and useful piece of language – it’s not like “curate’s egg”.</p>
<p>Which brings us to a question. Is there anyone here who (a) doesn’t tend to leap up and down insisting that language mustn’t change but also (b) has some word or phrase they really wish would not change form or meaning? I’ll start with the subject of our next challenge. It’s not that I think it shouldn’t be a verb; it’s more that I tend to stop listening when I hear it used as one. Reader, how would you clue IMPACT?</p>
<p>Cluing competition</p>
<p>Thanks for your clues for QUIDDITY. And thank you for persevering with a word which combines wretched letters and an irritating pair of meanings. It took us to some unexpected places, as in GeoScanner’s “An old Bill Tidy comic character” and PeterMooreFuller’s “Sum of £1.01 - over 50% of equity”.</p>
<p>Dunnart gets the audacity award, not for the smut in his excellent “Heart pounds, having sex in empty doorway” but for his use of “®” in “Trademark tobacco – ‘Coarse Cut®’”. And one of our occasional inside-baseball moments happened delightfully with Porcia’s “Nit-picking the nitty-gritty”.</p>
<p>The runners-up, perhaps coincidentally, can both be read as references to This: Dimsworthy’s “Did wrongly go outside this month when missing Mother Nature” and Harlobarlo’s “Oddly, today I nearly quit drinking, initially out of curiosity”; the same could be said of the winner, Faiton77’s charming “Something to chew on. Time in home repairs the spirit”.</p>
<p>Kludos to Faiton. Please leave entries for this fortnight’s competition, and your picks from the broadsheet cryptics, below.</p>
<p>Clue of the Fortnight</p>
<p>Here’s a Telegraph Toughie clue from proXimal; it’s one of those ones where you need to stare at almost every word trying to work out what job it’s really doing.</p>
<p>21ac Rough stray caught scratching around (4)</p>
<p>[ wordplay: anagram of (‘stray’) CAUGHT without (‘scratching’) abbrev. for ‘circa’ (‘around’) ]</p>
<p>[ anagram of CAUGHT – CA ]</p>
<p>[ definition: rough (as a noun) ]</p>
<p>And when you see that the answer is THUG, you look back and see that every stage was fair. It’s important to be fair, during This, isn’t it?

<h3 id="review-andrew-normans-astonishingly-sustainable-sustain">&ldquo;Review: Andrew Norman’s astonishingly sustainable ‘Sustain’&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d4c5284/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+85/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa7%2F5f%2F7be3561e493084956a42e8897540%2Fla-photos-1staff-471213-la-et-cm-la-phil-dudamel-review-7-brv.jpg" alt="img">
The full sustaining power of composer Andrew Norman’s mind-bending, enchanting orchestral piece “Sustain” first became evident about 9:30 p.m. Oct. 4, 2018. That would be about 20 minutes, just over halfway, into its Los Angeles Philharmonic world premiere at Walt Disney Concert Hall.</p>
<p>At that point, a hooked listener had no choice but to go along for the marvelous ride as the score chaotically burst its seams, releasing sonic shards into the environment that would fall back to Earth as audible cosmic dust.</p>
<p>This was one of the first of dozens of commissions for the L.A. Phil centennial season, and it instantly became the talk of the new music community and beyond. Lo-fi recordings of Gustavo Dudamel’s spectacular performance, taken from a KUSC-FM (91.5) broadcast, were circulating. Not all of us came to the concert hall intending to have our hair stand on end, so there were walkouts, and I got an angry letter or two about the piece. But by and large, the sense was that the popular L.A. composer, still in his 30s, had come up with a masterpiece.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon, Dudamel repeated “Sustain” at Disney, this time as a prelude to Bruckner’s mighty Fourth Symphony, a program he will take on an L.A. Phil tour to Mexico City and London later this month (but not inexplicably to New York, where the orchestra will play only the Bruckner). In the meantime, Deutsche Grammophon has released an L.A. Phil recording in superb sound. Still, “Sustain” had not been played since the first performances, and its sustainability as a masterpiece needed confirmation.</p>
<p>When it comes to our very humanity, sustainability itself should to be the biggest concern of our time. We no longer have trust in what, if anything, can or will last. In an interview about music years ago, the Dalai Lama foretold our way of dealing with the future as needing to get over attachment, music in particular, since it is so addictive. Attachment to anything, he insisted, even his to Buddhism, holds us back.</p>
<p>The best thing about “Sustain,” other than its sheer beauty, is that it is by its very nature unattachable. The piece has a very specific structure, although you are not likely to follow it unless you know exactly what to listen for, which then defeats the point. The score operates in cycles that are signaled by an angelic run up the scale on two pianos tuned a quarter-tone apart.</p>
<p>Waves of string constellations rise and fall, interrupted by suppurating winds and consoled by brass chords. Everything is staggered. On paper, this is a riot of intersecting patterns that look like ant colonies on the move or seeds scattering in the wind. There is a motoric section in which the orchestra blows a ferocious wind before returning to mellower otherworldliness. The cycle lasts some 17 minutes before being repeated in a much abbreviated form and sped up several times. By then, you realize you have no way of knowing where you are going or why.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Progress proves unsustainable. Players are eventually left on their own in semi-improvisation, with a rudimentary percussion section attempting to maintain a beat. Two large pieces of suspended plywood are scraped. The pianos ring out irregular, exquisitely broken, off-tuned chords. We’re lost in a new world.</p>
<p>“You will have no idea where the pianists are by this point,” the composer writes in a note to the conductor near the end of the score. “It is up to you to sculpt the moment as you see fit.” Once more the opening signal, ringing as the strings air bow, instructed musicians to “make no sound ‘on’ your highest string.”</p>
<p>L.A. Phil conductor Gustavo Dudamel, left, takes in applause with composer Andrew Norman after a performance of Norman’s centennial commission, “Sustain,” at Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles on Nov. 2, 2019. (Brian van der Brug/Los Angeles Times)</p>
<p>In his program note, Norman says “Sustain” is about his and our relation to the Earth. He credits sadness and loss in the music to this critical moment in history when we are not doing enough to sustain our planet. “Sustain” was played Saturday as L.A. and its environs burned. Loss was palpable.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Dudamel sped everything up ever so slightly from a year ago, adding a new sense of urgency. The L.A. Phil played with a remarkable confidence. Music, just vibrations in the air that don’t last, can’t save the world. But it can, and “Sustain” does, give us resolve.</p>
<p>Superficially, Bruckner’s Fourth Symphony suits “Sustain.” Bruckner is a composer for whom sound is a drug. Like Norman, he separates structure from form, from what we actually perceive. Counterpoint is design. You give yourself to string tremolos and to brass outbursts. Repetition solidifies. What Bruckner here hoped to sustain was his own sanity through spirituality, and for him, a massive orchestra is needed to get divine attention.</p>
<p>The Fourth is a staple of the L.A. Phil, which has recorded the symphony four times. Unlike the unstable “Sustain,” the Fourth is meant to leave you not just satisfied but also satiated. Sustaining tradition in an effusive yet propulsive performance under Dudamel, the symphony did just that once more.</p>
<p>Two hours later, at the Shatto Recreation Center on the outskirts of Koreatown, the L.A. Phil made yet another gesture at orchestral sustainability with a performance by the YOLA CDMX Tour Orchestra. The 96-member ensemble — students and alumni ages 10 to 21 from the various Youth Orchestra Los Angeles centers — will travel with the L.A. Phil to Mexico City, where it will perform with 100 Mexican student musicians under Dudamel.</p>

<p>This warmup concert was conducted by a new Dudamel fellow, Enluis Montes Olivar, a 22-year-old Venezuelan. He was a firebrand on the podium who whipped the kids up into a spirited and contagious, yet impressively disciplined, frenzy in short pieces, including Arturo Marquez’s “Danzón No. 2.”</p>
<p>A dozen years old, and growing by leaps and bounds, YOLA has become an example of the arts as an essential agent of sustainability for the future of L.A. Now we need to put out the fires and clean up the air so that the young musicians can properly breathe new life into our environment. Might not this also be a good moment for Norman, who is about to become a father, to write YOLA players a piece? They’re ready.

<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a6f43f2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+158/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd0%2Fa2%2Fef76ba0d43bfb41e38cb4ae0bc3e%2Fla-photos-1staff-471213-la-et-cm-la-phil-dudamel-review-2-brv.jpg" alt="img">
The Los Angeles Philharmonic on Wednesday announced a 2020-21 Walt Disney Concert Hall season lineup that spotlights Pan-American artists and issues, including slavery and incarceration, 1970s U.S.-China relations and the representation of female composers over time.</p>
<p>With Music and Artistic Director Gustavo Dudamel leading the way, about half the featured artists will be women or people of color.</p>
<p>“One of the big things that we’re trying to do this season,“ Chief Executive Chad Smith said, “is really advance this idea that Gustavo has been initiating for so long, which is to shift the musical center of gravity for our art form further west and further south. We come from an art form which historically was European and largely male. How do we, over time, change that?“</p>
<p>The 2020-21 season will kick off a five-year Pan-American Music Initiative that will include 30 to 40 new commissions, recording projects and collaborations with individuals and cultural institutions from across the Americas. The inaugural year will be curated by Mexican composer Gabriela Ortiz, whom Smith calls “one of the most important voices in contemporary Mexican classical music.“ Dudamel will conduct the late Argentine composer Alberto Ginastera’s “Estancia” ballet, with choreography by Brazilian dance troupe Grupo Corpo.</p>
<p>The new series “America: The Stories We Tell” considers the ways in which myths, folktales, operas and other stories shape our collective identity. It opens with the world premiere of a commissioned orchestral piece by Puerto Rican composer Angélica Negrón and later explores the music of late American experimental composer Pauline Oliveros, who created “deep listening,” a musical experience drawing on improvisation, meditation, electronic music and ritual. “America” also will include Gershwin’s “Porgy and Bess” paired with works by Florence Price and William Grant Still, as well as a concert performance ofJohn Adams’ “Girls of the Golden West” and Dudamel conducting Bernstein’s Symphonic Dances from “West Side Story.”</p>

<p>Julia Bullock’s mixed-media concert “History’s Persistent Voice” will close the series. The performance weaves slave narratives from the 1860s, Jim Crow-era stories and modern-day incarceration experiences, and it features newly commissioned music by American women of color.</p>
<p>The L.A. Phil will host a weeklong “Seoul Festival,” curated by composer Unsuk Chin, guest-conducted by Shi-Yeon Sung and featuring leading Korean musicians, composers and conductors. It’s a “deep dive into the contemporary musical culture of Seoul,“ Smith said, that includes seven U.S. and world premieres as well as lectures and panel discussions.</p>
<p>“In these divided times, it has never been more important for us to remember all that unites us,” Dudamel said in the announcement.</p>
<p>The 2020-21 season will have 27 commissions, including a new violin concerto by Andrew Norman, whose “Sustain” last month earned the L.A. Phil its second Grammy Award in company history, and the U.S. premiere of Thomas Adès’ full, 90-minute ballet “Inferno, Purgatory, and Paradise,” inspired by Dante and conducted by Dudamel.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>The season includes two staged operas: the return of “Tristan Project“, which premiered at Disney Hall in 2004 conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen, directed by Peter Sellars and staged with visuals by artist Bill Viola; and John Adams’ “Nixon in China,” conducted by Dudamel. Gerald Barry’s “Salome” will get its world premiere in a concert performance conducted by and starring Barbara Hannigan.</p>
<p>Other season highlights include pianist Yuja Wang performing all four Rachmaninoff piano concertos, with Dudamel conducting; former L.A. Phil associate conductor Mirga Grazinyte-Tyla conducting her City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, with cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason; and Hannigan in “Supernova,” an immersive, multimedia concert.</p>
<p>“We want our programming to enlighten and inspire audiences, certainly, but we also want this work to foster conversations,” Smith said. “We want it to ask questions, we want people to recognize that our art form has something to say about our human experience today — even if the music is 200 years old.“</p>

<h3 id="not-bach-or-beethoven-but-leroy-anderson-is-the-composer-for-now">&ldquo;Not Bach or Beethoven, but Leroy Anderson Is the Composer for Now&rdquo;</h3>

In the midst of a pandemic, those of us who are healthy, safe and able to work from home are of course lucky. Still, time can pass slowly when you’re cooped up in a Manhattan apartment. So the other day, I listened to my favorite piece about the ticktock of time: Leroy Anderson’s “The Syncopated Clock.”</p>
<p>Anderson, who died in 1975, was the unrivaled master of the light orchestral miniature. Starting in the late 1930s, he wrote more than 50 of them — breezy yet carefully constructed works that became reassuring staples of pops programs. During our present moment of crisis, Bach provides solace, Beethoven stirs us with resolve and Brahms probes aching emotional ambiguities.</p>
<p>But trust me: Leroy Anderson will make you feel better about things.</p>
<p>And “The Syncopated Clock,” written in 1945, is a two-and-a-half-minute masterpiece. I hear the music as expressing a dutiful clock’s restlessness. As the strings play a genial, ambling theme, a percussion instrument mimics a clock’s ticktocks as the seconds pass.

<h3 id="review-three-conductors-three-concerts-and-more-la-phil-history-in-the-books">&ldquo;Review: Three conductors, three concerts and more L.A. Phil history in the books&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/36c8bba/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3694x1939+0+127/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F68%2Fd7%2Fc49937ce4778862db1a970c4070c%2F470248-la-et-cm-la-phil-centennial-gala-review-09c-fo.jpg" alt="img">
Most orchestra-going Angelenos can be expected to know Zubin Mehta, Esa-Pekka Salonen and Gustavo Dudamel. They are the three living Los Angeles Philharmonic music directors, encompassing 57 years of the orchestra’s history. They also happen to be three of the biggest names in the business and celebrities in town.</p>
<p>Many of us grew up with one of them. They all have had affectionate L.A. nicknames, although Mehta has long outgrown the 1960s Zubie Baby and Dudamel, more recently, The Dude. Salonen’s is E-P. Mehta (now conductor emeritus) and Salonen (conductor laureate) never severed connections with the orchestra and remain loyal to the community. We may easily kid ourselves into thinking we have a good idea of what to expect from them.</p>
<p>There was no kidding possible, however, at Walt Disney Concert Hall this past weekend when each conductor spent an evening with his orchestra as part of the L.A. Phil’s 100th birthday party. For the gala on the big night Thursday, Mehta, Salonen and Dudamel each led a work or two, followed by the premiere of “From Space I Saw Earth” for three conductors, which Icelandic composer Daníel Bjarnason wrote for the occasion. Then it was time for the maestros to come down from the clouds and show what they really can do.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>On Friday night, Mehta picked Mahler’s 80-minute Second Symphony (“Resurrection”). There are recordings of him conducting it with the Vienna Philharmonic in 1975, the New York Philharmonic in 1982 and the Israel Philharmonic in 1994. They are all quite similar, showing off potent orchestral attacks, knife-sharp edges. Instrumental colors are neon-lit. Everything is geared toward climaxes, which come with devastating force. Just whose resurrection is this anyway, you might ask? Godzilla’s?</p>
<p>The recordings are compulsively listenable, as was Friday’s bigger, grander and more gripping performance. After a two-year battle with cancer, the 83-year-old conductor got onstage using a cane, which he then cavalierly dropped on the floor before taking a seat to conduct.</p>
<p>It turns out all those attention-getting old Mehta gestures were just that. The integrity of the music-making came from elsewhere, and never was that more apparent in the sheer intensity of sound — deep, rich, all-suffusing — he could get from the L.A. Phil, with his two vocal soloists, Golda Schultz and Mihoko Fujimura, and the Los Angeles Master Chorale equally meeting Mehta on his own exulted level. He’ll be back conducting the “Resurrection” with the L.A. Phil in January. Your Christmas shopping may have just gotten easier.</p>
<p>Like Mehta, Salonen was in very familiar territory Saturday night. Between two pieces by his fellow Finnish composer Sibelius, Salonen sandwiched the premiere of a piece that the L.A. Phil commissioned from him for its past centennial season but which Salonen only now finished.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Four years ago, Salonen led a force-of-nature performance of Sibelius’ Fifth Symphony with his London orchestra, the Philharmonia, in Orange County. He gave the premiere of the first part of his own “Gemini” with the L.A. Phil last season. Salonen finally finished the second part in time to give that premiere the week before introducing a less well-balanced program featuring an excellent, if hardly necessary, conventional performance of Tchaikosvky‘s ubiquitous Violin Concerto, featuring sumptuous young soloist Daniel Lozakovich. Bartók’s Concerto for Orchestra was the highlight.</p>
<p>Salonen originally dubbed the two sections of “Gemini” after twins from Greek mythology, “Pollux” and “Castor.” The movements are held together by a postgrunge bass line Salonen heard in a Paris restaurant and wrote down on a napkin. Two tympani beat it out, dramatically slowed down. The rest of the piece is airy, slow, moody, harmonically hazy. When I first heard “Pollux” last year, it entranced but didn’t feel finished — because it wasn’t.</p>
<p>Now there is “Castor,” which is an adrenaline rush, spectacularly orchestrated and rhythmically exhilarating. It is a conductor’s piece, meant to dazzle. During rehearsals of “Castor,” Salonen replaced bass drums with Japanese taiko drums, and on Saturday he made the same change with “Pollux.” There is also a very brief new transition between the two, creating a just-under-24-minute whole, a satisfying two-parter of anticipation and release full of never-predictable twists and turns.</p>
<p>Salonen began the program with Finnish myth, the seldom-heard “Luonnotar.” A dramatic tone poem for soprano and orchestra, this 10-minute sketch of an opera Sibelius never wrote is a visceral account of an incident in the Finnish epic poem “Kalevala.” Schultz was again the imposing soloist. Still, for all of his evocative theater music, Sibelius wasn’t an opera composer. His Fifth is fluid music, rather without a dramatic road map to follow, instead setting symphonic waves in motion that take you where they will. Salonen’s overwhelmingly vivid performance, visionary and Romantic at the same time, had what virtual realty can only thus far dream of — the grandiosity of sense of place without the artificiality.</p>

<p>Sunday afternoon Dudamel conducted Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, the “Ode to Joy” being one of his calling cards. He’s led big, big Ninths here reflecting big, big moments, such as the 2009 free Hollywood Bowl concert to begin his music directorship. He also has conducted the symphony with two big orchestras together, the L.A. Phil and his Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela. He has experimented, as well, with what to introduce the symphony, usually trying to find a piece that deals with Beethovenian brotherhood from a different angle.</p>

<p>This time he commissioned Mexican composer Gabriela Ortiz, who came up with a startlingly original idea: a piece that could also become a sketch for an opera, “Yanga,” for percussion ensemble, orchestra and chorus. Gaspar Yanga is a forgotten 16th century freedom fighter, a Mexican slave and former African prince who became a Robin Hood, stealing from the rich to buy his people liberty. With a text by Santiago Martín Bermúdez along with Congo chants sung by the Master Chorale, the score included solos for African percussion instruments, which were played by Tambuco Percussion Quartet.</p>
<p>Like Salonen, Ortiz has a slow, atmospheric and harmonically arresting introduction, though a brief one, before her rhythmically compelling evocation of Yanga, an operatic hero if there ever was one. I hope Ortiz, who does seem to have an opera in her, actually writes one.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Dudamel’s Beethoven Nine was the last surprise. In the past he’s dwelt on the monumental nature of the score. Now, he’s exchanged that for speed, relying on spine-tingling orchestral virtuosity in a suave, streamlined performance unlike any Beethoven he has conducted here in the past.</p>
<p>The rethinking offered new emphasis on interior lines and a velocity that expected Beethoven’s heaviest symphony to fly on insect’s wings. In so doing, it became practically a matter of life and death that the Master Chorale and vocal soloists Schultz, Tamara Mumford, Mario Chang and James Rutherford had to keep up with an unstoppable L.A. Phil, and they managed. Freedom, Dudamel demanded with “Yanga” and this “Ode to Joy,” can’t wait.

<h3 id="review-steve-reich-makes-a-rare-venture-into-the-orchestra">&ldquo;Review: Steve Reich Makes a Rare Venture Into the Orchestra&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/06/arts/06reich/06nyphil-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
But his use of the orchestra reveals a composer confident in his idiom, reaching out for new effects. Those “simpler” strings, while not intrinsically complex, lent moments of piercing harmony to the orchestral textures during the first movement, as the more featured instruments engaged in thrilling volleys of canonic imitation. Occasional eruptions from an electric bass often announced new motifs in the ensemble, and had intense power.</p>
<p>The work is written in arch form, in five movements that keep the tempo the same but change the length of the notes being played to convey the illusion of transition from fast to slower to fast. Around the midpoint there was also room for a sense of reverie, as the churning pianos familiar from some of Mr. Reich’s past works were allowed to relent (briefly). In its final moments, the piece took on the feeling of a meditative exhalation, suggesting prior touchstones like “Music for 18 Musicians,” without seeming derivative.</p>
<p>The Philharmonic players savored the sounds. Some scintillating passages for trumpets and vibraphones were brimming with a metallic resonance that the orchestra and its music director, Jaap van Zweden, balanced beautifully with the strings and winds. It was a good night for the orchestra, in general, in a program otherwise devoted to Beethoven.</p>
<p>In that composer’s Symphony No. 2, Mr. van Zweden suppressed his characteristic impulse toward feverish dynamic intensity, leading a suave and engaging performance that built to a satisfying climax. If the Larghetto was a touch draggy, Mr. van Zweden made up for it during the quiet middle movement of Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 4. There, in partnership with the soloist, Yefim Bronfman, this conductor created a chilly sense of mystery. Mr. Bronfman was in touch with the concerto’s quick-changing energies throughout — ramping from naïvely winning melodies to stormy outbursts with reliable command.</p>
<p>This program of classics plus an exciting contemporary work is exactly the kind of eclectic, highly enjoyable evening that an elite orchestra can and should pull off regularly. But as I looked around Geffen Hall on Thursday, I wondered whether the audiences that pack the Brooklyn Academy of Music for Mr. Reich’s performances were aware of this major local premiere. This week, the Philharmonic’s website has been advertising an evening of “Bronfman and Beethoven.” That’s true enough, but hardly the whole story. This orchestra has changed its approach to the repertoire in recent years — but marketing habits die hard.</p>
<p>New York Philharmonic</p>
<p>This program is repeated through Saturday at David Geffen Hall, Lincoln Center; 212-875-5656, nyphil.org.
