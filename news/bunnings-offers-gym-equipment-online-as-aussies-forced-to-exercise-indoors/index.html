DIY and trade giant Bunnings has begun selling fitness equipment online as Australians look to exercise indoors following the closure of gyms nationwide.</p>
<p>Available via Bunning&rsquo;s online MarketLink site, Adidas-branded equipment like yoga mats, foam rollers, push-up bars and weighted vests are now on sale.</p>
<p>The retail giant is also offering larger equipment including treadmills, rowing machines, exercise bikes and cross trainers from $349.</p>
<p>The equipment, available only to online customers, will be shipped to your door. (Bunnings MarketLink)</p>
<p>The products are available online only, and are sourced by what Bunnings calls &ldquo;trusted third party sellers&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If purchased, the products will be delivered directly to customers by the third-party sellers. They are not available for click and collect orders and cannot be found in Bunnings stores.</p>
<p>Bunnings Managing Director Mike Schneider has announced a range of measures to keep the retail giant operating during new social distancing protocols, such as suspending sausage sizzles and encouraging customers to use cashless payments where possible.</p>

<p>From Monday this week, all stores now have a dedicated two-hour window from 7am to 9am for trade customers as well as health and emergency workers.</p>
<p>Stores will be open to the general public from 9am to 7pm, after which employees will conduct a deep clean of all touchable surfaces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know our customers need access to products to maintain their homes and we want to stay open for our customers to make these items available, while also putting measures in place to keep them safe,&rdquo; Mr Schneider said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our health and emergency services workers are doing an incredible job and we want them to have an opportunity to access the products they need.</p>
<p>Bunnings revealed they will be restricting the amount of certain products. (Twitter: Christine Ahern)</p>
<p>&ldquo;For tradies, it&rsquo;s about keeping their businesses running and getting the items they need to help with vital maintenance and repair projects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On weekends, when Bunnings receives a high amount of customer foot traffic, small stores will deliberately enforce numbers of shoppers inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We also want customers to be aware that there may be some delays in our busier stores across the weekend as we do everything we can to ensure social distancing measures,&rdquo; Mr Schneider said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This could be anything from less checkouts in operation, to limiting customer numbers in store, it will be different store to store depending on how busy they are and we&rsquo;ll do the best we can to get everyone in and out as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We really appreciate just how understanding our customers have been and thank them sincerely for their support in giving us the opportunity to support them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Monday evening the NSW Government was evaluating closing large retail stores such as Bunnings, Kmart and Officeworks in an effort to avoid large groups of people gathering.</p>

Most products are Adidas and the range includes boxing gloves, resistance bands, treadmills, elliptical machines, weighted vests, exercise bikes and rowing machines.</p>
<p>Prices are reasonable: a treadmill will set you back under $500 while a bike is going for less than $300.</p>
<p>Bunnings</p>
<p>In recent weeks Bunnings has been subjected to the panic buying experienced by the major supermarkets. As a result the store cracked down on the amount of product each shopper can purchase.</p>
<p>Appearing on Today last week,Bunnings managing director Michael Schneider said the measures were in place to make sure nobody missed out on vital supplies.</p>
<p>“As the uncertainty continues we want to make sure we can reassure customers that if you come to Bunnings you can get the products you are looking for,” Mr Schneider said.</p>
<p>“And you can get the things done at home you need to.”

coronavirus, bunnings, covid-19, coronavirus, workout equipment, bunnings selling workout equipment, buy gym equipment online</p>
<p>Forget lifting bags of potting mix or pulling along loaded tool boxes, Bunnings has cut out the DIY middle man and is now stocking treadmills and exercise bikes as it braces against the COVID-19 economic climate. It seems to fly in the face of the do it yourself aspect of what is arguably one of the nation&rsquo;s favourite retailers, but then again this is a pandemic. Anything goes. The hardware giant proclaims it has teamed up with third-party sellers &ldquo;to expand our online offer&rdquo;, it has announced on its website. &ldquo;Available through Bunnings.com.au, MarketLink enables you to access a wide offer of products sold directly by our Trusted Sellers,&rdquo; it declared. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ll have a greater choice in one place to complete your home improvement and lifestyle needs.&rdquo; Those needs include fridges, freezers, home gym equipment, furniture, bedding and home decor. Read more: You can even buy fresh flowers (handy for saying sorry after that WFH argument with your partner), TVs (perfect for binge-watching Netflix) and a range of small appliances (because you need coffee NOW). Bunnings has a solid company of leading brands along for the new venture, with household names such as Westinghouse, LG, Jamie Oliver, Kitchenaid, Philips and Tefal listed on the website.
