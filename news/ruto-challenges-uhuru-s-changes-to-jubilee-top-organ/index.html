<p>The war between President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto for the control of Jubilee Party has been reignited following proposed changes to one of its top decision-making organs — the National Management Committee.</p>
<p>In a Kenya Gazette notice dated April 6, 2020, Registrar of Political Parties Anne Nderitu gave notice of the party’s intention to change its officials following the presentation of the list by the ruling party.</p>
<p>All those challenging the changes are allied to DP Ruto. The political outfit has forwarded five new names appointed by the party leader — President Kenyatta — to the powerful National Management Committee following the exit of three others.</p>
<p>In the gazette notice, Ms Nderitu lists the new National Management Committee officials as Lucy Nyawira Macharia, Prof Marete Marangu, former Kitutu Masaba MP Walter Nyambati, Jane Nampaso and James Waweru.</p>
<p>The team is in charge of the day-to-day management of the party alongside the National Executive Committee.</p>
<p>FRAUD</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Former secretary-general Veronica Maina, Fatuma Shukri and Pamela Mutua resigned after securing jobs in government, according to the party’s Secretary-General Raphael Tuju.</p>
<p>But the proposed changes made by President Kenyatta have drawn strong protest from DP Ruto and his troops.</p>
<p>“As Kenyans are focused on the Covid-19 pandemic, some shadowy characters are attempting to fraudulently institute illegal changes in officials of Jubilee party. As deputy party leader, I have alerted the registrar of the fraud. Party members should know that the matter is being handled,” Dr Ruto tweeted Friday.</p>
<p>Before tweeting, the DP had written to Ms Nderitu on Friday to officially object to the proposed changes from his own boss.</p>
<p>“I have noted a gazette notice … purporting to change the membership of Jubilee party’s National Management Committee (NMC). Please note that NMC has never been reconstituted by the party neither have we ever convened NEC (National Executive Committee) to reconstitute NMC.</p>
<p>“In light of the foregoing, the intended changes of the NMC membership is, therefore, illegal and fraudulent,” the DP wrote.</p>
<p>PROTEST LETTERS</p>
<p>Some of the legislators who have written the coordinated protest letters to the registrar are National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale, deputy secretary-general Caleb Kositany (Soy), MPs Kimani Ichung’wah (Kikuyu), John Kiarie (Dagoreti South) and Nixon Korir (Langáta), among others.</p>
<p>“Any changes involving the party in any way must be sanctioned by the relevant party organs through a formal meeting convened and resolutions and passed. And, therefore, the purported changes to the membership of the National Management committee or any other organ of the party is illegal and fraudulent and affront to the values of the party,” said the letter by the MPs.</p>
<p>A similar letter was written by Jubilee national treasurer Alfred Mutai, who said the National Executive Committee that could have sanctioned the changes has not met for the past three years.</p>
<p>National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale also opposed the changes and asked for minutes that accompanied the changes.</p>
<p>There are claims that at least 150 legislators allied to the DP have written protest letters to the registrar.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Ms Nderitu confirmed receiving the letters but could not divulge the exact number.</p>
<p>“I know there are a number of those who have protested, a majority through email, but at this point in time, I cannot tell how many they are,” Ms Nderitu said.</p>
<p>PROCEDURE FOLLOWED</p>
<p>She disclosed that the legislators were within their rights to raise concerns.</p>
<p>In the notice, the registrar wrote: “Any person with written submissions concerning the intended change by the political party shall within seven days from the date herein (April 6), deposit them with the registrar of political parties.”</p>
<p>It is not clear why the legislators chose to protest individually, but sources close to the DP’s Tangatanga camp disclosed that the move was to exert extra pressure of the registrar.</p>
<p>Mr Tuju said there was no cause for alarm as the officials replaced had secured government appointments and, accordingly, resigned as per the law.</p>
<p>“We have certain members of our NEC and the National Management Committee who resigned for various reasons. They either got jobs, which would result into a conflict with their positions in the party,” Mr Tuju told Saturday Nation.</p>
<p>“All resignations have to go to the president, who is the Jubilee Party leader with reasons for resignation. He accepts the resignations and appoints replacement and that is exactly what happened,” Mr Tuju said.</p>
<p>RESIGNATION RESCINDED</p>
<p>The advisory council made up of former chairpersons of the defunct parties that dissolved to form Jubilee also said they were in agreement made by Mr Kenyatta.</p>
<p>“We appreciate and fully support our party leader in his recent reorganisation of the leadership of the party and wish to welcome the reconstituted Party National Management Committee,” read the statement by former Ford People chairman Albert Nyaundi.</p>
<p>The list also has Jubilee vice-chairman David Murathe, who had earlier announced his resignation.</p>
<p>But Mr Tuju said the “resignation was not accepted by the party leader”. Others are Mr Tuju, Mr Kositany, Mr Nelson Dzuya (chairman) and Mr Mutai (treasurer).

<h3 id="ruto-explains-why-he-is-not-seen-with-uhuru-regularly">Ruto explains why he is not seen with Uhuru regularly</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/ureport-uploads/FILE-1586424428.jpg" alt="img">
SUMMARY “We consult regularly…almost daily with the President and all the other ministers involved in the management of this pandemic. “The operations of government are a preserve of the people in government…we took a decision that this being a national pandemic, all of us are going to read from one script,” he said.</p>
<p>Deputy President William Ruto on Thursday cleared the air on why he has not been in the company of President Uhuru Kenyatta in the past few weeks.</p>
<p>Each time the President has addressed the nation, DP Ruto has been conspicuously absent, raising eyebrows.</p>
<p>While addressing the nation from his Karen residence, the DP stated that he has been in constant communication with the Head of State and all the ministers involved in fighting COVID-19.</p>
<p>He added that the Cabinet has adopted teleconferencing and video conferencing as part of maintaining social distancing.</p>
<p>“We consult regularly…almost daily with the President and all the other ministers involved in the management of this pandemic.</p>
<p>“The operations of government are a preserve of the people in government…we took a decision that this being a national pandemic, all of us are going to read from one script,” he said.</p>
<p>See Also: China fears second coronavirus outbreak may come from overseas visitors</p>
<p>Adding: We are making teleconferencing and video conferencing a big portion of government communication to facilitate social distancing and to avoid physical meetings.”</p>
<p>While emphasizing the seriousness of the pandemic, the DP also posed a question to the journalists:</p>
<p>“You may want to ask yourself why the President and his deputy cannot travel in the same equipment [sic] at any one time and in a situation like this, the answer to that question may help you understand why we are like this at the moment,” he remarked.</p>
<p>The DP urged Kenyans to continue practicing the measures issued by the government saying they are simple but very effective.</p>

<h3 id="uhuruto-wars-at-play-in-bid-to-remove-waiguru">UhuRuto wars at play in bid to remove Waiguru</h3>
<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_jT79GsjrfHbwohlwikAvZDg9A2rieej8AKzD6kTqfbhC_XukvB3-QhC5HgNqGWFo_8usYhaSuWLArWbvFBiB0volNfzaA=s1000" alt="img">
President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy William Ruto’s proxy wars are at play in a bid to save Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru, who is a facing censure motion and possible impeachment</p>
<p>Already, allies of the two leaders have taken strategic positions, firing salvos as they seek to outdo each other in a typical Tangatanga-Kieleweke supremacy battles.</p>
<p>Ruto’s allies from Kirinyaga and Mt Kenya region have come out to back Waiguru’s impeachment and sensationally claim there&rsquo;s a plot hatched at State House and Jubilee headquarters to save the besieged governor.</p>
<p>Governor Waiguru is a known Uhuru’s loyalist.</p>
<p>ithinji (Gichugu), GK Kariuki (Ndia) and Woman Representative Wangui Ngirici, all allied to the DP, have backed MCAs&rsquo; bid to impeach Waiguru.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;lynch mob&rsquo; of Kirinyaga MPs has been backed by another vocal Ruto ally from the region, Gatundu South MP Moses Kuria.</p>
<p>The Ruto allies openly sided with the MCAs, even as they spewed vitriol against Uhuru’s men led by Jubilee secretary general Raphael Tuju who had sought to remove the Majority leader James Murango for violating the party&rsquo;s position in pushing Waiguru’s removal.</p>
<p>Kuria first took a swipe at the CS without portfolio, accusing him of overstepping his mandate, rallying MCAs to reclaim their party from handpicked leaders at the Thika Road Jubilee headquarters.</p>
<p>“To all Jubilee MCAs countrywide: The Party HQ will no longer intimidate or blackmail you. Not as long as I live. Enough is Enough. No longer Owner-Occupier mentality in Jubilee. The tenants want their party back,” Kuria said.</p>
<p>“For far too long, the Jubilee Secretariat has been carrying out party affairs with reckless abandon. One would be forgiven for thinking the unelected officials at the Secretariat do own the party. According to our records, the Jubilee Party had not sought from the Registrar of Political Parties an extension of the term of the interim officials. Mr Tuju and his team are therefore in the office illegally.”</p>
<p>Days after Kuria’s scathing statement, Kirinyaga MPs followed with another hard-hitting script, again targeted at the secretary general.</p>
<p>“Hon Murango is not a party appointee; he was elected by the Kirinyaga County Assembly MCAs and only they can remove him in accordance with the County Assembly Standing Orders,” the MPs said in a signed statement.</p>
<p>“He (Tuju) should forthwith stop interfering and intimidating Kirinyaga MCAs from carrying out their oversight role.”</p>
<p>But Tuju, speaking to the Star on the phone, dismissed claims that he is being used by President Kenyatta to save Waiguru. He said the Kirinyaga matter was a disciplinary issue after the Majority leader declined to toe the party line.</p>
<p>He said the party advised Murango to wait until the issues of the coronavirus are over then they revisit the Waiguru issues, which he defied.</p>
<p>“If you defy the party position we deal with you. It doesn’t matter whether it is Waiguru, we did the same to all counties which are answerable to us,” Tuju said.</p>
<p>“They can say everything they want that we are protecting Waiguru, that I have been given money but if we speak to you and you defy us, we deal with you. We did the same thing in Nairobi and we will do it anywhere else.”</p>
<p>On Thursday, Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro declined to confirm Kieleweke-Tangatanga wars in Kirinyaga’s leadership wrangles.</p>
<p>But political analyst Joseph Mutua said the happenings in Kirinyaga have little to do with issues facing the county but the 2022 succession politics.</p>
<p>Mutua said the stand by legislators allied to the Deputy President in the situation in the county says it all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The governor is very close to the President and has been one of the leaders from Mt Kenya who have vigorously supported the BBI. Since allies of Ruto appear to think that Uhuru may not support Ruto in 2022, they want to loosen the President&rsquo;s grip of the region,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>Mutua, while saying it was the wrong time for leaders to engage in such politics because of the Covid-19 pandemic, further said there could be a plot to destroy leaders from Mt Kenya region who are not pro Ruto.</p>
<p>He recalled that Ruto does not have a very good history with Waiguru, especially when she was a Devolution Cabinet Secretary.</p>
<p>Waiguru is facing a myriad of allegations, including gross violation of the Constitution, among others by not delivering the annual State of the County address to the assembly.</p>
<p>The governor is further accused undermining the assembly by not submitting county plans and policies to the assembly for approval and also failing to table an annual report on the implementation status of the county policies and plans.</p>
<p>The governor is also accused of violating the Pubic Procurement and Disposal Act and the Public Finance and Management Act by establishing an irregular Tender Evaluation Committee composed of her partisan staff — Pauline Kamau and Wayne Gichira - who allegedly take direct instructions from her. They alternate as chairpersons of all major Tender Evaluation Committees. contrary to the Constitution to act as conduits to award tenders her preferred bidders.</p>
<p>The governor has dismissed these and other accusations as a witch-hunt.
