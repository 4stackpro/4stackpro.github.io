Mr. Prine later wrote a ruefully bitter song titled “Paradise,” in which he sang:</p>
<p>The coal company came with the world’s largest shovel</p>
<p>And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land</p>
<p>Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken</p>
<p>Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man</p>
<p>John grew up in a country music-loving family. He learned guitar as a young teenager from his grandfather and brother and began writing songs.</p>
<p>After graduating from high school, he worked for the Post Office for two years before being drafted into the Army, which sent him to West Germany in charge of the motor pool at his base. After being discharged, he resumed his mail route, in and around his hometown, composing songs in his head.</p>
<p>“I always likened the mail route to a library with no books,” he wrote on his website. “I passed the time each day making up these little ditties.”</p>

<p>Reluctantly, he took the stage for the first time at an open-mic night at a small Chicago club called the Fifth Peg, where his performance met with profound silence from the audience. “They just sat there,” Mr. Prine later wrote. “They didn’t even applaud, they just looked at me.”</p>
<p>Then the clapping began. “It was like I found out all of a sudden that I could communicate deep feelings and emotions,” he wrote. “And to find that out all at once was amazing.”

<h3 id="bruce-springsteen-pays-tribute-to-john-prine-his-death-just-makes-me-angry">Bruce Springsteen Pays Tribute to John Prine: “His Death Just Makes Me Angry”</h3>

<p>Bruce Springsteen used his SirusXM radio show on Wednesday to play a selection of stories and songs for “these uncertain times.” That included a tribute to fellow songwriting legend John Prine, who died on Tuesday due to complications from the coronavirus.</p>
<p>“John Prine was a sweet and lovely man, and I was proud to count him as my friend,” Springsteen said during the broadcast. “He wrote music of towering compassion with an almost unheard of precision and creativity when it came to observing the fine details of ordinary lives. He was a writer of great humor, funny, with wry sensitivity. It has marked him as a complete original.”</p>
<p>“His death just makes me angry,” Springsteen added. “He was simply one of the best we had, and we will miss him.” He then played Prine’s seminal track “Angel From Montgomery”.</p>
<p>Springsteen also paid tribute to Prine on social media. After first learning of Prine’s passing, Springsteen wrote on Twitter, “Over here on E Street, we are crushed by the loss of John Prine. John and I were ‘New Dylans’ together in the early 70s and he was never anything but the loveliest guy in the world. A true national treasure and a songwriter for the ages. We send love and prayers to his family.”</p>
<p>As Rolling Stone points out, Springsteen and Prine performed live together at least once: in 1988, Springsteen joined Prine to perform “Paradise” during a concert in Tarrytown, New York. Three years later, Springsteen contributed backing vocals to Prine’s song “Take a Look at My Heart”.</p>
<p>Among the countless other tributes to Prine are song covers of “Please Don’t Bury Me” by Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy and “Angel From Montgomery” by Dixie Chicks’ Natalie Maines”. Meanwhile, Brandi Carlie played her own recent collaboration with Prine, “Summer’s End”.</p>
<p>In a message posted to social media, Prine’s wife, Fiona, offered her gratitude for “the outpouring of love we have received from family, friends, and fans all over the world.” She added, “John will be so missed but he will continue to comfort us with his words and music and the gifts of kindness, humor and love he left for all of us to share.”</p>
<p>In lieu of flowers or gifts, Fiona Prine is asking that donation be made to one of the following non-profits: thistlefarms.org; roomintheinn.org; and nashvillerescuemission.org.
