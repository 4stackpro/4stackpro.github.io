In “Bad Education,” which premieres on HBO on April 25, Hugh Jackman plays Frank Tassone, a Roslyn, N.Y., school district superintendent who was a brilliant educator — and also a vain, charming and larcenous criminal. It’s a different type of role for Jackman, one Variety’s chief film critic Peter Debruge described as “a star at the height of his powers leveraging his own appeal to remind that even our heroes are fallible” — and also “the best work he’s ever done.” After premiering at the Toronto International Film Festival in September, “Bad Education” sold to HBO for close to $20 million, making it Jackman’s first major role in a television production since becoming a movie star in 2000 with “X-Men” (if an inadvertent one).</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Jackman spoke to Variety about the making of “Bad Education,” which is based on true events. Jackman discussed creating the character of Frank and promoting a movie during a pandemic.</p>
<p>What drew you to this role?</p>
<p>I was sent the script and I really liked it, but I thought, “This is gonna be tricky.” Because I couldn’t quite work out the tone from reading the script — it felt like three genres in one. And I knew it was a second-time director, Cory Finley, and I was like, “Okay, let me have a look at his first film.” And 20 minutes into “Thoroughbreds,” I was like, “I’m doing this film.” It was three genres in one!</p>
<p>And the role itself was something different from what I’ve done. I liked the idea of someone who is super successful, very, very good at what he did, beloved by the community — and fell down this slippery path. How can someone go from being on a pedestal in a community to being sent to prison? That part I found fascinating.</p>
<p>As you say, Frank is complicated. He’s passionate about education and helping students. At the same time, he has seemingly no problem bilking school funds! Tell me about reconciling those two sides of him.</p>
<p>He was one of the best superintendents. He’d gotten Roslyn High School from nowhere to No. 4 in the country. And he started many programs that are now standard around America. I think he thought of himself as a really positive member of the community, doing really good things. And I have to believe that he was justifying what he was doing. Somehow, the lie built on itself — that’s fascinating to me. I don’t think people go around going, “I’m the villain of this life! I’m the bad guy!” They believe, and they justify — they find a way to justify their actions.</p>
<p>It was vital to him how he was perceived, from his looks — literally his appearance — to how he did his job, to how he was perceived in the press, which was glowing, by the way.</p>
<p>I interviewed Mike Makowsky, the screenwriter, and he said that you had a huge packet of research about Frank. What did you learn about him that you applied to your performance?</p>
<p>I work with Amy Stevens, who’s amazing. She’s a dramaturg researcher. I was referred to her by Anne Hathaway, who used her on “Les Mis.” We ended up using all of her research, and she was just invaluable. We looked into heaps and heaps of books about him, the school, the school system, lying, the psychology of lying, how that can take hold and how people can live with themselves day to day. I learned, obviously, a lot about his background and his history, and a lot about how he was viewed by the public. After he went to prison, people came out with their misgivings about it. But very few, if any, said anything before that.</p>
<p>But clearly there was something about him that people didn’t quite get, or know. And then later, they put it down to, “It was because he was really gay or because he was really stealing.” There was something about him removed from the public, his colleagues, the staff. Very few people really saw the real Frank.</p>
<p>I’m from New York City, and I have to say that your Long Island accent is perfection.</p>
<p>Thank you! I’ve worked with Jess Platt for 20 years, literally from the second movie I ever did. I’ve had several producers when we’re doing the deal and I’m more worried about my dialect coach than anything else being like, “Really? He’s done 30 movies, and he doesn’t know it yet?” I say, “I have Jess there so I can get the subtleties of it, and I don’t have to worry about it.” If I’m thinking about my accent, I’m clearly not acting, you know?</p>
<p>A lot of people get the Long Island accent wrong. How would you describe it?</p>
<p>Frank, of course, spent a lot of time there. But he had a doctorate from Columbia. So we just tried to take the edge off it a little bit, so it didn’t go into too much caricature. I think for Frank, it was important to be one of the people, but also show that he was very educated.</p>

<p>Frank’s personal vanity, as you mentioned, is so intense. What did you want the audience to see in those scenes when you’re readying yourself in the mirror?</p>
<p>It really mattered to him, how he appeared to everybody. And it fed on itself, and got worse and worse, with facelifts and all this stuff that happened. I think it was this pursuit of perfection as a man, an educator, a boss, a liaison to the public. I saw it as part of the mask, part of creating — literally creating — every morning this image of perfection.</p>
<p>You’ve played so many heroes over the course of your career. Even as you’re playing Frank, people want to root for you. It’s what we’re used to doing.</p>
<p>Well, thank you. And if I have any kind of objectivity about how people see me as a human being, I think they probably think I’m a nice guy, like a good guy generally, right? I thought that would be powerful for the story as well. You know, just to help audiences to go in and not necessarily see the ending, so to speak. A slipperiness of truth is there for every single person. People can do the craziest things, and it just starts to feel normal. And you justify it. And so I think both the roles I’ve played, and possibly my own image helped. I thought it was good to play against that.</p>
<p>You played Peter Allen in “The Boy From Oz” on stage, but unless I’m mistaken, you haven’t played a gay man on screen. What went into making that decision?</p>
<p>Nothing, really. It was another layer to his deception. You have to remember, and I’m not sure if audiences will get it — but 2003 was very different to 2020. I spoke with a lawyer who’s gay and he said, “I definitely didn’t come out in 2003.” So for someone in such a public, front-facing role in a conservative Long Island neighborhood, it was understandable.</p>
<p>But there was more to it than that for him. He’s hiding — and then he was hiding from his partner also. And it just adds to the layers of him creating a version of himself that he thought would be successful. Being a gay man was not part of that. And that’s what was interesting to me.</p>
<p>What did you think about Frank having sex with one of his former students as an adult and getting into a relationship with him?</p>
<p>There’s nothing really implied that he was sort of grooming him at all. We’re not trying to create that narrative because I don’t think that’s the truth. There was something exciting about it for him, I think, just about a young man. We’re not, in the end, trying to paint a picture of an evil human being. We’re more or less trying to find a picture of someone who thinks they’re good and loses their way.</p>
<p>“Bad Education” was the big acquisition title at TIFF this year. What did you think when it sold to HBO?</p>
<p>I was thrilled that it sold. I remember when we were at Toronto, there were a lot of conversations about what’s happening with the theatrical business, particularly for dramas like this. And, you know, I don’t see this as a “Little Miss Sunshine” — like, I didn’t know what the theatrical prospects for it were. And that had really nothing to do with my decision when I took the role, I just thought this is a really interesting, complex story about human nature with a great young filmmaker.</p>
<p>Of course, originally I was thinking this is going to be a theatrical release, and I have only done theatrical releases, thank goodness, since “X-Men.” Trust me, I did some TV before that in Australia. So I was a little taken aback at first. But then I was like, “Oh, I actually think a lot more people will see this in this format.” So in that way, I was excited about it.</p>
<p>Normally, there’d be a huge Emmys campaign around you and the movie, but because of coronavirus, everything is so crazy and awful right now.</p>
<p>It’s not the time to deal with it. It’s really not. There’s just so much more important stuff going on. It’s weird timing. Having said that, you know, I’m at home with my family, and we’re trying to watch really good material. I’m trying to read really good books and listen to good music, and in that way, it’s something I think as actors and artists we can contribute.</p>
<p>Were you working on something that had to shut down?</p>
<p>No, we had just finished. I was working on “Reminiscence” with Lisa Joy from “Westworld,” who is directing her first film. And it is fantastic. We finished January 24. It was an amazing experience with Rebecca Ferguson, Thandie Newton, Lisa and her husband Jonah Nolan, who produced it. That movie’s in the can, but who knows when it’s coming out?</p>

<h3 id="bad-education-is-this-hugh-jackmans-greatest-performance-to-date">Bad Education: is this Hugh Jackman&rsquo;s greatest performance to date?</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4dd700aebefcf03a35602aba8f6a91a36ad0c9b7/438_0_1327_796/master/1327.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=2d794d42988765c42637bb4a2f187d49" alt="img">
When considering the public image that Hugh Jackman has spent an illustrious three-decade career cultivating, it helps to focus on a red carpet incident from 2013. Jackman’s at the Zurich film festival for the gala screening of Prisoners, where he runs into a familiar face in the press scrum outside the theater.</p>
<p>“Rollo!” Jackman says, his eyes lighting up in recognition; he’s identified Rollo Ross, a Los Angeles-based reporter and Jackman’s former phys-ed student from his days as a stand-in teacher during his gap year at Uppingham school in 1986. After nearly 30 years, Jackman identifies his former pupil and greets him as if they’re old friends, playfully ribbing him about maintaining his standards of physical education. He’s charm incarnate – too congenial and thoughtful to possibly be real. What human being remembers everyone they’ve ever met?</p>
<p>Bad Education review – Hugh Jackman steals embezzlement drama Read more</p>
<p>In the superb new HBO movie Bad Education, Hugh Jackman’s character starts to seem like another endearing illusion around the time that he does this exact same thing. Frank Tassone, the superintendent presiding over Long Island’s Roslyn high school and the No 4-ranked district that contains it, gets a drink from a bartender who happens to have once strode Roslyn’s halls. Tassone duly recalls not only the boy’s name, not only that he used to like writing science-fiction stories, but one of the plots dreamed up by his teenaged self.</p>
<p>Except this isn’t a scholastic administrator showing his dedication to the job. This is the beginning of a flirtation between the two men, and in a greater sense, the beginning of the end.</p>
<p>Cory Finley’s film tracks Tassone’s downfall, a scam of such hubris, folly and tragedy that it fits snugly in the Greek pantheon. Tassone skimmed millions from the school district budget to maintain a princely lifestyle with a husband unbeknown to everyone, from the co-workers buying his story about a deceased wife to the aforementioned boytoy kept in the dark. The ripped-from-the-headlines true story would be engrossing any way you slice it, but Jackman elevates the facts into a sublime dramatic work.</p>
<p>That’s not just because he gives the performance of his career, more studied and specific and fully-formed than we’ve ever seen, but because he brings an abundance of extra-textual baggage. The film confronts head-on the question of “Hugh Jackman”, the intuited public perception halfway between the real Jackman and his fictionalized persona of Tassone. The answer to this question, unsurprisingly, is complicated.</p>
<p>Jackman and Tassone excel by carefully maintaining an aura of absolute control. Frank Tassone is the sort of guy who makes the phrase “not a hair out of place” literal, with his sleek mane so raven-black it just has to be dyed. He’s introduced slugging activated-charcoal smoothies, part of a fitness regimen so obsessive we eventually learn regular facelifts help keep him in tip-top shape. That’s one of the first signs his total composure might be hiding something, as if behind the facade of cufflinks and cologne spritzes there’s only a big nothing. He uses his charisma to keep the world at an arm’s length, letting them see only the version of himself he’d like them to.</p>
<p>Even before The Greatest Showman made it official, Jackman was a consummate pro of stage and screen. He’s a paragon of excellence, the night-after-night dependability that made him a sensation on Broadway, where a person needs an entertainer’s soul and an athlete’s hustle to get by. Not even years of reprising his star-making Wolverine gig could make him seem rugged; his has always been a clean-cut machismo, polished to a sheen. This quality, combined with Jackman’s tendency to play personal matters close to the vest in interviews, has led some fans to see him as perhaps too perfect to be true. Jackman’s not one of those tell-all A-listers making content out of his privacy; he comes off like a movie star in the old Hollywood tradition, a seeming trick of the light, as much PR team as man.</p>
<p>Adding another fascinating wrinkle is Tassone’s homosexuality, kept to himself while not strictly closeted. This may be the gentlest and most vulnerable Jackman has ever permitted himself to appear on screen; one scene deals the veteran hoofer his greatest acting challenge by forcing him to be bad at dancing, having followed his younger boyfriend to a club where they at-first-tentatively get close to Moby’s In This World.</p>
<p>Watching Jackman shed his self-consciousness and allow Tassone to relax for the first time in the film lands with a disarming tenderness, in part because he’s nodding to rumors in our real world. Though he’s been married for years, Jackman still attracts murmurs, and he must have known this when agreeing to take this job. It would be more than a reach to describe the performance as confessional, but it cannot be denied as commentary.</p>
<p>Jackman finds the humanity in someone who’s forced himself to bury his down deep, for the sake of fitting into a rigid template of success. The brutal irony is that Tassone probably could have been openly gay if he wanted to – even in 2002, Long Island was pretty tolerant – but he forced himself to match a picture of a superintendent he had in his head. Perhaps not in regard to his sexual orientation, but Jackman has also conducted himself with an unflappable professionalism, fitting himself into a classical mold of movie stardom. As much as it has won him a massive fandom, it’s also rendered him somewhat unknowable to the sort of cinephile curious about the overlap between an actor’s work and self.</p>
<p>With his latest and greatest acting feat, however, he’s teased us with a couple of clues as to what happens when someone who’s always “on” finally goes off stage.

<h3 id="bad-education-hustlers-and-the-new-movies-you-can-now-watch-at-home">Bad Education, Hustlers, and the new movies you can now watch at home</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MpW6P1xzznvX8FzIa09Ey61Tku8=/86x0:3142x1600/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19922188/badeducation_0hero.jpg" alt="img">
Though the COVID-19 pandemic remains a public health concern, people still want to see movies. The desire to go out and see something has led to an uptick in attendance for drive-in movie theaters, and led restaurants to convert their parking lots into drive-in theaters. If you’re going to go out and watch a movie, the drive-in model has social distancing built in, making it a safer model than going to a traditional movie theater. (Georgia Governor Brian Kemp announced that businesses, including movie theaters, would be reopening in the state, a decision that has been slammed as unsafe.)</p>
<p>However, traditional movie theaters are still closed, which means that your best bet for entertainment this weekend is checking out what’s available to watch from the comfort of your own home. This weekend’s selection is heavy on independent films, whereas last week was full of blockbusters, with the digital releases of Fantasy Island, Underwater, and The Rhythm Section. The newly available movies, however, boast a great Hugh Jackman performance, as well as two Shea Whigham appearances, and are well worth catching.</p>
<p>Here are the new movies you can watch this weekend (including what’s new on Netflix), as well as where to find them.</p>
<p>Bad Education</p>
<p>Where to watch it: Bad Education premieres on HBO at 8 p.m. on Saturday, April 25, and will be available on HBO Now, HBO Go, and Amazon Prime Video afterward</p>
<p>The screenplay of Bad Education is based on events that occurred at Roslyn High School during the time that writer Mike Makowsky was a student there, namely superintendent Frank Tassone’s less-than-savory methods of making his school district one of the best in the country. Hugh Jackman stars as Tassone, with Allison Janney, Ray Romano, and Geraldine Viswanathan filling out the rest of the cast. In our review, Tasha Robinson praises Jackman for bolstering the squrim-worthy drama:</p>
<p>The film leans heavily on Jackman’s placid charm to carry not just the story, but the tone. Frank is scripted as a glad-handing administrator who prides himself on knowing everything about his people — not just the names of the school’s parents and students, but who they’re related to, what hobbies interest them, and so forth. But he rarely comes off as an oily salesman. Jackman normally specializes in much bigger and broader performances, whether he’s playing seething anti-hero Wolverine in various X-Men movies, or belting out Broadway-style tunes onstage or in musicals like The Greatest Showman and Les Misérables. Here, he’s much more human-sized, a slick but seemingly sincere functionary who’s found his exact level, and has the success record to prove it. He’s a beloved, award-winning administrator who authentically seems to care about the people around him, and Jackman sells both the sincerity, and the sense of something lurking under it.</p>
<p>Hustlers</p>
<p>Where to watch it: Rent on digital $0.99 on Amazon, Apple, and Google Play</p>
<p>Last year’s hit Hustlers costs less than a buck to rent this weekend, which makes it an absolute steal. Jennifer Lopez and Constance Wu star in this pulled-from-the-headlines story, which we call in our review “the female-led heist movie we’ve been waiting for.”</p>
<p>It’s difficult to imagine that any movie in theaters this year will be more sheer, rollicking fun — or more fabulous, or more full of feeling — than Lorene Scafaria’s Hustlers. Based on Jessica Pressler’s “The Hustlers at Scores,” the film upends expectations on multiple levels, providing the strippers at its center with the agency of which they’re usually robbed on screen, as well as punching above the emotional weight you might expect for a film about a hustle gone wrong.</p>
<p>To the Stars</p>
<p>Where to watch it: Rent on digital $4.99 on Google Play, Amazon and Apple</p>
<p>Moonrise Kingdom’s Kara Hayward returns in To the Stars, a film about a small town in 1960’s Oklahoma. Hayward plays Iris, an introverted teenager who is bullied at school and finds little peace at home. When a new family moves into town, Iris makes friends with their daughter Maggie (Liana Liberato), but the events that brought the family out to Oklahoma start to cause ripples through the tight-knit community. Shea Whigham plays Iris’ father, and Tony Hale and Malin Akerman play Maggie’s parents. In our review from the 2019 Sundance Film Festival, we said director Martha Stephens’ “dustbowl compositions steer To the Stars clear of cliché or period-piece artifice. You’ll never be as mad at modern politicians who want to take us back to the ‘good ol’ days’ as you will watching this adept coming-of-age tale.”</p>
<p>The True History of the Kelly Gang</p>
<p>Where to watch it: Rent on digital $5.99 on Google Play, Amazon, and $6.99 on Apple</p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed director Justin Kurzel takes on history in a less outlandish vein with The True History of the Kelly Gang. The Kelly Gang were a group of outlaws who gained notoriety in 1870s Australia, and the movie follows their flight from the authorities. 1917’s George MacKay stars as Kelly himself, with Russell Crowe as a figure from Kelly’s past.</p>
<p>The Quarry</p>
<p>Where to watch it: Rent on digital $6.99 on Google Play, Amazon and Apple</p>
<p>The Quarry makes for a Shea Whigham double-whammy this weekend. The film stars Whigham as a mysterious drifter who tries to start a new life as the cleric to a small-town congregation. The local police chief (Michael Shannon), however, has his suspicions, and a gruesome crime threatens to unravel things even further.</p>
<p>New on Netflix this weekend</p>
<p>Circus of Books, a documentary about a mom-and-pop bookstore that ended up becoming the biggest distributor of gay porn in the United States</p>
<p>Extraction, an action thriller starring Chris Hemsworth as the mercenary Tyler Rake</p>
<p>The Midnight Gospel, the new series from the creator of Adventure Time</p>
<p>Thomas Middleditch and Ben Schwartz’s imrpov comedy specials Middleditch &amp; Schwartz</p>
<p>Netflix’s latest animated outing, The Willoughbys</p>
<p>And here’s what dropped last Friday:</p>
<p>Fantasy Island</p>
<p>Where to watch it: Buy on digital $14.99 on Google Play, Amazon and Apple</p>
<p>The Blumhouse reboot of the TV show Fantasy Island takes on the show’s premise: a group of people arrive on a tropical island, with each person receiving the promise that they will have a single fantasy fulfilled. Of course, the fantasies don’t quite play out as planned. While the movie isn’t all that scary, that’s not necessarily a bad thing, as we get into in our review:</p>
<p>That’s ultimately the true novelty of Blumhouse’s PG-13 gimmick movies: Even when they don’t work very well, they tend to push horror in an accessible, oddly friendly direction. Horror fans are supposed to roll their eyes at this kind of softness in the genre, and demand something harder, bloodier, or crazier &hellip; Still, is there anything really wrong with hanging semi-competent entertainment on a great hook, then selling it to bored teenagers?</p>
<p>The Rhythm Section</p>
<p>Where to watch it: Buy on digital $14.99 on Google Play, Amazon and Apple</p>
<p>If you’ve ever wanted to see a former Gossip Girl cast member try her hand at a fight-heavy revenge thriller, then The Rhythm Section is the movie for you. Don’t be fooled by the film’s title — it has almost nothing to do with the film besides serving as the mantra Stefanie (Blake Lively) uses in order to keep herself calm. (“Think of your heart as the drums, your breathing as the bass.”) Bear in mind, though, as we mention in our review, the action is really the main reason to check this movie out.</p>
<p>The self-seriousness with which Morano tackles The Rhythm Section serves the action sequences well; Stefanie’s fights are genuinely harrowing and anxiety-inducing to watch as rattling close-ups create a sense of claustrophobia. However, that tone clashes with the silliness of Stefanie’s supposed mantra, which almost seems parodic of such lines in other action movies, and makes the black holes where characters should be all the more evident.</p>
<p>Underwater</p>
<p>Where to watch it: Rent on digital $5.99 on Google Play, Amazon and Apple</p>
<p>Kristen Stewart stars in this horror movie from William Eubank (The Signal), which crosses Alien with Armageddon and the survival game Soma as it follows a group of researchers in a deep sea drilling station as they try to escape disaster. The rest of the cast is filled out with other familiar faces — Vincent Cassel, Mamoudou Athie, John Gallagher Jr. — and, as we dove into in our review, the movie’s appeal is in cheering them on against terrifying odds.</p>
<p>[The] real attraction of Underwater is in rooting for these characters to survive while watching them get torn apart. Their deaths carry little weight, trading pathos for the fun of watching helmets implode and suits fill with blood. At points, the film’s flimsiness is laughable: A diagram estimating the range of an explosion shows that it’ll go just far enough to destroy monsters, but not the people escaping them. But Eubank always moves on quickly, bringing on the next set of undersea scares.</p>
<p>Jackie Robinson</p>
<p>Where to watch it: Stream it on PBS, and Amazon</p>
<p>Documentary fans rejoice! Ken Burns’ film on the life of Jackie Robinson, the legendary baseball player, is available to watch for free. Made up of two parts, the documentary miniseries features Keith David as its narrator, with Jamie Foxx providing the voice of Robinson. Many other notable names provide other commentary, including Harry Belafonte and Barack and Michelle Obama.</p>
<p>Wendy</p>
<p>Where to watch it: Rent on digital $5.99 on Google Play, Amazon and Apple</p>
<p>For a new spin on an old story, check out Benh Zeitlin’s Wendy, which tackles J.M. Barrie’s Peter Pan with a little more magical realism and makes Wendy its main character. As we note in our review, it’s Captain Hook who ends up really standing out, but there’s still plenty more to the movie. Once you’ve seen it, check out our interview with the director, which gets into the wild and practical way this island adventure was shot with a cast of non-professional kid actors.
