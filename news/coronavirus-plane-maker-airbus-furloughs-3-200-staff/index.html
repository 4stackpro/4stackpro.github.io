<p>Aerospace giant Airbus is to furlough 3,200 staff at its north Wales site, the company has announced.</p>
<p>It comes hours after Chief Executive Guillaume Faury warned the company was &ldquo;bleeding cash at an unprecedented speed&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Airbus said about half of the staff at its Broughton site would be placed on the UK government&rsquo;s job retention scheme, which pays 80% of wages.</p>
<p>The company is expected to top up salaries by a further 5-10%.</p>
<p>The furlough periods of production and support staff will be staggered over the next three weeks.</p>
<p>The remaining staff will stay on site, including 500 who are currently working at the AMRC Cymru facility, building parts for ventilators as part of the Ventilator Challenge UK consortium.</p>
<p>This month the firm announced it was cutting aircraft production by a third.</p>
<p>It comes as the aviation industry is expected to shrink significantly in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>Mr Faury also told Airbus&rsquo; 135,000 staff to brace for potentially deep job cuts and warned that its survival was at stake without immediate action.</p>
<p>The Welsh Government said it was working with the company and to support its highly-skilled workers, while the UK government said its furlough scheme would help firms &ldquo;to bounce back and get the economy up and running once the coronavirus emergency is over&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Image copyright Reuters</p>
<p>Airbus is this week due to deliver financial results for the first quarter of the year. Those figures will be overshadowed by the pandemic that has left global airlines struggling to survive and almost completely halted plane deliveries since lockdowns started in March.</p>
<p>Greg Waldron, from the aviation industry news website Flight Global, highlighted the huge impact of coronavirus on Airbus and the sector as a whole, saying: &ldquo;Every assumption we had about the industry has been totally upended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The outlook for Airbus has gone from very positive to very negative. There&rsquo;s simply no demand for new aircraft at the moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Great pain&rsquo;</p>
<p>In response to the pandemic Airbus had already begun implementing government-assisted furlough schemes starting with 3,000 workers in France and said it would lower output of its narrow-body jets to 40 a month.</p>
<p>Airbus has around 13,500 workers in the UK, with most of them making wings at its two major sites in Broughton, in Flintshire, and Filton, Bristol.</p>
<p>Despite the major blow the coronavirus has dealt to Airbus, Mr Waldron thinks it will survive this crisis but not without significant layoffs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Airbus is a crucially important industrial programme for Europe, I think Europe will be committed to keeping Airbus going,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, there&rsquo;s going to be a great deal of pain to go through. If they cut production rates quite significantly you&rsquo;re going to see large numbers of layoffs. I would expect in a few years you&rsquo;ll see a smaller leaner Airbus than what we have now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Airbus&rsquo; main rival Boeing is battling another major crisis due to the year-long grounding of its 737 Max passenger jet, which had been its best-selling plane.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the US aviation giant scrapped a $4.2bn (£3.4bn) tie-up with Brazil&rsquo;s Embraer. Some industry analysts saw the move as being triggered by the crises, although the company cited contractual reasons for the decision.

<p>The end is looming for the Airbus A380, following Airbus&rsquo; 2019 announcement that it will end production of the double-decker in 2021.</p>
<p>Things were much different back in April 2005, when the giant made its maiden flight, and in 2007 when the Airbus A380 entered service to great fanfare. The gargantuan jet, dubbed the superjumbo, was designed to take everything that made the Boeing 747 an icon and push it to the limits of modern engineering.</p>
<p>The superjumbo hasn&rsquo;t been the game changer Airbus had hoped it would become when the massive jet was conceived two decades ago. This is especially the case on the financial front.</p>
<p>For much of the plane&rsquo;s life, Airbus has struggled to find airlines willing to put the A380 into service.</p>
<p>With a price tag of $445.6 million, the A380 is one of the most expensive and lavish airplanes ever built. With room for as many as 800 passengers, the double-decker&rsquo;s sheer size means it&rsquo;s an occasion whenever a superjumbo arrives.</p>
<p>But in a cost-conscious market and with fluctuating fuel prices, the very attributes that made the plane stand out may have also doomed it. Some say the A380 came two decades too late, while others say that with increasing airport congestion, the plane is ahead of its time.</p>
<p>Some industry observers, such as the Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia, have gone so far as to call it the biggest mistake in the history of Airbus. According to Aboulafia, the A380 is a poorly executed aircraft designed for a market that doesn&rsquo;t really exist. As a result, the $25 billion that Airbus spent on the A380 program could have been better used elsewhere, like on a rival for Boeing&rsquo;s next-generation 777X or on a true replacement for the aging Boeing 757, Aboulafia previously told Business Insider.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s painful, but in the long run, it&rsquo;s best,&rdquo; Aboulafia said regarding the end of the A380 production run.</p>
<p>Thus, production ends with just 251 planes. Airbus has already delivered 242 A380s. Only a few planes remain to be built and delivered to airline customers.</p>
<p>The plane is a polarizing machine, with some viewing it as an eye-sore, and others as a testament to the marvels of modern engineering.</p>

<h3 id="coronavirus-grounds-airbus-and-boeings-lofty-plans">Coronavirus grounds Airbus and Boeing’s lofty plans</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/04/E_Fan_X_Wind_Tunnel_01-800x450.jpeg" alt="img">
Developments in the aerospace industry are falling by the wayside because of the coronavirus outbreak’s huge impact on the sector: US planemaker Boeing has abandoned international joint venture plans while European rival Airbus has nixed a project aimed at producing electric-powered aircraft.</p>
<p>Boeing said on Saturday (25 April) it had cancelled plans to create a multi-billion dollar tie-up with Embraer, insisting that the Brazilian firm “did not satisfy the necessary conditions” by the 24 April deadline date.</p>
<p>The $4.2bn joint venture was meant to help Boeing tap into more of the small jet market and increase production capacity. Embraer had hoped to take the fight to its own market rival, Canada’s Bombardier, which recently joined forces with Airbus.</p>
<p>Boeing’s senior vice-president, Marc Allen, said in a statement that “it is deeply disappointing. But we have reached a point where continued negotiation within the framework of the MTA [agreement] is not going to resolve the outstanding issues.”</p>
<p>Embraer immediately hit back with its own statement, insisting that Boeing had “wrongfully terminated” the deal and “manufactured false claims” in order to get out of paying the purchase price.</p>
<p>The Brazilian jet-maker also cited Boeing’s “financial condition” and hundreds of billions of dollars in lost revenues as a result of the MAX plane scandal, which involved two fatal crashes and a worldwide grounding of the stricken aircraft.</p>
<p>The Brazilian company said that it will “pursue all remedies” to recoup damages.</p>
<p>Boeing crash could be ‘scandal to rival Dieselgate’, say MEPs The European Parliament’s transport committee quizzed the head of the EU Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) on Monday (18 March) about the ongoing investigation into a crash that prompted agencies around the world to ground Boeing MAX aircraft.</p>
<p>Coronavirus has slashed air travel demand and pushed several airlines to the brink of bankruptcy. That situation has reflected on the order books of every planemaker and put future deliveries in serious doubt.</p>
<p>Neither aerospace company explicitly mentioned the virus outbreak’s impact in their respective statements but industry analysts are in no doubt that the pandemic was the straw that broke the already-struggling firm’s back in this case.</p>
<p>According to Boeing, every regulatory authority apart from the European Commission had given its blessing to the Embraer merger, suggesting that the ongoing probe into its plans had played a part in its decision to cut the cord.</p>
<p>But EURACTIV understands that the competition services were still looking into the tie-up and that neither Boeing nor Embraer had officially notified the Commission of its cancellation.</p>
<p>Aerospace giants face massive virus disruption to order books The economic crisis caused by the coronavirus is also threatening the aviation industry. While Boeing’s production of commercial aircraft is virtually at a standstill, Airbus intends to downsize production. EURACTIV’s partner La Tribune reports.</p>
<p>The Wrong Brothers</p>
<p>Boeing’s European rival, Airbus, has also made a drastic change in course in order to adapt to the new virus-induced situation. On Friday (24 April), the firm said it would shelve a project aimed at powering aircraft engines by electricity.</p>
<p>The E-Fan X demonstrator plane was due to make its maiden flight next year and show that hybrid power is a realistic option for commercial jets, making a dent in aviation’s growing carbon footprint.</p>
<p>But Airbus and engine-maker Rolls-Royce said their joint decision to nix the programme was necessary in order for the plane-builder to “navigate the realities” created by coronavirus.</p>
<p>The aerospace giant has already cancelled plans to open a new assembly line for smaller aircraft at its Toulouse headquarters, while its ambitions of setting up a lucrative second-hand market for the A380 super-jumbo have also been dealt a blow.</p>
<p>Rolls-Royce, meanwhile, has been busy lending its manufacturing know-how to the UK’s efforts to increase the number of ventilators, after the British government called on its top firms to help boost healthcare capacity.</p>
<p>F1 engineers help develop virus aid in record time Formula One engineers from the championship-winning Mercedes team have helped develop a breathing aid that can keep coronavirus-infected patients out of intensive care. The device was given the green light by the UK health service in record time.</p>
<p>Chief technology officer Grazia Vittadini insisted that Airbus had learned a lot from the E-Fan X experience, including breakthroughs in battery development and overcoming regulatory barriers.</p>
<p>Rolls-Royce’s Paul Stein said industry interest in the endeavour is still encouraging but acknowledged that pushing forward with a maiden flight “is not critical at this time”.</p>
<p>“Although our programme with Airbus concludes, we are planning that our power-generation system ground testing will complete, allowing us to demonstrate the technology and capture all the lessons,” he concluded.</p>
<p>The move suggests that the aviation industry will use the virus-crisis as a reason to pursue even more-efficient plane designs and accelerate the development of cleaner fuels, rather than completely revolutionise how jets take to the skies.</p>
<p>Four of Europe’s unexpected electric movers and shakers Electric-battery power is often branded as unsuitable for certain types of transport and vehicles, due to concerns like weight and power ratios. But several new developments ranging from shipping to motorsport are cause for a rethink.</p>
