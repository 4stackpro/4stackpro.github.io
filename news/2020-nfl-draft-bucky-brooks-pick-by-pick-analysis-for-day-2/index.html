The 2020 NFL Draft is underway! You can follow all of the picks with our NFL Draft Tracker and tune in to NFL Network, ABC, ESPN and ESPN Deportes for live coverage. The draft will also be streamed live via the NFL app and ESPN app. Below is Bucky Brooks&rsquo; analysis for every pick by every NFL team. For reference, you can see every pick from Brooks&rsquo; final NFL mock draft at Mock Draft Central.</p>
<p>SECOND ROUND</p>
<ol start="33">
<li>Tee Higgins, WR, Cincinnati Bengals</li>
</ol>
<p>The Bengals add another weapon to their offense with Higgins. The high school basketball standout is an outstanding 50-50 ball catcher, and he has a knack for scoring TDs. He scored 27 receiving touchdowns in three seasons, which tied the school record for receiving scores with DeAndre Hopkins and Sammy Watkins. With A.J. Green nearing the end of his run, the Bengals have an apprentice in place to eventually replace him on the outside.</p>
<ol start="34">
<li>Michael Pittman Jr., WR, Indianapolis Colts</li>
</ol>
<p>It is easy to fall in love with the big, physical pass catcher from USC. Pittman is a chain mover with the size, strength and ball skills to do the dirty work between the hashes. As a special teams standout, he adds some toughness and physicality to the Colts&rsquo; WR corps.</p>
<ol start="35">
<li>D&rsquo;Andre Swift, RB, Detroit Lions</li>
</ol>
<p>Matthew Stafford has played most of his career without an elite RB1. Swift could change that narrative as a hybrid RB with Christian McCaffrey/Alvin Kamara-like skills. He is an outstanding runner between the tackles and on the perimeter but also flashes elite pass catching skills.</p>
<ol start="36">
<li>Xavier McKinney, S, New York Giants</li>
</ol>
<p>The Giants needed a tough guy in the secondary with the communication skills and range to excel in the box or in the post. McKinney is a steady playmaker with a high IQ and outstanding leadership skills.</p>
<ol start="37">
<li>Kyle Dugger, DB, New England Patriots</li>
</ol>
<p>A small-school standout with exceptional physical tools, Dugger displays cornerback-like skills as a safety but also shows enough toughness and physicality to play within the box. As an outstanding punt returner, he could make significant contributions as a two-phase playmaker for the Patriots.</p>
<ol start="38">
<li>Yetur Gross-Matos, Edge, Carolina Panthers</li>
</ol>
<p>He&rsquo;s a long, rangy pass rusher with a game that reminds some of Jason Pierre-Paul. He has outstanding hands and combat skills, and displays a nonstop motor as a pass rusher. Gross-Matos has a chance to be a strong contributor as a base end.</p>
<ol start="39">
<li>Robert Hunt, OT, Miami Dolphins</li>
</ol>
<p>Hunt is a versatile blocker capable of playing multiple spots along the offensive line. He is projected to play guard but he could get an opportunity to play outside. As a mauler/brawler with a nasty temperament, he could add some toughness and physicality to the frontline.</p>
<ol start="40">
<li>Ross Blacklock, DT, Houston Texans</li>
</ol>
<p>The TCU standout is a high-motor interior defender with outstanding first-step quickness and burst. He is a natural one-gap penetrator capable of shooting gaps and hunting as an interior pass rusher.</p>
<p>He is a big, fast and physical back with a game that&rsquo;s built for a workhorse role. He&rsquo;s posted two 2,000-yard seasons while displaying a rugged style and nimble feet. Taylor is surprisingly explosive for a 220-plus running back.</p>
<ol start="42">
<li>Laviska Shenault Jr., WR, Jacksonville Jaguars</li>
</ol>
<p>The Jaguars get a big-time playmaker with outstanding running skills. Shenault is a wingback with the potential to score from anywhere on the field. He needs to clean up his route running, but the Jaguars could feed him the ball on an assortment of bubble screens, quick passes and reverses to take advantage of his explosiveness and playmaking ability.</p>
<ol start="43">
<li>Cole Kmet, TE, Chicago Bears</li>
</ol>
<p>The Bears desperately needed a big-bodied TE with soft hands and outstanding ball skills. He is a physical force at the position and an improving blocker on the edge. Kmet also shows a knack for putting the ball in the paint as a red-zone weapon.</p>
<p>The LSU star is a rangy defender with outstanding speed and athleticism. He is a natural ballhawk but must become a more consistent tackler to be effective in run support. Delpit flashes elite potential but the lack of inconsistent physicality was problematic in 2019.</p>
<ol start="45">
<li>Antoine Winfield Jr., S, Tampa Bay Buccaneers</li>
</ol>
<p>He&rsquo;s a tough, hard-nosed safety with outstanding instincts and awareness. Winfield has a nose for the ball and his toughness stands out on tape. Questions about his size impacted his grade, but he is a solid player with big-time potential.</p>
<ol start="46">
<li>KJ Hamler, WR, Denver Broncos</li>
</ol>
<p>The Broncos add more speed and explosiveness to the WR corps. Hamler is a pocket rocket with big-play potential as a vertical stretch receiver on the outside. He is an outstanding returner and those running skills make him a threat to produce chunk plays on quick slants, bubble screens and reverses on the perimeter.</p>
<ol start="47">
<li>Marlon Davidson, DT, Atlanta Falcons</li>
</ol>
<p>Davidson gives the Falcons a tough guy on the defensive front with the versatility to play DT or DE. He shows outstanding strength and power at the point of attack, and could emerge as an effective inside rusher in sub-packages.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a productive sack artist with good first-step quickness and athleticism. Taylor flashes some natural pass rush skills and his production (19.5 career sacks) matches his performance on tape. The Seahawks could make him a &ldquo;LEO&rdquo; and let him play on the edges.</p>
<ol start="49">
<li>Chase Claypool, WR, Pittsburgh Steelers</li>
</ol>
<p>The Steelers have a knack for finding receivers. Claypool is a freak at the position with a rare combination of size, strength and speed. He isn&rsquo;t a polished route runner, but he&rsquo;s tough and productive as an outside pass catcher. The Notre Dame standout also brings some special teams ability.</p>
<ol start="50">
<li>Jaylon Johnson, CB, Chicago Bears</li>
</ol>
<p>A tough, hard-nosed cover corner with outstanding instincts and awareness, Johnson is a polished technician with quick feet and active hands. He&rsquo;s scrappy and competitive, which makes him a hard matchup for receivers who don&rsquo;t like to battle on the perimeter.</p>
<ol start="51">
<li>Trevon Diggs, CB, Dallas Cowboys</li>
</ol>
<p>Diggs is long, rangy cover corner with natural ball skills. As a former WR, he is at his best when he&rsquo;s allowed to play with vision on the QB in zone coverage. He isn&rsquo;t a blazer, but his instincts and awareness give him a chance to emerge as a standout CB1 in a &ldquo;see ball, get ball&rdquo; defense.</p>
<ol start="52">
<li>Cam Akers, RB, Los Angeles Rams</li>
</ol>
<p>An underrated back with outstanding vision, balance and body control, Akers is a third-down RB with big-play potential, particularly in the passing game. He could excel as the lead RB in Sean McVay&rsquo;s scheme.</p>
<ol start="53">
<li>Jalen Hurts, QB, Philadelphia Eagles</li>
</ol>
<p>The Eagles take a chance on Hurts as their QB2. The former Alabama/Oklahoma standout is a high-character player with natural leadership skills. Hurts has improved significantly as a passer and is a rugged dual-threat playmaker with intriguing developmental potential.</p>
<ol start="54">
<li>A.J. Epenesa, DE, Buffalo Bills</li>
</ol>
<p>The Bills get a blue-collar pass rusher with a power-based game. He outworks opponents on the edge and flashes impressive hand skills in combative situations. Epenesa is ideally suited to play as a base end but has the potential to be an effective inside rusher in pass rush situations.</p>
<ol start="55">
<li>J.K. Dobbins, RB, Baltimore Ravens</li>
</ol>
<p>Dobbins is an underappreciated workhorse runner with outstanding vision, balance and body control. He is a big-time RB with the burst to take it the distance on inside or outside runs. The Ravens get a dynamic RB1 with a game that suits their style.</p>
<ol start="56">
<li>Raekwon Davis, DT, Miami Dolphins</li>
</ol>
<p>The Dolphins get a monstrous interior defender with outstanding run-stopping ability. He moves well for his size and flashes disruptive skills at the point of attack. He posted sack production in 2017 (8.5 sacks) but hasn&rsquo;t been an effective pass rusher over the past two seasons.</p>
<ol start="57">
<li>Van Jefferson, WR, Los Angeles Rams</li>
</ol>
<p>Sean McVay loves polished route runners with rock-solid games. Jefferson is a pro-ready pass catcher with outstanding hands and ball skills. He should slide into the starting lineup as a WR3 in the Rams&rsquo; three-receiver sets.</p>
<ol start="58">
<li>Ezra Cleveland, OT, Minnesota Vikings</li>
</ol>
<p>He&rsquo;s an athletic edge blocker with outstanding physical tools. Cleveland plays with balance and displays nimble feet on the edges. He has been a little inconsistent, but he plays at a high level when he is on top of his game.</p>
<ol start="59">
<li>Denzel Mims, WR, New York Jets (via Seahawks)</li>
</ol>
<p>Sam Darnold gets a long, rangy receiver with excellent ball skills and strong hands. Mims has a knack for playmaking and his steady improvement down the stretch impressed several scouts in the scouting community. He is an ideal WR2 in most schemes, but he could eventually occupy the No. 1 role in New York.</p>
<ol start="60">
<li>Josh Uche, LB, New England Patriots (via Ravens)</li>
</ol>
<p>Speed rusher with plenty of juice off the edge, Uche is a dynamic player with enough versatility to play as a traditional outside linebacker or as a situational pass rusher. He has significant sack production (16.5 sacks) but has only logged nine career starts.</p>
<ol start="61">
<li>Kristian Fulton, CB, Tennessee Titans</li>
</ol>
<p>The Titans get a CB viewed by many as a first-round talent. Fulton is a natural cover corner with good movement skills and instincts. If he can unleash his inner &lsquo;dawg,&rsquo; he could emerge as a star at the position.</p>
<ol start="62">
<li>AJ Dillon, RB, Green Bay Packers</li>
</ol>
<p>The Packers grab a big, bruising RB with a downhill running style that meshes well with the team&rsquo;s zone scheme. Dillon is an old-school workhorse with a rugged game that adds a different dimension to the Packers&rsquo; offense.</p>
<ol start="63">
<li>Willie Gay Jr., LB, Kansas City Chiefs</li>
</ol>
<p>The Chiefs gets an explosive second-level defender with exceptional speed and athleticism. Gay is a sideline-to-sideline defender with the burst to track down runners all over the field.</p>
<p>The Panthers add an enforcer to the middle of their defense with the selection of Chinn. The Southern Illinois standout has LB size but with rare safety and CB cover skills. He gives Matt Rhule a hybrid player with a game that&rsquo;s similar to the hybrid playmaker (Isaiah Simmons) the team bypassed in Round 1.</p>
<p>THIRD ROUND</p>
<ol start="65">
<li>Logan Wilson, LB, Cleveland Browns</li>
</ol>
<p>The Bengals get a tackling machine with outstanding instincts and ball skills. Wilson finished with 400-plus tackles and 10 career interceptions, while displaying impressive skills as a run-and-chase player.</p>
<ol start="66">
<li>Antonio Gibson, WR/RB, Washington Redskins</li>
</ol>
<p>Gibson is a hybrid running back with enough versatility, athleticism and technical skills to play all over the field as an offensive weapon.</p>
<ol start="67">
<li>Julian Okwara, LB, Detroit Lions</li>
</ol>
<p>Okwara is a long, rangy athlete with explosiveness and positional versatility. He will have a chance to make his mark as a special teams contributor/rotational player.</p>
<ol start="68">
<li>Ashtyn Davis, S, New York Jets</li>
</ol>
<p>He&rsquo;s a high-IQ safety with world-class speed and athleticism. Davis is a rangy playmaker with outstanding instincts and ball skills.</p>
<p>Lewis is a scrappy interior blocker with a rugged game. He can win the mash-and-maul game at the point of attack, and flashes enough athleticism to hold up against quick interior pass rushers.</p>
<ol start="70">
<li>Brandon Jones, DB, Miami Dolphins</li>
</ol>
<p>Jones is an instinctive free safety with a high IQ and excellent communication skills. He can play in the slot and possesses the positional versatility that Brian Flores covets in his defensive backs.</p>
<p>The Ravens add a high-motor interior defender with a game built on a mix of quickness, strength and power. He wears down blockers with his relentless style, and his strong hands stand out on tape.</p>
<ol start="72">
<li>Josh Jones, OT, Arizona Cardinals</li>
</ol>
<p>Jones was viewed as a fringe first-round talent but falls to the Cardinals in the third round. He&rsquo;s a potential Day 1 starter with enough athleticism, balance and body control to neutralize most edge rushers.</p>
<ol start="73">
<li>DaVon Hamilton, NT, Jacksonville Jaguars</li>
</ol>
<p>Hamilton is a worker bee with a game built on hustle and effort. He plays hard from snap to whistle, and he flashes just enough quickness to be effective as an interior defender with active hands.</p>
<ol start="74">
<li>Zack Baun, LB, New Orleans Saints (via Browns)</li>
</ol>
<p>The Wisconsin standout is a versatile defender with a unique combination of pass rush skills and coverage ability. He can wreak havoc off the edges as a pressure player but also flashes enough athleticism to play in space as a zone defender.</p>
<p>Jackson was a solid starter for the Buckeyes. He has some position versatility as a center or guard, which will make him a valuable backup/swing player for the Lions.</p>
<ol start="76">
<li>Ke&rsquo;Shawn Vaughn, RB, Tampa Bay Buccaneers</li>
</ol>
<p>Vaughn is a downhill runner with sneaky speed, quickness and burst. He catches the ball well out of the backfield and could be a contributor as a rotational player for the Buccaneers.</p>
<ol start="77">
<li>Michael Ojemudia, CB, Denver Broncos</li>
</ol>
<p>Ojemudia is a long, rangy zone cover corner with solid instincts and ball skills. He flashes some toughness attacking runners and receivers on the perimeter.</p>
<ol start="78">
<li>Matt Hennessey, C, Atlanta Falcons</li>
</ol>
<p>He&rsquo;s a scrappy pivot with a high IQ and successfully made the transition from tackle to center &ndash; looking comfortable at the position. He is not a powerful blocker in the run game, but he is steady and consistent walling off defenders at the point of attack.</p>
<ol start="79">
<li>Jabari Zuniga, Edge, New York Jets</li>
</ol>
<p>Zuniga is a quick-twitch athlete with pass rush skills. He battled through a high ankle sprain in 2019, but he has posted solid sack production (18.5) throughout his career as an edge defender.</p>
<ol start="80">
<li>Lynn Bowden, RB, Las Vegas Raiders</li>
</ol>
<p>Jon Gruden could tap into his creative side to maximize Bowden&rsquo;s talents as a utility player. He is an exceptional runner with the ball in his hands, but he&rsquo;s at his best playing as a slot receiver. With Bowden having experience as a wildcat QB, the Raiders could use the Kentucky standout as a gadget player early in his career.</p>
<ol start="81">
<li>Bryan Edwards, WR, Las Vegas Raiders</li>
</ol>
<p>Edwards is a big, physical pass catcher with impressive hands and ball skills. He is comfortable doing the dirty work over the middle of the field as a designated chain mover in the passing game.</p>
<ol start="82">
<li>Neville Gallimore, DT, Dallas Cowboys</li>
</ol>
<p>An athletic interior defender with impressive short area quickness and active hands, Gallimore is a plugger in the run game with limited pass rush skills.</p>
<ol start="83">
<li>Lloyd Cushenberry, C, Denver Broncos</li>
</ol>
<p>Cushenberry is a high-IQ pivot with a scrappy game built on hustle and effort. He is an excellent communicator but needs to be a little more consistent with his leverage to move defenders off the ball as a blocker.</p>
<ol start="84">
<li>Terrell Lewis, Edge, Los Angeles Rams</li>
</ol>
<p>He&rsquo;s an intriguing pass rusher prospect with impressive length and strong hands. Lewis has flashed disruptive traits, but his extensive injury history has led to durability concerns.</p>
<p>Blackmon is a productive safety with instincts, awareness and ball skills. He is a steady player with the potential to crack the rotation as a spot starter.</p>
<ol start="86">
<li>Zack Moss, RB, Buffalo Bills</li>
</ol>
<p>He&rsquo;s a hard-nosed running back with a blue-collar game that fits the Bills&rsquo; scheme. Moss is a workhorse back with soft hands and underrated receiving skills. He has a chance to be a three-down running back as a pro.</p>
<ol start="87">
<li>Anfernee Jennings, LB, New England Patriots</li>
</ol>
<p>A heavy-handed LB with pass rushing skills, Jennings wins with power off the edge and plays with a high-revving motor. He is the kind of hard-nosed player that typically fares well in the Patriots&rsquo; scheme.</p>
<p>Elliott is a talented interior defender with active hands and outstanding short-area quickness. He has all of the tools to be a blue-chip player, but his production hasn&rsquo;t matched his potential to this point.</p>

<p>The former wide receiver has some of the best ball skills in this CB class. He will be a welcome addition to a team needing coverage help.

<p><img src="https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2020/03/03/34fbfaba-4eeb-4fdf-af63-f4d9114e9b00/thumbnail/1200x675/e230c655a1fcb349acd41f762859c77e/tua-tagovailoa-alabama.jpg" alt="img">
The NFL is a passing league. It&rsquo;s a cliche, sure, but it&rsquo;s become a cliche for a reason: it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Every year, teams throw the ball more and more often. They spend entire offseasons building out their offensive infrastructure so that when the season rolls around, they can put their quarterback in position to succeed. They hire new coaching staffs and sign free agents and make trades and draft players, all so that they can throw the ball as efficiently and explosively as possible.</p>
<p>A whole lot of teams acted accordingly on Thursday night, with four drafting quarterbacks, seven drafting offensive linemen, six drafting wide receivers, and the reigning Super Bowl champions selecting a pass-catching running back. Given that extensive focus throughout the first round, we&rsquo;re going to use the space below to walk through the different approaches that teams took, by separating them into three buckets: teams that identified their next franchise passer; teams that drafted a player whose primary job will be to protect their franchise passer; and teams who acquired a new weapon for their franchise passer.</p>
<p>The first round of the draft is in the books, so who were the winners and losers? Will Brinson and the Pick Six Podcast Superfriends are here to break it all down; listen below and be sure to subscribe for daily NFL goodness.</p>
<p>Identifiers</p>
<p>Bengals: Joe Burrow (1); Dolphins: Tua Tagovailoa (5); Chargers: Justin Herbert (6); Packers: Jordan Love (26)</p>
<p>Burrow, coming off of perhaps the greatest collegiate season of all time, seems like the only one of these four who is a lock to start from Day 1. Tagovailoa has the injury questions and the Dolphins have Ryan Fitzpatrick as a competent bridge to the Tua era. Herbert was widely considered a player who, despite his tremendous talent, would need some time to make the transition to the next level; and the Chargers have Tyrod Taylor to start in the meantime. And Love is going to sit behind Aaron Rodgers for at least a year. (Given Rodgers&rsquo; contract situation, Love is likely to sit for at least two years.)</p>
<p>Burrow is lucky enough to have A.J. Green (assuming he signs his franchise tender) and Tyler Boyd to throw to, but the Bengals undoubtedly need to get him some more help along the offensive line on Days 2 and 3. (2019 first-round pick Jonah Williams coming back from injury is a nice step in the right direction, but still more help is needed.) It would be a good idea to nab another receiver for him as well, even if only to step into the lineup full time whenever Green decides to hang up his spikes. Cincy landed the No. 1 pick for a reason; this is still a roster that needs a whole lot of help.</p>
<p>The Dolphins spent most of their free-agent dollars on upgrading their defense, bringing in Byron Jones, Kyle Van Noy, Elandon Roberts, Shaq Lawson, and Emmanuel Ogbah. That was a pretty big clue that it was going to be an offense-heavy draft for Miami, and that&rsquo;s exactly how it went early on. Tagovailoa is the kind of passer who would have gone No. 1 overall in a draft that did not have Burrow, and if he didn&rsquo;t get injured he might have gone No. 1 anyway. Miami, like Cincinnati, definitely needs to add some more help along the line, but they at least got that started with their next first-round selection. With Davante Parker, Preston Williams, and Albert Wilson on the outside, he has a decent, if not necessarily explosive crop of pass-catchers, and it would not be surprising if they used one or more of their 12 remaining picks on another wideout.</p>
<p>Herbert has the best immediate supporting cast of any of the first-round QBs. He has Keenan Allen and Mike Williams on the outside, Hunter Henry over the middle, and Austin Ekeler making plays out of the backfield. Even with the team very obviously still needing to add a left tackle, he&rsquo;s in a pretty good spot right away. And because the Chargers have Taylor, he also is not under the immediate pressure to start. I was not as high on Herbert as the top two quarterbacks, but he landed in a really good situation.</p>
<p>The Packers, obviously, betrayed Aaron Rodgers and deserve to be tarred and feathered for the rest of their lives. Wait, no. What they did was just fine. They identified their quarterback of the future and did not give up all that much to move up and get him. They have the kind of QB in place that will allow Love the time he needs to develop. And, breaking some news here, the draft is not over. There are still 10 or so receivers who look like they can step in and be productive enough to help Rodgers right away. If they come out of Day 2 with two of Denzel Mims, K.J. Hamler, Tee Higgins, Laviska Shenault, Michael Pittman, Chase Claypool, Tyler Johnson, or Antonio Gandy-Golden, is anyone going to be saying they didn&rsquo;t go get Rodgers help? Planning for life after a 36-year-old QB makes sense, and the Packers had the luxury of doing it in a draft where there is incredible wideout depth still available to them. Rodgers presumably won&rsquo;t love this plan, but the process is sound.</p>
<p>Protectors</p>
<p>Giants: Andrew Thomas (4); Browns: Jedrick Wills (10); Jets: Mekhi Becton (11); Buccaneers: Tristan Wirfs (13); Dolphins (again): Austin Jackson (18); Saints: Cesar Ruiz (24); Titans: Isaiah Wilson (29)</p>
<p>Pretty much everybody knew the Giants were going to take the first tackle off the board. The only question was which of the near-consensus top four it would be. They ended up going with Thomas, and it&rsquo;s hard to fault them for valuing any of this group over the others. Thomas has the ability to step in and play on the right side right away, and potentially swing back to the left whenever the Giants decide to cut ties with Nate Solder. Protecting Daniel Jones well enough for him to spread the ball around to an underrated group of pass-catchers had to be the team&rsquo;s highest priority coming into the draft, and with this pick, they showed that&rsquo;s exactly what it was.</p>
<p>The same applied to the Browns, whose offense was completely undermined in 2019 by a complete lack of adequate protection for Baker Mayfield. Signing Jack Conklin to play right tackle was a step in the right direction, but they entered the draft with an obvious hole on the left side. There was a lot of speculation about a potential Trent Williams trade, but we can probably shut that down now. The Browns turned a weakness into something more resembling a strength with their offseason plan, and it&rsquo;ll allow them to actually run the type of offense Kevin Stefanski wants to run.</p>
<p>No team has spent more capital this offseason on the offensive line than the Jets. They handed out $67.5 million worth of contracts to George Fant, Connor McGovern, and Greg Van Roten, and kept it going by nabbing Becton at No. 11 overall. He is a ridiculous physical specimen, and it&rsquo;s not at all difficult to see why some consider him the highest-upside tackle prospect in the draft. He seems likely to slide in at left tackle right away, with Fant going back to the left side. Sam Darnold still needs better targets to throw to, but nobody can say New York didn&rsquo;t prioritize keeping him upright.</p>
<p>The Bucs had just as obvious a glaring hole at tackle as did the Browns, and they had the fourth of the group of four fall basically right into the laps. They gave up about a 100-pick drop on Day 3 in order to ensure nobody jumped them for Wirfs, and that&rsquo;s a perfectly fine price for them to pay. Tampa has one of the best groups of pass-catchers in the league to help Tom Brady out, but because he is not the most mobile QB out there, you absolutely need to prioritize the offensive line as well. We saw last season how even Brady&rsquo;s performance could suffer without adequate protection, so the Bucks doing whatever they could to make sure they don&rsquo;t end up in the same situation this season made sense.</p>
<p>Miami, armed with three first-round picks, had to make sure to protect its investment in Tagovailoa. Your mileage may vary on their decision to make Jackson the fifth tackle off the board, but it&rsquo;s the decision to prioritize taking players at premium positions early in the draft shows they have the right process in mind for how to build their team. As mentioned previously, the Dolphins should probably still add another target for Tagovailoa on Day 2 or 3, but making sure he has an all-new offensive line in front of him was a nice start.</p>
<p>Seeing the Saints spring for an interior offensive lineman a year after taking another interior offensive lineman in the first round (center Erik McCoy) was a bit of a surprise, especially given the team&rsquo;s needs on defense. But Drew Brees is perhaps more dependent on solid interior protection than any QB in the league because of the combination of his lack of size and relative lack of out-of-the-pocket escapability, so making sure that group is as strong as possible is a worthy endeavor. I&rsquo;m not sure whether this means Ruiz will start right away and the team will cut ties with Larry Warford or if they plan to have Ruiz sit for a year and then step into the lineup, but this team having Ruiz, McCoy, Andrus Peat, Terron Armstead, and Ryan Ramczyk up front for the foreseeable future is pretty nice.</p>
<p>After letting Conklin leave in free agency, it was not surprising to see the Titans use their first-round pick on a monster-sized right tackle. It&rsquo;s not much more complicated than that.</p>
<p>Weaponizers</p>
<p>Raiders: Henry Ruggs (12); Broncos: Jerry Jeudy (15); Cowboys: CeeDee Lamb (17); Eagles: Jalen Reagor (21); Vikings: Justin Jefferson (22); 49ers: Brandon Aiyuk (25); Chiefs: Clyde Edwards-Helaire (32)</p>
<p>Ruggs&rsquo; pure speed has led to him being labeled a pure deep threat by many observers, but as noted during ESPN&rsquo;s draft coverage, he is actually more of a catch-and-run guy. That makes him a better fit with Derek Carr than it would appear on the surface. Plus, a player that can burn it like Ruggs can force defenses to adjust their coverage in ways that benefit everyone else. Darren Waller and Hunter Renfrow will have much more room to operate in the underneath areas of the field, which, again, is a nice thing for Carr, who prefers to throw short anyway.</p>
<p>The Broncos had as much of an obvious receiver need as anybody in the draft, and they landed a guy many considered the draft&rsquo;s top wideout at No. 15 overall. Jeudy&rsquo;s technical proficiency as a route-runner is going to make him an inner-circle member of the Always Open Club for a long time, and he makes for a fantastic perimeter partner for Courtland Sutton, who is coming off a breakout season of his own. Drew Lock looked a bit better than many expected him to last season, and with Jeudy, Sutton, and Noah Fant stretching defenses in all kinds of ways, he has plenty of weaponry available to him moving forward.</p>
<p>I still can&rsquo;t really believe that A. Lamb was available for the Cowboys at pick 17; and B. they actually took him rather than picking purely based on need. (There&rsquo;s no way this would have been the pick if this were still the Jason Garrett era.) Dallas finished last season second in the NFL in offensive DVOA, and just replaced Randall Cobb with arguably the best receiver in the draft. He is an after-catch marvel who can play both outside and in the slot, and the Cowboys can mix-and-match him and Amari Cooper inside and out while keeping Michael Gallup on the perimeter to stretch the field. Dak Prescott may not have his long-term deal just yet, but he is better positioned to succeed than at any previous point in his career. Have fun trying to defend these guys.</p>
<p>The Eagles missing out on the top three wideouts had to hurt, especially given that they saw Lamb head to a division rival. Taking Reagor over Jefferson was an interesting decision, but it makes a bit more sense if you view it through the prism of Philly prioritizing speed on the outside. We saw the difference between what their offense looked like with DeSean Jackson last season and without him, and if you were going for pure perimeter speed after the top three receivers came off the board, Reagor might make a bit more sense than Jefferson, who, while a bit more versatile, isn&rsquo;t quite as much of a burner.</p>
<p>That said, the Vikings landing Jefferson is really fascinating. He did a lot of his damage at LSU out of the slot, so it&rsquo;ll be interesting to see how the team elects to deploy him and Adam Thielen, who himself is a slot maven. Swapping out Stefon Diggs to land a cornerback and replacing him with Jefferson is actually a pretty nice bit of business. Kirk Cousins got an extension this offseason, and he should have quality wideouts to throw to for the duration of that contract thanks to this pick.</p>
<p>San Francisco moving up from No. 31 to No. 25 was a bit of a surprise given all the trade-down speculation that surrounded them leading up to the draft, but Kyle Shanahan seemed pretty damn fired up about landing Aiyuk at this spot. He&rsquo;s not necessarily the type of receiver who is going to beat press coverage, but lucky for him, he&rsquo;s going to a team that will do a better job of scheming him into open space than any other in the league. Shanahan and John Lynch specifically mentioned his ability to make plays in those types of situations, and pairing him with Deebo Samuel, George Kittle, and their dynamic group of running backs will help them maintain one of the league&rsquo;s most efficient offenses.</p>
<p>The Chiefs taking a running back at No. 32 overall is a puzzling decision. If there&rsquo;s any team that could get by with whoever the heck they want at that position, it&rsquo;s the team with Patrick Mahomes. They just won a Super Bowl with an undrafted free agent who washed out from the Dolphins. Andy Reid has shown throughout his career that he can turn essentially anybody into a productive running back anyway. If they were going to take a player at that position, however, Edwards-Helaire made the most sense for them. He&rsquo;s a dynamic pass-catcher out of the backfield who is reminiscent of Brian Westbrook, and should provide Mahomes with a solid option on screens, checkdowns, swing routes, and more. The position value is not great, but it&rsquo;s difficult to argue with the scheme fit.
