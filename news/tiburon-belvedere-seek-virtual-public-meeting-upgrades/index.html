While most Marin cities and towns already broadcast or livestream their council meetings, Belvedere and Tiburon are updating video and audio streaming capability amid the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>Local governments have been authorized to provide virtual public access to essential meetings as of March 4, when Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order in response to the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Like other governments in Marin, Belvedere closed its City Hall, canceled non-essential meetings and provides only essential functions. One essential function is public access to council meetings — which requires the city to upgrade its technology infrastructure, said Craig Middleton, city manager.</p>
<p>Before the shelter-in-place order, Belvedere’s City Council did not livestream meetings and only posted minutes and audio.</p>
<p>“People in the community were comfortable with that so we didn’t feel the need to install other technology to video stream,” Middleton said. “We may have to after this virus. It may be a reason to do that, but so far we haven’t had an issue with it and no one has asked for it.”</p>
<p>On Thursday, the council will stream its next meeting via Zoom with a live public comment section. Middleton said the city staff is working to install large monitors and wiring into the conference room so the clerk and city manager can follow along with public comment.</p>
<p>The upgrade will cost the city about $10,000.</p>
<p>Just like larger cities and towns in Marin, Belvedere is determined to abide by the shelter-in-place order and the state’s open meeting laws, said Marty Winter, a city councilman.</p>
<p>“Changes will have to be made,” Winter said. “It’s either that or we come out this thing the other end and hope we come back to a semblance of normal. Right now, I would not attend a public meeting.”</p>
<p>Winter is also on the board of the Richardson’s Bay Regional Agency. It held a meeting in early March, and he did not attend in person.</p>
<p>“As a 72-year-old cancer survivor … I’m in one of the more sensitive, vulnerable groups if I get infected, ” he said. “So I attended the meeting remotely using someone’s cellphone.”</p>
<p>In Tiburon, the town staff also faces the challenge of updating technology to provide virtual public access to council meetings.</p>
<p>Greg Chanis, the town manager, said the staff has “some capability” through Granicus software, but it does not have the capability for public comment.</p>
<p>“Ideally, there will be a way for the public to comment in real time,” he said. “This can be through email or calling in, we are trying to figure out a way.”</p>
<p>For the special council meeting at 4 p.m. Wednesday, April 1, a livestream audio link will be available at bit.ly/2xC9EDt.</p>
<p>This is the first time the council is doing a livestream on Skype with all council members joining from home, said Holli Thier, vice mayor. She said the board is committed to providing public access to meetings during these times.</p>
<p>Chanis said all business items that are not time sensitive will be pushed until the council can reconvene in person after the shelter-in-place order is lifted. It has been extended to May 3.</p>
<p>The council members will join the meeting by teleconference from their homes. Chanis and the town clerk will be in Town Hall to process public comment emails 500 words or less sent to <a href="mailto:comments@townoftiburon.org">comments@townoftiburon.org</a>.</p>
<p>“I wish I could tell you public comment will be real time,” he said. “But we will have the meeting streaming in some way.”

Paula Coven was watching the news a couple of weeks ago when she heard an appeal from a doctor: Hospitals and other health-care facilities were so short on protective supplies that they were asking the public to sew handmade washable cotton masks to help tide workers over. That plea prompted the Paradise Cay resident to start stitching. “I Googled ‘mask’ and ‘CDC’ and found a pattern,” says Coven, 61, referring to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “I’m not the greatest sewer, but I’m learning.” Coven is one of several Tiburon Peninsula residents (including Piper Berger, pictured) who are answering health facilities’ urgent call for protective equipment by powering up their sewing machines. Stuck inside during the statewide shelter-in-place order, locals are crafting homemade facemasks to help protect doctors, nurses and others — including themselves — from the coronavirus.</p>
