Discount department store K Mart is under fire for selling fake tan and bath slime as essential items but not children&rsquo;s winter woolies.</p>
<p>A Christchurch woman, who only wanted to be known as Ajay, said she was able to find bath fizz, a manicure buffer set and a face mask on the K Mart online list of essential items, but no leggings for her 21-month-old daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They need to prioritise what are essential items heading into winter. If K Mart is going to have a warehouse open to provide essential services don&rsquo;t have staff working willy nilly so someone can have a face mask,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Several people have posted similar thoughts on the K Mart Facebook page.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Fake tan offered as &lsquo;essential&rsquo; items at Kmart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand how fake tan and hair dye are essential items and kids winter clothing isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Kahli McCullough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can buy my kids bath slime, but not warm pyjamas,&rdquo; said Ains Clark.</p>
<p>A KMart spokeswoman said in a statement the company was pleased to have its New Zealand online operation back and supporting customers, saying in line with new Government requirements it had adapted the site to feature essential items where customers can access products to help families keep warm, buy key household appliances and maintain their health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>Glitter Slime is on offer at Kmart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are constantly listening to our customers and will continue to evolve our online offering with essential products they need and like other retailers, modify the product range based on the requirements set out by MBIE to ensure we can offer our customers everyday items, during a time they need it most,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman thanked people for their support and encouraged anyone with questions to contact the customer service centre between 8am and 8pm, seven days a week, on 0800 945 995.</p>
<p>The complaints follow a relaxing of the rules by the Government four days ago to allow the likes of The Warehouse, Noel Leeming, Briscoes and Mitre 10 to sell essential goods, such as heaters, whiteware and computers.</p>
<p>The decision was made in recognition of the need for people to safely isolate, stay connected to one another and work or study from home.</p>
<p>The Warehouse, which proclaimed itself an essential service at the start of the four-week lockdown as it was a provider of &ldquo;essential&rdquo; consumer goods and then had to close its doors, is back up and running under the latest rules.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>In a message on its website today, The Warehouse said it is experiencing high demand for essential items, working hard to get these back in stock and apologises if people&rsquo;s first choice is not available.</p>
<p>The notice comes as Mitre 10 launched its online home delivery service today for essential goods.</p>
<p>Key products include heaters, dehumidifiers, light bulbs and globes, hand tools, padlocks, firewood, batteries, sealants and silicones, work boots and gumboots, work wear, torches, spouting, down pipes, smoke alarms, child safety items, and small household appliances.</p>
<p>Businesses are only permitted to sell products online. Supermarkets, dairies and pharmacies remain open and have controls in place for customers to stick to the two-metre physical separation rule.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment said in order to protect public safety there will be conditions around the selling of items by businesses.</p>
<p>Businesses must operate responsibly and only make available for sale genuine essential goods - goods that are necessities of life while ensuring restriction of movement of people and workers to combat Covid-19.</p>
<p>The public must responsibly purchase only those items that are absolutely necessary to facilitate life and work during the lockdown period.</p>
<p>In order to be able to sell these essential goods, businesses must:</p>
<p>• Only take orders online or by phone and keep storefronts shut.</p>
<p>• Take orders for only essential non-food goods.</p>
<p>• Home deliver all essential goods in a contactless way and not allow people to visit stores to select or collect goods.</p>
<p>• Take all appropriate public health measures to protect their staff and customers (eg physical distancing, hygiene basics, appropriate personal protective equipment).</p>
<p>• Notify MBIE that they meet these conditions and intend to offer essential goods for sale and provide a list of those products.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is setting up a website for Kiwi to raise concerns about supermarket price rises during the coronavirus lockdown.</p>
<p>MBIE has warned if businesses can&rsquo;t meet these conditions they should not offer to sell essential goods while the country is at alert level 4.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If businesses are too generous in their interpretation of what is &lsquo;essential&rsquo; or flout these rules, Government will take further action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Essential goods are those that will keep people warm (heaters, blankets), replace key household appliances, and maintain people&rsquo;s health. Examples of essential products are blankets, fridges, heaters and computers or tablets to work from home or do distance learning, or simply connect with people.</p>
<p>‌</p>
<p>&ldquo;If people can&rsquo;t buy these, then we risk people venturing out of their homes more often,&rdquo; MBIE said.</p>
<p>An MBIE spokesman said it was not able to answering questions relating to individual products or retailers as its teams are prioritising questions and scenarios from businesses at this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any business that is offering essential consumer products must register with MBIE and inform us of their product offering. We will take up any concerns with the businesses at the time of registration. Where businesses take a judgment that is wider than those of their products which are genuinely &lsquo;essential&rsquo;, Government will take further action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We expect businesses to act responsibly in the interests of keeping everyone safe. This includes both businesses and the public making the right calls about what is an essential good,&rdquo; the spokesman said.

<h3 id="mosaic--star-stand-down-staff-wesfarmers-shutters-kmart-nz--sharecafe">Mosaic &amp; Star Stand Down Staff, Wesfarmers Shutters Kmart NZ – ShareCafe</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.sharecafe.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wes.jpg" alt="img">
Major women’s fashionwear retailer Mosaic Brands has become the latest chain operator to shut stores and stand down staff indefinitely, announcing on Wednesday it was unable to keep stores open following the government’s social distancing mandate.</p>
<p>Mosaic, which owns brands such as Noni B, Rivers and Katies, told investors on Wednesday morning it would suspend all store operations from Thursday onwards as sales across Australia’s retail sector continue to steeply decline.</p>
<p>At the same time Wesfarmers is shutting its Kmart outlets in New Zealand and closing its Bunnings stores in the same country to retail customers, but remaining opening to deal with building and construction trades.</p>
<p>The announcements came a day after the Michael Hill jewellery chain announced the closure of 300 stores across Australia, New Zealand and Canada in response to the global crisis.</p>
<p>In a statement, Mosaic said “The Group has recently seen a significant drop in store traffic and revenue, a direct result of the community’s response to the COVID-19 outbreak and the Government’s ‘social distancing’ recommendations.</p>
<p>Some 6,800 employees will be stood down across the business’ 1,379 odd stores with access to leave entitlements while the company reviews what government support may be available.</p>
<p>The store closures start tomorrow.</p>
<p>“The health and wellbeing of the Group’s customers, team and broader community are paramount,” the statement reads.</p>
<p>“The Group’s personal service mandate, which it prides itself on, conflicts with the Government’s ‘social distancing’ recommendations,” Mosaic said in the statement.</p>
<p>The shares fell 23.3% to 23 cents</p>
<p>Wesfarmers has shut its Kmart stores in New Zealand as the coronavirus outbreak continues to escalate.</p>
<p>Wesfarmers told the ASX yesterday that the 25 New Zealand Kmarts would shut for four weeks from midnight last night following the government’s new restrictions on “non-essential services”.</p>
<p>But Wesfarmers said Bunnings will keep its 53 New Zealand stores open to trade to customers but will be closed to the general public during this period.</p>
<p>But for now at least, Wesfarmers’ Australian stores under the Bunnings, Kmart, Target and Officeworks banners will remain open.</p>
<p>“At this stage, state and federal government measures in Australia do not require the closure of retail stores,” the statement reads.</p>
<p>“Bunnings, Kmart, Target and Officeworks stores across Australia are operating under standard or near-standard trading hours and operations continue in the Group’s industrial businesses.</p>
<p>Wesfarmers shares were up 5.4% at $33.41.</p>
<p>And in a separate development the competition regulator, the ACCC has okayed the proposed acquisition of Jewel Fine Foods (in voluntary administration) by Coles Group.</p>
<p>Sydney-based Jewel Fine Foods (Jewel) has been in voluntary administration since April 2019, makes a range of branded and private-label chilled ready meals. Coles does not currently manufacture these products, but is Jewel’s major customer. Jewel also supplies other chains.</p>
<p>In September 2019, the ACCC knocked back an attempt to sell Jewel to B&amp;J City Kitchen, a rival operator in the sector on the basis that it would be likely to substantially lessen competition for the supply of chilled ready meals.</p>
<p>“Coles’ acquisition of Jewel ensures that there will still be two major suppliers of chilled ready meals,” ACCC Commissioner Stephen Ridgeway said in a statement yesterday.</p>
<p>“We are pleased that the administration process will end with Jewel’s business continuing as a going concern and competing with other suppliers.”</p>
<p>“The ACCC investigation focussed on whether other retailers would be foreclosed if Coles acquired the business. We found that Woolworths already has supply arrangements with Jewel’s competitor, B&amp;J City Kitchen, and that other retailers have other options,” Mr Ridgeway said.</p>
<p>Information available to the ACCC indicated that without a going concern sale to Coles, the next best alternative for Jewel’s administrators would likely be liquidation of the assets.</p>
<p>“The continuation of Jewel’s production of chilled ready meals is a better outcome for competition than liquidation of the assets,” Mr Ridgeway said.</p>
<p>“The ACCC investigation commenced before the current increase in demand for groceries. However we consider our decision remains appropriate.”</p>
<p>Coles shares rose 3.1% to $16.65, not because of this dea, but because of the overall rebound in the market.</p>
<p>Casino operator, Star Group yesterday stood down around 90% of its staff of 9,000.</p>
<p>Its casinos Sydney, the Gold Coast and Brisbane have been seriously impacted by the ban on social gatherings, and around 8,100 jobs are affected, including senior management.</p>
<p>The company will provide two weeks of paid pandemic leave and workers will also have access to annual and long service leave entitlements.</p>
<p>“The board and senior management will also forego a significant percentage of entitled directors’ fees and salaries respectively,” the company said. Further details are to come in the near future.</p>
<p>Viva Leisure has closed all its gyms and cancelled the casual shifts of 800 staff.</p>
<p>Non-essential permanent Viva staff have been placed on either paid or unpaid leave and redundancies have been offered for some permanent roles not required during the shutdown period.</p>
<p>Funeral operator Invocare also said it was implementing contingency plans now that funerals have been limited to 10 people.</p>
<p>Invocare said it has live streaming and recording facilities at many of its locations.</p>
<p>Dominos Pizza’s will be closing its New Zealand stores in light of the country’s COVID-19 measures. It joins Wesfarmers which is taking similar action in NZ.</p>
<p>Southern Cross Media has entered a voluntary trading halt has it gauges the impact of COVID-19 on its operations.

<h3 id="wesfarmers-forced-to-close-kmart-nz-stores">Wesfarmers forced to close Kmart NZ stores</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.applianceretailer.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/26124049/Kmart-store1.jpg" alt="img">
Wesfarmers has announced that its 25 Kmart New Zealand stores are now closed and the 53 Bunnings locations in New Zealand are closed to the general public and only open to trade customers.</p>
<p>This announcement responds to measures implemented by the New Zealand government to restrict the operation of ‘non-essential’ services from midnight 25 March 2020 for a period of four weeks.</p>
<p>New Zealand operations represent circa 8% of the Wesfarmers group total annual revenue and Kmart New Zealand represents less than 3% of that revenue.</p>
<p>In a statement to the ASX, Wesfarmers said it recognises the impact these changes will have on team members, suppliers and customers that rely on its businesses for their livelihood and wellbeing.</p>
<p>“Wesfarmers and its divisions will endeavour to support team members through this difficult time and work with the relevant authorities on strategies to reduce the risks of Covid-19 and recommence operations as soon as deemed appropriate,” the statement read.</p>
<p>At this stage, state and federal government measures in Australia do not require the closure of retail stores with Bunnings, Kmart, Target and Officeworks operating under standard or near-standard trading hours.</p>
<p>JB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman New Zealand close temporarily too</p>
<p>JB Hi-Fi released a statement today to confirm that its 14 New Zealand stores, online and commercial operations are closed for a minimum four-week period, following the introduction of alert level 4 restrictions by the government. The JB Hi-Fi New Zealand business does not make a material financial contribution to the group with FY19 sales of NZD $236 million, representing circa 3% of the group’s total annual sales.</p>
<p>“The group is working to support New Zealand team members and customers through this difficult time. The health and wellbeing of our team members, customers, business partners and wider community remains the group’s highest priority,” the statement read.</p>
<p>Harvey Norman New Zealand has closed its 41 store locations, but customers are still able to shop online, although online orders will not be fulfilled until the stores are back up and running at the end of the lockdown period.
