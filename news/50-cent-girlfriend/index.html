<p>50 Cent’s red carpet appearances and social media feeds include images of his lady love, Jamira “Cuban Link” Haines. They made their public debut last summer, surprising many of 50 Cent’s fans because he tends to keep his dating life private.</p>
<p>But ever since, the couple posts videos together and will sometimes pop in the comment section on each other’s timelines. They’re cautious, but on occasion they give fans a peek into their relationship. Learn a little bit more about “Cuban Link.”</p>

<p>How did 50 Cent and Jamira ‘Cuban Link’ Haines meet?</p>
<p>While on an Instagram Live session the two answered a few questions. 50 Cent said, “The first time I went to meet her, she gave me an address and it was the restaurant.” He didn’t realize that’s where he was heading. Haines didn’t want to supply him with her home address for their first date.</p>
<p>She said, “He wasn’t coming to my house!” because she had to check him out and make sure he was real first.</p>
<p>What is Haines’ ethnicity?</p>
<p>Though her nickname and Instagram handle say Cuban Link, Haines is not Cuban. She told social media followers that her mother is Puerto Rican and her father is Black. The New Jersey native is the youngest child in her family and she credits her parents with giving her a great foundation.</p>
<p>She’s a fitness trainer and model</p>
<p>Sure, she’s busy with classes, but Haines is also building up her fitness brand. As a personal trainer, she works with private clients and she told East Coast Magazine that she plans to open her own gym.</p>
<p>Additionally, Haines wants to turn her business, Cuban Fit, into a sprawling empire. To help do that, she may jump back into professional modeling—but as an athletic model. Eventually, she’d like to branch into TV too.</p>
<p>Haines is about to finish her bachelor’s degree</p>
<p>It’s been shared that Haines is a law student, but she clarified that on Instagram Live by saying she is not in law school yet.</p>
<p>She’s currently finishing up her bachelor’s degree at Rutgers University and is due to graduate in summer 2020. Haines has done an internship at a law firm, but she still has to take her LSATs. She plans on studying corporate law.</p>
<p>50 Cent and Cuban Link are solid</p>
<p>The 25-year-old jokingly admitted one of her goals is learning how to cook because she wants to prepare for becoming a wife. Many believe Haines is the one for 50 based on how they gush over each other and interact on social media.</p>
<p>Could wedding bells be in their future? People are genuinely happy for the entertainment mogul and his new bae.</p>
<p>They are fans of one another’s work and last year, 50 Cent even stepped out to one of Haines’ charity back-to-school events in her hometown.</p>
<p>Though you can occasionally catch them together on Instagram Live sessions, don’t expect them to follow fans’ suggestions to start their own podcast. 50 Cent thinks too much private information would get leaked.</p>

50 Cent may keep himself embedded in our pop culture dialogue by way of his extremely active social media accounts, however, for all intents and purposes he is a rather private person. Thus, when he revealed his girlfriend to the world in the summer of 2019, it received quite a bit of attention.For good reason, after all, Jamira Haines&ndash; better known as Cuban Link across social media and YouTube&ndash; is breath-taking. Since walking the red carpet together for the premiere of 50&rsquo;s popular TV show Power, the couple have hit more than one red carpet&ndash; she even joined Fif as he earned his Walk of Fame star&ndash; and they&rsquo;ve become frequent fodder on each other&rsquo;s social media channels.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, she&rsquo;s got the brains to match the beauty. Haines is reportedly studying to become a lawyer, in between gigs modeling and working on her personal fitness goals. We&rsquo;ve dedicated this IG Gallery to each of her pursuits, and even Fif makes a brief (trolling) appearance.</p>

Curtis &ldquo;50 Cent&rdquo; Jackson and Jamira &ldquo;Cuban Link&rdquo; Haines have been together for approximately one year and, at this point in their relationship, there is not much semblance of privacy for either of them. With the quarantine keeping them both home full-time, they could easily be starting to grow tired of each other. Thankfully, it doesn&rsquo;t look like that&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p>This week, Cuban Link shared a new video with her boyfriend 50 Cent, attempting to catch him slippin&rsquo;. Without the ability to mess around with side pieces due to the coronavirus, Fif could have resorted to fielding direct messages from potential thotties. As Cuban Link discovered though, that also doesn&rsquo;t seem to be in Fiddy&rsquo;s plans.</p>

<p>During a cuddle session on the couch, the rapper pulled out his phone and started scrolling. Naturally, Cuban found herself getting curious and she decided to see what he was up to. She did so in a secretive manner though.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh nothing, just checking,&rdquo; she wrote, sharing a video where she zooms into 50 Cent&rsquo;s phone in selfie mode, checking in on his social activity. She went on to tag &ldquo;#wephone&rdquo; at the bottom, reminding her man that there will be no secrets in their relationships. His phone is not off-limits to her.</p>
<p>Watch the funny video below. 50 Cent can breathe a big sigh of relief now.

50 Cent went after Randall Emmett during his &ldquo;Fofty&rdquo; phase, playing the role of a debt collector and giving his foes minimal time to pay him whatever they owed. After the television producer recovered his debt with Fofty, the feud was put to the side. However, Emmett&rsquo;s fiancée Lala Kent continues to bring up their issues and the rapper is tired of hearing about it.</p>
<p>During a sit-down talk with Andy Cohen, Lala Kent explained why she and Randall Emmett&rsquo;s feud was not shown on Vanderpump Rules.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, I won’t say more than I can,&rdquo; she started. &ldquo;There was a very public beef between myself and a pretty famous rapper, and it got very bad. When this all happened, we were not filming. I think we would have had a much harder time if it was happening during filming. But there was also a lot of legal stuff going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amy Sussman/Getty Images</p>
<p>She went on to claim that she just doesn&rsquo;t talk about the situation anymore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything’s good now,&rdquo; said the reality star. &ldquo;Myself and Randall and this rapper, we just don’t speak about each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>50 Cent saw the headlines and got back in attack mode, dedicating an entire Instagram post for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why this bitch don’t just leave it alone,&rdquo; asked Fif. &ldquo;I don’t have beef with this hoe, I had issues with Randell he paid me the money, it’s done. I’m sure Amber is laughing at this guys choices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do you think this will continue or is this the last we hear of 50 Cent&rsquo;s feud with Randall Emmett and Lala Kent?</p>

<p><img src="https://www.sohh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Young-Buck-5.png" alt="img">
Estranged G-Unit member Young Buck is living a hard life. New reports claim the hip-hop star has come close to hitting rock bottom financially and is now living off his girlfriend.</p>
<p>Buck x Bottom</p>
<p>According to reports, his financial situation came to light in amended bankruptcy documents filed last week. The paperwork claims Buck owes over $50,000 to the IRS and more than $100,000 in child support.</p>
<p>Despite being a member of one of the most popular hip hop groups of the mid-2000s, Young Buck said that he has NO property, money in the bank, cash on hand, barely any assets, and owns just $100 in clothes and $100 in jewelry. Things are so bad that he has to rely on his girlfriend for his basic day to day needs; he drives her car and uses her household goods in the home they share, his court papers state. (Bossip)</p>
<p>High-Key Details</p>
<p>In May 2020, buzz developed about Buck Marley filing for bankruptcy in January. The rap heavyweight had also remained behind bars without bail for a past crime.</p>
<p>The rapper lists his main creditors as the mothers of his six kids, the Georgia Department of Human Services and the IRS. The move could be a shrewd business tactic on behalf of Young Buck, who is disputing an undisclosed amount of money owed to 50 Cent and G-Unit. Young Buck is asking to “reject any and all executory contracts with G-Unit and/or Curtis Jackson.” Young Buck did pretty well for himself despite his contractual dispute with Fif, since he earned just under $100,000 a year between 2017 and 2019. (AHH)</p>
<p>Wait, There’s More</p>
<p>In early May 2020, G-Unit boss 50 Cent didn’t hold back on his savagery. Fifty joked about Young Buck wanting to know if this year’s gay pride parade would get nixed.</p>
<p>“👀Hey is 2020 gay pride parade cancelled? 🤔asking for a friend, 😟young Buck. LOL #bransoncognac#lecheminduroi” -50 Cent’s Instagram</p>
<p>Just when you thought @50cent was done flaming @youngbuck … the shade returns. lol #SOHH #SOHHNews pic.twitter.com/vpl7J1WsWU — SOHH.com (@sohhdotcom) May 5, 2020 50 Cent takes a swipe at Young Buck with the feud between the two going way back</p>
<p>Before You Go</p>
<p>According to reports, a fugitive warrant ultimately sealed Buck’s fate December 20, 2019.

<p><img src="https://www.sohh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Cuban-Link-Selfie-Pic-Moment-Quarantine-2.png" alt="img">
New York rapper 50 Cent‘s girlfriend Cuban Link wants everyone to put positivity over negativity. The hip-hop veteran’s publicized boo went online this week to give motivation for people on their journeys to success.</p>
<p>Cuban x Motivate</p>
<p>On Sunday, Cuban Link hit up Instagram to share some new pics, give motivation and a thoughtful message. Cuban encouraged followers to trust the process and avoid letting stress or fear dominate their minds.</p>
<p>“.. .. everything will work out exactly how and when it’s supposed to if you allow the faith in your journey to be stronger than your doubts and fears! Be patient with yourself and your growth, knowing that (good things always take time). Give yourself time and space to try things and explore different paths . You’ll get there one day just enjoy the journey! ♥️” -Cuban Link’s Instagram</p>
<p>Lacking</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Link hit up Instagram with some low-key cringe footage. The clip featured her laying up on 50 but secretly getting a close-up of his phone.</p>
<p>“.. .. oh nothing , just checking 🧐😅 .. .. #wephone” -Cuban Link’s Instagram</p>
<p>Wait, There’s More</p>
<p>A few weeks agp, Cuban shared a hilarious sneak peek at her dream household setting. The IG post even sparked a few reactions from 50 Cent and “Power” actress La La Anthony.</p>
<p>LMFAO – @50cent&rsquo;s boo Cuban Link only has a few requirements to stay indoors during quarantine. lol #SOHH #SOHHNews pic.twitter.com/txJx5NeZD5 — SOHH (@sohh) April 9, 2020 50 Cent’s boo Cuban lays out her quarantine demands</p>
<p>“.. .. I’ll stay in the house if it looks like this !! 💁🏽‍♀️😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊@50cent#RightLadies??” -Cuban Link’s Instagram</p>
<p>“🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣Right ‼️” -La La Anthony</p>
<p>“👀That’s it ? oh ok 🤔but you get yo a** back in the house first. That ain’t shit wait let me count.” -50 Cent</p>
<p>Before You Go</p>
<p>In early April 2020, the rap heavyweight gave Link a major ultimatum. Curtis Jackson told her she would either have to start cleaning around his place or be forced to leave and deal with the coronavirus epidemic on her own.</p>
<p>“i got these for @_cuban_link 😡she got mad, i don’t care she gotta clean up🤷🏽‍♂️or go out side with the corona’s. #abcforlife #starzgettheapp #bransoncognac #lecheminduroi theking🍾”

In May, Brian Austin Green broke his silence about Megan Fox’s blooming relationship with musician Machine Gun Kelly aka Colson Baker and announced it in an episode of his podcast ‘With Brian Austin Green’ that he and his former wife had decided to separate.</p>
<p>Although their relationship was speculated to be troubled, the couple held on to their marriage for many years. Fox and Green share three children together — seven-year-old Noah Shannon, six-year-old Bodhi Ransom, and three-year-old Journey River. While the ‘Transformers’ actress was spotted with her alleged beau quite a few times in the recent past, Green was recently seen taking a stroll with the ‘Celebs Go Dating’ fame Courtney Stodden. In a few pictures shared by Daily Mail, Green and Stodden are seen exiting a restaurant.</p>
<p>Who is Courtney Stodden?</p>
<p>Stodden is a 25-year-old multidimensional American media personality who is popular for appearing in reality TV shows, ‘Couples Therapy’, ‘Celebrity Big Brother’ and ‘The Mother/Daughter Experiment’. She is also widely known for her first marriage to actor Doug Hutchison who was four years older than her father. Stodden, at the age of 16, met Hutchison through an acting workshop on the internet. Apparently, Hutchison wasn’t aware of the age difference of 34 years that he shared with Stodden when he began a courtship with her which lasted for nearly six months.</p>
<p>In 2011 the couple married in Las Vegas, Nevada. Stodden was 16 when she married Hutchison aged 50. Their wedding, of course, garnered a lot of attention and the duo was subjected to criticism for their rather uncomfortable relationship. However, their marriage began to see cracks soon and the couple announced their separation in 2013 but reconciled in 2014. In January 2012 it was reported that Stodden and Hutchison were living separately, and eventually filed for divorce in March 2018, which was finalized in January 2020.</p>
<p>Stodden announced her divorce from Hutchison on Instagram in March with a long post on Instagram, talking about their relationship of a decade nearly. “I’ve been scared to even speak up about feeling groomed or being verbally abused during the almost 10-year marriage because I was a child and he was 50 when we married but I’m a woman now and it’s time for me to put my big girl pants on and speak on this matter. “ she wrote in the post.</p>
<p>Before her marriage to Hutchison, Stodden hosted her own cable TV show ‘Ocean Shores’. In 2010 she ventured into the music industry and released her singles &lsquo;Car Candy&rsquo;, &lsquo;Crazy&rsquo;, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t Put It on Me&rsquo;, &lsquo;Hurting People&rsquo;, and &lsquo;We Are America&rsquo;. Along with Hutchison, she appeared on ‘Couples Therapy’ in 2012. A year later she participated in ‘Celebrity Big Brother’ and got evicted two days before the finale receiving the least number of votes. Stodden has kept herself busy with appearances here and there. In 2014, she featured in 50 Cent’s ‘Don’t Worry Bout’. In August she appeared in an episode of ‘Hollywood Hillbillies’. In 2015, she released a solo sex tape through Vivid Entertainment and stated that all the profits from it would be donated to a charity.</p>
<p>In 2016, she featured in Lifetime series ‘The Mother/Daughter Experiment: Celebrity Edition’ with her mother and in the same year made her film debut with ‘Love Addict’. Stodden was last seen on Dr Phil in 2017.</p>
