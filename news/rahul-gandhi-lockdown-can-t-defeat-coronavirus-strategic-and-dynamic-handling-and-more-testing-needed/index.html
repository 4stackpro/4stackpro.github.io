NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said the “the lockdown is not a solution to fight the coronavirus” as it can “only pause situation” and what is needed to be done by the government is to go testing &ldquo;aggressively and strategically&rdquo;.Addressing an AICC media briefing via video conferencing days after the PM extended the lockdown after arriving at a consensus with the CMs, Gandhi said, &ldquo;In no way does a lockdown defeat the virus. It helps only to pause the virus for a short while. The only way to do this is to increase testing and chasing the virus, and going beyond, and this is my advice to the government &ndash; use testing,&quot;.He also warned of major economic crisis post-Covid19 crisis, and urged the need for the government widening the social security net especially by providing free food for the needy, including the stranded migrant workers. “Our godowns are full. The government must provide food to all the poor”.He found fault with the government approach in conducting tests. “Currently testing levels are too low. I am proposing scaling up testing. One advice to the government is, push testing aggressively. Maximise testing and use testing strategically, to assist states in their fight,&rdquo; Gandhi, an MP from Kerala&rsquo;s Wayanad, said.To a question on how the Congress leaders of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad and many senior Congress leaders and Congress CMs had supported the broad direction of the government handling of the Covid-19 outbreak, Gandhi said, “&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want go to go in the past. We must fight unitedly together and not get into the blame game. Instead let&rsquo;s use our resources carefully and give the money to states and districts.&ldquo;He predicted a &ldquo;massive financial backlash&rdquo;, stating that the first wave of unemployment was already on its way.&ldquo;We must ensure that in protecting lives, we don&rsquo;t destroy our economy completely.&rdquo; He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should have a more detailed conversation with states. &ldquo;But the Prime Minister has a different style of working and we can work around that style,&rdquo; he said.

<p><img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Rahul-Gandhi-.jpg?fit=640%2C359&amp;ssl=1" alt="img">
On Wednesday, the members of the Congress IT cell took to social media to congratulate Gandhi-scion and Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi by claiming that the Health Ministry had recognised Wayanad for ‘excellent results in tackling coronavirus’.</p>
<p>Rahul Gandhi’s fans on social media went on to applaud the ever youth icon for his so-called achievements of tackling coronavirus in Wayanad. Several social media posts were shared across platforms claiming that Wayanad had successfully tackled the coronavirus crisis under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi.</p>
<p>It’s neither MODI’S Varnasi</p>
<p>Nor SMRITI’S Amethi</p>
<p>IT IS RAHUL’S “WAYANAD”</p>
<p>CONSTITUENCY THAT HAS BEEN RECOGNISED BY THE HEALTH MINISTRY FOR ITS EXCELLENT RESULTS IN TACKLING COVID-19.</p>
<p>The district had NO NEW CASES for past 16 DAYS.@RahulGandhi is the most SINCERE LEADER!!🖖 pic.twitter.com/3QIpYWOeTr — Vaishnavi Desai (@Vaishnavi_3) April 15, 2020</p>
<p>The Rahul Gandhi fanboys cheered their youth leader, claimed that it was Wayanad MP who made preparations which led to Wayand being recognised for its efforts.</p>
<p>That’s because .@RahulGandhi ji not only prepared in #Wayanad but also cautioned to prepare for #CoronavirusOutbreak . If corrective precautions would have been taken in February things would have been far much better,At the same time we need to follow all GOVT protocols — Abhishek Dutt (@duttabhishek) April 16, 2020</p>

<p>Perhaps, the followers of Rahul Gandhi seems to have got inspired by their leader as they shared misleading reports on Wayanad tackling coronavirus effectively.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi took to Twitter to compliment himself by claiming that the Health Ministry has recognised his parliamentary constituency – Wayanad for the ‘excellent results in tackling coronavirus’. The official Twitter account of Rahul Gandhi’s office said that not a single case has been reported in the past 16 days from the district in Kerala.</p>
<p>In fact, it is Gandhi-scion Rahul Gandhi who misled his fanboys regarding the alleged Health Ministry’s recognition of Wayanad. Rahul Gandhi, in a hurry to get free publicity, made claims without backing up with any evidence to prove his assertions.</p>
<ul>
<li>article continues after ad - - article resumes -</li>
</ul>
<p>The Rahul Gandhi’s supporter, just like his master, did not care to check with facts before congratulation and cheering the Gandhi-scion for an ‘achievement’, for which he was not really part of.</p>
<p>Wayanad – Hotspot District with Cluster</p>
<p>Despite all the exaggeration, the reality is much different from what Rahul Gandhi claims on the achievements of Wayanad district in terms of handling the corona crisis.</p>
<p>The union health ministry has not recognised Wayanad for its achievement in containing Coronavirus as being claimed by Rahul Gandhi and his minions. On the contrary, the ministry has identified the district as one of the hotspots of Coronavirus in the country. According to the Health Ministry, Wayanad is one of the seven districts in Kerala considered to coronavirus hotspots. The ministry has also drafted the district in the ‘Hotspot Districts with Cluster’, which is a category below the full Hotspot district, which means that although the entire district is not hotspot, it has hotspot clusters for coronavirus. Out of 7 districts in Kerala, 6 are classified as full hotspots, while Wayanad has been classified as a district with cluster.</p>
<p>Contrary to the claims of Rahul Gandhi that Health Ministry has recognised Wayanad for its efforts to tackle the Chinese pandemic, the fact is that the union ministry has still kept the district in the red zone, and has not moved to the next lower category, the white zone.</p>
<p>Although Wayanad has reported only 3 Coronavirus cases so far, and two of them have recovered, the district is still listed as red zone clustered hotspot by the union govt, therefore the claim that union ministry has acknowledged the district for containing Coronavirus is not correct.</p>
<p>What are Red Zone hotspots?</p>
<p>According to the criteria of the health ministry, highest caseload districts contributing to more than 80 per cent of cases in India or highest caseload districts contributing to more than 80 per cent of cases for each state of India or districts with doubling rate less than four days are classified into Red Zone category by the Health Ministry. Mumbai, South Delhi, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kasaragod are the top five districts in Red Zone category.</p>
<p>The Union Health Ministry on Thursday delineated 170 districts in 25 states as coronavirus hotspots. Out of the 170 districts, 123 districts have been identified as ‘Hotspots Red Zone Districts’, while remaining 47 districts are classified as ‘Hotspot Districts with Cluster’, which includes Wayanad.</p>
<p>These Red Zone districts can be turned to Orange Zone if no cases are reported in 14 days. Then these zones will be turned to Green Zone when no positive cases are reported in the next 14 days. Other than 170 districts, 207 non-hotspot districts with clusters and non-infected districts have been classified as Green Zone.

<p>The one-size-fit-all lockdown has brought untold misery &amp; suffering to millions of farmers, migrant labourers, daily wagers &amp; business owners.</p>
<p>It needs a “smart” upgrade, using mass testing to isolate virus hotspots &amp; allowing businesses in other areas to gradually reopen.</p>
<p>— Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) April 13, 2020</p>
<p>I would like to bring to your notice that all migrant labour who have been facing acute distress may not be holding NFSA cards. In addition, many deserving people have been excluded from the NFSA lists: Congress President. Smt. Sonia Gandhi pic.twitter.com/NckIfAXbXn</p>
<p>— Congress (@INCIndia) April 13, 2020</p>
<p>Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has been critical of the way Narendra Modi-led central government is handling the Coronavirus pandemic in the country. For his fresh attack, Gandhi took to Twitter and said that the nationwide lockdown is economically hurting the poor and that a more planned approach should be adopted to eradicate their misery.He recommended the government to use mass testing to isolate virus hotspots and allow businesses in other areas to gradually reopen.After Prime Minister Modi announced the extension of nationwide lockdown, the Congress party has questioned the government&rsquo;s strategy to help the poor. It has also asked the Centre about how they plan to carry out mass testing of people for coronavirus.The Congress had earlier suggested some measures to be adopted during the lockdown. These include a suggestion by the party president Sonia Gandhi, that the poor be provided free ration for six months.On Monday, the Congress chief Sonia Gandhi said, &ldquo;Ten kg grain per person may be provided free for six months to those who may be facing food insecurity but not having ration cards. I would like to bring to your notice that all migrant laborers may not be holding NFSA cards. In addition, many deserving people have been excluded from the NFSA lists.&ldquo;A senior leader Anand Sharma has demanded that a stimulus package be created for MSME and Industries.Sonia Gandhi appeals to stay indoors, follow social-distancing | Full Speech
