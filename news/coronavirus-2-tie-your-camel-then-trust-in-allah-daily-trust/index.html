<p>We are still on the rampaging Coronavirus pandemic, bulldozing its way all over the world despite measures put in place to block its advance. May Allah continue to protect us from it and its siblings.</p>
<p>In an article dated December 1, 2009 (more than ten years ago), an Islamic writer Sister Aaminah Hernandez on <a href="http://www.islamicity.org">www.islamicity.org</a> restated this Hadith of Prophet of Islam Muhammad (peace be upon him) from 1440 years ago:</p>
<p>“One day the Prophet noticed a Bedouin [or desert Arab or, in Hausa, Bakauye] leaving his camel without tying it. He asked the Bedouin, ‘Why don’t you tie down your camel?’ The Bedouin answered, ‘I put my trust in Allah.’ The Prophet then said, ‘Tie your camel first, then put your trust in Allah.’ (Reported by Tirmidhi).</p>
<p>“This refers to the common sense and reasoning that Allah in His Infinite Mercy has bestowed upon the human intellect, so that we are able to take due precautions, plan and prepare for possible future events, and create a means of addressing those needs on our own. It seems to have become a common practice for people to say that preventative and preparative actions are unnecessary because they display a lack of trust in Allah for our sustenance, safety, or future plans.</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENT HOW OVER 5000 NIGERIA MEN HAVE PERMANENTLY OVERCOME TERRIBLE BEDROOM PERFORMANCE DUE TO THIS RECENT DISCOVERY BY MEDICAL CONSULTANTS</p>
<p>“But if we do not bother to tie our camel, and it wanders off or is stolen, we have only ourselves to blame. Let’s increase our trust in Allah, but let’s do our part by first tying our camels!”</p>
<p>‘SO TIE YOUR CAMELS!’: And so it is with Coronavirus. We should continue trusting in Allah for protection against COVID-19 – AFTER doing all the necessary rituals and routines of tethering our camels, signified by regular handwashing, social distancing, taking hot lemon water, staying at home, et al…</p>
<p>PRINCE AND PRIME MINISTER: A reader quipped to me that COVID-19 seems to be elitist – ‘catching’ Prince Charles and British PM Boris Johnson. I agreed that it may seem so, but that it is a question of access to real testing equipment which may not available to us here. And even among the elite, aren’t others still ‘negative’ – for example US President Donald Trump?</p>
<p>GOVERNOR AND CHIEF OF STAFF: Another ‘evidence’ adduced by the reader about COVID-19 Elitism is that Bauchi Governor Bala Muhammad and Presidency Chief of Staff Abba Kyari have both tested positive. Add to them son of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar (my one-time boss). Some of them had travelled abroad and Corona followed them (evidence that this is NOT an African virus, thank God!) And may Allah cure them, and may He protect us.</p>
<p>AND OH, I’M NOT ‘THAT’ BALA MUHAMMAD: We do share the name Bala Muhammad with the Bauchi Governor and, eerily, he was also a journalist. For several years I have lived under the ‘shadow’ of that other Bala. For example, someone once approached my daughter to ask for ‘help’ in redeploying from an NYSC PPA (Place of Primary Assignment). Despite my daughter’s profuse ‘wallahi tallahi’ her father is another ‘Bala’, the friend never believed her; that she just didn’t want to connect them with the then FCT Minister. And when Namesake won Bauchi Governorship, I got tons of congratulatory messages – including, wallahi, from the Villa – and various offers of ‘menteeship’ (if you catch my drift). Alhamdu lilLah I’m no 419ner. And Allah Ya sauwake, My Namesake.</p>
<p>THANK YOU, BUA AND DANGOTE, BUT: As usual, the Kano Duo of Dangote and BUA (AbdusSamad Isyaka Rabi’u) have reached into their deep industrial pockets to donate to Nigeria. Dangote first donated Two Hundred Million Naira (with more to follow I believe). BUA came up with One Billion Naira, plus placing order for life-saving equipment. One can swear by wallahi tallahi some of these monies will be looted by many a thieving civil and public servant. May any thief of these donations test positi… (well, they say don’t wish it even upon your enemy). But let them not steal it, and may Allah protect ‘our’ money.</p>
<p>AS KANO LOCK DOWNS: Dangote and BUA, note that we, your Kano siblings, are under lockdown from 12 midnight last night and we need such magnanimity. You have to look home. Two Billion Naira (one from each of you) will go a long way as economic and social stimuli for the 20 million of us here (Jigawa stop salivating and giraffing – didn’t you get your ‘independence’ in 1991?) And FYI I know the right people to distribute such stimuli – and they are NOT at Government House, or the Emirs’ Palaces.</p>
<p>…ESPECIALLY THAT I’M TWO MONTHS SALARY-LESS: Academics ASUU members unregistered on IPPIS have not been paid February and March salaries. Even WITH the salaries, we run deficit budgeting regimes in our lives. Now without salaries, we are really at Ground Zero. For this, and for anything that happens to us socially or economically, blame, in this order, PMB, Finance Minister Zainab Ahmad, the Kano man Accountant General of the Federation Ahmad Idris (one-time avid reader of this Column) and ASUU National Chairman Biodun Ogunyemi. We are in lockdown, and our salaries locked up. Haba!</p>
<p>SO LET US PRAY: O Allah! You alone we worship and from You alone, we seek help. You know we have no access to ventilators and respirators and other life-saving equipment available to Princes, PMs, Governors, Chiefs of Staff, Sons of Excellencies, etc. Therefore, O Allah, do not cause us to be afflicted with COVID-19 and any ailment now, and forever. O Allah, You know malaria is enough trial, but they are even appropriating chloroquine from us. O Allah, there is no ‘light’ and the temperature in Kano is around 41°C (heading towards Ramadan). May this hot weather kill Coronavirus thoroughly and completely, and may cooling rain descend on us before, during and after Ramadan. O Allah, remove this affliction and throw it far away (and only You know exactly where, or who, is ‘far away’).</p>
<p>Amin!</p>

<h3 id="jordanian-artist-taps-absurd-for-camel-in-the-room">Jordanian artist taps absurd for &lsquo;Camel in the Room&rsquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://9c998969b63acdb676d1-37595348221e1b716e1a6cfee3ed7891.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/almpics/2020/03/CamelintheRoom.jpg/CamelintheRoom-870.jpg" alt="img">
Raed Ibrahim, a 46-years-old Jordanian artist, works in an eclectic range of formats from abstract oil painting to street signs, to dress and embroidery and found artifacts.</p>
<p>Ibrahim&rsquo;s new exhibit “A Camel in the Room” plays out in four different galleries at Darat al Funun — the Khalid Shoman Foundation&rsquo;s arts complex in Amman — where the artist explores the relationship between objects and memory, truth and storytelling.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a Middle Eastern twist on the 19th century Russian fable &ldquo;The Inquisitive Man,&rdquo; about the museum visitor who notices all the tiny animals in the exhibit but not the massive taxidermied elephant in the room.</p>
<p>The exhibit calls attention to an unexamined side of seemingly familiar iconography including landmark buildings, tourist trinkets and national flags.</p>
<p>Also read</p>
<p>The camel on display in this show is an enlarged version of a made-in-China souvenir of Jordan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always wanted to do a camel,&rdquo; said Ibrahim, &ldquo;It so often accompanies the ideas and sometimes the stigma attached to our culture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s directly modeled on a camel doll I bought in the market downtown with the word &lsquo;Jordan&rsquo; printed on the saddle. It plays a Tunisian tune when you squeeze it,&rdquo; said the artist with a smile.</p>
<p>The Saudi-born Jordanian son of a father from Nablus and a mother from Beirut explores the Arab postcolonial predicament and the enduring question of Palestine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As an Arab visitor to Europe or Africa, I&rsquo;ve been asked if I live in a tent or ride a camel. Here in Amman, the shopkeepers who sell souvenirs to tourists display these little stuffed camels. Somehow, they are supposed to represent Jordan, but I really don&rsquo;t know how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Darat al Funun, the eight-foot-tall plush pink object can&rsquo;t be missed, and Ibrahim and gallery workers are installing mirrors on the walls so visitors will escape neither the camel in the room nor their own reflections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It becomes kind of an infinity space where we look at ourselves, the people who are with us, and how we in the region are looking at history,&rdquo; said Eline van der Vlist, the artistic director of Darat al Funun. “I think that ties nicely in what he&rsquo;s done with the Twin Towers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the adjacent gallery, Ibrahim makes connections between &ldquo;monument, miniature, metaphor and memory&rdquo; with four different architectural and allegorical models of the World Trade Center&rsquo;s iconic towers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in this very room when I first learned of the attacks on the towers,&rdquo; said Ibrahim, who on Sept. 11, 2001, was participating in a Shoman Foundation artist&rsquo;s workshop with Syrian painter Marwan Kassab-Bachi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever since then, I always wanted to explore questions about what 9/11 did to us, what it did to the world and how it re-represents us to the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our culture, religion, image became a result of this incident and somehow minimized all our history at this one single moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the back of the gallery, two white steel tubes emblazoned with the Marlboro brand and a cloud of black smoke made of polychloroprene balloons, dried industrial foam and papier-mâché immediately draw in the visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking at events as a consumer of a product with the buildings burning and letting off smoke like a cigarette.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cigarette towers stand as a three-dimensional Roy Lichtenstein-esque pop art piece, simultaneously humorous and horrifying.</p>
<p>The friendly pink camel in the room next door becomes retrospectively intimidating.</p>
<p>Then, perhaps the boldest piece in the exhibit comes into view: two black-painted stainless steel towers, one mounted with a gold automated model airplane circling the top. Another identical structure is crowned with a gold band clearly referencing the kiswah, the traditional cloth that covers the Kaaba in Mecca, the site of Muslims’ pilgrimage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The plane is circling the tower like the people circle the Kaaba while they perform the tawaf,&rdquo; said Ibrahim. &ldquo;The movement is a ritual, but the process of going around is a chance to reconsider an object from its different sides.”</p>
<p>&ldquo;To me, our relationship with 9/11 is like this. We repeat arguments about whether this event represents us, or does it not. Are we like that? Are we not like that? So it&rsquo;s about questioning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fifth tower is made of wood slivers tied together with small bits of string. The imposing industrial workshop pieces in the rest of the room recede as the viewer ponders Ibrahim&rsquo;s &ldquo;scaffolding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, the intention is more about the work, the structure that helps build the structure. I&rsquo;m trying to find something in the design — while in the real world, scaffolding is something that goes only on the outside — extending it inside and asking impossible questions about what holds us up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a small adjacent gallery, Ibrahim has installed a set of six framed late 19th/early 20th century cast iron house locks.</p>
<p>Behind the antique hardware, the artist has placed blue paper shadows under the objects mounted in the glass-enclosed display.</p>
<p>Keys are a ubiquitous motif in Palestinian art, a symbol of the Nakba, or the &ldquo;catastrophe&rdquo; caused by the 1948 founding of the Israeli state and the displacement of Palestinians, and a defiant, hopeful symbol of their aspiration to return home.</p>
<p>Locks, a reference to keys as the symbol of Palestinians displaced in 1948, also feature in the exhibition &ldquo;The Camel in the Room&rdquo; by artist Raed Ibrahim. (courtesy of the artist)</p>
<p>&ldquo;The relationship with Palestine is immediately obvious to everyone,&rdquo; said van der Vlist. &ldquo;And yet as we see refugees from Iraq and Syria today, we&rsquo;re reminded that inherited narratives of being dispersed from your homeland are universal.&rdquo; She went on, &ldquo;So the work addresses the wider question of who gets to tell your story and the ripple effects of stories for generations to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The work also raises questions about the authenticity and efficacy of memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I actually tried to find locks from Palestine in the antique markets, but I couldn&rsquo;t find them here,&rdquo; said Ibrahim. &ldquo;I actually got these in Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So presenting the locks is kind of a problematic gesture saying that, OK, here&rsquo;s the locks, you could open them if you have the keys,&rdquo; and see the problem from the other side, he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a problem if you are from the second or third generation. We are dealing with the locks and their shadows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One floor below in a solitary gallery called the Ghorfa, Ibrahim has reinstalled his ongoing project, “The State of Ishmael: Jus Sanguinis.&rdquo; The Latin term refers to citizenship laws determined by the nationality or &ldquo;bloodline&rdquo; of one or both parents.</p>
<p>The room is filled with imagined artifacts belonging to &ldquo;The State of Ishmael&rdquo; — a kind of alternative Palestine with founding documents and national iconography. The assemblage simultaneously draws upon and critiques the cultural reservoir and legal structures Zionists used to conceive Israel.</p>
<p>Ibrahim first created his &ldquo;state&rdquo; in the Swiss town of Aargau less than 70 kilometers (43 miles) from Basel, where Theodor Herzl convened the first Zionist Congress in 1897.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a residency there in 2009, and it was clear to me that I want to do a project around the occupation. I wanted to occupy this beautiful Swiss town and call it Ishmael, who is from the Torah and Quran and known as the son of Haggar, who was kicked out of Palestine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ishmael&rsquo;s Declaration of Independence is on display, its text similar to Israel&rsquo;s founding document. Critical word switches flip the concepts of the Zionist narrative. Jews and Jewish are replaced with Muslims and Muslim. Ishmael substitutes in for Israel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The land of Ishmael is the birthplace of the Ishmaeli people. Here they first attained statehood, created cultural values of national and universal significance and gave the world the eternal ‘Book of Testimonials.’ After being forcibly exiled from their land, the people of Ishmael kept faith throughout their dispersion and never ceased to pray in the hope of freedom and return,” goes the text.</p>
<p>Ishmael&rsquo;s map is an outline of the Swiss canton of Aargau, with the names of destroyed Palestinian cities within its boundaries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took the ladybug symbol from the Swiss,&rdquo; said Ibrahim. &ldquo;It looks so cute on their chocolates, but in these red and black colors and the way I designed the stencil, it becomes menacing and aggressive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ibrahim&rsquo;s Ishmael is more cautionary than aspirational.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Definitely, this is a horrible state to adopt; you have to be a Muslim to be accepted. You have to have a blood relation to the state to be able to become a citizen. It&rsquo;s really a racist country built on someone else&rsquo;s land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Part of the exhibit is a workstation where visitors can fill out applications for Ishmaeli citizenship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The box is already filling up with completed forms.</p>
<p>As the current US/Israeli vision attempts to impose new contours of power and space on the region, Ibrahim&rsquo;s work offers timely questions of legitimacy and representation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ultimately, this is not something that I can look at from outside,&rdquo; said Ibrahim. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something that is still going on and I don’t possess the privilege of being poetic about it. I need to use direct language and gestures.&rdquo;

<h3 id="despite-a-human-pandemic-red-river-zoo-welcomes-new-addition">Despite a human pandemic, Red River Zoo welcomes new addition</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.inforum.com/incoming/5019314-xqji08-New-baby-camel/alternates/BASE_LANDSCAPE/New%20baby%20camel" alt="img">
FARGO — In the midst of a human pandemic comes a bright spot from the animal kingdom here.</p>
<p>The Red River Zoo has welcomed a female Bactrian camel, born March 14.</p>
<p>Despite the zoo being closed to the public due to the COVID-19 pandemic, staff members are working to ensure the health and safety of the new addition, as well as the other animals.</p>
<p>Related:</p>

<p>Sally Jacobson, executive director of the zoo at 4255 23rd Ave. S., said the calf was born healthy, but weighing 114 pounds at birth, was a bit larger than most.</p>
<p>“Due to that legginess, she had a little bit of difficulty learning how to nurse. We just couldn’t get her in the right position,” Jacobson said.</p>
<p>As a result, staff members made the decision to bottle feed the baby under the care of its mother every three hours, around the clock.</p>
<p>Since the mother&rsquo;s milk supply has diminished, the baby camel is getting the same kind of formula that farmers feed to goat &ldquo;kids,&rdquo; Jacobson said.</p>
<p>“She gets 250 ounces each day at this point. Uffdah!” she said.</p>
<p>The work has paid off, because the camel now weighs a healthy 130 pounds.</p>
<p>The baby is being kept with its mother, primarily, but is brought into an arena at the zoo to exercise.</p>
<p>“She’s got to be used to humans but act like a camel,” Jacobson said.</p>
<p>Caring for the new addition, along with all of the other zoo animals, has become more difficult during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Jacobson said staff has been divided into two teams working different shifts, so they never come in contact with each other.</p>
<p>If someone has to quarantine themselves, the zoo has ensured that enough staff members are cross trained in the care of the animals, she said.</p>
<p>They’re doing that with a smaller staff, as they operate in a sort of “emergency mode.”</p>
<p>The zoo relies financially on school groups and other events in the spring, and without those, it’s had to cut some employees, Jacobson said.</p>
<p>It costs about $100,000 a month to operate the zoo, she said.</p>
<p>“You could see how, if this lasts too long, it could get a little scary fairly quickly for us,” she said.</p>
<p>Fortunately, people have been renewing memberships despite the zoo not being open at this time, she said. The zoo also has an emergency fund on its website where donations are being accepted.</p>
<p>As for the new baby camel, she doesn’t have a name yet. Keep an eye out for a naming contest, which will be done online.</p>
<p>Meantime, people can see the new baby camel on the Red River Zoo&rsquo;s Facebook page and will be able to see her in person when it resumes normal operations.</p>
<p>“We can’t wait until we can start letting people back in,” Jacobson said.
