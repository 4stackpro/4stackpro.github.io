(CNN) Nearly a year after a massive blaze devastated the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, only seven people attended a special televised Good Friday Easter mass at the 850-year-old church.</p>
<p>The ceremony began Friday morning, with Paris Archbishop Michel Aupetit entering the cathedral and presenting an important relic, the Crown of Thorns of Christ, which survived the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A year ago, the cathedral was destroyed. Today the country is ravaged by a pandemic. There&rsquo;s always a message of hope, and this celebration at the heart of the cathedral will be the sign of our hope,&rdquo; Aupetit told CNN affiliate BFMTV before the service,.</p>
<p>The 40-minute Friday mass also featured classical musician Renaud Capuçon playing the violin. Actors Philippe Torreton and Judith Chemla, who also sang, delivered readings of Christian texts.</p>

Good Friday remembers the death of Jesus (Picture: Joe Raedle/Getty)</p>
<p>The Easter weekend is here and offers a time of reflection and repentance to those of Christian faith.</p>
<p>The period is one of the most religious in the calendar and commemorates the life, death and resurrection of Jesus.</p>
<p>Lent this year began on 26 February and saw Christians fast or abstain from indulgences for the past 40 days.</p>
<p>Good Friday, Easter Sunday and Easter Monday all fall within the last week of Lent – known as the Holy Week – and here’s what you need to know about the first of those days.</p>
<p>What is Good Friday?</p>
<p>Good Friday sees Christians remember the trial and death of Jesus on the cross.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, Jesus was arrested in the Garden of Gethsemane after being betrayed by Judas.</p>
<p>Jesus was made to carry his own cross (Picture: Francis G. Mayer/Getty)</p>
<p>He had spent the previous evening, Maundy Thursday, with his 12 disciples at the Last Supper.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>Following his arrest, Jesus taken to the House of Annas where he was interrogated, flogged and sentenced to death.</p>
<p>He was then made to carry his own cross to the site of his execution where he was then crucified.</p>
<p>How did Good Friday get its name?</p>
<p>With the day being observed as one of sorrow and penance, it’s hard to understand why it would come to be known as Good Friday.</p>
<p>There are many theories behind the etymology, a popular one being the term good adapted from the word god – thus God’s Friday.</p>
<p>However the most accepted derivation of the name come from the obsolete adjective good, which often described something that was regarded as holy or pious by the Church.</p>
<p>This is apparent in the Christian greeting of ‘good tide’ at Christmas or on Shrove Tuesday.</p>

Pastor Frank Heidkamp talks to a worshipper behind the wheel during an Easter &lsquo;drive-in&rsquo; service on a giant car park</p>

<p>Düsseldorf (Germany) (AFP)</p>
<p>Hundreds of Christians in the German city Duesseldorf found a creative way to celebrate Good Friday while respecting social distancing rules imposed to slow the coronavirus, coming together for a &ldquo;drive-in&rdquo; service on a massive car park.</p>
<p>Most worshippers followed the mass &ndash; conducted on a small stage by a skeleton crew of Catholic and evangelical clergy &ndash; from behind the windscreen.</p>
<p>But a few keen heads could be seen poking out of open roofs into the spring sunshine, while other members of the congregation lowered the tops of their convertibles to perch on the backs of the seats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it was a sad feeling at first, because I would have liked to be in my church&hellip; (but) with this car service we&rsquo;re trying to create a little bit of community,&rdquo; Catholic priest Frank Heidkamp told AFP.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When people are praying and singing together in their cars, that can be an encouraging sign for them that they&rsquo;re not alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From compact city runarounds to flashy SUVs and even the odd scooter, the vehicles of the faithful lined up side-by-side in parking spaces usually reserved for visitors at the Duesseldorf convention grounds.</p>
<p>People booked free tickets online in advance, offering them up for scans through the closed windows of their cars.</p>
<p>Even city mayor Thomas Geisel and his wife could be spotted among the glass-and-metal ranks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wanted to make the most of the opportunity and participate in an Easter service, when you&rsquo;re here in person it&rsquo;s very different from watching on the internet,&rdquo; said attendee Dana Baerwald.</p>
<ul>
<li>&lsquo;Living with the virus&rsquo; -</li>
</ul>
<p>Germany has been in lockdown for almost three weeks, with many businesses and schools closed and gatherings of more than two people banned.</p>
<p>Chancellor Angela Merkel asked citizens for &ldquo;patience&rdquo; Thursday, saying COVID-19 &ldquo;will not disappear before we have a vaccine to immunise the population: and that means living with this virus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The veteran leader is due to review the unprecedented nationwide restrictions &ndash; currently planned until April 19 &ndash; with regional premiers next week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a time like none of us has seen before,&rdquo; said evangelical pastor Heinrich Fucks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to become of us. That makes it all the more important to have a moment of community, all the more important to find some hope here together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stepping down from the stage, whose altar covered in a white cloth supported a small cross and weighty Bible, priest Heidkamp moved among the rows of cars after mass to exchange a few words with members of his flock through their car windows &ndash; maintaining a safe distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You miss personal contact, the service and also the ceremonial side, communion and so on. I miss those in everyday life,&rdquo; said 53-year-old attendee Reinold Welbers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re used to things being different, but maybe it can work like this,&rdquo; he mused.</p>
<p>At least in this western city the next drive-in services are already planned, with a mass lined up for Easter Sunday and a protestant celebration on Monday.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, online streams or radio and television broadcasts and even loudspeakers mounted on cars have been spreading the Easter message.</p>
