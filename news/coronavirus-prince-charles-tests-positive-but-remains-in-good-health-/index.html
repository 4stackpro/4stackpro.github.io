Image copyright Reuters Image caption The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall are isolating at Birkhall, their residence on the Balmoral estate</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales has tested positive for coronavirus, Clarence House has announced.</p>
<p>Prince Charles, 71, is displaying mild symptoms &ldquo;but otherwise remains in good health&rdquo;, a spokesman said, adding that the Duchess of Cornwall, 72, has been tested but does not have the virus.</p>
<p>Charles and Camilla are now self-isolating at Balmoral.</p>
<p>Buckingham Palace said the Queen last saw her son, the heir to the throne, on 12 March, but was &ldquo;in good health&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The palace added that the Duke of Edinburgh was not present at that meeting, and that the Queen was now &ldquo;following all the appropriate advice with regard to her welfare&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A Clarence House statement read: &ldquo;In accordance with government and medical advice, the prince and the duchess are now self-isolating at home in Scotland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tests were carried out by the NHS in Aberdeenshire, where they met the criteria required for testing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not possible to ascertain from whom the prince caught the virus owing to the high number of engagements he carried out in his public role during recent weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Image copyright PA Media Image caption Buckingham Palace releases a photograph of the Queen speaking to the prime minister from Windsor Castle</p>
<p>The duke and duchess arrived in Scotland on Sunday. Charles had been displaying mild symptoms over the weekend and was tested by the NHS in Aberdeenshire on Monday.</p>
<p>The results came through on Tuesday night, showing he was positive.</p>
<p>Charles is still working, is up and about and in good spirits.</p>
<p>The 71-year-old heir to the throne last saw the Queen briefly on the 12 March. Three days earlier, mother and son had more protracted contact during the Commonwealth Day Service.</p>
<p>It is important to re-emphasise the Queen is in good health. She moved to Windsor last week, with the Duke of Edinburgh who came from his usual residence at Sandringham in Norfolk.</p>
<p>Given their ages, 93 and 98 respectively, there will be particular care taken that they are not jeopardised by this virus.</p>
<p>Prince Charles and Camilla will be following governmental advice and isolating separately. It&rsquo;s not a huge house but certainly big enough to isolate yourself within it.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve got a small staff with them - and it&rsquo;s expected Charles will now be in Scotland for a couple of weeks recovering from the symptoms.</p>
<p>The prince&rsquo;s last public engagement was on 12 March - the same day he last saw the Queen - when he attended a dinner in aid of the Australian bushfire relief and recovery effort.</p>
<p>However, Charles has also been working from home over the last few days, and has held a number of private meetings with Highgrove and Duchy of Cornwall individuals, all of whom have been made aware.</p>
<p>A number of household staff at Birkhall - the prince&rsquo;s residence on the Balmoral estate - are now self-isolating at their own homes.</p>
<p>A palace source said the prince has spoken to both the Queen and his sons - the Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex - and is in good spirits.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had been informed about the prince&rsquo;s positive test result on Tuesday morning and he wished him &ldquo;a speedy recovery&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The spokesman added the PM&rsquo;s weekly audience with the Queen was now taking place by telephone.</p>
<p>Figures released from NHS England show there were 28 deaths over the latest recorded 24-hour period, bringing the coronavirus death toll in England to 414.</p>
<p>There have also been 22 deaths so far in Scotland, 22 in Wales and seven in Northern Ireland, according to the latest available figures.</p>

<h3 id="coronavirus-things-will-get-worse-pm-warns-in-letter-to-britons">Coronavirus: Things will get worse, PM warns in letter to Britons</h3>
<p><img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10D2A/production/_111460986_2.53086737.jpg" alt="img">

<p>The prime minister has warned the coronavirus crisis &ldquo;will get worse before it gets better&rdquo;, in a letter being sent to every UK household.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson, who is self-isolating after testing positive for Covid-19, says stricter restrictions could be put in place if necessary.</p>
<p>Britons will also get a leaflet detailing government rules on leaving the house and health information.</p>
<p>It follows criticism over the clarity of government advice to date.</p>
<p>The number of people who have died with coronavirus in the UK has now reached 1,019, with a further 260 deaths announced on Saturday.</p>
<p>There are now 17,089 confirmed cases in the UK.</p>
<p>In the letter being sent to 30 million households at an anticipated cost of £5.8m, Mr Johnson writes: &ldquo;From the start, we have sought to put in the right measures at the right time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will not hesitate to go further if that is what the scientific and medical advice tells us we must do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important for me to level with you - we know things will get worse before they get better,&rdquo; the letter reads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we are making the right preparations, and the more we all follow the rules, the fewer lives will be lost and the sooner life can return to normal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Experts have said they expect the number of coronavirus cases and deaths to continue to rise for the next two to three weeks, before the effects of social distancing measures and restrictions on everyday life begin to have an impact.</p>
<p>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How staying at home can stop coronavirus</p>
<p>In his letter, Mr Johnson describes the pandemic as a &ldquo;moment of national emergency&rdquo;, urging the public to stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives.</p>
<p>He also praises the work of doctors, nurses and other carers as well as well as the hundreds of thousands of people who have volunteered to help the most vulnerable.</p>
<p>The leaflet sent alongside the letter includes guidance on handwashing, an explanation of coronavirus symptoms, the government rules on leaving the house and advice on shielding vulnerable people.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, new powers, including fines of up to £5,000, to enforce guidelines on people staying at home and businesses staying closed came into force in Northern Ireland on Saturday evening.</p>
<p>The maximum fine will be reserved for businesses but individuals could face a fine of up to £960 if they do not comply.</p>
<p>The prime minister&rsquo;s letter follows comments by the medical director of NHS England, who said on Saturday &ldquo;now is not the time to be complacent&rdquo; over the virus.</p>
<p>Speaking at the government&rsquo;s daily coronavirus briefing, Prof Stephen Powis said &ldquo;every one of us&rdquo; had a part to play if the UK was to keep the death toll under 20,000.</p>
<p>Business Secretary Alok Sharma also announced insolvency rules would be changed to allow firms greater flexibility as they faced the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>He said a range of measures to boost the supply of personal protective equipment, such as face masks, to protect frontline NHS staff, were also being introduced.</p>
<p>It comes as testing begins to be rolled out for frontline hospital staff in England to see whether they have coronavirus.</p>
<p>In Wales and Scotland, health workers are already being tested. Northern Ireland&rsquo;s testing begins on Monday.</p>
<p>As well as the prime minister, Health Secretary Matt Hancock is also self-isolating after testing positive for the virus. The UK&rsquo;s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, is also self-isolating, but has not tested positive.</p>

<p>What measures has Spain taken?</p>
<p>Spain, which has a population of 46.7 million, has recorded more than 6,300 infections.</p>
<p>Late on Saturday, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez&rsquo;s wife Begoña Gómez tested positive for the virus, the government confirmed.</p>

<p>It said they both remained in the prime minister&rsquo;s residence at La Moncloa in Madrid and were doing fine.</p>
<p>About 1,800 more cases have been recorded since Friday evening - many in the capital.</p>
<p>Image copyright Reuters Image caption Shops selling food and other basic necessities will remain open in Spain</p>
<p>Under a state of emergency, Mr Sánchez is banning Spanish citizens from leaving home, except for buying essential supplies and medicines, or for work.</p>
<p>All museums, cultural centres and sports venues will be closed. Restaurants and cafes may only do home deliveries.</p>
<p>Essential services like banks and petrol stations will remain open. Schools are already shut across the country.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Mr Sánchez appealed for unity, calling on all regions to put ideological differences aside and put citizens first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to tell the workers, the self-employed and businesses that the government of Spain is going to do everything in its power to cushion the effects of this crisis,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The state of emergency will last for two weeks - more if deemed necessary and parliament approves.</p>
<p>This will be the second state of emergency in the country since the transition to democracy began in 1975, the first being a 2010 air traffic controllers&rsquo; strike.</p>
<p>And what about France?</p>
<p>France, a country of 63.5 million people, has reported more than 4,400 confirmed cases.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Édouard Philippe said the number of people in France in intensive care was growing and earlier guidelines for the public were being ignored.</p>
<p>The closure - which went into force at 23:00 GMT on Saturday - applies to restaurants, cafes, cinemas and nightclubs as well as non-essential businesses.</p>
<p>It will not, Mr Philippe said, affect essential businesses which he listed as food shops, chemists, banks, tobacco shops and petrol stations.</p>
<p>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Everything you need to know about the coronavirus – explained in one minute by the BBC&rsquo;s Laura Foster</p>
<p>Mr Philippe also asked people to reduce their travel, especially between towns. &ldquo;The best way to slow down the epidemic&rdquo;, he said, was &ldquo;social distancing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say this gravely - we must all together show greater discipline in the application of these measures,&rdquo; Mr Philippe added.</p>
<p>Local elections due on Sunday will still go ahead, he said. Religious buildings will remain open but gatherings and ceremonies should be postponed.</p>
<p>Schools in France will be closed as of Monday until further notice.</p>
<p>France reported a sharp rise in cases on Saturday, from 3,661 to 4,499. It recorded 12 more deaths, bringing the toll to 79.</p>
<p>The BBC&rsquo;s Paris correspondent, Hugh Schofield, says the measures amount to a dramatic ratcheting-up of the French response, reflecting growing alarm at the fast spread of the virus.</p>
