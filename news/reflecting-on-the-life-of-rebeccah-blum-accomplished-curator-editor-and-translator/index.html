<p>Rebeccah Blum, a curator, translator, editor, and mother, died in Berlin on July 22. She was murdered by her former partner, British-born photographer Saul Fletcher, who subsequently committed suicide at Blum’s country home. Blum was 53 years old.</p>
<p>Born in 1967, Blum grew up outside of Philadelphia. In 1985 she headed to American University in Washington, DC, to study art history under feminist luminaries like Norma Broude and Mary Garrard, who cemented her interest in gender parity in the art world. After completing her studies, Blum worked at an art gallery and various restaurants in San Francisco.</p>
<p>In 1992, she relocated to Düsseldorf. Three years later, she moved to Berlin where she co-founded and chaired arts non-profit art Base e.V., a rhizomatic entity that held online exhibitions as early as 1995. In 1997, Blum played an integral role in the formation of txt.de, a marketing platform for independent publishers. The ethos of these projects reflected her belief in non-hierarchical collaboration and her penchant for curatorial experimentation and play, not to mention her prescience.</p>
<p>Blum became a director at Berlin-based gallery Aurel Scheiblerin 2007. At the gallery’s ScheiblerMitte outpost, she curated and co-curated several exhibitions, including a show of work by French-American video artist Michel Auder in 2009. She went on to co-found and direct SATELLITE BERLIN, a nonprofit platform committed to forging fruitful connections between artists and scientists, and launched her own eponymous art management firm, Blum Fine Art Management. Blum, who was fully bilingual in German and English, simultaneously built a career as a freelance editor and translator. She worked on monographs, exhibition catalogues, magazines, and more for Anton Kern Gallery, David Noland Gallery, and Hatje Cantz, among other clients. Blum returned to school in 2017 for a Master’s in Management of Cultural and Nonprofit Organizations at University of Kaiserslautern. She graduated this June and was gearing up for a new chapter professionally. Blum was also in the process of writing a book about the art world, her 22-year-old daughter Emma told Hyperallergic.</p>
<p>“She was the most animated person,” Emma continued. “When she told a story, she would get up from the table to gesture with her hands — she told it with her whole body.” Emma described an exuberant woman, someone who laughed easily, made jar after jar of chutney and marmalade, packed her house with art, and was surrounded by friends. Fletcher, Emma explained, was her mother’s on-and-off partner for eight years before he killed Blum and himself.</p>
<p>Posts commemorating Blum have been circulating on Instagram — an effort that is imperative in light of the coverage of her death, pieces that have glossed over her personhood to instead laud Fletcher’s art career or sensationalize his personal connections.</p>
<p>Berlin-based gallery ChertLüdde captioned an image of a beaming Blum, “She was a beautiful person who dearly deserves to be remembered as such, a Woman with a name, a profession, a rich life and a precious smile that we want to share with everyone.” The caption went on to express that the gallery “firmly condemn[ed] the brutality that took her life away, a too well known violence that needs to stop.”</p>
<p>Jane Rosenzweig, a close friend of Blum’s since their freshman year of college, portrayed Blum as someone who loved beautiful things, the type of person to pack a picnic on a whim. “Everyone felt this magnetic pull toward her because she was so special, so loving, so curious. She wanted to understand everything; that’s how she was in every interaction,” she told Hyperallergic. “We can’t measure what we’ve lost.”

<p>Rebeccah Blum, a noted arts curator, and Saul Fletcher, a British photographer, have died in Berlin. Although it has not yet been officially verified, multiple media sources reported Blum, 53, was murdered by Fletcher, 52, at his Berlin flat. He is believed to have subsequently committed suicide at Blum’s country home in Brandenburg, west of Berlin. Their bodies were discovered on 22 July.</p>
<p>Fletcher, whose friends say suffered from serious mental health issues, and Blum had been in an on-off relationship for many years. Berlin authorities confirmed that they are not seeking anyone else in conjunction with the case, and Blum&rsquo;s daughter confirmed her mother&rsquo;s death on social media.</p>
<p>Blum, the mother of two children, was born in 1967 and was raised close to Philadelphia. She studied art history in Washington DC before moving to San Francisco to work in an art gallery, supporting herself with restaurant work.</p>
<p>Blum moved to the German city of Düsseldorf in 1992, at the age of 25, before settling in Berlin in 1995, where she co-founded the non-profit arts organisation Base e.V. and the independent publishing platform txt.de. Blum became a director of the ScheiblerMitte gallery Aurel Scheibler in 2007 before founding her own art management firm, Blum Fine Art Management. As a freelancer, she supported the Berlin office of publisher Verlag der Kunst amid countless other projects.</p>
<p>The Berlin-based Mexican artist Julieta Aranda, a friend and colleague, says in an Instagram post that she pays tribute to Blum on behalf of the Berlin artistic community. Aranda remembers “a woman with a name, a profession, a rich life and a precious smile that we want to share with everyone. We are here to express our condolences and sorrow, to pay respect to her achievements and to honour her memory, as the brilliant woman she was and as a dear friend for many. We want to recall her name, and firmly condemn the brutality that took her life away, a too well known violence that needs to stop.”</p>
<p>Emma Blum, 22, one of Rebeccah’s two daughters, used Instagram to remember a committed mother, a ceaselessly inventive cook and an adventurous and enthusiastic lover of life “who supported me through every crisis, who raised me and loved me unconditionally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love her so much and I miss her so terribly,” Blum’s daughter wrote. “She was just taken from me, without warning and in such a violent way by one of the people she loved. I can never forgive this and I can never forget this. I want her name to be remembered and nobody else’s.”</p>
<p>Fletcher was born in 1967 to a working class family in the village of Barton-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire, and spent his early adulthood ferrying coal on cargo ships in Hull harbour. His earliest photographs, made after he joined an amateur photography club, were of North Lincolnshire&rsquo;s docks.</p>
<p>After moving to London in the early 1990s, he set up a makeshift studio in Crouch End and began to explore a form of carefully constructed portraiture, of himself and others. He supported himself by assisting the photographer Juergen Teller.</p>
<p>Fletcher moved to Berlin around the turn of the millennium. Those close to him remembered a warm but erratic man who often seemed happy and content but, at the depths of depression, would rarely leave the confines of his home or studio, where much of his work was created.</p>
<p>Most of his photographs used the walls of his studio as a canvas or backdrop for self-portraits. He would arrange found objects, vegetation, dead animals, Polaroids, paintings, drawings or pages torn from his notebooks, before photographing the composition, or himself in the midst of the composition, with an obsessive repetition.</p>
<p>After gaining representation from New York’s Anton Kern Gallery, Fletcher gained critical recognition for shows at London’s Courtauld Gallery; the Atlanta Contemporary Art Center; the Hessel Museum of Art, New York; MUMOK, Vienna; and the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, among others. He gained some populist fame for his visual work for the London-based alt rock band Placebo and, recently, a friendship with the actor Brad Pitt.</p>
<p>Fletcher’s last solo exhibition, titled Four Loom Weave, went on show at Anton Kern Gallery, New York, in Autumn 2018. Fletcher told the Financial Times at the time: &ldquo;I use whatever I have to hand, trying to create something, trying to make something good out of something bad.”</p>
<p>Fletcher’s most recent artwork, titled Don’t Let the Darkness Get You Down, is part of the exhibition Untitled 2020 on show at Punta della Dogana, Venice, until 13 December 2020.

<h3 id="rebeccah-blum-well-regarded-berlin-based-independent-curator-is-dead">&ldquo;Rebeccah Blum, Well-Regarded Berlin-Based Independent Curator, Is Dead&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Rebeccah-Blum.jpg?w=1024" alt="img">
Rebeccah Blum, an independent curator based in Berlin who ran a namesake art management firm, has died. The news was confirmed by her daughter Emma Blum in an Instagram post.</p>
<p>In her Instagram post, Emma Blum wrote, “I want to take a moment to talk about my mom. Rebeccah. The person who supported me through every crisis, who raised me and loved me unconditionally. The amazing cook, who could open the fridge and magically make a dish out of something nobody would ever expect to taste good. Who, when she told a story, would sometimes get up, gesturing all over the place, so animated and excited in what she had to tell. I miss her silly ways and the conversations we had in the evening while cooking together. She taught me card tricks and games, took me to the forest to go mushroom hunting.”</p>
<p>Emma Blum’s post continued, “I love her so much and I miss her so terribly. She was just by taken from me, without warning and in such a violent way by one of the people she loved. I can never forgive this and I can never forget this. I want her name to be remembered and nobody else’s.”</p>
<p>Rebeccah Blum was found dead last week. Several media outlets reported the death as a murder-suicide committed by British-born photographer Saul Fletcher. In a statement sent to ARTnews, a spokesperson for the Berlin Public Prosecutor’s Office confirmed the news. The statement added, “According to the present state of knowledge, [Fletcher] first killed the woman you named [Rebeccah Blum] and then committed suicide. Investigations into the causes of death and the circumstances of the crime are still ongoing.”</p>
<p>Rebeccah Blum was well-known in the Berlin art scene. Prior to starting her Berlin-based firm, Blum Fine Art Management, she had been a director at ScheiblerMitte gallery in Berlin (an adjunct exhibition space of Aurel Scheibler in the downtown area of the German capital), joining the enterprise when it opened its space in the city in 2006. Among the exhibitions mounted at ScheiblerMitte, which staged its last presentation in 2011, were solo shows of work by Joe Zucker, Anthony Goicolea, and Michel Auder. Oftentimes, the exhibitions were the artists’ first in Berlin. She also worked on the gallery’s production of its exhibition catalogues and contributed texts on the work of Ad Reinhardt, Alice Neel, and others.</p>
<p>Among Blum’s curatorial credits at ScheiblerMitte was a 2009 group exhibition titled “Shadow/Existence” that Blum organized with Jennifer Bork. The show included work by Jonathan Bragdon, Tom Chamberlain, Öyvind Fahlström, Neil Gall, Nico Glaenzel, Mark Lombardi, Alexander Schellow, David Schutter, Jorinde Voigt, and Michael Wutz.</p>
<p>In the press release to the “Shadow/Existence,” Blum and Bork wrote, “[Chaos and order] alternate rhythmically yet form a whole that refers to the ambivalence of all that is. ‘Shadow/Existence’ addresses this ambivalence in its notion of presence and absence. Oneʼs own shadow cannot exist alone but requires a source of light and an object. It is not representational and not present yet carries the trace of presence within.”</p>
<p>Blum also operated Wordsmith, an editing service focused on German-to-English translation and the production of texts in those two languages. According to the company’s website, clients included the Goethe Institute, Satellite Berlin, the Vitra Design Museum, and the publisher Hatje Cantz, for which she translated some of the essays for an exhibition catalogue of Stephan von Huene.</p>
<p>Blum also worked as the European representative for New York’s David Nolan Gallery for over 10 years. During her tenure at David Nolan, she helped coordinate exhibitions with the gallery’s Europe-based artists at the New York location and worked in the gallery’s art fair booths.</p>
<p>In an email to ARTnews, the gallery’s owner, David Nolan, said, “Rebeccah excelled at explaining art to clients and curators. She was a great communicator and a very warm person that always put the artists and clients at ease. I could trust her totally to choose works from an artist’s studio and make studio visits and liaise for me with dealers and others in our complicated contemporary art world.”</p>
<p>Nolan said that one of the artists whom Blum introduced him to was Berlin-based artist Jorinde Voigt, whom he first met in 2009 and has represented for around 10 years. Nolan subsequently included Voigt in the gallery’s summer exhibition in 2010 and has since mounted six solo shows of Voigt’s work, including one this past spring.</p>
<p>Nolan added, “I will remember her for her honesty, humor, and intelligence. A lovely person who was the most loyal friend one can be fortunate enough to know.”</p>
<p>Update, 7/30/20 2:05 p.m.: This article has been updated to include confirmation from the Berlin Public Prosecutor’s Office that Blum is believed to have been murdered by artist Saul Fletcher.

Editor’s Note: ARTnews has issued an apology to the family of Rebeccah Blum regretting that the original version of this article covering the shocking news of Blum’s murder hadn’t been more respectful of her and her many accomplishments. Read a separate obituary of Blum, published on July 29, 2020, here.</p>
<p>Saul Fletcher, a British-born, Berlin-based artist, is the subject of an investigation “on the suspicion of murder” of Rebeccah Blum, a well-regarded Berlin-based curator who was found dead last week before Fletcher reportedly committed suicide. Blum’s death was confirmed this week by her daughter, Emma Blum.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to ARTnews, a spokesperson for the Berlin Public Prosecutor’s Office confirmed the news. The statement added, “According to the present state of knowledge, [Fletcher] first killed the woman you named [Rebeccah Blum] and then committed suicide. Investigations into the causes of death and the circumstances of the crime are still ongoing.”</p>
<p>The spokesperson did not provide further details about the investigation, including those that have been circulating in the press surrounding the story, which was first reported by the Daily Mail.</p>
<p>Rebeccah Blum, who was in a romantic relationship with Fletcher, was a well-regarded independent curator in Berlin. She had previously worked as director at ScheiblerMitte, an outpost of Berlin’s Aurel Scheibler gallery. She also ran a fine art management services, Blum Fine Art Management, and an editing service focused on German-to-English translation, Wordsmith. She also worked for over 10 years as the European representative for David Nolan Gallery in New York. Read a full obituary for Blum.</p>
<p>“I love her so much and I miss her so terribly,” Emma Blum, her daughter, wrote on Instagram. “She was just by taken from me, without warning and in such a violent way by one of the people she loved. I can never forgive this and I can never forget this. I want her name to be remembered and nobody else’s.”</p>
<p>The three galleries that represented Fletcher at the time of his death—Anton Kern Gallery in New York, Knust Kunz Gallery Editions in Munich, and Grice Bench in Los Angeles—provided to ARTnews a joint statement regarding the reports: “We are devastated, appalled, and shocked by the tragic loss of Rebeccah Blum and Saul Fletcher. We are all grief-stricken and confused. We offer our deepest condolences to their families and together are offering our support and help.”</p>
<p>Fletcher first came to prominence in the late 1990s when he began showing with New York’s Anton Kern Gallery. His work has appeared in major international exhibitions as well, including the 30th Bienal de São Paulo in 2012, the 4th Berlin Biennale in 2006, and the 2004 Carnegie International in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Update, July 30, 2020: This article has been updated to include a statement from the Berlin Public Prosecutor’s Office confirming that Saul Fletcher is a suspect in the investigation into Rebeccah Blum’s murder.

Zum Tod der Kuratorin Rebeccah Blum : An wen wir uns erinnern wollen</p>
<p>Die Kuratorin Rebeccah Blum wurde mutmaßlich Opfer von Saul Fletcher, einem in Berlin lebenden britischen Fotokünstler.</p>
<p>Ich kann mich gut an den Tag erinnern, an dem ich Rebeccah zum ersten Mal traf. Wir hatten uns im Café Einstein zum Lunch verabredet. Es war ein herzliches Kennenlernen mit humorvoller Verwunderung darüber, wie viel Gemeinsamkeiten wir hatten.</p>
<p>Zunächst nahmen wir wahr, dass wir beide Jeans trugen, halbhohe Stiefel, Bluse und ähnliche Jacken, wir zückten die identischen Portemonnaies und hatten da schon festgestellt, dass wir gleich alt waren, dass wir beide jeweils eine Tochter im gleichen Alter hatten und die gleiche deutsch-amerikanische Verwurzelung. Wir waren erstaunt und lachten und fühlten uns verbunden.</p>
<p>Mörderischer Suizid Ende Juli erstach der britische Fotokünstler Saul Fletcher seine Lebensgefährtin, die Kuratorin Rebeccah Blum, und gestand der Tochter die Tötung der Mutter. Anschließend beging er Suizid. In der Presse wurde das Verbrechen wie gewohnt mit dem Euphemismus „Familiendrama“ bedacht. Man erfuhr zwar, dass Brad Pitt ein Freund des Fotografen war, das Opfer dagegen war offenbar keine Erwähnung wert. Dagegen erhebt Kit Schulte mit ihrem Nachruf Einspruch. Und viele Leute aus dem Kunstbetrieb tun es ihr gleich.</p>
<p>Ich hatte meine Galerie geschlossen, wollte ein Drawing Center aufbauen und suchte eine Partnerin. Ein gemeinsamer Kontakt führte mich zu Rebeccah. Aus dem Drawing wurde nichts, aber dafür entstand Satellite Berlin, eine Nonprofit-Plattform mit Fokus auf der Verbindung von Kunst und Wissenschaft, in die wir unser Herzblut steckten.</p>
<p>Rebeccah war unglaublich gut in ihrem Job als Lektorin, Publizistin, Coachin, Netzwerkerin und Kunst- und Kulturvermittlerin. Sie war professionell, präzise und wortgewandt in der englischen und deutschen Sprache. Sie pflegte eine große Leidenschaft für Text, egal ob Dichtung oder Marketing; sie erstellte Inhalte für die unterschiedlichsten Kunden, ob Künstlerinnen, Museumskuratoren oder große Autoherstellern und andere Unternehmen.</p>
<p>Eine aufrichtige Zuhörerin</p>
<p>Die Kunst stand jedoch im Fokus und ihr Hauptanliegen galt immer dem Wohl der Künstler und Künstlerinnen, von denen so viele von ihr mit großem Engagement, Liebenswürdigkeit, Verantwortung und ohne Selbstzweck betreut wurden. Rebeccah ging es darum, den allgemeinen Dialog von Kunst und Kultur in sinnvoller Weise anzufachen und neue Inhalte in Zusammenarbeit mit anderen Bereichen zu entwickeln. Sie war eine aufrichtige Zuhörerin, diplomatisch, verantwortungsvoll und verlässlich, immer voll da.</p>
<p>Rebbecah war eine wundervolle Mutter. Sie liebte die Arbeit mit Kindern, wir sprachen oft über Bildungsprojekte und versuchten Programme für den Nachwuchs in unser Programm zu integrieren. Wir sprachen viel über die unterschiedlichen Kulturen der USA und Deutschlands, was wir liebten und was wir vermissten.</p>
<p>Mein Beileid gilt ihrer Tochter, ihrer Familie in den USA und ihrem engen Freundeskreis in Deutschland. Dieses Geschehen, dieser Mord, um es beim Namen zu nennen, ist unverzeihlich. Saul Fletcher wird das mit sich tragen, als Mensch, Seele, Künstler.</p>
<p>Es geht nicht darum, wer wer ist oder Freund von welchem Prominenten auch immer. Es geht darum, einen Menschen, der aus seinem Leben gerissen worden ist, zu ehren, Rebeccah Blum als die wundervolle Person, die sie war, in liebevoller und aufrichtiger Erinnerung zu verabschieden.</p>
<p>Die Kunstberaterin</p>
<p>Rebbecah wurde in Berkeley, Kalifornien, geboren, wuchs in Philadelphia auf und kam in ihren frühen Zwanzigern nach Düsseldorf und anschließend nach Berlin. Von 2007 bis 2012 leitete Rebeccah Blum die Galerie Scheibler Mitte.</p>
<p>2012 gründete sie ihre Firma Blum Fine Art Management und widmete sich ausgiebig der Unterstützung von Künstler/Innen, Galerien und Sammlern in Form von Projektmanagement, Verwaltung und Beratung. Von 2014 bis 2017 gründete und leitetet sie mit mir Satellite Berlin – art in collaboration, anschließend gründete sie ihr Unternehmen the Wordsmith.

<h3 id="is-dismal-the-best-education-new-mexicans-can-expect">&ldquo;Is ‘dismal’ the best education New Mexicans can expect?&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://d3el53au0d7w62.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/14/jn12_jd_16aug_education-1200x800.jpg" alt="img">
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;. &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>Wilhelmina Yazzie decided to sue the state of New Mexico after years of frustration with her son’s education. Parents were asked to donate old socks to wipe the dry-erase boards. Students weren’t allowed to bring textbooks home because there weren’t enough of them. Teachers left so frequently that a constant carousel of substitutes had to run the classes.</p>
<p>Yazzie’s son, Xavier, had been earning straight A’s and was active in sports. In third grade, however, Xavier scored below grade level on statewide and national achievement tests. “I would go in and they would tell me, ‘Yeah, he’s still below his grade level,’ and I’m like, ‘How is this happening?’ ” Yazzie said.</p>
<p>Xavier attends school in New Mexico’s Gallup-McKinley district on the edge of the Navajo Nation. A majority of the district’s students are Indigenous, speak English as a second language, or come from low-income families. As state courts later found, the district exemplifies New Mexico’s systemic failure to provide students with even the most fundamental necessities, let alone the culturally and linguistically relevant education to which they are entitled by law.</p>
<p>ADVERTISEMENTSkip</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>In 2014, the same year that Yazzie, several other families and six school districts filed their lawsuit, almost 95% of fourth-grade English-language learners were not proficient in reading or in math. Almost 94% of 11th-grade students were not proficient in reading, while 97% lacked proficiency in math. The year before, the New Mexico Public Education Department reported that almost 67% of all students in the Gallup-McKinley district were not proficient in reading. Among English-language learners, that number was closer to 87%.</p>
<p>New Mexico routinely ranks last in the nation when it comes to the well-being of its children and their chances for success, and experts say this amplifies the consequences for “at-risk’ students – even honor roll students such as Xavier.</p>
<p>“He’s getting good grades,” Yazzie recalled officials saying, with the underlying message left unspoken: “What more do you want?”</p>
<p>When Yazzie decided to sue the state, she was thinking of more than her own children; she cared about all the children in the community. “My mother instilled that in us,” she said, “that we’re all a family within the community and within our nation, and that we need to look out for one another and especially for our children.”</p>
<p>So, in 2014, Yazzie sued, claiming that New Mexico failed to provide a uniform and sufficient system of free public schools, and demanding that the state implement an adequate education budget and distribute the money equitably. In 2017, the case went to trial and lasted eight weeks, over the course of which plaintiffs produced a staggering amount of evidence, including over 3,000 exhibits and testimony from more than 100 witnesses. In 2018, the state’s 1st Judicial District Court ruled in Yazzie’s favor. “It wasn’t just about my son,” said Yazzie. “It was about all the other children who were struggling more than my son.”</p>
<p>Yazzie’s win proved instrumental in spotlighting the state’s desolate education system and may yet catalyze real change – but only if courts are able to hold the state accountable. So far, the Land of Enchantment has resisted this court-mandated change.</p>
<p>The children who will benefit most from the court ruling make up nearly three-quarters of the state’s student population. In 2017, nearly 72% came from low-income families and nearly 15% had disabilities, while another 13% were English-language learners. Another 11% were Indigenous. All four groups are classified as “at-risk” for the purposes of the state’s funding formula, meaning that they are supposed to receive additional resources, but that their allotment is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>“Statistics don’t lie,” said Rep. Derrick J. Lente, D-Sandia Pueblo. “When you look at our state, Native American and Hispanic kids are always at the bottom of the list when it comes to their proficiency in English, math and science … and we’re the highest when it comes to dropout rates.”</p>
<p>In July 2018, New Mexico’s 1st Judicial District Court declared the state’s education system a dismal failure. The court ordered the state to address the problem immediately, calling for increased funding, extended learning opportunities, including summer and after-school programs, smaller class sizes, quality pre-kindergarten, dual language support, social services, and better teacher recruitment and retention. It also called for the development of culturally and linguistically relevant curricula.</p>
<p>The state was told to implement reforms by April 15, 2019, but the New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty (NMCLP) says there’s been almost no real change in the classrooms. “The court ruled that our school system is broken, that the constitutional rights of our students are being violated, and that massive change is required to fix our school system,” said Gail Evans, NMCLP’s lead counsel for the Yazzie plaintiffs. “So far, the state’s response has been to do business as usual. (New Mexico is) nickel-and-diming our children.”</p>
<p>The court also ruled that the state had violated students’ constitutional rights, as well as New Mexico’s Indian Education Act and Bilingual Multicultural Education Act – laws that have been on the books since 2003, but never adequately funded or implemented, Evans said.</p>
<p>The ruling gave New Mexico a watershed opportunity to redress problems in educational policy that have plagued it since it first achieved statehood, but policymakers have long disagreed over how to serve a student population that is one of the most culturally and linguistically varied in the entire United States. Educational reform bills were proposed in the Legislature in both 2019 and 2020, some outlining strategies to bring the state into compliance with the court’s decision. While many of those bills received majority or unanimous votes in the House, when they reached the Senate, they were either voted down or not heard. This includes a bill that would have supplied internet to libraries in Indigenous communities. “It’s shameful that this state has not invested in broadband access,” said Rebecca Blum-Martinez, an expert witness who worked with the NMCLP during the 2019 session. “Especially in terms of Indigenous children out on the reservations, a lot of them don’t have any access to the internet. What are they supposed to do then?”</p>
<p>While legislators increased education funding by 16% (roughly $450 million) for the state’s 89 school districts in 2019, the increase fell short of pre-2008 recession spending levels and a majority of the money went to increasing teachers’ salaries – a crucial step, but one that left the districts with almost no resources to implement programming. New Mexico teacher salaries are still among the lowest in the nation and many districts have been forced to cut programs.</p>
<p>“We have to make some really substantial changes in our educational system so that we can allow our students to become college- and career-ready,” said Rep. Lente. “If we don’t, we’ll have a continued system that directly relates to the highest number of unemployment, health disparities and societal disparities. It’s a cycle, so we have to be able to cure that somehow.”</p>
<p>In January 2020, Lente sponsored a bill that would include appropriations for pueblos and tribal nations in the state, in response to the Yazzie lawsuit. It died along with most of the proposed education bills.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the 2019 New Mexico Public Education Department’s Math and Science Annual Report shows that Anglo third-graders showed proficiency at over twice the rate of Indigenous, Hispanic and African American students. Results for other grades and subjects also indicate that students of color are not being served equitably.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.monopol-magazin.de/sites/default/files/2020-07/79889a42-e2a5-4fce-89de-f527223454aa.JPG" alt="img">
Der Fall der ermordeten Kunsthistorikerin und Kunstberaterin Rebeccah Blum schockiert die Berliner Kunstwelt. Galeristinnen und Galeristen wollen die Erinnerung an die Tote wachhalten</p>
<p>Rebeccah Blum wurde vergangene Woche mutmaßlich von dem Fotokünstler Saul Fletcher erstochen. Er hatte die Tat gegenüber Blums Tochter gestanden, bevor er sich selbst das Leben nahm. Berliner Galeristinnen und Galeristen wollen in sozialen Netzwerken und in einer Todesanzeige an die 52-Jährige erinnern. Obwohl es üblich ist, dass in Presseberichten der Name des Opfers nicht genannt wird, heißt es in dem von mehreren Galerien geteilten Text: &ldquo;Wir wollen uns an ihren Namen erinnern und die Brutalität, die ihr das Leben genommen hat, entschieden verurteilen, eine allzu bekannte Gewalt, die aufhören muss. Es ist Rebeccah Blums Name, der in Ehren gehalten und im Gedächtnis bewahrt werden muss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nach dem Bekanntwerden des Falls wurde auch über die Form der Berichterstattung diskutiert: Sollte der Name des mutmaßlichen Täters genannt werden, aber nicht der des Opfers? Verschleiert der Begriff &ldquo;Familiendrama&rdquo;, dass es sich um einen Femizid handelt?</p>
<p>Rebeccah Blum arbeitete als Galeriemitarbeiterin, unter anderem bei Aurel Scheibler, als Kuratorin, Gründerin des Projektraums Satellite Berlin und als Kunst-Mangerin mit eigener Firma. &ldquo;Rebeccah Blum war Mutter, sie war ein Mitglied unserer künstlerischen Gemeinschaft, sie war eine großartige Person, die es verdient, als solche in Erinnerung zu bleiben, eine Frau mit einem Namen, einem Beruf, einem reichhaltigen Leben und einem kostbaren Lächeln, das wir mit allen teilen wollen&rdquo;, heißt es in dem gemeinsamen Statement der Galerien.
