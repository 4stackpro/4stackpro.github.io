In response to the coronavirus pandemic, Instagram added a Stay Home sticker for Instagram Stories. Users can place this sticker on their Stories posts for a chance to have those posts featured in the Stay Home Story that appears at the top of users’ feeds. Here’s how to add the Stay Home sticker to Stories posts.</p>
<p>Note: These screenshots were captured in the Instagram application on iOS.</p>
<p>Step 1: Once you’ve taken or imported a photo or video into Stories, tap the Stickers icon at the top of the screen.</p>
<p>Step 2: Tap the “Stay Home” sticker.</p>
<p>There are two versions of the Stay Home sticker to choose from. One includes the text “Stay Home,” while the other only features the heart icon. Tap the sticker to switch between the two versions.</p>
<p>From there, you can rotate, resize and drag the sticker around the screen to best fit your post before sharing it.

<h3 id="coronavirus-live-updates-economic-picture-darkens-as-detected-infections-approach-one-million">Coronavirus Live Updates: Economic Picture Darkens as Detected Infections Approach One Million</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2020/03/04/corona-virus-social-images/assets/promo.jpg?u=1585828997254" alt="img">
As the virus spreads across the world, reaching into every community, fears in Europe are growing that a major outbreak could erupt in makeshift camps that house thousands of migrants.</p>
<p>The Greek authorities on Thursday quarantined residents of a state facility for refugees after 20 people there tested positive for the coronavirus. Officials conducted tests after a woman at the facility in Ritsona, which hosts around 2,600 people, tested positive for the virus after giving birth at a hospital in Athens.</p>
<p>It was the confirmed coronavirus infection among the tens of thousands of migrants living in camps across Greece. Residents will now be restricted to the area for two weeks while access to health workers will be limited.</p>
<p>Restrictions were imposed last month on migrant camps on the Aegean Islands, notably the Moria facility on Lesbos, which has around 20,000 people, 10 times its intended capacity. Notis Mitarakis, the Greek migration minister, told Greek radio on Thursday that migrants would be segregated in the event of an outbreak.</p>
<p>Migrants on the Greek islands are particularly vulnerable to the spread of the virus, as they live in cramped conditions with little sanitation, and medical charities have called for their evacuation.</p>
<p>Doctors Without Borders said it had divided its tiny clinic in the Moria camp into two sections, one for those suspected of carrying the virus and one for general health needs. The German aid organization Mission Lifeline, which has worked extensively in the camps, has urged the governments of Germany and Greece to allow refugees to be evacuated to Berlin.</p>
<p>Other European nations have introduced measures to extend protections to migrants amid the outbreak. The government in Portugal temporarily extended residency status to migrants and asylum seekers in the country so that they can gain access to state resources and support. Ireland has put digital protections in place to ensure migrants accessing government support will have their status protected.

<h3 id="florida-governor-at-long-last-orders-residents-to-stay-home-to-avoid-coronavirus">Florida Governor, at Long Last, Orders Residents to Stay Home to Avoid Coronavirus</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/01/us/01VIRUS-FLORIDA/01VIRUS-FLORIDA-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
Photos of crowded beaches and megachurches shared on social media over the weekend prompted national outrage directed at Florida, which has blamed its outbreak in part on outsiders. The sheriff in Hillsborough County, which includes Tampa, had a Pentecostal pastor arrested on Monday for recklessly endangering hundreds of parishioners he beckoned to church.</p>
<p>So Mr. DeSantis’s stay-at-home order, even though it lists many exceptions and does not close public beaches, came as a relief to public health officials and hospital administrators who had been clamoring for stronger efforts to keep people home.</p>
<p>“I am very happy to hear this news,” said Dr. Lawrence Antonucci, president and chief executive of the Lee Health hospital system in Fort Myers. “This should help tremendously in slowing the spread of Covid-19 in Florida.”</p>
<p>The coronavirus poses a unique risk for Florida because a quarter of the state’s population of more than 21 million is older than 60, a percentage surpassed only by Maine. The economy relies in large part on an $86 billion-a-year tourism industry fueled by 125 million annual visitors, including young spring break visitors who may have helped spread the virus.</p>
<p>“Obviously in Florida, the tourism is totally shot right now,” Mr. DeSantis said.</p>
<p>The governor has been reluctant to break with Mr. Trump, according to Republican officials, after the president helped him win the Republican primary and then the governorship in 2018. Their close relationship has weighed on the president throughout the federal response to the coronavirus threat: A newly declared Florida resident, Mr. Trump sees the state as vital to his re-election, and he has been responsive to Mr. DeSantis’s requests for such things as drive-through testing sites and protective equipment for health care workers. They have spoken by phone four times in the past week, according to the governor’s public schedule.</p>
<p>As the Trump administration has put a spotlight on the spiraling number of coronavirus cases in New York and New Jersey, Mr. DeSantis has until now tried to frame the state’s outbreak as primarily a problem for Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach.
