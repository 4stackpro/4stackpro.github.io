Alibaba Group Holding Limited BABA is leaving no stone unturned to bolster presence in the retail sector with robust delivery networks.</p>
<p>The company plans to buy at least a 10% stake in a China-based courier firm, Yunda Holding Co Ltd., per reports.</p>
<p>This is likely to strengthen Alibaba’s e-commerce business. Additionally, it will benefit China’s logistic industry and the rapidly growing retail sector.</p>
<p>Express Delivery Industry Growth</p>
<p>Express delivery refers to fast delivery of goods to customers through railway, road or air transport within 24-72 hours.</p>
<p>Express delivery facilities are used by different industries such as electronics and electricals, textile and clothing, automotive and transport, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, financial services and e-commerce, along with individual customers for their personal work.</p>
<p>Per data from the State Post Bureau, China-based delivery firms handled a total of 63 billion parcels in 2019, up 24% year over year, while their revenues grew 23% year over year to 745 billion yuan ($104.95 billion).</p>
<p>Major players operating in the China express delivery market include ZTO Express, YTO Express, Best Inc., STO Express and SF Express.</p>
<p>Buying a stake in Yunda will enable Alibaba to expand share in China&rsquo;s fast-growing express delivery industry. In addition, this will likely help the company in bolstering the ‘New Retail’ strategy that focuses on integration of online e-commerce and offline retail by leveraging the comfort of e-commerce, and advantages of mom &amp; pop shops. This will also improve customer engagement and build an efficient retail ecosystem. Moreover, it will help Alibaba gain momentum in the retail and e-commerce market of China.</p>
<p>Notably, an improved delivery network bodes well for New Retail’s increasing demand for faster delivery and logistics services.</p>

<p>Alibaba Group Holding Limited price-consensus-chart | Alibaba Group Holding Limited Quote</p>
<p>Focus on Logistics</p>
<p>Alibaba is pushing deeper into the logistics sector on account of improvement of delivery services. The anticipated move will reinforce its footprint in the logistics industry.</p>
<p>This will mark the company’s fifth investment in the delivery services sector. Previously, it invested in STO Express, ZTO, YTO Express Group and Best Inc.</p>
<p>All these endeavors will help the company build a more advanced delivery and logistics network to meet the growing demand in the retail and e-commerce sector of China.</p>
<p>According to a report from Forrester, the online retail market in China is anticipated to reach $1.1 trillion in 2019 and $1.8 trillion within 2022, driven by growing mobile use.</p>
<p>This in turn is likely to boost the competitive position of Alibaba against its biggest rival in China, JD.com, which is also spending heavily on logistics.</p>
<p>Zacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to Consider</p>
<p>Currently, Alibaba carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Stamps.com Inc. STMP, eBay Inc. EBAY and Fiverr International Lt. FVRR. While Stamps.com sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), eBay and Fiverr International carry a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</p>
<p>Long-term earnings growth for Stamps.com, eBay and Fiverr International is currently projected at 15%, 11.6% and 44.2%, respectively.</p>

<h3 id="alibaba-baba-expands-in-digital-media-via-yinhekuyu-buyout">Alibaba (BABA) Expands in Digital Media Via Yinhekuyu Buyout</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_eI30vsHKclO8.qzO.OrVg--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MzU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/0b6bda06dbc0865a28035a06baf48e70" alt="img">
Alibaba Group Holding Limited BABA is looking to expand foothold in the digital media and entertainment industry.</p>
<p>In this regard, the company recently announced that its subsidiary, Alibaba Pictures has acquired a majority stake in Yinhekuyu Media for about $57 million (RMB400 million).</p>
<p>Yinhekuyu Media is a producer of video content in China. Its content includes short videos, films and web TV dramas. In 2016, Alibaba’s video-streaming platform Youku had worked with Yinhekuyu to produce a popular entertainment TV show in China, namely Mars Intelligence Agency.</p>
<p>Alibaba Pictures expects the latest acquisition to further enhance its production team. In addition, the deal is expected to enable greater collaboration with other businesses, which include ticketing and promotion unit Tao Piao Piao and Alifish, its derivative products unit.</p>
<p>We believe Alibaba’s latest deal is in line with its strategic focus on digital entertainment. The latest move should expand the company’s user base and help it fend off competition.</p>
<p>In the past year, Alibaba has lost 1.4% compared with the industry’s decline of 6%.</p>
<p>Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price and Consensus</p>

<p>Looking Ahead</p>
<p>The China-based e-commerce giant intends to fortify presence in the digital media and entertainment industry.</p>
<p>Alibaba Pictures, listed in 2016, operates under the Digital Media and Entertainment business. The segment operates businesses through media properties that include UCWeb, YoukuTudou, OTT TV service, Alibaba Music and Alibaba Sports.</p>
<p>In fiscal third-quarter 2020, revenues in Digital Media and Entertainment were RMB7.4 billion (US$1.06 billion), reflecting an increase of 14% on a year-over-year basis. The segment’s top-line growth was driven by consolidation of Alibaba Pictures.</p>
<p>The latest deal is reflective of the China-based Internet giant’s continuous efforts to make a mark in online entertainment, as it seeks to attract more users to its platforms, thereby driving top-line growth.</p>
<p>However, over the past two years, China’s entertainment sector has been facing a lot of issues from new industry regulator, growing content controls, a new tax regime, among others. Moreover, the coronavirus pandemic has resulted in shutdown of production, making the situation all the more worse.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, growing endeavors by Alibaba could help the company battle the situation on the back of new strategies that include partnerships and acquisitions.</p>
<p>Zacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to Consider</p>
<p>Currently, Alibaba has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Stamps.com Inc. STMP, eBay Inc. EBAY and Atlassian Corp. TEAM. While Stamps.com and eBay sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Atlassian carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.</p>
<p>Long-term earnings growth for Stamps.com, Atlassian Corp. and eBay is currently projected at 15%, 22.3% and 11.3%, respectively.</p>
<p>Biggest Tech Breakthrough in a Generation</p>
<p>Be among the early investors in the new type of device that experts say could impact society as much as the discovery of electricity. Current technology will soon be outdated and replaced by these new devices. In the process, it’s expected to create 22 million jobs and generate $12.3 trillion in activity.</p>
<p>A select few stocks could skyrocket the most as rollout accelerates for this new tech. Early investors could see gains similar to buying Microsoft in the 1990s. Zacks’ just-released special report reveals 8 stocks to watch. The report is only available for a limited time.</p>

<h3 id="alibabas-baba-coronavirus-tool-to-combat-fears-in-europe">Alibaba&rsquo;s (BABA) Coronavirus Tool to Combat Fears in Europe</h3>
<p><img src="https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Bp.aEtodhEmnoVhr1rCT6Q--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MzU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/6aeef3c46a6c7ea6b556882abdd6f761" alt="img">
Alibaba Group Holding Limited BABA is making every effort to help society in combatting the coronavirus pandemic on the back of its innovative technologies. The company’s latest move of presenting its cloud-based coronavirus diagnostic tool to the European health systems is a testament to the same.</p>
<p>We note that the tool is a Machine Learning (ML) based software that helps in chest scans. Further, the software was developed at the company’s Damo research center and has been tested successfully in Chinese hospital on 5,000 patients.</p>
<p>Alibaba strives to manage this pandemic situation with this diagnostic tool by accelerating the testing process. The tool is reportedly well-equipped to diagnose COVID-19 quickly with 96% accuracy.</p>
<p>Notably, the company has already offered the underlined tool to the healthcare representatives in France and Italy.</p>
<p>With the latest effort, the company is aiming to reduce the risk of spreading coronavirus further in Europe, which has now become the epicenter of the outbreak.</p>
<p>Moreover, the tool is likely to help the European hospitals and other healthcare centers, which are currently overwhelmed with positive COVID-19 cases and suspects.</p>
<p>We believe the latest effort of Alibaba remains a major positive in this coronavirus-induced global crisis. This is likely to instill investor optimism in the stock.</p>

<p>Alibaba Joins the Pack</p>
<p>Alibaba joins the pack of technology companies including Alphabet GOOGL, Baidu BIDU and Microsoft MSFT, which are taking strong measures to help government and people efficiently manage this pandemic situation.</p>
<p>Notably, Alphabet’s health-care division called Verily has recently launched COVID-19 screening and testing website under Project Baseline.</p>
<p>This particular site offers screening and potential free testing of coronavirus. The website requires users to begin with the eligibility questionnaire. Further, it asks users regarding the person willing to take the test, sign a COVID-19 Public Health authorization form that allows Verily to collect their information required for the screening process.</p>
<p>This is expected to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus. Reportedly, Verily has successfully conducted tests for around 20 people on the very first day of COVID-19 screening.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Baidu has allowed access to its Linearfold algorithm to the scientific and medical teams for the secondary structure prediction of Covid-19 RNA sequence.</p>
<p>Microsoft has unveiled a COVID-19 tracker tool that offers up-to-date infection statistics of each affected country on the tracker. Moreover, the tool provides access to various coronavirus related articles and other information.</p>
<p>We note that competition is intensifying among the tech companies in managing and preventing the society from the virus on the heels of their robust technologies.</p>
<p>Alibaba’s Strong Technical Endeavors</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Alibaba’s growing technology-based initiatives to fight against coronavirus remain noteworthy.</p>
<p>Apart from the latest move, the company’s affiliate Ant Financial recently announced plans to bring third-party vendors on its mobile payment platform called Alipay. It intends to offer retail, food-delivery, hotel bookings and healthcare-related services with the help of these vendors on Alipay.</p>
<p>The plan bodes well for the company under the current challenging scenario as people are going under house arrest, which is leading to increased adoption of apps and Internet-based services.</p>
<p>Additionally, Alibaba successfully encouraged developers to create mini-programs for the third-party vendors, devising 181 of those on Alipay during the coronavirus outbreak. Further, delivery services were introduced recently on Alipay by one of the vendors during this period.</p>
<p>This initiative reflects the company’s customer-centric approach and is likely to create additional values for user during this pandemic situation.</p>
<p>Currently, Alibaba carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.</p>
