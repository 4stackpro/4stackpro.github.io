This daily round-up brings you some of the latest news about the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s most important stories include fears over a second wave of coronavirus in China, some Spanish workers are now heading back to work, and how to prevent a global depression.</p>
<ol>
<li>How COVID-19 is impacting the globe</li>
</ol>
<p>Confirmed deaths caused by the COVID-19 reached 114,800, while worldwide cases climbed above 1.86 million, according to Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>New York City alone has suffered almost 7,000 deaths.</p>
<p>In Africa, Ghana, Burkina Faso and Niger all have around 500 confirmed cases.</p>
<p>The number of confirmed cases is approaching 10,000 in India.</p>
<p>These are the countries with the greatest number of confirmed cases Image: Johns Hopkins</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>How to prevent a global depression</li>
</ol>
<p>The world must make fundamental changes to its economic system, according to the founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum, Professor Klaus Schwab.</p>
<p>To prevent an economic collapse, governments will need to take on large and unprecedented roles in securing business continuity and jobs, he writes.</p>
<p>And the resulting public debt should be carried by the companies and individuals who are most able to do so.</p>
<p>The crucial principle, that everyone will need to subscribe to, is that we’re all in this together for the long haul, and we must all come out of it together, he concludes.</p>
<p>What is the World Economic Forum doing about the coronavirus outbreak? A new strain of Coronavirus, COVID 19, is spreading around the world, causing deaths and major disruption to the global economy. Responding to this crisis requires global cooperation among governments, international organizations and the business community, which is at the centre of the World Economic Forum’s mission as the International Organization for Public-Private Cooperation. The Forum has created the COVID Action Platform, a global platform to convene the business community for collective action, protect people’s livelihoods and facilitate business continuity, and mobilize support for the COVID-19 response. The platform is created with the support of the World Health Organization and is open to all businesses and industry groups, as well as other stakeholders, aiming to integrate and inform joint action. As an organization, the Forum has a track record of supporting efforts to contain epidemics. In 2017, at our Annual Meeting, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) was launched – bringing together experts from government, business, health, academia and civil society to accelerate the development of vaccines. CEPI is currently supporting the race to develop a vaccine against this strand of the coronavirus.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>China&rsquo;s border with Russia in the spotlight</li>
</ol>
<p>China is tackling a resurgence of the Coronavirus epidemic, after new daily infections rose to 108 - the highest number in almost six weeks.</p>
<p>90% of those infected came from abroad, with China&rsquo;s northeastern border with Russia the new frontline.</p>
<p>Having largely stamped out domestic transmission of the disease, some Chinese people are now returning home from abroad.</p>
<p>Towns close to the border crossings in Heilongjiang province are now subject to similar restrictions as in Wuhan during the original outbreak.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Spain and India to restart certain industries</li>
</ol>
<p>Spain is allowing some businesses to resume operations as its death toll continues to fall.</p>
<p>This includes construction and manufacturing where it is impossible to work remotely.</p>
<p>The companies must provide protective equipment and ensure employees are able to stay two metres apart, while security forces will distribute 10 million masks at public transport hubs.</p>
<p>Government sources in India also say the country will restart some crucial manufacturing in order to help the poor cope with the crisis.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Major pork processor shuts down in US</li>
</ol>
<p>Smithfield Foods, the world’s biggest pork processor, is to shut a plant in the US indefinitely after more than 200 of its employees contracted the coronavirus.

<h3 id="coronavirus-13-april-at-a-glance">Coronavirus: 13 April at a glance</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e19f90bb7fe43a0b2e60e805057cdcd7d0aeeb79/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200&amp;height=630&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&amp;overlay-width=100p&amp;overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&amp;enable=upscale&amp;s=8e56cab1121875deb3c60f4636bf1d3c" alt="img">
Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:</p>
<p>Global cases pass 1.85m</p>
<p>The number of confirmed cases worldwide has topped 1.85m, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. There have been more than 114,000 deaths globally. The US has the most confirmed cases at more than 557,000, with 22,108 deaths. In the UK, there are more than 85,000 cases and more than 10,600 deaths.</p>
<p>China reports highest daily infections in five weeks</p>
<p>Mainland China reported 108 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, up from 99 a day earlier and 46 reported on Friday. Chinese authorities are increasing restrictions and monitoring in the northern regions bordering Russia, after a rise in people with Covid-19 crossing the border.</p>
<p>France expected to continue lockdown for several weeks</p>
<p>French president Emmanuel Macron is expected to warn on Monday that the country’s lockdown will continue for several more weeks at least. On Sunday, France reported a lower number of Covid-19 fatalities over the past 24 hours, with 315 deaths in hospital over the past day, compared with 345 the previous day.</p>
<p>Spain readying to reopen parts of economy</p>
<p>Some companies are set to resume operations at the end of a two-week halt of all non-essential activity. Spain’s death toll has fallen over recent days, but as a small bump in deaths was reported on Sunday, the prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, warned said: “We are all keen to go back out on the streets &hellip; but our desire is even greater to win the war and prevent a relapse.”</p>
<p>Germany has third day of lower cases</p>
<p>Germany’s number of confirmed coronavirus infections has risen by 2,537 to 123,016. That was lower than a 2,821 increase reported on Sunday and marked the third decline after four days of increases.</p>
<p>Top oil-producing countries agree to ‘historic’ output cuts</p>
<p>The move comes in response to the coronavirus crisis and a Russia-Saudi price war, and with hopes to boost plummeting oil prices. The agreement between the Vienna-based Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and partners foresees deep output cuts in May and June followed by a gradual reduction in cuts until April 2022.</p>
<p>Judge rules Alabama cannot block abortions during coronavirus crisis</p>
<p>The ruling came after efforts in Texas, Ohio, Alabama and other US states to prohibit abortion services during the Covid-19 outbreak. States have argued they need to conserve medical equipment and potential hospital beds during the pandemic and that abortions are elective medical procedures.
