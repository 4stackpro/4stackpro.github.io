Tributes are being paid following the death of Norah Gibbons, the first Chair of the Child and Family Agency Tusla who advocated children&rsquo;s rights throughout her career.</p>
<p>In a statement, Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said Ms Gibbons has left behind a tremendous legacy, in particular for the children of Ireland.</p>
<p>He noted that she made a major contribution in her work as a member of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and other bodies addressing historic child abuse.</p>
<p>Ms Gibbons also chaired the Roscommon Child Abuse Inquiry, co-chaired the Independent Child Death Review and from 2014 to 2018 she served as the first Chair of Tusla.</p>
<p>In 2019, she was appointed by the Minister for Justice and Equality to lead the independent study on familicide and domestic homicide.</p>
<p>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs Katherine Zappone described Norah Gibbons as passionate and indefatigable in her service to children and the State.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her establishment and leadership of Tusla placed children and families at the centre of Irish law, policy and public service&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On Twitter, the Chief Executive of the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance Tanya Ward said Ireland had lost one of the most dedicated children&rsquo;s rights campaigners.</p>
<p>Few people, she said, share Ms Gibbon&rsquo;s track record in changing children&rsquo;s lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robust, compassionate and generous to the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Norah Gibbons is survived by her husband Sean, son Miles and daughter Maireas.

<h3 id="president-leads-tributes-to-childrens-rights-advocate-norah-gibbons">President leads tributes to children’s rights advocate Norah Gibbons</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4224912.1586457666!/image/image.jpg" alt="img">
President Michael D Higgins has led tribute to children’s rights advocate Norah Gibbons, who has died.</p>
<p>Ms Gibbons, who was a qualified social worker, was the founding chairwoman of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, from 2014 to 2018 and also director of advocacy at Barnardos from 2005 to 2012. She died at her home on Wednesday after having suffered from cancer.</p>
<p>Born in 1952, she had also been a member of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, chaired the Roscommon Child Abuse Inquiry and co-chaired the Independent Child Death Review group.</p>
<p>The President said Ms Gibbons was “an inspirational figure and a powerful voice” who championed the advancement of children’s rights in Ireland.</p>
<p>“Driven by a profound sense of social justice and empathy, Norah Gibbons has left an enormous legacy, not only for the children of Ireland but for all those who cherish the values of equality that underpin our republic and democracy,” he said.</p>
<p>“Sabina and I express our deepest condolences to her family, friends and former colleagues.”</p>
<p>Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan described her as “an exceptional woman who brought her innate judgement, common sense and humanity to everything she did”.</p>
<p>“She leaves behind a tremendous legacy, in particular for the children of Ireland,” he said.</p>
<p>“During her final illness, Norah continued to work to help others, through her leadership of the independent study on familicide and domestic homicide. It was typical of her resolute sense of purpose that, in recent weeks, she was keen to ensure that this important work would be completed and I was glad to be able to give her that assurance.</p>
<p>“All through her life, she was a passionate and tireless advocate for children and others in vulnerable situations.”</p>
<p>‘Indefatigable’</p>
<p>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs Katherine Zappone said Ms Gibbons was “passionate and indefatigable” in her service to children and the State.</p>
<p>“I worked closely with her when she chaired Tusla and I admired her determination and focus on establishing our first dedicated agency for children and families,” she said.</p>
<p>“Her establishment and leadership of Tusla placed children and families at the centre of Irish law, policy and public service.”</p>
<p>In a statement, Tusla said Ms Gibbons was “a tireless advocate for the rights of children, who inspired so many around her”.</p>
<p>“Today we remember Norah Gibbons for her long and outstanding contribution to public life on many important issues, including tirelessly advocating for vulnerable children, young people and the most vulnerable in our society,” Tusla’s chief executive Bernard Gloster said.</p>
<p>Suzanne Connolly, chief executive of Barnardos, said Ms Gibbons joined Barnardos during the 1990s as a social worker before serving as director of advocacy for the children’s charity.</p>
<p>“Her energy, commitment and passion for the rights of children in Ireland changed many children’s lives for the better, and she will be remembered by many,” Ms Connolly said.</p>
<p>Ms Gibbons also served as both a director and chair of Alcohol Action Ireland. The organisation said “her outstanding contribution to Irish public life, her passion to tackle inequality and commitment to improving the lives of so many will be long remembered”.</p>
<p>Women’s Aid Ireland described Ms Gibbons as “an inspiring woman, so dedicated to social justice and the care, protection and prevention of cruelty toward the most vulnerable”.</p>
<p>Ms Gibbons is survived by her husband Seán, son Miles and daughter Maireas.

<h3 id="tributes-as-fearless-former-tusla-chair-gibbons-loses-cancer-battle">Tributes as &lsquo;fearless&rsquo; former Tusla chair Gibbons loses cancer battle</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/a8598/39118111.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/2019-06-15_iri_51138366_I1.JPG" alt="img">
Widespread tributes have been paid to Norah Gibbons, the first chairperson of Tusla, following her death after a battle with cancer.</p>
<p>Originally a social worker, she would go on to play a key role in a number of inquiries into child abuse and the deaths of children in care.</p>
<p>She was widely regarded as a fearless champion of the rights of children and families.</p>
<p>Her close friend, Adoption Authority chairman Dr Geoffrey Shannon, described her as &ldquo;a national treasure&rdquo; who had left &ldquo;a very significant legacy in the area of child protection&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance chief executive Tanya Ward said she had been one of Ireland&rsquo;s greatest champions of children&rsquo;s rights and social justice.</p>
<p>In a message on social media, her family said she died peacefully at her home on Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>She is survived by her husband Seán and their two children, Myles and Mairéas.</p>
<p>Born Norah Cassidy in 1952 and originally from Boyle, Co Roscommon, Ms Gibbons lived between Clifden, Co Galway, and Clontarf in Dublin.</p>
<p>She graduated with a HDip in Education from NUI Galway in the 1970s and later obtained a masters degree in health and care services from the University of Wales in Cardiff.</p>
<p>Ms Gibbons worked for many years in social work in the UK and Ireland. She joined children&rsquo;s charity Barnardos in the 1990s as a social worker and progressed to a senior management role. Between 2005 and 2012, she was the charity&rsquo;s director of advocacy.</p>
<p>From 2000 to 2009, she was a member of the Ryan Commission, whose report detailed widespread sexual abuse and neglect in institutions for children over several decades.</p>
<p>Ms Gibbons chaired the Roscommon Child Abuse Inquiry from 2009 to 2010, and was involved with Dr Shannon in an independent review of child deaths in 2011 and 2012.</p>
<p>From 2014 to 2018, she served as the first chairperson of Tusla, the child and family agency. She also chaired a Stormont investigation into mother and baby homes and Magdalene laundries, but resigned due to ill health.</p>
<p>More recently, she was appointed by Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan to lead an independent study on familicide and domestic homicide.</p>
<p>Paying tribute to her, Mr Flanagan said: &ldquo;It was typical of her resolute sense of purpose that, in recent weeks, she was keen to ensure that this important work would be completed and I was glad to be able to give her that assurance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Norah was an exceptional woman who brought her innate judgment, common sense and humanity to everything she did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MEP Frances Fitzgerald, the former minister for children who appointed Ms Gibbons chairperson of Tusla, spoke to her by phone in recent days and said she was &ldquo;a fighter&rdquo; who would be sadly missed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t bow to authority. She spoke out. She was fearless really,&rdquo; the former minister told the Irish Independent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was very formidable, but also pragmatic and values oriented. She knew what was the right thing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms Fitzgerald said Ms Gibbons had &ldquo;a very wide lens on Irish society&rdquo;, and was committed to righting wrongs, be they in the areas of adoption, historical abuse or vulnerable children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would have had a huge passion for dealing with all of that and was utterly committed to it,&rdquo; said Ms Fitzgerald.</p>
<p>Dr Shannon, who worked with Ms Gibbons on a review into the deaths of 196 children in care, described her as &ldquo;one of the country&rsquo;s most articulate advocates on the children&rsquo;s rights issue&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He said the phrase &ldquo;national treasure&rdquo; was sometimes used inappropriately, but in Ms Gibbons&rsquo;s case it was entirely appropriate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were meeting the most vulnerable citizens in society. Norah had this unique ability to put citizens who are in very difficult times at ease,&rdquo; said Dr Shannon.</p>
<p>In accordance with Government and HSE guidelines and in the interest of public health, a private funeral will take place, followed by cremation.</p>
<p>A memorial service will be held at a later date to celebrate her life.</p>
