An image has been making its way around social media showing an SABC news bulletin which says that liquor stores will be allowed to open at certain times. The South African Police Services has warned citizens that this photo is doctored and is fake news.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSocial media users are warned against circulating further this doctored television screenshot as doing so could lead to criminal charges,‚Äù SAPS said in a social media post.</p>
<p>The image, which is an edited photo from one of the press briefings by Minister of Police Bheki Cele, appears to say that liquor stores will be allowed to trade during certain times and these will be announced on April 13 at 8pm. However this is not true, as the alcohol ban and closure of liquor stores and shebeens is still in place.</p>

<p>Alongside the concern around deaths and number of COVID-19 cases, South Africa has been facing an unprecedented spread in fake news and rise in looting of alcohol stores.</p>
<p>The closure of liquor stores has been a particular problem, with citizens looting stores to access alcohol as the lockdown continues. According to Business Tech, 16 liquor stores have been looted in the Western Cape alone since the beginning of the lockdown.</p>
<p>Liquor associations, such as the The Beer Association of South Africa (BASA), have called for off-consumption sales to resume, especially since the lockdown has been extended for a further two weeks.</p>

<h3 id="lockdown-extension-with-lockdown-extended-till-may-3-heres-when-liquor-shops-may-reopen">Lockdown Extension: With lockdown extended till May 3, here&rsquo;s when liquor shops may reopen</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.jagranimages.com/images/2020/apr/liquor1586758264863.jpg" alt="img">
New Delhi | Jagran News Desk: The 21-day nationwide lockdown in India has been extended till May 3 with strict restrictions in place till April 20. This means that a decision on easing restrictions will be taken after a week, only in places which do not have a COVID-19 hotspot.</p>
<p>After meeting with all the Chief Ministers on Saturday to modulate country‚Äôs progress in containing the spread of coronavirus pandemic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had indicated that the lockdown will be extended ‚Äì but there will be relaxations in certain areas to ensure the basic sustenance of India‚Äôs economy as well.</p>
<p>Officials privy to the discussions during the four-hour-long conference with chief ministers, convened by PM Narendra Modi, said that schools and colleges would remain shut but some small scale industries and liquor shops may be allowed to function.</p>
<p>Liquor shops are likely to be allowed to open as many chief ministers strongly pitched for it arguing that it is a major revenue generating way for the states, the sources said, adding restaurants and malls won&rsquo;t open.</p>
<p>What do we know so far</p>
<p>Liquor shops in Assam and Meghalaya have reopened on Monday amid the lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. In Assam, an Excise department‚Äôs order said that liquor shops, wholesale warehouses, bottling plants, distilleries and breweries will open from Monday for seven hours daily.</p>
<p>In neighboring Meghalaya, liquor shops and warehouses will remain open from 9 am to 4 pm, NDTV reported.</p>
<p>Assam has reported 29 cases of coronavirus infection and one death, whereas Meghalaya hasn‚Äôt recorded any COVID-19 case so-far.</p>
<p>Haryana‚Äôs Excise Department Commissioner wrote to his subordinates in all the districts to ‚Äúresume the operations of Distilleries, Bottling plants, Breweries, Wineries with immediate effect.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis maybe treated as a step in the direction of full scale operations of wholesale and retail licenses after the lockdown period is over,‚Äù the letter stated.</p>
<p>Kerala was the first state, which despite the rising COVID-19 cases, had sought to ease alcohol availability during the lockdown. A decision to home-deliver alcohol prescribed by doctors, announced state‚Äôs Excise department, was later slammed by Kerala High Court and hence struck down, earlier in the April.</p>
<p>Where will the liquor shops open?</p>
<p>There are almost 400 districts in the country, which haven‚Äôt recorded any COVID-19 case so far. If the Centre announces some relaxation in restrictions and resumption of services in some sectors, including Excise, it is possible that the liquor shops might open in some states.</p>

<h3 id="liquor-shops-could-open-after-april-14-in-karnataka">Liquor shops could open after April 14 in Karnataka</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.deccanherald.com/sites/dh/files/article_images/2020/04/14/file7a4rc1h9bir144zls78b-1586810751.jpg" alt="img">
The state government on Monday hinted at allowing sale of liquor after April 14, with the excise department floating the idea of allowing sales at MSIL and CL-2 licensed outlets.</p>
<p>Chief Minister Yediyurappa said discussions were underway on the issue, while authorities gave indications that some stores may open during the second phase of the lockdown starting April 15. ‚ÄúWe will decide after April 14,‚Äù Yediyurappa told reporters.</p>
<p>For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here</p>
<p>Sources said that several Cabinet members were keen on allowing restricted sale of liquor and an order to that effect was likely to be issued on Tuesday, pending guidelines by the Centre.</p>
<p>However, the move was opposed by Water Resources Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi.</p>
<p>During the day, reports of barricades being put in front of MSIL outlets emerged from parts of the state, a hint that supply of liquor at select outlets could resume.</p>
<p>While welcoming the government‚Äôs decision, Federation of Wine Merchants Association, Karnataka, wanted sale of liquor to be allowed only for a certain period of time every day in the state.</p>
<p>There are 789 MSIL shops in Karnataka.
