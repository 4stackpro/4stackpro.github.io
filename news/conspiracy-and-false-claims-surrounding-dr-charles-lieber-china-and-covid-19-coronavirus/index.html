Advertisement Conspiracy and false claims surrounding Dr. Charles Lieber, China and COVID-19 coronavirus Fact-checking the Harvard researcher and misleading claims about WCVB story Share Shares Copy Link Copy</p>
<p>Stories and information can spread like wildfire on social media &ndash; go viral &ndash; especially false information.WCVB is experiencing that phenomenon first-hand as we find one of our stories in the middle of a growing COVID-19 conspiracy online – a story that has been taken out of context and stamped with inaccurate and misleading headlines.Thousands of social media posts and several YouTube videos are spreading false claims that an American researcher who worked at Harvard University was involved in developing the novel coronavirus. In the attempt to legitimize those claims, the posts are pointing to a WCVB story from January. But the claims are not true, and the story never made any of them.Some of the false claims have been translated into multiple languages and are circulating around the world.Here are the facts about the story and what we know about the investigation into Dr. Charles Lieber:Harvard Department Chairman Arrested“The complaint alleges that Dr. Lieber signed a contract with the Chinese University in Wuhan.”Those words were spoken by Andrew Lelling, U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, on Jan. 28. They are now being used to fuel the conspiracy and misconceptions.Lelling was speaking at a news conference regarding the arrest of Dr. Lieber, the chairman of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University.Dr. Lieber, of Lexington, Mass., is charged with “Making false statements to the agency of the United States Government,” or lying to federal authorities about his ties to China. According to court documents, Dr. Lieber was the Principal Investigator of the Lieber Research Group at Harvard University. Since 2008, the group had received more than $15 million in grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense.However, prosecutors allege that on applications with the NIH and DoD, Dr. Lieber did not disclose that he was being paid a salary of up to $50,000 per month and up to $158,000 per year in living expenses by China&rsquo;s Thousand Talents Plan and the Wuhan University of Technology. The complaint alleges that Dr. Lieber worked with the University for significant periods between at least 2012 and 2017.Federal investigators also determined that Dr. Lieber was awarded more than $1.5 million to establish a nanotechnology research lab at WUT.&ldquo;China&rsquo;s Thousand Talents Plan, according to the complaint (is) a Chinese government-run program designed to entice scientists and researchers in the United States to share their research expertise with China,&rdquo; Lelling said at that news conference.According to the criminal complaint, “On April 24, 2018, DoD investigators interviewed Dr. Lieber about his active grants and whether Dr. Lieber had appropriately disclosed foreign research collaboration to DoD. During the interview … Dr. Lieber said that he was familiar with China&rsquo;s Thousand Talent&rsquo;s Plan, but that he had never been asked to participate in the program.”Prosecutors allege that Dr. Lieber also lied to Harvard about his foreign ties, which “caused Harvard to tell NIH that Dr. Lieber ‘is not and has never been a participant in’ China&rsquo;s Thousand Talents Plan.” Prosecutors and investigators did not allege at any point that Dr. Lieber engineered any virus, and they never tied him in any way to COVID-19.Further, many of the false headlines and misleading social media posts are suggesting that Dr. Lieber was “just arrested” or “arrested today.” Dr. Lieber was arrested and arraigned in federal court on Jan. 28, 2020.Read the full federal complaint here.False Claims and The FactsClaim: “America just discovered the man who manufactured and sold the #Coronavirus to China”Response: This claim is false. Prosecutors have never alleged that Dr. Lieber was involved in manufacturing and/or selling a virus to China. Dr. Lieber was also arrested on Jan. 28, 2020. Read the full federal court complaint.Claim: “What was he doing in ‘Wuhan’ the city where #coronavirus outbreak started?”Response: This claim is misleading. According to federal prosecutors, Dr. Lieber was in Wuhan years before it became the center of the coronavirus outbreak. “Lieber traveled to WUT (Wuhan University of Technology) in mid-November 2011 ostensibly in order to participate in a Nano-Energy Materials Forum.” “Lieber returned to Massachusetts from WUT on or about November 16, 2011.” Prosecutors do not detail any further travel to Wuhan by Dr. Lieber.Claim: “USA says man who manufactured and sold the coronavirus to #China…was just arrested today” (Tweet on April 4)Response: This claim is inaccurate. Dr. Lieber was arrested on Jan. 28, 2020, more than two months before the tweet was sent.Claim: “Charles Lieber @Harvard Univ. who was arrested on Friday along with 2 Chinese Communist Int’l for manufacturing viruses since 2000 to sell to China.” (Tweet on April 6)Response: This claim is inaccurate and misleading. Dr. Lieber was arrested on Jan. 28, 2020. Federal prosecutors have not alleged in any way that Dr. Lieber manufactured or sold viruses to China. According to court documents, Dr. Lieber’s interactions with China did not begin until 2011. Read the federal court complaint. The arrests of two other people in Massachusetts were announced at the same time in separate cases related to China, however prosecutors do not allege they had anything to do with the novel coronavirus.READ: Yanqing Ye criminal complaint | Zaosong Zheng criminal complaintHelpful Links and Information:•Federal Court Complaint: United States of America v.

<h3 id="covid-19-who-is-charles-lieber-the-man-conspiracy-theorists-say-created-the-coronavirus">Covid-19: Who is Charles Lieber, the man conspiracy theorists say created the coronavirus?</h3>
<p><img src="https://as01.epimg.net/en/imagenes/2020/04/05/other_sports/1586117681_997630_1586167020_noticia_normal.jpg" alt="img">
The coronavirus pandemic has, inevitably, brought with it a range of conspiracy theories about its origin - one of which claims that it is man-made and an American scientist recently arrested over his links to China helped create it.</p>
<p>Arrest of Harvard professor sparks internet gossip</p>
<p>In January, Harvard professor Charles Lieber was charged with lying to US federal authorities about payments he allegedly received from Wuhan University of Technology and concealing his participation in China’s Thousand Talents Plan, a state-run programme that recruits elite scientific talent.</p>
<p>Given that the coronavirus first appeared in Wuhan, however, Lieber’s apparent connections to the Chinese city quickly sparked internet rumours that he had in fact been arrested on suspicion of playing a part in manufacturing the virus.</p>
<p>This kind of speculation was only encouraged by Arkansas senator Tom Cotton, who said on Fox News in February that the question of whether the coronavirus came about in China by artificial means was one “we at least have to ask”.</p>
<p>Chinese nationals&rsquo; arrest adds to Lieber rumours</p>
<p>The online gossip surrounding Lieber was further fuelled by the fact that his detention by US law enforcement was announced alongside that of two Chinese nationals, one of whom was described in a Facebook user&rsquo;s viral post as having been caught smuggling vials of “sensitive biological samples” back to China.</p>
<p>Lieber-was-behind-coronavirus claims debunked</p>
<p>But in an article that comprehensively debunks the idea that Lieber was apprehended for reasons relating to Covid-19, the fact-checking website Snopes.com clarifies that there is no connection between the arrests.</p>
<p>“The DOJ [Department of Justice] announced three separate arrests in January 2020,” Snopes says. “The first was Lieber. The second involved Yanqing Ye, a lieutenant in the Chinese army accused of stealing U.S. research. And third was Zaosong Zheng, who stole 21 vials of biological research. While these three arrests all involve people lying about their ties to China, they took place at different universities and are not related.”</p>
<p>Quoting the New York Times, moreover, Snopes reveals that the contents of these vials had nothing to do with the coronavirus, but were in fact cancer cells.</p>
<p>Experts insist coronavirus not of artificial origin</p>
<p>Prompted by false rumours such as those circulating about Lieber, experts have been swift to emphatically reject the notion that the coronavirus could be man-made. In a joint statement published in the medical journal Lancet in February, a group of 27 scientists said: “We stand together to strongly condemn conspiracy theories suggesting that COVID-19 does not have a natural origin.</p>
<p>“Scientists from multiple countries have published and analysed genomes of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and they overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife”.</p>
<p>They added: “Conspiracy theories do nothing but create fear, rumours, and prejudice that jeopardise our global collaboration in the fight against this virus.“</p>

<h3 id="was-charles-lieber-really-recruited-by-china-for-coronavirus-research">Was Charles Lieber really recruited by China for coronavirus research?</h3>

<p>A video clip is creating buzz in the social media, claiming a professor of Harvard University has been arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for collaborating with China in creating coronavirus. But this newspaper has independently investigated the matter and found the rumor was spread by India Today, an Indian news journal, which has extreme intimacy with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).</p>
<p>According to an India Today report, a message with a video clip is circulating on Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp claiming that the US authorities have arrested Dr. Charles Lieber, a Harvard professor, for ‘creating coronavirus and selling it to China’.</p>
<p>Facebook users like ‘Alex Alvarez’ and ‘Meera Singh’ have posted the video – a clipping of US news channel ‘WCVB’ – with the caption, ‘USA just discovered the man who manufactured and sold the #coronavirus to #China. Dr #CharlesLieber, head of the chemistry and biology department at #HarvardUniversity, USA. He was just arrested today according to American department sources’.</p>
<p>The claim has gone viral on Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>In January, Harvard professor Charles Lieber was charged with lying to US federal authorities about payments he allegedly received from Wuhan University of Technology and concealing his participation in China’s Thousand Talents Plan, a state-run program that recruits elite scientific talent.</p>
<p>Given that the coronavirus first appeared in Wuhan, however, Lieber’s apparent connections to the Chinese city quickly sparked internet rumors that he had in fact been arrested on suspicion of playing a part in manufacturing the virus.</p>
<p>In a statement, the state-backed Wuhan Institute of Virology said “internet rumors” had “received close attention from all walks of life” and “caused great harm to our research staff on the front line of scientific research”.</p>
<p>It said its staff had been working around the clock since the end of 2019 to trace the source of the coronavirus and improve detection rates, but the conspiracies had “seriously interfered” with their efforts.</p>
<p>The institute has been accused of “artificially synthesizing” the coronavirus in one of its laboratories, it said. It also referred to other claims circulating online that the “patient zero” in the current outbreak was a graduate student from the institute, and that one of its researchers had also died after the virus “leaked”.</p>
<p>Conspiracy theories often prosper during epidemics, and have sprung up during recent outbreaks of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), avian flu and Ebola, said Adam Kamradt-Scott, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Sydney.</p>
<p>“If there is an infectious disease lab in a city where an outbreak starts, it usually gets the blame.”</p>
<p>Many of the rumors circulated domestically and overseas claim the coronavirus was engineered by local scientists and leaked, deliberately or by accident, in Wuhan where the virus was first detected and is the epicenter of the epidemic.</p>
<p>A team of 27 scientists published a statement in the Lancet medical journal condemning the conspiracy theories, which “do nothing but create fear, rumors and prejudice that jeopardize our global collaboration in the fight against this virus.”</p>
<p>They said scientists from around the world “overwhelmingly conclude that this coronavirus originated in wildlife”. The current consensus is that it emerged from a seafood market in Wuhan that also sold exotic wild animal products.</p>
<p>China usually cracks down heavily on “rumors”, and it even arrested Li Wenliang, a doctor who first disclosed the existence of a SARS-like disease in Wuhan at the end of last year and subsequently became its most prominent casualty.</p>
<p>But it has been unable to silence the vast number of outlandish claims circulating on social media channels.</p>
<p>Shanghai government newspaper Liberation Daily had published a regular round-up of misinformation, including allegations that large numbers of infected patients are coming to the city for treatment, and a claim the virus can be cured by strong curry.</p>
<p>A video is making a lot of buzz which claims that the US has found the man who made and sold coronavirus to China. Doctor Charles Lieber, a Harvard professor, was blamed in the video for sending the coronavirus which has become humanity’s greatest tragedy since the second world war.</p>
<p>However, it turns out, that the video is fake and old and BLiTz confirmed the video’s veracity was before on January 29.</p>
<p>Lieber is a nanoscientist, who develops small or nanomaterials. He heads Harvard University’s Chemistry and Biology department and has been affiliated with the university since 1991.</p>
<p>The doctor was arrested, but not on April 5 as claimed in the video but this January.</p>
<p>He has been charged not for coronavirus, but for aiding China in a case of financial conflict of interest.</p>
<p>In China, there is an assistance program called “Thousand Talent Plans” for aiding foreign experts, who bring knowledge to the country.</p>
<p>Reportedly, the program also rewards individuals who steal proprietary information.</p>
<p>The complaint against Lieber says that he lied to Harvard and the government about his involvement with the Talents Plan. It says that Lieber was associated with the program from at least 2012 to 2017. His contract included a salary as high as $5000 a month, living expenses of nearly $150,000 per year and another $1.5 million for the establishment of a lab at the Wuhan Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>It may be mentioned here that, India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has been making frantic bids in putting the accusation on China for spreading Coronavirus, clearly with the agenda of putting Beijing on odds as well as sabotaging President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a brainchild of the Chinese leader, which will connect Asian nations with Europe, Africa and beyond. India considers BRI as a threat to its ambition of emerging as regional superpower.
