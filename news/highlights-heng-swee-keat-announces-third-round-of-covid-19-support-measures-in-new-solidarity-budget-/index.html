SINGAPORE: Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat announced on Monday (Apr 6) a third round of support measures to help tide businesses, workers and households through the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>The new &ldquo;Solidarity Budget&rdquo; follows the Unity Budget announced on Feb 18 and the Resilience Budget of Mar 26, and comes amid what Mr Heng described as &ldquo;a generational crisis with no precedent&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have brought all our resources and administrative capacity to bear, to mount a national effort for our workers, businesses and families - to protect both lives and livelihoods,&rdquo; said Mr Heng.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have the plans, and the financial resources to carry out these plans without burdening future generations with the bill. We are grateful to our founding generation for their foresight and discipline. The key now is in how we pull together, in solidarity, as a nation to implement these plans and make adjustments as the situation continues to evolve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His speech was carried live on CNA&rsquo;s Facebook page and YouTube channel, and on television.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong gave an update on the COVID-19 situation in an address to the nation on Friday (Apr 3), in which he announced significantly stricter measures in what he termed as a &ldquo;decisive move&rdquo; to pre-empt escalating infections.</p>
<p>This is the third time Mr Lee has spoken to the nation on the COVID-19 situation.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>On Mar 12, he sought to reassure the public that the situation in Singapore remained under control, and set out various measures that might need to be implemented going forward.</p>
<p>Noting the increase in number of daily new COVID-19 cases, as well as local transmissions and clusters, Mr Lee said that the stricter measures will work as a circuit breaker and be in place for one month to help reduce the risk of a big outbreak and gradually bring Singapore&rsquo;s numbers down.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>From next Tuesday (Apr 7) until May 4, most workplaces - except for essential services and key economic sectors - will be closed.</p>
<p>Food establishments, markets and supermarkets, clinics, hospitals, utilities, transport and key banking services will remain open, as will their supply chains.</p>
<p>In a separate release, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said that all restaurants, hawker centres, coffeeshops, food courts and other food and beverage outlets will remain open only for takeaway or delivery.</p>
<p>From next Wednesday, schools and institutes of higher learning will also be closed and move fully to home-based learning. All pre-school and student care centres will also be closed, but will provide limited services for children of parents who have to continue working and are unable to make alternative care arrangements.</p>
<p>Classes will resume on May 5.</p>
<p>There will also be restrictions on movements and gatherings of people. As far as possible, individuals should remain at home and avoid visiting even their extended families, particularly the elderly, said Mr Lee.</p>
<p>Individuals should only leave their homes if they work in essential services or key economic sectors, or to buy food or exercise in neighbourhood parks, he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The spirit of these measures is to get all of us to minimise physical contact. If we don’t go out, if we avoid contact with others, then the virus will not be able to spread. It is as simple as that,&rdquo; said Mr Lee.</p>
<p>Here are some key points from Mr Lee&rsquo;s address, as well as the live press conference by the multi-ministry task force tackling COVID-19, on Friday:</p>
<p>In a Facebook post earlier on Friday, Mr Lee said that the current COVID-19 situation in Singapore had been “under control” so far, but the Government wanted to “take a few more steps”.</p>
<p>“Since COVID-19, we have responded to the crisis calmly and systematically, planning ahead and adjusting our measures as the situation changed,” he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me reassure Singaporeans that our food supply is secure and adequate. Buy just what you need, and share any extra you have with those who need it. Let’s stay calm and united during this challenging period,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>A total of 1,114 people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in Singapore as of Friday.</p>
<p>On Friday, the country reported its fifth death related to the disease, an 86-year-old Singaporean woman who was a resident of the Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home, one of the COVID-19 clusters.</p>
<p>Following the announcement of the cluster, MOH and the Agency for Integrated Care said no visitors would be allowed at all nursing homes in Singapore for the month of April.</p>
<p>Caregivers will be given alternative ways to interact with nursing home residents, such as telephone and video calls, the authorities said.</p>

<h3 id="covid-19-couples-due-to-get-married-postpone-weddings-livestream-small-celebrations">COVID-19: Couples due to get married postpone weddings, livestream small celebrations</h3>
<p><img src="https://cna-sg-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto/image/12595222/16x9/991/557/d685e0f4a99d54b517b8e219c820e8ce/FD/kenneth-and-wife.jpg" alt="img">
SINGAPORE: Ms Seow was supposed to get married on May 2, in a small ceremony probably at home. That was a step-down from the originally planned church wedding with 500 guests.</p>
<p>However, even that is now up in the air, after the Government last week announced stricter safe-distancing measures, with most workplaces shut down from Apr 7 to May 4.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Ms Seow said she was informed by the Registry of Marriages a day after the announcement that her solemnisation would have to be put on hold.</p>
<p>With no guarantee that the measures, meant to slow down local transmission, will not be extended, her marital status hangs in limbo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are disappointed, but we understand that what the Government is doing is for the good,&rdquo; said Ms Seow, who asked that her full name not be used.</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Others, like Ms Nur Izzati Anwar, managed to hold their weddings before the stricter measures were introduced. However, plans have had to be radically altered.</p>
<p>When the Ministry of Health released an advisory in early March that social events and gatherings including weddings should not have more than 250 guests, bride-to-be Ms Izzati tried to cancel a hotel dinner reception that was meant to have 1,000 guests.</p>
<p>However, she was only allowed to postpone it.</p>
<p>When the advisory became stricter with an advisory on Mar 24 restricting the maximum number of guests at a gathering to 10, Ms Izzati and her partner realised that their plans were going to have to be changed.</p>
<p>With her solemnisation and lunch and dinner reception events fixed for Apr 4, she and her partner decided to make a difficult decision - to bring forward their solemnisation with just a few people present.</p>
<p>“Everybody was quite sad, but we wanted to bring it forward because it seemed like anything could happen in one week,” said the 28-year-old therapist.</p>
<p>There were only nine present at the small ceremony held at her now husband’s home, including their parents and a witness.</p>
<p>Also present was her friend, who used Facebook and Instagram to stream the ceremony live to family and friends who could only watch from afar.</p>
<p>She hopes to be able to continue with her hotel reception events when the conditions allow.</p>
<p>“We want to do something for our families still,” she said.</p>
<p>PROFESSIONAL LIVESTREAMING SERVICES</p>
<p>While Ms Izzati roped in a friend to provide the livestreaming services, the industry has also been stepping up to provide alternative services for couples who want to go ahead with some kind of celebration amid the strict measures in place to help stop the spread of COVID-19. Wedding photographer Kanthan Jay introduced a professional livestreaming package.</p>
<p>Armed with a two-camera set-up, and an encoding machine for better connection, Mr Kanthan and his partner held their first such livestream from a Hindu temple last month.</p>
<p>The couple opted for the service as the family of the bride, who is Malaysian, could not make it for the wedding due to travel restrictions between Malaysia and Singapore.</p>
<p>The bride’s parents had no objection to them carrying on with the wedding as planned, but because she did not want them to miss the event entirely, they wanted the service, he said.</p>
<p>“I told them it was going to be like a one-take wonder, and there was no time for blunders,” Mr Kanthan said.</p>
<p>Mr Kanthan said the challenge was making sure that the livestream was uninterrupted. Something different from normal was that the ceremony ended within an hour and a half, as so few people were there. Typically, guests queue up to take photographs with the couple and congratulate them, which would take an additional two to three hours, he said.</p>
<p>ENSURING STRICT PRECAUTIONS, DOWNSIZING</p>
<p>Another temple wedding that was livestreamed, but with a mobile phone, was Ms Vidhya Nair’s. While hers was held before the 10-person maximum advisory was released, she and her husband went to great lengths to drastically reduce the number of guests.</p>
<p>“We didn’t want to be another cluster. We had already thought of what the hashtag would look like if that happened,” she said.</p>
<p>Mr Kenneth Chew and his partner got married on Mar 29, after downsizing their wedding to adhere to the advisory on having a gathering of up to 10 people.</p>
<p>Their lunch reception at a restaurant was to have more than 170 guests, but then, after the venue did not have a solution for him for a smaller event, Mr Chew moved quickly to book a condominium function room for his solemnisation and tea ceremonies.</p>
<p>Present were just the bride’s and groom’s families - but no bridesmaids and no groomsmen. While traditionally, the tea ceremony involves extended family as well, because of the restriction on numbers, they held it with just their parents.</p>
<p>Mr Chew said he hopes to be able to hold another ceremony with his extended family. With the time that was freed up from having a reception, the couple got to do a photo shoot around their childhood homes in Hougang and Tampines.</p>
<p>There may not have been as much of a fanfare as originally planned, but Mr Chew said it was still a happy affair.</p>
<p>“I am still happy and delighted to have married the love of my life,” he said.</p>
