KUALA LUMPUR (April 24): The King, Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri&rsquo;ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah today expressed support for the Government’s decision to extend the Movement Control Order (MCO) into a fourth phase, from April 29 to May 12, as announced by Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin yesterday.</p>
<p>According to the Comptroller of the Royal Household for Istana Negara Datuk Ahmad Fadil Shamsuddin, apart from the support for the MCO extension, Al-Sultan Abdullah also supported all the other strict measures implemented by the Government to effectively fight COVID-19 in the country.</p>
<p>“His Majesty took note of the measures conveyed during an audience with the Minister of Health Datuk Seri Dr Adham Baba today,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Dr Adham was granted an audience with the King via a video conference at 11am today, which lasted about 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Along with the support, Ahmad Fadil said His Majesty also expressed appreciation to the Government and the relevant authorities for the implementation of the measures.</p>
<p>Ahmad Fadil said among the measures were the implementation of the Enhanced Movement Control Order (EMCO) in several high-risk areas such as Kampung Sungai Lui in Hulu Langat, Selangor, and in Simpang Renggam in Kluang, Johor.</p>
<p>“Also the efforts to curb the spread of the disease among foreigners in Kuala Lumpur Wholesale Market and the Selangor Mansion building in Masjid India.</p>
<p>“The strict measure of the Government in banning entry for foreign tourists to prevent import cases of COVID-19 is also highly appreciated,” he said.</p>
<p>He said Al-Sultan Abdullah also praised the Government and relevant authorities for taking the quick and strict measures which had enabled Malaysia to record much lower percentage of COVID-19 cases compared with other countries, including the developed nations.</p>
<p>“The high patient recovery percentage and the low mortality rate recorded n Malaysia also proved that the Government had the best procedures in handling the global pandemic,” he said.</p>
<p>In this regard, His Majesty also described the trend as a good sign for the efforts to break the chain of COVID-19 infections and end the MCO in accordance with the six guidelines issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO).</p>
<p>The six guidelines are that the country must be able to control the infection and transmission of COVID-19; have proper tracing, quarantine and patient and contact treatment procedures; minimise the risk of transmission in health facilities and treatment centres; implement preventive measures in public places; address and reduce the risk of transmission from abroad (import cases); and educate the community on the pandemic and prepare them to adjust to the new normal.</p>
<p>Ahmad Fadil said according to recent records, Malaysia is on the right track to curb the pandemic chain and end the MCO, and His Majesty had also urged the people to play their part to ensure the safety of themselves, their families and their communities.

<p>With the number of Covid-19 cases on a decline, the government has decided to give leeway on restrictions during the Movement Control Order (MCO).</p>
<p>It was announced by Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin who also broke the news that the MCO will be extended to 12 May.</p>
<p>Students</p>
<p>Students who are still on campus and are unable to go home because of the MCO will be able to do so soon as the government is planning to bring them back with the advice of the Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>Muhyiddin said there are around 100,000 students who are stuck at their campuses and added that the government will announce the details on the matter soon.</p>
<p>Those stranded at their hometowns</p>
<p>For those who are in the village or elsewhere and want to return to their homes, the government is considering granting a one-time permission to allow them to go back.</p>
<p>This permission is only given to those who are trapped in the village or elsewhere before the government enforced the first MCO.</p>
<p>Those affected can register online or make an appointment at the police station for registration purposes.</p>
<p>MCO might be extended for longer</p>
<p>Although the MCO has been in effect for more than a month now, Muhyiddin hasn’t ruled out the possibility that the order will be extended in the future.</p>
<p>However, if Covid-19 cases continue to see a significant decline, the government is likely to gradually reduce restrictions on several sectors including the social sector.</p>
<p>With the possibility of the MCO period to be extended in the future, Muhyiddin said the government is studying ways to gradually revive the economy.</p>
<p>This includes developing short and medium term economic recovery plans to ensure economic activity can be revived quickly after the end of the MCO period.</p>
<p>He added that the government will also develop a comprehensive short-term, medium and long-term economic recovery plan.</p>
<p>The focus now is to identify measures and initiatives that will stimulate short and medium term economic growth, and encourage the confidence of the people and investors to revitalize the country.</p>
<p>Among the initiatives being planned are building capacity and skills of the people, promoting domestic spending, enhancing the resilience of industries including SMEs, and fostering a more positive investment environment for the future.</p>
<p>Subsequently, he also said the government will consider opening up other sectors and sub-sectors but it’s subject to stringent requirements.</p>
<p>This is to ensure that companies remain competitive and that employees can continue to work in a safe environment.</p>

<h3 id="recession-imminent-with-mco-extension">Recession imminent with MCO extension</h3>
<p><img src="https://themalaysianreserve.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/TMRAK2102_08.jpg" alt="img">
The Prihatin package is likely to cushion the decline in GDP by as much as RM50b of the projected best-case scenario GDP in 2020</p>
<p>By DASHVEENJIT KAUR / Pic ARIF KARTONO</p>
<p>THE extension of the Movement Control Order (MCO) without some easing in measures could deepen the economic recession in Malaysia as production and trade would struggle to recover until 2021.</p>
<p>The Malaysian Institute of Economic Research (MIER) highlighted that any prolongation of MCO after April 28 could cost a 2% contraction of GDP growth.</p>
<p>MIER chairman Tan Sri Dr Kamal Salih (picture) said 98% manufacturing and businesses may not fully recover by the fourth quarter of 2020 (4Q20) and 1Q21 as well.</p>
<p>“However, under our best-case scenario (most optimistic), we project economic activities including trade and investment to fully rebound by the 3Q20 and further strengthen through 2021.</p>
<p>“Under the best-case scenario, Malaysia real GDP in 2020 is likely to grow by 3.8% relative to 2019 or -0.29% from the 2020 baseline,” he added.</p>
<p>This is in line with both Bank Negara Malaysia and World Bank expectations for Malaysia in 2020. In contrast, under the MIER worst-case scenario, real GDP is projected to contract by 1% relative to 2019 and -4.9% relative to the 2020 baseline.</p>
<p>For both scenarios, MIER took into account the total of the government’s Prihatin stimulus package of RM260 billion, with the supposition that only 20% of the non-fiscal injection (RM225 billion) will be realised into new capital formation across the economy.</p>
<p>As for 2021, Malaysia’s GDP is projected to grow further by 5.2% and 4.3% for the best-case and worst-case scenarios respectively.</p>
<p>In real value terms, this is 8.23% and 4.1% higher respectively, than the 2019 levels.</p>
<p>The stimulus package is likely to cushion the decline in GDP by as much as RM50 billion or 3.6% of the projected best-case scenario GDP in 2020.</p>
<p>Kamal said he also presumes the MCO will be gradually lifted, but with strict measures such as the six requirements stipulated by the World Health Organisation.</p>
<p>“The gradual economic opening over the ensuing six months will cushion the recessionary impact that many authorities including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and Fitch Ratings Inc, to name a few, expect this year.</p>
<p>“On the other hand, a premature economic opening (without the strictest of containment protocols), may lead to the risk of infectivity. This is not an easy trade-off for the government,” he added.</p>
<p>As the economy plummets between MCO Phase 1 and 3, Kamal further assumes disequilibrium in the Malaysian labour market for 2020 and 2021.</p>
<p>As for the job market, under the best-case scenario, he said the Prihatin package and near-full recovery is expected to prevent job losses markedly by 1.05 million (from</p>
<p>1.08 million to 28,600 workers). Meanwhile for the worst-case scenario, job losses are projected to decline from 2.41 million to 1.46 million (or 955,266 jobs being protected).</p>
<p>In terms of unemployment, if Malaysia’s real GDP shrinks about 6.9% relative to the 2020 baseline, the number of job losses (presumably mainly non-salaried jobs) could be 2.4 million, 67% of which are unskilled workers.</p>
<p>Kamal also believes with new capital-technology injection and productivity increases, there is a larger scope for GDP growth in 2021 should the Covid-19 pandemic subsides in Malaysia and worldwide, particularly within Malaysia’s main trading regions.</p>
<p>“MIER has in the pipeline through its Crouching Tiger Initiative a number of bankable investment bids on various industries, ranging from food security, 5G technology, electric cars, financial services, manufacturing and physical infrastructure development.</p>
<p>“To illustrate, we simulated an implementation of food security projects with the capital expenditure at RM87 billion and 5G technolog adoption (RM15 billion), coupled with 0.5% increases in technical efficiency among skilled labour and intermediate inputs,” he said.
