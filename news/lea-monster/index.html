<p>Jan Plewka freut sich auf seine musikalische „Geistervertreibung“: Gemeinsam mit seinem Selig-Kollegen Christian Neander rockt er zum Song „Monster“ richtig ab, und seine Künstler-Kolleginnen um LEA gehen ausnahmslos mit. Auf dem Sitz hält es keinen mehr. Am Ende ist die Begeisterung groß: „Dunkel“ war die Performance ist zu hören und „sexy“, wie Ilse DeLange findet. „Es war cool und rau, unpoliert!“ Auch LEA selbst ist hin und weg: „Besser geht’s nicht“, erklärt sie.</p>
<p>Besonders freut sich LEA über die Version, denn Jan hat damit wirklich alle Liebeskummer-Dämonen vertrieben. Denn sie schrieb den Song nach ihrer ersten Beziehung und damit auch nach ihrer ersten Trennung. Ein ganz besonderer Schmerz. „Es ging mir so schlecht“, erklärt LEA. „Ich hatte das noch nie vorher. Es war wie im Bilderbuch eine Trennung. Ich war wirklich depressiv in dieser Zeit für viele Wochen und Monate.“ Den Song „Monster“ schreibt sie dann innerhalb von einer Stunde an dem Klavier eines Berliner Hotels. Eine erste „Heilung“ für sie.

<h3 id="lea-is-a-monster-fans-say-naya-rivera-was-right-as-glee-stars-samantha-marie-alex-newell-reveal-ordeals">&ldquo;‘Lea is a monster’: Fans say Naya Rivera was right as ‘Glee’ stars Samantha Marie, Alex Newell reveal ordeals&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://cheesecake.articleassets.meaww.com/443938/uploads/6eb61310-a495-11ea-b150-09a2c8c61539_800_420.jpeg" alt="img">
In the wake of the George Floyd protests, several celebrities have come forward and voiced their opinion against systemic racism. ‘Glee’ actress Lea Michele took to Twitter to talk about the tragic death but it backfired when her co-star Samantha Marie Ware highlighted her hypocrisy and slammed her for racist remarks in the past.</p>
<p>No sooner Lea Michele started trending online, fans pointed out how Naya Rivera and Amber Riley were right about their co-star all along. &ldquo;Naya Rivera &amp; Amber Riley were right about that 2-face b!tch all along!! Lea Michele getting exposed for being racist by ex-black glee cast members&hellip; but when Naya Rivera &amp; Amber Riley said it a long time ago&hellip; people attacked them.. how the tables have turned!!!&rdquo; one tweet read.</p>
<p>One fan said, &ldquo;Naya tried telling y’all!! She got so much heat for calling her out,&rdquo; and another recalled the past incident saying, &ldquo;Naya Rivera and Lea Michele probably fought over who could say the most slurs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Samantha Marie Ware (Getty Images)</p>
<p>Alex Newell joined the talk on Twitter and tweeted a “get her” GIF in response to Samantha&rsquo;s tweet and several other GIFs to other allegations. Alongside one &ldquo;Girl, bye&rdquo; GIF, she wrote, &ldquo;Child we ain’t got not a damn thing to lie about 6 years later!&rdquo; When one fan asked why Alex took a photo with Lea on Broadway in January 2018, Alex replied, “She was there I was being polite!! Like I was with anyone that came to see my show! Also I know youre not talking about the season I wasn’t in… until I had to ask to come back so I could pay my bills… since I was released mid season five… while being a series regular!”</p>
<p>Yvette Nicole Brown came in support of Alex and said, &ldquo;Alex and I actually haven’t said anything. Realize that,&rdquo; and he replied, &ldquo;Not a damn word! They can’t stand black people supporting other black people&hellip; it’s like they just can’t fathom it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the iconic show, Lea played nerdy Rachel Berry who really focused on singing and Naya essayed the role of the popular cheerleader. In her book, &lsquo;Sorry Not Sorry, Naya wrote, &ldquo;As the show progressed, though, that friendship started to break down, especially as Santana moved from a background character to one with bigger plot lines and more screen time. I think Rachel—erm, I mean Lea—didn’t like sharing the spotlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alex Newell (Getty Images)</p>
<p>While they denied it later, the feud between the two actors was much talked about those days. Ryan Murphy opened about it and told E! News, &ldquo;I know for a fact that they [Lea and Naya] admired each other&rsquo;s work, ‘cause I directed them both in scenes. I don&rsquo;t think I would take on Lea and Naya. I think for a feud to work on this show, it has to have decades of pain behind it. But if they&rsquo;re still feuding at 40, I might consider it. I&rsquo;ll call them up in a couple years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fans, however, have taken their differences too seriously and can&rsquo;t stop pouring one tweet after Samantha&rsquo;s post. One said, &ldquo;Naya Rivera was really trying to warn us about how awful Lea Michele is&hellip; imagine threatening to shit in someone’s wig.&rdquo; Calling Lea a &ldquo;monster&rdquo;, another said, &ldquo;LEA MICHELE HAD PRODUCERS FORCE NAYA RIVERA TO SING AN ARIANA GRANDE SONG ON THE SHOW, AFTER NAYA WALKED IN ON HER BOYFRIEND CHEATING ON HER WITH ARIANA. LEA IS A MONSTER.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One Twitter user said, &ldquo;Naya Rivera comes online and exposes Lea Michele some more &gt; Lea Michele exposes Naya in return &gt; so the whole Glee cast just ends up exposing each other&raquo;&gt;.&rdquo; Another posted, &ldquo;Naya Rivera must be blasting this hard after hearing more people expose Lea Michele.&rdquo; It seems the &lsquo;Glee&rsquo; stars just got a chance to burst out all the hidden angst after one incident, didn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toen Lea Michele op 29 mei een tweet de wereld in slingerde over George Floyd had de 33-jarige Amerikaanse Glee-actrice waarschijnlijk niet verwacht dat daarmee ’haar’ beerput geopend zou worden. Meerdere collega’s deden uit de doeken hoe de actrice tijdens de opnames van de populaire serie Glee zich als een ware heks gedroeg en zelfs pestgedrag naar haar collega’s vertoonde. En dat gedrag schijnt met de paplepel te zijn ingegoten&hellip;

LEA und Capital Bra – dass das musikalisch passt, wissen wir spätestens seit LEAs Feature in Capis Monster-Hit „110“. Auf ihrem neuem Studioalbum „Treppenhaus“, das vergangenen Freitag veröffentlicht wurde, gibt’s nun die Feature-Revanche: In „7 Stunden“ steuert der „Bratan“ einen Rap-Part bei und gibt darin den Künstler, der auf der einen Seite seinen Traum lebt und jeden Tag in einer anderen Stadt ist, dabei aber auch an der Fernbeziehung mit seiner Freundin zu knapsen hat. Aber „egal, wie weit wir von uns weg sind, ich versprech‘, dass ich immer einen Weg find‘. Mach dir keine Sorgen, denn egal, auch wenn es noch so weit ist, ich halt nicht an, bis du nicht mehr allein bist“, verspricht LEA.</p>
<p>Seit gestern gibt’s nun auch ein mega-nices Musikvideo zu „7 Stunden“ – schaut her:

<h3 id="it-forces-us-to-be-resourceful-creative-lea-salonga-shares-her-life-under-quarantine">&ldquo;&lsquo;It forces us to be resourceful, creative&rsquo;: Lea Salonga shares her life under quarantine&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://sa.kapamilya.com/absnews/abscbnnews/media/2020/entertainment/05/21/20200521-lea-salonga.jpg?ext=.jpg" alt="img">
MANILA – More than two months since a lockdown was implemented in Metro Manila due to the coronavirus pandemic, Lea Salonga shared an update as to how she’s been spending quarantine at home with her family.</p>
<p>Aside from participating in fundraising virtual concerts, Salonga said in a Facebook Live broadcast of Monster RX 93.1 on Thursday that the current situation, if anything, has forced her to be resourceful and creative with what she has at home.</p>
<p>“I have been crocheting, I’ve been knitting. My daughter, she draws. She’s just been busy with that and hanging out with her friends playing video games. All of us here in the house, we’re all finding things to do,” she said.</p>
<p>Just like everyone else, Salonga is also immersed in streaming shows online.</p>
<p>“I tend to gravitate towards cartoons. I’ve been watching a lot of cartoons. On Netflix, I binge-watched the entire fifth season of ‘She-Ra and the Princesses of Power.’ If you’re a kid of the &rsquo;80s, you have a distinct memory of what She-Ra is supposed to be. But if you’re an LGBT ally, this is the cartoon that everybody’s waiting for,” she said.</p>
<p>In the same interview, Salonga also talked about her taste in music and some projects which she would love to do.</p>
<p>According to Salonga, she doesn’t think there’s anything her supporters might be shocked to find out that she’s into when it comes to music.</p>
<p>“I don’t think anybody’s gonna be surprised. I think a lot of singers listen to just about everything anyway… I’m not into Rage Against the Machine, anything like that. My husband is,” she said.</p>
<p>In terms of projects, Salonga also said there’s not one that she wishes she was able to do but didn’t.</p>
<p>“I guess I tend to treat something that I don’t get or I don’t get to be a part of as ‘Oh well, it’s one of those things. It happens to everybody.’ I don’t think there’s anything like that,” she said.</p>
<p>“I try not to dwell on what could have been. I’d rather think of the good memories of what was and what actually happened, rather than dwell on what could have been. It just feels so wasteful of one’s energy,” she added.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Salonga shared that she still has dream roles to play.</p>
<p>“As far as the classic ones, when I get older pa and by then I think the quarantine will be over, it would probably be the lead in ‘Gypsy.’ That would be one. Give me a few years pa,” she said.</p>
<p>As for the newer shows, Salonga mentioned she would love to have a role in “Hadestown” which she and her daughter got to watch last year.</p>
<p>Towards the latter part of the interview, Salonga shared some inspiring words to her supporters, which she won’t certainly see in the near future just yet because of the nature of her work in live entertainment.</p>
<p>“We have to all be patient still. Many places in the country are moving towards modified ECQ and hopefully we get to general community quarantine. This is still not a time to be complacent and we all still have to be very careful and very vigilant when we go out there. Not to rush to anything just to keep ourselves and the people where you’re quarantining with safe,” she said.</p>
<p>Salonga said she will personally keep herself in strict quarantine until she feels it is safe to go back out there.</p>
<p>“But I know that there are a lot of people that have to for reasons of economics, for reasons that they are essential workers in this crisis. To all of you, please continue to be careful. We can’t afford to lose any of you,” she said.</p>
<p>“Kapit lang. We just all have to make virtual kapit with one another and we are all gonna weather this. In the meantime, we find ways to be creative and resourceful and helpful even to our little corners of the world. Even if we won’t feel it, it will actually make a difference,” she said.</p>

<p>Pull out the receipts: Finding out how awful Lea Michele truly is</p>
<p>Everyone who has watched Glee can see how monstrous character Rachel Berry can be. Well, it turns out that the actress behind her, Lea Michele, didn’t have to act like a monster – she already was one.</p>
<p>Recently the public has become aware of Lea Michele’s dastardly behavior towards those who have worked with her – and well pretty much everyone she encounters. The stories keep piling up – it’s hard to keep track at this point. Here’s the gossipy laundry list on Lea Michele’s offenses.</p>
<p>The initial call-out</p>
<p>Like many celebrities, Lea Michele tweeted about the tragedy of George Floyd, the man who was killed by a white police officer and has inspired countless protests across the nation. However, Lea Michele was called out by Samantha Ware, the actress who played Jane Hayward on Glee’s final season. Unafraid to share her terrible experience with Lea Michele, Ware responded to Michele’s performative post, saying:</p>
<p>“LMAO REMEMBER WHEN YOU MADE MY FIRST TELEVISION GIG A LIVING HELL?!?! CAUSE ILL NEVER FORGET. I BELIEVE YOU TOLD EVERYONE THAT IF TOU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY YOU WOULD “SHIT IN MY WIG!” AMONGST OTHER TRAUMATIC MICROAGRESSIONS THAT MADE ME QUESTION A CAREER IN HOLLYWOOD…”</p>
<p>Lea Michele offered a public apology on the matter saying that she doesn’t recall the event and that she apologies for being “perceived as insensitive or inappropriate at times.” This apology has been criticized for being fake and her sentiments towards Black Lives Matter superficial.</p>
<p>Ware responded to the apology saying, “Perceived? Purcieved? Purse? Open your purse??????????????” Urging Lea Michele to actually do something, Ware added a link to a fundraiser for the family of James Scurlock, a black man who was recently shot and killed in a recent protest.</p>
<p>After this twitter incident, the stories about Michele came piling in – many finally sharing her long history as a Hollywood nightmare.</p>
<p>Awful from the beginning</p>
<p>Let’s start from the top – Lea Michele has been accused of demonstrating terrible behavior even when she was very young and new to the scene. Elizabeth Aldrich, a self-care coach working on the set of the Broadway musical Ragtime, spoke up about her experience with Michele.</p>
<p>“She was absolutely awful to me and ensemble. She demeaned the crew and threatened to have people fired if she was in anyway displeased. I used to cry every night from the mean and manipulative things she would do. She was 12. She was terrifying.”</p>
<p>Another performer, who claimed to be sub on Ragtime, backed Aldrich up, saying, “… even at 12 years old, @LeaMichele was the meanest person I ever encountered on Broadway. And that includes Tony Randall and Roseanne who I also worked with (both AWFUL people). She’s a cancer on humanity.”</p>
<p>More horror stories</p>
<p>But Lea Michele’s offenses continue to go beyond that of a tyrannical twelve-year-old. A stream of more revelations about Lea Michele’s completely heinous attitude have poured in. George Canonico, an understudy on Broadway’s Spring Awakening, wrote:</p>
<p>“You were nothing but a nightmare to me and fellow understudy cast members. You made us feel like we didn’t belong there. I tried for years to be nice to you to no avail. Maybe actually apologize instead of placing the blame on how others ‘perceive’ you. You’ll probably just delete this though.”</p>
<p>Reports also share times when Michele has referred to the background cast as “cockroaches” and once even spit out soup she was dissatisfied with right into the pot. The list of her abominable treatment of others goes on, many depicting her as bossy, stuck-up, &amp; downright rude.</p>
<p>Even Glee costar Heather Morris (Brittany Pierce), who has defended Michele, confirmed that she was a monster, saying, “was she unpleasant to work with? Very much so; for Lea to treat others with the disrespect that she did for as long as she did, I believe she SHOULD be called out.”</p>
<p>Transphobic too?</p>
<p>Not only have there been reports about her unacceptable attitude on set, it’s been revealed that Michele has demonstrated transphobic behavior. Trying to raise awareness about transphobia, trans model Plastic Martyr, shared her shocking experience with Michele during an Emmys ceremony.</p>
<p>“I was still in the process of my transition and wasn’t 100% as ‘passable’ then,” Martyr wrote in an Instagram comment. “I was in the bathroom and started washing my hands and said excuse me to her when trying to reach the soap and she goes ‘Excuse me?! EXCUSE ME???? EXCUSE you….you realize you’re in the WOMEN’s bathroom.’”</p>
<p>In another tweet, she reflects on the disparaging incident saying, “I remember going from feeling so beautiful that day to walking out of that bathroom feeling so self-conscious and embarrassed.”</p>
<p>Overwhelming consensus</p>
<p>The horrifying stories about this washed-out star are primarily undisputed &amp; incredibly widespread. So much so, that some are calling it old news, just waiting for more people to dish about other Hollywood figureheads who have been atrocious.</p>
<p>Famous for being a Disney singer and an alum from The Voice, Jordan Pruitt expresses her take on Lea Michele in her latest tweeting, “Everyone in Hollywood KNOWS that Lea Michele is a horrible human being …. she is a Bitch to everyone. We all know it … yawn. Moving on …”</p>
<p>Elaborating on her experience in the Hollywood scene, Pruitt continues saying, “Well, I lived in LA and worked there for a LONG time. I’ve seen ALOT. Comes with the territory. I’m just saying; the only thing shocking is that people are just now calling her out … bout time.”</p>
<p>There are likely countless other Hollywood actors guilty for similar craziness in their career. Who are they? Hopefully, the heat Lea Michele is getting may stir up stories about other celebrities and oust them for their atrocious behavior as well.

<h3 id="glee-samantha-ware-says-lea-micheles-apology-shows-she-hasnt-learned-anything">&ldquo;Glee: Samantha Ware Says Lea Michele’s Apology Shows She “Hasn’t Learned Anything”&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://2tjkwj41v8oc2lfdtr39exre-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-1143134450-1000x600.jpg" alt="img">
Ware’s first performance on the show was a stirring cover of the Janelle Monae song “Tightrope.”</p>
<p>Ware also claimed Michele threatened to have her fired after Ware inadvertently offended the star during a group scene in which Ware’s character was not the focal point.</p>
<p>“When you’re shooting a scene, sometimes the camera is on you and sometimes it’s not, but you still have to be in the scene,” Ware said. “The camera wasn’t on us, so it’s not like we had to give a full-throttle performance. But apparently, I was goofing around when the camera wasn’t on me, and she took that as me being disrespectful to her.”</p>
<p>Michele has not commented since her apology, but a source close to the actress did provide this rebuttal to People, the outlet that exclusively published Michele’s apology before it went up on her social media accounts: “In this particular instance, Samantha was goofing off during an emotional scene for Lea, and it was disrupting the flow for her. Lea did get upset about that, but it was because she felt Samantha didn’t respect the show.”</p>
<p>As for the infamous “shit in my wig” remark, Ware said that incident occurred during the screening of an episode for cast and crew. “She had an issue because I had laughed [when watching a scene] and that’s when the ‘I’m going to shit in your wig’ comment happened,” Ware said. “Some chuckled and some gasped. It was mortifying. The whole point was for her to embarrass me. People heard her, but no one was going to stand up to her.”</p>
<p>After Ware spoke out against Michele, a number of her other costars from Glee followed suit. During an interview on Instagram Live with journalist Danielle Young, actress Amber Riley said she did not think Michele was racist, but stopped short of defending her actions. “I’m not going to say that she’s racist. She’s also pregnant, and I think that everyone needs to chill. Y’all dragged her for a couple of days. But at the same time, in my inbox there are a lot of black actors and actresses telling me their stories and letting me know they have dealt with the same things on set—being terrorized by the white girls that are the leads of the show,” Riley said.</p>
<p>But she added, “The stories I’m reading about how white women are using their privilege and the fact that they are not fireable, something that I was told once on set after having my own complaint—they know that they are not fireable and they use that privilege to terrorize their counterparts. These networks don’t have to give a fuck.”</p>
<p>Actress Heather Morris also addressed Michele’s behavior, but stopped short of calling it racist. “Let me be very clear, hate is a disease in America that we are trying to cure, so I would never wish for hate to be spread to anyone else,” Morris wrote in a tweet. “With that said, was she unpleasant to work with? Very much so; for Lea to treat others with the disrespect that she did for as long as she did, I believe she should be called out. And yes, it’s also on us because to allow it to go on for so long without speaking out is something else we’re learning along with the rest of society. But, at the current moment [it’s] implied that she is a racist and although I cannot comment on her beliefs, I think we’re assuming, and you know what happened when we all assume.”</p>
<p>Accusations about Michele’s on-set behavior have been discussed for years. Glee star Naya Rivera wrote in her 2016 memoir, Sorry Not Sorry, that her relationship with Michele deteriorated as the show progressed, “especially as Santana moved from a background character to one with bigger plot lines and more screen time. I think Rachel—erm, I mean Lea—didn’t like sharing the spotlight.”</p>
<p>Rivera added in her book that Michele did not say one word to her during the final season.</p>
<p>Despite those comments, Rivera denied feuding with Michele when she appeared on an episode of Watch What Happens Live last year. “I don’t think there was, like, any beef,” she told host Andy Cohen.</p>
