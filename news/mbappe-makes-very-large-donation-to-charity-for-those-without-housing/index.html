Mbappe makes ‘very large’ donation to charity for those without housing</p>
<p>The 21-year-old PSG forward has given a significant sum towards helping people who are struggling and vulnerable in a difficult time</p>
<p>star Kylian Mbappe has made a ‘very large’ donation to the Abbe Pierre Foundation – a charity that helps people without housing.</p>
<p>As people are told to stay indoors, those without shelter are at a much higher risk of contracting coronavirus and the organisation is particularly keen to keep people safe and provide them with a place to stay.</p>
<p>The World Cup winner’s generous actions will help the foundation provide aid to more people that require support in a turbulent time.</p>
<p>The charity released a statement on their official website thanking the 21-year-old for his donation: “Concerned about the consequences of the serious health crisis which strikes our country, but also of all the consequences which it can generate on the most fragile people, Kylian Mbappe has just made a very large donation to support the work of the Abbe Pierre Foundation.</p>
<p>“His generosity will make it possible in particular to implement first aid actions, access to water and hygiene for people in very precarious situations, access to food and shelter for homeless people etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Foundation sends its most sincere thanks to Kylian Mbappe for his generosity and his attention towards people in great precariousness.</p>
<p>“In the context of the current health crisis and beyond the service tickets which are starting to be distributed on the territory, the Abbe Pierre Foundation needs to provide an emergency fund to finance a wide range of actions aimed at homeless people aiming to give them access to water, hygiene and food.”</p>
<p>The superstar forward had been enjoying another fine individual season, with 18 goals and seven assists in just 20 games as he fired PSG to a 12-point lead at the top of the table with a game in hand.</p>
<p>In all competitions, the Frenchman had managed 30 goals and 17 assists in only 33 appearances, but his fine form has been put on hold along with the rest of the footballing world as measures are put in place to postpone football in an attempt to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.

<h3 id="i-felt-worse-than-mbappe-when-he-was-tested-for-covid-19--herrera">I felt worse than Mbappe when he was tested for COVID-19 – Herrera</h3>
<p><img src="https://t.resfu.com/media/img_news/goal_mbappecropped_1pxcktw433nlo1gbt8rfegbow6.jpg" alt="img">
Ander Herrera revealed he felt worse than Kylian Mbappe when his Paris Saint-Germain team-mate was tested for coronavirus.</p>
<p>Mbappe tested negative for coronavirus earlier this month, just days out from PSG&rsquo;s Champions League last-16 second leg against Borussia Dortmund.</p>
<p>But Herrera said he was in a worse condition than Mbappe, with the midfielder missing the clash due to a thigh injury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was two days before PSG v Dortmund and the previous weekend Neymar had a group meal and I had been by his side,&rdquo; he told Cadena SER on Thursday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was worse than him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PSG&rsquo;s win over Borussia Dortmund behind closed doors which sent them into the Champions League quarter-finals was their last match with sport around the world brought to a standstill by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The financial impact of the suspended, and potentially cancelled, seasons is set to be felt and Herrera is open to taking a pay cut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to be consistent with the situation of the clubs,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Personally, I am very grateful to PSG for having me here and of course I would listen to them.&rdquo;

Kylian Mbappe has made a generous donation to the Paris-based charity Abbe Pierre Foundation as France continues to fight the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Ligue 1, along with the vast majority of other sporting competitions, has been put on hold amid the crisis, with over 27,000 confirmed deaths worldwide.</p>
<p>France has 32,964 confirmed cases of the illness and, in a bid to assist the work of the Abbe Pierre Foundation, Paris Saint-Germain and France star Mbappe has donated a large sum to the charity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Concerned about the consequences of the serious health crisis which strikes our country, but also of all the consequences which it can generate on the most fragile people, Kylian Mbappe has just made a very large donation to support the work of the Abbe Pierre Foundation,&rdquo; the charity said in a statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His generosity will make it possible in particular to implement first aid actions: access to water and hygiene for people in very precarious situations, access to food and shelter for homeless people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Foundation sends its most sincere thanks to Kylian Mbappe for his generosity and his attention towards people in great precariousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The charity did not confirm how much Mbappe had donated.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, it was reported Cristiano Ronaldo and his agent Jorge Mendes had donated a large sum to three intensive care units for coronavirus patients at hospitals in Portugal, while a hospital in Barcelona announced Lionel Messi had pledged money to support them during the crisis.
