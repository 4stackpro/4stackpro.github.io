<p>This Animal Crossing: New Horizons tourney seems a little fishy. Fishing enthusiasts will be delighted to know that CJ’s Fishing Tourney is available today. The event is only available for a limited time, so here is everything you need to know about the Fishing Tourney in Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</p>
<p>What You Need to Know about the Fishing Tourney</p>
<p>Players will first need to make sure that they have rods and bait in their inventory. They will then need to find CJ, an otter with a cooler, on their island’s plaza. CJ will ask if the player would like to join the tourney, after which they can enter multiple times. The first entry will be free, but additional entries will cost 500 bells each.</p>
<p>Players will then need to go to the closest body of water and catch as many fish as possible within three minutes. The first three fish are worth one point each. The player will be awarded two bonus points if they manage to catch any more fish.</p>
<p>The player’s points accumulate during the event and the player can trade in points for a variety of prizes. The prizes are “fishing” themed and range from fish t-shirts to fish wands. Each of the prizes cost 10 points. The player can earn a Bronze Trophy for acquiring 100 points, a Silver Trophy for 200 points, and a Gold Trophy for 300 points. CJ will also mail the player a special prize the day after the event if the player reaches 100 points.</p>

<p>On Fishing Tourney days, C.J. will set up a stand in front of Resident Services. All you have to do is talk to him and tell him you want to take part in the Fish Tourney. The first time you participate in the Fishing Tourney, you&rsquo;ll be able to do so for free. However, every time after that, you&rsquo;ll need to pay 500 Bells in order to participate. Fishing Tourney Rules You must catch as many fish as possible within a three-minute window .</p>
<p>. You&rsquo;ll receive points for each fish you catch during this time. You get one point per fish. Once you&rsquo;ve caught a total of three fish, two additional bonus points get added to your total.</p>

<dt>If you want to earn the most points during the Fishing Tourney, then you&rsquo;re going to need to catch a bunch of fish. Here&rsquo;s how to do that. And yes, it&rsquo;s going to take some jigs and lures. You&rsquo;re going to want to use fish bait because it guarantees that you&rsquo;ll get a fish and not a Bunny Day Water egg. Gather manila clams : Before going up to C.J. and initiating the competition, you need to craft a bunch of bait. Run around the beaches and look for holes in the sand where water comes shooting out. When you find one, use your shovel to dig at that spot, and you&rsquo;ll acquire a manila clam. Continue to collect until you have at least 10 manila clams. Manila clams don&rsquo;t stack, so make sure you have plenty of room in your inventory for them.</dt>

Manila clams don&rsquo;t stack, so make sure you have plenty of room in your inventory for them. Craft some bait and a rod : Next, run to a DIY workbench and start crafting. One clam can be crafted into one piece of bait. Unfortunately, you cannot craft multiple things at once, so you&rsquo;ll need to craft them one at a time. We recommend having at least 10 pieces of bait in your inventory each time you participate in the Tourney. You should also have an extra rod on you in case the one you have breaks.</p>

<p>Run up to C.J. and tell him you want to participate in the Fishing Tourney. Run to the nearest body of water : Now run to the beach or the closest river or pond you can find. Don&rsquo;t waste time looking for a fish. Just immediately toss your bait into the water to make a fish appear if one isn&rsquo;t already at your closest location. Source: iMore</p>

<dt>Cast your line : Once the shadow of a fish appears, cast your fishing pole line into the water. The bobber needs to land in front of the fish to catch its attention.</dt>
<dd>
<p>Once the shadow of a fish appears, cast your fishing pole line into the water. The bobber needs to land in front of the fish to catch its attention. Catch that fish : Press A as soon as the bobber goes down to reel the fish back in. Tip : The visual of the fish biting at the bobber tends to make me a little trigger happy. I find I catch fish a lot more efficiently when I rely solely on sound while fishing. Turn the volume way up, look away from the screen, and then when you hear the bobber get pulled under immediately press A.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Press A as soon as the bobber goes down to reel the fish back in. Throw more bait in and continue catching fish : Once again, don&rsquo;t waste your time running up and down the river banks or shores looking for fish shadows. Stay in one location and continue to toss bait into the water. Each time a fish shadow appears, throw your line in front of it.</p>

He&rsquo;ll tally up your catches and will let you know how many points you&rsquo;ve received. Now you can turn them in for some Fish Swag. Just like this I&rsquo;m a very visual learner, so here&rsquo;s a video for all you other visual learners that shows you the fastest way to catch fish: C.J.&lsquo;s Cooler</p>

<p>Just underneath C.J.&lsquo;s stand, you&rsquo;ll see a large blue cooler. This cooler can hold up to 20 of the fish you&rsquo;ve caught at a time. Make sure you cash in your catches for Bells before it gets filled up. Additionally, if you catch something rare that you want to take to Blathers or use to decorate your home, you can retrieve it by going up to the cooler, selecting the fish, and then putting it in your inventory.

<p><img src="https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/screen_kubrick/1578/15787979/3651591-animal-crossing-fishing.jpg" alt="img">
The Bunny Day egg hunt is still underway in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, but another event is also set to take place in the game later this week. On Saturday, April 11, New Horizons will hold its first Fishing Tourney.</p>
<p>The Fishing Tourney has been a regular recurring event in Animal Crossing since the series&rsquo; debut. It remains to be seen how the event plays out in New Horizons, but in previous games, you would compete with your villagers to catch the biggest fish within a set window of time; if you scored the largest catch, you&rsquo;d take home a trophy and a special prize.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the Bunny Day event is also going on now in New Horizons. Through Bunny Day itself (April 12), you&rsquo;ll be able to find different types of eggs around your island, which can be used to craft limited-time Bunny Day furniture. These eggs can be harvested from trees, stones, and even reeled in from the river and ocean, which has annoyed many players given how prevalent the eggs have been.</p>
<p>In response, Nintendo has released a new patch that adjusts the eggs&rsquo; spawn rates, making them less common. The patch also resolves a bug that prevented players from receiving the correct sculpture after giving scarab beetles to Flick. You can read the full patch notes on Nintendo&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re new to Animal Crossing or just getting started on your deserted island getaway, we&rsquo;ve put together a variety of guides to help you out in New Horizons. Be sure to check out our tips on playing the stalk market and crossbreeding flowers. With April underway, a variety of new bugs and fish are also available to catch in the game.
