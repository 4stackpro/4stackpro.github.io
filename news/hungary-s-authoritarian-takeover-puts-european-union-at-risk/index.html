<p>On Monday, under the pretext of addressing the COVID-19 public health emergency, Hungary&rsquo;s parliament gave green light to the Orban-led government to rule with unlimited power for an indefinite time. Prime Minister Viktor Orban can now suspend any existing law and implement others by decree, without parliamentary or judicial scrutiny. Elections have been suspended.</p>
<p>The law allows for new criminal penalties of five years in prison for publishing vaguely defined “false” or “distorted” facts – another blow to media freedom in the country. With this law, Hungary becomes the first country in the European Union to virtually abolish all democratic checks-and-balances.</p>
<p>How has it come to this? In the past 10 years, the government has spared no efforts to curb judicial independence, restrict civil society activities, and gain near full control over the media. Having repeatedly failed to appreciate the gravity of the situation, EU institutions risk making the same mistake again.</p>
<p>Even since the European Parliament in September 2018 triggered Article 7 – the mechanism dealing with EU governments putting EU’s values at risk – EU states have dragged their feet instead of ramping up pressure. Article 7 is not the problem – it’s that EU member states and the Commission have not put their weight behind the procedure.</p>
<p>The European Commission should fully back Article 7 proceedings and launch urgent actions to challenge the emergency law before the EU Court of Justice. EU leaders, including German Chancellor Merkel and French President Macron, should bring Article 7 procedures to the next level.</p>
<p>That alone won’t be enough, though. Cutting access to certain EU funds and political isolation would hit Orban where it hurts. A mechanism to cut or redirect EU funding that could be misused due to the democratic deficit is desperately needed, provided it does not hurt the well-being and livelihoods of ordinary Hungarians. Increased scrutiny on the use of EU funding should start as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Orban’s government has crossed too many lines and turned his country into the EU’s first non-democracy. His peers need to make it clear they disavow these policies that have no place in the European club and refrain from rolling out the red carpet to their authors. It’s also high time the European People’s Party expelled Orban’s party, Fidesz, for flagrant breaches of its rules and values.</p>
<p>Hungary’s new law is a carte-blanche for authoritarianism. If Europe doesn’t stand up for democracy and rule of law in Hungary now, the damage will be felt across the continent.

<h3 id="von-der-leyen-criticises-hungary-but-fails-to-mention-it">Von der Leyen criticises Hungary, but fails to mention it</h3>
<p><img src="https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/euobs-media/1ec141a7221768ce2d95d895aa8b73cc-480x.jpg" alt="img">
EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen warned member state governments on Tuesday (31 March) not to weaken fundamental rights and democratic values in their fight against the coronavirus.</p>
<p>But the commission chief did not name Hungary in her statement, where on Monday prime minister Viktor Orban&rsquo;s two-thirds majority in parliament granted his government indefinite and sweeping emergency powers.</p>
<p>Student or retired? Then this plan is for you.</p>
<p>Von der Leyen said that even in challenging times the EU&rsquo;s founding values of freedom, democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights should be defended.</p>
<p>She conceded governments need to have the necessary tools to act rapidly and protect citizens, referring to the state of emergency that had been introduced in some 15 EU countries and other extra measures capitals have taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is of outmost [sic] importance that emergency measures are not at the expense of our fundamental principles and values as set out in the treaties,&rdquo; the EU executive president wrote.</p>
<p>In a direct reference to the measures adopted in Hungary, von der Leyen wrote: &ldquo;Democracy cannot work without free and independent media. Respect of freedom of expression and legal certainty are essential in these uncertain times. Now, it is more important than ever that journalists are able to do their job freely and precisely, so as to counter disinformation and to ensure that our citizens have access to crucial information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new emergency measures in Hungary include possible jail terms for publishing news deemed by the government fake or distorted, sparking concerns over media freedom in the country.</p>
<p>Hungary already ranks the lowest among EU members in the world press freedom index of the Reporters Without Borders organisation.</p>
<p>Von der Leyen insisted any measure must be limited, proportionate, and should not be indefinite, while governments must be subject to scrutiny.</p>
<p>The time limit for the new measures in Hungary lasts until the parliament decides to end them. But two-thirds of the assembly is dominated by Orban-loyal MPs, granting him control over any termination date.</p>
<p>The EU commission will &ldquo;closely monitor, in the spirit of cooperation,&rdquo; the application of emergency measures in all member states, the statement adds.</p>
<p>With regards to Hungary, commission spokesperson Eric Mamer said that the executive will &ldquo;analyse the final law&rdquo; and monitor its application.</p>
<p>An EU official said that one of the key benchmarks to look at will be if the Orban government gives back the emergency powers once the crisis has subsided.</p>
<p>However, Daniel Hegedus, a fellow at the German Marshall Fund warned that even if the Orban government retracts the emergency measures, it does not make the system it had built before the crisis democratic.</p>
<p>The EU commissioners will meanwhile have a discussion on emergency measures taken by EU countries on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Hungarian government spokesman, Zoltan Kovacs, who gained notoriety in Brussels after live tweeting from a closed door session of EU ministers seized the opportunity of the commission&rsquo;s statement omitting Hungary, and retorted by saying that the new measures are in line with EU treaties.</p>
<p>Strained relations</p>
<p>Von der Leyen&rsquo;s statement comes after justice commissioner Didier Reynders on Monday already named Hungary as the focus of the commission&rsquo;s efforts to hold EU rules, amid a flurry of emergency measures.</p>
<p>Von der Leyen sought &ldquo;a fresh start&rdquo; at the start of her mandate with Hungary, and other central European countries, whose governments have come under EU scrutiny over democracy and rule of law.</p>
<p>Orban backed her nomination last June as head of the commission at the expense of Manfred Weber, the official candidate of the centre-right European People&rsquo;s Party (EPP), where they all belong.</p>
<p>The EU probe into Hungary&rsquo;s backsliding on democracy, the so-called Article 7 procedure is on a forced break as council meetings of EU ministers cannot be official unless are they take place physically.</p>
<p>MEPs have also criticised Hungary&rsquo;s move and called for the commission to act.</p>
<p>Socialist group leader Iratxe Garcia said there is &ldquo;no excuse for an indefinite lockdown of democracy&rdquo;. Liberal Renew leader Dacian Ciolos called the Hungarian measures a &ldquo;red alert for liberal democracy in Europe and beyond.</p>
<p>A group of more than a dozen MEPs from the largest political groups signed a petition calling for the protection of democracy in the coronavirus crisis, and have called for member states and the commission to act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ursula von der Leyen has to recognise the seriousness of the situation and act,&rdquo; MEP Daniel Freund said, calling for the freezing of EU funds to Hungary and for the ruling Fidesz party to be finally kicked out of EPP.

<h3 id="steven-dick-british-diplomat-in-hungary-dies-at-37">Steven Dick, British Diplomat in Hungary, Dies at 37</h3>
<p><img src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/30/obituaries/00dick-virus-loss1/00dick-virus-loss1-facebookJumbo.jpg" alt="img">
This obituary is part of a series remembering the people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others here.</p>
<p>Steven Dick always dreamed of working for Britain’s Foreign Office. In December, more than 10 years after he joined it as a desk officer at the office’s migration directorate, he became the deputy head of mission at the British Embassy in Budapest. Within weeks he was dead.</p>
<p>Mr. Dick died on Tuesday in Hungary after contracting the coronavirus, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said. He was 37.</p>
<p>Praised for his kindness and dedication, Mr. Dick had worked his way up the diplomatic ranks and had the potential to become an outstanding diplomat, Simon McDonald, the head of the diplomatic service at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, wrote on Twitter on Thursday.
