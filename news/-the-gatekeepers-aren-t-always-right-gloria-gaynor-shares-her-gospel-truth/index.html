<p>She was a voice that defined the disco era, and yet Gloria Gaynor and her defiant l hit ‘I Will Survive’ have outlived the genre she helped popularise. The Newark native has more than survived since she was first discovered in a New York City nightclub in 1969.</p>
<p>Gaynor ushered in the 70s with two hit records, ‘Honeybee’ and joyous remake of The Jackson 5’s ‘Never Can Say Goodbye’, carrying the disco torch throughout the decade before a B-side track would alter the course of her career.</p>
<p>Following its release in 1978, ‘I Will Survive’ became a defiant anthem of survival, one that was quickly embraced by the LGBTQ community and has been an inspiration for different movements and communities over the ensuing decades.</p>
<p>With ‘I Will Survive’, Gaynor garnered devotion on the dancefloor, and now over 40 years later, she still has the power to move people through music as a Grammy-winning gospel artist.</p>
<p>She’s notched a hit every decade over the past 50 years and in 2020, won a Grammy for Best Roots Gospel Album for her 18th studio album Testimony, which debuted Top 5 in the Billboard Top Gospel Albums Chart.</p>
<p>While Gaynor’s Studio 54 days are officially behind her, ‘I Will Survive’ continues to resonate with today’s generation thanks to a new remix by legendary remixer/producer Eric Kupper. The new digital EP includes three new remixes, all available on streaming services.</p>
<p>“‘I Will Survive’ has become an anthem around the globe for people facing challenges and tragedies in their life,” says Gaynor.</p>
<p>“And now more than ever, we need to help each other and provide encouragement and inspiration through music whenever possible.”</p>
<p>“An opportunity to uplift and encourage”</p>
<p>Along with the new remixes, the iconic anthem has been experiencing a resurgence during the coronavirus pandemic after Gaynor shared an instructional handwashing video on TikTok and started the #iwillsurvivechallenge. The video, which invited fans to lip-sync to the track, has amassed more than 4 million views.</p>
<p>As the song is embraced by each generation, Gaynor explains that it has “meant different things to me at different times” and remains, “an opportunity to uplift and encourage somebody else”.</p>
<p>The song’s tenacious spirit is no accident, as anyone who knows Gaynor’s storied history. By 1978, she’d weathered label politics, disco backlash and a serious spinal surgery after falling over a stage monitor that left her temporarily paralyzed from the waist down. Recording while in a back brace, Gaynor tapped into the song’s boot-strapping ethos and delivered something more than just a dance song.</p>
<p>“Fans have come to me with all kinds of stories about how this song has helped them through and it’s become the core of my purpose,” says Gaynor.</p>
<p>“It became the foundation for my new album. All these years I’ve been telling people I will survive and now I think I’ll tell them how. So, this new album Testimony is really about telling people how I’ve survived and how they can survive whatever life throws at them.”</p>
<p>On the album’s opener, ‘Amazing Grace’, she picks up right where she left off in 1978. “There was a time I was broken / I didn’t know which way to turn / I was paralyzed,” she sings on her rendition of the gospel favourite, backed by a choir and full band.</p>
<p>It’s the most personal song on a record full of spiritual standards, original compositions and some surprising interpretations, including Bob Dylan’s ‘Man of Peace’. Partnering with Grammy-winning producer Chris Stevens, Gaynor rendered her own personal experiences into a soulful roots gospel collection.</p>
<p>Recorded at one of Music Row’s most historic buildings, the former RCA Studio, Gaynor and Stevens enlisted some of Nashville’s finest session musicians to record in a live environment.</p>
<p>“Whenever anyone asks me what I think is the major difference between today’s music and music when I first started recording, I invariably say, it’s the spontaneous creativity that can only happen between live musicians playing together and inspiring one another,” explains Gaynor.</p>
<p>“Gospel has always been my comfort zone”</p>
<p>As someone who’s been a fixture of the dance chart for the past 40 years, doing a gospel record may seem like an abrupt departure, but Gaynor actually grew up on the genre. “Gospel has always been my comfort zone,” she says. “There have always been gatekeepers who keep them [gospel and secular music] separate. But now people have access to whatever kind of music they want.</p>
<p>I can listen to Madonna and then listen to Mahalia Jackson and nobody can stop me. So, I think people are now getting what they want, when and how they want it, and this is showing that the gatekeepers aren’t always right.”</p>
<p>Having won her first Grammy for Best Disco Recording in 1980 and another 40 years later in 2020, Gaynor believes her recent win proves that she can be successful on her own terms.</p>
<p>“I was very pleased that it happened with gospel music after so many years of being swayed from it and denied the opportunity to do gospel music,” says Gaynor.</p>
<p>“They’d tell me, ‘You don’t need to do that [gospel], we’re trying to work on getting a Grammy’, and then I don’t get a Grammy until I do it.”</p>
<p>Like so many artists, Gaynor is staying productive during quarantine. Along with getting creative in the kitchen, she’s been working on a forthcoming book and connecting with fans during her “I Will Survive Monday” series on Instagram Live.</p>
<p>I’m not just here on this planet taking up space”</p>
<p>With Pride month in full swing, her anthemic single will inevitably return to the charts, but it’s not the only song in Gaynor’s songbook that resonates with her LGBTQ audience. In 1983, Gaynor turned the showtune ‘I Am What I Am’ from La Cage Aux Folles into a global club hit.</p>
<p>“People have shared many personal stories about how the song has uplifted, encouraged and inspired them,” says Gaynor.</p>
<p>“It’s always encouraging to me to know that I’m not just here on this planet taking up space, that I’m really doing something for others and being of a positive influence in other people’s lives.”</p>

<h3 id="gloria-gaynors-i-will-survive-gets-modern-day-remixes">&ldquo;Gloria Gaynor’s ‘I Will Survive’ Gets Modern-Day Remixes&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GloriaG_IWillSu_CoverAr_3000DPI300RGB1000348311-1024x1024.jpg" alt="img">
Gloria Gaynor’s empowering dancefloor anthem, ‘I Will Survive’ is receiving a modern-day refresh, thanks to producer Eric Kupper. The chart-topping DJ has produced three new versions of the 1978 hit, all of which will be included on the digital EP, I Will Survive (The Eric Kupper Remixes), available 12 June.</p>
<p>The three new versions, ‘Eric Kupper Mix Extended’, ‘Eric Kupper Dub Mix’ and ‘Eric Kupper Mix Edit’, were each created using the song’s original multi-track master tapes. In an official statement, Gaynor said that she was “extremely happy” that Kupper would be lending his talents to the song.</p>
<p>Written by Freddie Perren and Dino Fekaris, ‘I Will Survive’ was originally released as a B-Side for Gaynor’s cover of The Righteous Brothers’ song ‘Substitute’. The singer, however, saw the potential in the track’s powerful message, and so did radio and club DJs across the world. Since then, said Gaynor, “‘I Will Survive’ has become an anthem around the globe for people facing challenges and tragedies in their life”. She continued, “Now more than ever, we need to help each other and provide encouragement and inspiration through music whenever possible”.</p>
<p>In just two years of its release in October of 1978, the Grammy Award-winning song sold over 14 million copies worldwide. In 2016, it was inducted into the Library of Congress’ hallowed National Recording Registry. Today, ‘I Will Survive’ continues to resonate with new generations of fans, averaging six million streams per month. The song’s original video, meanwhile, has more than 130 million views on YouTube.</p>
<p>In recent months, the song gained new traction on TikTok, when millions of users lipsynched its lyrics for the #iwillsurvivechallenge at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Today, Gaynor has more than survived. In fact, she’s been one of the few artists to score a hit song in each of the past five decades. Earlier this year, Gaynor’s newest release, Testimony, received a Grammy Award for Best Roots Gospel Album. The album was warmly received by critics and fans alike – debuting in the Top 5 of the Billboard Top Gospel Albums Chart, and the Top 20 of Amazon’s Overall Album Chart.</p>
<p>Fans seeking more content from Gaynor can also visit her new official YouTube channel, where the disco icon regularly shares vintage concert and tv performance clips, in addition to new material.</p>

Gloria Gaynor, the voice behind &lsquo;I Will Survivor,&rsquo; looks gorgeous at 70-years-old. The celebrated singer has had ups and downs in her life, including never having children.</p>
<p>When Gloria Gaynor belted out the powerful lyrics to her hit song &ldquo;I Will Survive,&rdquo; the story of heartbreak and loss faced with endurance and strength has a lot to do with her own life.</p>
<p>In an interview with Closer Weekly, Gloria revealed that she wrote the song after undergoing an intense spinal surgery that forced doctors to remove a ruptured disc and fuse two vertebrae.</p>
<p>Gloria revealed that her record company didn&rsquo;t initially choose &ldquo;I Will Survive&rdquo; to be one of the first songs she released on the album. So she had to fight for it. While explaining her connection to the song, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The song is about unrequited love, but I was relating it to my back injury and the fact that I was standing there recording it in a brace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Known as the &ldquo;Disco Queen,&rdquo; Gloria admitted to partying a lot at the height of her career with her husband and manager, Linwood Simon. However, the couple never has children together; she explained:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny, I was the only one of my siblings who always wanted kids, yet I&rsquo;m the only one who didn&rsquo;t have them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gloria told The Guardian that she had wanted children, but her husband never did. However, after the couple divorced in 2005 after 26 years of marriage, she doesn&rsquo;t regret not having children, she admitted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to terms with it now, plus I wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted to raise them in a broken marriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gloria told Closer Weekly that even though adoption was something she considered, Linwood wasn&rsquo;t supportive of the idea, so she knew it would never happen.</p>
<p>Gloria proudly boasts a close relationship with her nieces and nephews. Along with a photo of her adopted dog, she wrote, &ldquo;always try to choose joy &amp; laughter in life. And my furry nephew, Parker, certainly brings mountains of both on a daily basis!&rdquo;</p>
<p>During her appearance on &ldquo;Loose Women,&rdquo; she spoke about her tumultuous marriage with Linwood and what finally led her to leave him.</p>
<p>Gloria revealed that she decided to walk away from the marriage just before they renewed their vows for their 25th wedding anniversary. She explained that it was several incidences that lead to her realizing that she didn&rsquo;t want to stay in the relationship.

<h3 id="panteón-rococó-tocará-en-vivo-versiones-de-selena-y-gloria-gaynor">&ldquo;Panteón Rococó tocará en vivo versiones de Selena y Gloria Gaynor&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.jornada.com.mx/ultimas/2020/06/07/panteon-rococo-tocara-en-vivo-versiones-de-temas-exitosos-de-selena-y-gloria-gaynor-7068.html/panteon-rococo.jpg-7385.html/image_large" alt="img">
Ciudad de México. Una descarga de “energía y catarsis” serán los tres conciertos de El cuarto del siglo, en los que Panteón Rococó prevé saturar de adrenalina el Foro Sol, luego de que tuvieron que posponerlos debido a la contingencia sanitaria. Ahora tendrán el hermoso de ánimo de disfrutar, otra vez, las presentaciones masivas.</p>
<p>Luego de este inusual receso, explicó Dr. Shenka, vocalista de la banda, “serán incluidas en los conciertos las canciones Si una vez y Sobreviviré (I will survive), que fueron interpretadas por Selena y Gloria Gaynor, respectivamente. Además, será un buen momento para rendir a nuestro estilo un homenaje al maestro Óscar Chávez”, quien estuvo muy cerca de los ocho integrantes de Panteón Rococó en diversas colaboraciones y falleció el pasado 30 de abril por Covid-19.</p>
<p>En entrevista, Dr. Shenka detalló que aunque la cuarentena cambió los planes “en todos sentidos”, en la agrupación la han tomado por el lado positivo, por estar en casa, relajarse, crear y preparar las presentaciones para sorprender al público que asista al recinto de Iztacalco los días 3, 4 y 5 de diciembre. “El ánimo en esta serie de conciertos estará más que vivo, lo cual garantiza fechas cargadas de energía”.</p>
<p>No obstante, “ahora estamos enfocados en darle salida a este material ya cocinado que estaba pendiente y en aprovechar estos espacios de inactividad con algo que habíamos hecho desde noviembre pasado. El cambio de fechas de los conciertos nos da la pauta para incluir estos temas, los cuales no se iban a tocar porque no habían sido presentados”.</p>
<p>Las canciones de Selena y Gaynor “son pequeños homenajes a grandes canciones; son éxitos mundiales que fueron interpretados en su mayoría por mujeres, lo cual le puso un plus maravilloso a este material, luego de que el álbum inédito Infiernos tuvo muy buena aceptación”.</p>
<p>“Homenaje al presente”</p>
<p>Cuando la banda grabó el sencillo que hizo famoso Gaynor, “no teníamos ni idea de lo que iba a acontecer en 2020. Después, en la selección natural de un sencillo se acomodó perfectamente al contexto que estamos viviendo; hemos estado más de dos meses en encierro y pensamos que Sobreviviré iba a dar un respiro y buena vibra a la gente, con el mensaje de seguir adelante y no bajar la guardia”.</p>
<p>La nueva versión de Sobreviviré fue producida y adaptada por el productor y arreglista KC Porter (Selena, Ricky Martin y Carlos Santana, entre otros) y grabada por Panteón Rococó en Los Ángeles. La banda, en este poderoso arreglo, integró diversos ritmos y elementos a la canción que recibió un Grammy en 1980. Ahora se convierte en un homenaje al presente, al aquí y ahora, mediante el cual se resignifica la acción de vivir en un concepto de transformación y constante aprendizaje, comentó Dr. Shenka.</p>
<p>En esta nueva etapa “será interesante ver cómo vamos a tomar todo en conjunto y como sociedad; va a ser triste si se nos olvida que somos frágiles y que tenemos que coexistir con el medio ambiente y nosotros mismos de manera diferente. En este sentido, con las canciones tratamos de hacer una reflexión profunda acerca de lo que acontece, de ser comprensivos y empáticos, incluso con aquellos que no pueden quedarse en casa. Se debe celebrar a las personas que se la están rifando en los centros de salud”.</p>
<p>A Dr. Shenka, quien también colabora con otros colegas, este año –del 25 aniversario de Panteón Rococó– la cuarenta lo ha obligado a reflexionar sobre “qué es lo que debemos y qué nos corresponde hacer”.</p>
<p>También, agrega, “he tenido un rencuentro en casa, lo cual me ha dado oportunidad de conectarme con muchas cosas, discos y casets, entre diversas cosas que tenía guardadas, que ahora ha habido tiempo de escuchar y reflexionar”.</p>
<p>Aseveró que fue “una pérdida triste” el deceso de Óscar Chávez, El caifán mayor. “Lo vi antes del Vive Latino; en realidad, nunca pensamos que él se volvería tan importante y hegemónico en la vida de Panteón Rococó; esto da pauta para rendirle el homenaje que no deberá faltar en los conciertos de diciembre”.

<p>Members took part in their very own Desert Islands Discs by nominating their favourite piece of music that they have enjoyed during lockdown.</p>
<p>Taking equal honours as most nominated were David Bowie and Andrea Bocelli with Gloria Gaynor’s ‘I Will Survive’ a most welcome runner-up.</p>
<p>As for some bowls action, in glorious Monday sunshine earlier this week, and with both greens and garden looking their absolute best, the greens were open for the first time this year.</p>
<p>To begin with, only singles roll-ups are being allowed, but this will be reviewed very soon with the hope that pairs or even triples may be possible as restrictions are gradually relaxed.</p>

<h3 id="xronia-polla-to-antonis-remos-who-turns-50-today">&ldquo;Xronia Polla to Antonis Remos who turns 50 today&rdquo;</h3>
<p><img src="https://greekcitytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/antonis-remos-mega.jpg" alt="img">
Popular Greek singer Antonis Remos, was born on the 19th of June 1970 in Düsseldorf, West Germany.</p>
<p>Later his family moved back to their native Thessaloniki, Greece, where he finished school. During his childhood, he got involved with music and learned to play the guitar.</p>
<p>After many appearances in Thessaloniki, in 1995 Antonis Remos had his first live appearance in Athens. He performed live next to famous artists, such as Dimitris Mitropanos, Stefanos Korkolis and Marios Tokas. This same year he signed his first contract with Sony Music Greece, planning to release his first album.</p>
<p>The first album which was released in 1996 and was titled after his name, became platinum in a few months. In April 1998, his second album, ‘Kairos Na Pame Parakato’ (Time to Move On) was released. For the first time, some of the most-prestigious Greek composers had given their songs to Antonis Remos, and for a second time in a row, the album gained platinum status.</p>
<p>In March 2000, Remos performed the title song of the movie ‘I Agapi Einai Elefantas’ (Love is an elephant) written by Minos Matsas. The soundtrack gained gold status.</p>
<p>A CD single release followed, which was titled ‘Fly with me’. It is actually a remix of the big hit ‘Meine‘ (Stay) having Danish artist Remee Guitar’s rap-ing vocals. During the winter of 2000, Remos and Sakis Rouvas performed live together at Diogenis Palace.</p>
<p>In June 2001, he released a double live CD titled ‘Mia Nihta Mono’ (Only for a night). The album gained platinum status.</p>
<p>During winter 2001, Antonis Remos performed live next to Giannis Parios. A CD single was also released in 2001. In spring 2002, Remos released the new album ‘Kardia Mou Min Anisiheis’ (Don’t worry, my love). Its songs were written by Giorgos Theofanous. The album gained triple platinum status, becoming one of the most-popular albums through the years.</p>
<p>During summer 2004, the Mikis Theodorakis orchestra presented the composer’s music written for theatrical plays and movies, with Remos as the lead voice, along with the actors Petros Filipidis, Natassa Manisalis and Giannis Samsiaris. He released a live recording of the appearances next to the 5 big composers. The album gained double platinum status. Later that winter, Antonis Remos appeared live with George Dalaras, in the brand-new “Athens Arena”.</p>
<p>Antonis Remos celebrated his 10 years in discography by releasing a triple Best Of album with Sony BMG Greece which went platinum. In summer 2007, Remos did a tour around Greece, giving 25 sold-out concerts for the first time after 10 years. He had with him a new band from Thessaloniki named “Onirama”. Antonis Remos and Onirama met at MAD TV’s secret concert that was in February and released a new album from that night. Hit songs of Antonis Remos were “retouched” by Onirama, gaining gold status under the title ‘Antonis Remos in Concert feat. Onirama’.</p>
<p>In 2010 he released a new song called ‘Terma i Istoria‘, and presented it live through his show “Love Stories” at Diogenis Studio.</p>
<p>Antonis Remos has travelled all around the world and is loved by Greeks all around the globe who pack out his concerts and are eager to hear him perform live.</p>
<p>He has also performed live with huge names of the international music scene, such as Julio Inglesias (Mykonos 2014), Gloria Gaynor (New York &amp; Athens 2014), Danny Brialliant (Mykonos 2015), Zeljko Joksimovic (Belgrade &amp; Athens) and Gipsy Kings (Mykonos 2016).</p>
<p>On a personal note, Antonis married his long-time partner Yvonne Bosnjak in September 2018, celebrating their beautiful wedding in Greece. The couple has a young daughter named Eleni.</p>
<p>In April, the popular Greek singer collaborated with MEGA TV, to give audiences a special “Μένουμε Σπίτι” (Stay at home) performance.</p>
<p>Χρόνια Πολλά to Antonis on this special milestone birthday!
