Provisional liquidators have been appointed to four companies in the USIT student travel group, after the Covid-19 crisis caused their collapse.</p>
<p>The companies employed 149 people.</p>
<p>The High Court was told that many spring and summer travel bookings as well as tours for students and school groups have been cancelled and new bookings have collapsed.</p>
<p>Senior Counsel Rossa Fanning said this caused a cash flow crisis leaving the companies insolvent and unable to pay their debts.</p>
<p>The companies had received booking deposits and pre-payments from a large number of customers.</p>
<p>Around €1.2m is owed to pre-booked customers, including around 3,000 students who paid deposits of €300 or more for travel to the US this summer.</p>
<p>Mr Fanning said USIT Ireland is a bonded travel agent and that may allow for refunds of deposits.</p>
<p>Travel insurance or credit card companies may provide &ldquo;an alternative route&rdquo; for refunds he said.</p>
<p>The companies cannot raise the €3.3m needed to continue to trade through to October 2020 and the directors had decided there was no option but to wind them up.</p>
<p>Mr Fanning said this was entirely a result of the catastrophic impact on international travel of the Covid 19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Until a few weeks ago, he said all but one of the companies had been largely profitable.</p>
<p>The court heard the company was unable to ensure employees would be paid until the end of March.</p>
<p>Mr Justice Mark Sanfey granted orders allowing for the appointment of Kieran Wallace and Andrew O&rsquo;Leary of KPMG as provisional liquidators to the four companies.</p>
<p>The judge said he like hundreds of thousands of Irish students had availed of the services of USIT a long time ago and he said it was sad that it had come to this.

US suspends J1 visa for at least 60 days</p>
<p>Bad news for anyone looking for a J1.</p>
<p>The J1 visa, a visa commonly used by Irish college students and recent graduates to temporarily work and live in the United States, has been suspended for 60 days.</p>
<p>The move was announced as part of a raft of measures introduced by the US to curb the spread of coronavirus and COVID-19. Among these measures is a ban on flights to the US from Schengen Zone countries (this ban does not presently include Ireland or the United Kingdom).</p>
<p>The suspension was confirmed by the US Bureau of Education and Cultural Affairs, amid the declaration of a state of national emergency. There is also an option to extend the suspension by a further 30 days.</p>
<p>In a statement on their website, J1 organisers USIT have acknowledged the uncertain times currently facing Irish young people looking to travel to the US.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are in constant communication with the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), our US Sponsors and our Partners, who are helping us monitor the situation closely. We want to assure you that we are committed to providing you with the best advice based on the information that is available to us and ask you to be patient as we work together to understand how and when we can travel safely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For those of you who have a payment deadline approaching for your USIT Summer or Work Abroad Programmes, we understand that you are concerned. We will communicate with each of you closer to your payment deadline with information. We will be as flexible as possible with your payment deadlines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our first priority is the safety of our customers and USIT employees, and we are doing everything possible to support the containment of Covid 19.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The USIT team are optimistic that by following the official advice from our government, we will be able to embrace travel again soon.&rdquo;

<p>Gardai are to launch a major nationwide policing operation aimed at ensuring the public comply with strict new lockdown measures announced this evening.</p>
<p>Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced stringent new measures this evening banning all non-essantial trips.</p>
<p>The measures will remain in place until Easter Sunday, April 12.</p>
<p>There will be high visibility patrolling by Garda members across the country during the weekend to ensure people adhere to the lockdown rules.</p>
<p>The operation runs from 7pm tonight until 7am on Monday morning, March 30 and will involve thousands of Gardai on foot, bike and mobile patrols.</p>
<p>Gardai said they will seek to encourage people to maintain the necessary public health measures but will intervene where venues and outlets are not in compliance or where groups of people are not adhering to recommended measures.</p>
<p>Announcing the operation, Commissioner Drew Harris said: &ldquo;An Garda Síochána’s priority is keeping people safe and that will continue this weekend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be a major policing plan across the country with high visibility of Garda members at key locations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is vital that people adhere to the social distancing guidelines. This will reduce the spread of COVID-19 and save lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vast majority of people are complying with the guidelines and we want that to continue this weekend. By all of us working together, we can flatten the curve and keep our loved ones safe.”</p>
<p>Deputy Commissioner, Policing and Security, John Twomey added: &ldquo;These high visibility patrols are to provide re-assurance and social distancing advice to the public.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garda members will pro-actively engage positively with people. An Garda Síochána will police as it has always done with the consent of the people. It is in everybody’s interest that people comply with these measures.”
