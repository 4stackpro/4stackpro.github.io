Wednesday night, David Blaine aired one-hour special to show off his illusions. David Blaine: The Magic Way, also featured an impressive slate of guest stars for him to wow, including prestigious power couples like Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, Tom Brady and Gisele and Breaking Bad&rsquo;s Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul.</p>
<p>It also introduced the world to his 9-year-old daughter, Dessa, who he had with his ex, Alizée Guinochet. In an interview with USA Today ahead of the special, Blaine admitted that &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been very private about everything with her, but during this time and with what’s going on, I felt like this is an appropriate time to show family and my daughter. And just give a little kind of insight to something I would normally not put on TV. Usually, in my shows, I&rsquo;m acting kind of, like, magician-y or whatever,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;This is the first time that I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blaine went on to admit that his daughter is &ldquo;so much better&rdquo; at magic than he is, but while she hasn&rsquo;t committed to following in her father&rsquo;s footsteps, she does have an eye for wild stunts, despite his advice against doing &ldquo;crazy things like papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Based on the reactions from viewers, it seems that both of them brought their A-game.

<p>The whole show will feature numerous magical acts and will last for about an hour, so hopefully, he will cheer you up in these difficult times.</p>
<p>When and Where to Watch David Blaine – The Magic Way?</p>
<p>David Blaine – The Magic Way will premiere on ABC on April 1st, starting with 10 PM. As we already mentioned, the whole thing will last an hour.</p>
<p>How Can I Live Stream David Blaine – The Magic Way?</p>
<p>In today’s world, we all spend a lot of time online. We enjoy the freedom we get to be able to watch our shows online, to connect to our friends and family, and to simply be able to kick back and take advantage of what technology can offer us. There are also loads of live TV platforms that are available to help us enjoy the shows, and sports, and movies we love, regardless of whether we’re home or not. With ABC broadcasting David Blaine – The Magic Way, we think that one of the best ways for you to enjoy the magic show online is with Hulu. Hulu has a single bundle of networks available, and it will allow you to watch ABC, as well as many other networks. Start your 7-day free trial of Hulu now!</p>
<p>If you want more content, Hulu has a couple of channel packs available, as well as several premium networks. What’s really cool about Hulu is that, when you subscribe to its live TV service, it also grants you permission to watch everything in the on-demand library. (Note: ABC is a channel that only broadcasts in select markets, so if you happen to live in an area where you do not get coverage, then you can use a VPN to connect to a server located in a different place, where the channel is available. You can click here to get more details on the steps you need to take to use a VPN.)</p>
<p>Here’s how you can start your Hulu 7-day free trial:</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is to visit Hulu’s Live TV webpage and to tap on the “Sign Up Now” button. This will take you to a new area, where you have to provide personal information in order to set up an account. The information they need is your name and email address, as well as other details.</p>
<p>Then, you get it to start building up your subscription by choosing the Live TV plan and adding channel packs and premium networks you may be interested in. There are also add-ons available that will help expand your cloud DVR storage space or the number of devices you can watch content on.</p>
<p>Finally, they need your card details so they can bill you when the free trial is complete.</p>
<p>Other Ways to Watch David Blaine – The Magic Way Online</p>
<p>YouTube TV – Another platform that can help you enjoy ABC is YouTube TV, which has a single bundle of networks. There are no extra channel packs here, but there are a few premium networks you can get if you want more content. What helps YouTube TV stand out from the crowd is the fact that subscribers get to enjoy three simultaneous streams and unlimited cloud DVR storage space.</p>
<p>How Can I Watch David Blaine – The Magic Way When Traveling Outside of the United States?</p>
<p>Live TV platforms and streaming services in the United States have one thing in common, which is the fact that they’re all geo-blocked. This happens because they have to respect the contract they signed with the networks, and they have to stream content only in certain areas. In our case, these areas are in the United States. Obviously, this can become problematic any time you cross the border, as your IP will reflect your location.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the problem has an easy fix, which is to change your IP address, so you appear to be in the United States rather than your actual location. If you don’t know which VPN to use, we can always recommend ExpressVPN, which is a tool that has thousands of servers all over the world and some great privacy features to help protect your identity.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can use ExpressVPN to watch David Blaine – The Magic Way:</p>
<p>The first step you need to take it to visit the ExpressVPN website (49% OFF) and to start setting up an account. The whole process will take a few minutes, and then you’ll be able to go ahead and enjoy your favorite shows, including the David Blaine special. ExpressVPN has a 30-day money-back guarantee policy, so you can always ask for a refund if you have any issues.</p>
<p>Then, you need to download the app and install it on your device. Launch the tool and log in to your account as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Look for one of the US-based servers and connect to it.</p>
<p>When the connection is established, you can go ahead and launch Hulu so you can start watching David Blaine’s Magic Way.</p>
<p>Can I Watch David Blaine – The Magic Way on the Network’s Website?</p>
<p>If you would rather watch David Blaine – The Magic Way on the ABC website, then you should know that you can surely do that. To access the live stream, you will need to log in to an account, which you can do with the help of credentials from your TV provider. The TV provider in question can be a live TV service or a cable company if you haven’t cut the cord just yet. (Note: The ABC live streaming is geo-blocked, so you will need a VPN if you want to access it when you’re abroad. You can click here to get all the details on the steps you need to take to make this happen.)</p>
<p>Can I Watch David Blaine – The Magic Way With a TV Antenna?</p>
<p>Yes, that is something that you can do because ABC is one of the channels that continue to broadcast over-the-air. An antenna will help you enjoy the channel locally. These devices are relatively cheap, and they are popular with cord-cutters, as they enable people to enjoy dozens of networks or free.</p>
<p>Before you buy yourself one of these antennas, you should make sure that ABC is available in your specific region, which you can do by visiting a site like NoCable. There, you will find out exactly what networks are available in your location and how far they broadcast stations are from your home. This way, you can find out what range you need your device to cover before you buy one. Make sure to check the devices we listed above in case any of them have the right features for your needs.</p>
<p>Can I Watch David Blaine – The Magic Way at a Later Time?</p>
<p>If you want to watch the show at a later time, then you should know that ABC will likely add it to its website after it airs. So, look the show up on the network’s website, so you can watch it when you have more free time.
