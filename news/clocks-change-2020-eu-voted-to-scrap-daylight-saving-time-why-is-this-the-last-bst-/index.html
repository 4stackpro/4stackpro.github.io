The clock change will happen in the UK on Sunday, March 29, meaning the country will lose one hour during its first lockdown weekend. The European Union voted to scrap the practice of moving clocks two years after the concept was proposed. But why did the EU make this decision?</p>
<p>Trending</p>
<p>The UK formally left the EU on January 31 and has entered an 11-month transition period where the UK will follow all of the EU’s rule and its trading relationship will remain the same. During this period, a new free trade agreement will be negotiated. The European Parliament voted to scrap daylight saving time from 2021 last year. The decision would have applied to the UK if it stayed in the EU. READ MORE: Daylight saving time: When do the clocks change and go forward?</p>

In March 2019, the European Parliament voted by 410 to 192 in favour of ending the practice of seasonal time shifts. Summer Time was first introduced during the First World War. Most countries discontinued this practice after the war and restarted it during the Second World War and its immediate aftermath. The practice was then widely cancelled by the 1950s, but was slowly introduced until the 1960s, with the energy crisis of the late 1960s and early 1970s.</p>

<p>Since that time, it has been observed in several European countries. Beginning in 1981, the European Commission began issuing directives requiring member states to legislate for a harmonised start and end to Summer Time. From that time, each directive has stated the transition time will be at 1am UTC on the last Sunday of March, but the end dates have differed. Proposals to abolish summer time observance were first put forward in 2015 and 2016. But at that time the European Commission did not put forward these proposals for consideration.

A web survey was issued and 4.6 European citizens showed high levels of support for not switching the clocks twice a year. In September 2018 the European Commission decided to propose that an end be put to seasonal clock changes. MEPs voted to scrap the practice in March 2019.</p>

<p>Member states will be able to choose whether to stay on permanent summer or winter time under the directive. EU member countries that wish to be permanently on Summer Time will adjust their clocks for the final time on the last Sunday in March 2021. Whereas, those who opt for permanent Winter Time will change their clocks for the final time on the last Sunday of October 2021. Opposition for the clock changes tends to be stronger in northern countries where seasonal differences have a larger impact than in the south. For instance, in June 2018, Finland had 18.5 daylight hours, but in December only had 5.5 hours. In Greece, the country had 14.5 daylight hours in June, but only 5.5 hours in December, but both countries use the same standard time zone.

<h3 id="daylight-saving-2020-when-does-florida-move-clocks-forward">Daylight Saving 2020: When Does Florida Move Clocks Forward?</h3>
<p><img src="https://patch.com/img/cdn20/users/714975/20200307/122527/styles/patch_image/public/clock___07120927840.jpg" alt="img">
FLORIDA — Winter is almost wrapped up, and as proof, we have more light in the evenings starting Sunday. While spring doesn&rsquo;t pop up on the calendar until March 19, the first hint tangible sign of it comes when Daylight Saving Time officially begins at 2 a.m. Sunday, March 8.</p>
<p>That means you&rsquo;ll want to turn your old-school clocks forward an hour when you go to bed Saturday night, March 7. The time change is automatic for most smartphones, computers, tablets and other digital devices.</p>
<p>Daylight Saving Time is the practice of setting clocks forward one hour from standard time in the spring, and back again in the fall, in order to make better use of natural daylight.</p>
<p>Florida lawmakers voted in 2018 to make the state&rsquo;s standard time Daylight Saving Time year-round. But, the legislation is contingent on changes being made to the federal Uniform Time Act, which allows states to exempt themselves from observing daylight saving time, and that hasn&rsquo;t happened yet.</p>
<p>Sunrise will be later, which will make Monday&rsquo;s commute a bit darker.</p>
<p>A change in time can mean that drivers are more tired than they realize, while transferring daylight from the morning to the evening means drivers and pedestrians will have to adjust to a darker morning commute to work or school, warned AAA Mid-Atlantic. It&rsquo;s critical that both drivers and pedestrians are aware of the potential dangers and act with caution.</p>
<p>AAA Tips for Drivers</p>
<p>Slow down, pay attention and eliminate all distractions.</p>
<p>Watch out for pedestrians when backing up in parking lots or driveways.</p>
<p>Keep vehicle headlights and windows (inside and out) clean.</p>
<p>Sun glare can make it difficult to see so: Increase your following distance from the vehicle ahead of you; Utilize your sun visor and invest in polarized sunglasses, as both can help reduce glare</p>
<p>Turn on your headlights to make yourself more visible during early morning and evening hours.</p>
<p>Watch the high beams. Do not use high beams when other cars or pedestrians are around.</p>
<p>Yield to pedestrians at crosswalks. Do not pass vehicles stopped at crosswalks.</p>
<p>Daylight saving time isn&rsquo;t observed in Hawaii or Arizona.</p>
<p>Those two states may have it right, according to the results of an October Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll that found Americans are increasingly frustrated by the biannual time switch and want it to end.</p>
<p>The daylight saving time poll found only 28 percent want to continue moving clocks ahead an hour in the spring and back an hour in the fall. About 40 percent want to adopt standard time year-round, while about 31 percent prefer year-round daylight saving time.</p>
<p>The poll also showed Americans 45 and older support year-round daylight saving time, while only 22 percent of those younger than want to make ditch it altogether.</p>
<p>On March 11, President Donald Trump weighed in, tweeting &ldquo;Making Daylight Saving Time permanent is O.K. with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One other thing to do the night before the time change: Test your smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. Just before you move that clock hand forward an hour, push the test button on the smoke and carbon monoxide alarm(s) in your home. If they do not work, replace the battery — unless it is a sealed 10-year lithium battery, in which case you will have to get a new alarm.</p>
<p>Still, the longer days and the beginning of daylight saving time are associated with the end of the SAD (seasonal affected disorder) season, giving people an extra hour of daylight to enjoy after they got off work. SAD is clinical form of depression that is believed to affect about 5 percent of the U.S. population.</p>
<p>Tell Us: What are you looking forward to most about the beginning of daylight saving time?</p>
<p>Critics say the lost hour of sleep harms our health, from increased strokes and heart attacks to lost productivity and workplace injuries.</p>
<p>There are ways to avoid sleep deprivation — which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says already affects about one-third of adults in the United States. Here are some tips:

<h3 id="daylight-saving-time-2020-aaa-warns-of-driving-hazards-with-spring-time-change">Daylight saving time 2020: AAA warns of driving hazards with spring time change</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.lehighvalleylive.com/resizer/BY8hF_MZrCVIkeJmKzbW7MG3-zU=/1280x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-advancelocal.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SIOSHXNQDJCG5NMBC5HPMAOGYE.jpg" alt="img">
Daylight saving time starts this weekend. At 2 a.m. Sunday, most of the U.S. will change clocks and “spring ahead” one hour.</p>
<p>With the spring time change comes a darker morning commute and increased risk of drowsy drivers, according to AAA.</p>
<p>“Drivers who miss just one or two hours of the recommended seven hours of sleep in a 24-hour period nearly double their risk for a crash,” AAA Mid-Atlantic spokeswoman Tracy Noble said in a news release.</p>
<p>The time change also means more light in the evening but less in the morning. AAA said that can mean more A.M. traffic accidents involving pedestrians. The automotive travel group urged common-sense precautions, asking drivers to be more mindful and use headlights and for pedestrians to wear bright colors and use crosswalks.</p>
<p>The clock atop the First United Church of Christ in Easton seems perpetually stuck at 9:15. Other clocks will move ahead one hour as daylight saving time takes effect at 2 a.m. March 8, 2020.Steve Novak | For lehighvalleylive.com</p>
<p>The twice-a-year time change is also when fire officials urge homeowners to check and change their smoke detector batteries.</p>
<p>Daylight saving time lasts from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November, when we return to standard time.</p>
