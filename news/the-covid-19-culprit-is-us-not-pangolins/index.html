Dr. Robert Breiman is an MD and a professor of Global Health and Infectious Diseases at Emory University. He was previously based in Bangladesh and Kenya with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and led investigations and response to a number of major outbreaks. Dr. Breiman is a member of the National Academy of Medicine. The opinions expressed in the commentary are those of the author. View more opinions on CNN.</p>
<p>(CNN) Early in the SARS outbreak, some 17 years ago, I was in Beijing and Guangzhou with an international team of scientists assembled by the World Health Organization. In live animal markets, the civet cat was a commodity.</p>
<p>The mammal, which resembles a mongoose more than a cat, is a culinary delicacy in China and was believed to have health benefits. Civets are shy animals and avoid humans and other animals. Urbanization and deforestation had threatened civets and put them in closer contact with the horseshoe bat, which was shown to carry the SARS virus.</p>
<p>After a long investigation, civets were determined to have caused the SARS outbreak . As the intermediate host, civets spilled the virus over to one or more humans while the horseshoe bat was believed to have harbored the virus strains, serving as the virus reservoir.</p>
<p>Recent studies indicate that there may be parallels between SARS and the current pandemic. Scientists have found coronaviruses, genetically similar to the Covid19 virus, in pangolins , leading to a hypothesis that they served as an intermediate host, much like civet cats did with SARS.</p>
<p>But if pangolins or civet cats could talk, they would claim no responsibility for the outbreaks they have been associated with. And I would agree. The culprits in both coronavirus outbreaks that began in China are not the pangolin, horseshoe bat or civet cat. We have met the enemy: It is us.</p>
<p>Pangolins are critically endangered anteaters that resemble armadillos. While they are a protected species, they are often smuggled from African and Asian countries into China where they are sold for their meat and scales. In local folklore and traditional medicine, the pangolin&rsquo;s scales are thought to provide a variety of benefits. Since it is illegally poached, purchase of a pangolin in animal markets and under-the-table settings is rumored to be up to $600 per kilogram.</p>
<p>We have affected these creatures in more ways than poaching them. As human populations grow, our incursion into a variety of habitats expands even as our appetite for certain animals remains unabated. As it has with civets, deforestation has dramatically affected the areas available for pangolins&rsquo; foraging, putting them in closer contact with other animals including bats, which are reservoirs for other dangerous viruses like Nipah virus, and possibly Ebola. This may have facilitated the spread of disease.</p>
<p>Our behaviors — interactions with these animals and their environments — are responsible for the dangers that increasingly threaten not just animal species, but also perhaps our own. If we do nothing, outbreaks like Covid-19 will continue to occur, and likely accelerate in number.</p>
<p>Given our unprecedented mobility, a single &ldquo;spillover&rdquo; event, a virus jumping from animal to human, in a remote location can rapidly result in a global calamity like what we are experiencing now. Clearing land for human activities leads to contact with (and between) animals and their secretions at an unparalleled intensity. Some animals may be tolerant of organisms to which we have not previously been exposed, and to which we do not have protective immune responses.</p>
<p>Occasionally, as in the case of Covid-19, genetic characteristics make it harmful for humans. Hunting and marketing of exotic, environmentally threatened animals have often been the final blow, providing a path for pathogens to be transmitted to susceptible humans. If, as in the case of SARS and Covid-19, the virus can then be passed from human to human, it may only take a single spillover event to lead to a global pandemic given the degree of human mobility in the 21st century.</p>
<p>Our behaviors play an immense role with what dangers we face — and will face in the future.</p>
<p>So, we have a couple of choices. We can accept that outbreaks like Covid-19 will continue to occur, and likely accelerate in number, as human populations grow, as our incursions into a variety of habitats expand and as our penchant for certain animals continues.</p>
<p>Or, we can decide that the threat to humans (and potentially other animal species) is too great and we must be intentional about changing the path we are on. For instance, environmental experts and public servants should deliberate and decide the best way governments could tightly control the harvesting of trees and expand use of land while considering the impacts on animal habitats. They can do this with a particular eye towards reducing the risk of animal-to-human pathogen-spillover events (among other considerations) when granting permits.</p>

<p>Smuggled pangolins have been found to carry viruses closely related to the one sweeping the world.</p>
<p>Scientists say the sale of the animals in wildlife markets should be strictly prohibited to minimise the risk of future outbreaks.</p>
<p>Pangolins are the most-commonly illegally trafficked mammal, used both as food and in traditional medicine.</p>
<p>In research published in the journal Nature, researchers say handling these animals requires &ldquo;caution&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And they say further surveillance of wild pangolins is needed to understand their role in the risk of future transmission to humans.</p>
<p>Two groups of coronaviruses related to the virus behind the human pandemic have been identified in Malayan pangolins smuggled into China, said lead researcher Dr Tommy Lam of The University of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although their role as the intermediate host of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak remains to be confirmed, sale of these wild animals in wet markets should be strictly prohibited to avoid future zoonotic [animal to human] transmission,&rdquo; he told BBC News.</p>
<p>Bats also contain coronaviruses, which are closer still to the human virus, except in one key area - the part that helps the virus invade cells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This tells us that viruses that look pretty adapted to humans are present in wildlife,&rdquo; said co-researcher, Prof Edward Holmes of the University of Sydney. &ldquo;Bats are certainly involved, pangolins may be, but it is very possible that other animal species are involved as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Coronaviruses under the microscope</p>
<p>Exactly how the virus jumped from a wild animal, presumably a bat, to another animal and then humans remains a mystery. The horseshoe bat and the pangolin have both been implicated, but the precise sequence of events is unknown.</p>
<p>Finding the virus in smuggled Malayan pangolins raised the question of where they contracted the virus, said Dr Lam. Was it from bats along the trafficking route to China or in their native habitats in Southeast Asia?</p>
<p>Calls to end illegal wildlife trade</p>
<p>Conservationists say it would be devastating if the discovery led to further persecution of the endangered mammal. The animal&rsquo;s scales are in high demand for use in traditional Chinese medicine, while pangolin meat is considered a delicacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the time for the international community to pressure their governments to end illegal wildlife trade,&rdquo; said Elisa Panjang of Cardiff University, a pangolin conservation officer at the Danau Girang Field Centre in Malaysia.</p>
<p>China has moved to ban the consumption of meat from wild animals in the wake of the outbreak. Similar moves are being considered in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Prof Andrew Cunningham of Zoological Society of London (ZSL) said it was important not to jump to conclusions from the paper. &ldquo;The source of the detected coronavirus really is unknown - it might have been a natural pangolin virus or have jumped from another species between capture and death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Dr Dan Challender, of the University of Oxford, said pangolins are known to host various strains of coronaviruses. &ldquo;Identifying the source of SARS-CoV-2 is important to understand the emergence of the current pandemic, and in preventing similar events in the future,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<h3 id="trafficked-pangolins-can-carry-coronaviruses-closely-related-to-pandemic-strain">Trafficked pangolins can carry coronaviruses closely related to pandemic strain</h3>
<p><img src="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/animals/2020/03/pangolin-coronavirus/01-pangolin-coronavirus-minden_00561281.ngsversion.1585301261615.adapt.1900.1.jpg" alt="img">
New research finds evidence that a small proportion of pangolins carry coronaviruses related to the strain responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a paper published March 26 in the journal Nature.</p>
<p>This makes pangolins the only mammals other than bats known to be infected by the closest relatives of the novel coronavirus. While the work neither proves nor disproves that pangolins are linked to the current pandemic, it does indicate that they could play a role in the emergence of new coronaviruses.</p>
<p>“If there is one clear message from this global crisis, it&rsquo;s that the sale and consumption of pangolins in [live animal] markets should be strictly prohibited to avoid future pandemics,” says Paul Thomson, a conservation biologist who co-founded the nonprofit Save Pangolins.</p>
<p>Bats are the most likely reservoir of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV, according to the World Health Organization, but it likely jumped to another species before spilling over into humans.</p>
<p>Pangolins—endangered, scaly, ant-eating mammals found in Asia and Africa about the size of domestic cats—are known to carry coronaviruses, Dan Challender wrote in an email. Challender heads the pangolin specialist group of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, which sets the conservation status of species. It’s not surprising, therefore, that they’ve become a focus in the search to understand where the novel coronavirus came from, he says.</p>

<p>Although international commercial trade of all eight species is strictly forbidden, pangolins are believed to be the most trafficked mammal in the world. The scales of thousands of pangolins are smuggled every year for use in traditional Chinese medicine, and their meat is considered a delicacy by some people in China, Vietnam, and elsewhere in Asia. Because coronaviruses can be transmitted by certain bodily fluids, feces, and meat, the trade in live pangolins for food is a greater concern for disease spread than contact with scales.</p>
<p>In China, it’s illegal to eat pangolin, but it can still be found on restaurant menus there. Pangolins were also regularly available for sale at live animal markets until January 26, when fear of the novel coronavirus spurred the government to order them all closed.</p>
<p>Genetic similarities</p>
<p>The new paper finds that the genetic sequences of several strains of coronavirus found in pangolins were between 88.5 percent and 92.4 percent similar to those of the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>Starting with tissue samples from 18 Sunda pangolins seized in anti-smuggling operations in 2017 and 2018, researchers tested for the presence of coronaviruses. They found it in samples from five of the 18 pangolins. They repeated the process later with samples from other seized pangolins, finding coronaviruses in a portion of those individuals as well. They then sequenced the genomes of those viruses and compared them to SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<p>Cautious in their wording, the researchers note that the genomic similarities “are not sufficient to suggest” that pangolins are the intermediate host that passed SARS-CoV-2 from bats to humans. But they don’t rule it out, either. The paper concludes, however, that pangolins should be considered as possible hosts for future new coronaviruses.</p>
<p>“I welcome the study,” Challender wrote. “Further research is needed on these viruses in pangolins, but importantly on other species too, which may have played a critical role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans.”
