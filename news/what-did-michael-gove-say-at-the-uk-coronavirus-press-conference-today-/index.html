<p>What time was the coronavirus press briefing today?</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s press conference began at 4pm and was broadcast live by the BBC.</p>
<p>The briefing was held in Downing Street and generally takes place between 4pm and 6pm and lasts 15 to 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Government press briefings have been ongoing since March 16.</p>
<p>Who hosted today&rsquo;s briefing?</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s briefing was hosted by Michael Gove, who has previously hosted the conference.</p>

<p>What did Michael Gove say at the press conference?</p>
<p>Gove said that hospital admissions in London have fallen &ldquo;slightly&rdquo; but there have been big increases in Yorkshire and the North East of 35 per cent.</p>
<p>He labelled the Midlands &ldquo;a particular area of concern&rdquo;, after it has seen a 47 per cent increase in hospital admissions.</p>
<p>Mr Gove added that work is continuing on &ldquo;transforming Birmingham&rsquo;s National Exhibition Centre into a 2,000 bed Nightingale hospital&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The cabinet minister paid tribute to the seven brave nurses and NHS workers who have tragically lost their lives fighting the virus.</p>
<p>He reminded the nation to stay inside &ldquo;to ensure their sacrifice had not been in vain&rdquo;, and said if we &ldquo;relax our adherence to the rules we increase the risk for others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regarding ventilators, Gove said that 1,000 ventilators will be being produced in the UK per day by next week and also that 300 ventilators arrived from China today.</p>
<p>NHS England medical director Stephen Powis said that new cases in the UK have &ldquo;stabilised&rdquo; in the last few days.</p>
<p>He later admitted that the death toll &ldquo;will be higher&rdquo; than those reported in hospitals but that numbers will &ldquo;start to fall&rdquo; as social distancing measures start to work.</p>
<p>Gove also said that children who receive free school meals will be eligible for vouchers to ensure they are fed over the Easter holidays.</p>
<p>Both Gove and Powis rubbished recent rumours that 5G masts spread coronavirus, with Gove calling the stories &ldquo;dangerous nonsense&rdquo; and &ldquo;the worst kind of fake news&rdquo;.</p>

<p>What happened at yesterday&rsquo;s briefing?</p>
<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s briefing was hosted by Health and Social Secretary Matt Hancock.</p>
<p>He was joined by Prof John Newton.</p>
<p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock announces the building of more Nightingale hospitals during coronavirus briefing</p>
<p>Hancock ordered the nation to main social-distancing, as he spoke of the weekend weather forecast for warm weather.</p>
<p>Insisting his advice was not a request but an instruction, he told Brits to “do your part” on social-distancing and stay at home.</p>
<p>He went on to say “we cannot relax our discipline” on social-distancing or people will die.</p>
<p>Also during the conference, Hancock was asked about promises of antibody tests, which have not yet transpired.</p>
<p>He went on to says no G7 country has found a home antibody test that works yet, &ldquo;but we continue to search for one&rdquo;.</p>
<p>When questioned about testing Hancock repeated that the UK has &ldquo;ramped up&rdquo; the numbers, before adding his &ldquo;clear goal&rdquo; of 100,000 a day by the end of April.</p>
<p>Hancock said that he has made £300m available for funding community pharmacies.</p>
<p>He outlined challenges the nation faces and the plan to drive the plan forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand why NHS staff want tests, so they can get back to the frontline,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am proud that every single patient who has needed a test for life-saving treatment has had access&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said it is important that the public confidence in the tests: &ldquo;Approving tests that don&rsquo;t work is dangerous and I will not do it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal, he said, is that everyone that needs a test will have one.</p>
<p>He said that he returned from illness more determined than ever to tackle the virus, working with our friends and allies across the world.</p>
<p>Why is the government holding daily press conferences?</p>
<p>Boris Johnson and his senior cabinet ministers had been criticised for a lack of regular updates into what is happening with the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>Among them was Sir Keir Starmer – the new Labour leader – who called for daily press conferences.</p>
<p>The Labour leader said he was “deeply concerned” that “ministers have been failing in their responsibilities to provide consistent and transparent public health advice”.

<p>Conspiracy theories linking 5G masts with the spread of coronavirus have been branded ‘dangerous nonsense’ and ‘the worst kind of fake news’.</p>
<p>Fire crews in the West Midlands and Merseyside have been called out to extinguish masts in recent days and Mobile UK, the trade body representing network providers, has said people are ‘abusing our key workers and making threats to damage infrastructure under the pretence of claims about 5G’.</p>
<p>Asked about the rumours at the Downing Street coronavirus briefing, Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove dismissed them as ‘dangerous nonsense’.</p>
<p>NHS England’s national medical director Professor Stephen Powis went further, calling them ‘complete and utter rubbish’, adding: ‘It’s the worst kind of fake news.</p>

<p>‘But in particular, these are also phone networks used by the emergency services and health workers and I am absolutely outraged, absolutely disgusted, that people would be taking action against the very infrastructure that we need to respond to this health emergency.</p>

<p>Videos purportedly showing masts deliberately set on fire were posted on social media after theories about the link between the mobile technology and Covid-19 circulated online.</p>
<p>Cheers actor Woody Harrelson and former Dancing on Ice judge Jason Gardiner are among stars who have shared theories.</p>
<p>Scientists, however, have completely rejected the claims.</p>
<p>Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: ‘Conspiracy theorists are a public health danger who once read a Facebook page.</p>

<p>‘Here, we also see similar groups of people keen to show their ignorance on a topic where they have no helpful expertise, nor any inclination to post useful public health messages.</p>
<p>‘The celebrities fanning the flames of these conspiracy theorists should be ashamed.’</p>

<p>Professor Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, added: ‘The internet connections these networks give us are one of the most important tools we are using to co-ordinate our response to the epidemic and efforts to do research to overcome it.</p>
<p>‘Damaging phone masts is like knocking holes in your lifeboats while your ship sinks.’</p>
<p>Prof Brendan Wren, professor of microbial pathogenesis, at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said a connection between the phone masts and the virus would be ‘both a physical and biological impossibility’.</p>

<h3 id="coronavirus-michael-gove-admits-nature-of-universal-credit-may-need-to-change">Coronavirus: Michael Gove admits &lsquo;nature&rsquo; of Universal Credit may need to change</h3>
<p><img src="https://e3.365dm.com/20/04/1600x900/skynews-universal-credit_4962487.jpg?20200404192839" alt="img">
Cabinet minister Michael Gove has acknowledged the government may need to review &ldquo;the nature&rdquo; of its flagship welfare reform, after being asked whether Universal Credit can provide sufficient financial support to claimants.</p>
<p>More than a million new applications have been submitted since the UK imposed strict social distancing and travel restrictions in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>The new welfare system is designed to provide an incentive for people to take up work, by enabling claimants to keep receiving benefit payments alongside income from a job.</p>
<p>However in normal circumstances, claimants are expected to actively seek work in order to qualify for financial support.</p>
<p>This has led to concerns about whether the system has enough flexibility to deal with the current circumstances where work is unlikely to be an option for the vast majority,</p>
<p>Advertisement</p>
<p>Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster insisted the whole welfare system was kept under review, but asked whether the standard weekly claim of £94 per week was sufficient for people to live on, he indicated further changes could follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we have to consider the nature of the system and whether or not we do need to ensure that we better support the vulnerable, we keep that constantly under review and I think it&rsquo;s important that we do recognise that its a very very difficult economic time for very many,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Image: Nearly a million people have signed up for Universal Credit during the pandemic</p>
<p>The message from Mr Gove contrasts with comments made by the Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey, who told a parliamentary select committee last month &ldquo;the underlying principles of Universal Credit have not gone away&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock recently admitted he would not be able to live on £94 per week, which is also the rate of statutory sick pay.</p>
<p>However, Mr Gove was keen to stress that while Universal Credit was one of the mechanisms by which the government was offering support to those in need during the coronavirus pandemic, it was not the only one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not the only means the government is deploying, as you&rsquo;ll be aware there are up to 1.5 million people in the most vulnerable category - the shielded vulnerable - who we are distributing food and prescription medicines to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He also pointed to a new task force led by Environment Secretary George Eustice, which is working with local authorities and charities to identify those who are vulnerable and in need in communities across the UK.</p>
<p>The Department for Work and Pensions is recruiting at least 5,000 more staff to increase its capacity to handle the surge in demand for Universal Credit.</p>
<p>Ministers have previously made clear that in addition to the standard claim of £94 per week, new Universal Credit claimants may be able to receive more money through housing and support additions.
