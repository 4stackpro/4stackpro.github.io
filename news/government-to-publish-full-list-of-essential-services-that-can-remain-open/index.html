The Government is this morning expected to publish a full list of the workers it classes as essential.</p>
<p>It comes after the Taoiseach announced a nationwide lockdown until Easter Sunday in a bid to slow the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>As of midnight last night, members of the public have been ordered not to leave their homes except in limited circumstances.</p>
<p>People can go out side to shop for essential items, pick up medicines and health, attend medical appointments and exercise within 2km of their homes.</p>
<p>People are only permitted to go to work if it is deemed essential and if it can’t be done from the home.</p>
<p>Last night, the Government said the full list of essential workers would be published “as early as possible” today.</p>
<p>In the meantime, an updated list of shops and retailers that can remain open has been published.</p>
<p>Food retailers and wholesalers.</p>
<p>Shops selling “household consumer products necessary to maintain the safety and sanitation” of homes and businesses.</p>
<p>Pharmacies and chemists.</p>
<p>Specialised shops selling medical and orthopaedic goods.</p>
<p>Petrol station and heating fuel providers.</p>
<p>Pet shops.</p>
<p>Laundries and drycleaners.</p>
<p>Banks, Post Offices and Credit Unions.</p>
<p>Shops selling safety supplies like work clothes and Personal Protective Equipment.</p>
<p>Any outlet that does remain open must put in place strict social distancing measures.</p>
<p>Gardaí have launched a major operation to ensure the public complies with all the new coronavirus restrictions and members will be visiting venues and outlets to ensure they are enforcing the measures.</p>
<p>Meanwhile some other outlets are permitted to operate call-out or delivery services.</p>
<p>opticians/optometrists.</p>
<p>Mechanics and bicycle repair shops.</p>
<p>Hardware stores, builder’s suppliers and gardening outlets.</p>
<p>Office supply stores.</p>
<p>Electrical stores.</p>
<p>IT and phone sales, repair and maintenance services for the home.</p>
<p>Announcing the measures last night, the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: “These are radical actions aimed at saving as many lives as possible in the days and weeks ahead.”</p>
<p>“Freedom was hard won in our country and it jars with us to restrict and limit individual liberties, even temporarily.</p>
<p>“But freedom is not an abstract concept. We give it meaning every single day – in the way we live our lives and in the decisions we take willingly to protect our loved ones.</p>
<p>“So, I am asking people to give meaning to our freedom and liberty by agreeing to these restrictions. Restricting how we live our lives so that so that others may live.”</p>
<p>The full list of services deemed essential enough to continue will be published later this morning.</p>
<p>The Government is advising any service that considers itself essential to remain open until the list is published.

The Minister for Health has confirmed that most construction workers will not be considered ‘essential’ through the COVID-19 lockdown.</p>
<p>The Government is expected to publish a full list of the workers it classes as essential later this morning.</p>
<p>As of midnight, everyone in Ireland has been ordered to stay at home except in limited circumstances in a bid to slow the spreads of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>People can go outside to shop for essential items, pick up medicines and health products, attend medical appointments and exercise within 2km of their homes.</p>
<p>We are only permitted to go to work if it is deemed essential and if it can’t be done from the home.</p>
<p>Health Minister Simon Harris has confirmed construction sites are NOT essential services - unless it’s the building of an essential facility #NewstalkBreakfast — Susan Keogh (@susankeoghnews) March 28, 2020</p>
<p>On Newstalk Breakfast with Susan Keogh this morning, the Health Minister Simon Harris said construction workers will only be permitted to continue if they are building something that is essential to this pandemic.</p>
<p>“So for example if we were to decide that we need to put in modular units or adapt a hotel or build things that we need to actually get through this pandemic – of course that would be essential,” he said.</p>
<p>“But in general, the message is really simple here. I need everyone in Ireland to stay at home.</p>
<p>“You should only be leaving your home if you are absolutely doing something that is essential to getting us through this pandemic and keeping our people safe and well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Essential workers</p>
<p>He outlined some of the things that will be included on the list of essential services later today.</p>
<p>“Essential workers are effectively those of us who have to go to work to ensure the health and social wellbeing of others,” he said.</p>
<p>“So, our nurses, our doctors; people working in our health profession, people caring for people.</p>
<p>“It is people working in the public and civil service, again, keeping the country functioning – but crucially only those who can’t work from home. Everybody should be trying to work from home.</p>
<p>“It will be people providing food and medicinal supplies – the farmer, the food factory or the person selling the food.</p>
<p>“People keeping our utilities going like our water and our electricity and also the transport sector, we need to make sure we can keep on public transport but that is only for and only to be used by essential workers.”</p>
<p>He said everyone who is taking exercise should stay as close to home as possible.</p>
