Arnold Schwarzenegger has been urging others to self-isolate amid the global coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>But on Thursday the 72-year-old former Governor of California stepped out of quarantine to ride bicycles with his daughter Christina Schwarzenegger, 28, in Los Angeles. The pair appeared to be in high spirits as they took in the fresh air.</p>
<p>This comes after The Terminator star debuted his new &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be an a** stay inside&rsquo; t-shirts, which will donate 100% of the profits to After-School All-Stars on Instagram.</p>
<p>All smiles: Arnold Schwarzenegger stepped out of quarantine to ride bikes with his daughter Christina Schwarzenegger, 28</p>
<p>Giving back: The Terminator star advertised his new &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be an a** stay inside&rsquo; t-shirts, which will donate 100% of the profits to After-School All-Stars on Thursday</p>
<p>The father-of-five and his rarely photographed daughter, who graduated from Georgetown University, matched in all-black ensembles, as they rode a few feet apart.</p>
<p>While she is not as well-known as older sister Katherine, 30, who is married to Chris Pratt, Christina appeared with her mom Maria Shriver, 64, on Netflix&rsquo;s Take Your Pills in 2018.</p>
<p>On their outing, as they loaded bikes on the back of his SUV, he politely turned down a fans&rsquo; request for a selfie, to adhere to distancing guidelines.</p>
<p>Father daughter time: The actor and his rarely photographed daughter, who graduated from Georgetown University, matched in all-black ensembles, as they rode six feet away from each other</p>
<p>In the past month, he donated $1 million to the Frontline Responders Fund to help stop the spread of the deadly coronavirus and additional personal protection equipment to hospitals dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mission accomplished,&rsquo; he said in a video he shared on his Instagram Story, in which he wears a mask and shows off shipments full of N95 masks on Wednesday.</p>
<p>On the same day, he called people to &lsquo;stay at home&rsquo; and captioned a video of himself lifting weights in his backyard, &lsquo;Stay at home, stay fit. We cannot control the virus but we can control our fitness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Joy ride: Schwarzenegger took a break from hanging with his donkey and daughter to puff a Cuban Partagas cigar on his Indian Motorcycle on Thursday</p>
<p>Playing around: The 72-year-old former Governor of California has been urging others to self-isolate amid the global pandemic at home, as he shares videos at home with his pet donkey Lulu</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mission accomplished,&rsquo; he said in a video he shared on his Instagram Story, in which he wears a mask and shows off shipments full of N95 masks on Wednesday</p>
<p>&lsquo;We cannot really control the virus, but we can control what kind of shape we stay in,&rsquo; he urged in the video while demonstrating an &lsquo;improvised&rsquo; workout</p>
<p>&lsquo;We cannot really control the virus, but we can control what kind of shape we stay in,&rsquo; he urged in the video while demonstrating an &lsquo;improvised&rsquo; workout. &lsquo;Just as long as you do something every day, bike riding, push-up and sit-ups&hellip;just do it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On Thursday, Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s content focused around his beloved donkey Lulu, who he is &lsquo;trying to teach&rsquo; social distancing.</p>
<p>In the video on his Instagram, Lulu can be seen waiting outside for her dad to open the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;PUT THAT COOKIE DOWN,&rsquo; he captioned the video on Instagram, which featured him kissing the donkey&rsquo;s head and hugging her neck</p>
<p>Beloved pet: Schwarzenegger&rsquo;s content has been focused around his beloved donkey Lulu, who he is &lsquo;trying to teach&rsquo; social distancing</p>
<p>While he doesn&rsquo;t film himself letting her in, he later shows himself feeding her a snack in the kitchen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;PUT THAT COOKIE DOWN,&rsquo; he captioned the video on Instagram, which featured him kissing the donkey&rsquo;s head and hugging her neck.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, he hilariously posed with his pet in front of a chess board and revealed on Twitter she&rsquo;s not the best &lsquo;partner, but she&rsquo;s getting there.&rsquo;

新冠肺炎疫情在全球肆虐，不少藝人都發聲呼籲大家盡量減少外出，留在家中抗疫。阿諾舒華辛力加（Arnold Schwarzenegger）繼早前在家中拍片大晒他與寵物驢子和迷你馬的生活，最近又再捐了5萬個口罩給社區，不過都另一位男星亦出心出力，直接與政府合作建立病毒檢測站。</p>

<p>新冠肺炎在全球大流行，各國政府都呼籲大家盡可能留在家中，減低受感染機會。</p>
<p>現年72歲的荷里活演員兼前加州州長阿諾舒華辛力加，早前就拍片示範如何留家抗疫，更在片中大晒兩隻寵物驢子「Lulu」和迷你馬「Whiskey」在家的生活，又拿紅蘿蔔餵飼Lulu和Whiskey，表示就算留在家中一起吃飯，都感覺很開心。</p>
<ul>
<li>10 + 9 + 8</li>
</ul>
<p>除了在家與驢子和馬玩樂避免外出，擔任過加州州長的阿諾更向慈善機構「GoFundMe」基金捐了100萬美元（約775萬美元），日前更到了洛杉磯的醫院，捐贈5萬個N95口罩給醫護人員。</p>

<p>之後他接受外媒訪問時就首次回應，「我們的最終責任不僅是平衡預算，而且是挽救生命。」他指出2006年為了應對禽流感爆發，他在擔任加州州長期間就成立過有關流行病的基金，但2011年他卸任之後，因為面對260億美元的赤字，州長Jerry Brown和州議員就撤銷了資金。阿諾表示他明白每個人的處事和管理風格不同，但現時就疫情來看，當時撤銷這基金的決定就有點短視。</p>

<p>除了阿諾，其實荷里活不少演員都出錢又出力，捐口罩、親自為前線醫護人員送餐，甚至建立新冠肺炎病毒檢測站，主要為老人及長期病患人士作快速測試。</p>
<p>點撃即睇荷里活演員如何出心出力？

California may be under a &lsquo;safer at home&rsquo; order due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>But clearly former state governor Arnold Schwarzenegger finds it hard to remain indoors during these difficult times even as he practices social distancing.</p>
<p>The Hollywood star, 72, has been seen out on bicycle rides and taking his motorbike for a spin several times in recent days and on Wednesday, he took a trip in his vintage army truck with girlfriend Heather Milligan.</p>
<p>Trip: Arnold Schwarzenegger took girlfriend Heather Milligan out for a ride in his vintage Army truck in Santa Monica on Wednesday during the &lsquo;safer at home&rsquo; order in place in the state</p>
<p>Schwarzenegger took the wheel wearing round sunglasses and with a cigar to hand.</p>
<p>The bearded Terminator star was dressed in an Arnold Classic logo&rsquo;d zipper jacket with the US flag on one sleeve over a blue t-shirt advertising a gym in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<p>He added baggy black sweatpants and black slip-on shoes for his outing.</p>
<p>Schwarzenegger and Milligan, who is 27 years his junior, have been dating since the summer of 2015.</p>
<p>Casual: The bearded Terminator star, 72, was dressed in an Arnold Classic logo&rsquo;d zipper jacket and baggy black sweatpants. He sported round sunglasses and chomped on a cigar</p>
<p>Likes his truck: On Tuesday, the former bodybuilder showed off his Army truck in a video posted to Twitter in which he encouraged people to &lsquo;stay fit&rsquo; during the COVID-19 crisis</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the former bodybuilder showed off his Army truck in a video posted to Twitter in which he encouraged people to &lsquo;stay fit&rsquo; during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>He drove the vehicle to a scenic overlook and unloaded a large dumbbell from the back and started lifting weights.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We cannot really control the virus but we can control the kind of shape we stay in,&rsquo; he said in the clip.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just as long as you do something every day, that is the important thing,&rsquo; he added. &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s stay strong, let&rsquo;s stay fit, let&rsquo;s train at home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Fresh air and exercise: In the video, he&rsquo;s seen driving the truck to a scenic overlook for a workout</p>
<p>Staying fit: Schwarzenegger unloaded a large dumbbell from the back and after some stretches, he started lifting weights</p>
<p>&lsquo;We cannot really control the virus but we can control the kind of shape we stay in,&rsquo; he said in the clip. &lsquo;Just as long as you do something every day, that is the important thing,&rsquo; he added</p>
<p>Last week, Schwarzenegger announced via social media that he has donated $1 million to a GoFundMe campaign raising money for a Frontline Responders Fund and urged his fans to contribute too.</p>
<p>The fund was created by global freight and trade technology company Flexport to get critical protective supplies to medical workers in hospitals around the world who are on the frontlines dealing with the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday, the fund had received contributions totaling more than $5 million.</p>
<p>In a statement, the actor said: &lsquo;Our doctors, nurses and hospital staff are the real action heroes of this crisis. I just play one in the movies.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have an opportunity and a responsibility to provide them with personal protective equipment right now to keep them safe as they fight this virus, so when I heard about Flexport.org’s plan, this was a no-brainer to me,</p>
<p>&lsquo;With all of the courageous work they are doing on the frontlines to keep us safe, buying a few hundred thousand masks with a million dollars is the least I can do. Please take a moment to join me in supporting our heroes,&rsquo; he concluded.
