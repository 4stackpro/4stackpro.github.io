The right candidate to fill your job may not be looking for a job at this time. HireSweet, which is part of the current Y Combinator new business class, is trying to help companies find exactly these candidates that are perfect for a job but are not actively seeking.

Like many other recruitment platforms, HireSweet The team began working on an evaluation tool, but then realized that the problem that companies faced was not really an evaluation, but that they were looking for the right candidates.

"So we made a little more progress in the value chain and helped companies find engineers," HireSweet co-founder and CEO Robin Choy told me. "And what is really interesting in the market is that most people are not actively seeking work. StackOverflow figures show that 30% of candidates will move after applying for a position and 60% are open to new opportunities, but never actively seek work. "

To recruit these candidates, companies must first identify these passive candidates and then essentially run for them, in the same way that a candidate would apply for a job. Traditionally, recruiters have been doing this manually, looking at LinkedIn and GitHub â€“ or outsourcing this work to agencies.

What HireSweet is doing is automating this process. Their systems search the web for public profiles of potential candidates for employment and then send that information to employers. However, as Choy pointed out, it's not just about saving time. "Thanks to that huge (amount) of information, we are able to detect patterns that a human would miss. So we know, for example, when someone updates their LinkedIn resume or when there is a discrepancy between their LinkedIn resume and their activity GitHub, which shows that they may be interested in changing technologies, "he said.

The company promises significantly better accuracy, compared to the competition. Choy argues that some of his clients are seeing 80% accuracy, which HireSweet defines as having an 80% contact rate for the candidates he shows. And although part of the company's technology stack involves machine learning, much of it also included old regular expressions (after all, if a resume says that someone is an "independent professional", there is no need to build an algorithm that predicts that this person is in fact an independent professional).

HireSweet also adopts a very practical approach with the incorporation of new clients. "We always contact people by phone with a company, superhuman style, because we really want to understand what the company is looking for," Choy explained. "That is also a very specific learning we had in recent years: public job descriptions are rarely the actual job descriptions of the person they are going to hire. So we spent a lot of time talking with the company."

Because virtually all companies already offer recruitment tools, HireSweet offers a number of integrations with these, and Choy tells me that the team plans to expand this to allow for deeper and deeper integrations.

HireSweet started working on this product about three and a half years ago and then raised about $ 1.5 million two and a half years ago. Today paris The company-based company has 30 employees, and its customers now include people like BlaBlaCar, Dashlane and Nokia. After focusing mainly on the European market, the team is not working to expand to the US market. UU., Where now has about 100 customers. This also meant adapting the system to the way in which US companies recruit and how employees move between jobs, which changes a lot between countries. Choy said the team will likely focus its road map in the United States in the future and then bring those innovations to Europe over time.
