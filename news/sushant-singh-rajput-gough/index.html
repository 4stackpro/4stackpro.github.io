<p>In January this year, Sushant Singh Rajput turned 34 and the actor &lsquo;s rumoured girfriend Rhea Chakraborty had shared an adorable wish for him accompanied with some super cute pictures. Take a look below.</p>
<p>Sushant Singh Rajput left a deep void across film industries in India as reports of his suicide surfaced on Sunday afternoon. The actor, who had made his mark in the film and television space, was mourned by his fans and the industry widely on social media. All of 34, Sushant was rumoured to be dating Rhea Chakraborty.

<p>In January this year, Sushant had turned 34 and the actor had celebrated a low-key birthday.

Bollywood actor, Sushant Singh Rajput is everyone’s favourite because of his struggle story and because of his super-humble nature despite being a big name in the Indian film industry. The actor has stunned everyone with his exceptional performances in movies like Kai Po Che!, Kedarnath, MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, Sonchiriya, and Chhichhore. However, another big reason why people are in love with this good-looking man goes to the bond that he shares with his late mother. The actor never skips a chance to credit his mother for all the success he has achieved in his life and how much he misses her.

<p>Well, this time around the actor chooses a great way to describe his emotions for his mother and that is poetry. We have seen Sushant Singh Rajput expressing his deep pain quite beautifully under the flesh of sugary words. The actor has posted a poem for his late mother as he remembers her and it also welcomes a warm comment from his rumoured girlfriend, Rhea Chakraborty.</p>

<p>On June 3, 2020, Kedarnath and MS Dhoni: The Untold Story actor, Sushant Singh Rajput took to his Instagram handle and shared a beautiful monochrome collage, consisting his mother’s picture on the left and his picture on the right. It’s easy to predict that the actor was missing his mother so badly in this difficult time because he rarely showcases his emotions in front of everyone on social media. But this time, maybe it was better to let those words out in front of everybody and the actor did that quite beautifully as he wrote down a small tear-jerker poem which can be read as “Blurred past evaporating from teardrops. Unending dreams carving an arc of a smile. And a fleeting life, negotiating between the two&hellip;Maa” followed by a red heart emoticon. Take a look.

<p>After his post went live on Instagram, millions of his fans started heaping praises on his poetry and also supported him with their warm messages. Also, some of the popular names from the film and television industry have commented on his post but it was a simple comment from his rumoured girlfriend and actress, Rhea Chakraborty that took all the attention from others. The actress simply wrote four red heart emoticons on his post. Take a look.</p>
<p>advertisement</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, Sushant Singh Rajput’s mother had left him for the heavenly adobe, when he was just 16-year-old. In a lot of interviews, Sushant Singh Rajput had talked about the impact of his mother’s demise in his life and the eternal void with which he lives. He had explained, “It&rsquo;s not that I miss her only when something good or bad happens to me. I wouldn&rsquo;t lie but I am not incessantly thinking of her. I wish she was alive to see me succeed in life. I am sure she would have been really happy and proud of me. And maybe I would have been a different person than what I am now. The way I looked at things then and now, they are very different and I cannot go back to doing that.”</p>
<p>advertisement</p>
<p>Last year on May 6, 2019, Sushant Singh had taken to his Instagram handle and had posted a stunning monochrome image of him sitting on top of a chair and posing for the camera. But along with the picture, the actor had written a small poem for his late mother describing the condition of his life without her. His heart-melting poem could be read as &ldquo;As long as you were. I was. Now just in my memories. I come alive. Like that shadow. But just flickers. Time doesn’t move here. It’s beautiful mother. It’s forever.” Take a look.</p>
<p>advertisement</p>
<p>In the end, you’ll be amazed to know that the actor has immortalised his beloved mother in 2017 by getting a beautiful and meaningful tattoo on his back. The pictures of his tattoo had gone viral at that time but everyone was surprised when Sushant Singh Rajput had explained the meaning behind his tattoo in an interview with the Hindustan Times. He had explained, “The tattoo is a symbolic representation of five elements. My mother and I are in the centre, implying it is a bond that not even time can defy. The five elements are widely accepted symbols. However, the idea of using my mother and me as elements was thought of by my sister and me.” (Also Read: Gautam Rode Shares Wedding Video Of Him Dancing On &lsquo;Main Joru Ka Ghulam&rsquo; For Wife, Pankhuri Awasthy)</p>

Sushant Singh Rajput turned 34 today. And probably the first one to shower him with love on the occasion is his girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty. Needless to say, Rhea&rsquo;s birthday wish has found a place in the gossip columns. More than the adorable birthday wish for Sushant, her post has grabbed our attention for the fact that they have finally made their &ldquo;hush-hush affair&rdquo; Insta official.</p>
<p>Rhea, who has been reportedly dating Sushant for a year, took to Instagram to wish him a happy birthday. In her post, Rhea called Sushant a &ldquo;supermassive black hole&rdquo; and we wish we knew what that meant!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy birthday to the most beautiful &ldquo;supermassive black hole&rdquo; that is known to mankind! Shine on you crazy diamond @sushantsinghrajput #boywithagoldenheart #rheality,&rdquo; read Rhea&rsquo;s caption.</p>
<p>The actress shared two pictures with her boyfriend on the handle. In the first picture, the lovebirds can be seen sitting together on a bench at the park. While Rhea is making a weird face with her arm resting on his shoulder, Sushant is happily enjoying the moment with his lady love.</p>
<p>The second photo shows Rhea and Sushant on a boat against the backdrop of a sea, and it seems to have been clicked on a holiday.</p>
<p>Rhea and Sushant were holidaying together in Paris, Italy and Ladakh last year, glimpses of which went viral on social media thanks to several fan clubs. The couple shared solo photos of themselves from the vacations and ensured that they do not put out any picture where they are seen together. Except for one photo with their close friends.</p>
<p>Speaking of Sushant Singh Rajput, he has been tight-lipped about his relationship status to the extent of saying that he is single. At the India Today Mind Rocks Delhi 2019, the Chhichhore actor had said, &ldquo;I am single. I am not in a relationship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rhea and Sushant have also been spotted by the paparazzi several times.</p>
<p>It was in May last year when a source close to Sushant Singh Rajput revealed that they are dating each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sushant is currently seeing Rhea Chakraborty. They have known each other for a while and they hit it off really well in the last few weeks. In fact, things moved from one thing to the other quite quickly and now, they are already dating each other,&rdquo; the source had said.</p>
<p>Talking about their hush-hush affair, the source added, &ldquo;Rhea and Sushant have been spending a lot of quality time nowadays. They are still calling each other &lsquo;good friends&rsquo; but the reality is that they are already seeing each other. When Sushant is not in town, he is chilling at his Lonavala house, Rhea also accompanies him sometimes. They are keeping their relationship hush-hush for now before taking it to the next level.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Rhea, Sushant Singh Rajput has been linked with Kriti Sanon and Sara Ali Khan. But looks like Sushant has found his true love in Rhea Chakraborty.</p>

Though his movie on space Chanda Mama Door Ke got shelved, Sushant Singh Rajput’s love for space and the science behind it is well-known. The actor’s posts around it on social media used to make headlines some time ago. As the MS Dhoni: The Untold Story star returned to social media after two months, it was once again the stars that caught his attention.</p>

<p>The 34-year-old broke his Instagram ‘silence’ that was on since January 24, with a photo of him enjoying a ‘starry night’. For company was the book Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions, and that it seems made him believe that the airplane in the sky was travelling to Venus.</p>
<p>Sushant then acknowledged that he had been missing from the scene on Instagram for some time, writing ‘long time’ and asking his fans how they were doing.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the post</p>
<p>Not sure if rumoured girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty was a part of the ‘starry night&rsquo;, but she had a heartwarming reply to his post, calling it ‘cute.’</p>
<p>Sushant’s last post was a monochrome pic in January and the one before was also two months before that, in November, where he had spoken about ‘recovering.’</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, his career experienced both ups and down. While he delivered one of his biggest hits with Chhichhore, movies like Sonchiriya and Drive did not create a mark.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is being reported that the rumoured couple is finally set to do a film together. They have signed a film for Vashu Bhagnani’s banner, reports claimed. They were spotted together after a workout recently too.</p>
