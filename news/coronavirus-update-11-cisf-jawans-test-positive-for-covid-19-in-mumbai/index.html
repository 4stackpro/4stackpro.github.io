<p>Updated: Mar 31, 2020 16:05 IST</p>
<p>A Mumbai-based head constable of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), who tested positive for novel coronavirus (Covid-19) on March 27, has tested negative in the latest report, officials said.</p>
<p>Rajesh Ranjan, director-general, CISF, confirmed to Hindustan Times that the latest test results of the head constable proved negative. “However, he will remain in quarantine for 14 days,” he said.</p>
<p>All personnel have been ordered to report to their commanders if any of their family members have recently returned from abroad, he added.</p>
<p>“We are taking all the precautions while performing our duties such as maintaining a safe distance, keeping the workplace sanitised. Besides, each and every personnel, who are showing even mild symptoms, are being quarantined,” the DG, CRPF said.</p>
<p>A Border Security Force (BSF) officer tested Covid-19 positive last week and his wife, who had returned from the United Kingdom, is also suspected to be infected.</p>
<p>CISF officials are maintaining a similar level of alertness at airports, which are currently shut because of the 21-day nationwide lockdown due to the Covid-19 outbreak, but the personnel have been asked to take care of their personal hygiene.</p>
<p>The CISF has also extended the leaves of personnel, who have gone home on vacation.</p>
<p>The BSF has warned that any personnel found violating the Covid-19 protocol or guidelines issued by the Union ministry of home affairs will be penalised.</p>
<p>The central paramilitary forces, including BSF, CISF, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), have jointly arranged around 7,500 beds for Covid-19 patients and are in the process of identifying their other locations that can be turned into hospitals/quarantine facilities.
