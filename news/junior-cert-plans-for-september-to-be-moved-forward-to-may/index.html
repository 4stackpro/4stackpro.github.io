The plan to hold Junior Cert written exams in September will likely be scrapped in favour of school-based assessments in May.</p>
<p>Education Minister Joe McHugh had previously announced that the Junior Cert exams in June were to be cancelled and would be replaced by exams and assessments when the next academic year kicks off in September.</p>
<p>The move has likely been made to ease unnecessary anxiety hanging over students due to delayed exams.</p>
<p>According to the Irish Times, the Department of Education is set to make the announcement next week where they will advise schools to conduct their own junior-cycle assessments.</p>
<p>The assessments will not be written or graded by the State Examinations Commission, instead student’s work will be marked by their own teachers.</p>
<p>It is likely that schools will be given the freedom to decide on how to arrange assessments, the Irish Times also reported.</p>
<p>Students may be given project work to finish in their own time or schools where all students have access to digital devices may conduct a more traditional exam.</p>
<p>The marks will contribute to the school-issued Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement (JCPA).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Leaving Certificate is set to begin on July 29 after being postponed earlier this month.</p>
<p>It is understood that students will have a timetable of their exams in the first week of June.</p>
<p>Mr McHugh has said that the Department has alternative ‘plan B’s if the Leaving Cert cannot go ahead.</p>
<p>The Education Minister said that the decision is not being made in a ‘blinkered way’ and that the Department of Education has alternative ‘plan Bs’.</p>
<p>It is understood that the students will have their timetables in the first week of June.</p>
<p>The Education Minister said: ‘We won’t go into this in a blinkered way. We are living in the real world.</p>
<p>‘Yes, we could face enormous challenges that we’re not in a position to make predictions about,’ he said.

<h3 id="dept-confirms-no-junior-cert-exams-this-year">Dept confirms no Junior Cert exams this year</h3>
<p><img src="https://img.rasset.ie/00067866-1600.jpg" alt="img">
The Department of Education has confirmed that there will be no state certified Junior Certificate exams this year.</p>
<p>It has confirmed that while Junior Certificate papers prepared by the State Examinations Commission will be sent to schools for use in school based exams in the Autumn - completed exam papers will not then be used for any form of state certification.</p>
<p>The marking scheme devised by the SEC for the Junior Certificate papers will also be made available to schools, however schools themselves are free to decide how the papers might be marked, and by whom.</p>
<p>In recent years second level teachers here have expressed strong opposition, via their unions, to marking their own students&rsquo; work for state certification purposes.</p>
<p>Attempts to introduce such a practice ran aground several years ago as a result of teacher trade union resistance.</p>
<p>Yesterday one Galway school became to first to announce that it is dispensing entirely with this year&rsquo;s Junior Cycle exam arrangements.</p>
<p>Coláiste Bhaile Chláir has decided to run its own end of year assessments over the coming weeks, using technology to allow students complete assignments remotely, and using exam papers and tests designed by its own teachers.

<h3 id="uncertainty-still-abounds-for-cork-students-and-teachers-over-leaving-cert-changes">Uncertainty still abounds for Cork students and teachers over Leaving Cert changes</h3>
<p><img src="http://www.echolive.ie/portalsuite/image/7c818338-056b-4aac-ba9e-792f36216a7b/leaving-cert-exams-_90147715_90597183.jpg/mainMediaSize=600x0_type=image_publish=true__image.jpg" alt="img">
Uncertainty still abounds for Cork students and teachers over Leaving Cert changes</p>
<p>There has been mixed reaction from students and teachers in Cork following the announcement of a date for the Leaving Cert.</p>
<p>It was confirmed on Thursday that the state exam will begin on July 29.</p>
<p>Cian Pierce, a student at Glanmire Community College who last week called for the Leaving Cert to be cancelled, said that while it has given students clarity, it’s still not adequate.</p>
<p>“For better or for worse, but mostly worse, it has given us clarity. Even my peers who were in favor of the postponement seem to think they’re just stretching it out and again the general consensus is that they’re not listening or taking students seriously,” Mr Pierce said.</p>
<p>He said that there has still been no information given beyond the start date, and that there is much speculation about how the exams can be held, due to social distancing guidelines.</p>
<p>“Overall there’s still a lot of confusion and discontent,” Cian added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Principal of Douglas Community School Pat Barry told The Echo that there is a “certain element of clarity” regarding the start date, but there is still room for changes.</p>
<p>“The idea is that it will go ahead, but I suppose, nobody has 100% certainty on that either, with the way the numbers (of cases) are going on a daily basis - up one day and down the next,” he said.</p>
<p>He said that the proposal to hold one exam a day will make studying for the individual exams easier than traditionally, but as a result will draw the exams out for longer. Mr Barry also said that holding the exams so late in the summer could affect other aspects of the students’ lives.</p>
<p>“It affects many things for them, like summer jobs, saving money for college. The leaving cert holiday won’t happen.” Overall, he believes that as regards the exams themselves, the Leaving Cert being in a format that students are used to is positive, especially as they have been doing work on past exam papers over the last few months.</p>
<p>“They will be presented with the exams in the same format that they’re used to, and that familiarity brings a certain element of comfort for them and they are satisfied with that. But, it’s a lot removed from the traditional format that it was, which will make the whole thing very different,” Mr Barry said.</p>
<p>He went on to say that there has been no direction given yet on social distancing guidelines, but that not holding the Junior Cert exams at the same time will make it somewhat easier to manage.</p>
<p>“One of the advantages of the certainty of saying the Junior Cycle exams were not going to go ahead at the same time, is that the exam centres - classrooms, halls or assembly areas - that you would be using for the Junior Cert can now be devoted to the leaving cert, giving that extra space,” he said.</p>
<p>Close to 100 students will sit their Leaving Cert in Douglas Community College.</p>
<p>“Managing social distancing for us will be difficult. We’ll need far more centres than we traditionally would have and that will take extra supervisors to manage,” Mr Barry said.
