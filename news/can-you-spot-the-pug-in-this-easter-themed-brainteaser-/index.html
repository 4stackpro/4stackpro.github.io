<p>3 Can you find the cheeky pug hiding amongst these multi-coloured Easter eggs? Credit: CIA Landlord</p>
<p>The devilishly hard puzzle asks Brits to find the pug hiding among the treats - and it&rsquo;s a good way to kill a few hours in quarantine.</p>
<p>Dozens of eggs are covered in various designs and patterns, which cleverly masks the mutt camouflaged in their midst.</p>
<p>As well as it being Easter, the team behind the brainteaser decided to hide a pug to coincide with National Pet Day, which falls on Easter Sunday.</p>
<p>They worked out the most pet-friendly areas of the UK, with Belfast named as the best location for pet owners to rent, while Birmingham was the worst.</p>
<p>3 If you&rsquo;ve got a few hour&rsquo;s to kill, why not see if you can spot the pug hiding among the Easter eggs Credit: Getty Images - Getty</p>
<p>Meanwhile the north east was found to have the most number of people lying to their landlords about keeping a pet, with 89 per cent telling a fib.</p>
<p>But Londoners weren’t far behind, with 83 per cent confessing to keeping an illegal pet.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve spent enough time looking for the dog but can’t seem to find the pooch anywhere, fear not as we’ve circled the pug in red below.</p>
<p>3 Don&rsquo;t worry - it took us a long while to find the pug too Credit: CIA Landlord</p>
